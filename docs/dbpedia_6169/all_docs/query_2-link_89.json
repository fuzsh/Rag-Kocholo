        "text": "Number 21, November 2000\n\nWaste not: Managed correctly, farm manure could be the next big thing in renewable energy\n\nRiedinger: Partner universities represent troves of talent\n\nBill signed; full '01 funding for SNS\n\nLab Notes\n\nCleanup projects reach the end game\n\nLab packs a publishing punch\n\nA front man in a crisis\n\nHFIR pauses for new reflector\n\nUT-Battelle honors 300+ at its first Awards Night\n\nORNL people\n\nNovember is benefits open enrollment; Long-term care among new offerings\n\nLetters\n\nHR generalists named\n\nDespite everything, wheels roll\n\nWaste not: Managed correctly, farm manure could be the next big thing in renewable energy\n\nInstead of creating a problem, Bossy could be a source of renewable, clean energy on the farm.\n\nWe�re not likely to ever run short. Often it�s a problem, but it could be a strong renewable energy resource candidate. We�re talking about farm animal manure. As the animal farm industry has concentrated more and more production on smaller parcels of land, handling the outflow has become a more serious pollution issue.\n\nBut that manure, John Sheffield says, also represents a gold mine as an energy source, if the farmers can get enough economical and technological help in putting it to better use.\n\n�In the past, a small animal farm could be a more or less closed ecological system. The manure was the fertilizer for the crops used to feed the animals. Now operations are larger and more concentrated and the feed may come from producers far away. For example, corn grown in the Midwest feeds animals in the East. Unfortunately, the manure as an unmodified fertilizer is much less valuable than the feed. Therefore it is not economic to ship it back.�\n\nToday, many farms spread the dung on local fields. But those fields may already be saturated with phosphates, and the runoff pollutes stream, rivers and the water system generally. The problems are compounded by the presence of both pathogens and antibiotics in the manure. The odor and dust from the animal farm operations is also seen as a public nuisance and a health hazard.\n\n�It is a challenge to develop a system to reduce pollution, while ensuring the retention of a strong U.S. livestock and poultry industry. There are concerns that failure to meet this challenge could lead to the industry moving off-shore to countries with lower environmental standards,� says John. �Providing value-added products from manure�electricity, heat and a more concentrated fertilizer�is the way to offset the costs of reducing air and water pollutants.�\n\nFortunately, it is a problem that, he says, is �absolutely fixable.� Ultimately, it may be fixed at a profit using modern technologies and systems, many of them from ORNL and other DOE laboratories, including biotechnology, catalysts, advanced materials, separations systems, improved combustion, instrumentation and controls and computer models. Work in this area has received a boost from the President�s bio-based products and bio-energy initiative for commercialization of technologies and the Lugar bill for research, development and deployment.\n\n�Animal manure has value,� he says. �The United States produces 1.4 billion tons of wet manure a year, or more than 200 million tons in dry weight. The solids have value: as fertilizer, because it is rich in phosphates, and as an energy source. Those 200 million tons of manure contain energy equal to the energy in about 100 million tons of coal, roughly 10 percent of U.S. annual coal use.�\n\nThe energy in one year's U.S. output of manure is equal to 10 percent of annual coal use.\n\nWaste treatment systems can capture methane gas from anaerobic digestion of manure, or through gasification or burning to provide an energy source to produce electricity and process heat. After undergoing these processes, the manure will have lower concentrations of polluting phosphates and also will have much reduced levels pathogens and antibiotics, allowing it to be recycled more readily.\n\nThrough the University of Tennessee�s Joint Institute for Energy and Environmental Studies, ORNL, the Tennessee Valley Authority and UT�s College of Agriculture have been discussing various approaches for helping farmers.\n\nR&D and demonstrations are needed because many of the systems for energy production installed over recent decades have failed. John cites one success�a North Carolina hog farmer who recycles his manure, traps methane gas that is used to make electricity and hot water to warm his barns, and recovers nutrients that are used to fertilize tomatoes. In addition, the farmer uses carbon dioxide exhausted from the process to enhance tomato growth. The whole operation is odorless, John says.\n\nTechnology is one of the fundamental issues, along with simple economics and regulatory policies.\n\n�We simply don�t pay enough to the farmer,� he says. �The price of meat, milk and eggs doesn�t cover the social cost of producing them. Just as we pay a fee per tire to dispose of old ones, consumers should pay, one way or another, a realistic price to help farmers reduce pollution. The challenge in providing a system is to make sure that money actually gets back to the farmer. Green labeling can be part of the approach.�\n\nLaws concerning farm runoff vary from state to state and often penalize farmers who would otherwise deal responsibly with waste. Areas with tough restrictions often drive operations to other states or countries with lax codes, which worsens the pollution problems there.The farmers need consistent laws and policies that allow them to dispose of manure soundly and profitably.\n\n�A whole range of products could be produced from waste that could recover three or four cents of every five spent in recycling. We need industry-based support that doesn�t put the load on the farmer. The technology providers should take the risk, and it will require government help. You have to prime the pump,� he says.\n\nThrough the Joint Institute, John is working with farm industries, farmers, trade associations, universities and other government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture to come up with policies and technologies that help farmers deal with their waste products and convert them into beneficial uses: Not only beneficial to them, but to their neighbors and to the environment as a whole.\n\nJohn Sheffield sees it as an opportunity. Farm manure represents a potential energy source that rivals many other renewable resources, and it is a crop nutrient resource as well. ORNL, with its expertise in biofuels, bioreactors, computing, instrumentation and controls, materials and renewable energy technologies, is ideally situated to contribute to taking advantage of this timeless and endless resource.�B.C.\n\nRiedinger: Partner universities represent troves of talent\n\nLee Riedinger\n\nOne of the questions from the audience at October 2�s senior staff meeting related to the enduring quest for youth. ORNL, with an aging staff and tight budgets, is finding that new, talented staff members are increasingly harder to find and hire, particularly in competitive technical fields. All labs are facing that problem.\n\nAn important key to a solution for ORNL may lie with UT-Battelle�s university partners, says Deputy Director for Science and Technology Lee Riedinger. Those universities�Duke, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Virginia, Florida State and North Carolina State�joined the University of Tennessee and Battelle partnership to bid for the ORNL contract last year.\n\n�This Lab is going to grow, but that growth won�t be possible if we can�t attract excellent scientists and engineers, particularly in competitive areas such as computational and materials science,� says Lee. �Joint appointments with our partner universities are a good way to attract those people. They can receive the best of both worlds through these arrangements.�\n\nLee explains that universities have graduate students and teaching appointments that provide some relief from funding pressures, while national laboratories have the best equipment and the �highest density� of experts. ORNL�s experimental and user facilities have historically been a magnet for students and faculty from universities. Now the Lab seeks to build those relationships toward providing the talent growth the facets of the Laboratory Agenda will require.\n\n�UT is ideally situated for ORNL collaborations because it�s close by. Outlying universities are more difficult simply because of logistics,� Lee says. �You really have to know how to work together, and the UT-ORNL successive model of shared faculty has demonstrated that. We intend to solve these issues as we work with our core university partners, then in time step out to include more schools.�\n\nDifferent universities bring different strengths, Lee notes. Virginia Tech, for instance, has strong engineering research, while the University of Virginia stands out with its medicine and basic sciences programs.\n\n�We want to learn them as they learn us,� he says. �We can match up in common growth areas, and the resulting short-term marriages�for instance, cost-sharing postdoctoral researchers� can lead to scientists on our staff and faculty members for the schools.�\n\nRiedinger is a product of such a �marriage.� As a Vanderbilt graduate student, he came to ORNL through his professor, Joe Hamilton, to do radioactive decay studies under Noah Johnson. Hamilton later was a force in building the ORNL Holifield accelerator lab into a first-class user facility. Lee went on to become a department head at UT and the S&T deputy director at ORNL.\n\n�As far as I know, Vanderbilt was the first example of the Lab�s working closely with a distant university, while UT and ORNL have worked together for decades,� Lee says.\n\n�It helps to have graduate students here�you have those active minds, eager to learn and talented. They give you a boost. But it is sometimes difficult to arrange to have grad students from distant universities come here for their research, and it can be tough for them since they have much course work to take. These difficulties can be overcome by having good scientist-faculty connections and a partnership that benefits both sides�the lab and the school.\n\n�Our relationships with the partner universities will build on that. That�s the model.��B.C.\n\nBill signed; full �01 funding for SNS\n\nPresident Clinton signed Energy and Water appropriations legislation on October 27. The act is significant for ORNL: It represents major milestones for two major Lab projects�the Spallation Neutron Source and a new Mouse House .\n\nThe bill contains $278 million for the SNS, the full amount of the administration�s request for Fiscal Year 2001, and a figure that came out of House and Senate conference through funds that were added late in the budgeting process. The law boosts basic research in DOE�s Office of Science by $399 million, or 14 percent.\n\nFull funding for the SNS is good news for all six of the partnering laboratories. Besides ORNL, the project is a collaboration among the Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, Los Alamos, Brookhaven and Jefferson laboratories. That teamwork is being cited as a major factor in the SNS�s budget success and could prove to be a bellweather strategy for funding big science projects in the future. The SNS� final price tag is about $1.4 billion.\n\nThe bill also provides $2.5 million for concept and design work for a new Mouse House, which will be located on the west end of the Laboratory. The Mouse House is currently located in a deteriorating facility at Y-12. ORNL is also positioning itself to play a significant role in a new nanotechnology initiative that received significant funding in the legislation.�B.C.\n\nCleanup projects reach the end game\n\nTwo cleanup projects on the ORNL site recently reached their final stages, meaning a lot of waste material is outtahere. The first�a major, major one�is the removal of sludge from the Gunite tanks at the intersection of Central Avenue and Third Street. The tanks, installed during World War II to catch Manhattan Project wastes, had been emptied in the 1980s but still contained some pretty nasty sludge.\n\nDump trucks fill the former 3524 pond.\n\nRobotic and remotely operated equipment, much of it staged and tested by ORNL, was used to clean the inside of the tanks. The technology is likely to be used at Hanford and other DOE cleanup sites\n\nThe tank farm shares an intersection with the ORNL cafeteria, and the sludge was considered a potential risk to workers and the public. The project is the first of its kind to be completed in the United States.\n\nIf you walk on down Third Street to White Oak Avenue, you�ll notice that the 3524 holding pond is now a gravel lot. It�s actually filled with boulders, 70 truckloads of grout and another 70 truckloads of gravel. More sediment removal from the area is planned for next year.\n\nWhat�s going to happen to those sites? Tim Myrick, who heads the facilities moderization project, says the former ponds will eventually become parking lots. There is no near-term reuse plan for the Gunite tank farm, however: The tanks will be filled with grout and remain in place.\n\nLab packs a publishing punch\n\nORNL is maintaining its position as a scientific publishing powerhouse. The Lab is ranked in the top 10 of U.S. universities, national labs and industrial institutions in eight categories of the most frequently published institutions, according to a recent survey by the Institute for Scientific Information. That�s more than any other national lab.\n\nORNL is the only DOE lab to lead all of the 139 institutions in the survey in categories of the number of publications, and we did it in two: spectroscopy/instrumentation/analytical science and nuclear engineering. ORNL also has the most publications in the 1981�1999 period of any institution in those categories.\n\nORNL was one of three DOE labs with a number two ranking in a category, appearing second in metallurgy. Other top 10 appearances in number of publications for ORNL include third in biotechnology and applied microbiology, fifth in materials science and engineering, seventh in environmental engineering/energy, eighth in instrumentation/measurement, and ninth in applied physics/condensed matter physics/materials science.\n\nA front man in a crisis\n\nWhen the reactor at Three-Mile Island went awry in May of 1979, chaos reigned in the media room. President Carter dispatched Harold Denton of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to restore order and help get a lucid message on the situation at TMI to both the White House and an increasingly frantic public.\n\nChristina Carbajo and Graydon Yoder, both students at Oak Ridge High School, performed Latin dances at last month�s Hispanic Heritage celebration. Graydon is the son of Graydon Yoder of the Engineering Technology Division; Christina is the daughter of ETD�s Juan Carbajo.\n\nDenton shared the history-changing experience with a Lab audience on October 16, hosted by the Laboratory Shift Superintendent�s emergency operations folks. He stressed the importance of being prepared for trouble at all times.\n\n�Don�t become complacent. You need a good public relations program prepared for emergencies,� he said.\n\nMetropolitan Edison, the TMI operator, had next to none. Soon experts and commentators from all over the country were describing the scene and the perceived threat of a hydrogen bubble that had accumulated in the reactor vessel. The bubble�s threat proved to be minimal, but the sometimes hyperbolic rhetoric that sprang out of the crisis dashed the fortunes of the nuclear industry.\n\nDenton said he maintained an open line to the White House, had the confidence of Pennsylvania�s governor and eventually was able to convey that the situation at TMI was manageable and in control, but not before 400,000 citizens evacuated the surrounding area even though no evacuation order was issued.\n\nDenton says candor, credibility and refraining from speculation and blaming are crucial in such times. News releases, he says, are next to useless when real-time information is demanded�something more true today than in 1979. Such situations require a top-notch spokesperson who can command the respect and confidence of the media and the public, he says.\n\n�The best source of information is at the site,� Denton says. �Put credible sources on the firing line.�\n\nHFIR pauses for new reflector\n\nThe High Flux Isotope Reactor began its scheduled outage in October to replace its permanent beryllium reflector. It�s part of an ongoing upgrade program that will play a role, along with the Spallation Neutron Source, in making ORNL a center for neutron research.\n\nResearch Reactors Division staff have been planning the outage, which began Oct. 1, to replace the reflector. The operation is a normal maintenance activity that happens every 10 effective full-power years of operation. This will be the HFIR�s third.\n\nOver time, intense neutron bombardment degrades the beryllium, which may cause it to swell or crack. To replace the reflector, the reactor must be disassembled.\n\nRRD staff will also replace HFIR�s horizontal beam tubes during the outage. Some upgrades to the scientific capabilities for the neutron scattering facilities will be made as well.\n\nLast month several media outlets ran the news that ORNL�s sales of radioisotopes used for cancer treatments were up significantly. Those isotopes, which include californium-252, actinium-225 and tungsten-188/rhenium-188, are all produced at HFIR. Rocky Cline, who manages ORNL�s radioisotope distribution, says quantities of the isotopes are sufficiently stocked to last through the outage.\n\nThe reactor is also getting a new cooling tower to replace the original one, which was built in the 1960s.\n\nReported by Bill Cabage\n\nUT-Battelle honors 300+ at its first Awards Night\n\nThe first UT-Battelle Awards Night was held November 9.

As in the past, employee and retiree coverage will remain in effect unless you elect to make changes, except for flexible spending accounts, which require annual enrollment.\n\nDuring the November open enrollment, employees and retirees and surviving spouses under age 65 can elect to switch their medical plan coverage from one carrier to another and add eligible IRS dependents or add dental coverage with MetLife.\n\nThis year, in response to requests, an additional medical plan option is being offered to employees, retirees and surviving spouses under age 65. If the CIGNA Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plan is elected, you have the choice of obtaining medical care from any provider within the local network. You do not need referrals to see in-network specialists, and your care does not have to be coordinated by a primary care physician. The PPO Plan will be offered only if 100 or more participants enroll.\n\nDuring the November open enrollment Benefit Plans is also offering a new MetLife Long-Term Care Insurance benefit option priced at a large group rate to employees and retirees of any age. Long-Term Care is designed to protect employees, retirees, their spouses, their parents and in-laws from having to spend down their financial assets if nursing-home care or home care is needed.\n\nTwo other new options�offered to salaried employees only�are a significant revision in the Supplemental Life Insurance Program and the addition of Dependent Life Insurance coverage.\n\nTo learn more about the Long-Term Care Insurance benefits, plan to attend a Long-Term Care meeting at Benefit Plans at 104 Union Valley Road in Oak Ridge. Sessions are scheduled for November 14, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. or from 6 to 8 p.m., and for November 15, from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. Or call MetLife directly at 1-800-438-6381. OneCall staff do not have information on the Long-Term Care plan.\n\nHowever, for more information on open enrollment offerings, call OneCall, 574-1500 or 1-877-861-2255. Details on the open enrollment, new offerings and additional meetings on-site are also available on the Web at www.y12.doe.gov/benefits/wnew/OneCall.pdf as well as in a mailing to employees� and retirees� homes.\n\nLetters\n\nMetric vs. Imperial\n\nEditor,\n\nI have been amazed about the continued use of the parochial Imperial System in the Reporter, as for example in the report on this great graphite foam material from the Metals and Ceramics Division in the last issue.

Commuters feared the worst last February when plans began to come together to divert Oak Ridge city traffic down Scarboro Road for construction of a new interchange. Then Highway 95 commuters were downright horrified when they saw construction equipment staged beside the Charles Vanden Bulck Bridge, the ORR�s only alternate access route for the ORR from points south and west.\n\nCommuter traffic flow was going to be choked on either end by the by the dual construction projects�the Scarboro Road detour and the one-laning of the Highway 95 bridge.\n\nKnowing how the traffic light worked helped the flow.\n\n�It�s going to be a mess,� is how this writer was quoted in one of the local dailies.\n\nAs it turns out, delays occurred, including some glacially paced rush periods initially, but by and large they were manageable and wheels for the most part kept rolling. Much of that can be attributed to efforts by the contractors, Rogers Group and Midstate Construction, and the Tennessee Department of Transportation to establish and communicate alternate traffic arrangements.\n\nState and local officials, the contractors and members of the Lab Shift Superintendents office met at ORNL in April to discuss arrangements to keep traffic moving on Scarboro. LSS officers had earlier visited the Bulck bridge site for an explanation of how the traffic signals on the one-laned span operated.\n\nOnce commuters realized, with the help of some temporary traffic guides, that changing lanes too soon threw off the sensor plate that determined how long the green light held, delays on the bridge were reduced. Those sensors, as it turns out, hold the green for as long as traffic moves over them, up to a few minutes. About half the drivers changed lanes too soon and missed the sensor.\n\nOn the other end, TDOT and Rogers officials worked with DOE and city officials to make sure drivers were aware of the numerous route and traffic signal changes that were made to expedite traffic through the Scarboro Road detour.\n\nExcept for one memorable April afternoon when a trench blocked U.S. 62, and another morning after a storm knocked out the Bulck bridge signal, delays were kept to a relative minimum.\n\n�TDOT and the contractors deserve a lot of credit for working with us to help traffic keeping moving,� says the LSS� Steve Abercrombie. �Restricted traffic flow is a concern to us, both safety and security, besides being a hardship on the people who work here. Once TDOT and the contractors realized the magnitude of the flow of traffic going on and off the ORR at peak times, they were very quick to offer solutions and suggestions.�\n\nFor instance, at the Highway 95 bridge, signs advised drivers to stay right to hold the green light. The signal�s operation was also described in employee news channels such as ORNL Today.\n\nOver on the east side, the detour seldom delayed ORNL traffic to and from Knoxville, although Oak Ridge commuters often had more radio listening time. At any rate, TDOT officials maintained that the closing of Highway 62 for the project speeded the project along. At last word, Highway 62 could reopen at the end of this month.\n\nOr as one TDOT employee remarked at the April meeting with the LSS: �Just think of how nice that flyover�s going to be when they get it finished.��B.C.\n\nStrobes alert motorists that the Lab�s lights are red\n\nORNL is the major presence on Bethel Valley Road, which is otherwise a long stretch of two-lane blacktop through open country. Occasionally the Lab�s three traffic lights catch motorists by surprise.\n\nThose lights cycle red-yellow-green only at rush periods. The Lab�s Shift Superintendent�s office is arranging to install strobe lights on the traffic lights� red signals to make them more apparent to oncoming traffic.\n\nThe flashing lights, says the LSS�s Steve Abercrombie, should call drivers� attention to the signals. In the meantime, it�s always a good idea to look both ways before pulling out into a major roadway, even if you�ve got the green."
