        "text": "Oak Ridge Associated Universities has awarded competitive research grants totaling $175,000 to 35 junior faculty from its member institutions. The annual grants are made through the companyâ€™s Ralph E. Powe Junior Faculty Enhancement Awards program that provides funds to enrich the research and professional growth of young faculty.\n\nThe recipients, each of whom is in the first two years of a tenure track position, will receive $5,000 in â€œseed moneyâ€ for the 2015-2016 academic year to enhance their research during the early stages of their career. Each recipientâ€™s institution also matches the ORAU award with an additional $5,000, making the total prize worth $10,000 for each winner. Winners may use the grants to purchase equipment, continue research or travel to professional meetings and conferences.\n\nSince the programâ€™s inception, ORAU has awarded more than 590 grants totaling more than $2.7 million, a press release said. Including the matching funds from member institutions, ORAU has facilitated grants worth more than $5.2 million.\n\nâ€œORAU is delighted to add the 2015 class of 35 innovative early researcher scholars to the long-tradition of excellence exhibited by Powe Awardees,â€ said Arlene Garrison, ORAU vice president. â€œThe funding will enable broader exploration that is critical to building a highly successful research careers at ORAU member universities.â€\n\nThe awards recognize faculty members for their work in any of five science and technology disciplines: engineering or applied science; life sciences; mathematics and computer science; physical sciences; and policy, management or education.\n\nThe awards, now in their 25thÂ year, are named for Ralph E. Powe, who served as the ORAU councilor from Mississippi State University for 16 years. Powe participated in numerous committees and special projects during his tenure and was elected chair of ORAUâ€™s Council of Sponsoring Institutions prior to his death in 1996.\n\nRecipients of the Ralph E.
