        "text": "A native of Texas, James Moeser studied music at the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned the bachelor of music degree in 1961 and the master of music in 1964. He continued his education at the University of Michigan, graduating in 1967 with a doctorate in musical arts.\n\nMoeser's career in higher education began in 1966, when he accepted the position of assistant professor in the Department of Music and Dance at the University of Kansas. He became dean of the School of Fine Arts there in 1975 and served in that position for eleven years. He left Kansas in 1986 for Pennsylvania State University, where he became dean of the College of Arts and Architecture and executive director of the University Arts Services. In 1992, he moved to the University of South Carolina as vice president for academic affairs and provost. In 1996, he accepted the position of chancellor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. On 15 August 2000, James Moeser became the ninth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. As chancellor, his aim was to continue Michael Hooker's efforts to make Chapel Hill the leading public university in the nation.\n\nIn November 2000, less than a month after Chancellor Moeser's installation, North Carolina voters approved the Higher Education Bond Referendum. Out of $2.5 billion that the referendum made available to the University of North Carolina System, the Chapel Hill campus received $515 million to build, repair, and renovate facilities on campus. This work was badly needed due to years of deferred maintenance. Moeser pledged to triple this investment from the state with private funds raised through the Carolina First Campaign. In the end, the campaign's original $1.8 billion goal was exceeded, and $2.38 billion was raised. In addition to increasing the university's endowment, the money supported building projects, research initiatives, new endowed professorships, and scholarships. The combination of private giving and bond money allowed the university to implement several major elements of its master plan, including the Physical Science Complex, the Arts Common, and the renovation of Memorial Hall.\n\nMoeser and his administration undertook several initiatives to help serve the needs of students and the community. One of these was the Carolina Covenant scholarship program, created in 2004 to give qualified low-income students a chance to earn their college degrees debt-free. Since its inception, the program has been a model for roughly 80 other programs in the United States. Also in 2004, the university launched Carolina Connects to help build relationships between the university and the state. Moeser traveled throughout the state to meet and discuss with communities such issues as health, education, and the economy. A third initiative, and one very near the chancellor's heart, was to strengthen programs in the arts, particularly the performing arts. The university hired Emil Kang as its first director of the arts, and following the renovation of Memorial Hall, Kang launched an ambitious performing arts series that drew major artists from around the world.\n\nDuring Chancellor Moeser's tenure, the university was involved in several controversies; in each instance the chancellor responded by upholding free speech and academic freedom. The first occurred in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and concerned a teach-in led by members of the faculty and entitled \"Understanding the Attack on America: An Alternative View.\" There was a good deal of negative public reaction to reports of the teach-in, including some accusations that faculty were trying to justify the attack. Less than a year later, the selection of Michael Sells's Approaching the Qur'an for the 2002 summer reading program was the occasion for more public outcry against the university. Objections were also raised to the selection for the 2003 summer reading program; some political conservatives called Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed: On (not) Getting By in America a \"Marxist rant.\"\n\nAnother controversy, more internally focused, concerned the naming of the Cornelia Phillips Spencer Bell Award. The Bell Award was established in 1994 to recognize the contributions of women to the university and was named for Cornelia Phillips Spencer, who on 20 March 1875 rushed to the belfry of South Building and rang the bell to proclaim the news that the General Assembly had approved the reopening of the university. Spencer was a writer, a proponent of education for women, and the daughter and sister of long-time university professors. However, her legacy was increasingly called into question by 21st-century students, who pointed to the segregationist views expressed in some of her writings and to the fact that her family had owned slaves. Debate over Spencer's legacy led to a weekend-long symposium, \"Remembering Reconstruction,\" in October 2004 and to a general re-examination of the university's history. Chancellor Moeser supported this re-examination, saying on numerous occasions that he wanted the university's history told fully, \"warts and all.\"\n\nIn September 2007, in his annual State of the University address, Moeser announced that he was stepping down as chancellor on 30 June 2008 but had plans to return to the university as a faculty member in the Department on Music in 2009.\n\nBack to Top"
