        "text": "Oak Ridge Associated Universities\n\nSince 1946, students and faculty of The Catholic University of America have benefited from its membership in Oak Ridge Associated Universities, ORAU. ORAU is a consortium of over 100 colleges and universities and a contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy, DOE, located in Oak Ridge, Tenn. ORAU works with its member institutions to help their students and faculty gain access to federal research facilities throughout the country; to keep its members informed about opportunities for fellowship, scholarship, and research appointments; and to organize research alliances among its members.\n\nThrough the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, (ORISE), and The Research and University Partnerships Office, ORAU actively works with internal research staff, subject matter experts, and member universities to connect expertise with government and private sector organizations to create mutually-beneficial partnerships for innovation in scientific research and education. Through the university consortium and strategic partnerships, ORAU brings together university faculty and students to collaborate with ORAU experts on major scientific initiatives that strengthen America’s leading edge in science and technology. Many of these programs are especially designed to increase the number of underrepresented minority students pursuing degrees in science- and engineering-related disciplines. A comprehensive listing of these programs and other opportunities, their disciplines, and details on locations and benefits can be found in the ORISE Catalog of Education and Training Programs, which is available here, or from the contact below."
