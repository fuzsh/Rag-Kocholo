GCPS is proud to introduce Our Blueprint in Action â€”an initiative aimed at showcasing tangible instances of Our Blueprint priorities and the Portrait of a Graduate's core competencies occurring consistently across our district.\n\nEach month of the 2023-24 school year, we will spotlight one of our strategic priorities or Portrait competencies by sharing the stories of two clusters, highlighting their classrooms, notable events, community insights, achievements, community service projects, student organizations, volunteer efforts, and much more. We invite you to follow along our journey this school year as we continue implementing our strategic plan!"
