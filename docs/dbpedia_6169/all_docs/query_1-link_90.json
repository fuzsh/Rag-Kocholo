        "text": "Duke University and The Ohio State University are two really unique colleges where I am thinking about attending. These colleges both have what I am looking for in a University. Between these colleges, I think that the decision will be extremely tough. I love both schools’ locations, students, atmosphere, and competitiveness. These colleges have some similarities, but in many ways are complete opposites. Looking at all of the unique characteristics of Duke and Ohio State, I believe that this will be a tough choice.\n\nWhen I think of Duke University one word comes to mind, elitism. The total enrollment for undergraduates for this university is a little less than 7,000, which is a medium-sized campus. This is one factor that makes Duke extremely …show more content…\n\nOne that sticks out in my mind is that they are not a university known for football. Being involved in a football school all of my life, I have really enjoyed getting to tailgate and cheer for our boys. At Duke, they do have football, but the school is not all about it. Another negative of Duke is that students can only apply early by doing early decision. This is bad because with my ACT score, to get in I would need to apply early. This is a downfall because I am kind of undecided about which university I am going to attend. Also, I am not sure if I will receive enough scholarships and financial aid to help decrease the cost of this extremely expensive school. This university costs about $60,000 a year for their undergraduate program including room and board. Along with the cost, comes the distance.

They also have a spectacular medical school that I could attend after graduating. Ohio State is known for their medical school and also has many connections from doctors worldwide. This university is also a lot closer to home so it would be easier for me as well. The Ohio State University is about two hours away, which is a perfect distance to experience the full college life while still having the option to come home on the weekends. Ohio State is a lot cheaper than Duke as well. Their tuition is about $25,000. Also on the subject of tuition, nearly forty five percent of students graduate with no debt. The university is ranked sixteenth best public university in the nation and first in Ohio. Ohio State has an average ACT score of 28, not too off from mine. The university also has a perfect student to teacher ratio that is 19:1. OSU is number seven in studying abroad programs. This is another one of my favorite things about this university because I love traveling. Like Duke, Ohio State has many clubs and activities that students can get involved in. This may help when trying to make friends in such a large"
