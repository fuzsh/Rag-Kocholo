        "text": "Responsibility for the University's graduate programs and for research administration has, at times, resided in a single office and, at other times, in separate offices. Prior to 1965 and again from 1978 to 1989, the Dean of the Graduate School had responsibility for both research administration and graduate programs. From 1969 to 1989, the Dean also had vice chancellor status. In 1989, as a cost-saving measure, the vice-chancellorship was eliminated, while the deanship was retained in a position titled Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate School. Another position, titled Associate Provost and Dean of Research, was created to handle research administration. The latter was filled by Mary Sue Coleman in 1990. In 1992, Chancellor Paul Hardin recreated the vice-chancellorship as Vice Chancellor for Graduate Studies and Research and appointed Coleman to it. Dean of the Graduate School Henry Dearman then began reporting to Coleman. Upon Coleman's departure in 1993, Linda L. Spremulli became interim Vice Chancellor for Graduate Studies and Research. Campus administrators decided then to re-establish the dual role of vice chancellor and dean. Thus, when Thomas J. Meyer assumed the position on 1 July 1994, he was Vice Chancellor for Graduate Studies and Research and Dean of the Graduate School.\n\nResponsibility for the actual management of the Graduate School was assigned to a position titled Associate Vice Chancellor for Graduate Studies, to which Craig J. Calhoun was appointed on an acting basis, effective 1 September 1994. Calhoun was also to carry out a thorough review of the structure of the school and how it related to the rest of the campus. Calhoun produced a report that recommended making the deanship a separate position. He was then named interim Dean of the Graduate School while a search for a permanent dean was conducted. Effective 1 September 1996, Linda A. Dykstra became Dean of the Graduate School; she served until 2008.\n\nIn April 1996, Chancellor Michael Hooker implemented a campuswide administrative reorganization. The units within Graduate Studies and Research remained the same, but the title of Thomas J. Meyer's position changed from Vice Chancellor for Graduate Studies and Research to Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research. The Dean of the Graduate School still reported to him, but Meyer now reported to the Provost rather than the Chancellor.\n\nUnder Meyer's leadership, several new units were created within Graduate Studies and Research to assist in managing the University's research activities. Prior to 1 July 1994, when Meyer was appointed, the Office of Research Services (ORS) was responsible for most aspects of research administration. Concurrent with his appointment, two associate vice chancellor positions were created to take over some of ORS's previous responsibilities. Walter E. \"Skip\" Bollenbacher assumed the position of Associate Vice Chancellor (later Associate Vice Provost) for Research Development and was responsible for a number of special projects involving corporate partnerships. The position of Associate Vice Chancellor (later Associate Vice Provost) for Technology Development was not filled until 22 May 1995, when Francis J. Meyer assumed it. Francis Meyer headed the new Office of Technology Development, which took over the management of the University's efforts in patenting inventions and negotiating contracts to commercialize the products of faculty research. In 1996 and 1997 respectively, the Proposal Development Initiative (PDI) and Office of Information and Communications (OIC) were established. The Proposal Development Initiative assisted selected research teams in developing structural and funding strategies. The director of the PDI reported briefly to the Associate Vice Provost for Research Development, then directly to the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research. The Office of Information and Communications assumed responsibility for the GrantSource Library and research publications, which had been under the Office of Research Services. ORS remained responsible for the overall management of sponsored research and for contacts with federal agencies, sssurance of research integrity, and compliance with protocols.\n\nThomas J. Meyer resigned as Vice Provost in 1999. Dean of the Graduate School Linda L. Dykstra was then appointed interim Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research. She served in that capacity until 1 August 2001, when Tony G. Waldrop assumed the position of Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Studies. Effective 1 April 2003, Waldrop's title changed to Vice Chancellor for Research and Economic Development. At that time, the Dean of the Graduate School ceased reporting to him and began reporting to the Office of the Provost. After Waldrop left the University in 2010, Barbara Entwisle became interim Vice Chancellor for Research and Economic Development, beginning 1 August 2010. As of 25 March 2011, her appointment became permanent and her title changed to Vice Chancellor for Research.\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe records of the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research consist of files related to the organization and administration of the Graduate School and to the development and management of research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Materials include correspondence; reports; proposals; grant applications; agendas and meeting minutes; surveys; presentation slides; and publications that chiefly concern programming, funding and budgetary issues, faculty awards, graduate students, technology development, facilities planning, corporate partnerships, and collaborative research activities. Many of the files reflect the reorganization of responsibilities within Graduate Studies and Research, particularly in the area of research, where a number of the previous responsibilities of the Office of Research Services were assumed by new, separately established offices: the Office of Research Development, the Office of Technology Development, Office of Information and Communications, and the Proposal Development Initiative. There are also files on two other units that were administratively under the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research: the Institute for Research in Social Science and the Office of Economic Development.\n\nAlso included are files related to the involvement of the Vice Provost's office in campuswide issues and planning activities, including preparation of the overall University budget, government relations, establishment of new programs, and planning for a new science complex.\n\nFiles are chiefly those of Vice Chancellor/Vice Provost Thomas J. Meyer, 1994-1999. There are also a few files of Mary Sue Coleman as Vice Chancellor for Graduate Studies and Research, 1992-1993; Linda L. Spremulli as interim Vice Chancellor for Graduate Studies and Research, 1993-1994; and Linda A. Dykstra as interim Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research, 1999-2000.\n\nBack to Top"
