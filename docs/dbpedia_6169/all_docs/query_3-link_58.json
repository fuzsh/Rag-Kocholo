        "text": "Grants up to $4,000 available to Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) Consortium member universities\n\nORAU’s FY 2023 Innovation Partnerships Program (formerly Events Sponsorship Grant Program) is being restructured to build stronger relationships between university members and ORAU subject matter experts. These updates are designed to focus on research and education topics that align well with ORAU’s expertise and current priorities.\n\nApplications must be focused on one or more of the FY 2023 ORAU core focus areas.\n\nAn ORAU subject matter expert will serve as a collaborator with the university PI.\n\nThe goal of this grant program change is to drive new opportunities for university consortium members and ORAU experts to formulate meaningful collaborations.\n\nInnovation Partnerships grant applications are currently being accepted and the application window will remain open throughout the fiscal year depending on available funds.\n\nEach member university is limited to one award per fiscal year. Up to $4,000 may be requested to support an in-person or virtual event that involves participants from more than one ORAU member institution, including students. Innovation Partnership applications should focus on focused workshops/conferences that highlight your university’s strategic STEM research and education growth areas, and where collaborations with other member universities would add value. We are specifically interested in events that can bring more thought leadership in building a national strategy for STEM education and workforce development. Member universities are encouraged to collaborate around this topic in anticipation of federal funding initiatives."
