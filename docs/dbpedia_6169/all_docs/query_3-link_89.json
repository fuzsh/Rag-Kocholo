        "text": "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. - Joshua Dillon, a student at Purdue University, was selected by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as one of 20 outstanding research participants to attend the 57th Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates and Students in Lindau, Germany, from July 1-6.\n\nSince 1951, Nobel Laureates in chemistry, physics and physiology/medicine have annually convened in Lindau to conduct open and informal meetings with students and young researchers from around the world. This year’s event, which traditionally rotates by discipline each year, will focus on physiology and medicine.\n\nNSF’s participants will join 29 other students to represent the United States and more than 500 other international students at the meeting. The other students representing the United States are sponsored by Mars, Inc., the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU).\n\nDuring the meeting, the Laureates will lecture in the mornings on the topic of their choice related to physiology and medicine and participate in less formal small group discussions with the students in the afternoons and some evenings. The primary purpose of the meeting is to allow participants—most of whom are students—to benefit from informal interaction with the Nobel Prize winners. During lunches and dinners, Laureates will join participants at local restaurants for informal discussions. Various social events are also on the agenda to allow participants to meet other attendees from around the world.\n\nDillon is a 2005 graduate of Michigan Technological University. His research concentration at Purdue University is statistical machine learning.\n\nA Web site has been set up to post information while students are attending the meeting. Photos and a summary of events will be updated on the meeting’s Web site located at https://www.orau.org/lindau/.\n\nThe Web site and travel arrangements for all participants are being administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), which is managed by ORAU for DOE.\n\nORISE is a U.S. Department of Energy facility focusing on scientific initiatives to research health risks from occupational hazards, assess environmental cleanup, respond to radiation medical emergencies, support national security and emergency preparedness and educate the next generation of scientists. ORISE is managed by ORAU.\n\nAmy Viars\n\nCommunications Specialist\n\nOak Ridge Associated Universities\n\nOak Ridge Institute for Science and Education\n\n(865) 576-3490\n\namy.viars@orau.org\n\nTo the News Service home page\n\nIf you have trouble accessing this page because of a disability, please contact Purdue News Service at purduenews@purdue.edu."
