        "text": "Program Overview\n\nORISE connects the most talented and diverse college students, recent graduates, postdocs, and faculty to programs closely aligned with the interests of a variety of research facilities, including those managed for the U.S. Department of Energy and more than a dozen other federal agencies. These STEM internship and fellowship programs are key to the recruitment and preparation of the next generation of our nation’s scientific workforce.\n\nOpportunities can be searched via Zintellect, a searchable database of research and non-research internships and fellowships administered by ORISE and its managing contractor, ORAU. Opportunities are listed on Zintellect and aim to strengthen the scientific and technical workforce in areas of science, transfer knowledge and technology to the academic community, and support to the national commitment to science education.\n\nAt SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, a Department of Energy Laboratory lab operated by Stanford University in Menlo Park, CA, we offer summer research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in selected areas in STEM.\n\nResearch Opportunities\n\nDuring the Summer 2024, we will support four ORISE programs as described below.\n\nEERE Robotics Program\n\n(Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office)\n\nOpen to undergraduates, recent graduates and postgraduates\n\nMust be 18 years old at the start of the internship\n\nMust be a US citizen\n\nPursuing a degree in robotics, manufacturing, or engineering\n\nApplication deadline for students: January 9, 2024 at 3pm EST\n\nDuration: 10 consecutive weeks between May and September\n\nStipend: $700/week for undergraduates and $900/week for graduate students and postgraduates\n\nTravel and housing allowance\n\nFor more information:\n\nApply here: https://zintellect.com/opportunity/details/eere-robotics-2022ORISE\n\nORISE Programs: https://orise.orau.gov/internships-fellowships/index.html\n\nEERE Energy Storage Internships\n\nOpen to undergraduate and graduate students\n\nMust be 18 years old at the start of the internship\n\nDeadline for students: January 9, 2024, 3pm EST\n\nMust be a US citizen\n\nDuration: 10 consecutive weeks between May and September\n\nStipend: $600/week for undergraduates and $750/week for graduate Travel ($1,000) and housing ($150/week) allowance\n\nFor more information, please see: https://www.zintellect.com/Opportunity/Details/DOE-EERE-EnergyStorage-2022\n\nDuring their internship, each student works with an engineer or scientist on a project related to the Laboratory’s and ORISE’s mission. At the conclusion of the internship, the student will make a brief presentation to his peers and supervisors. Students may also participate in a series of scientific lectures, professional development workshops and lab tours.\n\nProgram participants must:\n\nComplete the full 10-week internship program. Internships are 40 hours/week, 10 weeks/summer.\n\nMust give a brief presentation of their summer project at the end of the internship.\n\nMust behave in a responsible and professional manner. Please review Stanford’s Code of Conduct and SLAC’s Respectful Workplace Policy.\n\nFor more information, please see:\n\nORISE Programs: https://orise.orau.gov/internships-fellowships/index.html\n\nFor additional information, contact:\n\nHillary Freeman\n\nSTEM Education Program Manager"
