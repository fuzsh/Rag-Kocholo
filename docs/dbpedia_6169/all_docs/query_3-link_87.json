        "text": "10:07 a.m., April 6, 2015--Cordell M. Overby, associate deputy provost for research and regulatory affairs at the University of Delaware, has been elected to the board of directors of the Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU).Â\n\nORAU is a consortium of 115 Ph.D.-granting universities from across the United States, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom that helps advance national priorities in science, education, security and health through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy.Â\n\nThe consortium awards research grants; promotes opportunities for collaboration among government, universities and private industry; and creates strategic partnerships for scientific research and education.\n\nAlso elected with Overby were Bruce E. Gnade from the University of Texas at Dallas; Dennis M. Kenneally, Maj. Gen. (ret.), Southwest Defense Alliance; Gina Lee-Glauser, Syracuse University; Juan M. Sanchez, University of Texas at Austin; Ric C. Trotta, National Advisory Council for the Federal Laboratory Consortium; and Caroline C. Whitacre, Ohio State University.\n\n“These new directors bring strong leadership and experience in diverse fields from defense to research to strategic consulting,” said Andy Page, ORAU president and CEO in a news release issued by the consortium. “Their insights in academe, government and business will be invaluable as we tackle challenges and explore new opportunities for ORAU.”\n\nUnder the auspices of the UD deputy provost for research and scholarship, Overby oversees and advances UD’s strong culture of compliance with federal, state and University policies and regulations across the spectrum of the University’s research-related activities.Â\n\nHe also is responsible for the review, negotiation and establishment of research agreements, and the administrative transfer of research materials to and from UD.Â\n\nOverby has a secondary faculty appointment as professor in the College of Engineering.\n\nPrior to joining UD, Overby had 18 years of industry experience in technical management and design engineering on programs funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Energy. He holds bachelor’s, master’s and doctor of science degrees in engineering from George Washington University.\n\nOverby also serves on the board of the Council on Governmental Relations, an association of 190 research universities and their affiliated academic medical centers and research institutions, which regularly, in collaboration with the Association of American Universities and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, provides analysis and feedback to the federal government regarding the effect of its research-related actions.Â\n\nHe has participated on a variety of committees for the National Council of University Research Administrators and the National Science Foundation.\n\nPhoto by Ambre Alexander Payne"
