        "text": "In two articles in December 2022 by Benita Albert for this \"Historically Speaking\" column, she wrote about Julia Hopper Daniel, who she described as “a historian, genealogist, archivist and an enchanting storyteller.” Before she retired, Julia, a college graduate, had used her business administration skills as an employee of the Oak Ridge Associated Universities and then worked at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and Technical Information.\n\nNow, Juila Hopper Daniel, is president of the Mayme Carmichael School Organization, founded in 2012. Its mission is to preserve African American history, promote education and work with Oliver Springs officials in developing and maintaining the new Carmichael Park. Julia’s latest mission, Benita wrote, was to open the Tri-County African American Cultural Museum in Oliver Springs. She has expressed gratitude for all the volunteers, co-founders, MCSO members, donors and government officials she has worked with to prepare the museum for its opening.\n\nAn ambitious project, the museum is still a work in progress. But on March 5, the museum finally opened. It represents African Americans in Anderson, Roane and Morgan counties (because Oliver Springs is in all three counties). Currently, it is open two days a week to the public, and the grand opening took place last Saturday, Aug. 3.\n\nCarolyn Krause visited the museum recently and heard stories about past and present African Americans featured in the museum’s showcases. Enjoy Carolyn’s insights.\n\n***\n\nWhen Carol Plasil and I arrived at the Tri-County African American Cultural Museum housed in a long building in the former Tri-County Mall on state Highway 61, we were greeted at the door by Adelin Weaver, a sixth-grader from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, who is volunteering at the museum while visiting her Great Aunt Ronolda Dooley during the summer. We were then greeted by Julia Hopper Daniel and Ronolda, Julia’s cousin, vice president of MCSO and an active museum contributor.\n\nJulia told us stories as we toured the 5,000-square-foot museum space, examining and photographing text and pictures in 17 showcases along one wall. The spacious room is dominated by a dozen or so round tables covered with white tablecloths; they will be used for banquets, family reunions, weddings and other gatherings.\n\nAn adjoining room contains archives for researchers interested in local African American history, including slavery, lynching and Jim Crow laws. The museum property was purchased from Beech Park Baptist Church.\n\nWe first learned about two women of great importance to the African Americans in Oliver Springs: Adeline Staples Crozier, an enslaved girl, and Mayme Carmichael, an inspirational elementary school teacher.\n\nMayme Elizbeth Carter Carmichael was a teacher at the Oliver Springs Colored School whose tenure there spanned from 1928 to 1966. Her husband, Frank Chalmers Carmichael, was employed by Southern Railway of Oliver Springs. As a graduate of the senior normal class, she received a permanent elementary teaching certificate and then completed two years of college.\n\nAdeline Staples Crozier was Julia and Ronolda’s great-great grandmother (Adelin Weaver is named after her). Julia lives on the farm where Adeline was brought as a 10-year-old enslaved girl to work on a plantation in Winters Gap, now called Oliver Springs.\n\nThe plantation land was purchased in 1855 by William Staples of Morgan County, who owned 38 enslaved African Americans in 1860. In 1861 when she was 16 years old, Adeline gave birth to her son, Jack Crozier, who got his surname from his father, Clark Crozier (who had Irish ancestors). Jack became a well-known farmer and sawmill owner; he and his sons cut down trees to clear land for the coal mining business. Julia is one of Jack’s 160 descendants.\n\nAccording to Benita, “Adeline remained in the Oliver Springs community until her death at age 84 in 1929. Adeline’s great-grandsons, William Julian Hopper Jr. and Benton Howard Hopper, purchased approximately 200 acres of the original Staples farmland in the late 1940s.”\n\nAdeline, who had been allowed to worship in the back of Fairview Church, became one of the charter members of Little Leaf Missionary Baptist Church in Oliver Springs.\n\nDuring the 2012 October Sky Festival in Oliver Springs, Benita wrote, Julia honored Adeline by portraying her, conducting tours and conveying the message that Adeline and her many descendants considered very important getting an “education, serving God and giving back to your community and country.”\n\nJulia’s early childhood home was a wood-framed antebellum house that was included in the Hopper purchase. The house is gone but on the land are eight family homes. The only remnants of the original plantation are a smokehouse and well house.\n\nJulia then showed us photos of the beloved elementary school teacher Mayme Carmichael (1908-82), who taught at the Oliver Springs Colored School, first established in 1879 as a log cabin and then moved to a larger one-room building. Most of her students were children of farmers, coal miners, loggers, sawmill operators, railroad workers and wash women.\n\nJulia told us that Miss Mayme, who taught three generations of African American students, inspired them to work hard and aim high – consider getting a college education and even advanced degrees. Julia told Benita, “Miss Mayme pushed her students to have a bulldog tenacity, to stick to any task until it was successfully completed.” Many of her students and their children have attended college and have become educators, counselors, engineers, physicians, chemists, lawyers, ministers and employees in professional positions in large organizations.\n\nSeveral years ago, a School Group Committee was established in an attempt to save the Mayme Carmichael school building and use it as a community center. That committee consisted of several former students of the Oliver Springs Colored School, including Mrs. Mary Louise Brooks.\n\n“Mary Louise has been a ‘Rosa Parks’ in fighting for justice to save the one-room schoolhouse and property and preserve it at Carmichael Park in Oliver Springs, now a historical landmark,” Julia said, expressing thanks to the committee, Omer Cox (former mayor of Oliver Springs), Becky Campbell, Beech Park Baptist Church and many other “unsung heroes.”\n\nOf Adeline Staples Crozier’s descendants, three prominent ones are in Julia’s extended family. For example, her grandson, Mark D. Daniel Jr., was featured in a story by Ben Sherry in the March 2024 edition of Inc. magazine. The article on Mark is headlined “What a Future-Focused Investor Looks for in Up-and-Coming Companies.” Mark is managing partner of the investment firm Digital. Here’s what Sherry wrote:\n\n“As a teen in Nashville, Mark Daniel routinely skipped going to parties, choosing to stay home and design computer apps while dreaming of starting his own business. In 2013, when he was selected for the $100,000 Thiel fellowship – and the chance to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom – he dropped out of Babson College and moved to San Francisco. There, he founded multiple tech start-ups.\n\n“Though they fizzled, they helped Daniel and friend Benjamin Milstein connect with hedge fund founder and current New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, who tasked them with running Digital, a $100 million investment firm that would fund entrepreneurs with bold ideas in the web3/metaverse space.”\n\nJulia then talked about the Boulware family, descendants of Walter and Laura Griffin, who was a granddaughter of Adeline Crozier. One of Walter and Laura’s children, Samretta Griffin Boulware Fritz (who was married to the Rev. Edgar Fritz), had five sons. One son, Dr. Alfred Larry Boulware, wrote a one-page article “The Will to Succeed,” which mentioned that his father was a coal miner and his mother was a maid who cleaned houses. Larry attended Miss Mayme’s School and then was bused an hour and a half to Campbell High School in Rockwood. Julia’s father was the first cousin of Samretta.\n\nJulia said that Larry was an outstanding student who earned a math and physics degree at Berea College and a master’s degree in physics at Brown University. Then he attended medical school at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where he met a student named Valerie, who he later married. He became a family physician and his wife, Dr. Valerie Boulware, has long been a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Their daughter, Dr. Leigh Ebony Boulware, is distinguished in the medical field.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, she is “an American general internist, physician-scientist and clinical epidemiologist. She is the dean of Wake Forest School of Medicine and chief science officer and vice chief academic officer of Advocate Health. Dr. Boulware formerly served as the Nanaline Duke Distinguished Professor of Medicine and director of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at the Duke University School of Medicine.”\n\nA graduate of Vassar College, where she was an award-winning athlete on the women’sbasketball and field hockey teams, she earned her medical degree at Duke University and her master’s degree in public health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Following her medical degree, Boulware completed her residency and fellowship at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nEbony Boulware is a nationally known researcher, educator and academic leader who has made fundamental contributions to improving the quality and equity of health care and outcomes for individuals and populations affected by chronic health conditions, including kidney disease and hypertension. A Duke University Medical School news release stated that “Dr. Boulware has been instrumental in accelerating the translation of research to clinical care, and she is a national leader in addressing the causes and effects of racial and ethnic health and health care inequities.”\n\nShe is an elected member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. You can hear her talk about her background and current job on a PBS video at https://www.pbs.org/video/dr-ebony-boulware-dean-wake-forest-school-of-medicine-yvsedy/.\n\n***\n\nThank you, Carolyn, for this introduction to the African American Cultural Museum located between Oak Ridge and Oliver Springs.\n\nNext in the two-part series: Julia Hopper Daniel and Ronolda Dooley talk about other African American achievers with roots in the Tri-County area who are showcased in the African American Cultural Museum.\n\nD. Ray Smith is the city of Oak Ridge historian. His \"Historically Speaking\" column is published weekly in The Oak Ridger."
