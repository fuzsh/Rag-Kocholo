        "text": "Paulette Diane Abee (Aaron)\n\nFollowing high school I went to the University of Tennessee and earned a B.S. degree and worked for Boeing in Huntsville for six months after graduation. I was a computer programmer for the Oak Ridge Associated Universities Medical Department (no longer in existence) from 1968 to 1972. I was a homemaker from 1972 to 1991, and I attended Pellissippi State Community College and earned an Associate’s Degree in Graphic Design. I worked as a graphic designer from 1994 to 2006 on a part-time basis.\n\nI am married to Roy and we have three children and two grandchildren. I fondly remember Mrs. Ledgerwood, Doc Combs, Ms. Frazier, and Mr. Shepherd as some of my favorite ORHS teachers. Some of my favorite high school memories include band (marching and concert—I played the flute), bridge during lunch in the Physics Room, and being on the Oak Log staff. My current interests include travel, reading, singing in church choir (where I am a librarian), working difficult jigsaw puzzles, and spending time with my two wonderful grandsons.\n\nVirginia Adams (Harrow)\n\nFollowing high school, Virginia attended the University of Tennessee. Upon graduation, she joined the Peace Corps and left on July 8, 1968, for Manila, Republic of the Philippines. Virginia returned to the United States on March 24, 1980, with her husband Doug and two children, Rob and Sharon. They lived in Atlanta, Georgia, for a year and a half and then moved to Huntington Beach, California. This was followed by moves to North Olmsted, Ohio; Palatine, Illinois; Nashville, Tennessee; Doraville, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee (again at Vanderbilt University); Atlanta, Georgia; and finally Stone Mountain, Georgia. Virginia says that the family is staying there until their retirement, when they have plans to move back to Oak Ridge—hopefully in the next five years or so. Virginia is working at Emory University and says she is very much enjoying her job there.\n\nRandy T. Agee\n\nFollowing high school, I attended college and earned a B.S. in Education, B.S. in Electrical Engineering, M.Ed in School Administration, and a D.Ed in Higher Education. I have been a teacher, principal, associate superintendent for technology (public school), supervisor on instructional technology (state), Electrical Engineering professor (private school), college dean (private school), and am now retired. I am married to Nancy and we have four children (two boys and two girls) and seven grandchildren.\n\nI remember Gene Moody, Bill Lewis, Ken Shipe and Coach Porter as some of my favorite high school teachers. My special memories of growing up in Oak Ridge and my high school days include most of my friends getting a motor scooter license at the age of 14 and riding the streets of Oak Ridge from dawn to dusk. I enjoyed my time as a life guard at the Municipal Pool. I also fondly remember being the manager for the ORHS basketball team of 1963 when we won the state championship. I remember the Blue Circle, Snow White, and Shoney’s gatherings— Wildcat Den sock hops—the Applesauce Regatta on the Clinch River—“cemesto” houses, and the Pine Valley Elementary School. My current interests and hobbies include computers, ham radios, electronic projects, and RV traveling. I am glad to be alive for this 50th Reunion. And I am blessed to still have my Mom, who lives in Oak Ridge.\n\nGustave J. Angele, Jr.\n\nFollowing high school, I attended the University of Tennessee at Knoxville from September 1964 through June of 1968 and graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I have worked in the Engineering field my entire working career. I am a registered Professional Engineer in Tennessee and Alabama. I worked for Alcoa in Maryville from 1969 through 1975. I then helped a man build a log cabin in Walland in the summer of 1976 while unemployed. Imagine me on the end of a 12-foot-long green pine log trying to carry it up stairs in the summer heat. My family and I moved to Jasper, Tennessee, in the fall of 1976 and have been there ever since. I worked in three different industries (Ferrosilicon manufacturing—ethanol and paper) over 37 years. I worked in the paper industry at what was Mead Containerboard for 26 years. The company was sold several times and changed names each time. We finally wound up as RockTenn Corporation when I retired in 2013. I am married to Jeannie Thomas Angele, who graduated from UT Knoxville in 1966 with a B.S. in Education. We have two children—Suzanne Elizabeth born in 1973 and John Thomas born in 1977. Neither of my children has married as yet. I remember Ms. Laycock who taught Math and came to one of our reunions. I also remember Mrs. Swain, who made everyone recite the stories of “Little Red Riding Hood” and “The Three Bears” in Spanish in front of the class. Currently, I am raising a small garden and like to go boating when I have a chance.\n\nRobert (Bob) R. Armstrong\n\nFollowing high school, I attended Tennessee Tech in Cookeville for a year and a quarter and then joined the Air Force in late 1965. I received an Associate's Degree in electronic communications equipment and systems from the Air Force and later took night classes at the University of Tennessee for two years. I retired from the Air Force in 1985 after working 20 years on Air Force electronic communications equipment and systems. After retiring from the Air Force, I spent one year as an electronic communications technician and 22 years as a U.S. Postal Service letter carrier. I am married to Sucha Armstrong, and we have three children and seven grandchildren. My special memories of our high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge include driving around Shoney’s, the Blue Circle, and the DaWabbit drive-ins; football games; the Wildcat Den and Shep Lauder; and the Oak Ridge swimming pool in the summers. I am currently an avid UT football and basketball fan.\n\nElla Pollyanna Arp (Hall)\n\nIt was so appropriate for Pollyanna to be born on the night before Christmas, for she was such a gift to all that knew and loved her. Born just shy of one year after her brother Bennie R. Arp (ORHS Class of ’63), she was the daughter of Bennie M. and Martha Arp. Pollyanna attended Tennessee Tech after graduation and eventually started her work career with Union Carbide. She would work at most of the facilities located in and around Oak Ridge. Her last employment was with the Material Controls Department at the K-25 Plant for Martin Marietta.\n\nPollyanna loved to travel—she took many trips both with family and friends. She loved to explore anywhere she could think of to go. She was able to create some incredible memories for herself, family, and friends by always pushing to discover new places, people, and things, which included trips all over the United States, Europe twice, and cruising the Caribbean. The only thing Pollyanna enjoyed more than traveling was meeting new people and developing friendships. One of her greatest assets was the friendship she gave to those who were lucky enough to receive it. This was only eclipsed by her love of family and her two sons, and the value of friendships is something that she would instill in her sons.\n\nPollyanna bravely fought a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease for almost three years. While she claimed victory over the disease at the end of 1990, she was suddenly faced with the reality of what it had taken from her. In her weakened state, she contracted pneumonia – which took her back to the hospital and six weeks later would take her life. She left many family members and friends devastated—but none more than her 18 and 16 year old sons. It has been almost 24 years since Pollyanna was taken from all of us way too soon. She never got to see her boys marry their beautiful wives nor experience those sweet, tender voices saying “Nana Polly” coming from her two beautiful granddaughters. However, Pollyanna still gives us joy through our fond memories that only she could have made. She lives on through the gift of love and those cherished memories shared by her sons and their families, extended families, and a host of beloved friends. We will always love you, Mom!\n\nWesley and Jason Hall\n\nLarry W. Babb\n\nFollowing high school, I remained in Oak Ridge for four years and married my “high school sweetheart,” classmate Susan E. Williams, in August 1966. Our son Michael was born in Oak Ridge in 1968 while I was attending the University of Tennessee. I transferred to Memphis State University, where I graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Science. Unilever hired me right out of the University, and our family moved to Greenville, South Carolina. I worked for Unilever five years in Greenville, where our daughter Amy was born. In 1974, the Andrew Jergens Company hired me and we moved back to Memphis. I have been in the Memphis/North Mississippi area since 1974, spending the last 24 years with the J. Strickland Company.\n\nSusan and I were married for 45 years. We lived a typical life with our two children mostly in the Memphis area. Susan was employed at the University of Memphis for almost 25 years. During her years there, she was recognized for numerous professional accomplishments include the award of the “voice of the tiger” award for outstanding contributions to the University. She was a member of several professional associations serving as president of the Memphis Area Professional Women’s Association and had the distinction of serving the longest tenure as President of the Staff/Faculty Senate for the University. She was devoted to the University and was deeply involved in the preparation for its 100th Anniversary when we lost her in August 2011. Her hobbies revolved mostly around her family. In what spare time she had, she became an accomplished tennis player and an avid participant in aerobics. Our memories of her are as a devoted mother to Michael and Amy, her love of her daughter-in-law Ann Marie and her son-in-law Derek Bailey, and the love and devotion she demonstrated every day to her grandchildren—Michael’s son jack, 19 and a sophomore at The University of Tennessee; Ellie, 16 and a junior at St. George Independent School in Cordova, TN; and our youngest, Amy’s daughter Brooke, who this year begins kindergarten in Franklin, TN.\n\nAs far as memories of Oak Ridge and ORHS, they were the best! …..sitting on the steps our junior year; State Champions in football, basketball, tennis, and track….; the Blue Circle; Brown’s; the ‘Da Wabbit; walking the railroad bridge at Elza Gate; riding around in “Kelly”; the “Skyway”; and the Wildcat Den….our innocence, our love for the city that had everything—unique in character and known worldwide for its accomplishments—the best school system in the South where teachers cared and friendships were formed that have lasted our lifetime. The city has changed, but I close my eyes and see the city of the 50s and 60s….the Oak Ridge, Tennessee—my HOME!\n\nJulia (Judy) Bailey\n\nFollowing high school, I worked that first summer at the First Presbyterian Church in Oak Ridge. Later, I attended Carson-Newman College. I worked for 45 years in Project controls/Project Management supporting DOE subcontractors. I retired in 2012 after serving as Project Manager at Y12. I have one son (46 years old) and one granddaughter (17 years old). My granddaughter graduated from ORHS in 2014, 50 years after out class! I remember Mrs. Norma Erickson and Mr. Walter Shipe as two of my favorite ORHS teachers. My fondest memories of my high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge were the special life-long friends I made, being a Penguin, our football and basketball games, and graduation! My current interests and hobbies are my granddaughter, traveling, reading, and volunteering.\n\nSarah (Sally) Bainbridge (Akridge)\n\nFollowing high school, I attended Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, from 1964 to 1968 and earned a Bachelor of Arts in Art/Art History. I kept “the home fires burning” while my husband served in Vietnam, U.S. Army, 1971 to 1972. Thank you, Chip, and my fellow classmates for your service. My career has been diverse—art teacher for K-12, advertising layout/design, homemaker, and manager.\n\nI am married to John (Chip) E. Akridge III—a Central high School Bobcat! We have three children (all married) and six grandchildren—but hoping for more!\n\nI remember Ms. Berkley (English) and Mr. Woodiel (Journalism) as two of my favorite ORHS teachers. Some of my special memories of my high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge would include Anna Cebrat singing “Ave Maria” in the Christmas Pageant, gathering around the flag pole as the death of our President John F. Kennedy was announced, being dropped off on Saturdays for SAT sessions, and cheering for Kenny Campbell to score goals for the Wildcat basketball team. Also, a 1964 May Sunday, Tom Mayberry cheered me on over the high jump on the ORHS field (I cleared 4 feet, but broke my left arm in half—but made graduation in time to give my speech on “to make the most of what we yet may spend.”) Curiosity was always valued in our Oak Ridge community—nerds, geeks—it was okay to be smart! In fact, that brought respect! I continue to aspire to be a nerd, pursuing my passions in a pretty broad spectrum. Bill Taylor once said, “All play and no work makes Sally a dull ….” Well, Bill, I hope I have proved you wrong! There is still so much to discover out there. P.S.: Lou Kovak—bring back my Crickets album!\n\nJanice Barker (Moody)\n\nFollowing high school, Janice attended the University of Tennessee majoring in Information Technology. She worked at all three facilities in Oak Ridge -- K-25, the Y-12 Weapons Plant, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in IT. She retired from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2008 after 40 years of service.\n\nNow she says she has the best job she has ever had. Janice and her husband Rex have two precious Havanese who have gone to the University of Tennessee Veterinary Teaching Hospital H.A.B.I.T. Program (Human and Animal Bond in Tennessee), and both are certified therapy dogs. She now takes them to a school/home for children that have had a really hard time through no fault of their own. These children are called the “Little’s” because they are between 5-12 years old. The “Little’s” read to the Havanese — Janice is now a Havanese chauffer.\n\nJanice and Rex have been married for 34 years. For over 22 years, she and Rex farmed 107 acres and had 70 head of cattle, two Tennessee Walking horses, cats, dogs, and chickens. They sold their farm and moved on Watts Bar Lake in 2002 where they enjoy boating, fishing, and gardening. Rex has a daughter (who Janice claims as her own) who lives in Ontario, Canada. Janice and Rex have two grandchildren, and both have graduated from college. Their granddaughter lives in Ontario, Canada; and their grandson lives in Canada's Yukon Territory — they travel to Canada a lot.\n\nBill Richard (B. R.) Blair\n\nFollowing high school, Bill attended Alabama School of Trades and became a machinist. He served in the U.S. Air Force as a Jet Aircraft Mechanic at the Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and Hahn Air Force Base in Germany. Bill spent his career as a journeyman tool and die maker and retired from Duracell Battery Company. Bill is married to Mary Charles Blair, and they have two sons and five granddaughters. Bill said that he remembers Mary Laycock and Charles Carnes as two of his favorite teachers. Now that Bill is retired, he says that he enjoys turning wooden bowls, bird hunting, fishing, and traveling with Mary Charles.\n\nDavid Bruce Blumkin\n\nFollowing high school, I attended the University of Tennessee and graduated with a B.S. degree in Zoology. Later, I graduated from Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas, with a M.S. in Building Administration in 1983. I completed the Air Force ROTC Program at UT and was commissioned as a 2nd LT on graduation in 1968. I served as a Bio-Medical Corps Officer as an Aerospace Physiologist and Academic Instructor teaching pilots and other flight crew members about the physiological effects of flight, use of life support equipment, and aviation human factors. The fun part of all this included participating in Altitude Chamber flights, Spatial Disorientation training, Para-sailing (and parachuting techniques), and ejection seat training. I also participated as a Hyperbaric Chamber crew member for four years. The challenging work was the personnel and organizational management duties that continued to increase over a 20-year career. I was assigned duty at Vance AFB, Oklahoma; Fairchild AFB, Washington; Sheppard AFB, Texas; Hickam AFB/Barbers Point NAS, Hawaii; and Shaw AFB, South Carolina. My retirement from the Air Force coincided with UND Aerospace at the University of North Dakota (UND) obtaining an altitude chamber and wanting to develop an Aerospace Physiology/Aviation Human Factors Program. I jumped at the chance and was hired as Project Director and as an Academic Instructor in the UND Aviation Degree Program and non-degree programs for international and corporate flight crews.\n\nAfter a total of 28 years in an enjoyable career (and my body telling me to stop going in the altitude chamber), I decided to take on something new—real estate sales. I am currently a Realtor® and partner in a real estate company in Grand Forks and enjoying the freedom of a flexible schedule. I am married to Linda Blumkin, and we have two children and one grandchild. In remembering favorite teaches at ORHS, I remember Dora Davidson. I took Advanced French II as a senior after having French I as a freshman—she told me it was not a good idea. But I got high grades and tested out of first year foreign language requirement at UT. Mary Frances Davidson tried to teach me Geometry and Algebra II—what she really taught me was to persevere and keep trying. I minored in Math at UT! Growing up in a school system that did not reflect many of the problems occurring in the nation in the 1960s was unique, as was the whole experience of growing up in Oak Ridge. I spent many years in recreational sailing and sail boat racing in Hawaii and North Dakota. I learned to curl and spent ten years curling in North Dakota. I also enjoy yard work (seasonal here in North Dakota), reading, and working back into photography.\n\nCraig Bundrant\n\nFollowing high school, I went to Kutztown University and graduated with a B.S. degree and did graduate studies at Penn State University. I taught high school World Cultures for ten years and was a college football coach for ten years at Ursinus College and Kutztown University. I also was sales and marketing manager for consumer products and a CPG consultant. I am married to Denise and we have two daughters and four grandchildren. I remember how special it was to be a part of the Oak Ridge community. I enjoyed my Boys’ Club experience, summers at the Oak Ridge pool, the Snow White Drive-In, and Cushman scooters. Currently, I enjoy traveling, wine collection, golf, and continuing to run my consulting business. I appreciate being included in this very special occasion and the chance once again to see my childhood friends.\n\nRobert (Bob) Talmage Cantrell Jr.\n\nFollowing high school, Bob attended college and seminary and became a United Methodist pastor. He received a B.A. in English from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and a Master of Divinity and Doctor of Ministry from Chandler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1972 Bob was a Chaplin Intern at Grady Medical Center in Atlanta. From 1972 to\n\n2010 he was a United Methodist pastor in the Holston Conference, including 6 years as a Senior Pastor of First United Methodist in Oak Ridge, his home church. Bob is married to Marie Wilson Cantrell, and they have two children and two grandchildren.\n\nBob says that he remembers Nancy Swain for Spanish, Mary Laycock for Math, Mazel Turner for English, and Sherman Sheppard (“Mr. Physics”) as some of his favorite ORHS teachers. He added that these teachers had a contagious enthusiasm for what they taught and were exceptional in making their subjects understandable and inviting. He said they encouraged and challenged him to learn. Bob had several great memories of our ORHS days and growing up in Oak Ridge:\n\nThe “Applesauce Regatta” on Melton Hill Lake—the inner-tube raft (“El Mata Siete”). Bob said that K. C. Jones, Bill Fort, and he built and paddled, went under, and didn’t make it to the finish line—but what fun they had—these were wonderful friends.\n\nDancing at parties and at “the Den” after ball games—especially the slow dances!\n\nWhile some teachers were superb teachers and related well to all the students, Bob said all his teachers seemed committed to give their best and expect the best of their students. Bob added that he is very grateful for each of them.\n\nFriday, November 22, 1963—Bob said that he remembers during gym that day Coach Nick Orlando announced that President Kennedy had been shot in Dallas and was reported to be dead. Two days later, he said, he watched Jack Ruby murder Lee Harvey Oswald on live TV.\n\nBob remembers building and flying model airplanes with Johnny Peed, Don Eiler, Tony Wylie, and Randy Peters—all wonderful friends of his.\n\nBob remembers neighborhood games and playground sports—hide and seek, kickball, “Kick the Can,” football, basketball, baseball and softball.\n\nBob said he enjoyed sports with his dad as well—pitching baseball in the front yard, watching TV sports, and (with Kenny Campbell and his dad) attending his first professional baseball game at a spring exhibition in Knoxville between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Milwaukee Braves—April 1, 1956—he said it was magic!\n\nBob also remembers the loving care and affirmation he received attending worship and Sunday school with his family and participating in the youth group and other activities at what was then the First Methodist Church (now First United Methodist).\n\nBob says that he discovered and enjoyed learning to play golf with Raymond Bogardus, Bill Fort, Chuck Tate, Gordon Cobb, and Ronny Henderson.\n\nBob also enjoyed Tennis Coach Ed Armstrong and his driving the tennis team to their matches—he pumped the gas pedal the whole way!\n\nBob currently works four days a week at the Keystone Adult Day Program at First United Methodist Church—he says it’s a challenge and a joy. Bob took a pilgrimage in the Holy Land in April 2013 and has since stayed in contact with the people and places there by selling Fair Trade Certified Organic Extra Virgin Palestinian olive Oil with a local nonprofit distributer. Bob also actively lifts weights and does cardio workouts and yoga. He also enjoys meditating and journaling. Bob said that he recently fell in love with jazz through WUOT-FM’s (NPR) “Improvisations,” deepening his appreciation of country, blues, gospel, classical, and good old “rock n’ roll” music. Bob still enjoys preaching and teaching occasionally. Bob and Marie also especially enjoy visiting with their children and grandchildren (ages 5 and 2)—and needing to enjoy much needed “R and R” after visits with the grandchildren!\n\nCarol Anne Carpenter (Ott)\n\nFollowing high school, I attended East Tennessee State University and the University of Tennessee in Knoxville prior to moving to Washington, D.C., in 1966. I spent the next 30 years as corporate art consultant with my late husband, Fred. Fred and I have one daughter and two grandchildren. My current interests and hobbies include beaded jewelry making and design, doing corporate art consulting part-time, and enjoying my three rescued dogs that take up a good amount of my time (but I wouldn’t have it any other way). After 45 years in D.C., it feels good to be back in Tennessee and close to family once more.\n\nGlenda Jean Carringer (Langenberg)\n\nFollowing high school, I attended Knoxville Business College for a one-year business course and then Roane State Community College for a two-year business course. I worked at the Clinton Courier-News in Clinton as a teletype operator where I typed the news and prepared ad displays. I worked for the newspaper until I married my husband Wayne in 1968. Wayne and I have three children, all graduates of ORHS. Mark was born in 1970 and is a doctor of internal medicine and pediatrics in Livingston, Tennessee. Mark and his wife Kathy (also a pediatrician) have five daughters, two of whom were born in China and adopted by Mark and Kathy. Our daughter Jodi was born in 1972, and she now has three children. Jodi taught for many years in the preschool program at First United Methodist Church of Oak Ridge and also in the Oak Ridge Early Head Start Program. Son Michael was born in 1975 and is currently the Executive Director of University Radiology (a large group of radiologists) in Knoxville. He and his wife Kristin Douglass have three children. Eleven grandchildren can keep us VERY busy.\n\nIn reflecting back on my favorite ORHS teachers and growing up in Oak Ridge, I first remember Mrs. Swayze—because I loved sports (and still do). I also remember my swim coach Bill Lewis and Mrs. Clary, my English teacher. I loved growing up in Oak Ridge—being a part of summer programs offered at the elementary schools, which gave me a chance to play softball, basketball, and tetherball. I loved going to the Oak Ridge Pool with friends, riding bikes, and playing outside until dark. It was fun to play outside and watch for the ice cream truck—something our grandchildren will not experience today. I think everyone felt safe growing up in Oak Ridge.\n\nMy current interests are, of course, my grandchildren. We babysit often; and the grandchildren currently play baseball, basketball, soccer, and volleyball. Wayne and I love to watch all of them play and attend most of their games. I also play golf in two leagues on Mondays and Thursdays. On weekends, I enjoy playing golf with my son Michael and his son Brandon—just being outside on a beautiful golf course is a fun day! I am also heavily involved in local politics. In 1984, I ran for a county-wide position on the Anderson County School Board; I was elected and served a four-year term. I ran again in 1988, was elected again, and served another four-year term until 1992. I decided not to run again in 1992; but, in 2007, the board member in my district resigned. The Anderson County Commission appointed me to complete that person’s term. In the Anderson County Election of 2008, I was unopposed and elected to the School Board seat to which I had been appointed in 2007. I ran again in 2012, was unopposed and reelected. I still serve on the Anderson County School Board. I am also active in my Sunday school class at Central Baptist Church in Oak Ridge. I am very thankful for my family and feel I have been blessed in life. My husband Wayne and I celebrated our 46th wedding anniversary in January 2014.\n\nAnd I would like to thank the members of the ORHS 50th Reunion Committee for their hard work and dedication to making this reunion a wonderful event for the Class of 1964. I look forward to seeing class members in September and sharing this special time together.\n\nRudy Carver\n\nFollowing high school I went into the Air Force. In the Air Force, I was a personnel supervisor. I spent 13 months loading aircraft in Southeast Asia. I also spent time at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina; Mactan Island, Philippines; Ent AFB, Colorado; and Bien Hoa, Vietnam. My last assignment was at the Air Force Academy, where I worked with families of prisoners of war and families of those missing in action.\n\nFollowing my military service, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Social Work from East Tennessee State University. I have worked with Christian counseling\n\nministries; Christian social work ministries; and, in 2000, I formed a not-for-profit ministry where I would take teams to mostly third world countries where we would work with orphans. I also have done disaster relief and taught in a seminary in Siberia and in churches in Eastern Europe, Central and South America, and Mexico. We have also worked in Russia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Cuba, Columbia, Venezuela, and Mexico.\n\nI am married to Elizabeth Shadoan “Ginger” Carver, and we have five grandchildren (including one from China and one from South Korea).\n\nMy special memories of my high school days include hanging out with Tommy Oden, Gary Joe Livesay, Ronnie Allison, Chuck Tate, Sammy Gaines, John Weaver, Mike Byrd, and Mike Lovell. A few of the things I remember about growing up in Oak Ridge were the pontoon bridge, armed guards at the gates, bomb drills, the great Oak Ridge Pool, the Grove Theater, the Wildcat Den, and Shoney’s. My current interests and hobbies include hiking, jogging, and traveling. I love God and my personal relationship with Jesus. I hate religion. I worship at a Calvary Chapel in Phoenix. I will be working with Muslims in Macedonia in April and May of this year and with people in the mountain villages of Honduras in July and August of this year.\n\nH. Richard Clark\n\nFollowing high school, I attended the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and later joined the Army, 1966 to 1969 (Vietnam veteran). After discharge from the Army, I worked at Union Carbide but took a leave of absence to complete my BS degree in Business Administration at UT. I also completed on year on my Master’s degree (College of Business Administration). I moved to northern Virginia in 1975 and worked for the Federal Government in D.C. (Department of Interior, Federal Energy Administration, and the Department of Energy). In 1979, I moved to California to work as a civilian for the U.S. Department of the Navy and later worked for Hughes Aircraft Company (yes, that Howard) and then Northrop Aircraft Corporation, which later became Northrop Grumman (and I am now retired from Northrop).\n\nI am single and have no children. My favorite classes at ORHS were math and PE. Growing up in Oak Ridge and going to Jefferson Junior High and ORHS, my special memories are of all my great classmates. I am currently an auto racing fan (especially NASCAR), love college football (of course, UT and the SEC), as well as the baseball NY Yankees and ORHS sports (especially football—Go Wildcats!). Although I will not be able to attend this year’s reunion, I wish all my ORHS Class of 1964 classmate’s good health and the very best of everything!\n\nAnne Cooper Abbatiello\n\nFollowing high school I left Oak Ridge and went to Atlantic City, New Jersey and worked two summers as a waitress in a motel that was on the same street as the now Trump Plaza. After that I came home, went to college for two years, worked as a dental assistant, and then for AAA Auto Company doing trip tics, and got married in 1966. I attended East Tennessee State University for those two years, took night classes at UT in Oak Ridge, and then attended classes at Roane State to get a two-year A.S. degree. I was a homemaker raising two children (a boy and a girl) and later went to work for the Oak Ridge school system as a teacher’s assistant and substitute. I am married to Leonard Anthony Abbatiello and we have the two children and two grandchildren.\n\nOne of my favorite ORHS teachers was Mr. Bill Lewis. I liked Mr. Bilbrey but didn’t get to take any of his classes. Some of the others I truly enjoyed were Mrs. Ledgerwood, Mr. Ousley, Ms. Jacoby, and Lloyd Waltenbarger (the last two were teachers I knew and worked with in later years). My special early memories of Oak Ridge included growing up in Woodland near Danny Pitts. Some of the fun times were when we used to go down to the creek between South Purdue and Quincy Avenues to find salamanders. Also, it was “big stuff” to go to the Skyway Drive-In to see a movie! We would walk one mile home from school up over North Western Avenue and stop in at the Woodland Drug Store and have a soda at the fountain.\n\nMy current interests and hobbies include belonging to and being an active member at St. Mary’s Church and two guilds there. I also like to toile paint, sew, knit, crochet, and spend time with my grandchildren—and sometimes cook and bake. I also enjoy being part of a group that work on activities that help other people who need help—like our class selecting the Emory Valley Center as a community project to celebrate our 50th Class Reunion.\n\nJeanne Culver (Thorpe)\n\nFollowing high school, I attended Tennessee Tech in Cookeville and earned a B.S. degree and a State of Tennessee Teacher’s Certificate. I later received the DOE training accreditation for performance-based training and the State of Tennessee Department of Health Hospital Technician certification. Since college, I have worked in the Oak Ridge Hospital Hematology Lab and Chemistry Department, the K-25 labs, ORNL RadCon Department and Technical\n\nResources and Training. At ORNL, I developed training for dosimetry and was a Rad Worker group leader for the Training Department. I also worked at the Y-12 Nuclear Security Complex as a program training manager. Later at Y-12, I was a Technical Resources and Training program leader and received a TRADE award—Development of ALARA for Design & Operations Engineers and SARA/OSHA Programs.\n\nI am married to Darryl R. Thorpe and we have one daughter and one grandson. I remember Martha Swayze and Mrs. Countess as being two of my favorite teachers. I hate to admit that most of my high school days were a blur to me. I was the new kid midway through my junior year and was not happy to be in Oak Ridge—I cried every day for a month. I missed the friends and boyfriend I had left at my other school. But my Mother let me drive to school, which I thought was very cool at the time. But I do remember Dan Pitts and David Pickens used to hide in the cabinets at school—used to drive Miss McCreary crazy! Also, I remember that Jimmy Cartledge asked me to the Junior Prom. I am now retired and love being “Grammy”—plus we have a new dog, “Jasper.” I am currently writing a genealogy book from the data I have collected for many years and have become the family historian. I think it’s pretty obvious that those of us who still remain will not die young.\n\nBoyd Thomas Davis\n\nFollowing high school I went to the University of Tennessee and graduated summa cum laude in 1968 with an accounting major and became a Certified Internal Auditor after passing tests and meeting professional standards. I also spent three years in active duty in Naval aviation, earning my NFO (or navigator) Wings and also serving as the Public Affairs Officer for the Naval Air Technical Training Command aboard Naval Air Station Memphis from 1969 to 1972. From 1974 to 1990, I served in the reserves as a navigator on the Lockheed P-3 Orion, a four-engine, turbo-prop patrol aircraft used in anti-submarine warfare. I retired from the reserves after 20 years of service as a Lieutenant Commander. I worked 38 years in the corporate world, primarily as an internal auditor (longest stint was 18 years at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California).\n\nIn 2006, I made a radical change to my working life by starting a general used book store in Canoga Park, California, called Next Chapter Books, which provides quality used books at affordable prices. I am married to Kathleen (Kate) and we have two sons, Bryan and Darren.\n\nI remember Coach Don Bordinger, Miss Baird, and Ms Benson as some of my favorite teachers. My special memories of high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge included being in the Boy Scouts and becoming an Eagle Scout (memorable and crazy camping trips in East Tennessee) and being a member of the First United Methodist Church and the Methodist Youth\n\nFellowship. I also enjoyed going to football games on Friday nights and still try to get home for Twilight Zone. I also remember TPing Gayle McCracken’s house late one night with my co-conspirator Jim Elrod. I also enjoy remembering my good friends who included Jim Elrod, Jim Keeton, K. C. Jones, Bob Cantrell, Gary Joe Livesay, Robert Brown, Mark Galloway, Jesse Copeland, and many others too numerous to mention. My current interests are bicycling; reading (what else would you expect from a book store owner); swimming; and, in times past, tennis.\n\nDonna David (Brown)\n\nFollowing high school, I went to work at the Life and Casualty Insurance Company in Nashville and worked in the Office of Reinsurance Department. I worked in an office environment until I married in 1966 and had my first child at the age of 19. I was a stay-at-home mom and homemaker and had my second child seven years later. Later, I managed a retail store for two years and then became a foster parent and homemaker again for five years. I am married to John Timothy Brown Jr. and we have three children, six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. I remember many special memories of my high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge. I remember going to both movie theaters every Saturday. Nancy Parker and I sat through South Pacific twice on Saturday. I also remember fondly memories of going to the Wildcat Den and the drive-in movie. I also recall a Sub-Deb dance at a hotel in Knoxville, driving around Shoney’s and talking to everyone and seeing who was with whom. My current interests include camping, boating, swimming, riding four-wheelers, going to soccer games, yard work, and reading. But hanging out with my grandchildren and dogs are my favorite activities now. I lost my husband in November of last year, and now my life is different. We were married 47 years. But my life goes on and I am doing the best I can to make a good life for myself. I have a full-time job as an office manager at a pest control company. I also have the best family a group of friends ever—I am truly blessed.\n\nHarold James (Jimmy) Davis\n\nFollowing high school, Jimmy attended The University of Tennessee at Martin on a football scholarship. Jimmy then went to work in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center as a Launch Control Center Facility Manager. He is married to Judy Davis, and they have four children and five grandchildren. Jimmy remembers Jack Armstrong and Don Bordinger as his favorite teachers at ORHS and commented that he had too many special memories of his high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge to mention--he loved all of them. Jimmy’s current interests are playing golf and being a member of different fraternal organizations.\n\nRichard Dawson\n\nAfter high school, I went to UT for two years, married my high school sweetheart Jennifer Frame (Class of ’65), and then took an all-expenses paid trip to Southeast Asia courtesy of Uncle Sam. I retired from a full career in the military in 1988. I served in the Army as a helicopter pilot that included a tour in Vietnam as a Cobra gunship pilot. I transferred to the Air Force and primarily flew B-52 bombers. My service included duty in Southeast Asia, Guam, the U.K., and Germany. Jennifer and I had three “military brats”—daughter Sydney, born at Ft. Rucker, Alabama; son Richard, born at March AFB, California; and son Taylor, born in an old converted Nazi S.S. hospital in Landsthul, Germany.\n\nI earned my B.S. in Labor and Industrial Relations in 1970 and did post graduate work in Aviation Safety and Management at March AFB, California; Squadron Officer School and Aircraft Commander Leadership courses also at March AFB; and Captains leadership training at Northwest Airlines in Eagan, Minnesota. After retiring from the military, I continued my flying and aviation career with Northwest Airlines in Eagan, Minnesota. It was a wonderful job that allowed our family to travel extensively. It was great fun to bid my trips to interesting and exotic locales and enjoy the many great “party” experiences with my fellow crew members and the many celebrities I met on my flights.\n\nI retired from Northwest in 2006 at the FAA-mandated pilot retirement age of 60. I also wore out two snow blowers while we lived in Minnesota. Jennifer and I have two grandchildren in addition to our three children. In reflecting on high school days, I remember enjoying Geometry from Mrs. Mars, History from Mr. Bogle, and English from Mrs. Turner.\n\nGrowing up in Oak Ridge was quite special and unlike any other town. I loved the summer playground programs, roaming the hills and camping out with my buddies. Playing football for Nick Orlando and basketball for Gerald Walker at Jefferson Junior High was an experience. I also remember being absolutely terrorized by Ms. Lyman in music class at Jefferson. I loved cruising on my Cushman Eagle, circling the Da Wabbit, Blue Circle, and Shoney’s. I fondly remember our proms, cafeteria socializing, and smoking on the hill (although that habit was given up 30 years ago). But most of all, I cherish the friendships I made that have lasted through the years. Since retirement,\n\nI have been able to indulge my hobbies and automotive and motorcycle interests by restoring my Cushman Eagle and Triumph motorcycles. The next project is the restoration of my ’58 Plymouth hardtop. Now that I no longer fly, I scratch my aviation itch by flying radio control aircraft.\n\nJennifer and I are involved in civic and community activities — she serves on the Keep Anderson County Beautiful board and I serve on the Anderson County Economic Development Board as well as the Green McAdoo Cultural Center Board. I have served two terms as Chair of the Anderson County Democratic Party and am currently serving as the 5th Senate District Committeeman for the State Democratic Party. I was also elected and served as a Tennessee delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\n\nSteward Edwards (Ed) Dismuke\n\nFollowing high school I earned a B.S. degree from Brown University and an M.D. degree from the University of Tennessee at Memphis (University of North Carolina). I am board certified in internal medicine, preventive medicine and cardiology, and clinical lipidology. In academic medicine, I was responsible for the education of doctors, medical research, and service—practice medicine and public health. I was a professor, department chair and dean. Now I am primarily interested in the health of entire communities, especially Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nI am married to Beverly Bollheimer Dismuke, and we have two daughters and two grandchildren ages one and four.\n\nTwo of my favorite ORHS teachers were Mr. Puckett, my sophomore chemistry teacher, and\n\nMrs. Smith, my advanced math teacher. I recall many wonderful times from growing up in Oak Ridge—my high school friends (Jack Mills, Robert Brown, and Eddie Holden) and their families — among my best friends. Oak Ridge was a special place—we had so many well educated people. It was a great place to learn science and be out of doors—East Tennessee and the Smokies are special. I can’t imagine a better place to prepare for “life.”\n\nI currently still working, but I am only doing what interests me—community health and overuse in medicine. I play tennis and exercise (climbing/hiking to Mt. LeConte on September 4, 2014). I also enjoy spending time with family and friends in Seattle, Tennessee, and Florida. My father, who passed away this year at age 93, suggested some quotes from Omar Kyham to me back during high school—“to make the most of what we yet may spend” was one—and what a great class motto that came from my wonderful father.\n\nWilliam (Bill) Blackwell Doughty\n\nFollowing high school I went to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and graduated with a B.A. in Public Administration. I also served in the U.S. Army, stationed at Ft. Devens, Massachusetts, and then Herzo Base in Herzogenaurach, Germany. I worked for the Federal Government primarily in Human Resources. I managed the Office of Personnel Management nationwide in the position of classification and compensation program at the end of my career. After retirement in 2006, I worked for six years as a human resources contractor for the National Park Service, LockheedMartin, Office of Personnel Management, and the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nI was married to Catherine Lee Doughty (now deceased), and we have two children and four grandsons — two located in Sacramento, California, and two in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nMy favorite ORHS teacher was Russell Kendall—Life Coach. I currently maintain a regular exercise program to stay healthy. I have enjoyed recent travels to Europe and Ireland with friends and look forward to more of these travels to come. Thanks to all of you who have worked so diligently to put our 50th reunion together.\n\nGerald Kirk Eddlemon\n\nFollowing high school, I worked part time at Tennelec, Inc., and Pulcir, Inc., while attending college. I received both a B.S. and M.S. degree in Zoology from The University of Tennessee, focusing on aquatic ecology, fishery biology, and did further course work in radionuclide transport, biometry, Russian, and a few other disciplines. After graduation, I worked as a member of the research staff in the Environmental Sciences Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I did research in trace contaminate transport and effects in aquatic ecosystems; environmental impact assessment of various energy technologies, including nuclear power, clean coal, geothermal; and environmental and occupational health compliance assessments for the U.S. DOE, DoD, FDA, and other federal agencies. I am married to Mikki and we have three children, two grandchildren, and one more on the way.\n\nI remember Don Anderson, Mabel Turner, Mrs. Mars, Mr. Puckett, a very sweet and lovely young math teacher (whose name I can’t recall and who died in a car accident), and the great track coach Ben Martin as some of my favorite ORHS teachers. I have many special memories of growing up in Oak Ridge and my ORHS days. While attending first grade in three different schools in three different cities, I lost an eye in a bow and arrow accident at the same time I was suffering from the measles, was hospitalized with pneumonia, and had a tonsillectomy. I missed so much school that my mother made me repeat first grade—now you know why I am almost a year older than most of you. I remember shopping with my Mother at the “five and dime” at Jackson Square. I remember riding the bus with Mother to the Ridge Theater at nine years of age to see Leslie Caron in “Lily”—I’ve had a crush on Mademoiselle Caron ever since! I played as an eight year-old in East Fork of Poplar Creek, one of the most infamous and polluted creeks in the world (radionuclides and mercury), right where it comes out of the Y-12 Plant—possibly accounting for my “glowing” personality.\n\nBoy Scout Troop 224 (Richard Lorenz, Scout Master) helped turn me into a lifelong fan of exploration, fast hiking, and the outdoors. I remember well also the lovely girls in elementary school, junior high, and high school—and me too excruciatingly shy to even engage a girl in conversation, much less actually ask one out on a date. I pretended to have no interest in girls; and, sadly, they must have believed it. I remember taking a box of Valentine chocolates to the lovely, brown-eyed, fuzzy sweater of baby blue-clad, fifth-grade classmate Linda Malone (and the first ever “love of my life,” although she never knew); and, then, almost before she could say “thank you,” running home very near the speed of light (not quite 186,000 miles per second)—and my feet never touched the ground! I know, I know…..that’s just supposed to be a poetic expression of youthful passion. But, oh yes—I can tell you, it’s absolutely true. I recall with complete perfection— my feet never—never touched the ground! I remember dissecting a fetal pig in biology class with one of my “secret” high school rushes, Linda Mann (she never knew either).\n\nI also remember running the 880-dash and two-mile relay for Coach Ben Martin and ORHS and being “banned for life” from Olympic competition for running in a non-AAU-sanctioned track meet (at least that’s what we were told, and it was easy to believe that of the self-serving AAU). My current interest are so many—church and family—grandchildren—to begin with. I am also a huge advocate for bicycling, walking, dancing, and other physical activities as healthful and “green” alternative to automobiles and television. I am an ultra-marathon cycler (long-distance bicycle racing and record attempts of hundreds and even thousands of miles). In 2010 at the age of 65, I won.\n\nJames A. (Jim) Elrod\n\nFollowing high school, I attended Carson-Newman and graduated in 1968 with a B.S. in Business Administration. This was followed by my service as an officer in the U.S. Army from 1968 to 1972. I served during the Vietnam era as a military intelligence officer. My work career included insurance, marketing, and consulting over the years. I am married to Mary Ann Elrod for 41 years, and we have two children and two grandchildren. I currently own an Internet-based business.\n\nMichael (Mike) Estep\n\nFollowing high school, I attended Tennessee Tech in Cookeville for two quarters. I then moved to Atlanta where I worked for Lockheed and got married in 1965. After coming back to the Oak Ridge area in 1966, I attended The University of Tennessee for a year and then went to work for the Department of Energy at the Y-12 Plant in the Engineering Department.\n\nI worked at the Y-12 Plant for 34 years, retiring at 55 in 2001. I am married to Linda Jo, and we have three children and seven grandchildren. In looking\n\nback at my ORHS days, I remember Mr. Moody and Mr. Puckett as two of my favorite teachers. My special memories of growing up in Oak Ridge were the great times spent with all my friends. Now that I’m retired, I enjoy hunting, fishing, and making fishing lures. Linda Jo and I live on Watts Bar Lake and do a lot of boating.\n\nHenry Feldman\n\nFollowing high school I attended Swarthmore College and worked summers for The Oak Ridger and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I also served two years as an officer in the Public Health Service. I earned my Ph.D. in applied math from Harvard in 1975. Since college, I have done research and taught statistical methods in medicine and public health—15 years at Harvard School of Public Health, 11 years at the New England Research Institutes, and 13 years at Boston Children’s Hospital. I am married to Judy Feldman; we have three sons, three daughters-in-law, and four grandchildren.\n\nI remember Ruth Baird and Dale Woodiel as my favorite teachers in English at ORHS. One of these teachers was older (40 at least!), one younger (barely older than us), and both loved their subject and were able to “wink” at the rules. For math, Mary Laycock was my favorite teacher. Now, whenever I am teaching, I try to channel her talent for explaining things to the reluctant.\n\nWhen remembering special memories of our high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge, it is just impossible to pick one or two—there were so many. Oak Ridge did well by its young people. As for my current interests or hobbies, I still play the trumpet—worse than ever. I am looking forward eagerly to this 50th reunion event. I extend many thanks to the organizers for their work.\n\nLynda Flynn (May)\n\nFollowing high school Lynda attended the University of Tennessee and graduated with a B.S. in Microbiology. After graduation from UT, she worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory on research, in Phoenix for Phoenix Health, and the Medical College of Virginia. Lynda is married to John May (ORHS Class of 1963) and they have two children and two grandchildren. Lynda said she remembers her favorite ORHS teacher being Mrs. Laycock. Lynda said that her current interest is traveling, often in a 1967 Austin Healey 300.\n\nDiane Fogle Willis\n\nAfter high school I was the secretary at Glenwood Baptist Church in Oak Ridge; a stenographer at the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge; Dispatcher and later Deputy Sheriff in Polk County, Florida (first female deputy); and staff member of the Polk County School Board, Migrant Department, Polk County, Florida. I also have past military service—U.S. Army Reserve Military Police, Tampa, Florida. My education beyond high school included graduating from Knoxville Business College and the Polk Community College Police Academy.\n\nI am currently a homemaker and caregiver for my husband. I married my husband Ray S. Willis in 1982.\n\nSome of my favorite teachers at ORHS were Mr. Shipe, Mrs. Struxness, Mr. Bogle, Mrs. Buckminster, Mrs. Mullenax, and Mr. Lipscomb. In reflecting on my special memories of my high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge, I love that I lived in such a wonderful town with its special place in history. We had teachers who cared about us, and our school system was far advanced above others in the state. On the other hand, I am pretty sure the woods across from Elm Grove Elementary (where we kids were taken for drills) were not where we needed to be in case the Russians attacked. It seems funny now; but, at the time, it didn’t make me feel safe. I remember wearing dog tags and trips to the Elm Grove Drug Store for roast beef sandwiches and ice cream—and shopping in Jackson Square and the daffodil man!\n\nCurrently, I volunteer at a nearby nursing home and will be teaching the 6-year-old class at Vacation Bible School. My favorite hobby is collecting Christmas decorations and subsequently decorating with them. Up until this last year, I put up 13 Christmas trees (yes, somewhere along the way I lost control). My husband and I have recently started growing pineapples, and we are looking forward to the first harvest. I love to watch sports and am a big VOL fan. I fly the VOL flag on game day (even though I am surrounded by Gators). My husband says my hobby is shopping—and I also like going to yard/estate sales—along with being a news junkie. When my husband was able, we traveled extensively and went to many of his Navy reunions. Our favorite trips were cruises. I have not been back to Oak Ridge since 1996, and I am especially looking forward to my next visit and the reunion. Even though I have lived in Bartow, Florida, since 1971, Oak Ridge is always in my heart and is my home.\n\nMark Galloway\n\nFollowing high school, Mark attended Law School at Wake Forest and was the Clerk to the North Carolina Supreme Court, a country lawyer, and a judge since 2004. Mark is married to Maxine, and they have three children and three grandchildren between them. Mark said that his special memories of ORHS days and growing up in Oak Ridge included playing for the Wildcats and against Steve Spurrier and Bob Johnson. He also remembers folk music groups singing at Shinliver School in Clinton and ORHS hootenannies and feeling pretty good about test scores “until everyone I knew was 99.3 percentile or better.” More recently, Mark says that he is enjoying playing guitar (Beetles, Bach, and show tunes) along with the banjo and mandolin (bluegrass and old time music). He said in closing that he is looking forward to seeing as many people as he can at the reunion.\n\nFrederic W. Guymon\n\nI was born in Kansas City, January 19, 1946, 11:15 pm, but only lived there 18 months. I guess that makes me a Capricorn/Aquarius, right on the cusp. We moved to St. Joseph, MO when my dad, Ralph Herbert GUYMON, took a new job. My mother is Helen Marie (BAKER) Guymon. My dad's parents lived in Kansas City, MO, and my mother's parents lived in several small towns around Kansas City, MO, and they died while living in Harrisonville, MO.\n\nWe moved to St. Joseph, Mo. when I was 18 months old. We had a house out near some warehouses that my dad worked at. My dad used to go 'frogging' near there. There was a wood pile that I played on until one day I picked up a snake, thinking it was a pretty piece of wood. I remember laying in a field, near a lake, watching fire works on the Fourth of July. We then moved into town. The school there was huge, at least to me it was. I think I remember going to the bottom of our street, and getting on a city bus to go to Vacation Bible School. I was no older than six at the time. Times have changed, haven't they?\n\nIn June, 1953, we moved to Oak Ridge, TN when my dad took a job with Union Carbide, well after the Manhattan Project. He was a Nuclear Engineer working on developing Reactor Designs and Maintenance Planning until he retired.\n\nOak Ridge was a great town to grow up in. It was, and still is, a small but very cosmopolitan town of about 30,000 people. It had a mountain river, the Clinch River, running around the town's East, South, and West sides until the Tennessee Valley Authority decided to build a dam on the river. Then Oak Ridge had a small lake that wound around it, that we all used for skiing and fishing.\n\nOak Ridge is nestled between the Cumberland Plateau and the Smokey Mountains Ranges, about 20 miles from Knoxville. There are mountains, rivers, creeks, lakes, caves, and parks all over East Tennessee. We took advantage of as many of them as we could.\n\nI attended the Oak Ridge High School, Class of 1964, ORHS Alumni. I attended Virginia Polytechnical Institute Fall Quarter of 1964, Corps of Cadets Rat Class of 1968. I then transferred to the University of Tennessee, in Knoxville. After receiving my Draft Board Physical, I joined the US ARMY in September of 1965. Basic training at Fort Jackson, SC, and then AIT, Communications Center Specialist (Teletype) at Fort Gordon, GA. I then received orders to go to the Far East.\n\nWhen I got to Oakland, CA, I thought I was going to Viet Nam. When I was finally given orders, however, I was sent to Camp Page, Korea instead, 226th Signal Company in Chun Chon, Korea. I returned to the USA after 14 months in Korea, To Fort McClellan, Anniston, AL. It was one of the WAC training centers at the time. I was the 16th noncom assigned to a Teletype Radio Station that served as backup for the normal land-line teletype CommCenter. We were falling all over ourselves, because it only took two people to run the station. Six months seemed like six years because we had nothing to do.\n\nI was then transferred to Fort Bragg near Fayettville, NC. Now I was busy. Six months there went by in no time. We were erecting new steel buildings, and we had riot training on a regular basis. Fort Bragg was one of the centers that sent troops out during the riots that were spawned after Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated. None of us wanted to go, but we served anyway. We also had some fun (?). Our company was used for volunteers (like in the Army volunteers) to provide enemy agents for the Ranger training that went on at the post. I hear that they did not like our guys capturing some of the Ranger guys.\n\nI received an early release from the Army to return to the University of Tennessee. I worked at Union Carbide, in Oak Ridge, during a Summer session, and found out EEs did for a living. It was okay, but not what I expected. While in school, I worked part time at the local Radio Shack. I decided that I needed a break from school so applied for full-time work at Union Carbide. I guess I got used to the steady income, and felt I needed to get on with life, because I did not go back to school.\n\nUnion Carbide offered me a full time job, at the same time that Radio Shack offered me a store to manage. Radio Shack was kind of squirrelly. They would not tell me when or where I would be. I chose Union Carbide. While there, I met and married my wife, Shirley PHILLIPS, and had two great kids, neither of which, came with an instruction book. I also discovered my true calling. I loved to program computers. I do ponder my decision of not finishing my EE degree, but those are the choices we make.\n\nI worked at Union Carbide as a Designer, developing the construction drawings for a bunch of projects, some of which I am not allowed to talk about even today. Then, satisfied that I was going nowhere, fast, in the company, I accepted an offer to work for Fluor Engineering in Houston, Texas.\n\nWe moved to Houston in May of 1981, and I have been with them ever since. Since that time, we changed our name to Fluor Daniel. My official job was the same, Design, but I started writing computer programs on my own time to support our Engineering efforts on projects. Finally, I moved from Engineering into the Information Systems group where I still work today. We have been 'Down Sized', 'Right Sized', 'Outsourced', 'In Sourced', and now we are forming our own Company, Fluor Signature Services, who will supply outsource services to Fluor Daniel and other companies. A new adventure to enjoy.\n\nI will likely review this history, and make some modifications to it as time goes.\n\nFred passed away January 5, 2004.\n\nElizabeth (Betsy) (Grisard)\n\nFollowing high school, I made two unsuccessful attempts to attend ETSU. In 1966, I decided to get into computers at Tennessee College of Automation in Knoxville. I did not have a “formal” education beyond high school except various and sundry classes for job requirements and continuing education. My career involved computers; and, I have to say, computers were a lot more fun when things were just starting out back in the late 60s and 70s. I worked for Joe Clayton Motors in Knoxville, Shop Rite Foods in Texas, Whitney and Hibernia National Banks in New Orleans, and EDS and IBM in Colorado. I retired from IBM in 2010. Oh—I was married and divorced in Texas. Unfortunately, I have to admit that most of my high school days were a big blur. But my special memories of growing up in Oak Ridge include my love for going to the big swimming pool in the summer (and how I hit my head on the bottom of the diving board when I tried to do a flip—never tried that again—so embarrassing). I also wish I had paid more attention to dance lessons at Ethyl Howell Dance Studio. I also remember finding some bootleg liquor with some friends in the graveyard, splitting it up with them, and then trying to keep our parents from finding out. I also remember not having to lock the doors! Currently, I am a stage actor and also training in voice-over. Since I’ve retired, I am able to spend time doing whatever interests me. Although I am not a great cook, I have been taking cooking classes. I am also taking some painting and camera classes and continue to look for more interesting stuff to do — plus I still act when I can find a role.\n\nBarbara Gritzner (Dodge)\n\nFollowing high school I attended the University of Tennessee and earned a B.S. degree. I then worked as an administrative assistant at Y-12 for a few years, then became a homemaker and mother when my daughters Karen and Kristi were born. I later became an administrative assistant in the Oak Ridge school system at Robertsville Junior High for ten years followed by being a teacher’s assistant for seven years at Robertsville Middle School.\n\nI am married to William (Bill) Dodge, and we have two daughters (Karen Wilson and Kristi Younkin), three grandchildren (Grace, Kate, and David Wilson), and two step-grandchildren (Will and Brendan Dodge).\n\nI remember my favorite teachers from the Oak Ridge High School as being Mrs. Ledgerwood, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Countess, Mr. Fowler, and Mr. Bilbrey. I also have many fond memories of our high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge. I may have been the only elementary school student in Oak Ridge to drive a car to school! My father built a little electric car that even had headlights. When I was in the 6th grade at Elm Grove School, I drove that car to school a couple of times, parking it in the parking spaces behind the gymnasium close to the cafeteria building. At the end of the school day, I drove the car back home. Even when I was a student in high school, that same little car was a big hit with the boys at parties held at my house. Another special memory I have of growing up in Oak Ridge was my “unique” playhouse. In 1956, my father heard that the guardhouses used to guard the entrances to Oak Ridge during the war years up to 1949 were going to be hauled away. He somehow managed to have one of those guardhouses towed to our house on California Avenue and placed in our back yard. I currently enjoy playing tennis, playing the clarinet in the Oak Ridge Community Band, and being responsible for publicity for the Community Band concerts.\n\nI am a member of the National Fitness Club and a volunteer worker at the Oak Ridge Public Library. I also enjoy traveling and camping, hiking, riding my bicycle, and reading. I am so very lucky to have my three grandchildren living in Oak Ridge and see a great deal of them, attending their numerous activities. I have also been giving my grandchildren piano lessons for several years. In November 2013, I was interviewed about what it was like growing up in Oak Ridge during the 1950s and 1960s by Keith Daniels, who is working for the Center for Oak Ridge Oral History. This interview (video, audio, and transcription) can be seen online at www.orpl.org. Both my daughters are graduates of Oak Ridge High School as well. My daughter Karen (Class of 1990) has taught kindergarten in the Oak Ridge school system for a number of years and is presently a full-time mother; her husband Brian is a physical education teacher and football coach at Jefferson Middle School. My daughter Kristi (Class of 1993), along with her husband John Busch, is living in Germany where she is in the U.S. Air Force stationed at Ramstein AFB and a clarinetist with the United States Air Force Band of Europe.\n\nRandy Lee Haese\n\nFollowing high school, I attended college and earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in Physics. My work career in Oak Ridge was at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (as a physicist and systems specialist) and SAIC (systems specialist). I am married to my wife Judy, and we have two children and four grandchildren.\n\nI remember both of the Davidsons and Mrs. Laycock as my favorite ORHS teachers. One of my special memories of high school days was competing with the bridge club.\n\nNancy Neal Harmon (Krantz)\n\nFollowing high school, I went to the University of Tennessee for four years and received a B.S. in Education. I married in 1968 and have lived in Texas since that time. After moving to Texas, I earned my Master’s Degree in Education from the University of Houston. In Houston, I taught 6th, 7th, and 8th grade math from 1968 to 1970, 1974 to 1982, and 1984 to 1997. I taught 7th grade math in Emory, Texas, from 1997 to 2003. During the year 1993, I also taught math in Germany to U.S. military men and women. I retired in 2003. I am married to Gordon H. Krantz and we have two children, Robert and Catherine, and three grandchildren.\n\nMy favorite ORHS teachers were Steve “Doc” Combs (band) and Miss Mary Frances Davidson (math). Growing up in Oak Ridge, I think that I got a very good education going through the Oak Ridge school system K through 12 grades. Growing up there was very unique since Oak Ridge was built as a government city in the 1940s. Currently, I enjoy playing bridge, being active in my church and taking part in my grandchildren’s activities. My husband Gordon and I own an RV and a mobile home park on Lake Fork, which takes up some of my time as well.\n\nGloria Henderson (Woodall)\n\nAfter high school, I completed two years at MTSC, Murfreesboro, and then transferred to UTK in the fall of 1966. During the summer of 1965, I worked at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and in the summer of 1966 in the Metals and Ceramics Lab there. That’s where I met Doug Woodall, an Auburn co-op student. We married in April 1967 and moved to Auburn, Alabama, for Doug’s senior year. Doug attended Glenwood Elementary School and Jefferson Junior High School, but he graduated from high school in California (class of 1963). We returned to East Tennessee in 1968, where Doug began his career at the Y-12 Plant. I took up gardening, sewing, Bible studies, and raising our German shepherd pup. We hiked or backpacked often (with Fritz) in our beloved Smoky Mountains. In 1971, Doug joined the Navy and, until 1975, we lived in northern California; Doug taught at the Nuclear Power School and I spend my days bicycling around Napa Valley, working in our church office, making new friends, and commuting to Sonoma State College. We got involved in a wonderful church, fell in love with Yosemite, and adopted our first child, Becky. In 1975, we returned to Anderson County, settling in the Claxton Community. We adopted two more children (John from Ecuador and Matt from Manila). We added a foster daughter in 1987, giving us a full house!\n\nI returned to college in 1988 and graduated from UTK in 1990 with a B.S. in Social Work. I worked in child-abuse prevention and elder car for several years and then stayed home full time with our active teenagers.\n\nGrowing up in Oak Ridge, I remember our days were teeming with playmates and outdoor fun. Our duplex sat at the foot of a steep lane—in a wooded area. I joined in rock fights, cowboys and Indians (with pistols, bows and arrows), climbing trees, and marble games in our dirt yard. Dad created a tepee one summer with saplings and bed sheets. We kids sailed down our lane on bikes, homemade go-carts, wagons, and even an ironing board with skate wheels. We played “rolly bats,” kickball, and “swing-the-statue;” we drew pictures all over the street with broken pieces of sheet rock. We ended most days with hide ‘n seek under the street light. I loved St. Mary’s School (grades 1 through 8). I learned respect for God and for my teachers. I felt appreciated, worked hard on school work, loved the classroom “spelling bees,” and “recess” on the monkey bars. I remember my ORHS by the atmosphere, my teachers, the expectations, and my friends— all very nurturing. I remember student assemblies (especially musical performances), “hootenannies,” Friday night football, pre- and post-game parties, Masquers’ plays, Oak Ridge Playhouse, school dances/proms, lunchtime and sitting in the hallways afterward, and hanging out with friends. My favorite teachers were Mrs. Catherine Ledgerwood (junior “core class,” a combined English/Social Studies course. Mrs. Ledgerwood’s enthusiasm prompted me to pay attention enough to pass History! Miss Mazel Turner, Senior English, was strict—but I learned how to write an essay! Mrs. Swain—Spanish I and II-made foreign language fun! “En boca cerrada, no entre mosca”! These days, Dough and I enjoy travel, church activities, good books, long walks and old movies. Our three children and five grandchildren live in the area—so we are spoiled. I feel blessed to “see” this 50th year reunion and thank all who worked so hard to “round us up”!\n\nCarolyn M. Hinds (Van Der Weele)\n\nFollowing high school, I attended the University of Tennessee for a year, UT Continuing Education for another year, and then Montgomery College in Maryland for two years. I worked for a short time for John Harrison Realty as a rental manager, Fairchild Industries as an administrative assistant, and for 15 years for ComSat as the Administrator-Office/Building Services. I retired from the University of Maryland/Montgomery County as a program assistant.\n\nI am married to William (Bill) Van Der Weele and we have two sons, four grandsons and one granddaughter, and one great-grandson Aiden (born 12/17/2013).\n\nIn looking back at my high school days, my favorite teachers were Coach Ira Green, Mary Francis Davidson, and Mr. Fowler. My current interests and hobbies are first and foremost our grandkids and our “great” along with domestic and foreign travels and adventures. We are huge ice hockey fans—our grandson Tyler raised $4,200 for the “Make a Wish Foundation” through his hockey play. Bill and I have season tickets to the Washington Capitals games, travel as much as we can, and play golf. I am looking forward to finally making a reunion this year. My brother now lives back in Oak Ridge, and Bill and I are looking forward to side trips to the Smoky Mountains, Dollywood, and UT.\n\nElizabeth Hodnett (Addison)\n\nFollowing high school, I received AB (Latin for BA) degree at Transylvania College in Lexington, Kentucky, and later worked two summers in the solid State Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (where my major accomplishment was the typing of a three-page equation, expressing the third-order elastic constant of germanium) and then edited scientific research in the Biology Division until just before my first son was born. When my second son was two years old, I commuted to Knoxville for my MA at UT (in English—not Physics or Biology!); moved to Durham to get a Ph.D. at Duke; then worked as a writer; and later English professor at WCU in Cullowhee, North Carolina, where I had my daughter and third son. I retired last year and moved to Asheville, where I live at Crowfields with my second husband, Jim Addison. I have twin grandsons whose father died in 2012, just before their 11th birthday. At ORHS, I liked almost all of my teachers; but I had special fondness for Mrs. Laycock, Mrs. Swasey, Miss Frazier, Mr. Bogle, Miss Baird, and Mr. Puckett (“but this is under what circumstances does this happen though?”). I enjoyed Mr. Lewis in Masquers, as well as Mr. Hamby, who taught us to make flats for scenery. My special memories of my ORHS days include football games, especially selling concessions and going on a bus to out-of-town games; Masquers’ productions; Mr. Woodiel’s journalism room where we worked on the literary magazine and fraternized with the Oak Leaf staff; playing cards in the corridor between classes; filing out of the school to watch the flag lowered when President Kennedy was shot; observing a class at Scarboro School as part of Future Teachers of America; many summer days at the pool; and “getting Vitamin D from the sun” in Mrs. Smith’s JJHS gym classes. Because so many talented people gathered from all over the world, Oak Ridge was a fabulous place to group up and, after college, start a family. My current interests and hobbies include writing, research on Emerson and other American romantics, reading and book discussions, including one called The Girls of the Atomic City (which taught me much about the early history of Oak Ridge). I enjoy Tai Chi, walking, and a group called Autumn Players that goes monthly into nearby assisted living facilities to read poetry aloud. I like to watch Duke basketball and British mysteries.\n\nLaura Anne Hoffman\n\nAfter high school, I went to college and, to a certain extent, became a professional student. I took a year off from undergraduate school to grow up, which I did working at Loveman’s. When I returned to school, I basically never left—even through my 25-year career with the Nashville Fire Department.\n\nI graduated from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville with a BA and a MA in English and attended additional graduate school at Peabody College of Vanderbilt University (ABD), a B.S. in Fire Protection Engineering from Tennessee State University, and professional schools in fire service and law enforcement. For my career work, I taught college English for ten years, all the time getting frustrated with prospects for the future. As a result, I quit that and went to engineering school (Thank You—ORHS and Oak Ridge in our day for the solid education). In 1978, the Nashville Fire Department started hiring women; and, that being something I had always wanted to do, I applied, passed all the tests, and had the engineering degree the department wanted. I was one of the first three women on the department—and I never looked back. I was assigned to investigations and retired in 2003 as Captain.\n\nI served on the National Fire Protection Association’s Safety to Life Committee and taught fire science within the fire service and at Volunteer State Community College (VSCC). After retirement, I also taught English at VSCC until my retirement from teaching in 2013.\n\nWhen I married my wife MaryAnn Jackman, I inherited her 5 adult “kids” and 12 grandchildren. I chose career and cats over having children of my own, but I dearly love the great two legged ones I acquired late in life.\n\nMy favorite ORHS teachers were Frau Peed, German; Ms. Sweet, English; and Margaret Gotshall, P.E. Growing up in Oak Ridge, we were the earliest “Boomers,” children of the “Greatest Generation” and heirs to a city that had the best schools in the country. I think we had tremendous pressures to succeed. Currently, my interests and hobbies include tutoring college students, herding cats, working for people with Parkinson’s disease through writing and support groups, and ongoing work with Holy Name Catholic Church in my inner-city neighborhood.\n\nPaul E. (Eddie) Holden\n\nFollowing high school, I attended The University of Tennessee and graduated. I also spent four years in the U.S. Air Force. After graduating from UT, I went to work for Yellow Freight and retired from that company in 2004. On my return to the Knoxville/Oak Ridge area, I went to work for the Department of Energy in Oak Ridge and plan to retire again at the end of 2014. I am married to my wife Carol, and we have two daughters and three grandchildren. I remember Mr. Smith (Math) as one of my favorite teachers. My special memories of our high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge include the great athletic teams and activities at the Wildcat Den. My current interests include golf, fishing, and traveling.\n\nDouglas (Doug) B. Janney Jr.\n\nFollowing high school, I attended the University of Tennessee and earned my degree in Architecture in 1969 (a five-year degree). I have had a 45-year, nonstop career as an architect until my recent retirement. My career included both private architectural practice as well as architectural management for nationally-based A/E firms. I engaged in projects locally, regionally, and nationwide providing me with a career of continued interest and satisfaction. I have enjoyed participation in a number of “hometown” civic organizations:\n\n18 years on the City of Oak Ridge Industrial Development Board\n\n15 years on the City of Oak Ridge Board of Zoning Appeals\n\n10 years on the Board of Directors for the Oak Ridge community Art Center\n\n10 years on the American Heart Association Anderson County Board of Directors\n\nI am married to Betty Bradham Janney (Class of 1966), and we have three children (all ORHS graduates) and seven grandchildren. I remember Irvin Grossman, Powell Puckett, and Gene Moody as some of my favorite ORHS teachers. In looking back at special memories of my high school days or growing up in Oak Ridge, I remember that I had the very good fortune to have been raised among friends, parents, and teachers from highly diverse backgrounds that formed such a closely knit community. I am now retired and working on 45 years of “saved-up” projects—occasional architectural consulting projects, genealogy and associated research and travel, photography and film-making efforts involving physical fitness to “wear out vs. rust away,” and staying engaged with children and grandchildren (ages 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10). I would never have thought back 50 years ago that I would have a wife and three children (all ORHS grads too) — it has been good!\n\nJanet Lynn Jarrett (Creel)\n\nFollowing high school, Janet married and had two children. Sometime later, she divorced, went back to school studying financial accounting at Eastern Florida State College, and went to work as a Financial Accountant at the Kennedy Space Center (21 years) and as an Administrative IT for an L3 DoD contractor for six years. Janet remarried 15 years after her divorce and successfully raised her children. She retired in 2006. Janet and her husband Harold have five children and seven grandchildren together. Janet says that she had a wonderful childhood growing up in Oak Ridge with her “besties,” Janice and Nancy.\n\nDenise Jorgensen (Keith)\n\nAfter high school Denise worked at two places in Oak Ridge—the Alexander Motor Inn (desk) and the K-25 (now Enrichment) Federal Credit Union until her retirement. Denise was also a housewife and mother of two. Denise has a son, J. David; a daughter, Robyn; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.\n\nDenise said that she remembers Mr. Bogle being her favorite ORHS teacher. Currently, her interests and hobbies include working with the Lions Club and serving on the ORHS Class of 1964 50th Reunion Planning Committee. Denise commented that it was a huge thrill for her to watch her two children graduate from ORHS—now her grandchildren are at ORHS. She also said she has enjoyed working with the committee planning our 50th reunion.\n\nJohn Russell (Russ) Kendall\n\nFollowing high school, Russ attended the University of Kentucky and later earned a degree in Accounting from the University of Tennessee. From 1966 to 1970, Russ completed military service with the Army Security Agency. For the next 32 years, Russ was an Auditor and then Audit Director for the Naval Audit Service. Russ is married to Mary, and they have three children and six grandchildren.\n\nIn reflecting on some of his favorite teachers at ORHS, Russ says that Mrs. Buckminster, Mr. Moody, and Mr. Shepard were most memorable. His special memories of his high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge include summer time, golf, and swimming at the Oak Ridge Golf and Country Club with Kenny, Terry and Janice. Russ says that golf, woodworking and singing are his current interests and hobbies. Russ sends his many thanks to the committee for putting this special reunion together.\n\nPatrice Ann Kile\n\nFollowing high school, I went to college and received a B.S. degree in Chemistry at Our Lady of Cincinnati/Edgecliff (now part of Xavier). My favorite job was in the Chemistry Department of Proctor & Gamble in Cincinnati.\n\nJohn Knowles\n\nFollowing high school John attended Michigan State University in East Lansing Michigan from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a B.A. in Math and a B.Mus. in Music Theory, followed by a Ph.D. in Musicology in 1984 from Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. John entered the Army and attended Army Intelligence training from 1968 to 1971 in Munich, Germany. From 1982 to 1986, he worked in administration at Elderhostel, Inc. From 1986 to 2013, he did technical writing for various companies—Digital, Nuance Communications, et al.)--off and on and taught college music, humanities, and writing at Brandeis, Boston University, Daniel Webster College, and Franklin Pierce University.\n\nJohn is married to Mary Ann and they have a son, Michael, and daughter-in-law Sonya. John remembers Mrs. Laycock (math), Mr. Smith (German), and Mrs. Ledgerwood being some of his favorite teachers. In reflecting on special memories of our ORHS days and growing up in Oak Ridge, John says he remembers his theater work—Masquers, Oak Ridge Playhouse (“Bye, Bye Birdie”), student players, 1,000 Suns, and chorus and music theory with Doc Combs. John’s current interests are politics and music history. John has served his community by working on the town budget committee, school board, being a library trustee, and other work. He served as a House of Representatives member from 2006 to 2100 in New Hampshire. He is currently editing a Beethoven sketchbook for Beethoven-Haus in Bonn, Germany.\n\nLinda Faye Knowles (Houston)\n\nFollowing high school Linda attended the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. Her work career included working at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information Extension, Oak Ridge; the Veterans Administration Regional Office at Roanoke, VA; a period of being a stay-at-home mom; Assistant Librarian at North Cross Prep School (for 24 years); and then retiring in 2010. Linda married Dr. Charles Aiken Houston (divorced 2008), and they have two daughters— Heather Bligh Houston (1976), B.S., M.BA., James Madison University and works at Booze Allen Hamilton in Atlanta, and Laura Ashley Houston Hardaway (1979), B.S., the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (married to Ben Hardaway from Greenville, SC, and living in Herndon, VA). Linda has two beautiful grand-daughters—Lilly Grace Hardaway (4) and Houston Kathryn Hardaway (1).\n\nLinda remembers Doc Combs, Mrs. Norma Erickson, and Martha Swasey as three of her favorite teachers. Her special memories from her ORHS days are of the ORHS Band and Sub-Debs. Her current interests and hobbies include working with the Junior League of Roanoke Valley and her church, Second Presbyterian Church. She also enjoys reading, needlepoint, “amateur decorating” and, of course, her darling granddaughters. Linda commented that she really appreciates the reunion planning committee for their hard work.\n\nMary Kuhaida (Lowery)\n\nI have had an awesome life over the past 50 years—living in several different cities and areas of the country, meeting wonderful people, and having the chance to work in a variety of fields—all using the skills and knowledge learned at Oak Ridge High School. I currently work at the Department of Energy in Oak Ridge as Office Manager for the Planning and Budget Division and have no plans to retire any time soon. My husband Eugene and I have been happily married for 23 years and are the proud “parents” of Maggie, Emily and Milo, our three canine babies. My son Matthew and my granddaughter Mackenzie Kathryn (my namesake) live in Newark, Delaware; and I try to visit them as often as possible. The first 18 years of my life were wonderful too! I absolutely loved growing up in Oak Ridge with my brother Jerry and sister Carol Sue. I still love to catch lightning bugs! My siblings and I spent a lot of time running the neighborhood and feeling safe doing it. We had a village of parents looking out for us and dearly loved them all. As much as I love to travel, I have become quite a homebody who truly loves hanging around at home with the dogs—cooking and reading. My husband and I love going for walks at Norris or Frozen Head and fishing. Just spending time in good old East Tennessee is a refreshing blessing.\n\nRobert (Bob) H. Lafferty, III\n\nFollowing high school, I immediately spent nine weeks at Camp Buck Toms teaching nature. I then went to college at Miami University, where I majored in Anthropology and received my B.A. degree in 1967. During those summers, I was on various field crews doing archeology—mostly in East Tennessee. My military service included Officer Candidate School at Fort Belvoir in combat engineering and served in Viet Nam from 1968 to 1970. I went back to college and received a M.A. degree in 1973 and a Ph.D. in 1977 in Anthropology from Southern Illinois University. From 1976 to 1979, I was an archeologist at the Office of Archaeological Research in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. From 1979 to 1983, I was an archeologist at the Arkansas Archeological Survey in Fayetteville, Arkansas. From 1983 to 2012, my wife and I owned Mid-Continental Research Associates, Inc., a cultural resource management firm.\n\nI am married to Kathleen Hess Lafferty and we have two daughters (Emily and Sophia) and one granddaughter (Lilah). I remember Mrs. Catherine Ledgerwood and Mr. Harmon Fowler as two of my favorite ORHS teachers. I currently enjoy gem faceting, reading, volunteering at the Walton Art Center, and traveling.\n\nPatricia (Pat) Jane Lawson (Terry)\n\nFollowing high school Pat worked as an office temp and a babysitter to earn money to attend college. Jane graduated from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. Pat said that her husband was a Federal Government employee and, therefore, they moved a lot. Pat said she has lived and worked in Virginia, Maryland, Kansas, and Nebraska. In between all the work and moving, Pat and her husband Ralph had two daughters; both are college graduates. Although Pat and Ralph have the two daughters, they are still waiting on grandchildren.\n\nPat said that she remembers Norma Erickson as one of her favorite ORHS teachers — Mrs.Erickson taught business classes. Pat remembers Mrs. Erickson for her warm smile and friendliness. She also remembers Mrs. Swayze, one of our Physical Education teachers, for her encouragement and love of dance. Pat said that in reflecting back on special memories of our high school days and growing up in Oak ridge, she remembers trips to the Smokies and camping out, roller skating down the city’s hilly streets, cheering on the Wildcats in football and basketball, and working concessions at football games.\n\nNow that Pat and Ralph are retired, she said she enjoys gardening, gourmet cooking, being outdoors, and attending sporting events. She said she supports and takes part in causes concerning wildlife habitat and natural resources conservation. Pat added that she thinks she was very fortunate to grow up in a town like Oak Ridge that celebrates diversity, education, and the arts.\n\nWilliam Michael (Mickey) Ledbetter\n\nFollowing high school I went to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and earned a B.S. degree in Accounting as well as spending a brief stint in Nashville. I was in the U.S. Army from 1969 to 1971. I worked as a CPA in Charlotte, North Carolina for Ernst and Ernst; Controller/Treasurer for Textile Industry; finally Controller/Treasurer of a company that distributed and published religious/love-oriented materials before I retired. I still hold CAP certificates in both Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\nI am married to Pamela Longaker Ledbetter (ORHS Class of 1967), and we have four children and five grandchildren. I remember Doc Combs as one of my favorite ORHS teachers. My special memories of my high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge include the enjoyment of our ORHS band and its members.\n\nMichael S. Loop\n\nFollowing high school Mike attended Florida State University and earned a B.S. in Psychology in 1968, an M.S. in Psychology in 1971, and a Ph.D. in Psychobiology in 1972. Mike has been on the standard track for a university faculty staffer, mostly at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Optometry, where he teaches visual perception and is a “card-carrying” visual psychophysicist.\n\nMike is married to Trudy Frey Loop, and they have four children and two grandchildren. Mike says that some of his special memories of high school days or growing up in Oak Ridge were “adventures of a sawed-off sportsman.” Mike’s current interests outside of his work field are fishing and plants (in-door and out), and he says he still chases snakes but has recently specialized in turning road kill into hat bands. Mike comments that “he has seen things you people wouldn’t believe (or at least you should have been there)!”\n\nCheryl Loudermilk (Kear)\n\nFollowing high school Cheryl took some college courses, went to work, and then got married. Cheryl worked at Oak Ridge Associated Universities in Oak Ridge, then moved to the Atlanta area and lived there for eight years and had two children. She then moved back to Oak Ridge and went to work for Lockheed Martin as a Contract Administrator. Cheryl took early retirement from Lockheed Martin, got her realtor’s license, and sold real estate for several years. Cheryl currently keeps her grandchildren two days a week and works part time in a real estate office three days a week. She and her husband John have two children (a son and a daughter) and also have two grandchildren (a grandson and a granddaughter).\n\nCheryl fondly remembers Mrs. Erickson and Mrs. Mullinex as her favorite ORHS teachers.\n\nShe comments that some of her special memories of high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge were “riding around on Saturday nights, circling Da Wabbit and Shoney’s—everyone chipping in money (usually 25 or 50 cents each to put gas in the car)—slumber parties, and all the fun we had in high school.” Cheryl goes on to comment that “Growing up in Oak Ridge, our lives were so different from that of kids today. In the summer, we would leave the house in the morning to go play with our friends in the neighborhood and come back at dark. We made our own fun jumping rope, playing hide and seek, and never worrying about the dangers that children have today.” Today, Cheryl enjoys sewing, photography, writing, and traveling.\n\nMichael Wayne Lovett\n\nFollowing high school Mike graduated with a B.S. degree from Carson-Newman College. For 10 years, he served as the Physical Director of the Boys Club of Knoxville. He later worked as a Salesman for the JFG Coffee Company for 20 years and then did missionary work for three years in Jos, Nigeria, West Africa. He currently serves as the Director of Baptist Churches in Grangeville, Idaho, and State Director (Utah/Idaho) for the Baptist Disaster Relief organization.\n\nMike is married to Mary, and they have one child—Michelle. In remembering a favorite teacher at ORHS, Mike commented that he got in more trouble with Mr. Puckett than any other teacher. His current interests include hiking, golf, and church ministries.\n\nJoseph Allen Mackley\n\nFollowing high school Joe attended Carson-Newman and earned a B.S. degree in mathematics. He went to Quincy, Florida, after graduation and taught math for almost four years. Joe then returned to Tennessee and took graduate studies courses in math and he also studied to be a gemologist at the Gemological Institute of America, certified as a gemologist from the American Gem Society, and became a master gemologist appraiser from the American Society of Appraisers. Joe owned and operated his own gem business but later sold the business to his son. He currently does appraisals for his son for both gems and antiques. Joe says that he is not looking to retire at this point because he says he thoroughly enjoys what he does. Besides, he said he could not make a living during his brief career as a lion tamer.\n\nJoe is married to Suzanne Mackley and they have two grown sons—one a gemologist/jeweler with Mackley Jewelers and the other an engineer with Computational Systems, Inc. Each of Joe’s sons is married, and they have given Joe and Suzanne four grandchildren—all local.\n\nJoe reflected that Doc Combs was probably his favorite ORHS teacher, and he enjoyed being in the band and playing outside as a child until dark. Joe’s current interests are antiquing with his wife, getting together with friends for dinner parties, and living his faith. Joe also reminisced about traveling on a western states vacation back when CBs were popular—his CB handle was “Joe Cool.” After hiking to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and back up one day, he was extremely tired that night and dreamed of nothing but saguaro cactus surrounding him. Thereafter, Joe’s CB handle became “Cactus Joe”—which has stuck as his nickname.\n\nTeackle (Teak) Wallis Martin Jr.\n\nFollowing high school, I went to Rhodes College in Memphis from 1964 to 1968, earning my B.S. Degree in Biology, and later attended the University of Chicago Medical School from 1968 to 1972, where I earned my M.D. accreditation. I practiced internal medicine at the Rush Medical School/Presbyterian-\n\nSt. Luke’s in Chicago from 1972 to 1975. Since 1975, I have practiced internal medicine in Mt. Vernon/Sedro-Wolley, Washington, at the Stragit Regional Clinics. I have been married to Anne for 38 years, and we have three children and three grandchildren. I remember my favorite ORHS teachers as being Mrs. Ledgerwood and Mr. Brown. My special memories of our high school days and growing up in Oak Ridge include the wonderful friends and teachers that helped me set my goals, hanging out with friends in Jim King’s (deceased) basement, and all the scouting activities that led to a lifetime of outdoor activities. I am an avid hiker; and, in the fall of 2003, I walked 500 miles on the Camino de Santiago across Spain. I also love boating and kayaking and have been a ham radio operator since junior high (now WB7OTL).\n\nEdith Jean Mate (Hummel)\n\nFollowing high school, I attended St. Mary’s School of Nursing for a year and Draughons Business College for a year and a half. After that, I got married and my husband and I moved to St. Louis, Missouri. I worked at Jasper Beachburn as a receptionist and later at Monsanto as a billing clerk. In 1976, my family and I moved back to Oak Ridge; and I worked for Joyce, Anderson and Meredith (attorneys). After raising two children and learning to live alone, I went back to work at the Y12 Plant as an administrative support staff person. When I retired after 27 years, I needed to go back to work. I now work at a computer most of the day—it’s like playing and getting paid for it. I love numbers and tracking property. I am currently working for Snelling and Snelling on contract to a local bank.\n\nI was married, but now enjoy the single life. I have two wonderful children and one amazing grandchild. I remember Martha Swayze and Mrs. Mullenix as my favorite teachers. Since I came back to Oak Ridge for my junior and senior years, I was able to make lots of good friends for life. My most vivid memory of ORHS was gym class, first period, when we took swimming. The pool was so cold….and it still is to this day. I am currently an avid bowler and golfer and enjoy knitting, crocheting and reading.\n\nJudy Ann McCown (Russell)\n\nAfter high school I married and moved to Oliver Springs to raise my son. Following a divorce, I moved back to Oak Ridge and went to work at the K-25 plant. After ten years I transferred to the Y-12 Plant and have worked there for 28 years. I am currently a supervisor in a machine shop and love what I do. I plan to retire in January 2015.\n\nI have one son, one grandson, and one great-grandson.\n\nIn looking back at my high school days, I remember Mrs. Mazel Turner and Mr. Lewis as my favorite teachers. I had a lot of good friends that I had met that went to Jefferson Junior High even though I went to Robertsville. High school is a time for making great memories, and I think those days were my best years. I remember a Home Economics class where I made biscuits and gravy—my teacher was so thrilled with my food that she shared it with the teachers in the teachers’ lounge—made me feel really good. I still love cooking because my grandmother and mother taught me at an early age. I am also currently enjoying my embroidery machine and making creative designs with it. I also really enjoy our Class of 1964 get-togethers we have quarterly— these are great times and a special way to keep up with our classmates who attend.\n\nGlenn T. (Tommy) McIntyre\n\nRight after graduation I was drafted in August 1964 and headed straight for the Recruiting Station in Knoxville to join the Air Force. Then on September 1, 1964, I was shipped out for basic training in San Antonio, Texas. After nine weeks of basic, I was transferred to Hurlburt Field, Ft. Walton Beach, Florida. This was an auxiliary field on the Eglin AFB Reservation in the Florida Panhandle. My job assignment in the Air Force was aircraft refueling. In June 1967 I took a 30-day leave before being shipped out to Ubon AB in Thailand and the Viet Nam War. While serving in Ubon, I was assigned to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and am proud to say our Wing shot down more Migs than any other base in Southeast Asia. When I left, the count was up to 38 downed Migs and still going up. In July 1968, I was back in the States and Honorably Discharged before returning to Oak Ridge and the beautiful hills of East Tennessee.\n\nAfter returning home I married my high school sweetheart, Jean Pemberton, and went back to school full time at Tennessee Institute of Electronics to get my Electronics degree. After graduation, I went to work for none other than Burger King in Oak Ridge—it had just opened, and I was one of the first employees to be hired. I only spent a short time with Burger King as my clearance came through and I started work at the K-25 Plant. I spent 35 years as an Instrument Mechanic at the K-25 Plant, with the last 20 years working on computers. Those last 20 years involved a lot of traveling all over the U.S. as well as a trip to Saudi Arabia after Desert Storm and the following year to Germany installing networks for the Army.\n\nOn reflection to my ORHS days, I remember Ms. Barbara Mullenax, Don Anderson, Walter Porter, and Charlie Carnes as my favorite teachers. Mrs. McGehee was ano"
