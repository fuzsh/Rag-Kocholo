        "text": "Since 1963, students and faculty have benefited from VCU’s membership in Oak Ridge Associated Universities, a consortium of 115 colleges and universities and a contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy. ORAU works with its member institutions to help students and faculty gain access to federal research facilities, to keep its members informed about opportunities for scholarship and research appointments and to organize research alliances among its members.\n\nFaculty, graduate students and undergraduate students may access a wide range of opportunities for study and research, including the Lindau-Nobel Laureates and Powe Junior Faculty programs. Many of these programs are designed to increase the numbers of underrepresented minority students pursuing degrees in science- and engineering-related disciplines.\n\nFor more information about ORAU and its programs, contact:\n\nP. Srirama Rao​, Ph.D., ORAU Councilor for VCU\n\n(804) 827-2262\n\nMonnie E. Champion, ORAU Corporate Secretary\n\n(865) 576-2206"
