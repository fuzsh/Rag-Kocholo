        "text": "An internship or undergraduate research program is one of the more useful activities that can supplement your college education and provide you with a new perspective on your chosen profession that is much different from what you have seen in your college classes. At best, this experience can spark new enthusiasm for your field of interest and make contacts that will lead to a full-time job when you graduate or to a rapid transition to graduate school. Undergraduate research experience can also provide an edge when seeking entry-level positions in the chemical industry or professional school. At worst, this experience may help you to discover some type of job or industry that you truly hate, and which you wish to avoid when you are looking for a full-time job. In either case, the resulting knowledge may be invaluable\n\nInternships and undergraduate research programs also provide an excellent opportunity for students to travel to see different parts of the country and even other countries. For those that wish to stay close to home, sometimes companies near where you live may hire summer interns, and in some cases the school where you are normally enrolled will have summer research programs. It is also possible that other schools near your home could also have options that are open to you. When looking for a job near your home or school, be sure to tell as many people as possible what you are seeking. Sometimes helpful contacts come from unexpected directions. Talk to your professors, contact local industries, and look in the want ad section of the local paper. It is often worthwhile to send a letter to the human relations office of nearby companies and ask if anything is available.\n\nFinding that perfect position for yourself will be a challenge and require time and effort on your part. There is no single resource that will provide all of the information that you may require. Therefore, what follows is meant to help you start on your way in your search. This is NOT an exhaustive list and you should look for additional resources on your own. These links are provided for your convenience and do not represent an endorsement.\n\nPenn State Altoona Resources\n\nInternships at Penn State Altoona—It is possible to obtain college course credit for your internships.

REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose. This solicitation features two mechanisms for support of student research: (1) REU Sites are based on independent proposals to initiate and conduct projects that engage a number of students in research. REU Sites may be based in a single discipline or academic department, or on interdisciplinary or multi-department research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme. Proposals with an international dimension are welcome. A partnership with the Department of Defense supports REU Sites in DoD-relevant research areas. (2) REU Supplements may be requested for ongoing NSF-funded research projects or may be included as a component of proposals for new or renewal NSF grants or cooperative agreements. Undergraduate student participants in either Sites or Supplements must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions. Students may not apply to NSF to participate in REU activities. Students apply directly to REU Sites and should consult the directory of active REU Sites.\n\nResearch and Training Opportunities at the National Institute of Health - The NIH has a number of student programs available. One such program is The Summer Internship Program (SIP) which \"provides an opportunity to spend the summer working side-by-side with some of the leading scientists in the world in an environment devoted exclusively to biomedical reseach. Students sixteen years of age or older who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and are currently enrolled at least half-time in high school or an accredited U.S. college or unicersity are eligible to apply. Students who have been accepted into a college or unersity may also apply.\n\nSummer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF): National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - \"for students majoring in science, mathematics and engineering. Note that applications for participation in the SURF program are only accepted from colleges or universitites, and not from individual students. Please prepare a single proposal from your institution to the NIST SURF program.\"\n\nORISE: Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education - \"Are you a student, recent graduate, or faculty member looking for an opportunity to work on a degree?

The catalog lists academic fellowships and scholarships, research experiences, sabbaticals, and internships funded by government agencies. These programs are administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), many through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), a U.S. Department of Energy institute managed by ORAU. This site is organized by academic status to allow you to quickly narrow the focus of your search. For example, if you are a college student pursuing a bachelor's degree, you would click on the \"Undergrad Students\" button. Once you have selected the academic status, you can then view the opportunities available by program name, sponsoring agency, application deadline, or geographic location. You can also navigate to the programs that interest you by selecting a field of interest, a type of program, a specific time period, or other selection criteria. A keyword search is also possible on the main page through \"Search this Web site.\" In addition to key words, you may use the * as a wildcard symbol; for example, NOA* will find all NOAA programs. Once you have selected a program, you can read a description of the program, eligibility requirements, benefits provided, how to apply, and more.\"\n\nOther Internet Resources\n\nOther College and University websites also could provide information concerning their summer research opportunities.
