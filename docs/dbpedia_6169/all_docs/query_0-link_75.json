        "text": "The Eurasian MA is an interdisciplinary program that combines Anthropology, History, Literature, Political Science, Religious Studies, and Sociology. We define Eurasia inclusively, comprising not just the five post-Soviet republics of Central Asia, but Xinjiang, Mongolia, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, Russia, and Eastern Europe.

Some of our faculty members even specialize in Eurasian studies. Admitted students of NU SSH can rest assured of tapping from our faculty’s wealth of knowledge and experience, both inside and outside the classroom.\n\nWe keep our classes small so students can readily receive one-on-one attention from their instructors. Moreover, instructors can tailor classes to the need of each student for the best learning experience owing to our student-centered learning. Our professors can work with the weaknesses of every student and improve their strengths. Laboratory experience and research involvement are not spared from this approach: our students get practical laboratory experience and collaborate with their colleagues or their professors in research.\n\nStrategic partner\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison (USA)\n\nOther strategic partners of Nazarbayev University"
