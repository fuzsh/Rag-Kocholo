She is particularly interested in developing assessment tools that are both effective in measuring student learning (however defined for the education-based research question) and clear to analyze. Prior to receiving the NRT grant, Leanna’s work focused mainly on the impact new lessons and/or new analytics technologies (developed by Leanna and a collaborative research team at Virginia Tech) have on students’ approaches to learning from data, i.e., data exploration.\n\nLink to more information: http://analytics.cs.vt.edu/edu-urbcomp.php\n\nName: Glenda Kelly\n\nEmail: glenda.kelly@duke.edu\n\nEmail: glenda.kelly@duke.edu\n\nTitle: IBIEM NRT Coordinator and Internal Evaluation Liason, Associate Director for Assessment and Outreach for the Center for the Environmental Implications of NanoTechnology (CEINT), Pratt School of Engineering, Duke.\n\nAffiliation: Center for the Environmental Implications of NanoTechnology (CEINT), Pratt School of Engineering,Duke University\n\nEvaluation interests and workshop goals: Glenda has extensive background developing and evaluating STEM educational and outreach programs, both nationally and internationally, including graduate and undergraduate training programs (PIREs, GK-12, REUs, and NSECs). She has special interest in developing ways to teach science and engineering to optimally engage diverse populations especially females and underrepresented minorities and in how the “culture” of a given educational program impacts learning outcomes and retention. For this workshop, Glenda is interested in learning about the array of evaluation components, benchmarks, common goals and tools this group of NRT evaluators can share. She would also like to discuss how to incorporate assessment components across NRT training programs to yield a broader perspective on NRTs’ national impacts on graduate training.\n\nName: David Reider\n\nEmail: david@educationdesign.biz\n\nTitle: Principal Partner\n\nAffiliation: Education Design, INC.; University of Southern Mississippi\n\nEvaluation interests and workshop goals: Education Design focuses on program evaluation in STEM and Arts Education. While basing our data collection and analysis on the methods and processes that define the evaluation field, our interests are to be interpreters of program data, speaking the different dialects of students, teachers, researchers, and stakeholders. As interpreters, we position our evaluation findings across the multiple audiences that comprise a project.\n\nEvery project has a story to tell: what happened, how it happened, what was learned by whom, under what conditions and contexts things worked or didn’t, and in general what the larger field can learn from the work. In NRT, different from most projects we work on, the evaluation effort focuses not so much on what students are learning, but what the institution is learning: how it responds to the shifts and demands required by the program, how stakeholders respond, and what the potential is for lasting changes and adoption in the practices of these departments. I am very interested in hearing how other NRT evaluators resonate with these ideas, and how NRT PIs might find this approach to evaluation helpful.\n\nLink to more information: http://www.educationdesign.biz/about/staff/#David\n\nName: MaryAnn Moore\n\nEmail: mamoore@iastate.edu\n\nTitle: Program Coordinator\n\nAffiliation: Iowa State University\n\nEvaluation interests and workshop goals: As the program coordinator of Iowa State’s recently funded NSF NRT Predictive Plant Phenomics (P3) Program, one of MaryAnn’s roles is to serve as the liaison between our external evaluator team and the P3 Program.

The large NSF Funded MRSEC at Penn State engages approximately 40 faculty and 40 graduate students across seven departments in three colleges. Currently, the Penn State NRT PI is a Center member and Co-PIs are affiliated with the Center. Professional development activities are a strong focus of the MRSEC, but because the grant is primarily research-focused with strong traditional outreach and informal science education programs already in place, she is working to integrate these activities as much as possible – in a meaningful way with clear objectives and outcomes. Identifying, defining, measuring, and assessing professional development outcomes has been a challenging task, but one which she hopes to learn how to implement more successfully. As a recent co-chair of the Evaluation Committee for the MRSEC Education Directors Network, Kristin also brings experience regarding the challenges of coordinating network-wide efforts across MRSEC’s at different institutions. Kristin is a former high school physics and mathematics teacher who also has a background in formal education assessment practices.
