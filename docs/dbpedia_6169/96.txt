For more than 75 years, Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) has partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies to advance national priorities in science, education, workforce development, public health, and worker health and safety.

The Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies, which would later be renamed Oak Ridge Associated Universities, was incorporated by the State of Tennessee on October 17, 1946. On the same day, ORINS hosted the first-ever meeting of the Council of Sponsoring Institutions, which included representatives from 14 Southern research universities.
