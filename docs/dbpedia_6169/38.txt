As part of the original University Partnerships vision, ORNL established a founding group of core partners with the major southeastern research universities. This approach helped the laboratory facilitate the initial establishment of joint appointments, collaborative research, and graduate student opportunities that have since spread out across the country. The core university partners (Duke University, Florida State University, Georgia Tech, North Carolina State University, University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt University, University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech) and Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) are part of the UT-Battelle management team, thus ensuring the broad engagement of faculty and students in the science programs at the laboratory and the involvement of university leaders in decisions regarding the future direction of science programs at ORNL.
