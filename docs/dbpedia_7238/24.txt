"This was my very first Robert Ludlum novel, and it freaked me out! I read it in 2002, and all of the terrorism stuff just hit way to close to home. I was shocked by all the references to hijacked airplanes, anthrax and bombs in a book that was published in 2000. It seemed at the time like Ludlum was foretelling the future. I have been a fan ever since, even reading the Bourne novels that other authors have continued after his death, just to get a glimpse into what homage they pay to his talent."
