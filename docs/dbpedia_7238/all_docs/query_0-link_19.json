        "meta_description": "The Prometheus Deception by Robert LudlumRobert Ludlum is the acknowledged master of suspense and international intrigue. For the past 30 years he has had an unbroken string of bestselling novels, selling more than 500 million copies worldwide and setting a standard that has never been surpassed. THE PROMETHEUS DECEPTION, his first new novel for three years, shows him at the pinnacle of his form. Nicholas Bryson spent years as a deep cover operative for the American secret intelligence group, The Directorate. After a disastrous mission, Bryson was retired to a new identity. Now, years later, his cover is cracked and Bryson learns that The Directorate was not what it claimed - that he was, in fact, a pawn being used against his country's interests. The Directorate is headed for a dangerous endgame, and the CIA recruits Bryson to stop them. But after years on the sidelines, Bryson's field skills are rusty, his contacts unreliable, his instincts suspect, and he no longer knows who - if anyone - can be trusted.",
