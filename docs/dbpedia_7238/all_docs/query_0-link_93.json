        "text": "VJ Books Presents Author Robert Ludlum!\n\nBOURNE AGAIN by John Hutchinson, VJ Books (August 5, 2016) - \"When Robert Ludlum died 15 years ago our hopes for another book featuring Jason Bourne where seriously dampened. However, you can't keep a good character down, and Bourne has grown far beyond the three original Ludlum titles.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of Eric Lustbader, the Bourne series has grown to epic proportions with the release of ten _ count them _ ten novels: The Bourne Legacy (2004), The Bourne Betrayal (2007), The Bourne Sanction (2008), The Bourne Deception (2009), The Bourne Objective (2010), The Bourne Dominion (2011), The Bourne Imperative (2012), The Bourne Retribution (2013), The Bourne Ascendancy (2014), and, just released, The Bourne Enigma (2016).\n\nThe first attempt to bring Bourne to the screen was in the long forgotten made for TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain, previously known as Dr. Kildare turned Shogun. It was probably the best TV spy movies made, winning a golden globe nomination, but made for TV movies don't get many sequels.\n\nIn classic Hollywood form Bourne returned in 2002 with superstar Matt Damon as the man from Treadstone. The Bourne Supremacy followed in 2004 and The Bourne Ultimatum in 2007.\n\nIn 2012 The Bourne Legacy hit the big screen with black ops operative number 5, Aaron Cross played by Jeremy Renner. In an effort to shutdown the black ops unit, the CIA trys to terminate Cross, and he goes on the run, just like Bourne did two years previously.\n\nJason Bourne. You know his name, and you know what to expect in this growing franchise: stupendous car chases, brutal hand-to-hand combat, and a big CIA control room where tech wizards watch his every move\n\naround the world. The just released Bourne flick has loads of all that, making it a joyful seat-gripping action flick. In this sequel, Bourne aspires to reflect the real dangers of unchecked technological power in the modern world. Matt Damon turns in another superb performance.\n\nAs Treadstone fades into ruins, Jason Bourne remains the one asset that I am sure Bob Ludlum would love to know. Don't miss Eric Lustbader's The Bourne Enigma, and catch Jason Bourne, starring Matt Damon, at a theater near you.\"\n\nRobert Ludlum Book List\n\nHis website: robert-ludlum.com\n\nSimilar authors: Stephen Coonts, Vince Flynn, Paul Garrison, Eric Van Lustbader\n\nThe Bancroft Strategy\n\nFirst Edition\n\nAmbler Warning\n\nFirst Edition\n\nThe Tristan Betrayal\n\nFirst Edition\n\nThe Prometheus Deception\n\nFirst Edition\n\nThe Matarese Countdown\n\nFirst Edition\n\nThe Icarus Agenda\n\nFirst Edition\n\nRobert Ludlum Bibliography\n\nBy Ludlum, published during the author's lifetime\n\nThe Scarlatti Inheritance (1971)\n\nThe Osterman Weekend (1972)\n\nThe Matlock Paper (1973)\n\nTrevayne (1973, writing under the pen-name Jonathan Ryder)\n\nThe Cry of the Halidon (1974, writing under the pen-name Jonathan Ryder)\n\nThe Rhinemann Exchange (1974)\n\nThe Road to Gandolfo (1975, writing under the pen-name Michael Shepherd)\n\nThe Gemini Contenders (1976)\n\nThe Chancellor Manuscript (1977)\n\nThe Holcroft Covenant (1978)\n\nThe Matarese Circle (1979)\n\nThe Bourne Identity (1980)\n\nThe Parsifal Mosaic (1982)\n\nThe Aquitaine Progression (1984)\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy (1986)\n\nThe Icarus Agenda (1988)\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum (1990)\n\nThe Road to Omaha (1992)\n\nThe Scorpio Illusion (1993)\n\nThe Apocalypse Watch (1995)\n\nThe Matarese Countdown (1997)\n\nThe Prometheus Deception (2000)\n\nCredited to Ludlum, published posthumously\n\nThe Sigma Protocol (2001, the last novel written entirely by Ludlum)\n\nThe Janson Directive (2002)\n\nThe Tristan Betrayal (2003)\n\nThe Ambler Warning (2005)\n\nThe Bancroft Strategy (2006)\n\nJason Bourne novels\n\nThe Bourne Identity (1980)\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy (1986)\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum (1990)\n\nThe Bourne Legacy (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2004)\n\nThe Bourne Betrayal (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2007)\n\nThe Bourne Sanction (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2008)\n\nThe Bourne Deception (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2009)\n\nThe Bourne Objective (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2010)\n\nThe Bourne Dominion (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2011)\n\nThe Bourne Imperative (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2012)\n\nThe Bourne Retribution (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2013)\n\nThe Bourne Ascendancy (by Eric Van Lustbader) (2014)\n\nCovert-One series\n\nMain article: Covert-One series\n\nCovert-One series written by other authors\n\nThe Hades Factor (by Gayle Lynds) (2000)\n\nThe Cassandra Compact (by Philip Shelby) (2001)\n\nThe Paris Option (by Gayle Lynds) (2002)\n\nThe Altman Code (by Gayle Lynds) (2003)\n\nThe Lazarus Vendetta (by Patrick Larkin) (2004)\n\nThe Moscow Vector (by Patrick Larkin) (2005)\n\nThe Arctic Event (by James H.
