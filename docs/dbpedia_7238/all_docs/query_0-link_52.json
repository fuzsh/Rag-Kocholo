        "text": "Author bibliography\n\nRobert Ludlum (1927–2001) was an American author of twenty-seven novels between 1971 and 2006, the last being issued five years after his death.[1] Of his twenty-seven novels, two were originally published under the pseudonym of Jonathan Ryder and another under the pseudonym of Michael Shepherd. Ludlum also created the Covert-One series, overseeing the first three novels with Gayle Lynds and Philip Shelby before his death.[2] Following Ludlum's death, his estate has continued to publish novels under his name with eleven authors having written a combined thirty-three novels under the Ludlum brand, a trademark inscription of \"Robert Ludlum's\" on every book (e.g. Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Dominion). Since 2019, publishing rights in the United States have been held by G. P. Putnam's Sons, taking over from Grand Central Publishing who held the rights from 2007 to 2017.[3]\n\nThe latest book to be published is The Bourne Shadow by Brian Freeman. The twentieth novel in the Jason Bourne series, The Bourne Vendetta by Brian Freeman, is scheduled for January 2025.\n\nWorks\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Series First edition publisher Notes Ref The Scarlatti Inheritance 1971 — World Publishing Company [4] The Osterman Weekend 1972 — World Publishing Company [5] The Matlock Paper 1973 — Dial Press [6] Trevayne 1973 — Delacorte Press Written under the pen-name Jonathan Ryder [7] The Cry of the Halidon 1974 — Delacorte Press Written under the pen-name Jonathan Ryder [8] The Rhinemann Exchange 1974 — Dial Press [9] The Road to Gandolfo 1975 The Road To (#1) Dial Press Written under the pen-name Michael Shepherd [10][11] The Gemini Contenders 1976 — Dial Press [12] The Chancellor Manuscript 1977 — Dial Press [13] The Holcroft Covenant 1978 — Richard Marek Publishers [14] The Matarese Circle 1979 Matarese (#1) Richard Marek Publishers [15][16] The Bourne Identity 1980 Jason Bourne (#1) Richard Marek Publishers [17][18] The Parsifal Mosaic 1982 — Random House [19] The Aquitaine Progression 1984 — Random House [20] The Bourne Supremacy 1986 Jason Bourne (#2) Random House [18][21] The Icarus Agenda 1988 — Random House [22] The Bourne Ultimatum 1990 Jason Bourne (#3) Random House [18][23] The Road to Omaha 1992 The Road To (#2) Random House Sequel to The Road to Gandolfo [24][25][11] The Scorpio Illusion 1993 — Bantam Books [26] The Apocalypse Watch 1995 — Bantam Books [27] The Matarese Countdown 1997 Matarese (#2) Bantam Books Sequel to The Matarese Circle [28][29] The Hades Factor 2000 Covert-One (#1) St. Martin's Griffin Written with Gayle Lynds [18][30] The Prometheus Deception 2000 — St. Martin's Press [31] The Cassandra Compact 2001 Covert-One (#2) St. Martin's Griffin Posthumous publication.
