        "text": "Robert Ludlum is the acknowledged master of suspense and international intrigue. For the past twenty-five years he has had an unbroken string of bestselling novels, selling hundreds of millions of copies worldwide and setting a standard that has yet to be surpassed. With The Prometheus Deception, Ludlum's first new novel in three years, he is at the very pinnacle of his craft.\n\nNicholas Bryson was a deep-cover operative for a secret American intelligence group called the Directorate. After a mission went wrong he was retired to a new identity as a college professor in Pennsylvania. Now, years later, he discovers that the Directorate was using him against his own country's interests. The deputy director of the CIA enlists Bryson to stop the Directorate's latest lethal maneuver and end the group for good.\n\nRobert Ludlum (1927-2001) was the author of 25 thriller novels, including The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum--the books on which the international hit movies were based--and The Sigma Protocol. He was also the creator of the Covert-One series. Born in New York City, Ludlum received a B.A. from Wesleyan University, and before becoming an author, he was a United States Marine, a theater actor and producer.\n\nPaul Michael was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada where he performed on stage, radio, and TV including a regular role on the TV series The Beachcombers. He also received an ACTRA award nomination (the Canadian equivalent of an Emmy) for best actor in a TV movie for Gold Mountain Fever. Paul has guest starred in several American TV series including VIP and Alias and has narrated nearly fifty recorded books, both abridged and unabridged, and has been twice nominated for an Audie award. Some of his most popular recordings include The Tristan Betrayal, Hollywood Tough, Sons of Fortune, Second Spring, and The Da Vinci Code. Paul now makes his home in Southern California with his wife and two daughters."
