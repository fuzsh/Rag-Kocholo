        "text": "\"The Prometheus Deception\"\n\nBy Robert Ludlum\n\nSt. Martin's Press\n\nFiction\n\n384 pages\n\nIn this story:\n\nEverything he knows is wrong\n\nFairly straightforward, for Ludlum\n\nRELATED STORIES, SITES\n\n(CNN) -- Robert Ludlum is a bestseller machine. His publishers note that he holds a unique place in the history of bookselling -- every novel he has published since 1969 has been a bestseller, \"an unbroken thirty-one-year string,\" in the words of his publicists. His most recent entry on the bestseller lists, \"The Hades Factor,\" is a collaboration and the first of a series of novels that promises to turn Ludlum into a brand name.\n\nALSO\n\nExcerpt: 'The Prometheus Deception'\n\nThere is a certain formula to Ludlum's thrillers. The titles all have three words (a rule his \"comic\" novels all violate) and are centered on a seemingly ordinary person thrust into extraordinary circumstances. \"The Osterman Weekend\" can be used as a sort of template for the way the author works when he is at the top of his game. \"The Bourne Identity\" turns the formula inside out, in that the \"seemingly ordinary person\" is not ordinary at all.\n\nThere are echoes of the \"Bourne\" trilogy in his new solo novel \"The Prometheus Deception.\" Like Jason Bourne, protagonist Nicholas Bryson is an operative for an intelligence organization. After an operation in North Africa goes sour, Bryson is put out to pasture, with a new name and a job teaching at a small college. He also loses his wife. Years pass, and he's suddenly sucked back into the world of international intrigue.\n\nEverything he knows is wrong\n\nIt seems everything he knew about his former employers, a shadowy outfit called \"The Directorate,\" was false. At least, that's what the CIA is telling him now. The Agency has come to believe The Directorate was in fact a \"mole\" operation, inserted into the U.S. intelligence community to do harm rather than good. Bryson doesn't believe it, and sets out to prove the CIA wrong.\n\nHe dodges bullets and leaves a trail of bodies from the coast of Spain, through the heart of Europe and to the edge of China in his search for the truth. Along the way, he hooks up with an astonishingly beautiful Israeli-Arab operative called Layla. She says she's with the Mossad and offers to help. He wants to believe her, but Bryson doubts everything and everybody. Except, of course, himself.\n\n\"As she spoke,\" Ludlum writes, \"his eyes roamed the crowd, ever alert for the familiar face, the quickly averted glance. He had done this thing countless times before, but this time was different, nerve-wracking; he had stepped into the unknown. Also, his plan was vague, a necessary improvisation based on his finely honed instincts.\"\n\nFairly straightforward, for Ludlum\n\nThose \"finely honed instincts\" land Bryson in hot water time after time. He mistakes friends for foes and, more dangerously, vice versa. His life is constantly on the line and he cheats death repeatedly. But he resists the temptation to throw in the towel and go back to his quiet professorial life.\n\n\"The Prometheus Deception\" is not quite as convoluted as some of Ludlum's other recent novels. Indeed, the plot is fairly straightforward, for him. It's crammed with action, exotic locales and lethal hardware. All in all, typical Ludlum fare. He is not a gifted wordsmith, but he does have a genius for keeping the reader wondering what will happen on the next page.\n\nAfter putting more than 20 books on the bestseller lists, Ludlum has certainly learned how to craft a commercial success. \"The Prometheus Deception\" may not break new ground, but it's on a par with the style and quality of his other books. In other words, Ludlum's \"unbroken thirty-one year string\" is likely to remain intact.\n\nRELATED SITES:"
