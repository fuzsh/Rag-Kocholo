"Having seen the Bourne trilogy multiple times, I pretty much knew what to expect form a Robert Ludlum novel. And what I got was good, solid entertainment: it certainly isn't great literature, it's silly and the endless action and close-calls became quite ridiculous (just how many times was our hero saved by someone shooting the bad guy on the very last second?), but it was great fun to read."
