WSAI in Cincinnati signed on the air in 1923 at 1360 AM. Crosley Broadcasting, owners of WLW-AM in Cincinnati, bought WSAI because its original transmitter site in Mason. Ohio, was seen as the perfect location for WLW’s 50,000-watt transmitter.

During this time in the 1930s and 1940s, WLW broadcast NBC and Mutual programs while Crosley kept WSAI as a locally-programmed sister station. The FCC ruled in the late 1940s that companies could not own more than one AM station in a market, and Crosley had to sell one of its Cincinnati stations. Not surprisingly, it sold the less powerful WSAI.

It flipped to a Top 40 format and became an extremely popular station in the 1960s and 1970s. In this era, WSAI had audience shares in the 40s. Here’s a 1964 aircheck of WSAI in its heyday:

WSAI flipped to country music in 1978. According to Arbitron ratings the following year, WSAI was still a strong No. 3. Those numbers slowly dwindled through the early 1980s as music listeners switched to FM stations.

WSAI’s owners started a simulcast of WWNK-FM’s soft rock format in 1985 and changed the call letters to WWNK-AM. It didn’t stem the ratings decline. WWNK-AM flipped to oldies in 1987 and later reclaimed the WSAI call letters.

The station scrapped oldies in 1992 and became Cincinnati’s first sports-talk station. It didn’t last long. The owner leased WSAI to Jacor Communications, and it became an adult standards station.

Jacor the acquired the intellectual property of WCKY-AM 1530 and merged it with WLWA-AM 550 (now WKRC). In 1994, WCKY’s call letters were moved to 550 AM. WSAI’s legendary call letters and adult standards format went to the 50,000-watt 1530 AM signal.

In 2003, WSAI flipped to an oldies format, but lasted only two years. The old 1360 AM signal became a children’s music station called WAOZ, then news/talk WAZU in 1996. It went back to sports-talk in 1997.

Clear Channel and Jacor merged. The company moved the WCKY call letters from 550 AM to 1360 AM. It returned the original WKRC call letters to 550 AM.

In 2005, WCKY and WSAI swapped their call signs back to their original dial positions. WSAI went to 1360 AM with its growing sports-talk format. WCKY went back to 1530 AM and flipped to liberal talk radio.

Confused, yet?

The two stations switched formats the following year. Liberal talk went to WSAI, while the sports format went to WCKY.

The liberal talk on WSAI lasted five months. The station tried a talk format with advice and consumer shows. That lasted six months.

In 2007, WSAI joined sister station WCKY in carrying a sports format. Today WSAI is the Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cincinnati and WCKY is the ESPN affiliate.

With all that call letter swapping, do you think listeners noticed or cared?
