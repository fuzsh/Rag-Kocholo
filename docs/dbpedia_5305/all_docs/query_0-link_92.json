        "text": "• On Wednesday, October 24, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in coordination with iHeartMedia, will host an unveiling of the modernization project of iHeartMedia’s WLW-AM (NewsRadio 700)/Cincinnati. This facility is one of 77 across the country that serve as a National Public Warning System (NPWS) Primary Entry Point (PEP) station, participating with FEMA to provide emergency alert and warning information to the public before, during and after incidents and disasters.\n\nAs directed by Congress in the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) Modernization Act of 2015, FEMA, which manages IPAWS, launched an effort to upgrade PEP stations, which are designed and hardened to withstand various natural and man-made events to ensure continuity of operations. WLW-AM is only the second station in the country to complete this upgrade, which includes increased sheltering capabilities, expanded broadcast capacity and sustainable power generation for all types of hazardous events.\n\nA news conference with FEMA folks and iHeart execs will be held at 11am ET, followed by a ribbon-cutting, official remarks, Q&A, tour of the facility and live demonstration at the WLW-AM PEP station emergency studio… and hopefully, some cake."
