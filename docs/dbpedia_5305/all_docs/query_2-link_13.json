        "text": "In the early years of the blog, comments were few and far between. And that was disappointing to me. When I wrote that first post in February 2005, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I wasn’t even sure what the blog’s purpose was. But I sensed that if my posts could start a dialogue, I would consider it successful.\n\nAs I came to find out, the early days, weeks, and months of a new blog (or podcast or radio format) can be quiet….TOO quiet. And that was the case with the blog. Readership at the beginning was slow, and there was no social media for marketing it.\n\nI stuck with it, and the blog gained some traction. More importantly, it started attracting new readers, and from there, conversation. And then the comments started coming in. At first, it was a trickle.\n\nToday, comments come into the blog regularly, as well as on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Yes, there are “regulars,” pe0ple who leave several comments a week. I’ve got to count on this scrappy group for feedback, as well as to keep me honest when I write something lame. This time around, he was responding to a blog post I recently wrote about the state of AM radio here in the U.S.\n\nI don’t hear from Tom Langmyer often. But when I do, he doesn’t write a line or two. He always leaves a blog-length comment. And his thought process is always very smart. That’s because Tom is a grizzled radio lifer who’s enjoyed much success in radio.\n\nAnd he is well-qualified to talk about the state of AM, having served aa VP/GM at WGN, KMOX, and other music and talk stations. Tom has held corporate VP and news/talk/sports programming positions. These days, Tom is President/CEO of Great Lakes Media LLC, a media acquisition and advisory firm. Tom’s stock-in-trade is “localism in media, sales, marketing, and content.” He advises in multiple formats across the spectrum.\n\nTom Langmyer is our guest blogger this morning on this ongoing topic of AM radio in cars. As you would with me, please leave him a comment below. – FJ\n\nA great analysis of AM radio, Fred.\n\nLots to think about. And lots of opportunity to step up here at the 11th hour.\n\nHow much does it really cost to put in shielded cable into a car?!?\n\nAM characteristics are certainly different from FM. However, just like the good old days, there was a common antenna used for both AM and FM in cars. One coaxial cable put into the back of the unit attached to an antenna on the other end. Add some shielding. Electricity and electric motors are not a new thing. Generally, they can coexist with AM radio. Not an ideal world, but it can be done.\n\nThis is too easy an excuse for what is really happening.\n\nThe auto companies simply don’t make money on free radio.\n\nThey are tied into deals, where they receive subscription revenue from their partners.\n\nAnd their partners are not friends with radio. They are competition in the audio space and so are the automakers, as a result.\n\nMost auto executives are based in Detroit. The top news station in Detroit is an AM station.\n\nWWJ has an excellent full-time reporter, Jeff Gilbert, covering the auto industry and reports daily on it. Do these auto executives, many of whom actually have a relationship with that reporter, no longer listen to this AM station, all of a sudden?\n\nI’m not sure if anyone has reported on what kind of relationships and lobbying efforts are done by the mega corporations that provide subscription-based audio content, nor the auto companies themselves, who also have all of their skin in the game.\n\nIt just seems rather curious, that with all of the people advocating for radio, inside, and outside of the industry, that automakers would draw such a hard line in the sand. It’s not over a shielding a cable in a car.\n\nLook at the evidence of radio usage. Look at the amount of AM radio usage, let alone the amount of FM radio usage.\n\nThe automotive industry is actually in competition with radio. Most tend to overlook the fact.\n\nIt doesn’t want free radio in cars, and is clearly, strategically, and slowly sunsetting radio, using various tactics which, over time, will wean people off it.\n\nIf this issue is not led and managed aggressively by the radio industry itself, the loss of radio in cars will be a self-fulfilled prophecy.\n\nFree radio cuts into subscription revenue for the other audio platforms AND for the auto industry.\n\nHow different is this from the refusal to turn on a chip in a smartphone in order to receive radio, back when Jeff Smulyan fought so hard for our industry to try to get that to happen?\n\nAt that time, there was no significant admission that the only reason why these entities refused to turn on the chips was because they wanted to shut radio out – because radio was in their “space.”\n\nThe automotive industry has deals with Sirius/XM. They make a lot of money because of those partnerships. If you want subscription revenue, “you must murder FREE radio and make it look like an accident” to the consumer, who will now be forced to pay for your subscription-based content.\n\nAdditionally, to your point, radio has not done a good job of self-promoting, let alone specifically promoting itself and the premier place to get emergency information.\n\nLet’s be honest about ourselves.\n\nDuring the winter, I spent time in a city that had two MAJOR snow storms.\n\nDuring those events, only one radio station provided information. The others were in jukebox or syndication mode and wouldn’t have anybody to do anything about it even knew how to do it, let alone wanted to.\n\nWhat’s unfortunate, at least, as it pertains to weather, versus train derailments, for the most part, we DO know when the bad weather is coming and can have a plan to cover it, often days in advance. If we don’t even do that, that’s a choice we made.\n\nIt’s a little bit hard to sell our industry as a whole let alone just AM with that philosophy.\n\nWe have to be the thing you can’t live without. Is that the case anymore?\n\nIt’s about putting our money where our mouth is.\n\nAre the CEOs of the major radio groups at the forefront and visible and this fight?\n\nDo they rally the industry?\n\nIf an emergency happens, does leadership contact the market and ask if they can provide some help?\n\nWhen a big AM station does an incredible job covering wildfires in California, a train derailment in Ohio, a mass school shooting, a tornado in Oklahoma, a hurricane along the east coast, what happens?!? And what happens if they don’t?\n\nA station may be lucky to have that one dedicated broadcaster or two that still get it, and feel responsible to their listeners to make sure they are updated and safe. They’ll worry about who is going to fill out their time cards after the fact. And yes, the best leaders in the best companies don’t balk at those who are their bread and butter.\n\nAsk yourself, if you are at any level within a radio company from the CEO all the way down to a board op in a small town: Are your immediate go-to’s “We don’t have the staff,” “It’s on a weekend,” “They can just get it on their phone,” “It’s an earthquake, and everybody already knows what to do” or “It’s a holiday and nobody would come in for something like that?”\n\nAre people on the staff empowered to say “Wow. This just happened. I’m headed to the station right now and will get right on the air and handle it. I will talk to witnesses, law-enforcement, and others on the air live to get the information out.” Will they get in trouble for doing that?\n\nIn some instances, I know of people who did amazing things for the community and for the station, and were rewarded by being dressed down for “working hours that are not in the budget.” Is it really that bad?!?\n\nLeadership instills an expectation and a desire to win. Leadership works in concert with a vision that supports what it is we are in business to do. Leadership supports its people to do just that.\n\nSo, as an industry, what do we view our purpose as? What are we really trying to do here?\n\nAll too often, it seems that we ourselves have relegated our position to a poor man’s streaming service, a jukebox with lots of commercials.\n\nRadio is fundamentally a local business, and it is in the business of serving the community. THAT is our business. It’s about creating a local experience, a real community – whether you are a music station or a spoken word station.\n\nSo how does radio differentiate itself?\n\nThe fact that it is free, and isn’t dependent on having a power company keeping a transmitter running is just one part of our reliability – but the main part is PEOPLE.\n\nLeadership in our industry, and not just the NAB, needs to use its strength to organize and to more effectively fight this.\n\nAt the same time, WE have to embrace the fact we need to produce unmatched service, particularly during emergency situations.\n\nDoes every CEO know that each of their local clusters/stations has a plan and people to make sure that the right thing gets done depending on the situation? Who is responsible to lead it? Who are the people who are on call to cover it?\n\nDo we know that we have this set up at our stations? And if we don’t, how do we fix it, and quickly?\n\nMuch of this isn’t that difficult to figure out. However, when the most influential groups are troubled, not because radio isn’t good and important, but because of debt, content is the last thing they are worried about!\n\nSo yes, it’s about a whole lot more than somebody paying an extra five dollars for whatever is needed to pick up AM Radio in a car."
