        "text": "RUSHVILLE - For 20 years now, WLRY 88.9 FM has been broadcasting Christian music, programs and news, along with a helping of local news, features and interviews.\n\n\"We just want to reach as many people with the message of Jesus Christ as we can,\" general manager Mike Lamneck said. \"That's our purpose. We do that through 88.9 FM and also through streaming audio (www.wlry.org) where people can tune in all around the world on our stream.\"\n\nLamneck joined the station in 2005 after leaving WLOH when new ownership took over. His on-air personality is Mike O'Riley.\n\nThanks to a new 299-foot tower, the station transmits at 1,000 watts and reaches a large portion of central Ohio.\n\nThe station has covered numerous stories over the years, of course. Lamneck said one that stands out is when one person died from botulism and numerous more were sickened in 2015 at a potluck dinner at Cross Pointe Free Will Baptist Church in Lancaster.\n\n\"We got together with other people in the area and had a fundraising concert for that,\" Lamneck said.\n\nThree partners, Richard Finke, Dwayne Hurst and J.T. Burcham formed the station, which received its license in December 1999. Archangel Broadcasting oversees the non-profit station.\n\n\"Richard was a ham radio operator, and kind of grew out of that,\" Lamneck said. \"He felt led to start a radio station out of being interested in radio all of his life.\"\n\nLamneck and his wife, Kelli, run the station with the help of some volunteers. Those volunteers include New Lexington resident Michael Renick, who provides the station with weather reports.\n\n\"But primarily, I do the operations and my wife, Kelli, does all of the books,\" Lamneck said.\n\nHe gets to work early and does the news, weather and the morning show from 6 to 8:30 a.m. After that, he does interviews either by phone or in person. Lamneck also records various pieces for airing later on, along with a variety of other duties.\n\nLamneck has been in the radio business for about 35 years and has some heroes of his own.\n\n\"I grew up listening to Top 40 radio, WNCI, Casey Kasem's Top 40,\" he said. \"And then I listened to talk radio out of Cincinnati, Gary Burbank (WLW). I like that.\"\n\nFor his own style, Lamneck said he tries to be upbeat without be too over the top.\n\n\"I have been told that I have a very warm, kind of down-home delivery,\" he said.\n\nLamneck, a Gahanna native and Ohio State graduate, got his start at WHOK/WLOH working for Karl Gruber. He was working as a club DJ when started in radio, and still works as a DJ for various events.\n\n\"It's been a blessing,\" Lamneck said of his radio career. \"I've been able to stay in radio. And the reason I've been able to stay in radio is because Karl and the staff there taught me to do a variety of jobs, which has served me really well.\n\n\"Because I can do production, I can do on-air work, I can do sales and public relations. Anytime that I've needed to get into a radio station during my life I've been able to offer a variety of different jobs, which makes you more valuable.\"\n\nFor the future, Lamneck said he'd like to see the station continue to grow. The station doesn't track it's listeners, so Lamneck doesn't know how many he has. But he said people from all over the world listen online.\n\nMusic is a huge part of Lamneck's job, but it's also a large part of his life away from the radio station. Along with being a DJ, he is the vocalist and rhythm guitarist for Christian rock band, SlawDog. The band is not affiliated with the WLRY, however. But Lamneck said the band does serve as a Christian ministry.\n\nWhile Lamneck broadcasts Christian music and plays Christian music with SlawDog, he is also well-versed in numerous other genres. He is a fan of the rock bands KISS, Rush, Foghat, Savoy Brown, Kansas and several others.\n\njbarron@gannett.com\n\n740-681-4340\n\nTwitter: @JeffDBarron\n\nAbout the Series\n\nAces of Trades is a series focusing on people and their jobs – whether they’re unusual jobs, fun jobs or people who take ordinary jobs and make them extraordinary.
