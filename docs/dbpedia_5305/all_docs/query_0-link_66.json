        "text": "About the Cincinnati Location Near Me\n\nIn the Cincinnati, Ohio radio market, the best way to break into the business is to work as an extern in a real radio station–and we’re the only radio school alternative that puts you there.\n\nWhy spend up to 10-50 thousand dollars to learn radio broadcasting in an isolated classroom or simulated studio? We can train you in the heart of the action, in a real radio broadcasting facility, for a fraction of that amount! Get on the inside track, and make valuable industry connections while you get educated on-the-job. Our radio school alternative is the smartest, most cost-effective training program on the market today.\n\nTo APPLY for our Cincinnati Radio School alternative, click here.\n\nOne of the most notable centers for manufacturing and commerce in the midwest (home to Kroger and Proctor and Gamble, among other major corporations), Cincinnati sits in a strategic location along the Ohio River bordering Kentucky. First populated by immigrants mainly from Germany and Ireland, Cincinnati has developed its own European-influenced culture over the years, as witnessed in its dialect and its food, among other things. Cincinnati-style chili, a unique concoction served over spaghetti, is a favorite in chili parlors around the area. Cincinnatians also love their sports–especially their Cincinnati Bengals and Cincinnati Reds–so area sportscasters generally have a lot to keep them busy. Notable Cincinnatians include TBS founder Ted Turner, indie rock bands Over the Rhine and The National, singer/actress Rosemary Clooney (and her nephew, actor George Clooney), singer Doris Day, President William Howard Taft, and more professional athletes than can be mentioned here.\n\nAnchoring a metro population of 2.1 million people, Cincinnati is ranked by Arbitron as the nation’s 29th largest radio market, with dozens of high-powered stations blanketing the area with a diversity of formats. Among the top stations in the area are WEBN (Rock), WKRQ ÒQ-102Ó (Top-40) and WLW at 700-AM, one of the region’s most prominent News/Talk stations (and the ÒHome of the RedsÓ). Whether your dream is to be a sportscaster, talk show host, station manager, program director or radio DJ, Cincinnati certainly holds plenty of real-world opportunities to learn and grow–and RADIO CONNECTION can help you connect to those opportunities like no ordinary school can.\n\nWhat is our secret? Through our revolutionary mentor-extern approach, we completely bypass the classroom setting, placing you as an extern in a real radio station from the very first day. You train one-on-one with an experienced radio professional, with all classes taking place Òon the jobÓ, where you will gain plenty of hands-on work experience as well as making important connections with other industry pros. Our results speak for themselves: because our students have constant direct contact with the industry, many of them get hired, some even before they graduate! Enroll in our Cincinnati radio school alternative today, and you could be next."
