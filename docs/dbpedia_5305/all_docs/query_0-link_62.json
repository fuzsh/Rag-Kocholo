        "text": "➦In 1922...WLW in Cincinnati signed-on.\n\nIn July 1921, radio manufacturer Powel Crosley Jr. (above) began 20-watt tests from his College Hill home, broadcasting \"Song of India\" continuously under the callsign 8CR. Powell already owned a number of enterprises, including the Crosmobile and a refrigerator-freezer company, and for many years, he held ownership of the Cincinnati Reds baseball club. Powell was innovative, personally inventing or funding the development of many then–cutting edge technological advances in his ventures which he placed in the able hands of his younger by two years brother, Lewis Crosley who was a graduate engineer from the University of Cincinnati.\n\nOn March 22, 1922, Crosley and his Crosley Broadcasting Corporation began broadcasting with the new callsign WLW and 50 watts of power. Crosley was a fanatic about the new broadcasting technology, and continually increased his station's capability. The power went up to 500 watts in September 1922, 1000 watts in May 1924, and in January 1925 WLW was the first broadcasting station at the 5000 watt level. On October 4, 1928, the station increased its power to 50 kilowatts.\n\nAgain it was the first station at this power level, which still is the maximum power currently allowed for any AM station in the United States.\n\nAt 50 kilowatts, WLW was heard easily over a wide area, from New York to Florida. But Crosley still wasn't satisfied. In 1933 he obtained a construction permit from the Federal Radio Commission for a 500 kilowatt superstation, and he spent some $500,000 ($9.11 million in 2014) building the transmitter and antenna.\n\nIt was the first large amplifier used in the United States for public domestic radio broadcasting and was in operation between 1934 and 1939. It was an experimental amplifier and was driven by the radio station's regular 50 kW transmitter. It operated in class C with high-level plate modulation. The amplifier required a dedicated 33 kV electrical substation and a large pond complete with fountains for cooling. It operated with a power input of about 750 kW (plus another 400 kW of audio for the modulator) and its output was 500 kW.\n\nIn January 1934 WLW began broadcasting at the 500 kilowatt level late at night under the experimental callsign W8XO. In April 1934 the station was authorized to operate at 500 kilowatts during regular hours under the WLW call letters.\n\nOn May 2, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressed a ceremonial button that officially launched WLW's 500-kilowatt signal. As the first station in the world to broadcast at this strength, WLW received repeated complaints from around the United States and Canada that it was overpowering other stations as far away as Toronto. In December 1934 WLW cut back to 50 kilowatts at night to mitigate the interference, and began construction of three 50 ft. tower antennas to be used to reduce signal strength towards Canada.\n\nWith these three antennas in place, full-time broadcasting at 500 kilowatts resumed in early 1935. However, WLW was continuing to operate under special temporary authority that had to be renewed every six months, and each renewal brought complaints about interference and undue domination of the market by such a high-power station. The FCC was having second thoughts about permitting extremely wide-area broadcasting versus more locally oriented stations, and in 1938, the US Senate adopted the \"Wheeler\" resolution, expressing it to be the sense of that body that more stations with power in excess of 50 kilowatts are against the public interest.\n\nAs a result, in 1939 the 500-kilowatt broadcast authorization was not renewed, bringing an end to the era of the AM radio superstation. Because of the impending war and the possible need for national broadcasting in an emergency, the W8XO experimental license for 500 kilowatts remained in effect until December 29, 1942. In 1962 the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation again applied for a permit to operate at 750 kilowatts, but the FCC denied the application.\n\n➦In 1929...KIT-AM in Yakima WA signed-on.\n\nKIT-AM was originally licensed to Portland, Oregon, but the station's original owner, Carl E. Haymond, decided, since Yakima had no radio station, that moving the station there would be more advantageous in regards to serving the community and in generating station operating revenue. KIT began broadcasting on 1310 kHz with 500 watts, but later switched to its present frequency of 1280 kHz so it could increase power to 5 Kw-D, 1 Kw-N.\n\nToday the station is owned by Townsquare Media and airs a news/talk format.\n\n➦In 1942...the quiz show, “The Better Half”, was first heard on Mutual radio. The wartime radio program brought four married couples pitted against each other in various feats to find out which of them was the \"better\" one.\n\n➦In 1948...The Voice of Firestone was the first commercial radio program to be carried simultaneously on both AM and FM radio stations.\n\nVoice of Firestone Broadcast - 1949\n\nThe Voice of Firestone is a long-running radio and television program of classical music. The show featured leading singers in selections from opera and operetta. Originally titled The Firestone Hour, it was first broadcast on the NBC Radio network on December 3, 1928 and was later also shown on television starting in 1949. The program was last broadcast in 1963\n\nFirestone's 25th anniversary program was broadcast November 30, 1953, and it was heard on radio until 1956.\n\n➦In 1999...After WQEW in New York City became Radio Disney in late 1998, WNJR 1430 AM (Newark, NJ) began playing adult standards as Sunny 1430. Julius LaRosa was the morning host, while Johnny Michaels hosted during the afternoon. In March 1999, Multicultural decided to fill the hole and put a Standards format on 1430. WNJR changed its callsign to WNSW June 8, 1999. The station became known as \"Sunny 1430\". They originally planned to switch to this format full-time except for Sunday mornings, but initially would run this format from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to Midnight Saturdays and not at all on Sundays. The rest of the time they ran ethnic programming that was brokered. On Sundays they played Gospel Music and preaching.\n\nDuring the week though they played a Standards format with artists like Frank Sinatra, Neil Diamond, Petula Clark, Tony Bennett, Tommy Dorsey, Peggy Lee, Elvis Presley, Nat King Cole, Pat Boone, The Carpenters, Jack Jones, Tom Jones, the Andrews Sisters, Bobby Darin, James Taylor, the Four Aces, Johnny Mathis, Artie Shaw, The Righteous Brothers, etc. The format was similar to 1560 WQEW's old format. Some of the air people included Johnny Knox (who was program director and operations manager the first year of operation), John Von Soosten, Chuck Leonard, Danny Stiles, Julius LaRosa, among others.\n\nThe Adult Standards were not a big hit and on February 28, 2001 WNSW dropped the format altogether with the playing of Frank Sinatra's Softly, as I Leave You. The format, however, continued with a few evening hours with Danny Stiles. The rest of the day reverted to brokered programming,\n\nIn April 2014, the station was sold to Starboard Broadcasting for $10 million and switched to religious Catholic programming with the branding of WNSW Relevant Radio.\n\n➦In 2011…Radio personality \"Big\" Steve Rizen died at the age of 75 from complications from diabetes . KQV Program Director John Rook brought Big Steve Rizen to KQV Pittsburgh from KTLK in Denver. Steve joined KQV for middays on May 29, 1964. In July of 1965, Big Steve switched with Hal Murray and moved to the morning slot at KQV.\n\nWilliam Shatner is 93\n\n🎂HAPPY BIRTHDAYS:"
