        "text": "Many broadcast professionals say that “Talk Radio” extended the life of AM radio stations all across the United States but how long this will continue is very un-certain. With the emergence of live announcer FM music formats in the 70’s and 80’s, programmers were faced with the question, “What do we do with our aging AM stations?” Satellite transmissions with talk and sports shows, older music and religious programs seemed to provide some answers. New technology is raising the question again.\n\nIn the mid 80’s an article appeared in the local newspaper about the future of WGOW AM. Station Vice President Don Newberg was quoted as being unsure of which direction to take the popular music station of the late 60’s, 70’s and early 80’s. He even suggested the station might be given to a local school.\n\nWGOW AM soon switched to a news talk format. The station had a rebound and became home to Rush Limbaugh until his death in 2021. One reason Limbaugh was so popular, his New York based program aired 12–3 p.m. daily. Radio stations in all three United States time zones could carry the show live and not interfere with their drive times programming.\n\nAt one time Limbaugh’s program was heard on over 625 radio stations surpassing “Arthur Godfrey Time” at 9:00 on the CBS radio network. Godfrey talked about everything with guests and there was live music. In 1963, Godfrey devoted several programs to the assassination of President Kennedy - even offering a prayer for the nation. Godfrey’s program ended in 1972 after 27 years on network radio. Arthur Godfrey aired on WDOD most of that time.\n\nFor a short time the late Don Welch from television hosted a talk show on WGOW. The popular “Sport Talk show” was born on WGOW AM in the late afternoon and evenings.\n\nJeff Styles started at WGOW talk radio in the early 90’s and his programs aired every day for nearly 30 years. Styles' conversations were thought provoking with a lot of humor and he promoted many local artists who appeared at various Chattanooga entertainment venues. Styles' show generated listeners and revenue for the owners. He eventually left the station and started a podcast.\n\nWGOW AM’s popularity continued to rise in the ratings in the late 80’s with the all talk format. “Sport Talk” with the Haskew Brothers aired in late afternoon and evenings. Both men grew up in White Oak and were successful in business but they were also knowledgeable about sports and shared that with thousands during the long running talk show that’s still on the air today.\n\nA few years later, management expanded the all talk format to 102.3 FM boosting the popularity of talk radio in Southeast Tennessee.\n\nWGOW AM and FM has been successful with the “Morning Press,” Chattanooga’s most comprehensive information wake up program. Kevin West, Jim Reynolds and Brian Joyce bring years of experience to the microphone. Later in the morning Max O’Brien Templeton joins the conversation. Templeton retired from the Sheriff’s Office and is a former broadcaster who knows Hamilton County very well. The “Morning Press” keeps listeners informed with timely newsmaker interviews and telephone conversations, both very important ingredients to attract listeners.\n\nChattanooga has had its share of talk shows almost from the beginning starting with WDOD’s Chuck Simpson in about 1939. Station co–founder Earl Winger said they would extend a long microphone cable out of a window from the second floor studio in the Hamilton National Bank Building at Seventh and Market Streets. Simpson would stop those walking on Market Street and ask them questions about current events. Winger said the popular program called “Man on the Street” lasted for several years until Simpson took another radio job outside Chattanooga. He said most of the pedestrians Simpson talked to were very cooperative and liked the announcer’s approach. Nearby Haverty Furniture was one of the sponsors.\n\nDrue Smith also hosted talk shows on WDOD in the early 50’s entitled “The Drue Smith Show” and “Drue’s Party Line.” Ms. Smith moved to television when WDEF signed on the air in 1954. Ms. Smith later re-located to work in Nashville.\n\nWinger said WDOD aired several call in shows in the 40’s and 50’s that dealt with health, gardening and automotive but they were short lived.\n\nWinger said the station was struggling in the mid 50’s and tried a talk show every evening at 9:15 after “Concert in Hi Fidelity” that lasted maybe a year. The owner said, “We caught a lot of flak from lovers of classical music and the talk show was discontinued.”\n\nWDXB AM tried a talk show on Sunday nights in the early 60’s with Larry “the legend” Johnson. “People speaks gripe in” started at 9:00 and lasted until Johnson was finished, usually about 10:30. Johnson was known for his unusual radio promotions but was a good talk show host providing listeners with the opportunity to voice their opinions.\n\nA young Dean Wickersham started to work at WAPO, AM1150 (later WGOW) in the early 60’s and convinced management to air a talk show at 10:00 every morning called “For Ladies Only.” Wickersham said the show was very popular and the station didn’t have trouble getting advertisers. Wickersham said it lasted three years but was replaced by a religious program.\n\nIn 1965, Wickersham convinced WAPO management to start a two-person talk program in the early afternoon, “The Dean and Fran Show.” Wickersham teamed up with Frances Wright, who was station office manager. Wickersham said they had good guests but sponsors didn’t seem to have confidence in a talk format so the show was discontinued.\n\nUnsure of the exact date, WAPO Co–Owner Rice Russell said the station did a talk show with Farrell Faye Seretean Finklestein. She was married to Chattanooga businessman Bud Seretean and daughter of Chattanooga Judge M.B. Finkelstein. Farrell Faye was very popular and had a lot of friends who were her guests. The station was located in the downtown Read House which also helped the host with guests who included Minnie Pearl and Gene Autry.\n\nIn the 80’s, WMOC, 1450 AM tried news, talk and sports for a short time but struggled with the lack of advertising and soon switched to an all Gospel format. WDXB, 1490 AM also had a short run of talk, sports and news.\n\nWJOC AM 1490 (formerly WDXB) now labels themselves “the talk of the town” with Christian talk shows.\n\nWFLI AM recently switched from an oldies format to talk – sports airing the popular Sean Hannity show in the afternoons from 3:00 – 6:00. WFLI is the most powerful AM station in Chattanooga with 50,000 watts.\n\nDavid Carroll points out that in the late 60s and early 70s, Johnny Eagle hosted “Mid South Sounds Off” each weekday morning from 6–7 a.m. (just before Dale Anthony) on WFLI.\n\nAnd in the early 70’s WGOW news director Rick Upshaw hosted “Black Chattanooga” every Sunday night from 8–10 p.m. He later changed the name to “Black and White Chattanooga.”\n\nThe H.H. Wright daily show was on WNOO, probably in the 80’s. Mr. Carroll said “He was very entertaining.” H.H. Wright was a preacher who was frequently seen at Chattanooga City Hall.\n\nOne of the most popular talk shows in Chattanooga that I remember was Sunday Morning Sound Off on WDOD AM and FM which this writer hosted on and off until 2005. In early 1974, the country was experiencing an energy crisis. President Nixon ordered expressway speed limits lowered to 55 miles an hour and the first Sunday in February the country went on “saving time” moving clocks forward one hour.\n\nWDOD station manager Bill Nash called me into his office one afternoon and said this Sunday instead of playing records from 9:00 until 11:00 go on the air and ask listeners what they think of the President’s response to long lines at the gas pumps. We used the stations three main telephone lines and there was no shortage of calls, receiving between 60 and 70.\n\nThe next Sunday morning Mr. Nash gave me more questions and that began one of Chattanooga’s most successful and popular talk shows that aired for 31 years. The program ran most of the time on both both WDOD AM and FM. Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd was a frequent quest and she said she could talk about current issues to most of her district because of the FM station's wide coverage area.\n\n“Sound Off” hosted debates from Sheriff’s candidates, mayoral races and various other political contests. The late J.B. Collins with the Chattanooga News Free Press said he wrote several of his Sunday columns because of the topics discussed on “Sound Off.”\n\nThe name came from WSB Radio in Atlanta who also had a Sound Off talk show on Sunday morning. WLAC in Nashville had a Sound off show in addition to WIVK in Knoxville. In the late 70’s we did a simulcast with all four stations, WDOD, WSB, WLAC and WIVK. I only wish I could find my tape of that broadcast that our chief engineer Parks Hall coordinated.\n\nImportant to management, “Sound Off” had loyal advertisers and the topics made some listeners late to Sunday school and Church. First Presbyterian Church Pastor Ben Haden was late to preach because of comments on Sound Off. The former newspaper executive said, “I just wanted to hear what people were thinking.” Sound Off proved to management that a talk show could attract listeners and be a little profit center.\n\nIn 1985, WDOD started a midday daily talk show named “Viewpoint” that aired right after Paul Harvey News. The program later became known as the “Hey Earl Show” and in 1990 moved to mornings where it ran until 2005. WDOD AM owners never changed the station to full time talk choosing to stay with the “Music of your Life.”\n\nThe midday show resulted in a friendship with the late Ludlow Porch, popular Atlanta talk show host.\n\nWhen struggling to come up with topics, I’d sit in the Eastgate parking lot listening to Porch’s show on WSB and use a few of his subjects on my program. Porch, who was on WRNG and WSB radio for over 30 years, would talk about current events but was very people oriented with subjects of yesteryear, like your favorite pet, first car, local restaurants, barber shops and vacation spots. The Dawsonville, Georgia broadcaster would have to be my all-time favorite talk show host. I told Mr. Porch what I had done and he responded, “Smart guy.”\n\nOne of the most interesting talk programs WDOD aired was with Dr. Jack McConnell, brother of Hamilton County School Superintendent Dr. Sam McConnell. The medical scientist was heavily involved in the development of Tylenol and the MRI and he told us all about those discoveries. Dr. McConnell was so interesting we could have talked for hours.\n\nThe show that produced the most telephone calls was memories of the Tennessee River freezing over in 1940 in downtown Chattanooga. WDEF’s Luther Masingill remembered and said he’d like to have driven his Model T across the ice covered river.\n\nAnother popular topic was the late Edna Taylor saying, “What does Chattanooga need with a massive fish tank?” referring to the Tennessee aquarium. It was those type shows that left listeners on the phones when the program ended.\n\nThanks to the late Jay Craven I can’t forget the interviews with musicians Dave Brubeck and Buddy Morrow. Brubeck, the “Take Five” man, was in Chattanooga in 1990 for a concert with the Chattanooga Symphony. Brubeck passed away in 2012. Morrow, whose big hit was “Night Train,” directed the Tommy Dorsey band at the Tivoli in the early 90’s. Morrow enjoyed coming to the WDOD Studio for the Hey Earl Show and talking with listeners. The trombonist died in 2010.\n\nIn the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s WDEF AM and - when WDEF FM came on the air in 1961 - they injected a lot of talk in their music programs. Luther Masingill’s morning show featured listener call ins but stayed away from most controversial topics. General Manager Ken Flennigan said, “Talk formats scare me, giving listeners free reign over the airway to say anything can be dangerous.” Many stations installed short delays so the host could dump out of the conversation when they deemed it necessary.\n\nMany Christian radio stations have taken advantage of “talk shows” to boost their audiences but there are currently no such locally produced shows in the Chattanooga area. For several decades WDYN AM and FM has been airing “Crosstalk” every afternoon at 3. It originates from the VCY radio network in Milwaukee and is one of the station's most listened to programs.\n\nWMBW, a division of the Moody radio network, has carried short form talk programming for years including “Open Line” at night with the late radio pastor Donald Cole. They currently air Janet Parshall in the afternoon focusing on Christian issues of the day. Those programs originate from the network headquarters in Chicago.\n\nDuring the last 50 years, sports talk radio shows became very popular. Some, mostly AM stations air sports talk program around the clock. Their popularity soars - especially during football season or when there’s a good controversy. The UT Vol sport network has several talk shows associated with their football and basketball games originating out of Knoxville.\n\nChattanooga’s Randy Smith was affiliated with the Vol Network for 20 years and would host a scoreboard call in show after the games. Smith also hosted sports talk shows on various stations from time to time.\n\nWALV–FM 95.3 in Chattanooga airs mostly ESPN Continuous sports talk.\n\nA Saturday afternoon favorite in the 50’s, 60’S and 70’s on WDEF AM and FM was “Hold that Line.” It was hosted by Ernie Feagans, Jolly Cholly Krause, and several other personalities. Listeners could call the station for scores and comment on some of the games. “Hold that Line” generated a lot of revenue for the station.\n\nThere have probably been other attempts in Chattanooga at talk radio. I’m just not aware of them.\n\n50,000 watt news – talk - sport AM radio stations today include WLW Cincinnati, WWL New Orleans, WBAP Dallas Fort Worth, WSB Atlanta, KMOX St. Louis, WOR and WABC in New York,WTOP Washington, D.C., WAPI Birmingham, WLAC Nashville WHAS Louisville, Ky. and now WFLI Chattanooga. The famous WCKY in Cincinnati is all sports – talk and there are many more.\n\nA few manufacturers of new cars are talking about discontinuing installations of AM radios. Radio station owners say such a decision could affect the popularity of talk radio in the future since a lot of time traveling is spent listening to AM radio stations. Some European auto makers have eliminated the AM band altogether.\n\nThere are not many AM radio stations in the United States today programming a strictly music format. Over 20 years ago WSM AM in Nashville floated the idea of changing the 50,000 watt country music station to a talk - sports format. The station dropped that idea after thousands of listeners protested. WSM is the home of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nHaving been a talk show host for half my career I found out quickly this type program is fed by controversy, but callers do like to share memories from time to time. There is the need for variety but “good news” shows can cause listener tune out and don’t get as high of ratings which ring sponsors' cash registers. Reminiscing can be fun and interesting but listeners still enjoy a good old fashion gripe session with a lot of arguing.\n\nThe late Hamilton County Commissioner Curtis Adams was on my talk programs nearly 50 times and that’s more than any other guest. The first time Mr. Adams was on the show he proposed raising taxes and not a single listener was on his side. At the end of the program I thought Mr. Adams would leave and never return. The colorful commissioner said in closing, “Earl I’ve really enjoyed my first time on the radio with you and all the call in’s, I hope you’ll invite me back again.” Was I surprised? Yes, but looking back Commissioner Adams was always controversial and on the cutting edge, but definitely a listener favorite. Just turn on his microphone and the fun would begin. His comments rang the telephone off the wall.\n\nThere are dozens of syndicated satellite fed talk shows for owners to choose but none can compare to a local host sitting before a microphone with the telephone listening to the callers' concerns. I speak from experience.\n\nWith the introduction of the Internet and now podcasts, more and more listeners are tuning in to their favorite host on the World Wide Web prompting the question, “Where does radio go next - especially those AM stations?”\n\nLocally produced talk shows generate the most listeners but require an investment on the owner’s part. Just how much of an investment are owners willing to make? Success can take time, time some investors aren’t willing to consider, but talk shows offer so much potential.\n\nProgrammers are spending hours behind closed doors discussing the future of AM and radio in general, trying to find answers. Are these managers interested in growing the listener base, providing a service and building an audience or just improving the bottom line and making money? There has to be common sense and a balance.\n\nThe words of the late Tommy Jett may be coming true, “Ain’t nothing forever, Honey.”\n\nWhat those of us in the industry refer to as the good ole days may be just that, “the good ole days.” As they say in the business, “Stay tuned.”"
