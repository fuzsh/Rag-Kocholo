        "text": "Yuvika makes a comeback on TV after 10 years\n\nPost leap, we will see a lot of changes in Ek Maa Jo Lakhon Ke Liye Bani Amma. After Urvashi Sharma quit the show, it’s now Yuvika Chaudhary and Ashmit Patel who will be stepping in as Rehana and Faisal on the show. They will take the track forward. The story will be something like the film 'Once Upon A Time In Mumbai' that had Emraan Hashmi and Prachi Desai in lead roles.\n\nYuvika returns to fiction shows after a long time. She started her career some 10 years back with Astitva…Ek Prem Kahani on Zee TV and went on to do films like Om Shanti Om, To Baat Pakki, Naughty@40, Khaap, etc. She returned to TV with Big Boss 9 last year and since then has been trying to come back to TV with some meaty role. She was almost finalized to play Tannu in Kasam but Kratika Sengar was chosen over her. Yuvika has started shooting for the serial and shared her excitement on social media.\n\nAmma being a heroine centric theme was an ideal come back for Yuvika. This is also the fiction show debut of Ashmit Patel. Ashmit is the brother of famous Bollywood actress Amisha Patel and made his debut with Mahesh Bhatt’s Intehaa. Though he did many films like Fight Club, Nazar etc, he failed to make a mark in Bollywood. His only hit film was Murder with Mallika Sherawat and Emraan Hashmi but that did nothing to lift his career His claim to fame was doing Big Boss 4 where he was in news for his on-screen romance with Pakistani starlet Veena Malik.\n\nHe did other reality shows like Superdude on Bindaas but never did anything on mainstream TV after Big Boss. With Amma he gets to play an underworld don on TV. Amma, which premiered on 25 June this year had an ensemble cast of Bollywood actors like Urvashi Sharma, Shahwar Ali and Zakir Hussain with senior TV actors like Aman Verma, Deepraj Rana and Meghna Naidu. The story is of a housewife from Mumbai who becomes an underworld don. It seems Urvashi Sharma was uncomfortable ageing on screen, which is why she quit the show. The show will have a leap and now the story will move with Rehana and Faisal’s love story and their trials and tribulations in Mumbai’s underworld.
