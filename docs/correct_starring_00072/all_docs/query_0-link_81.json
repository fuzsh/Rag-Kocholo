        "text": "Actor Yuvika Chaudhary is under fire for using a casteist slur in one of her videos. In the now viral video, Chaudhary is seen filming a vlog while her husband Prince Narula is getting his hair done. Describing the state of her clothes, the actor made a reference to a certain community of people. The casteist remark has enraged several people who are demanding her arrest.\n\nSource: Twitter/MdToush0786\n\nSource: Twitter/KotwalMeena\n\nSource: Twitter/bahujanhak\n\nSource: Twitter/KingKisshor\n\nSource: Twitter/Profdilipmandal\n\nSource: Twitter/vaibhavkr86\n\nSource: Twitter/WhoisDeepanshu\n\nSource: Twitter/Garima750\n\nAfter the backlash against Chaudhary, she issued an apology on her social media accounts.\n\nSource: Twitter/yuvikaChaudhary\n\nIn the apology, Chaudhary said, “Hi guys I didn’t kw the meaning about that word wt I used in my last vlog I didn’t mean to hurt anyone and I can never do that to hurt someone I apologise to each n every one I hope you understand love you all [sic]”\n\nHowever, people aren’t satisfied with her apology and are demanding her arrest. A tweet said, “You should be sorry but we don't need for this, please arrest this casteist lady ASAP.

(sic).”\n\nSource: Twitter/KotwalMeena\n\nAnother user said, “Sure you did! If you went to a school you knew! Stop playing the victim. Accept that you are conditioned into a casteist mindset. That is the case with most of us. And make the apology specific to the community you offended.”\n\nSource: Twitter/sen_abhik\n\nA few days ago, an FIR was lodged against TV actor Munmun Dutta for allegedly using a casteist slur against a Scheduled Caste community.\n\nChaudhary shot to popularity after she starred in the 2007 blockbuster movie Om Shanti Om.
