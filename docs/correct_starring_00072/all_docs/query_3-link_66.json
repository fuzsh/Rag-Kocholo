        "text": "The makers of Badho Bahu are planning to surprise its audiences by introducing a new twist in the tale. Sources from the sets of the show confirm that there may be a new character thrown into the fray soon, and that the creatives are currently working on it. After much deliberation, the makers have zeroed in on Yuvika Choudhary to be a part of the show.\n\nEven as Yuvika and Prince are rumoured to be a real life couple, the actress will be seen essaying the role of Prince’s cousin in the show. Talking about the development, the source says, “Yuvika’s character is good at family politics. We wanted to challenge the growing fondness between growing between Badho (played by Rytasha Rathore) and Lucky (Prince Narula). Yuvika fit the bill. The makers strongly feel she will do lot of justice to the character. They are trying their best to lure her to sign the dotted line. Yuvika is still bargaining with the makers. If the finances work out, Yuvika will be a part of the show.”"
