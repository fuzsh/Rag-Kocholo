        "text": "Actor Shreyas Talpade recently shared how Shah Rukh Khan envisioned 'Om Shanti Om' to be the biggest film of 2007. The film featured the two actors as friends. To ensure effective marketing for his film, Shah Rukh discussed various strategies with Shreyas while sitting on a toilet pot in a London hotel room.\n\nDuring an interaction with YouTuber Siddharth Kannan, Shreyas recalled how Shah Rukh told him, \"I want 'Om Shanti Om' to be the biggest film of 2007.\" The actor not only voiced his aspirations but also dedicated his best efforts to make Farah Khan's directorial a massive hit.\n\nadvertisement\n\nShreyas reminisced about a day in London with Shah Rukh during the promotions of 'Om Shanti Om'. \"We were sitting in a washroom together in a London hotel room. Deepika was giving an interview outside. And the premiere was in the evening. Shah Rukh was still coming up with ideas. He said, ‘You and I will dance on the red carpet and attract as many people as possible’. He never takes his stardom for granted,\" Shreyas said.\n\nHe added, \"Of course, people will come for his premiere, but he wanted to fight till the last minute to attract as many people as he could. Everything that he did during the course of those promotions was phenomenal. He was sitting on the pot, I was sitting on the bathtub. We were waiting for Deepika’s interview to get over.\"\n\nMoreover, the night before the London premiere of 'Om Shanti Om', Shah Rukh surprised Shreyas by knocking on his hotel room door at 11 pm. The 'Iqbal' actor was stunned to find SRK at his door, and Shah Rukh humorously asked, “Baahar hi khade rakhega (Won’t you invite me inside)?” Upon entering, Shah Rukh unfurled a chart and meticulously detailed the next day's plan.\n\n“He had the entire chart, from when we’d have breakfast to when we’d leave for the press conference. Shah Rukh Khan was doing that at 11 in the night for his film, in London. Someone from his PR team could’ve explained this, but he did it himself,” Shreyas said.\n\nLike many actors, Shreyas also had a delightful experience working with Shah Rukh Khan. \"That man never made me feel that he is a superstar. We were friends on-screen and we were as good friends off-screen. Even today, if he meets me, he will meet me with the same intensity and friendship. It is not formal. He is quite a secure actor,\" said Shreyas.\n\n'Om Shanti Om' indeed became the biggest film of 2007, grossing over Rs 150 crore worldwide. The film also featured Kirron Kher, Arjun Rampal, and Bindu, among others."
