        "text": "Actress Yuvika Chaudhary had shared screen space with none other than Shah Rukh Khan in Om Shanti Om. The actress was also seen in Shah Rukh's Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani where she played the miniscule role of a fan. And of course everyone remembers her journey in the Bigg Boss house as well as her romance with Prince Narula as the two are set to tie the knot soon!\n\nNow on the work front, post films like Om Shaanti Om, Toh Baat Pakki, Naughty @ 40, Veerey Ki Wedding and The Shaukeens, the actress is now gearing up for her next project, a biopic called SP Chauhan.\n\nElaborating more on her role, Yuvika shared, \"I am playing the role of Mr Chauhan's wife who is her husband's strength and she has to go through lot of challenges in life. I'll be seen speaking in a Haryanvi accent and that was a huge challenge for me. I've worked really hard to be in sync.\"\n\nSpeaking about what attracted her towards the role Yuvika quips, \"This film is extremely realistic and is based on the real life of Mr. S P Chauhan who is from Karnal, Haryana. I read a book titled Sangharsh ko Salaam' which is based on SP Chauhan's life and this book talks about the struggles of his life including poverty and his remarkable achievements with his utmost truthfulness. It has really impressed me!\"\n\nShe further adds, \"I am very sure that after watching this film everyone will relate to it in some form or the other.\""
