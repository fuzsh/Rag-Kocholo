There has been national outrage over the suicide of Rohith Vemula, the Dalit research scholar at the university. Rohith, along with four other students, had been suspended by the university over an alleged assault on an ABVP student. An FIR in this regard was also filed against Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya who had alleged in a letter to the HRD ministry that ‘casteist and anti-national’ elements were creating trouble at the university.\n\n“I thought suicides by Dalit students will end with the death of my son. Unfortunately, I had to come twice to University of Hyderabad after my son to attend two more funerals and stand in solidarity with Dalit students,” laments Pulyala Samiah.\n\nSamaiah had come to the university on Friday morning to sit with the protesting students through the weekend.\n\n“I did this when Madari Venkatesh committed suicide six months after my son on November 24, 2013. The HRD, the university and officials are not learning any lessons. After the furore following Venkatesh’s suicide, I thought at least now officials, lecturers and professors, VC and Administration staff will learn their lessons and they will ensure that poor Dalit students won’t be driven to hang themselves or take poison again. But it is unfortunate that one more young life has been lost in Rohith Vemula. I do not know any of the students sitting here on protest today but I have come all the way from Bhoopalapalli in Warangal district to sit with them because I understand what they are going through,” Samaiah, an employee of Singareni Colleries said.\n\nHe says the complaints of students and SC\\ST Teachers and non-teaching staff are the same year after year.\n\n“The number of families of dead victims feeling the need to express solidarity with protesting students is growing every year. Even parents like us with not much education understand that you cannot harass and push a student beyond a point. Officials here should consider the social and family backgrounds these youngsters come from and learn to show minimum sensitivity,” he says.\n\nSamaiah decided not to let his younger son Ravi to take admission in UoH to do BEd.\n\n“The circumstances and conditions here would have killed him too. I admitted him at Nizam College. He is now preparing to write state civil services exams and I keep him away from UoH,” he said.\n\nOn Friday, standing in front of a crowd of students, Samaiah made a poignant appeal to the University to show some compassion and sensitivity towards Dalit students and take steps to prevent more suicides.\n\nFor a long time, Hindi cinema was happy with the Indian within India — living in its villages and cities. Then it started taking the hero-heroine abroad in films that felt like paid holidays for shooting song sequences. Next, Bollywood began focusing on the Indian living abroad, the NRI whose heart and mind seemed to reside back in the motherland. Now, it has moved another step ahead. Ee have Indians caught bang in the middle of geo-political crises: from tracking the Taliban in Afghanistan in Kabul Express to being caught in the civil war-torn Syria in Phantom. Airlift is also about Indians caught in a conflict zone, only that it is based on truee incident. It is about the evacuation of 1,70,000 Indian expatriates stuck in Kuwait after its invasion by Iraq in 1990. Believed to be the largest civil evacuation ever, it was conducted over 59 days involving 488 Air India/Indian Airlines flights.\n\nFilmmaker Raja Krishna Menon fashions a taut, engaging feature film out of an incident which would, on paper, appear to be more worthy of a documentary. It begins at the very beginning, taking us straight to that crucial day in Kuwait—August 1, 1990. We get a quick introduction to Ranjit Katyal (Akshay), a fictional character inspired by two individuals in Kuwait who mapped out the evacuation at that end. He runs a construction business, considers himself a Kuwaiti than an Indian, strongly believes in profiteering and is fast turning a stranger for wife Amrita (Nimrat). A quick cut to the bombing of Al Abdali labour camp, a voiceover explaining the history of tension between Iraq and Kuwait and its escalation to war and the stage is set. In its narrative swiftness, Airlift is structured like one of those Hollywood “rescue thrillers”. It comes to the point fast, with the background conversations establishing the context, be it the oil wars, the American involvement or the reference to a “new boy” in the Indian cricket team called Sachin Tendulkar.\n\nThe characters, their relationships, interactions and transformations hold your attention, especially that of Ranjit and his relationship with Amrita. From confidence to insecurity and vulnerability, from a hardcore businessman to a do-gooder who willingly turns his office into a refugee camp—it doesn’t take a lot of screen time for the shift to happen but Akshay, sporting his salt-n-pepper beard, gives the role all the gravitas he has and turns things believable. Nimrat is her usual easy presence on camera and turns all fiery with assurance when a scene makes such histrionic demands of her. With their relationship dynamics—rediscovering oneself and each other in crisis-the two make a most interesting on-screen couple. There is a warmth with which the director delineates the lazy, red-tapism of Indian bureaucracy and Kumud Mishra as halting, soft-spoken and slow JS Sanjeev Kohli is endearing.\n\nThere are bits which do get too far-fetched, the war scenes, those tanks moving in the desert look tawdrily done and the Iraqi major played by Inaamulhaq with a patently fake accent feels like a typical caricaturised villain of Hindi cinema than for real. Also, after keeping the emotions and melodrama in tight control Menon lets go towards the end specially with the overt patriotic posturing. Is it easy to shirk off your identity? What is home ultimately? Can you feel secure anywhere else other than your own country? Valid questions perhaps that come riding on jingoism, all wrapped up in the tricolour. Airlift would have been a better film without this nationalistic bluster but has a bigger potential at the box office now with the Republic Day just round the corner.\n\nDirector:Raja Krishna Menon\n\nCast: Akshay Kumar, Nimrat Kaur, Purab Kohli, Kumud Mishra, Prakash Belawade\n\nRun-time:125 minutes\n\nWhen war calls, Sikhs answer. With 72 Battle Honours, 15 Theatre Honours, 2 Param Vir Chakras, 14 Maha Vir Chakras, 5 Kirti Chakras, 67 Vir Chakras and 1596 other gallantry awards, the Sikh Regiment is one of the most feared units of the Indian army.\n\nThe history of the regiment spans over 154 years and numerous unparalleled stories of valor that will never be forgotten. The first battalion of the regiment was brought together just before the annexation of the Sikh Empire in 1846 by the British. A fact that’s vastly believed is that the regiment’s heritage has its roots in the teachings and sacrifices made by the Sikh Gurus and has imbibed the fearlessness of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s Khalsa Army.\n\nThe Sikh Regiment fought with extreme gallantry during the 1st and 2nd World Wars under the Royal British Army. Then came the Kargil War of 1999 and the futile mission to capture the Tiger Hill. No points for guessing, the Sikh regiment was called upon for the fatal mission. With the immaculate efforts of sepoys Rashwinder Singh, Sukhwinder Singh and Jaswinder from the 8th Sikh battalion, key heights surrounding the hill were secured and enemy fire was neutralized. Eventually, despite the extremely harsh weather conditions and unending Pakistani fire, the Hill was completely isolated from all the three directions and was soon recaptured. 10 Jawans made the supreme sacrifice during the mission and 48 others were wounded. Tiger Hill has ever since been under the Indian Army’s control. This is just is one of the many wartime bravery stories from the treasure chest of the Sikh regiment. What started from only 2 battalions is now a regiment of 19 regular infantry and two reserve battalions.\n\nWe salute these men!"
