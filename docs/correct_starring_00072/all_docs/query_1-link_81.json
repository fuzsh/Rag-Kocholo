        "text": "Director: Farah Khan\n\nIntroduction\n\nOm Shanti Om (OSO) is a movie that spans a massive amount of genres and themes. It is coined as part of the ‘masala’ genre, which is a melting pot of comedy, romance, and musical numbers with dancing and singing, typical of Bollywood films.\n\nThe film uses parody of classic Bollywood films and scenes dating from the 1950s to late 90s. A famous scene from Mother India (1957). was referenced of the rescuing of the heroine from a burning field. In OSO, Om rescues Shanti Priya when a fire goes out of control on the set which they were filming. Dream Girl (1977) is referenced as well in the large billboard that Om is ‘talking’ to Shanti early on in the film.\n\nOSO is Farah Khan’s nod to the Hindi films she grew up loving mirroring those themes that I will cover in this reflection.\n\nRevenge\n\nRevenge is a common Bollywood theme since the 1980s, while betrayal and murder were prevalent in the 60s and 70s. OSO, on the other hand, covered all three themes. OSO has incorporated all of those themes indirectly gave viewers a look at Bollywood’s history as mentioned earlier in my introduction. One can see the love for the Bollywood classics that Farah Khan has in the recreations of various themes. I thoroughly enjoyed the tacky Bollywood 1970s style action scenes that Om was filming as he fights with the “tiger”.\n\nIn Om Shanti Om, our villain, Mukesh, met his maker when the chandelier fell onto him. A point to note is that Shanti was buried alive in the ground under the same chandelier. The film made a concerted effort to send the message of revenge to the viewers with the location of his death. Furthermore, before Om Kapoor was able to kill Mukesh with his bare hands, the ghost of Shanti stopped him, saying “he’s destined to die, but not by you”. My interpretation is that as the movie emphasized on reincarnation, it is no surprise that karma plays an important part in Hindu beliefs. In this case, Mukesh received the karma he solely deserved dying at the hands of Shanti’s vengeful soul.\n\nReincarnation\n\nOSO further plays on religious themes from Hinduism – Reincarnation or Samsara. In Samara, souls are considered eternal and they are constantly shifting through new bodies in their journey as they progress towards perfection to be in the ranks of the divine.\n\nOm’s name appears as a symbol, ॐ, many times in the movie, it refers to the soul in Hindu religion. Om Prakash Makhija’s reincarnation into Om Kappoor’s body shows that Om’s soul has moved on after his tragic death to a new body into what he has always dreamed of; a famous actor.\n\nPappu’s mention of Om being unable to progress from a junior artist to a superstar was due to his name; ‘Makhi’ stood for housefly in Hindi. It can be noted that Om’s reincarnation after was to that of a tiny little housefly to a household name that he had always dreamed of becoming.\n\nRomance\n\nSo in the film, Om Prakash harboured feelings for Shanti- unrequited at the beginning since they hadn’t met during then- and these feelings literally went beyond life and death- and logic. Why I say so is because after Prakash’s death and when his spirit gets transferred into Om Kapoor’s body, upon realizing who he was in his past life, Kapoor- or Prakash- schemed a comprehensive plan to get back at Mukesh for both his and Shanti’s death in their past life.\n\nPrakash/Kapoor’s feelings for Shanti were symbolized poignantly by the snowglobe that Shanti showed Prakash during the first half of the film; which was shown later in the film to be pretty much intact from the fire that killed both Prakash and Shanti. This to me, signified that their love is able to withstand all sorts of adversity.\n\nRemix!!!\n\nFarah Khan’s background as a choreographer really shines through in the enchanting dance numbers and singing throughout the movie. True to the stereotype of Bollywood, plenty of singing and dancing is involved in OSO. Many meaningless dance numbers (cue badminton and yellow hard hat outfits) were included and were totally out of context, which was hilarious and confusing at the same time.\n\nHowever, one poignant dance number was from the song, Dastaan E, where Khan tells the entire story of OSO in this musical number reminiscent of Phantom of the Opera. If only I knew this was the case I would not have sat through the movie for three hours and jumped straight to the musical item!\n\nRevolution or Regression?\n\nThe portrayal of women in Om Shanti Om was based on the stereotype of women being weak and helpless. Shanti was a damsel in distress, while Om was her knight in shining armour. In fact, she was placed in the same situation twice. The first time she was trapped in the fire was during a set where the main actor backed out and refused to jump into the fire to save her – not following the script at all. Om, seeing how the love of his life was at risk, braved the flames to carry her out.\n\nThe second and final time was when Mukesh set the building on fire to kill her. Om attempted to save her again but failed. Instead of looking for alternative ways to escape, Shanti merely screamed for help both times. It is indeed an irony, for Om Shanti Om was directed by a female director, Farah Khan.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis being my virgin Bollywood film, OSO, despite its marathon three-hour length- typical in Bollywood- was a great introduction for me to Bollywood films. Bollywood films are so culturally and fundamentally different in its approaches to filmmaking that I felt the need to point out its introduction to me; as compared to other Asian genres and Hollywood films.\n\nFarah Khan’s journey of the themes, historical scenes and references of iconic Bollywood scenes throughout OSO taught me a large amount of what makes Bollywood, Bollywood. I see the attraction that it holds especially so for the large Indian market who love music, dance and themes of love."
