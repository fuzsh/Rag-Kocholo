        "text": "Known as one of the beloved couples of the entertainment industry, Prince Narula and Yuvika Chaudhary never stop showcasing support for one another. The couple, who have been married for five years, are often questioned about having a family and recently the actress once again opened up about the pressure she has been experiencing of becoming parents.\n\nYuvika Chaudhary opens up about pressure of becoming parents after marriage with Prince Narula; says, “We have been planning a child since we are married”\n\nIn a recent interaction with ETimes, Yuvika Chaudhary revealed that they have been planning to become parents since their wedding but as of yet there hasn’t been any news and that they respect God’s decision. “Before marriage, people persistent…'shadi kar lo (get married)'. Thereafter, they get on to you with, ‘when are you having a kid’. No one asks, when are you getting a diamond (laughs). We have been planning a child since we married, but it is in god’s hands, and we do not question his plans,” the actress added.\n\nWhile Yuvika Chaudhary and Prince Narula have always been supportive of their friends’ parenthood, the couple has maintained that they would be having children whenever their fate permits.\n\nFor the unversed, Yuvika Chaudhary and Prince Narula met on the sets of Bigg Boss 9 in 2016. While the couple flirted during the show, many believed that their pairing was only for camera. However, their relationship continued with the couple tying the knot in October 2018.\n\nOn the professional front, Prince Narula has returned to his Gang Leader chair in Roadies. The reality show star is currently the Gang Leader in Roadies 19 along with Rhea Chakraborty and Gautam Gulati with Sonu Sood as the host. He is currently shooting for the show in North India. On the other hand, Yuvika Chaudhary continues to juggle between her films and OTT projects. She was last seen in the web series Cyber Vaar (2022).\n\nAlso Read: Photos: Yuvika Chaudhary, Arjun Bijlani, Gaurav Bajaj, Sharad Malhotra launch Made in India Pictures’ MIIP Film Festival\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
