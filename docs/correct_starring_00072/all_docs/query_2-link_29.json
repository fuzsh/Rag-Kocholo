For me it was a very fascinating thing that I would be playing this role.\"\n\nWhen asked the reason for choosing this film, she said, \"Because this film is based on real life of SP Chauhan who is from Karnal, Haryana.\"\n\n\"I read a book \"Sangharsh ko Salaam\" which is based on SP Chauhan's life and it talks about his huge struggle and remarkable achievement with his utmost truthfulness. It has really impressed me So this is was the first spark to get into this film.\"\n\nShe further added, \"I am very sure that after watching this film everyone would relate themselves with this film for sure.\"\n\nApart from Yuvika, the film also stars Jimmy Sheirgill, Yashpal Sharma and others in prominent roles.The release date of the movie will be announced soon."
