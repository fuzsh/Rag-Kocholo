        "text": "We all have that movie which we love no matter our age. It might be Marry Poppins or any of Disney’s and Pixar’s lot, maybe it was a classic from old Hollywood, or a foreign film which name you couldn’t remember for years, but found again. None-the-less you love it unconditionally, even though you see the flaws as adults, but it doesn’t matter, it still makes you smile.\n\nA bit of context. This was one of three Hindi films that got me to descend in to the rabbit hole of Indian cinema. I had listened to the music for a while, but not really known where or even if I could watch them and I was hard in to musicals and anime at the time (partly am still, but Indian cinema has mostly taken over). Then while searching the internet I found three movies that would make me accept Indian cinema and never look back: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, and this, Om Shanti Om. The timeline on which came first is a little hazy for me, but it all happened six years ago during high school, a period of my life which is more bitter than sweet. I’ve always loved musicals, from the West End, to Broadway to even those of continental Europe (mainly France, Italy and Austria), that’s why I think it was inevitable for me to get in to Indian cinema (as for say one who doesn’t). You needs that dispel of belief to watch them, to appreciate that it takes a lot more work to sing, act, dance and do all varied things one show after another than your usual man-against-the-whole-world-philosophical stuff, which is nice and will get you praise from critics, but it’s not that entertaining if you’ve seen so many performances like it before and it’s just depressing in an already depressing world. If you’ve had a bad day or are going through a rough patch in life than those kinds of “entertainment” are not for you, no matter who bought the tickets beforehand and the “but it will expand your thoughts and is deep” argument that always annoys me! I want to be entertained, dammit, not be more depressed!!!\n\nSo back to the movie. The reason I think of this as a sort of childhood movie is because of it was one of the first. I was young and didn’t know as much as I knew (what little of it) of Indian cinema as I know now. In a way it’s a perfect beginners movie for Indian (specifically Hindi) film, introducing the tropes, the structure, and much more in an entertaining package as well as songs you cannot stop singing not matter how hard you try.\n\nSo finally the plot summary:\n\nIt’s the 1970s, Om Prakash Makhija is a wannabe Hero in one of many the studios in Bollywood, but he is merely a Junior Artist (an Extra in Hollywood terms). He is in love with Shantipriya, an actress for whom he pines from afar. He and his best friend Pappu get a chance to meet the star and he becomes friends with her. One night as Om Prakash Makhija (I’ll just call him Om PM from now on, it’s easier) is in the studio lot and he sees Shantipriya trapped by fire which is intended to kill her and goes to save her. In the end he is hurt and dies at the hospital, but his soul and body is reincarnated in the child of the prestigious film family that saved him who I name for the sake of non-spoilers as OK.\n\nSo years later OK is living the high life as a Hero, when his memories start slowly coming back to him, and it’s up to him as well as who looks like Shantipriya’s reincarnation Sandy to avenge Shantipriya’s death by making the movie which was never made when she lived called Om Shanti Om. Laughs, tears, and great music ensue!\n\nSo, first off. This movie is VERY META in terms of Hindi film culture and history, there is a little of Southern inclusion as well (anyone know of any Southern films with cowboy hats and tigers in the 70s?? I’ve yet to know what that joke references). As a first time watcher, unless you are already into Indian cinema, won’t get them all. Heck, I didn’t! But I still loved it. I watched it again for this review and I got at least more than a did before, which makes it a great movie to re watch every now and then just to see if you can see all the details in the background or get that joke this time. I still haven’t got them all, but it deepens your understanding of the film, because in the end it’s a heartfelt satire of the 70s and 2000s film industry in general.\n\nAnd the film is a satire in the purest sense, joke after joke, but not forgetting the emotions that draw us in. Like pushing buttons inside us, cleansing us of all unhappiness unless we are meant to feel so from the screen. It’s a good movie in the sense that it does so. A fantastic one if you want to be entertained and cleanse all unhappiness for a while from your body and mind, no matter how depressing the world may look.\n\nIn an interview to celebrate the films 10th anniversary when in an interview with Farah Khan, the director, was interviewed by Anupama Chopra who said that there was an interview at the time of the movies release where Shahrukh said “This is a Hindi film made by fans of Hindi film. Farah is the biggest one and I’m a close second” (man, that sentence was a mouthful). And it shows, that’s why I keep on writing on the meta, because it’s a big part of the enjoyment on repeated viewings. Each time you are lead on more on the “inside” jokes and the emotions always get you, its hard to be cynical while watching it. Even listening to the music is pure enjoyment.\n\n(One of the first references in the movie is to this from the film Karz (1980) starring Rishi Kapoor, really setting the mood for the whole movie. A little bone for you whom I’v left without posts for a while because of school!)\n\nShahrukh Khan as Om PK / OK does what he does best, be the King of Romance as well as play the double roles (really triple if you think of it) that he did when he was still young in the early 90s. The double role is a tradition rooted deep in the Indian filmiverse as by the belief in reincarnation (like the old Hindi classic Aradhana (1969) and the new very well made Telugu Eega (2012)). He has fantastic delivery of the lines. My favourite is the one when he just says “Takhliya!”, his voice going a pitch or two higher, his face all dramatic, it is a treat. He does it so sincerely, letting himself be laughed at, but also laughed with as he goes from one melodramatic scene to another. And yes, this movie made me fall in love with Shahrukh! Its almost impossible not to with the amount of charisma he has, even as Om PK, we all come to love him in the end. I personally fell for him when he and the utterly charming Shreyas Talpade as Pappu reminiscence of Shantipriya’s first movie where she sang a little song that went “Salaam, salaam, salaam” it’s all very cute as they recreate the steps and sing together. The two of them have great chemistry, though I truly wish there was more Shreyas Talpade in it, he is so good and cute, you remember him afterwards and that is truly a mark of great acting.\n\n(Why Shahrukh is my favourite! He can act, yes, and is a wonderful person in real life, but he is also very gracious with his body on the screen, having no qualms in showing it and for making me realise there was such a thing as the Female Gaze. Though I think the latter is more thanks for Farah Khan, a woman, for making this film with this sequence in it without apologies or coyness. A true role model for us all!)\n\nMaking her Hindi film debut is Deepika Padukone as Shantipriya / Sandy (her voice being dubbed by Mona Ghosh Shetty for ???reasons??). When Shantipriya she is that distant star you wish you could reach, being beautiful, kind and talented. A real Dreamy Girl. She has a good cast around her, being the classy star with the charisma of the old-world, but she really shines towards the end. As you can see from my ‘first movie’ list it was inevitable for me to fall for Deepika as well, because she is in every one of them and the reason she is my favourite actress in Hindi cinema today.\n\nBut really this movie – what I’ve said a thousand times here – is the love letter to movies and Hindi film in general, as well as the people who make it what it is from the stars to the spot boys. Sure, it has flaws that I can sense, but every time I watch it and just stop looking for them, letting myself enjoy this story purely for what it is. That is the power of sincere emotions and innocent enjoyment one can only remember when watching something from one’s childhood.\n\n(One of the best songs from the movie. Showing all the work that goes in to making magic on-screen, but it doesn’t diminish the magic of the fleeting moment that it is there. And Shreyas Talpade being the best wing-man ever!)\n\nOn another note, this movie beats Avengers: Infinity War in terms of crossovers, and this movie was made in 2007 when such a thing wasn’t even taken in to consideration in Hollywood. There is a song sequence in the second half of the film where 31 Hindi film actors show up named ‘Deewangi Deewangi’. There are old stars, there are new stars, there are stars that are no longer in the public eye and 2 of the 3 King Khans, but Saif is a really a Prince (in real life) so he counts as well. Oh, to be in the theatre when this song came about…!\n\nIt’s really amazing how they pulled everyone in for it. As one YouTube commenter writes:\n\nUsman K\n\n“Avengers Infinity war is the greatest crossover in history”\n\nBollywood: Hold my beer…\n\n(Can’t name them all? I can manage a little over half or 70% of the faces from the top of my head. No worries, just watch more Indian films or look at Wikipedia, whatever you want to)\n\nSPOILERS ARE FORTHCOMING SO BE WARNED! THIS I A WARNING IF YOU WANT TO BE FREE FROM THEM TO WATCH THE MOVIE!\n\nGoing in to spoiler territory I just want to look a little deeper in to the film. I partly think this movie is a comment, or at least tells, how the movie business has changed from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\nWarning, this might ruin the movie for some of you so be warned! Personally, I feel it adds depth to it, because it’s so easy to miss on the first watch, this all coming from a movie directed by a woman who wrote the script as well I’m not surprised it has all these undercurrents.\n\nTo start of Om PK talks to the largest billboard poster of Shantipriya’s movie Dreamy Girl, around it are posters of other movies as well as ads for food. One of them is of Sholay (1975) with the comment of Still Running (hah!), which as a side thought makes perfect sense that this movie is taking place about 1977 in the first half, so really its plausible for Karz (1980) to be filming at this time, especially considering the shooting times could be very long indeed with years apart until the film could be complete and released. Or maybe I’m trying to justify the time logistics in a movie about reincarnation? Who cares! Let’s move on.\n\n(As seen in this song sequence, the billboards are all about movies)\n\nNow on to the culture of the 1970s Indian movies. Om PK says that Shantipriya got her debut in the “Salaam, salaam, salaam” movie when she was sixteen. And at the time starting young was the only option for those girls who had to feed their family, or who had no other respectable job to do with such an age, and by the looks of it she was either taken/bought from her family or they are dead (I prefer the latter). Arjun Rampal as Mukesh Mehra (I’ll just call him Mike, everyone in Hollywood does) when arguing with Shantipriya that he made her a star. So it’s very possible he took her under his wing at possibly 15 or 16, maybe even younger, and has made her a star to benefit him as she needed a job.\n\nWhen Shantipriya wants him to come to her before a shoot is about to begin it could easily be the sign that he has made her rely on him in everything from such a young age that she feels she cannot do a certain shoot unless he is there to tell her some words (its unclear what happens in the tent, a kiss, an encouraging word, a threat. We don’t know, but we can only guess). Now Deepika Padukone was 21 when the movie came out, so if we take this to be Shantipriya’s real age, which means she has spent 5 years or more working and in a sick way groomed by Mike for his own ends. They’ve had sex, that what she reveals in the argument, that she is pregnant (queue dramatic music!). She seems so reliant on him its hard not to think otherwise. We are given hints that a star is what Shantipriya has become, but seeing her affiliating so much with Om PK and with other Junior Artists in group sequences, even dismissing her Hero’s lewd comment before the fire sequence tells that she does this all for a job, but she enjoys it as well. She is seen with other stars, but they are in the background and she always has this distant aspect about her in those sequences. When she and Mike fight she clearly wants to make their relationship public so that she can be his wife. He tells her that no one wants to come and watch a married actress (clearly because of the unavailability to the male audience with their fantasies in the seats. Ugh!). Shantipriya just wants to be a wife and mother, but he is forcing her to work, and in the end he kills her because it’s easier for him to clear her out of her life permanently than to have himself do the right thing and marry her (though it would hardly ever be a happy union). Even in the 2000s sequences with the in-movie actress Dolly (who looks to be about Shantipriya’s age when she died) he feels her up and clearly wants her to be his next Shantipriya in a way. He is a predator through and through, especially with the unseen grooming old men do to young girls all over the world (the “when she turns 18 we’ll date, be official, or that she is jail-bate” is just disgusting reasoning for pedophilia). Mind you this has happened and is still happening all over the world, in all cultures and especially the entertainment industry, but it doesn’t mean its right.\n\nAnd yeah realising the whole debut at 16 and then years later pregnant and that Mike was the one who “made” her took me a while to realise and go Oh! And Ugh! Again, woman director and script writer. This why there is a need for them in every film industry!\n\nIt really shows in the film that he is distancing himself from her to look for a marriage of profit (the wedding gift is to be a film studio), he is not in the premier of Dreamy Girl or in any other set sequence other than those he is needed to show how charming and evil he is, but he is always there in connection to Shantipriya.\n\nReally, in the scenes where Shantipriya is with Om PK and Pallu is when she is most happy as we see in the song in the empty studio. Enjoying the magic of it all, even giving Om PK a gift of a snow globe to show her gratitude for saving her from before. When Om Pk says after it that we all have that one person we love more than anyone in the world (he means her), her face turns sad, thinking no doubt of Mike. He has done his job too well, she loves him. That is the tragedy of it all, along with her unborn child, to be killed by Mike, someone so unworthy of her love and devotion.\n\nThankfully as seen from her eyes and Deepika’s fantastic acting that in the end she realised that Om PK was more in love with her, respecting her, shyly stammering, trying to make her happy in the only way he knew how, the magic of movies on a soundstage they both know well as a place to call a second home to work for something they love, perhaps even bringing back her innocence that she knew in childhood. He tries to save her, but fails. Though if one thinks, him being so happy for her, respecting her wishes, sensing something is wrong and trying to make her happy away from work, and her trying to find him and spending time with him is the greatest gift she has received. She doesn’t realise it until her demise, but she has slowly starting to free herself from Mike’s clutches, going out undercover to see a man who saved her for a simple ‘date’, like a child sneaking out, except she uses a burqa to do so.\n\nIn the end of the film she stops Om PK / OK from killing Mike, saying its her vengeance that must kill him, and she is right. He took her innocence, used her and discarded her and her child in the fire. She is the one who drops the (literal) chandelier on him, killing him, and thus being able to find peace at last. Perfect ending for her.\n\n(I just want to cheer you all up after that depressing reading/analysis, so here is this! A happy Shanti! A happy Shahrukh!)\n\nNow on to the 2000s. The industry has changed along with the billboards. No longer are handprinted posters on them along with food ads, but ads for expensive things like Tag Heure watches (whose brand ambassador Shahrukh actually is). Of course the obvious product placement is one interpretation, I mean Indian films are quite honest with it before the movie even starts, its endearing rather than annoying as long as its used right. But also to show how distant the movie stars have become themselves, but still so close.\n\nOK has everything and he has all the power in the industry just by being a star. He can be late for sets, he can change the script, he can order a song to be made and he can call cut. He has all this, and when Sandy comes in to the picture he doesn’t act like Evil Mike, who starts touching Dolly as I wrote before, she smiles, but doesn’t give him anything in return (the natural action taught to girls from birth, smile, then the evil man will go away, don’t be argumentative or they’ll be angry at you or hurt you). So for Dolly’s actions to be so limited and not to protest is not against her character, its protective instinct. OK notices Mike’s touching and I have a feeling its he who limits their interactions on purpose, knowing Mike’s true nature.\n\nSo back to Sandy! He uses his power for good. The girl faints in his arms more than once (its Shahrukh, any red-blooded woman would), he chastises her for not taking pretending Shantipriya seriously, but Pallu gently reminds him that he has to tell the truth for her, after all she doesn’t know the real reason for the charade. He tells her the truth and kisses her on the forehead, very platonic, but caring. Other than the mission they don’t interact much even in a romantic way, he even kisses her on the forehead at the end of the movie, still very protective and caring. When Mike begins to argue to Shantipriya (her ghost whom everyone thinks is Sandy) OK insists that the charade is at an end and that she should go. He wants only protect her. Indeed he is the anti-Mike, he doesn’t groom her (indeed she is as well is 21 by the looks of it ) and there is no talk of another job other than the one they are on. Indeed the ending is open for interpretation for what happens next. And I think that’s good. This was after all Shantipriya’s story as told by Om PK and OK, but both change throughout the film to better people and know what really matters. For Om PK its Shantipriya’s life more than fame, for Shantipriya it’s for her to know there are other roads in the world as well as good people who look out for her, for OK its to stop being a jerk star and remember what is important, films and the lives they change (in the industry and out of it), and in the end Sandy changes from a fangirl to a Heroine who can make the world whatever she wants it to be. No man will control her and certainly not Om PK / OK. He will most certainly help her, I’ve got the feeling, but the decisions will always be hers.\n\nThroughout the second portion we see star actresses being good friends with the men on the set, especially at the ‘Deewanagi Deewanagi’ sequence. There are many stars, women and men alike, not just a select few. In the song all women are worshipped and treated equally. And the joke before the Fimfare awards is about how all the women are ‘just good friends’ with OK, a little humour on the fact that Shahrukh can romance anyone, but really it’s just the truth that they are ‘just friends’ in real life and reel-life. Only women that are sexualised are the back up dancers in the ‘Dart-E-Disco’ sequence, but in the end it’s Shahrukh who is more a feast for the eyes than the women.\n\n(Yeah the afro’s and animal print are a whole another discussion on race and ethnicity in Indian films, but that’s for another day. Thank goodness its short)\n\nWow! Over 3,800 words! I had more to say than I first thought."
