M. Vetticad said that the film is \"engaging to begin with, but as it rolls along it becomes clear that it falls in the ‘if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen ’em all’ category of underworld dramas.\"[7] Pallabi Dey Purkayastha of The Times of India wrote: \"With a tighter, finer screenplay and more consistent performers, ‘The Power’ could have been a befitting response of this decade to the Sarkar franchise but a lacklustre narrative, among other things, brings the power down to level zero.\"[8] Samrudhi Ghosh of Hindustan Times wrote: \"The Power, with its creative bankruptcy, brings nothing new to already done-to-death iterations of The Godfather.[9] Joginder Tuteja of Rediff.com noted, \"If the film had been crisper with solid drama in the second half too, The Power could have been more powerful.\"[10]\n\nAnurag Sharma from Republic World wrote \"While an attempt was made by the makers to show a crime world and mafia story in a different light, they have ended up repeating the old storyline, only with unnecessary twists. Even though some of the actors made a strong effort to hold the fort from their end, it has only gone in vain.\"[11]\n\nMusic[]\n\nThe music for the film was composed by Salim-Sulaiman with lyrics written by Kumaar .
