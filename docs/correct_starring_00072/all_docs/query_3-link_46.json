        "text": "Synopsis\n\nPeople might brand Prince Narula's proposal to Yuvika Chaudhary as a publicity stunt, but the actress says his feelings for her are real.\n\nMUMBAI: People might brand Prince Narula's proposal to Yuvika Chaudhary on \"Bigg Boss Nau\" a publicity stunt, but the actress says his feelings for her are real.\n\nThe \"Om Shanti Om\" actress becomes the latest contestant to be evicted from the controversial reality show and Yuvika said Prince's behaviour after her elimination was announced makes her believe the genuineness of his feelings.\n\n\"I felt he was genuine, he also said I was real. He looked very upset while I was leaving the house. He could not even muster the courage to come and hug me. He was looking at me from far. Had he been acting, he would have easily come to meet me one last time, thinking now she is going and it is okay',\" Yuvika told PTI.\n\nReality TV star Prince was one of Yuvika's closest friends in the Bigg Boss house and she feels he has strong chances to win the game.\n\n\"I was closest to Kishwer (Merchant), Suyyash (Rai), Prince and Rishabh (Sinha). I think Kishwer and Prince are strong players. At the moment, I feel they can win.\"\n\nThe actress was not expecting her own elimination so soon and thought she would stay on the show because of the new \"liking\" angle between her and Prince.\n\n\"I thought I wouldn't go this time, as in the last two-three days this angle came up, of liking... I felt people would not let me go now. Everybody felt that. It happened suddenly, no one thought he would confess his feelings for me. I seriously thought it would be either Aman Verma or Digangana Suryavanshi's turn to go this time.\n\n\"But, I think now people inside will up their game as they will think if Yuvika can get eliminated, anyone can.\"\n\nYuvika added she is open to be back on the show.\n\n\"I would love to be back as a wild card entry. The response from my fans over my eviction has been amazing. I would want to be back for them,\" the actress said.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n4 reasons why MFs are stocking up on CreditAccess Grameen and other microfinance lenders\n\nOnce declared dead, Nifty Next 50 is up 70%.
