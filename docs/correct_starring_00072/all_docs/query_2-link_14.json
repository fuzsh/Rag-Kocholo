        "text": "After playing a top notch actress in Shah Rukh Khan's Om Shanti Om, actress Yuvika Chaudhary will be seen playing a star again in the upcoming film The Shaukeens.\n\nAlso credited for movies like Naughty @ 40 and Enemmy, Yuvika will now be seen in The Shaukeens, one of the highly anticipated comedies of the year featuring Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor, Piyush Mishra, Lisa Haydon and Akshay Kumar in a special appearance.\n\nThough she has a guest appearance in the movie, she was delighted on being approached for the part and was more than pleased to work with director Abhishek Sharma, who has earlier helmed the much-acclaimed Tere Bin Laden, said a statement.\n\nYuvika also said that she felt honoured to be working with such an ensemble cast.\n\nThe Shaukeens is a remake of the 1982 Basu Chatterjee movie titled Shaukeen, featuring Ashok Kumar, AK Hangal, Utpal Dutt, Mithun Chakraborty and Rati Agnihotri in prominent roles."
