But I will not create controversies,” the actress said.Yuvika, started her career on the small screen with TV soap “Astitva…Ek Prem Kahani”. She has starred in Bollywood films like “Om Shanti Om”, “Summer 2007” and “Toh Baat Pakki”.The actress said she is entering the show with a clear mind and does not have any strategies in place.”I am not prepared because I don’t know anything. But that is the fun. I have no plans. I am just going to be myself.”\n\nYuvika said her mother is really excited to see how she deals with difficult situations on the show, which will require her to do all the chores by herself.”I have always been very pampered. I have never done any household work. My mother is happy as she says that I will learn to do my own work. It is going to be like a hostel life,” she said.”Bigg Boss Nau”, which airs on Colors, will see Salman Khan return as the host for the sixth time."
