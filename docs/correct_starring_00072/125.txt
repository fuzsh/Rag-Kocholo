Yuvika Chaudhary has come a long way from being a struggling actor in B-town after her entry in the industry through the reality show Cinestars Ki Khoj in 2004. A small role in Om Shanti Om catapulted her into the big league. The 28-year-old also acted in films like Summer 2007 and Toh Baat Pakki. Chaudhary's Punjabi movie debut was in Daddy Cool Munde Fool (2013), which set the box office registers ringing.
