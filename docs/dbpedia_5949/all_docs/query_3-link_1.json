Henri Le Rocque's arrival to an island village causes much consternation when he insists upon advanced rental for the land he owns. Accompanying Le Rocque is his nephew Paul, recovering from the effects of an unfortunate love affair. One day, little flower girl Fleurette visits the Le Rocque estate to make a present of a rare flower and is shot as a trespasser. She is nursed back to health at the mansion, and Paul falls in love with her. However, her former sweetheart, Jacques, appears and persuades Fleurette to run away. As Fleurette returns to the village, she learns that the villagers are planning to storm the mansion and, realizing that she loves Paul, rushes back to warn him. This endears her to Henri, who urges Fleurette to marry his nephew and bring happiness into their lives.",
