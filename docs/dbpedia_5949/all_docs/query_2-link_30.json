        "text": "An office worker is alone at night with just the cleaner vacuuming around him when his computer randomly turns off. Frustrated at not being able to access his work, the computer starts up again by itself and offers him three wishes. Unable to make the message go away he asks the computer to stop the sound around him. The sound suddenly disappears with the cleaner nowhere in sight. Still in denial, he asks the computer to make him rich. Seconds later he hears the lottery numbers being announced on the radio. They match the ones on his ticket. Now intrigued he realizes he only has one wish left. He thinks long and hard before finally choosing the perfect wish."
