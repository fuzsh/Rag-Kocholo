        "text": "Sampler by: Grandma Luigia, Italy 1897\n\nI have been in a steady relationship lately with my heart’s desire. A body sense of how speaking Italian was a heart’s desire came to me in a Wholebody focusing session with my partner. It let me know that learning Italian would be something that would change my life for the better. This awareness happened soon after I filmed Bruna Blandino and Rosa Catoio, two Italian Wholebody Focusers, (Being Ourselves) for the blog.\n\nLiving a Heart’s Desire\n\nWhat I also began to understand that day was that learning Italian was not something that I had to “do.” It was something that lives in me. So this experience started me on a journey to give this body sense all the time and space it needed. (My Heart’s Desire).\n\nI began attending focusing workshops for Italian focusers through The International Focusing Institute and partnering with some participants. These experiences led me to go to Italy to study in a language immersion program and attend a focusing conference there.\n\nI am experiencing what it is like to contact my maternal language more deeply. A few days ago, as I was reading some straightforward, known Italian phrases, I found my mouth would not cooperate. I had an excessive amount of trouble pronouncing the words. I paused and asked my body to show me what was needed. My hands went to either side of my face and held those muscles gently. Then I began to reread the phrases slowly. There was still difficulty pronouncing the words, but less so this time. What was showing up was the flip side of a heart’s desire.\n\nA Heart’s Desire and a Lost Language\n\nFor 26 years, I taught or administered language programs to train Spanish-speaking students in NYC to fully develop their mother tongue relationships. NYC schools had a policy of supporting the home languages only until the student became fluent enough in English. The lack of continued instruction in the mother language left many students with interrupted literacy in both English and Spanish and low confidence in their Spanish-speaking ability. In high school, rules mandated that students learn another language. I was part of a team of teachers and administrators who designed and piloted high school programs to bring these students to full academic literacy in their home language.\n\nIn this process, I learned how much trauma having one’s maternal language suppressed caused and how it often relegated these students to the category of “at-risk student.” When students studied their home language for at least three years at the high school level, however, they often became the top students in their schools.\n\nHolding A Heart’s Desire and the Prohibition with Equal Regard\n\nThe felt sense in the muscles of my mouth reminded me of the trauma my students experienced. I embodied the experience of the loss of my mother tongue by becoming a language educator and advocating for immigrant students’ linguistic rights. For me, Italian was spoken in my home as a child by the adults around me. My parents, however, feared that if I learned Italian, I would suffer the same prejudice and academic challenges that they had faced in school as children. Because of my family’s experience, I worked in my profession passionately. I became a national leader of this movement to support language rights for immigrants in schools. (You can view some of my work at( ESL and Bilingual Ed).\n\nNow that I am retired, my body tells me it is time to do this for me. I already speak Spanish. Italian seeps out of my mouth when I am in an Italian-speaking atmosphere. For example, the filming session with Bruna and Rosa or on the streets of Rome. It has not been a conscious experience. I did not have a measurable fluency in Italian, just a few magical moments when I found myself speaking Italian. It was not something I could consciously conjure up at will.\n\nWhen I experienced difficulty pronouncing simple Italian words, I realized it as a felt sense. I also became aware that following a heart’s desire is not just a joyous forward movement. It may include holding space for what prevented me from naturally speaking my family’s language. Something might show up as a heart’s desire because it has not fully manifested in one’s life.\n\nWhat is Unknown\n\nThere is a lot of not knowing how speaking Italian would benefit me; however, some valuable bodily experiences emerged. A burning sensation in my left hand helped me feel how the loneliness of exclusion from family discussions affected me. The adults around me had a secret language that prohibited me from learning. It enhanced the feeling that I was not entirely a family member. As I wrote this sentence, a full-body sense came over me—a combination of nausea, fear, and breathlessness. I stood and allowed these sensations time to process until they eventually diminished. I expect more felt senses will emerge as I continue to hold space for learning more Italian and now for not learning Italian.\n\nWhen I embarked on this journey of my heart’s desire, I didn’t expect to meet its doppelgänger. It is, however, not surprising that both are there—the heart’s desire to speak Italian and the prohibition to speak it. My body has been screaming with all sorts of symptoms lately—nausea, breathlessness, aching joints, burning hands, and the inability to control the actions of my mouth.\n\nHow to Move Forward\n\nThe more time I give my body to experience itself in grounded presence, the more this bodily sense will emerge. I stand and let my body move in its way. Spiritual help comes from my ancestors. The part suffering from speaking Italian becomes aware of itself. My hands respond to my request for my body to comfort the suffering part. Gently, My right hand gently holds my left hand while I lie down. It is very soothing for my whole body. This position softens the bodily discord I experience.\n\nI have become aware of this background “felt sense.” My ability to learn a language by listening to my caretakers, a natural part of one’s earliest human experience, was stopped cold. Consequently,to speak or not to speak Italian, both parts of me need my attention, compassion, and regard.\n\nIn two weeks, I will be in Italy for 18 days in a situation that will require me to speak Italian most of the time. However, I am and will be holding space with equal regard for my suffering self and my heart’s desire. This awareness is what I was promised—that my life would change for the better as I lived this experience.\n\nN.B. I use the phrases mother language, mother tongue, and home language interchangeably. They refer to the language spoken by the parents or guardians of a young child.\n\nTo leave or read a comment, click here and go past the end of the post.\n\nSubscribe to Blog via Email"
