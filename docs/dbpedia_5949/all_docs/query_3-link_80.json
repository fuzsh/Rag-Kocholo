Even though I don't go out much, I had to make sure whenever I did step out I was looking good from head to toe. Just as the song ended I got a incoming call from Jayda.\n\n\"Hey boo, where you at?\" She asked\n\n\"Hey girl, on the way to the mall, You know I have to get a birthday, and graduation fit. Where you at?\"\n\n\"At the house, why you ain't ask me to come to the mall with you? Fake ass bitch..\"\n\nI laughed \"Bitch.

Birthday's don't even feel the same anymore.\n\n\"You heard from Marco ass?\"\n\n\"Who?\" I said playing dumb and she laughed\n\n\"Bitch don't play stupid.\"\n\n\"No I haven't heard from him. I wouldn't be surprised if Saint off'd his midget ass foreal.\" I said nonchalantly\n\nShe bussed out laughing before catching her breath.\n\n\"Bitch you evil. Don't act like you don't care bout ya man now.\" She cackled\n\n\"Girl, fuck him. Once the word hoe came out his mouth he was dead to me.\"\n\n\"It's okay, your new nigga saved the day.\" She said being funny\n\n\"Here you go again, I don't even know him like that.\"\n\nI said laughing\n\n\"Not yet, but when you end up with what's his name... East\" She paused to laugh \"Ima be like I told you so hoe\"\n\n\"See now you being funny. I was never calling him that shit, you know I don't play nicknames with these niggas\" I said making her laugh. I was always calling niggas by they government, you not bouta make me call you what everybody else does. That's whack"
