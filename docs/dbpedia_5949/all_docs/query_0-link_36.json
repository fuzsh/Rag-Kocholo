        "text": "Positive Messages\n\na lot\n\nHonesty is the best policy. Don't let anyone stop you from doing what you love or being with whom you love. Perseverance will help you achieve your goals. Family members may not always understand one another, but it's important to keep trying. Parents should support their children's dreams -- even if they're different from what they envisioned for them.\n\nPositive Role Models\n\nsome\n\nJess and Jules are smart, brave, and athletic. Jess works hard to juggle her family's needs with her own and is willing to sacrifice her own desires for those of her sister and parents. Her father is empathetic and attuned to his daughters' moods. Joe is patient and wants to put in the hard work needed to build a successful relationship. On the other hand, Jules' mother acts in racist and homophobic ways, and her behavior is largely excused -- she never changes.\n\nDiverse Representations\n\nsome\n\nDirected by a Punjabi Sikh woman who grew up in West London, the film centers around a British Indian Punjabi Sikh family living in Hounslow. Plenty of wonderfully specific references, but they can border on stereotypical -- immigrant parents balk at their daughter's wearing shorts, don't want her playing soccer, say things like \"what greater honor is there than respecting your elders,\" and want her to learn to cook and get married to a nice Indian boy (but not a Muslim, they make clear). One of Jess and Jules' teammates is Black -- she and all the women on the soccer team are confident and non-stereotypical. Disability representation via the main character, who has visible leg scarring from a childhood burn (based on the actor's real history). Another main character has visible scars from knee surgeries. But LGBTQ+ aspects are outdated: When a friend comes out as gay, Jess reacts poorly, responding, \"But you're Indian!\" and makes her friend sweat before finally concluding that his sexuality is \"OK with her.\" And a mother's fears that her daughter is a lesbian are played for comedy, excusing her homophobic behavior.\n\nDid we miss something on diversity? Suggest an update.\n\nParents need to know that Bend It Like Beckham is a romantic sports comedy that follows a British Indian teen, Jess (Parminder Nagra), who just wants to play soccer -- though her immigrant parents have other ideas. The movie has strong themes of friendship, teamwork, and courage, as teens learn to be honest and parents learn to support their children's interests and dreams. Expect some swearing (including a few uses of \"s--t,\" \"bitch,\" \"hell,\" and slurs like \"Paki,\" \"d-key,\" and \"lesbo\") and innuendo, as well as kissing and characters who fight over the same person. Several teens have a beer or a glass of wine, but they drink responsibly and are of legal age in the United Kingdom and Germany, where the scenes take place. Jess hides her soccer-playing from her family and lies to protect her secret, but ultimately she's a driven, ambitious woman who follows her heart's desire. The film stood out for its positive portrayal of a Punjabi Sikh family, especially in 2003 when it was released, but its stereotypes about immigrant parents feel more obvious today, and the way LGBTQ+ material is handled is even more dated.
