Ulali blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas, incorporating political, social and personal issues that affect all of humanity. By fusing outside influences with Native words and music, Ulali challenges notions of how \"traditional\" words and concepts are applicable in the modern world. The group can be heard on dozens of albums, documentaries and movies."
