But you'd be a fool to do so. This faux saccharine surface belies a superbly written and wonderfully understated and evocative piece of filmmaking with a great cast of talented actors and visuals so beautiful—they belong in a gallery.\n\nIndyRed Ever so slowly (Or maybe not that slowly) things changed. A lot…Let me just say that Desires of the Heart switches the perceived genre quickly, and not just once. Some films attempt to change genre styles to baffle and blow away the viewer, in an attempt to hide a flawed script. Not here. Desires of the Heart is expertly written and translated to the screen in a brilliant way.\n\nThe Independent Critic Desires of the Heart is a beautiful and involving film featuring two fine performances by its leads who are tasked with bringing to life a film that is both intelligent and fantastic, no small task. Desires of the Heart challenges both heart and mind with a story that is culturally grounded, somewhat mystical in nature, and yet psychologically insightful.\n\nUK Film Review Desires of the Heart begins, in many ways, like your typically idealistic romance movie, and it's easy to write it off as such.
