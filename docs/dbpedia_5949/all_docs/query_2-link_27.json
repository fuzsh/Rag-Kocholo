All humans are born with the same desire—we want love, joy, peace, and abundance. The only problem is, very few of us ever find them. In a world filled with so many people with unmet desires, it’s no wonder why we feel so alone.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nThe truth is…\n\nThe stories we have always been drawn to (and perhaps thought were mere entertainment) have actually been invitations from God.\n\nThey aren’t just stories, they are whispers from our Father, and He wants us to hope in His promises.\n\nA BRAND-NEW WAY TO EXPERIENCE GOD.\n\nA BRAND-NEW WAY TO EXPERIENCE\n\nGOD.\n\nDiscover God through your favorite stories.\n\nWith references to The Dark Knight, The Hunger Games, Friends, and dozens more, you’ll see your favorite stories in a brand-new light.\n\nFeel connected like never before.\n\nGod is the Author of your story, and He is actually the cry of your heart. He wants you to know His character, and He wants you to know His love.\n\nExperience the love, joy, and freedom you seek.\n\nYou are living in a story unlike any other. Once you open your eyes and step into this reality, God will give you the desires of your heart.\n\nOrder The Book\n\n\"My life’s mission is to create IMPACT, and I always encourage my clients to do the same. Bob’s words in this book will do exactly that. Not everyone grew up in the church, and many of us don’t know where to begin, but Our Hearts' Desire is a great primer for anyone who wants to begin their walk with God. I would recommend this book to anyone.\"\n\nFounder of Fitness Quest 10; personal trainer on NBC’s STRONG; author of Get Your Mind Right; host of the IMPACT Show podcast\n\nTodd Durkin\n\nYou don’t have to feel alone\n\nANYMORE.\n\nYou don’t have to feel alone\n\nanymore.\n\nThe love, joy, and peace you seek are now within your reach.\n\nAt this point, you might be thinking to yourself “Look, I’ve tried everything… what good is reading a book going to do?”\n\nAnd I get it! Trust me. That is exactly how I used to feel about life. No matter how good I thought I had been, no matter how hard I tried, I could never seem to shake my feelings of loneliness. My heart felt empty, lost, and desperate for affection. I was searching for something, and I wasn’t even sure what that was.\n\nBut not anymore.\n\nThat is the reason I wrote this book—I have finally found the desire of my heart, and I want you to find it too. I want you to experience the same transformation, and I want you to find the same joy. How do I propose to do this, you ask? Simple.\n\nI want to open your eyes to our story.\n\nAt this point, you might be thinking to yourself “Look, I’ve tried everything… what good is reading a book\n\ngoing to do?”\n\nAnd I get it!

As an author, podcast host, and former professional athlete, I’ve been blessed to live a multi-faceted life. Before I wrote Our Hearts’ Desire, I played minor league baseball for the Toronto Blue Jays and the St. Louis Cardinals. I played baseball in dozens of states and multiple countries, and I chased what many would call a childhood dream. However, I can honestly say that God wasn’t my focus.\n\nAt that point in my life…\n\nREAD MORE"
