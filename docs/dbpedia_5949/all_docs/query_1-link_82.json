Intertexts of Murmur of the Heart propose variations as regards gender and fantasy, with particular focus on George Bataille's Ma mère and its filmic adaptation by Christophe Honoré, on Anges Varda's Kung Fu Master!, and Bertolucci's Luna. Turim critiques how psychoanalysis has in the past treated sexuation and suggests an updated approach that rectifies outdated and erroneous assumptions about queer sexual development, as well as revising the Oedipus complex. Throughout Turim considers the films’ aesthetics, a gentle embrace of an art cinema style that remains entirely committed to emotive narrative and is therefore softer and more accessible to a larger public than are the more demanding and trenchant experiments with form that other art cinema pursues. Their young male protagonists become the edge that sharpens this softness, for the process of sexuation in adolescence is not mild or easy and remains daringly depicted in both films. These art films speculate on the logic of desire and the force of fantasy, allowing us to think philosophically about the specificities of the complex relationship of situated ethics to fantasy."
