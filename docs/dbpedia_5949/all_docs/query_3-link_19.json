        "meta_description": "Jim Carew, a lighthouse keeper, saves New York socialite Ethel Wyndham from drowning after a boating accident, and falls in love as he nurses her back to health. However, she turns down his marriage proposal because of his working-class status. Despondent, Carew aimlessly leaves the East and ends up prospecting in the Yukon. While striking it rich in Alaska, he begins a romance with an Indian woman, Little Snowbird, but before settling down with her, he decides to take one last look at life in the big city, and returns to New York City. At a restaurant there, he sees Ethel, and immediately tells her of his success and proposes once again. Ethel is tempted to accept him until Thomas Martin, who has involved her in a blackmail operation, threatens to expose her if she marries Carew. Once again brokenhearted, and disgusted with her character, Carew returns to Little Snowbird, only to find that, believing that he would never return, the Indian girl has committed suicide just hours earlier.",
