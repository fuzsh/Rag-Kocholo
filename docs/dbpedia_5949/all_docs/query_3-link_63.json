        "text": "1983\n\nCity Locations\n\nCleveland, Ohio; Toronto, Ontario\n\nLocation Types\n\nMansions, Retro, Schools/Colleges\n\nLocation Styles\n\nDated/50's-60's-70's Building, Parking Lot, School\n\nAbout A Christmas Story\n\nFor most people, âHome Aloneâ is one of the most nostalgic and beloved Christmas classics. However, long before a young Macaulay Culkin commanded our holiday viewing list, Peter Billingsley did the honors in âA Christmas Story.â\n\nReleased in 1983, the film is partially based on a handful of anecdotes that Jean Shepherd penned for the 1966 publication âIn God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash.â The production also features elements from âNight of Golden Memories And Other Disasters,â released by Wanda Hickey in 1971.\n\nStarring Darren McGavin (Mr. Parler), Melinda Dillon (Mrs. Parker), and Peter Billingsley (Ralphie Parker), Bob Clark directed the heartwarming movie while Shepherd lent his voice for the narrations. Set in the early â40s, the premise centers on 9-year-old Ralphie and the series of challenges he encounters leading up to the big holiday.\n\nAll he wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder Action Air Rifle which is naturally on the list of forbidden gifts in their household. In the days leading up to the Yuletide, Ralphie has a brush-in with the neighborhood bully, drops by the local department store for a chat with Santa Claus (Jeff Gillen), and connives his way trying to get his heartâs desire.\n\nThe movie is filled with sweetly sentimental, hysterical, and touching moments. Itâs widely cited as the film that shaped the holiday genre because unlike other movies before it, âA Christmas Storyâ doesnât shy off from tackling the subject of commercialism, bad luck, and disappointments.\n\nThe film performed decently at the box office but it didnât stick around for too long. It gained a resurgence as the years went by and soon became a holiday staple. 14 years after its release, TNT and TBS started airing annual telethons of the movie dubbed \"24 Hours of A Christmas Story.â\n\nThe Library of Congress also gave it the stamp of approval in 2012 for preservation under the United States National Film Registry. The reason is that the film is aesthetically, historically, or culturally significant.\n\nA Christmas Story Locations\n\nSet in Homan, Indiana, Hammond, Indiana, where Shepherd grew up, inspired the fictional location. The townâs name also borrows from Hohman Avenue which is one of the major streets found in the Lake County city.\n\nShepherd and Clark decided to vaguely date the film to the late â30s or early â40s. Thereâs never a specific year mentioned but the copy of The Look magazine, where Ralphie hid the Red Ryder BB Gun ad, was the December 1937 issue. There are also other instances when 1940 comes up but the filmâs year mostly remains amorphous.\n\nThe film mentions several places that were an integral part of Shepherdâs childhood, including Cleveland Street and Warren G. Harding Elementary School. Thereâs also a reference to Northern Indiana, Lake Michigan, and the Indianapolis 500.\n\nWith these places and time inferences in mind, Clark reportedly had locations scouts perform recces around 20 cities to find the ideal filming location for A Christmas Story. He eventually settled for Cleveland to film the movieâs exterior scenes.\n\nToronto, Canada also served as the setting for some of the filmâs scenes. The 2008 fan-made documentary âRoad Trip for Ralphieâ revisits all the filmâs production locations. Having been partially filmed in Canada, the film received two Genie Awards.\n\nIn one of the filmâs opening scenes, we see Ralphie spot the Red Ryder BB Gun at a local department storeâs Christmas display window. The narrator set the scene by saying âHighbeeâs Department Storesâ corner window was traditionally a major high-water mark of the pre-Christmas seasonâ¦Kids were brought in from miles around just to see the window.â\n\nLocated in Downtown Cleveland, the now-defunct Higbee's Department Store is among the reasons why Clark settled for Cleveland as the primary filming location. Most of the department stores scouting for the film werenât willing to open up their doors to the A Christmas Story production team. Bruce Campbell, who was Highbeeâs Vice President at the time, welcomed the film crew to his premises on one condition. He reworked the script a bit for cursing, and ultimately, the department store served as the setting of several scenes in the film. In 1992, Edward J. DeBartolo, who acquired Highbeeâs in 1987, sold his stake in the business, and the store rebranded as Dillardâs. It operated as Dilliardâs for a decade before later developments transformed the building into the Horseshoe Casino.\n\nGiven that Higbeeâs exclusively operated in Northeast Ohio, the department store Shepherd referenced in his book as well as the film is most likely the now-defunct Goldblattâs. The discount store was located in Downtown Hammond, just three doors away from the also defunct Cam-Lan Chinese Restaurant along Sibley Avenue.\n\nLong before targeted social media ads and TV campaigns reigned, marketers relied on magazines to drum up sales for their products. Itâs best displayed in the scene where Ralphie sets his eye on the Red Ryder in a publication referred to as the âBoyâs Lifeâ in the film.\n\nRalphie reads out the sales text, âYes, fellows, this two-hundred shot carbine action air rifle, just like the one I used in all my range wars, chasinâ them rustlers and bad guys can be your very own!â\n\nThe filming location of A Christmas Story is located at 3159 West 11th Street, Cleveland, Ohio. Brian Jones, who is perhaps the filmâs biggest fan, dropped $150,000 on the purchase of the house in 2005. He spent another $350,000 on renovations to restore the interior and exterior to how they appeared in the movie.\n\nThe âA Christmas Story Houseâ expanded in 2006 with the inclusion of a museum opened right next door. Thatâs where youâll find archives of props and costumes used during the production of the film, including some of the Highbeeâs toy displays and Randyâs (Ian Petrella) snowsuit.\n\nBest still, you can book the residence for a festive overnight stay to recreate the holiday spirit exuded by the film. Bus #81 will get you to the iconic filming location.\n\nThe Homan Christmas Parade is one of the most iconic scenes from the film. Ralphie and his family were amongst the crowd watching the parade flow along as the sounds of jingle bells filled the air. The narrator explained that it stirred an idea in Ralphieâs mind. âNow it is well-known that foolish men stuff themselves with pillows and other such devices, it is equally well-known that the real Santa Claus can be found at Higbee's Department Store in Hohman, Indiana.â\n\nThe public square located right outside Highbeeâs made its cameo for the parade scene. Found in downtown Cleveland, the central plaza is modeled after an 18th-century New England locale, and it remains an essential element of the cityâs center.\n\nThe crew filmed the parade scene at night, given that the Federal Building and Erieview Tower were glaringly visible during the day. It was the same case for the ongoing construction of the BP Tower (200 Public Square) during the production period.\n\nIf you are planning on visiting the A Christmas Story location, check out the event calendar to drop by when thereâs something exciting happening at the square. The square hosts year-round events ranging from outdoor concerts to product launches and the legendary Winterfest holiday kick-off party.\n\nThe Red Line and bus 9, 19-19A-19B, 53-53A, or 3 will get you there.\n\nOne of the relatable and hilarious scenes in the film takes place on the school grounds during recess. After an exchange with Schwartz (R. D. Robb ), Flick (Scott Schwartz) took on the mightiest of all dares, the triple-dog-dare.\n\nThe narrator explained, âSchwartz created a slight breach of etiquette by skipping the triple dare and going right for the throat.â\n\nRalphieâs school was yet another landmark location used during the production process. Coupled with the Cleveland and Toronto locations, it helped create the âA Christmas Storyâ word. The Ontario-based Victoria School, situated within St. Catherineâs, stood in for Warren G. Harding Elementary School. Several of the learning institutionâs students also participated in the filmmaking process as extras. They shaved their hair in a â40s style to match up the actors and reflect the filmâs time setting.\n\nHowever, the freezing temperatures and snowy weather made the production process a nightmare and once the crew wrapped up the interior school scenes, they vacated to a Toronto-based sound studio. The snow eventually eased up and they managed to finish filming the exterior scenes of the school.\n\nVictoria Public School is no longer in operation but the building that housed the learning institution remains unchanged while functioning as a womenâs shelter.\n\nThe scene where Ralphie's family goes to a Christmas tree lot is another warm and fuzzy moment from the classic movie. It mirrors a Christmas tradition that most of us can relate to, as drawn out through the difficulties of settling on the perfect tree.\n\nThe narrator captured it in one sentence, âBuying the Christmas tree was always only after long and soul-searching discussions.â\n\nItâs yet another scene from âA Christmas Storyâ that was filmed in Ontario, Canada. Online sleuths suggest that it must have been around 232 Queen St W which is right near where youâll find the Toronto symbol.\n\nToday, the locale functions as a parking lot, and the CTV studios are located right around the corner, at 299 Queen St W. Given that itâs smack in the middle of the city, you might also want to check out the Chippawa Volunteer Firefighters Association. Thatâs where youâll find the vintage truck, dubbed the Chippawa Fire Truck, that responded to the scene when Flick got his tongue stuck on the pole.\n\nA breakdown of the iconic filming locations of A Christmas Story isnât complete without mentioning Chop Suey Palace. After the dogs ruined the Christmas turkey, the Parker family ended up at the dining establishment.\n\nLocated at 744 Gerrard Street East in Torontoâs Chinatown, the restaurant that hosted the production team is now known as the Batifole. They must serve a mean French dish because their Google rating is pretty good.\n\nThe scene where Ralphie stands up to Scut Farkus (Zack Ward), the neighborhood bully, and gives him a proper beating was recorded at 6 4 Sears Street in Toronto. Just east of the location is where they filmed the earlier scenes when Farkus and his cronies chase Ralphie down an alley."
