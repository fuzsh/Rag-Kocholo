        "text": "If you've ever daydreamed about alternate paths or wondered how you can find peace in today's rat race, this book is for you. You can find your true calling where God's grace and the daily grind meet.\n\nMany of us follow a seemingly arbitrary and rushed path to a paycheck. Once you're out of school, whether it's high school or college, you're expected to go to work. You work hard to pay your dues. Then, one day, you feel stuck. You feel restless and like a mercenary…the \"it's just a job\" mentality. Soon, these feelings of alienation and cynicism spill over into the rest of your life.\n\nClapper goes beyond the usual career counseling formula in Living Your Heart's Desire. He explains why it's more helpful to understand the theology behind work, calling, and human freedom. You'll discover a variety of visions of what it means for you to lead a life of Christian faithfulness in all realms of existence. You'll be equipped to understand yourself as a Christian in the workforce as well as understand how to be content — no matter what you do for a living — among the discontented.\n\n\"We must ask if the life we are living is a worthy expression of gratitude for what God has done for us,\" Clapper writes. \"Our most important response is the shape of our entire life. It is, in short, our vocation.\"\n\nEasy to read and relevant to today's economy and world (with many references and lessons from movies), this book can help you lead a more fulfilled, rewarding, and joyful Christian life — regardless of how you earn a paycheck. Discussion questions at the end of each chapter make this perfect for small group discussions.\n\nLearn to see your \"Office Space\"-like world as a Spirit-filled and vital calling in Christ. As one reviewer has said, Living Your Heart's Desire will help you \"understand the connection between faith of the head and faith of the heart, as well as the next step on your faith journey.\" Take comfort in knowing that God has a plan for your life. Revel in it."
