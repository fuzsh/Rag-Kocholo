        "text": "Biography\n\nThe first time author Catherine Lanigan ever submitted a manuscript was to a creative-writing professor during her freshman year of college. Following a terse review of her work, he squinted his eyes, grimaced, and told her point-blank, \"Your writing stinks, you'll never make a living as a novelist...but I'll make a bargain with you.... I'll get you through this class if you promise never to write again.\"Catherine still remembers the impact of that crushing blow. Fortunately for her hundreds of thousands of fans worldwide, that moment was the spark that ignited a graceful determination which fuels her remarkable career today.One of the publishing community's most prolific and eloquent literary voices, Catherine Lanigan is the author of over 15 books, including the wildly popular Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile, which preceded the blockbuster films of the same names.In addition to the commercial success of her books, Catherine Lanigan's work strikes a profound visceral chord with her readers. Many of them write her frequently, sharing deeply personal insights about their own lives and why they are inspired by the female characters in her books.Catherine Lanigan's protagonists are self-empowering women who, despite stunning obstacles, build an internal arsenal of wisdom, courage, and dignity that enable them to finally be true to themselves. They embrace change with aplomb, grit, and grace even though deep down, they may be frightened stiff.For Catherine Lanigan, these are the characteristics of a real heroine, a woman who, given a certain set of circumstances, makes choices that enrich who she is inside, and as a result, the world around her. This passionate perspective comes from a powerful place of experience. The trials and triumphs of her characters are engraved with her own initials.Unfulfilling marriages, the tragic birth and loss of a child, single parenthood, financial struggles, career disappointments, personal and professional betrayals, and her self-made rise as an author comprise the fertile soil of her own life from which Catherine creates her stories.\"I would like to believe that for each woman who picks up one of my books, if her life is in turmoil or chaos, something in the book will help guide her through the turmoil,\" says Catherine Lanigan. \"I hope my books are a catalyst, a gentle yet firm push, in the right direction.\"On a lighter note, Catherine Lanigan is as recognized for her culinary acumen as her literary achievements. In each book, Catherine features her own unique recipes throughout the stories. Cooking is often a segue from one scene to another, with key characters concocting succulent dinners, scrumptious desserts, and naughty late-night snacks. At the end of every book, readers are given an address where they can write Catherine directly to obtain the recipes. In fact, her Epicurean adventures have become so popular, that she is currently in the process of finishing a cookbook.Catherine Lanigan was born and raised near Chicago, Illinois. She currently lives in Houston, Texas."
