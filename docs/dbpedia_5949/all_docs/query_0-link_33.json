        "text": "Carol Ann Duffy, the British poet laureate, is almost unknown in this country, which makes her no worse off than blood pudding, haggis or Marmite. Britain and America are no longer divided by a common tongue — for 50 years or more, we have been listening to British music, watching British television and welcoming British writers as warmly as we once welcomed Dickens. Still, most poets don’t travel well; apart from an oddity like Seamus Heaney or Derek Walcott, poets are rarely known outside their home countries (worse, they’re rarely known outside their hometowns).\n\n“Rapture” is a book of love poems first published in Britain in 2005, when it won the T. S. Eliot Prize. Any reader not a complete misanthrope will give a love-struck poet a good deal of leeway, since in the grip of love we’re liable to say all sorts of silly things, making promises that should never be considered binding contracts. (“ ‘I will love You forever,’ swears the poet,” Auden wrote. “I will love You at 4:15 p.m. next Tuesday: is that still as easy?”) Duffy is a peculiar variety of Homo amans, gassing on about the ups and downs of love without ever giving a convincing picture, or any picture at all, of her beloved. There’s a forest, see:\n\nI followed you in,\n\nunder the sighing, restless trees and my\n\nwhole life vanished.\n\nThe moon tossed down its shimmering\n\ncloth. We undressed,\n\nthen dressed again in the gowns of the\n\nmoon. We knelt in the leaves,\n\nkissed, kissed; new words rustled\n\nnearby and we swooned.\n\nWe swooned! (When was the last time a poet swooned? The autumn of 1878?) Duffy is particularly susceptible to this fairy tale of love, the trees ever sighing, the moon whipping up more gowns than Givenchy.\n\nThe laureate needs the full-blown LSD Technicolor version of love, where “I part the leaves and they toss me a blessing of rain,” where “love spins gold, gold, gold from straw,” where the “birds stitching the dawn with their song / have patterned your name” (isn’t that “Cinderella,” the Disney version?). A little of this goes a long way, and a lot goes nowhere at all. Between the dogged rhymes and doggerel sentiments, the stuttering repetitions (“your name / rhyming, rhyming, / rhyming with everything,” “Take this . . . / and this . . . and this . . . and this . . . and this”), the poems punch-drunk on monosyllables and the frequent helium ascent into Victorian diction, the poor reader isn’t sure just which century he’s in: “I want to say / thee, I adore, I adore thee, / and to know in my lips / the syntax of love resides, / and to gaze in thine eyes.” Anyone trying to channel Elizabeth Barrett Browning at this late date is asking for trouble. When the love affair is eventually smashed to pieces, the reader feels not schadenfreude but relief.\n\nDuffy’s new book, “The Bees,” has most of the tics of her love poems; but they don’t have the excuse of coming from someone intoxicated by a long swig of Love Potion No. 9. The poems are made no better by giddy lists of images (“the moon a diet of light, sliver of pear, / wedge of lemon, slice of melon, half an orange, / silver onion” — they’re phases, get it?) and the mindless natter of Old English alliteration (“No folk fled the flood, / no flags furled or spirits failed — / one brave soul felled. / Fouled fortune followed”). It’s one thing to be drunk on sound (or love, for that matter), another to let your style be nothing but its twitches.\n\nThe poems take their sources from myth, ancient literature and modern war (as well as bees, bees, bees). Yet why should Scheherazade’s tales be reduced to childish jingles (“Forty thieves in a crowd, / bearded and bold. / A lamp rubbed by a lad / turning to gold”), or the death of the falling soldier in Robert Capa’s terrifying Spanish Civil War photograph be commemorated by an Irish jig?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
