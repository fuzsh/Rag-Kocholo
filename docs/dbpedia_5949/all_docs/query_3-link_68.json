        "text": "I am the founder and main author of the international synth pop magazine Electrozombies, which was founded in 2010 as a niché music video blog for synth pop and genre-related music. Since my childhood I have been a devotee of melancholic, gloomy electronic music. Started in the late 70s with minimal electro band Kraftwerk and become a real synth pop fan through Depeche Mode's hit 'People Are People' in 1984."
