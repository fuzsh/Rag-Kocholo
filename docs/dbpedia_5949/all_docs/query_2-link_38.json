Drake Barrett was the vessel's powerful captain-and a cynical duke who disdained a noble's shallow life.

But Drake dreaded the day of their rescue-when his love would discover that the virile man she adored was at the pinnacle of the aristocracy she despised.  Hardly did they suspect the base treachery that would soon threaten them...and the dangers each would brave to join forever their hearts and lives!",

He took off his shirt, then tossed it carelessly onto the chair. Alex gasped and turned her back.
