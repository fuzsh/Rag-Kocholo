There she meets diverse inmates that evoke shadow characters in Tennessee Williams' play and people from his real life. As identities blur, secrets are unlocked and questions are answered but all is not as it seems, for the woman who convinces us she is Blanche is not. Rather she is a Blanche of today lost in the tragic world of Williams play and emerging from the post-Katrina landscape of New Orleans and the cities, such as Detroit, where survivors were scattered. Ultimately Unlocking Desire is a wholly original work, transformative, poetic and intelligent; a story with a new purpose that will surprise and entertain as it provokes and moves audiences\n\nFeature length Drama/Mystery/LGBTQIA+.\n\n2022 marked the 75th anniversary of the 1947 premiere of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire.
