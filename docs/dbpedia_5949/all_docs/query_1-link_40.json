        "text": "My mom introduced me to The Secret six years ago. She tried to introduce me to it sooner, but I thought it was stupid at the time. Then, when was seventeen years old, I became depressed when my boyfriend broke up with me. I had to get out of the depression so I watched The Secret and read the book. After watching and reading, I realized I had attracted my boyfriend into my life initially by praying we would be together. In the same way, I had pushed him away by thinking negative thoughts that he would start to see my flaws. And he did. I had brought the situation on myself!\n\nTo make myself feel better, I began singing, exercising and dancing around in my room. I began to feel popular and empowered instead of feeling like no one liked me. Within three weeks I had attracted friends and a new, better boyfriend! I began to have fun with life and quit complaining and feeling bad about myself.\n\nI also attracted the experience of dancing on the table at my favorite restaurant. I imagined telling my friends about how I danced on the table. At the end of my meal, imagine my surprise when our waitress grabbed my hand and invited me to dance with her and the rest of the staff!\n\nI also attracted my husband after 11 painstaking months of dating losers, following a break up with my ex-fiance. I realized I was attracting bad dating experiences because I was relying on other people to make me happy. I would feel depressed and mad when they weren’t texting or calling me. I was also complaining to my friends and family, crying and posting whiny statuses on Facebook. My attitude was pushing away romantic partners instead of attracting them like I wanted. I then realized I was lucky to have friends and a car, and that I was in college and had a really charmed life. When I began to relax and just feel happy and not feel desperate for a relationship, my husband came into my life! Our song at our wedding was “Not a Moment Too Soon” because I feel that God brought us together at the perfect moment.\n\nIt’s simple! You have to feel happy and empowered! And don’t let any contradicting thoughts for what you want to attract enter your mind. You have to know you will achieve something, not feel desperate for it and not wish for it. But feel good, think about it, then let go and let God. I remember going to church and listening to the preacher say that God will give us what we want before we even ask. One time, I kept singing a hymn to myself in my head and imagine how happy I was when I walked into church and the band was singing that song!\n\nI am in the process of attracting a new career, a new car and new jewelry! I’ll write a story when these things all happen. These are just some random anecdotes that I hope will inspire someone out there!\n\nThank you to God and to Rhonda for bringing this knowledge to everyone!"
