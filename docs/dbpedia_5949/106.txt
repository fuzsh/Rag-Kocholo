UK Film Review Desires of the Heart begins, in many ways, like your typically idealistic romance movie, and it's easy to write it off as such. But you'd be a fool to do so. This faux saccharine surface belies a superbly written and wonderfully understated and evocative piece of filmmaking with a great cast of talented actors and visuals so beautiful—they belong in a gallery.

IndyRed Ever so slowly (Or maybe not that slowly) things changed. A lot…Let me just say that Desires of the Heart switches the perceived genre quickly, and not just once. Some films attempt to change genre styles to baffle and blow away the viewer, in an attempt to hide a flawed script. Not here. Desires of the Heart is expertly written and translated to the screen in a brilliant way.

The Independent Critic Desires of the Heart is a beautiful and involving film featuring two fine performances by its leads who are tasked with bringing to life a film that is both intelligent and fantastic, no small task. Desires of the Heart challenges both heart and mind with a story that is culturally grounded, somewhat mystical in nature, and yet psychologically insightful.

Film Threat The film matches its narrative’s expansive ambitions with gorgeous visions that turn both Georgia and India into almost permanent states of postcard-friendly imagery. The quality scenery is matched by the attractiveness of the leads, Val Lauren and Alicia Minshew, who offer up another element to enjoy…they succeed in their performances, keeping a tale that can be somewhat fantastical grounded in a sense of reality. Mastery to be found throughout; a strong film.

Mic.com Kicklighter notes that as Hollywood explores partnerships with financing and distribution deals, ‘it is clear that the market is important to Hollywood.’ Kicklighter sees the main barrier to Bollywood’s power is not film output, but the accessibility to Western markets: ‘Bollywood has a style that is uniquely its own.
