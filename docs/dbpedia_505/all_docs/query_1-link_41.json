        "text": "Think outside the box. We've all heard this phrase so much that it's become a cliche. But the truth is, it's a crucial concept in everything we do. Creativity and innovation thrive when we break out of the boundaries that have been set by others. As a musician and composer, I can attest to this firsthand. That's why I enjoy creating mashups, which I call \"Colliding Classics.\" These musical metaphors showcase the fun and exciting possibilities of thinking outside the box. Whether you're in the arts or another field, embracing new ideas is essential for growth and progress. What’s an example of something similar, but in the field you work in? Are some fields more open to new concepts than others? Are some rigidly strict in working within given parameters or “the way things are done?” #thinkoutsidethebox #creativity #innovation #newideas #piano #beethoven\n\n#CraftinganEP Developing this EP required a deep dive into the themes of struggle, growth, and redemption, which are encapsulated in the tracks : #Fallen #Crossroads #Embrace and an interlude that ties this idea together. I began with mood boards and mind maps to visualize the EP’s direction, ensuring a cohesive #narrative while allowing space for #creativefreedom. This strategic approach helped maintain focus during the intensive #songwritingsessions, where #melodies and #lyrics evolved into a compelling musical journey. Track 01: #Fallen This idea talks about how one can be at the lowest point of his life yet be in denial regarding the same. This track was the ideal #Genesis for the #EP narrative. While my music sounds more Cinematic and hip-hop influenced. #Fallen is at a different Tempo in all. An amalgamation of #ReeseBass with drums that remind you of #HouseMusic tunes. #Fallen explores how I cope with denial. Instead of addressing what's bothering me, I immerse myself in work until I face burnout. The drop is meant to sound like a group of people continuously marching, resembling the relentless rush of thoughts in my head. Eventually, I'm left with no choice but to confront the void that has been the root cause of my exhaustion. The song then comes full circle, ending in a similar rhythm to how it starts, but quieter, still carrying a feeling of depth and unsettlement. Stream #Fallen out everywhere. 2/6\n\nWhat do Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, Miley Cyrus, Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Eddie Vedder, and Brandi Carlile have in common? Yes, they’re all rockstars. But drill-down one more level. Dig deeper. I’ll wait. Okay, here goes. All of these rockstars count on Andrew Watt for their creative inspiration. When they get stuck. Andrew is the \"rockstar behind the rockstars.\" Today's New York Times spills all his secrets (\"Rock Gods Call Him When They Need a New Thunderbolt\") https://lnkd.in/dDkyjKRx Even the best of the best get stuck, stale, and at a loss for words. That’s where Andrew comes in to unstick them. As he puts it: \"Sometimes a big part of that job is being unafraid to tell mythic musical icons what they should do\" And that means being unafraid to have the difficult conversations, even the soul-penetrating ones. Not just about the song, but about the artist behind it. Few things get more personal. And he’s gotta do it with tact. Without getting starstruck. Imagine giving Paul or Elton advice on how to fix their B-side. I’d be speechless (a rarity.) As The Times says: They’re rock stars, after all. If they live long enough, they usually start to second-guess themselves. They fall prey to self-consciousness, complacency, the creative consequences of festering internecine beef, or all of the above, and wander away from what they’re best at. Sooner or later, they need someone to step in and guide them back onto the path. And the same is true for your team. Even the rockstars amongst it. They lose their self-confidence. They make a huge mistake, and get tongue-tied on the next big decision to be made. They blow a big customer deal, and get stagefright. Whatever it is, I’ll bet you have someone on your team who lifts everyone else up & gets them back into the limelight. That person is the backbone of your band. Without them, frankly, you’d be screwed. Because everyone else turns to them for advice, support, and just an open non judgmental ear. They don’t need to be the face of your band. They’re just happy to be the \"rock\" that others lean on. So you’d better not lose them in 2024. https://lnkd.in/dDkyjKRx\n\nAt Banding People Together, we are keenly aware of people's different preferences and styles. Some folks are wired to improvise and go with the flow, while others seek the security of the repeatable, planned structure. Let's talk about Counting Crows. Counting Crows is a fan favorite here at Banding. One person on our team has seen them live around 25 times, and I have a friend in the band. While discussing the band before a meeting, we realized we all had wildly different opinions of their live shows. Counting Crows is unique for a Rock band in that they 'interpret' their songs differently often when they perform. Lead singer Adam Duritz is famous (or infamous) for changing the melodies, phrasing, and rhythms on the fly, almost like a Jazz musician improvising. Some of us love that about them and it's the reason we go to so many shows, it's a fresh experience every time. Others... hate it. Comments like, \"I couldn't even tell what song they were playing, and it was their biggest hit, ugh\". Interestingly, after the conversation, some of those who didn't like the idea of not hearing the songs just like they heard them on the radio were open to the idea of interpretation, just knowing the context of what the band was doing made it more palatable. When we know the why and have context our minds seem to magically open. #leadership #teambuilding #powerofmusic #contextmatters FunFact: Counting Crows took their name from the English poem/nursery rhyme 'One for Sorrow', where magpies are counted with little superstitions attached.\n\nGreat producers change the game. In 1984, Rick Allen, acclaimed drummer of Def Leppard lost his left arm in a car accident, for most, this would have been a career-ending injury. Depressed and ready to quit, Rick received a visit from producer John (Mutt) Lange. Mutt talked Rick into leveraging what he had, expanding the use of his feet and right arm, and combining his acoustic drums with electronic drums to create more adaptation options. Think about how crazy that must have sounded to Rick? That's the value of a great producer. They help artists in the band expand their view of what's possible in profound ways. Rick said- “There were times at the beginning when I really felt like I couldn’t do this anymore. The thing that really helped is Mutt came to visit and he talked me into being able to do this [drumming], but in a different way.” \"In a different way\", there's the thing. Because Mutt and the band had developed great trust in each other, Mutt was able to Identify and amplify Rick's and the bands strengths to create something that hadn't been done before. So if you are a leader reading this...who is producing your band besides you? The hardest record to make is getting your LT to REAL clarity so alignment is even possible. Do that fast and you bring the future forward. It can be done in ways you might not have imagined....yet :) #leadership #teambuilding #clarity #behavioralscience #powerofmusic FunFact: I think we can say with clarity that their experiment worked, the resulting album 'Hysteria' released in 1987 has sold over 20 Million copies, Rick Allen redefined what a drummer is and can be, and still rocks with Def Leppard 40 years later.\n\nAT THE SUBSTACK An analysis of the recently deceased Shane MacGowan, who was the bridge between “Poor Paddy Works On The Railway” and “Anarchy In The UK”: “But think about The Pogues. They were to Irish folk music what Jason And The Scorchers and The Hickoids were to country music — proof you could take a seemingly alien source material and make blinding, rowdy punk rock out of it. Especially if that wellspring matter values brutal honesty, rebel spirit and a sorta barebones, raw musicality. Just give it a shot of fresh energy and visceral middle finger propulsion, and leave all the ragged edges out there. That’s what fueled those pogo-perfect early Pogues tunes like ‘The Boys From County Hell.’ But what about pure punk Pogue-ian gestures such as their Alex Cox-directed video for ‘A Pair Of Brown Eyes,’ which at root was a short-subject cinematic adaptation of George Orwell’s dystopian classic ‘1984,’ starring Margaret Thatcher as Big Brother?” All this, The Nipple Erectors, and the art of “the drunken Irish bastard” (as Michael Corocoran put it) at The Tim “Napalm” Stegall Substack, where we met our love by the gas works wall. #timstegall #timnapalmstegall #timnapalmstegallsubstack #punkjournalism #shanemacgowan #thepogues #thepopes #thenippleerectors #thenips #earlypunk #rockabilly #punkabilly #celticpunk #obtiuary #tribute #wild #primitive #hero #greatestsongwriterofourgeneration #punkrock #punk #subscribe #fivedollarsmonthly #fiftydollarsannually #upgradeyourfreesubscription #bestwaytosupport\n\n\"Like a Rolling Stone,\" by Bob Dylan Seth Rogovoy on the website Forward explains why this song, released as a single on July 20, is a creative masterpiece: \"It begins with the quick snap of a snare drum — a kind of shot heard round the world — followed immediately by the thump of a kick drum before the seven-piece rock band explodes with the theme that would propel the hit single “Like a Rolling Stone” toward the top of the pop charts and into the cultural stratosphere, where, after changing the notion of what a pop song could be and influencing a thousand artists to follow, the rock poet Bob Dylan would ultimately garner a Nobel Prize for literature. ... ... “'Like a Rolling Stone' was transformational, a musical and cultural phenomenon that changed everything, even inspiring the name of [Rolling Stone] magazine. Going back and listening again (and again and again) to “Like a Rolling Stone” proves to be a religious experience. The record’s power — and it is as powerful today as it was upon its release in July 1965 — is unassailable. It reminds one of how at its best rock music can equally pack an emotional and intellectual impact; indeed, five-and-a-half decades after its initial release and after hearing it hundreds if not thousands of times, live and on record, it still reduces me to tears.\" Creativity happens every day. If you are scrounging your next meal, maybe the answer for your life is to act creatively to find your direction home.

See, I find the notion of \"going it alone\" to be, quite frankly, a myth, a fable we tell ourselves. Success, to my mind, is a communal act, a chorus of voices rather than a solo performance. Yet, we find ourselves questioning this collective creed. And why? Let's talk about Gunna and Doja Cat, two artists who've become the anthems of our summer without co-signs, without the crutch of features, and without leaning into gimmicks. These aren't just artists; they're veritable zeitgeists, carrying with them not just tunes but controversies. And let me tell you, controversy might spark conversation, but it doesn't pack stadiums or sustain streaming numbers. So what's their secret sauce? It's tempting to say they've redefined the rules of the game, but what they've actually done is remind us there's no set playbook. No standard algorithm to which we all must subscribe. Kudos to their teams—the managers, the labels, the behind-the-scenes people we don't see—for betting on their artistic integrity and vision. Their success reaffirms the power of collective action and dispels the myth of the solitary genius. I hope artists take note. Create your art, spill your soul, strut your stuff. Do it your way, but never lose sight that even the most singular performance is made possible by an ensemble of talent that elevates and sustains it. It's not about doing it alone; it's about doing it authentically. And yes, authenticity? That's the real key to independence. Songs from the Summer Played in September: https://lnkd.in/eQyyZRgH\n\nMany years ago I wrote and recorded a 2 hour alternative progressive soft hard experimental concept 2-disc rock opera album. 🎸 I had high hopes. 🕊️ It had: ✅ Great melodies ✅ Great chords ✅ Great key changes The end result? 2 hours of uninspiring noise. 😐 Clearly…it was less than the sum of its parts. In fact, it was so difficult on the ears that the person I paid to review it gave it a negative review. How embarrassing. 👀 ____________________________ I share this because financial planning takes more than good components.
