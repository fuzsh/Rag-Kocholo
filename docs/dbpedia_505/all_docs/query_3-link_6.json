        "text": "Iconic R&B and soul singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were the most recent artists to battle it out on Verzuz. Tonight (September 13), the icons went hit-for-hit on the Instagram Live and Apple Music series. The two discussed their love for each other and also sang each other’s songs. They were joined by another legend, Dionne Warwick, and the three of them performed their collaborative single “Superwoman” to close things out.\n\nWhen LaBelle sang “If You Asked Me To,” she made a point to note that her version came out before Celine Dion’s recording. Knight performed “Midnight Train to Georgia” twice, and after she sang “License to Kill,” she encouraged people not to kill anyone. The final rounds featured performances of multiple Patti LaBelle songs. Find the tracklist for the night below, as well as an accompanying playlist.\n\nThe last Verzuz match featured Brandy and Monica.
