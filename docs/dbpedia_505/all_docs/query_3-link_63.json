        "text": "Back on February 5th I featured a song called ‘Ball of Confusion’ that was written by Barrett Strong and Norman Whitfield. Today’s song is another collaboration between Strong and Whitfield that really needs no introduction because it is immensely popular. ‘I Heard it Through the Grapevine’ was written for Motown Records in 1966 and it was the first composition by this songwriting duo. Whitfield produced it for Gladys Knight and the Pips and it was originally released in 1967. It went to #2 on the Billboard charts. In the highly competitive Motown era the song was produced with a heavy funk style in an attempt to rival the Aretha Franklin hit ‘Respect’. The Miracles actually recorded the song first but they didn’t release it until 1968 because Motown President Barry Gordy didn’t think it was worthy of The Miracles name. It is interesting to know this classic song was such a hot potato.\n\nWhen you analyze the lyrics there is an obvious deeper meaning. The song is about a betrayed lover reflecting on the fact that he has found out about his partners ‘infidelity’ through ‘the grapevine’. The roots of that expression is where the song takes on a broader context. In the mid ’60s, when Barrett Strong was visiting Chicago he took note of an expression that he was hearing a lot on the streets. ‘I Heard it Through the Grapevine’ resonated with him as an idea. In the slave era of the United States, the sharing of news and information (gossip) was said to be shared along the ‘grapevine’ telegraph or ‘through the grapevine’.\n\nAnother interesting note about the Glady’s Knight version is the lyrics were adjusted from “I know a man ain’t supposed to cry” to “Take a good look at these tears in my eyes, Baby these tears I can’t hold inside.”\n\nIn the ongoing struggle with ‘Grapevine’, Barry Gordy also vetoed the Marvin Gaye version of the song that to many is regarded as the ultimate. Producer Norman Whitfield worked with Gaye over five sessions with countless overdubs, backing vocals, and the Funk Brothers on a rhythm track. It also included a string section from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. By the time it was ready, and Whitfield was sure he had a hit, Gordy said no dice, because Gladys Knight already had a hit with the song. On the strength of the recording and his own conviction Whitfield released it as just another track on the Marvin Gaye ‘In the Groove’ album. It was the DJs of the day that ‘heard it’ and played it to the point that it had to be released as a single. From that point it went on to outsell the Gladys Knight and the Pips version. For a period of time it was actually the biggest Motown hit of all time, spending seven weeks at #1. That is where it appeared on this day in 1969.\n\nAs noted ‘I Heard it Through the Grapevine’ was covered by several Motown artists. Another phenomenal recording was the eleven minute jam by Creedence Clearwater Revival which appeared on their classic album, Cosmo’s Factory.\n\nIt has also been widely used on movie soundtracks and in television commercials. Who could forget The Big Chill or California Raisins?\n\nHere are two scoops of the California Raisins.\n\nHave a good day. Easy on the gossip though.\n\nSometimes the news on the grapevine becomes a game of broken telephone."
