        "text": "Well, they didn't have many hits here, but TWWW actually did very well. In fact, it was Streisand's version that didn't chart highly in the UK!\n\nGuess that's why the song stayed with me.\n\nThe Gladys Knight version, which was a live version, was a hit in the States in 1975. It's certainly not one she's remembered for now though.\n\nWow, that's a brilliant comp. Really nice, comprehensive overview of their career, and it has a few later songs I don't have on CD. Have to look out for that. Thanks for pointing it out.\n\nThe one I have is this (different artwork, all Motown):\n\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Gladys-Knight-The-Pips-Gold/release/1233003\n\nThe US one is certainly more representative of their career, but the UK/Australian one is a winner for fans of their Motown period.\n\nVery few singer posses a voice good enough to sing hard enough to force their voice to crack, and make that crack sound phenomenal. Aretha started to do that in the very late 60s and it became part of her large arsenal of sound; Gladys Knight was another singer who could do it, and was very much part of the style and charisma of her voice. Its akin to the way John Coltrane made use of those scrooooonks that every sax player was trained to avoid. Can you imagine A Love Supreme or anything he recorded after without them?\n\nIt shouldn't be. This was one of their biggest pre-Motown hits.\n\nAfter Gladys & the Pips hit it big on Motown and Buddah, dozens of budget labels reissued their earlier recordings - including \"Letter Full Of Tears,\" \"Giving Up,\" \"Every Beat Of My Heart,\" etc.. I see them in used stores all the time. The song itself isn't crazy rare.\n\nTotally under appreciated, and under valued.\n\nI caught Gladys's farewell tour at a packed out Wembley Arena in 2009. She doesn't always get the rightful credit for discovering the Jackson 5 (Motown thought it was better PR if they put out the false claim it was Diana Ross), so it was a nice full circle to see Tito Jackson as the opening act, shortly after Michael died, with their mother Katherine in the audience.\n\nMan, Gladys still has a set of pipes on her! Her voice was incredible, and she could certainly teach Macca and Elton a thing or two about how to preserve it.\n\nThis was taped on the same visit. I defy you not to be awestruck:\n\nShe also killed it at DWTS a couple years back. Shes really kept her vocals in good shape.\n\nAt least in Britain Licence To Kill was a huge hit for her. Knight's only solo top tenner, and in the wake of the single's success this compilation made No.12 on the UK chart in 1989.\n\nIt was the first Gladys CD I bought and is still a great introduction to her work with the Pips.\n\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Gladys-Knight-And-The-Pips-The-Singles-Album/release/1938093\n\nGladys Knight is one of the nicest entertainers I have ever met, and everything I've heard from her and the Pips I really, really like, but I have never gone out and gotten any of their recordings, except a budget disc of a live show they did with Ray Charles. They are the short list of acts I have long been interested in but need to get into, along with Smokey and the Miracles, Led Zeppelin, and Blur.\n\nI have a cd of \"Imagination\" from 1996. The Buddah Classics series. I saw it's been reissued by Funkytown Grooves with bonus tracks. I was just curious if there was more than one version of the song \"I've Got to Use My Imagination\". I heard a version on YouTube that's basically the same but the vocal sounds slightly different. I may pick up the newer reissue but wondered about that one song.\n\nHere are the two versions.\n\nI've Got to Use My Imagination - Gladys Knight and the Pips Â»\n\nForget that - what about \"Midnight Train to Cranston\"???"
