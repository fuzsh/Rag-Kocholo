        "text": "Reviewed on this page:\n\nEverybody Needs Love - Feelin' Bluesy - Silk 'N' Soul - Nitty Gritty - All In A Knight's Work - If I Were Your Woman - All I Need Is Time - Imagination - Claudine - Live - I Feel A Song - 2nd Anniversary - Pipe Dreams - Still Together - The One And Only - Miss Gladys Knight - Gladys Knight - About Love - That Special Time Of Year - Touch - Life - Touch - All Our Love - Good Woman - Just For You - Before Me\n\nGladys Knight, her brother Merald, sister Brenda, plus two other relatives, William and Elenor Guest, formed the Pips in 1952 when Gladys was just 8 years old. Brenda and Elenor left soon after, and by 1961 when they scored their first big hit, \"Every Beat Of My Heart,\" the group had settled on the four members that stayed together for the next twenty-five years. They struggled throughout the early 60s (changing their name to \"Gladys Knight & The Pips\" in the process) before coming to Motown, where they promptly scored several hits. By the early 70s, though, they had tired of the Gordy regime and headed off to Buddah, where they had phenomenal initial success. For the past thirty years it's been up and down, with frequent breaks from recording and occasional solo outings, mostly without much commercial success. I'm not too sure what the other Pips ever contributed, and Gladys is in the Aretha Franklin mold (R&B belter/sensitive interpreter) but not nearly as good, so the group really needs strong songwriting to succeed. And of course strong songwriting is the hardest thing to come by in this industry. (DBW) Letter Full Of Tears (1962)\n\nReleased on Bobby Robinson's Fury records, the first Gladys Knight and the Pips LP contains their first national hit (#1 R&B), \"Every Beat Of My Heart\" and the title track, also a significant hit. I have half of these tracks on a cut-rate vinyl issue called Every Beat Of My Heart together with other single sides like \"Come See About Me\" (not the Holland/Dozier/Holland number) and \"Really Didn't Mean It.\" It's not easy to hear anything indicative of the group's future success in these ordinary, two-minute rock and roll ballads, mainly because Knight's young voice is lacking the power and authority it would come to possess. (DBW)\n\nFollowing that LP, the Pips recorded for Robinson for a couple of years without making much noise before finding their way to Motown.\n\nEverybody Needs Love (1967)\n\nThe Pips' first Motown hit (title track) and their biggest, a frenzied version of \"I Heard It Through The Grapevine,\" are here. Both were written by Norman Whitfield, who produced most of this album; he also came up with the funky \"Ain't No Sun Since You've Been Gone\" (with Sylvia Moy and Cornelius Grant) and the ballad \"Since I've Lost You.\" Other contributors include Smokey Robinson (the contrived \"My Bed Of Thorns\") and Ashford & Simpson (the routine love song \"I'll Be Standing By\"). Then there's a cover of Barbara Mason's 1965 hit \"Yes, I'm Ready\" (revived in 1980 by Teri DeSario and K.C.). Knight had a rougher voice than any other female Motown singer of the period, but that's not saying much - she doesn't make the material her own. And since Whitfield was not yet pushing any boundaries as a producer, the disc is just standard Motown product: an energetic, wonderfully performed mix of R&B and pop, but nothing you won't find on dozens of other albums from the label during this era. (DBW)\n\nFeelin' Bluesy (1968)\n\nAgain, mostly produced by Whitfield, including the hit \"The End of Our Road\" (like \"Grapevine,\" this was later recorded by Marvin Gaye) and \"It Should Have Been Me.\" But the tracks are less arresting and original, both the ballads (\"Don't You Miss Me A Little Bit Baby\") and the uptempo soul (\"The Boy From Crosstown\"). Once again, Robinson's contributions sound like he's cleaning out his drawer (\"Your Old Standby,\" \"Ain't You Glad You Chose Love\"), and by the time Gladys sings the closing \"It's Time To Go Now,\" you'll be in full agreement. My LP only contains 9 tracks, so I haven't heard the remake of \"That's The Way Love Is,\" \"Don't Turn Me Away\" or \"I Know Better,\" but unless they really kick butt, this is one subpar effort. (DBW)\n\nSilk 'N' Soul (1968)\n\nUsually on a late 60s Motown release, you put up with the pedestrian covers for the sake of the unforgettable singles. This time, there are no singles: everything is a cover, either from Motown (the Tempts' \"I Wish It Would Rain,\" the Tops' \"Baby I Need Your Loving,\" Smokey's \"The Tracks Of My Tears,\" Brenda Holloway's \"Every Little Bit Hurts\") or from outside (Bacharach & David's \"The Look of Love,\" the Beatles' \"Yesterday,\" the Young Rascals' \"Groovin',\" Dionne Warwick's \"Theme From Valley Of The Dolls,\" Little Anthony's \"Goin' Out Of My Head,\" the appallingly overrecorded \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\"). I have almost nothing to say about the record because you already know all the tunes, the varied material is all given the same Funk Brothers plus strings arrangement, and Knight sounds just like usual. You'd have to be addicted to Knight's voice to want to pick this up. Norman Whitfield is credited as producer, though I assume a number of people were responsible. (DBW)\n\nNitty Gritty (1969)\n\nA lot of Motown's 60s releases were unoriginal - studded with remakes and copycat tunes - but nonetheless enjoyable. This is an extreme example: there are several Whitfield-Strong compositions also recorded by the Temptations (\"Cloud Nine,\" \"It's Summer,\" and \"(I Know) I'm Losing You\" - cut at a frantic \"Grapevine\" tempo, it's the only song of the three to be significantly rearranged). Two Ashford & Simpson songs, \"Didn't You Know (You'd Have To Cry Sometime)\" and \"Keep An Eye,\" also turned up on other Motown releases. The title track, a successful single, merely throws together a James Brown syncopated groove, Family Stone horns and gaga guitar distortion, with minimal melody or lyrics. There's even a track repeated from an earlier Pips record, \"Ain't No Sun Since You've Been Gone.\" The up side is, there are no failed experiments or drippy love songs - every track succeeds - and Knight's voice adds urgency throughout. Also, the Ashford & Simpson numbers are marvelous, and two songs I didn't know before (Harvey Fuqua's \"All I Could Do\" and Ivy Hunter's \"The Stranger\") are fine mid-60s soul. A blast if you aren't looking for any innovation. (DBW)\n\nThe group had another charting single in 1969, \"Friendship Train,\" and one more in early 1970, \"You Need Love Like I Do (Don't You)\" (also recorded by the Temptations) - these only appeared on a 1970 greatest hits album (thanks Reese!).\n\nAll In A Knight's Work (1970)\n\nA live release, in most respects close to Motown norms with rushed hits (\"End Of Our Road\"; \"Ain't No Sun\") and unexceptional covers (a flailing \"Fever\"; \"Cabaret\"; \"Dr. Feelgood\"). Atypically, though, the group performs their pre-Motown hits \"Every Beat Of My Heart\" and \"Letter Full Of Tears\" and closes with the gospel \"He'll Guide My Way.\" The Pips are also featured Knight-less on \"Girl Talk,\" sounding like your garden variety doo-wop act. So there are no electrifying performances captured here (though \"Grapevine\" is a lively workout), but it's above average for the label's live output. (DBW)\n\nIf I Were Your Woman (1971)\n\nBy now, covering outside rock and pop tunes was practically mandatory at Motown, and this album has several: Dave Mason's \"Feeling Alright,\" the Beatles' \"Let It Be,\" Sly Stone's \"Everybody Is A Star,\" and Bacharach/David's \"One Less Bell To Answer\" (originally recorded by the Fifth Dimension). So many, in fact, that the album loses all coherence, despite several plaintive love songs (\"I Don't Want To Do Wrong,\" which the band wrote; \"Signed, Gladys,\" which they didn't; and the hit title track). Half the record was produced by Clay MacMurray, the rest is split between Joe Hinton and Johnny Bristol, and all the arrangements are standard low-key R&B with none of the silly experimentation that marred a lot of Motown releases from this period, but nothing innovative or distinctive either. (DBW)\n\nStanding Ovation (1971)\n\nAgain, a bunch of covers - James Taylor's \"Fire And Rain,\" Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" the Beatles' \"The Long And Winding Road,\" the Hollies' \"He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother\" - with some originals (\"Make Me The Woman That You Go Home To,\" \"It Takes A Whole Lotta Man For A Woman Like Me\"). (DBW)\n\nNeither One Of Us (1973)\n\n\"Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)\" was a huge hit; the other single was \"Daddy Could Swear, I Declare,\" written by Gladys and Merald. Most of the titles are unfamiliar to me, except \"For Once In My Life.\" (DBW)\n\nAll I Need Is Time (1973)\n\nA terrific album that slipped through the cracks when the group left Motown (I think this was their last release before leaving the label). A large team of producers managed to come up with a coherent sound: soul that's sophisticated but down-to-earth, pensive yet vibrant. The gorgeous title track and the testifying \"Oh! What A Love I Have Found,\" written by Bud Reneau and produced by Joe Porter, are two of the best examples. Clay MacMurray produced three tracks, including the beautiful ballad \"The Only Time You Love Me Is When You're Losing Me\" and the highly orchestrated (by Tom Baird) \"Here I Am Again.\" The opening \"I'll Be Here (When You Get Home),\" produced and co-written by Johnny Bristol. Elliot Willensky's \"The Singer\" (produced by Hal Davis) is the only track that sounds false to my ear; even the Sly Stone tune (\"Thank You falletinme be mice elf agin\") sounds genuine, easily the best of the many Sly covers Motown cut during this period. This isn't an easy record to find but it's worth some searching out. (DBW)\n\nKnight Time (rec. 1973, rel. 1974)\n\nI think this is a collection of outtakes left behind when the Pips left Motown. Titles include \"How Can You Say That Ain't Love\" and \"Somebody Stole The Sunshine.\" (DBW)\n\nA Little Knight Music (rec. 1973, rel. 1975)\n\nThe second album of Motown leftovers, including covers of \"Come Together\" and (ack) \"Sugar Sugar.\" (DBW)\n\nImagination (1973)\n\nThe group's debut on Buddah, and they responded to the challenge with three Top Five singles: the soulful ballads \"Midnight Train to Georgia\" - their only #1 - and \"Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me\" (both by Jim Weatherly, who wrote five of the album's nine tracks), plus the stomping \"I've Got To Use My Imagination\" by Gerry Goffin and Barry Goldberg. \"Where Peaceful Waters Flow\" was also a single, with gentle wah-wah creating a pensive mood. The Pips get to shine too, with Gladys turning over the lead vocal on the cover of \"I Can See Clearly Now\" (with more reggae flavor than Johnny Nash's original) and the closing \"Window Raisin' Granny,\" which the band wrote. Production was split between Kenny Kerner and Richie Wise, and Tony Camillo, but it's all more or less in the same style: Motown smooth meets Southern grit. Aside from all the singles, \"One In A Lifetime Thing\" is also memorable; you could probably live without \"Storms Of Troubled Times\" and Paul Williams's \"Perfect Love.\" The key Pips disc to have; also their first gold album, though that doesn't mean much because Motown didn't participate in the RIAA certification system. (DBW)\n\nClaudine (1974)\n\nA soundtrack produced by Curtis Mayfield. The rollicking hit \"On and On\" is the only track that shows Mayfield's funky side, and there are none of his affecting doo-wop ballads; nearly everything is string-drenched, soggy mush (\"Claudine's Theme\") even when the lyrics are worthy (\"Mr. Welfare Man\" - Mayfield's own version is far superior). As with Mayfield's later work with Aretha Franklin, the lead vocals (let alone the Pips' backups) are given far less prominence than the string arrangements. Trouble is, those arrangements are depressingly routine, lacking interest, variety and emotional impact. Mayfield's solo work during this period was so good you have to wonder why his outside productions were so dull. (DBW)\n\nLive (rec. 1974, rel. 1996)\n\nRecorded in Detroit, with (so say the liner notes) a number of moonlighting Motown musicians on hand. The performance of \"The Way We Were\" was included on I Feel A Song, but the rest of the show didn't follow for another twenty years. Which is a shame, because it's fast-paced and exciting, with just enough slow numbers thrown in for balance, hitting all the high points of the group's career up to that point. Gladys sounds great, interacting well with the audience, the Pips stay in the background, and the band is sharp and well-recorded. It's so packed with hits (\"I've Got To Use My Imagination,\" \"Neither One Of Us,\" \"Grapevine\") it has no surprises for collectors, but by the same token, it's a great introduction to the group's sound and style. (DBW)\n\nI Feel A Song (1974)\n\nMuch more ballad-heavy than their Buddah debut, with \"I Feel A Song (In My Heart)\" (a Top Forty single, co-written and produced by Tony Camillo); Jim Weatherly's anonymous \"Love Finds His Own Way\" (also a single) and slick but pretty \"The Need To Be,\" and Bill Withers' almost spiritual \"Tenderness Is His Way.\" Plus, a live cover of Barbra Streisand's \"The Way We Were (by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman) that was so popular with radio programmers it was eventually released as a single. The production is so lush it can be syrupy, though Knight's rough voice keep things from getting too saccharine. The one song solely produced by the group, Ron Miller's \"Don't Burn Down The Bridge,\" has perhaps the most interesting arrangement: solid R&B rhythm, rapid slippery bass line, and a gear shift to a middle propelled by percussive strings, followed by disarming dynamics changes before the fade - it's fun. Weirdest collaboration is Burt Bacharach working with playwright Neil Simon on \"Seconds,\" an off-kilter tune with a surprisingly ordinary pop arrangement. Another gold record, but get Imagination first. (DBW)\n\n2nd Anniversary (1975)\n\nThe last Buddah album to chart, largely written and produced by Eugene McDaniel, including a funked-up version of his Roberta Flack hit \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and the fun, gritty O'Jays ripoff \"Money.\" Jim Weatherly also got another shot, and delivered the pleasant ballad \"Where Do I Put His Memory.\" On the down side, the orchestrated live version of \"Georgia On My Mind\" only makes you marvel that Ray Charles could sell such a meandering tune - Knight can't work the same magic, and doesn't even try. The single was a sleepy ballad, \"Part Time Love\" (written by David Gates of Bread - not the Elton John tune or the Stevie Wonder tune or even the Little Johnny Taylor tune). Not as varied or hardhitting as the previous Buddah releases - McDaniels lets many tracks run on too long (\"Summer Sun\") - but there's a lot to like (\"Street Brother,\" recalling Mayfield at his best). (DBW)\n\nPipe Dreams (1976)\n\nA mixed bag; soundtrack from the movie starring Gladys Knight, mostly produced by Dominic Frontiere and Bubba Knight. Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin's \"So Sad The Song\" is a slick, toothless orchestrated ballad - adding insult to injury, it's presented in vocal and instrumental versions. \"I'll Miss You\" is similarly overdone. Fortunately, Ivory Joe Hunter's \"Alaskan Pipeline\" is a rollicking, wah-wah'd funk jam, \"Find A Way\" is a feel-good anthem that's not quite too corny, \"Pot Of Jazz\" is a fun if slight piece recalling Lambert, Hendricks and Ross. James Cleveland's \"I Will Follow My Dream\" is a dignified album closer (or would have been, if not for the instrumental \"So Sad The Song\"). (DBW)\n\nStill Together (1977)\n\nI still haven't figured out why disco producer/songwriter Van McCoy got so much work: his lowest-common-denominator blend of robotic rhythm section, overblown strings and minimal melodies hardly seems impressive. I guess everyone was hoping he'd come up with another \"The Hustle.\" Anyway, his contributions here are even more lightweight and forgettable than usual (\"Baby Don't Change Your Mind,\" \"Home Is Where The Heart Is\"). The one Jerry Peters production (the disco tune \"Love Is Always On Your Mind\") is a bit better, with some funky arranging details, but at ten minutes it's still excruciating. Tony Camillo returned to produce two tracks, \"I Love To Feel That Feeling\" and \"You Put A New Life In My Body\" - the album's highlight, such as it is. (DBW)\n\nThe One And Only... (1978)\n\nI don't know the details, but some legal trouble prevented the group from recording together from 1977-1980. I'm guessing this was a collection of outtakes released by Buddah during the dispute, and if it is, it's surprisingly solid and adventurous. The instrumental combinations flout convention: an astonishingly loud guitar competes with bell-like keyboards on the title track, and the Michael Masser ballad \"Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right\" features soaring steel guitar. The one straight-ahead disco song, \"It's A Better Than Good Time,\" is precisely arranged with swirling strings, and Knight sounds terrific on the gospel-disco hybrid (I know, but trust me) \"Saved By The Grace Of Your Love.\" None of this would matter much if the tunes weren't memorable, but most of them are (\"Butterfly\"); the disc would rate higher if it weren't for a string of second-rate ballads (\"Don't Say No To Me Tonight,\" \"Be Yourself\"). Unfortunately, my cassette doesn't give any producer, composer or musician information, so I don't know who deserves the credit. (DBW)\n\nMiss Gladys Knight (Knight: 1978)\n\nKnight's last Buddah release and first solo album is kind of a mess. There's some tuneful pop movingly performed (\"Love Gives You The Power\"), including a gorgeous, gospel-inflected medley you won't want to miss (\"Sail Away/Freedom For The Stallions,\" arranged by Nick DeCaro). Unfortunately, that's more than made up for by sluggish, sodden ballads, in the same Streisand territory as \"The Way We Were\" but without the memorable melodies: \"We Don't Make Each Other Laugh Anymore,\" \"The Way It Was\" (by two of the Bee Gees). There's even a repeat from the last Pips album, \"It's A Better Than Good Time.\" The arrangements - some by Dean Parks - are standard pop rhythm section plus strings, without much acknowledgement of disco, funk or even R&B. Largely produced by Gary Klein, though Tony Macaulay produced the three songs he wrote (\"I'm Still Caught Up With You\"); the musicians include big names like David Foster, David Hungate, Victor Feldman and Jim Horn. Worth picking up if you see it real cheap. (DBW)\n\nAt Last (The Pips: 1979)\n\nFor anyone who wanted to hear the Pips without all those distracting Gladys Knight foreground vocals. On Casablanca. (DBW)\n\nGladys Knight (Knight: 1979)\n\nKnight's Columbia debut is a faceless assortment of disco, pop and ballads, produced by Jack Gold and Knight. The disco tunes (\"You Bring Out The Best In Me,\" \"You Don't Have To Say I Love You\" - are the most embarrassing attempts to be commercial, as the arrangements are clichéd and perfunctory, and the tunes instantly forgettable. It's not uniformly bad - \"My World\" is a tuneful ballad, engagingly performed, the standard \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" has interesting harsh strings - just hollow. The same, unfortunately, goes for Knight's vocals: mostly she doesn't belt, straining for meaning instead, but that only works when the words are actually meaningful. Arranged and conducted by Gene Page; musicians aren't listed, but it hardly matters. (DBW)\n\nCallin' (The Pips: 1979)\n\nCasablanca continued their valiant, doomed effort to market the Pips without Gladys. (DBW)\n\nAbout Love (1980)\n\nI think this was Knight and the Pips' first album back together after the legal problems. Written and produced by Ashford & Simpson, but they had no ideas this time around, just cranking out disco-y grooves, nearly all in the same tempo, with no memorable melodies and predictable horn and string flourishes (\"Landlord,\" \"Add It Up,\" you name it). The closing ballad, usually an A&S high point, is just as rote and forgettable as the rest (\"We Need Hearts\"). Strapped for material, the duo revived a tune they'd recorded themselves in 1977 as an instrumental, and wrote new words (\"Bourgie Bourgie\") - the sad part is, it's easily the best cut on the album, generating the only real excitement. Ashford's lyrics are passable but he doesn't achieve the moving quality he's capable of except on one track, the meditative, battered-but-hopeful \"Still Such A Thing.\" Knight's voice sounds fine, but she never paints outside the lines: with the tunes so flavorless, a bit of diva-ness would have been a big help. (DBW)\n\nThat Special Time Of Year (1980)\n\nA disco/lite soul Christmas album produced by Jack Gold, with AM legend Johnny Mathis on \"The Lord's Prayer\" and \"When A Child Is Born.\" Donny Hathaway's \"This Christmas\" gets an updated Motown treatment, with prominent congas and soothing strings. Since the tunes are so familiar and the arrangements so predictable, there's nothing much to focus on besides Knight's singing, and fortunately she outdoes herself, ranging from gentle shadings on \"What Are You Doing Christmas Eve\" to soulful belting on a surprisingly enjoyable disco take on \"Jingle Bells,\" with the Pips providing unusually rich harmonies. The one true cringe-inducer is \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,\" a duet with Knight's infant son Shanga. Considering how slight this set is, it's a lot of fun. Arranged by Larry Farrow, Joe Guercio, Gene Page and McKinley Jackson. (DBW)\n\nTouch (1981)\n\nAgain written and produced by Ashford & Simpson, and it's much more varied and tuneful in their standard late 70s style: artful, impeccably arranged soulful pop, sometimes with a funky edge (\"A Friend Of Mine\"). The usual high harmonies are sorely missed, though: the Pips' backups are flawless but lack that joyous A&S feeling. Points of interest include a gospel number (\"God Is\"), a lovely strings-and-piano ballad (\"Changed\"); there are only a few also-rans like the repetitive \"Baby, Baby Don't Waste My Time.\" The record closes with a long, Knight-produced ballad treatment of the Gloria Gaynor hit \"I Will Survive\" - one in a series of cover tunes where Knight underperforms the original artist. Smooth, pleasant pop/R&B, though you're still better off with a real Ashford & Simpson record. (DBW)\n\nVisions (1983)\n\nThe single was \"Save The Overtime (For Me),\" one of several songs co-written by Gladys, Bubba and Sam Dees. They produced several tunes (\"Heaven Sent\"), but the hit was helmed by Rickey Smith, who also worked on \"Ain't No Greater Love\" with Richard Rudolph. \"When You're Far Away\" is an early Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis tune, though Edmund Sylvers got the production credit. (DBW)\n\nLife (1985)\n\nThis didn't sell worth a crap, but it's not bad at all: an attempt to catch up with then-current R&B/dance trends, and a lot more successful in that department than the better-selling followup. The group sounds comfortable on a few boisterous technofunk numbers (\"Strivin',\" \"My Time\") that have actual melodies to go with the crunching synths, and the ballads are wisely left uncluttered (\"Till I See You Again,\" by Marvin Morrow and Bunny Sigler, is Knight at her best). Partly produced by Leon Sylvers III (\"Keep Givin' Me Love\"), partly by Gladys, Bubba, and Dees (title track), and generally speaking the producers wrote and performed the songs they produced. With all the programmed tracks, the list of musicians is short, but there are a few notable guests: Jerry Hey, Ernie Watts, Paul Jackson, and string arrangements by former Impressions producer Jerry Pate. Also in 1985, Gladys appeared on the AIDS charity single \"That's What Friends Are For\" with Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder and Elton John.\n\nAll Our Love (1987)\n\nReggie Calloway produced the hit \"Love Overboard,\" first-rate late 80s soul with a go-go beat, guitar scratching, plenty of open space, and a desperate but controlled vocal from Knight. Too bad he didn't produce anything else on the disc: seven other producers don't come up with anything memorable among them. Howie Rice's single \"Lovin' On Next To Nothin'\" ably uses electronic percussion and a bouncy tempo, but there's nothing else, and his \"Thief In Paradise\" is glossy, hi-tech noise. Knight's voice is lower than ever, which doesn't complement the bass-heavy instrumentation too well; she doesn't take charge of the many ballads, either (\"Let Me Be The One,\" Bacharach & Carole Bayer Sager's dreadful \"Love Is Fire (Love Is Ice)\"). The only song that deviates from the standard synth-plus-sax instrumentation is Bacharach/Bayer Sager's \"Overnight Success,\" with a Bacharach string arrangement that's nearly inaudible. Ron \"Have Mercy\" Kersey's two contributions are sluggish; Sam Dees produced perhaps the second best tune, \"It's Gonna Take All Our Love,\" but it's formulaic, and Nick Martinelli's productions are remarkably obvious (\"Complete Recovery\"). George Duke and Freddie Washington play on \"Love Overboard\"; otherwise, there are no noteworthy musicians except on the Bacharach material, which features David Foster, Robbie Buchanan and Paulinho Da Costa. (DBW)\n\nGood Woman (Knight: 1991)\n\nKnight's first solo album in over a decade is a disaster, thanks to her embarrassing attempt to keep up with production trends: nearly every cut has booming faux hip-hop electronic percussion and loud characterless synth (\"Give Me A Chance,\" \"Men\"), and there's a Salt-N-Pepa sample on \"Meet Me In The Middle\" that just shows she's trying too hard. Most of the production is by Attala Zane Giles, who also co-wrote most of the material with Knight. The album's centerpiece is \"Superwoman,\" written by Babyface, LA Reid and Daryl Simmons with guest vocals by Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle, but the high-tech noise and LaBelle's belting can't disguise the ordinariness of the tune. It's rare that an album's best song is a bonus track, but that's the case here with Mann and Weil's sensitive ballad \"In This Life,\" pretty much the only cut on the record that's tastefully done. Gerald Albright does play a nice sax solo on the otherwise obvious title track. (DBW)\n\nJust For You (Knight: 1994)\n\nKnight recovered her footing by focusing on ballads, and bringing in hotshot producers like Jam & Lewis and Babyface (\"I Don't Want To Know\"). They tone down the production from the previous release, though it's still largely synth-based; the lyrics are mostly on romance themes, ranging from illuminating (the ambivalent \"I'll Fall In Love If You Hang Around\") to cornball (\"Home Alone\"). But she also tackles race relations on a cover of The Impressions' \"Choice Of Colors\" and her own \"Guilty,\" both highlights. The centerpiece, though, is a lengthy live medley: Knight opens with a paean to the love songs of the past, quotes \"If You Don't Know Me By Now\" (also covered by Patti LaBelle), then praises Boys II Men for bringing romance back to the charts and launches into a moving version of their hit \"End Of The Road.\" There are plenty of forgettable tunes here (\"Somehow He Loves Me,\" also by Knight) but overall it's easily her best work during this period. (DBW)\n\nMany Different Roads (Knight: 1999)\n\nRecorded after Knight converted to Mormonism, and it includes two songs written by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch. I wish I were kidding. (DBW)\n\nIn 2004, Knight guested on Brother Ray's Genius Loves Company.\n\nBefore Me (Knight: 2006)\n\nA set of Great American Songbook standards: \"Good Morning Heartache,\" \"I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good),\" \"God Bless The Child,\" etc. Produced half by Tommy LiPuma, half by Phil Ramone, and the arrangements are stylish, sassy big band (\"Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me\") or hushed nightclub cool (\"Someone To Watch Over Me\"). The problem is, Knight is so busy paying tribute to past singers like Billie Holiday - in everything from the album title and cover art to the performances - that she doesn't put her own stamp on the show (\"Since I Fell For You\" is a pleasant exception). It's rare that a performing artist can be accused of excessive modesty, but I wish someone had told Knight that her fans want to hear her singing like herself. That's pretty much the whole point of buying a Gladys Knight record, right? It sure isn't because we needed another recording of \"Stormy Weather\" or \"The Man I Love.\" (DBW)\n\nThis is the end of our road."
