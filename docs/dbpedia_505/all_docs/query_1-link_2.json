        "text": "Gladys Knight and the Pips, American vocal group that was among the most popular rhythm-and-blues and soul groups of the 1960s and ’70s and that was unique in having a female lead singer and male backup singers. The principal members were Gladys Knight (b. May 28, 1944, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.), Merald (“Bubba”) Knight (b. September 4, 1942, Atlanta), William Guest (b. June 2, 1941, Atlanta—December 24, 2015, Detroit, Michigan), and Edward Patten (b. August 2, 1939, Atlanta—d. February 25, 2005, Livonia, Michigan).\n\nInitially composed of siblings and cousins, the group formed in Atlanta in 1952 at a family party (eight-year-old Gladys Knight had already won a nationally televised talent competition). Taking their name from their first manager, cousin James (“Pip”) Woods, the group began performing in local churches, in Atlanta clubs, and on the Chitlin Circuit (venues that catered to African American audiences). By the time they signed with Motown Records in 1966, they had scored hits on other labels, and their polished stagecraft, vocal harmonies, and dance routines had inspired a number of contemporary rhythm-and-blues acts. They produced 24 Top 40 hits between 1961 and 1977, including “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” (1967), “If I Were Your Woman” (1970), and the million-selling singles “Midnight Train to Georgia” and “Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me” from their million-selling 1973 album, Imagination. Contractual disputes slowed their output in the late 1970s, and eventually the Pips retired while Gladys Knight pursued a solo career. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996."
