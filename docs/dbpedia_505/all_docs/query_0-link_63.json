        "text": "WXPN, the fine public radio station out of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, has been asking listeners to help pick the 885 greatest songs by women artists.\n\n(Why 885 songs? WXPN is 88.5 FM. They’ll play them all on their annual end-of-year countdown.)\n\nI thought about it for a few days, then waded in at pretty much the last minute. Went through all my LPs and compiled a preliminary list of a couple of dozen songs by women. Then I trimmed that list to 10 songs and filed my ballot on the last possible evening. Deadlines spur action, you know.\n\nWe were asked to rank our top 10 songs, with 1 the best and so on.\n\nHere’s my list. Yours will be different. Mine is highly subjective, 10 songs I like, not the 10 greatest songs of all time.\n\n10. “California Nights,” Lesley Gore, 1967. I dig Lesley Gore, and she sang this on “Batman.” A moonlit slice of mid-’60s pop co-written by Marvin Hamlisch.\n\n9. “Lady Marmalade,” Labelle, 1974. A powerhouse, produced by Allen Toussaint and sung by Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash. Such a great song that Pink, Christina Aguilera, Mya and Lil’ Kim — along with Missy Elliott — memorably covered it for the “Moulin Rouge” soundtrack more than 25 years later, in 2001.\n\n8. “Oh Happy Day,” the Edwin Hawkins Singers with Dorothy Morrison on lead vocals, 1968. A great pop gospel song. I picked the original over the Aretha Franklin/Mavis Staples version from Aretha’s “One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism” LP from almost 20 years later, 1987.\n\n7. “Free Your Mind,” En Vogue, 1992. Funk meets metal, delivering a message that remains necessary to this day, more than 30 years later, sung fiercely by Terry Ellis, Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron and Maxine Jones.\n\n6. “Put A Little Love In Your Heart,” Jackie DeShannon, 1969. Another song 12-year-old me heard on WLS out of Chicago while cruising The Circuit in Janesville, Wisconsin, with my older cousins. Such a great song that it was a hit all over again when Annie Lennox and Al Green covered it almost 20 years later, in 1988.\n\n5. “Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart,” the Supremes, 1966. Hadn’t heard this upbeat, lighter-than-air piece of Motown pop until introduced to it by my friend Larry Grogan not all that long ago. Quickly became a favorite, as did the LP from which it comes — “The Supremes A’ Go-Go.” (That said, I’m still not a huge Supremes fan.)\n\n4. “The Nitty Gritty,” Gladys Knight and the Pips, 1969. When I learned that Gladys Knight got down to the real nitty gritty and wasn’t just the elegant pop singer of “Midnight Train to Georgia,” well, that blew my mind.\n\n3. “Friendship Train,” Gladys Knight and the Pips, 1969. Yeah, I really dig Gladys Knight as produced by Norman Whitfield. Here, she comes out smoking again, and like En Vogue, delivers a message that remains necessary to this day, more than 50 years later.\n\n2. “Turn The Beat Around,” Vicki Sue Robinson, 1976. Just try to sit still if this song is playing. Its Latin-tinged beat was a breath of fresh air on the dance floors of 1976 (and yes, I remember the dance floors of 1976). Such a great song that it was a hit all over again for Gloria Estefan almost 20 years later, in 1994.\n\n1. “One Less Bell To Answer,” the 5th Dimension with Marilyn McCoo on lead vocals, 1970. It starts cool but turns into a scorcher of a torch song. Marilyn McCoo is such a powerful, evocative and versatile singer. Written by the legendary team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David.\n\nTough to leave off any of the other women artists on my working list: Bananarama, Barbara Lynn, Bobbie Gentry, Carlene Carter, Donna Summer, Tina Turner, Tracey Ullman, Martha Wash and Izora Armstead (the Weather Girls), Annie Lennox (with Eurythmics), Joan Jett (with the Blackhearts), Petula Clark, Chaka Khan (with Rufus), Aretha Franklin, Mavis Staples and Nancy Sinatra.\n\nEven had one last moment of indecision when my friend Larry Grogan played the Marvelettes’ “He Was Really Sayin’ Something” on his Funky 16 Corners streaming show last night. Oh, that’s a good one, too.\n\nThen you have great and/or interesting and/or fun women artists who didn’t make either of my lists (and this, too, is far from complete): Dolly Parton, Kate Bush, Alison Moyet, Freda Payne, Dionne Warwick, Betty Everett, Nina Simone, Betty Wright, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde (with the Pretenders), Debbie Harry (and Blondie), Bonnie Raitt, Erma Franklin, Carolyn Franklin, Darlene Love, Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Merrilee Rush, the Donnas, Ann Wilson and Nancy Wilson (with Heart), Shirley Bassey, Lea Roberts, Merry Clayton, Kim Shattuck (with the Pandoras and the Muffs), Gayle McCormick (with Smith), Chi Coltrane, Janis Joplin, Honey Cone, the Three Degrees, the Sweet Inspirations, Laura Nyro, Laurie Anderson, Melanie, Dusty Springfield, Millie Jackson, the Pointer Sisters, Sharon Jones, Linda Ronstadt, Wanda Jackson, Cher, Dee Dee Sharp, Ann Peebles, hell, even Charo. My friend Jerry probably would put 10 Francoise Hardy songs on his list.\n\nAsk me tomorrow and my top 10 list might be entirely different. But I will be interested to see where my 10 songs wind up among the 885 songs in XPN’s year-end countdown.\n\nReader’s note: My friend Charlie over at Bloggerhythms has been all in on this, writing a series of solid blog posts about the top 10 songs by women artists on his ballot. Go check them out.\n\nEarlier this year, we shared an appreciation of four music greats who are still with us: Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis and Tina Turner. They’re my four. Yours may be different.\n\nYet that train keeps bearing down on us, taking Scotty Moore, Mack Rice, Bernie Worrell, Ralph Stanley, Wayne Jackson and Chips Moman this month alone. Since we last gathered here, Guy Clark, Candye Kane, Billy Paul, Lonnie Mack and Prince also have left the building.\n\nIn a year in which we have lost so many music legends, it seems wise to not stop at four. It also seems wise to not wait too long.\n\nSo here are four more music greats who are still with us, all of them still going strong. This is by no means the B team, or the second tier, or anything like that. Just four more worth appreciating here and now.\n\nMavis Staples, 76. The beloved gospel/soul/R&B singer released a wonderful new record, “Livin’ On A High Note,” in February. That same month, “Mavis,” a documentary profile, premiered on HBO. She’s playing gigs across North America through November, then will receive Kennedy Center Honors in December.\n\n“Revolution,” Mavis Staples, from “Hot Wacks,” 2013, a compilation of artists on the Anti- label. A distinctive cover of the Beatles song from one who’s long sung about revolution.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/08-revolution.mp3\n\nTom Jones, 76. Sir Tom is performing gigs across Europe this summer in support of “Long Lost Suitcase,” a roots record released last October as the final part of a trilogy that also includes “Praise & Blame” and “Spirit In The Room,” which came out in 2010 and 2012, respectively. “Long Lost Suitcase” also is the companion piece to his memoirs, “Over The Top And Back.” It’s been a tough year, though. His wife of 59 years, Linda, died in April.\n\n“Dance of Love,” Tom Jones, from “This is Tom Jones,” 1969. It’s a tune written and done first by Charlie Rich in 1965 on the Smash label.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/05-dance-of-love.mp3\n\nDennis Coffey, 75. This Funk Brother is still playing some mean rock and jazz guitar “in the D.” He tweets out his shows at @DennisCoffeyDET, announcing on relatively short notice that he’ll be at the Northern Lights Lounge — his most frequent Detroit gig — or at Motor City Wine, or at the Dirty Dog Jazz Cafe. His blog is recommended reading. Coffey shares lots of good stories there. Likewise his discography for record collectors. His last record, the solid, self-titled “Dennis Coffey,” came out on Strut Records in 2011. It’s worth checking out.\n\n“Never Can Say Goodbye,” Dennis Coffey, from “Goin’ For Myself,” 1972. A cover of the Jackson 5 tune on which Coffey demonstrates a little bit of soul, a little bit of funk and a bit more jazz.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/03-never-can-say-goodbye.mp3\n\nGladys Knight, 72. Another of the great ladies of soul, she’s playing gigs in Europe and the United States through October. A solo act for almost 30 years now, she hasn’t had the late-career success of her peers. Widely known today for lush ballads and inspirational songs, Gladys Knight belongs here because of her energetic performances with the Pips in the late ’60s and earliest ’70s on Motown’s Soul label. She really did get down to the real nitty gritty, kids.\n\n“(I Know) I’m Losing You,” Gladys Knight and the Pips, from “Nitty Gritty,” 1969. When I heard this cut on Sirius XM not too long ago, I was reminded that this is one of my favorite LPs. And, yeah, that’s Dennis Coffey playing guitar on the “Nitty Gritty” single and his wah-wah, fuzz-toned lick about 11 seconds into the intro of “Friendship Train.”\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/04-i-know-im-losing-you.mp3\n\nWe interrupt our appreciation of music legends still with us for an appreciation of something else still with us.\n\nAM, Then FM is quietly celebrating its ninth anniversary in the blogosphere.\n\nIt arrived on the scene during the last week of February 2007.\n\nIt gradually gained a modest group of regular visitors, thanks to gracious and kind support from fellow bloggers who remain friends to this day. Back then, there were many blogs, many readers. Times change.\n\nWhen AM, Then FM debuted …\n\n— Our son had just turned 12 and was in sixth grade. He’s now 21, a college junior, performing in still another play this week and heading to New York on a spring break theatre tour in a couple of weeks.\n\n— I’d just marked 29 years in the news business. I’m no longer in the news business.\n\nYep, times change.\n\nBut I’ll continue to buy records and talk about them here as if we were in the same room, listening to them and sharing our takes on them.\n\nYour continued loitering is much appreciated. We’ll keep on keepin’ on.\n\nI wanna say I love the life I live.\n\nAnd I’m gonna live the life I love.\n\nUp here on Cloud 9.\n\n“Cloud Nine,” the Temptations, 1969, from “The Motown Story” box set, 1970. It’s out of print. This cut features a minute-long intro with Otis Edwards discussing how they came to record the song during the fall of 1968. He insists it’s about the state of black life at the time, and not about drugs, as widely believed at the time.\n\nAlso featuring Dennis Coffey on lead guitar and Mongo Santamaria on conga drums. Santamaria covered it later that year on his “Stone Soul” LP.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/temptations-cloud-nine-with-spoken-intro.mp3\n\n“Cloud Nine,” Gladys Knight and the Pips, from “Nitty Gritty,” 1969. A cool cover on which the Pips get gritty, too.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01-cloud-nine.mp3\n\nOur friend Larry over at Funky 16 Corners is celebrating five years of F16C with more cool Beatles covers. Head over there and check out two new mixes and four older mixes.\n\nLarry has been a guide, an inspiration and a good friend. We have plenty in common, and not just the music. On my wish list: Road tripping from Wisconsin to New Jersey just to soak in the vibe when Larry and his pals spin 45s at Asbury Park Lanes some night.\n\nHere, then, as a small way of saying thanks, are five more Beatles covers in that same soul/R&B spirit. They’re more mainstream than Larry’s selections, but that just goes to show how deeply the man is digging it. Hope you will enjoy them nonetheless.\n\n“Eleanor Rigby,” Bobbie Gentry, from “Local Gentry,” 1968. An almost perfect match of sultry singer, downbeat song and low-key arrangement. (Also covered on this LP, and not as well: “Fool on the Hill” and “Here, There and Everywhere.”)\n\n“Get Back,” Al Green, from “Green Is Blues,” 1969. It’s out of print. (Al’s cover of “I Want To Hold Your Hand,” also from 1969, is much in the same sizzling vein.)\n\n“Got To Get You Into My Life,” the Four Tops, from “Soul Spin,” 1969. A song made for the great Levi Stubbs. (This is a CD rip from “Mojo Beatlemania, Volume 2,” included with Mojo magazine in September 2004.)\n\n“Let It Be,” Ike and Tina Turner, from “Workin’ Together,” 1971. It’s out of print but is available digitally. Listen to how Tina tweaks the lyrics to make this her own, then gives it a bit of a gospel feel. (Also on covered on this LP, and shared earlier by Larry: “Get Back.”)\n\n“Come Together,” Gladys Knight and the Pips, from “A Little Knight Music,” 1975. Recorded while they were at Motown in the early ’70s, maybe 1971 or 1972. Sassier than you’d think."
