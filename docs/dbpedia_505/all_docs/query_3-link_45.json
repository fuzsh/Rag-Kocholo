        "text": "Read More\n\nFellow breast cancer survivor Katie Couric was among the famous names wishing Knight a happy birthday.\n\n“A true exemplary human being and amazing talent. Thank you for all you are and all you’ve given to the world,” Couric said in an Instagram comment.\n\nSkin cancer survivor and Bravo TV host Andy Cohen also wished Knight a “Happy Birthday!!!!!”\n\nActor and husband to breast cancer survivor Rebecca King Crews, Terry Crews, said, “Happy Birthday you Living Legend.”\n\n“80 years of beautiful life, love, service, celebration, achievement, falling down, faith, fun, lessons, blessings, friendship, collaboration, soul sharing, and more,” Knight said in her social media post before thanking everyone for their love and support.\n\nKnight, dubbed the “Empress of Soul,” rose to fame during the 1960s when the era of Motown’s soulful array of artists burst onto the music scene. She was part of “Gladys Knight and The Pips.” She’s associated with memorable hits like “I Heard It Through the Grapevine,” “Midnight Train to Georgia,” and “I’ve Got to Use My Imagination.”\n\nThe award-winning artist was among a group of pioneering Black artists during the ‘50s, ‘60s, and ‘70s who helped further integrate the music industry by making music produced by Black artists more acceptable in the mainstream.\n\nOne aspect of Knight’s remarkable career is her battle with breast cancer. She was friends with the “Queen of Soul,” Aretha Franklin, who died in 2018 from advanced pancreatic cancer, CBS News reports.\n\nAround the time of Franklin’s passing, Knight shared that they both were cancer survivors.\n\n“Aretha and I discussed both of us having cancer; mine was stage 1 breast cancer, and hers was pancreatic,” Knight told US Magazine.\n\n“Due to early detection, I am cancer-free and grateful for that,” Knight added.\n\nUnderstanding Gladys’ Breast Cancer Diagnosis\n\nKnight was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer. While specific details of how she navigated her cancer journey or how she was treated, we do know at this stage, breast cancer is treatable.\n\nEarly-stage breast cancer means there is a small tumor in the breast, and no lymph nodes are impacted.\n\nTreating cancer in this early stage usually involves removing the cancer through surgery with the possibility of radiation. The type of surgery may include a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.\n\nBreast Cancer Surgery\n\nA lumpectomy is a surgery to remove a cancer or abnormal tissue from the breast. It’s also known as breast-conserving surgery because, unlike mastectomy, only the tumor and some of the surrounding tissue are removed.\n\nWATCH: Choosing between a lumpectomy or mastectomy.\n\nDuring a mastectomy, the breast is removed. In a double mastectomy, both breasts are removed. In many cases, women choose to undergo breast reconstruction.\n\nReconstruction gives women the chance to have implants put in right after the mastectomy procedure. However, some women choose not to have reconstruction at all.\n\nDr. Elisa Port, Chief of Breast Surgery at Mount Sinai Health System, told SurvivorNet that most women do opt to have some reconstruction. Depending on what sort of surgery a woman chooses, the time spent in surgery can vary greatly.\n\nThere are many different options and techniques available for reconstruction — from implants to using a woman’s own tissue — and choices about when to get the reconstruction, meaning immediate (at the time of mastectomy) or delayed (which could be months or even years later).\n\nWATCH: Deciding to get saline or silicone implants during a breast reconstruction.\n\nImmediate reconstruction can produce better results than delayed reconstruction, resulting in fewer surgeries. However, it may require a more extended initial hospitalization and recovery time. This long surgery may also have a higher risk of complications, such as infections, than two separate surgeries.\n\nIt may be worth noting that “Delayed reconstruction has fewer complications than immediate reconstruction,” Dr. Terry Myckatyn, a plastic surgeon specializing in breast reconstruction, told SurvivorNet.\n\nWhen implants are used, the procedure can take two to three hours (so the total surgery time would be around five hours). During reconstruction, one can also take one’s own tissue (usually from the belly area) and transfer it into the breast area.\n\nAfter breast cancer surgery, women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer may also need chemotherapy, radiation, or hormone therapy.\n\nEfforts to Close the Gap Among Black Women Facing Cancer\n\nBlack women experience higher cancer deaths than other racial groups. We know the biology and genetics of Black women contribute to these disparities because in the case of triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease, a gene that can slow cancer growth isn’t as pervasive in Black women compared to white women.\n\nThis Spring, the American Cancer Society launched a groundbreaking study called “Voices of Black Women,” which focused specifically on Black women and delved deeper into why cancer impacts this community so hard.\n\n“I’m hopeful that we will generate more granular information on what is really driving these higher mortality rates among Black women,” Dr. Kathie-Ann Joseph, a breast surgeon and vice chair for diversity and health equity in the Department of Surgery at NYU Langone Health Perlmutter Cancer Center tells SurvivorNet.\n\n“This study includes women who are not only African-American but may be of Caribbean or direct African descent who recently immigrated. We may find different patterns in these subgroups, which may be quite interesting. We haven’t had studies large enough to see if this population has distinct differences,” Dr. Joseph said, who also enrolled in the study.\n\nWhile Black men and women experience higher mortality rates from cancer, women are the focus of the study.\n\nCoping With a Breast Cancer Diagnosis\n\nIf you are facing a breast cancer diagnosis, your emotions are likely to run high, which is completely normal. Psychiatrist Dr. Lori Plutchik says emotions are often fluid when coping with a diagnosis.\n\n“The patient or person going through the stressful event should accept that emotions will be fluid. You may feel fine one day and then feel a massive wave of stress the next. It’s also important for those you look to for support, whether that’s a therapist, friends, family, or both, to understand the fluidity of stress-related emotions,” Dr. Plutchik said.\n\nIf a stressful event affects how you think and feel, it may be time to seek mental health treatment. This could mean traditional talk therapy, medication, changing lifestyle habits (like exercise and diet), seeking a support group, or many other approaches.\n\nWomen needing a little extra help coping with a breast cancer diagnosis should consider the following.\n\nLet your family and close friends know and let them help. So many cancer survivors tell us they want and need support but are often too preoccupied to make specific requests. Urge those close to you to jump in with whatever practical help they can offer.\n\nKeep a journal. It can be highly cathartic to let those feelings loose on paper. Grab a pen and a lovely journal and chronicle your thoughts throughout the day.\n\nJoin a cancer support group. Groups are available in nearly every community and offer opportunities to connect with others going through a similar journey. You’ll learn constructive insight from others who can tell you what to expect and how to stay strong on tough days.\n\nConsider seeing a therapist. Ask your doctor to refer you to a therapist so you can discuss your fears and concerns in a safe space. Often, vocalizing your thoughts and feelings rather than internalizing them can provide relief.\n\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with breast cancer, you may have questions about how to keep your strength through treatment. Here are a few questions to help you begin the conversation:\n\nWhat treatment will I be receiving?\n\nWhat side effects are associated with this treatment?\n\nAre there steps I can take daily to help minimize these side effects?\n\nWhat physical activity routine do you recommend for me during treatment?\n\nDo you have recommendations for someone who doesn’t particularly enjoy exercise?"
