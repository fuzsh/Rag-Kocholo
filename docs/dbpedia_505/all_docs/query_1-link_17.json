        "text": "Gladys Knight is certainly a soul survivor. Knight began her career performing as a child and has never stopped. She had her first R&B No. 1 hit in 1961 with “Every Beat of My Heart” (credited to The Pips) and continued having chart hits for the next four decades. With her group Gladys Knight and the Pips and as a solo artist, her style has gone through doo wop to Motown soul and smooth R&B, pop and gospel. While she’s not always listed as the top soul singers of the 1960s, when other vocal greats list favorites, Knight is one of the names that often comes up first.\n\nHere are five facts you might not have known about Gladys Knight.\n\n1. Knight got her first break in 1952, at the age of seven, when she appeared on the television talent contest “Ted Mack’s Original Amatuer Hour,” and won.\n\n2. Gladys Knight and the Pips, were actually a family group. The Pips included her brother Merald \"Bubba\" Knight and cousins Edward Patten and William Guest. At one time the group also included Knight’s sister Brenda and cousin Eleanor Guest. The Pips took the name of cousin James “Pip” Woods.\n\n3. While the song “I Heart It Through the Grapevine” is best known by Marvin Gaye’s version, Gladys Knight and the Pips had the first hit with the song. Much more upbeat than Gaye’s version, Knight’s take went to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts in 1967. Gaye’s version was actually recorded first (February, 1967), but wasn’t released until late 1968. That song went to No. 1 on the Hot 100 and became Motown Records’ most successful single to date. Smokey Robinson and the Miracles actually recorded the very first version of the song in 1966, but Motown head Berry Gordy decided it wasn’t a hit and didn’t release it as a single.\n\n4. Gladys Knight has appeared in a few films, but her first appearance was the lead role in the film “Pipe Dreams” in 1976. The plot involved workers on the Alaska oil pipeline. She has appeared more often on television and co-starred with Flip Wilson in the 1985 show “Charlie & Co.”\n\n5. In 1997, Knight joined the Church of Latter Day Saints, and in 2002, Knight founded Saints Unified Voices, which performs at LDS events.\n\nGladys Knight\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Friday, June 16\n\nWhere: Tennessee Theatre"
