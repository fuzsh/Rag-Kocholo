        "text": "If anyone should ever write my life story\n\nFor whatever reason there might be\n\nYou’ll be there between each line of pain and glory\n\nCause you’re the best thing that ever happened to me\n\nIf you recognize those lines as lyrics to the 1970s hit, “Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me” by Gladys Knight and the Pips, you would be right!\n\nOn Saturday, Feb. 22, 2020, lucky supporters of the University of St. Thomas will enjoy a private performance and experience the soulful sounds of Gladys Knight at the 70th Annual Mardi Gras Scholarship Gala.\n\nDubbed “The King of All Mardi Gras Balls,” the 2020 Gala will be held at the beautiful Hilton Americas-Houston and promises unparalleled Mardi Gras merriment.\n\nLast year’s event topped $1 million in proceeds, and the 2020 chairs, Denise Castillo-Rhodes, MBA ’92, Robert F. Corrigan Jr., Dr. Herbert P. Edmundson Jr. ’69 and Edward L. Tyrrell, are hoping for even bigger returns in 2020.\n\nGladys Knight’s long reign as an R&B superstar spans decades and includes dozens of top hits such as “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” and “Midnight Train to Georgia,” to name a few. Known as “The Empress of Soul,” the seven-time Grammy Award-winner continues to awe adoring fans at her performances across the United States and around the world.\n\nIn addition to Knight’s performance, the Gala will include a royal feast, live auction, brass band, DJ and dancing, the crowning of UST’s 2020 Mardi Gras King and Queen, a salute to the Queens of past Mardi Gras Galas, and special recognition of the evening’s honoree, Dr. Mauro Ferrari.\n\nDr. Ferrari, a member of UST’s Board of Directors and president of the European Research Council, is a globally-renowned nanomedicine scientist whose groundbreaking research has led to new technologies in drug delivery and cancer therapy. In 2017 Pope Francis appointed him to the Pontifical Academy for Life, a scholarly body that advises leaders on ethics and scientific matters, including biology and medicine.\n\nDr. Ferrari joins UST in encouraging students to be the best version of themselves, to fearlessly pursue knowledge and to do big things with their degrees. UST Celts have the ability to do this, and the scholarships provided by supporters of this Mardi Gras Gala help make their dreams reality.\n\nJOIN US!\n\nUnderwriting and Tickets\n\nMeredith McCrary – 713-942-5955\n\nEvent Information\n\nMuffy Buvens – 713-942-5962\n\nEmail\n\nMardiGrasScholarships@stthom.edu\n\nVisit Us\n\nUSTMardiGrasGala.com\n\nAbout the Author — UST Staff\n\nThe UST staff strives to bring the most interesting, relevant and topical stories to our audience with each issue.
