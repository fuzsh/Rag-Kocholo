Looking out for America&#39;s farmers and ranchers since 1825 | Since its creation, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry has helped establish, guide, and examine agricultural policies here and abroad.  It has had a hand in fashioning the research and teaching of the 1860’s, the price and income support controls of the 1930’s, and the international trade of the 1990’s.  The Committee has been active in times of prosperity and peace, as well as in times of depression and war.",
