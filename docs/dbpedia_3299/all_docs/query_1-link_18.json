Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Roberts, Boozman, Perdue, Ernst, Tillis, Sasse, Grassley, Thune, Stabenow, Brown, Klobuchar, Gillibrand, Donnelly, Heitkamp, and Casey. Chairman Roberts. Good morning. I call this meeting of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry to order. Prior to making my opening statement, I am going to yield to the distinguished Ranking Member, who has another meeting she must attend--something about tax extenders, as I recall. You do have my list. Senator Stabenow. Yes, I have your list. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. So I yield to my distinguished friend and colleague. STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN Senator Stabenow. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I hope to be coming back. I am looking forward, maybe, to the day of saying, ``Beam me up, Scotty,'' so we can be two places at once, because this is a very, very important hearing, and I am so pleased to welcome Krysta Harden, our Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, who is doing such a phenomenal job. She had been a steadfast champion of America's farmers and families, and I want to thank you for leading our efforts to implement the 2014 farm bill. Just extraordinary what you and the Secretary have been able to do. We put a lot on your plate, and you have worked very, very hard and diligently to move things forward. I also want to thank you very much for the excellent job that you are doing in highlighting the leadership and contributions that women are making in the agricultural economy, food economy, not only in our country but throughout the world. Mr. Chairman, back in August of last year, 2014, Deputy Secretary Harden joined Senators Klobuchar, Heitkamp, Cantwell, Hirono, and myself on the first-ever all-women's Senate delegation trip to Africa. It was really an extraordinary trip. Our time in Africa strengthened my appreciation of our country's commitments to helping fight global hunger and food insecurity, as well as our efforts to help empower women who represent the majority of all farmers in Africa. Additionally, Senators Leahy, Brown, and I, alongside other colleagues, had the opportunity a few years ago to see the McGovern-Dole School Feeding Programs in action when we visited Haiti after its devastating earthquake. This program was providing children, and is still today, with their only meal of the day, and it sends a powerful message to Haitian families about our American values. Chairman Roberts. Would the distinguished Senator just yield for a point? Senator Stabenow. I would gladly yield. Chairman Roberts. In Kansas, we refer to that as the ``Dole-McGovern program.'' [Laughter.] Senator Stabenow. I should have known that, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Roberts. Please proceed. Senator Stabenow. Well, we are very, very proud to be bipartisan. Chairman Roberts. Yes, ma'am. Senator Stabenow. The McGovern-Dole/Dole-McGovern program. It really is very powerful when you see it in action, Mr. Chairman, as you know. Tragically, today nearly 800 million people across the world are affected by hunger and poverty. Compounded by a growing population, climate change, strains on our natural resources, we face a significant challenge of how best to feed and sustain a growing world. This has also become a significant global security issue, as we know. As we look at the crises around the world today, whether it is a prolonged drought in East Africa or a severe flooding in Bangladesh, our emergency food aid programs are vital to so many families. It is in those moments of crisis that the United States has a proud legacy of extending a compassionate hand. The Food for Peace Program has become one of the most extraordinary partnerships to help alleviate hunger and suffering around the world. In fact, the story of the Food for Peace Program has been a story of partnerships throughout its history-- partnerships between American farmers and those in need, the U.S. Government and the on-the-ground volunteer organizations, and partnerships between Democrats and Republicans in Congress. We are proud of this record, and at the same time, we know that with new challenges come new responsibilities to make our international food programs even more effective. During the farm bill, Senator Roberts and I brought together a broad coalition to reform food aid while honoring the traditional partnerships that keep the program strong. The farm bill made permanent the Local and Regional Procurement Program and gave additional flexibility for Food for Peace to address hunger wherever and whenever it exists. Taken together, these changes represent the most significant reforms to our food aid programs in more than 50 years. Our long-term goal, however, should be to reduce the need for emergency food aid by focusing on achieving global food security through advancements in nutrition and the long- term productivity of agriculture. New agricultural technologies provide a platform for world communities to create stable food sources for families as well as economic independence. We must invest in those technologies, in people, and in the infrastructure both here and broad that support the growth of sustainable agricultural production. In doing so, we also invest in our own security. Achieving global food security is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. A food-secure world is a safer and more secure world. Freedom from hunger is a basic right for all humans, and those of us in agriculture have a commitment to upholding that covenant. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank you for holding this important hearing, and I look forward to working with you and all the members as we continue to strengthen these effective programs. Thank you for allowing me to have the opportunity to speak here and then step away for a few minutes. Thank you. STATEMENT OF HON. PAT ROBERTS, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS, CHAIRMAN, U.S. COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY Chairman Roberts. I will proceed with my opening statement and wish you good luck in your endeavors--or our endeavors. Senator Stabenow. Yes. Chairman Roberts. We hope that you can make it back as soon as possible. As the distinguished Ranking Member has pointed out, one in nine people today, 800 million worldwide, will go to bed hungry. Around the world, impoverished regions are facing increasing challenges in trying to feed their people, from political unrest, social conflict like what we face in places like Yemen or Syria, to weather-driven crises with what we currently see in East Africa. As Chairman of this Committee and former Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I can assure you there is no issue in global security more timely or more relevant than food security. Show me a nation that cannot feed itself, and I will show you a nation that is in chaos. American farmers and ranchers have a deep understanding of the need to feed a troubled and hungry world. Back in 1953, a young Kansas farmer by the name of Peter O'Brien had the idea that U.S. farmers could give aid to other countries in the form of our commodities. He made the suggestion at a countywide Farm Bureau meeting, and eventually a resolution was accepted by both the Kansas Farm Bureau and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The next year, U.S. Senator from Kansas Andy Schoeppel, with the help of another Senator from Kansas, Frank Carlson, my former boss, sponsored a bill that was ultimately signed into law by yet another native son of Kansas, Dwight David Eisenhower. To this day, the Food for Peace Program, commonly referred to as ``P.L. 480,'' provides aid to nearly every country in the world. Now, while P.L. 480 is an enormous instrument in fighting hunger, it is just one tool of many, one of many in the toolbox of assistance. Since 1985, the Department of Agriculture has been using the Food for Progress Program to help developing countries advance their own agricultural assistance, which would naturally benefit our farmers and ranchers and all of agriculture in this country. By increasing productivity and expanding market and trade opportunities, countries are better able to grow their economies and respond to any regional crisis. According to the USDA, last year the Food for Progress Program alone generated nearly 10,000 jobs and provided training for over 220,000 producers. Then we have the McGovern-Dole School Feeding Program, or the Dole-McGovern Program. Through that program, the Department and partners have the ability not only to provide a child with a nutritious meal for the day, but offer the opportunity to receive an education. Yes, it is ``female-friendly,'' a new term that I had discovered in reading testimony for this hearing. With two granddaughters and two live-wire daughters and a very active wife, I would recommend to all members, all male members of this Committee, to adopt that term, ``female- friendly.'' That works pretty good. Now, hard red winter wheat is currently traveling from fields in Kansas to Nicaragua in bags like the one that is shown over here to my right, right behind these very professional staff members who are trying to duck as I am pointing to the bag. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. At any rate, that is to be used as part of a school feeding program to boost nutrition among preschool and primary school children between the ages of 6 and 14. Under this Committee's leadership, we continued to help the mission of combating global hunger by making significant, realistic, and bipartisan reforms to food aid programs in the 2014 farm bill, adding flexibility, transparency, and efficiency. The United States has proven that American agriculture plays a pivotal role in addressing food shortfalls around the world, and we must continue to consider new and innovative ways to get ahead of the growing population and production challenges. We really have no other alternative. International trade and the role played by the United States will undeniably play a critical role in getting food to those who need it the most. It is not enough, however, to improve the yields of small holder farmers if there is not a market where it can be sold, a silo where it can be stored, or a road upon which it can be transported. The Department has invaluable expertise in developing agricultural policy and has the capability to offer important technical assistance to nations establishing critically needed infrastructure. I myself personally think that among all the feeding programs we have in the Department, we could do more and certainly share information to do a more coordinated effort. The private sector has expensive knowledge in the development of the necessary value chains and new technologies that can address country-specific challenges. Our friends at the Department, along with USAID, our land grant universities, our commodity organizations, our NGOs, our PVOs, have a strong history of working together to promote an efficient and affordable food supply. I am very proud of the critical role our agriculture has played and will continue to play in combating global hunger. Farmers and ranchers in Kansas and all across America are committed to doing our part to feed a troubled and hungry world. I ask unanimous consent to enter statements for the record on behalf of industry stakeholders. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. [The following information can be found on page 104 in the appendix.] Chairman Roberts. With that, we have recognized Senator Stabenow, so we will go ahead with our first panelist, our Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, Krysta Harden. The Committee extends a warm welcome to you this morning, Madam Secretary, in what I believe is your first time before our Committee since your confirmation hearing. Welcome back. Thank you for joining us to talk about an issue that I know is very close to your heart. Deputy Secretary Harden returned just weeks ago from a trade mission to Sub-Saharan Africa, and I know you will share some of your findings. The Deputy Secretary hails from Camilla, Georgia, where she began her roots in agriculture, coming from a line of three generations of southwest Georgia farmers. Ms. Harden has held leadership positions at the Department as Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations and Chief of Staff to the Secretary, at the National Association of Conservation Districts as the chief executive officer, and with the American Soybean Association as senior vice president of Gordley Associates. She received her B.A. in journalism from the University of Georgia. I have a note down here from staff saying that it is imperative that I say, ``Go, Dogs.'' [Laughter.] Ms. Harden. Thank you for not saying the year I graduated. I appreciate that. Chairman Roberts. Right. Welcome back, Deputy Secretary, and I look forward to your testimony. You are recognized. Thank you so much. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE KRYSTA HARDEN, DEPUTY SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, DC Ms. Harden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the members that are here. My home state senator, thank you very much for being here. The last time I was here for my confirmation hearing as Deputy in August of 2013, it seems like a long time ago and then sometimes like yesterday. But the Committee has always been very gracious and very generous to me, and I appreciate that very much. Thank you for going through my background. I think it is very important for this type of hearing to recognize where I came from, and it is from production agriculture. My parents are still on the farm, and my entire career I have thought about trade and markets that have been the focus of my very fun and successful career in this town and working in agriculture. But that has changed, and I hope, Mr. Chairman, that it is okay if I just talk. I have a written statement that all of you have. Chairman Roberts. Certainly. Ms. Harden. But instead of reading something--you can all read. Instead of doing that, I am just going to talk, and I will try to look at these lights, but I get wound up and long- winded when I talk about this, so I will try to be as brief as I can and hope the Committee will indulge me. When I joined the Administration in 2009, President Obama made his first farm policy priority global food security, and I recognized that I had some learning to do. I was aware of the issues in the abstract. I thought about them. I was certainly aware of the tools that USDA had from my time with the Soybean Association. But it was not an area that I knew very well or had delved into or really felt a connection to. I, like a lot of folks, need to learn firsthand. Getting briefed, going to meetings, listening to others can only go so far. For me, it really is about getting on the ground. Talking to our staff on the ground, talking to NGOs, talking with the folks that we are reaching out to, that we are interacting with, and hopefully helping is the best way for me to learn. I just dove right in as Deputy. With the Secretary's blessing and encouragement and with our team at USDA and partners across the Federal family, I was able to lead a trade mission to Sub-Saharan Africa after I was Deputy just for a month. But I also went to Mozambique to see our work on the ground there. But one of the turning points for me was this spring when I really kind of got it, when the light bulbs went off for me, and I hope you will indulge me in this story. It was in Honduras. I usually want to go to Africa. My heart is kind of there, but I went to Honduras and Guatemala in Central America and went with our Ambassador 4 hours from the capital city. I grew up on a dirt road, so I know about dirt roads. But I had never seen one like this. We drove almost to El Salvador, I think, to this tiny village with this wonderful little elementary school. We were greeted by kids standing out all lined up singing a song--I cannot tell you what is was-- waving American flags, cheering, so happy we were there. It was very, very moving. You could not ask for a grander--it was like the red carpet on Oscar night. It was just that kind of moving situation. The Ambassador and I were able to serve lunch to third and fourth graders, little kids, like kids anywhere except they brought their own little bowls from home. The mothers fix the food every day, the porridge for them, and it was a soy-corn mix that was provided by the U.S. This was--I am going to get this right--a Dole-McGovern project. I should have said that from the beginning. These kids were just so happy and so normal and just delighted we were there, looked so healthy, so good. Some of the kids took us to a garden that they have on campus that the parents work with them in, and they are supplementing their diet with fruits and vegetables that we know is important, and your changes in the farm bill with LRP helped so that these kids actually had it on campus and did not have to have it from the community. Dads were there putting in latrines so the girls would stay in school. They need separate latrines. Everything you would think, even this remote area, you could see the difference that we were making. I was just feeling great. As we were winding down the visit, we went to the kindergarten. Here are little kids. I know little kids. They are squirmy at 5. They are wiggly, they are active. These kids were not. Their hair was dull, their skin was dull, their eyes were lifeless. They were sweet, they were kind, and you could sit down at the little tables and talk to them. But they did not have the benefit of the nutrition that the older kids have had. The stark reality of what our support and our help and the generosity of American farmers and American taxpayers in that school, seeing the difference in someone who has not had the ability to have a balanced diet, not to have good nutrition, was so amazing to me. I was not prompted about this. No one said, ``You are going to see a big difference. Look for this.'' It just was so amazing to see the difference. This one little girl's face I will never forget. I hope to see her after she has had a couple years of our rations. The other thing that I will never forget about this school was a sixth grader, a young girl, stood up and read to us a little--kind of a poem, something to me and the Ambassador about her learning, and thanking us for being there, just a bright, a very talented young woman. Her question to us was, ``Please help me go to high school. Help me continue my education.'' I think about kids in our country, I think about kids in other places who take so much for granted, who do not want to get up in the morning, who complain about homework, who do not want to go to school. Here is a young woman who knows the only way she is likely to be able to go is if we help. It is just a memory, sir, that I will never forget. It is memories that make me know that our investments, that our caring, our commitment, what we do, how we use the tools and the flexibilities that Congress has given us at USDA makes such a difference in lives, in people. It is not about numbers. It is not about dollars. It is about giving hope and opportunity and a chance. They do not want handouts. They want partners. I think that is what USDA does. I know that red light has been on, and I apologize, but I just thank the Committee for your work, for the additional reforms and changes. LRP is going to offer yet another tool for us. I appreciate the commitment this Committee has shown to this agenda, and you personally, sir. I know that the Dole- McGovern Program is at USDA I believe from one of your efforts a long time ago, to make sure that it stayed at the Department. It was a wise decision. Thank you, and I encourage the members of the Committee, when you travel--and I have traveled with a couple of you, and we saw this firsthand. When you are out, I know you are busy, you have a lot of demands on your time and a lot of projects to see. I encourage you to work with USDA to get out to a school, and you will see firsthand the difference your commitment and your investment makes in someone's life. Thank you, sir. I look forward to further questions and discussion. [The prepared statement of Ms. Harden can be found on page 45 in the appendix.] Chairman Roberts. Well, thank you for your personal testimony and your personal story, if it can be described as that. That is always helpful to put it in those terms, and I just have a couple of questions here for you. One of the most powerful tools that we have in our arsenal to combat hunger is the research being done at and through the Department of Agriculture, partnerships with entities such as our land grant universities. I am very proud of my university, my alma mater, Kansas State, one of the leading partners in the Feed the Future research effort, hosting four innovation labs that work in areas like post-harvest loss, the development of heat-resistant and high-yielding crops. My question would be: How do we take advantage of the long history and extensive knowledge we have of research, extension, and public-private partnerships, particularly in areas that you have described, in areas of the world that lack that structure? How do we put that together? Ms. Harden. Thank you, sir. One thing I have found when I have traveled is--and I am sure you have witnessed this as well--extension and our land grant system are the envy of the world. We have such great partnerships and the partnership USDA has with both is very valid. I do not go anywhere that I do not see logos from our favorite land grants, and Kansas State certainly being one. Working on the ground with our land grants, having students go learn, having research done and research shared with our partners around the world I think is one of the key benefits of our system and being able to share that. The Cochran and Borlaug, both of those programs I think are very key to the exchange of information as well, and you remember that the Committee has supported both of these for many, many years and making sure that researchers and scientists and other leaders from developing countries come to the U.S. and train at our land grants, learn about our systems, learn how to collect data, learn how to share that information with their producers. So I think that we use our tools in as many ways as we can, the flexibilities that we have in building these partnerships. I am reminded of a processing plant in Guatemala that I visited. They had graduated out of our programs, our Food for Progress programs, but were still very much viable, exporting snow peas and beans the day I was there to the U.K., the workers walking around with caps on their heads, I think it was Texas A&M and maybe Arizona State just happened to be at that facility. But the lasting deep relationship that many people in these countries form with our universities I think is part of the residual benefit, the connections that they have. I think that it is a lasting commitment, and we see the results of that in the work on the ground, and I commend our land grant universities for their continued commitment to this agenda as well. Chairman Roberts. We have a lot of resources and capabilities at the USDA. What resources and capabilities do you think would enable us to better and effectively deliver food aid under programs such as McGovern-Dole, strengthen the agricultural development in other countries through Food for Progress? What skills and programs are underutilized? Just to add another question there so we can both share the red light here, are there things that you could be doing or should be doing that are currently limited by Federal rules and regulations? Ms. Harden. Well, I will first answer the first part of that, and thinking about LRP, I am very hopeful we get a budget next week or very soon, and we will have for the first time a full program in LRP and we can actually utilize and complement, the McGovern-Dole/Dole-McGovern program by being able to buy locally, to have a more balanced diet for kids in that program. I think we will see additional results if we are able to fully utilize that program, which is $20 million in our budget proposal. If we are funded, that is three or four different projects somewhere around the world where we can see the benefits. I think that is definitely very important. I think the beauty of what we have at USDA in our programs is flexibility, to be able to adapt to the need and the desire and the demands and the needs of the communities that we are working in and being able to leverage our dollars. We look for projects where there is going to be buy-in from not only the national government but the local government, to be able to cut through the red tape, to be able to have lasting programs and get results, and also to use our NGOs, who are on the ground with so many resources. So I think it is the partnerships that we build at USDA with all those that I just outlined, very much our land grants, I should mention that again as well, and being able to use the flexibilities that we have. Chairman Roberts. My time has expired. I apologize to my colleagues. You did not mention any Federal rules or regulations that hamper you. If there are none, you are the only one in Washington that---- [Laughter.] Ms. Harden. I guess I was just trying to be diplomatic, sir. Chairman Roberts. You can submit that for the record, if you would like. Ms. Harden. I will do that. That is a good idea. Chairman Roberts. Okay. I appreciate that. Ms. Harden. Thank you. [The following information can be found on page 64 in the appendix.] Chairman Roberts. Senator Perdue. Senator Perdue. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am really proud to have somebody from my home State with roots at the--I know what the dirt road looks like down in Camilla, Georgia. I have a little story, too. I saw the results of what you do in Haiti last year. After the election, my wife and I went down and spent a weekend at an orphanage down there, and we saw that one meal a day, and it really does make a difference. But I have three questions I would love to give you. I am going to just lay them out first and let you answer these at your discretion. Ms. Harden. Certainly. Senator Perdue. One is this technology transfer. As you mentioned in your testimony, our universities, our land grant universities, as well as companies, the technology that we have developed in agriculture over the last 30 years is phenomenal. Our productivity has gone up dramatically. I have a very good friend who is CEO of Pioneer Seed Company, part of DuPont, and I look at corn just as an example. Productivity in corn since I was a kid, harvesting corn on our farm, I mean, it is just incredible. That only enhances our ability to help the rest of the world. So this technology transfer is one question. Can you speak to that? Second is the procurement. LRP you mentioned a couple times, but can you mention how important that flexibility is long term? I want to remind the Committee for the record that it is important that we work on technology transfer, because honestly--and I say this with all due respect--40 percent of what we spent last year as a Federal Government, including every one of our philanthropy programs, 40 percent of those programs, Mr. Chairman, was borrowed. That means these programs are in great jeopardy, and we cannot let anything happen to these programs. I know the need out there. The third area is waste. You mentioned in your written testimony 30 percent or so of the world's food production is waste. Can you just speak to those three briefly for us? Ms. Harden. I certainly can, sir. Thank you. They are all very valid and good questions, and, again, it is quite an honor to be with my home state senator always. I am so glad we always have a member from Georgia on the Ag Committee. It is nice to have two pictures up here, which we need to keep having more. Tech transfer, Secretary Vilsack often says that science has got to be shared, and technology has to be shared. It is something I think USDA has been a leader in around the world with our partners, looking at the great research and the science and the technology that we do have and sharing with our partners who do not. I was reminded of a story of how weather is just such a huge thing, weather predictions, for farmers. I mean, that is the first thing my Daddy asks, and it is the last thing he does before going to bed, is, ``What is the weather?'' so you know how to make decisions. He even asks me about weather here. I do not know why, but that is important to him. That is always the first question. Thinking about a producer in a remote area that does not get a weather report, has absolutely no idea. They do not know that the storm is coming. They do not know not to harvest and put maize out to dry and the weather is going to come. They do not even have the ability to know. So how do we communicate better, how do we share that kind of data on some of the very basic fundamental issues, not even the more complicated that you are addressing, I think is something that USDA wants to be and has been a leader on and will continue to focus on with this Committee's help. For LRP, long term I think it is the same relationship we see in our country in some ways with Farm to School, buy-in from a local community, a connection with that school, ownership of what is happening there, relationships, a local group of farmers who can help feed the kids in their school, whether they have kids there or not. Building those ties I think is very key. Also just the balanced diet that the kids will get, even if they are getting our porridge, our rations from the U.S., just like kids here, they need more vegetables, and being able to make that connection. But it is not just nutrition. It is also the buy-in and the commitment from that community who wants that school to stay open, they want their kids going there, they have a connection there. It is a market for them. It is a way to provide the sense of community and investment in education for all kids, boys and girls. Food waste, that could be a whole hearing on food waste, and the Committee maybe should do that at some point. Thirty percent is lost. In our country, it is more at the institutional level. At the personal level, folks like me who go to the farmers' market, I need three apples. I buy nine because I want to help that farmer, and then I do not eat them. I buy all this wonderful produce, and I swear to my husband every night, ``We are going to eat at home. I am going to cook, or you are going to cook.'' Then we go out. So a lot of us in the U.S. make those kind of decisions, but around the world it is post harvest, and it is some of the issues I have talked about, with not knowing weather, not being able to predict weather, not being able to gather crops, not having the tools to do so, the equipment to do so, the people to do so. Sometimes it can be a variety of things. But in the U.S., we have a pledge to cut food waste in half in the U.S. by 2015, and we are going to continue to work with the rest of the world. I was able to lead a discussion at the UN Conference this fall on these very issues with all of our partners around the world. How do we address these issues? We are going to have 9 billion plus people to feed by 2050. We need to be looking at all these tools, and food waste is one of them. Senator Perdue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Roberts. Senator Heitkamp. Senator Heitkamp. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Deputy Secretary, for such a moving and appropriate opening statement. I think we do a lot especially in agriculture and alphabet soup, whether we call it Dole-McGovern or, USAID or USDA or this program and that program, we certainly saw a lot of them--World Food Program--when we are looking internationally. But the reality is that for those of us who have been to these places, especially rural communities in countries like El Salvador and countries like Ethiopia, we see the absolute critical need to engage. That engagement is not just about humanitarian interest. It is in our national security interest. We are seeing, again, because of the disruption of security in El Salvador, we are seeing a surge again at the border of unaccompanied minors, a lot of those children who are most at risk. I have been to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in the last probably 4 or 5 months and have seen what that migration from rural areas, for lack of ability to make a living, to urban areas, the disruption, the social disruption that that has created and what has happened in terms of risk. So I want to talk not just about these programs but talk about the value of these programs in getting to those communities where there you can start talking about soil science, you can start talking about co-ops, you can start talking about storage of crops, maybe even get a little electricity so that they can download weather reports. I mean, there are a whole lot of things that we will never be able to feed the world from relief programs. I would like you to just speak to how this gives you an entree into those communities and what advice you would give us as we move through, I think, this discussion about food security and making sure that committees like the Ag Committee remain in charge of this distribution, because at the end of the day what we are trying to do is create more opportunity globally for farmers. Ms. Harden. Thank you, Senator. You and I have talked about these issues many times, and I know we share a passion for them, and so it is great to be with you today. A lot of things you hit on are so true. I think we all know that it is much better if kids are listening to a teacher instead of their empty stomach growling, and that is what our programs are able to do, and it does build stronger communities, it offers jobs, when we are in a location and can actually provide opportunity for the young people to be educated and to help their families, help their communities. So I have seen the benefits of our programs and our work on the ground, and I hope that this Committee continues to provide us the flexibilities like with LRP and other reforms that give us more tools to get to work with folks. As I said earlier, people do not want a handout. They want a partner. I think that is what we are at USDA. I think that we relate so well to folks in rural communities. When I am on the ground, it is like rural communities here. It is so fun to sit and talk with a group of farmers. I always talk to women farmers, as you know, but men and women farmers relate to each other. You could be anywhere, except for some language barriers sometimes, it is anywhere. They are worried about weather. They are worried about what is happening on their operations. They are worried about their families. Farmers and ranchers are the same at the heart level. I do believe that. We have so many tools here that we can share, and I think we need to do that. Senator Heitkamp. We have a lot of really great partners in the philanthropic world--Howard Buffett, the Gates Foundation very involved, we saw their work in terms of doing extension. But one of the things--and I had a chance to just spend time with Mike Johanns before he left, who I have just such tremendous respect for, and I said, doing international work, what is the one priority that you think we should exercise? He said, building out co-ops and that extension. Extension and co- ops have really--I mean, they are the bedrock of what we have been able to do in American agriculture. How can we do a better job assisting in building out, farmer-to-farmer relationships internationally and then obviously, extension, which is critically needed? Ms. Harden. I think a couple of things, and I have mentioned some of them already with our Cochran and Borlaug exchanges. I think having folks come from other countries, come to the U.S. to understand how we do that, how things are set up to be able to take that back home and do it working with folks, there is no doubt extension and our land grant systems are the envy of the world, and we probably take them for granted. But being able to help do that, and co-ops as well, and for women in particular, I think it is very helpful. These are small farm holders. They are not large, so you do not need a huge tractor. You need a small machine or tool that you can actually share and work together. I saw a great co-op, milk collection, in Rwanda this summer where the milk is delivered sometimes by hand and by bicycle, a can strapped to the back of a bicycle, or maybe a little motor scooter. This is, a couple of cows, but it is delivered every day, and these farmers--many of them are women--are bringing their milk there together, and it is pasteurized and provided for the local community. So there are small co-ops. It is a different concept. It is teaching and explaining and gathering information and sharing it with many of the farmers in other countries. We just take it for granted. We understand how working together might make sense. We have to help teach and guide and show them how this can be done. Senator Heitkamp. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Roberts. Senator Klobuchar. Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you very much. Deputy Secretary, I want to thank you for your incredible work, and last year, Senator Heitkamp and myself and Senator Stabenow and Senator Hirono and Senator Cantwell had the opportunity to travel with you to Africa on the first-ever women Senators trip. We would have invited you, Mr. Chairman, but it did not work. Glass ceiling. But I wanted to commend you for your work not only on that trip, but just how hard you work in terms of making not only the words sound so meaningful at this hearing, but also actually taking action. There we saw on that trip in Senegal, Tanzania, and Ethiopia some of the partnerships going on with companies from my State like General Mills and Cargill in terms of getting more nutritious food, like at Faffa Baby Food, a place I think the President later visited. Could you talk about how we can build on this public- private partnership in terms of making sure that we increase the effectiveness of our own Government programs? Ms. Harden. I think we have to. There is absolutely no way that we can do it by ourselves in the Federal family, and we should not be, frankly. We need the investment and the buy-in and the commitment from other partners, and we do have that in the private sector. I remember the incidents with the food as well. There is fortification of products that are done. I was just in Ghana recently, as the Chairman mentioned, and went to a facility that Hershey from Pennsylvania is actually supporting with peanuts. Not coming from Georgia, that was the only kind of downside about this project, but they were actually making a fortified supplement, a nutritional supplement for kids, an investment working with USDA, working with private entities, working with our land grants. It is all about partnerships, and we continue to look for opportunities. That way we can leverage the resources that we do have to get them to more places, to more people, and to make a bigger difference. Senator Klobuchar. Very good. The other aspect of that trip is we focused a lot on women in agriculture, and then closer to home, I know you visited Minnesota and North Dakota. I have a great photo of the three of us and a rather large piece of agricultural equipment. We know that women account for more than 60 percent of global food production. They are the backbone of so many of our rural economies in the developing world, yet they face challenges of land rights, access to credit. So they are basically doing the work, but do not always have the ownership or get the amount of money that they should for their work. I know that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that if women had access to the same resources as men, their farms would increase yields by 20 to 30 percent. That alone would alleviate hunger for 100 to 150 million people. In what ways do our current food assistance programs focus on empowering women as part of the solution to world hunger? Ms. Harden. I could talk the whole day about women and the work of women and the dedicated, hard work that they do around the world, in our country as well as in developing countries even more so. They are also responsible for raising their kids, taking care of their families. I think of a woman that I met in Ethiopia at a small dairy, and she was one of the women who actually had men working for her, very unusual, with seven men, including her husband, and she had a methane digester that heated her cook stove in her house. She could not read or write, and so everything that she learned through this program was by demonstration. So many women, they are ambitious. They want to do more. Ritu Sharma is quoted as saying that if you teach a woman to fish or farm, that she will not only feed her family but her community. I believe that is exactly right. The numbers that you read are so disturbing to me personally, to think about that women do not have access to credit. Maybe 10 percent of that 50 or 60 percent that are farming, and they are producing about 80 percent of the food, many of them cannot own land or transfer land. I think about my own family. If anybody told me that my sister and I could not inherit our farm, I cannot imagine how that must feel to young women, to daughters, to granddaughters, to nieces, to think that that would not be available. Senator Klobuchar. So do you think that with the aid that we do give we could use that as leverage to get these countries to change their laws? Ms. Harden. I think there are a couple of things we do. We make sure girls get educated, and we focus our feeding programs on girls. We highlight girls. Many of them not only come to school because they can get a meal that day, but there are bags of beans or rice that they can take home. So it is an incentive for the entire family to make sure that girl, that daughter, those daughters are educated. We can make sure the girls feel comfortable going to school, that they have separate latrines. There are things that we can do to help educate so the decisions come--they become the leaders, they become from the ground up. One of the most powerful, effective Ministers of Agriculture on the continent of Africa in my personal opinion is a woman in Rwanda, and she is just a dynamo. She participated in the Borlaug program at Michigan State. I am sorry that Senator Stabenow did not hear me say that. She is back home, and when you talk to her about issues about women farmers and women landownership, she was educated, and she came here, and she understands the value and the need. We have to empower women. We have to keep the pressure on. I remember when we met with the Prime Minister in Ethiopia, and we raised the question to him and he said, ``Even though it may be not the law, as long as I am Prime Minister, it is going to be this way.'' Well, what about when you are not? That is the questions we have to continue to answer. So I think it is from the top down and asking the questions, encouraging the dialogue at your level, at my level, the Secretary's level. But it is also making sure that girls are educated and we are helping to do that with the programs that we have on the ground, and then working with women farmers, business owners. I had a roundtable in Ghana with 40 producers, small business owners, researchers--all women-- talking about the barriers of export and how they get involved. We can help and empower them often by being there and using all of our tools and our flexibilities. I know I am out of time. I told you I could get wound up on this one, so I am sorry. Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you. Well, I am glad you have shared that with all of us, so it was very meaningful, and I hope--of course, women are not the only ones that can raise the issue. Everyone can raise this issue. Ms. Harden. Exactly right. Senator Klobuchar. Because I think it is one of the keys to moving forward here internationally. Thank you. Ms. Harden. Thank you. Chairman Roberts. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar, and thank you for targeting a most important topic. Madam Secretary, thank you for your passion. Senator Boozman? Senator Boozman. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I thank Senator Klobuchar for her question. It is interesting, and you know better than anybody, but the instance of grinding poverty has decreased substantially in the last 10 years, and a lot of it is due to the fact that, through our hard work and others' hard work, we have a situation where people can get out and start earning a living by breaking down in Africa just the barriers of the borders, all of those kind of things. The good news is it seems like that, the various countries involved see that they are having success, and it is kind of snowballing a little bit. But I think that anything we can do along with the food aid, as the Senator is alluding to, to help that process, particularly with women, them being such the fabric of the society in these different countries, is really very beneficial. So I would just echo what she brought up. We continue to be the most generous Nation on the Earth as far as providing food aid. Since World War II, I think we have literally saved millions of people from malnourishment and things. We can be so very, very proud of that. As the co-chair of the Hunger Caucus and then somebody that represents lots of farmers in Arkansas, like I say, we are very, very proud of all that we have done. Can you talk a little bit about the USDA Food Aid Program and the impact it is having on the world in these very difficult situations where people desperately need some help? Ms. Harden. Yes, thank you, sir. We are very fortunate, I think, at USDA to have so many tools that we can use. As I mentioned earlier in the very beginning of my statement, being able to adapt the tools that we have, have the flexibilities to create partnerships, to adapt to the needs and concerns, to build the relationships on the ground, to work with the private sector, NGOs, and other partners from the U.S., I think that is what is most effective for us. Also having buy-in from the national government where we are, so when we are not just there, we pull out, the program is graduated and it goes away. What have we accomplished? We have helped for a few years, but we do not have that lasting residual benefit. So I think we are very careful and try to be at USDA to make sure we have not only buy-in at the national level when we have projects, but also at the local level. I mentioned the school on Honduras where the entire community embraced that little elementary school. LRP is going to give us even more opportunities. I was talking earlier about having the local procurement of vegetables and maybe fruits for a school so the community sees the benefit of having kids in that school. It is a market for them. That helps build infrastructure. It helps with storage. It helps with all the things that are needed to make sure that the farmers stay successful. It just helps build an infrastructure. I also would just add that our trade does the same as well. Senator Boozman. I was going to ask about that. I know you were in Sub-Saharan Africa promoting---- Ms. Harden. Yes, sir, with a lot of Arkansans. Senator Boozman. Well, again, promoting--we talked about the importance of jobs in solving these, but talk a little bit about trade in regard to that. Ms. Harden. Yes, sir. I just mentioned the trip to Ghana, as the Chairman mentioned in the very beginning. I led a trade mission and included--also I was very happy to see a number of States represented, including Kansas, sir, as well had a representative from the State Department of Agriculture. We were looking at ports. We were looking at refrigeration. We were looking at all the elements in the chain that are needed to have trade. Trade is two-way. We were looking at markets there. There is a growing consumer group in western Africa, actually in Ghana, but there were representatives and buyers probably from five or six or ten other countries in that area wanting our goods, really wanting the quality, the consistency that you get from American product, but the infrastructure has to be there. We spent a lot of time at the port, looking at where the goods would come in. Is there enough refrigeration? Are there enough checks and balances there to make sure folks are going to get paid? There are certain kind of issues that you have to work through. But as we worked through being able to have the two-way trade, it builds infrastructure that the local producers can use as well, and I think that is the residual benefit. Senator Boozman. Right. One last thing. You talked about in your testimony the worldwide demand for food is going to increase 60 percent by 2050, really being able to feed 9, 10 billion people. Can you talk about the importance of agricultural research in meeting that demand? Ms. Harden. It is so understated, sir. I do not think the rest of the public understands the value--they do not even understand the results of the research that we have gotten, that they benefit from every day, that not only our farmers and ranchers benefit from but consumers do. So I think we still need to continue to have the investments in ag research. We very much appreciate the foundation that was created in the last farm bill by this Committee. I think that is one step in making sure that we can leverage private dollars with public dollars, but we certainly need to be focusing on many of these key issues, and working with our land grant institutions as well. I think it will be the combination of the Federal Government as well as land grants and the private sector. Senator Boozman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Roberts. Senator Ernst. You are recognized, Colonel. Senator Ernst. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate that. Thank you very much, Secretary Harden, for being here today. When the USDA and other agencies that are involved in that whole-of-government approach to food aid programs determine where to focus their efforts, is the political stability of the country or the region that you are looking at, is that a factor when making those determinations? Ms. Harden. It certainly has to be for USDA, and that is who I will speak to. When we are looking at the best places to make investments and build these partnerships, you have got to have a partner. You have got to have a willing and able partner to make sure that there is a lasting commitment, as I was talking with the Senator from Arkansas just a moment ago, making sure that there is buy-in, there is commitment. We obviously want to make sure that our personnel are safe, so you want to go to places that are stable, but also where there is a commitment from the other governments, whether it is at the national level and the local level, to make sure there is buy- in, so it is not just a drop in the bucket, that it is leveraged, that it is a lasting commitment, and so you do need, again, a willing partner from the host country. Senator Ernst. Then looking at those willing partners, then, do you look at what that national security risk might be to the United States to determine would that be a willing partner? Is it worth a long-term investment to make sure that they are not--as we look at the turmoil in the Middle East, if we can help ease some of their food instability, maybe they would be less likely to produce people that would be wanting to harm us, is that part of the process as well? Ms. Harden. I think Senator Heitkamp, before you came in, Senator, talked a little bit about that. It also helps with national security. Global food security is also a national security issue, and I think you are exactly right. Hungry people, disgruntled people, nothing is worse--I know how irritable I get when I am a little bit late for a meal. I have never really missed a meal. I will be honest with you. I could probably miss a few and be okay. But I just know how aggravated I get, and I cannot imagine if that is a sustained symptom that you do not have enough food, how you are susceptible to others, I can see just in my own body how I react when I do not have enough nourishment. If it is chronic and if it is lasting, obviously there are going to be some problems. So we do look at that, and I was talking about Honduras earlier, and so was Senator Heitkamp, our work there, and Guatemala, trying to find opportunities for our young people, getting them educated, having them well fed, well nourished. That is very much part of the overall goal. Senator Ernst. That is very good. Earlier last week, I attended a conference in Des Moines that focused on a number of these issues, and food security, of course, is one. Then there are other avenues or lines of effort that we can use in making sure that the world is a more secure place. Since many of the commodity and food transfers are to areas of the globe that are not as politically stable as we are here in the United States, what do you see the role of the armed services in doing some of those food transfers or working in those particular regions? Ms. Harden. That is probably less of my expertise, but certainly in emergency situations, I know that the Government, the Department of Defense, has been involved in those things. In the work that we do at USDA, it is less involved. I believe maybe National Guard has been involved in some of our work in Afghanistan earlier in the Administration. I do not remember all the details, but the work that we do at USDA, it is less of a need for the Department of Defense to be involved. It might be for more emergency and certain situations. Senator Ernst. That is very good, because I know that we do--and Iowa has participated in this as well, but agricultural teams that have deployed through the Iowa Army National Guard, a number of other States have done that as well. Ms. Harden. Afghanistan may be an example. Senator Ernst. Afghanistan is a great example. We did have a team there about 4 or 5 years ago that did a rotation in Afghanistan. I think that is one way that we can utilize our military forces in those areas that are less stable than some of the other regions of the world in trying to teach and educate others. Any particular thoughts on those types of programs? Ms. Harden. I do not. Like I say, for USDA, we are usually in more stable environments than others may be, except maybe in emergency situations. So I do not have, but I am happy to talk to folks at USDA who know a lot more about this than I do, and we will get you an answer. Senator Ernst. Well, I appreciate it so much. Thank you, Mr. Chair, very much. Ms. Harden. Thank you, Senator. Senator Ernst. Thank you. Chairman Roberts. Senator Casey. Senator Casey. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and I am sorry I was not here earlier. I would just make a brief statement and maybe ask one question as well. First of all, I want to thank Deputy Secretary Harden for being here and for her work. As was discussed, I know, earlier today when I was not here, this issue of food security and how we put in place strategies to reduce the likelihood that someone does not have enough to eat around the world and here in the United States is a security issue. I know others have discussed that. It is literally a national security issue. The good news here is that in the last number of years, starting before the current administration but really amplified since then is the success, the remarkable success of Feed the Future, which I know is not the direct subject of today's hearing, but certainly has a connection. Senator Isakson and I are leading the effort to pass the Global Food Security Act, which would, in essence, codify, put into permanency the Feed the Future Program, which here are the numbers on Feed the Future: In 2014, Feed the Future reached more than 12 million children in the world with nutrition interventions and helped nearly 7 million farmers gain access to new tools or technologies to help them have greater yields with their crops and also to feed the world and especially to feed children. So among the many things we have got to do domestically, I want to make sure that we continue that success with Feed the Future. I want to ask, Deputy Secretary Harden, I know that USDA is a leading participant in what Feed the Future is, which is a whole-of-government approach. How can we better draw upon both USDA's expertise and resources to make sure that we keep moving in this direction with regard to Feed the Future especially, but maybe in some other contexts as well? Ms. Harden. Thank you, Senator, and thank you for your leadership and your commitment to this. Feed the Future has been extremely successful, and as I said in my opening statement, it was the President's very first foreign policy priority, and I believe it has been successful. I believe it is recognized as successful. There are 11 different agencies, you are right, who are involved in Feed the Future, and USDA certainly is front and center. We work very closely with our Federal family on the ground in many locations around the world. One of our main roles is capacity building, which I think is very key for the lasting residual commitment so that when we leave a community, there is still an infrastructure there, there is still the ongoing benefits of the investment. I think that is one of the great things we have. Our folks at USDA, to quote the Administrator of FAS, Phil Karsting, we are ``more work horses than show horses,'' so sometimes folks do not really fully know what we do on the ground. They just know the work gets done. We have that get- 'er-done attitude, as we do across USDA. Here in the U.S. our folks on the ground have the same kind of commitment to working with farmers and ranchers and helping landowners, helping them build infrastructure, helping them develop market streams so they can continue to create livelihoods for themselves and grow their operations and have stability. So I think the work that we are doing just needs to be continued and enhanced. I think that we know what to do on the ground. We know how to work with landowners and with the farmers. Senator Casey. I appreciate that. Mr. Chairman, I am giving back a minute. Thank you. Chairman Roberts. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. Secretary Harden, I just have one question. Ms. Harden. Yes, sir. Senator Grassley. That is, you stated in your testimony that the United States is the largest donor of food in the world. Do you have any figures on whether other countries come close to donating what the American taxpayers do along this same line? Ms. Harden. Sir, I do not have exact numbers. I am happy to get those for you. I know that the U.K. comes to mind. There are others, other developed countries and entities around the world that do. But I will be happy to get you those exact numbers. I do not have them off the top of my head. Senator Grassley. I would appreciate it for the record then. Ms. Harden. Yes, sir, I certainly will. Senator Grassley. Thank you. I yield back my 4 minutes and 23 seconds. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. That is rather remarkable, Senator Grassley. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. Senator Grassley, I have a note here delivered to me by Senator Boozman in your behalf stating that you are extremely disappointed that the leadership of this Committee is not providing snacks. [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. I would think you could at least as well as Ms. Stabenow. [Laughter.] Ms. Harden. Where are the Georgia peanuts, sir? Senator Brown. We kind of like sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds could work. Chairman Roberts. We will have order. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. Sir, the snacks have been delivered to the World Food Program. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. I think are on the way to Bangladesh. But we have a reserve. We do not have the necessary funds for that. Perhaps you could be of help to us in the appropriations process, so snacks will be delivered if you will just be calm. I know that is very difficult for you, but at any rate, we will have snacks for you momentarily. Would you like to---- Senator Grassley. Well, I am shocked at how fast you operate. Usually it is not that fast. Thank you very much. I will be glad to eat them. Chairman Roberts. You ask, we deliver. I am not sure where we are. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. Mr. Boozman? Senator Brown. Snickers? Chairman Roberts. You could share that down to Senator Thune and over here to Senator Brown. Senator Stabenow. Mr. Chairman, are those made in Kansas? Chairman Roberts. Yes. This is a Mars company product from Topeka, Kansas, as a matter of fact. Senator Brown. Koch brothers own it. Don't the Koch brothers own this? Senator Grassley. If you want to continue---- Chairman Roberts. If that is the case, you should consider that a hot basket, Sherrod. [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. If you want to continue this discussion, it was the Senator from Arkansas that had the idea of writing you the note, but it happened that he told me that---- Chairman Roberts. This is in your handwriting, sir. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. All right. Let us get back to a serious situation. Madam Secretary, I apologize for this diversion. Senator Brown? Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, Madam Secretary, thank you for the work that you have done on McGovern-Dole. A number of my colleagues have seen these programs at work. I was in Haiti a number of years ago and saw what it did for particularly getting young girls to school, what it does for the children themselves, what it does for the families, what they are able to take home in the evening and for weekends, and what it does for American agriculture, too. But there are fewer things that--I hate the cliche ``win-win-win,'' but there are fewer things that fulfill that the way McGovern-Dole does, so thanks for your leadership, your outspokenness, and always your assertiveness on that program. I wanted to ask you one question. In your testimony, you touch on the impact that climate change will have on agricultural production and food insecurity around the world, something that we do not maybe want to think about enough, the impact of what we are doing in this country on what happens for people who are self-sufficient, who are feeding themselves and their neighbors, and the impact that has especially on the poor in the developing world. Discuss, if you would, the ways USDA can prepare farmers in the developing world for these changes and work into that how USDA projects climate change will affect global hunger. Ms. Harden. It is interesting, Senator, that when you talk with farmers in this country or around the world, some of the conversations are very much the same. They worry about extreme weather. They worry about drought, pests, and disease. All the problems that our farmers have to deal with here farmers around the world are having to deal with. So the conversations are very similar. We are lucky here in that we do have tools to deal with many of these issues, and sharing those tools with the rest of the world is something that is a call to action, is something that USDA cares about, this Administration has supported, and making sure the information, the technology, the conservation practices. I know firsthand that our farmers and ranchers are the best stewards of the land and given the right tools--sometimes it is technical assistance, sometimes it is financial assistance, sometimes it is a combination. But given the right tools, the right information, they are going to make wise decisions about their natural resources. Farmers around the world, and landowners, do not always have those tools. They do not have that information. We have what Secretary Vilsack created here, Climate Hubs, which is just a place for information and data that farmers can go to to get it. I actually visited one. They are not actually bricks and mortar, but just a collection of information, and people who have worked together in Puerto Rico and looking at the coral reef loss and the impact of drought on Puerto Rico, and now countries in Central America are coming to that Climate Hub and saying, ``We would like that data. We would like that information. We are having very similar issues. We are neighbors in that region, and we would like to be able to have that information.'' So I think it is something that we can do, we can share our information, the data that we have, the conservation practices, the tools that our farmers are using in adapting to help mitigate many of the impacts of the changing climate. Senator Brown. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Chairman Roberts. Senator Stabenow. Senator Stabenow. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you, Deputy Secretary Harden. I apologize again for having to step away, and we appreciate your time. Obviously, there is a tremendous amount of interest in what you are talking about today and the important actions of the Department. I wondered if you could expand just a little bit more as you are talking about weather-related things and climate-smart agricultural initiatives, because the USDA is playing a leadership role, not just here with our farmers playing a leadership role, but internationally, the Secretary is speaking about this now. So how, when we look at the administration's overall effort to address global food security projects, a little bit more about the specifics of what is being done and what more could be done. Ms. Harden. Well, the Climate-Smart Alliance, as you mention, is just that. It is an alliance. It is a group of like-thinking countries and other groups who have come together to say we need to pay attention to this, we need to share information, and it creates a platform for being able to do that. As you know, we talked about that in our travels, in all of my travels. It always comes up with Ministers of Agriculture and other leaders to talk about how do we get this information. Again, as I was just saying with the last question, farmers and landowners have the same concerns. They see changes in trying to farm and produce food, and we know if we do not adapt, if we do not make changes ourselves in our conservation practices or how we farm, where we farm, if we do not use all the science and technology that is available, we are going to have greater problems. We have the information or much of it in the U.S., and sharing that and having the buy-in and the commitment to work together I think is what the alliance is able to do and really encourage the discussion, encourage the exchange of information and the science and the data that we have, and that is evolving. It changes all the time, and we need to make sure that we are staying on the forefront of these issues. Senator Stabenow. Thank you very much. I want to go back. I know you talked a little bit about AGOA in general, and it was so interesting for me when we traveled together to see that the majority of agriculture is women, leading the co-ops, doing the work, and so on, the vast majority, which was interesting to me. When we talked to the President of Ethiopia about the fact that to strengthen them from an economic standpoint, it meant empowering women to own their own land, to be able to get loans, to be able to have inheritance rights and so on. So when Senator Roberts and I led the amendment to AGOA, which would expand the USDA's role in trade capacity building specifically for women-owned farms and businesses, I wonder if you might talk about this new authority and what it means for USDA and how trade and the Foreign Agricultural Service can address the long-term food security issues by strengthening those from an economic standpoint that are doing the work. Ms. Harden. I can first just say thank you for your leadership to you and the Chairman for that amendment. I think it is spot on. I think it is exactly right. I hope that we get our budget soon and we can be ready to implement this. It is something I want to bird dog myself and make sure that it is done and done properly. I mentioned earlier, I think when you were out of the room, that I was able to host a roundtable just in Ghana recently with women farmers, small business owners, researchers, leaders, talking about exports and how they can send products to the U.S. They have products they want to send. They want to use AGOA benefits, but they have trouble with SPS. They have other issues. They do not understand all the requirements that we have. I think getting that implemented would help very much women just like the 40 that I happened to meet with and others around the continent work through those kind of delicate, sensitive, but very, very important issues to make sure that they can export to the U.S. They are ready to do so, they have product, but they need to know how to maneuver in many cases and get their products ready to meet our standards. So just hats off, thank you very much for that leadership, very well needed, very well timed. Senator Stabenow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Roberts. I have one other question, and I apologize to the other witnesses. We have some expert witnesses on the next panel. Imagine that you are with me in Dodge City, Kansas, and you are at the local restaurant where we have the Dodge City coffee klatch, which is my--these are all my advisers. They talk about the weather. They talk about price at the country elevator, et cetera, et cetera. You are familiar with these things with regards to Georgia. Ms. Harden. Yes, sir. Chairman Roberts. I turn to you and whisper that you might want to pick a number a little higher. It is a numbers game when they try to stick you for the coffee. [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. But I would like to have you explain to them why the LRP program is so important. They do not even know what that is. That is an acronym. We all have acronyms. I am not sure how to pronounce that one. I am not going to try it. But focus on that a little bit from the standpoint of developing or having the opportunity for a country to develop that capability and what that means for them in terms of price and in terms of the agricultural community of Dodge City to export products to that country. So I just have introduced you, and I say, ``Please explain to these farmers why LRP is important with regards to what you are doing.'' Ms. Harden. I would first hope they could understand my Southern accent, so you may have to be the translator. Chairman Roberts. Do not worry about it. Ms. Harden. But assuming that they could understand it, LRP, Local and Regional Procurement is what LRP stands for. We do talk a lot in Washington about acronyms, and it is a whole different language, and I am guilty of it myself, and we should not---- Chairman Roberts. Do not worry about that. Just explain to farmers why this is important. Ms. Harden. We should connect the dots. It is important because it actually gives a market, an opportunity for local farmers to connect with their schools, to connect with other entities in their own community. It creates a market and all the infrastructure that goes into that. It helps bring stability to a local community. It creates jobs. It creates a system, a purchasing system, a marketing system, an operations system for agriculture. Just like in a small town--I am from Camilla, Georgia, a small town. My Daddy grew up on a produce farm. You need markets. You do not have a long shelf life. It is not like a grain. You have to have a market, a nearby market in many cases. That is what this creates. It creates stability in communities. It gives jobs. It gives opportunity for local farmers to help themselves, to create markets for themselves. Chairman Roberts. But in turn, I am trying to describe to them how that benefits them. We have had a history of a Food for Peace Program and all the rest of the programs and the PVOs and the NGOs and the Gates Foundation and the UN, the World Food Program, and then all of the programs within the Department of Agriculture which is the basis of what we are doing, and you are doing an outstanding job. I know what some of these guys would say. They would say simply, ``Why don't we have an LRP program for Dodge City?'' We do in different ways. Ms. Harden. We do. Yes, sir, that is what I would say, is we do. Chairman Roberts. With different agencies. What I am trying to point out is that if you develop that to the degree that you have a stable community, and that is a tough--that is a high bar, but it also provides a market for us to sell them other things, fertilizer, tractors, et cetera, et cetera. It benefits them as well. Ms. Harden. It creates markets. If we want to sell, we have got to have someone able to buy. You have to have a customer. The way you create a customer and help build and establish a customer is to build stability and create a market, create demand. The only way you are going to do that is to have stability. Otherwise, we are just going to be giving handouts. We are just going to be donating. That is not what we want to do. We do that when we need to, when we have to and it makes sense. But to have the complete balance and help us create markets for our farmers, to help our farmers stay on the farm and ranch, which is what we want to do, we need markets outside of the U.S.. Chairman Roberts. Thank you for that. Ms. Harden. We need more markets here, and we need markets outside of the U.S. Chairman Roberts. Thank you so much for that. You have hit the nail on the head. We will not stick you for the coffee. I thank you for your testimony. We would like to welcome the next panel at this particular time. Ms. Harden. Thank you, sir. Chairman Roberts. We are eager to hear the testimony from all of you on this very important issue. We have compiled a panel of witnesses, I believe, who have broad experience and knowledge on these issues. Mr. Wade Ellis was named vice president and general manager of Bunge North America's Milling Unit in 2012. He has been with Bunge since 2003 where he has served as vice president of sales for milling and general manager of Bunge's Rice Mill in Woodland, California. Prior to Bunge, Mr. Ellis worked in the hybrid seed corn industry where he held various agronomic sales and consulting roles for especially hybrids, now a party of Monsanto. He received his bachelor's degree at Purdue University in agribusiness management--where a quarterback played at one time that threw a pass that defeated Kansas State in a bowl game, Mr. Drew Brees. I will not hold that against you. Welcome, Mr. Ellis. I look forward to your testimony. I will introduce the rest of the witnesses after you give your statement, sir. STATEMENT OF WADE ELLIS, VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER, BUNGE NORTH AMERICA MILLING, ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH AMERICA MILLERS ASSOCIATION, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI Mr. Ellis. Well, I appreciate the opportunity to be here, and I was at the Alamo Dome for that game, by the way. I was in school at the time. I am Wade Ellis. I am vice president and general manager of Bunge Milling, a part of Bunge North America in St. Louis. I oversee milling operations for Bunge in the states of Kansas, Nebraska, Illinois, California, and Indiana. Raised on a corn and soybean farm in central Indiana myself, where my mother and father still operate today, one of the greatest joys I have in my work is seeing the process connected from start to finish where Bunge gets to truly operate in the middle of the agriculture supply chain. We connect America's growers to food processors and consumers alike, and seeing the country's hard work translating to feeding the world is something we are all very proud of each day. For decades, Bunge has been proud to provide ready-to-use foods for distribution in the U.S. food aid programs. What began as a program to supply large bulk quantities of simple products has shifted to a product line of high-quality, nutritious foodstuffs to meet the requirements of famine emergencies wherever they occur. We can specially prepare foods for infants, children, their mothers, the elderly, and others with specific needs. Ready-to-use therapeutic foods now supplement local staples, and when they are used together, our food aid products become more effective in saving lives and mitigating the effects of malnutrition. Many of our products over the years have been formulated to provide vital nutrients quickly and efficiently in forms and flavors acceptable to people with widely varying diets. Working with other companies and the USDA over the years, we have contributed to the progress and enrichment of blended foods by volunteering resources and expertise. Further, we have made significant investments in both our milling and packaging capabilities to best meet the changing needs of the distribution and storage requirements of these programs. Now, our role as processors of these vital products gives us a unique perspective into the value this program brings from one end of the value chain to the other. Ultimately, the real winners are the people receiving the U.S. food aid in an acceptable, usable form, with other benefits accruing up and down the food supply chain to the Nation itself. Looking back at some of the history on P.L. 480, now 60- plus years, some of President Eisenhower's remarks stuck out to me. He knew that the collapse of political systems as well as crop failures leave millions without food or the means to acquire it. When help does not come to people caught in these circumstances, the world becomes a more dangerous place. President Eisenhower saw Food for Peace among the best tools he had at his disposal. One look at the USAID food bags with the words ``From the American People,'' people understood that America was responding to their need. Food for Peace buoyed the U.S. reputation for doing good in the world, and it still brings the agricultural sector a major source of pride today. Bunge representatives have made numerous visits in-country to see our products in action, and the sense of pride is immeasurable upon return. The world has changed tremendously since this Committee considered legislation to formalize food aid in 1954. What has not changed is the need for food aid. Crises stemming from hunger occur all too frequently today, and they reshape the world as we know it. Back-to-back crop shortfalls in key producing areas were a catalyst to popular uprisings in the Middle East not even a decade ago. Today the consequences continue to reverberate around us. Also unchanged is the agricultural sector's pride and the support for this program. We have faith that the Senate and House Agriculture Committees will maintain a vision of Food for Peace consistent with its original intent. As it evolves to meet the needs of a world with 9 billion people, new flexibilities will be needed. P.L. 480 also has a role to play in achieving a 70-percent increase in world grain and oilseed production by 2050. Its farmer-to-farmer connections, its support for education by feeding school children in the developing world, its ties to global institutions that monitor supply-and-demand balances, and its overall contribution to food safety and security are important assets for the future. It will take many commitments in many forms to feed the world. Just as there is an imperative now for food aid, the imperative for food aid will always be with us. Specific expertise in food aid and an industry positioned to provide it will also be necessary. With compassion and prudence, the U.S. should continue to claim this as one of our areas of expertise contributing to a better world. Thank you again for the opportunity to be here, and I look forward to answering questions later. [The prepared statement of Mr. Ellis can be found on page 40 in the appendix.] Chairman Roberts. Thank you. Our next witness is Mr. Leach, a well-known witness testifying on world hunger, food programs, what we can do, what we should be doing, what we should not be doing. Please proceed. STATEMENT OF RICHARD LEACH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WORLD FOOD PROGRAM USA, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Leach. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Roberts and Senator Stabenow, not only for convening this hearing, but for your steadfast, unrelenting, and longstanding commitment to addressing global hunger. If I may, before my planned comments, I would like to acknowledge that early this morning or late last night, a good friend, a great American statesman, Sandy Berger, passed away. Sandy served on our board for almost a decade and did a lot of work for us and for the Government as it pertains to the link between national security and food security. The people he has impacted around the world will ensure that his legacy will continue, and I felt it was important to acknowledge his planning this morning. U.S. support has been and is today vital in helping the World Food Program provide life-saving assistance to upwards of 80 million people in more than 82 countries. It provides hope to communities grappling with natural disasters, refugees fleeing conflict, and families living in extreme poverty. U.S. food has alleviated hunger and has literally transformed lives. In fact, over 3 billion people in more than 150 countries have been helped by U.S. food aid since the Food for Peace program was launched in 1954. It has promoted global stability, responded to humanitarian needs, whether caused by conflict or natural disaster, and contributed to economic development. As was said earlier, providing food to those suffering from hunger is a statement about the American people. Moreover, it is a statement about our American values and what we stand for. It is something that all of those who have worked to make these programs a success take great pride in--whether they are farmers, relief organizations, Members of Congress, or Government officials across numerous administrations. So we should celebrate the success--the success that this program and these programs have had for many years, but we must also continue to build on the lessons that we have learned. Today we have greater capacity to analyze market conditions, and to assess the needs of vulnerable populations so that we can determine what is the most effective mechanism to help those suffering from hunger. Through this capacity, we have learned what types of food assistance are best to meet specific needs: LRP, Local and Regional Procurement, in-kind assistance, or cash and vouchers. We can now match the most effective tool to help meet the specific food and nutritional needs of vulnerable populations. In-kind food aid is needed when food shortages are widespread and local markets cannot address the needs. Cash and vouchers have proven effective in situations, particularly in urban areas, where local markets have adequate food, and vulnerable populations, if they have the resources, would buy it. Local purchase of food, when surplus production is available, has shown to reduce costs, delivery time, and also increase the incomes of small-scale farmers. So, bottom line, we need to use the most appropriate strategy as the circumstances require. In addition to increasing the overall effectiveness of our food assurance programs, the U.S. Government's global food strategy today is more comprehensive than it has ever been; we consider this strategy in terms of four interrelated pillars that address all the multiple faces of hunger: First, the emergency response efforts that save lives in crisis. Second, the nutrition programs that help the most vulnerable. These are especially important for pregnant women and young children in their first 1,000 days when malnutrition could cause irreversible damage, stunting, and other problems that will last throughout their lives. Third, the use of safety net programs. This is an area where I think we need to have more and more focus. Safety net programs, like School Feeding, help people climb out of extreme poverty and chronic hunger, and also bounce back from weather shocks, and societal shocks. The LRP authority that was referenced earlier, and linked to the McGovern-Dole Program, both authorized in the farm bill, is a critical tool. I would love to talk more about how it can build long-term sustainability and local control over these school feeding programs, as part of our exit strategy. The fourth pillar is the whole range of agricultural development efforts to increase productivity and access to markets of small-scale farmers, who actually comprise about half the population of people who suffer from chronic hunger around the world. We have made great progress, and the U.S. has been leading the world in pursuing this more comprehensive strategy to combat global hunger. But, as noted, we have to be cognizant of the current humanitarian crises that are threatening some of the progress that we are making. Right now there are over 60 million people who have been displaced because of conflict. We have not had that number of people displaced since World War II. We have weather shocks that occur more frequently and with greater severity. Although we have significant threats, we know how to grapple with them. But we are going to have to work with the international community to take these efforts to the next level. In conclusion, I want to thank this Committee for your longstanding support. I think all Americans can be proud of the work of this Committee and the longstanding bipartisan commitment to addressing global hunger. I thank you very much for allowing me to be here today. [The prepared statement of Mr. Leach can be found on page 57 in the appendix.] Chairman Roberts. Rick, I owe you an apology. I did not really address your background and what you have done in the past, which I will do right now before recognizing Senator Stabenow to recognize our next witness. Mr. Leach currently serves as president and CEO of the World Food Program, if people did not know that. Over his career he has worked on major social issues at a range of organizations, including the World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Rick also got his start on Capitol Hill on the foreign policy staff of the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Hunger. In 1997, Rick established the World Food Program USA, formerly Friends of the World Food Program, and has since traveled across the world to witness firsthand the effects of chronic hunger. So with that apology, Rick, thank you for your testimony. Senator Stabenow? Senator Stabenow. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to everyone. I want to particularly welcome and introduce Arlene Mitchell today. She is the executive director of the Global Child Nutrition Foundation, 40 years of experience working in international hunger and development programs. She also grew up on a family farm in Michigan, is a graduate of Michigan State University, the Eastern Division Big 10 champs, I will say, with the final game, Mr. Chairman, on Saturday night. I hope you will be rooting for us on Saturday night. Prior to leading the Global Child Nutrition Foundation, she worked for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as deputy director for access and markets in the Agriculture Development Program, where she worked to assist small farmers in Sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia. She also previously worked as executive director for the United Nations World Food Program and in the Foreign Agricultural Service at the United States Department of Agriculture. Before that, she was a volunteer and staff member for the U.S. Peace Corps. So, Mr. Chairman, she is an important voice in this discussion. Thank you. Chairman Roberts. We will turn to questions now of the panel--oh, I am sorry. You are going to give your testimony, Arlene. I apologize. All 38 pages. [Laughter.] STATEMENT OF ARLENE MITCHELL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GLOBAL CHILD NUTRITION FOUNDATION, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON Ms. Mitchell. Thank you. As you noted from my written testimony, I had a lot to say. Thank you, Chairman Roberts and Senator Stabenow and all the distinguished Committee members and fellow panelists. It is a real honor to be here today. Hunger, as we have talked about, particularly chronic hunger, is terrifying and it is debilitating. Hunger limits potential and causes people to behave in extreme ways. Hunger also takes a toll on those of us who are far removed through the cost of humanitarian assistance and health care as well as lost education and productivity and millions of people and subsequent generations. Agriculture can and must play a role in combating hunger. I want to call attention to ten issues for special consideration. Some have already been mentioned today. First, we need to reduce food loss and waste. We are losing about a third of what is produced around the world. Second, we need transportation and storage systems and solutions that leapfrog the current systems. Many of our current systems are expensive, outmoded, unsafe, unusable, and/ or corrupt. We can get around in little vehicles on Mars and the Moon, and we have all-terrain vehicles that can negotiate rivers, sand dunes, ice, and snow, but we cannot get African tomatoes 5 kilometers down the road to market from the farm. We also have spent huge amounts of money on building and maintaining roads, trucks, trains, ships, and planes, but the cost and complications of moving food long distances are still impediments to getting food to those who need it quickly and at a cost they can afford. Food safety problems such as E. coli, salmonella, and aflatoxin need more attention. It is time to effectively involve women. There has been a lot of talk about that today. In addition to comprising half of the world's population, we play important roles in farming and water use, food handling and preparation, family well-being, policymaking, et cetera, but we are not really included in key decisions and activities. Fifth, we urgently need solutions to address age issues. Farmers and agriculture scientists are getting old. At the same time, not enough young talent is entering into agriculture professions. Sixth, market and adoption issues thwart progress, especially in Africa. Why would a farmer invest in seeds, fertilizer, and technology to produce more if there is no way to cover the costs by selling the surplus that they produce? Seventh, we need to better control crop and animal diseases and pests that threaten the world's food supply. Eighth, it is time to insist on linking agriculture and nutrition. The goals and programs are not in sync, and they do need to be. Ninth, protecting biodiversity is critical. We also need to explore the use of plants and animals that are not currently familiar to us in the United States. Tenth, agriculture affects health and health affects agriculture, but the two sectors work in silos. These items are critical to global food security. They are also the reason that I am working in the Global Child Nutrition Foundation. We see large institutional meal programs, nutritious and, if possible, locally purchased, as an avenue to addressing many of these issues. Building on the school infrastructure that exists in some form in every country gives programs a foundation, and using the power of education ensures that these programs will have a positive impact for the involved children, farmers, and families both now and for generations to come. Now I want to mention two other issues that factor into the equation: First, traditional methods of development and humanitarian aid are being challenged by technical, digital, and cultural divides, by global weather patterns, conflict and displacement, political trade and economic pressures, the demands and actions of large emerging players such as China, India, and Brazil. Secondly, economic growth in Africa is positive, and the trends are expected to continue to be positive. These factors are causing shifts in power dynamics and call for new paradigms. Finally, the U.S. Government could tackle some entrenched behaviors and systems that, if alleviated, might speed progress. Five possible actions are: First, providing incentives for interagency cooperation and other good behaviors in Government agencies both here and abroad. Second, encouraging nongovernmental players to cooperate as equal partners and work from their comparative strengths rather than each competing to be in the lead. Third, instituting rewards for programs and organizations that work themselves out of jobs rather than creating and sustaining dependency. Fourth, creating safe ways to honestly discuss failures and challenges. Fifth, continuing the tradition of bipartisan support and jointly sponsored initiatives for combating hunger. That ends my remarks, and thank you for the opportunity to speak today. [The prepared statement of Ms. Mitchell can be found on page 64 in the appendix.] Chairman Roberts. Thank you very much, Ms. Mitchell. I think I am going to go to Mr. Ellis first. You mentioned there have been critics of the involvement of U.S. agriculture in foreign assistance programs. This is sort of motivational question. What motivates you and your company to remain committed to these programs? This is against the backdrop of declining prices worldwide for commodities, all sorts of weather changes. You are facing some difficult decisions, but you still have that commitment to these programs. What motivates you to do that? Mr. Ellis. So I think it is important to say there is an extremely feel-good portion of this to us as an organization. Because we have been in it as long as we have, too, there are several layers through our management that have a tremendous amount of support for what we have done. A lot of that is because they have seen what it does for folks in-country when the service is being provided. I think that is a very large part of it. There are times in the decision making process when you think about the volumes decreasing and some different things changing over the years, I think the amount of research that has been spent and the nutrient level and the consistency of the products now, there is a firm belief that we are delivering something that is making a big difference. I think that is what it is about. Chairman Roberts. Well, you have touched on this. How has Bunge approached the task of creating high-quality products that help combat malnutrition and stunting, particularly for women and children? Both Rick and Arlene have spoken to that. Mr. Ellis. So in my 13 years with Bunge now, I have had some exposure to this program throughout, and I think a lot of the products that would come through the program in the first 5 to 7 years, I would estimate, would have been more basic cornmeals that are enriched. But where we have moved today is to target specific age groups, mothers, lactating mothers, etc. The specificity to the actual product is a tremendous advance for all of us in the industry. One of the things that I find amazing is the commitment we have made to this program. In our milling business, outside of rice, we do not pack anything under what would be a 25 kg bag. Recently with the super cereal, we have installed equipment to be able to pack the 2 to 5 kg type bag for the super cereal product because we feel it will deliver a better product in this program. So the research that goes into that, at the end of the day, it does take staff's time from our business, and we are committed to doing that, and we work with our association partners. NAMA is a strong leader in that category as well, and I think it is a testament to where the program has come to the amoun"
