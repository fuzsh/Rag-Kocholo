        "text": "WASHINGTON â€” It is hard to imagine the U.S. Congress ignoring a constituency as large as the state of Colorado, with its 4.7 million people, but this is the situation faced by overseas Americans - and a new congressional caucus is stepping up efforts to change that.\n\nThe bipartisan Americans Abroad Caucus, which was formed in March, now counts 11 members after being joined this week by two more lawmakers, Representatives Kay Granger, Republican of Texas, and Henry Waxman, Democrat of California.\n\n\"The caucus is a significant step forward toward effective representation for overseas Americans on Capitol Hill,\" said Andrew Coyne, who is on the board of the Association of Americans Resident Overseas.\n\nThat organization and others affiliated with the caucus are seeking changes to legislation and regulations that adversely affect overseas Americans, including tax laws, citizenship procedures for American children born abroad and Medicare guidelines.\n\n\"Our representation is so diluted in Washington because six million of us vote in 50 states and 435 districts,\" Coyne said. \"We are on average 2 percent of every representative's constituency.\"\n\nIn contrast, voters in a state with six million people would have nine representatives in the House and two senators, he said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
