        "text": "WASHINGTON - Republican Sen. John Boozman began his third term representing Arkansas in the U.S. Senate after being sworn in during the chamber’s first meeting of the 118th Congress Tuesday.\n\n“Serving the people of Arkansas has been the honor of my life, and I’m deeply grateful they’ve entrusted me to represent them once again in the U.S. Senate. I will never take it for granted and will work tirelessly on their behalf to advance our Natural State values. I look forward to the opportunity to serve as their voice in Washington for another term and pray for wisdom to fulfill my duty to them and our country,” Boozman stated in a news release.\n\nBoozman is the dean of the Arkansas Congressional delegation and the first Republican senator to represent the Natural State in the U.S. Senate for a third term. His wife, Cathy, three daughters and four grandchildren joined the senator for the historic occasion. Boozman took the oath of office on a New Testament Bible carried by his father during WWII.\n\nIn the 118th Congress, Boozman is expected to continue serving as the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry in addition to serving on the Appropriations, Environment and Public Works, and Veterans’ Affairs Committees.\n\nBoozman, born in Shreveport, Louisiana and raised in Fort Smith, was a Northside High School graduate who played football at the University of Arkansas, 1969-1972. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, 2016 and 2022."
