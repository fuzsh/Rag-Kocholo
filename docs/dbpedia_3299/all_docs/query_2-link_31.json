        "text": "When I was first elected to Congress as a member of the House of Representatives in 2001, former Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt, who represented the Third District of Arkansas for 26 years, gave me some excellent advice.\n\nHe said: “John, always remember, now that the election is over, there are no more Republicans, no more Democrats, only the people of Arkansas and you need to take care of them.”\n\nThat is just as true now as it was then.\n\nNo matter what major legislative crisis we are facing, our goal is to make each constituent who is having trouble with a federal agency a priority. In some cases, we are the last resort to overcoming a major obstacle and we work to give each and every case that comes before us our attention.\n\nI have a great staff that works to help navigate the often-confusing federal agencies. These staffers act as a liaison; working to resolve issues affecting Arkansans such as Social Security or Medicare paperwork glitches, passport problems or difficulties with the VA.\n\nHere are some examples of what we've done to help Arkansans.\n\nIf you’re an Arkansan who is having an issue with a federal agency, I want to help."
