        "text": "LITTLE ROCK — Lyon College marked a historic milestone today with the groundbreaking ceremony for the Lyon College School of Dental Medicine, the first dental school in the state of Arkansas. The event at the school’s Riverdale campus was celebrated with a symbolic sledgehammer strike, marking the official start of renovations for the new dental school.\n\n\"The Lyon College School of Dental Medicine will be a beacon of innovation and excellence, providing comprehensive dental education and services. We will feature an onsite clinic offering high-quality dental care to the community, including specialized services for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with special needs. This clinic will not only serve as a training ground for our students but also as a vital resource for the citizens of Arkansas, ensuring access to essential dental care,” said Dr. Burke Soffe, founding dean of the Lyon College School of Dental Medicine.\n\n\"Our innovative three-year curriculum is designed to accelerate learning while maintaining the highest standards of dental education. Upon receiving approval from the Commission on Dental Accreditation, we eagerly anticipate welcoming our inaugural class of 80 students. These students will be the pioneers of a new era in dental education in Arkansas, benefiting from high-quality facilities and a curriculum that emphasizes both academic rigor and practical experience. Our goal is to cultivate a new generation of dental professionals who are not only skilled clinicians but also compassionate caregivers dedicated to improving oral health outcomes across the state.\"\n\nDr. Melissa Taverner, president of Lyon College, expressed her appreciation for the team behind this historic project.\n\n“This moment represents an incredible achievement for Lyon College and the state of Arkansas. I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our board of trustees, Dr. Soffe, and all of our faculty and staff who are making this school a reality. Their dedication and hard work have turned a vision into reality, setting the stage for a transformative impact on dental education and healthcare in our state. Together, we are making history and paving the way for future generations of dental professionals in Arkansas. I especially want to thank the City of Little Rock, the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce and the many other local organizations for their constant support and efforts to make this possible.”\n\nU.S. Sen. John Boozman praised Lyon College's efforts and the broader impact of the dental school.\n\n“Establishing a school of dental medicine is an investment in the future of Arkansas. This institution will expand access to dental care by training the next generation of dental professionals to serve our communities. I am particularly proud of Lyon College's enthusiasm toward achieving this dream,” Sen. Boozman said.\n\nEarlier this year, Sen. Boozman championed a $15 million federal appropriation to the Lyon College School of Dental Medicine to address the shortage of dental professionals in Arkansas. Including the 50 states and Puerto Rico, Arkansas ranked 50th in the United States – ahead of only Alabama – in the number of dentists per capita with 41.82 per 100,000 residents in 2019, according to the National Institutes of Health’s National Library of Medicine.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders also congratulated Lyon College on this significant achievement.\n\n“This is an amazing moment in the school’s 152-year history, for the city of Little Rock, and for the entire State of Arkansas. Central Arkansas is our state’s healthcare hub. Just in the past few years, expansions like this one have put us on the cutting edge of the medical sciences,” Gov. Sanders said. “Today, we’re taking another leap and opening the first dental school in the Natural State right here in our capital city. This will only add to the network of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals here who help every Arkansan lead a better, healthier life.”\n\nLittle Rock Mayor Frank Scott welcomed Lyon College to Little Rock and central Arkansas.\n\n“With the Lyon College School of Dental Medicine here in Arkansas’s capital city, it further cements Little Rock’s place as the center for health care and innovation for the entire state of Arkansas,” said Mayor Scott. “We are excited to welcome the state’s first-ever dental school to the Riverdale neighborhood and anticipate the positive, transformational outcomes for our community from having the best and brightest future dentists who will call Little Rock home. We appreciate Lyon’s trustees, Dr. Taverner and everyone who has worked to make this school a reality as we improve dental care in our city and region.”\n\nDr. David Hutchison, vice president for advancement at Lyon College, expressed his gratitude to all those who have supported the project.\n\n\"Oral health is essential to a thriving Arkansas, which is why it matters so much that Lyon College is making this critical, enduring investment in the health of our residents and the vitality of our state. We are deeply thankful to everyone who has contributed to this project, from our dedicated board of trustees and board of visitors to our generous donors and community leaders,” Dr. Hutchison said. “This groundbreaking marks a significant step forward in improving the oral health and overall well-being of our state.\"\n\nThe groundbreaking event brought together community leaders, college officials, and supporters to celebrate the start of a new chapter in healthcare education in Arkansas.\n\nBaldwin & Shell Construction Company of Little Rock is construction manager for the project. WDD Architects of North Little Rock is project architect."
