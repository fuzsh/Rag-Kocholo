        "text": "Why it matters: The health care sector represents 18 percent of our economy. More importantly, it impacts the bottom line of every American. The average American spends over $10,000 annually on health care expenses and experts expect that to continue to rise.\n\nWhere I stand: Like most Americans, I believe our health care system needs to provide relief to families from rising costs while ensuring access to quality and affordable care. However, I understand any reforms to our health care system require thorough and thoughtful debate and the end result must preserve and protect the role of patients, providers and physicians as the principal health care decision-makers. Our focus must be on driving down the cost of care, increasing options and ensuring that the needs of patients are put first, while keeping protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAs a former health care provider, I am committed to sharing my experience with colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we work to reform our health care system so it makes sense for all Americans. It is time for us to come together and find commonsense solutions to these and other challenges like the shortage of medical providers and viability of hospitals, especially in rural areas.\n\nWhat I've Done: As a former optometrist, I understand that ensuring our health care system is able to provide quality care that is truly affordable, accessible and efficient for patients and providers is a priority for most Americans. That's why I've championed reforms that lower costs and increase competition while also advocating for expanded and improved access to vital telehealth services.\n\nSenator Boozman's Health Care Accomplishments\n\nTelehealth\n\nTelehealth has been instrumental in allowing patients to continue receiving the care they need during the coronavirus pandemic without having to visit a health professional in person. The public health emergency only amplified the need to expand telehealth opportunities. Boozman has called for the permanent extension of expanded telehealth services that were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\n\nThis law also included a Boozman-supported provision of $250 million for the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) telehealth program to help health providers purchase telemedicine equipment and launch telehealth and remote patient monitoring services.\n\nPhysician Medicare Payments\n\nBoozman secured protections to seniors’ health care access with the prevention of Medicare physician payments cuts. He authored legislation to block the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) planned physician payment cuts scheduled to begin January 1, 2021. He also successfully pushed for inclusion of language to address further planned cuts in 2024.\n\nOpioid Abuse and Addiction Prevention\n\nBoozman has championed legislation to combat the opioid epidemic. He supported the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act signed into law by President Obama in 2016. The law expands prevention efforts, increases access to treatment and promotes recovery. Boozman continued his work to fight prescription drug abuse when he voted for the 21st Century Cures Act which became law in 2016 as well and included a provision that authorizes the opioid grant program, through which he has helped secure millions of dollars for Arkansas. Additionally, Boozman has successfully advocated for investments to assist Arkansas in combating this epidemic through various grant programs and is a strong supporter of treatment courts, an alternative to jail while rehabilitating individuals with drug and substance abuse problems through a strenuous treatment program.\n\nHe has been and remains a strong supporter and backer of Arkansas Take Back Day, an initiative to collect unneeded, old and unused prescription drugs. These events have helped break the cycle of addiction and resulted in the collection of more than 300 tons of pills for safe disposal.\n\nInvesting in the Next Generation of Physicians\n\nBy introducing bipartisan legislation that would gradually lift the caps on Medicare-supported doctor training slots, Boozman is helping Arkansas prepare to meet the future health care needs of residents by addressing the predicted shortage of future primary care and specialty physicians. A provision based on the legislation he championed was included in the legislative package signed into law in December 2020. He continues to build on this momentum by championing legislation to expand training opportunities and incentivize doctors to practice in rural and underserved communities.\n\nMaternal Health\n\nWe are experiencing a maternal health crisis as the U.S. faces the highest maternal mortality rate among developed countries. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth also negatively impact the health of infants. Boozman is taking action to improve the health of Arkansas mothers and babies by leading legislation to reduce premature births. The Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early (PREEMIE) Reauthorization Act of 2023 will continue the critical federal research, education and intervention activities to reduce preterm birth and infant mortality.\n\nMarch of Dimesrecognized Boozman for his maternal and infant health advocacy in 2024 with its March for Change Champion Award.\n\nThe senator is also bringing Arkansans together to improve the outcomes for mothers and babies in The Natural State by hosting roundtable discussions with maternal health leaders and policy experts.\n\nMental Health\n\nAs a member of the Senate Mental Health Caucus, Boozman is leading efforts to support the mental health needs of Americans. He authored legislation signed into law in 2020 that implements new strategies at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for outreach by coordinating with successful veteran-serving organizations aimed at preventing veteran suicide. He is continuing to pursue modernization in how we reach and serve veterans who struggle to get mental health care with the Not Just a Number Act to ensure the VA is looking at a range of factors to help save lives and initiate better data-driven policy decisions.\n\nThe senator is also working to support the mental health needs of college athletes. He authored the Targeting Emotional And Mental Stability (TEAMS) Act to enhance suicide prevention efforts for student-athletes on campus.\n\nBoozman is addtionally leading efforts to expand access to mental health services in rural areas and deliver help to farmers and farm workers who continuously report high levels of stress and mental health challenges.\n\nResearch and Development for Treatment and Cures\n\nBoozman serves as a member of the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s Disease. In Fiscal Year 2021, he helped deliver $3.1 billion for medical research to treat, cure and prevent Alzheimer’s. Boozman was a champion of the Building our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act that was signed into law in 2018 and creates a public health infrastructure to combat Alzheimer’s disease. In 2020, the Improving HOPE (Health, Outcomes, Planning, and Education) for Alzheimer’s Act was signed into law. The bill, cosponsored by Boozman, requires the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct outreach to make more health care providers aware of the resources available to deliver the care patients need. Boozman also serves as a member of the Senate ALS Caucus. Legislation he cosponsored, the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, was signed into law in 2020. This important bill eliminates the five-month waiting period for disability insurance benefits for individuals with ALS.\n\nCommunity Health Centers\n\nBoozman has been a long-time supporter of Community Health Centers (CHC) and led efforts to increase their funding. In Arkansas, there are more than 130 CHC facilities that help nearly 200,000 people get the medical, dental, vision and behavioral health care services they need. These facilities play a critical role in providing access to quality and cost-effective health care. In Fiscal Year 2021, Boozman helped secure $1.68 billion for these health facilities. In 2012, the National Association of Community Health Centers recognized Boozman with its Distinguished Community Champion Award."
