        "text": "Republican Representative (AR-3)\n\nOpposes transporting minors across state lines for abortion\n\nImmediately after the debate the Lincoln campaign provided the following: \"In 2005, Boozman voted against a motion to recommit legislation on parental notification that barred fathers, who committed rape or incest against a minor that resulted in a pregnancy, from being able to sue the doctor who performed an abortion. [HR 748, Vote 143, 4/27/2005]\"\n\nBoozman responded by saying the Lincoln camp took that vote out of context: \"Boozman supported making it a violation to transport a minor girl across state lines to procure an abortion, if done to evade a parental notification,\" the campaign says. \"HR748 explicitly provided exceptions where minors were the subject of sexual abuse or other physical abuse by a parent. A pro-abortion advocate utilized a procedural tactic designed explicitly to kill the bill. Boozman opposed this maneuver that would have killed sound, prolife legislation. Sen. Lincoln1s efforts to paint Rep. Boozman as an advocate for 'rapists rights' are preposterous and shameful.\"\n\nSource: Fox News TV-16 coverage of 2010 Arkansas Senate Debate , Sep 8, 2010\n\nVoted NO on expanding research to more embryonic stem cell lines.\n\nAllows federal funding for research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells, regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from a human embryo, provided such embryos:\n\nhave been donated from in vitro fertilization clinics;\n\nwere created for the purposes of fertility treatment;\n\nwere in excess of the needs of the individuals seeking such treatment and would otherwise be discarded; and\n\nwere donated by such individuals with written informed consent and without any financial or other inducements.\n\nProponents support voting YES because:\n\nSince 2 years ago, the last Stem Cell bill, public support has surged for stem cells. Research is proceeding unfettered and, in some cases, without ethical standards in other countries. And even when these countries have ethical standards, our failures are allowing them to gain the scientific edge over the US. Some suggest that it is Congress' role to tell researchers what kinds of cells to use. I suggest we are not the arbiters of research. Instead, we should foster all of these methods, and we should adequately fund and have ethical oversight over all ethical stem cell research.\n\nOpponents support voting NO because:\n\nA good deal has changed in the world of science. Amniotic fluid stem cells are now available to open a broad new area of research. I think the American people would welcome us having a hearing to understand more about this promising new area of science. As it stands today, we will simply have to debate the bill on the merits of information that is well over 2 years old, and I think that is unfortunate.\n\nThe recent findings of the pluripotent epithelial cells demonstrates how quickly the world has changed. Wouldn't it be nice to have the researcher before our committee and be able to ask those questions so we may make the best possible judgment for the American people?\n\nReference: Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act; Bill HR 3 (\"First 100 hours\") ; vote number 2007-020 on Jan 11, 2007\n\nVoted NO on allowing human embryonic stem cell research.\n\nTo provide for human embryonic stem cell research. A YES vote would:\n\nCall for stem cells to be taken from human embryos that were donated from in vitro fertilization clinics\n\nRequire that before the embryos are donated, that it be established that they were created for fertility treatment and in excess of clinical need and otherwise would be discarded\n\nStipulate that those donating the embryos give written consent and do not receive any compensation for the donation.\n\nReference: Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act; Bill HR 810 ; vote number 2005-204 on May 24, 2005\n\nVoted YES on restricting interstate transport of minors to get abortions.\n\nTo prevent the transportation of minors in circumvention of certain laws relating to abortion, and for other purposes, including:\n\nAllowing for exemptions to the law if the life of the minor is in danger or if a court in the minor's home state waive the parental notification required by that state\n\nAllocating fines and/or up to one year imprisonment of those convicted of transporting a minor over state lines to have an abortion\n\nPenalizing doctors who knowingly perform an abortion procedure without obtaining reasonable proof that the notification provisions of the minor's home state have been satisfied\n\nRequiring abortion providers in states that do not have parental consent laws and who would be performing the procedure on a minor that resides in another state, to give at least a 24 hour notice to the parent or legal guardian\n\nSpecifying that neither the minor nor her guardians may be prosecuted or sued for a violation of this act\n\nReference: Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act; Bill HR 748 ; vote number 2005-144 on Apr 27, 2005\n\nVoted YES on making it a crime to harm a fetus during another crime.\n\nVote to pass a bill that would make it a criminal offense to harm or kill a fetus during the commission of a violent crime. The measure would set criminal penalties, the same as those that would apply if harm or death happened to the pregnant woman, for those who harm a fetus. It is not required that the individual have prior knowledge of the pregnancy or intent to harm the fetus. This bill prohibits the death penalty from being imposed for such an offense. The bill states that its provisions should not be interpreted to apply a woman's actions with respect to her pregnancy. Reference: Unborn Victims of Violence Act; Bill HR 1997 ; vote number 2004-31 on Feb 26, 2004\n\nVoted YES on banning partial-birth abortion except to save motherÂ’s life.\n\nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003: Vote to pass a bill banning a medical procedure, which is commonly known as \"partial-birth\" abortion. The procedure would be allowed only in cases in which a women's life is in danger, not for cases where a women's health is in danger. Those who performed this procedure, would face fines and up to two years in prison, the women to whom this procedure is performed on are not held criminally liable. Reference: Bill sponsored by Santorum, R-PA; Bill S.3 ; vote number 2003-530 on Oct 2, 2003\n\nVoted YES on forbidding human cloning for reproduction & medical research.\n\nVote to pass a bill that would forbid human cloning and punish violators with up to 10 years in prison and fines of at least $1 million. The bill would ban human cloning, and any attempts at human cloning, for both reproductive purposes and medical research. Also forbidden is the importing of cloned embryos or products made from them. Reference: Human Cloning Prohibition Act; Bill HR 534 ; vote number 2003-39 on Feb 27, 2003\n\nVoted YES on funding for health providers who don't provide abortion info.\n\nAbortion Non-Discrimination Act of 2002: Vote to pass a bill that would prohibit the federal, state and local governments that receive federal funding from discriminating against health care providers, health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and any other kind of health care facility, organization or plan, that decline to refer patients for, pay for or provide abortion services. In addition the bill would expand an existing law \"conscience clause\" that protects physician training programs that refuse to provide training for abortion procedures.

NARAL Pro-Choice America's mission is to protect and preserve the right to choose while promoting policies and programs that improve women's health and make abortion less necessary. NARAL Pro-Choice America works to educate Americans and officeholders about reproductive rights and health issues and elect pro-choice candidates at all levels of government. The NARAL ratings are based on the votes the organization considered most important; the numbers reflect the percentage of time the representative voted the organization's preferred position.\n\nSource: NARAL website 03n-NARAL on Dec 31, 2003\n\nRated 100% by the NRLC, indicating a pro-life stance.\n\nBoozman scores 100% by the NRLC on abortion issues\n\nOnTheIssues.org interprets the 2006 NRLC scores as follows:\n\n0% - 15%: pro-choice stance (approx. 174 members)\n\n16%- 84%: mixed record on abortion (approx. 101 members)\n\n85%-100%: pro-life stance (approx. 190 members)\n\nAbout the NRLC (from their website, www.nrlc.org):\n\nThe ultimate goal of the National Right to Life Committee is to restore legal protection to innocent human life. The primary interest of the National Right to Life Committee and its members has been the abortion controversy; however, it is also concerned with related matters of medical ethics which relate to the right to life issues of euthanasia and infanticide. The Committee does not have a position on issues such as contraception, sex education, capital punishment, and national defense. The National Right to Life Committee was founded in 1973 in response to the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision, legalizing the practice of human abortion in all 50 states, throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy.\n\nThe NRLC has been instrumental in achieving a number of legislative reforms at the national level, including a ban on non-therapeutic experimentation of unborn and newborn babies, a federal conscience clause guaranteeing medical personnel the right to refuse to participate in abortion procedures, and various amendments to appropriations bills which prohibit (or limit) the use of federal funds to subsidize or promote abortions in the United States and overseas.\n\nIn addition to maintaining a lobbying presence at the federal level, NRLC serves as a clearinghouse of information for its state affiliates and local chapters, its individual members, the press, and the public.\n\nSource: NRLC website 06n-NRLC on Dec 31, 2006\n\nProhibit transporting minors across state lines for abortion.\n\nBoozman co-sponsored prohibiting taking minors across state lines for abortion\n\nA bill to prohibit taking minors across State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the involvement of parents in abortion decisions.\n\nAmends the federal criminal code to prohibit transporting a minor child across a state line to obtain an abortion (deems such transporting to be a de facto abridgment of the right of a parent under any law in the minor's state of residence that requires parental involvement in the minor's abortion decision).\n\nMakes an exception for an abortion necessary to safe the life of the minor.\n\nMakes it an affirmative defense to a prosecution or civil action under this Act that a defendant reasonably believed that required parental consent or judicial authorization took place.\n\nImposes a fine and/or prison term of up to one year on anyone who has committed an act of incest with a minor and knowingly transports such minor across a state line to obtain an abortion.\n\nSource: Child Custody Protection Act (S.2543&H.R.1063) 08-SR2543 on Jan 22, 2008\n\nSupports prohibiting human embryonic stem cell research.\n\nBoozman supports the CC survey question on banning stem-cell research\n\nThe Christian Coalition voter guide [is] one of the most powerful tools Christians have ever had to impact our society during elections.

The goal? To make abortion illegal, criminalizing patients and providers in the process. One kind of bill making a recent resurgence is the \"Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.\" These bills aim to further the false narrative that abortions regularly occur immediately before or, according to the president, at the time of birth. Intentional action to end the life of an infant is already illegal. This is covered by federal and state infanticide laws. These bills do nothing but vilify physicians who provide reproductive health care.\n\nLegislative outcome Referred to Committee in House; Senate motion to proceed rejected, 56-41-3 (60 required).\n\nSource: Congressional vote 19-S0311 on Feb 5, 2019\n\nGrant the pre-born equal protection under 14th Amendment.\n\nBoozman co-sponsored granting the pre-born equal protection under 14th Amendment\n\nBill would implement equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution for the right to life of each born and preborn human person.
