        "text": "WASHINGTON: The four million or more Americans working and living overseas have just gained perhaps the most conspicuous political platform they have ever had in Washington â€” a congressional Americans Abroad Caucus.\n\nThis bipartisan group of six lawmakers should provide an important megaphone for expatriate Americans who have long struggled to be heard on the issues that matter most to them, from citizenship for spouses and children, to taxation (worsened by legislation last year) and voting.\n\nA caucus can bring together lawmakers concerned with dead-serious issues, like land mines or kidney research, or less urgent matters, such as minor-league baseball or even snowboarding. But with expatriates' coveted goal of electing their own congressional delegates still a distant gleam in the eye, the now very real caucus has drawn a warm embrace.\n\nLucy Laederich, U.S. liaison for the Federation of American Women's Clubs Overseas, or Fawco, called the move \"a major step forward.\" Her group surveyed members two years ago about representation in Washington, \"and the idea of a bipartisan, bicameral caucus came out on top,\" she said.\n\nOther groups, including the Association of Americans Resident Overseas, or AARO, and American Citizens Abroad, or ACA, joined the campaign.\n\nFor now, the caucus is unicameral: all six members are in the House, three from each party, and they come from vastly different backgrounds. Laederich said senators are still being approached.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
