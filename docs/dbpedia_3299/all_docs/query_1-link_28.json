ASHE TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE ---------- TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2011 U.S. Senate, Committee on Environment and Public Works, Washington, DC. The full committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m. in room 406, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Barbara Boxer, (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Senators Boxer, Inhofe, Baucus, Lautenberg, Cardin, Whitehouse, Udall, Merkley, Vitter, Barrasso, Crapo and Boozman. STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Boxer. Today, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will consider the nomination of Dan Ashe to be Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. During his more than 15-year career with the Fish and Wildlife Service, Mr. Ashe has held a wide variety of positions that have given him a deep understanding of the Agency he is being asked to lead. Dan Ashe currently serves as the Deputy Director. Since joining the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1995, he has also served as Science Advisor to the Director, where he advised the Service Director and provided leadership on use of science within the Agency. He has served as Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System, where he was responsible for directing operations and management of the more than 150 million acre refuge system. He served as Assistant Director for External Affairs. Dan Ashe's broad experience with the Fish and Wildlife Service makes him uniquely qualified to deal with the many challenges the Service faces today. Mr. Ashe's knowledge and appreciation of the Fish and Wildlife Service developed well before serving in leadership positions with the Agency. His dad was also a career Fish and Wildlife Service employee. Mr. Ashe spent his childhood visiting many of the national treasures that the Service is charged with protecting. I know family always plays an important role in our achievements. I would like to welcome members of Dan Ashe's family who have joined us here today. His wife, Barbara, raise your hand. His daughter, Mary. Welcome. Unfortunately, son Michael is busy preparing for his college mid-terms and couldn't join us. Mr. Ashe, as you know, the task you have been asked to undertake is very important. The Fish and Wildlife Service is the guardian of natural treasures and species in every single State of the Union. In my own State of California, the Service has responsibility for iconic species, like the bald eagle, and the California condor, and irreplaceable wildlife refuges like the ones in San Francisco Bay and San Diego. I have to say that these irreplaceable environmental gems are the keystone to our tourist industry, and the many, many millions of jobs that rely on a pristine environment in our State. So you support, the Service supports tourism and recreation that boosts local economies in California and across this Country. In 2006, according to a national survey of fishing, hunting and wildlife associated recreation, hunting, fishing and wildlife related activities provided $8 billion to the California economy, and more than $122 billion to the national economy, equaling roughly 1 percent of our Nation's GDP. The Outdoor Industry Association estimates that outdoor recreation contributes $730 billion to the U.S. economy. It is responsible for 1 out of every 20 jobs. Mr. Ashe, you have been nominated to lead an agency that not only maintains safeguards for our Nation's iconic species, but it also plays this key role in supporting a multi-billion dollar wildlife related economy. When I said at the beginning that our Committee is really focused a great deal on economy and jobs, your position really is an example of good stewardship relating directly to these jobs. The health of our environment and the success of our economy go hand in hand. The job isn't easy. There will be controversy and difficult decisions. But I expect that you will follow the law and the best science in your decisionmaking. At the beginning of this Administration, President Obama took important steps to restore scientific integrity and committed to uphold the Endangered Species Act. The President's priorities have been echoed by Secretary Salazar. Today, I look forward to hearing how, if confirmed, you will fulfill these commitments at the Fish and Wildlife Service. Strong leadership is needed to protect and preserve our Nation's treasures and to confront the pressing problems facing our Nation's fish and wildlife. Your record as a committed conservationist and your many years of experience with the Fish and Wildlife Service in my opinion are strong qualifications for this important position. I look forward to hearing from you today and your swift confirmation. I will call on the Ranking Member. STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES M. INHOFE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Welcome to our witness here. I had a chance to visit with Mr. Ashe. This Committee is a huge jurisdiction. One of the things that I believe we are concerned with as much as any other jurisdiction is the Fish and Wildlife. There is not a person up here, Democrat or Republican, that doesn't have people coming with ideas and with complaints. A lot of the programs that we have done were the right programs. As I told you in my office several weeks ago, I think that it is important that a director have a background as you have. You have been the Assistant Director, and the other positions that the Chairman mentioned. I think that is important. I think you understand the role. But there are some recent things that I am very concerned about. I shared my concerns before about the recent decisions made by the Service that in my view put politics before sound science and the welfare of species. Unfortunately, I think you may have inherited a problem here that you are going to have to address, because you are the boss. You are going to be the Director if you are confirmed. On the point of the Endangered Species Act, as a tool to regulate global warming, I am going to ask Mr. Ashe about the Service's recently issued climate change strategic plan which States, among other things, ``The future of fish and wildlife and people hangs in the balance.'' That is kind of scary, which is consistent with everything else that they are doing, with the scary talk. It also calls on the Service to transform its basic mission, stating that it should ``examine everything we do, every decision we make, every dollar we spend though the lens of climate change. Where did that come from? We will give you a chance to answer that, and your participation in that, Mr. Ashe. Because you and I really didn't talk about that before. But I look at the ones that preceded you, they were concerned about sound science, about the wildlife services. I am talking about Dale Hall, the deceased Sam Hamilton, these people have done really a great job. There is no reason that you can't follow in their footsteps and do the same thing, absent these outside influences that are going to try to change the whole function of what Fish and Wildlife is supposed to be doing. Now, some of my colleagues have concerns about your nominations based primarily on your level of involvement in recent controversial listing decisions made by Fish and Wildlife. I know that Senator Barrasso is concerned about that. I am, too. I am also concerned about a process, two things that I really like about the system. One is the Partnership Program. I think, you have to refresh my memory, I know that Dale Hall was out in Oklahoma when we had that. You may have been there in a different capacity, when we actually held a hearing in my State of Oklahoma on the successes of the Partnership Program. That is getting with the land owners, the stakeholders, oil and gas, and these people, and talking about how they can do things to improve the environment, conservation. It is a recognition that, I know out in Western Oklahoma, we have many of our farmers and ranchers out there, they want a clean environment. They have ideas, and we should be listening to them. That is what the Partnership program is all about. Now, you and I have talked about that. This Candidate Conservation Agreement, I believe this is going to be circumvented. It is going to be up to you to make sure you don't allow those forces to force you into something you don't really believe in. So I am concerned about that and we will take this very seriously. I am concerned that you are being put in a very awkward situation right now. We will try to make the best of it, and hopefully we will be successful. Thank you, Madam Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Inhofe follows:] Statement of Hon. James M. Inhofe, U.S. Senator from the State of Oklahoma We are here today to consider the nomination of Dan Ashe for Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In this capacity, he would be responsible for overseeing many programs of great importance within this Committee's jurisdiction, such as the Endangered Species Act and the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. Mr. Ashe has spent the majority of his career with the Service; and, I would note, he also spent much of his childhood on wildlife refuges, helping his father who also worked with the Service. I met with Mr. Ashe in my office last month, and we had a very honest discussion about the direction of the Fish and Wildlife Service. I shared my concerns about recent decisions made by the Service that in my view put politics before sound science and the welfare of species. I asked him to commit to me that he would make decisions based on the best available science, and avoid using the Endangered Species Act as a tool to regulate global warming. On that point, I will ask Mr. Ashe about the Service's recently issued climate change strategic plan, which states, among other things, that the ``future of fish and wildlife and people hangs in the balance.'' It also calls on the Service to transform its basic mission, stating that it should ``examine everything we do, every decision we make, and every dollar we spend through the lens of climate change.'' This is troubling to say the least, and I hope, Mr. Ashe, you can explain what it means. Your interpretation of that document is important. It leads to my next point. I would like your assurance today that, as Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, you will continue in the tradition of former directors, Dale Hall and the recently deceased Sam Hamilton. They were admirable in that they reasonably and objectively considered the best science available. They were able to put politics aside and bring a good measure of balance to their decisionmaking. Now some of my colleagues have concerns about your nomination based primarily on your level of involvement in recent controversial listing decisions made by the Fish and Wildlife Service. I will certainly listen to those concerns, and I will also give you the opportunity to address them. As with any nomination, there is a process, a back-and- forth between the nominee and senators. I will do what I can to facilitate that process. As I'm sure you know, Mr. Ashe, the decision to designate a species and its habitat as threatened or endangered should not be taking lightly. As head of the Service, you would be under constant legal pressure from environmental groups to list as many species as possible, but I ask for your assurance that, if you are confirmed, you will always keep in mind the impacts on local communities, land use, jobs, and our economy that result from these decisions. Despite controversies over listing decisions, I believe the Fish and Wildlife Service does a great deal of good--especially when it uses collaborative approaches between the Federal Government and private land owners, instead of punitive mandates. The Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program is a great example of what collaboration can achieve. This program conserves habitats by leveraging Federal funds through voluntary private landowner participation. As you know, I do have some concerns about how these designated funds have been used. This is a very important position, one that requires decisionmaking on issues that have profound impacts on the wildlife that we all treasure, but also on our local communities and the jobs that support them. I look forward to your testimony, and hope that we can address Senators' concerns about the ESA and some of the decisions you made during your tenure at the Service. Senator Boxer. Thank you. I just want to go over, in order of arrival on our side, Senators Sanders and Gillibrand have left. So this is the order. Cardin, Lautenberg, Merkley, Baucus, Whitehouse, Udall. On the Republican side, Crapo, Barrasso and Vitter. So we will go to Senator Cardin. STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN CARDIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND Senator Cardin. Madam Chair, thank you very much. Let me thank you also on the organization. I look forward to chairing the subcommittee in this Congress for the Water and Wildlife, as I did in the last Congress. I personally want to thank Senator Crapo for all his help. It looks like Senator Crapo is moving on to the Superfund, Toxics and Environmental Health as Ranking. I am sorry we will not have a chance to work directly together, but I look forward to continuing our commitment on water and wildlife. You were a great partner. I also want to acknowledge Tom Strickland, who is in the room, the Assistant Secretary, who will be leaving very, very shortly, as I understand. I just want to thank you for your public service and your help on our agenda in this Committee, and the Subcommittee. You are going to be missed, and the incredible public service that you have provided this Nation. We wish you only the best. Madam Chair, I also would like to point out, there will be another change on the Subcommittee, and that is the Chief Staff for the Water and Wildlife Committee, Sarah Greenberger will also be leaving and moving on to the executive branch. I want to thank her publicly for her incredible work in our Subcommittee. She carried the load, and I think we had a very productive 2 years in large measure due to Sarah Greenberger's work. I wish her only the best. I want to welcome Dan Ashe and his family to our Committee and thank him for his public service and his willingness to continue to serve the public. I want to welcome Barbara. I also want to welcome Mary, his daughter. Sorry Michael could not be here. We know he is studying for mid-terms. I also want to acknowledge Barbara's work as the vice president of the Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce. She is here also with G.G. Goodwin, who is a good friend. We welcome both to our Committee. As you can tell, Madam Chairman, Dan Ashe is a Marylander, and we are very proud of his residence in our State and very proud of his service to our community, his family's service to our community and his service to our Nation. This is a very important position, the position of Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. It is important for our economy, it is important for our natural heritage. Just to mention one of the major areas, national wildlife refuge, it is responsible for $1.7 billion to our local economy, and 27,000 private sector jobs, just that one area that falls under your jurisdiction. I am particularly proud of the work that we have done together in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, which is so important to the Chesapeake Bay, the wetlands that are contained there, to the American Bald Eagle, is a tourist destination, along with the Harriet Tubman Historical Landscape, which brings in around $28 million to the Dorchester County economy alone. That is a relatively small economy. And $28 million is a huge part of the economic impact. So your portfolio is very important to the people of Dorchester County, MD, and our Nation. We need a strategic leader, a person who will look to science to base policy, an effective manager of scarce resources. That person, Madam Chairman, is Dan Ashe, and I am proud that he is willing to put himself forward. He has an undergraduate degree in biology, a graduate degree in marine affairs, 13 years as a committee staffer in the House of Representatives, 15 years in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, including Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System. He currently holds the Deputy Director position. When he was Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System, he helped us in regard to the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and the expansion of that area substantially. As science advisor, he helped us in restoring the Patuxent Wildlife Science Center, which has helped our Maryland economy. Dan has an incredible track record of successful work to help in Maryland and around the Nation. As science advisor, he developed strategic efforts to confront the impact of climate change. I think that is what we want to see. We want to see policy that is based upon good science. I believe that Dan follows, I know he follows in his family tradition, as you pointed out, as his father is a career employee and helped establish the Chesapeake Bay program. So we are very proud of the Ashe family and very proud that Dan is willing to follow. We think he si the right person, a true professional, and will put the public interest first. I am pleased to welcome him to the committee and urge that we swiftly consider and approve his confirmation. [The prepared statement of Senator Cardin follows:] Statement of Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin, U.S. Senator from the State of Maryland Madame Chairman, I want to use my time this morning to introduce President Obama's nominee to be the next Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this Nation's leading wildlife conservation organization. Dan Ashe and his lovely wife, Barbara, who is also with us today, have been Maryland residents and local leaders in Montgomery County since 1983. I know Barbara's tremendous work and leadership in the county as Executive Vice President of the Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce. Her colleague, the Chamber's President, Gigi Godwin, is also in attendance today. Dan and Barbara's two children, Mary and Michael, are graduates of Montgomery County Public Schools. Mary is here today. A graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, we're proud she has brought her Master's Degree in engineering back to Maryland, and is volunteering in our schools to encourage our younger students to study math, science and technology. Michael is busy preparing for his mid-terms, so he couldn't be here today, but we wish him luck! While we are extremely proud of Dan and his family's contributions to Maryland, it is his professional background and proven capacity to lead that make him so qualified for the position to which he is nominated. The Fish and Wildlife Service is charged with conserving, developing, and managing the Nation's fish and wildlife resources. That mission is critically important to this country's natural heritage but also to our economy and way of life. National Wildlife Refuges, for example, provide critical habitat for cherished species and a place to hunt, fish and bird watch; a place to take our children and grandchildren to pass on skills and an appreciation for this country's wild places and wildlife. They also generate nearly $1.7 billion annually for local economies and support 27,000 private sector jobs. The Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1933 as a sanctuary for migrating waterfowl, plays that kind of role in Maryland. Blackwater has been recognized internationally as a ``Wetlands of International Importance'' by the Ramsar Convention and an Internationally Important Bird Area. Blackwater also has the largest breeding population of American bald eagles on the East Coast, north of Florida. The Refuge has become a tourist destination and--along with the Harriet Tubman Historic Landscape--is providing a positive economic impact of approximately $28 million to the economy of Dorchester County. The tourists the refuge attracts to the heart of Chesapeake country create jobs for the county's residents. But our refuges, like Blackwater, are under growing pressure both from lack of resources and from a changing environment. Over time, Blackwater's wetlands have been greatly affected by several factors including climate change. According to a 2008 Society for Wetland Scientists report, Blackwater is losing on average 300 acres per year due to rising water levels, with 5,000 acres of marshland lost since the 1930's (see chart). This is a story that is playing out across the country as the habitat within refuges changes or is lost and species' migratory patterns change. Given these challenges, the Service needs a strategic leader. One that looks to the best science to direct the Services' too limited resources in conserving, protecting and managing our Nation's most cherished resources like those at Blackwater. Dan has proven that he is that kind of leader and has the right kind of experience to get the job done. He has an undergraduate degree in Biology; a graduate degree in marine affairs; 13 years experience as a Committee staffer in the U.S. House of Representatives; 15 years in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, including serving as Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System, Science Advisor to the Director, and currently, Deputy Director. When Dan was Refuge System Chief, I worked with him on several acquisitions for the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and witnessed his tireless approach to conservation of America's public lands. As Science Advisor, I personally saw his vision as he helped shape a critical restoration and revitalization for the Patuxent Wildlife Science Center, an effort that has been crucially important to the advancement of conservation science and to the economy of Maryland. In that position, Dan also lead the Service's effort to develop a strategic plan for confronting the impacts a changing climate is having and will have on our refuge system and trust species. As is clear from Blackwater, the Service cannot fulfill its mandate to conserve, protect and manage refuges and the wildlife that live in and migrate through them, without taking into account the impacts climate change will have on those resources. To turn a blind eye to these dramatic impacts (see chart) would be ineffective and irresponsible. Through his work on that policy and other efforts in his career, Dan Ashe has proven that he has the experience and capability to deal with difficult issues, but to do so while also developing lasting relationships. Dan has the support of a great breadth of environmental, conservation, hunting, and fishing organizations such as the Boone and Crockett Club, Ducks Unlimited, American Sportfishing Association, and Defenders of Wildlife. He has the support of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, illustrating his capacity to build critically important relationships with the States. Dan has a lifetime relationship with the Service. His father, Bill Ashe, was a 37-year career employee who reached the rank of northeast deputy regional director, and led the effort to establish the Service's Chesapeake Bay program. Dan Ashe's demonstrated leadership at the Fish and Wildlife Service and his commitment to science-driven decisions make him the ideal person to serve as Director. It's my pleasure to introduce this citizen of the great State of Maryland and to support Dan's nomination as Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee and in the Senate to swiftly move his nomination forward. Senator Boxer. Thank you, Senator. Senator Crapo. STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE CRAPO, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IDAHO Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Senator Boxer and Mr. Ashe, welcome. I appreciated the opportunity you and I had to visit in my office a couple of weeks ago. As you know from that visit, my highest priority with regard to Fish and Wildlife is resolving the wolf issue in Idaho, as well as in the rest of the Country. Not that there aren't a lot of other issues, but that one is paramount at this point. As you well know, the wolf was introduced to the Northern Rockies in the 1990s. Since that time, it has flourished, to the point where not only has it recovered, but it is continuing, the wolf populations are continuing to grow literally unrestrained. The damage they are doing to our elk herds, our big game herds, as well as our domestic wildlife, our livestock, is increasing. I know that you very well know that this is becoming a huge issue, not just in Idaho, but in a number of other States. Despite the fact that Idaho has done everything it has been asked to do under the law, and is in a position right now to manage the wolf, it has been denied that opportunity, primarily because of the inflexibility of the Endangered Species Act, in my opinion. I probably am going to be called away from this hearing to another hearing before I am going to get a chance to ask you some specific questions about that, so I will ask my questions, I will submit my questions to you if I am not here. But primarily, I want to, as a matter of record, just get your answers to some of the questions we discussed in my office, and to again, use this opportunity to encourage you to make it a priority for you, in your operations, to resolve this issue. We have too many States and too many people who are really hurting right now because of this issue. I am hopeful that we can develop a multi-faceted and effective and prompt solution to the issue. So again, if I don't get a chance to ask you the specific questions, they are not going to be a surprise because we have already talked about them. I am just going to ask to try to get some of your answers on the record and then work with you as we move forward to resolve the issue. Thank you. Senator Boxer. Senator Crapo, we will do everything to expedite the answers, so that we can move along. Senator Crapo. Thank you, and Madam Chairman, I am also aware that you are involved in working with some of us on this issue. We really appreciate your willingness to work with us to help find a solution. Senator Boxer. Thank you. Since you have thanked me, I want to thank Senator Baucus, Senator Cardin and others who also are trying very hard, and Senator Tester, to work this out. On your side, Senator Risch and others. Senator Crapo. Thank you very much. Senator Boxer. OK. We will turn to Senator Lautenberg. STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Senator Lautenberg. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and congratulations for getting us organized so quickly. That is rare around here. We are happy that it was done. I begin by congratulating our witness on his nomination to serve as the next Director of the National Fish and Wildlife Service. Dan Ashe is a strong candidate to lead this critical Agency, having inherited the zest and the zeal that he has from his father and his good work. He has held multiple positions with Fish and Wildlife during the past 15 years. Mr. Ashe is going to need to call upon this experience to confront major challenges, like the white nose syndrome that affects the bats. It is a fungus, and could wipe out much of our country's bat population. During the past two winters, more than 1 million hibernating bats have died, including hundreds at New Jersey's Hibernia Mine. I visited that mine shaft a long time ago, and there was a robust population of bats there. I was very comfortable with them. A recent visitor told us that the floor of the mine was covered with dead bats, thousands of them. It is a serious problem, it is a major threat to an entire ecosystem, with the potential to cause serious environmental and economic problems. Bats are one of nature's exterminators, and help to protect the public health and our crops. They prey mostly, almost exclusively on insects such as mosquitos, which spread disease, and moths and beetles which damage crops. A single bat can eat half its body weight in insects in a single night, and an entire colony will consume hundreds of millions of these insects. In the previous Congress, I hosted several briefings on this issue, requested and received a hearing in Senator Cardin's subcommittee, and secured more than a million dollars to research the white nose syndrome. But we have to do more, which is why today I am introducing the Wildlife Diseases Emergency Act. This bill will help Fish and Wildlife Service strengthen its response to outbreaks like the white nose syndrome, by improving its coordination with our Agencies and State governments. My legislation would also help provide more resources to address wildlife disease emergencies. I thank Senators Sanders and Leahy from Vermont for joining me in introducing this legislation. Disease is just one of the threats putting pressure on our wildlife. We recently learned that 2010 tied 2005 for the hottest year in recorded history. The record heat, along with droughts and floods, are wreaking havoc around the world. Global warming is a plague that is driving hundreds of thousands of species from their homes and to the brink of extinction. The fact is unarguable, the planet is changing. We can argue about it from our climate-controlled offices. But scientists know the truth, and they are trying to tell us. NASA scientists tell us, to survive, both marine and land- based plants and animals have started to migrate toward the poles. These species, and in some cases entire ecosystems that cannot quickly migrate or adapt face extinction. With fewer healthy ecosystems for species to call home, it has never been more important for us to preserve and maintain areas like our national wild refuges. But more often than not, these refuges are overburdened and understaffed. Millions of refuge acres are overrun with invasive species like pythons, non-native rats and Asian carp. To make matters worse, more than 10,000 facilities are in disrepair, and shortages of law enforcement officers has led to problems with poaching, illegal border activity and drug trafficking. In New Jersey, Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge provides a shelter for wildlife and respite for our city dwellers, just 26 miles west of Times Square in New York. But that refuge is being squeezed by growing development, fragmentation. We are destroying the habitats of several threatened and endangered species. Across the Country, one- third of the refuges have no full-time staff. The men and women of the Fish and Wildlife Service are devoted to their work. Too often, they are called on at work to do more with less. If some of our colleagues have their way, it will soon get worse. House Republicans want to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from the Fish and Wildlife budget. We shouldn't be weakening our country's environmental defenses. I look forward to hearing Mr. Ashe's ideas on how we can address these issues and protect the habitats and wildlife that cannot protect themselves. May I take a moment more, Madam Chairman, to say thanks to Tom Strickland, whom I have known for a long time. He has been the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Refuges, and we are sorry to see him go. He got the first conviction under the Lautenberg law under the spousal abusers prohibition for guns. I thank you very much. Senator Boxer. Thank you, Senator. Now, Senator Barrasso. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING Senator Barrasso. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. Welcome, Mr. Ashe. Congratulations. It was good to visit with you last week. Welcome to your family, thanks so much for being here, congratulations. I appreciate your taking the time to visit last week. We discussed a number of issues at the time. Obviously, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a huge impact in my home State of Wyoming and the rest of the Rocky Mountain west. One issue that is of great concern to me is the use that you have heard in previous statements from my side of the aisle with use of the Fish and Wildlife Service as a climate change agency. We talked about that. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's strategic plan for responding to accelerating climate change lays out a new mission for the Agency and the authority to carry out that mission. The plan states, ``As a service, we are committed to examining everything we do, ever decision we make, every dollar we spend, through the lens of climate change.'' The plan further states, ``Given the magnitude of the threat posed by climate change to life as we know it, we cannot afford to think small or be held back by our fears or concerns.'' The plan also goes on to say, ``We must act now, as if the future of fish and wildlife and people hangs in the balance, for indeed, all indications are that it does.'' If the American people back home are confused by how this is possible, that the Fish and Wildlife Service is suddenly declaring itself a climate change agency, all they need to do is go to one of the passages buried in the 32 pages that says ``Climate change is not a new mission. It is the lens through which we must accomplish the mission we already have.'' To me, this type of reinterpretation of the law isn't music to the taxpayers' ears. It is an example of the type of unconstitutional policymaking at the agencies that has everyone on both sides of the Hill clamoring for regulatory reform. That is why I have introduced legislation, S. 228, the Defending America's Affordable Energy and Jobs Act, which restores Congress' role in determining America's energy and environmental future. It does this by putting a halt to these back door cap-and-trade regulations and policies. It is important to me that any nominee to be Director of Fish and Wildlife Service be cognizant of the threats facing species and address them with a balanced approach. Taxpayer money must be focused where it can do the most good. The iconic species in the west that are truly in danger must be managed responsibly in partnership with the States. When recovery goals are met, the Service should honor its obligation and not move the goal posts. There is a lot of criticism in the west toward the Fish and Wildlife Service. In the 1990s, under President Clinton, that relationship began to sour. The mistrust of the Agency by the people in my State has continued ever since. Under President Clinton, then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt re-introduced gray wolves into the western Wyoming landscape, in Idaho and Montana. This decision was made without regard to many of the people who live there. We raise our families there, build our businesses there, and the Federal Government has treated us like some kind of a petri dish for an environmental experiment. Despite this, Wyoming has met its recovery goals for the wolf. On August 16th of last year, Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Tom Strickland, who is with us today, said ``The recovery of the wolf has been a stunning conservation success.'' Yet, the Fish and Wildlife Services refuses to de-list the wolf in Wyoming. If we maintain the wolves, we should be allowed to manage them how we see fit. As I have stated in the past, the Clinton administration created this problem. The Bush administration failed to solve it. Now the Obama administration needs to deal with it. It is time for a change of course; it is time to restore the trust between the people of my State and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. So I hope we can count on you and this Administration to work with Wyoming to see the wolves de-listed. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Senator Boxer. Thank you. Senator Merkley. STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF MERKLEY, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OREGON Senator Merkley. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Ashe, thank you for coming before the Committee. The Fish and Wildlife Service is an agency that has a major role in Oregon. We have 17 national wildlife refuges covering more than half a million acres. The Klamath Basin and its wildlife refuge is home to one of the most important bird habitats in North America. There are a couple of issues that I do have concerns about. One is the spotted owl recovery plan, which is being described very differently by the Fish and Wildlife Service and by the BLM in terms of its impact on forest management. Second of all, a series of proposals related to wind energy that seem at odds with the consultative process that went on for over 2 years. I will ask you about those when the question period comes, if I am still here. If not, I will followup in the record and followup with you. Thank you very much for coming today. Senator Boxer. Thank you, Senator. Senator Vitter. STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Senator Vitter. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Mr. Ashe, very much, for your service and for being here. Madam Chair, again, thanks for this very important hearing. It is important that Federal agencies be headed by competent and capable people. It is equally important that these folks understand that the decisions they make can have dramatic impacts, including dramatic economic impacts on the livelihoods of our fellow citizens. With that in mind, I want to highlight in my opening statement the ongoing deep frustration Louisianans are having with the Department of Interior over the ongoing de facto drilling moratorium in the Gulf. That is directly relevant, because it is Interior, and because all signs point to Fish and Wildlife and other environmental related agencies becoming much more involved in that permitting process. This de facto moratorium is devastating lives, costing jobs, devastating companies. Since the Deepwater Horizon explosion, and that is 8 months ago now, there have been zero new deepwater exploration permits issued. Zero. Since that incident, horrific incident, again, 8 months ago, the 32 deepwater operations that were operating are still either completely shut down or there has been a marginal improvement, at best. That translates into jobs and people's lives being directly hurt. For 8 months straight before this month, Louisiana unemployment went up. As national unemployment was, thank goodness, stabilizing, Louisiana unemployment went up month after month for 8 months straight. That is directly related to this. Just last week, the second-largest shallow water driller in the Gulf, Seahawk Drilling, filed bankruptcy, because shallow water is still also impacted. Those permits have slowed, although it is not as bad as deepwater. Bottom line here, Louisianans want to get back to work. Filling those jobs is my absolute top priority. That has to come first. Second, there is even an impact on things we are debating right now in terms of debt and deficit and the budget. After the U.S. income tax, the second largest source of Federal revenue is royalty and other revenue related to that domestic energy production. So we are shutting that down and dramatically reducing that as well, even in a time when we are all rightly concerned about deficit and debt. One thing related to this, Century Exploration recently filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government, against the Interior Department, I think this is just the beginning, for breach of contract, asking for their money back, asking for lost profits, because they bought leases which are now pretty much good for nothing. My frustration is only increased by non-responses from the Interior Department. That includes, for instance, a November 21st letter from last year, which still has not been responded to. A February 3d letter from this year which still has not been responded to in terms of this issue. Those were not addressed to you, of course, Mr. Ashe. They were addressed to some of your significant colleagues in Interior. This is consistent, unfortunately, with the fact that the Department was handed a civil contempt order recently by the Federal judge handling these matters in terms of how the Department has handled the whole de facto moratorium and moratorium issue. I can't overstate how devastating this has been to so many Louisianans and how frustrated Louisianans are with this pattern of actions by the Interior Department. That is my top concern, filling those Louisianans' jobs is my top priority. That has to come first. Thank you. Senator Boxer. Thank you, Senator. Senator Baucus. STATEMENT OF HON. MAX BAUCUS, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MONTANA Senator Baucus. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Ashe. Also Mr. Strickland, thank you for your service to our country. Welcome, Mr. Ashe, to the Committee. The Fish and Wildlife Service has a unique responsibility to watch over our Nation's wildlife. Your decisions about their likely future and whether intervention is needed impacts millions of people around the country. This is a significant charge, and it is imperative that your decisions reflect both the current and best science, as well as the reality of conditions on the ground. As you know, we have a problem in our State, and that is wolves. The recent court decision which overturned the Fish and Wildlife Service's 2009 rule has created an untenable situation on the ground. Montana's consensus-based approach to wolf management, as is the case in other wildlife management, has demonstrated proven results, with a successful wolf hunt that works for hunters, ranchers and for wolves. But instead of being rewarded, Montana's success has been halted by the return of the wolf to the Endangered Species List. Management has shifted from Montana back to Washington. Senator Barrasso is correct; there is a deep feeling in the west that Washington just doesn't get it. It is removed, a little paternalistic, as the Senator mentioned, a petri dish, some of those words all come to mind. Ranchers aren't clear on what the rules are. Hunters are worried that elk populations may dwindle if wolf populations are left unchecked, as is currently the case. Just last week, the Fish and Wildlife Service said it would be six more weeks before it could act on a Montana proposal to conduct a wolf hunt this year to control populations. We have been talking about this for a long time, since August. We are well past the time when it should be fixed. I have introduced legislation which would remove the wolf from the Endangered Species list and return it to State management. The goal is to turn back the clock to exactly where we were before the court decision, and the text of my bill does just that. Members of this Committee know how hard we need to work to resolve this. I think there is cooperation on this Committee to resolve this wolf matter. As incoming Director, you would be charged with working with us to find that solution. This spirit of cooperation is what built the west. Listen to the words of Wallace Stegner: ``It is true that the west's history is punctuated with the lives of rugged individualists. But they built such things as railroad empires, land empires and the Anaconda Copper Company. Who built the west as a living place, a frugal, hard, gloriously satisfying civilization, scrabbling for its existence against the forces of weather, and a land as fragile as it is demanding, was not rugged individualists, but cooperators, neighbors, who knew how to help out in crisis, who could get together and build a school and figure out a way to get the kids there. Pool their efforts to search fort lost cattle, or lost people, and joined in frequent blowouts, dances and fairs.'' Mr. Ashe, I know that is the spirit with which you will approach this job. We need that cooperation and working together to get this done. I wish you good luck. [The prepared statement of Senator Baucus follows:] Statement of Hon. Max Baucus, U.S. Senator from the State of Montana I want to welcome you, Mr. Ashe, to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The Fish and Wildlife Service has a unique responsibility to watch over our Nation's wildlife. Your decisions about their likely future and whether intervention is needed impact millions of people around the country. This is a significant charge, and it is imperative that your decisions reflect both the current and best science as well as the reality of conditions on the ground. Mr. Ashe, we have a problem, and that problem is wolves. The recent court decision which overturned the Fish and Wildlife Service's 2009 rule has created an untenable situation on the ground. Montana's consensus_based approach to wolf management is being rewarded by the return of the wolf to the endangered species list. Management has shifted to Washington. Montanans don't need D.C. bureaucrats telling us how to manage wolves in our State. Ranchers aren't clear on what the rules are and hunters are worried that elk populations may dwindle if wolf populations are left unchecked. Just last week, the Fish and Wildlife Service said it would be 6 more weeks before it acts on a Montana proposal to conduct a wolf hunt this year to control populations.

My goal is to turn back the clock to exactly where we were before the court decision, and the text of my bill does just that. The members of this Committee know what needs to be done, and I look forward to working with each of you, westerners and easterners, republicans and democrats, to enact legislation in the coming weeks. We need to resolve this, and we need to do it now. As incoming Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, you, Mr, Ashe, will be charged with working with us to find a solution. I hope that you will take that charge seriously. This spirit of cooperation is what built the West. Wallace Stegner wrote, ``It is true that the West's history is punctuated with the lives of rugged individualists . . . but they built such things as railroad empires, land empires, and the Anaconda Copper Company. Who built the West as a living-place, a frugal, hard, gloriously satisfying civilization scrabbling for its existence against the forces of weather and a land as fragile as it is demanding, was not rugged individuals but cooperators, neighbors who knew how to help out in crises, who could get together to build a school and figure out a way to get the kids there, pool their efforts to search for lost cattle or lost people, and join in infrequent . . . dances, and fairs.'' I hope that we can work together, in this same spirit, to resolve the wolf issue now. Senator Boxer. Thank you, Senator. Senator Boozman. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Ashe, we want to thank you for your dedication to the Fish and Wildlife Service, and thank you for appearing here today. Congratulations on your nomination. That is an honor in itself. As you know, the Service operates 10 refuges in Arkansas. These are an important part of our State. The agency's activities have a major impact on Arkansas' economy and the economy of our country. You have an important mission, conserving, protecting and enhancing fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. I want to help you meet these important responsibilities, while minimizing adverse impacts to job creation, the economy of Arkansas and our way of life. It is interesting, we all, whether it is wolves, or oil or whatever, most of us here are most familiar with the areas that go on in our State. That is the interaction that we have had with the Agencies in the past. I guess what I would like to be reassured of is that as we deal with areas, that we deal with it with common sense. Are we using sound science, are we getting the emotion out of the play, and are we helping producers and entities as we make changes that in many cases threaten the very existence. In some cases, we have had, I think that has made a good story with the Agency. In other cases, it hasn't been as good a story. Recently, the Obama administration added big head carp to the Injurious Species under the Lacy Act. In the past, silver carp and black carp have been added to the list through the rulemaking process. But their farmers were allowed to sell their inventory. Now we are in a situation in Arkansas where the only way to get rid of the stock that they have is to drain the ponds and in doing so, because of the process that is involved, probably many, many will escape, again, causing unintended consequences. I was the ranking member on Water Resources on the House, and have sat through many hours of testimony and understand the danger and the economic impact that that has on areas like the Great Lakes and things like that. But I guess what I would like to know, as we talk further, again, we have to have a willing commitment, not only in that area, but in all of these areas that you are hearing about, to work with a particular industry, to make sure that we have an environmentally safe way to solve the problem. With that, I yield back. Senator Boxer. Thank you very much. Now, we go to Senator Whitehouse. STATEMENT OF HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Madam Chair. Welcome to the Committee, Mr. Ashe. Thank you, Mr. Strickland, for your service. I want to thank the Chair for renewing my appointment as the Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee and for adding to our jurisdiction the science and research issues. I look forward to working with my Ranking Member, Senator Johanns, and with Senator Boozman on the issues that will be before us. I want to thank Senator Barrasso for his service as the ranking member of that subcommittee in the past Congress. He is a pleasure to work with, and I enjoyed it very much. I am also very grateful to be serving on Chairman Baucus' Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Chairman Cardin's Subcommittee on Water and Wildlife, and my friend, Chairman Udall's Subcommittee on Children's Health and Environmental Responsibility. I think those are all important tasks for this Committee. The only thing that I would ask of Mr. Ashe is that in my view of the Constitution, it is perfectly legitimate for the executive branch of Government to make its own determination of what the situations are that confront this country and react within the laws that Congress has established. The amount of carbon pollution that mankind has released into the atmosphere is not a theory, it is a fact. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is not a theory, it is a fact. The effects of that have been known since the Irish scientist Tyndall figured it out in the 19th century. It is textbook science, it is not a theory in that sense. It is fully established and virtually unchallenged. So the fact that we are changing our planet in significant ways, as measured by things like our water, our oceans' acidity being for the first time veered outside of a range within which they have been for 8,000 centuries is a risky proposition for us, and something that I think the executive branch does well to attend to, and meets its responsibilities to the American people when it does attend to it. I would urge you to not mimic the ostrich that puts its head in the sand and look to the facts around you and discharge your duties accordingly. But I think that the theory that the executive branch can't act or decide or respond to reality until Congress has directed it to is a mistake, so long as the executive branch is acting within the laws that Congress has prescribed. I would urge you to use your good judgment. There are times when Congress represents the will of the American people, there are times when Congress represents the will of very powerful vested interests. I think the executive branch is capable of sorting through that, and I look forward to working with you. Senator Boxer. Thank you very much, Senator. Last but not least, Senator Udall. STATEMENT OF HON. TOM UDALL, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO Senator Udall. Thank you, Madam Chair. I also very much appreciate my appointment as Chair of the Subcommittee on Children's Health and Environmental Responsibility, and I look forward to working with you on an aggressive agenda there. I look forward to serving with Lamar Alexander as the Ranking Member on that Subcommittee. I know that that is an area where we have very important issues to tackle. I would like to welcome Dan Ashe to the proceedings today, and thank him for his years of hard work given in serving our Nation in the Fish and Wildlife Service. I think also before that, you served in the House of Representatives as a staff member. So you have experience in a legislative situation and you also have, I think, significant experience at the Fish and Wildlife Service. I think you are just the kind of career person that we need at the Fish and Wildlife Service. As you know, the Agency that you have worked in has serious duties and very difficult responsibilities. The Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for ensuring that all species are able to survive as we try to co-exist. With the progression of climate change, and as my colleague, Senator Whitehouse, mentioned, we have some real disagreements on this committee. But the science is pretty clear. The work of the Fish and Wildlife Service will become more and more difficult. In that respect, whether we agree or disagree on the impacts of global warming, adaptation should be something we can all unite around. The Fish and Wildlife Service has embarked on a program, I believe, a cooperative program which deals with adaptation called the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, which you are trying to work with and form around the country. I look forward to hearing, in your testimony, how that program is going, how it is progressing. Your Agency is also essential, it is essential that you use science-based policies to accomplish the goal of maintaining healthy wildlife populations and the ecosystems that support them. Maintaining healthy ecosystems will help ensure that our water, air and food is also clean and healthy. By protecting the environment we also protect man. So with that, I look forward, I will shorten my opening statement here and look forward to the questions and your testimony. I also want to thank my good friend, Tom Strickland, for your hard work in the Agency. You have overseen this particular agency, Fish and Wildlife. You have also overseen Parks. At the same time, as I think I said at your nomination, I couldn't believe you were also going to do the Chief of Staff job. I think you have done a remarkable job in that respect. I am sure that Secretary Salazar is really going to miss you, and certainly the country is, too. So thank you for your service. Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator Boxer. Thank you very much. Would you like us to put your entire statement into the record? We will do that, without objection. Actually, it is your moment now, Mr. Ashe. I am sure you thought at one point you would have to send in for lunch. But we are at that point. So welcome, and go right ahead. If you want to go off text and address some of the issues that were raised, we will give you a couple of extra minutes. It is up to you, or you can wait for the questions. Go right ahead. STATEMENT OF DANIEL M. ASHE, NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA TO BE DIRECTOR, U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE Mr. Ashe. Thank you, Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe, and Committee members. I do want to thank Senator Cardin for his very kind introduction and everyone here for the warm welcomes I have received as I have come to your offices and met with you before today's hearing. I would like to acknowledge a few people that are here today. Certainly my wife, Barbara, who has already been introduced, but who has stuck with me for 32 years, despite pretty serious addictions to work and waterfowl hunting. Our daughter, Mary, who has also been introduced. Dr. Tom Kitsos and his wife, Mary. Tom was my boss for 13 years on Capitol Hill and my long-term mentor. Tom, Mary, thank you very much for being here today. I would like to add my congratulations and thanks to Assistant Secretary Tom Strickland. Tom has been a great ally in fish and wildlife conservation. When he departs the Interior Department tomorrow, he will be sorely missed in the days ahead. Just 19 months ago, our late Director, Sam Hamilton, was sitting where I am today, being considered for what he called the best job in the country. To me, Sam was leader, colleague, a boss and a friend. So today, I am standing on Sam's shoulders, but also on the shoulders of many dedicated Fish and Wildlife Service employees, present and past, including my own father. Because of his 37-year career, I have known the Service my entire life. Following him to wildlife refuges and hatcheries, I learned to band birds, to fish, to hunt, to hike, and just to wander about and to love the outdoors. The first 13 years of my career, as has been mentioned, I was a professional staff member for the former Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries in the U.S. House of Representatives, a committee with a great tradition of bipartisan accomplishment. A committee that not only nurtured great conservation laws, but great conservation leaders and legislators with names like Dingle, Breaux, Forsyth, Boxer and Inhofe. In 1995, then-Director Molly Beatty asked me to join the Service's leadership team. My Capitol Hill experience has been invaluable in the four leadership posts that I have held since then. I believe during that time I have earned a reputation for collaboration, integrity, vision and accomplishment. My leadership direction will be straightforward. The Service must have a strong scientific foundation and a culture of interdependence with partners. The Service is proudly successful, but it is one part of a larger conservation community that includes local, State and tribal governments, non-government organizations, the business sector and America's private land owners. The Service's success depends upon their success. Receiving the Senate's confirmation as Director would be a distinct honor, certainly because of the opportunity to be of service to the Nation, also to serve the people who are the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, people who are passionate about conserving wild places and wild things, and people who represent the very best in public service. I have seen it in employees working hand in hand with the State of California to restore San Francisco Bay wetlands. I have seen it in employees working alongside private landowners and public school teachers in Oklahoma. I have seen it in employees struggling against white nose syndrome in bats throughout the east and now into the western United States. I have seen it at its very best when employees literally dropped everything and deployed to the Gulf of Mexico in its times of need after Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. If confirmed, I hope to nurture their indomitable spirit, remove obstacles to their success, provide them a sense of direction and optimism, and set a tone for integrity and excellence. I am extraordinarily honored that President Obama and Secretary Salazar asked me to serve as Director. It seems just yesterday I was following my dad to wonderful places like Blackbeard Island, Okefenokee, Chattahoochee Forest, Sanibel Island and Big Pine Key. Now I am being considered to lead the outfit entrusted with these great places and so many more, the world's finest organization of fish and wildlife conservation professionals. It is humbling, and it is a powerful incentive to uphold the tradition of excellence that the Office of Director demands. With the consent of this committee and the U.S. Senate, I will give the job my very best. Thank you, Madam Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Ashe follows:] Statement of Daniel M. Ashe, Nominee for Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service introduction Thank you, Madam Chairman, Senator Inhofe, and Members of the committee. I am honored to be with you today as President Barack Obama's nominee to serve the American people as Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. With your indulgence, I would like to begin with a short, personal introduction to provide some context for how I came to be here today. personal background I have been a part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) family for my entire life, so my nomination to serve as Director of this great Agency represents both the opportunity of a lifetime and an honor. I was born, and spent my childhood, in Atlanta, Georgia, where my father began what was to be a 37-year career with the Service. His is a far more interesting story than mine. Born into the industrial poverty of Connecticut's Naugatuck River Valley and educated with the aid of the GI bill, he and my mother moved to Atlanta so he could take a job with the Service. There, he advanced through a series of positions in what was then the Branch of Lands, later the Division of Realty, and ultimately rose to be Deputy Regional Director in the Service's Northeast Region. Some of my earliest and fondest childhood memories are accompanying my father to national wildlife refuges and fish hatcheries in the Southeast--such as Okefenokee, Blackbeard Island, and Chattahoochee Forest--where I learned to band birds, fish, hunt, hike, and most importantly, to simply enjoy the outdoors. I saw Service employees in action, doing their jobs with commitment and camaraderie, something I recognized but could not put into words as a kid. I met people who would become Service legends, like Jack Watson, the colorful manager of National Key Deer National Wildlife Refuge, and former Directors John Gottschalk and Lynn Greenwalt, whose leadership and vision made distinctive contributions to the Service. My mother grew up during the great depression, in the poor working neighborhoods of Bridgeport, Connecticut. She raised five boys, and, maybe because we had nothing else to do, was always encouraging us to ``go outside.'' In spring and summer, she allowed our screened porch to become a veritable zoological park of lizards, snakes, turtles, orphaned birds and even the occasional baby possum or raccoon. The milkman once stopped delivering to our house because the milk box was just a perfect reptile receptacle. She demanded excellence in school, and she modeled tolerance for differences among people, but intolerance for the racial injustices of that time. More than anyone, she taught me that I could accomplish anything--whether repairing a faucet or bicycle, competing in sports, attending college, or leading a complex organization--as long as I was willing to dedicate myself fully to the task at hand and learn from my mistakes. My parents did not actively encourage me to go into the conservation profession; they did not have to. They simply opened the door to the endless fascination of wild things and wild places and to the passion of those working to conserve our outdoor heritage. These early experiences gave me a deeply rooted appreciation for the work that the Service and its partner organizations do and a desire to play a part in it. I followed that passion to Texas A&M University and then Florida State University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biological sciences. Later, I earned a graduate degree in marine affairs from the University of Washington. My master's thesis, on estuarine wetland mitigation, was published in the Coastal Zone Management Journal in 1982. I am joined today by my wife Barbara, whom I spirited away from the State of Florida in 1979. She married a marine biologist and is fond of saying she has been moving further from the coast ever since. Barbara is the Executive Vice President for the Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce, so we have a marriage that represents the interconnectedness of environment and economy, and one that is always filled with lively discussion. We have two children, Mary and Michael. Both are pursuing their own course in education and life, and I am proud that they each have a burning love of the outdoors and an appreciation of what is required to conserve it. My journey to the Nation's capital began when I was awarded a National Sea Grant congressional Fellowship in 1982. For the next 13 years, I served as a member of the professional staff of the former Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, in the U.S. House of Representatives. During my time on Capitol Hill, I advised the Committee's Chairmen and Members on a wide range of environmental policy issues, including endangered species and biodiversity conservation, ocean and coastal resources protection, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National Marine Sanctuaries Program, the Clean Water Act, wetlands conservation, fisheries management and conservation, and offshore oil and gas development--all issues of direct concern to the Agency I am nominated to lead. My experience on the Hill gave me invaluable insight into congressional operations and the work ethic of Members and staff, as well as an understanding and respect for the craft of policymaking that has served me well in my own work with the Service. track record and experience When I was hired as the Service's Assistant Director for External Affairs in 1995, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to follow in my father's footsteps and make my own contribution to an agency we both love. In that position, I directed the Service's programs in legislative, public, and Native American affairs, research coordination, and State grants-in-aid. From 1998 to 2003, I served as the Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System, directing operation and management of the then 93 million-acre Refuge System and the Service's land acquisition program. During those 5 years, the Refuge System developed a promising vision, expanded its commitment to partnership, volunteerism, and ``friends'' organizations, and set the stage for sustained success. As a result, the System received vastly expanded public visibility, partner and community involvement, and strong support within the Administration and Congress. Today, the Refuge System stands at more than 150 million acres, 553 units, and 38 wetland management districts. I believe it is the world's finest collection of public lands and waters dedicated to fish and wildlife conservation. Throughout much of its history, the Service has set the standard for science-based wildlife management, and, in my view, the best science must inform and underpin everything we do as an agency. I am proud to have contributed to a renaissance of science and professionalism within the Service during the 6 years I served as Science Advisor to the Director before becoming Deputy Director in 2009. In this capacity, I had broad responsibility to provide leadership on science policy and scientific applications to resource management. During my tenure, the Service began developing and implementing an agenda for change toward a science-driven, landscape conservation business model designed to respond to broad threats such as habitat loss and fragmentation, illegal trade in wildlife, invasive species, growing water scarcity, wildlife disease, and global climate change. I also led efforts to reemphasize the importance of scientific research and professionalism and worked to build stronger relationships with the U.S. Geological Survey and scientific professional societies. As a member of the Service's Directorate, I have worked hard to ensure that this commitment to scientific integrity is maintained and our responsibility to the American public is fulfilled by implementing state-of-the art approaches to strategically address the nation's most pressing conservation needs. I have also provided leadership in implementing strategic landscape conservation as our operational paradigm to ensure that we target science in the right places through thoughtful planning, monitoring of outcomes, and adaptive management. The Service makes decisions every day that are important to the American people. The actions we take to ensure the sustainability of our nation's fish and wildlife resources affect both public and private lands and impact the quality of life, the economic well-being, and the recreational and aesthetic enjoyment of our citizens. Our decisions and actions have both immediate and long-term implications: as public servants entrusted by the American people with stewardship responsibilities for America's wildlife resources, we act on behalf of both present and future generations. Public service, social responsibility, respect for all stakeholders, and scientific integrity, are core values that serve as foundations of the professionalism upon which those that came before me built this Agency. My highest aspiration as Director, if confirmed, is to strengthen those foundational core values so that this commitment to the American public can be realized and the trust placed in the Agency to provide leadership in stewardship of our nation's wildlife resources can be fulfilled. philosophy, priorities and vision My conservation philosophy is straightforward: safeguarding the Nation's fish, wildlife, and plant resources and our magnificent lands and waters requires that we recognize and capitalize on our interdependence with a larger conservation community that includes local, state, and tribal governments; non-government organizations; the private sector; and America's private landowners. Our work must reflect a unity of purpose in what we want to achieve, the vision to recognize the opportunities in the challenges we face, a determination to move forward courageously in addressing those challenges, and an optimism that these challenges can be met. I believe these qualities define our Agency and they were shared by my friend and our former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Sam Hamilton. Sam's tragic passing less than a year ago left the Service deeply wounded but, at the same time, inspired in us a strong desire to move forward in carrying out our shared vision for the Service. unity of purpose History has demonstrated that unity of purpose yields success in conserving fish, wildlife, plants and habitats. When we pull together we get things done, whether it is the creation of a system of lands and waters as a refuge for wildlife, the passage of laws to protect endangered and threatened species, or the response to a disastrous oil spill. In fact, it is my belief that unity with our State fish and wildlife agency partners is the most consequential ingredient in our success. States have the principal responsibility for fish and wildlife stewardship in America. When they are strong in that stewardship, we are strong. When they succeed, we succeed. The Service's authorities are to enhance the work of our State counterparts. This includes providing a framework for migratory bird conservation across national and international boundaries; safeguarding endangered and threatened species; regulating interState and international wildlife trade; and acquiring and managing nationally significant habitat for wildlife and fish conservation. Sam and I often spoke about the importance of maintaining our core partnerships, particularly our crucial relationship with the states. He often characterized the importance of that relationship by saying, ``Let there be no daylight between us.'' I also well remember that among my father's staunchest allies, and best friends, were State agency directors such as Dick Cronin in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania's Ralph Abele. I firmly share this commitment to partnership with the states, and growing these relationships will be a key element of my agenda if I am confirmed as Director. Unity of purpose within what we collectively call the ``conservation community'' is also an essential ingredient to success. Historically, this community has run the gamut from the most traditional sporting organizations to the most progressive environmental groups. The Service has often been a place where these interests come together, and that was certainly an ingredient in my successful tenure as National Wildlife Refuge System Chief. I supported, and benefited from, the Cooperative Alliance for Refuge Enhancement , or CARE. This group includes a cast of organizations with very diverse missions, from the National Rifle Association to the Defenders of Wildlife, working together to support the National Wildlife Refuge System. If confirmed, you have my commitment that I will foster this type of unity as a means of strengthening natural resource conservation. I believe that no single entity, whether Federal, state, tribal or private, can independently address the conservation challenges of the 21st century. We must adopt a philosophy of interdependence, which requires relationships founded in respect and trust, and I would make this a priority during my tenure as Service Director. In the Service, we are well aware that the ``conservation community'' includes America's private landowners. More than 70 percent of land in the continental United States is in private ownership, largely as farms, ranches, and forests, as well as land held in trust by the United States for various Indian tribes and individuals. While the Service's collaborative efforts range as far as international partnerships that conserve species of concern around the globe, they are also as near as work with individual landowners in America through programs such as Partners for Fish and Wildlife. vision, determination and optimism I believe unity of purpose leads to a renewed and expanded vision of what is possible in conserving our natural resources. That greater vision, in turn, serves to strengthen our determination to face adversity and act with courage and optimism, even in times of uncertainty. Throughout its history, the Service has demonstrated both the vision to identify emerging environmental threats and the determination to implement critical responses, whether rising to the challenge of the 1930's Dust Bowl of J.N. ``Ding'' Darling's tenure as Director, the widespread use of contaminants in Rachel Carson's era as a Service scientist, or the depletion of wetlands in the 1980's, when my father was helping lead the organization. We once again witnessed this vision, determination and optimism on the part of the Federal Government, the Service, the states, and our many conservation partners during the recent Gulf oil spill crisis. As Deputy Director during this crisis, I was proud to play a role in helping orchestrate the Service's response, but our Service employees were the real heroes. Nearly 2,000 of them--approximately 25 percent of the Service's workforce--worked directly on the spill, with more than 1,500 actually deploying to the Gulf Region to assist in the response after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank on the night of April 19, 2010. Service employees from all programs and pay grades cleaned tar balls off beaches; worked long hours behind the scenes hunched over laptops in Incident Command Centers; surveyed bird colonies and habitats by plane, helicopter, boat and on foot; rescued oiled birds and brought them in for cleaning; saved baby sea turtles who might otherwise have died; and volunteered for second, and third, and fourth deployments in response to the need for their services. Most important, the Service's men and women integrated smoothly into the largest, most complex, and successful Incident Command Structure ever assembled outside of a war zone. The work performed by the Service and its Federal and State partners has been critical to the overall response effort. We are proud to be playing a key role today, working in partnership with the States, private citizens, and the conservation community in restoring one of the most incredible ecosystems on the planet. This task will not be easy, and it won't be accomplished quickly. We are in it for the long haul. Nothing less than success is acceptable, and continuing our all- out support for Gulf Coast restoration will be among my top priorities as Director, should I be confirmed. We are living in an era of monumental conservation challenges, including the loss and fragmentation of habitats, genetic isolation, invasive species, water scarcity, and illegal wildlife trade. We know these challenges will be compounded by continued growth, and growing affluence in human populations and the associated demands on land and water resources. We know they will be magnified by the effects of a changing climate. All of these stressors work in concert--24 hours a day and 7 days a week--cumulatively challenging our efforts to sustain healthy, vibrant ecosystems, particularly in regard to those species already recognized as endangered, threatened, or imperiled. Our vision and our determination must be equal to these challenges. Now more than ever our conservation work must be science-driven, and the activities we undertake for species on the ground, at individual project sites, must strategically support achievement of our conservation goals at broader scales, across entire species' ranges, or what we would call ``landscapes.'' A more holistic conservation approach is particularly critical in understanding and responding to nationwide resource threats, such as the spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats--animals essential in our ecosystems as pollinators, seed dispersers, and providers of natural pest control. Named for the white fungus that appears on the muzzle and other body parts of hibernating bats, WNS has spread rapidly across the eastern United States, killing more than 1 million bats. The fungus has been detected as far west as Oklahoma, and is expected to continue spreading. To effectively manage these kinds of emerging challenges and to ensure sustainable natural systems into the future, we must develop the capacity to envision and deliver conservation across connected networks of habitats, based on scientific understanding and predictions of species' needs. That is why the Service is working with its sister bureaus in the Department of the Interior and with government, non- government, and private sector partners to establish a network of Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs), a system of science- management partnerships working in unison to support on-the-ground strategic conservation efforts at landscape scales. LCCs operate within a specific landscape--at present, 21 geographic areas in all. Active partners include Federal, state, and local governments; tribes; universities; non-governmental organizations; landowners; and others involved in resource management. Collectively, LCCs represent a national, and ultimately, international network of land, water, wildlife and cultural resource managers and interested public and private organizations. Vision in the area of scientific capacity, capability, and excellence would also continue to be a priority for me as Director, if confirmed, as it has been in my role as Deputy Director. Science is, I believe, the key to conservation success on the ground. From the creation of the world's most comprehensive waterfowl surveys to the pioneering work on the effects of DDT on migratory birds, the Service has built a reputation for science excellence that spans decades. In recent years, we have renewed our commitment to science within the Agency, taking a number of key steps including the development of the Service's first ever Scientific Code of Professional Conduct and two peer-review journals to support the work of our scientists and provide our employees with the best tools available to accomplish our conservation mission. Through careful consultation with its partners and employees, the Service will identify additional priorities for conservation science and develop additional capacity and partnerships to develop, acquire and apply science with unsurpassed excellence. I will aspire to continue strengthening the culture and capacities for scientific excellence as Service Director, should I be confirmed. At the same time, we are investing in technological tools a valuable payoff in times of tight budgets and smaller staffs. The use of Geographic Information Systems, for example, is transforming the way that our field personnel are capturing, analyzing, and managing habitat data; they are able to do in hours what otherwise would have taken months to accomplish. Our efforts to make this and other tools more widely available will have both immediate and long-term benefits. If confirmed as Director, I aspire to continue working for gains in science and technology that are reshaping the way the Service does business in the 21st Century and equipping our workforce with the necessary tools to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats--trust responsibilities that are unwavering even as our world continues to change. In 1973, Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by a nearly unanimous vote to protect those species in danger of extinction or under threat of becoming endangered. The Service is, in large measure, the Agency entrusted with administering the Act. I believe that as a country, we can take great pride in the fact that this legislation has been a success story and has prevented the loss of hundreds of species, including the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon. In implementing the ESA, we will identify opportunities to more fully engage states and tribes as partners in managing threatened and endangered species and their habitats as we operate within our limited resources and ever-increasing workload. More energy and attention should be focused on species recovery--the ultimate goal of the Act. If confirmed, I would work closely with the Committee on this issue. Of equal importance is the need to address a continuing and alarming downward trend in our Nation's fish species resulting from loss in the amount and quality of freshwater, estuarine, and marine habitats. America's fisheries have sustained our people since our earliest history, and today a multi-billion-dollar industry in commercial and recreational fishing helps to support our economy. For more than 100 years, the Service's hatchery program has worked to facilitate recreational fishing and aquatic habitat restoration through partnerships with states and tribes that benefit local communities. If confirmed one of my priorities will be ensuring that our Nation's fish and aquatic communities are receiving the attention and resources necessary, including through voluntary partnerships and other capacity- building endeavors, to successfully foster fish habitat conservation and provide benefits to the American people. Last March Secretary Salazar released The State of the Birds 2010 Report, which assessed the vulnerability of nearly 800 bird species to climate change and indicated that climate change will have an increasingly disruptive effect on bird species in all habitats. The Report noted that all 67 oceanic bird species, including petrels and albatrosses, are among the most vulnerable birds in the United States to climate change. For bird species that are already of conservation concern, such as the golden-cheeked warbler and the whooping crane, the added vulnerability to climate change may hasten declines or prevent recovery. Key to addressing this challenge is continued strong support and growth of partnership conservation initiatives such as Joint Ventures--self-directed, regional partnerships that deliver science- based, on-the-ground conservation. The State of the Birds 2009 Report also highlighted examples where habitat restoration and conservation actions have reversed previous declines. These improvements are largely attributable to a strong focus on wetlands conservation and management, particularly the overwhelming success of a continental waterfowl management plan that involved the restoration and management of more than 30 million acres of wetlands by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The efforts though programs and initiatives like Joint Ventures have demonstrated that bird populations show amazing resilience and ability to recover when the health of their habitat is sustained or restored. When we apply conservation, conservation works. Contributing to these conservation successes is the Service's Law Enforcement program, whose efforts I am committed to strengthening. Our Office of Law Enforcement investigates wildlife crimes, helps Americans understand and obey wildlife protections laws, works in partnership with international, state, and tribal counterparts to conserve wildlife resources and regulate wildlife trade. I am particularly concerned with bolstering those activities that combat the unlawful take and commercialization of our rarest wildlife species and address other critical threats to wildlife conservation. The Office's special agents, who pursue crimes that range from wildlife profiteering to habitat destruction, and wildlife inspectors, who provide the Nation's front- line defense against wildlife smuggling, work on more than 13,000 investigations each year. The success of this work is even more critical now as wildlife resources face new pressures from climate change and habitat transformation. Our National Wildlife Refuge System will be front and center in this effort, as well as in the Service's climate adaptation and landscape-scale conservation strategies. If I am confirmed, I look forward to working with Secretary Salazar, in close collaboration with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee, to strengthen the integrity of the National Wildlife Refuge System and chart a clear course for the System as a crucial element in shaping the Nation's environmental future. Just as the Fish and Wildlife Service works to preserve the diversity of America's natural resources, we are also following the Department of the Interior's lead in building a workforce that reflects the diversity of the American people. My father is proud of the fact that he hired the first modern-era female refuge manager at Canaan National Wildlife Refuge in West Virginia in the mid-70's--not very long ago. Today, the Service's workforce is strengthened by a growing gender, racial, and ethnic diversity, but we still have a long way to go. Diversity is a long-term, ongoing commitment. If confirmed, I will commit to an increased focus on this important effort. This is not just the right thing to do for people; it is also a smart way to carry out conservation. Unity of purpose requires that the makeup of our organization be reflective of American society as a whole. We will work as an executive team to set and accomplish diversity goals, and managers and supervisors will be held accountable for achieving measurable, meaningful, and lasting results in this area. We are committed to doing a better job of marketing the Service to nontraditional audiences, committing resources, training our managers and supervisors, developing our employees, and recognizing those who have taken personal responsibility for organizational change. conclusion I would be profoundly honored to become Director because of the great opportunity it gives me to be of service, both to the Nation and to an organization whose mission I strongly believe in. What I learned from my dad and from watching Service employees growing up is that public service is a privilege and a high calling, one that I answered early on in my career. The issues we are dealing with on a daily basis as a Service are very important to me and are my life's work. Next, I am convinced that what came before, including my experience on Capitol Hill and the four leadership positions I held in the Service, has prepared me for the task that lies ahead as Director, should I be confirmed. My desire is to apply all that I have learned from life and from some exceptional leaders I have had the chance to observe, including in the U.S. Congress, to foster the unity of purpose, create the vision, unleash the determination, and apply the spirit of optimism that are needed to ensure a sustainable future for fish and wildlife and healthy ecosystems for wildlife and people. I am excited about what is possible for the Service and for the Nation as we move forward in creating science partnerships across the public and private sectors through LCCs; as we leave ``no daylight between us'' in our collaboration with states and other partners; as we pursue scientific excellence within and outside our ranks to inform our decisionmaking; as we move forward in restoring Gulf Coast ecosystems; as we seek ways to improve our implementation of conservation laws; as we work to reconnect people to the great outdoors; and as we grow a diverse and inclusive workforce that will prepare this organization to lead our conservation mission well into the future. I believe that in every challenge there are incredible opportunities waiting to be seized upon by those with the motivation and the tenacity to do so. That brings me to the final, and most important reason, I would be honored to serve: the people who make up the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Our employees give everything they have to the mission out of their passion for America's fish, wildlife and plant resources and the incredible diversity of landscapes and water bodies that support them. These employees do not need anyone to ``motivate'' them--they are driven by their deep-seated desire to ensure the legacy of wild places and wild things for this and future generations. What those inside the Service know is that when it comes to leadership, it is strong at every level of the organization. We are led both top down and bottom up. Some of the most exciting innovations we have undertaken, including carbon sequestration to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases and strategic habitat conservation, were ideas that began at the field level, where most of our workforce is employed. My job as Director, if confirmed, would be to nurture, foster, and guide that indomitable spirit of innovation, remove obstacles to our success, and lead us forward in pursuing the relationships and the organizational and scientific excellence that will be required to achieve the Service's and the Nation's conservation mission. I am extraordinarily grateful that President Obama and Secretary Salazar have placed their trust in me as the nominee to serve as Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. If confirmed, I can assure you that I will work in a spirit of collaboration with Congress, state, tribal and Federal agencies, and all stakeholders in pursuing what I know to be our mutual interests in securing the health and well-being of our Nation's fish and wildlife resources and their habitats for the benefit of the American people. I am honored and humbled at the opportunity to appear before you and happy to answer any questions you may have concerning my qualifications and willingness to lead what I believe to be the finest organization of fish and wildlife conservation professionals in the world. Senator Boxer. Thank you so very much for your eloquent testimony. I have a couple of required questions for your nomination. Do you agree, if confirmed by the Senate, to appear before this committee or designated members of this committee and other appropriate committees of the Congress and provide information, subject to appropriate and necessary security protection, with respect to your responsibilities? Mr. Ashe. I do. Senator Boxer. Do you agree to ensure that testimony, briefings, documents and electronic and other forms of communication are provided to this committee and its staff and other appropriate committees in a timely manner? Mr. Ashe. I do. Senator Boxer. Do you know of any matters which you may or may not have disclosed that might place you in any conflict of interest if you are confirmed? Mr. Ashe. I do not. Senator Boxer. OK. Let me just say, I don't have a lot of questions, Mr. Ashe, because to me, you are an excellent nominee. Your dedication to this, your willingness to work with all of us, I think it shines through. I am going to put a couple of things in the record. The Ranking Member and I are very good friends. We agree on a lot of things, and we disagree on some things. It is no great shock to know that we do disagree on the issue of climate change. Instead of getting through a back and forth, in my view, I am going to put at this point into the record a release that was put out by President Bush's Interior Secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, and this is what it said: ``Today, as President Bush announced U.S. support for development of a new framework on climate change, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne affirmed that the ongoing work of the new Interior Department Climate Change Task Force is essential to ensuring that his department fulfills its mission.'' He says, ``I recently created the Department of the Interior Task Force to study climate change, because of its possible effects on our ability to be good stewards of wildlife, national parks and other landscapes, as well as our responsibility to help moderate greenhouse gas emissions.'' He says ``This is a priority for both Department leaders and employees in the field.'' [The referenced information was not received at time of print.] Senator Boxer. I put that in the record, because there is a misconception here that this is turning into a Republican versus Democratic battle. Maybe it is today, but it certainly wasn't at that time. The other thing I want to put in the record is very important, and I think Senator Udall, you would be interested in this. There is a very important report that was put out about a year ago. It is called Global Warming's Threat to Hunting and Fishing. In the report, at the top page, it is a quote from your dad. It says, ``Each generation has its own rendevous with the land. By choice or by default, we will carve out a land legacy for our heirs.'' Stuart Lee Udall. Then it goes on, and the people who issued these report are: Ducks Unlimited, Trout Unlimited, the Isaak Walton League of America, the Bass ESPN Outdoors, the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the Coastal Conservation Association, the American Sportfishing Association, Pheasants Forever, the Boone and Crockett Club. This report was edited and supported by the Wildlife Management Institute and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. So the reason I want to put this in the record, and I will just read one paragraph in my time remaining, ``The urgency to address the effects of climate change on fish and wildlife have become increasingly evident. Already, waterfowl exhibit changes in seasonal distribution. Higher water temperatures and diminished stream habitat are threatening coldwater fish, such as trout and salmon. Big game are shifting to more northerly latitudes and to higher elevations to escape summer heat and find suitable forage. With each passing season, the need to develop strategies and invest in management practices to assist fish and wildlife adapting to a warmer world becomes more imperative.'' [The referenced information was not received at time of print.] Senator Boxer. So now again, this isn't any politician saying this. This is Ducks Unlimited, Trout Unlimited, et cetera. So I just put those in the record, because I think they stand, I think they are eloquent statements without politics getting into it, mine or anybody else's. So I guess my one question is, because this is so important to all of us here, do you promise us that science will lead you in all of these issues, regardless of what it is? Will science lead you? Will you tell us what the science shows you? It is up to us to balance the science with other issues that we face. But from you, I believe it is your job, that is what I believe your job is, to let us know what the science is"
