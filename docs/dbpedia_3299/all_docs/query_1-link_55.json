        "text": "With more than 132 million orphans worldwide, the United States should make grand leaps toward ensuring more children grow up in permanent, loving homes. These pieces of legislation, the “Families for Orphans Act of 2009” and the “Foreign Adopted Children Equality (FACE) Act”, advance this goal by making global adoption more efficient and by promoting family placement internationally.\n\nThe current international adoption system prolongs and complicates the process it takes to adopt abroad by placing the responsibilities of adoption throughout several offices and bureaus and requiring adoptive parents to go through extensive citizenship procedures for their adopted children. With the passing of these bills, however, parents will enjoy the organization of a single office handling their adoption process as well as allow for citizenship to apply to their new child from birth at the time the adoption is complete.\n\nWe all know studies show that families provide more opportunity for children to develop into happy and productive adults, which in turn leads to a healthier, more productive global community, and that is why I support these efforts to make adopting the many international children who need homes as efficient and seamless as possible. These bills will lower the costs of adopting abroad by nixing visa immigration fees for adopted children and shorten the wait time it takes to process a global adoption.\n\nI hope these bills will work together to first try and place orphans with their relatives, then if that is not an option, allow for a streamlined adoption process without fraud. Every child deserves a loving family, which is why Representative Watson and I are excited about these bills and look forward to their passage in the House. I want to thank Senators Inhofe and Landrieu who introduced companion bills in the Senate, S. 1376 and S. 1458, which also work toward providing more orphans with the protection, permanency, safety and love of a family."
