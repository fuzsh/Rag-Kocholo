Sam's ex-husband Xander lingers over the meeting, as Sam flashes back to how his bizarre, controlling mother ruined their plans for an amicable divorce and that she's been paying for it ever since. Sam gets mad at Sunny because she and her ex-husband Jeff are doing well as amicable exes, and Sam also is her usual unpleasant self to Lala's ex Thomas, who in turn points out all the ways Sam doesn't know what she's talking about and snidely remarks how she's becoming old, brittle and mean.

Frankie makes a speech that thanks Sam for being a single mother and raising her and is happy that Xander choose to attend. Xander then makes a kind speech about Frankie but embarrasses himself when he incorrectly congratulates her on turning 16. Rich and Jeff both give Xander a piece of their mind: Rich makes it clear he's more of a father to Sam's daughters than Xander has ever been, and Jeff levels Xander by pointing out Jeff has been the completely despised person that Xander is now and he worked hard to mend fences with the people he'd let down. Xander then talks with Sam about how much he enjoyed the party with his family and apologizes for not being around more. Sam invites Xander to come for dinner with the girls later in the week.

Sam works on a TV story where she interviews women about their menstrual periods and then about the trials and joys of being a woman in society. The next day, Sam's ex-husband Xander comes by for dinner, only to find that Max, Frankie, and Duke have gone off together to the beach. Xander is treated with deserved contempt by Phil and later by Rich, as Rich lets him know that it wasn't an accident that the girls weren't there as part of a \"test\" to see if Xander would be his usual no-show self. Xander asks Sam for his usual alimony payment, but Sam tells him it is different: she's bundling all of the money she owes to him into a single check, and she took out a bank loan to pay for it because she would rather owe a bank than Xander. She says they have a clean slate now, and she's forgiving him–not because she likes him now, but for the good of herself, her life and \"my daughters\". Xander leaves and is later humiliated when he sees the check has the company heading \"Xander Hall Is A Loser Who Abandoned His Kids, LLC\". Sam, Phil, and Rich enjoy night-swimming at the neighbor's pool.
