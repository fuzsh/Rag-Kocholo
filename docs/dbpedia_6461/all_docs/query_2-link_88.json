        "text": "If streaming was the television story of the decade, then close behind was the explosion of global content that came to American screens to help fill all that new bandwidth. Shows suddenly appeared from all over the world, most noticeably financed or acquired by Netflix but also flooding in through a myriad of other streaming services and cable networks. Americans will read subtitles, it turns out. (I’d prefer to think no one’s choosing the dubbed English soundtracks.)\n\nThe world is a big place, with a lot of production companies, and on any given day in 2019 there were likely to be more international shows premiering in America than American-made shows. Over the years I’ve tried to sample as much of that bounty as I could, from cozy British mysteries to florid Asian soap operas and everything in between. I’ve distilled all those hours into this list of my top 30 international shows of the last decade, full of glaring omissions which you’re encouraged to gently point out in the comments.\n\nThe requirements for my list: scripted series produced outside the United States (though some were American-financed), which were commercially available to American audiences, and which premiered in 2010 or later. I cheated on the dates for one show, the 2009 “Prisoners of War,” which didn’t appear in America until 2012 and was just too good to leave out.\n\nBritain takes 12 of the 30 spots, which might represent some cultural and language biases on my part but mainly reflects that country’s unmatched heritage of making good TV, with significant government support. And before you say I “forgot” them: Yes, I’ve watched “Peaky Blinders” and “Schitt’s Creek.”"
