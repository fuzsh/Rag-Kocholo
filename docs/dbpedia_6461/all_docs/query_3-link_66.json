        "text": "Share\n\nDid you know that Los Angeles is home to over 200 MICHELIN Guide restaurants? Out of that 200, 51 are participating in this year’s Dine LA Restaurant Week. Running from July 12 - 26th, deciding on where to eat in the City of Angels has never been more difficult.\n\nBut that’s where we come in. From the best deals in town to where to stay after filling up, here is the breakdown on which MICHELIN Guide spots to visit this Restaurant Week to maximize flavor and value.\n\nAlhambra\n\nSichuan ImpressionCuisine: Chinese\n\nPrice: $65 lunch/dinner menu\n\nOther than the delicious Sichuan hits, be prepared for a wait. With two additional locations in Tustin and West Los Angeles, you’ll be thankful for the big windows and airy interiors once the scarlet-red numbing oils and fiery, chopped chilis arrive.\n\nInspector notes: “All of the usual hits are still in play—tea-smoked duck, big mouth ginger frog, mapo tofu. One recent highlight was a cauldron of fish and rattan pepper boiled in a thrillingly complex broth rippling with numbing, spicy tones.”\n\nStay nearby:\n\nAt Hotel Per La guests are greeted with vibrant rooms featuring timeless, yet modern European influences. What they don’t expect, however, is to experience the history of Downtown L.A. Formerly home to the Bank of Italy, the Giannini Building’s flagship restaurant and rooftop pool and bar will transport you back to the golden age of Hollywood.\n\nSichuan Impression\n\nArcadia\n\nSushi Kisen\n\nCuisine: Japanese\n\nPrice: $65 lunch/dinner menu\n\nSushi restaurants can be as expensive as a mortgage and as quiet as a library, but this casual Arcadia hotspot is a wonderfully refreshing change of pace. The setting is more like Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing, a frenetic intersection of customers lined up at the door, servers scurrying about, and chefs working like they are on a tight deadline. Counter seating or a table farther back? Omakase or à la carte? It doesn’t matter.\n\nInspector notes: \"The rice for the nigiri is reliably generous and lush in texture, and fish flies in from Japan on Monday and on Thursday. For this reason, Friday is often packed, as regulars look to catch the freshest shipment. Efficient, fairly priced and friendly, Sushi Kisan meets all expectations in the most approachable of ways.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nSoho Warehouse DTLA\n\nLike the other Soho House locations, it’s a club first and a hotel second, but overnight guests earn the benefits of temporary membership — this means access to the 50-foot rooftop swimming pool, as well as the House’s public spaces, including the Rooftop Terrace and Bar, the House Kitchen, and the Garden, an impressive indoor-outdoor dining and drinking venue. There’s art everywhere, including a massive mural by Shepard Fairey, and the lavishly outfitted gym spans two floors of the building.\n\nSoho Warehouse DTLA\n\nArts District\n\nManuelaCuisine: American\n\nPrice: $55 lunch menu\n\nCreativity is in the air in this restaurant. Conceptual art and an open-plan kitchen whet the appetite, while Southern leaning dishes serve as entrée.\n\nInspector notes: “Inspired by deer camps from the local farming community, the venison burger sandwiched between brioche with pickled green tomato and fried leeks is top of the charts. Sprinkled with benne seeds, Gulf shrimp aguachile with cucumber and avocado is enriched by a ginger-lime dressing. Excellent desserts await, but for a simple finale go for one of the house-made sorbets.”\n\nGirl & the Goat Los Angeles\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nIf you’re in the Arts District and want to go to a place that is vibrant and lively, this is it. Top Chef alum Stephanie Izard marries gutsy flavors with global inspiration with airy vibes here (credit it to the natural lighting and potted greens) for the total package in fine dining.\n\nInspector notes: “Savory dishes, like roasted oysters and goat curry, feed the evening crowds while über-popular Sunday brunch lures diners with items like the potato crepe, a whimsical riff on the Vietnamese banh xeo.”\n\nYangban Society\n\nCuisine: Asian\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nThis 5,000 square-foot space is more than just a dinner spot. Pulling triple duty as a deli, mini-mart, and restaurant, guests can pick their own adventure at the three dining areas.\n\nInspector notes: “Expect straight-up comfort food with Korean flair. \"Bolognese\" is ramped up with fermented black bean sauce; fried chicken dressed in a soy-garlic glaze presents a perfect balance of savory and sweet (you'll need extra napkins); and the pickles on display in the showcase are an ideal accompaniment. Chilled acorn noodles are a refreshing base for toasted nori, fried garlic and pickled perilla seeds in a shirodashi-based vinaigrette.”\n\nkodō\n\nCuisine: Izakaya\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nNatural materials set the scene with serenity and calm. Guests can choose between sitting outside in the SoCal sun or indoors, while the menu celebrates Kyoto cuisine with a splash of Cali influences.\n\nInspector notes: “Off-menu specials, such as the Japanese sea snail, are especially memorable, while sea bream and octopus are impeccable. A steaming bowl of little neck clams garlic and butter is dreamy. Up for something sweet? Cheesecake with passion fruit sauce and kinako crumble is a favorite. “\n\nStay nearby:\n\nDesigned by GREC Architects and Commune Design, the Ace Hotel Downtown is more than just a boutique hotel. Once home to the likes of Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W. Griffith, the interiors are dusted with the magic of old world Hollywood.\n\nStan Lee/Girl & the Goat Los Angeles\n\nAce Hotel Downtown\n\nBeverly Hills\n\nCUT\n\nCuisine: Steakhouse\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nExpect simply prepared meats and market-driven fare here, where the menu focuses on classics that never seem to go out of style. This is clear in the Maryland blue crab and Louisiana shrimp dressed in a tangy “Louis” sauce set over horseradish panna cotta. There are plenty of cuts from across the US to choose from, but those from Idaho's Snake River Farms are always on point.\n\nInspector notes: \"The versatile kitchen pays equal attention to other such delectable items as Maine diver scallops and roasted poussin. The kitchen sources locally grown vegetables, and snow peas or autumn squash prove that sides aren't an afterthought.\"\n\nmatū\n\nCuisine: Steakhouse\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nDid someone say date night? The exposed brick walls and wood panels act as the perfect complement to the warm and intimate ambiance, while the open kitchen allows onlookers to see the action of tender New Zealand steaks being prepared uninterrupted.\n\nInspector notes: \"Wagyu is usually a budget buster, but here it's offered at an unusually accessible price. Its delicate, exceptional flavor will have you remembering its for weeks to come. Steaks may be the heart of the menu, but fazzoletti with a slow-braised beef ragu are a fine choice.\"\n\nKazan\n\nCuisine: Japanese\n\nPrice: $55 lunch menu\n\nHandmade soba? Check. Bib Gourmand? Check. Chef Ryu Isobe's local spot is the perfect place for those wanting a no fuss and easy on the wallet meal. Once you see the bright yellow sign, you'll know you've arrived.\n\nInspector notes: \"The name is Japanese for \"volcanic\" and conveniently this soba-focused spot blows the lid off its competitors. The menu offers many a choice, including a vegetarian option, but the #7 (or lamb in lava) is a clear winner—set afloat with strands of hirauchi soba, Japanese spices, miso paste, and cilantro in chicken broth. Get slurping on this unique specialty and never look back.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nFew hotels are as synonymous with Beverly Hills as The Maybourne. Elegant interiors, phenomenal service, and California-inspired cuisine at the Terrace restaurant converge in one spot for the ultimate luxury experience.\n\nAnd while you're in the neighborhood, be sure to also check out Mírame, a Mexican spot with the perfect balance of traditional and modern dishes.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of CUT\n\nThe Maybourne Beverly Hills\n\nCalabasas\n\nSaddle Peak Lodge\n\nCuisine: American\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nThis log cabin used to be frequented by the liked of Charlie Chaplin, Clark Gable, and the Rat Pack. Those touches of old Hollywood are alive in the current iteration, but with an added touch of delectable dishes made from wild game including bison, buffalo, and elk.\n\nInspector notes: \"To start, a creamy and wonderfully seasoned pea soup. Next up, brown butter-sauced rainbow trout, served with sweet acorn squash and salty ricotta salata.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nBook early, because rooms at The Surfrider Malibu sell out quickly. Each room is filled with organic textures—think reclaimed teak floorboards and modern-rustic furnishings—with upstair rooms featuring their own terraces with eye-watering views of the Pacific Ocean. Those wanting to linger on property should book a table at the guest-only roof terrace restaurant at sunset for a picture-perfect escape.\n\nSaddle Peak Lodge\n\nCentury City\n\nLumière\n\nCuisine: French\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nNestled inside the Fairmont Century Plaza, Lumière is a relaxed brasserie-styled spot for French-inspired cooking. Friendly staff are on hand to offer guidance and share their favorite selections, but you'll certainly want to indulge in a variety of classics like fruits de mer and steak frites, if only for the delicious fries.\n\nInspector notes: \"Start things off right by ordering the velvety chicken liver mousse served with an olive jam, or sample the Bayonne, Fermin Iberico or five year-aged Iberico hams from the charcuterie menu. Seared sea bass is plated with a delicious onion soubise for a pleasing main dish. Then for dessert, you'll never go wrong with crème brûlée with its pure vanilla flavor and nutty caramelized crust.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Peninsula Beverly Hills\n\nThe Peninsula Beverly Hills is almost impossibly opulent, even by Hollywood standards, a cinematically pristine Renaissance mansion of the sort that takes offense at sparing expense. A favorite of industry bigwigs, the hotel means it when it boasts of executive-level service — from the fleet of Rolls Royces and BMW's to the lavish “programmes” with celebrity stylists and gurus, this is LA at its shiniest.\n\nThe Surfrider Malibu\n\nCerritos\n\nAmor y Tacos\n\nCuisine: Mexican\n\nPrice: $25 lunch/dinner menu\n\nYet another in the wave of Mexican-American LA chefs transforming the cuisine, Thomas Ortega brings his fine-dining drill to bear on this vibrant offering in his native Cerritos. Here he fuses his specific style of the city’s Mexican cuisine, like handmade tortillas and spicy salsas, with an American twist.\n\nInspector notes: \"Look for that Coca-Cola glaze on his pork belly or the sprinkle of Doritos on chilaquiles, not to mention such luxurious accents as truffles.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nKimpton Shorebreak Hotel\n\nAmong the legendary towns on the California coast Huntington Beach is afforded an almost mythic status. This is Surf City, quite possibly one of America’s mellowest places, and as such it’s finally got the hotel it deserves, courtesy of the Kimpton hotel group: the Shorebreak Hotel, right on the Pacific Coast Highway overlooking the Huntington Beach Pier.\n\nPalihotel Culver City\n\nCulver City\n\nMayura\n\nCuisine: Indian\n\nPrice: $65 lunch/dinner menu\n\nDon't let the simple interiors fool you. Inside, bright accents and biophillic elements sprinkle the space with charm while the plates are focused on flavors from Kerala.\n\nInspector notes: \"Be sure to save room though for the divine ghee roast dosa, as this tall, triangular and crisp creation served with sambar and chutney is mighty impressive even as it floats out of the kitchen. Simmering with spices, Kerala chicken curry will have you returning in no time.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nOne block away from Culver Boulevard means the Palihotel Culver City is the ideal spot for those hoping to explore the area's booming nightlife and restaurant scene.\n\nPadmini Aniyan/Mayura\n\nDowntown\n\nBADMAASH\n\nCuisine: Indian\n\nPrice: $25 lunch menu\n\nNow boasting two locations, this Indian gastropub helmed by a father and his two sons is as popular as ever, and with good reason. The skilled kitchen delivers each dish with flavor and fun, employing authentic ingredients with global inspiration. Find the clearest expression of their philosophy in the poutine, accompanied by masala-spiced potatoes with gravy, mozzarella and chicken tikka.\n\nInspector notes: \"Try one of their butter chicken samosas or tuck into Mother's recipe of saag paneer with sauteed spinach and tomato with garam masala and paneer, then chase it with a mango lassi.\"\n\nBRERA Ristorante\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu, $55 dinner menu\n\nThere are Italian restaurants all over, and then there are restaurants that cook real Italian food. With a nod to the Brera district in Milan, which boasts a deep history of agriculture, art and fashion, this operation honors its namesake with an edgy space, warm décor, and cooking that's specific to the Lombardy and Veneto regions. Affable and informed servers merely add to the lure.\n\nInspector notes: \"Launch into a fried donzelle with dry-cured lonzino, lardo and salame Felino; or luscious octopus with a chickpea purée and 'Nduja.\"\n\nThe Factory Kitchen\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu, $55 dinner menu\n\nThis “factory” is actually sleek, with cement columns, a modern bar and wide-open garage doors that enhance its lofty feel. However, the heart and soul of its kitchen is dedicated to traditional Northern Italian cuisine. This should come as no surprise, as Angelo Auriana and Matteo Ferdinandi are turning heads with their quickly expanding empire.\n\nInspector notes: \"Devotion to regionally specific flavors is clear in every bite. Ravioli, made in house, tucked with seafood and tossed in an aromatic and savory sauce, is a winner, but don't skip the shatteringly crisp focaccina calda di Recco, filled with Crescenza cheese—it's sublime.\"\n\nMaccheroni Republic\n\nCuisine: Italian-American\n\nPrice: $35 lunch menu, $45 dinner menu\n\nThere’s a reason why tables at this local favorite are always filled. The inconspicuous exteriors and tiled walls may deceive passing tourists, but behind those tall mirrors are classic Italian-American dishes and handmade pastas that will have you asking for seconds.\n\nInspector notes: “The array of excellent handmade pastas is seemingly endless, like long, tubular strands of bigoli della nonna, headlining an impeccably balanced angus-and-sausage ragout. Then, try to pry yourself away from the noodle nexus and savory tomato-based sauces to savor freshly baked olive oil bread, deliciously paired with bites of polpettine di gamberi. Be sure to finish with a creamy affogato and be on your merry way.”\n\nRedbird\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nThe open ceiling (and occasional celebrity sighting) at this former church means diners can pick and choose which stars to gaze at. Perhaps even more impressive is the globally influenced menu filled with creative dishes coupled with traditional treats.\n\nInspector notes: “Save room for clever desserts like yuzu custard with basil oil and cucumber sorbet, or opt for another cocktail from the extensive list.”\n\nLA Cha Cha Chá\n\nCuisine: Mexican\n\nPrice: $55 lunch menu, $65 dinner menu\n\nThe sister spot of Mexico City’s Terraza Cha Cha Chá, this downtown LA version boasts sweeping views and delivers with equally gorgeous bites.\n\nInspector notes: “The tostada terraza takes a crisp tortilla and piles on lush bluefin tuna with a flutter of fragrant crispy cilantro and a drizzle of chile morita aioli; pollo a las brasas is perfectly roasted and dressed with an achiote piquin sauce. Desserts are a masterpiece, as in a chocolate flan topped with a cocoa crisp flavored with Xila, a mezcal-based agave liquor highlighting the flavors of Puebla and Oaxaca.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nAt the Hoxton, Downtown LA, public spaces are king. Crafted with the help of Soho House, the Hoxton bridges the club experience with hotel amenities. In-hotel dining options run the gamut from classic American diner, Sibling Rival, and stylish Mediterranean-inspired seafood bar, Pilot, making this DTLA an instant hit. The rooms are nothing to laugh at either, with each being decorated with House of Hackney printed wallpapers and hand-selected books.\n\nWonho Frank Lee/ La Cha Cha Chá\n\nThe Hoxton, Downtown LA\n\nRossoblu\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $55 dinner menu\n\nQuality ingredients, simple execution, and vibrant flavors define this Italian staple. Helming this Bib Gourmand is chef/owner Steve Samson who levies his adventures of roaming Emilia-Roagna to create authentic regional cuisine that would satisfy any palate.\n\nInspector notes: “Pastas, like tagliolini tossed with ragù Bolognese and nutty parmesan are pure perfection. Close on the heels is an irresistible brick of tiramisu crowned with candied cocoa nib cream.”\n\nShibumiCuisine: Japanese\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nAt One Star Shibumi, guests can expect an intimate and engaging meal focused on kappo-style cuisine.\n\nInspector notes: “The multicourse kappo-style is the best way to experience this kitchen's creations. Dishes bring together a range of inspired Japanese flavors, but equal attention is given to texture and artistic presentations. Fixed menus here present a progression of courses selected by the chefs, which may include a few raw dishes. Highlights include wild fatty yellowtail with four-year-aged ginger and nori paste that packs a burst of umami.”\n\nThe Exchange\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $25 lunch menu, $65 dinner menu\n\nAptly named after the historic 32-foot-tall “Commercial Exchange” sign decorating the exterior, this bright and comfortable dining room is hard to miss. Tucked inside the Freehand Hotel, diners can expect contemporary Middle Eastern cooking with Israeli, Californian, and Filipino influences.\n\nInspector notes: “Opt for the salatim platter, a rotating trio of items like rich hummus with a dusting of piquant Syrian pepper; or shredded red cabbage with peanuts and dukkah. Simple desserts, including a warm dark chocolate chip cookie, are especially satisfying.”\n\nNiku X\n\nCuisine: Yakiniku\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu, $65 dinner menu\n\nNestled on the second floor of The Wilshire Grand Center, Niku X is a stunner, featuring soaring ceilings and sleek design. Classic yakiniku-style dishes are cooked over state-of-the-art robatayaki grills, enlivened with contemporary techniques. Beef is the focal point, whether it’s certified Japanese A5 wagyu, or wagyu-breed cattle sourced from the States (including the group’s own California ranch), enhanced with on-site dry aging.\n\nInspector notes: \"Four menus are on offer: standard and premium yakiniku tastings (reserved for two); a tomahawk tasting with a 46-oz namesake that can feed up to three; and a slightly more accessible à la carte featuring select items from the other menus. Note that the yakiniku tastings are the only ones offered in the luxe private room.\"\n\nSan Laurel\n\nCuisine: Spanish\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nSan Laurel is at the top of its game—quite literally, since this tenth-floor dazzler affords unobstructed views of Walt Disney Concert Hall from its polished perch. With soothing earth tones, lush greenery, a bustling bar and a breezy vibe courtesy of a fully opened facade, it looks and feels like an urban oasis. Expect modern Californian dishes with Spanish leanings from a talented team put together by visionary chef, José Andrés.\n\nInspector notes: \"A tartare turns tradition on its head when \"beefsteak\" is actually tomatoes in a perfect disc, topped with a \"yolk\" made of gelatinous tomato water.\"\n\nasterid by Ray Garcia\n\nCuisine: Californian\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nWhile Frank Gehry’s iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall may be the reason many people stop by here, the food is what makes them stay. Chef Garcia’s evolving menu of seasonal produce filled with Latin American, Asian and European influences tantalize tastebuds keeping guests coming for more.\n\nInspector notes: “Begin with a refreshing aguachile, where firm cubes of hiramasa are paired perfectly with melon, cucumber and fiery serrano chili. Then, a terra-cotta pot arrives brimming with shredded braised oxtail and beans atop a masa-based \"spaetzle.\" The deconstructed strawberry shortcake with hibiscus-flavored angel food cake and strawberry ice cream ends things on a sweet note.“\n\nStay nearby:\n\nMarked by the expansive 12 story neon “Commercial Exchange” sign, this historic building marks Freehand’s third entry into the hospitality world. From shared rooms with bunk beds to suites with panoramic views of downtown Los Angeles, the Freehand Los Angeles provides spaces for everyone.\n\nRossoblu\n\nFreehand Los Angeles\n\nEcho Park\n\nElf Café\n\nCuisine: Mediterranean\n\nPrice: $35 dinner menu\n\nThere are no elves running the show at this intimate spot but with just three people staffing the kitchen throughout service, they're certainly working like Santa's helpers. It's a wine bar, so expect a nice selection of bottles, but there's also cider and beer, as well as non-alcoholic offerings. Originally fully vegetarian, Elf Cafe has tweaked its Mediterranean-minded menu to now include animal proteins.\n\nInspector notes: \"The lamb skewers, marinated and seared to a crisp crust. Paired with a refreshing yogurt sauce and onions hit with sumac, it's skillfull and satisfying.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Paramour Estate\n\nServices, of course, are minimal — beyond housekeeping service and breakfast in the Butler’s Pantry, you’ll live like it’s your own house. Comforts, though, are maximal: Matteo linens, Byredo bath products, Stumptown coffee, the works. And that’s not even considering the visual character of the place, which leaves even the most eclectic boutique hoteliers in the dust.\n\nLuxe Sunset Boulevard\n\nEncino\n\nPasta | Bar\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nStart off at this One Star joint with drinks and a snack, before relocating for the main event—intriguing cuisine like fresh pasta pockets filled with black truffle and sprinkled with sunflower petals, or seared duck breast arranged with a fermented green garlic-filled agnolotti. The best part? It's all made using hyper-local ingredients.\n\nInspector notes: \"Lamb loin is plated with a braised meat-stuffed ravioli, salsify puree and young snap peas. Desserts, like goat milk-white chocolate mousse, promise nothing less than sweet dreams.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nSpread out across seven acres of parkland, the Luxe Sunset Boulevard Hotel's sleek and contemporary interiors continue to wow guests. The warm and stylish rooms are equipped with flat-screen TVs, iPod docking stereos, and massive Roman-style baths. But with the full-service spa available and minutes away from the artifact-filled Getty Center, you probably won't need them.\n\nLiam Brown / Pasta | Bar\n\nHermosa Beach\n\nRYLACuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $35 lunch menu, $55 dinner menu\n\nDon’t get distracted by the coastal design elements and sophisticated vibes. Husband and wife duo Ray Hayashi and Cynthia Hetlinger serve delicious plates of Japanese-centric dishes with Asian influences. And while the small plates are perfect for sharing, we won’t tell anyone if you don’t.\n\nInspector notes: “Pick a main like ox tongue curry rice. This Japanese curry with a touch of sweetness is chock full of vegetables and cubes of buttery tender ox tongue, while rice finished with sweet corn and pickled green strawberries cuts the richness. End with matcha tiramisu or soy milk pudding, topped with a brown sugar gelee, fresh strawberries and a scoop of strawberry shiso sorbet with a spicy ginger-sugared churro.”\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe first of its kind in Redondo Beach, the Shade Hotel, Redondo Beach has Instagram worthy views of the ocean, extending all the way up to Malibu. And while there are just 54 rooms, each is designed with shades of blue and green, amplifying the effect of the mesmerizing oceanfront.\n\nDylan J. Ho/RYLA\n\nHollywood\n\nKali\n\nCuisine: Californian\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nExperience Hollywood like a local at this neigbhorhood spot. Inside, chef Kevin Meehan's organic and sustianable cuisine is paired with eclectic wines and craft beers.\n\nInspector notes: \"A meat refrigerator displaying dry-aged ducks, steaks and even a whole pig’s head is a natural conversation-starter and keeps all eyes on the food, which in turn lives up to its promise. Imagine a distinct spin on local flavors and of-the-moment techniques, like fermentation, preservation and deep charring to get a sense of what this place is about. Creativity also dominates each course, as seen in the barley risotto. Everything paired with the hanger steak, like buttermilk-garlic jus and porcini mushrooms with roasted potatoes, tastes like its perfect complement.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe original Gold Diggers was a bikini bar. This rendition still borrows the same sign above the Santa Monica Boulevard entrance, but with the added rehearsal space, venue, and recording studio. If you've ever wanted to live like a rockstar for a night, then this electrifying boutique hotel is it.\n\nKali\n\nInglewood\n\nConi’Seafood\n\nCuisine: Mexican\n\nPrice: $25 lunch menu, $55 dinner menu\n\nThis local treasure has been earning accolades since it first opened in 1987. Today it continues to flourish as a family affair, as the founder’s daughter is running the show. It's the perfect setting for relishing the kitchen’s Nayarit-style cooking that showcases shrimp and fish imported from Sinaloa.\n\nInspector notes: \"Those shrimp appear again and again, perhaps breaded and fried in tacos, or sautéed head-on in a bright red sauce of roasted chilies and beer. Enjoy their fish fried, cooked whole or even inside heaping bowls of ceviche with bracing, lemony flavors and a basket of chips.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Hotel June\n\nThe first in what’s to be the more affordable sibling of the luxury-boutique Proper Hotels line is Hotel June, occupying a classic mid-century hotel building by architect Welton Becket, on Lincoln Boulevard just to the north of LAX. Convenience is a small part of its appeal, but don’t think of it as an airport hotel — it’s equally close to Marina del Rey, with Venice just beyond, and Venice-style “West L.A.” living is what it’s all about.\n\nHotel June\n\nKoreatown\n\nDanbi\n\nCuisine: Korean\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nDanbi sports a sleek, modern dining room with an industrial feel (think concrete floors, hanging plants, and dark wood tables) as well as a large bar for bites and sips like their \"kimchi mule.\" Chef Lareine Ko's streamlined menu pops with large, shareable plates. The hit list includes mushroom bibimbap with fresh vegetables, as well as a crispy scallop pancake accompanied by a creamy mentaiko sauce.\n\nInspector notes: \"Wagyu Zabuton, cooked over charcoal and served on a hot cast iron skillet over a bed of grilled onions, is a solid winner. End the meal with one of Chef Isabell Manibusan's pastries—perhaps the almost-nostalgic banana milk cloud with brûléed meringue and banana milk crème anglaise, or the Mont Halla, a Korean twist on a Mont Blanc.\"\n\nOpenaire\n\nCuisine: Californian\n\nPrice: $25 lunch menu, $55 dinner menu\n\nChef Josiah Citrin helms this greenhouse-like space situated inside the LINE Hotel. Diners can experience a taste of Citrin's flavors from Two Star Mélisse through the buzzy menu.\n\nInspector notes: \"Two winning selections include a meaty duck ragout tagliatelle tossed with a dusting of pistachios and pecorino, and perfect Parker House rolls accompanied by an array of spreads, such as cashew-arugula pesto. A sumptuous stew of Caledonian shrimp and heirloom beans is an earthy delight—not unlike the dreamy brown butter-pear tart served with lemongrass ice cream.\"\n\nhibi\n\nCuisine: Japanese Contemporary\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nhibi may have started life as a casual concept but it's shifted gears and is firmly planted in the fine dining scene. The intimate space shares a sleek, minimalist design with gray walls, tables and chairs fitted with black leather.\n\nInspector notes: \"While this restaurant has changed concept to now feature a new chef and menu every season, expect to see some underlying Korean and Japanese influence with dishes like sliced red abalone grilled over binchotan, served with barley \"risotto,\" fermented scallions, and gamtae seaweed or their Korean-influenced tiramisu with ssuk mascarpone cream and crumble with azuki beans.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nAdjacent to Koreatown, The LINE Hotel Los Angeles has become a staple in the Los Angeles boutique-hotel landscape. Designed by local designer Sean Knibb, interiors are filled with vibrant colors and unique furnishings. And to make things even better, The LINE also hosts a variety of entertainment options: Openaire on the second floor, a café by Alfred Coffee, and a design shop by local duo Poketo to name a few.\n\nOpenaire/The LINE Hotel\n\nThe LINE Hotel\n\nManhattan Beach\n\nManhattan Beach Post\n\nCuisine: International\n\nPrice: $55 dinner menu\n\nThere’s a reason why this Bib Gourmand from chef/co-owner David LeFevre is one of the area’s buzziest spots. Featuring creative bites, the menu is as playful as the casual and fun space with something for everyone—just make sure to try their bacon-cheddar buttermilk biscuits.\n\nInspector notes: “Everything revolves around gathering, conversing and sharing; portions are small so plan your ordering as a group to explore a majority of the menu. Weekends can veer towards loud and crowded with plenty of young families in tow, so this isn’t a place for anyone with a yen for calm.”\n\nFishing with Dynamite\n\nCuisine: Seafood\n\nPrice: $55 lunch menu\n\nDown the block from the Pacific Ocean, you’ll think the team has literally come back from fishing (with dynamite, anyone?). Combined with beachy vibes and you'll never want to leave.\n\nInspector notes: “Raw bar dishes comprise half the menu, which lists different types of oysters, clams and lobsters that can be ordered as set platters or individually. The rest of the carte offers a selection of “old school” classics like gumbo, crab cakes and New England clam chowder revealing huge, meaty unshelled bivalves with chunks of bacon and potatoes. Adventurous palates will take pleasure in the “new school” fare—perhaps grilled octopus with saffron and chorizo, mahi mahi tacos or rockfish ceviche with persimmon. Desserts are well-portioned and genuinely desirable.”\n\nStay nearby:\n\nLocated just five minutes (and three blocks from the beach) away, the Shade Hotel, Manhattan Beach’s comfy goose down duvets and two-person spa tubs are the perfect way to cap off a delicious night. Designed by celebrity decorator Christopher Lowell, expect modern rooms infused with a variety of patterns, colors, and textures that are luxurious yet minimal.\n\nLaure Joliet/Fishing with Dynamite\n\nHotel 850 SVB\n\nMarina del Rey\n\nDear Jane's\n\nCuisine: American\n\nPrice: $35 lunch menu, $65 dinner menu\n\nIn case this Marina del Rey restaurant's glass wall with views of the boats outside didn't give it away, Dear Jane's celebrates the life aquatic with its focus on old school seafood and Continental cuisine. This spot pours it on with large portions and over-the-top flourishes (caviar makes a regular appearance) while keeping things grounded with strong cooking.\n\nInspector notes: \"Shrimp Louie, done tableside, is sized to share, as is the wedge, which brilliantly subs in vinaigrette in place of creamy dressing. Blackened salmon with a rich parsley and caper sauce is perfectly cooked, and lemony potatoes are a nice accompaniment.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nHotel Erwin\n\nVenice, and especially the funky old boardwalk, is no place for white-glove luxury, and the Erwin is suitably budget-conscious — though you’d never guess it from the décor, with its bold, cheery colors and its stylish modern furniture. The better rooms have sea views, but even the ones that look out over the town of Venice come with private balconies and HDTVs.\n\nArt Gray/Dear Jane's\n\nPasadena\n\nPerle\n\nCuisine: French\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nThis quaint French bistro feels right at home in downtown Pasadena. The cozy space draws in anybody walking by, thanks to vintage frames, sturdy Mahogany tables, and a coffered wood ceiling. Whereas many restaurants are content to merely look like a French bistro, in this one Chef Dean Yasharian has the chops to cook like one too.\n\nInspector notes: \"There is no need to reinvent the wheel and he knows it, carefully preparing such sleek, straight-shot Parisian classics as Burgundy snails glistening in herbed butter; silky-smooth pork pâté wrapped in pastry; and duck à l’orange with celery root purée. Dessert is essential: the airy Gran Marnier soufflé with crème fraîche ice cream and indulgent apple tarte Tartin are exactly the kind of sweet comforts worth returning for.\"\n\nAgnes Restaurant and Cheesery Cuisine: American\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu\n\nWith a cheese shop and bar in the front and an airy patio at the rear, this is Pasadena's haute, but not haughty hangout. During the day, cheese and charcuterie is served but at night you'll be met with fingerlicking dishes from the kitchen's grill.\n\nInspector notes: \"Cornbread eclair with chicken liver mousse is an easy decision, but choosing between the cavatelli with braised lamb and lamb fat gremolata or the half chicken with smoked jus is no small thing. The latter is brined, steamed, and charred over open flames until the skin is crisp as a chip. You probably won’t have room for dessert, but order the tres leches with corn pudding, anyway.\"\n\nFishwives\n\nCuisine: Seafood\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu, $55 dinner menu\n\nIn stark contrast to Old Pasadena’s commercialized shopping district sits this simple but alluring seafood bar. Inspired by New England cooking, diners can easily make a meal out of the raw menu alone, which features a roster of oysters, clams, lobster and shrimp. But cooked plates display just as much care and attention, as in the classic clam chowder or delicious market ceviche with ponzu vinaigrette.\n\nInspector notes: \"First-timers will want to head straight for the rolls—large brioche buns from La Brea Bakery arrive toasted, buttered and filled with Maine lobster, Dungeness crab or smoked trout with lemon mayo.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Paramour Estate has nine rooms making it intimate and with good reason. Dana Hollister's two decades as one of LA's top designers is on full display with each room as stylish as the next.\n\nThe Paramour Estate\n\nRob Stark/A.O.C.\n\nSanta Monica\n\nThe Lobster\n\nCuisine: Seafood\n\nPrice: $55 lunch menu, $65 dinner menu\n\nTrue to its name, this lovely perch overlooking the Santa Monica pier has earned its reputation for great American seafood, thanks to its focus on Maine lobsters and much more. Don’t let its beachy location lure you into thinking that this is a tourist trap. Tightly spaced tables don’t leave much room for privacy and the service seems focused on efficiency, but those expansive views and steaming seafood more than compensate.\n\nInspector notes: \"Lobsters arrive at the height of temptation—find them beautifully steamed until the meat is so incredibly tender, rendering that side of melted butter all but superfluous. Hearty seared crab cakes have a crisp exterior and are generously filled with meat, served alongside peppery arugula, fennel salad and remoulade.\"\n\nChinois On Main\n\nCuisine: Asian\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nA destination since 1983, this local darling has been welcoming guests as old friends to dine on their cuisine, which is a tad Asian, a touch Californian and a bit French. Little seems to have changed through the decades—it is busy, loud and served by an attentive staff. The location, amid boho-chic shops, remains a boon.\n\nInspector notes: \"This kitchen shines by way of a number of signature items, like made-to-order garlic chicken spring rolls or Cantonese duck with plum sauce.\"\n\nLunetta\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $35 lunch menu, $65 dinner menu\n\nBeneath a striped awning, this corner location is warm and elegant, with sleek leather banquettes, wood cabinetry and rustic woven chairs adorning the dark blue interior.\n\nInspector notes: \"Chef Raphael Lunetta helms the kitchen, delivering dishes that have their roots from his time at JiRaffe. Imagine the likes of thick slices of an enticingly browned pork chop with wild rice and bacon. The dinner menu is an au courant list of impressive cooking, including crispy duck with quince or wood-grilled barbecue salmon. For dessert, try the rich, dense and burnt-sugar butterscotch pot de crème served in a coffee cup with a dollop of whipped cream.\"\n\nColapasta\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/dinner menu\n\nWear a helmet, because this Bib Gourmand spot packs a delicious punch. Chefs Stefano De Lorenzo and Lazzaro Marco Ferrari craft an elegant Italian menu featuring a daily rotating soup, antipasti, and pasta that is handmade in front of you.\n\nInspector notes: “Favorites may include tender calamarata, tossed in a smooth and bright tomato sauce, dotted with oregano, creamy stracciatella and a drizzle of quality olive oil.”\n\nCitrin\n\nCuisine: Californian\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nFans of Californian cuisine will be right at home with this One Star. Known for combining French techniques with seasonal produce from California, chef Ken Takayama delivers on Josiah Citrin's updated classics with modern influences.\n\nInspector notes: “Spendthrifts will revel in the opulent caviar and truffle add-ons; but even without a dollop or shaving of luxury; the impressive cooking here, such as artichoke agnolotti with Comte and smoked barigoule is an indulgence, as is the Sonoma lamb loin with rosemary scented jus.”\n\nFia\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nA Santa Monica landmark dating back to the 20s, the onetime Wilshire has been reimagined with an Italian streak. It’s hard to imagine a more exquisitely Angeleno locale than this sprawling courtyard, encased by massive pine trees and illuminated by twinkling string lights.\n\nInspector notes: \"Fia's menu features organic produce from local farmers from no further than 50 miles away, and though it appears routine on the surface, it's full of inventive twists, as seen in the spicy tuna on crispy arancini, or the porcini tortellini with asparagus, spinach and pearl onion. Save room for the Amalfi lemon mousse cake with Limoncello granita and meringue.\"\n\nFia Steak\n\nCuisine: Steakhouse\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nSome places are just right for stopping in on a regular weeknight, and then there's Fia Steak. This no expense-spared spot is just right for getting dressed up and feeling festive, even if all you're celebrating is the end of the week.\n\nInspector notes: \"Seafood-focused starters kick things off—keep an eye out for specials like the Dungeness crab salad topped with a seafood panna cotta.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nCombine a 1920's Spanish Colonial building with updated contemporary interiors and what do you get? The Santa Monica Proper Hotel, a modern boutique hotel with high-luxury details (the Surya Ayurvedic Spa, yoga terrace, and rooftop pool, to name a few) and rooms decorated with works by local Los Angeles artists.\n\nYoshihiro Makino/Agnes\n\nWonho Frank Lee/Fia\n\nSilver Lake\n\nSpoon & Pork\n\nCuisine: Filipino\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/dinner menu\n\nThe neon pig hanging outside this comfort food spot signifies two things. The first is you've arrived at Spoon & Pork; the second is that you've stumbled upon delicious modern Filipino cuisine. Inside, a family-friendly vibe awaits with a menu loaded with different pork options.\n\nInspector notes: \"Adobo pork belly nigiri, a chorizo burger and a belly banh mi dabble with fusion, while dishes like lechon kawali stay in line with Filipino tradition. Come hungry for the patita—a hefty pork shank braised, then deep fried and smothered with a chili- vinegar- and garlic-sauce. Not a fan of pork? Order the staff favorite beef tapa with sirloin, garlic rice, eggs and pickled papaya.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nWith the help of talented designers Cayley Lambur and Lucia Bartholomew, the Silver Lake Pool & Inn has swapped out the old 1980's motel into a chic and welcoming modern-classic L.A. hotel. With influences from Palm Springs and Mexico City, the boutique-hotel is equipped with amenities like walk-in rain showers, Nespresso machines, and locally sourced snacks. Our favorite part? The elevated pool deck and coastal Italian cuisine from the hotel's restuarant, Marco Polo.\n\nAnd if you're here with a group, Alimento's Italian-influenced menu offers clean flavors designed for sharing.\n\nSpoon & Pork\n\nVenice\n\nCharcoal Venice\n\nCuisine: American\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nAt chef/owner Josiah Citrin's casual, upscale grill, the first thing guests are greeted by is the mouthwatering aroma of charred meat and a bustling bar area. The menu takes cues from old-school backyard barbecues, so expect nearly everything to be cooked over the fire.\n\nInspector notes: \"Steaks come with ramekins of sauce like creamy and smoky choron, in addition to the trio of signature condiments on the table. However, this meat is too flavorful to really need anything. Diners may be here for the steaks, but those in the know also order the cabbage baked in embers, served with lemon-sumac yogurt.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nSituated inside the century-old Waldorf Building, the Venice V Hotel is a tribute to Venice's artistic heritage. In the lobby is a mural of Venice's founder, Abbott Kinney, made from about 4,000 skateboard wheels; while the rooms are decorated in different styles and colors, each staying true Proper Hotel's expertise in tailor made boutique-hotels.\n\nCharcoal Venice\n\nWest Hollywood\n\nA.O.C.\n\nCuisine: Mediterranean\n\nPrice: $35 lunch menu, $65 dinner menu\n\nAs the name (an acronym for French wines’ regional certification) would suggest, this Mediterranean bijou lives up to its moniker with a floor-to-ceiling ensemble of Californian and European wines. The vibe is cozy, with rustic furniture, fireplaces, and a brick patio lined with olive trees.\n\nInspector notes: \"Diners may also treat themselves to cocktails that pair wonderfully with the consistently satisfying fare. The kitchen's focus on produce is clear in everything from a brunchtime beef cheesesteak sandwich with mushrooms and Comté, to tart marinated olives. Small plates is the order of the day, as in endive, smoked whitefish, and apple dressed with a kumquat-Meyer lemon cream or hanger steak with red wine-butter. Finish off with a strawberry-topped cream cheese tart.\"\n\nConnie & Ted's\n\nCuisine: Seafood\n\nPrice: $35 lunch menu, $55 dinner menu\n\nAt this seafood shack, guests experience the brilliant flavors of both coasts. Chef Michael Cimarusti's New England roots come out in a delectable menu featuring sustainable, wild-caught seafood from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nInspector notes: \"Chowder is a must for a seafood spot and this particular one offers a tempting flight of three: creamy New England, tomato-based Manhattan and buttery Rhode Island. The lobster roll, packed with tail and claw meat, is a gem among solo diners, while chilled seafood platters and the oak-grilled fish are great for crowds. Don’t forget to grab a bit of saltwater taffy on your way out.\"\n\nArdor\n\nCuisine: Californian\n\nPrice: $65 dinner menu\n\nIf a luxury spa ran a restaurant, it would probably look something like Ardor. Cushy white velvet and leather booths, white and beige staff uniforms, and enough verdant greenery to rival a small forest match the equally chic aesthetic at its parent venue, the West Hollywood EDITION hotel. The prices are high too, not that any hotel guests would even notice. But know that there is plenty of substance and care packed onto this vegetable-forward menu.\n\nInspector notes: \"Tandoor carrots with hummus and paprika vinaigrette or grilled dukkah-crusted ahi tuna with yogurt make for satisfying, clean eating.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe West Hollywood EDITION\n\nThe Edition hotels find one-time party king Ian Schrager in a more relaxed, mature mode, but the West Hollywood Edition is a reminder that “mellow Schrager” is, for most of us, still quite a party. Rooms are beautifully luxe and visually sparse, with views of the city or the Hollywood Hills; the British architect John Pawson brings an upscale gravity to modernist-friendly Southern California. It’s positioned, both literally and metaphorically, where the Sunset Strip meets Beverly Hills, and its restaurant, rooftop lounge, lobby bar, and subterranean nightclub suitably straddle the line between refinement and decadence, while the spa prepares you to do it all again the very next night.\n\nConnie & Ted's\n\nHero image: Redbird\n\nAd"
