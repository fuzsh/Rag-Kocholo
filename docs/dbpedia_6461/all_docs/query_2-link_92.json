        "text": "Those who have watched Hotel Del Luna must find Mystic Pop-up Bar‘s premise familiar. In fact, the two are similar in many aspects that it seems as if one concept were given to two different writers/PDs to develop — with different budgets: HDL is glitzy and trendy whereas MPUB is humble and pragmatic.\n\nIn both dramas, we have female leads from ancient Korea under centuries-long terms for the sins committed during their lives. But here, the wretched soul is appeasing the living instead of the dead. For the most part. They also had a sweet love story that ended tragically, causing endless sorrow and resentment. Despite the lower budget, the tent bar learns from the hotel’s mistakes, patches the holes, and delivers a more rounded and wholesome story.\n\nWol-joo (Park Si-eun) is a shaman’s daughter who’s able to solve troubles and cure people through reading their dreams. Her reputation eventually reaches the palace, into which she is summoned to tend to the crown prince Yi Hon (Song Geon-hee). She manages to heal him but also win his heart, and the latter doesn’t sit well with the queen (Park Eun-hye). Before long, her mother senses danger coming their way and sends her away; that very night, she is killed and their house is burned down. Wol-joo who is still near enough the village spots the fire and returns to find her mom dressed as her dead.\n\nDistraught, she curses at the royal family then hangs herself on The Sacred Tree, bringing it down with her. As a result, Joseon is invaded and 100,000 people die in the ensuing war. To pay for this grave sin, Wol-joo is sentenced to appease 100,000 grudges, which she readily refuses. She hates humans so much that she’d rather be sent to Hell of Extinction instead, until Queen Yeomra (Yeom Hye-ran) tells her another fatal sin of hers. What it was is only revealed later in the drama, but it’s very effective in making her yield.\n\nThe next scene we see her, Wol-joo (now played by Hwang Jung-eum) is running a pop-up tent bar, trying to get people to confide their worries, then settling those qualified as grudges by entering their dream world. Helping her in the shop is Gwi-banjang (Choi Won-young). We don’t know how long he’s joined her in her extended 500-year term, but we do know that he was the chief underworld detective before being transferred there. Going from catching evil spirits to peeling onions does look like a huge demotion, and he sometimes grumbles about it, though he’s likely to be reinstated once Wol-joo fulfill her quota.\n\nThey’re only 10 grudges away from the goal yet haven’t made any progress in six months. Deemed to be slacking off, she is given one month to finish her task. And seemingly helped by the heavens, she chances upon a guy who makes people spill their guts through physical touch: Han Kang-bae (Yook Sung-jae). It may be a gift, though for him it’s a curse preventing him from building close, long-term relations with other people.\n\nA team-up between them is thus a win-win solution for all: Kang-bae will bring in people with grudges to resolve, Wol-joo will then close his spiritual vision so he can live normally. She’s happy, he’s happy, everybody’s happy.\n\nThat’s how three grudges are settled in three episodes. But it’ll be boring if all cases are approached in similar fashion, and Mystic has all the tricks and ideas to fish for customers in fresh ways that the proceeding is hardly boring. It also means that in the end, completing the chore doesn’t really hinge on Kang-bae’s power, which i didn’t mind since i was thoroughly enjoying the trio’s dynamics since their first escapade into the the dream world together. Their personalities are so different yet they mesh so well together; they bond almost instantly and their camaraderie grows organically they end up looking like one warm makeshift family instead of business fellows.\n\nWol-joo is painted to be temperamental, though i don’t think so. Her personality does change from her Joseon self (she’s become louder and rather impatient when digging for more info from potential customers) but her fashion style doesn’t (she’s still dressed in modern hanboks, which look great). And despite her hatred of humans claim, she isn’t antagonistic to her patrons and is actually quite sympathetic to their issues, particularly those pertaining to families. She also looks after Kang-bae even if she scouted him for her own gain: cooking for him when he falls sick, taking an overnight trip to acquire pure salt to repel spirits he starts seeing, and even giving up her reincarnation shot in lieu of a heavenly secret to ‘cure’ him.\n\nAnd this is before she knows what their (past) relation is.\n\n[Spoilers ahead]\n\nI thought Kang-bae is the reincarnation of the crown prince due to some signs — he holds her hand in the same way Yi Hon did, he is the one Wol-joo’s desperately seeking — also because Kim Won-young (Na In-woo) breaks out from hell to take his revenge on his former friend not long after he starts part-timing at the bar. But when Show teased us that it was a toss-up between him and Manager Gwi, i knew it was the latter instead. And that Kang-bae is her/their son.\n\nAnd that’s also the reason she accepted the punishment. I had a feeling it wouldn’t be because of her man, and that her mom, whose death pushed her over the edge, was a more logical one. Never did i cross my mind that it was her unborn baby, and the curse her suicide inflicted on its soul — because the romance between the crown prince and the shaman daughter seems short-lived and innocent.\n\nThe more shocking twist is the fact that Kang-bae is the reincarnation of The Sacred Tree too. It should’ve been obvious given his superpower that gets people to pour their hearts out, but boy did the reveal give me chills. The embodiment is a throwback to his Goblin moment, and Sung-jae playing a deity is probably my favorite Sung-jae’s performance (besides Gong Tae, obviously, who still pinches my heart whenever i think about him).\n\nWhat eventually stands between Wol-joo and the finish line isn’t the grudges counter but Won-young. Though honestly, i don’t get what his deal is. Or how he’ll exact his revenge. I mean, they’re all dead by now; unless spirits can be killed again and hence gone forever. But then he says he isn’t after Wol-joo, yet not making a move until the last episode. And despite being a formidable evil spirit, he is still no match for Gwi-banjang in the Living Realm, neither is he for Wol-joo in the Dream Realm, resulting in a rather anticlimactic face-off.\n\nAlso, i wonder how he’s able to recognize adult Yi Hon right away when not even Wol-joo who’s been working with him for a couple hundred years (i suppose) can, how come he doesn’t ‘age’ like the other two, or why he didn’t take Wol-joo out back then, after realizing he killed the wrong person and then running into his intended target.\n\nNevertheless, the ending is actually better than expected. While i didn’t doubt that it would be a happy one, i thought it would be in the next lifetime where they’re all reborn. So to have the trio together for longer in this lifetime is a pleasant surprise, despite the too-good-to-be-true nature. Like, Wol-joo signed a quid-pro-quo agreement, which Gwi-banjang subsequently took over, but she eventually failed to meet the quota by the deadline, and yet the heavens are lenient enough to still give her a pass, counting her final sacrifice toward her lot and overruling Gwi’s extinction takeover. Not to mention gracious enough to let her choose how she’ll spend her post-punishment days and forgo reincarnation.\n\nThat said, making the hundred thousandth case Wol-joo’s long-standing regret, wish, and goal instead of The Sacred Tree’s or the main villain’s is not only unexpected but also poignant. It was a nice closure and ending to her 500-year quest.\n\nDespite some minor holes and continuity issues in the final week, Mystic offers a pleasant and enjoyable watch from start to finish. The main characters have their own charms and collective chemistry; side characters are fun and sympathetic (if a bit too comical for the role, like Queen Yeomra); the plot has a good flow; grudges of the day are engaging, making me cry a lot, and well-acted in general. It isn’t as mystic yet warmer than the title suggests.\n\nThe one i find quite random is Kang Yeo-rin (Jung Da-eun) developing into Kang-bae’s love interest. His power doesn’t work on her, which turns out because she’s also gifted in addition to a reincarnation of a sacred object too. That should make them an interesting pair who cancels each other’s powers out, but their love line didn’t excite me. It doesn’t help that her acting is on the weak side.\n\nAnother thing that the writer might have missed out is Wol-joo’s mom. I was hoping she would meet her again, reincarnation or not, and was sad that she didn’t.\n\nIf i can nitpick another thing, is how non-surreal the afterlife is. Except the judgment hall, everything else looks like typical plain office setting, which takes away the fantasy elements of the show. I wish they invested more in those, the way they did on the CGs. Oh well, story and acting matter more and Mystic Pop-up Bar did well in those fronts, so i shouldn’t fuss over these details, but they eventually knock he drama’s overall quality down a notch or two."
