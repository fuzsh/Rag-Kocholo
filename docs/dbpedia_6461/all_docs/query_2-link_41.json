        "text": "It was a night to remember for the 2024 Golden Globes' best supporting actress on television: Elizabeth Debicki.\n\n\"Thank you so much! Thank you to the creatives of this show for trusting me with this part,\" The Crown actress shared after winning the award. \"To cast and crew, to my beautiful pretend children who I just adore, to my mom and my dad… My partner Kristian who said don't thank me so that I'm not on television but I'm gonna thank you anyway. Who else? Goodness, maybe that’s it.\"\n\n\"This is just astonishing to me… I just want to say thank you to my beloved and dear Godmother who left us too quickly, too soon,\" she added. \"This one is for you, baby.”\n\nDebicki, 33, portrayed Princess Diana on the final two seasons of The Crown, which focused on the royal’s final days before her fatal car crash in August 1997.\n\nThe actress told PEOPLE that the weight of playing Diana for the Netflix series was not lost on her, sharing, “I did a lot of research for this role. I probably spent about a year doing research and that just filled in all these pieces and made me have such deep, deep respect and love for this person who I didn't know so much about.”\n\nShe continued, “The battle that she went through in terms of media, public perception. I didn't know things about the divorce and how difficult all of that was for everybody in the family.”\n\nThe Crown was nominated for four awards at Sunday’s Golden Globes. Debicki was previously nominated for best supporting actress in a television series – drama at last year’s Globes. She is also up for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series at next week’s Emmy Awards.\n\nAbby Elliott (The Bear), Christina Ricci (Yellowjackets), J. Smith-Cameron (Succession), Meryl Streep (Only Murders in the Building) and Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso) were also up for the coveted prize.\n\nElliott stars as Natalie “Sugar” Berzatto, the doting older sister of chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), on The Bear.\n\nDespite having a bit of a complicated on-screen relationship, Elliott previously told PEOPLE that she and Allen have a tight bond, saying, “I really feel like Jeremy could be my brother in real life.\"\n\n“I adore him,” she shared. “I showed a picture of my grandfather when my grandfather was younger to Jeremy, and they look so similar, it's eerie almost. And he showed me a picture of his sister and was like, ‘You guys look alike.’”\n\nThe Bear scored five nominations at this year’s Golden Globes including a nod for White.\n\nFor Yellowjackets season 2, Ricci returned to play adult plane crash survivor Misty.\n\nThe 43-year-old actress opened up about playing the quirky character in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, saying, “ I find her entertaining. I like watching her. She’s not someone I would want to know in real life. I feel like I understand her, and I think once you understand a person, all their behavior is justified. I’m not an actor who feels that I have to like the character I’m playing in order to play them.”\n\nShe was also nominated for her role on the Showtime thriller for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series at last year’s Emmy Awards.\n\nOn Succession’s final season, Smith-Cameron, 66, starred as Waystar Royco's corporate counsel Gerri Kellman opposite Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin).\n\nDespite their characters' on-screen tensions, Smith-Cameron has spoken about her friendship with Culkin, telling Esquire in March, \"We were kind of always flirting on set.\n\nShe added: \"It was never for one second a real flirtation. It was that set-crush kind of thing.\"\n\nThe drama series' final season scored the most television nominations with nine total at Sunday’s Golden Globes.\n\nStreep joined the third season of Only Murders in the Building as Loretta Durkin opposite protagonists Mabel Mora (Selena Gomez), Charles-Haden Savage (Steve Martin) and Oliver Putnam's (Martin Short).\n\nShort recalled during a For Your Consideration event in Los Angeles last month that he and Streep, 74, felt nervous on set before their first scene.\n\n“I’ve known Meryl a little bit through the years but on the first day of shooting, I was a little unusually nervous for me, because I was thinking, ‘I’m doing a two-person scene with Meryl Streep,'” he said, per The Hollywood Reporter. After shooting the scene, he recalled, “Meryl said to me, ‘OK, so my nerves are now down to half.’ So I guess she was nervous working with me.”\n\nStreep sets the record as the most-nominated actor of all time when with her Only Murders in the Building nomination, her 34th nod. If she had taken home the prize, she would have tied the all-time record for the most wins by an individual (10), which is currently held by Barbra Streisand, and extend her own record as the individual with most wins for acting with a total of nine.\n\nIn the third season of Ted Lasso, Waddingham, 49, returned to play Rebecca Welton, the owner of AFC Richmond, opposite Ted Lasso (Jason Sudeikis).\n\nThe actress opened up about playing a woman who is starting fresh after a divorce, telling Harper's Bazaar in May, “I've cared so deeply how that demographic is portrayed, and how people find themselves in life, newly divorced and trying to find their way, so that will be a very strange thing for me to not be speaking on her behalf anymore.”\n\nTed Lasso is also up for best television series - musical or comedy, and Sudeikis scored an individual nod for best performance by a male TV comedy actor.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories."
