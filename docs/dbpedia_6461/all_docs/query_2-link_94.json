        "text": "The heir to the throne also clarified why his wife, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, didn't go to the Olympics as planned\n\nCrown Prince Haakon of Norway is commenting on the arrest of his stepson, Marius Borg Høiby.\n\nOn Aug. 6, Crown Prince Haakon, 51, addressed the Norwegian press for the first time following Marius' reported arrest in Oslo over the weekend, allegedly connected to an incident involving a woman in her 20s. Marius, 27, is Crown Princess Mette-Marit's son from a previous relationship before she married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001.\n\n\"It is a serious matter when the police are involved in the way they are, but at the same time, it is not right for me to go into the details of the case,\" Crown Prince Haakon told reporters, according to theDaily Express.\n\nThe royal was in Paris for the Summer Olympics, and he added that Crown Princess Mette-Marit, 50, stayed home despite being originally scheduled to join him in France.\n\n\"In our family, as in all families, it is sometimes important to be there. This time it was me who went while she stayed at home,\" Crown Prince Haakon said, according to the outlet.\n\nRelated: Meet Norway's Royal Family: All About the 1,000-Year-Old Monarchy\n\nCrown Prince Haakon continued with the trip to the Olympic Games without his wife, first stepping out at the sporting competition on Aug. 6, where he watched an equestrian final and sat with Prince Albert of Monaco and Princess Alexandra of Hanover at another event.\n\nWhile Crown Princess Mette-Marit hasn't been photographed at the Olympics yet, Norwegian outlet Se og Hørreported on Aug. 6 that she still hopes to go.\n\nSe og Hør reported that Marius was arrested and detained for 30 hours on Aug. 4 after being accused that he had \"attacked\" a woman at an apartment building in Oslo. The woman was reportedly treated at a hospital for a concussion, according to the outlet.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the Associated Press reported that Marius faces preliminary charges of bodily harm and criminal damage, citing the Oslo police.\n\nPolice added there was \"a relationship between the suspect and the victim\" but said they \"currently do not have information that the victim has suffered serious injuries,\" the AP reported.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

In 2017, a few days before his 20th birthday, the Royal House of Norway announced that he was leaving public life and enrolling in college in California.\n\nAfter the news was announced, Mette-Marit penned an open letter asking the press to respect his decision.\n\n\"Marius has always had a role that has been difficult to define in the public sphere. He is and will be an exceptionally important part of our family. Marius became a symbol of the unusual choice we made when we got married, at the same time, he will not carry public duties like his siblings,\" she wrote in 2020. \"He should not have a public role and is not a public figure.\"\n\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit and Crown Prince Haakon are also parents to Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 20, who follows her father in the line of succession to the throne, and Prince Sverre Magnus, 18.\n\nMarius joined the royals at his sister's banner birthday celebrations when she turned 18 in 2022.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
