Ending with a clip of Martin Luther King Jr. was a nice touch. Good night!\n\nThe real winner was my digital antenna (since streaming this show usually means delays).\n\nI think it was clear from the awards show that the people who made it actually love TV. Maybe that's the key to any awards show's success.\n\nEmmys conclude with brief MLK tribute\n\nAnderson wrapped the 75th Emmys by paying tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. Tonight’s show falls on the national holiday dedicated to him.\n\nKing’s iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech played as the credits ran at 11 p.m. ET on the dot.\n\n'Succession' wins Emmy for best drama series\n\nNo big surprise: \"Succession\" has won the Emmy for best drama series. The final season of the era-defining, foul-mouthed corporate satire dominated the drama categories tonight, nabbing six Emmys total.\n\nThe tally: best drama series, best actress in a drama series (Sarah Snook), best actor in a drama series (Kieran Culkin), best supporting actor in a drama series (Matthew Macfadyen), best drama series direction (Mark Mylod) and best drama series writing (Jesse Armstrong).\n\nCelebrity sighting: The Iron Throne is in the house\n\nPeter Dinklage presented the final award of the night — coming on after Anthony Anderson revealed the Iron Throne from \"Game of Thrones\" was onstage.\n\n'The Bear' wins best comedy at the Emmys\n\n\"The Bear\" continued its winning streak, nabbing its sixth win of the night for best comedy series.\n\nIt lived up to expectations set this month at the Golden Globes, where it earned the same award.\n\nReminder: This win is actually for season 1 of the beloved 30-minute \"comedy\" that's really more like a drama, as the Emmys are being held four months late and honoring shows that aired from June 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023.\n\nEarlier in the evening, Ayo Edebiri won for best supporting actress, Ebon Moss-Bachrach for supporting actor and Jeremy Allen White for lead actor.\n\nChristopher Storer took home awards for writing and directing in a comedy series, too.\n\nNothing like a kiss to celebrate a win.\n\nThat's right: Matty Matheson, who plays Neil Fak, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who plays Richie, were so thrilled they shared a smooch on stage.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross and Natasha Lyonne pay tribute to 'I Love Lucy'\n\nTracee Ellis Ross and Natasha Lyonne re-created the iconic candy factory scene from \"I Love Lucy\" in a tribute to the classic comedy.\n\nIn case you missed the category they were announcing because of the mouthfuls of chocolate, they were on to present outstanding comedy series.\n\nSarah Snook wins best actress in a drama series for ‘Succession’\n\nShiv Roy fans got their redemption today.\n\nSarah Snook’s performance in “Succession” won her the Emmy for best actress in a drama series. Before her win tonight, she had been nominated for three Emmys and won two Golden Globes.\n\nShiv was the only girl in a perpetual boys' club, and her acerbic banter with her brothers and ruthless takedowns of her husband became highlights of the stacked show.\n\n'Ally McBeal' cast reunites for a toilet tribute\n\nIt took the live blogging team a minute to figure out what the delightful toilet sketch was all about when we returned from the commercial break. Turns out it was the \"Ally McBeal\" cast here to introduce Kieran Culkin's \"Succession\" win.\n\nKieran Culkin wins Emmy for best drama series actor for 'Succession'\n\nKieran Culkin has won the Emmy for his performance as the troubled corporate scion Roman Roy on \"Succession.\" He beat out castmates Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong. (Cox gave Culkin a kiss and a hug.)\n\nCulkin appeared emotional as he accepted the award and capped off his speech by telling his wife that he wants more kids.\n\nHe won the equivalent award at the Golden Globes this month and at the Critics Choice Awards last night.\n\nLoved seeing Brian Cox (who played patriarch Logan Roy) kiss Kieran on his way up to accept the award.\n\nDaddy's seal of approval.\n\nIn Memoriam segment honors Matthew Perry\n\nMatthew Perry, the late star of “Friends,” was among those honored during the Emmys In Memoriam segment.\n\nThe iconic theme song from the hit sitcom played as Perry's name flashed on the screen.

There's no doubt in my mind they’ll win in the future. But tonight goes to \"Succession.\"\n\nElton John is an EGOT winner\n\nThe iconic singer just won the E in EGOT!\n\n\"Elton John Live: Farewell from Dodger Stadium\" won the Emmy for outstanding variety special (live).\n\nJohn had previously won two Oscars (for best original song for “Rocketman’s “[“I’m Gonna] Love Me Again” and The Lion King’s “Can You Feel The Love Tonight\"), one Tony (for best original score for “Aida) and six GRAMMY Awards (including the GRAMMY Legend Award).\n\nTina Fey and Amy Poehler reunite at the 'Weekend Update' desk\n\nIn a mock \"Weekend Update\" episode, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler creatively presented the award for best live variety special.\n\nThe pair are on their comedy tour — which clearly was not on break tonight.\n\nFey joked that they have finally reached the age at which they will present awards only sitting down.\n\nStill wondering why Hollywood doesn't tap them to co-host everything every year.\n\n'Succession' wins Emmy for drama series direction, third of the night for the series\n\nMark Mylod, who directed the standout episode \"Connor's Wedding,\" accepted the award — the third win for \"Succession\" tonight.\n\nFun fact: Mylod also directed the Anya Taylor-Joy horror film \"The Menu.\"\n\nLee Sung Jin wins best writing in a limited series or movie for 'Beef'\n\nLee Sung Jin scored his second win tonight for “Beef,\" this time taking home the statuette for best writing in a limited series or movie.\n\n“We wrote this on Zoom,” Jin said in his acceptance speech. “This is crazy. Thank you.”\n\n'Succession' triumphs in drama writing race\n\n\"Succession\" co-creator Jesse Armstrong won the Emmy for writing the episode \"Connor's Wedding,\" the one where ***** dies.\n\nArmstrong has won an Emmy for every season of “Succession,” giving him a perfect record at this ceremony.\n\nIf you weren’t on social media the night that “Connor’s Wedding” premiered, you missed out on one of the most memorable nights on the internet.\n\nDon Draper hath risen\n\nJon Hamm is onstage to pay tribute to \"Mad Men,\" the seminal advertising world drama that was nominated for a staggering 116 (!) Emmy nominations.\n\nHe also presented the Emmy to \"Succession\" mastermind Jesse Armstrong for outstanding writing for a drama series.\n\nPaul Walter Hauser wins best supporting actor for 'Black Bird' role\n\nPaul Walter Hauser won best supporting actor in a limited series for his work in “Black Bird.”\n\nThis is his first Emmy win.\n\n“Thank you, Mom and Dad — you nurtured what you had in me,” he said.\n\nCode blue for OG 'Grey's Anatomy' fans\n\n\"Grey's Anatomy\" is still on, but it's been on so long that it still makes us nostalgic. (It premiered when I was in kindergarten.)\n\nThe cast of \"Grey’s Anatomy,\" now the longest running prime-time drama in TV history, reunited to present the award for best supporting actor in a limited or anthology series.\n\n\"Yes, there have been some changes,\" joked Katherine Heigl, who left the show in 2010.\n\nLee Sung Jin wins outstanding directing in a limited series for 'Beef'\n\nLee Sung Jin won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a limited or anthology series or movie. Two episodes of the show were nominated in the same category.\n\n\"Beef\" has been on a winning streak since the Golden Globes.\n\nThe upset I'd love to see tonight: Bob Odenkirk for 'Better Call Saul'\n\nI know the brilliant final season \"Succession\" is almost certainly going to sweep the drama categories, but I'd be thrilled if \"Better Call Saul\" star Bob Odenkirk pulled off a surprise win in the lead actor race. (Realistically, Kieran Culkin will win in that category.)\n\n'The Daily Show with Trevor Noah' wins Emmy for best talk series\n\n'The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\" just won the Emmy for best talk series. Noah, whose last episode as host was in December 2022, accepted the award on behalf of the Comedy Central franchise.\n\nHe joked about John Oliver's dominance in the late-night genre before the HBO host was moved to the scripted variety series category.\n\n'It's Always Sunny' star Glenn Howerton is on the stage ...\n\n... and that reminds me: I hope he's nominated for an Oscar this month for his supporting role in \"BlackBerry.\" He's great!\n\nJohn Oliver's show wins second Emmy of the night\n\nThe team from HBO's \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" just won its second award of the evening, for variety series writing.\n\nRuPaul says ‘listen to a drag queen’ while accepting win\n\nIt may be the fifth time \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" wins an Emmy for best reality competition program, but we don't get tired of it.\n\nRuPaul Charles praised drag queens during his speech and referred to the political pushback toward drag queen story hours at some public libraries across the country.\n\n\"If a drag queen wants to read you a story at a library, listen to her, because knowledge is power,\" Charles said. \"And if someone tries to restrict your access to power, they are trying to scare you. So listen to a drag queen.”\n\nWe’re barely one hour into the show and there have already been a few notable political comments from winners and presenters. Interesting after last week’s Golden Globes, where barely anyone said anything topical (or controversial).\n\nChristopher Storer scores back-to-back wins for ‘The Bear’\n\nChristopher Storer secured the fourth and fifth wins of the night for \"The Bear.\"\n\nHe took home the Emmy awards for outstanding writing and directing for a comedy series.\n\nStorer was not at the show tonight, making for speedy acceptances.\n\nThe night has been filled with reminders that I really need to start watching “The Bear.” I already felt guilty and out of the loop after the Golden Globes, and this telecast is going to put me over the edge.\n\nIt's a 'Cheers' reunion, folks!\n\nTed Danson, Kelsey Grammer, John Ratzenberger, Rhea Perlman and George Wendt are on hand to present the award for comedy series direction and comedy series writing.\n\nNiecy Nash-Betts dedicates win to Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland\n\nNiecy Nash-Betts, who won the Emmy for best supporting actress in a limited series or movie for “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,\" gave a powerful and emotional acceptance speech.\n\n\"I wanna thank me for believing in me and doing what I was told I could not do,\" Nash-Betts said.\n\nShe went on to say she accepts the award \"on behalf of every Black and brown woman who has gone unheard yet over-policed — like Glenda Cleveland, like Sandra Bland, like Breonna Taylor.

Maybe we should have rescinded his Emmy.\n\nThe 'Martin' show cast reunites and pokes fun at Emmys\n\nMartin Lawrence and other members of the \"Martin\" show cast reunited on the Emmys stage to present the award for best actor in a comedy series.\n\nWith the help of Emmys host Anthony Anderson, the actors of the iconic '90s show poked fun at being invited to present the award despite never receiving any Emmy nominations.\n\nThe show aired for five seasons, from 1992 to 1997.\n\nJeremy Allen White wins Emmy for best actor in a comedy series for 'The Bear'\n\nJeremy Allen White has won the Emmy for his lead role on FX's \"The Bear,\" giving the acclaimed show its third win of the night.\n\nWhite won the equivalent award at the Golden Globes last week.

Another big win for \"The Bear,\" which also swept at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards.\n\nThere's a football game on right now, too ...\n\nRob McElhenney is every football fan at the Emmys right now.\n\nThe actor behind \"Welcome to Wrexham\" posted on X from the show that he's streaming the game on his phone while at the awards.\n\n\"Who schedules the Emmys the same night as the @eagles #gobirds #FlyEaglesFly,\" he wrote.\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach wins best supporting actor in a comedy for 'The Bear'\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach is taking home the award for best supporting actor in a comedy for his role as Richie on \"The Bear.\"\n\nThis is the comedy's second win of the night.

The comment was bleeped on the broadcast, but the audience seemed to be laughing.\n\nCulkin last week told Pascal to \"suck it\" at the Golden Globes after beating him for best actor in a drama series.\n\nPascal, who has also been appearing on awards red carpets with a sling, said people keep asking him what happened to his arm. \"It's actually my shoulder,\" he joked.\n\nThe vibes are good so far\n\nAnthony Anderson's opening number got a positive response, the crowd seems genuinely happy to be in the room, and the homages to the television landmarks of the past have been heartfelt.\n\nMama Anderson is stealing the show\n\nThe bit with Anthony Anderson's mom is working.\n\n\"I love you baby but time!\" she yelled to Jennifer Coolidge, who was the first to go over time in her acceptance speech for best supporting actress in a drama.\n\nCoolidge begged to say just one more thing, but Mama Anderson held strong, interrupting her to remind her there is a show to keep running.\n\nIf not overused, Mama Anderson could continue to be a cute and funny bit throughout the night.\n\nMatthew MacFadyen wins for best supporting actor in a drama series for 'Succession'\n\nTom won the top position at the end of \"Succession,\" and he also won the Emmy for best supporting actor in a drama.\n\nHe thanked his two on-screen wives, Sarah Snook and Nicholas Braun, as well as his own wife, Keely.\n\nThe first of what’s sure to be many wins for “Succession” tonight.\n\nJennifer Coolidge wins best supporting actress in a drama series for 'The White Lotus'\n\nCoolidge won her second Emmy for her role in \"The White Lotus.\"\n\n\"I want to thank all the evil gays,\" Coolidge said in her acceptance speech, alluding to a viral line from the show: \"These gays, they're trying to murder me.\"\n\n'The Sopranos' cast members reunite on stage\n\nLorraine Bracco and Michael Imperioli reunited to honor the 25th anniversary of \"The Sopranos,\" reviving the iconic therapist's office of Bracco's character, Dr. Melfi.\n\nQuinta Brunson wins lead actress in a comedy for 'Abbott Elementary'\n\nThe second Emmy of the night goes to Quinta Brunson for her lead role as a teacher on the ABC sitcom \"Abbott Elementary.\"\n\nBrunson started crying when she accepted the award from Carol Burnett and told the crowd she felt honored to live her dream in comedy.\n\nQuinta acting surprised, like girl everyone knew she was gonna win!\n\nFun seeing the back to back bestie wins! Ayo, who had a guest role in \"Abbott Elementary,\" and Quinta are pals. They also attended the Beyonce concert together.\n\nAyo Edebiri wins the Emmy for best supporting actress in a comedy\n\nAyo Edebiri took home the first win of the night for her role as Sydney in \"The Bear.\" This marks the first of likely many wins for the comedy tonight.\n\nFresh off her Golden Globe win in the same category, Edebiri thanked her parents profusely for \"making me feel beautiful and Black and all of that,\" even thought she said she is \"making them sit kind of far away from me because I'm a bad kid.\"\n\n\"It's probably not a dream to come to this country and have your child say 'I want to do improv,'\" Edebiri joked.\n\nEmmys audience gives standing ovation to Christina Applegate\n\nThe crowd inside the Peacock Theater rose to its feet for the first presenter of the night: Christina Applegate, the \"Married... with Children\" and \"Dead to Me\" star who announced she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2021.\n\nApplegate, who walked to the stage with a cane, appeared visibly moved by the standing ovation.\n\nAnthony Anderson's mother tells him to 'shut up'\n\nAnthony Anderson's mom and our newest icon, Doris Hancox, told him to \"shut up\" during his opening monologue because she wants \"to go to the after parties.\"\n\n\"The time's up, baby,\" she shouted.\n\nAnthony Anderson opens show with nostalgia and laughs\n\nAnthony Anderson opened the Emmys with a nostalgic reference to Mr. Rogers. In this opening, the actor honed in on how pivotal family TV shows were in his life.\n\n“I love television and tonight we celebrate 75 years of Emmys. We’re going to commemorate the greatest shows of today while playing tribute to iconic series that mean so much to us,” he said. “Simply put it television has shaped the world and more importantly it has shaped me.”\n\nAlongside a gospel choir, Anderson paid homage to \"Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,\" \"Good Times\" \"Facts of Life\" and \"Miami Vice.\"\n\nThat's why Travis Barker is at the Emmys!\n\nNo, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker isn't at the Emmys because \"The Kardashians\" is nominated.\n\nHe got a special feature in host Anthony Anderson's opening monologue — playing drums on Phil Collins' \"In the Air Tonight\" in a tribute to \"Miami Vice.\"\n\nBarker looked cool as ever rocking out in a cut-off tank top.\n\nAnthony Anderson kicks off the show\n\nAnd we're live!\n\nSome of the nominated shows feel like they debuted forever ago\n\nSeeing Kumail Nanjiani, nominated for lead actor in a limited or anthology series or movie for \"Welcome to Chippendales,\" on the carpet reminded me of the show's existence.\n\nI say that not as a jab at the show. In fact, it's not the show's fault — the Emmys were delayed by four months. So some of these nominees feel like they debuted forever ago.\n\n\"Chippendales,\" a limited series, debuted on Hulu on Nov. 22, 2022.\n\nOther shows I kind of forgot about: \"Daisy Jones & the Six\" (debuted on Amazon in March 2023) and \"Swarm\" (also debuted on Amazon in March 2023).\n\nThe red carpet looks have kind of underwhelmed us\n\nSo far, there have been a lot of great looks but nothing that has taken the NBC News live blog team's collective breath away.\n\nI feel like everyone is keeping it tame. There are some gorgeous classic looks but nothing crazy.\n\nMost of the looks feel like kind of weak takes on 2023 TikTok trends: bows, girlhood, pink/red.\n\nA lot of beautiful gowns but not many showstoppers.\n\nI wonder whether since a lot of these people were at Globes last week and the Critics Choice Awards last night, they just kept it lower-maintenance for the Emmys.\n\nThe 'Abbott Elementary' cast is ready to party\n\nOn the red carpet tonight, \"Abbott Elementary\" star Tyler James Williams told E! News he took co-star Janelle James car shopping so she could pull up to filming of season 2 in style.\n\nWilliams also said their bosses gave them the day off tomorrow, so \"'Abbott Elementary' may get wild\" at the Emmys afterparty tonight.\n\nThe show returns to ABC on Sunday, March 10, after the Oscars.\n\nMeghann Fahy represents 'The White Lotus' on the red carpet\n\nMeghann Fahy appears to be the first \"The White Lotus\" star to grace the red carpet.

The youngest was Patty Duke, who was 17 in 1964, when she was nominated in the category for \"The Patty Duke Show.\"\n\nOrtega also spilled some tea about \"Wednesday's\" upcoming second season, which she will be starring in and producing.\n\n\"I've received some scripts,\" she said, adding that the new season will be more gory and more action-packed. \"Each episode will feel like a movie.\"\n\nDaniel Radcliffe loved playing 'unhinged' version of Weird Al\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, who is nominated for lead actor in a limited or anthology series or movie for \"Weird: The Al Yankovic Story,\" told E! that he loved playing a \"strange\" and \"unhinged\" version of the musician in the satirical film.\n\nBut it wasn't Yankovic's opinion he was worried about.\n\n\"Honestly the people whose opinions I cared most about with the movie were my in-laws,\" he said. \"They are huge Weird Al fans ... they were happy, thank God.\"\n\nRead more in NBC's interview with Radcliffe from November 2022.\n\nKatherine Heigel is reuniting with the 'Grey's Anatomy' cast\n\nThe cast of \"Grey's Anatomy\" is slated to reunite on the Emmys' stage tonight and one of the show's former stars, Katherine Heigel, who played Izzie Stevens for six seasons, said it was \"crazy\" to reunite with her former co-stars after leaving the show 15 years ago.\n\n\"It's crazy. It's like in one way it feels like I just saw them all and in another it's like all this life has passed,\" Heigel said. \"Our children have all gotten older.\"\n\nShe recalled how show creator Shonda Rhimes' son was born during the second season of \"Grey's\" and is now 18 years old.\n\n\"It's disconcerting but wonderful,\" Heigel said.\n\nAnother 'Breaking Bad' spinoff? Giancarlo Esposito is down\n\nGiancarlo Esposito, known for his role as Gus Fring in the AMC crime drama series \"Breaking Bad\" and prequel \"Better Call Saul,\" told Variety on the Emmys carpet that he's ready for another spinoff.\n\n\"I think eventually there should be and there might be,\" he said. His hope? \"The Rise of Gus.\"\n\nAli Wong, nominated for 'Beef,' has had real-life beef\n\nWhile discussing her Emmy nomination for lead actress in a limited or anthology series or movie for \"Beef,\" Ali Wong asked, \"Who among us\" hasn't had their own real-world beef?\n\n“Of course I have. It never escalated to the point that it did in the show but yeah for sure. I’m human. I’ve definitely had a beef or two or seven,\" Wong joked.\n\nWong recently won a Golden Globe for her performance in \"Beef.\"\n\nAli Wong is all of us.\n\nAnthony Anderson's mother says he's excited to host\n\nHost Anthony Anderson's mom, Doris Bowman, arrived at the red carpet to support her son.\n\nIn a red carpet interview with The Root, Bowman said Anderson had always wanted to host the Emmys. She said he was calm and excited to take on the role tonight.\n\nAnderson previously revealed that his mom will play a special role during the show. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, he said Bowman will help get winners off the stage if they prolong their acceptance speeches.\n\n\"... I’m letting people know there will be no play-off music,\" he said. \"My mother will be your play-off music. So, please, be respectful. Get up here. Thank your god. Thank your agents, and everybody just make the stage in a timely fashion.”\n\nEmmys producer Jesse Collins described Bowman as “Play-off mama.\"\n\nKieran Culkin says he still hasn't seen the final episode of 'Succession'\n\nKieran Culkin explained that as the final episode of \"Succession\" aired, he was jetting off to Poland on another shoot and couldn't log into his HBO account — so he couldn't watch the conclusion of the show. Then he went on vacation.\n\nApparently, he still hasn't found time to watch the show's finale.\n\n\"I was there. I shot it, so I vaguely recall — although I saw a clip of a scene yesterday and I was laughing and I was like, 'That's funny. I forgot about that scene' and it's a huge scene,\" he said on the Emmys red carpet. \"\n\nCulkin, who won a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice Award for his performance as Roman Roy in \"Succession\" — and is nominated again tonight — said between work and his two young kids, it's hard to find time to watch his performances.\n\nIt feels like Kieran is finally getting his moment in the spotlight for his role as little brother Roman Roy on \"Succession.\" Well-deserved!\n\n'Beef' domination expected to continue\n\n“Beef,” which stars Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, made history last week at the Golden Globes when it became the first show created by and starring Asian Americans to win best television limited series. Both Yeaun and Wong also took home Globes.\n\nLast night, the Netflix show continued to dominate at the Critics Choice Awards. It nabbed four statuettes, including best limited series.\n\nThe winning streak is expected continue tonight. The show is nominated for 13 Emmys and has already won three for outstanding casting, directing and modern costume.\n\nAyo Edebiri said her younger self never dreamed of being at the Emmy Awards\n\nAyo Edebiri, who won a Golden Globe for her performance in \"The Bear,\" told E! red carpet host Laverne Cox that her younger self never expected to be nominated for an Emmy Award for supporting actress in a comedy series.\n\n\"She didn't dream of nights like this,\" Edebiri said of her younger self. \"She dreamed of dental insurance.\"\n\nEdebiri also encouraged viewers to check their moles and go to the dermatologist. She also mentioned how blown away she was by Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour and called her role in \"The Bear\" a dream.\n\nWow, 3-D molded Louis Vuitton dress is absolutely stunning!\n\nLooks like Ayo's also still continuing her Ireland bit, in which she pretends she's from the country and describes it as her \"home nation.\"\n\n“Shout out to my people!\" she told Entertainment Tonight on the carpet. \"Shout out to Derry! Shout out to Cork! Shout out to Killarney! Shout out to Dublin!”\n\nA lot to watch on this Monday night\n\nThere are plenty of options to put on the TV tonight.\n\nWhether you're tuning into the Emmy's, rooting for your favorite team in the NFL playoffs or seeing how the Iowa caucus plays out, you've got entertainment for hours.\n\nMight I suggest monitoring all three for a nice entertainment-sports-politics trifecta?\n\nIt's red carpet time\n\nThe Emmy's red carpet is officially here!

Here's what everyone's most looking forward to.\n\nI would be thrilled to see Rhea Seehorn win for her supporting role as the morally ambiguous lawyer Kim Wexler on “Better Call Saul,” one of the best (and most underrated) series of the last decade. Seehorn delivered the most fascinating performance on the show — precise, adroit, mysterious — and I hope Emmy voters don’t miss this final opportunity to recognize her work on “Saul,” which wrapped up in August 2022.\n\nI’m excited to see whether “Beef” will continue riding high after its historic win at the Globes last week!\n\nThere were so many fantastic series that came to an end this year, and I am really looking forward to seeing how they all stack up. Which of the three \"Succession\" leading men will take home the top prize? Will Bill Hader take home another win for \"Barry\"? Will \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" or \"Ted Lasso\" get nods for their final seasons?\n\nI’m so excited to see the love “The Last of Us” gets tonight — the first video game adaptation to receive a number of Emmy nominations — even though I’m simultaneously rooting for the final season of “Succession” to be recognized.\n\nObama won his second Emmy\n\nFormer President Barack Obama is officially a two-time Emmy winner.\n\nAt the Creative Arts Emmys, the 44th president won for outstanding narrator in “Working: What We Do All Day.” He beat fellow nominees Morgan Freeman (“Our Universe”), Mahershala Ali (“Chimp Empire”), Angela Bassett (“Good Night Oppy”) and Pedro Pascal (“Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World”).\n\nLast year, Obama won in the same category for Netflix’s five-part documentary series “Our Great National Parks.”\n\nJustice for ‘Jury Duty’\n\n“Jury Duty” — the Amazon Freevee show that became a viral hit — didn’t take home any Golden Globes. But maybe it’ll be able to squeeze in an Emmy win?\n\nThe comedy starred a cast of mostly unfamiliar faces, except for James Marsden (who is nominated). It followed a staged civil court trial in which only the foreperson (a normal, wholesome guy named Ronald Gladden) was unaware that it was all for show.\n\nEven if the show walks away empty-handed, at least Gladden got the Hollywood treatment: He recently signed an overall deal with Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nEd Sheeran is an Emmy winner now\n\nEd Sheeran can add an Emmy to his shelf of Grammys now. During the Creative Arts Emmys, the singer won the award for best original music and lyrics in a television show for the song “A Beautiful Game” from Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso.”\n\n‘The Last of Us’ actor Nick Offerman shares acceptance speech\n\nNick Offerman shared love for his “The Last of Us” screen partner Murray Bartlett in his Emmys speech, which he posted on social media after he won in the outstanding guest actor category.\n\nOfferman plays Bill, a foul-mouthed loner who helps Joel and Ellie get a car in order to make their way to find the Fireflies. But he became a beloved character after viewers were captivated by his relationship with Frank (Bartlett).\n\nIn the show adaptation, Bill’s story starts at the beginning of the cordyceps pandemic. He has created his own doomsday-style bunker loaded with guns, weapons and electronics. He fortifies his home with an electric fence and various traps to prevent clickers and raiders from wandering in. He uses a generator for power, cooks himself gourmet meals and keeps an eye on the perimeter with a massive surveillance system. He’s satisfied in his solitude — until he finds Frank, who wanders into one of Bill’s traps and eventually persuades Bill to feed him. From there, the show’s most prominent romance blooms.\n\nRead more about how their love story was an example of how the adaptation was a milestone for many LGBTQ gamers.\n\nNetflix’s ‘Queer Eye’ squad got their own statuettes\n\nThe Fab 5 finally got their recognition. The show snagged its sixth consecutive win in the outstanding structured reality program category. But cast members got actual awards for the first time, because this past season was the first one in which they also served as producers.\n\nThe group celebrated by posting pictures on Instagram marking the milestone.\n\n“WE WON!! Queer Eye won for the 6th year, and we host get one this time too. Thank you to every one of you for your continued support of the show. We truly appreciate it!” Tan France wrote.\n\n“We won our first Emmy and I cannot stop crying,” wrote Jonathan Van Ness.\n\nThe win comes about two months after co-host Bobby Berk announced that he will be exiting the Netflix reality show after the coming eighth season.\n\n“Words can’t express what this means,” Berk, who was the interior design expert who transformed contestants’ homes, wrote on Instagram. “My 5 Fab siblings and I finally won an Emmy. Humbled with gratitude and love. Thank you to the Academy and to all our fans who have embraced us like family. This is for all of you. I love YOU.”\n\nKeke Palmer made history\n\nKeke Palmer took home an award at the Creative Arts Emmys for outstanding game show host.\n\nPalmer, 30, who hosts the NBC show “Password,” became the first Black woman — and the first woman in 15 years — to win in that category.\n\nOthers in the category were: Mayim Bialik, who recently announced her “Jeopardy!” hosting duties were ending; Ken Jennings, also of “Jeopardy!” fame; Pat Sajak, of “Wheel of Fortune”; and Steve Harvey, of “Family Feud.”\n\nPalmer posted about the win on Instagram.\n\nICYMI: Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool made an Emmys appearance\n\nNo, “Deadpool” isn’t an Emmy winner. But the infamous potty-mouthed superhero, played by Ryan Reynolds, did make a cameo at the Creative Arts Emmys in an acceptance speech.\n\nReynolds and Rob McElhenney’s FX documentary series, “Welcome to Wrexham,” won five awards last weekend, including outstanding unstructured reality program. They shared a video on social media celebrating the accolades, during which Deadpool addresses the camera.\n\n“First and foremost, Wrexham, we love you,” Deadpool says, holding the Emmy. “Thank you for letting Rob and the other guy tell your story. … I’d also like to thank the academy for this honor and for not asking us to attend the televised awards show with the real celebrities.”\n\nWatch the video below:\n\n‘The Last of Us’ has already won 8 Emmys\n\nGoing into tonight, the HBO video game adaptation “The Last of Us” has already won eight Emmys. Among the winners: Nick Offerman, who won for outstanding guest actor, and Storm Reid, who won for outstanding guest actress.\n\nTonight, the show is up against “Succession” in the outstanding drama series category. Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel Miller, is up for outstanding lead actor, drama series, and Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie Williams, is up for outstanding lead actress, drama series.\n\nThe show brings viewers into a dystopian modern-day America where a fungal infection known as “cordyceps” has spawned a global pandemic, turning its victims into aggressive, zombielike monsters. It follows Joel and Ellie 20 years after the cordyceps outbreak began.\n\nOver nine episodes, Joel must get Ellie — who unwittingly becomes the last bastion of hope for a possible cure when it’s discovered she’s immune to the zombie-inducing infection — to a guerrilla group of rebels known as the Fireflies, who hope to develop a cure for cordyceps.\n\nHelmed by “Chernobyl” executive producer Craig Mazin and the game’s creative lead, Neil Druckmann, the show has earned praise on social media from fans of the game, who have applauded the series for capturing its aesthetic.\n\nCreative Arts Emmys: Full list of early winners\n\nYes, the star-studded Emmys are airing tonight. But for many in the TV world — including some of the nominated stars — awards have already been handed out.\n\nDuring the Creative Arts Emmys on Jan. 6, 49 categories were presented. Part two of the show happened Jan. 7 (yes, the same day as the Golden Globes), during which 48 more categories were honored for unscripted prime-time TV.\n\nTonight’s show will honor nominees in 26 categories, as well as the Television Academy’s Governors Award.\n\nRead the full list of who has already taken home statuettes here.\n\nExpect some TV nostalgia (and reunions) at the Emmys this year\n\nAccording to Variety, “Emmy Awards executive producers Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay have planned a ceremony that leans heavily on the history of TV, given the award’s diamond anniversary.”\n\nSo far, the producers have confirmed mini-reunions with cast members from “Martin” and “Ally McBeal.” There will also be some tributes, including to the late Norman Lear and “Friends” star Matthew Perry.\n\nJournalist Kirbie Johnson, who posted from the Emmys press preview on Threads, reported that there will also likely be reunions for \"Game of Thrones,\" \"The Sopranos,\" and \"Cheers\" cast members.\n\nWho’s expected to win? Here are some early predictions\n\nThe final season of “Succession” seems to be a lock for best drama series, especially after the acclaimed portrait of corporate and familial dysfunction won equivalent honors at the Golden Globes.\n\nThe best comedy series race is less clear-cut. Variety predicts that “Abbott Elementary” will win. Ten of the editors of Gold Derby, an awards prediction website, picked “Ted Lasso,” which took home the top prize in 2022 and 2021; an 11th editor chose “The Bear.”\n\nNetflix’s “Beef” is expected to triumph in the category that recognizes limited or anthology series. The buzzy miniseries put in a strong showing at the Golden Globes, picking up three awards, and it drew raves from critics.\n\nIn the lead actor races, the front-runners appear to be Kieran Culkin (“Succession”), Sarah Snook (“Succession”), Jeremy Allen White (“The Bear”), Quinta Brunson (“Abbott Elementary”), Steven Yeun (“Beef”) and Ali Wong (“Beef”).\n\nThese Latino actors are nominated for leading roles\n\nPedro Pascal and Jenna Ortega are on a short list of Latinos to be nominated for Emmys for leading roles.\n\nPascal is nominated for best lead actor in a drama for his role as Joel Miller, the morally gray protagonist of HBO’s “The Last of Us.” Pascal is the second Latino to be nominated in the category, after Jimmy Smits, who was nominated five consecutive times for his role as Detective Bobby Simone on ABC’s “NYPD Blue” from 1995 to 1999.\n\nOrtega is nominated for best lead actress in a comedy series for portraying Wednesday Addams, the title character of Netflix’s hit show “Wednesday.” She’s the third Latina to be nominated in the lead actress category, following Rita Moreno in 1983 for ABC’s sitcom “9 to 5” and America Ferrera in 2007 and 2008 for ABC’s “Ugly Betty.” Ferrera won in 2007.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWhy are the 2023 Emmys being held in 2024?\n\nThe celebration of television that airs live tonight was delayed four months by the Hollywood strikes, which shut down the industry and forced awards show producers to shuffle their calendars.\n\nTonight’s ceremony will honor shows that aired from June 1, 2022, to May 31.\n\nFun facts: The Golden Globes last weekend recognized the second season of “The Bear,” but tonight’s Emmys will recognize the first season of “The Bear.” It’s also worth noting that one of this year’s Emmy nominees for drama (“Better Call Saul”) has been off the air for more than 16 months, after it wrapped in August 2022.\n\nWho’s presenting?\n\nThe performers tapped to announce winners include some of the night’s nominees, including Quinta Brunson (“Abbott Elementary”), Jenna Ortega (“Wednesday”), Pedro Pascal (“The Last of Us”), Sheryl Lee Ralph (“Abbott Elementary”) and Hannah Waddingham (“Ted Lasso”).\n\nThey’ll be joined by familiar faces such as Jason Bateman, Jodie Foster, Jon Hamm and Ken Jeong, according to the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.\n\nWho is the Emmys host?\n\nAnthony Anderson is this year’s emcee. The actor and comedian is arguably best known for starring on the ABC sitcom “black-ish.” Anderson, who was nominated for seven acting Emmys for his lead role on “black-ish,” currently hosts the Fox game show “We Are Family.”\n\n“With our industry’s recent challenges behind us, we can get back to what we love — dressing up and honoring ourselves,” Anderson said in a statement when his hosting gig was announced.\n\nEmmy Awards executive producers Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay told Variety that there will be a \"big production number\" from Anderson.\n\n“I don’t want to say Anthony Anderson could have been Usher had he went down another path, but you’re going to find out in our open how much Anthony loves to sing,” Collins told the publication. “How much theme songs from television shows shaped his childhood and helped raise him to be who he is today. That’s where we’re leaning to kick this thing off: big fun music and Anthony Anderson being the best version of himself to really set the party off.”\n\nWhat time is the red carpet?\n\nE! will host “Live From E! Countdown to the Emmys” starting at 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. PT), followed by red carpet coverage at 6 p.m. ET (3 p.m. PT).\n\nWhat shows got the most nominations?\n\nHBO dominated nominations this year — with three of its shows scoring big:\n\n“Succession”: 27 nominations\n\n“The Last of Us”: 24 nominations\n\n“The White Lotus”: 23 nominations\n\nMeanwhile, Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso” was the most-nominated comedy, with 21 nods for its final season. “The Bear,” which was nominated in comedy categories, is nominated for 13 awards overall and took home four during the Creative Arts ceremonies last weekend.\n\nEmmys: Full list of nominees (Limited Series)\n\nLimited Series\n\n“Beef”\n\n“Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story”\n\n“Daisy Jones and the Six”\n\n“Fleishman Is in Trouble”\n\n“Obi-Wan Kenobi”\n\nActor in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nTaron Egerton — “Black Bird”\n\nKumail Nanjiani — “Welcome to Chippendales”\n\nEvan Peters — “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story”\n\nDaniel Radcliffe — “Weird: The Al Yankovic Story”\n\nMichael Shannon — “George & Tammy”\n\nSteven Yeun — “Beef”\n\nActress in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nLizzy Caplan — “Fleishman Is in Trouble”\n\nJessica Chastain — “George & Tammy”\n\nDominique Fishback — “Swarm”\n\nKathryn Hahn — “Tiny Beautiful Things”\n\nRiley Keough, “Daisy Jones and the Six”\n\nAli Wong, “Beef”\n\nSupporting Actor in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nMurray Bartlett — “Welcome to Chippendales”\n\nPaul Walter Hauser — “Black Bird”\n\nRichard Jenkins — “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story”\n\nJoseph Lee — “Beef”\n\nRay Liotta — “Black Bird”\n\nYoung Mazino — “Beef”\n\nJesse Plemons — “Love & Death”\n\nSupporting Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nAnnaleigh Ashford — “Welcome to Chippendales”\n\nMaria Bello — “Beef”\n\nClaire Danes — “Fleishman Is in Trouble”\n\nJuliette Lewis — “Welcome to Chippendales”\n\nCamila Morrone — “Daisy Jones and the Six”\n\nNiecy Nash-Betts — “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story”\n\nEmmys: Full list of nominees (Drama)\n\nOutstanding Drama Series\n\n\"Andor\"\n\n\"Better Call Saul\"\n\n\"The Crown\"\n\n\"House of the Dragon\"\n\n\"The Last of Us\"\n\n\"Succession\"\n\n\"The White Lotus\"\n\n\"Yellowjackets\"\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n\nJeff Bridges, \"The Old Man\"\n\nBrian Cox, \"Succession\"\n\nKieran Culkin, “Succession”\n\nBob Odenkirk, \"Better Call Saul\"\n\nPedro Pascal, \"The Last of Us\"\n\nJeremy Strong, \"Succession\"\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series\n\nSharon Horgan, \"Bad Sisters\"\n\nMelanie Lynskey, \"Yellowjackets\"\n\nElisabeth Moss, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\"\n\nBella Ramsey, \"The Last of Us\"\n\nKeri Russell, \"The Diplomat\"\n\nSarah Snook, \"Succession\"\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series\n\nF.
