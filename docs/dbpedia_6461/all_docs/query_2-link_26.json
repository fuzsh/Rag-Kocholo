        "text": "The Crown Jewels is the “hysterical” (The Spectator) new comedy based on the most unbelievable royal caper in British history. Charismatic and unpredictable Colonel Blood, along with a trio of misfits, is planning the greatest heist of all time: stealing the Crown Jewels in plain sight. But reigning monarch Charles II can’t afford a royal scandal, and no King likes people handling their Crown Jewels…\n\nWith an exceptionally star-studded cast including the “King of Comedy” (Sunday Times) Al Murray and Mel Giedroyc “at her comedy peak” (The Independent), this “outrageous” (The Stage) production leaves “the audience howling with laughter” (Daily Express). Also starring Joe Thomas, Neil Morrissey, Carrie Hope Fletcher, Aidan McArdle, Adonis Siddique and Tanvi Virmani, written by BAFTA award-winning creator of The Durrells and Men Behaving Badly, Simon Nye, and directed by multi-Olivier Award winner Sean Foley (Upstart Crow, The Ladykillers), it would be criminal to miss this raucous royal affair."
