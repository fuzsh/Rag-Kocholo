        "text": "Despite a double bill of episodes to kick-start the series, I still have no idea what The Cafe (Sky1) is. If it's a sitcom, as the previous credits of writers and stars Ralf Little and Michelle Terry, not to mention director Craig Cash, suggest, then it's boldly reinventing the genre. There are about four jokes an episode, everybody gets on swimmingly and the characters are as bland as a plate of boiled chips.\n\nNotionally a sitcom nonetheless, The Cafe is set in a seaside caff in Weston-super-Mare, and stars a trio of grandmother, mum and daughter all coming to terms with the loss, by death or by dumping, of a partner. It is, unsurprisingly, a poor recipe for hilarity. Perhaps it's meant to be a slow-burning comedy-drama, but alas, there's very little drama either. And it's not so much slow-burning as unlit. And quite possibly flame-retardant.\n\nThe main problem is that the pace is painfully slow. Glacial, even. To the point that halfway through the first episode I couldn't have told you for the life of me what was happening. Or rather, I could, but it's that the accounts were in trouble, Ralf Little had bought a car online, a man in sunglasses had arrived at the cafe, our heroine was trying to write a book, her mum's love interest's daughter had bought too much shampoo, there was a gay human statue, an evil woman in high heels, and, according to grandma, a binman had fallen over. Are you hooked yet?\n\nWhat there wasn't was any semblance of a self-contained plot. Scenes were ordered more or less arbitrarily, each largely irrelevant to the next, so that you'd get about as much of a story watching the whole backwards as forwards. Minor characters such as the human statue came and went, playing no role in the story, while major characters wandered off into what looked like subplots and were never seen again.\n\nThe crux of the overarching story – though you'd be forgiven for failing to spot it – is that mum Carol wants daughter Sarah married off, and daughter Sarah just wants to spend the day staring wistfully at the sea. \"That girl,\" says mum, in episode two, \"She needs a boyfriend, not fresh air.\"\n\nIn theory, Sarah has two potential romantic interests: Little's limp local boy Richard Boring and fancy city-slicker John Sunglasses. I say in theory, because in practice neither suitor has the gumption to do anything more than wave at our heroine and saunter off in the other direction. There is a scene where this actually happens. A whole scene. Pride and Prejudice it surely ain't.\n\nThe appeal, presumably, is supposed to be authenticity. The hope must be that in seaside towns everywhere people are yelling, between fits of giggles, \"That's exactly what it's like! Nothing happens here either!\"\n\nHow else but a religious adherence to recreating the tedium of life itself to explain the use of the phrase \"What did your last slave die of?\", delivered as an apparent punchline, or the fact that episode two seemed to be mostly about the gradual, bacteria-like spread through the community of a christmas cracker joke about scones? (Major spoiler alert: \"What's the fastest cake?\" \"Before you know it, it's scone.\")\n\nMost of the characters didn't even find the scone joke funny, so what viewers were supposed to make of its endless recurrence we can only speculate, and a related riff about characters putting jam on their scones before cream only added to the confusion. I assume it was supposed to resonate with the burgeoning superstitious scone-eater demographic.\n\nThe crowning touch was the scene in which the gang discussed Devonshire scones, culminating in Carol announcing, \"The EU can mind its own business!\", which briefly made me wonder if the seaside cafe was now an unlikely vehicle for a Thick of It-esque Brussels satire. If only. Instead, episode two introduced a handful of new, equally paper-thin characters, of whom it says a lot that the most interesting was – and I quote now from the credits – \"Irish James\".\n\nIn fairness to the writers, their performances are both consistently excellent, and the direction is both naturalistic and nicely understated. But while, as the name suggests, the show owes a clear debt to The Office in its style, it sadly failed to nick Gervais and Merchant's knack for writing characters, stories and, crucially, jokes."
