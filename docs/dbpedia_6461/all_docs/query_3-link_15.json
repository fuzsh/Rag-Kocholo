From an early age, he demonstrated a passion for drawing and his love of music quickly followed. As Nik continued creating artwork he also began teaching himself piano, and by age twelve, started performing in public. He now leads his own rock and roll band based out of Austin, The Selfless Lovers, in which he plays piano, saxophone, sings and writes the songs.\n\nAs an artist, Nik was prolific from a young age, literally filling up file boxes with the amount of art he created. As he earned his BBA from The University of Texas at Austin, Nik started to hone in on his style of illustration by spending long hours drawing at coffee shops. His art is characterized by surrealist elements and a vibrant, otherworldly color pallet. He strives to create imaginative pieces that are immersive and most importantly, fun.\n\nToday, Nik makes heavy use of Prismacolor pencils and graphite. His pieces often take weeks or even months to finish as many of the scenes he creates stem completely from his own imagination. He draws primarily on oversized, toned archival paper, starting with a “skeleton,” of pencil and slowly erasing all the pencil and replacing with Prismacolors as the pieces near completion.\n\n--\n\nLew Apollo is a rising force in the world of Neo Soul-Blues Rock, captivating audiences with his soul-stirring melodies and poignant songwriting. Born and raised in Barnum, MN, Lew's journey in music began with a deep connection to the rich musical heritage of his home state.\n\nFollowing the release of his debut EP 'JUNGLE,' masterfully produced by BLK ODYSSY, Lew Apollo made an indelible mark on the music scene, amassing an impressive 150,000 streams in less than two months. His music resonates deeply with listeners, evoking emotions and a sense of solace in the face of life's most challenging obstacles.\n\nIn the wake of his father's tragic suicide in Fall 2022, Lew's artistry took a profound turn. He found solace in pouring his emotions into his songwriting, using his music as a platform to normalize conversations about difficult topics such as isolation, entrapment, anxiety, temptation, and depression. Through his heartfelt lyrics and soulful voice, Lew Apollo aims to remind his audience that they are not alone in their struggles, offering a beacon of hope and understanding.\n\nAs a testament to his talent and appeal, Lew has captivated audiences in legendary venues across Austin, including sold-out shows at The Pershing and nearly Antone's Nightclub. His captivating stage presence and electrifying performances leave a lasting impression on all who witness his live shows.\n\nWith the momentum of his EP's success behind him, Lew Apollo is now preparing to embark on his most ambitious project yet - his debut full-length album, slated for release early 2024. Anticipation is high for this new chapter in his musical journey, and fans are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to delve even deeper into Lew's soulful world.\n\nAs an artist with a clear vision and a heartwarming dedication to using music as a means of healing, Lew Apollo is undoubtedly the new voice of Neo Soul-Blues Rock. Through his exceptional talent and compassionate storytelling, he continues to touch the hearts of his growing audience, leaving an everlasting impact on the world of music and beyond.Nik Parr is a musician and illustrator living and performing in Austin, Texas.\n\nNik is self taught in both fields.

While staying in the country with a friend, she found an old DVD of Down From the Mountain, the documentary and concert film of the \"O, Brother Where Art Thou'' soundtrack that featured this particular Stanley interview. She immediately jotted down \"borned in ya\" on a piece of paper. \"I knew I had to write that song,\" she recalls.\n\nIn the Spring of 2023, Carper went back to East Nashville's Bomb Shelter — the same \"analog wonderland\" where she'd recorded Ramblin' Soul and its predecessor, Daddy's Country Gold, and enlisted the help of her trusted co-producers — Dennis Crouch and Andrija Tokic. \"Borned In Ya\" would become the title track of the new album, out July 19th via Mae Music/Thirty Tigers.\n\nLike much of her writing, the song applies a homespun sensibility — and a bit of humor — to questions about life's journeys. \"I was turning over in my mind what it means to have something 'borned in ya,'\" she said. \"The song evolved as I was writing it to be more about having your soul 'borned it ya,' and the more life experience you have, you hopefully grow to embody the highest version of yourself that you can be.\" \"Borned In Ya\" could certainly stand as a reflection on Carper's life in music. \"Authentic\" might be an overused word to describe an artist's appeal, but there's something so natural and true about Carper's musicality that she must have been born with it: An easy sway to her singing, a precise, but laid back sense of timing. A feel. And, lyrically, she has an instinctive sense for storytelling, both observant and intuitive.\n\nAs with the message of \"Borned In Ya,\" these traits have been sharpened by life experiences — including early music influences and the many turns of her career as a performer. Carper, born into a music-loving family, was raised on roots music, immersing herself in a family record collection that featured Hank Williams Sr., Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, and more. The public school music curriculum in her home state of Nebraska gave Carper an opportunity to learn upright bass. \"I remember wanting to play bass, to play the biggest string instrument, \" she recalls. Carper performed in her school orchestra — and also in her family's country band. Led by her mother, the group played a mix of classics and the new country of the 80's, but it was the old stuff that stuck with the young bassist. Along the way, Carper's father gave her a collection of Jimmie Rodgers recordings, which made a defining impact. \"He combined country and blues and jazz,\" she recalls. \"All of those elements, and the rawness of those recordings… I can't quite put a finger on it, but I was obsessed.\" Carper earned a music scholarship to attend the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. College didn't quite take, but while there, she spent hours in the music library, drawn to jazz vocalists like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra, and she discovered seminal blues artist Lead Belly.\n\nYou'll hear all of these influences in the music Carper has made over the years as a member of numerous touring acts and as a solo performer. Classic country and Western Swing sounds come to the fore on Daddy's Country Gold, Carper's 2021 album. Country roots and old-time jazz are at the heart of 'Ramblin' Soul' too, but the album also ventures confidently into R & B and Soul territory. Those albums helped Carper establish a growing fan base and earn accolades from music reviewers. One writer lauded her \"cool jazz-infused hillbilly serenades that linger in the air like fresh-cut hay.\" Rolling Stone Country praised both her writing and musical stylings: \"Singer-bassist Melissa Carper sounds like a voice from a bygone era . . . evoking the cool, smoky croon of a lounge singer, Carper gives some winking commentary about having a good time.\"\n\nPerhaps the most meaningful praise for Carper's music has come from the world-class musicians she's worked with onstage and in the studio. One is multi-instrumentalist Chris Scruggs. He's a veteran of Nashville's studio world, has played with influential roots-country-rockers BR-549, and currently tours as a member of Marty Stuart and the Fabulous Superlatives. Scruggs has been proud to contribute to Carper's albums, including her recent 'Borned In Ya' sessions. \"She's as good as it gets,\" he said, \"She has a quality that really transcends time and fashion.\" It was Scruggs who dubbed Carper \"Hilbillie Holiday\" — an admiring nod to her marriage of country and jazz vocal styles. \" I stand by that,\" he said. \"She can sing Hank Williams and then handle these old pop tunes, and the great thing is how natural she is — she doesn't even really change her delivery.\"\n\nBorned In Ya showcases Carper's long-standing influences as well as her artistic growth and sense of adventure. The old-time jazz sounds we came to know on Daddy's Country Gold are back in full force along with the R&B and Soul of Ramblin' Soul. Perhaps, the least 'country' of her albums, the country roots are still felt as you can never remove the 'hillbilly' from Carper's sound. In addition to her familiar blend of country with jazz, blues, soul, and R&B, the new album sees Carper exploring a more subtle and expert crossing of these genres and with a matured lyrical depth. The title track kicks things off with a gospel-style vocal chorus before settling into an impeccably funky groove. \"Evil Eva\" recalls the classic R&B of the 50s and 60s, and \"Let's Stay Single Together\" puts Carper's crooning vocal to a delightful jazz-tinged country soul feel. \"There'll Be Another One\" sounds like classic Roy Orbison with Carper floating atop the bed of ever growing emotion, fueled by the stunning string arrangement from fiddler, Rebecca Patek. \"Somewhere Between Texas and Tennessee\" is straight out of the honky tonk and \"Lucky Five\" is reminiscent of an old Frank Sinatra swinger. Carper rounds out this album with covers of two classics, \"That's My Desire,\" crossover jazz/country tune from the 30s, and a beautiful rendition of Cole Porter's \"Everytime We Say Goodbye.\"\n\nIn addition to Scruggs, Borned In Ya features a cast of top-flight musicians like bassist Dennis Crouch (Johnny Cash, Gregg Allman, Alison Krauss, Robert Plant), pianist Jeff Taylor (The Time Jumpers, Riders in the Sky), fiddle master Billy Contreras (Ricky Scaggs, Buddy Spicher, George Jones), and multi-instrumentalist Rory Hoffman (Ricky Skaggs, Kathy Mattea, John Cowan). This is Carper's first album featuring horns; Doug Corcoran, from JD McPherson's band, plays trumpet and saxophone. And there are soulful backup vocals by Kyshona Armstrong, Nickie Conley and Maureen Murphy, as well as beautiful harmonies by Carper's longtime music pal and bandmate, Jenn Miori Hodges (Carper Family). Carper penned the majority of the album's 12 songs herself, though she co-wrote three tunes with friend and bandmate, Brennen Leigh (Wonder Women of Country). \"Brennen is just brilliant with lyric ideas and we always have a good time writing together, \" Carper said.\n\nCarper is eager for the release of Borned In Ya, and hopes it will resonate with fans of her earlier work while establishing an artistic step forward. \"People call me retro or throwback, and I've been OK with that,\" she says. \"But, I feel like I'm still creating something new. I'm taking styles and blending things in a way that maybe hasn't been done before. And, in the process, I'm evolving in my own way.\"\n\n“The more guitar you play, the more you sing, the better you get,” says award-winning Texas guitar slinger, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Carolyn Wonderland. Since performing her first professional gig at age 15, she’s never stopped singing and making music. Her music includes a bold mix of timeless original songs and reinventions of some of her favorites, ranging from blistering electric blues to deep, heartfelt ballads to cosmic country to soulful Tex-Mex. Every song is fueled by Wonderland’s forceful yet melodic Texas-flavored guitar work and her full-throated, heart-on-her-sleeve vocals. She’s recorded ten previous albums under her own name, including four produced by famed musician Ray Benson, founder of multiple Grammy-winning band Asleep At The Wheel. Wonderland, who spent the last three years as lead guitarist in John Mayall’s Blues Breakers, now joins the Alligator Records family as the first female guitar hero in the label’s storied 50-year history. Her spine-chilling, soul-deep singing matches her guitar prowess note for note. And she has a knack for writing songs that sound like instant classics. Her Alligator Records debut, the Dave Alvin-produced Tempting Fate, is the next chapter in Wonderland’s remarkable story, one that is already overflowing with countless and colorful once-in-a-lifetime experiences.\n\nOn Tempting Fate, Wonderland delivers ten riveting songs, including five fiery originals (and one co-write with her Mayall bandmate Greg Rzab). On every song—from the searing, guitar-heavy Broken Hearted Blues to the tender and poignant Crack In The Wall to the very Texan love song for her boot collection, Texas Girl And Her Boots, to the politically-charged Fragile Peace And Certain War to the take-no-prisoners version of the Grateful Dead’s Loser—Wonderland throws herself completely into the music. Her shining duet with Jimmie Dale Gilmore on Bob Dylan’s It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry redefines the song. Her explosive guitar work and commanding vocals on John Mayall’s The Laws Must Change makes his song hers.\n\nIn addition to her longtime road band—bassist Bobby Perkins and drummer Kevin Lance—who anchor every song, guests on Tempting Fate include Gilmore, Cindy Cashdollar on lap steel guitar, Marcia Ball on piano, Shelley King on background vocals, Jan Flemming on accordion and Red Young on organ and piano, with producer Dave Alvin playing guitar on three songs. “I can’t wait to share the new album,” says Wonderland. “I got to record a dream list of songs and play with a dream list of people. And Dave really got me to kick the doors in. And it’s hip to be on Alligator. If you could see my record collection, it’s full of Alligator albums.”\n\nAlvin told writer Michael Corcoran, “I wanted to work with Carolyn because her guitar playing isn’t imitating anyone. She is especially not imitating the imitators, like so many modern blues or blues/rock guitarists do. She developed her own effective way of playing the blues that incorporate bits of folk, country and even psychedelic riffs, plus she always surprises me with her guitar lines and melodic twists and turns. As for Carolyn’s vocals, they are soulful and powerful to the point of being often spine-tingling. Her ability to move from intimate, whispery gentleness to earth shaking, Saturday night bar room loudness, always impresses me, both for the obvious gifts of her vocal range but also how well she uses it to advance the drama or the story of the song. I also love that Carolyn has a wonderful, mischievous sense of humor that makes her performances honest and charming and keep them far away from getting too bogged down in too much serious ‘artiste’ posturing.”\n\nCarolyn Wonderland, born Carolyn Bradford in Houston, Texas in 1972, grew up in a house full of music and instruments. She first starting making music at age six, and by eight had decided, in her own mind, that she was a musician. After she scratched up her mother’s vintage Martin guitar by imitating Pete Townsend’s famous windmill move, she was forbidden from using a pick. Because of that, she developed her aggressive, distinctive finger-picking guitar attack. Her early influences include her mom, Houston guitar legends Albert Collins, Jerry Lightfoot, Joe “Guitar” Hughes, and Little Screamin’ Kenny, as well as blues and soul vocalist Lavelle White. Singing came naturally, as did learning to play just about every instrument she got her hands on. She plays trumpet, accordion, lap steel, piano, and mandolin. She’s a whistler, too. Her renowned whistling can be heard to great effect on her song, On My Feet Again.\n\nBy age 15, she was performing at Houston’s famed Fitzgerald’s club, playing solo or with friends. As a 16-year-old, she found herself swapping songs with Townes Van Zandt. She formed her first band when she was 17, and began proving herself on the tough, competitive Houston club scene. A year later, she joined forces with famed Houston musician Little Screamin’ Kenny and formed The Imperial Monkeys. Before long, Carolyn Wonderland And The Imperial Monkeys were swinging high on the vine, touring as far as Utah, New York and South Dakota, and winning every music award Houston had to offer. A booking at Austin’s famous Antone’s club left a strong mark on Wonderland, who moved to Austin in 1999 at the urging of Doug Sahm (who told her, “It’s the land of free guitar lessons”). For two years she traveled with her band in her van, and stayed with friends in Austin and on the road, trading chores for meals and lodging. “I wasn’t home-less,” she says. “I was van-full.”\n\nWonderland released Alcohol & Salvation in 2001 on a tiny local label. The self-released Bloodless Revolution followed in 2003, and brought her new fans, along with local press and radio attention. Her growing reputation as a hotter-than-fire live performer kept her touring calendar full. Then one day in 2003, legendary musician Ray Benson was having lunch with his friend Bob Dylan, who had heard Wonderland’s music. Dylan asked Benson, “Hey, have you heard Carolyn Wonderland? She’s something else.” Dylan wanted to meet Wonderland, so Benson got her number from a mutual friend and called her in Houston, telling Wonderland to get to Austin immediately to meet Dylan. She drove the 165 miles in record time, and they had great fun jamming that night. They’ve crossed paths since, sometimes jamming, sometimes just talking about music (“He’s a real musicologist,” she says of Bob). Dylan once asked Wonderland to write bawdy answer lyrics to his already-ribald Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat, and all but fell over laughing when she played the newly rewritten song for him. “Sometimes he’ll just call,” Wonderland says. “I haven’t changed my number.”\n\nWonderland’s first Ray Benson-produced album, Miss Understood, came out on Benson’s Bismeaux label in 2008. Upon its release, the mayor of Austin declared “Carolyn Wonderland Day” throughout the city. Benson produced her next three albums, Peace Meal in 2011, Live Texas Trio in 2015 (both on Bismeaux) and Moon Goes Missing (on Home Records) in 2017. According to Benson, “Carolyn’s got that unbelievable, incredible voice, one of the great voices of our times. She’s got the range, the emotion. She’s also an incredible guitar player and a great person. The combination is disarming and totally real. That’s magic.”\n\nThe popular and critical response to Wonderland and her music has been nothing short of amazing. She’s appeared on Austin City Limits, NPR’s Weekend Edition and NPR Music’s Mountain Stage. Features and reviews have run in publications from The Los Angeles Times to The Boston Herald. Her music has been heard on FOX-TV’s Time Of Your Life and on NBC’s Homicide. She appears, playing on stage alongside Bonnie Raitt, in the film The Road To Austin. She’s won multiple Austin Music Awards and was inducted into the Austin Music Hall Of Fame in 2020. She’s jammed with musicians including Buddy Guy, Johnny Winter, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, James Cotton, Los Lobos, Vintage Trouble, Robert Earl Keen, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and Levon Helm. Helm invited her to begin all of her tours with a performance at his famous Ramble in Woodstock, New York. “He always refreshed and recharged us before we hit the road,” Wonderland says.\n\nIn 2018, legendary musician and bandleader John Mayall chose Wonderland to be lead guitarist in his band, The Blues Breakers. She became the first woman to ever hold that position. (The all-star list of Mayall’s legendary guitarists includes Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Peter Green, Coco Montoya and Walter Trout.) She toured the world with Mayall, once playing 50 shows in 60 days in 19 countries. She’s also played with her own band all over the U.S. and in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Panama, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Canary Islands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Japan.\n\nIn addition to her performing and recording with her own band, Wonderland has collaborated with a number of other artists, including Jerry Lightfoot’s Band of Wonder (featuring the Grateful Dead’s Vince Welnick), The Loose Affiliation Of Saints And Sinners (with Papa Mali, Guy Forsyth and others), and James Williamson (The Stooges). She can also occasionally be found singing and playing in Sis Deville, the Imperial Crown Golden Harmonizers, the Austin Volunteer Orchestra, the Texas Guitar Women, and the Woodstock Lonestars.\n\nWonderland also works tirelessly for a wide variety of charitable and social causes. She has often donated proceeds from her music to benefit organizations including Doctors Without Borders, Planned Parenthood, Farm Aid, NORML and the M.D. Anderson Children’s Art Project. She is a founding member, along with Marcia Ball, of H.O.M.E. (Housing Opportunities for Musicians and Entertainers), which provides emergency financial assistance to older Austin-based musicians in need.\n\nWonderland married her husband, humorist A. Whitney Brown, in a ceremony on Austin’s Doug Sahm Hill, performed by Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, and documented in The New York Times’ “Vow” section. Nesmith, who had previously produced a song for Wonderland on her Peace Meal album, says, “When she goes into that mode where she decides to grab the heart of the song and hold it up for everybody to see, it’s just so searing. Nothing can be this raw. Nothing can be this real.”\n\nThe Boston Herald describes Carolyn as “a dollop of Janis Joplin, a slice of Stevie Ray Vaughan, and a big load of soulful individuality. That’s Wonderland, a seething-hot Texas singer-guitarist. And she can write, too.” Now, with Tempting Fate and a major tour in the works, Carolyn Wonderland is excited to get back out on the road and reconnect with her fans and friends. “We will play dang near anywhere that’ll have us,” she says. Of her chosen profession, the effervescent Wonderland told NPR Music’s Mountain Stage, “I wouldn’t recommend it for the faint of heart, but it sure is a good time.”\n\nWalter Trout\n\nAll of us are broken. But no-one is beyond repair. It’s a philosophy that Walter Trout has lived by during seven volatile decades at the heart of America’s society and blues-rock scene. Even now, with the world more fractured than ever – by politics, economics, social media and culture wars – the fabled US bluesman’s latest album, Broken, chronicles the bitter schisms of modern life but refuses to succumb to them.\n\n“I’ve always tried to write positive songs, and this album is not quite that,” considers the 72-year-old of an all-original tracklisting that rages and soothes. “But I always hold on to hope. I think that’s why I wrote this album.”\n\nFor the last half-century, however rocky his path, hope has always lit the way. The beats of Trout’s unbelievable story are well-known: the traumatic childhood in Ocean City, New Jersey; the audacious move to the West Coast in ’74; the auspicious but chaotic sideman shifts with John Lee Hooker and Big Mama Thornton; the raging addictions that somehow never stopped the boogie when he was with Canned Heat in the early-’80s.\n\nEven now, some will point to Trout’s mid-’80s guitar pyrotechnics in the lineup of John Mayall’s legendary Bluesbreakers as his career high point. But for a far greater majority of fans, the blood, heart and soul of his solo career since 1989 is the main event, the bluesman’s songcraft always reaching for some greater truth, forever surging forward, never shrinking back.\n\nIt’s a peerless creative streak underlined by the guitarist’s regular triumphs at ceremonies including the Blues Music Awards, SENA European Guitar Awards, British Blues Awards and Blues Blast Music Awards. The iconic British DJ ‘Whispering’ Bob Harris spoke for millions when he declared Trout “the world’s greatest rock guitarist” in his 2001 autobiography, The Whispering Years.\n\nIf he were a less questing artist, Trout could mark time and dine out on those past glories, leaving the polemics and calls-to-arms to a younger generation. But that’s not enough, considers the still-hungry veteran. “I have to grow. I want to be a vital contributing artist. I don’t want to come out every night and play my first hit, Life In The Jungle. I feel young. I know I’m not. But in my head, I’m still 25, still wanting to get better and do something I haven’t before. I have more to say.”\n\nAs the pandemic burnt out, Trout got back to business: the career-long cycle of writing, touring and resting still as natural to him as breathing. But scarcely had the world’s turntable needles dropped on his latest album, 2022’s Ride, when Trout felt the first tingles of incoming inspiration. Alternating between his homes in the remote Danish fishing village of Vorupør and Huntington Beach, California – or sometimes even in the back of the van, still slick with sweat after that night’s gig – the twelve songs of Broken demanded to be born.\n\n“A lot of times I put on headphones, listen to music that gets me emotional, and then start just writing lyrics,” explains Trout of a process that still fascinates him. “I think these songs are as honest as I can be. The band came down to my house for rehearsals so we could just go in the studio and blow through this stuff.”\n\nKingsize Soundlabs in LA was the scene of the crime – a familiar Trout Band haunt that also hosted 2019’s Survivor Blues – and producer Eric Corne once again the man behind the glass. “This is our 15th album together,” calculates the bluesman. “Eric and I just have a way of working, man. A friend who came into the studio and watched us and said, ‘Man, you guys are like a machine’. It’s unspoken.”\n\nA few collaborators joined Trout for the first time. “I thought my friend Beth Hart could relate to the title track, Broken,” he says of the warrior princess whose fiery vocals coil with his own. “With that song, I was looking at the world – especially what’s going on in the United States – but also thinking about my recovery from the things that happened to me. I had the first verse – ‘Pieces of me seem to break away/I lose a little more every day’. But it was almost too much for me to go back into that shit. So my wife, Marie, was able to help me with the lyrics – and she nailed it. The guitar solo, that’s maybe my favourite on the record. I tracked it with the band, one take. I wanted to see if I could beat it – but they wouldn’t let me!”\n\nAnother set of star guests supply the rocket fuel on two of the album’s most rocking cuts, I’ve Had Enough and Bleed. “Dee Snider from Twisted Sister put up a live cut of me on his Twitter and said: ‘Listen to this fucking guitar hero’. We started talking, became friends, he came into the studio and I knew I had to write him a song. So I’m thinking, ‘Well, he did We’re Not Gonna Take It’. So I wrote I’ve Had Enough. And it’s rockin’, big time. Bleed came about when we were pretty much done. My drummer Michael Leasure said to me, ‘Hey, Walter, you played with John Lee Hooker and Canned Heat, this is your 31st album and you’ve never played a boogie. What’s the deal?’ So I said, ‘OK, fuck it, let’s do a boogie’. I can kinda play harmonica, but I thought, ‘Let’s elevate this thing’. There’s a young harmonica player in England who’s the best I’ve ever heard, Will Wilde. He has the soul and the power of Paul Butterfield, but couples that with blinding virtuoso technique.”\n\nElsewhere, in a flash of telepathy, Trout discovered the line he was singing as a placeholder lyric for the cowboy blues of Turn And Walk Away had already been written by Marie (“I have a box of lyrics, and I find this piece of paper, in my wife’s handwriting, from twenty years ago and the first line says: ‘It never occurred to me that you would ever set me free’. It fit the song perfectly”). As for the blues tune, Courage In The Dark, Trout believes it took no more than ten minutes. “I was actually reading a book of poetry in the van, and the line was something like, ‘In a world of darkness, it’s a necessity that you hold on to your courage’.”\n\nFor the wistful Talkin’ To Myself, Trout took inspiration from the hits that crackled from AM radio in his youth, paired with a lyric about his habit of yelling at the hotel TV on the road, and a highly successful first attempt to play a vintage electric sitar (“Y’know, it’s ’66, you’re riding in your car, and Paul Revere and The Raiders comes on – I wanted this song to sound like that”). But on No Magic (in the street), he acknowledges the march of time. “I’ve been living here in Huntington Beach for 50 years. For decades, I knew everybody on Main Street: ‘Hey Walter, what’s goin’ on?’ But I took a walk down there recently and realised there’s a new generation, with their own Steinbeckian society, and I felt like an anachronism. So when I say there’s no more magic out on the streets now, that’s just for me.”\n\nNo words were required for the tender instrumental Love Of My Life (“Of course, it’s about Marie”), while the bluesman’s muse of three decades also inspired the gossamer balladry of I Wanna Stay (“I’m whispering that song – it’s meant to be as quiet and gentle and possible. That’s about the first time I made love to my wife”). The bright-eyed soul of Breathe was written by keyboardist, Richard T Bear and reimagined by Trout with a nod to the Faces’ heart-wrenching Debris. “I told the bass player Jamie Hunting, ‘I want you to play like Ronnie Lane here’. And I told Skip Edwards, the piano player: ‘I want Ian McLagan’. And they nailed it.”\n\nThen comes a wildcard, in the form of the scalded, spacey, spoken-word punk-blues Heaven Or Hell. “I met an old blind man on the street,” explains Trout. “I gave him a little money to eat, he started preaching, and I went back to my room and wrote a poem about what he said. I couldn’t sing it, I couldn’t fit it into music, so I told Eric, ‘I’m just gonna speak it’.”\n\nFor most of the new record, Trout reached for his battle-scarred Fender Stratocaster or Delaney signature model, plugging into his trusty Mesa/Boogie MkIV stage amp (no pedals required). But for the closing Falls Apart, he pushed the sonic envelope. “Anyone who thinks I’m just a blues guy, I’m gonna hit them with my version of Pink Floyd,” he laughs. “That outro has three different electric guitar rhythms, and two acoustic guitar rhythms in different inversions. Then there’s a Nashville-tuned guitar. Our middle child Biscuit, AKA Captain Buzzface, wrote the song and arranged and sang all the background vocals. I think that the kid wrote an epic song that is very fitting for the state of the world today. I have a hard time getting through that one without breaking down.”\n\nWith gallows humour, Trout notes that his new album opens with a track called Broken and ends with one called Falls Apart. He can’t deny the socio-political mood in the air, and as such, between those two bookends lie some of the most personal, bruised songs of his career (albeit twinned to some of his most rocking and defiant guitar work). Yet as the man says, as long as there’s love and music, there is always a light to guide us. “That Sixties idealism still burns in me and I want to make music that means something or helps somebody. I may be naïve but I’m ok with that. In the face of what’s happening in the world, I will stubbornly hold on to my idealism and hope. I want to make music that matters…”\n\nKelly Willis is Back Being Blue, to take a color-coded cue from the title of her seventh album. It’s a shade she wears well, though long-patient fans might just say: You had us at back. They’ll take a new Willis record in whatever hue it comes, now that it’s been 11 years since her last solo release, 2007’s Translated from Love. The Austin-based singer/songwriter has hardly been MIA in the intervening years, having recorded and toured as part of a duo with Bruce Robison. But she’s setting the duet Mm.Oo. aside for do-it-alone mode, at least as far as the spotlight is concerned. (Robison hovers just outside it this time, as producer.). Hers is a solo voice again, but it’s not necessarily sotto voce: This is an album of songs about lonesomeness that also happens to be a cracklingly good time.\n\nWillis wrote six of the 10 tracks on Back Being Blue by herself, the first time she’s penned that big a portion of one of her albums without outside assists. That doesn’t mean she’s gone into deeply confessional territory for her “Blue” period.\n\nLyrically, “it’s not an extremely personal record,” she says, downright cheerfully. There may be profundity within, but what Willis was really after was a sense of playfulness. “I wanted to make a fun, interesting record that leans on the influences that first inspired me to make music,” she says. “I don’t think of it as even being so much about my vocals as an album about vibe.” Explaining, “The important thing to me was to take these songs and to get them just right musically. And in my mind, I was thinking of where maybe Skeeter Davis meets Rockpile, or Marshall Crenshaw meets the Louvin Brothers.”\n\nWho wouldn’t want to hang out at either of those intersections? Not ignoring the fact that in Willis’ world, as the album title might augur, high times and heartache are inextricably tied, “I guess the songs I write can be more sad than I think they are,” she admits with a laugh. “The lyrics are always sad in country music. I mean, we sometimes wonder why people hire us to do weddings. We’re like, ‘Really? You wanted this? Well, okay!’ But the music, more than ever, I think, is very fun.”\n\nThe title song, which brings a slight R&B vibe to her trademark country, was key in setting the tone. “When I wrote ‘Back Being Blue,’ I felt like I made a discovery,” she says. “Up until writing that song, my songs were all feeling a little bit wordy and complicated and personal, and they just weren’t clicking. Then I wrote that one, I just felt like, oh!­––what I need to do is try to simplify, and write these stories in a way that feels like you’re not quite sure what era they were written in.”\n\nShe makes it sound like a fresh epiphany, but some might say that sending the hands of the clock spinning––in a word: timelessness––has always been a hallmark of her career. As the New York Times wrote, “Kelly Willis looks back to country music before Nashville embraced power ballads and cute happily-ever-after songs. She has an old-fashioned country voice with a twang, a breathy quaver, a break or a throaty sob whenever she needs one… Whether she was wishing for comfort, admitting to a bruised heart, yielding to illicit romance or trying to say goodbye, her voice was modest and true, illuminating the delicate tension and pain in every line.” No Depression noted that her music transcends throwback appeal: “There’s no point in being nostalgic for the generic delineations of the past. We are in the present. That’s where Kelly Willis lives. And it’s there that she sings, as keenly and movingly as any singer in the country or pop or rock present.” Rolling Stone zeroed in on the eternality of her tone: “Willis’ Okie soprano still crackles like no other, and her control and phrasing make it more devastating than ever.”\n\nThe native Okie-ness Rolling Stone noticed in her honeyed voice is tempered by a whole lot of Texas. Romance and music brought her to Austin while she was in her late teens, fronting a celebrated but short-lived rockabilly band, Radio Ranch. Famed singer/songwriter Nancy Griffith took a shine to her voice and recommended Willis to producer Tony Brown, one of the titans of Nashville country, who signed her to a deal with MCA. Her three major -label albums yielded plenty of critical acclaim, with enough media attention that she even found herself representing for Texas on People magazine’s annual “50 most beautiful people” list. But, not for the first or last time, mainstream radio didn’t quite know what to make of a youthful neo-traditionalist who appeared to have been transported from a less trendy era.\n\nThen came the album that set the template for the second act of this American life: the 1999 Rykodisc release What I Deserve, her debut as an independent artist in all senses of the term.\n\n“I feel like I’ve never really quite fit into any one group,” Willis says. “I wasn’t really country enough to fit in with the Nashville mainstream, and I didn’t quite fit in with that alt-country stuff, either. But What I Deserve was a huge turning point, because that was the first time I was able to just do my record my way, and the first time I had really grown as an artist and was writing more songs and aware of how to get my ideas across musically. I also looked at that as potentially being my last record. I felt kind of washed up, which was a really strange place to be as a 25-year-old. But to accomplish that record and have it be so well -received gave me a lot of confidence. From then on, I knew I could continue to be a musician, and whatever it was going to look like, I was gonna make it up as I go along, and there could be real satisfaction in that.”\n\nThere were personal and creative detours to come. Easy (2002) and Translated by Love (2007) generated equal love from fans, the press, and fellow musicians. Meanwhile, motherhood competed for her attention, to put it mildly. “I had four babies in the space of five years. As challenging as work/family balance became, it led to a pleasing mid-career wrinkle when she backed into a side career with Robison, who conveniently happened to be not just her spouse but her creative and popular equal in the Americana world. A series of annual Christmas shows led to a holiday album, which led to two non-seasonal duo projects, Cheater’s Game (2013) and Our Year (2014).\n\n“We could feel this excitement and electricity at our performances together,” Willis says, “and so we finally just started doing that, even though we’d been keeping it at arm’s length, professionally. We just couldn’t deny it, and so we just decided to take a chance that it wouldn’t destroy our marriage,” she laughs. “But now it’s really important to both of us to get out there and do our own thing.”\n\nSo what did Willis do when it came time to reassert her artistic independence with Back Being Blue? Hire Robison as producer. “As I was going through the process, I realized he understood what I was trying to do, and that nobody cared more about how it turned out than he did. I didn’t have a bigger fan out there in the world.”\n\nChoosing Robison as her producer, ironically, made for a long commute to work each day as she was recording the album, since Robison’s studio, the Bunker, is on a rustic five-acre plot with a fishing hole 40 minutes south of Austin. But it was worth the daily drive, she figures: “It’s kind of its own vibe out there, and you can hear it, I think, in the recordings. It feels old school to me. It’s got a real reverb chamber, and we did it on analog tape with an old board;” — old enough that “ the tape machine broke down six times while we were recording, but he’s got a guy he talks to up in Nashville that walks him through fixing it every time.”\n\nThat analog mentality filters into “Modern World,” one of the few songs on the album less about single-gal dilemmas and more about where Willis is now. “I can’t put my phone down,” she admits. “I’m trying to keep it away from my kids, but I’m not able to keep it away from myself. When we used to not have the stuff, we were forced to be more engaged. I was thinking I wanted to write about that, but I wanted to write about that in maybe the Louvin Brothers would have written about it.” “Freewheeling” is about how “everybody wishes they could let go of their anxiety or some of those old, comfortable pains that won’t go away. And I think we always look around and see other people that seem to be able to handle everything much easier.”\n\nSources for the four outside songs range from Rodney Crowell, who recommended that Willis cut “We’ll Do It for Love Next Time” (from his 2003 album “Fate’s Right Hand”),. to Skeeter Davis, whose “I’m a Lover (Not a Fighter)” is the one pick you could pinpoint as being tied to a place in time, thanks to its lyrical reference to Cassius Clay. “We were trying to come up with other, more contemporary rhymes that might work there, like ‘Sugar Ray,’ but ultimately I liked the dated reference.”\n\nWillis is hardly ashamed of looking backward for touchstones. “With this record I was trying to go with the styles of music that have really impacted my life, especially when I moved to Austin as a teenager, and make it country-sounding like Austin used to sound,” she says.\n\n“Nick Lowe was a real north star for me on this record. ––Llike, ‘What would do Nick Lowe do?’ He was able to write modern songs that were like old songs—––that had a cool soul/R&B/Buddy Holly kind of a thing that had sounds from that early rock and roll era—––but that felt really fresh and exciting and now. I just love the A-B-C’s of rock and roll. Before everybody had to start piling on different things to make it sound different, it had all been done. With this record I was trying to go with the styles of music that have really impacted my life, especially when I moved to Austin as a teenager, and make it country-sounding like Austin used to sound.”\n\nNick Lowe may be Willis’ north star, but she’s been around just long enough to be a beacon for some acolytes of her own. That’s true even with appreciative fans from upstream in the generational river, like outlaw-era legend Ray Wylie Hubbard, who recently tweeted, “Kelly, you are the gold standard that I compare other artists to,” tTo which Kelly replied that she would put that in her bio.\n\n“I know I’ve been around through many different phases of my genre of music. Whether it was the New Traditionalist, or Alt. Country or Americana. I ought to be able to write a book about it all. But in spite of my long career, I still think of myself as a teenager! I still feel like the underdog who’s trying to find her way”\n\nThat Willis still feels like that scrappy young comer, six albums and four kids later, is good news for anyone about to take a shine to the only slightly broken-hearted-feeling spunk of the new album. Blue definitely continues to be her color, but more than anything, she’s back feeling new.\n\nWhen T Bone Burnett was making his new record The Other Side, he was thinking a lot about “you.”\n\n“I was reading a news story that some shocking percentage of number one hit songs had the word you in the title,” says the Oscar -and Grammy-winning composer-producer-songwriter well known for his work with everyone from Robert Plant and Alison Krauss to Brandi Carlile to Elton John and on iconic soundtracks including O Brother Where Art Thou and Walk the Line. Burnett started contemplating who all those “you”s are and what it means when an artist puts them in a song.\n\nBurnett says he realized that for many years, when he worked on his own solo albums as a singer-songwriter — in between acclaimed stints of coaxing the best work out of a wildly diverse set of artists as a producer or curating ideal soundtracks for an equally disparate group of films and series —he had been “tough” on listeners.\n\n“I view the purpose of art as creating conscience, so I was constantly appealing to people's consciences,” he says of a solo career that stretches back to the mid-‘70s and includes several well-reviewed albums including 1992’s The Criminal Under My Own Hat. “But I realized when a songwriter use the word you, he is, of course, in the world of conscience, but he’s also in the world of people's dreams. And when you enter into people's dreams, you have to be very careful with them.”\n\nAnd the man born Joseph Henry Burnett knows about the power of dreams. As a teenager, he had a recurring nightmare. He and other members of his Episcopal church were lined up around the walls of the parish hall where people’s right hands were being replaced with electronic tracking devices that could be controlled by shadowy black figures who lorded over a larger dystopian landscape.\n\n“As I was already playing guitar at that time, I would wake up in a cold sweat saying ‘I can't do this. I've got to get out of here!’” says Burnett, now 75, but still crystal clear on the details of the dystopia. That nightmare sent him off on a study of writers and philosophers, including Marshall McLuhan and Jacques Ellul, whose ideas about the ways in which technology threaten humanity would inform much of his work over the course of his career including, most recently, his sci-fi-oriented The Invisible Light series.\n\n“In the early 2000s, I walked into a coffee shop and saw everyone on their phones,” he recalls. “I realized, ‘Oh, they didn't have to cut our hands off. They just put the control device in our hands.’ I began going deeper and deeper into this dystopia until I decided several years ago that I wanted to write my way out of it which is how the Invisible Light project started.”\n\nBurnett often wondered what would happen if he ever did make it to freedom from the hellscape of that dream. Now he knows: The Other Side, a clutch of songs that reflect a new outlook and approach Burnett didn’t even know he was seeking and featuring old friends Rosanne Cash and early bandmate Steven Soles, newer artists Lucius and Weyes Blood, and longtime trusted musical companions including Dennis Crouch, Stuart Duncan, Jay Bellerose, and Rory Hoffman.\n\nThe album is a haunting 12-song collection that has a loose love story at its center following a couple that may no longer be of this plane. The mood is by turns eerie and spectral — the graveyard-set “Sometimes I Wonder” featuring Weyes Blood and the ghostly “Waiting For You,” one of several songs dusted with Lucius’ vocal magic — and suffused with both melancholy and playfulness — the warmly Cash-backed “(I’m Gonna Get Over This) Some Day” and the catchy couplets of “Everything and Nothing,” co-written with Gary Nicholson and inspired by the witty, economic wordplay of Broadway genius Frank Loesser. The album also features some of the richest vocals of Burnett’s entire career, as he deploys a more melodic tone throughout, creating a new accessibility where he had previously been more idiosyncratic.\n\nCo-produced by Colin Linden — whose Nashville studio served as home base — and Mike Piersante, in that high-fidelity fashion for which Burnett is known that makes you feel like you are in the room with the band as they make their way through the songs like the dreamy, Orbisonian ballad “Hawaiian Blue Song,” featuring Soles, Burnett calls The Other Side a country blues album. That rootsiness is quite the 180 from the mechanized electronics of the Invisible Light records from 2019 and 2022.\n\nWhile at work on the planned third installment in that series, Burnett says, “I invented some people called ‘the listeners’ who were able to hear pure tone, and therefore were able to distinguish, for instance, between an AI voice and a human voice. They were able to distinguish between fact and faction. Inventing those people and finding tone as the way through this dystopia, the way through the lies, I found a hole in the dystopia that I was able to pass through. And when I passed through that hole, all of these songs on this record started pouring in.”\n\nHe set aside the Invisible Light project as songs from The Other Side arrived, seemingly unbidden, as he played some new guitars he had recently bought.\n\n“I had to record them because I loved them,” says Burnett who attributes the variance in his vocals to his discovery of a new tone for himself.\n\n“I shifted from writing in my head to writing in my chest, and I shifted from singing in my head to singing in my chest because I realized my tone had been in service of this complete other drama that I was living in,” he says. “But now that I had escaped the dystopia, a whole other world opened up to me and it was thrilling to just have a melody come out of a guitar. There were all these songs in these guitars. And they just came all at once, over probably a three-week period.”\n\nHe augmented this musical bounty on the other side of the nightmare with a few songs that he had been tinkering with, including “Town That Time Forgot,” co-written with Peter More for a theatrical project, “Hawaiian Blue Song,” which dates back to the mid-‘70s, and the mythical album opener “He Came Down” which was inspired by Burnett’s wife, the Oscar-winning screenwriter-director-producer Callie Khouri (Thelma & Louise, Nashville).\n\n“That was just an ad-lib trying to explain something to her about folk music one morning at the kitchen table and Callie said, ‘record that right now.’ She knew,” says Burnett, of his partner’s keen instincts. “In a way all the songs are about Callie, because I have to say, she's a very loving woman,” he says. “I’m so grateful to her for the way she's opened me up to the possibilities of love.”\n\nThose possibilities extended to two other parties: his audience, of the “you” outside of himself to whom he wanted to be more inclusive and, crucially himself. Burnett sought to care for himself as an artist in the same manner he has helped shepherd so many others in the studio.\n\n“With this record, I tried to treat myself as kindly as I would try to treat other people,” says Burnett, who likens his producing approach to that of a photographer. “I try to find the person's best angle and light them so they look the most like themselves or the best version of themselves. And this time, rather than staying in the romantic notion I previously had of myself—of a rebellious artist, a firebrand or whatever I thought I was trying to be—I just tried to be kind to myself.”\n\nUltimately, in looking for “you,” T Bone Burnett found himself on The Other Side.\n\nTexas Female Artist of the Decade, Bri Bagwell, is a force to be reckoned with on the Texas Country scene. Bri has seen her audience grow and diversify as she has progressed through the musical landscape. From her first full-length release, Banned from Santa Fe in 2011, to her 2022 release Corazón y Cabeza (Heart and Head) Bri has masterfully commanded the stage for over a decade with her rousingly fun live performances and trailblazing artistry while creating a loyal and passionate fan base.\n\nBri grew up in Las Cruces, NM but now lives in New Braunfels, TX. From the time she was writing poems in her childhood bedroom, to teaching herself how to play a dusty old piano, to getting her first taste of honky-tonk life singing in her twin brothers’ band at age 14, to playing her first solo show in college, Bri has integrated music into each stage of her life.\n\nAfter high school, jumping at the chance to live in ‘The Live Music Capital of the World’, Bri attended the University of Texas in Austin. It was here that Bri picked up a guitar and quickly learned to play a few chords. She jokes, “because it was easier to carry than a piano.” Finding herself in the right city with a new passion for the 6-string life surrounded by fellow musicians, Bri was drawn to the stage.\n\nFollowing graduation Bri worked with a startup company in Austin where she utilized her marketing major. But she began playing shows so frequently, she found herself needing to choose between her day job and her dream. After just three months, Bri knew what she had to do and transitioned full time into her music career. With nine #1 songs in Texas and multiple Female Vocalist of the Year awards to her credit, it is clear she made the right choice.\n\nA talent as tremendous as Bri’s has begun to garner national attention. People Magazine recently premiered her new record saying, “Bri Bagwell finds the path to her own heart on new album Corazón y Cabeza...[Bagwell] is increasingly finding her name being mentioned amongst country music truth tellers such as Ashley McBryde and Morgan Wade.”\n\nBri’s musical influences have all played a part in her musical evolution; from Johnny Cash to Dwight Yoakum, Miranda Lambert to George Strait, their spirits live within her songs. While on the road, she has shared the stage with some of the best: Willie Nelson, Miranda Lambert, Gary Alan, Dwight Yoakum, Randy Rogers, Robert Earl Keen, Wade Bowen just to name a few.\n\nPlaying over 150 shows in back-to-back years, Bagwell is no stranger when it comes to hard work. Fresh off the release of her new record, she is already writing new music alongside planning tour dates to some of her favorite venues. When asked about life on the road, Bri responds, “it’s in my blood.” Be on the lookout for new show announcements for 2023.\n\n--\n\nEvery time he steps on stage, Dallas Burrow dedicates a portion of his set to telling a story about his dad. The New Braunfels native has music in his blood, and he likes to share some of that history. One of his favorite stories to tell is about a night in Nashville in the early 70s, when Burrow’s father, Mike Burrow, was hosting Richard Dobson, John Lomax III, and Townes Van Zandt at a pub he ran with his siblings on Elliston Place near the old Exit/In. After a late night shutting down the bar, the foursome hit an after party, where Van Zandt insisted they all become blood brothers to ensure they’d be forever cosmically linked. Everyone agreed, and perhaps through some mystical, intangible power that often propels so much music, Van Zandt’s style has been transfused into Burrow more than any other artist. After telling the story around that night in Nashville, Burrow can’t help but play at least one Townes song during his sets. As he began writing his stellar new LP, Blood Brothers, Burrow’s friend and producer, Jonathan Tyler, encouraged him to finally turn that touching tribute to his dad into a song. That stirring track became the guiding light and philosophy of his 2023 album of the same name, which is to pay homage to his musical roots, while honoring his familial duties as a husband and father.\n\nOn the searching, emotive title track, heavy and bold guitar notes interact with a loosely strummed acoustic riff and a star-gazing pedal steel line that give the song an infectious melody. Burrow, in his deep, Cash-like baritone, sings, “Daddy had a scar you wouldn’t believe, like a story he kept up his sleeve/ Sixteen years it took to hear that tale.” While Burrow does a lovely and poetic job setting up the story, it’s the next line that flips the perspective from his father’s world to that of his own: “He said it never would have happened if it weren’t for the booze.” Burrow, on “Blood Brothers,” examines his father’s history, but the true power in the song lies in the effortless translation of his dad’s tale in his own voice. As a four year sober songwriter, Burrow brings a clarity to the song that wasn’t available to him before he got clean. “In the past few years, after spending a lot of my twenties traveling around, being a nomad, I got married and had a son, and my son is now six years old. I got sober. I’m just a different person,” he explains.\n\nIn this context, Blood Brothers takes on a different meaning. It suggests that Burrow’s relationship to his lineage and familial history isn’t only related to the past, but bridges generations and guides the world he’s built with his own family. Reaching back into history–even covering one of his dad’s own tunes on the record–Burrow looks forward with pride and excitement. “On this record, I wanted to tell the story of my musical roots, starting with my dad and his influence as a songwriter and the artists he raised me on: Townes, Guy Clark, Billy Joe Shaver, and Willis Alan Ramsey,” he explains. “I also wanted to tell the story of my own personal journey and reframe for myself what it means to be a singer-songwriter.” Burrow realized there’s another way; you don’t need to be a night owl boozehound to be an amazing songwriter. There are plenty of ways to tell your story in the daylight. “From my perspective in this day and age, you don't have to sacrifice your whole life and your body, living hard in order to create good music and be a real artist. On Blood Brothers, I'm paying homage to tradition while at the same time embracing what is also important to me in my life as a family man, a present father modeling a healthier lifestyle for my son.”\n\nEven if Dallas Burrow hasn’t always been a positive, forward-looking songwriter, he clearly demonstrates his energetic progression in “Blood Brothers.” Take “Out My Window,” the fourth song and another standout from the album; the honky tonk-blues flavored number cruises along with a slick Stax-inspired horn section and a Wurlitzer piano that conjures the heyday of Muscle Shoals, with Burrow employing his best Dr. John voice, as he sings, “Look out my window and what do I see?/ Things are even stranger than they look on TV/ I’ve got to believe things are gonna be alright/ When my children lay their heads down at night.” This is an anthem for optimists, the musical embodiment of putting good energy into the world in hopes of receiving it in return.\n\nThese are stories that are deeply personal to Dallas and his life as a husband and father, yet he sings with a relatability and universality that turns these diary entries into relatable anthems. This is an album for anyone looking for a little bit of hope during these downtrodden times, for people struggling but not buried, willing to pick themselves back up.\n\nBurrow felt his own faith in music revived last year while playing Luckenbach for the first time, the famous venue outside of Fredericksburg, Texas. It’s a rite of passage for Lone Star musicians, so it was a special night for Burrow. Towards the end of his set, he invited his dad on stage to perform a song together. With his wife and son in the crowd and his father beside him on stage, the moment was so special, he had to concentrate all his energy on getting through the song. During a spare moment, though, he managed to look towards his father and say with a big grin, “Man…how cool is this?” For Burrow, it was the literal representation of Blood Brothers right in front of his eyes: His musical influence on stage next to him, and his present and future singing along from the audience.\n\nFor Jon Muq, a singer-songwriter born in Uganda and now living in Austin, Texas, music is part of a larger conversation he’s having with the world and everybody in it. Drawing from African as well as western musical trends and traditions, he devises songs as small gifts, designed to settle into everyday life and provoke reflection and resilience. “These days the world is sad,” he explains, “so I wanted to make happy songs. I wanted to write songs that connected with the listener in a very personal way. When someone listens to my music, it’s not just about me and what I’m singing. It’s about how they understand the songs individually. I think these songs can speak many languages, depending on what you want from them.\n\nMuq’s experiences as a child in Uganda and as a man in America give him a unique perspective on the world he’s addressing. “I grew up in a very different life, where so many people pass through hard times just because they don’t have much. Our biggest issue was food scarcity. Then I came to a different world, which gave me a picture of how to write a song that can find balance with everyone wherever they are, whether they have a lot or not much.” As he completes his debut with producer Dan Auerbach and tours with Billy Joel, Norah Jones, Mavis Staples, Amythyst Kiah, Corinne Bailey Rae, and others, Muq is expanding the scope of his music to speak to more and more people.\n\nHe has nursed his obsession with music for as long as he can remember. “When I was 7, I realized there was something about sound that I appreciated. We had a brass band at school that would play the school anthem, and I would sit between the horn players and it was so loud. I loved it. People would ask, Who is this strange boy up there with the band?” Later, he joined the group playing bugle, but was dismayed when he graduated and learned that his new school did not have a band. But it did have voices filling the hallways, which excited him. At night he would lay in his dormitory bed listening to those harmonies, eventually summoning the nerve to sneak out and track them down. He searched the three-story building until he found the choir room, and the group soon adopted the curious child as a mascot, giving him homemade shakers to play. “I joined the choir but didn’t sing. I was just following sound.”\n\nDuring holidays, he would stay with a cousin in Kampala, cleaning house and working odd jobs to earn extra money. During one of those visits, the teenage Muq saw a CD that caught his attention: We Are the World. “I played it and was astounded. Where are these people singing very differently yet all singing the same song? I’m taking this CD. I didn’t even ask him. I just took it. I listened to it for a long time and I mastered all the vocals and tones of the people who were singing. That was my first exposure to modern western music, and it was fascinating to me.” It was a good lesson for him, as mimicking and mastering the vocals of such a disparate array of artists—from Michael Jackson to Cyndi Lauper to Kenny Rogers—expanded the expressive range of his voice.\n\nIt also taught Muq to write songs in English. “Since Uganda has 45 tribes, it has more than 45 languages. People sing in their own languages. My language is Luganda, but I have always sung in English.” In fact, he penned his first song as a love letter in English: “A friend of mine was going through a relationship problem. They were breaking up. He spoke English but could not write it, so I told him, I can write a letter for you to change her mind. And it worked! The girl was so happy, and she kept the letter.” Muq decided to make that his first song, so he asked his friend to steal the letter back so he could copy it. It eventually became “Always as One,” and “it’s still the song I start my shows with.” In addition to pursuing his creative endeavors, Muq has continued to devote time to charitable organizations in both Uganda and the U.S., working with non-profits and community programs that provide education, food, clothing, and support to those in need.\n\nMuq would spend hours walking around the village of Mutungo at night and singing western songs. Residents would peek through fences trying to catch a glimpse of the mysterious singer, much as he had done with the school choir, but Muq nervously remained in the shadows. During one of his roaming concerts, he made a discovery that changed his life as much as We Are the World did. “One evening I was walking and singing and I heard someone playing an instrument. It sounded familiar, but also new. Two men were out in their yard performing songs for church, and I just sat there and watched. I was 18 or 19 years old, and this was my first time to see a guitar in my life. I had seen them on TV, of course, but seeing one in person was different. When I saw it, it just made sense to me. When I held it, it just made sense. I knew that this was going to answer so many questions I had about music and the western world.\n\nMuq taught himself to play guitar on his new friend’s instrument, eventually borrowing it for a regular gig at a local hotel. Even after a long shift, he would walk home playing and singing, and a video of him serenading homeless children on the streets of Kampalaled to a stint as an entertainer on Norwegian Cruise Line. That experience not only refined his repertoire but helped him secure a passport and visa. “They saw the vide and asked me if I wanted to sing on a boat. But this like a city on the water. I couldn’t believe it would float. My friends thought the pictures I showed them had been Photoshopped.” He admits there was no grand plan to his career, no strategy or roadmap. “I never expected it to work this way. I never said, I’m going to get a job at a hotel. I’m going to get a job on a cruise line. I’m going to work with Dan Auerbach. Everything happened because I was following sound. I was chasing it. I was just singing.”\n\nOn the seas and later in America, he developed a curious approach to writing songs. “I don’t sit down and say, I’m going to write a song now. Most times someone will be talking to me and I’m playing the guitar at the same time. For some reason, my brain can listen to both things at the same time, and I’ll come up with a melody or a phrase, or just an idea. It’s amazing how many songs I’ve written when someone else is talking and I’m just holding my guitar. Even in the studio with Dan, we would be talking about songs or just hanging out, and I would be playing my guitar and coming up with new songs.” That’s how he wrote many of the songs on his upcoming debut, including the plaintive, yet hopeful, “One You Love.” “I wanted to have a relationship with someone but it didn’t work out. This song describes how someone has brought something great into your life, even if they don’t stay in your life. It was not a happy experience, but that didn’t stop me from writing something positive. I wrote it and sang it very slow, but Dans said it could be quick and dancey. It sounds great that way.”\n\nMuq currently calls Austin home, but he’s on the road more than he’s in Texas, touring frequently and bringing his sunny songs to audiences of all kinds. “When I arrived in America, I was coming from a different part of the world, and I was very lost. I didn’t have a plan. I didn’t know what was coming tomorrow. I just following instinct. I always thought, If I can communicate with people through music, it will make me feel like I am not alone. I can speak to people very intimately using music.”\n\nORDINARY ELEPHANT\n\n“This album is the purest distillation of our sound that we’ve ever captured,” says Crystal Damore, one half of the husband/wife folk duo Ordinary Elephant. “It’s just the two of us singing and performing live, losing ourselves in each other and the songs.”\n\nGiven how raw and vulnerable the results are, it’s easy to see why the band chose to self-title their stunning new collection. Recorded in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, with producer/multi-instrumentalist Dirk Powell (Joan Baez, Levon Helm), Ordinary Elephant showcases the arresting chemistry shared by Crystal and her husband, Pete, whose gorgeous harmonies and mesmerizing fretwork call to mind everything from Gillian Welch and David Rawlings to Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris. The songs are timeless here, rooted in rich, character-driven storytelling, and the performances are similarly transportive, fueled by delicately intertwined banjo, guitar, and octave mandolin parts that wrap like vines around the duo’s captivating vocal delivery. Though the songs were born out of a period of change and deep uncertainty, the record itself is a work of profound self-assurance, one delivered by a duo whose personal and professional lives embody the limitless possibility of honest, organic collaboration. Press play on Ordinary Elephant and you’ll hear more than just a couple singing together; you’ll hear the sound of sincerity and commitment, of patience and gratitude, of learning to let go of expectation and revel in the simple beauty of the moment.\n\n“I think a big part of our growth on this album came from finally having a permanent place to call home,” Crystal reflects. “After years of living on the road, we settled down in Opelousas, Louisiana, about thirty minutes from where I grew up, and it really helped us slow down and feel more grounded and appreciative of the things that were right in front of us.”\n\nWhen Crystal and Pete talk about living on the road, they mean it quite literally. After walking away from established careers in veterinary cardiology and computer programming, the pair moved into an RV in 2014 and began touring relentlessly, earning widespread acclaim with the kind of riveting performances that soon made fans of luminaries like Tom Paxton and Mary Gauthier. In 2017, the duo took home the International Folk Music Award for Artist of the Year on the strength of their breakout album, Before I Go. Two years later, they returned with the similarly lauded Honest, which the Associated Press hailed as “one of the best Americana albums of the year” and PopMatters called “one of the best folk duo records in recent memory.”\n\nFive years of perpetual touring took its toll, though, and after the release of Honest, the couple began looking to plant more solid roots.\n\n“At first we thought Opelousas would just be a place we could slow down and catch our breath between tours,” Pete explains. “When the pandemic hit, though, everything changed.”\n\nThe band was on tour in Australia at the time, and, after rushing to get home before border closures and lockdowns froze the world in place, they found themselves sitting still for the first time in recent memory. The change of pace was challenging at first, both emotionally and creatively, but thanks in part to several remote songwriting groups, the inspiration began flowing more freely and intensely than ever before.\n\n“We realized how much we turn to stories for comfort in times of uncertainty,” Crystal reflects, “and this was the most uncertainty a lot of us had ever experienced. The songs became something we could hang onto, something to anchor us.”\n\nIn addition to songs, Crystal found herself writing poems, as well, penning dozens of pieces that were inextricably linked to the music. (A book of poetry will accompany the album’s release, and the fourth side of the double LP will feature Crystal reading poems paired with each of the record’s fourteen tracks.)\n\n“Poetry feels like the place that a lot of our songs grow from,” she explains. “The two forms have always been closely related for me, and they end up feeding each other.”\n\nWhen it came time to record, Crystal and Pete headed roughly forty minutes south to Breaux Bridge, where Powell (who’d introduced himself after catching the band at Nashville’s Station Inn during AmericanaFest) welcomed them into his Cypress House studio on the banks of Bayou Teche.\n\n“We went into the sessions with an open mind because Dirk’s so versatile on so many instruments that we figured he’d end up contributing in that way to many of the songs,” Pete recalls. “But after he captured the two of us playing everything live over the course of five or six days, he played it all back for us and said, ‘I really don’t think it needs anything else.’ It was kind of a scary thought at first, to put ourselves out there in such a raw way, but pretty quickly we realized he was right.”\n\nThe power of those stripped-down, intimate recordings is obvious from the outset on Ordinary Elephant, which begins with the bittersweet “Once Upon A Time.” Like much of the album, it’s a subtle, engrossing tune, building steadily with a gentle but relentless insistence. “Truth is not something we can choose,” Crystal and Pete sing, repeating the phrase like a mantra as they set the stage for a record built around unguarded reflections on loss and death, romance and discovery, purpose and nature. The slow-burning “Say It Loud” offers a candid look at depression and the power of human connection, while “The Prophet” explores the importance of self-love through the pages of a book, and the pensive “Hardwood” finds peace in accepting our place in the natural world.\n\n“With all that time off the road, we got used to having the space to think, to reconnect with the Earth,” Crystal reflects. “When things started picking up again in 2021, we had to remind ourselves to intentionally slow down, to remember who we are and where we belong.”\n\nThough several of the songs here are delivered from the perspective of outside characters, it isn’t hard to find Crystal and Pete in the lyrics: the intoxicating “Walk With You” overflows with gratitude for a lover’s companionship; the jaunty “Midlife” reckons with aging and mortality in the wake of turning forty during the first year of the pandemic; and the lilting “I See You” charts a journey of self-discovery through newfound sobriety as the singer addresses her future self. It’s perhaps the airy “Joy Has Not Forgotten Me,” though, that best encapsulates the record (and the couple), finding solace in even the most difficult of times.\n\n“Joy is always there if you’re willing to work for it,” Crystal explains, “and it feels like that notion is at the heart of who we are as a band. We always tell people we named ourselves Ordinary Elephant because there’s no such thing as an ordinary elephant. Every single one is just this amazing, magnificent creature. And all of the everyday things we take for granted in life have a whole lot more to them, too, if you take the time to look.”\n\nIn the end, that’s what Ordinary Elephant is all about. By stripping away everything but themselves and their songs, Crystal and Pete zero in on the kind of tiny details that might otherwise go unnoticed, on the magic and the beauty hiding in plain sight. They turn the ordinary into the extraordinary.\n\n--\n\nJana Pochop (the ‘h’ is silent):​\n\nSinger-songwriter Jana Pochop is a wanderer with a penchant for folk pop songs and universe pondering. Jana hails from the culturally rich Albuquerque, NM and moved to Austin to immerse herself in the Texas music scene, playing clubs, house concerts, and touring nationally while building her singer-songwriter career. She was a Kerrville New Folk Finalist in 2022 and then headed off to New York City to earn a Master's in Songwriting and Production at Berklee NYC. She's currently based in Albuquerque, producing her own music as well as projects for others remotely and at Howlin' Dog Studio in Alamosa, CO. ​\n\nJana is set to release her first self-produced album, Powerlines, in Spring of 2024. Produced mainly in her Brooklyn room while studying at Berklee, Jana was also able to incorporate Impulse Response Collection into her thesis along with songwriting and production. This focus resulted in Jana spending a day at Georgia O'Keeffe's Home and Studio in Abiquiu, NM in early 2023. Jana captured the distinctive reverberations of O'Keeffe's painting studio, living room, and bedroom, infusing them into the sonic tapestry of her upcoming album.​\n\nHer 2022 critically acclaimed album, The Astronaut, was named alongside albums by Texas icons like Lizzo, Beyoncé, and Lyle Lovett as one of Texas Music Magazine’s “22 Top Albums of 2022”. She was thrilled to collaborate with musical heroes like Sean Hutchinson of Bleachers, Lloyd Maines (The Chicks), Don Dixon (R.E.M.), and Grammy nominated songwriter Eliza Gilkyson. As one review put it, \"Jana consistently paints an image of humanity that’s unusual yet accessible, fusing the vastness of the world with the deeply personal emotions of the individual in a blissfully poetic and moving fashion.\"\n\n\"Calling Jana Pochop a “songwriter” is like calling Gandalf a guy who can throw together a nice fireworks display for a birthday party.\" - Texas Music Magazine\n\nDark Enough To See The Stars\n\n“Writing helps me sort out confusion, untangle powerful emotions, and\n\nward off desperation. It helps me navigate the powerful emotional\n\nweather systems of life.”\n\n– Mary Gauthier, Saved by a Song: The Art and Healing Power of Songwriting\n\nAs she has so eloquently accomplished over the past 25 years, acclaimed singer-songwriter Mary Gauthier has used her art once again to traverse the uncharted waters of the past few years. “I’m the kind of songwriter who writes what I see in the world right now,” she affirms. Thankfully, amid dark storms of pandemic loss, she found and followed the beacon of new love: Her gift to us, the powerful Dark Enough to See the Stars, collects ten sparkling jewels of Gauthier songcraft reflecting both love and loss.\n\nHer eleventh album, Dark Enough to See the Stars, follows the profound antidote to trauma, Rifles & Rosary Beads, her 2018 collaborative work with wounded Iraq war veterans. It garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album, as well as a nomination for Album of the Year by the Americana Music Association. Publication of her first book, the illuminating Saved by a Song: The Art and Healing Power of Songwriting, in 2021, brought her more praise. Brandi Carlile has said, “Mary’s songwriting speaks to the tender aspects of our humanness. We need her voice in times like these more than we ever have.” The Associated Press called Gauthier “one of the best songwriters of her generation.”\n\nGauthier’s early work, which began at 35, reflected her newfound sobriety, delving into events from a troubled life, which persisted after she became a renowned chef in Boston. Dark Enough to See the Stars returns Gauthier to the scintillating confessional mode on such albums as her breakthrough release, 2005’s Mercy Now, as well as such ear worms as the hook-laden “Drag Queens in Limousines.” In addition to crafting instantly memorable songs, Gauthier has never shied away from difficult self-exploration, as with 2010’s The Foundling, on which she explored the repercussions of her adoption from a New Orleans orphanage and subsequent search for her birth mother.\n\nOn Dark Enough to See the Stars, she mourns recent devastating losses: the deaths of John Prine, David Olney, Nanci Griffith, and her beloved friend Betsy. But she also sings open-heartedly of love. All ten tracks prove Gauthier’s belief, as stated in Saved by a Song, that “songs can bring us a deep understanding of each other and ourselves and open the heart to love.”\n\nDeep emotion resonates throughout Dark Enough to See the Stars. “It kicks off with three love songs,” says Gauthier. “Somewhere along the work I’ve done in therapy through art and 32 years of recovery, I’ve somehow stabilized enough to be in a relationship that works – and I want to express that in these songs.” The joyous triad – the catchy “Fall Apart World,” the lilting ballad “Amsterdam,” and gospel-tinged “Thank God for You” – each punctuated with Danny Mitchell’s evocative keyboards – comes alive with poetic imagery.\n\n“Thank God for You” contrasts her former life – “another junkie jonesing on a Greyhound bus” – with the state of grace she’s found. Lush instrumentation perfectly underpins the anthemic “Fall Apart World,” which Gauthier calls “adult music.” While on a writing sojourn in Key West, she explains, “It’s understanding that things come together and things fall apart. The awareness of that is an opportunity for gratitude. Right now, I’m looking out the window – and I can’t believe I get to be here! I don’t take it for granted for one millisecond!”\n\nGauthier’s partner, Jaimee Harris, who sings harmony throughout the album, co-wrote the paean to one of Gauthier’s favorite cities. “I have a long history with Amsterdam,” Gauthier recounts. “My first record deal was on a Dutch label, and I tour there regularly, and much of Mercy Now was written at my favorite hotel there.” A canceled flight to Denmark landed Gauthier and Harris in Amsterdam for an unexpected three days during the pandemic. “To return to that hotel and be able to share that with the person I love and show her the city…,” Gauthier pauses. “It’s complicated – because all around the edges was the pandemic. But you’ve got to express your joy – a joy that’s not free from pain. There’s grief all around us, but there’s this ability to still love and still be aware that the sky is beautiful and the hand that I’m holding is filled with love…”\n\nThe album’s bittersweet title track, “Dark Enough to See the Stars,” cowritten with Beth Nielsen Chapman, resonates with that very same emotion. “When things get really hard and the walls are closing in and it starts to get dark, you realize what really matters,” Gauthier says. “And what really matters, of course, is love. Even though my friend Betsy is gone, I get to hold on to her love. And I get to hold on to the love that John Prine showed me, and Nanci Griffith and David Olney. It occurred to me while working on the title track that love didn’t die with them. That was a gift that was given to me that I get to keep.”\n\nAs on the memory-rich track, “The Meadow,” Fats Kaplin’s haunting pedal steel guitar expresses the sonics of fleeting time, a theme Gauthier explores on one of the first songs written for the album, back in 2019. After performing in Albany, New York, the solitary troubadour found herself yearning for her newly discovered soulmate’s “candlestick fingers on my skin”: The poignant “About Time” documents that lonesome highway, while the singalong waltz “Truckers and Troubadours” acknowledges musical vagabonds’ kinship with long-haulers; in fact, Gauthier and co-writer Darden Smith collaborated with Paul “Long Haul” Marhoefer on the ear-catching lyrics. “Paul said that when Darden and I get together and start talking,” says Gauthier, “we sound like two truck drivers.”\n\nFinally, Dark Enough to See the Stars bids farewell to Gauthier’s tragically departed friends: “Where Are You Now” paints an autumnal picture of the trails where she and Betsy roamed; “How Could You Be Gone” expresses in detail the disbelief inherent in our goodbyes; and “Til I See You Again” offers a prayer “to all those I hope to reunite with,” says Gauthier.\n\nAs throughout Dark Enough to See the Stars, all three compositions exemplify Mary Gauthier’s songwriting brilliance: They offer beauty in sorrow, healing in loss, and a perspective only an artist of uncommon generosity can give. Thank God for Mary Gauthier.\n\n--\n\nJaimee Harris turned 30 during the pandemic. It’s a milestone that is a rite of passage even during normal times. But for this Texas-born singer-songwriter, it came in the midst of one of the strangest and most tumultuous periods in American history. When the world stopped during lockdown, Harris, like many others, found herself gazing back into the past, ruminating on the nature of her hometown and family origins, and reckoning with their imprint on her. The term ‘nostalgia’ derives from the Greek words nostos (return) and algos (pain), and if Harris’s Boomerang Town can be regarded as a nostalgic album, it is only nostalgic in the sense that the longing for home is a desire to return to the past and heal old wounds.\n\n“I’m at an age where I’m wrestling with trying to understand the nature of my family,” Harris says. “There’s been suicide, suicide ideation, and there’s certainly been addiction all through my family. My dad’s father died of suicide when he was 25 and I was 5. I couldn’t imagine not having my dad right now.”\n\nHarris’s sophomore effort, Boomerang Town marks a bold step forward for this country-folk-leaning singer-songwriter. It is an arresting, ambitious song-cycle that explores the generational arc of family, the stranglehold of addiction, and the fragile ties that bind us together as Americans.\n\nFor Harris, the album began gestating around 2016, a time of great loss for many in the Americana community, with the songwriter losing several musicians close to her. The shift in the nation’s political landscape had ushered in a new level of polarization that saw whole swaths of cultural life being demonized. For someone who grew up in a small town outside of Waco, Harris believed the values instilled in her by her parents were not entirely in line with how many on the left were viewing — and vilifying — Christians, citing them as responsible for the new change in leadership. As a person in recovery, Harris has had to re-evaluate her own connection to faith and find strength in a higher power (“Though he’s not necessarily a blue-eyed Jesus,” she laughs), though she certainly knows what it’s like to “be told how to vote” in a Southern church setting.\n\nIt was from the intersection of these social, personal, and political currents the album was born. And while much of the material on Boomerang Town was inspired by personal experience, the songs on this collection are far from autobiographical xeroxed copies. More than anything, they come from a place of emotional truth.\n\nBoomerang Town traces the fortunes of a host of characters who live on the knife’s edge between hope and despair. The title track, whose sound recalls the best of Mary Chapin Carpenter’s ’90s work, features a young couple from a small-town working dead-end jobs who get “knocked up” and have their dreams put on hold. It is a portrait of rural desperation and the restless search for salvation against long odds. “This is what it’s like to be a part of the post- “‘Born To Run’ Generation,” Harris quips. “Springsteen’s generation had somewhere to run to. I’m not so sure mine does.” For the characters in these songs, escape isn’t always a matter of geographical distance.\n\n“I tried a lot of perspectives [on this one],” Harris says about writing the title track. “My parents are high-school sweethearts and I was an accident and they’re still happily married. I worked at Wal-Mart when I was 19. I reflected on this guy who was the brother of a good friend of mine. He didn’t drop out. He knocked up his girlfriend and went into the military. Certainly [the song] is a combination of me and not me. It was me thinking about what might have gone differently for my parents, who are still in Waco and own a business there.”\n\nHarris’s father, whom she counts as a big supporter and responsible for much of her musical education, took her to the first Austin City Limits Music Festival, where she had the life-changing, Eureka moment of seeing Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin, and Buddy and Julie Miller perform on stage at the same time. It was then the young Harris knew what she had to do. She had found her ticket out.\n\nHarris continues: “Why was I able to get out of my boomerang town? Why are others stuck there, longing to leave but unable to find their way out? Writing these songs, bringing these narrators to life, brought me closer to the answers,” she says.\n\nThemes of grief and addiction permeate other sections of the record. “How Could You Be Gone,” which Harris wrote with her partner, the venerable folk songwriter Mary Gauthier, reflects on the passing of a close friend during the pandemic, as well as the 2017 death of Harris’s mentor and compadre Jimmy LaFave, a long-time fixture on the Americana scene who succumbed to cancer. “It’s been my experience that grief operates on its own timeline,” Harris says. “I wanted this track to build and repeat with intensity to mirror the experience of relentless grief.” Another song, “Fall (Devin’s Song),” is about a former childhood classmate of Harris’s who was accidentally shot and killed in the sixth grade. The song was inspired by a series of “In Memoriam” pieces the boy’s mother wrote to the local paper, and the song serves as a tribute to both of them, as well as a commentary on the timeless nature of grief.\n\nOne of the album’s standout tracks is the lilting, Irish-influenced “The Fair And Dark Haired Lad,” a Chicks type-number that grapples with the seductive nature of alcohol. Another tune that deals with the demon rum, “Sam’s,” is far more dirge-like, and its dark, circular melody mirrors the claustrophobia and sense of trapping that comes with the onset of addiction and mental collapse.\n\nBoomerang Town is not entirely a lament, however, with songs like “Love is Gonna Come Again” and the wistful “Missing Someone” shining with hope in the face of the darkness. For this is a record that understands that love and grief are two sides of the same coin. It also announces the arrival of a great new songwriter on the scene.\n\n“My goal is to just write the best possible song I can write,” Harris says, “and I wanted to have ten songs that made sense together sonically. I still believe in the album format, and I wanted to lay the groundwork as a solid songwriter.” On Boomerang Town, Jaimee Harris, who was able to find her way out — unlike so many others — has accomplished all that, and much more.\n\nDoors @ 7:00pm\n\nShow @ 8:00pm\n\nAll Ages\n\nFull Bar\n\nFree On-Site Parking\n\nFor Suzy Bogguss, life is all about connection.\n\nShe's a living legend of country music, having earned eight Top 10 hits throughout the 1990s\n\nbefore exploring new influences — including jazz, western swing, and the Bakersfield sound —\n\nduring the 21st century. From Grammy Award-winning performances to platinum-selling\n\nrecords, Suzy has proudly called her own shots for four decades, earning her stripes as a\n\nsinger-songwriter, producer, and road warrior along the way.\n\nMost importantly, she's maintained strong relationships with her friends and fans, from the\n\nsoup nights she regularly hosts at her Tennessee home — evenings that feature not only food,\n\nbut also jam sessions between dinner guests like Tommy Emmanuel, Keb’ Mo’, and Sam Bush\n\n— to her weekly livestream, \"Wine Down Wednesday.\" Launched in 2020, those livestreams\n\nstrengthened Suzy's bond with her audience during the Covid era, giving her the inspiration\n\nand confidence to create new newest album, Prayin' For Sunshine.\n\n\"This is the first time I've written my whole album,\" says Suzy, who found herself at home in\n\n2020, her touring schedule brought to a halt by the pandemic. The previous years had found\n\nher releasing themed records like American Folk Songbook (a collection of folk standards) and\n\nLucky (a tribute to Merle Haggard). Both albums were well-received, but Suzy couldn't help\n\nfeeling like something was missing. \"I was asking myself, 'Does anyone really want to hear\n\nwhere I'm at right now?'\" she remembers. \"Then we had the lockdown and I got so close to\n\nthe people who watched my livestreams every week, and I learned that they didn't want to just\n\nhear the songs they already knew. They wanted new music. All of a sudden, I got the\n\nconfidence to make a new record of my own songs. It was like someone lit a fire under me.\"\n\nThat fire burns brightly on Prayin' For Sunshine. Recorded at Suzy's home, the album offers a\n\nmix of southern storytelling, gorgeous vocals, and organic instrumentation that showcases her\n\ncountry and Americana roots. It's an eclectic and emotional project, with Suzy's sharp\n\nsongwriting balanced by spontaneous performances from the band. Highlights include \"Paint\n\nthe Town Blue\" (a lovely, loping tribute to life in a small town, inspired by her hometown of\n\nAledo, Illinois), \"Sunday Birmingham\" (a road song that finds Suzy on tour, longing to power\n\ndown the tour bus and spend more time in the city she just played), and \"It All Falls Down To\n\nThe River\" (a swampy, swinging song about the dark side of American history, with gospel\n\nharmonies from the McCrary Sisters). \"Some of the songs are 'windshield songs' where I'd be\n\nlooking out the window, watching as we toured from one place to another, taking note of what I\n\nsaw,\" she says, \"and others are more personal songs about my own experience.\"\n\nInitially, Suzy worked on Prayin' For Sunshine alone. \"I played the songs on my guitar and\n\nfocused on marrying the lyric to the melody,\" she remembers. \"Since every song was mine, I\n\ncould arrange them however I wanted. When the band came over, I already knew exactly what I\n\nwanted to do with the songs, and I let the band fit themselves around me. It was such a new\n\nprocess for me, to have the tracks built around my performance.\"\n\nSomewhere between the slide guitars and driving percussion of \"GPS,\" the bandmates can be\n\nheard laughing. It's a moment that doesn't break the fourth wall as much as highlight the\n\ngenuine chemistry between all musicians involved. \"We set up the drums in the dining room,\n\nand I was singing in the laundry room,\" Suzy recalls of the album's recording process. \"It\n\nturned into a three-day campout. I'd fix something for lunch and we'd all sit around the table\n\ntogether, talking about how to best approach these songs. We wanted listeners to feel the joy\n\nin the house that week. It was a real band vibe.\"\n\nIt was a real family vibe, too, not unlike the atmosphere created by the soup nights Suzy has\n\nbeen hosting on her birthday for the past decade. Those evenings are celebrated in her new\n\ncookbook, Suzy's Soup Night, which pairs recipes for soups, chilis, chowders, and stews with\n\nphotos from her husband, songwriter Doug Crider. In the book's intro, Suzy describes her\n\nannual get-togethers as times when \"my home is flled with the joy of some of the best\n\nmusicians in the world spontaneously playing together, friends laughing, and a big pot of soup\n\non the stove at the center, bringing us together.\" Although Suzy's Soup Night and Prayin' For\n\nSunshine are two separate projects, they're bound together by a shared appreciation for the\n\ngood stuff: music, storytelling, community, and the connections we make on our shared\n\njourney.\n\n\"I'm feeling revitalized!\" Suzy says. “I feel so present in my live shows now, in a way I haven’t in\n\nyears. I love playing my old songs, but I have new things to share, too. I called the album\n\nPrayin' For Sunshine because I've always been an optimistic person, and there's a need to be\n\nhopeful right now. I feel like the lockdown brought performers and their audiences closer than\n\never. People really reached out to one another, and there's something heartening about all of us\n\nlooking at things a little bit differently. There's so much turmoil in the world right now, but I've\n\nfound a community of people who can agree on things that really count, like music.\"\n\nMalford Milligan is an American, Austin, Texas-based soul, blues and gospel singer who has been compared to Otis Redding, Al Green and James Carr. He is an eight-time award-winner as “Best Vocalist” at the annual Austin Music Awards (last awarded in 2015).\n\nIn 1994, he helped form and fronted the Texas supergroup, Storyville, with guitarists David Holt, David Grissom, and the rhythm section from Stevie Ray Vaughan’s Double Trouble, which included bassist Tommy Shannon, and drummer Chris Layton. The band released three albums: Bluest Eyes (1994), A Piece Of Your Soul (1996) and Dog Years (1998). As a session singer, Milligan was in great demand. He toured and worked on albums together with other outstanding musicians, including Doyle Bramhall II, Marcia Ball, Alejandro Escovedo, Sue Foley, Eric Johnson, Stephen Bruton, Chris Smither and Hal Ketchum. During this period he also expanded his horizons from strictly secular music, releasing the two Gospel albums The Gospel According to Austin (2000) and The Gospel According to Austin, Vol. 2 (2001).\n\nFor several decades, Malford has been the lead-singer at the weekly Blue Monday nights at the legendary Antone’s Nightclub, in the house-band that was (and still is) lead by Derek O’Brien, one of the most respected blues-guitarists all through Austin’s musical history.\n\nMalford appeared on Live And Beyond, by Alien Love Child featuring fellow Austin guitarist Eric Johnson, in 2000. He can be heard on “Once a Part of Me” and “Don’t Cha Know”. That same year he also contributed vocals to Throw Me A Bone, by local band Neighbor’s Dog, on “Sister Sister”, “Bridge To The Other Side” and “Today”. In 2001 a remake of the Joe Tex classic “I Want To Do Everything For You” was recorded as a duet with Toni Price, and was released on her Midnight Pumpkin album. That same year Malford was also featured on two songs on the Double Trouble album Been A Long Time (“Cry Sky” and “Skyscraper”) plus the nationwide tour that followed the release of that album.\n\nMilligan also fronted ex-Was Not Was guitarist Randy Jacobs’ band The Boneshakers in 2001-2003, releasing the albums Pouring Gasoline in 2001 and Put Some Booty On It in 2002. He left The Boneshakers to form his own group in Austin, confusingly called The Malford Milligan Band (like its Dutch predecessor), which self-released Rides Again in 2004 [3] and No Good Deed Goes Unpunished in 2006.\n\nIn 2002 Milligan recorded and released the critically acclaimed Sweet Cherry Soul album, backed by a band from The Netherlands that was put together by Milligan’s friend and Dutch musician/producer Jack Hustinx. The album contains original material written by Milligan & Hustinx as well as a blend of known and obscure Soul, Rhythm & Blues and Gospel classics. Also two songs written by Milligan’s close friend Stephen Bruton were included. This band, The Malford Milligan Band, played three very successful tours in The Netherlands in 2002-2003, as well as a tour in and around Milligan’s hometown Austin, Texas in 2003.\n\nIn 2007 Mill"
