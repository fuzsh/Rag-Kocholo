        "text": "Variety‘s Awards Circuit is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year. It features the official predictions for the Oscars, Emmys, Grammys, and Tony Awards, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\nVisit the prediction pages for the respective ceremonies via the links below:\n\nOSCARS | EMMYS | GRAMMYS | TONYS\n\n2024 Emmy Predictions: All Categories\n\nWeekly Commentary (Updated: Aug. 8, 2024): Emmys done good.\n\nFor someone following the pendulum swings of DEI initiatives in Hollywood, the nomination morning of any awards show can be emotionally draining. This year that is not the case. Even though studios have stepped back from their commitments and promises of 2020, members of the Television Academy made significant strides in putting the golden spotlight on a diverse array of nominees. Also exciting is the broader range of series, genres, studios and networks represented.\n\nIn the acting races, less than one-third of the nominees are people of color. Still, among 96 nominations bestowed across 16 acting categories, voters nominated 30 people of color, a 20% increase over last year. Although 2022 saw a record-breaking 42 people of color nominated in the acting categories, that resulted in zero wins. This year promises a different outcome.\n\nA historic milestone for Indigenous performers dominated the announcements. Before this year, the late actor August Schellenberg was nominated in the supporting actor limited category as Sitting Bull in the 2007 HBO film “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,” and was the only Native American given the nod for acting. Recent Oscar darling Lily Gladstone and former boxing champion Kali Reis join him as the first Indigenous women nominated — for “Under the Bridge” and “True Detective: Night Country,” respectively. Additionally, D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, a surprise lead comedy actor inclusion, received long overdue recognition for his role in the final season of FX’s “Reservation Dogs,” a first for Indigenous actors in any lead acting race.\n\nAlthough Latino performers made up less than 6% of the acting submissions, five notable actors found love: Selena Gomez (lead comedy actress for “Only Murders in the Building”), Sofia Vergara (lead actress limited for “Griselda”), Liza Colón-Zayas (supporting comedy actress for “The Bear”), Nava Mau (supporting actress limited for “Baby Reindeer”) and Néstor Carbonell (guest drama actor for “Shōgun”). As an executive producer of “Only Murders,” Gomez is now the most Emmy-nominated Latina producer in any series category, with three noms.\n\nIssa López, showrunner for “True Detective: Night Country,” received nods for directing, writing and producing the fourth season of the anthology crime drama. She’s the first Latina nominated for directing and the second for writing, following René Echevarria in 2005 for “The 4400.”\n\nFX’s historical epic “Shōgun,” the second non-English language series nominated after “Squid Game” in 2022, delivered the majority of AAPI acting nominees this year: lead actor and actress drama nominees Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai and supporting players Tadanobu Asano and Takehiro Hira. Alongside Sawai is Maya Erskine from the action drama “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”; they’re the second and third Asian women nominated in any category after Sandra Oh for “Killing Eve” (2018-20). Oh is nominated as an executive producer of the TV movie “Quiz Lady,” alongside co-star Awkwafina and director Jessica Yu.\n\nBlack actors saw significant gains. Quinta Brunson, who became the second Black woman to win lead comedy actress last year, earned her third acting nod for ABC’s “Abbott Elementary.” Joining her are Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Maya Rudolph (“Loot”). The latter was the most nominated performer of the year, with additional noms for voice-over, guest acting and original song. Also, Brunson, Edebiri, Gomez and Rudolph marked the first time women of color dominated any lead acting category.\n\nSalli Richardson-Whitfield, a surprise directing nominee for HBO’s now-canceled drama “Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,” made history as the first Black woman nominated in the category. LGBTQ artists also made strides. Mau of “Baby Reindeer” is the second transgender actor recognized in the main acting categories after Michaela Jaé Rodriguez. Other members of the LGBTQ community finding recognition include Bowen Yang (“SNL”), Andrew Scott (“Ripley”), Jonathan Bailey (“Fellow Travelers”), Matt Bomer (“Fellow Travelers”), Sarah Paulson (“Mr. and Mrs. Smith”) and Paulson’s real-life partner, Holland Taylor (“The Morning Show”).\n\nDespite a more than 33% decrease in overall submissions, Emmy voters took the time to be genuinely inclusive in this first round of the dance. This should further prove that diverse stories and talent will connect with audiences when given the opportunity. Studios should take note of this strong year: DEI is not a trend but essential to a profitable and nomination-filled future.\n\nThe Creative Arts and Governors Gala ceremonies will occur over two nights on Sept. 7-8.
