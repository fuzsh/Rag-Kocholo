        "text": "DUBAI: Following hot on the heels of Netflix’s first Saudi original comedy series “Tahir’s House,” the global streamer has just announced another Jeddah-set original series that is tailor-made to get the Kingdom talking.\n\nCreated by Saudi filmmaker Nora Aboushousha (“Lucky You Are Mine”), “Crashing Eid” is family drama-comedy that tackles societal romantic taboos with both an irreverent spirit and a warm heart, set to debut worldwide on Oct. 19.\n\nThe show follows Razan (Summer Shesha), a Saudi woman living in the UK with her teenage daughter who plans to marry a British-Pakistani man under the assumption that her family will approve the pairing without question. When she returns home during Ramadan, with her fiancé following soon after as an uninvited guest, she soon finds that breaking with tradition may be harder than she had originally thought — to both hilarious and dramatic results.\n\nAboushousha, herself from Jeddah, is a rising star in the Kingdom, with her one-location lockdown crime series “Rahin Altaqiq” and drama comedy about rebellious young Saudi woman “Confessions” both becoming viral hits over the last few years. She is also no stranger to pushing boundaries, with her short “Lucky You Are Mine” winning a production grant by the Saudi Film Commission before debuting at the 2022 Red Sea International Film Festival in her hometown to strong acclaim.\n\n“We started off with a concept of someone who is different from their family, and that grew into this story of a single mother who returns from abroad. We started wondering, what will inspire the clash with the rest of the family? And immediately we realized, ‘oh, she should come back ready to be married to someone from outside the culture!’ Everything fell into place from there,” Aboushousha told Arab News.\n\nFor Shesha, who steps into her first major lead role as Razan, the project inspired her not only because of the ways that the conceit allows each member of the family to flourish as they grapple with the events it sets into motion, but because the themes are so easy to relate to for so many people across the world.\n\n“First of all, this show is awesome. I really think it is. That drew me to it to begin with. But it also mattered to me that this is on Netflix worldwide. This is a show with global themes of family, conflict and love. I really wanted a show that both felt specific and universal and this show has really captures that,” Shesha told Arab News.\n\nDUBAI: The Middle East, especially the GCC, has always been an important region for luxury fashion labels. More recently, Saudi Arabia with its fast growing fashion ecosystem and its appetite for luxury takes center stage with luxury labels increasing their presence in the Kingdom – be it through hosting events, collaborating with local talent or opening new stores. Fausto Puglisi, creative director of Roberto Cavalli recently visited the Kingdom as part of Women’s Wear Daily’s (WWD) global fashion summit held in Riyadh and Arab News spoke to him after the event to get his take on the burgeoning significance of the regional market.\n\nThe designer was struck by the dynamic blend of tradition and modernity that defines Saudi Arabia, saying: “What’s fascinating is the respect for the roots and, at the same time, the curiosity for the new. It’s one of the few places in the world where you can feel and breathe this mix of past and future.”\n\nThe brand has a long history with Arab clientele and its 2019 sale to Emirati owner Hussain Sajwani further strengthened its relationship with the region. This bond is reflected in the brand’s successful collaborations with Middle Eastern influencers like Karen Wazen, who in 2022 became a global ambassador for the brand. “Roberto Cavalli himself had a lot of business in the Arab world – so there is a connection in the DNA,” Puglisi explained.\n\nPuglisi's vision for Roberto Cavalli involves blending the classic with the contemporary, a concept he feels resonates well with the Saudi market. Since taking over as creative director in 2020, Puglisi is looking to lead the brand into a new era.\n\n“I am very happy and honored. My journey is connected to a bigger ambition — to make this brand very big again,” he said.\n\nFor the future, he also envisions targeted collections for the local market.\n\n“I would like to develop a collection of abayas and scarves for women to pair with jeans and beautiful shoes creating a look that blends classic and modern styles,” he said.\n\nDUBAI: Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez – known for directing popular horror flicks like “Evil Dead” and “Don’t Breathe” – takes on one of the most iconic horror/sci-fi franchises of our time with “Alien: Romulus,” and with a masterful touch, pares it back to its roots.\n\nWritten by Álvarez and Rodo Sayagues, “Romulus” takes place between the events of Ridley Scott’s 1979 classic “Alien” and James Cameron’s beloved 1986 follow-up “Aliens,” firmly putting itself in the narrative of the original films.\n\nGiving the franchise a young adult spin for the first time in its long history, “Romulus” follows a group of 20-something space colonists who decide to explore a derelict, decommissioned space station in the hopes of getting off their sunless mining colony and making their way to a lush planet in a faraway system.\n\nAt the heart of the crew are Rain (Cailee Spaeny, who you will know from “Priscilla” and “Civil War”) and her adopted brother Andy (David Jonsson), who is a synthetic created by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation (the company behind the mining colony and the space station).\n\nOther than the siblings, the rag-tag crew of rebellious colonizers include Tyler (Archie Renoux, “Shadow and Bone”), Kay (Isabela Merced, “The Last of Us”), Bjorn (Spike Fearm, “Back to Black”) and Navarro (debutant Aileen Wu).\n\nThe film shines when it is exploring its themes of fraternity and finding courage in dark moments; and the messy interpersonal relationships between the young group members drive the story forward in meaningful, if predictable, ways. Spaeny and Jonsson especially turn in nuanced performances and have a satisfying arc to their personal and intertwined journeys.\n\nThe real draw of the movie is, of course, its monsters — the Xenomorphs and the face-huggers are as terrifying as ever and the movie never lets up on the body horror and gore. Combining retro-futuristic, expansive sets, expertly crafted practical effects and a gorgeous-yet-eerie background score, “Romulus” is a fun ride for thrill seekers who want a lived-in and familiar vibe while getting spooked.\n\nIf forced to nitpick, a minor quibble would be the gratuitous fan service, which at best is cringey and at its worst takes away from the emotional gravitas of the film. While not completely unwelcome, a little bit of restraint could have gone a long way.\n\nLONDON: There are few more exciting movie lineups than Damon, Liman and Affleck. The first two, of course, are star and director of 2022’s “The Bourne Identity” and kickstarted one of the smartest spy franchises to date, and though the Affleck in question here is Casey, not Damon’s regular collaborator, Ben (who takes a producer role), “The Instigators” is still stuffed with enough star power to make for a tantalizing proposition. And that’s before you even get to a supporting cast that includes Ving Rhames, Hong Chau, Ron Perlman, Paul Walter Houser, Toby Jones and Alfred Molina.\n\nDamon and Affleck star as Rory and Cobby, a pair of down-on-their luck Bostonians who agree to rob the corrupt city mayor (Perlman) for a local crime boss. When the job goes wrong, they wind up on the run, stopping only to snatch Rory’s therapist (Chau) who believes she can talk them into turning themselves in. As they lurch from one calamitous misstep to the next, the pair bicker (in the way that only on-screen Bostonians can) and snipe their way across the city as they flee cops, hitmen and special operatives.\n\nPart buddy-comedy, part-heist thriller, part-action movie, “The Instigators” ends up being none of these things in their entirety. What’s remarkable, in fact, is that it’s so middle-of-the-road that it’s actually very satisfying — funny but not hilarious, sweary but not gratuitous, exciting but never blockbusting. Liman races through the setup so he can have fun with the fallout, and in his two leads he has a duo with peppy chemistry and believable snark. Chau’s deadpan, incredulous shrink is a lot of fun, while Perlman chews the scenery as the slimy mayor, and Molina steals every single one of his few scenes as a brooding enforcer. Set pieces are used sparingly, but efficiently (this is definitely not an all-out action movie).\n\nUltimately, it’s the Damon/Affleck dynamic that makes “The Instigators” really hum, with both leads very much on their game. “The Instigators” isn’t spectacular, but as a couple of hours of escapism, it’s as satisfyingly competent as you could hope for.\n\nDUBAI: Qatar’s Fashion Trust Arabia (FTA) announced the designers who have made the finalist list for the FTA 2024 Awards, with four Saudi talents securing a spot: Kawthar Alhoraish for the Ready-to-Wear Award, and Sara Naif AlSaud, Noura Abdulaziz Al-Saud and Mashael Khalid Al-Saud for the Jewelry Award.\n\nOther designers in the Ready-to-Wear category include Nadine Mosallam from Egypt and Naïma Trabelsi from Tunisia. The Evening Wear category features Hamza Guelmouss and Valentin Nicot from Morocco, Tara Babylon from Iraq and Yasmin Mansour from Egypt.\n\nFor the Jewelry Award, Lebanese designer Karl Toufic Yazigi and Noura Alserkal from the United Arab Emirates will compete with the three Saudi talents. In the Accessories category, Dara Hamarneh, a Jordanian Palestinian designer, joins Moroccan designer Jihane Boumediane and Egyptian Reem Hamed as finalists.\n\nThe Franca Sozzani Debut Talent Award includes Iraqi designer Mahmood Al-Safi, Lebanese designer Mira Maktabi, and Palestinian Jordanian designer Sylwia Nazzal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fashion Tech category highlights innovators like Batoul Al-Rashdan from Jordan, Hazem Samy Ali from Egypt and Sarah Salameh from Palestine.\n\nThis year’s event will take place in Marrakech, in partnership with the Years of Culture initiative to celebrate the Qatar-Morocco 2024 Year of Culture.\n\nThe winning designers will receive a financial grant ranging from $100,000 to $200,000, depending on the size of their business, with an additional $50,000 awarded for the Franca Sozzani Debut Talent Award.\n\nCollections from winners in the Evening Wear, Ready-to-Wear, Accessories, and Jewelry categories will be showcased by FTA’s retail partner, Harrods, for one season.\n\nIn addition to retail opportunities, FTA offers all winners benefits, including a year-long mentorship with The Bicester Collection.\n\nHuntsman will offer the Ready-to-Wear category winner an internship in London. As part of the internship the winner will be creating a capsule collection to be sold on the retailer’s e-commerce platform.\n\nLuxury ethical fashion retail platform Maison De Mode will offer a tailored mentorship to all seven winners that focuses on the importance of sustainability and ethical fashion practices.\n\nThe winning designers will also take part in a two-day bespoke FTA mentorship program in London in partnership with The Bicester Collection, Brand x Society, and the British Fashion Council.\n\nDUBAI: Chilean Palestinian singer Elyanna wowed the audience at the Outside Lands Music Festival in San Francisco this week.\n\nThe artist performed popular hits, including the viral “Ganeni,” along with “Mama Eh,” “Ghareeb Alay,” and “Woledto,” blending dance and musical influences from Arab culture into her set.\n\nPeople in the crowd held up the Palestinian flag during her set.\n\nThe 22-year-old music sensation wore a long-sleeved, semi-sheer dress made of delicate, web-like lace material, with metallic embellishments and silver sequins adding a touch of shimmer.\n\nThe dress featured cutouts at the midriff and legs, along with an asymmetrical hemline and fringe details.\n\nThe Los-Angeles based singer’s music uniquely fuses Arabic and Western beats, a reflection of her multicultural upbringing. Throughout her career, she has worked to normalize Arabic lyrics in the Western music scene, drawing inspiration from artists like Lana Del Rey, Beyoncé, and Middle Eastern icon Fayrouz.\n\nEarlier this week, Elyanna teased an upcoming collaboration with British band Coldplay, rapper Little Simz, Nigerian singer Burna Boy and Argentine singer Tini that is set to drop on Aug. 23.\n\nThe song, titled “We Pray,” is from Coldplay's upcoming album “Moon Music,” scheduled for release on Oct. 4. The singers previously performed it in June at the UK’s Glastonbury Festival.\n\nLast month, Elyanna – who was the first artist to perform a full set in Arabic at California’s Coachella music festival in 2023 – announced that she is expanding her world tour “Woledto,” with new dates and locations in Europe.\n\nThe tour, from Oct. 5 to Dec. 16, will have 30 stops.\n\n“The Woledto Tour from North America to Europe! See you soon,” she wrote to her 1.5 million followers on Instagram at the time.\n\nHer fans quickly took to the comments section, requesting gigs in Lebanon, Dubai, Los Angeles, Australia, Barcelona, Lisbon, Milan and more.\n\nIn May this year, she made her television debut on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”\n\nElyanna delivered a medley of hits from her debut album including “Callin’ U (Tamally Maak)” and “Mama Eh,” the first song performed entirely in Arabic on the show."
