        "text": "In a scene of high tension and even higher stakes, the Duke of Edinburgh arrives at Kensington Palace to warn Diana, Princess of Wales not to spill the beans about her failing marriage. It is 1991 and he has been tipped off that she is collaborating on a book. She invites him to sit down but he purposefully remains standing to deliver his quietly devastating message – a piece of drama as detonating as anything we have so far had from The Crown.\n\nWe’re into the final two seasons of Queen Elizabeth II’s fictionalised story on Netflix, beginning this week, and Sir Jonathan Pryce has taken over the part of Prince Philip from Tobias Menzies with a speech and delivery so sensitive, so cunning and yet so unyielding that it is pin-drop intense to watch. The reluctant ambassador versus the unappeasable daughter-in-law, mute, wretched, knowing it’s too late.\n\nYes, he can be a tough old nut, he tells Diana, but he’s always had a soft spot for her. He’s protective of her, fond of her (‘There, I’ve said it’); he’s on her team. ‘We’re all in the system – you, me, the boss. For better or worse, we’re all stuck in it and we can’t just air our grievances and throw bombs in the air like a normal family…’ There’s a wealth of meaning in his suggestion that she can ‘be creative’ in finding ways to be happy so long as she sticks to one rule: ‘Be loyal to your husband and to this family in public.’\n\nDiana (a magnetic Elizabeth Debicki), makes no answer. Philip’s parting shot is that silence is the wisest thing that he’s ever heard come out of her mouth. Quite a moment.\n\n‘It was my first day filming,’ Pryce says. ‘Yeah, downhill from there.’ Flashes of self-deprecation are his stock-in-trade but it’s obvious that he’s relishing his role in the multimillion-pound television production and its added momentousness since the death of the Queen.\n\n‘I had a sense of joy about watching it and a joy that I was part of it, because on every level it’s great film-making,’ he says. ‘I was very heartened that when her death was announced, viewing figures for The Crown went up. It meant that people just wanted to spend more time with her.’\n\nDocumentaries, he says, didn’t meet the need of the moment. ‘What is special about The Crown is that you see – and, of course, a lot is surmised by Peter Morgan [writer and producer] – the emotional life behind the public persona. But I don’t think the Queen’s passing has changed the way the Royal family is portrayed in the series because we have always been confident that what we do is respectful and honourable.’\n\nPryce is neither royalist nor republican, but he has a fine appreciation of the flawed individuals charged with upholding the constitutional monarchy. ‘If we’re going to have a Royal family, this is a pretty good one to have. Especially the Queen. And if we’re going to have a King, this is a good one to have.\n\n‘Charles, in one of his first statements as King, said he would continue in the vein that his mother worked so I don’t feel it’s the end of an era. There’s a bit of me – a lot of me – that hopes he’ll be freer now to speak about issues like climate change and the environment. Perhaps people will give him a little more credit for what he’s been saying in the past. I have great hope for him.’\n\nEven so, it offended him that anti-monarchy protesters were led away by police for demonstrating during the processional. ‘Peaceful protest is being suppressed. People were jumped on for opposing the mass view of what was taking place. I’m not saying that I would support them, but I support their right to protest. I speak as someone who went on all the marches.’\n\nPryce says he never thought he’d see a King in his lifetime, though surely, at a mere 75, he didn’t expect the Queen to outlive him. ‘I was told by one of my children that it was very sexist of me to say I’m quite enjoying having a King, but when you’ve dealt with kings all your working life… do you know what I mean?’ He gives one of his compressed smiles, a crescent of mischief.\n\nIn an acting career festooned with awards and spanning more than half a century, Pryce’s tally of kings, prelates and figures of authority is impressive. Even his villains tend to be top notch. He was a deeply empathetic Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall, a mesmeric High Sparrow in Game of Thrones and an uncanny embodiment of Pope Francis in the 2019 Netflix drama The Two Popes, for which he received his first Academy Award nomination for best actor.\n\nPersonal tragedy was the spur for his Hamlet at the Royal Court in 1980, regarded as one of the greatest modern interpretations of the play. During a petty theft, his father suffered a violent attack at his grocery shop, from which he never fully recovered. Pryce channelled his emotions into Hamlet, the son avenging his father’s death.\n\nHis breakthrough screen performance was in Terry Gilliam’s Brazil in 1985. He has moved fluidly from Shakespeare to leading man in musicals – My Fair Lady, Evita, Miss Saigon – to Bond (Tomorrow Never Dies). One of his most powerful recent stage performances was opposite Eileen Atkins in The Height of the Storm about a couple facing the anguish of dementia. To call him versatile sounds an understatement. Last year he was knighted for services to drama.\n\nPryce joins me at the Netflix headquarters in London, a lofty figure with large expressive hands. In soft dark-blue jumper and grey cords, he would pass unnoticed in the garden centre aisles. But under shaggy, grey-white eyebrows, on screen and off, it’s his eyes that give him away.\n\nIs there any other colossus of stage and screen hiding so successfully in plain sight? His high-domed forehead and melodious voice should be easily recognisable yet Pryce manages to operate mostly below the celebrity radar. ‘I’m not a star, I’m an actor,’ he once said.\n\n‘The recognition factor went up 100 per cent after Game of Thrones,’ he says. On tour with The Merchant of Venice, in 2016, as he disembarked from a ferry to a remote island off the Chinese coast, he was greeted with cries of ‘High Sparrow! High Sparrow!’ He has a theory that if you don’t erect barriers, people leave you alone because there is nothing to break down.\n\nEven his acting is a lesson in restraint. ‘When I watch him and his work,’ says Morgan, ‘it’s how little he does that I love… And the dignity and the heft he brings. That as an anchor is priceless.’\n\nPerhaps the key to his undemonstrative mastery is that when he walks into a room as Prince Philip, he’s not thinking: ‘I’m Philip’. ‘I’m walking through as a normal human being, but everybody’s reaction to me shows I’m quite a powerful person. I think the simpler you are, the better. You don’t try to put in too many quirks.’\n\nMorgan suspended filming of season six of The Crown immediately after the Queen died on September 8 and again on the day of her funeral. Pryce was not in Spain with the rest of the crew when her death was announced but in London filming One Life with Sir Anthony Hopkins, the story of Nicholas Winton, the Kindertransport hero who saved 669 Czech children from the Nazis. Checking his phone under the table, he passed a note to Hopkins, who had been his co-star as Pope Benedict XVI in The Two Popes. ‘She’s gone,’ he wrote. They observed a minute’s silence on set. ‘I don’t want to speak for her, but I think Imelda [Staunton, who plays the Queen in the new series] found it very affecting.’\n\nPryce confesses that he started watching The Crown reluctantly, but was drawn in by its power and plausibility. Claire Foy was, in his view, everything you imagined the young Queen to be. ‘At the end of episode one, I just wanted to keep on watching. You can’t make it up. Their life is a drama, a constant drama.’ Watching his scenes with Debicki (a worthy successor to Emma Corrin), made him tearful. ‘I find it incredibly moving. And when you see her doing the Panorama interview [with Martin Bashir], almost exactly the original, it is painful.’\n\nPrince Philip, a man widely misunderstood and an enigma to Pryce himself, was one of those parts, he says, that you want to be asked to play, even if ultimately you say no. ‘I knew there was only one part I could play in The Crown – since the Pope didn’t appear in it – and so when I was asked, I thought: oh, great, but is this someone I really want to do? I’m so glad I did.\n\n‘I’ve grown up with him. I’ve been watching the externals of the man all my life. He was someone I just accepted was there. Then, oh God, when I looked into his background, his childhood, his broken family, I realised he was a much more important and interesting figure than I’d ever thought. The image that I began to build of him was of a man among men. It was my biggest acting challenge – and continues to be.\n\n‘After he died, it got even more daunting. You watched the documentaries honouring him and saw how he was loved by his children and grandchildren and suddenly there was this side of him that the public weren’t aware of. He was a great surprise. I wish I had known more about him over the years.’\n\nOne of the difficulties for an actor used to seeking out a subject’s foibles and weaknesses is that Pryce didn’t find any in the Duke of Edinburgh. ‘The first thing young people say about him is that he was racist. Far from it. He was a product of a time when there was casual racism but I don’t think he was racist at all. He was highly intelligent, curious, and in his time innovative. He toured, lectured, spoke, encouraged. Though he felt hidebound by being part of the monarchy, he did what he could.’\n\nWhen he turned 50, Prince Philip gave up polo playing and turned to four-in-hand carriage driving for fun. Talking to the carriage-driving set for research gave Pryce valuable insight into Philip’s personality. ‘I had seen him as not very outgoing, quite aloof, but when I started to talk to people who knew him – the carriage-driving fraternity and The Crown’s special advisors on protocol who were very close to him – it was clear that he was a great person to spend time with, very funny, very full of life. No one I spoke to had a bad word to say.’\n\nThe sequences with his carriage-driving companion, Lady Penelope Romsey, 32 years his junior, are exhilarating but the plotline of their relationship, the subject of gossip on and off down the years, is causing The Crown’s self-appointed attack dogs to froth at the mouth. ‘Very distasteful and quite frankly, cruel rubbish,’ according to Queen Elizabeth’s former press secretary Dickie Arbiter.\n\nFrom the two episodes I have seen, the relationship is tender and unexceptionable. In one scene, Philip turns up unannounced to console Penny (played by Natascha McElhone) after the death of her five-year-old daughter Leonora from cancer. In his hand is a small posy. ‘I just came by to see how you’re coping,’ he says, looking awkward, the way men do with flowers.\n\nPryce creates a web of stillness and compassion. As Philip, he talks quietly to her about grief (his pregnant sister Cecile died in a plane crash in 1937), the way it moves through your body, inhabits it, makes a permanent home there, but you learn to live with it. No wonder Pryce treats Morgan’s script as Holy Writ, the only guidance, he says, that an actor needs.\n\nIn their screen marriage, Pryce and Staunton are a comfortable fit, though their physical expressions of love are few. In episode four, which covers the Queen’s ‘annus horribilis’ – the collapse of three of her children’s marriages, the tell-all Morton book, Fergie’s toe-sucking escapade with John Bryan and the fire at Windsor Castle – Prince Philip comforts the Queen in a solitary, wordless embrace by the ruins of the still-smoking castle.\n\n‘There is another kiss to the forehead,’ Pryce insists. ‘I think they had a very good relationship. It’s become, with age, a more tender, fonder relationship. You see the way he looks at her in public, and she him especially, and she’s very often laughing with him.’ (Be that as it may, Staunton’s Queen is a brusque and less confident monarch than Olivia Colman’s in the previous series.)\n\nThe actors have known one another for 30 years. They appeared together in Uncle Vanya in 1988 and again in 1994 in the film Deadly Advice. That ‘form’ gave depth to their Crown marriage. ‘So much is unsaid. I know she trusts me. I trust her implicitly. I don’t see her putting a foot wrong in our relationship because we already have that friendship and mutual respect. It’s a given.’\n\nJust as he’d finished filming series five last year, Pryce received his knighthood for services to drama and charity from the Princess Royal. At these events, recipients can pick up crumbs of royal opinion, and Pryce doesn’t pretend to be above it. Does he care what they think about The Crown? Do they watch it? ‘Oh, I do care what they think,’ he says. But as for some covert seal of approval, ‘There’s no way of knowing.’ What he does know, from something overheard, is that Philip liked his work – and that Princess Anne is one of several royals who watch The Crown.\n\nDiscovering the reaction of the Vatican to his portrayal of Pope Francis was a lot more straightforward. One of the archbishops close to the Pope arranged a screening and at the end of it the clergy in the audience were buzzing with approval. ‘Were we too hard on the Church?’ the cast wanted to know. ‘Not hard enough,’ replied the archbishop. He took away a DVD of The Two Popes for His Holiness, saying he would enjoy it.\n\nIts two Welsh actors – Hopkins and Pryce – had worked together just once, 30 years ago, for a recording of Under Milk Wood. ‘Awe is too big a word,’ says Pryce, ‘but I had enormous respect for Tony Hopkins as an actor. I knew very little about him as a person. It was a given [at the start of the film] that Francis, a priest, would be in awe of being in the presence of the Pope. So my first days with him were… well, I didn’t have to act at all.’ They struck up a real friendship that mirrored what was happening on screen.\n\nPryce wondered if the experience of The Two Popes might stir some latent religiosity in him, but it didn’t happen. He grew up in the Welsh Presbyterian church in Holywell, North Wales, but drifted away when he was a young teenager. He’d wanted to be an artist – before that, a pop singer. At a teacher-training college production in Ormskirk, a teacher spotted his talent and suggested he should try for Rada. His first job was at the Liverpool Everyman theatre in 1972.\n\nThere he met his future wife, the actor Kate Fahy, and they were, as he puts it, ‘happily unmarried’ for four decades. Then the scourge of inheritance tax loomed and in 2015, in the presence of their three grown-up children, [Patrick, now 40, Gabriel, 37 and Phoebe, 33] they married at their local east London register office. ‘I didn’t know what to expect,’ he says, ‘I thought it would be all very “sign here, please” but it turned into quite an emotional little ceremony. It was lovely.\n\n‘I don’t talk about what my children say or do but there was one very touching moment when one of my sons – they were about six and three – said: “When I’m older I’ll get married.” The elder one replied: “You don’t have to get married. You just have to love someone.” I thought that was great.’\n\nTheatre, film, television. If he had to choose only one of those platforms for the rest of his working life, what would it be? ‘I have had some wonderful experiences in the theatre,’ he reflects, ‘but at this stage in my life I would rather be home more often than now.’ There is a pause. ‘I’d go for a nice long-running TV series on Netflix.’\n\nThen he has to be hurried away to our photo shoot and when I look out of the high window of the Netflix offices, there is a large black people carrier waiting in the street with its door open. Pryce crosses the road, tall with an aureole of white hair, stooping slightly, a little stiff, unremarked. Just another man in the street, exactly as he likes it.\n\nThe latest series of The Crown is on Netflix from November 9"
