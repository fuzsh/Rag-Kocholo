        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n21 Jul 2024, 09:08\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nThe Bear just bagged a whopping 23 Emmy nominations, but why is it considered a comedy? Read on to find out the surprising truth!\n\nThe Bear has cooked up a storm with a record-breaking 23 Emmy nominations in the comedy category, leaving everyone asking: \"Comedy? Really?\"\n\nThis intense show, more likely to give you kitchen nightmares than belly laughs, has set the TV world abuzz with its impressive haul, surpassing even the legendary 30 Rock.\n\nBut why does this gritty series about the high-stakes world of a restaurant kitchen qualify as a comedy? Let’s dig in.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nEmmys 2024: Baby Reindeer, The Crown and The Bear among nominees - see the full list\n\nRev Richard Coles on Strictly Come Dancing -'it's a wonderful show with a dark heart'\n\nFans delighted as This Morning reveal summer hosts covering Ben Shephard and Cat Deeley's seven week break\n\n------------------------------------\n\nFirst, let's season this story with some Emmy history. The Bear, which already won 10 Emmys for its first season, has now smashed the record for most nominations in a single year for a comedy series, a record previously held by the quick-witted 30 Rock back in 2009.\n\nBut while Liz Lemon and crew kept us laughing with their zany antics, The Bear serves up a more intense dish with its tense atmosphere and themes of suicide and depression.\n\nComedian and writer Niles Abston quipped: “The industry letting a show that’s clearly a drama break the Emmys comedy nomination record would probably be a 30 Rock bit.”\n\nFellow comedian Ashley Ray chimed in, tweeting: “One episode of 30 Rock has more jokes than all of The Bear.” Ouch! It seems not everyone is buying The Bear as a comedy contender.\n\nThe debate isn't just sizzling on social media.\n\nAccording to Variety, some rival networks have urged the Television Academy to rethink The Bear’s comedy placement, arguing that the show’s intense vibe feels more like a drama.\n\nBut this isn’t the first time the comedy-drama line has been blurry at the Emmys.\n\nThe Academy’s current rules state that a comedy series should be 'primarily comedic,' a definition that’s as flexible as a soufflé rising in the oven.\n\nThe cast and crew of The Bear have had their say, too.\n\nAt the European premiere, Jeremy Allen White, who won an Emmy for his role as the show’s lead, passionately declared, “Yes!” when asked if he considers The Bear a comedy.\n\nExecutive producer Josh Senior added: “The show is true to life. Sometimes it’s funny, and sometimes it’s real. What we try to do is tell a real story.”\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach, another Emmy winner from the show, thinks traditional genre definitions are outdated: “These ideas about comedy and drama are a little bit outdated.”\n\nWhite previously described The Bear as a 'dramedy' to USA Today, saying: “It’s certainly funny at times. We’re trying to make it like real life. Sad things can be funny. Funny things can make you sad, and it has all of those moments in it.”\n\nThe Bear isn't the first show to stir the pot with its category.\n\nRemember Orange Is the New Black? Initially classified as a comedy, it was shifted to drama after a rule change in 2015, despite its mix of humour and heartbreak.\n\nThe switch was caused by a rule change that took effect that year, which forced series with hour-long episodes to compete as dramas unless they filed a petition.\n\nShows like Glee, Shameless, and Jane the Virgin have also danced between categories, and successfully petitioned for their own changes, highlighting the tricky task of labelling TV’s multifaceted storytelling.\n\nOther series have straddled the line between comedy and drama, like Emmy favorite Succession, known for its dramatic plots and satirical one-liners.\n\nFleabag, addressing themes of suicide and heartbreak, won Outstanding Comedy Series in 2019, while the dark comedy Barry has also earned numerous comedy nominations recently.\n\nSo, what makes The Bear a comedy in the eyes of the Emmys? It’s all about perspective.\n\nThe show’s portrayal of the chaotic, high-pressure kitchen life includes moments of dark humour and absurdity amidst the tension.\n\nLike a gourmet meal with both savoury and sweet notes, The Bear blends intense drama with comedic elements, creating a unique flavour that’s captivated audiences and critics alike.\n\nWith its record-setting nominations, The Bear continues to reign supreme in the comedy category.\n\nThis year, it earned a second consecutive nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series.\n\nStars Jeremy Allen White, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Ayo Edebiri are once again in the running, with first-time nominations for Lionel Boyce and Liza Colón-Zayas."
