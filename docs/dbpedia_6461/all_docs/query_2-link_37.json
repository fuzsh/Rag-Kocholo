Each question is a trigger for a potentially wide ranging discussion. It’s a wonderfully interactive picture book. Read it and see where a child takes you.” — Children's Book of the Week, Sunday Times\n\n“The perfect book for curious minds.” — Armadillo Magazine\n\n“This brilliant picture book is fantastic for sharing with inquisitive minds […] Playful and profound, with bright artwork that seems deceptively simple, yet demands attention, this is sure to be a future classic in the vein of John Burningham’s Would You Rather?” — BookTrust\n\n“The first page of this original book asks: “How many animals can you see in this picture?” Using collage and paint prints and pen drawings, it shows a tree full of creatures, from a peacock to a bear. “Ah,” you think. “It’s that kind of book, where we spot and count things.” But page two asks: “How many animals can you not see because they are hiding from the tiger?” The only creature in the picture is the tiger among leaves. You have to imagine the others. By question three: “Which of these ladies just robbed a bank?” you realise the book is not a test, but a conversation in which you make up your own story aided by pictures from which you may construct your case. There are no right or wrong answers. Each question is a trigger for a potentially wide-ranging discussion. It’s a wonderfully interactive picture book. Read it and see where a child takes you.”\n\n—The Sunday Times\n\n“This is creative, interactive picture-book fun, without question.” — Horn Book\n\n“Each spread creates its own world, inviting readers to discuss. . . A humorous vein runs through the book, but other emotions are also evoked, including poignancy. . . The clever, attractive final spread—posterworthy—manages to be both open-ended and final. Humans depicted are diverse. . . .Quirky entertainment to jump-start creativity.” — Kirkus Reviews\n\n★ BUY ★\n\nIllustrated by Sarah Jacoby\n\nIn forty-two inspired pages, this biography artfully plays with form and language to vividly bring to life one of greatest children’s book creators who ever lived: Margaret Wise Brown.\n\n★ BUY ★\n\nA Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2019\n\n“I love this book like life itself.”\n\n—Ann Patchett\n\n★ “Groundbreaking.”\n\n—School Library Journal, Starred Review\n\n★ “Brave.”\n\n—Booklist, Starred Review\n\n★ “The important thing about this review is to say this picture book is great. Here and now, we say to Barnett and Jacoby: We SEE what you've done. You've paid tribute to a woman who changed picture books. Forever. You've acknowledged her queerness, telling readers she fell in love \"with a woman called Michael and a man called Pebble.\" You've honored her words with references to such titles as Goodnight Moon, The Runaway Bunny, The Little Fur Family, and more. You've sat with her respect for child readers as thinking, feeling, whole beings, and you've invited us, your readers, and hers, to do the same. You've framed her conflict with a stuffy librarian as an epic, funny battle. Just like Brown's texts, yours is quirky, and sweet, experimental, funny, and at times heartbreakingly gorgeous. And Jacoby channels Clement Hurd, and Leonard Weisgard, and Garth Williams, and so many other Brown collaborators—and yet? Jacoby remains herself. Just like Margaret Wise Brown was herself, her whole life long. Or her whole life short, really, right? Isn't it a shame she died so young? At 42—as you document in this picture-book biography, this love letter to her life, and to her astonishing legacy to children's literature. Honestly? We don't know what more to say. But we guess we will say this: have a carrot. You've earned it. And so much more. The important thing is that you wrote this picture book—this picture book about Margaret Wise Brown. A runaway success.”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review\n\n★ “Barnett’s confiding tone draws readers in… then makes the case for Brown’s work.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly, Starred Review\n\n★ “It’s now clear that the librarian bunny and Mac Barnett share a common passion: advocacy for children’s free access to books. And who better to carry that banner than Margaret Wise Brown, whose books have been vindicated by decades of children who have assayed such titles as Goodnight Moon and found them valuable. Although Brown’s life ended at forty-two, her often strange picture books bear the stamp that counts—the author’s name on the covers of titles in print decades after her passing. The librarian bunny concludes, ‘The important thing about Margaret Wise Brown is that she wrote books.’ Her bunny listeners, and Barnett’s audience as well, may begin to suspect that there could be other books, quirky and strange and wonderful, that aren’t reaching their paws right now in 2019. Children old enough to look back at their Brown favorites with happy nostalgia will surely enjoy this creatively rendered backstory, while teachers and librarians will see connections between Moore’s collection exclusion and broader issues of access, making this age-accessible material for Banned Books Week.”\n\n—The Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books, Starred Review\n\n“Barnett’s assertion that it is important for children’s books to reflect the things children think of and do, is never more pressing than it is in troubled times.”\n\n—Bustle\n\nSarah Jacoby’s Margaret Wise Brown Research Blog\n\n★ BUY ★\n\nIllustrated by Christian Robinson\n\nYou would like being friends with Leo. He likes to draw, he makes delicious snacks, and most people can't even see him. Because Leo is also a ghost. When a new family moves into his home and Leo's efforts to welcome them are misunderstood, Leo decides it is time to leave and see the world. That is how he meets Jane, a kid with a tremendous imagination and an open position for a worthy knight. That is how Leo and Jane become friends. And that is when their adventures begin.\n\nMost people cannot see ghosts. Can you?\n\n★ BUY ★\n\nA New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Book of 2015\n\nA Boston Globe Best Book of 2015\n\nA Kirkus Best Picture Book of 2015\n\nA Publisher's Weekly Best Picture Book of 2015\n\n★ \"Together, words and pictures construct a whimsical, delightful story that deeply respects the child. And in Jane, they create a brilliant heroine whose powers lie within her wit, her open mind, and her freedom of play. Dazzling.\"\n\n—Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review\n\n★ \"It’s a warm and wise story about acceptance trumping difference—including that between life and death.\"\n\n—Publishers Weekly, Starred Review\n\n★ \"A whimsical tale from Barnett aptly accompanied by enthralling artwork by Robinson. What’s not to drool over?\"\n\n—School Library Journal, Starred Review\n\n★ “A tender, touching story of friendship and the power of imagination.”\n\n—Booklist, Starred Review\n\n★ \"Barnett and Robinson celebrate play, as Jane breaks gender roles and includes Leo among her imaginary friends.... Will he be able to explain himself without blowing his cover? This deceptively simple story examines deep themes of perception and truth, friendship and loyalty.\"\n\n—Shelf Awareness, Starred Review\n\n\"Christian Robinson, the book’s illustrator, is one of the most exciting children’s book artists working today...I love the palette of “Leo”: black, white, gray and various shades of moody blue, in a mix of acrylic paint and chunky ­construction-paper collage. Leo is a simple white ghostly outline with Brylcreemed-looking hair and a bow tie. The living people are done in varying blue tones. Jane is sapphire-skinned but reads African-American to me, with her braided or twisted hair — drawn as cheerful little dots — in a high side ponytail. The look of the book is mod and sparky enough to delight design-loving parents, while the text, by Mac Barnett is wry, evocative and rich. “After dinner Jane returned to her room and gave Leo a sword. They snuck into a cave, slew a dragon, and stole all his loot. When Leo closed his eyes, he could almost see the gold coins and green scales.” The story has a light touch, but there’s so much depth: a fearful ghost, a take-charge girl, an interracial friendship, and a tale in which fear is integrally and sweetly tied to positive qualities of imagination.\"\n\n—The New York Times\n\n\"Terrific\" and \"tender.\"\n\n—The Wall Street Journal\n\n\"Barnett and Robinson are a picture-book dream team. As always Robinson shows that he is a genius of mood—shades of blue and heavy black lines cast a melancholy glow—and posture....Despite Leo’s ghost status there is nothing spooky about this moving story of friendship, acceptance, and belonging.\"\n\n—The Boston Globe\n\n\"This innocent yet sophisticated story will appeal to small listeners and their favorite adults.\"\n\n—The Washington Post\n\n\"Leo's plight will strike a chord with any kid who has felt lonely or left out...the book emphasizes a certain sweetness with Barnett's stripped down prose and Christian Robinson's adorable illustrations.\"\n\n—National Post\n\n“A heartening parable of seeing through difference, meeting the unfamiliar with unflinching friendliness, and dignifying the reality of the other.”\n\n—Brain Pickings\n\n“One particularly great thing about this book is that the pictures are all drawn in different shades of blue. It taps into underlying melancholy of Leo’s situation: Leo, of course, is a ghost who haunts a house until its new inhabitants make it clear that they have no interest in sharing the space with him. So the ghost boy makes the sad decision to relocate, and finds—and then saves—a new friend in the process. The story doesn’t tell us how he became a ghost at such a young age, and it doesn’t promise that his imaginative new friend will always trust him. But that ambiguity keeps it from falling into the syrupy-sweet traps that make so many kids’ books so irritating.”\n\n—The Daily Beast\n\n\"This tender, wistful tale of friendship, innocence, and belief is an absolute joy—simply and movingly told, with quirky illustrations that tug at the heartstrings even as they raise a smile.\"\n\n—Teach Early Years\n\n\"At it's heart, this tale is an affirmation of friendship and acceptance, with Leo learning that a true friend will love him as he is... It’s also a powerful paean to the wonders of a child’s imagination, and the intricate games about knights and dragons, golden treasures and glorious feasts, initiated by go-getter Jane, have a familiar resonance about them that will make parents smile.\"\n\n—MyLittleStyleFile\n\n★ BUY ★\n\nWith Jory John, illustrations by Kevin Cornell\n\nMiles Murphy is known for one thing and one thing only: pranking.\n\nHe's the best prankster his school has ever seen.

Klassen’s cross-section illustrations give readers a mole’s-eye view of the underground proceedings, extending the spare text with visual humor. As in his previous books, Klassen shows an uncanny knack for conveying meaning with the subtlest of eye movements. How fitting that the wordless final spread features a knowing look between the dog and a cat familiar to Klassen fans; all that’s missing from the trippy conclusion is the theme music from The Twilight Zone. Mind-blowing in the best possible way.\"\n\n—The Horn Book Magazine, Starred Review\n\n★ “When Sam and Dave dig a hole, readers get \"something spectacular.\" The boys, on the other hand, do not. Their quest to find the spectacular brings them painfully and humorously close to buried jewels as they spade their way into the ground, accompanied by an intrepid canine companion. ...

Lucky readers.\n\n—Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review\n\n★ \"Barnett’s comic voice is at its driest as he recounts that quintessential American childhood activity—the digging of the giant hole. ...Cross-sections of earth show them further and further down, and comic tension erupts as readers see gigantic diamonds buried at intervals underground while Sam and Dave tunnel on, missing every one... They land in their own backyard again—or do they? Barnett and Klassen dangle the prospect of fantastic subterranean treasure before readers, but leave them with an even greater reward: a tantalizingly creepy and open-ended conclusion.\"\n\n—Publishers Weekly, Starred Review\n\n★ \"Author Mac Barnett and Canadian author/illustrator Jon Klassen, the dream team who last collaborated on the Caldecott Honor-winning Extra Yarn, reunite for a striking story that is sure to delight… As with Barnett and Klassen’s previous book, the brilliance of Sam and Dave Dig a Hole is the interplay of the deceptively simple text, what the characters know, and what is pictured… Ending with an illustration full of subtext that makes kids think as well as laugh is classic Klassen, and it works. Get ready to add another favorite to your collection.\"\n\n—Quill & Quire, Starred Review\n\n“Two brothers are determined to find “something spectacular” in this clever second collaboration between Barnett and Klassen”\n\n—New York Times\n\n\"Is any childhood truly complete without at least one shovel-wielding foray into shoulder-deep dirt?... A carefully choreographed interplay between Mac Barnett’s straight-faced text (\"So they kept digging\") and Caldecott-winner Jon Klassen’s stylized illustrations.\"\n\n—The Washington Post\n\n\"Mr. Barnett’s economical text works in droll counterpoint with illustrations that become subtly surreal. Soon the hole is so deep that the boys and the dog begin to plummet, only to land back in the soft dirt where they started. Or do they? Tiny clues suggest otherwise in this clever and faintly disconcerting adventure.\"\n\n—Wall Street Journal\n\n\"Klassen’s pebbly, earth-toned, colored-pencil and digital illustrations of Sam and Dave’s dig are exaggerated to comic effect, especially when coupled with Barnett’s dry, simple text. Subtle visual clues (the final absence of dirt on Sam’s and Dave’s clothes; a closing house that’s just slightly different from the opening one) suggest there’s more to the story than meets the eye, and canny little ones will likely be delighted by the beguiling ending.\"\n\n—Booklist\n\n\"The beauty of this story is that it articulates something kids seem to intuitively know, but can’t really explain with language. The way that Klassen’s illustrations tell as much of the story as Barnett’s words is absolutely brilliant.\"\n\n—Globe and Mail\n\n\"An understated, humorous, and charmingly perplexing tale. ... What works spectacularly is the clever play between words and pictures. As in Klassen’s \"This Is Not My Hat,\" readers are in on a joke to which the characters are oblivious. Namely, that each time the boys change direction, they narrowly miss discovering increasingly enormous jewels hidden in the earth. ... Klassen’s use of muted earth tones and uncomplicated compositions is paired well with Barnett’s deadpan humor.\"\n\n—School Library Journal\n\n“The dog in Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen’s Sam & Dave Dig a Hole may be unnamed (indeed in a postmodern touch he’s never mentioned, though he appears on every page) but he plays a vital role by the end of this charming story about two boys who decide to dig a hole one Monday morning….I’m not going to reveal what happens, but the ending is wonderful. This one is Syd’s favourite and goes into our picture book hall of fame.”\n\n—Australian\n\n\"Marvelous. ... Jon Klassen's art, created digitally in colored pencil, adds witty and clever layers to a humorous story about friendship, strategic thinking and determination.\"\n\n—The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\n\"With Barnett's clever prose and Jon Klassen's sly illustrations, this book is one of the best of the year.\"\n\n—East Bay Express\n\n\"Charming... with droll illustrations.\"\n\n—The Buffalo News\n\n\"A visually appealing underground adventure... Kids will love to read, reread and just look at this book.\"\n\n—PBS Parents\n\nThe deliberately poker-faced, almost banal flatness of the text isn’t the joke here but the straight man to the ironic humor of the art (the boys’ elaborate subterranean efforts carefully lead them just past several increasingly huge diamonds). ...

Young excavators will appreciate this surreal modernization of the old notion of digging all the way to China.\n\n—Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books\n\n\"A wryly subtle, unexpectedly funny picture book about two brothers in search of something extraordinary. ... As they dig deeper and deeper (and get dirtier and dirtier), readers will delight in spotting the spectacular items that lie just outside their shovels’ reach. Barnett’s deadpan text and Klassen’s equally restrained illustrations (the dog’s facial expressions alone are priceless) combine to create a picture book rich in dramatic irony and understated hilarity. The limited color palette (heavy on the earth tones, of course), imaginative text and surprising ending combine to create a collaboration that is itself nothing short of spectacular.\"\n\n—BookPage\n\n\"Part wry comedy of errors, part Twilight Zone, this book feels timeless in that it could have been from 50 years ago, or from 50 years in the future (and possibly from another dimension).\"\n\n—Huffington Post\n\n\"A masterwork in humor, subtlety, and surprise, Sam & Dave Dig a Hole will leave readers digging for the truth.\"\n\n—100 Scope Notes\n\n“A funny, deadpan adventure...

But will Peter get the message before his supper gets cold?\n\n★ BUY ★\n\nA BuzzFeed Best Picture Book of 2014\n\nA Reading Today Best Picture Book of 2014\n\nAn Association for Library Service to Children Notables Selection\n\nA Junior Library Guild Selection\n\n★ \"The opening, wordless spread shows a neighborhood with cozy homes, children at play, and happy pets, while above it all a telephone wire hosts an unusual assortment of birds, shown as blobby silhouettes. The page-turn zooms in to show a scene on the wire: an aproned pigeon is directing a young cardinal holding a baseball bat to “tell Peter: Fly home for dinner.” A wacky game of telephone—on the telephone wire—ensues, as a goose in an aviator helmet, a comic book–reading duck, an open-mouthed pelican, and others pass along changed versions of the message (“Lobsters are good hiders…My monster truck has big tires…Something smells like fire!”). By the time the message gets to Owl, it has become (humorously) long and exaggerated: “There’s a giant monster lobster named Homer! He smells like socks and he breathes red fire! His eyes blaze like stars and he rides a crocodile that flies and he’s coming to this wire! Tell Peter to fly! Fly far far away! He’s too young to be somebody’s dinner!” Fortunately, Owl manages to interpret the message correctly and points Peter in the right direction—home for dinner—as the sun sets on the back endpapers. Bright and elegant art done in watercolor, ink, gouache, and pencil depicts amusing details that play up the silliness of each new message iteration, but with plenty of white space to keep it all perfectly clear for readers and listeners.\"\n\n—The Horn Book Magazine, Starred Review\n\n★ “Delightful. . . The idea that one’s own passions\n\naffect the way one engages with the world is . . .\n\npresented with verve and humor.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly, Starred Review\n\n“Raucous avian take on the old-school children’s game, in which the action takes place, naturally, on a telephone wire.”\n\n—New York Times\n\n“An inspired take on the game of Telephone… that young readers will love!”\n\n—School Library Journal\n\nMore from the School Library Journal:\n\n\"Barnett offers an inspired take on the game of Telephone, where a simple sentence is twisted and confused as it passes from person to person. In this case, a mismatched flock of birds perched on a wire (a telephone wire, in fact) are responsible for passing a message from a mother pigeon to her son. Each bird has a unique interest that influences its version of the original message, “Tell Peter: Fly home for dinner,” and guessing each one’s hobby becomes part of the fun of reading the book. The details in the boldly colored illustrations perfectly illuminate the avian personalities, from sweat beads on the nervous turkey, who cries, “Tell Peter: I’m too high up on this wire!” to the pocket square worn by the calm, wise owl, who manages to pass on the instructions accurately. Simple, silly text is kid-friendly and great for read-alouds, while spreads showing the whole line of birds and the houses below will hold any child’s attention. Barnett has created another unique, clever book that young readers will love!\"\n\n—School Library Journal\n\n“Over the top and silly… a great pick for a group read-aloud.”\n\n—Booklist\n\nMore from Booklist:\n\n\"Peter Pigeon’s mom wants him to come home for dinner, so she tells a little bird, “Tell Peter: Fly home for dinner.” That little bird, who’s wielding a baseball bat, tells a bigger bird, “Tell Peter: Hit pop flies and homers.” And so the message grows more convoluted through a long line of birds until it snowballs into something over the top and silly. At last, though, a wise old owl calmly delivers the original message to Peter, who had been playing ball with his other bird friends. Barnett’s simply told, slapstick story of miscommunication is well matched by Corace’s big, bold watercolor illustrations of wacky anthropomorphized birds. Each two-page spread subtly reveals hints for how each bird distorts the message, and the opening and closing pictures of the birds on a telephone wire quietly add to the joke. With short lines and page-filling, laugh-out-loud images, this would be a great pick for a group read-aloud.\"\n\n—Booklist\n\n\"Telephone is an excellent example of a perfect marriage between text and artwork....This picture book will be read over and over, as youngsters pore over every spread to guess what comes next.\"\n\n—Shelf Awareness\n\n★ BUY ★\n\nIllustrated by Chris Van Dusen\n\nGeorge Washington crossed the Delaware in the dead of night.

Lots of silly fun.\n\n—New York Post\n\nThe illustrations perfectly match the tone and tenor of Barnett’s words. Taft is depicted in all his large, naked glory, but the illustrations give the President an air of authority and dignity. The book itself is physically large, though Taft is largest of all, filling up his spacious bathroom with his voluminous body and endless cacophony. Kids will enjoy the humor and energy in this story and be intrigued by the notion that presidents are people, too.\n\n—Library Media Connection\n\nEach page is a deliciously smooth (like chocolate!) series of illustrations of the drama -- images where the rolls of flesh almost become animated themselves.

I’m sure there are other words for it, but the term ‘weird’ sticks out prominently in my mind. So too do the words ‘wacky,’ ‘hypnotic,’ ‘awe-inspiring,’ and ‘potentially hazardous to your health.’ I do not kid. I kid a tiny bit. But the fact of the matter is that if you or a child or you AND a child ever wanted to be a part of a real world treasure hunt, the time is now. For my part, all that I care is that there’s a new book out there with teeny tiny pictures for me to stare glazed-eye at for long periods of time. To stare and stare and stare…. what I really came to like and respect about The Clock Without a Face is that it has no difficulty defining its own audience. The writing and the pictures are hugely kid-friendly. Maybe a child wouldn’t have the wherewithal to solve the puzzles, but there’s always a chance. And where there’s a chance there will be kid fans. I know I’ll be handing my copy to the kids in the bookclub I run with the hope that they find a way to solve it themselves. Because even if they don’t solve it, they’re going to have a heckuva great time obsessing over its wackiness. Fun fun fun.”\n\n—Fuse #8, School Library Journal"
