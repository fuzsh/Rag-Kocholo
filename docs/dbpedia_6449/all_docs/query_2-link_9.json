        "text": "Chris and his brother Sean were high school friends with Rob Lowe, Chad Lowe, Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen. They would frequently make short films together.\n\nHe and his brother Sean Penn also appeared as brothers in Auf kurze Distanz (1986). In addition to that, their actress mother, Eileen Ryan, played their grandmother.\n\nHis scenes where he learned how to dance in Footloose (1984) were added to the script, because he actually didn't know how to dance in real life.\n\nOriginally had a role in American Pie 2 (2001) as Stiffler's dad, but the scenes were cut. (Source: Beneath the Crust: American Pie 2 (2001)).\n\nVicki Roberts hosted a private screening of the movie Vice (2008), which was dedicated to the memory of Chris Penn and which was attended by his mother, Eileen Ryan.\n\nDrank only Bookers bourbon. Liked to drink in the afternoon at burlesque great Betty Rowland's 217 bar in Santa Monica, California.\n\nStarted acting at age 12 at the Loft Studio in Los Angeles and training under acting guru Peggy Feury."
