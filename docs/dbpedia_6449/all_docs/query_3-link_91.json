        "text": "Legislative Work\n\nAgriculture is Pennsylvania’s number one industry and remains a main source of income for our state.\n\nThe issue of education is important to our district and to my work in Congress.\n\nI’ve always fought to protect the rights of every American to choose their doctor and get the treatment which works best for them and their family.\n\n“America’s belief in the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is what makes our nation the greatest in the world. As long as I represent the 16th District of Pennsylvania, I will continue to defend these unalienable rights, and work to protect the most vulnerable among us, especially the unborn.”\n\nRep. Kelly is a strong believer in the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It protects law-abiding citizens from the government’s infringement on our right to keep and bear arms.\n\nRep. Kelly believes every hardworking American deserves a comfortable retirement. With Pennsylvanians living longer and spending more of their golden years in retirement, it is important they have an adequate nest egg for a secure retirement.\n\nAs a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kelly plays an important role in planning for the federal government’s revenue and spending blueprint determining how best to raise revenue and wisely spend taxpayer dollars.\n\nOur infrastructure is strongly interconnected with Americans’ way of life, the U.S. economy, and our national defense. We must reinvest in our country’s infrastructure today to support the cars, planes, and railroads that move goods and services, and the millions of Americans that use federal roads and highways.\n\nThere are many veterans that live in our district and their issues are important to me and to my work in Congress."
