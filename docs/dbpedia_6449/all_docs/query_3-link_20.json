He declined to release details of the illness or say whether the drugs were prescribed.\n\nMedical examiners performed an autopsy yesterday but will not know what caused Penn’s death until toxicology tests are completed in about six weeks.\n\nPenn appeared in numerous films, including Reservoir Dogs, Starsky & Hutch, Rush Hour and Corky Romano.\n\nAmong the tributes to Penn, actor Charlie Sheen said he was the \"best friend a guy could ever hope for\".\n\nSheen and his sibling Emilio Estevez grew up with Penn and his brother Sean, and his father Martin Sheen was one of the first to arrive on the scene of the mystery death to comfort the Reservoir Dogs star's mother.\n\nIn a statement from the Platoon star, Sheen also calls his pal \"a good and decent man\", adding: \"I loved him.\""
