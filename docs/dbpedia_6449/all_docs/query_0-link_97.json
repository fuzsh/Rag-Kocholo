        "text": "Born As: Sean Penn - August 17, 1960 Height: 5' 10\" Place of Birth: Burbank, California\n\nThe son of director Leo Penn and actress Eileen Ryan and brother of actor Chris. Acting since his teens, Penn apprenticed at L.A.'s Group Repertory Theater.\n\nHe made memorable dramatic and comedic impressions with his first film appearances in Taps and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. After a string of \"troubled youth\" roles in the 1980s (Racing with the Moon, The Falcon and the Snowman) and a failed marriage to Madonna, Penn took some time off to pursue directing, starting with The Indian Runner (1991).\n\nHe went back before the camera a few years later, with a new maturity in his range that earned him Oscar nominations for Dead Man Walking (1995) and Sweet and Lowdown (1999). As a blue-collar Boston father tormented by his daughter's murder in Mystic River (2003), Penn received the biggest raves of his career to date.\n\nAll Sean Penn Movies Little House on the Prairie: Season 1 - (1974) Taps - (1981) - PG Fast Times at Ridgemont High - (1982) - R Bad Boys - (1983) - R Racing with the Moon - (1984) - PG At Close Range - (1984) - R The Falcon and the Snowman - (1985) - R Shanghai Surprise - (1986) - PG-13 Judgment in Berlin - (1988) - PG Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam - (1988) - PG-13 Colors - (1988) - R We're No Angels - (1989) - PG-13 Casualties of War - (1989) - R State of Grace - (1990) - R The Indian Runner - (1991) - R Carlito's Way - (1993) - R The Crossing Guard - (1995) - R Dead Man Walking - (1995) - R Mulholland Falls - (1996) - R Hugo Pool - (1997) - R She's So Lovely - (1997) - R U Turn - (1997) - R The Game - (1997) - R Hurlyburly - (1998) - R The Thin Red Line - (1998) - R Sweet and Lowdown - (1999) - PG-13 Up at the Villa - (2000) - PG-13 Bruce Springsteen: Video Anthology - (2000) - NR Before Night Falls - (2000) - R The Weight of Water - (2001) - R Friends: Season 8 - (2001) - NR The Pledge - (2001) - R I Am Sam - (2001) - PG-13 See How They Run - (2002) - NR September 11 - (2002) Dogtown and Z-Boys - (2002) - PG -13 Pauly Shore is Dead - (2003) - R Bjork: Inside Bjork - (2003) - NR It's All About Love - (2003) - R Bukowski: Born into This - (2003) - R 21 Grams - (2003) - R Mystic River - (2003) - R Rated R: Republican in Hollywood - (2004) - TV - PG Viva La Bam: Seasons 2 and 3 - (2004) - NR This So-Called Disaster - (2004) - R The Cutting Edge: Magic of Movie Editing - (2004) - NR The Assassination of Richard Nixon - (2004) - R Two and a Half Men: Season 2 - (2004) - NR The Interpreter - (2005) - PG - 13 All the King's Men - (2006) - PG - 13 Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride - (2006) - NR War Made Easy - (2007) - NR Brando: The Documentary - (2007) - NR Inside the Actors Studio: Leading Men - (2007) - NR Crossing Over - (2007) - NR Into the Wild - (2007) - R What Just Happened? - (2008) - NR\n\nSean Penn on Letterman pt 1\n\nSean Penn on Letterman pt 2\n\nState of Grace Robin Wright, Sean penn, Ed Harris\n\nDance Scene from She's So Lovely\n\nI am Sam\n\nI am Sam\n\nI Am Sam - The Re-Cut\n\nFine Dining with Sean Penn\n\nI Am Sam // Heartbeats\n\nMystic River - Sean, Is That My Daughter In There?\n\nJennifer Lopez in \"U Turn \" (1997)\n\nColors\n\nHurlyburly - The Restaurant Dispute\n\nHurlyburly - The Dispute over Darlene\n\nDead Man Walking Trailer\n\nExecutionscene on \"Dead man walking\""
