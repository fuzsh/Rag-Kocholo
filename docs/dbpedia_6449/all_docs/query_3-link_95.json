We also continue out countdown towards that game by looking at the jersey number history for the Saints with No. 31. This number has a very short livelihood in Saints history, as only 13 players have ever worn it, including the current wearer in Jordan Howden.\n\nHere is the full list of players to wear No. 31 for the Saints from Pro Football Reference:\n\nJordan Howden (2023-2024)\n\nEno Benjamin (2022)\n\nDavid Johnson (2022)\n\nBryce Thompson (2022)\n\nDesmond Trufant (2021)\n\nChris Banjo (2017-2018)\n\nJairus Byrd (2014-2016)\n\nChris Carr (2013)\n\nJerome Murphy (2012)\n\nPierson Prioleau (2009-2010)\n\nAaron Glenn (2008)\n\nRichard Newsome (2001)\n\nJim Taylor (1967)"
