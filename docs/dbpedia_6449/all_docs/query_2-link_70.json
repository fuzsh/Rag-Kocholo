I watched my Resevoir Dogs DVD just yesterday, and recalling how The Wild Life was a pretty funny movie that should have given Penn more success.\n\nPolice on the scene did not suspect foul play. No cause of death has been determined at this point. Penn had put on a good amount of weight over the last decade, but passing away at 40 (or 43 depending on which account is accurate) is still a scary surprise. My cholesterol tries to run high and I'm only a few years younger than that.\n\nDamn, that's a screwed up shame. RIP, Chris. God be with you.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nSteve Scott\n\nPhenomenal Film Handler\n\nPosts: 1300\n\nFrom: Minneapolis, MN\n\nRegistered: Sep 2000\n\nposted 01-26-2006 11:53 AM Friends & I are all quite shocked by this. Chris was such a natural actor, a cordial bad guy in the best way. He deserved bigger parts for the spirit he put into his roles.\n\nWe'll see you when the clouds come home Chris.\n\n| IP: Logged"
