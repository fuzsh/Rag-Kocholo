Authorities are investigating the cause of his death but said they do not suspect foul play.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Penn, the younger brother of actor Sean Penn, specialized in working-class, regular-guy characters, and had roles in a long list of movies and television programs during a career that spanned more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Santa Monica police were called by a housekeeper in Penn&#39;s first-floor unit at 1033 Ocean Ave. just after 4 p.m. Tuesday and arrived to find the actor&#39;s body in his bed, authorities said. Lt. Frank Fabrega of the Santa Monica Police Department said officers were conducting a death investigation but have no evidence of homicide.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Coroner&#39;s officials will seek to determine the cause of death and will conduct toxicology tests, Fabrega said. But asked late Tuesday whether Penn&#39;s death appeared to be the result of anything other than natural causes, coroner&#39;s spokesman Ed Winter said: &#34;Not at this time.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Though less well known than Sean, the younger Penn won praise for a series of supporting roles in major films, including &#34;Footloose&#34; and &#34;Reservoir Dogs.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Possessed of a hefty build, protruding chin and slightly pouting lips, Chris Penn looked the part of the ordinary guy, small-time crook or occasionally a cop.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Penn began his career as a child performer in the 1970s and moved on to films such as &#34;Rumble Fish&#34; and &#34;All the Right Moves.&#34; He played the role of an awkward teenager who says he can&#39;t dance in &#34;Footloose,&#34; and starred in one of that movie&#39;s most memorable scenes, when Kevin Bacon ultimately teaches him some moves.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Perhaps his best known role, however, was as Nice Guy Eddie in the 1992 film &#34;Reservoir Dogs.&#34; The character he brought to life &#8212; both disturbing and humorous &#8212; caught critics&#39; attention. After that, Penn played a series of sidekick roles, in such recent movies as &#34;Starsky &amp;amp;amp;amp; Hutch&#34; and &#34;Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Throughout his work, critics marked striking moments in his performances and often called him underrated. &#34;Just as talented as Sean &#8212; just a lot less cocky,&#34; Slate magazine critic Cintra Wilson wrote of him last year. &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Born Christopher Penn in 1965, he was the son of Eileen Ryan and the late Leo Penn.
