        "text": "Not to be confused with Leo Genn.\n\nLeo Zalman Penn (August 27, 1921 – September 5, 1998) was an American television director and actor. He was the father of musician Michael Penn and actors Sean and Chris Penn.\n\nEarly life\n\nPenn was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the son of a Russian-Jewish immigrant mother, Elizabeth (née Melincoff; 1890–1961) and Maurice Daniel Penn (né Pinon; 1897–1981), who was of Lithuanian-Jewish descent. Leo Penn served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II as a B-24 Liberator bombardier with the 755th Bomb Squadron, 458th Bomb Group, stationed in England as part of the Eighth Air Force.\n\nCareer\n\nA life member of The Actors Studio, Penn won the Theatre World Award in 1954 for his performance in the play The Girl on the Via Flaminia. He acted in numerous roles in the early years of television. In 1956, he was cast as Mr. Rico in the episode \"Ringside Padre\" of the religion anthology series Crossroads. In 1957, he appeared in the episode \"One If by Sea\" of the military drama series, Navy Log. He was also cast in an episode of Beverly Garland's 1957–1958 groundbreaking crime drama Decoy. In 1960, he played Cavage in \"The Poker Fiend\" on Richard Boone's CBS western series Have Gun – Will Travel. In 1961, he was cast as Tiko in the episode \"The World Is Her Oyster\" of the ABC adventure series The Islanders, set in the South Pacific, and appeared in an episode of the ABC crime drama The Asphalt Jungle. He also appeared in another ABC adventure series Straightaway, which focuses on automobile racing. On March 3, 1961, he co-starred with Peter Falk and Joyce Van Patten in the episode \"Cold Turkey\" of the ABC legal drama series The Law and Mr. Jones starring James Whitmore. About this time, he also appeared on Pat O'Brien's ABC sitcom Harrigan and Son. In the 1961–1962 television season, Penn acted in the CBS crime drama Checkmate in the episode \"The Button-Down Break\" and starred as Jerry Green in Gertrude Berg's CBS's sitcom Mrs. G. Goes to College renamed at mid-season as The Gertrude Berg Show.\n\nPenn landed work as a director for many television series, including I Spy, Lost in Space, Cannon, Star Trek, Blue Light, Custer, the 1976 western Sara, St. Elsewhere, Kojak, Starsky and Hutch, Cagney & Lacey, Little House on the Prairie, Columbo, Hawaii Five-O, Trapper John, M.D., Hart To Hart, Magnum, P.I., and Father Murphy. In 1983, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series for The Mississippi.\n\nPolitics\n\nPenn supported the Hollywood trade unions and refused to accuse others to the House Un-American Activities Committee in their investigation of suspected Communist infiltration of the film industry. He was subsequently blacklisted, and Paramount refused to renew his contract. As a result, Penn was not able to work as a movie actor. He found acting work in television, but CBS ousted him after receiving an anonymous accusation that he had addressed a Communist political meeting. Barred from acting in film or TV, he became a director.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nPenn married Eileen Ryan in 1957, and they had three sons: Michael Penn, Sean Penn, and Chris Penn. He died from lung cancer at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, on September 5, 1998, at the age of 77.\n\nFilmography\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1946 The Best Years of Our Lives ATC Corporal Uncredited 1947 Fall Guy Tom Cochrane 1949 The Undercover Man Sydney Gordon Not Wanted Steve Ryan 1959 The Story on Page One Morrie Goetz 1962 Birdman of Alcatraz Eddie Kassellis Uncredited A Man Called Adam Director 1977 Sixth and Main Doc 1984 The Wild Life Tom's Dad 1995 The Crossing Guard Hank\n\nSee also"
