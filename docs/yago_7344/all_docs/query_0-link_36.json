        "text": "Not since last year’s The Fly has a movie insect been so welcome on the scene: Black Widow is a voluptuous, sinful modern film noir, featuring two of our surest actresses. It’s a seductive mystery, teeming with delicious touches and unexpected colors.\n\nWhat elusive director Bob Rafelson and his actors have done is transform a reasonably good story – about a federal investigator (Debra Winger) tracking down a woman (Theresa Russell) who marries rich men and kills them – into something entirely richer, more suggestive, than your average mystery movie.\n\nRafelson, an odd figure who makes movies only every few years (this is just his fourth since Five Easy Pieces in 1970), has come up with his most stylish film to date. The screen shimmers with knockout primary colors and perverse images: a red fan atop a deadly ebony liquor cabinet, the orange spout of a Hawaiian volcano as two characters stand in “the newest place on the planet,” the shiver of expressionism as Theresa Russell strides into a darkened room like Murnau’s Nosferatu. The story takes place mainly in Hawaii and Seattle (many interiors were shot in the old Seattle Post-Intelligencer building), and Rafelson extracts the maximum atmosphere out of each.\n\nIn terms of sheer suspense and the nimble unspooling of a complicated plot, Black Widow prohably offers more chewy fun than any film of this genre since Body Heat. My only nag is that the ending, in which justice is served, is actually something of a letdown (that’s how perverse the film is).\n\nRafelson is interested in more than simple yarn-spinning. As with his previous film, The Postman Always Rings Twice, he uses the film-noir mode as a vehicle for exploring the furtive passions and anxieties of people who are outside the mainstream. He’s intrigued by the dark, strange undercurrents that course through his characters’ lives.\n\nSo that, for instance, the murderess played by Russell – a character who ought to be repellent by realistic standards – becomes deeply alluring, both to the audience (well, to me anyway) and to Winger’s investigator. But it’s not black-and-white; her victims (played by Dennis Hopper, Nicol Williamson, and Sami Frey) are all sympathetically portrayed.\n\nThere are also surprises for Winger’s character; she is increasingly revealed as an empty figure, whose pursuit of the criminal becomes obsessive: she even strikes up an uneasy friendship with Russell. It’s some of Winger’s most controlled work ever.\n\nRussell is a powerful actress who generally works for her husband, Nicolas Roeg, which means that lately she hasn’t been seen much (Bad Timing, Insignificance). I hope this role places her in the forefront of American actresses: that’s where she belongs. She moves through the film with delectable dangerousness, a ripe candy apple full of poison.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, February 1987\n\nUntil going through these 80s reviews, I did not realize my Theresa Russell drum-beating was quite so strident. But there it is. There was something luscious and mysterious about the film; I wonder if that quality survives today? David Mamet turns up as an actor (he might have been shooting House of Games in Seattle at the time?), and the cast also has Diane Ladd, James Hong, Terry O’Quinn, and Mary Woronov. Conrad Hall shot it.\n\nAt a point late in Physical Evidence, public defender Theresa Russell turns to client Burt Reynolds and mutters the hokiest line in a movie full of hokey lines: “How did I ever get mixed up with you?”\n\nWell she might ask. Russell is an actress whose career has been on a steady upward curve, mixing commercial movies (Black Widow) with her husband Nicolas Roeg’s more stylishly esoteric films (lnsignjficance, Track 29). With Physical Evidence, a project that would appear to have a measure of box-office success built into it, Russell steps straight into an unequivocal clunker.\n\nIt would be easy to blame this stinker on Burt Reynolds, the once-bright star who’s been jinxed for the last few years. Reynolds’ bad luck seems to be rubbing off on everything be touches. It’s been so terrible lately that he’s even gone back to television to try to revive his career.\n\nHowever, Reynolds turns out to be the best thing about Physical Evidence. He plays a short-fused Boston cop who’s suspected in the murder of a sleazeball. Russell is the defense attorney who doesn’t quite know whether she should believe him. Does this sound at all like Jagged Edge or Suspect? It should, but only to the extent that this thing almost makes those movies look good.\n\nThe case, such as it is, dribbles along in its way to an entirely expected conclusion. Michael Crichton, who directed, is a kind of jack-of-all-trades who occasionally comes up with a dumbly entertaining movie (as with the loopy Tom Selleck sc-fi film Runaway). But Crichton can manage only a morbidly amusing prologue here in which a would-be suicide is distracted by a corpse just before he’s about to jump from a bridge. (The suicide has tied a sign around his neck that says, “Sorry Now?”) But the film is mostly humorless, and exceedingly drab-­looking; Crichton’s idea for a scene topper is to have Theresa Russell flip the bird to the prosecutor (Ned Beatty).\n\nSo there is Burt Reynolds, who appears to be attempting an interesting characterization in his first few scenes. He’s got the look and the movements down. His cop is a weary professional, a man of violence whose hair is showing gray and whose stomach is going to fat. Reynolds has a real bead on the guy, but then the movie seems to lose interest in him, and the formula takes over. Nice try, Burt, but the jury is still out.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, January 28, 1989\n\nIzzat a socko title or what? Physical Evidence is what it’s called, all sexed up and ready to fit into the 80s run of legal thrillers. Crichton did not direct a feature again, but returned successfully to his day job. For the record, Henry Mancini did the music and John Alonzo shot this one.\n\nThe film Insignificance is built on the conceit, a favorite of playwrights, that a bunch of famous people find themselves fictionally thrown together for a brief spell. In this case, the main confrontation takes place between Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThat’s quite a combo – although, if memory serves, Shelley Winters once revealed that Marilyn privately named Einstein as the man she’d most like to sleep with. Hmmm. Perhaps that’s where the original idea for the play came from. Nicolas Roeg has adapted the play into an entertaining movie, although the film doesn’t have the substance it seems to think it has.\n\nMarilyn (Theresa Russell) pays a call on Einstein (Michael Emil) one night while he’s holed up in a hotel room, in 1955 or so. (Actually, none of the characters is named, although it’s obvious whom they’re mean to represent.) He wants to get some shut-eye, but she wants to discuss the theory of relativity; which she proceeds to explain to him using a sackful of audio-visual aids just purchased at a local toy store.\n\nLater, Marilyn proposes an entirely more fleshly consciousness-raising, which Einstein analytically considers.\n\nIt’s not just a two-person show. A bulky ex-ballplayer (Gary Busey), Marilyn’s jealous husband, intrudes on the scene. He’s only loosely based on Monroe’s husband, Joe DiMaggio. And a vicious political thug (Tony Curtis), bearing some resemblance to Joseph McCarthy, badgers Einstein for the latest scientific paper.\n\nThe film is properly amusing at first, although it turns more predictable as it veers in to heavy-handedness in the later going. Indeed, the film would be – well, pretty insignificant – were it not for the attractive presence of the actors.\n\nMichael Emil, who usually acts in his brother Henry Jaglom’s films (Always, Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?), has a deadpan, slightly distracted delivery that makes him perfect for Einstein. Yes, the right half of his brain might well be thinking about relativity, while the left half handles the conversational chores.\n\nBusey has some unnerving moments, and Curtis seems energized at being called upon to really act, after years of slipshod work.\n\nAnd Theresa Russell, who is married to Roeg, may well be the most neglected great actress in the movies. Her films seem to be ignored (Bad Timing, The Razor’s Edge) or not released at all (Eureka), but one of these days she’s going to break through.\n\nI doubt whether Insignificance will trigger that breakthrough; it’s too far from the mainstream, and her performance, while witty, is more of an inspired imitation than the kind of soulful acting she’s delivered in the past. But her moment will come.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, January 17, 1986\n\nI guess the moment never really came for Theresa Russell, although she had a big chance in Black Widow in ’87, and continued to do interesting work for Roeg and others. I like this kind of movie, where incongruous actors are lumped together in a weird mix. How did Roeg think of Michael Emil? Was he a secret Henry Jaglom fan? One thinks about these things.\n\nAfter Track 29, the “Chattanooga Choo Choo” may never sound the same again. The song gives the movie its title (you know—”Track 29/Boy you can give me a shine”), and it’s prominently featured in a sequence in which a doctor gives a rousing revival speech before an audience of railroad enthusiasts, at the same time a truck is crashing through his house, where his wife’s fantasy child is trashing the doctor’s elaborate computer-operated train set.\n\nThis thumbnail description doesn’t being to convey the madness of the sequence, so you can imagine what watching it is like. The perpetrators of Track 29 are two of Britain’s most provocative talents: director Nicolas Roeg, the creator of Performance and The Man Who Fell to Earth, and screenwriter Dennis Potter, who previously wrote Pennies from Heaven and Dreamchild.\n\nRoeg and Potter seem to have egged each other on, into the far reaches of the bizarre. Track 29 tells the tale of a bored housewife (Theresa Russell, who is also Roeg’s wife) in a small town in the American South.\n\nStultified by her marriage to a doctor (Christopher Lloyd) who prefers the company of his train set, she becomes intrigued by the presence of a young Englishman (Gary Oldman, who played Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy).\n\nThe drifter says he is her long-lost son who was taken away from her when she was 15 years old and unmarried. She believes him, despite the fact that he appears to be her own age. But then again, it becomes increasingly apparent that the young man exists only in her mind—that he is born out of her frustration and her desire to have a child.\n\nHer husband considers her “totally loco” (no train pun intended); he’s busy spending time with a nurse (Sandra Bernhard) who spanks him while they listen to tape-recorded railroad sounds.\n\nThe whole thing plays like something Tennessee Williams might have written after a really, really lost weekend. There is some tired satire of American society, but most of the film examines the peculiar psychosexual unhappiness of the Theresa Russell character. Russell, the star of Black Widow, is a good, daring actress, but there’s never much more than sheer kinkiness at play here, and she has little opportunity to create a performance.\n\nRoeg’s films are getting stranger. They were always odd, but they used to be weird-brilliant, or at least weird-interesting. Now they’re just weird-weird. We have a right to expect more.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, October 7, 1988\n\nThis movie must have some defenders, but I’ve never heard of it crawling up to the level of cult film or anything like that. I stand by everything but the last line of the review; we don’t really have a right to expect anything, and a filmmaker like Roeg can do what he wants. I wish this movie had worked, though."
