        "text": "Nicolas Roeg (born August 15, 1928, London, England—died November 23, 2018) was an English filmmaker known for his striking visual style and uncompromising, often controversial, narrative choices.\n\nRoeg had an unconventional start as a filmmaker. He did not attend university, but in 1947 he apprenticed as a film editor at a small film studio, often making tea for others. In the 1950s and ’60s he operated a camera on several films, including Tarzan’s Greatest Adventure (1959) and The Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960). He did second unit photography work on the acclaimed 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia and was the cinematographer for such films as A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966) and Fahrenheit 451 (1966).\n\nAll these experiences gave him insight into moviemaking and helped shape him as a director. By the time Roeg made his directorial debut, he had been in the film industry for more than two decades. His first film, Performance (1970), codirected with Donald Cammell, was a psychedelic drama starring Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones as a former pop superstar who is drawn into the criminal underworld of 1960s London when he takes in a gangster on the run."
