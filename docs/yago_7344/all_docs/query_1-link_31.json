        "text": "Famous Muses & Girlfriends in Filmmaking Pt. 10\n\nMUSE: Theresa Russell (born Theresa Lynn Paup)\n\nNGL, it took me like a week to decide if Theresa should be included in the movie muses group or the music muses, because she was a big inspiration for both filmmaker Nicolas Roeg and musician Pete Townshend. But I decided to go with movie muse just because she actually ended up marrying Nic, lol. Theresa was born March 20th, 1957 in San Diego, CA, as the oldest of five kids. She relocated to Burbank at age 5 when her mom got divorced and re-married. Theresa began modeling at 12 when the family started having financial problems, and later dropped out of Burbank High School in her junior year to move in with her 28-year-old boyfriend (yikes). A year later she began taking acting classes at the Lee Strasberg Institute in Hollywood. Around that time, Theresa’s photographer friend Peter Douglas (son of Kirk) introduced her to producer Sam Spiegel. Spiegel instantly wanted her cast as the female lead in influential director Elia Kazan’s final film, The Last Tycoon (1976). The biopic on Irving Thalberg’s impressive career turned out to be a complete dud quality and box-office wise, but Theresa still got to work with big A-listers like Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Robert Mitchum at 18. Her second film, Straight Time (1978) co-starring Dustin Hoffman, fared better with critics and audiences.\n\nDuring production of her third movie—Bad Timing (1980) with Art Garfunkel—Theresa began a romantic relationship with their director, Nicolas Roeg. The acclaimed English filmmaker was 30 years older and had four children from a previous marriage, but nonetheless, the two were apparently quickly attracted to each other. At the same time Nic and Theresa were courting each other, guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend of the Who also found himself interested in Theresa. In his 2012 memoir, Who I Am, Pete went as far as to call her “the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen.” The Who single ‘Who are You’ was featured prominently during a sequence of Bad Timing (the song choice was allegedly Theresa’s idea too). Pete was so impressed with the film that he was hoping Nic would adapt his abandoned concept album ‘Lifehouse’ into a movie. Instead all Pete ended up doing was growing an obsession with Nic’s girlfriend. Pete and Theresa officially met one weekend in LA when Nic was out of town in 1980. The two went on a couple of wild, late night dates until Theresa informed Pete that she was just having some fun and was only interested in being serious with Nic. Pete was super bummed, but apparently still thought he had a chance and kept trying to woo her with flowers et al. When Nic discovered that Pete asked out Theresa, she dropped Pete immediately and Nic suddenly wasn’t interested in working on a movie with Pete anymore. So Pete ultimately left Hollywood with no ‘Lifehouse’ adaptation and no new hot girlfriend, and had to settle on going back home to his own hot wife and family. Poor baby.\n\nBut Theresa’s impact didn’t stop there. The feelings may not have been mutual between the starlet and the angsty rockstar, but Pete eventually penned a new song for her called ‘Athena.’ Originally called ‘Theresa,’ the title and lyrics became slightly modified by the time the track was included on the 1982 Who album ‘It’s Hard.’ The repeating lyric of “she’s just a girl,” originated from Pete’s personal driver’s response to Pete’s coke induced venting after Theresa denied him.\n\nThat same year Nic and Theresa would get married and go on to make five more films together: Eureka (1983), Insignificance (1985), Track 29 (1988), Cold Heaven (1991), and Hotel Paradise (1995). They also have two sons, Statten (born in 1983) and Maximillian (born in 1985). The couple were so private with their relationship, it’s not even public knowledge when exactly they divorced. But it had to be sometime between 1995 and 2004, as in the latter year Nic met and became engaged to his third and current wife. Throughout the 1970s-‘80s, Theresa was considered one of the sexiest screen actresses and usually got good reviews for her performances. Besides her movies with Nic, her career also includes Bob Rafelson’s Black Widow (1987), Ken Russell’s Whore (1991), Steven Soderbergh’s Kafka (1991) and John McNaughton’s Wild Things (1998).\n\nFun fact: in 8th grade, Theresa was close friends and classmates with Randy Rhoads and Kelly Garni of Quiet Riot."
