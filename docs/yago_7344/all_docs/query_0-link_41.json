        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- Theresa Russell enjoyed working with Michael Crichton in her new movie 'Physical Evidence,' but he's far from her favorite director.\n\nHer heart belongs to Nicolas Roeg, who directed her in five films - 'Bad Timing - A Sensual Obsession,' 'Eureka,' 'Insignificance,' 'Track 29' and 'Aria.'\n\nSince their first film together in 1980, Russell and Roeg have been keeping house. They married three years ago after becoming the parents of two sons, Maxim and Statten.\n\nWhile she welcomes the opportunity to work with other directors, Russell prefers working with Roeg -- even though it was her role of a sensuous murderer in 'Black Widow,' directed by Bob Rafelson in 1986, that brought her major stardom.\n\nHer new film is 'Physical Evidence,' co-starring with Burt Reynolds.\n\nNeither Russell nor Roeg puts their working relationship above individual career decisions.\n\n'Nicolas just directed 'Witches' with Angelica Huston,' she said. 'And he did 'Castaway' a couple of years ago and I wasn't in that. He wanted an English actress for the part, so I wasn't considered.\n\n'When I get offered a script without a director already assigned I think about whether it would be a good project for Nick. Sometimes we get scripts asking both of us to participate. That's what happened with 'Track 29.' Usually Nick finds a script and asks me if I want to work in it.\n\n'Sometimes, rarely, I go on the set when he's directing another actress. I hear him tell her, 'Oh, darling, that was wonderful.' I don't get any of that. With me it's, 'OK. Print. Next!'\n\n'I'm not a prima donna, but when I get angry with a director I may stalk off to my dressing room, but it's not cool to do that with your husband. It's difficult when I get frustrated with him. Instead of getting furious with Nick I may go to my trailer in tears.\n\n'Sometimes when I think Nick is being unnecessarily harsh with me,' she said, 'I'll take him aside and say, 'If you do that again, I'll freak out. You wouldn't do it to other actresses so why do it to me.''\n\nRussell would like to make more films with Roeg in the future, but they've agreed it isn't a good idea for them to gain a reputation for working as a team.\n\n'We don't want an exclusive career thing involved,' she said, adding that they leave career and professional problems at the office rather than taking their work home with them .\n\n'The big advantage of working together so often is we have a mental shorthand between us,' she said. 'I don't need much direction from Nick because I already know the angle from which he will approach a scene, which gives me an advantage over the other actors.\n\n'And it helps Nick concentrate on the other actors because he already knows what I'm going to do without discussion.\n\n'If I have trouble with a scene, all he has to say is five words to me and I'll say, 'Yeah, yeah. Shut up, I've got it.' That saves a lot of time and money.\n\n'On the down side, it's hard for me to surprise Nick on the set. And it's fun to surprise a director with a different approach to a scene. When I'm able to do that with Nick, it really makes my week.\n\n'When he directs me in a hot love scene, Nick says he's glad he's directing to keep things from getting out of hand.\n\n'Working together has helped our marriage. When you live with a person you forget the professional side of him, the characteristics that attracted you to him in the first place. When you get in the professional arena with your spouse, you admire him all over again.'"
