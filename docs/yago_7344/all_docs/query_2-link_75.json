        "text": "Debra Winger was one of the highest-paid actresses in the world during the 1980s thanks to performances in films such as Terms of Endearment and An Officer and a Gentleman. She also had three Oscar nominations for best actress under her belt. Then, at the age of 40, she retired, causing shockwaves through the film industry.\n\nWinger no longer has to worry what the movers and shakers of Hollywood think or say about her. It was, she says, probably the best moment of a 20-year film career. She had quit. She had ruled herself out of being a contender for any more major film acting roles. \"Nothing,\" she insists, \"quite compares with the sense of liberation I felt. It stays with me: I am happy and I am free. There are no more auditions, no more waiting for phone calls, no more depending on the judgment of others. I can do what I like, go where I like and say what I like.\"\n\nWinger, now 47, has beaten Hollywood at its own game. She won her third Oscar nomination for the 1993 film, Shadowlands, playing New York divorcee Joy Gresham in the story of her real-life romance with celebrated author CS Lewis (played by Sir Anthony Hopkins). There was one final major role, two years later, opposite Billy Crystal in the romantic comedy, Forget Paris.\n\nAfter that, it was over. She told her agent not to accept anything on her behalf. The chief executives in Los Angeles film studios could not believe it. They continued to send her scripts. But they remained unread. Attempts were made to reach her by telephone, so she changed her number.\n\nShe had already divorced actor Timothy Hutton, by whom she has a 15-year-old son, Noah. Then she surprised close friends by marrying little-known actor Arliss Howard and having another son, Babe, now aged four and a half. They live 3,000 miles from Los Angeles, on a small farm in the foothills of the Catskill mountains in upstate New York.\n\n\"I do not need a lot of money to be happy,\" she says. \"I had a new marriage, I wanted another child and it seemed ridiculous to run off for three months to do another film. I had also reached 40, a point in life when things can get really tough in Hollywood. I looked around and thought: It's time to go.\"\n\nHer decision impressed those she left behind to such a degree that she is now the subject of a documentary film, Searching for Debra Winger, produced and directed by the 42-year-old actress Rosanna Arquette. She spent 10 months interviewing more mature star actresses such as Jane Fonda, 64, Charlotte Rampling, 57, and Vanessa Redgrave, 65 - plus younger ones such as Holly Hunter, 44, Frances McDormand, 45, and Theresa Russell, also 45 - about the pressures and drawbacks of working in a film world where youth is so adored.\n\nBut, central to the theme of the film, is Winger, who had actually taken the giant step contemplated by them all. \"Hollywood wants to put me out to pasture, when I really want to rock,\" complains Arquette. \"Debra had the courage to choose life, putting her art on hold, so she could get total control. That takes courage, which we all admire.\"\n\nBut such admiration has, so far, not induced any of them to follow her example. As Holly Hunter, who won an Oscar for best actress in 1993 for The Piano, says, somewhat despairingly: \"I now look at people like Susan Sarandon [55], Barbara Hershey [54], Meryl Streep [50] and Jessica Lange [53], who are sexual and take great risks. I just wish that there was a way that we could make better use of that talent.\"\n\nThe documentary, shown at the Cannes film festival this year, has drawn Winger back into the spotlight, but clearly very much on her own terms. For a start, she is not at all frustrated about her talent not being used. Nor is she losing a single night's sleep over what she does next. She looks youthful, with her shoulder-length brown hair falling carelessly over her shoulders. Her distinctive blue eyes fix my own with a steady gaze of certainty and she talks in that renowned smoky voice (so low that she was the voice of ET in 1982).\n\n\"I look at women in Hollywood, my age or a little older, and some of them are creating the problem themselves,\" she says. \"They do not accept their age, physically. They start doing things to their face and body which are designed to make them look less than their real age. They feel pressure to constantly play women who are younger. I don't think it is worth trying to look 10 years younger through surgery. It is too high a price to pay.\"\n\nWinger has always spoken her mind. Even an Oscar nomination for the 1982 film, An Officer and a Gentleman, did not stop her calling co-star Richard Gere \"a brick wall\" and its director, Taylor Hackford, \"an animal.\" In 1993, she walked off the set of A League of Their Own, a film about an all-woman baseball team, furious that director Penny Marshall had hired Madonna. In 1990, John Malkovich, her co-star in The Sheltering Sky, was derided by her as nothing more than a \"catwalk model\".\n\nOnce filming was over, she lived for a time with Tuareg tribesmen, deep in the Sahara desert, because, she said, she needed to \"recover from the experience\". Winger, who won her second Oscar nomination on the 1983 film, Terms of Endearment, moved co-star Shirley MacLaine - not always known for her tact - to declare: \"She marches to the beat of a different drummer than the rest of us.\"\n\nWinger is unmoved at the memories of such blunt verdicts. \"The only remarks that ever made print were those that ruffled a few feathers,\" she says, not looking in the least concerned. \"I run in to Richard Gere quite a lot and he half jokes: 'Are you still saying terrible things about me?' We had a moment in our life which was not good, but everyone has to get it into perspective.\n\n\"I had this reputation for being 'difficult'. But would a man have suffered the same accusation? He would probably have been admired for speaking his mind and be called a 'perfectionist'. There have been several men who have been able to appreciate the difference. Richard Attenborough, who directed me in Shadowlands, springs to mind. He is not a sexist and treated myself and Tony Hopkins as equals.\n\n\"As for Tony, he's a friend. He has become even more American than I am now and lives permanently in Los Angeles. He loves the place. I am sure you guys make fun of him all the time. He's nuts, but he's great. You need more people like that. He does not mind what he says, knows his way around a film set and has such charm and talent that people always like working with him.\"\n\nIt seems almost ungallant to say this now, since Winger is being so very open, but I recall meeting her 10 years ago on a summer's afternoon in Oxford, on the set of Shadowlands, when she insisted on doing her interview standing up and in the open air. This meant, I was told, that she could walk away at any time should she be offended by any of the questions. It did not make for the easiest of conversations.\n\n\"This is what the business can turn you into,\" she says.\"It can make us all so neurotic about what is written about us and what is being said. You live by your image and what others think of you. I never considered myself falling into that trap very often, but obviously I did.\n\n\"An actress in a film starts every day with an hour and a half in front of a mirror, with hair and make-up and costumes. That is unnatural - too much unnatural attention. I was never too confident about my beauty, to tell the truth, and that puts you on edge. As a result, I would not do many interviews and would always seem to regret them when I read the result. It made me very cautious.\"\n\nSuch caution among actresses is also a theme of Searching for Debra Winger. Jane Fonda emphasises that she always felt protective towards her private life, particularly before meeting her now ex-husband, Ted Turner. \"I never had a truly intimate relationship until I met him,\" she admits. Whoopi Goldberg, 52, reveals that she had to sacrifice being a good parent because of her ambition to succeed. \"Some things cannot be stopped,\" she says. \"Could I have done it a lot differently? Yes. Would I? No.\"\n\nBut Winger is putting caution aside now, particularly when talking of husband Arliss: \"We met 10 years ago on rehearsals for a film called Wilder Napalm. It was fall-down-dead love at first sight, for me. But despite such a spark, we both refused to act on it for quite some time. I was free, but he was still trying to work something out in a relationship.\n\n\"We put it off and put it off until I finally said: 'Oh, this is ridiculous.' I told him that, for some reason, I had never thought I would live to old age and I wanted to seize this opportunity. So I made the first move. It is not something I regret in the slightest.\"\n\nAfter their marriage, six years ago, she was determined to have another baby. \"I had no doubt that I wanted to have a child with Arliss and if I paid a price on the physical side of things, with tiredness, then that price was worth it,\" she says.\n\n\"My grandmother gave birth to 13 children and I come from a long line of women who gave birth in their 40s. It was a great decision, even though I suffered an energy crisis in that first year.\"\n\nWinger, born in Cleveland, Ohio, to an orthodox Jewish family, moved to Los Angeles when she was a child and left home at 17. She went to college to study a sociology degree but nearly died in the first few months. She fell from a pick-up truck at an amusement park, where she had a holiday job. It left her partially paralysed and temporarily blind. In her 12-month recuperation, she decided to follow her instincts and act for a living.\n\nShe made a few unexceptional film appearances in the late 70s, before her sudden leap to fame in 1980 in Urban Cowboy with John Travolta. In a memorable scene she sexily straddles a mechanical bucking bronco. Even husband Arliss has since declared: \"Is there a man alive who doesn't remember her on that darned bull?\"\n\nHe is now masterminding Winger's brief return to film acting, directing and co-starring with her in the small-budget Big Bad Love, adapted from the short stories of Mississippi writer, Larry Brown. Arliss plays Leon Barlow, a hard-drinking Vietnam veteran who lives alone in the wilds of the American south, following a split from his bitter wife, Marilyn, played by Winger, who has custody of their two children. It is a simple story, with a twist of tragedy, showing a damaged man trying to come to terms with a series of defeats. In several scenes, Winger shows what we have been missing. \"Big Bad Love started with Arliss saying: 'Why don't you come and see if you can act in a film and trust again,'\" she says. \"It was fun and we hope it will live up to everyone's expectations.\"\n\nIt will not lead to an instant return to Hollywood. \"I have enjoyed a wonderful run in films, so far, and I may, at some point, come back,\" she says. \"But it will be in my own time and in my own style.\""
