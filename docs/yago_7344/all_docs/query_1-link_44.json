        "text": "Twenty years ago this month, Nicolas Roeg's Bad Timing was briefly and reluctantly released into the community, its own distributor, Rank, condemning it as \"a sick film made by sick people for sick people\". Roeg, then 52, was the visionary firebrand of British cinema, a great underground artist in full flow after the dizzyingly edited mosaics of four earlier works - Performance (1970), Walkabout (1970), Don't Look Now (1973) and The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976).\n\nHe was used to controversy and the repulsion of financiers. Warner Brothers had suppressed Performance for two years and wanted to sue him for unprofessional conduct after viewing its disorienting gender meltdown. But the reaction to Bad Timing was something else. \"Sick... sick... sick,\" said the man from Rank. And it has stayed buried ever since, like a guilty secret. It has never been re-released. It hasn't been available on video for many years - almost uniquely for work from such a major director.\n\nBad Timing barely has a plot. It only really has four characters: psychology professor Alex (Art Garfunkel), his lover Milena (Theresa Russell), her husband Stefan (Denholm Elliott) and Austrian detective Netusil (Harvey Keitel), who interrogates Alex after Milena's attempted suicide.\n\nAll that really happens is that Roeg unravels the strands trapping two people in love. Flashbacks show Garfunkel - poised, repressed, a professional voyeur who lends his expertise to Nato military intelligence - and Russell, a chaotic force who needs to be free, dragging each other to breakdown in Vienna, while in the film's present Keitel leads Garfunkel toward the memory of what he really did in the hours before the drugged Russell reached hospital: he raped her unconscious body. Scenes of Russell during orgasm and tracheotomy are spliced with surgical flicks of Roeg's editing knife. Keitel probes into Garfunkel's head; Garfunkel and Russell mangle each other's.\n\n\"Did you pirate it?\" Roeg asks when we meet to discuss it. \"I like pirate copies. There are some around.\" Bad Timing began with a favourite Italian paperback of the producer Carlo Ponti, a story of sexual obsession that neither Roeg nor his screenwriter, Yale Udoff, read. Its premise proved a gift. \"It was all about frailties,\" Roeg says. \"It was about the fact that you cannot intellectualise your genes, which make aspects of your life inevitable. You cannot intellectualise yourself out of obsession. You cannot cure yourself of it.\"\n\nVienna in 1979 impregnated their work. \"It was an unstable city, a border city, only just handed back from the Russians. To be in a place with so many strange rules and so many dangers, so many police and spies - all that was in the film.\"\n\nNext, Roeg mixed the acting elements that would combust in this border zone. Keitel, as the detective who investigates the truth so hard that at one point he seems to hallucinate the facts, and Elliott, beginning a decade of despairingly noble roles as Russell's wry cuckold, were perfect. But it was Garfunkel, with only Mike Nichols's Carnal Knowledge to recommend him, and Russell, a 21-year-old ingenue, who were plunged into Bad Timing's heart. Garfunkel was chosen because Roeg heard he'd once been a mathematician as well as a singer: \"a man of the world, of ideas and connections\". Russell, too, \"wasn't caught up in theatricality, being a star\".\n\nFour days into the shoot his two tyro stars begged Roeg to let them leave, and he knew he was on the right track. \"Theresa came first. She said, 'I don't think I'm up to this. I'm terribly nervous. Please let me leave.' I said, 'No. I won't let you. I'm glad you feel that way.' Then I asked Art in. I told them, 'This isn't like another movie. We're shooting fragments of scenes; there's nothing to rehearse. We're in a city none of us knows, an empty landscape. I must ask you to trust that I know where I'm going. It's a maze, but there is an end to it.' We had some Martinis, and they agreed. Somehow, it was a release. I felt all right about pushing them further and further.\"\n\nOne of the many emotional scatterbombs stumbled over was that Roeg and Russell fell in love (they later married). I wonder if the fearless chaos of her performance is what he fell for. \"When you admire someone's work, you are amazed by who you think they are,\" he says. \"But their real secret is masonic: they keep it right to the end. Very few people are prepared to let you all the way in - to Kafka's 'point of no return'. We went very far. As it turned out, not all the way. Theresa knew it was too dangerous. That's all in the movie.\"\n\nIt was worse for Garfunkel. Like his repressed character, he had little idea what was in store. \"As we worked, I think he recognised a truth in his character's obsession in himself,\" says Roeg. \"Then he had to decide whether to play it so people he knew would recognise it. It was like coming out. The actors were all nervous and guilty.\"\n\nThe actors' immersion into their parts became painful. At the film's half-way point, when Russell vengefully demands sex with Garfunkel on the stairs, and he looks up at what's on offer like a naughty schoolboy, fearfully grabbing her, her skin mottling and flushing, the old claims that there was real penetration on the set of Performance seem small beer: here, psyches are stripped. And soon the fever spread through the crew.\n\n\"Everybody was peeling themselves open,\" Roeg remembers. \"It was a wild time, there was a great feeling of release - sexually, emotionally. It was exhilarating. I remember one day we shot for 24 hours. I think I was the one who said, 'I can't take it any more. I've had enough.' We were shooting six or seven days a week. It was claustrophobic - play the part, go to sleep, go back. I abandoned control, and something magical came in. Bad Timing began to live itself. I kept out of the way of its forcefield. It was a bit of suspended time. A parallel universe.\"\n\nEveryone caught their breath when Garfunkel and Russell's characters took a break in Morocco. Shooting on the edge of the Sahara, they felt free, adventurous. But it was the calm before the storm - the long day, back in Vienna, spent filming the rape. It looks deeply uncomfortable - Russell's head hanging back from her bed, while Garfunkel tears her clothes with a penknife, and enters her over and over. Shooting it was \"shocking\", Roeg remembers. 'The actors were frightened when they realised the disgust you feel when you can't control yourself. It's an extraordinary, horrible crime, rape. And you don't often see the rape of the unconscious. Usually it's someone dragged screaming into the bushes. There's a lot of acting going on. There wasn't a lot of acting in that scene.\"\n\nAfter a break, some of the crew reassembled for a final scene in New York. But Garfunkel's performance was distant. They'd left their parallel universe and couldn't go back. Roeg scrapped the scene. But he began post-production thrilled at the work they'd done, sure audiences would recognise the characters' emotions.\n\nBut, Roeg recalls, \"it was received for the most part very poorly.\" At the first test screening in America, I was going to meet a friend, a quite well-known actor. Afterwards, he got into his car, drove it at me, and swerved off. He wouldn't speak to me for three years. I didn't realise till then how seriously people resent you holding a mirror to their face.\"\n\nKeitel and Garfunkel became firm friends from the experience. Roeg and Russell returned to Bad Timing's themes in other undervalued work such as Cold Heaven (1993), in which Russell's half-dead, cuckolded husband recovers from the surgeon's scalpel to test their love.\n\nThe dashed dreams they all had for Bad Timing 20 years ago still bond them. \"When Rank called it 'sick', it hurt,\" Roeg says. \"I was surprised and upset for the actors. No matter how much I said they were terrific, they didn't get the recognition they patently deserved. It doesn't help much, years later, when people say, 'Oh, that movie...\"'"
