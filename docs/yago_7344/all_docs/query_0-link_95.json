        "text": "Freely adapted from Dennis Potter’s 1974 BBC TV play Schmoedipus, this weird psycho-drama sees director Nicolas Roeg toying with his audience as he describes the hallucinations of a mind going off the rails.\n\nTheresa Russell (making her fourth of six films with her director husband) is Linda, the unhappy wife to Dr Henry Henry (Christopher Lloyd) who is more interested in his model trains than her. As Linda contemplates suicide, demons torment her, chiefly the vision of a strange English hitch-hiker Martin (Gary Oldman) who says he’s her long-lost son…\n\nOldman (doing a satanic variation on Norman Wisdom) is the dynamo that galvanises this bizarre black comedy into life. Overloaded with arthouse conceits bordering on the pretentious, this is Roeg at his most Roegish, and probably the weirdest ever film to be produced by George Harrison’s Hand Made Films. Look out for some suitably surreal supporting turns from Sandra Bernhard and Colleen Camp.\n\nThe Indicator limited edition world premiere Blu-ray release includes the following features…\n\n• High Definition remaster\n\n• Original stereo audio\n\n• The NFT Interview with Nicolas Roeg (1994, 68min): archival audio recording\n\n• Audio commentary with filmmaker and historian Jim Hemphill\n\n• Postcards from Cape Fear (2019, 18min): actor Colleen Camp on working with Nicolas Roeg\n\n• On the Right Track (2019, 10min): interview with editor Tony Lawson\n\n• An Air of Mystery (2019, 6min): interview with costume designer Shuna Harwood\n\n• Buzz and Gossip (2019, 15min): interview with sound mixer David Stephenson\n\n• Isolated music & effects track\n\n• Original theatrical trailer\n\n• Image gallery\n\n• New and improved English subtitles\n\n• Exclusive booklet with a new essays, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits\n\nA possessive man . . . An independent lady . . . and a love that turns to tragedy\n\nParting amicably from her Czech army pilot husband (Denholm Elliott), troubled Milena (Theresa Russell) starts an on-off affair in post-Cold War Vienna with American psychoanalyst-in-residence, Dr Alex Linden (Art Garkunkel).\n\nAt first, Alex accepts Milena seeing other men, but gradually he becomes tormented by jealousy, while Milena resents that his interest in her is purely sexual. When Milena has an apparent drug overdose, a police inspector (Harvey Keitel) questions Dr Linden in a bid to start piecing together the sordid details of their all-consuming passion.\n\nA Terrifying Love Story\n\nNicolas Roeg‘s beautifully-executed, yet deeply disturbing 1980 film set in the city of Klimt and Schiele is a strange brew indeed – an arty, unflinching depiction of a destructive relationship, in which both Art Garfunkel and Theresa Russell bring incredibly intensity to their roles as the bird-like Dr Alex Linden (who masks a fearsome control freak under his massive ginger afro) and the volatile Milena (who just wants to be loved, but ultimately is never satisfied).\n\nMuch maligned, Bad Timing remains one of Roeg’s most divisive films (he also described it as an apt summation of his career, believing himself to have often been ahead of time, instead of simply being of it). But it’s certainly worth checking out again. Bleak, brutal and beautiful – at times you think Roeg is breathing masterful life into one of Egon Schiele’s erotic, macabre masterpieces that hang in Vienna’s famed Leopold Museum (which also features in the film).\n\nTHE UK BLU-RAY RELEASE\n\nReleased on Blu-ray as part of Network’s The British Film collection, Bad Timing is presented in a new High Definition transfer from original film elements in its as-exhibited theatrical aspect ratio. The special features include an interview with producer Jeremy Thomas, theatrical and teaser trailers, deleted scenes, gallery and promotional material in pdf format."
