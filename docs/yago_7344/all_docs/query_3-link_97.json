        "text": "Hollywood director Nicolas Roeg has died aged 90.\n\nThe London-born star - who directed hit movies including Performance, Walkabout, Castaway, Don't Look Now, Bad Timing and The Witches - passed away on Friday night, his family has confirmed.\n\nHis son Nicolas Roeg Junior paid tribute to his, \"genuine dad,\" explaining how, \"he just had his 90th birthday in August.\"\n\nTributes poured in for the Man Who Fell to Earth director, with one fan tweeting, 'I am heartbroken to read that the great Nicolas Roeg passed away last night.\n\n\"So many great films in his lineup that I find absolutely fascinating. You're one of a kind, sir. May you rest easy.\"\n\n\"Hearing reports that Nicolas Roeg has passed away. Very sad, if true,\" echoed another, hailing him a \"true cinematic master.\"\n\nRoeg made his directorial debut 23 years after starting work in the film industry and was famed for his disjointed and disorientating editing which gave his work an eerie, surreal feel.\n\n\"Life isn't linear, it's sideways,\" he once explained of his technique in a 2011 interview with the Guardian.\n\nBorn in London in 1928, he completed National Service before starting work as a tea boy at Marylebone Studios in the UK capial, and working his way up to clapper-loader followed by camera operator on films such as Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and The Trials of Oscar Wilde.\n\nIt wasn't until the late 1960s that his talent as a director became clear, with his 1971 movie Performance going on to become one of the cult movies of the decade.\n\nWhile reception was lukewarm at first, the film went on to become a pop culture hit with Mick Jagger playing a reclusive rock star who allows a wannabe London gangster to move in with him to escape his criminal bosses.\n\nNext came Walkabout (1971), which told the tale of an English teenage girl and her brother who are forced to fight for survival after being abandoned in the Australian Outback by their dad. His own son Luc played the little boy in the flick, which was immediately praised by critics but performed poorly at the box office.\n\nHorror film Don't Look Now - starring Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland - followed in 1973, and came under fire because of a particularly graphic sex scene.\n\nRumours abounded at the time that the actors weren't just acting, and Roeg eventually interspersed the scene with shots of them dressing to calm the censors.\n\nIn 1976 he made The Man Who Fell to Earth with man-of-the-moment, David Bowie.\n\nThe sci-fi saw Bowie play a humanoid alien who travels to Earth to collect water for his drought-hit planet and is one of Roeg's most recognised pieces of work.\n\nIt was on that movie that he met actress Theresa Russell, who would become his second wife in 1982 following the end of his 20-year marriage to Susan Stephen.\n\nHe had children Waldo, Nico, Solto and producer Luc Roeg with his first wife, and Max and Statten with Theresa before marrying third wife Harriet Harper in 2005.\n\nA year after his second marriage, he was hand-picked by Jim Henson to direct an adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel, The Witches, starring Angelica Houston.\n\nIt was to be his last major studio film, and despite being a box-office failure continues to be a much-loved children's classic."
