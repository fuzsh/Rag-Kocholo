She first started her career modeling at the age of 12, when a photographer discovered her. She married Nicolas Roeg in 1982 and has two children, Max Roeg and Staten Roeg. Pete Townshend of The Who admits that Russell was the inspiration of their song, Athena which was first called Theresa. Russell will next appear in Spiderman 3 as the wife of Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church). She now resides in Beverly Hills, California."
