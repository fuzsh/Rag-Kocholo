        "text": "Cinematographer Anthony Richmond worked alongside director Nicolas Roeg on Don’t Look Now (1973) and The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976).\n\nDon’t Look Now is an adaptation of the short story by Daphne du Maurier, and stars Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland as a married couple who travel to Venice only to haunted by the death of their recent daughter.\n\nIt recently topped Time Out’s list of the 100 best British films and remains a remarkably atmospheric drama with its brilliant editing, haunting visuals and great use of the wintry Italian locations.\n\nThe Man Who Fell To Earth is a cult adaptation of the Walter Tevis novel about a mysterious man (David Bowie) who seemingly arrives from another planet and builds a vast business empire before becoming a recluse.\n\nAn unusual and rewarding film, it has aged like a fine wine with an inventive approach to time and enduring exploration of the forces that shape modern society.\n\nBoth films are getting re-releases on Blu-ray and I recently spoke to Anthony about his work on what are now seminal films of the 1970s.\n\nYou can listen to the interview by clicking here:\n\n[audio:http://filmdetail.receptionmedia.com/Anthony_Richmond_on_Nicolas_Roeg.mp3]\n\nYou can also download this interview as a podcast via iTunes by clicking here.\n\nOptimum Home Entertainment release The Man Who Fell To Earth today on Blu-ray and Don’t Look Now is out on June 27th"
