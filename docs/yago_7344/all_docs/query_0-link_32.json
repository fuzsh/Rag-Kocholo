        "text": "Page Module:Infobox/styles.css has no content.\n\nTheresa Lynn Russell (born March 20, 1957) is an American actress. Russell made her film debut in The Last Tycoon (1976) directed by Elia Kazan, followed by a lead role opposite Dustin Hoffman in Straight Time (1978). She was then cast in Nicolas Roeg's controversial thriller Bad Timing (1980), which earned her critical praise. After marrying Roeg in 1982, she appeared in multiple films directed by him, mainly arthouse and experimental films, including Eureka (1983), Insignificance (1985), and Cold Heaven (1991).\n\nFollowing lead roles in the controversial film Whore, Russell starred in Steven Soderbergh's Kafka, both films having been released in 1991. Russell was cast in the box-office hit thriller Wild Things (1998), starred in the critically acclaimed drama The Believer (2001) and in the later 2000s, she appeared in HBO miniseries Empire Falls (2005), and had a minor role in Spider-Man 3 (2007).\n\nEarly life[]\n\nRussell was born Theresa Lynn Paup in San Diego,[1] the daughter of Carole Platt (née Mall) and Jerry Russell Paup.[2] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she relocated with her mother and stepfather to Burbank, where she was raised.[3] Russell is the oldest of five siblings.[3] According to Russell, she grew up in poverty, and her family was on food stamps to help support herself and her siblings.[3] She attended Burbank High School, but did not graduate.[4] At sixteen, she dropped out of high school and moved in with a 28-year-old boyfriend who was a primal scream therapist.[5] At age seventeen, Russell enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Institute in West Hollywood to study acting.[6]\n\nCareer[]\n\n1976–2001: Early work; critical acclaim[]\n\nRussell had begun modeling at the age of 12, and became acquainted with photographer Peter Douglas (son of Kirk Douglas) as a teenager.[3] Through Douglas, she was introduced to film producer Sam Spiegel, who suggested her for the part of Cecilia Brady in Elia Kazan's The Last Tycoon (1976), starring Robert De Niro. After meeting with Kazan, Russell was cast in the part, playing the daughter of Robert Mitchum.[3] Russell's next notable appearance was in the crime drama Straight Time (1978), opposite Dustin Hoffman and Kathy Bates in an early role.\n\nIn 1979, she was cast as Milena Flaherty in the thriller Bad Timing (1980), the first of six films starring Russell directed by Nicolas Roeg, whom she married in 1982. Though Bad Timing was controversial upon release, Russell's performance was praised by critic Roger Ebert, who wrote: \"If there is any reason to see this film, however, it is the performance by Theresa Russell (who was Dustin Hoffman's lover in Straight Time). She is only 22 or 23, and yet her performance is astonishingly powerful. She will be in better films, I hope, and is the only participant who need not be ashamed of this one.\"[8]\n\nOther Roeg/Russell collaborations include Insignificance, Eureka, Track 29, Cold Heaven, and Aria. In 1987, she played a psychotic killer on the loose in Seattle in the film noir thriller Black Widow, which earned her critical acclaim; Vincent Canby of The New York Times said Russell's \"clear-eyed sweetness...adds unexpected dimension to the homicidal Catharine.\"[9] She has also been widely praised for her roles in The Razor's Edge (1984) and Impulse (1990). Russell and Roeg's film collaborations were overall box office failures and critically divisive.[3][10]\n\nShe was then cast in Ken Russell's Whore (1991), based on the play by David Hines, playing a Los Angeles prostitute.[11] Though the film received mixed reception from critics, Russell's performance was praised by The New York Times[12] and Roger Ebert.[13] The same year, she was cast in a lead role opposite Jeremy Irons in Steven Soderbergh's Kafka (1991), a black-and-white surrealist adaptation of Franz Kafka stories.[14]\n\nIn 1994, she appeared as the narrator of the British drama Being Human, starring Robin Williams,[15] followed by the British comedy The Grotesque (1995), opposite Alan Bates and Sting. Russell was then cast in the 1998 cult thriller Wild Things, playing the mother of Denise Richards,[11] which was a major box office success.[16] After appearing in the crime drama Luckytown (2000) opposite James Caan and Kirsten Dunst, Russell was then cast in The Believer (2001), a drama written and directed by Henry Bean, and starring Ryan Gosling as a Jewish man who becomes a KKK member. The film was critically acclaimed and received the Special Jury Prize—Drama at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival.[17]\n\n2002–present: Indie and mainstream films[]\n\nIn the early 2000s, Russell mainly appeared in low-budget and independent films, such as The House Next Door (2002), Now & Forever (2002), and The Box (2003). In 2005, she was cast in the role of Charlene in the HBO mini-series Empire Falls, opposite Ed Harris. She also appeared in the supporting role of Emma Marko in Spider-Man 3 as the wife of Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church).[18] Spider-Man 3 was a major box office success, grossing nearly $900 million worldwide.[19] The following year, she appeared in the independent drama Jolene, starring Jessica Chastain, and also had a minor role playing the mother of Scarlett Johansson's character in the romantic comedy He's Just Not That into You (2009), though her scenes were eventually cut from the film.[20]\n\nIn 2012, she appeared in the Lifetime television film Liz & Dick, playing Sara Taylor, the mother of Elizabeth Taylor (portrayed by Lindsay Lohan).\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nShe married English film director Nicolas Roeg in February 1982 in Westminster, London.[21] The couple had two sons, Statten (born 1983) and Maximillian (born 1985); Roeg and Russell divorced at an unspecified date.[22] Pete Townshend of The Who says that Russell was the inspiration for his song, \"Athena\", which was first called \"Theresa\".\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1976 The Last Tycoon Cecilia Brady 1978 Straight Time Jenny Mercer 1980 Bad Timing Milena Flaherty 1983 Eureka Tracy McCann Maillot Van Horn 1984 The Razor's Edge Sophie MacDonald 1985 Insignificance Actress 1987 Black Widow Catharine Petersen 1987 Aria King Zog 1988 Track 29 Linda Henry 1989 Physical Evidence Jenny Hudson 1990 Impulse Lottie Mason 1991 Whore Liz 1991 Cold Heaven Marie Davenport 1991 Kafka Gabriela 1994 Being Human The Storyteller 1995 Hotel Paradise Short film 1995 The Grotesque Lady Harriet Coal 1996 The Flight of the Dove Mary Ann Curran 1996 Public Enemies Kate \"Ma\" Barker 1996 A Young Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court Morgan le Fay 1996 Catherine Morgan 1998 Running Woman Emily Russo 1998 Wild Things Sandra Van Ryan 2000 Luckytown Stella 2001 The Believer Lina Moebius 2002 The House Next Door Helen Schmidt 2002 Passionada Lois Vargas 2002 Now & Forever Dori Wilson 2003 Water Under the Bridge Jackie O'Connor 2003 The Box Dora Baker 2003 Love Comes Softly Sarah Graham 2007 Spider-Man 3 Emma Marko 2007 On the Doll Diane 2008 Dark World Nicole 2008 Chinaman's Chance: America's Other Slaves Mrs. Williams 2008 Jolene Aunt Kay 2009 He's Just Not That into You Mrs. Marks Scenes deleted 2009 16 to Life Louise 2011 1 Out of 7 Lexi's Mom 2011 Rid of Me Mrs. Lockwood 2011 Born to Ride Frances Callahan 2012 The Legends of Nethiah Nethiah's Mother 2013 A Winter Rose Rachal Love 2013 Moving Mountains Trish Bragg\n\nTelevision[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1979 Blind Ambition Maureen Dean TV miniseries 1993 A Woman's Guide to Adultery Rose Episodes: \"1.1\", \"1.2\", \"1.3\" 1994 Thicker Than Water Debbie / Jo TV film 1995 Trade-Off Jackie Daniels TV film 1996 Once You Meet a Stranger Margo Anthony TV film 1999 G vs E Reesa Tussel Episode: \"To Be or Not to Be Evil\" 2000 Nash Bridges Ellen Holiday / Sarah Williams Episodes: \"Jackpot: Parts 1 & 2\" 2001 Earth vs. the Spider Trixie Grillo TV film 2002 Glory Days Hazel Walker Main role (9 episodes) 2002 Project Viper Dr. Nancy Burnham TV film 2003 Chasing Alice TV film 2003 Love Comes Softly Sarah Graham TV film 2005 Blind Injustice Joanna Bartlett TV film 2005 Empire Falls Charlene TV miniseries 2006 Law & Order: Criminal Intent Regina Reid Episode: \"On Fire\" 2007 American Heiress Jordan Wakefield Episodes: \"Lion King\", \"Crash and Burn\", \"Lions and Tigers and Bears...\" 2009 Fringe Rebecca Kibner Episode: \"Momentum Deferred\" 2010 Cold Case Rachel Malone Episode: \"One Fall\" 2012 Liz & Dick Sara Taylor TV film 2013–15 Delete Fiona 2 episodes\n\nReferences[]\n\nBibliography[]\n\nKazan, Elia (2010).
