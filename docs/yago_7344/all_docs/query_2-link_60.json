        "text": "Derek Russell is following the family tradition of Imperial business ownership with the opening of AgPro Realty.\n\nWith 14 years of real estate experience under his belt, Russell said he’s always been interested in real estate.\n\nLikewise, owning his own business has also been a dream of his.\n\nBusiness ownership comes naturally for the Russell family. His parents Danny and Theresa Russell own Imperial Country Ford, and sister Tiffany Reeves owns and operates 509 Broadway.\n\n“It runs in the family,” he said. “It’s just a natural thing and something I’ve always wanted to do.”\n\nAgPro Realty is located at 135 West 5th Street in the building Russell and wife Amber purchased 4-5 years ago. The building earlier housed the Upper Republican NRD and, later, the Chase Co. Extension Service.\n\nIt contains two offices, the entry/reception area, a large conference room at the back and restrooms. He said they’ve repainted the interior, added new lighting, new carpet and trim.\n\nRussell is the broker/owner at AgPro Realty and he is licenced to sell real estate in Nebraska and Colorado. He said he’d like to concentrate his sales in southwest Nebraska and northeast Colorado.\n\nHe’s sold ag, residential and commercial properties in the past, so plans to focus on them.\n\n“In rural areas like here, we have the opportunity to sell all types of real estate,” he said.\n\nBorn and raised in Imperial, Russell graduated from Chase County Schools in 2002. He went on to the University of Nebraska-Omaha but also took classes at Grace University in Omaha.\n\nHe graduated from UNO in 2006 with a B.S. degree in business management.\n\nHe remained in Omaha and worked two years for Union Pacific Railroad in logistics. While there, he and Amber were married and had their first child.\n\n“We decided then we didn’t want to raise our family in the city,” he said.\n\nThat led them to a move back to Imperial in 2008.\n\nHe worked for FV Coop the first two years after the family’s move back, then was employed at Country Ford for about four years. He then worked at Colson Agency for approximately 10 years.\n\nAs a business owner now, Russell said he’s anxious to support the community and area, as well.\n\nAmber will be helping out some at the business with bookkeeping.\n\nThe couple has three children, Destry, a CCS freshman; Adi, in eighth grade; and Millie, a fifth grader.\n\nAgPro Realty’s website was launched this week. People can find out more about the business and their listings at www.agpro realestate.com."
