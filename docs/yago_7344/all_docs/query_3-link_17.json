        "text": "Nicky Samuel meets Nic Roeg, November 1972\n\nBy this time Donald Cammell had introduced me to the film director Nic Roeg, who began occasionally turning up to Mallord Street, sometimes alone and sometimes with his wife. A small unpretentious man who was usually dressed in sweaters and corduroy trousers, he was not outstandingly good-looking but he reminded me slightly of my godfather Jean Francois Bergery. He was also a great deal older than me, and for a while I leaned on him a little because I could talk to him about Donald.\n\n“You’re a fool to go on thinking of him”, Nic said to me one day. “He’s not the kind of person for you.” I felt the tears come into my eyes and he put an arm round my shoulder and handed me a handkerchief. “I know that you love him. But he’s never going to change and so you’ll never be happy with him. Believe me!”\n\nAbout a week later, he and Donald turned up together, and then at some point in the evening Nic came up to me and gave me such an appraising glance that my heart missed a beat. I hoped for a moment that he was going to make a pass at me, but instead he said: “That hair – it’s perfect. You see, I must have a red-head!”\n\n“What on earth do you mean?”\n\n“I’m shooting a cinema advertisement for Cherry-B. I wonder whether you’d consider taking part? It’ll be a day’s work, and you might find it amusing.”"
