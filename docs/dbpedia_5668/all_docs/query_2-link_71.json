He explains briefly the factions history, political and geographical situation as well as some advantages of your nation. However, i cannot for the life of me find who voice acted this guy. He sounds pretty old in the animations and the game was made more than 20 years ago so i suspect he's probably dead now but i'd love to see if anyone knows if he's been in anything else as i would love, if there are any, to see him in any other piece of media."
