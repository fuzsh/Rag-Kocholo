        "text": "Jamie Foreman (born 25 May 1958) is an English actor best known for his roles as Duke in Layer Cake (2004) and Bill Sikes in Roman Polanski's Oliver Twist (2005). He played opposite Ray Winstone and Kathy Burke in Gary Oldman's Nil by Mouth (1997) and also featured in Elizabeth (1998), Gangster No. 1 (2000) and Sleepy Hollow (1999). He appeared in the 2006 Doctor Who episode \"The Idiot's Lantern\" and featured as a racist taxi driver in The Football Factory (2004). In the 2008 film Inkheart Foreman played Basta. He also appeared in one episode of Law and Order: UK in 2009. His recent work for BBC Radio includes the title role in Wes Bell, directed by Matthew Broughton, and the six-part series Hazelbeach by David Stafford and Caroline Stafford. He also played a small role in I'll Sleep When I'm Dead. In 2011, Foreman joined the cast of EastEnders as Derek Branning, taking over the role from Terence Beesley. It was later confirmed in 2012 that Foreman was leaving and that the character Derek would be killed off. He has appeared as Lenny in numerous episodes of Birds of a Feather. In 2015, he narrated the six-part series Double Decker Driving School for ITV. Foreman played Albert Wilson in Home Front radio series on BBC Radio 4, starting from Season Six in December 2015.\n\nMichael Ciaran Parker (born 4 May 1952), better known by his stage name Michael Barrymore, is an English comedian and television presenter of game shows and light entertainment programmes on British television in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. These included Strike It Lucky, My Kind of People, My Kind of Music and Kids Say the Funniest Things. In 1993 he headlined the Royal Variety Performance. At his peak Barrymore was voted the UK's favourite television star several times, and became one of the highest-paid stars on television. He presented the popular game-show Strike It Lucky as well as his own variety show Barrymore. He starred in Bob Martin from 2000 to 2001, a comedy drama in which he played the title role of a failing television game-show host. Since his peak of popularity in the mid-1990s, Barrymore has appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and other shows including The Friday Night Project, Graham Norton's Bigger Picture, This Morning, The Sharon Osbourne Show and The Saturday Night Show. His television career effectively ended after the death of Stuart Lubbock in 2001 following a party at Barrymore's house. Barrymore was the subject of police investigations and legal action around the case over several years.\n\nJade Cerisa Lorraine Goody (5 June 1981 â€“ 22 March 2009) was an English reality-television personality. She entered the public spotlight in the third series of the then-Channel 4 programme Big Brother in 2002, an appearance which led to her own television programmes and the introduction of her products after her eviction from the show.Immediately criticised by the British press for her perceived lack of decorum and intelligence, Goody was dubbed by multiple outlets as \"the most hated woman in Britain\". The country's celebrity magazines were less derisive, publishing reports of her affable nature and competent school performance from those who knew her. Public opinion of Goody reached its most negative in January 2007, however, when she was the perpetrator of racial bullying towards Indian actress Shilpa Shetty while appearing as a housemate on Celebrity Big Brother 5. Following her eviction, Goody made a number of apologies, but continued to garner negative public reactions.In August 2008, Goody appeared on the Indian version of Big Brother, Bigg Boss, but left the show early and returned to the UK after learning that she had cervical cancer. By February 2009, the cancer had metastasized, and Goody was terminally ill. She married fellow Celebrity Big Brother contestant Jack Tweed on 22 February 2009, and died one month later, in the early hours of 22 March 2009, at the age of 27.Public opinion of Goody had softened by the time of her death. Sky Living broadcast five tribute shows from 2009 to 2012, documenting her life from early childhood through her rise to fame and her final months. The last episode of Big Brother on Channel 4 featured a 15-minute tribute to Goody, praising her as the ultimate Big Brother contestant. She was one of several people to appear on the front cover of the final edition of News of the World on 10 July 2011."
