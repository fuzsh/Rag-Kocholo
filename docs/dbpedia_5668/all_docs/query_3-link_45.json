        "text": "Reduction of air pollutant concentrations in an indoor ice-skating rink\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLee, K.; Yanagisawa, Yukio; Spengler, J.D.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nHigh carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide concentrations were measured in an indoor ice-skating rink with fuel-powered ice-resurfacing equipment. In 22% to 33% of the measurements over 90-min segments, CO concentrations exceeded 20 [mu]L/L as a 90-min average in the absence of rink ventilation. Average NO[sub 2] concentrations over 14 h were higher than 600 nL/L. Reduction of air pollutant concentrations in the ice-skating rink is necessary to prevent air-pollutant-exposure-related health incidents. Various methods for reducing air pollutants in an ice-skating rink were evaluated by simultaneously measuring CO and NO[sub 2] concentrations. Single pollution reduction attempts, such as extension of themoreÂ Â» exhaust pipe, reduction in the number of resurfacer operations, or use of an air recirculation system, did not significantly reduce air pollutant concentrations in the rink. Full operation of the mechanical ventilation system combined with reduced resurfacer operation was required to keep the air pollutant levels in the skating rink below the recommended guidelines. This investigation showed that management of clean air quality in an ice-skating rink is practically difficult as long as fuel-powered resurfacing equipment is used. 16 refs., 3 figs., 5 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nSkating on thin ice: a study of the injuries sustained at a temporary ice skating rink.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarr, Lynne V; Imam, Samirul; Crawford, John R; Owen, P Julian\n\n2010-06-01\n\nIn recent years, ice skating and temporary ice skating rinks have become increasingly popular. Regular elite competitors are known to be at risk of both acute and chronic injuries. It may be postulated that skaters at the temporary rinks are at high risk of acute injuries from falls due to both their lack of expertise and the inherent dangers of ice skating. Injuries sustained at skating rinks present a significant burden to local healthcare resources, in particular orthopaedic departments. For the first time, Cambridge hosted such a facility from November 24, 2007 through January 6, 2008. We sought to identify the most common injuries encountered and to quantify the orthopaedic burden. All Emergency Department or Fracture Clinic attendances for an eight-week period from the opening of the rink were investigated. Details of age, sex, injury and management were recorded for the 84 patients who sustained ice rink related injuries. A total of 85 injuries were recorded in 84 patients. Of these injuries 58% were fractures, of which 98% involved the upper limbs. Seven patients (8% of all injuries) required admission for operative fixation. On average, two injuries per day were seen in the Emergency Department or Fracture Clinic, with an average of one orthopaedic admission per week. It is evident that the ice rink in Cambridge has had an impact on local healthcare resources. The vast majority of injuries affected the upper limbs and were sustained following a fall on the out-stretched hand. We therefore encourage the education of skaters as to how to break their falls more safely and recommend the use of wrist protectors as a primary preventative measure.\n\nSkating on thin ice: a study of the injuries sustained at a temporary ice skating rink\n\nPubMed Central\n\nImam, Samirul; Crawford, John R.; Owen, P.

The common operation of fuel-powered resurfacing equipment in enclosed ice skating rinks has the potential for producing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. Exposures to these gaseous combustion products may adversely affect the health of those inside the rink. Little information is available on pollutant concentrations under normal operating conditions. METHODS. One-week average nitrogen dioxide concentrations in 70 northeastern US rinks were measured with passive samplers during normal winter season conditions. RESULTS. The median nitrogen dioxide level inside rinks was 180 ppb, more than 10 times higher than the median outdoor concentration. One-week average nitrogen dioxide concentrations above 1000 ppb were measured in 10% of the rinks. CONCLUSIONS. Considering that short-term peak concentrations were likely to have reached two to five times the measured 1-week averages, our results suggest that nitrogen dioxide levels were well above short-term air quality guidelines and constitute a public health concern of considerable magnitude. PMID:8129060\n\nCarbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide levels in an indoor ice skating rink with mitigation methods\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLee, K.; Yanagisawa, Y.; Spengler, J.D.\n\n1993-05-01\n\nAn indoor ice skating rink is an enclosed space with intermittent air pollutant emissions from fuel-powered ice-resurfacing equipment, such as a resurfacer and an edger. Exhaust gases discharged from the resurfacing equipment actually include significant quantities of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO[sub 2]) which may induced adverse health effects. Carbon monoxide exposures in ice skating rinks resulting from malfunctioning ice resurfacing equipment were first reported more than twenty years ago. Attempts to reduce emissions of CO and NO[sub 2] form resurfacing equipment, such as the extended exhaust pipe, operation of the air recirculation system or reduced resurfacer operation,moreÂ Â» appeared not to be effective for maintaining the air pollutant concentrations below guidelines. Even though improved indoor air quality was obtained by the combination of the full operation of the air exhaust system and the reduced number of resurfacer operations in this investigation, these methods may be impractical for most skating rinks. Replacement of the fuel-powered resurfacer with a battery operated resurfacer is recommended. If replacement is not feasible, then increasing the air ventilation rate is recommended as a second choice. 10 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nThe impact of orthopaedic injuries sustained at an urban public ice skating rink: is it really free?\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwarzkopf, Ran; Nacke, Elliot A; Tejwani, Nirmal C\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPrevious reports in the literature from Europe and Asia cite an increased burden on the local emergency departments and orthopaedic services during the operational period of the ice skating rinks. This retrospective observational study was undertaken in order to report the incidence, characteristic, and severity of injuries during a full season at a large urban ice skating rink, as well as to quantify the added burden the ice skating rink places on the local emergency department and the orthopaedic service. All patients seen at our emergency room who sustained an injury at the neighboring \"free\" ice rink were identified over the 4-month period when it was open. The data collected included type of injury, demographics, and need for surgical treatment. Over this period, 118 patients were seen in our ED (of the 135 referrals from the ice rink logbook); Of these, 43 (38%) required an orthopaedic consult and were evenly divided into upper (22) and lower extremity injuries (21). Sixty-seven percent of the patients were adults, and the most common fractures were ankle and distal radius fractures. There were two open fractures of the distal radius seen in the older patients (both in patients > 50). Overall 32% of patients needed operative treatment. Of the non-orthopaedic injuries, the most common was head injury (25%). An ice-rink may be \"free\" but adds significant burden to the healthcare system, and these costs should be factored in by both the sponsoring body and the healthcare system for treatment of these additional patients.\n\nEnergy conservation in ice skating rinks\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDietrich, B.K.; McAvoy, T.J.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nAn economic and energy analysis of ice rinks was made to examine the areas in which energy could be profitably conserved. The areas where new equipment could make a major reduction in energy use are: the use of waste heat for space heating, the installation of a low emissivity false ceiling to reduce radiant heat, the use of a load cycling controller to reduce refrigeration costs, and the installation of more efficient lighting systems. Changes in rink operating procedure that could cut energy use are: higher refrigerant temperatures, thinner ice, the use of colder resurfacing water, turning the compressors andmoreÂ Â» pumps off at night, and reducing ventilation.Â«Â less\n\nCost of a roller skating rink to the local accident and emergency department.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNayeem, N; Shires, S E; Porter, J E\n\n1990-01-01\n\nA 14 month retrospective study was undertaken to determine the cost implications of the opening of a roller skating rink to the local hospital accident and emergency department (A and E). A total of 398 patients attended following injury at the roller skating rink, of whom 384 were included in the study. The estimated cost of their injuries was determined by the hospital accounts department. The average cost per patient attending the A and E department following roller skating injury was about 100 pounds. The total cost to the A and E department of all injuries sustained at the rink over this period was 38,412 pounds. The cost implications of opening a roller skating rink for the A and E department are considerable. If proposals for self-budgeting are applied, A and E departments will have to seek additional funding if such leisure facilities are opened in their vicinity.

One hundred and eight had a significant injury. Thirty-seven patients were admitted. Thirty-three required an operation under general anaesthesia. Thirty had consumed alcohol at the rink's bar. Nine of these had a fracture. The number of skates attending the Accident and Emergency department per 1000 visits to the rink declined over the study period. Injuries could be reduced if protective clothing was worn. Alcohol should not be sold at the rink. First aid although effective could be improved.

Key to enhanced rink portability, fast freezing and maintaining ice consistency is a mat of flexible tubing called ICEMAT, an offshoot of a solar heating system developed by Calmac, Mfg. under contract with Marshall.\n\nThe effect of a complex training program on skating abilities in ice hockey players.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Changyoung; Lee, Sookyung; Yoo, Jaehyun\n\n2014-04-01\n\n[Purpose] Little data exist on systemic training programs to improve skating abilities in ice hockey players.

We also determined exposure by quantifying the average CO level in the rink during the games. Other variables documented included age, pulmonary function, aerobic capacity, and smoking status. Environmental concentrations varied from 1.6 to 131.5 parts per million (ppm). We examined the absorption/exposure relationship using a simple linear regression model. In low CO exposure levels, physical exercise lowered the alveolar CO concentration. However, we noted thatmoreÂ Â» for each 10 ppm of CO in the ambient air, the players had adsorbed enough CO to raise their carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels by 1 percent. This relationship was true both for smokers and non-smokers. We suggest that an average environmental concentration of 20 ppm of CO for the duration of a hockey game (90 minutes) should be reference limit not to be exceeded in indoor skating rinks.Â«Â less\n\nHigh carbon monoxide levels measured in enclosed skating rinks\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSpengler, J.D.; Stone, K.R.; Lilley, F.W.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) levels were measured in enclosed skating rinks in the Boston area. The 1 hr National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 35 ppm was exceeded in 82% of the sampled hours. In a separate study, alveolar breath samples were taken of 12 Harvard hockey players, indicating a fivefold increase in carboxyhemoglobin levels after 93 min of exercise in air with a relatively low 25 ppm CO concentration. This paper demonstrates that exercising athletes are incurring physiologically dangerous levels of carboxyhemoglobin when performing in legal ambient air concentrations of CO-25 ppm, and concentrations of the poisonous gas in manymoreÂ Â» indoor skating rinks regularly exceed the national ambient standards by as much as 300%. It is suggested that the Clean Air Act should be amended to include indoor public exposure to at least the criteria pollutants of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and suspended particulates. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should require revisions in State Implementation Plans to ensure state responsibility for public air pollution exposures indoors. Finally, it is suggested that rink maintenance machinery be redesigned to reduce noxious output by shifting to electrical motors, by upgrading pollution control equipment, or by routine use of ventilation equipment.Â«Â less\n\nNitrogen Dioxide in Indoor Ice Skating Facilities: An International Survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrauer, Michael; Lee, Kiyoung; Spengler, John D; Salonen, Raimo O; Pennanen, Arto; Braathen, Ole Anders; Miskovic, Eva Mihalikova And Peter; Nozaki, Atsuo; Tsuzuki, Toshifumi; Rui-Jin, Song; Qing-Xiang, Yang Xu And Zeng; Drahonovska, Hana; Kjaergaard, SÃ¸ren\n\n1997-10-01\n\nAn international survey of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) levels inside indoor ice skating facilities was conducted. One-week average NO 2 concentrations were measured inside and outside of 332 ice rinks located in nine countries. Each rink manager also completed a questionnaire describing the building, the resurfacing machines, and their use patterns. The (arithmetic) mean NO 2 level for all rinks in the study was 228 ppb, with a range of 1-2,680 ppb, based on a sample collected at breathing height and adjacent to the ice surface. The mean of the second indoor sample (collected at a spectator's area) was 221 ppb, with a range of 1-3,175 ppb. The ratio of the indoor to outdoor NO 2 concentrations was above 1 for 95% of the rinks sampled, indicating the presence of an indoor NO 2 source (mean indoor:outdoor ratio = 20). Estimates of short-term NO 2 concentrations indicated that as many as 40% of the sampled rinks would have exceeded the World Health Organization 1-hour guideline value of 213 ppb NO 2 for indoor air. Statistically significant associations were observed between NO 2 levels and the type of fuel used to power the resurfacer, the absence of a catalytic converter on a resurfacer, and the use of an ice edger. There were also indications that decreased use of mechanical ventilation, increased number of resurfacing operations per day, and smaller rink volumes were associated with increased NO 2 levels. In rinks where the main resurfacer was powered by propane, the NO 2 concentrations were higher than in those with gasoline-powered resurfacers, while the latter had NO 2 concentrations higher than in those using diesel. Rinks where the main resurfacer was electric had the lowest indoor NO 2 concentrations, similar to the levels measured outdoor.\n\nChildren should wear helmets while ice-skating: a comparison of skating-related injuries.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcGeehan, Jennifer; Shields, Brenda J; Smith, Gary A\n\n2004-07-01\n\n.9%, 52 of 56 cases), compared with injuries to skateboarders (3.6%, 1 of 28 cases) (RR: 13.96; 95% CI: 2.01-96.76), rollerskaters (63.4%, 59 of 93 cases) (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.23-1.74), and in-line skaters (10.9%, 15 of 137 cases) (RR: 8.48; 95% CI: 5.23-13.75). The proportion of head injuries among ice-skaters in this study was greater than that observed for participants in other types of skating, for which helmet use is recommended and often required. Children should wear a helmet during recreational ice-skating. Mandatory helmet use by pediatric ice-skaters at indoor rinks should be implemented. Use of other types of protective equipment, such as wrist guards, knee pads, and elbow pads, should be considered for prevention of injuries to the extremities during ice-skating. Caution should be used when allowing young children to participate in recreational ice-skating. Additional research should be conducted in other populations, to corroborate these findings and to evaluate ice-skating safety recommendations for children.\n\nDevelopment of Automated Tracking System with Active Cameras for Figure Skating\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaraguchi, Tomohiko; Taki, Tsuyoshi; Hasegawa, Junichi\n\nThis paper presents a system based on the control of PTZ cameras for automated real-time tracking of individual figure skaters moving on an ice rink. In the video images of figure skating, irregular trajectories, various postures, rapid movements, and various costume colors are included. Therefore, it is difficult to determine some features useful for image tracking. On the other hand, an ice rink has a limited area and uniform high intensity, and skating is always performed on ice. In the proposed system, an ice rink region is first extracted from a video image by the region growing method, and then, a skater region is extracted using the rink shape information. In the camera control process, each camera is automatically panned and/or tilted so that the skater region is as close to the center of the image as possible; further, the camera is zoomed to maintain the skater image at an appropriate scale. The results of experiments performed for 10 training scenes show that the skater extraction rate is approximately 98%. Thus, it was concluded that tracking with camera control was successful for almost all the cases considered in the study.\n\nA Case Study Of Applying Infrared Thermography To Identify A Coolant Leak In A Municipal Ice Skating Rink\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWallace, Jay R.\n\n1989-03-01\n\nThis paper deals with the application of infrared imaging radiometry as a diagnostic inspection tool for locating a concealed leak in the refrigeration system supplying glycol coolant to the arena floor of an ice skating rink in a municipal coliseum facility. Scanning approximately 10 miles of black iron tubing embedded in the arena floor resulted in locating a leak within the supply/return side of the system. A secondary disclosure was a restriction to normal coolant flow in some delivery loops caused by sludge build-up. Specific inspection procedures were established to enhance temperature differentials suitable for good thermal imaging. One procedure utilized the temperature and pressure of the city water supply; a second the availability of 130F hot water from the facility's boiler system; and a third the building's own internal ambient temperature. Destructive testing and other data collection equipment confirmed the thermographic findings revealing a section of corrosion damaged pipe. Repair and flushing of the system was quickly completed with a minimum of construction costs and inconvenience. No financial losses were incurred due to the interruption of scheduled revenue events. Probable cause for the shutdown condition was attributed to a flawed installation decision made 15 years earlier during the initial construction stage.\n\nObserved decreases in the Canadian outdoor skating season due to recent winter warming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDamyanov, Nikolay N.; Damon Matthews, H.; Mysak, Lawrence A.\n\n2012-03-01\n\nGlobal warming has the potential to negatively affect one of Canadaâs primary sources of winter recreation: hockey and ice skating on outdoor rinks. Observed changes in winter temperatures in Canada suggest changes in the meteorological conditions required to support the creation and maintenance of outdoor skating rinks; while there have been observed increases in the ice-free period of several natural water bodies, there has been no study of potential trends in the duration of the season supporting the construction of outdoor skating rinks. Here we show that the outdoor skating season (OSS) in Canada has significantly shortened in many regions of the country as a result of changing climate conditions. We first established a meteorological criterion for the beginning, and a proxy for the length of the OSS. We extracted this information from daily maximum temperature observations from 1951 to 2005, and tested it for significant changes over time due to global warming as well as due to changes in patterns of large-scale natural climate variability. We found that many locations have seen a statistically significant decrease in the OSS length, particularly in Southwest and Central Canada. This suggests that future global warming has the potential to significantly compromise the viability of outdoor skating in Canada.\n\nThe implementation of a municipal indoor ice skating helmet policy: effects on helmet use, participation and attitudes.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Mahony-Menton, Colleen; Willmore, Jacqueline; Russell, Katherine\n\n2015-12-01\n\nIn Ottawa, between 2005 and 2009 there was an annual average of 47.2 head injuries due to ice skating in children and youth (1-19â years of age) requiring a visit to the emergency department, with the highest rates among those aged 5-14â years. Between 2002 and 2007, only 6% of children were wearing a helmet during ice skating when the head injury occurred. During indoor public skating sessions, 93% of children (<10â years)-57% aged 10-12â years, 20% aged 13-17â years and 9% adults-wore helmets in the absence of a policy. Support for a helmet policy was high from public health, medical, political and community perspectives. Helmet policies in relation to cycling have demonstrated increases in helmet use and reduction of head injuries without decreasing physical activity. However, no known studies have examined the effect of indoor ice skating helmet policy coupled with education and promotional activities on helmet use, participation and attitudes towards helmet use. An ice skating helmet policy for children (<11â years of age) and those with limited skating experience at indoor rinks during public skating sessions was developed, implemented and evaluated. Supportive activities such as discount coupons, promotional materials, a media launch, social marketing and staff training are described. The helmet policy was associated with increased helmet use for young children and for older children, youth and adults not included in the policy, without decreasing attendance to public skating sessions.

The LUL purports to provide an early warning to players to keep their head up prior to and as they are being checked. We determined if players looked up more on a rink with the LUL compared to a traditional Control rink. Elite offensive (O) and defensive (D) players competed 1 vs. 1, while wearing an eye tracker that recorded their quiet eye (QE) and fixation and tracking (F-T) and an electrogoniometer that measured head angle. External cameras recorded skate duration during four skate phases: P1 preparation, P2 decision-making, P3 cut to boards, P4 contact. The QE was the final fixation prior to contact between O and D as they skated towards and across the WL during P3 and P4. Skate phase durations (%) did not differ by rink or rink by position. More QE and F-T occurred on the WL on the LUL rink than on the Control. The expected increase in head angle on the LUL rink did not occur during P3 or P4. Post-hoc results also showed O and D skated further from the boards on the LUL rink, suggesting the players preferred to control the puck on white ice, rather than the orange colour of the LUL rink. More research is needed to determine if these results apply to the competitive setting.\n\nSliding temperatures of ice skates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nColbeck, S. C.; Najarian, L.; Smith, H. B.\n\n1997-06-01\n\nThe two theories developed to explain the low friction of ice, pressure melting and frictional heating, require opposite temperature shifts at the ice-skate interface. The arguments against pressure melting are strong, but only theoretical. A set of direct temperature measurements shows that frictional heating is the dominant mechanism because temperature behaves in the manner predicted by the theory of frictional heating. Like snow skis, ice skates are warmed by sliding and then cool when the sliding stops. The temperature increases with speed and with thermal insulation. The sliding leaves a warm track on the ice surface behind the skate and the skate sprays warm ejecta.\n\nLos Alamos Canyon Ice Rink Parking Flood Plain Assessment\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHathcock, Charles Dean; Keller, David Charles\n\n2015-02-10\n\nThe project location is in Los Alamos Canyon east of the ice rink facility at the intersection of West and Omega roads (Figure 1). Forty eight parking spaces will be constructed on the north and south side of Omega Road, and a lighted walking path will be constructed to the ice rink. Some trees will be removed during this action. A guardrail of approximately 400 feet will be constructed along the north side of West Road to prevent unsafe parking in that area.\n\nSolving the energy dilemma at Seven Bridges Ice Arena\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLouria, D.\n\n1996-08-01\n\nSeven Bridges Ice Arena with three ice skating rinks is among the largest ice skating facilities in the US. A complete fitness center, pro shop, second level observation gallery, restaurant, aerobics room, dance studio and children`s play room round out the 120,000 ft{sup 2} (11,215 m{sup 2}) world class facility. The Olympic Hockey League ice rink has seating for 800 spectators; and the National Hockey League ice rink has 1,200 spectator seats. The collegiate ice sheet has participant seating only. When building the one-year-old facility, the management initially solicited HVAC design/build system plans based on the usual Package Roof TopmoreÂ Â» (RTU) heat/cool units or split system parameters. Such a plan could have been a disaster because high energy costs have contributed directly to the closing of 20 rinks in the Chicago area. This article describes a HVAC system that would take advantage of every Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECO) possible to ensure the economic well being of this property.

Comparison is made with series in the literature reporting high levels of injuries, with corresponding demands on local hospital services, from newly established ice rinks. The main conclusion is that demands on hospital services have been markedly reduced for the well established rink, with corresponding savings in health service resources.

J.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nA comparative study was carried out on a series of 72 ice-skating and 57 roller skating injuries over a sixteen month period. The average patient age was 20.5 years in the ice-skating group and 16.5 years in the roller skating group. Females predominated in both groups accounting for 72% of ice-skaters injured and 77% of roller skaters injured. Ice-skaters sustained more serious injuries than roller skaters as was evident from the significant difference in fracture numbers in the two groups. Ice-skating fractures accounted for 40% of all injuries while roller skating fractures were only 14% of their total injuries. The majority of ice-skating fractures occurred in females. As a result of our study we recommended several preventative measures.

Sinai Services at City Hospital Center of Elmhurst, New York, is reviewed. It was learned that the injuries resulting from collisions occurring in a skating rink were more serious than those resulting from street accidents. Data indicated that lack of expertise is a prominent factor in the production of serious injury. However, the sport has inherent risk which is not eliminated by expertise. It was concluded that roller skating can and does produce disabling injuries. In order to reduce the number of injuries it will be required to reduce crowding in rinks, designate separate beginners' areas, use training wheels or clampon-type of skates when learning, encourage lessons, and separate beginners in the rinks.\n\nHuman locomotion on ice: the evolution of ice-skating energetics through history.\n\nPubMed\n\nFormenti, Federico; Minetti, Alberto E\n\n2007-05-01\n\nMore than 3000 years ago, peoples living in the cold North European regions started developing tools such as ice skates that allowed them to travel on frozen lakes. We show here which technical and technological changes determined the main steps in the evolution of ice-skating performance over its long history. An in-depth historical research helped identify the skates displaying significantly different features from previous models and that could consequently determine a better performance in terms of speed and energy demand. Five pairs of ice skates were tested, from the bone-skates, dated about 1800 BC, to modern ones. This paper provides evidence for the fact that the metabolic cost of locomotion on ice decreased dramatically through history, the metabolic cost of modern ice-skating being only 25% of that associated with the use of bone-skates. Moreover, for the same metabolic power, nowadays skaters can achieve speeds four times higher than their ancestors could. In the range of speeds considered, the cost of travelling on ice was speed independent for each skate model, as for running. This latter finding, combined with the accepted relationship between time of exhaustion and the sustainable fraction of metabolic power, gives the opportunity to estimate the maximum skating speed according to the distance travelled. Ice skates were probably the first human powered locomotion tools to take the maximum advantage from the biomechanical properties of the muscular system: even when travelling at relatively high speeds, the skating movement pattern required muscles to shorten slowly so that they could also develop a considerable amount of force.\n\nAnalysis of motion in speed skating\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKoga, Yuzo; Nishimura, Tetsu; Watanabe, Naoki; Okamoto, Kousuke; Wada, Yuhei\n\n1997-03-01\n\nA motion on sports has been studied by many researchers from the view of the medical, psychological and mechanical fields. Here, we try to analyze a speed skating motion dynamically for an aim of performing the best record. As an official competition of speed skating is performed on the round rink, the skating motion must be studied on the three phases, that is, starting phase, straight and curved course skating phase. It is indispensable to have a visual data of a skating motion in order to analyze kinematically. So we took a several subject's skating motion by 8 mm video cameras in order to obtain three dimensional data. As the first step, the movement of the center of gravity of skater (abbreviate to C. G.) is discussed in this paper, because a skating motion is very complicated. The movement of C. G. will give an information of the reaction force to a skate blade from the surface of ice. We discuss the discrepancy of several skating motion by studied subjects. Our final goal is to suggest the best skating form for getting the finest record.\n\nTheory of ice-skating\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLe Berre, Martine; Pomeau, Yves\n\n2015-10-01\n\nAlmost frictionless skating on ice relies on a thin layer of melted water insulating mechanically the blade of the skate from ice. Using the basic equations of fluid mechanics and Stefan law, we derive a set of two coupled equations for the thickness of the film and the length of contact, a length scale which cannot be taken as its value at rest. The analytical study of these equations allows to define a small a-dimensional parameter depending on the longitudinal coordinate which can be neglected everywhere except close to the contact points at the front and the end of the blade, where a boundary layer solution is given. This solution provides without any calculation the order of magnitude of the film thickness, and its dependence with respect to external parameters like the velocity and mass of the skater and the radius of profile and bite angle of the blade, in good agreement with the numerical study. Moreover this solution also shows that a lubricating water layer of macroscopic thickness always exists for standard values of ice skating data, contrary to what happens in the case of cavitation of droplets due to thermal heating (Leidenfrost effect).\n\nA review of the physics of ice surface friction and the development of ice skating.\n\nPubMed\n\nFormenti, Federico\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOur walking and running movement patterns require friction between shoes and ground. The surface of ice is characterised by low friction in several naturally occurring conditions, and compromises our typical locomotion pattern. Ice skates take advantage of this slippery nature of ice; the first ice skates were made more than 4000 years ago, and afforded the development of a very efficient form of human locomotion. This review presents an overview of the physics of ice surface friction, and discusses the most relevant factors that can influence ice skates' dynamic friction coefficient. It also presents the main stages in the development of ice skating, describes the associated implications for exercise physiology, and shows the extent to which ice skating performance improved through history. This article illustrates how technical and materials' development, together with empirical understanding of muscle biomechanics and energetics, led to one of the fastest forms of human powered locomotion.\n\nMultiple Off-Ice Performance Variables Predict On-Ice Skating Performance in Male and Female Division III Ice Hockey Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nJanot, Jeffrey M; Beltz, Nicholas M; Dalleck, Lance D\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine if off-ice performance variables could predict on-ice skating performance in Division III collegiate hockey players. Both men (n = 15) and women (n = 11) hockey players (age = 20.5 Â± 1.4 years) participated in the study. The skating tests were agility cornering S-turn, 6.10 m acceleration, 44.80 m speed, modified repeat skate, and 15.20 m full speed. Off-ice variables assessed were years of playing experience, height, weight and percent body fat and off-ice performance variables included vertical jump (VJ), 40-yd dash (36.58m), 1-RM squat, pro-agility, Wingate peak power and peak power percentage drop (% drop), and 1.5 mile (2.4km) run. Results indicated that 40-yd dash (36.58m), VJ, 1.5 mile (2.4km) run, and % drop were significant predictors of skating performance for repeat skate (slowest, fastest, and average time) and 44.80 m speed time, respectively. Four predictive equations were derived from multiple regression analyses: 1) slowest repeat skate time = 2.362 + (1.68 x 40-yd dash time) + (0.005 x 1.5 mile run), 2) fastest repeat skate time = 9.762 - (0.089 x VJ) - (0.998 x 40-yd dash time), 3) average repeat skate time = 7.770 + (1.041 x 40-yd dash time) - (0.63 x VJ) + (0.003 x 1.5 mile time), and 4) 47.85 m speed test = 7.707 - (0.050 x VJ) - (0.01 x % drop). It was concluded that selected off-ice tests could be used to predict on-ice performance regarding speed and recovery ability in Division III male and female hockey players.

In this study a novel on-ice measurement approach was tested for reliability, and subsequently implemented to investigate the forward skating technique, as well as technique differences across skill levels. Nine high caliber (High) and nine low caliber (Low) hockey players performed 30 m forward skating trials. A 3D accelerometer was mounted to the right skate for the purpose of stride detection, with the 2nd and 6th strides defined as acceleration and steady-state, respectively. The activity of five lower extremity muscles was recorded using surface electromyography. Biaxial electro-goniometers were used to quantify hip and knee angles, and in-skate plantar force was measured using instrumented insoles. Reliability was assessed with the coefficient of multiple correlation, which demonstrated moderate (r>0.65) to excellent (r>0.95) scores across selected measured variables. Greater plantar-flexor muscle activity and hip extension were evident during acceleration strides, while steady state strides exhibited greater knee extensor activity and hip abduction range of motion (p<0.05). High caliber exhibited greater hip range of motion and forefoot force application (p<0.05). The successful implementation of this on-ice mobile measurement approach offers potential for athlete monitoring, biofeedback and training advice.\n\nComparison of skating kinetics and kinematics on ice and on a synthetic surface.\n\nPubMed\n\nStidwill, T J; Pearsall, David; Turcotte, Rene\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThe recent popularization and technological improvements of synthetic or artificial ice surfaces provide an attractive alternative to real ice in venues where the latter is impractical to install. Potentially, synthetic ice (SI) may be installed in controlled laboratory settings to permit detailed biomechanical analysis of skating manoeuvres. Unknown, however, is the extent to which skating on SI replicates skating on traditional ice (ICE). Hence, the purpose of this study was to compare kinetic and kinematic forward skating parameters between SI and ICE surfaces. With 11 male hockey players, a portable strain gauge system adhered to the outside of the skate blade holder was used to measure skate propulsive force synchronized with electrogoniometers for tracking dynamic knee and ankle movements during forward skating acceleration. In general, the kinetic and kinematic variables investigated in this study showed minimal differences between the two surfaces (P > 0.06), and no individual variable differences were identified between the two surfaces (P > or = 0.1) with the exception of greater knee extension on SI than ICE (15.2 degrees to 11.0 degrees; P < or = 0.05). Overall, SI surfaces permit comparable mechanics for on-ice forward skating, and thus offer the potential for valid analogous conditions for in-lab testing and training.\n\nAn On-Ice Measurement Approach to Analyse the Biomechanics of Ice Hockey Skating\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBuckeridge, Erica; LeVangie, Marc C.; Stetter, Bernd; Nigg, Sandro R.; Nigg, Benno M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSkating is a fundamental movement in ice hockey; however little research has been conducted within the field of hockey skating biomechanics due to the difficulties of on-ice data collection.

Twenty female, forward and defensive players (19.95 Â± 1.35 yr) were assessed for weight, height, percent fat mass (%FAT), bone mineral density, predicted one repetition maximum (RM) absolute and relative (REL%) bench press (BP) and hex bar deadlift (HDL), lower body explosive power, anaerobic power, countermovement vertical jump (CMJ), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), and on-ice repeated skate sprint (RSS) performance. The on-ice RSS test included 6 timed 85.6 m sprints with participants wearing full hockey equipment; fastest time (FT), average time (AT) and fatigue index (FI) for the first length skate (FLS; 10 m) and total length skate (TLS; 85.6 m) were used for analysis. Game performance was evaluated with game statistics: goals, assists, points, plus-minus, and shots on goal (SOG). Correlation coefficients were used to determine relationships. Percent fat mass was positively correlated (p < 0.05) with FLS-FI and TLS-AT; TLS-FT was negatively correlated with REL%HDL; BP-RM was negatively correlated with FLS-FT and FLS-AT; MIP positively correlated with assists, points, and SOG; FLS-AT negatively correlated with assists. Game performance in women ice hockey players may be enhanced by greater MIP, repeat acceleration ability, and mode-specific training. Faster skating times were associated with lower %FAT. Skating performance in women ice hockey players may be enhanced by improving body composition, anaerobic power, and both lower and upper body strength in off-ice training.\n\nSkating mechanics of change-of-direction manoeuvres in ice hockey players.\n\nPubMed\n\nFortier, Antoine; Turcotte, RenÃ© A; Pearsall, David J\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIce hockey requires rapid transitions between skating trajectories to effectively navigate about the ice surface. Player performance relates in large part to effective change-of-direction manoeuvres, but little is known about how those skills are performed mechanically and the effect of equipment design on them. The purpose of this study was to observe the kinetics involved in those manoeuvres as well as to compare whether kinetic differences may result between two skate models of varying ankle mobility. Eight subjects with competitive ice hockey playing experience performed rapid lateral (90Â°) left and right change-of-direction manoeuvres. Kinetic data were collected using force strain gauge transducers on the blade holders of the skates. Significantly greater forces were applied by the outside skate (50-70% body weight, %BW) in comparison to the inside skate (12-24%BW, p < 0.05). Skate model and turn direction had no main effect, though significant mixed interactions between leg side (inside/outside) with skate model or turn direction (p < 0.05) were observed, with a trend for left-turn dominance. This study demonstrates the asymmetric dynamic behaviour inherent in skating change-of-direction tasks.\n\nSkating start propulsion: three-dimensional kinematic analysis of elite male and female ice hockey players.\n\nPubMed\n\nShell, Jaymee R; Robbins, Shawn M K; Dixon, Philippe C; Renaud, Philippe J; Turcotte, RenÃ© A; Wu, Tom; Pearsall, David J\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe forward skating start is a fundamental skill for male and female ice hockey players. However, performance differences by athlete's sex cannot be fully explained by physiological variables; hence, other factors such as skating technique warrant examination. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the body movement kinematics of ice hockey skating starts between elite male and female ice hockey participants. Male (nÂ =Â 9) and female (nÂ =Â 10) elite ice hockey players performed five forward skating start accelerations. An 18-camera motion capture system placed on the arena ice surface captured full-body kinematics during the first seven skating start steps within 15Â meters. Males' maximum skating speeds were greater than females. Skating technique sex differences were noted: in particular, females presented ~10Â° lower hip abduction throughout skating stance as well as ~10Â° greater knee extension at initial ice stance contact, conspicuously followed by a brief cessation in knee extension at the moment of ice contact, not evident in male skaters. Further study is warranted to explain why these skating technique differences exist in relation to factors such as differences in training, equipment, performance level, and anthropometrics.\n\nIce friction of flared ice hockey skate blades.\n\nPubMed\n\nFederolf, Peter A; Mills, Robert; Nigg, Benno\n\n2008-09-01\n\nIn ice hockey, skating performance depends on the skill and physical conditioning of the players and on the characteristics of their equipment. CT Edge have recently designed a new skate blade that angles outward near the bottom of the blade. The objective of this study was to compare the frictional characteristics of three CT Edge blades (with blade angles of 4 degrees, 60, and 8 degrees, respectively) with the frictional characteristics of a standard skate blade. The friction coefficients of the blades were determined by measuring the deceleration of an aluminium test sled equipped with three test blades. The measurements were conducted with an initial sled speed of 1.8 m s(-1) and with a load of 53 kg on each blade. The friction coefficient of the standard blades was 0.0071 (s = 0.0005). For the CT Edge blades with blade angles of 4 degrees, 6 degrees, and 8 degrees, friction coefficients were lower by about 13%, 21%, and 22%, respectively. Furthermore, the friction coefficients decreased with increasing load. The results of this study show that widely accepted paradigms such as \"thinner blades cause less friction\" need to be revisited. New blade designs might also be able to reduce friction in speed skating, figure skating, bobsledding, and luge.\n\nInstructional Basics: Oppelt Standard Method of Therapeutic and Recreational Ice Skating.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOppelt, Kurt\n\nDetailed in the booklet is the standard ice skating method and considered are the benefits of therapeutic ice skating for the handicapped and aged.

The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of skating with an additional load on the skate, using a skate weight prototype, on kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activation during the acceleration phase while skating on a synthetic ice surface. 10 male hockey skaters accelerated from rest (standing erect with knees slightly bent) under four non-randomized load conditions: baseline 1 (no weight), light (0.9Â kg per skate), heavy (1.8Â kg per skate), and baseline 2 (no weight). Skating with additional weight caused athletes to skate slower (pÂ <Â 0.001; Î· 2 Â =Â 0.551), and led to few changes in kinematics: hip sagittal range of motion (ROM) decreased (2.2Â°; pÂ =Â 0.032; Î· 2 Â =Â 0.274), hip transverse ROM decreased (3.4Â°; pÂ <Â 0.001; Î· 2 Â =Â 0.494), ankle sagittal ROM decreased (2.3Â°; pÂ =Â 0.022; Î· 2 Â =Â 0.295), and knee sagittal ROM increased (7.8Â°; pÂ <Â 0.001, Î· 2 Â =Â 0.761). Overall, weighted skates decreased skating velocity, but athletes maintained similar muscle activation profiles (magnitude and trends) with minor changes to their skating kinematics.\n\nPhysiological correlates of skating performance in women's and men's ice hockey.\n\nPubMed\n\nGilenstam, Kajsa M; Thorsen, Kim; Henriksson-LarsÃ©n, Karin B\n\n2011-08-01\n\nThe purpose of the current investigation was to identify relationships between physiological off-ice tests and on-ice performance in female and male ice hockey players on a comparable competitive level. Eleven women, 24 Â± 3.0 years, and 10 male ice hockey players, 23 Â± 2.4 years, were tested for background variables: height, body weight (BW), ice hockey history, and lean body mass (LBM) and peak torque (PT) of the thigh muscles, VO2peak and aerobic performance (Onset of Blood Lactate Accumulation [OBLA], respiratory exchange ratio [RER1]) during an incremental bicycle ergometer test. Four different on-ice tests were used to measure ice skating performance. For women, skating time was positively correlated (p < 0.05) to BW and negatively correlated to LBM%, PT/BW, OBLA, RER 1, and VO2peak (ml O2Â·kg(-1) BW(-1)Â·min(-1)) in the Speed test. Acceleration test was positively correlated to BW and negatively correlated to OBLA and RER 1. For men, correlation analysis revealed only 1 significant correlation where skating time was positively correlated to VO2peak (L O2Â·min(-1)) in the Acceleration test. The male group had significantly higher physiological test values in all variables (absolute and relative to BW) but not in relation to LBM. Selected off-ice tests predict skating performance for women but not for men. The group of women was significantly smaller and had a lower physiological performance than the group of men and were slower in the on-ice performance tests. However, gender differences in off-ice variables were reduced or disappeared when values were related to LBM, indicating a similar capacity of producing strength and aerobic power in female and male hockey players. Skating performance in female hockey players may be improved by increasing thigh muscle strength, oxygen uptake, and relative muscle mass.\n\nEvaluation of an adaptive ice skating programme for children with disabilities.\n\nPubMed\n\nFragala-Pinkham, Maria A; Dumas, Helene M; Boyce, Megan; Peters, Christine Y; Haley, Stephen M\n\n2009-08-01\n\nTo describe an adaptive ice skating programme designed by paediatric therapists. Twenty-two children, ages 5-12 years, with developmental disabilities participated in this once per week skating programme lasting 6 weeks. Ice skating instructors led the group lessons, while university student coaches provided individualized assistance to the children. The programme was evaluated using a summative evaluation design. Outcomes included participant attendance, incidence of injuries, skating skills and parent and student coach survey data. On average, participants attended 83% of the sessions and one minor injury was reported. Participants' parents were very satisfied with the programme and reported improvements in their child's skating skills, leg strength, endurance, balance, self-esteem/confidence and ability to participate in a group. Student coaches also reported high levels of satisfaction with this programme and reported similar improvements in the children they coached. The programme appeared promising, but may require minor modifications.\n\nIce skating promotes postural control in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nKeller, M; RÃ¶ttger, K; Taube, W\n\n2014-12-01\n\nHigh fall rates causing injury and enormous financial costs are reported for children. However, only few studies investigated the effects of balance training in children and these studies did not find enhanced balance performance in postural (transfer) tests. Consequently, it was previously speculated that classical balance training might not be stimulating enough for children to adequately perform these exercises. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of ice skating as an alternative form of balance training. Volunteers of an intervention (nâ=â17; INT: 13.1âÂ±â0.4 years) and a control group (nâ=â13; CON: 13.2âÂ±â0.3 years) were tested before and after training in static and dynamic postural transfer tests. INT participated in eight sessions of ice skating during education lessons, whereas CON participated in normal physical education. Enhanced balance performance was observed in INT but not in CON when tested on an unstable free-swinging platform (Pâ<â0.05) or when performing a functional reach test (Pâ<â0.001). This is the first study showing significantly enhanced balance performance after ice skating in children. More importantly, participating children improved static and dynamic balance control in postural tasks that were not part of the training. Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Twenty (M = 18; F = 2) highly skilled hockey players (age 15.9 +/- 1.5 yr) completed 16 wk of standardized resistance and stability training supplemented with either off-ice simulated skating using the SkateSIM (SIM) or plyometric training (PLY) in a crossover design. Group 1 (PLY-SIM; N = 11) completed 8 wk of PLY followed by 8 wk of SIM. Group 2 (SIM-PLY; N = 9) completed 8 wk of SIM followed by 8 wk of PLY. Subjects completed on- and off-ice testing PRE, MID, and POST training. Significant improvements in on-ice 35-m skating sprint (1.0%; P = .009) with significant improvements of 5% to 12% in various off-ice testing measures were observed PRE-MID in both groups. While few off-ice tests improved MID-POST, on-ice 35-m skating sprint times improved MID-POST by 2.3% (P = .000) with greater improvement in PLYSIM (3.5%) versus SIM-PLY (0.8%; P < .002). Off-ice 30-m sprint (r = 0.56; P = .010) and Edgren side shuffle (r = -0.46; P < .040) were the only off-ice tests that significantly correlated to improvements in on-ice skating sprint performance. The initial gains PRE-MID and then the lack of improvement in many off-ice tests from the MID-POST supports the principle of diminishing returns in response to standardized resistance training. The improvement in on-ice skating sprint performance when supplemental training progressed in specificity supports the principle of specificity and promotes transfer to a complex sporting movement such as skating.\n\nMorphological, Physiological and Skating Performance Profiles of Male Age-Group Elite Ice Hockey Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nAllisse, Maxime; Sercia, Pierre; Comtois, Alain-Steve; Leone, Mario\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of morphological, physiological and skating performance profiles of elite age-group ice hockey players based on repeated measures spread over one season. In addition, the results of fitness tests and training programs performed in off-ice conditions and their relationship with skating performance were analyzed. Eighteen high level age-group ice hockey players (13.1 Â± 0.6 years) were assessed off and on-ice at the beginning and at the end of the hockey season. A third evaluation was also conducted at the beginning of the following hockey season. The players were taller, heavier, and showed bone breadths and muscle girths above the reference population of the same age. Muscular variables improved significantly during and between the two hockey seasons (p < 0.05). However, maximal aerobic power improved only during the off-season. All skating performance tests exhibited significant enhancements during the hockey season, but not during the off-season where some degradation was observed. Finally, weak observed variances (generally <20% of the explained variance) between physiological variables measured off-ice and on-ice skating performance tests indicated important gaps, both in the choice of the off-ice assessment tools as well as in training methods conventionally used.

However, children with a disability often experience difficulty participating in physical activity due to a lack of suitable opportunities. Participation in an accessible sport is particularly important for these children, but studies examining which sports are beneficial for which disability groups are rare. In this study, we assessed the effects of ice skating on the psychological well-being, self-concept, and sleep quality of children with hearing or visual impairment. Forty students (20 visually impaired and 20 hearing impaired) aged 8-16 were included in a regular ice skating programme for three months. We examined the sleep quality, self-concept, and behavioural and emotional states of the children before and after participating in the programme. There was a significant improvement in self-concept, behavioural and emotional problems, and sleep quality (pâ<â0.05 for each) of the children with hearing impairment. Although the sleep quality (pâ=â0.019) and emotional problem scores (pâ=â0.000) of the visually impaired children improved; self-concept, peer relations and hyperactivity scores of these children worsened (pâ<â0.05 for each). Ice skating is one of the popular sport alternatives that gives children the opportunity to exercise and have fun together. The results of this study revealed that regular ice skating programmes may have positive effects on the psychological well-being of children with hearing impairment. Despite some positive effects, caution must be use when including visually impaired children in ice skating programmes. Generalization of the study's outcomes is limited as the study group were residential students enrolled in special education institutions for children who are blind or deaf. Ice skating is a community-based sport and a popular leisure activity that can also have benefits for people with disabilities.

The purpose of this study was to give a descriptive overview of injury patterns occurring during ice skating. Special emphasis was put on injury severity by using a standardised injury classification system. Over a six month period, all patients treated with ice-skating-related injuries at Europe's largest hospital were included. Patient demographics were collected and all injuries categorised according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2005. A descriptive statistic and logistic regression analysis was performed. Three hundred and forty-one patients (134Â M, 207Â F) were included in this study. Statistical analysis revealed that age had a significant influence on injury severity. People > 50Â years had a higher risk of sustaining a more severe injury according to the AIS compared with younger skaters. Furthermore, the risk of head injury was significantly lower for people aged between 18 and 50Â years than for people < 18Â years (pâ=â0.0007) and significantly higher for people >Â 50Â years than for people aged between 18 and 50Â years (pâ=â0.04). The severity of ice-skating injuries is associated with the patient's age, showing more severe injuries in older patients. Awareness should be raised among the public and physicians about the risks associated with this activity in order to promote further educational interventions and the use of protective gear.\n\nRelationship Between Skating Economy and Performance During a Repeated-Shift Test in Elite and Subelite Ice Hockey Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nLamoureux, Nicholas R; Tomkinson, Grant R; Peterson, Benjamin J; Fitzgerald, John S\n\n2018-04-01\n\nLamoureux, NR, Tomkinson, GR, Peterson, BJ, and Fitzgerald, JS. Relationship between skating economy and performance during a repeated-shift test in elite and subelite ice hockey players. J Strength Cond Res 32(4): 1109-1113, 2018-The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of skating economy to fatigue during repeated high-intensity efforts of a simulated ice hockey shift. Forty-five collegiate and Junior A male ice hockey players (aged 18-24 years) performed a continuous graded exercise test using a skate treadmill. Breath-by-breath data for oxygen consumption (V[Combining Dot Above]O2) and respiratory exchange ratio were collected and used to derive energy expenditure (EE) averaged over the final 10 seconds of each stage. Economy was determined as the slope of the regression line relating V[Combining Dot Above]O2 and EE against skating speed separately. Participants also completed 8 bouts of maximal ice skating through a course designed to simulate typical shift, with timing gates determining first half, second half, and total fatigue decrement, calculated by a percent decrement score. Partial correlation was used to determine the association between economy measures and decrement during the repeated-shift test. Twenty-six participants met inclusion criteria and were included in data analysis. Skating economy measures (both relative V[Combining Dot Above]O2 and EE) were very likely moderate positive correlates of total fatigue decrement (r [95% confidence interval]: V[Combining Dot Above]O2, 0.46 [0.09, 0.72] and EE, 0.44, [0.06, 0.71]) but not with first or second gate decrement. Our results indicate that skating economy plays an important role in fatigue resistance over repeated on-ice sprints designed to simulate a typical shift. This supports the use of technical skating coaching and training techniques to enhance skating economy as a means of improving ice hockey performance.\n\nIce Skating: Special Olympics Sports Skills Instructional Program.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSpecial Olympics, Inc., Washington, DC.\n\nOne of seven booklets on Special Olympics Sports Skills Instructional Programs, this guide presents teaching suggestions for ice skating coaches working with mentally retarded persons.

The purpose of our study was to validate an ice hockey aerobic field test on players of varying ages, abilities, and levels. The Faught Aerobic Skating Test (FAST) uses an on-ice continuous skating protocol on a course measuring 160 feet (48.8 m) using a CD to pace the skater with a beep signal to cross the starting line at each end of the course. The FAST incorporates the principle of increasing workload at measured time intervals during a continuous skating exercise. Step-wise multiple regression modelling was used to determine the estimate of aerobic power. Participants completed a maximal aerobic power test using a modified Bruce incremental treadmill protocol, as well as the on-ice FAST. Normative data were collected on 406 ice hockey players (291 males, 115 females) ranging in age from 9 to 25 y. A regression to predict maximum aerobic power was developed using body mass (kg), height (m), age (y), and maximum completed lengths of the FAST as the significant predictors of skating aerobic power (adjusted R2 = 0.387, SEE = 7.25 mL.kg-1.min-1, p < 0.0001). These results support the application of the FAST in estimating aerobic power among male and female competitive ice hockey players between the ages of 9 and 25 years.\n\nRelationship between body composition, leg strength, anaerobic power, and on-ice skating performance in division I men's hockey athletes.\n\nPubMed\n\nPotteiger, Jeffrey A; Smith, Dean L; Maier, Mark L; Foster, Timothy S\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine relationships between laboratory tests and on-ice skating performance in division I men's hockey athletes. Twenty-one men (age 20.7 +/- 1.6 years) were assessed for body composition, isokinetic force production in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, and anaerobic muscle power via the Wingate 30-second cycle ergometer test. Air displacement plethysmography was used to determine % body fat (%FAT), fat-free mass (FFM), and fat mass. Peak torque and total work during 10 maximal effort repetitions at 120 degrees .s were measured during concentric muscle actions using an isokinetic dynamometer. Muscle power was measured using a Monark cycle ergometer with resistance set at 7.5% of body mass. On-ice skating performance was measured during 6 timed 89-m sprints with subjects wearing full hockey equipment. First length skate (FLS) was 54 m, and total length skate (TLS) was 89 m with fastest and average skating times used in the analysis. Correlation coefficients were used to determine relationships between laboratory testing and on-ice performance. Subjects had a body mass of 88.8 +/- 7.8 kg and %FAT of 11.9 +/- 4.6. First length skate-Average and TLS-Average skating times were moderately correlated to %FAT ([r = 0.53; p = 0.013] and [r = 0.57; p = 0.007]) such that a greater %FAT was related to slower skating speeds. First length skate-Fastest was correlated to Wingate percent fatigue index (r = -0.48; p = 0.027) and FLS-Average was correlated to Wingate peak power per kilogram body mass (r = -0.43; p = 0.05). Laboratory testing of select variables can predict skating performance in ice hockey athletes. This information can be used to develop targeted and effective strength and conditioning programs that will improve on-ice skating speed.\n\nLaboratory- and field-based testing as predictors of skating performance in competitive-level female ice hockey.\n\nPubMed\n\nHenriksson, Tommy; Vescovi, Jason D; Fjellman-Wiklund, Anncristine; Gilenstam, Kajsa\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine whether field-based and/or laboratory-based assessments are valid tools for predicting key performance characteristics of skating in competitive-level female hockey players. Cross-sectional study. Twenty-three female ice hockey players aged 15-25 years (body mass: 66.1Â±6.3 kg; height: 169.5Â±5.5 cm), with 10.6Â±3.2 years playing experience volunteered to participate in the study. The field-based assessments included 20 m sprint, squat jump, countermovement jump, 30-second repeated jump test, standing long jump, single-leg standing long jump, 20 m shuttle run test, isometric leg pull, one-repetition maximum bench press, and one-repetition maximum squats. The laboratory-based assessments included body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), maximal aerobic power, and isokinetic strength (Biodex). The on-ice tests included agility cornering s-turn, cone agility skate, transition agility skate, and modified repeat skate sprint. Data were analyzed using stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis. Linear regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between key performance characteristics of skating and the predictor variables. Regression models (adj R (2)) for the on-ice variables ranged from 0.244 to 0.663 for the field-based assessments and from 0.136 to 0.420 for the laboratory-based assessments. Single-leg tests were the strongest predictors for key performance characteristics of skating. Single leg standing long jump alone explained 57.1%, 38.1%, and 29.1% of the variance in skating time during transition agility skate, agility cornering s-turn, and modified repeat skate sprint, respectively. Isokinetic peak torque in the quadriceps at 90Â° explained 42.0% and 32.2% of the variance in skating time during agility cornering s-turn and modified repeat skate sprint, respectively.

Analysis of high-intensity skating in top-class ice hockey match-play in relation to training status and muscle damage. J Strength Cond Res 32(5): 1303-1310, 2018-We examined high-intensity activities in a top-class ice-hockey game and the effect of training status. Male ice-hockey players (n = 36) from the National Hockey League participated. Match analysis was performed during a game and physical capacity was assessed by a submaximal Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Ice-hockey test, level 1 (YYIR1-IHSUB). Venous blood samples were collected 24-hour post-game to determine markers of muscle damage. Players performed 119 Â± 8 and 31 Â± 3 mÂ·min of high intensity and sprint skating, respectively, during a game. Total distance covered was 4,606 Â± 219 m (2,260-6,749 m), of which high-intensity distance was 2042 Â± 97 m (757-3,026 m). Sprint-skating speed was 5-8% higher (p â¤ 0.05) in periods 1 and 2 vs. period 3 and overtime. Defensemen (D) covered 29% more (p â¤ 0.05) skating in total than forwards (F) and were on the ice 47% longer. However, F performed 54% more (p â¤ 0.05) high-intensity skating per minute than defensemen. Plasma creatine kinase (CK) was 338 Â± 45 (78-757) UÂ·L 24-hour post-game. Heart rate loading during YYIR1-IHSUB correlated inversely (p â¤ 0.05) to the frequency of high-intensity skating bouts (r = -0.55) and V[Combining Dot Above]O2max (r = -0.85) and positively to post-game CK (r = 0.49; p â¤ 0.05). In conclusion, ice hockey is a multiple-sprint sport that provokes fatigue in the latter half of a game. Forwards perform more intense skating than defensemen. Moreover, high-intensity game activities during top-class ice hockey are correlated with cardiovascular loading during a submaximal skating test. Taken together, training of elite ice-hockey players should improve the ability for repeated high-intensity skating, and testing should include the YYIR1-IHSUB test as an indicator for ice\n\nCase histories of building material problems caused by condensation at an enclosed swimming pool and an enclosed ice rink\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVanGeem, M.G.; Farahmandpour, K.; Gajda, J.\n\n1999-07-01\n\nEnclosed swimming pools and ice rinks in winter climates have the potential for high indoor relative humidities and cold building materials. These elements can contribute to condensation and premature deterioration of building materials. Case histories are provided for an enclosed swimming pool and an enclosed ice rink with condensation problems. An evaluation was performed after roof leaks were reported at a recently constructed indoor swimming pool in a Chicago suburb. After a preliminary inspection, it was evident that the reported leaks were related to building moisture problems rather than a roof leak. Exterior brick masonry exhibited heavy efflorescence in themoreÂ Â» area of the swimming pools, and water streaks were visible on the exterior walls below the eaves. The evaluation included laboratory testing, a visual inspection, field tests and measurements, and analyses for condensation potential. Results of the evaluation indicated the presence of condensed moisture as a direct cause of the observed water stains, and masonry efflorescence. Recommended corrective actions developed. A 54-year-old enclosed ice rink in New England was under investigation to determine the cause of a deteriorated wood deck roof. The building did not have dehumidification or air handling systems, and was heated only when occupied. The evaluation included visual inspection and analyses for condensation potential. Results of the evaluation indicated condensation within the wood decking and insulation during winter months, and high relative humidities that prohibited drying during the spring, summer, and fall. These conditions, over an extended number of years, resulted in decay of the wood decking.Â«Â less\n\nUpdating the Skating Multistage Aerobic Test and Correction for V[Combining Dot Above]O2max Prediction Using a New Skating Economy Index in Elite Youth Ice Hockey Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nAllisse, Maxime; Bui, Hung Tien; LÃ©ger, Luc; Comtois, Alain-Steve; Leone, Mario\n\n2018-05-07\n\nAllisse, M, Bui, HT, LÃ©ger, L, Comtois, A-S, and Leone, M. Updating the skating multistage aerobic test and correction for V[Combining Dot Above]O2max prediction using a new skating economy index in elite youth ice hockey players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2018-A number of field tests, including the skating multistage aerobic test (SMAT), have been developed to predict V[Combining Dot Above]O2max in ice hockey players. The SMAT, like most field tests, assumes that participants who reach a given stage have the same oxygen uptake, which is not usually true. Thus, the objectives of this research are to update the V[Combining Dot Above]O2 values during the SMAT using a portable breath-by-breath metabolic analyzer and to propose a simple index of skating economy to improve the prediction of oxygen uptake. Twenty-six elite hockey players (age 15.8 Â± 1.3 years) participated in this study. The oxygen uptake was assessed using a portable metabolic analyzer (K4b) during an on-ice maximal shuttle skate test. To develop an index of skating economy called the skating stride index (SSI), the number of skating strides was compiled for each stage of the test. The SMAT enabled the prediction of the V[Combining Dot Above]O2max (mlÂ·kgÂ·min) from the maximal velocity (mÂ·s) and the SSI (skating stridesÂ·kg) using the following regression equation: V[Combining Dot Above]O2max = (14.94 Ã maximal velocity) + (3.68 Ã SSI) - 24.98 (r = 0.95, SEE = 1.92). This research allowed for the update of the oxygen uptake values of the SMAT and proposed a simple measure of skating efficiency for a more accurate evaluation of V[Combining Dot Above]O2max in elite youth hockey players. By comparing the highest and lowest observed SSI scores in our sample, it was noted that the V[Combining Dot Above]O2 values can vary by up to 5 mlÂ·kgÂ·min. Our results suggest that skating economy should be included in the prediction of V[Combining Dot Above]O2max to improve prediction accuracy.\n\nSimulating LGM retreat of the Uummannaq Ice Stream and Rinks Isbrae, Western Greenland using a 1-D ice-stream model constrained by a suite of marine and terrestrial data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJamieson, Stewart; Roberts, Dave; Rea, Brice; Lane, Timothy; Vieli, Andreas; Cofaigh, Colm Ã.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nWe aim to understand what controlled the retreat pattern of the Uummannaq Ice Stream (UIS) during the last deglaciation. Evidence for the pattern of retreat is found in both the marine and terrestrial realms, but because the evidence is temporally and spatially discontinuous, it is challenging to coherently reconstruct both grounding-line retreat and ice-surface thinning such that they are in agreement. Marine stratigraphic and geophysical evidence indicates that the ice stream was grounded close to the continental shelf edge at the Last Glacial Maximum, and retreated rapidly and nonlinearly after 14.8 ka. Cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating on Ubekendt Island at the convergence zone of multiple feeder ice streams show that the ice surface thinned progressively and that the island became ice-free by ca. 12.4 ka. The ice stream then collapsed over the next 1-1.6 kyrs and the ice stream separated into a series of distinct inland arms. In the northernmost Rinks system, there is a 'staircase' of evidence showing ice surface thinning over time, but it is unclear where the grounding line was located during this phase of thinning. Furthermore, it is currently unclear what controlled the nonlinear retreat pattern identified in the Uummannaq system. We develop a numerical model of ice-stream retreat using the marine geophysical data and measurements of sediment strength on the continental shelf to control the boundary conditions. The model has the capability to dynamically and robustly simulate grounding line-retreat behaviour over millennial timescales. We simulate the retreat of the UIS grounding line into the northernmost Rinks system in response to enhanced ocean warming, rising sea level and warming climate. We compare the simulated dynamic behaviour of the UIS against the geomorphological and cosmogenic exposure evidence for ice surface thinning onshore and against dated marine grounding line positions. Our model results enable us to match grounding-line positions in\n\nEstablishing the Test-Retest Reliability & Concurrent Validity for the Repeat Ice Skating Test (RIST) in Adolescent Male Ice Hockey Players\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPower, Allan; Faught, Brent E.; Przysucha, Eryk; McPherson, Moira; Montelpare, William\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn this study the authors examine the test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the Repeat Ice Skating Test (RIST).

C.; Starbuck, P.; King, D. L.; Ridge, S. T.; Charles, S. K.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nCompetitive figure skaters experience substantial, repeated impact loading during jumps and landings. Although these loads, which are thought to be as high as six times body weight, can lead to overuse injuries, it is not currently possible to measure these forces on-ice. Consequently, efforts to improve safety for skaters are significantly limited. Here we present the development of an instrumented figure skating blade for measuring forces on-ice. The measurement system consists of strain gauges attached to the blade, Wheatstone bridge circuit boards, and a data acquisition device. The system is capable of measuring forces in the vertical and horizontal directions (inferior-superior and anterior-posterior directions, respectively) in each stanchion with a sampling rate of at least 1000âHz and a resolution of approximately one-tenth of body weight. The entire system weighs 142âg and fits in the space under the boot. Calibration between applied and measured force showed excellent agreement (R > 0.99), and a preliminary validation against a force plate showed good predictive ability overall (R â¥ 0.81 in vertical direction). The system overestimated the magnitude of the first and second impact peaks but detected their timing with high accuracy compared to the force plate.\n\nAutomated tracking of a figure skater by using PTZ cameras\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaraguchi, Tomohiko; Taki, Tsuyoshi; Hasegawa, Junichi\n\n2009-08-01\n\nIn this paper, a system for automated real-time tracking of a figure skater moving on an ice rink by using PTZ cameras is presented. This system is intended for support in training of skating, for example, as a tool for recording and evaluation of his/her motion performances. In the processing procedure of the system, an ice rink region is extracted first from a video image by region growing method, then one of hole components in the obtained rink region is extracted as a skater region. If there exists no hole component, a skater region is estimated from horizontal and vertical intensity projections of the rink region. Each camera is automatically panned and/or tilted so as to keep the skater region on almost the center of the image, and also zoomed so as to keep the height of the skater region within an appropriate range. In the experiments using 5 practical video images of skating, it was shown that the extraction rate of the skater region was almost 90%, and tracking with camera control was successfully done for almost all of the cases used here.\n\nInjuries in synchronized skating.\n\nPubMed\n\nDubravcic-Simunjak, S; Kuipers, H; Moran, J; Simunjak, B; Pecina, M\n\n2006-06-01\n\nSynchronized skating is a relatively new competitive sport and data about injuries in this discipline are lacking. Therefore the purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency and pattern of acute and overuse injuries in synchronized skaters. Before and during the World Synchronized Skating Championship 2004, a questionnaire inquiring about the frequency of injuries in this skating discipline was given to 23 participating teams. A total of 514 women and 14 men senior skaters completed the questionnaires (100 % response). Two hundred and eighteen (42.4 %) female and 6 (42.9 %) male skaters had suffered from acute injuries during their synchronized skating career. As some skaters had suffered from more than one injury, the total number of acute injuries in females was 398 and in males 14. In female skaters 19.8 % of acute injuries were head injuries, 7.1 % trunk, 33.2 % upper, and 39.9 % lower extremity injuries. In male skaters 14.3 % were head injuries, 28.6 % upper, and 57.1 % lower extremity injuries, with no report of trunk injuries. Sixty-nine female and 2 male skaters had low back problems and 112 female and 2 male skaters had one or more overuse syndromes during their skating career. Of 155 overuse injuries in female skaters, 102 (65.8 %) occurred during their figure skating career, while 53 injuries (34.2 %) only occurred when they skated in synchronized skating teams. In male skaters, out of 5 overuse injuries, 4 (80 %) occurred in their figure skating career, while 1 (20 %) occurred during their synchronized skating career. Out of the total of 412 injuries, 338 (82 %) occurred during on-ice practice, while 74 (18 %) happened during off-ice training. Ninety-one (26.9 %) acute injures occurred while practicing individual elements, and 247 (73.1 %) on-ice injuries occurred while practicing different team elements. We conclude that injuries in synchronized skating should be of medical concern due to an increasing number of acute injuries, especially\n\nEffects of a recreational ice skating program on the functional mobility of a child with cerebral palsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalsh, Sharon Fleming; Scharf, Michael G\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the effects of an ice skating program on the ambulation, strength, posture and balance of a child with cerebral palsy (CP). The subject was a five-year-old female with a diagnosis of CP and a Gross Motor Classification System level of III. The subject was a slow and labored household ambulator on level surfaces with bilateral forearm crutches and bilateral ankle foot orthoses. She was unable to transfer to and from the floor to stand independently, stand unsupported or take steps independently. Until the initiation of this study she was receiving physical therapy services 2Ã/week. For the purpose of this study she participated in a 1âh/week local ice skating program for people with disabilities for a period of four months. The subject displayed clinically significant improvements in functional mobility including: improved standing posture; independent transfer to and from the floor to stand; maintenance of independent standing for 3âmin; independent walking for 10âfeet; increased ability to isolate extremity musculature; increased strength; improved Gross Motor Function Measure-88 scores and increased endurance. A subsequent testing session four months after the ice skating program had ended displayed declines but not to pre-intervention levels in muscle strength; ability to transfer to and from the floor to stand; functional mobility and standing balance. The results appear to suggest that the participation in an ice skating program clinically improved this child's functional mobility. Further research needs to be done with regard to physical recreational programs and the benefit they can have on the function of children with activity limitations.\n\nBody movements during the off-ice execution of back spins in figure skating.\n\nPubMed\n\nMapelli, Andrea; Rodano, Renato; Fiorentini, Angelo; Giustolisi, Andrea; Sidequersky, Fernanda V; Sforza, Chiarella\n\n2013-10-01\n\nUsing an optoelectronic motion capture system, we quantitatively assessed the arrangement of body segments and the displacement of the horizontal projection of the center of mass (CM) in seven skaters performing off-ice back spins on a rotating device (spinner). The position of the CM at the beginning of the spins was not a determining factor, but its rapid stabilization towards the center of the spinner, together with the achievement of a stable arrangement of trunk and limbs, was crucial to get the dynamic equilibrium, necessary for a lasting performance. At full spinning, however, there was an indicative variety of individual body postures. A final decelerati"
