        "text": "Do the exact opposite of this! üòÇ Hit SAVE so you can revisit this later ‚úÖ If you want to get the most out of your brass samples then follow these 5 steps: 1. Get to know the instrument‚Äôs uses and ranges - do this to better understand how when they sound their best 2. Layer articulations - especially a staccato patch with a legato to give it more attack 3. Use OTT or similar - to really bring out that delicious raspy sound 4. Use the mod wheel - to give your brass a human feeling and give it expression 5. Layer libraries - there are loads of libraries that all sound slightly different, you will get really great-sounding brass if you mix them together. #brasssamples #musicproduction #composer\n\nWhat do you do when the path you‚Äôre trying to blaze slows, or even stalls? I‚Äôm trying a new exercise. I love to write. Creating a world, bringing characters to life, or even just getting a joke out of my head. Putting pen to paper is the best! However, with some perfectionist tendencies (which I‚Äôm working to overcome) the process for me can be slooooooow. Really looking forward to what I can learn from Viki King! Going to spend the next few weeks diving into this, then put it in practice starting Sept 1. Anyone want to join?

One of the things I love about drums is that one change to your setup could impact in feel and sound. A bass drum beater is one of those changes that doesn‚Äôt seem like a nig one but delivers a significant impact! For this comparison, I played the same groove for both examples to provide the best one-to-one comparison. With the weight of the beaters, both felt pretty equal, with the very slight advantage going to the felt beater. Surprisingly these two bass drum beaters didn‚Äôt feel different to play ‚Äî making this comparison very even. What surprised me was what I heard from the two beaters while editing this video. To me, I got a sharper attack from the felt beater and a beefier punch from the wooden beater. This result tends to go against the idea that one would get more attack when using a wooden beater and a punchier sound from the felt. I think the construction of these beaters played a role in the sonic result. Sooooooo, What do you guys think? Do you have a difference between the two? Which bass drum beater would you personally pick? Leave a comment. Let‚Äôs talk about it! PS: A lot of what I said is an option that I have tested over the past four years. I just wanted to be honest with you guys. That way, you know what you are reading. I hope this information is helpful. Love you, guys!! Okay.

A little walk in the park where you can breeze through without breaking a sweat. But here‚Äôs the punchline: the joke's on you. This \"easy\" exam has a way of flipping the script, turning overconfident smiles into wide-eyed panic. Suddenly, what seemed like a harmless quiz feels more like a pop quiz on rocket science. It‚Äôs like showing up for a comedy show only to realize you‚Äôre the main act‚Äîwith no script. So, maybe the real joke is thinking you can skip preparation. Because when it‚Äôs time to deliver, the CES-WE doesn‚Äôt laugh‚Äîit tests. LEARN MORE: https://lnkd.in/eMr7nq6q"
