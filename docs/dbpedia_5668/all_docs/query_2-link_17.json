        "text": "BOOK LAUNCH. WHOOP! I’m doing a book launch of my book on voiceovers/acting ‘Go Quicker Sound Slower’ on Sunday 4th Aug at 4.00 at The Troubadour in Earl’s Court 265 Old Brompton Road It’s £12.50 which includes a copy of the book which is in diary form and takes place over three months in 2006 (is). It’s supposed to be funny! There’ll be a few vids of my career a few bits of the book being read and a few songs from the Rudy Vees. Tickets can be bought on Eventbrite. https://lnkd.in/epv68Yh8\n\nWas delighted to be at the Talking Pictures TV convention on Sunday being interviewed by the excellent Andre Vincent about my time as one of the presenters of the classic Kid’s TV show ‘Pipkins’. Nigel Plaskitt who voiced and operated the iconic Hartley Hare in the series - as well as Tortoise and Mooney the Badger - was with me on stage in front of 1000 people at the St Albans Arena. Hugely enjoyable with Nigel on top form. For homework I watched about 20 episodes. I’d forgotten what a brilliant series this was. Here’s a pic. That’s me in the middle.\n\nFabulous night at the British Animation Awards with a fine crew from Harvey Voices and several terrific guests. Every animation that makes the short list (and I’m sure some of the long list ones) is exceptional and I left wanting to watch all of them not just the brief segment we saw before the prizes were awarded. So hats off to Emma Harvey, Michelle Jones,Debra Wooton, Redd Pepper,and Gary Martin who were all on top form. And also special mention to all the brilliant team at Fuse, Tom at Tiger Aspect, the ever generous and sparkly Tim Searle, the lovely David Holt and the effervescent Lizzie Waterworth. Hugely enjoyable and what a superb body of work we viewed. Wow!\n\nDid a lot of characters on the new Mr Bean. Great fun. This cartoon is interesting voice acting as you have to externalise a lot of thoughts with a noise or improvised vocal. So if I bent over to tie my laces up I’d go ‘hip’ ‘hmm’ ‘herr’ ‘ah’ and they’d choose which noises to use if any. One of the characters I played was a waiter and I pause by the door with the food and Bean takes the plate away. So you’d so something like ‘oi’ ‘what?’ ‘Err?’ ‘come back you’ ‘err?’’ etc. I was also a track marshal at a motor bike race and Bean heads towards a closed gate on his bike and I quickly have to open it Consequently masses of panic ‘what? No! Not this way!’ Stop!’ And then ‘pushing noises’ as I open the gate ‘errrrrr…errr errr…ahhh’ and do it in time so he doesn’t crash ‘ phew!’ Etc"
