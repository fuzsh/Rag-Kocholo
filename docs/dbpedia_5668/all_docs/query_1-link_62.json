        "text": "for SSAATTBB unaccompanied\n\nThe weather, the most quintessentially English of topics, was the inspiration for this work. Chilcott weaves together a tapestry of well-known weather rhymes, such as 'The rain it raineth every day upon the just and the unjust fella', and 'Whether the weather', in a work that is energetic, quirky, and entertaining. His choral writing is inventive and full of character, using layered rhythms and jazzy harmonies. This will be a fun piece to perform, and perfect as a light addition to any concert programme.\n\nComposer : CHILCOTT, Bob (UK 1955-)\n\nPublisher : Oxford University Press\n\nPanamusicacode : GC2725\n\nSSAATTBB a cappella\n\nText : English\n\nDuration : 5'00\"\n\nView product details or purchase\n\nfor SATB a cappella\n\nThe texts were taken from the unique bilingual quatrains by Hajime Kijima.\n\nAll the songs are composed both in Japanese and English.
