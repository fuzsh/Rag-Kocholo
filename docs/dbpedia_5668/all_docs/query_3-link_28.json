That has led her to engage with the political and social histories of Eastern Europe and America – most often in the context of female perspectives and narratives – and to investigate how they feel in the present by revisiting them through her work. Her new show ‘Squelchy Garden Mules and Mamunas’ recasts her interests in the context of natural landscapes and Slavic myths. It incorporates work developed for her major solo show ‘Her Hauntology’ at Kistefos Museum in Norway, and fills the whole of Pace’s extensive London gallery until January 6.\n\nYou show five videos of ‘Mamunas’ and ‘Garden Mules’? What are they?\n\nA mamuna, literally translated from Polish as strangewife, is a female swamp demon closely associated with rivers, streams, and thickets. They appear in various forms in folk stories across the Slavic region, and contrast interestingly with the mythologies of Christianity which we all know. The ‘Garden Mule’ is the white little boy with horns: that name came out of my discussions with curator Kate Smith when we were filming in Norway. After telling her what mamunas are, I said: ‘let’s make up some other names of deities from the forest’, and she suggested ‘garden mules’ – it sounded good and I like it that the mule lives between animals, being half-horse, half-donkey, so it’s a metaphorical title.\n\nPaulina Olowska: detail from ‘Squelchy Garden Mules and Mamunas’, 2023 – five channel framed video installation, dimensions variable\n\nSo we have four mamunas and the garden mule. How have you presented them?\n\nMaking a show in the middle of the woods in Norway, was as inspiring as running a foundation (Artist House Kadenówka Foundation) in the middle of the countryside in Poland. Both are surprising and unexpected locations to present contemporary art. To amplify the spirit of the Museum in Norway, in what is called ‘The Twist’ – a twisted building over a river – I decided to add more fake trees inside and place the Mamunas videos in the hollows of them. At Pace they are on screens set in carved frames like woodland hollows. I love making amplifications of spaces, as in the performance The Mother in Tate Modern in 2015, where I created set of a Huculian hut with paintings by Pablo Picasso , Meredith Frampton and Henri Matisse.\n\nPaulina Olowska: ‘Dziewannas (After Branislav Šimončík)’, 2023 – oil on canvas, 310 x 209 cm\n\nSeveral large paintings feature the same cast, but others – such as ‘Dziewannas (After Branislav Šimončík)’ don’t. Why is that?\n\nMost of the works come from my photoshoot and films made in Norway, but I wanted to take this show beyond just those ideas. So others, like Cepelia, Dziewannas or Glisne are paintings based on found photography that I reappropriated with a more personal narratives. For example I found these amazing portraits of a young androgynist couple on an oak tree in recent Vogue Czech shoot by Bransilav Simoncik. I present them as Dziewannas, the wood demons, as archers guarding the forest – the arrows are my addition.\n\nYou show your studies for the costumes in which the mamunas performed, and also puppets wearing the costumes. I guess that fits in with your long-standing interest in fashion?\n\nYes, I love to connect art with fashion, and for two years I worked as artistic director of Polish Art Vogue: I did photoshoots, met models, saw the industry. A lot of my work comes with the belief that fashion is a metaphor for personal and social revolution. Pose and hair style become symbolic. And the parallels and differences from art were fascinating for me. Fashion deals with theatricality through colour, form, space, people… I started to look at fashion photographer’s portfolios and find the images which resonate with me. I often create outfits for my models, as in the downstairs space of Pace, where I include the outfits from the photo session in Norway.\n\nPaulina Olowska: detail from ‘Squelchy Garden Mules and Mamunas’, 2023 – five channel framed video installation, dimensions variable\n\nWho are the mamunas?\n\nMine are mystic creative professionals (laughs)… While at Vogue I met a lot of incredible people working in fashion. One of them was Lou, from ‘Let it go’ agency in Amsterdam. Lou was managing talents such as Amy Morgan, Rick Geene, Sayuri Chetty, Kamil Sznajder and Yasmin El Yassini…. They are my muses – my mamunas and mules. They’re all in their twenties, they do part time studying while modelling or being actors or musicians. Filming them was great fun.\n\nThey seem more mischievous than demonic?\n\nOne thing about demons is that we’re scared of them, and their power, so if they’re too friendly it’s not good! But what is true about Slavic goddesses – as well as Hindu goddesses – is that they have their yin / yang virtues, their either / or, the friendly side covering the more evil side.\n\nPaulina Olowska: ‘Strzygla with Mamunas’, 2023 – oil on canvas, 260 x 333 cm\n\nHow were the paintings of the five characters – such as ‘Strzygla with Mamunas’ – made?\n\nThe idea was we met to make films in the tree hollows, but I grabbed Kacper Kasprzyk, the photographer, and Monika Kucel, who helped me make the outfits, and we had a photoshoot day outside. We did plein air photos, middle of the winter with Mamunas exploring the rivers and forests of Jevneker village in Norway. It was spontaneous – and I’ve found that spontaneity works well for me. I was looking at them throughout the year, left them on my studio wall, I thought ‘they are excellent, I want to make paintings from them’. Then I took the time to explore in my painterly head how to work with paint gesture and weave in the painting the expression of nature. And I liked the connection with how back in the day painters had an entourage – models, assistants, students – always this aspect of the artist being present with others – now I feel painters are more solo in the studio, so the idea of recreating images from my tableaus was special. And the mamunas have come to the openings…\n\nWhy not show the photographs?\n\nPerhaps I will get there, I am interested in exploring the language of photography, but at the moment when I reflect on the photographs, I feel a desire to transform them into a deeper visual language, echoing the moment. Photography is a split second while painting is a duration, a constant re-entrance into the scene, a mind game, a kind of head projection combined with the alchemy of the process. A painting emerges from months of being with the image in the studio – I really like painting as a method of mediation. My aim is to achieve what Bernard Frize, one of my teachers, called the ‘economy of painting’ – how to represent an image with the most persuasion in the gesture. In this show, inspired by Norway and seeing the divine nature painting in its new National Museum, there is a new direction for me in the representation of nature. I like to have question in mind when I make a show, and here it was not so much Slavic folk art as ‘how do we represent the landscape as a painter?’ And so with every image I moved between different approaches and techniques.\n\nYour previous work has often reinterpreted historic female muses for modern times, and you’ve spoken about how the past haunts the present. Could you say something about that and how it applies in this show?\n\nHere I’m looking to research the missing links to modernity not through historic muses, but through folk art. That’s an alternative setting for the theory which dear Mark Fisher developed to apply to music, in which elements from the past persist in the manner of a ghost. His approach made sense of my take on feminism – can you make a new future for feminism through figures from history coming back to you, by re-envisaging them for what they can give us now? That’s why my book of the Norwegian show is called ‘Her Hauntology’ – as it’s my take on it.\n\nTop Photo: Paulina Olowska: ‘Squelchy Garden Mules and Mamunas’ Costumes’, 2023 – costumes, wigs and mannequins – dimensions variable\n\nPaulina Olowska: ‘Squelchy Garden Mules and Mamunas’ runs Nov 22, 2023 – Jan 6, 2024 at Pace Gallery, 5 Hanover Square, London\n\nShirin Neshat: Interview of the Month, Oct 2023 – Paul Carey-Kent\n\nI talked to New York based Iranian artist Shirin Neshat in her current show at Goodman Gallery, which presents an immersive video installation and a series of nude portraits considering the female body both as an object of desire and as an object of violence and shame. In the chilling 15-minute double-screen film work ‘The Fury’, Neshat’s protagonist dances seductively for a room of impassive soldiers. Then we see bruises on her body, indicating the abuse she has suffered, followed by her emergence onto the streets of Brooklyn. Physically displaced and mentally disturbed, she walks the streets reliving the horrors of her past. From the street’s vantage point, she is one among many in her cocoon, alienated and atomised. Yet, at the film’s conclusion, she sparks a mini-revolution as women throw trash into the air and dance wildly.\n\nHow did ‘The Fury’ come about?\n\nFor some reason, I got drawn into following the trial of the notorious prosecutor Hamid Nouri, who was captured by luck in Sweden by the international court. He was among those responsible for the massacre of nearly 3,000 young political prisoners in Iran. The victims’ families, who are now living outside, came to give testimonies. What struck me the most was how the regime would rape the young women before execution because, according to Islamic laws, virgins cannot be executed. I couldn’t stop thinking about these incredibly horrifying reports. I’ve also known several Iranian women who have spent time in prison and heard their stories about women who are sexually assaulted in prison and how they could never recover. They would often sit in a corner, wouldn’t speak, and many would commit suicide after they were freed. So, the concept of “The Fury” developed during 2021-2022, and I shot the video in June of 2022 before the Woman Life Freedom movement in Iran. In this highly fictionalised and stylised narrative, the female protagonist cannot disconnect from her haunted past and her psychological trauma, even in the state of freedom in a new country. I wanted to make a work which draws this boundary between the interior of her mind, the exterior of her mind, the interior of her apartment, the public space – and how everything was disconnected – like she wasn’t present till the end until she was most vulnerable and asked for help. So everything was created around the notions of sanity/insanity, illusion/reality, interior/exterior, Iran/USA.\n\nAnd the setting is personal to you?\n\nThis video was shot where I live, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, a working-class, primarily Hispanic community. Most of the neighbourhood barely speaks English, yet these are the people I am closest to and see more than anyone else. They are my community in New York, even if we all come from different cultures and religions and speak other languages. I feel safe and at home here.\n\nIs the woman based on an actual person?\n\nNo, she’s a fictionalised character I created and is not merely meant to represent a female political prisoner in Iran but to capture some of the trauma and dichotomies experienced universally under such conditions.\n\nYou use a double-channel video. What is the advantage of that?\n\nThis video wasn’t designed initially in two channels; I decided on that later. Everything became about creating two different points of view and putting the audience in an uncomfortable position. So, in a way, the audience becomes the editor, deciding where to look and how to put the story together. I wanted the audience to distinguish between the way she viewed the world and the way the street bystanders and the uniformed men viewed her.\n\nShe begins in a seductive manner. Why is that?\n\nThere is a development in this short narrative. First, the female protagonist appears as an object of desire through her erotic dance, and then slowly, we reveal the brutality of what has happened to her. She’s at first seductive because that’s often the story of women: we have the power to seduce and create temptation, yet due to the same reason, we can fall victim to violence. This subject is not exclusive to Iranian women, of course – I am a firm believer that most women around the globe have experienced some form of sexual assault or molestation at some point in their lives, but they don’t talk about it. We tend to internalise such experiences and even become ashamed of ourselves and our bodies.\n\nAnd that’s picked up in the poems on the photographs in the show?\n\nYes, the poems I transcribed on the surface of the photographs are from ‘Another Birth’ by Forugh Farrokhzad, who died in 1967 at the age of 33. I have often used her poetry in my photographs. She was one of the most radical among Iranian women poets in how she expressed the problematics of the female body in relation to traditional and religious values – taboos. Her poems have often been considered blasphemous, and at some point, her books were banned in Iran. I remember one of her poems. I believe it was called ‘Face to Face with God’; she poses the question to God: if you are the creator, why am I supposed to feel so much shame about a body that you’ve given me?\n\nUnusually for your work, both the film and the photographs feature women naked or near-naked. Why is that?\n\nI couldn’t imagine the depiction of sexual exploitation without showing the naked flesh of a woman in “The Fury.” In the video, it was necessary for me to show both the seductive and yet brutalised body of a captured woman. In the photographs, I tried to take a similar approach. Some images resonated with notions of power, pride, dignity and beauty regardless of the women’s size and age – and in other images, we are faced with women in pain whose bodies have obviously been brutalised.\n\nWhat led to how do you show the men?\n\nThe men’s gazes expressed everything: the sense of hate and violence. I didn’t need to show them doing anything to her; their bodies and uniforms represented their power and control over her. The interesting thing is that their blank expressions never changed from the time she dances seductively to when she finally fell to the floor bruised. They remained emotionless, which is so typical of men who are incapable of humanity-only atrocities. I hate to say it, but some people enjoy other people’s suffering. I’m an optimist and would like to think there is a good side to every person, but you just have to look at the last few days in the Middle East to see how hatred, violence and evil are so deeply ingrained in people. When she’s on the floor struggling, you see the men looking at her as if they enjoy it. Lastly, I was careful to make the uniforms generic and not specific to any culture.\n\nWhy is the whole show in black and white?\n\nInitially, we shot the video in colour, but later, I changed my mind. I think there is a severity in black and white that felt right to my narrative. Also, we occasionally used Infrared with the camera, which turns everything into negative, and that was used each time we went to her point of view on the streets. Overall, I felt that the black-and-white look also helped with the melancholic mood of the story. I slowed down music – a Persian song with lyrics rewritten in Arabic – to make it more melancholic but also beautiful. That goes back to the mysticism in Iran – things are terribly sad and emotional but highly beautiful and affecting.\n\nYou made the film before Masa Amini was killed, yet there are echoes?\n\nIt’s almost uncanny how the story of “The Fury” is similar to what transpired in Iran a few months later. Here, we have a woman who becomes a victim. Her victimisation unleashes other people’s rage, which culminates in a protest, and that is exactly what happened in Iran: a revolution unravelled immediately after the murder of an innocent woman, Mahsa Amini, who became the victim of the Iranian government.\n\nDance is important in the film?\n\nYes, dance is central to the film, both as the female protagonist danced for the uniformed men and how, in the street, bystanders turned their protest into a strange ritual of dance and destruction. Oddly enough, during the Woman, Life, Freedom revolution in Iran, dance, which is forbidden in public, became an expression of protest as well.\n\nTop Photo Shirin Neshat: The Fury – installation view, courtesy Goodman Gallery\n\nShirin Neshat’s ‘The Fury’ runs to 4 November at Goodman Gallery, 26 Cork Street, London W1S 3ND\n\nGhislaine Leung: Interview of the Month November 2023 – Paul Carey-Kent\n\nGhislaine Leung is one of the four artists nominated for this year’s Turner Prize, the winner of which will be announced on 5 December.\n\nHer show in Eastbourne consists of ‘score-based’ works: they repurpose found objects, but Leung’s parameters for how to show them leave plenty of scope for the hosting Towner Gallery to influence the outcome. That relinquishing of control allow the socio-political and spatial conditions of art production, its presentation and re-presentation, to come to the fore. That may sound worthy but potentially dry – yet Leung goes about things with an appealing wit, and the results are compelling in themselves.\n\nAs explained in detail in your recent book ‘Bosses’, your starting point is how to make work rather than what work to make?\n\nYes, I aim to work with what I have, rather than what I don’t have – it’s untenable trying to work with what you don’t have, which is the position faced by many artists who can’t access the resources they need – which, of course, also exacerbates existing class, gender and racial hierarchies in our industry. I was interested in finding a mode of production that made space for a different kind of work. And this came from something I probably initially conceived of as a problem, I always thought you can make an artwork and you can perfect it in some way yourself. And then the work goes into a context that you can’t control and it has a different read or it changes or it shifts, and this was something I wanted to control. It was the wish to control that seemed like a clear problem to me. I wondered how to embrace the contingency of works instead, to embrace their vulnerability. Rather than thinking ‘how can I fix and control this? How can I maintain its integrity in the way that I have conceived it?’ I shifted to thinking that the resilience of the work could come from its vulnerability, its total contingency, its complete dependency, my trust in a situation.\n\nIs that in line with Sol LeWitt’s approach as set out in ‘Sentences on Conceptual Art’, 1969, such as ‘Once the idea of the piece is established in the artist’s mind and the final form is decided, the process is carried out blindly’?\n\nI’d see my work as more of a dialectical flip on LeWitt’s methodology. He starts with concepts which lead to the material form. For me, materials, inclusive of the sets of conditions and limitations I’m working with, are generative towards concepts. I don’t know the final form, and – given the highly contingent nature of the scores – I can’t and, in fact, don’t want to. This is why the works are scores rather than instructions, just as a musical performance isn’t quite the composer’s or the performer’s. In that sense, I am theoretically the composer, and the institution is the performer, and the work, in each iteration, comes from both. I like to be surprised by my work when I come into a show!\n\nGhislaine Leung: ‘Violets 2’, as installed at Simian, Copenhagen – GRAYSC Images, courtesy the artist & Simian\n\nCan you say something about the largest work in your Turner Prize display?\n\nThe score for ‘Violets 2’ reads: ‘All parts of a ventilation system removed from Netwerk Aalst Bar during its 2017 refurbishment are reinstalled within the space of the exhibition and fixed on the floor. Using as much of the material as possible while keeping it all interconnecting. Spare pieces that do not fit this configuration are bracketed together in smaller formations. A welcome sign is installed.’\n\nI was working there in Belgium from 2017-19, and we were thinking about who the institution was speaking to – about how often ‘the public’ is referred to like a separate and somewhat mysterious entity to be spoken to or placated. I was aiming to bridge this externality by thinking about the internality – the politics of the institution and my position in that – an immanent form of critique looking at the structures of power inside, rather than outside, the place. What about the people already in this room, the politics that are already here? So how the institution was organised in both social and physical structures. So many of the circuits of power, the things that allow for the functionality of the building, are rendered invisible. At the time, the institution was undergoing a renovation and discussing what was going to be removed and what was going to be inserted. The ventilation system that makes up ‘Violets 2’ was going to be removed as smoking was no longer allowed in the building, which made it surplus. And I was interested in what these forms of institutional waste were, who and what was considered valid or useful within these public-facing spaces. I took the ventilation system which had been on the ceiling of the bar, and mounted it on the floor of the gallery space above that bar, which had the same spatial footprint. And installed a welcome sign alongside it. I’m always interested in this institutional welcome, on who is being welcomed and why, especially in how ex-industrial spaces become art industrial spaces. Violets 2 has been on almost permanent tour since 2018, it flexes to fit into different spaces, and it shows something different about these spaces each time, as its parameters are shaped by these limits.\n\nGhislaine Leung: ‘Violets 2’, Towner Gallery, Eastbourne – Angus Mill Photography\n\nYou’re asking one institution to do something with another institution’s structures?\n\nThe way an institution performs a score says a lot about them, e.g. their Health and safety rules, what they want to achieve – that was my aim at that time, to acknowledge the systems of the institutions.\n\nThe sculpture we see reminded me somewhat of the 1960s ‘Square Tubes’ of Charlotte Poseneske – another artist who emphasised the cooperative aspects of her work.\n\nYes, and I think this is exactly what I mean about how materials can be generative. This becomes especially interesting in relation to historical artworks that refer or even enact forms of industrial production like Poseneske’s. What happens if you use existing industrial objects rather than fabricating them? What shifts what doesn’t? In a way, I’m trying to take something back into the use of art and to understand that as already an industrialised social structure, one that is often unacknowledged but shapes so much of what constitutes not only the art object but who can and can continue to, make art.\n\nWhy does the title refer to violets?\n\nI had been thinking about how systemic prejudices are so often perpetuated by our own internalised ‘micro-violences’ that we do to each other and also ourselves. Ones that are fabricated into the internal structures of our institutions. And was struck by how close the pretty and flowery word ‘violets’ is to the loaded term ‘violence’.\n\nGhislaine Leung: ‘Hours’, 2022 – photo Paul Carey-Kent\n\n‘Monitors’ broadcasts a baby monitor from one room to another, and ‘Hours’ divides the week between your studio hours, indicated by a Malevich-like black square, and the rest. I note you spend only 8% of your time in the studio – presumably, you’re constrained by factors such as being a mother?\n\nYes, being a mother, and working, and in multiple jobs. I think the earlier works like ‘Violets 2’ and ‘Public Sculpture’ were very much about institutional systems, and how they constitute the work, what their labour conditions are, how they work. In the past few years, especially since having a child, I’ve become more and more interested in how I work, how I have internalised various expectations and ideas about labour and value; questions that are about how I institute, and taking a position of critique into a more reflexive and lived form of actionism. As such the more recent scores have become less about the interrelation between two institutions, and more about my form of instituting, how my labour, life, limits, collide, are in conflict or grow… about that intra-institutional aspect of bringing myself in. For many years I felt I couldn’t do that, felt that how I lived didn’t have enough value to speak about, but more and more I feel that speaking about that situation is a necessity. And if you’re trying to make work inclusive, then life is really important within the work.\n\nGhislaine Leung: ‘Public Sculpture’, 2018 – Photo: Paul Carey-Kent\n\n‘Public Sculpture’ presents a group of toys from the collection of the public library in Reading. They struck me as unusual toys?\n\nThey are fascinating, yes. Toy libraries often have a lot of these kind of role play toys, leading to questions about what roles we play, or the roles played in the construction of such roles. And there are two companies – Theo Klein in Germany and Casdon in the UK – who specialise in miniatures of branded goods, so you’ll get a Theo Klein Miele washing machine or a Casdon Henry Hoover etc.… I was interested in that double identity – in that one object has two brands attached. And the toys have another double identity: as individual objects they are toys in the library; as a set of objects, they are a loanable artwork by me. Both exist in the library system, and you have to join the library to access them, either way. So I’m interested in how the work circulates as well as how it is actioned through the score. And this doubling – or troubling – of identity is important to me, as a mother and an artist, as someone with a father from Hong Kong and a mother from London. I’m asking what identity is if you think of it as not so much as the objectifying question of ‘what you are’, but ‘how you are’.\n\nWork by the four artists shortlisted for the Turner Prize 2023 (Jesse Darling, Ghislaine Leung, Rory Pilgrim and Barbara Walker) is on show at the Towner Gallery, Eastbourne to 14 April 2024.

And ‘Appearance’, 2023, is a silent ‘filmic portrait’ featuring 15 female judges. All three films, says Young, try to reverse ‘the male gaze’ by playing with some idea of a female gaze. And all three act as ‘thought experiments’: speculative fictions which turn documentary footage into the imagined future of a female world.\n\nCarey Young: still from Appearance, 2023. © Carey Young. Courtesy of the artist and Paula Cooper Gallery, New York\n\nWhat themes are you tackling in the show?\n\nThere are two main themes. The first is around my engagement – for over twenty years now – with law. The show includes many new pieces and traces a line through my law-based work … I’m interested in law as artistic medium and as a form of power in society. What is law? What are its aesthetics? Who gets to administer it? What are law’s performances, rituals, languages, materiality and what is its effect on us? These are questions which fascinate me, and I keep going back to them.\n\nThe other theme, equally pressing to me but more recently as a particular interest, is in women, and especially women’s relationship to cameras and to the regimes of cinema and photography, including in the social media era. I’m thinking about power in that sense, too.\n\nThose themes relate to each other in different ways throughout the show. I wanted to create a triangular relationship between the overlapping themes of ‘Palais de Justice’, ‘The Vision Machine’, and ‘Appearance’. Then I added photographic and text works in the central space, which push the themes in other related directions. I wanted those works to have a sense of realism. They relate to contracts, prisons, land, Brexit – things we can recognise as being about law and the body, borders, transitions, something being at stake.\n\nWhat proportion of court judges in Britain are women?\n\nI only have figures for England and Wales, as that is one jurisdiction, and Scotland is another. At the moment, 35% are female, which is 10% more than a decade ago. In proportional terms, most women judges work in the lower courts, and only one on the highest court, the UK Supreme Court, so that is another imbalance. There also needs to be much more done to recruit more ethnically diverse judges, who account for 4% of court judges (and 9% if we also count male judges), as of 2022 figures, but are 18% of the UK population. And only 1% of judges are from black backgrounds – a figure that has not changed since 2014 (although some of the UK’s most senior non-white judges feature in Appearance). Efforts are being made to diversify the judiciary further but it is a slow process.\n\nAppearance features judges who are diverse in age, seniority and ethnicity. I wanted to defy the stereotype – which is backed up by ongoing statistics – that judges are older white men. Here, the judges are a wide mix of women, from the youngest ever female judge (even six years on, she is only 37), to judges of various non-white ethnicities, to the UK’s only trans female judge, or the only female judge on the UK’s Supreme Court. Many went to state school. They are all trailblazers in one way or another, showing a future of the judiciary that better represents the UK population.\n\nCarey Young: still from Appearance, 2023. © Carey Young. Courtesy the artist and Paula Cooper Gallery, New York\n\nWhat guidance did you give the judges in ‘Appearance’?\n\nThey appear as they wish: all are wearing their real robes and their choice of shoes and jewellery; they could choose their make-up and how their hair was done. They could act as they wanted to on camera, although I did ask them to sit in a judge’s chair placed in the centre of the film studio, and if they were going to look at the camera, they should make eye contact with it. It wasn’t at all like acting – they could have any expression on their face, as they wished – they were conveying their own feelings. This resulted in a wide variety of expressions, from cool toughness to warmth, benevolence or self-consciousness. They remain enigmatic, though because they don’t speak. Most said the experience reminded them of being in court because they were surrounded by crew all facing them with rapt attention, which led to several of them replaying trials in their heads, which is visually very interesting on camera because the judges change expression throughout their takes. One of them – a very senior judge – decided to bow to the camera as she entered and exited the shot because she would bow to the court. It’s very surprising because she wears a gold-encrusted robe and is clearly very powerful, but those bows reverse that power, just for a moment.\n\nBut you did ask them not to wear wigs?\n\nI wanted the work to be international, and judges outside the UK and Commonwealth don’t wear wigs. Also, I think the wigs look anachronistic. The judges defend them as a disguise: because they are vulnerable to possible retribution when they leave court, they cherish the anonymity provided by wig and robe. The piece hovers between this idea of the official identity of the judge and their personal aspects of self-expression – their subjectivity – which you see through close-ups: shoes, eyes, hair, earrings, glasses, even bat-shaped cufflinks. This conveys their individuality and humanity, as well as differences between them. The judges were happy with the idea that Appearance is about them as people as well as in their roles. I hope viewers will have the strange experience of feeling, as I did, slightly guilty watching the footage, as if they are facing each judge in court. That’s why I made it a single-screen work. By giving such a direct, frontal encounter with the judiciary, the work effectively puts the viewer ‘in the dock’. Along with Velasquez’ Pope Innocent X, Warhol’s ‘Screen Tests’ were an initial inspiration. It was an added extra – though I only found out later – that Warhol was originally inspired by the ‘Most Wanted’ ads of the New York Police Dept.\n\nCarey Young: still from Appearance, 2023. © Carey Young. Courtesy of the artist and Paula Cooper Gallery, New York\n\nThe title suggests that appearance matters?\n\nJudges rely on their robes to help them seem an anonymous and objective manifestation of ‘the law’. The title also relates to the idea – which persists, in which we’re indoctrinated – of judging women on their appearance. And it also refers to appearing – being formally summoned in person – at court. The appearance of law fascinates me for what it says about what law is. How a courtroom looks, sounds or even smells is very evocative. Such sensory experiences are often what we’ll remember most about a place. The aesthetics of law go far beyond black type on white paper. The more we examine this, the more we can understand the aesthetic vocabulary of how the state manifests its power.\n\nHow does the law need to improve?\n\nThe law claims to be neutral, but it really isn’t, especially in how it’s applied and in terms of who has power in it currently. In terms of the tenets the law holds dear, the scales of justice are balanced, justice is blind, and we’re all supposedly equal under the law – but we know that isn’t the case. Most people can’t afford legal representation; women are not believed by police or when they testify in court; racial bias abounds in policing and the legal system; and most judges are privileged older white men who don’t understand many societal issues. So, the quality of judging will be open to question until this is fully addressed. And legal language is so abstruse people can’t understand it without a lawyer, who of course, is unaffordable… So, part of my interest in law is a political one, of helping people to engage with and understand it as a system and a phenomenon and to emphasise that it belongs to us. We could change it. And we need to understand its power – it remains one of the few options to rein in corporate power.\n\nWhat do the judges make of ‘Appearance’?\n\nThey trusted me and were happy not to see the footage before the work was exhibited. Some came to the exhibition opening. So far, they’ve been thrilled by all the sections that aren’t about them – and steel themselves for seeing themselves on screen, like most of us would. I’m looking forward to more discussions with them, such as at the public symposium at Modern Art Oxford on May 19th, at which a panel of participating judges will discuss the work with me.\n\nCarey Young: still from The Vision Machine, 2020. © Carey Young. Courtesy of the artist and Paula Cooper Gallery, New York\n\nYour speculative fiction in ‘The Vision Machine’ is that women are running the factory. How close is that to the true position?\n\nThere were a lot of male workers at the factory. I don’t think women have power positions in Japanese factories. SIGMA is a global corporation, but in essence, it is a family firm run by a man who inherited it from his father. But I don’t think that matters: I’m using the factory as a metaphor to talk about visual culture. What if women made tools that propagated an idea of female-centric visuality? What might that be?\n\nSo what the women are making is critical?\n\nYes… they are making lenses for photographic or cinema cameras, and I shot the piece with lenses made by those workers, so it’s a self-reflexive work about the act of making films. We also see the women testing lenses, so it’s about the means of production – in a Marxist sense – to make tools for vision. It’s also about paying respect to women as artists and as artisans: beyond the fact that women artists have long been sidelined or written out of art histories, the artistry and technical skill of women is another thing that’s completely side-lined. And that extends to how cameras and lenses are sold – the number of times I’ve been in a camera shop and the sales assistants have assumed that I must be an amateur because I’m a woman! That did help me when I was making ‘Palais de Justice’, though: I wasn’t authorised to shoot the footage, but I tended to get away with it because nobody thought I was a serious filmmaker – or even a filmmaker at all. They took me to be an assistant for someone else – presumably a male director. Being female was a kind of disguise.\n\nIs there anything about you that people tend to find surprising?\n\nI’m from that original house music generation and never stopped being into it, especially deep house and mellow techno. I don’t actually listen to anything else, and buy a lot of tracks online. In another life, I would have been a DJ.\n\nTop Photo: Carey Young: still from Palais de Justice, 2017. © Carey Young.

Here, a constellation of works is thematically connected around the so-called ‘Holy’ or ‘Divine’ frequency of 111Hz, which provides a sonic bathing experience that permeates the gallery spaces. They include explorations of drug-induced shamanic practices; a series of Solar Cell Circuit Compositions that act as scripts to the film; and glass chambers housing an ant colony and a fungal bed of organic matter, powered by halogen lamps that provide heat and light - not only to ensure the ecosystem’s survival but also to illuminate solar panels that activate sounds created by the ants’ movements. This rich content provided plenty for me to ask about…\n\nHaroon Mirza with ‘For(a)micarium’, 2023 - Photovoltaic panels, century stands, floodlights, bespoke loudspeakers, glass, heat matt, thermostat, plaster, bell jar and collected items -dimensions variable, © Haroon Mirza, Courtesy Lisson Gallery\n\nWhat connects these works?\n\nThe show is called ‘|||’, which could be Roman numerals or an indication of phasing – I like that ambiguity - but refers primarily to 111Hertz (Hz), an audio frequency I have been fascinated by for some years. Studies have shown that exposing people to light and sound in the range 110-112Hz can bring about strange neurological effects, most specifically reversing the functions between the left and right sides of the brain. I commissioned a bespoke Shruti box, tuned to 111Hz, and chose a Tibetan singing bowl, also at 111Hz, that together create a quasi-therapeutic sound that reverberates throughout the exhibition.\n\nSo people could be altered by the resonance as well as by the art?\n\nYes, though curiously it is quite a normal frequency. Standard western musical notation centres on 440Hz as middle A, meaning that 110Hz is two octaves down the scale and therefore only slightly different and within the human voice range, although it’s typically harder for a woman’s voice to extend that low.\n\nHaroon Mirza: Exhibition view of ‘The Ancients call it Ataraxia’, 2023 - Photovoltaic panels, aluminium profile, bespoke media device, electronics, DMX dimmer pack, wire, fixings, bespoke loudspeakers, bongo drums, hand crafted drum, Yew tree branch, floodlights, solenoid device - dimensions variable, © Haroon Mirza, Courtesy Lisson Gallery\n\nIn the main room you present ‘The Ancients call it Ataraxia’. That includes a dual video work in collaboration with filmmaker Helga Dóróthea Fannon in which mushrooms are collected and a tea ceremony is conducted. What are we seeing and hearing?\n\nThe installation has two films running simultaneously, each 15 minutes long, acting as both a meditation and a trip. You can switch between them, although I like the idea of people watching one screen at a time while maintaining the presence of the other. Solar panels – which also feature in the films - are triggered periodically by the soundtrack, and that in turn sets off an automated shamanic drum. ‘Ataraxia’ is a kind of un-word; it means ‘calming of the mind’ – rather like meditation – but is something we don’t experience much anymore, at least not in normal western life. ‘The Ancients call it’ brings in the history of shamans summoning spirits. The films are based on true life stories, including the murder of a shaman in the Amazonian basin, whose character is combined with another type of shaman in Siberia. There they work with amanita muscaria mushrooms, the equivalent to the better-known Amazonian tradition of using ayahuasca. It’s not the classic psychedelic magic mushroom psylocibin - linked to hallucinations - but the deliriant strain also known as Fly Agaric, which is associated with toxicity, dizziness, loss of coordination and the stimulation of dreams. I recently tried micro-dosing it and it induced vivid dreams. The Siberians often drink it boiled as tea, as seen in the tea ceremony captured in the film. The more extreme method is via reindeer, who eat the mushrooms as part of their diet – the mushroom has two components: muscimol and ibotenic acid – the muscimol is the active ingredient and the acid is toxic. But when it passes through the animal’s body it is purified, so drinking reindeer urine is also a known practice. But I haven’t tried that!\n\nDo you take a lot of drugs, rainbow urine aside?\n\nPeople often assume that I do, but no – I’m mostly just hanging out with my kids!\n\nHaroon Mirza ‘Light Work xlviii’, 2023 - COB LED tape, wire, aluminium, copper tape, PWM device - dimensions Variable, © Haroon Mirza, Courtesy Lisson Gallery\n\nThe second downstairs space contains two works inspired by your trip to the Arctic. Why is ‘Light Work xlviii’ on the floor?\n\nI showed similar works on the wall until recently, but the latest in LED lighting works just as well on the floor, and I like the way light is then cast onto the ceiling. The colours are set up to create white light: combining six parts red, two parts green, one part blue. You can see this on the ceiling, especially in the evening when it gets dark. The LEDs also oscillate at a frequency of 111Hz. The technology for LED lights is to scintillate light, and one frequency is as good as another for that – 111Hz is quite a slow frequency, a designer would probably use a higher one. There is also a nod to the minimalists here – LeWitt, Judd and in particular Fred Sandback; in my first show here at Lisson I recreated a Sandback piece in light. So the work is about light and formalism, and how in the Arctic Circle light plays such an important role in the culture, whether it’s 24 hour light in the summer or the different types of Aurora in the winter.\n\nHaroon Mirza: ‘After the Arctic Circle’, 2023 - Glacial erratic stone, polyurethane resin, silicone, CPB LED tape, twisted electrical cables, photovoltaic panel, pigment, copper tape, aluminium tape - dimensions variable, © Haroon Mirza, Courtesy Lisson Gallery\n\nWhat about the big rock tethered to a solar panel in ‘After the Arctic Circle’?\n\nThis is more about nature and the landscape. It’s a glacial erratic rock that travelled to Wales at some stage, so it’s a found object, which has moss on and an ammonite fossil visible. My intervention is to carve into the stone and put a light in there. What looks like string on the solar panel is actually electric cable. The panel provides the energy for the light on the rock, so if you stand in front of it, the light dims. The surface of the panel acts as an abstract painting, but references the Aurora lights. There are also parallels to be drawn with the Sisyphus myth.\n\nHaroon Mirza: ‘Illuminated Amanita Harvest (Solar Cell Circuit Composition 22)’, 2023 - Solar cells, Polyurethane resin, copper tape, electrical wire, magnet wire, LED tape, miniature painting by Brishna Amin Khan, cables on glass, anodised aluminium - 147 x 147 x 8 cm, © Haroon Mirza, Courtesy Lisson Gallery\n\nYou’re showing two miniature paintings. How do they fit in?\n\nThey are – very elaborate - story boards for the film: I commission paintings from Brishna Amin Khan, a miniaturist based in Lahore, by giving her the description of the scene to paint in her style. Then I illuminate them, not with the traditional gold leaf, but by using copper tape and solar cells in a circle to make a sort of halo. The energy is picked up from the lighting in the room. The solar cells are placed on the glass using resin, which seeps out and creates an aesthetic of its own.\n\nInstallation detail from ‘For(a)micarium’, 2023, © Haroon Mirza, Courtesy Lisson Gallery\n\n‘For(a)micarium’ centres on leafcutter ants. What are they doing?\n\nThey’re tending a fungus garden – the ants don’t actually eat the leaves: they take them back to the garden to feed the fungus, which they do eat. They are the only non-human farmers. I also supply sugar syrup, which is like crack to them. Ants are very interesting creatures: researchers talk about how an ant colony is a super-organism rather than being made up of individuals. So there’s always this tension between the whole and the individual, which you can read across to human societies, too. Ants are very simple, with a tiny amount of neurons, but they do incredibly complex things. When people talk about the signs of consciousness emerging, they refer to the emergence of agriculture and the beliefs associated to burying the dead. The ants have a separate place to which they carry their dead, and they’ve been farming for longer than us…\n\nThere’s sound and light, too. How does the set up operate?\n\nAs the ants pass a sensor – which they must cross to reach their food - they activate sounds in the musical composition. The lights come on and then go off as required to regulate the heat: they act like an artificial sun. The fungus needs a humid 20-27 degrees to flourish. And the sound is influenced by how much light is needed to heat the fungus. Also incorporated is my personal collection of psychedelic cacti – San Pedro and Peyote.\n\nHaroon Mirza’s ‘|||’ runs 24 February – 8 April 2023 at the Lisson Gallery.

He has a way with unexpected faces – as in his long-running series of ceramic masks – and it’s plants that take them on in his solo show ‘we are flowers of one garden’. The installation is humorous, theatrical and camp but also macabre, simultaneously considering change, ageing, grief and loss in the context of his personal history and the history of working-class culture.\n\nWhat’s with the pinstripe coat?\n\nI thought I’d fit in with the business style of Mayfair without going so far as wearing a suit…\n\nWe enter a garden of sorts?\n\nYes, the front space is set up like a garden, with vase pieces like figures, flowers like faces, hands like flowers…\n\nWhat’s the show about?\n\nMy Mum and her garden. I was sitting in my Mum’s garden, and though I’ve always told people I don’t come from an artistic background, I suddenly thought, ‘I do!’ – seeing the garden as an outpouring of creativity. My Mum’s a really keen gardener, and that her outlet – there’s pride, yes, but also something deeply personal and spiritual about it. And I thought I wanted to make an exhibition about this. We moved house a lot, but every time Mum made the most of the garden. The garden she has now isn’t big – maybe 10m x 10m – but she really packs the plants in, so the borders have taken over the centre.\n\nIs it a rather personal show?\n\nIt’s more personal than any show I’ve done, so I can’t separate myself from it in the way I usually can. My Mum is directly present – this is the first time I’ve cast a body other than my own. There is something about me moving away from the countryside to London, how I look to nature for comfort now. And flowers are a metaphor for life – they need nurturing and looking after – so the mirroring with the relationship of gardener to a parent seemed really beautiful. And the year making the show allowed me to spend time with my Mum. I hope I’m not candy-coating it, but it absolutely comes from a place of love – Mum’s my number one. And I hope that’s reflected in the work. Any relationship has its ups and downs, but I do think my Mum did her best for me and I adore her for that. And as you get older, you start seeing your parents in yourself.\n\nDo the flowers represent you and your mother?\n\nNo, I look at them as their own beings, even though the Mother Flower is the only work which doesn’t have any casts from either my body or my mother. That represents the interconnectedness of nature. The roots are about connectedness and the mother tree philosophy. It’s about how we understand the natural world, how we used to think we were above it but now we realise we’re all just a part of it. ‘Mother Flower’ is covered with European folk emblems. There’s a Hungarian flower motif with a razor blade look. The nose is from Germany, the eyebrows are Polish, and the eyes are from a Dutch shape. I love folk motifs as they tell of people who worked closely with nature, and they probably go back further than we know, as history isn’t written by the poor. And they seem to have a common aesthetic, so they work well together.\n\nWhy do some flowers have roots and some not?\n\nThe sculptures have roots, though not all are displayed with them. Buy a flower and you get a root free! I wanted to vary it so that some have that rat’s tail look, but others are more floating and solar. I see the roots as mandrakes – as having a limb-like quality.\n\nWhat materials have you used?\n\nEverything you see is either from plants or else is clay – the earth they grow in. So you have hessian, linen, and felt. I also wanted some scent, so there are dried flowers in the mouths: rose, lavender, hibiscus, and chamomile. I’ve used applique – I love that because it’s an embroidery technique rooted in the history of working people as a way to put scraps of fabric together to make clothes and decorations. And the trace of the hand in the stitch is important to me, like handwriting or a trace of the body.\n\nSome of the colours are more bodily than floral?\n\nTotally. I wanted to present them as fleshy, and I’ve reversed the colours so that the petals are always drained of colour and the centre is bright.\n\nWhat’s the soundtrack?\n\nMy mother’s family were hop pickers. That’s a way of life that doesn’t really exist anymore. And hops also have flowers. You can hear samples from my granddad – who worked in the hop fields – playing the accordion and my mother and I singing the Dolly Parton song ‘Wildflowers’, the lyrics of which provide the titles for all the works. Dolly is an artist I love, and apart from being a beautiful song about flowers, ‘Wildflowers’ is essentially a song about being free to be yourself. From a queer perspective, that was always going to resonate.\n\n‘Just a wild mountain rose’ is cast from your mother’s face?\n\nYes. Casting faces relates to death masks – but this is about keeping her forever. It also makes her a little psychedelic, blissed out. And the use of linen adds a theatrical element, as in stage backdrops.\n\n‘Wildflowers don’t care where they grow’, is you?\n\nMe with chamomiles in my mouth.\n\nAre the flowers particular species?\n\nNo, I looked at lots of flowers, but these are all imaginary hybrids of their features. Some have a folk motif; some are more real.\n\nInstallation view (back room): Courtesy of the artist and Stephen Friedman Gallery, London. Photo by Mark Blower.\n\nThey strike me as more active than most flowers in art?\n\nYes, I like the idea that the flowers are powerful beings in their own right. They could do something, could carry emotions, and are a little bit… scary! Perhaps they could eat you…\n\nAnd extrovert – like you?\n\nPeople think I’m a gregarious and outgoing extrovert, but that’s not really true; it’s performative. And that’s in the work – it’s like a mask – there’s performativity. I’m an introverted extrovert, constantly trying to communicate what it is to be human.\n\nThe works look as if they were fun to make?\n\nTotally. A lot of this is channelling joy, and as a maker, I love making; that’s my favourite part of being an artist.\n\nWhat did your mother make of the show?\n\nI am very happy and relieved to report that she loved it!\n\nTop Photo: Jonathan Baldock with ‘Mother Flower’ 2022, photo © Paul Carey-Kent Artlyst 2023\n\nJonathan Baldock’s ‘we are flowers of one garden’ runs at Stephen Friedman Gallery until 25 February 2023.\n\nJonny Briggs: Interview of the Month, January 2023\n\nJonny Briggs combines photography, performance, and sculpture to explore issues around childhood and identity. Archival family portraits trigger his entry into a complex and painful past, breaking apart rigid structures and conventions to create space for new perspectives.

The definitive means through which an artist gives us access to their unique vision? Or a fascinating - but always provisional – dance around the subjectivity and limitations of both artist and medium? London-based Canadian Allison Katz relishes the second of those options at Camden Art Centre through a recurring range of eccentric subjects - such as cockerels, cabbages, the interiors of lifts, views from open mouths, other art, jokes, anecdotes, and plays on her own name. I asked her about some of the 30 works that make up the installation ‘Artery’ – a title that feeds the internally captured word ‘art’ into the heart’s connection to all our organs, the circulation of ideas within the body of the show, and the gallery’s place within the systems and communities of the locality.\n\nAllison Katz: Installation with ‘The Other Side ’ , 2021 – oil and rice on canvas, Photo Rob Harris. Courtesy the artist\n\n‘The Other Side’ seems to depict a cockerel crossing not a road, but a gap in the gallery ’s display wall. What interests you in that?\n\n‘Why did the chicken cross the road? ’ has the structure of a joke, but it is actually an anti-joke because there ’s no punchline. So it ’s about deflation: you set up the expectation that he must have some intention, somewhere to go, but he just wants to get to the other side. Somehow that disappointment is funny, and I thought: that ’s exactly what painting is, a big build-up and then a deflation, but one that leads to something more interesting – the unknown. The joke can also be interpreted as being about death and anxiety, so what you remembered as a child turns out to have these other meanings. That ’s what ’s great about painting: the idea evaporates as you chase it, and it ends up being about so many other things. After twenty years of painting I still have no idea what I ’m doing until I get to the other side, it renews itself in constantly surprising ways.\n\nThere are several cocks in the show. Why do you paint the same thing repeatedly?\n\nAs with all the things that end up being motifs, I don ’t set out for it to be like that. They start out as one-off engagements, but then for one reason or another it interests me to return to the subject. So they ’re all ongoing – I don ’t want to put a limit on anything, and I ’m against the idea of a finite ‘series’ -as who knows when another idea will come that fits? Or when I ’ll want to return to a work - the magnetic pull of a painting is that it ’s never really finished: the surface remains open in a way that it doesn ’t in sculpture or film. You can be tortured by that or made curious by it, and I like to stay on the curious side.\n\n‘Cabbage (and Philip), No. 22 ’ , 2020 – oil on linen, 35 x 35 cm\n\nThere are five painting of cabbages. Why so?\n\nThere are actually thirty, from which I chose five for Camden. They began in 2013 when I wanted to paint a portrait of my husband, and he didn ’t want to pose. I spied a cabbage and felt it was functioning in a very similar way: veiny with a heart and a brain. It seemed to be a suitable surrogate in that moment, and as portraiture is bound to be a failed enterprise - I wasn ’t going to capture him ‘for real ’ anyway - it was easier to imagine his presence in a kind of shadowy way. I’m not interested in the cabbage on its own per se but for the dynamic it creates in relation to this idea of deferral and failure, still-life and portrait, so in every cabbage painting his profile is at the side. The shadow is important as this stand-in for a lack, or a need. And the shadow activates the edge of the painting when we normally want to look at the centre: it ’s a way to show how you can ’t really paint your true desire, you have to go around it. It’s also a complete pleasure to paint from observation, which I don’t do often, and that sort of concentration often leads to a refreshment of other techniques and ideas.\n\nAllison Katz: Elevator III (Camden Art Centre), 2021 – acrylic, iridescent and metal pigments on linen Photo Eva Herzog. Courtesy the artist.\n\nYou ’ve hung a trompe-l'œil elevator interior on the wall at the point behind which the actual service lift runs. Do you like elevator jokes?\n\nI do, because they operate on many levels! Ha. My interest in painting elevators began with an extremely vivid, almost lucid dream I had… it rattled me, but still it is extremely rare for me to paint the subject of a dream. The situation that activated it was a site visit to Nottingham Contemporary, where the first iteration of ‘Artery’ took place. To my surprise their service lift actually opened up in Gallery 1, where I was going to show. Because of this coincidence I knew I had to investigate it further in paint. I had already done tons of research in regards to my dream’s possible meaning online – that ’s the thing about the Internet, there are forums for elevator dreamers! They had interpretations for every aspect of the elevator: the material it was made of, the building it was in, the others inside it with you or not, the floor number you went up or down to… It just reconfirms that sense of how deeply complex and symbolic the unconscious is. And painting is exceptionally good at taking a surface and allowing it to operate on, yes, any number of levels… both visual and psychological.\n\nAlisson Katz in the studio with what will become a ‘mouth painting’\n\nThere are several paintings where we seem to be looking out of a mouth. How do they work?\n\nThey use a mouth, measured to my own height, as a framing device to suggest the point of view of both language and the gut – the gut so that consumption and taste are built in, a way to play on and challenge the idea that painting is just a matter of taste. And we always look with our eyes, but what happens if other body parts do the looking? You can ’t outrun your own frame, so I like to build it in so that you can see and question it rather than taking it for granted.\n\nInstallation view at Camden, Photo Rob Harris.

As such, it follows on from her public commissions Green/Light (for M.R.), for The Folkestone Triennial (2014) and Dutch/Light for Turner Contemporary (2017), which used the generative structures of hop gardens and glasshouses to express the practical, spiritual and emotional work involved in growing a sense of self, place or community. For the most part, Pardes will host others, but one of those events will be the screening of Bradley’s new film M.R., 2021, which links the communal spirit of Green/Light (for M.R.) to her own life story.\n\nJyll Bradley in Pardes. Photo: Neil Hanna.\n\nIn your new film, M.R., we see your sculpture Green/Light (for M.R.). That work adopts structures from the hop industry, recalled from your childhood in rural Kent. We hear a personal narrative about your adoption. How do sound and vision connect?\n\nThe visuals are juxtaposed with the narrative, effectively using the sculpture as a giant camera – both into the past and reflecting the world around it. The sculpture is dedicated to my birth mother, (M.R.) so it becomes a means of looking at my own history through something I’ve made. I love how sculpture can become a social phenomenon – you make the work and then you learn how it operates in the world – and I spent a lot of time hanging about the sculpture and watching how other people reacted to it. My film is autobiographical, but it is also the portrait of an artwork. I wanted to show that Green/Light (for M.R.) isn’t the static thing you might expect, but open and reflexive: it reacts with light; the natural world evolves in and around it. It has a private life; like us it has good days and bad days.\n\nGreen/Light (for M.R.) 2014. Photo: Thierry Bal\n\nThe film follows your younger self searching for an identity both as a person and as an artist. That use of the sculpture as a seeing device resonates with the revelation that you developed a sight problem while studying at the Slade. What happened?\n\nI woke up one morning at 24, and my left eye was full of ‘floaters’. It seems that, while I was in the womb, my mum ate something raw with the parasite toxiplasmosis in it, a creature that dies but leaves dead cells floating around. For some reason it erupted then, rather than in childhood as is usual. There’s no cure, and you can go blind. I’m always aware of it, though I have learned to live with it. So it’s something I have got from my birth mother that I relate to sight and insight of all types. The ‘eruption’ was the catalyst for looking for her.\n\nThat triggered you to write diary entries exploring the experience of adoption, and you quote from those. There are some striking statements about adoptees, for example ‘we were not chosen, we were available’ and ‘we walk with an invisible twin – the life we didn’t lead’…\n\nYou never get over the combination of how you are always told you were chosen, but on the other hand you feel you were abandoned. I’ve seen it explored in literature – Jackie Kay’s The Adoption Papers is wonderful – but not in art. I grew up in the 60’s-70’s under a particular system – closed adoption – in which the record of the biological parents is kept sealed until adulthood. In the narrative of the film I access that information for the first time. The story concludes with me writing to my biological mother.\n\nIf one part of your identity is ‘who you are’, another part is ‘what you do’. How does that connect?\n\nAs a child I was always told how good I was at drawing… and as an adoptee you have extreme desire to please – so I wondered: did I want to become an artist just to please people? And is artistic ability something you can inherit, or is it a matter of conditioning?\n\nM.R. is the first part of a planned trilogy. Will we learn what happened after you wrote the letter?\n\nYou’ll have to wait and see! The other films are only in my head at the moment. But they will also use my sculpture as a way into autobiographical themes via my writing – I’ve always written alongside and as part of my practice, including plays, dramatisations and documentaries for BBC Radio 4.\n\nPardes, 2021. Photo: Tom Nolan ​\n\n‘Pardes’, appropriately for a space that was once a fruit warehouse, brings an apple green light to a structure derived from the leaning design of historic glasshouses in Scotland. What were you thinking about?\n\nI wanted to make a hybridisation of the different growing structures I’d found, and I also see it as an abstracted version of an orchard turned on its side. I am interested in the connection between harvest and structure - that universal connection between growth and shelter. Pardes can read as a roof, upward growth and beams of sunlight as well as echoing the beams of the warehouse. And it’s not so much occupying the building as intersecting with it. As with my other sculptures the work acts like an eye you can look through, picking up reflections and refractions from its environment. The work sees the building - and us. In many ways it is one of my most abstract works, I pared it back over lockdown. It reflects my questions during that time: ‘what is essential? What is not?’\n\n‘Pardes’ uses fluorescent Edge-Lit Plexiglas, which has become a signature material for you?\n\nYes, rather as fruit takes in light and makes something of it, the Plexiglas sucks in light and pushes it out at the edges, so they glow with a green light that will sustain us through winter. This is the first time I’ve made such a structure inside: I was going to flood the work with artificial light, but instead I have embraced the dark light of the space, so the plexi just picks up any light available to it. It is a gloaming work, evocative of landscape and perhaps the times we are going through.\n\nIs that a stuffed owl up there?\n\nYes, that’s a detail you might not notice at first. Perhaps it will catch the mice in the warehouse…In seriousness, the owl connects to a wonderful woman I met during the course of researching this work. You can only access the full story behind its presence by asking one of the gallery hosts.\n\nStill from M.R.\n\nPardes runs to 18 April at Fruitmarket, Edinburgh. M.R. will be screened there in March, and will also be on view in at the Hayward Gallery this summer. Dates and times to be confirmed. Jyll Bradley is also in the group show ‘Trees Die Stand: Plants and Humans’ at Pi Arts, London, to 15 January.\n\nInterview of the Month, December 2021\n\nMAGNUS PLESSEN\n\nUntitled (Fig. 21), 2021 - Oil and charcoal on canvas, 25 x 100 cm\n\nThe German painter Magnus Plessen tends to paint in thematic groups: in 2016 he showed his ‘1914-1918’ series in London, looking at bodies armoured for, and repaired after, combat in World War I. His new show ‘Hope Love Helium’ (White Cube Mason’s Yard to 8 January) refers, says the gallery, to both ‘the ineffable dynamics of affection’ and the ‘not unrelated’ process of nuclear fusion, the transformation of hydrogen into helium that powers the sun.\n\nMagnus Plessen, 2021 portrait shoot, © White Cube (Theo Christelis)\n\nYou described your last show at White Cube as providing a ‘mechanistic’ view of the world. What is the angle here?\n\nI’ve moved on to an understanding of reality which is more about processes that we don’t see. I love to think of realities which exist beyond what we can perceive, to imagine that the matter we are composed of is attached to another level of reality, to events that we don’t fully understand and can’t control. Events which continuously take place and even began long before we were human. The book ‘Journey of the Universe’ (Brian Thomas Swimme and Mary Evelyn Tucker, 2011) talks about the stars being our ancestors, meaning that the material that we are made of was actually prefabricated 14 billion years ago when the Big Bang happened. They say, far more beautifully than I ever could: 'Star birth occurs when gravity squeezes a cloud of atoms together so tightly that nuclear fusion ignites in the centre. In this process hydrogen fuses into helium. This nuclear energy expands outwards and opposes gravity. Stars represent an amazingly creative balance between gravitational collapse and nuclear explosion. And as a star expands it creates all the elements (phosphorus, oxygen, carbon, gold, etc.) it’s by this stupendous process that we can say the stars are our ancestors. The carbon atoms of our body passed through an intense explosion of a star.'\n\nWhat struck you in that?\n\nThe thought that my existence starts long before conception, the history of my family and more generally the history of mankind. I think about the idea that on a subatomic level we as humans consist of the same particles as everything else in the universe. That feels like a huge relief. I suddenly feel less isolated from and helpless towards the world around me if I begin to understand that matter some billions of years ago formed a constellation which reached a higher complexity from which life came forth.Did this have us in mind, or is it just a creative process that took place regardless of us? Scientist talk about how matter self-organises. This feels incredibly creative yet independent of us and indifferent to our desire to comprehend reality from a human perspective. What used to be the domain of religion or esoteric speculation seems to have become the domain of science.\n\nUntitled (Fig. 19), 2021 - Oil and charcoal on canvas, 200 × 250 cm\n\nHow is that reflected in the paintings? Take ‘Untitled (Fig 19)’, for example…\n\nOne of the great things about being a painter is that I can follow different representational systems simultaneously, be they micro or macro. I don’t have to be true to life-size. In the context of a painting I can blow up electrons to the size of a pumpkin. The micro and the macro are in parallel in my paintings. With this in mind I could start to invent a world and show it to myself in the process of painting it. I become the first person to see this world. My new paintings are less rooted in experience or memory. They take me to an unknown place. I wish I could one day consider the human figure from a quantum-mechanical perspective.\n\nThe idea of an image from the waiting room of the universe came to me some years back before I had read about quantum states of electrons. At that point I thought about images as pre-recordings: a pre-record of my subject before it has been differentiated or materialized into our time-space continuum.I imagine them coming from the ante-room of the world - the waiting room of the universe - on the doorstep ofDoctor Newton’s office. He would be the kind of character who won’t hesitate to tell you what is wrong with you if you remain out there!\n\nMy new endeavour to imagine something physically impossible in the context of a painting reminds me of my urge to see the underside of the brush mark when I started to paint: as though I could step into the painted space, turn around and see the underside of a painted mark. Today, however, it is not good enough to be on two sides of an object. I try to think of myself in transit from a sub-atomic state to a classical state of being. The old dualities - front and behind, imagined versus palpable reality, abstract versus figurative – are beginning to shift. This time it seems more about potential: what scientists call the superposition of particles. Translated into a painting, that would mean for me possibly female or male or up and down or undecided. This list goes on.\n\nThis is a decidedly yellow and blue show?\n\nAbsolutely, the thinly painted yellow round shapes glow with energy and come towards me. The indigo blue areas move away from me and create a deeper space in which I can hide information as if underwater. The thickly painted yellow passages which are painted using a brush are more about time. In these areas I feel like I gain time because the colour dries so slowly.\n\nThese yellow passages, like the brown, fence-like structures, feel more closely attached to the surface of the canvas. This could be because I exert pressure on the canvas when I paint them. I literally push the paint into the surface.\n\nIf my canvas where to vibrate, these areas would only vibrate as much as the canvas itself does, whereas the round yellow shapes and the blue passages would freely swing and bounce up and down like a wave. Their flatness and volume, stillness and movement resonates with my own situation of being caught between two concepts of reality.\n\nWhat I read fundamentally challenges my intellectual and practical tools. If I could somehow integrate my eyes in my hands, I imagine I would feel more grounded in the real world because I could apprehend and touch reality immediately. The very concept of reality which I so urgently wanted to hold on to suddenly seems secondary.\n\nUntitled (Fig. 23), 2021 - Oil and charcoal on canvas, 200 × 250 cm\n\nI see that in ‘Untitled (Fig, 23)’, the stretcher bar behind the canvas is picked up in the painting, both horizontally and diagonally?\n\nYes, the horizontal and diagonal brush marks are an impression of the stretcher bar. I am used to attaching the image to something undisputedly real. When painting my wife while she was pregnant with our first son, I measured her belly using tape, much like a tailor takes measurements. I then stuck the tape directly onto the canvas. I had found a way around subjective interpretation by touching reality directly with my brush.\n\nThe female form looks rather ethereal…\n\nShe’s more like a ghost, whereas the male is more solid and composed, often partially of wood- a blockhead! They are depicted in different material states and yet they freely connect. They form spontaneous impermanent constellations. I think that the tenderness between female and male in my paintings comes without scripted expectations of what should happen next.\n\nInstallation view at White Cube\n\nDo you still turn the canvas around as you paint?\n\nSometimes images from the history of art emerge on my canvas as I work on it. By turning the canvas, I can free it from interfering memories. What’s more, if I do that several times, there comes a moment when an unexpected image comes towards me, rather than me bringing an image to the canvas.\n\nWhat are people surprised to hear about you?\n\nThat my wife and I have four sons.\n\nI think that makes you one man in 300, as only 5% of men have four children, and the chances of them all being boys is 1 in 16… Does that large family influence your work?\n\nI don’t separate my artistic life from my family: that’s a decision you take as an artist – do you treat them as one thing, or as separate spheres? My studio is at our home, so there is a constant exchange. I don’t paint portraits, but when I think of the female it is always my wife. If you compared the shape of her eyes with women in the paintings, you would recognise it. And the energy of the boys certainly feeds in as well! I never really know what will happen next…\n\nNOTE: This is a slightly expanded version of the interview published at Artlyst\n\nInterview of the Month November 2021\n\nTANIA KOVATS\n\nOne can distinguish no fewer than seven diverse yet thematically linked streams of work in Tania Kovats’ show ‘Oceanic’ (at Parafin to 20 November). We discuss three of them below, but you will also find a library installation made up of various copies of ‘The Sea Around Us’, an inspirational text for the artist; her ‘Books from the Flooded Library’, stained by water; several meditative ‘Sea Mark’ watercolours of the surface of the sea; and a sculptural installation evoking the death of coral. Kovats lives in Devon and teaches at Dundee University.\n\n‘The Divers’, 2019 – installation view of Oceanic at Parafin Gallery, photography by Peter Mallet\n\nWhere does your name come from?\n\nI am half Transylvanian, but I was born in my Nan’s council house, where my parents were living at the time, in Whitehawk, Brighton.\n\n‘Brighton Rock’ comes to mind…\n\nI remember being shocked when I read it as a teenager, a book set in Brighton’s underbelly by a writer who does sex, guilt, and Catholicism so well.\n\nWalking into the show, everyone will be struck by the ‘Divers’. How did you arrive at the idea of casting in concrete from wet suits?\n\nIt was more an impulse than an idea – I trust my impulses, but post-rationalising a bit - wetsuits are the skin we wear to be in water, we wrestle in and out of wetsuits, and we are slightly different creatures when we’ve got them on. And I’ve always loved the Selkie myth of the seal woman who slips off her skin to come on shore to dance. This is like that in reverse: you slip on a skin to get into another element, the water. The sculptures are figurative but boneless, they are about the flesh not the skeleton. Their headlessness anonymises them and emphasises the euphoria of the body. I wanted to give the impression they are passing through the solidity of the architecture, joyfully moving between worlds like when you enter water.\n\nDo you dive?\n\nI love being in the water, but no, I’m not a diver. I get ‘vertigo’ in deep water, even though I know I can’t fall. I am fascinated by free divers – for their discipline, and the incredible breathing exercises – that enable them to do what they do, the depths they can reach on a single breath. I see parallels with how I work across drawing and meditation, practising them both in tandem, including through the ‘Drawing Breath’ workshops I run to combining these two things.\n\nHow do you make them?\n\nI suspend wet suits in a small scaffold tower, block them at the end, and fill them up – even small wet suits can hold a huge bulk of concrete, though some can take more than others. Then I bind them, so I can then tension them against the vertical and make them bulge and fall in ways that interest me. I wait three days, then spend a day unpeeling them, which is another wrestle. I leave the zips in – I see them as the navel, that show where these bodies have come from. I like how the wet suits print details, such as seams, into the concrete. I finish them with cleans cuts at varying points to reference both classical sculpture and the cleanly cut cuff.\n\n‘Freediver’, 2020 – installation view of Oceanic at Parafin Gallery, photography by Peter Mallet\n\nThat admiration of freediving must feed into the title of the ‘Freediver’ works. How did they come about?\n\nI have my yoga mat in my drawing studio – they are both daily practices. One morning I decided to combine them by making a body print. So I covered my skin in linseed oil and Payne’s Grey oil paint, and carried out a series of sun salutations, printing through repetition, more or less hitting the same places as I repeated the poses. The feet slip, as I’m covered in oil. I called them ‘Freedivers’ because they feel as if they are mobile, moving through space. ‘Freediver’ also suggests the state of mind I hope to achieve in yoga and drawing.\n\nI suppose Yves Klein’s Anthropométrie works are one predecessor?\n\nYes, I recently found some fascinating interviews with Klein’s wife and models, describing how much they loved the process – they said that they never felt naked, due to the paint on them, and felt they were printing their souls rather than their bodies. That made me think again about the feminist reading of those works that I had previously signed up to, that problematise this work. The ‘Freediver’ works are me printing myself, though – I am brush and artist at the same time. It’s a very primal impulse to print with the body: you can go from handprints I’ve seen in caves in Patagonia right through to David Hammons, Agnes Dene and Helen Chadwick using a photocopier to print her body. I made ‘Freediver’ during lockdown at a time when touch was becoming associated with contamination and danger. Touch is so important, and it has a unique reciprocity: when we touch something it touches us back, and that’s not true of our other senses like looking or listening. So I wanted to visualise a positive language of touch.\n\n’’’Orgasm Drawings’, 2021 - installation view of Oceanic at Parafin Gallery, photography by Peter Mallet\n\nThe ‘Orgasm Drawings’ are another lockdown project, and again touch is evoked. Are they difficult to make?\n\nIt did take some work to establish how to make these and an entry into a particular state of mind. My right hand is bringing me orgasm, while my left hand holds a pencil and mirrors or copies the movement. It’s the most extreme manifestation I could think of where I could make a drawing about touch. The drawings I end up with are abstract expressionist scrawls that describe, I think, a vagina. And I like the bizarre idea that you could say: ‘look, there’s an orgasm!’ which is a little disruptive in a show that could seem polite. But they’re also oceanic moments: the moment of orgasm is one in which you are less separate from the world, you expand and are part of everything.\n\nHow can I tell whether, in line with general male insecurities about the female orgasm, you’ve faked them?\n\nThe question of truth and trust hangs over any artwork you see. I suppose it would be possible to make a set of ‘fake’ orgasm drawings but that doesn’t interest me. What I like more is the idea that it might be possible to trace and hold an orgasm on a piece of paper.\n\nInterview of the Month, October 2021\n\nIBRAHIM MAHAMA\n\nIbrahim Mahama came to international attention for his monumental installation of jute sacks at the Venice Biennale in 2013, a powerful way to reference how only £2bn of the £15bn market value of Ghana’s cocoa production, largely transported in such sacks, flows into the country. But that represents just one strand of his hugely ambitious, socially engaged practice, for which he acquires all manner of objects – and even buildings - in order to tap into their histories. I caught up with him at the opening of his show ‘Lazarus’ (15 September – 7 November 2021 at White Cube Bermondsey).\n\nIs that the biblical Lazarus who rose from the dead?\n\nYes, the ‘Lazarus Effect’ is collecting remnants from the past to reinterpret them, to make them live again.\n\nThat includes Nkrumah Voli-ni,an uncompleted grain silo in the northern city of Tamale, where you live and work. How come?\n\nI’ve been researching the post-independence infrastructure in Ghana, buildings which were abandoned in 1966 when our first president, Kwame Nkrumah, was overthrown in a military coup d’état. They were part of a socialist programme to make Ghana self-sufficient, but the subsequent regimes have wanted nothing to do with his legacy, so the buildings were never finished - even though that would have made economic sense. It was said that the silos, being built by Soviet architects, weren’t suited to the climate, and even that Nkrumah Voli-ni was going to be a prison. It had been abandoned for sixty years, but I asked myself the question: if you can’t use it to store cocoa or maize, why can’t you make another use of it?\n\nHow will you use the silo?\n\nI’m trying to bring the building back to life – not to be as it was, as in the 60’s we didn’t have the same environmental concerns that we have today, but using it an ecological way – as a greenhouse. When I bought it, the occupants were bats, and I wanted the bats to be co-inhabitants. The pandemic was starting, and bats were being blamed for starting the virus – but, if anything, these species have not endangered mankind, mankind have endangered every other species on the planet. So I’m interested in the whole ecological system around the bats and what they symbolise.\n\nAppropriately, then, bats appear in the hanging sculptural installation ‘Lazarus’ (2021). What is that made from?\n\nI am working with armatures from old buildings, and pulling them together to create this gesture of the bats by combining them with tarpaulins of the sort traditionally used to cover goods which are being transported internationally. They’re dark, and oil-drenched from contact with engines, so it almost looks as if oil has spilled into the ocean and killed whales. The show also has collages, which combine photos of the bats in the building with documents like receipts from Ghanaian companies.\n\nThe most striking – and noisiest – work is ‘Capital Corpses’ (2019-21), which consists of 100 sewing machines on school desks, operating in syncopated bursts, and blackboards still showing the last lessons taught with them. What is that about?\n\nI like the simple idea of combining the classroom with these machines, typically used by young women who, lacking a formal education, get a sewing machine as their means to keep a family. I’m interested in the contradiction between what the machines and the desks signify.\n\nHow do you acquire so much old stuff?\n\nI often negotiate to replace old for new, added to which there are many scavengers in Ghana, so if I need anything I just commission them to go around. The desks are a colonial design by British, and I like it that kids always write on them. I was less interested in the sewing machines as formal objects than in the sound connected to them – but they didn’t work. Often in Ghana people will buy second hand clothing without worrying if it will fit or not, because we always have a tailor available. So I worked with tailors, switching them from using the machines to repairing them. When they came back on, it was another return of the dead.\n\nYou’re just finishing your PhD. What is your subject?\n\nIt is based on the project to resurrect buildings around the country – old swimming pools and cemeteries as well as silos. I look into the political forms behind the spaces – Marxist theories of capital, and the contradictions posed - and aim to translate them into another kind of system that allows for hope to be bred within a new generation.\n\nWhat do people make of you back home?\n\nThey are surprised that I consider myself an artist, given the sorts of thing I do, but I think that is an important part of leading them into new perspectives.\n\nYou come from a large polygamous family. Can you tell me about that?\n\nMy father has four wives and they have ten children, but there are many adopted children, too – more than I can count, you always came across different people in the house. Relations with my mother and the other wives are very similar: the only reason you can marry more than one wife is because you are deemed to be very responsible. Everything is equally shared, and sometimes wives will give children to each other to raise. I don’t know if my practice would have developed in the same way if I didn’t have that background – even though my work doesn’t deal with my family, the spirit of it makes a difference.\n\nInterview of the Month, September 2021\n\nALEXANDRE DA CUNHA\n\nThe Brazilian artist Alexandre da Cunha has a major show at Brighton’s CCA. ‘Duplex’ (to 25 Sept) articulates ‘his engagement with cultures of consumption, reuse, materiality and art history’ through found – but altered - objects. I talked to him about four works linked by their association with labour and leisure - mops and concrete mixers on the labour side; beach towels and part of a boat for leisure.\n\nHi Alexandre, you’re bang on time!\n\nYes… knowing I’m both Brazilian and an artist people expect me to be an easy-going, laid back, untidy kind of guy who goes with the flow - but I’m actually very punctual and organised!\n\nYou’ve worked between London and Sao Paulo for 20 years. I guess that’s been difficult recently?\n\nI still have a place in both, and normally I’m back and forth – typically a few times a year. I always seem to have a good excuse to go back there when it gets cold! But I was stuck here this last year, and so I experienced my first complete London winter. It was horrendous – though there was something disruptive about continually switching seasons.\n\nAre your works readymades?\n\nI’ve never fully embraced that term. There is always some alteration and usually a lot of work behind them - not just a displacement of the object. So, for example, the mop heads which make up ‘KENTUCKY (Napoli)’, 2020 are individually dyed by dipping them in paint, then there’s a lot of work in knotting them together, like making a tapestry.\n\nThat’s a curious title: ‘KENTUCKY (Napoli)’…\n\nMost of my titles come from brands of products or labels which I find. ‘Kentucky mop’ is actually the name for that type of mop, and I liked how it also irresponsibly appropriates a place and a culture. This Kentucky was made in Naples for the Thomas Dane show there, and uses colours I saw in the city.\n\nTell me about the mops\n\nThey’re a long-running series. After a while I started dying them, but I’ve only just started with partial dying – that suggests tie-dye, and makes them more painterly. I like to establish a dialogue with the space – here the mops touch the floor, and that reminds you to recognise their function – they could have been used for the labour of cleaning the floor.\n\nThe Urn Series are cement mixers. How did you come to use them?\n\nThat began from me collecting images of mixers I saw both here and in Brazil. There are differences: in Sao Paulo people will often use a mixer themselves, whereas in Hackney I’d see them on commercial sites with several workers involved. But I realised what I was mainly interested in was the shape, so I started collecting abandoned ones, then bought them off EBay and so on. I remove the blades inside, and just use the drum as a readymade that has a lot of life – I’m not appropriating the object alone, but all the work that was done with it – all the history indicated by dents and marks. I don’t change that shape, just the surface. Some I do little to, some I polish until they become shiny, returning them to the metal. That makes them look newer, but actual new ones would be too boring, too regular.\n\nI notice some of the five drums are titled simply ‘Urn IV’ etc, but others are titled ‘Full Catastrophe’. Why is that?\n\nThey were in a show which used a quote from Michael Cacoyannis’s 1964 film Zorba the Greek – picking up on the struggle to build a home in the context of asking what defines masculinity: ‘Yes, I’m a man’, says Zorba, ‘…wife, children, house, everything - the full catastrophe’. That fits with how the staging on paving slabs in Brighton suggests a domestic patio. I’ve previously shown the drums both on plinths - which emphasise their association with archaeological relics and the museum display of treasures – and on paving, reminding us of how the cement might be used.\n\nWhat’s the appeal of the beach towels showing a woman, as used in ‘Amazons’?\n\nWhat first attracted me was the underlying and somewhat disturbing weirdness of having an image of a body painted on a towel, so you are lying on someone else. Then I discovered the potential to use the leisure / tourism aspect to talk about other things, e.g. dreaming, escapism, even time travel.\n\nIt acts as a figurative painting, doesn’t it?\n\nIt does: I always refer to categories of representation through my work. I like it that the first encounter with the viewer has an entry point – being seen as ‘a picture’, ‘a pot’ etc. In this case tapestry, photography and sculpture are all in play, and as I dye the towels with shades of one colour, that introduces the processes of pop painting or printing – the repetition might suggest Warhol in particular. And I enjoy how you still recognise the object within the work – the towel is unashamedly there, no tricks or hiding.\n\n‘Duplex’ is more like a drawing or relief?\n\nYes, it’s very spatial combination of objects from two very different places in a forced marriage: the carpet from a home or office, the railing from a boat, made strange by its vertical placement. Indoors and outdoors come together. You might hope to escape on the boat, but you’re going nowhere on a carpet.\n\nIs it relevant that all of the works we’ve talked about relate to the body?\n\nYes, it’s becoming clear to me that if there’s one thing to say my work is about, it is about the body. Both labour and leisure operate through the body, through tactile, physical relationships with objects: handling the mop, shovelling the cement, using a towel, holding a railing…\n\nInterview of the Month, August 2021\n\nROSIE GIBBENS\n\nThe entertaining and thought-provoking solo exhibition, ‘Soft Girls’, by Rosie Gibbens, is at the Zabludowicz Collection, London to 15 August. Gibbens has cobbled together a dozen moveable semi-humanoid sculptures out of domestic appliances, exercise equipment, sex toys, fabric and stuffing. She activates them in an accompanying video and live performance to generate raise questions about power and agency.\n\nRosie Gibbens in the ‘Soft Girls’ installation\n\nI first saw you three years ago, in a film that Art Monthly described as making ‘a convincingly earnest comic turn out of performing sex acts on an office chair’. How do you see that now?\n\nI made ‘Professional Body’ for my degree show in 2018. My manipulation of an office chair developed out of mucking around while sitting on one: something clicked and I imagined this bored office worker in a very corporate space trying to entertain herself. The dynamic is unclear – perhaps the chair (or whoever it stands in for) has power over her or perhaps she is in control of the situation. I remember some teenagers watching: they didn’t realise they were sitting on the same chair until I told them – they thought that was gross and got off fast!\n\nThe installation at the Zabludowicz Collection has some of the same spirit but is more like a gym. Do you go to the gym?\n\nNo, performance is my work out! Though it may not be very effective, as I like incorporating objects which probably don’t work. For example I’m pretty sure the ‘vibrating plate exerciser’ doesn’t really make you lose weight – but it was good for a game at Christmas, when you had to sit on it and make a life drawing while vibrating. And there’s a penis pump which I’m not sure works at all – I tested it with my finger – I doubt it would make anything bigger! I’m interested in niche products that are advertised as ways to streamline and improve our lives but actually make things more confusing and frustrating!\n\nAre they sculptures or props?\n\nI don’t worry about that, or about whether the performance documentation is an art work, which people often ask. You can get tangled up in definitions, but at the end of the day it’s all part of the same project. I do want the props to stand up materially and formally, though, to work in their own right when I’m not there.\n\n‘Gym Master’, 2020 – vibrating plate, hospital chair, nipple tassels, rubber gloves, fabric and stuffing\n\nI notice you always perform in the same high heels?\n\nYes, they’ve become part of my character of myself. They change how I move, and my posture and can reference different realms to me - they have a slightly fetish aspect but also wouldn’t be out of place in a wedding or boardroom. That fits with how my materials are a mix of medical and sex shop supplies and things you’d have at home. I like to cross over these different worlds – gym / office / hospital / porno / domestic – so it’s not clear what type of space you’re in.\n\nTell me about the printed fabric ‘Tongue’ which can be pulled out some 13 feet\n\nThat comes from Looney Tunes: when a character sees something they like – often a cartoon woman – their eyes bounce out of their head and their tongue unrolls. So my tongue is responding to the other sculptures and performances in the same way. You pull on a butt plug to pop out the eyes – I saw some children who thought it was hilarious until their parents stepped in on seeing what it was!\n\nRosie Gibbens in performance\n\nThere’s a film of you using your inventions. Can the audience join in?\n\nI’d encourage it in principle, but I’m not sure how long the sculptures would last so only some can be played with in this show. I’d like to build more robust sculptures in the future designed for other people to activate. There’s a real joy in being able to try them out, and that would change the dynamic.\n\nWhat were you thinking about when you made the work?\n\nI was mixing together different references to how female bodies are consumed, and trying to give new life to stereotypical images by looking at them through my own lens. I was particularly interested by the Anatomical Venus models of eighteenth-century Italy, languid women with detailed reproductions of their innards exploding out of them for the purpose of medical training. I love their mix of glamour and the grotesque. I combined these with references to horror movie characters, sex dolls and nudes from art history. Hopefully my sculptures and performance give different perspectives on and agency to these.\n\nHow do you use these figures?\n\nThough my work has humorous elements, I think it marries dark and light. I was imagining the Venuses coming to life through the horror genre to seek revenge for the way they were originally portrayed in passive, sometimes violated positions. I give them a new cartoonised way of living. I think of them having their own personalities and as versions of me. And there’s the ‘Soft Girl’ internet aesthetic, a hyper-feminised cute look taken so far that it appears ironic. These girls are playing with their identity around that stereotype and being irreverent towards it. That’s my approach, too.\n\nInterview of the Month: July 2021\n\nSPENCER FINCH\n\nIn his current exhibition at Lisson Gallery (‘Only the hand that erases writes the true thing’, to 31 July), Spencer Finch presents new works which continue his long-running investigation of the subtle beauty and mystery of nature and our perception if it.
