He has written four musicals, one of which, Hey Get a Life, was on at the St Andrews Lane Theatre in Dublin in 2000 which he also directed. His musical The Hard Boiled Egg and the Wasp, about the Victorian comedian Dan Leno, was on at the Lion and Unicorn Theatre in 2012. His later musical, written like the previous one with Andy Street, was Doodle the Musical, which was on at Waterloo East; his father Sam Kydd was in it as a character. He appeared on Talking Pictures TV talking about his father on \"Sam Kydd day\" when they showed nine of the 290 films made by his father between 1945 and 1982.\n\nKydd has acted in many sitcoms, including One Foot in the Grave and three series of Smith and Jones as one of the \"pals\".

His Rudy Vees album The Fists of Harmonious Righteousness has three videos recorded from it: \"King of Thongs\", \"My Baby's Possibly a Vampire\" and \"Dance Like My Dad\". In 2019, Kydd released two tracks with music videos; \"Posh\", a 1930s grime track described as \"a bizarrely brilliant work of art\", and \"Order (Song for John Bercow) (Hp Sauce Dance Mix)\", an electro dance track singing the praises of the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow.[4]\n\nFrom 1997, Kydd was the voice of Paddington Bear in The Adventures of Paddington Bear.
