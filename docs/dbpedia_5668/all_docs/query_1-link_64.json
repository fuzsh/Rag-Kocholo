        "text": "Witness: Dr Paisley, I Presume (Channel 9pm) accompanies the leader of the Democratic Unionists on one of his httle-pubhcised missionary trips to the Cameroon. It is sublime television, thanks to Dr Paisley as much as its presenter, the journalist on Ronson, who hovers gingerly at the edge of the documentary like Nick Broorrifield with a pain threshold. In many ways, it's fortunate that Ronson agreed not to raise the subject of the Ulster peace process, from which Paisley had exiled himself, as it frees the programme to look at the surreal, engrossing business of a white man preaching fire-and-brimstone to the West African masses. There's Paisley by torchlight, whipping up 'a good pulpit sweat', oblivious to the dive-bombing of a thousand hungry insects. And on an impromptu walkabout, ceremonially this was because Joseph overslept .\n\nThere is a little, taken-aback pause. Later on, there is a wonderful scene involving the presentation of a dish of coleslaw, on which 'Welcome DIP' has been written in shaved carrot It would have been easy to reduce a week's worth of freaky episodes like this to a satirical cartoon, but Ronson seems so intrigued by Paisley's drive, magnetism and entourage that the gives the impression of being a pretty fair reflection of events. The relationship between programme-maker and subject is grippingly fleshed out: Ronson, like the preacher's henchmen, finds himself striving to live up to Paisley's expectations. Is he being charmed or intimidated? By the end, there's little room for doubt. Most of the acts on this evening's Nights Out at the Empire (Channel handing over a tin of chocolates decorated with Ulster scenery to a gracious, startled bystander who, Ronson whispers, happens to own a cocoa plantation .\n\nAnd picking on someone very definitely not his own size. Because the man is a terrible bully. Bearing the brunt are Ronson himself, whom Paisley calls (with, it has to be said, a little affection) 'the Jew' or 'the Israelite', and Joseph, the luckless local drivertranslator. One morning, Joseph turns up an hour late, blaming the traffic. Paisley appears to accept his excuses with good grace, and everyone piles into the hired Jeep for another long day's preaching .\n\nIn the pulpit, Paisley apologises to his congregation for arriving in the afternoon rather than the morning. Joseph translates. Paisley then goes on, relishing the moment, to explain that 1 1 (back for a second series) are 16-year-old amateurs entering the talent competition. The spectacle of raw fear on television always brings out one's inner ancient Roman, and inevitably the poor performances are infinitely more enjoyable than the polished ones. Cashing in on the dreary vogue for fly-on-the-wall documentaries, there are plenty of backstage shots of people biting nails and adjusting bra-straps .\n\nYou might prefer to clean out the oven.
