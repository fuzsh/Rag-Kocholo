        "text": "We meet Es Devlin CBE to discuss her new multi-media work SURFACING commissioned by BMW and unveiled at Art Basel in Basel 2024.A pioneering combination of sustainable energy and movement in an installation of water, light, sound and dance. A dance collaboration and a series of mobile sound installations within a pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles.In Hall 1.1 of the art fair Devlin created a booth displaying four works: Surfacing (2024), an illuminated cube of rain penetrated by a line of light and Surfacing II (2024), a pair of painted televisions in which a dancing figure appears to displace pixels and pigment, are flanked by Mask (2018) a projection-mapped model city fusing hands and river, and Mask in Motion (2018) a revolving illuminated translucent printed city which meshes viewers within its kinetic shadow.Each work continues Devlin's 30 year exploration of the entangled dance between humans and technology. The booth surprises visitors each hour as Surfacing's box of rain, like a magician's apparatus, conjures a 7 minute dance work by renowned Paris-based choreographer Sharon Eyal with music composed by London-based duo Polyphonia. A meeting of artist and engineers: Devlin has spent the past year engaging with engineers at BMW, learning the mechanics behind the hydrogen fuel cell technology and its implications for the future of sustainable energy systems. As an opening chapter to the works on view in Hall 1.1, she has created a simple soundscape drawn from their conversations and underscored by composers Polyphonia which is played to guests in the pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles.Devlin says: “I learned from the BMW engineers the beautiful symmetry of the system at work within the hydrogen fuel cell: the energy that is used to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen is recreated when the oxygen is reunited with hydrogen within the car. The by-product is not only the energy which propels the vehicle, but water.”The exterior of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen has been wrapped in a painted blue and white collage in which Devlin overlays paintings and text made in response to the prints and literature which populated her wall and bookshelves as a teenager. Painted gestures echoing the 1831 woodcut ‘The Great Wave off Kanagawa' by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, are superimposed over hand written extracts from literature's longest sentence about water drawn from James Joyce's seminal novel ‘Ulysses'. Underlying the collage are excerpts from BMW Group publications on hydrogen fuel cell technology.Artist and Stage Designer, Es Devlin's work explores biodiversity, linguistic diversity and collective ai-generated poetry. She views the audience as a temporary society and encourages profound cognitive shifts by inviting public participation in communal choral works. Her canvas ranges from public sculptures and installations at Tate Modern, V&A, Serpentine, Imperial War Museum and United Nations General Assembly, to kinetic stage designs at the Royal Opera House, the National Theatre and the Metropolitan Opera, as well as Olympic ceremonies, Super-Bowl half-time shows, and monumental illuminated stage sculptures for Beyoncé, The Weeknd, Dr Dre, Kendrick Lamar and U2.Visit: https://EsDevlin.com/ and Follow @EsDevlin and @BMWGroupCulture Hosted on Acast.

To Be Blindly Hopeful emerged from the very last sentence of a journal that Paul Maheke kept between August 2020 and June 2021, capturing the turbulence of the COVID pandemic. Central to Maheke's practice is a delicate dance between the individual and the collective, personal and broader sociopolitical contexts, echoing the sentiment expressed by bell hooks, who reminds us that ‘the space of our lack is also the space of possibility.' Currently based in France, Paul shares works 'staged' in previous exhibitions at South London Gallery, Chisenhale Gallery, and Tate Modern, highlighting how the ‘new' drawings, prints, book illustrations, and paintings on display here have long formed part of his practice. He explains how performance and dance can be both emancipatory and trapping, with respect to queerness, masculinity and gender, and the reality of being ‘brown body looked at my white audience' - drawing on his lifelong admiration for the French-born ice skater, Surya Bonaly. We discuss Paul's popular culture and academic Influences like Grace Jones and Félix González-Torres, Audre Lorde and Édouard Glissant, and Bruce Nauman to Paul B. Preciado - not as icons but real, complex people. Finally, Paul highlights how his work changes in its global travels, from the Baltic Triennale in Estonia, to Johanneburg, South Africa - and, drawing on collaborations with family members and fellow artist Melika Ngombe Kolongo (Nkisi) for the Congo Biennale in 2021, his personal relationship with arts institutions on the continent, as a diasporic artist. ⁠Paul Maheke: To Be Blindly Hopeful⁠ runs at MOSTYN, Wales until 29 June 2024. It includes Taboo Durag (2021), produced as a performance to camera for ⁠Glasgow International⁠ 2021. This episode marks this iteration of Scotland's biennale festival of contemporary art, which continues until 23 June 2024.** Paul has also shown work as part of the ⁠Diaspora Pavilion at the 58th Venice Biennale in 2019⁠, the first to feature an official performance programme co-produced with the Delfina Foundation, and has work in the ⁠Drawing Biennal 2024⁠, which runs at the Drawing Room in London until 3 July 2024.

In 2022, sculptor LR (Lisa) Vandy relocated her studio from the city of London to Chatham Ropery which, with original machinery from the 19th century, has preserved traditional practices and knowledges. Rope became essential to Britain's burgeoning maritime industry during the Georgian and Victorian eras, tied to the construction of empires, colonial hierarchies, and sites of slavery. Building in collaboration with the resident Master Ropemakers, her sculptures allude to and playfully subvert the media's historic associations and legacy now. From her five-metre-high figure for Liverpool's Canning Dock, to her new, smaller body of works, Lisa walks through her collection and archive on Kent's waterfront. Born in Coventry in the Midlands, she shares her experiences of growing up ‘by the sea' in Sussex as a young person of Nigerian and Irish heritages, and the racialised exclusion some face from leisurely pursuits in natural environments. Inspired by Barbara Ehrenreich's 2006 book, Dancing In The Streets, Lisa unravels ‘collective joy' and the central role of Black women. We see how dance has been used to resist oppression across continents, with spirit dances, raves, festivals, and carnival masquerades, interests shared by contemporaries like Theaster Gates, Hew Locke, Romuald Hazoumè, Zak Ové, and Hassan Hajjaj. Straw-fibre figures recall Grain Mother deities, corn dollies, and Kumpo, spinning dances from the Casamance (Senegal) and Gambia. With her ongoing series of Hulls, comprised of found objects, boats, and fishing floats ‘plundered' from DIY stores, we discuss her interest in the ‘underbelly of empire', knotty relationships between rail, sail, and transport, and ‘migrant crises' in the Mediterranean Sea today. Drawing on her research in museum collections, ancient silverwares, and indigo trade routes, Lisa moves on the discussion about globalised 'African masks' as symbols of ‘aggressive protection'. We discuss gender and identity, and how her curvilinear copper sculptures challenge conventional representations of the ‘female form'. Dynamic drawings of tornados tell of her designs for statues in the landscape - role models for those subject to the male gaze - exposing the empowering potential of contemporary art. Plus, Lisa shares why her tactile public artworks are designed to be destroyed. LR Vandy: Twist runs at the October Gallery in London until 25 May 2024. Dancing In Time: The Ties That Bind Us, commissioned by Liverpool Museums for the International Slavery Museum's Martin Luther King celebrations in 2023, stands at the Historic Dockyard Chatham in Kent until 17 November 2024. On harvest rituals, hear episodes about Ashanti Hare's performances at Against Apartheid at KARST in Plymouth (2023) and Invasion Ecology on Dartmoor (2024), and Learning from Artemisia (2019-2020), by Uriel Orlow and Orchestre Jeunes Étoiles des Astres, at the Eden Project in Cornwall.

From accountant, lawyer, preservationalist, serial entrepreneur, philanthropist, art collector, award winning film maker, wine maker, to helping artists advance their careers, what else could be left for him to achieve but to make his own art (and films). How could anyone make so many significant career transitions? On this episode, we go through some of Dennis' philosophies that helped him transform himself in such significant ways. But before we go onto his third and (what he predicts) will be his final chapter-his own art work, I must pay my respect to Dennis and do what he prefers I not do-highlight some of his amazing achievements which have shaped so many lives and the art world. The Miami art scene has become a global phenomenom in large part due to Dennis. From 2009-2015, Dennis was the vice president for the arts at the Knight Foundation. Launching the foundations arts program and leading it to national prominence, Dennis helped steer close to $200 million in grants to artists and cultural organizations. Helping these artists launch and advance their careers has been one of Dennis' biggest joys in life. Almost out of left field, Dennis decided to take what many of us would consider a mid life crisis into a remarkable journey into documentary film making. Before the world knew it, Dennis had become an award-winning documentary filmmaker focusing on arts and culture creating 87 films and winning over 20 regional Emmys, including from Sundance and SXSW. His films have been shown in over 100 film festivals. You can even catch some of his films on Netflix. My favorite was his first feature documentary called Deep City-the Birth of Miami Sound. For those R & B fans that think Motown WAS R & B, think again. Deep City showcases some of the amazing musical R & B talent that came from the 305. In almost a parallel universe while making these films (and wine), Dennis was brought into Oolite Arts as their CEO where he ran that amazing art support organization where he continued to help award millions of dollars to local artists. One of the major accomplishments he achieved at Oolite Arts was the creation of the Ellies. The Ellies, named after Ellie Schneiderman, who opened the South Florida Art Center back in 1984 when Lincoln Road could not even find tenants. The Ellies is now an annual competition which funds local art teachers, artists projects, exhibitions, public artworks and even film. His farewell achievement for Oolite will be the opening of the soon to be state of the art $30 million headquarters that is scheduled to open in Little River in 2025. The space will provide, among other things, 21 free artists studios, rooms for art classes, a theatre and large gallery. In this episode, we'll explore Dennis's journey from being an accountant, then a lawyer to becoming a pivotal figure in the Miami art scene to his current art work and upcoming films. Discover how he embraced a new chapter in his life, reinventing himself as an art collector turned filmmaker, and gain insights into his views on the future of art in the age of AI. I know Dennis right now is upset at us rehashing his past so I won't go over all his amazing and various work (including his extremely successful wine making venture) and his various contributions to world art world, including the Guggenheim, the Tate Modern and the Perez Art Museum. Instead of going into all the amazing art work he has created over the past decade and continues to create AND his upcoming films AND his own philosophies that have enabled him to transform himself so dramatically so often, you will need to listen to this episode for such nuggets. As a native Miamian who has seen first hand how Dennis has helped make Miami so special, myself and several others owe him the tremendous gratitude. Join Dennis and I as we discuss: Dennis's transition from law to the arts and its profound impact on his life and career.The importance of embracing change and pursuing passions later in life. Fostering creativity and innovation.. The evolving landscape of filmmaking and the influence of AI.Dennis's commitment to nurturing young artistic talent and giving back to the community.His skepticism about the long-term impact of NFTs on the art world. Key Takeaways: Embrace change and pursue your passions, no matter your age. Find activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, embracing the concept of \"flow\" in life. Get involved in your community and share your expertise and inspiration with others. Consider integrating cultural insights into your legal practice for innovative problem-solving. Stay open to learning and flexible in your career path to adapt to new industries and technologies. Join us for a fascinating conversation with Dennis Scholl as we explore the power of reinvention and the endless possibilities that await, even in the later chapters of life.

From celebrated artists like Wassily Kandinsky, Gabriele Münter, Franz Marc and Paul Klee, to previously overlooked figures like Wladimir Burliuk and Maria Franck-Marc. On Tuesday 23 April 2024 at the Press View of ‘Expressionists - Kandinsky, Münter And The Blue Rider' at Tate Modern, RNIB Connect Radio's Toby Davey caught up with Genevieve Barton, Assistant Curator of the exhibition, to find out more about the background to the Blue Rider and how this exhibition reveals the multicultural and transnational nature of such a key moment in early modernist art. About the exhibition ‘Expressionists - Kandinsky, Münter And The Blue Rider' - This major exhibition will tell the story of the international circle of friends who came together in the early 20th century to transform modern art. From celebrated artists like Wassily Kandinsky, Gabriele Münter, Franz Marc and Paul Klee, to previously overlooked figures like Wladimir Burliuk and Maria Franck-Marc. The exhibition will reveal the multicultural and transnational nature of this key moment in early modernist art. Drawing on the world's richest collection of expressionist masterpieces at the Lenbachhaus in Munich alongside rare loans from public and private collections, including some never seen before in the UK, it will celebrate their radical experimentation with form, colour, sound and performance.

The essence of the work emerges from this delicate balance of managing one's time and integrating life within mokuhanga. In this episode of 'The Unfinished Print,' I have the pleasure of speaking with printmaker Wuon-Gean Ho. Wuon-Gean approaches her mokuhanga with a keen focus on work-life balance, emphasizing creation not at the expense of life but as a means to enrich and enhance it. Join me as we delve into Wuon Gean's unique perspective on mokuhanga, how it skillfully blends with her other printmaking endeavors, learning under Akira Kurosaki, her educational experiences and we delve into her philosophies on living a life infused with art.

This organization brings people from around the world to teach English to Japanese students in grade school, junior high, and high schools throughout the country. More info, here. Tate Modern - located in London, UK, and stands as one of the world's largest and most renowned contemporary art museums. It houses an extensive collection of international modern and contemporary art from around the world. The museum is known for its innovative exhibitions that showcase works by both established and emerging artists. Additionally, Tate Modern offers a variety of educational programs, workshops, and events designed to engage visitors of all ages and backgrounds. Kyoto Seika University - situated in Kyoto, Japan, is a leading private university specializing in art and design education. The university offers undergraduate and graduate programs in various fields of art and design, including painting, sculpture, graphic design, and manga. Known for its rigorous academic curriculum, Kyoto Seika University emphasizes practical skills and creative expression. The institution has a rich history and tradition of nurturing talented artists and designers, with a strong focus on fostering creativity and innovation among its students. Akira Kurosaki 黒崎彰 (1937-2019) - was one of the most influential woodblock print artists of the modern era. His work, while seemingly abstract, moved people with its vibrant colour and powerful composition. He was a teacher and invented the “Disc Baren,” which is a great baren to begin your mokuhanga journey with. At the 2021 Mokuhanga Conference in Nara, Japan there was a tribute exhibit of his life works. Azusa Gallery has a nice selection of his work, here. bokashi - is a mokuhanga technique, where the pigment fades from a heavy colour to a softer, broad colour. Made famous by prints designed by Hokusai and Hiroshige, this technique is, for me, the most popular technique utilized by mokuhanga printmakers. There are various types: Ichimoji-bokashi or straight line graduation, used in the above mentioned Hiroshige and Hokusai prints. Ichimoji-mura-bokashi or straight line gradation with uneven edge. Ō-bokashi or wide gradation, Ate-nashi-bokashi or gradation without definition. Futa-iro-bokashi or two tone gradation, and ita-bokashi or softer-edge gradation, where the block is cut in a specific way to achieve this style of gradation. All of these styles of bokashi technique take practice and skill but are very much doable. Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) - is one of the most, if not the most, famous Japanese artist ever known. He designed woodblock prints, as well as creating his own paintings, screens, scrolls, and commissioned art in Buddhist temples throughout Japan. More info, here. The British Museum has a lot of info, here. Devon - is a city located in the southwest of England, and is renowned for its stunning natural beauty, diverse landscapes, and rich cultural heritage. Rugged coastlines adorned with sandy and picturesque villages, Devon offers a wealth of attractions for visitors and locals alike. You can find more info on Devon tourism, here. Fabriano paper - is a high-quality paper produced by the Fabriano paper mill in Fabriano, Italy. It is renowned for its exceptional durability, texture, and archival quality, making it a favorite among artists, printmakers, and conservators worldwide. Fabriano paper comes in various weights, textures, and finishes. It is prized for its ability to withstand repeated erasing, scraping, and wet media applications while retaining its integrity and beauty. Camellia oil - also known as tea seed oil, is a versatile vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of the Camellia oleifera or Camellia sinensis plant, which are the same species from which tea leaves are harvested. Originating in East Asia, particularly China and Japan, camellia oil has been used for centuries for culinary, cosmetic, and medicinal purposes. In mokuhanga it has been used to oil the baren when printing, making a smooth printing surface. Copperplate oil - is a substance used in the intaglio technique such as copperplate engraving or etching. This specialized oil, typically comprising linseed oil and resin, serves multiple purposes throughout the printmaking process. Initially applied to copper plates, it functions as a protective layer, guarding against oxidation while enhancing the quality of engraved or etched lines by promoting smoother, more consistent marks. Copperplate oil aids in achieving tonal effects and to the longevity of the final prints. It also serves as an effective agent for cleaning plates post-etching, ensuring the preservation of engraved details while removing excess ink. Ian Phillips - is a woodblock printmaker based in the UK. He works in water based printing, with the landscape of the sea as his main inspiration.

We mark the passing of this titan of sculpture with Donna De Salvo, the senior adjunct curator of special projects at the Dia Foundation, whose Dia Beacon space has several major works by Serra on permanent view. There are a host of exhibitions focusing on expressionist art in the US and Europe in 2024 and in this episode we focus on two of them. The first ever Käthe Kollwitz retrospective in New York is taking place at the Museum of Modern Art or MoMA, while other shows dedicated to her are taking place in Frankfurt and Stockholm. We speak to Starr Figura, the curator of MoMA's show, which opens this weekend, about Kollwitz's extraordinary work and life. Then, we talk to Natalia Sidlina, the curator of Expressionists: Kandinsky, Münter and the Blue Rider, a major survey opening at Tate Modern next month of the German Expressionist group, which looks anew at the deep friendships that formed the basis of the group, their international outlook and their multidisciplinary output.Richard Serra's work is on long-term view across five galleries at Dia Beacon, New York, US.Käthe Kollwitz, Museum of Modern Art, New York, 31 March-20 July; Städel Museum, Frankfurt, until 9 June; SMK – National Gallery of Denmark, Copenhagen, 7 November-25 February 2025.Expressionists: Kandinsky, Münter and the Blue Rider, Tate Modern, London, 25 April-20 October 2024; Gabriele Münter: the Great Expressionist Woman Painter, Thyssen Bornemisza, Madrid, 12 November-9 February 2025.Further expressionist exhibitions in 2024: The Anxious Eye: German Expressionism and Its Legacy, National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, until 27 May; Munch to Kirchner: The Heins Collection of Modern and Expressionist Art, Dallas Museum of Art, Texas, US, until 5 January 2025; Munch and Kirchner: Anxiety and Expression, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut, US, until 23 June; Erich Heckel, Museum of Fine Arts Ghent, Belgium, 12 October-25 January 2025.

Griselda Pollock has long advocated for the critical function of contemporary art - and artists - in society. Whether paintings, drawings, or sculptures, these media can translate the traumatic legacies of colonialism, imperialism, and migration into visual form, and serve as refusals to forget - especially in our memory-effacing digital age. Born in apartheid South Africa, Griselda has lectured in global contexts; at the University of Leeds in the 1980s, she encountered Sutapa Biswas, a ‘force of nature' and one of the institution's first POC art students. She shares her experience of the two-way flows of teaching and learning. Drawing on stills from the artist's new film work Lumen (2021), and historic ‘Housewives with Steak-Knives' (1984-1985), she highlights both Bengali Indian imagery, and motifs of 17th and 18th century Old/Dutch Masters like Vermeer and Rembrandt - and why the artist ‘didn't need Artemisia Gentileschi' when she had the Hindu goddess Kali. Engaging with leaders of the Blk Art Group like Lubaina Himid, Sonia Boyce, and Claudette Johnson, we find connections with the first generation of British artists, born in the UK of migrant parents. Griselda also shares the important work of art historians and academics beyond Western/Europe, like Homi K. Bhabha, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Chandra Mohanty, Catherine de Zegher, and Hiroko Hagewara. We discuss how being open to challenge and conversation, unsettling your own assumptions, denormalising and widening visibility are all ongoing obligations. Still, with Coral Woodbury's paintings, layered atop H.W. Jansen's History of Art (1968), we see how little the education system has changed. Griselda concludes with thoughts on Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and challenging the norms of modernist colonial tourism within the confines of free speech and market demand. Medium and Memory, curated by Griselda Pollock, ran at HackelBury Fine Art in London until 18 November 2023. An expanded exhibition of Coral Woodbury's Revised Edition runs until 4 May 2024. Griselda Pollock on Gauguin is published by Thames & Hudson, and available from 28 May 2024.

And I think some of the most important periods for me in my life as an artist have been those periods where I have ultimately not known what I was doing or where I was going next. Now I'm a little bit better at just listening to the signals that come along, even though they may not give me the full-fledged answer they'll just point in a direction. And I'm a little bit more patient with the process.” Become a full tier 1 member here to access exclusive additional subscriber-only content and the full archive of previous episodes for £5 per month.For the tier 2 archive-only membership, to access the full library of past episodes for £3 per month, go here.\n\nEdward Burtynsky is regarded as one of the world's most accomplished contemporary photographers. His remarkable photographic depictions of global industrial landscapes represent over 40 years of his dedication to bearing witness to the impact of human industry on the planet. Edward's photographs are included in the collections of over 80 major museums around the world, including the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa; the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Guggenheim Museum in New York; the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid; the Tate Modern in London, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in California.Edward was born in 1955 of Ukrainian heritage in St. Catharines, Ontario. He received his BAA in Photography/Media Studies from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) in 1982, and has since received both an Alumni Achievement Award (2004) and an Honorary Doctorate (2007) from his alma mater. He is still actively involved in the university community, and sits on the board of directors for The Image Centre (formerly Ryerson Image Centre).In 1985, Edward founded Toronto Image Works, a darkroom rental facility, custom photo laboratory, digital imaging, and new media computer-training centre catering to all levels of Toronto's art community.Early exposure to the General Motors plant and watching ships go by in the Welland Canal in Edward's hometown helped capture his imagination for the scale of human creation, and to formulate the development of his photographic work. His imagery explores the collective impact we as a species are having on the surface of the planet — an inspection of the human systems we've imposed onto natural landscapes.Exhibitions include: Anthropocene (2018) at the Art Gallery of Ontario and National Gallery of Canada (international touring exhibition); Water (2013) at the New Orleans Museum of Art and Contemporary Art Center in Louisiana (international touring exhibition); Oil (2009) at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. (five-year international touring show), China (toured internationally from 2005 - 2008); Manufactured Landscapes at the National Gallery of Canada (toured from 2003 - 2005); and Breaking Ground produced by the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography (toured from 1988 - 1992). Edward's visually compelling works are currently being exhibited in solo and group exhibitions around the globe, including at London's Saatchi Gallery where his largest solo exhibition to-date, entitled Extraction/Abstraction, is currently on show until 6th May 2024.Edward's distinctions include the inaugural TED Prize (which he shared with Bono and Robert Fischell), the title of Officer of the Order of Canada, and the International Center of Photography's Infinity Award for Art. In 2018 Edward was named Photo London's Master of Photography and the Mosaic Institute's Peace Patron.

In 2020 he was awarded a Royal Photographic Society Honorary Fellowship and in 2022 was honoured with the Outstanding Contribution to Photography Award by the World Photography Organization. Most recently he was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and was named the 2022 recipient for the annual Pollution Probe Award. Edward currently holds eight honorary doctorate degrees and is represented by numerous international galleries all over the world. In episode 224, Edward discusses, among other things:His transition from film to digitalStaying positive by ‘moving through grief to land on meaning'Making compelling images and how scale creates ambiguityDefining the over-riding theme of his work early onThe environmental impact of farmingWhether he planned his careerWhy he started a lab to finance his photographyAnd how being an entrepreneur feeds into his work as an artistVertical IntegrationExamples of challenging situations he has facedThe necessity for his work to be commoditisedHis relative hope and optimism for the future through positive technologyThe importance of having a hopeful component to the workHow he offsets his own carbon footprint Referenced:Joel SternfeldEliiot PorterStephen ShoreJennifer BaichwalNicholas de Pencier Website | Instagram“The evocation of the sense of wonder and the sense of the surreal, or the improbable, or ‘what am I looking at?', to me is interesting in a time where images are so consumed; that these are not for quick consumption they're for… slow. And I think that when things reveal themselves slowly and in a more challenging way, they become more interesting as objects to leave in the world. That they don't just reveal themselves immediately, you can't just get it in one quick glance and you're done, no, these things ask you to look at them and spend time with them. And I discover things in them sometimes that I never saw before. They're loaded with information.” Become a full tier 1 member here to access exclusive additional subscriber-only content and the full archive of previous episodes for £5 per month.For the tier 2 archive-only membership, to access the full library of past episodes for £3 per month, go here.\n\nI am so excited to say that my guest on the GWA Podcast is one of the most renowned artists alive today, Doris Salcedo. Born in Colombia, where she is based today, Salcedo, is hailed for her mid to colossal-scale sculptures and public installations that push the boundary of the artform, while simultaneously addressing vital political narratives of Colombian history of conflict that also have the power to transcend both time and geographies. Salcedo challenges scale and perspective; materials and everyday objects, and although the physical breadth of her work might be extensive, humanity remains the centre of it – as she has said: “I address the experiences of those who dwell on the borders, on the periphery of life and in the depths of catastrophe.” By incorporating materials that speak to the presence of a human being – whether it be chairs, desks, shoes and more, or working with people and the names of the innocent people who have lost their lives – Salcedo's work points to absence, loss, memory. Works have ranged from slotting and stacking 1,500 chairs between two buildings on a street in Istanbul to filling domestic items with cement – creating an atmosphere of silence, of mourning. She has exhibited all over the world, in the most acclaimed institutions worldwide, and in 2007, she showed at Tate Modern with a work called Shibboleth, which saw her excavate a crack into the concrete ground, which is a work that could be viewed from multiple perspectives but which also – when not looking properly – could easily be missed. And it's this idea of looking in Salcedo's work that I find so interesting – because by getting us to look further, she gets us to question beyond our everyday experiences, what we witness in the media, the futile lines that divide this world, to ensure for a fairer and more equal society. -- THIS EPISODE IS GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED BY THE LEVETT COLLECTION: https://www.instagram.com/famm.mougins // https://www.merrellpublishers.com/9781858947037 ENJOY!!!
