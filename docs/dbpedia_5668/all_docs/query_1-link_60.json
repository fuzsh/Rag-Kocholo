        "meta_description": "As one of the most important contemporary art mega-projects in the world, the Documenta of Kassel is particularly suitable for examining the changes that have taken place in art and in the way it is presented in the artistic field. Back in 1955, political motivations played a part in the Documenta’s founding, but it was only in 1992, during its ninth edition edition, that Jan Hoet first criticised the hegemony of European and North American art (at the time, only 7% of the featured artists were from Africa, Asia and Oceania). And it was not until 1997 that, under the artistic directorship of Catherine David, this criticism were treated theoretically in the form of lectures. The first Documenta that can be regarded as postcolonial was held in 2002, with Enwezor taking charge as artistic director. In my paper, I will examine the shifts that have occurred in the way global art is represented in Kassel from Documenta 11, when the postcolonial discourse finally came to the fore, until the present day (Documenta 14). The questions I touch upon are whether there has been a strengthening of postcolonial representation; whether there is evidence of cultural decolonisation as cultural colonisation is dismantled that is, as postcolonial theories are put into practice; whether or not a decolonisation of art has taken place during the Documenta exhibitions; and whether there has been a change in the postcolonialist content of art. With respect to the knowledge generated by the exhibitions and the theories espoused by the documents – most of which were written to accompany the exhibitions –, I will investigate what has been implemented and how from three different perspectives: firstly, by taking into account the proportion of artists (by country of origin); secondly, via content analysis; and thirdly, from the perspective of the artistic canon.",

        "text": "“The big exhibition has no form.” Roger M. Buergel and Ruth Noack, curators of Documenta 12, begin their preface with these words in the Documenta Catalogue. While insisting on Documenta’s inherent formlessness, they arranged the exhibition of distinctive character to deal with provocative issues. Such contradictions are typical in the history of mega-exhibitions and that makes them all the more appealing. Being one of the most significant – if not the most significant – mega contemporary art projects of the world, the Kassel Documenta is pre-eminently suitable for studying the changes, the shifts in fine arts, or rather, in its representation and in the field of art – as formulated by Bourdieu. Political motivations (distancing from fascist and communist culture) date as far back as Documenta’s foundation in 1955, but it was only in 1992 that Jan Hoet, artistic director of the 9th Issue of Documenta, critiqued the hegemony of European and North American Art (only 7 percent of the invited artists came from Africa, Asia and Oceania in that year). In 1997, when Catherine David was artistic director, this issue was further elaborated theoretically (Okwui Enwezor, Edward W. Said, Matthew Ngui were, among other people, invited to present their papers). Finally, the first exhibition considered to be postcolonial was accomplished by Okwui Enwezor in 2002. In my paper I focus on the shifts of the representation of global art in Kassel from emergence of postcolonial discourse (from Documenta 11) up to the present (Documenta 14). This paper will also explore if the tendency of postcolonial representation became stronger; if one can really see cultural decolonialization as the practice of postcolonial theories; if the decolonialization of art occurred in the course of Documentas and whether the content of postcoloniality changed in the arts? I follow the Documenta exhibitions from the aspect of the proportions of the number of artists coming from different countries, carry out content analysis and finally I study the Documentas in question from the point of view of the canon.\n\nIn the following, I will analyse the changes in art in the last 15 years through the works of Documentas, from the point of view of postcolonialism and decoloniality – that is, whether there is any chance to dismantle colonial, western (and sexist) hegemony through culture or border thinking (WD. Mignolo). For the sake of clarity, it may be worth mentioning that both postcolonial discourse and decolonial thinking are critical theories of hegemonial western coloniality and colonialism. Since my intention is neither to merge nor to play off these two concepts against each other, I will only mention a few differences: postcoloniality emerged earlier (in the 1980’s with G. Ch. Spivak, Homi K. Bhabha, Achille Mbembe) and is linked to post-structuralism and at the beginning was also (geographically) connected to Asia and Africa. Decolonial thinking arose later, in Latin America. It has a more profound approach to colonialism (e.g. WD. Mignolo, A. Quijano), while also being anti-capitalist; de-westernization is also one of its key motives. In the context of the intense decolonization in political and military practice after World War II, writing in French on decolonization, Frantz Fanon (of African origin) was a forerunner of both postcoloniality and decoloniality, inasmuch as he saw and treated the cultural, economical, political, institutional and military aspects of colonialism interwoven. We might of course ask, if Documenta as a cultural institution of Geermany, the 4th strongest economy of the world, can be a “decolonialist” within the framework of global neoliberalism, when our social space consisting of disparate social networks is divided by borders \"that discriminate between ’those who circulate capital’ and ’those whom capital circultes’”? After all great international exhibitions (and as such Documenta too) ”follow the economic (read: corporate) and political interests that constitute and produce the ‘exhibitonary complex’ (per Tony Bennett), an apparatus correlative to the art world that strategically presents itself as self-evident, transparent reality—supposedly the only reality available to us.”1 Although Documenta cannot solve the question of capital, it can help us reflect on the problems, propose artistic questions, analyze, highlight features of existing colonialism, react and can show ways, inspire reflexions – particularly where artistic directors reflect on their own situation, the circumstances in which they work. For example, Adam Szymczyk, artistic director of the Documenta 14, constructed his project (artworks and texts) purposefully dealing with broader social contexts (including historical) and local conditions. In their first curatorial statement Adam Szymczyk and Quinn Latimer analysed the current situation as follows. “It [The Documenta Magazine] was produced during several months of a palpable worsening of the ongoing economic and humanitarian crisis in Greece.” They go on to say, “humanitarian crises escalated when 4 million Syrian Afghan, Iraqi and African refugees arrived in Europe, it was the greatest migration since the second world war and the first stop was Greece.”2 According to their intention, “Documenta 14 will attempt to deliver a real-time response to the changing situation of Europe, which, as a birthplace of both democracy and colonialism […] is also a plea for imagining and elaborating on the possibilities of a different, more inclusive world, one that appears unattainable in the light of current political and economic developments and the unmasked violence they bring about.”3\n\nColonization, due to the similar patterns of using power, relates to other suppressing structures (racism, nationalism, sexism). Thus, representation of the many different types of inequality affects decolonization and at the same time decolonization brings up other inequalities and discrimination, though does not eliminate them.\n\nDocumenta 11, directed by Okwui Enwezor in 2002, is considered to be the first postcolonial Documenta. This is proclaimed on the official homepage of the Documenta,5 and this intention is supported by the chief curator’s statement and other studies,5 as well as the fact that the cluster of exhibitions in Kassel was only one of the Documenta events organized worldwide: 1. Democracy unrealized – a conference in Vienna and lectures in Berlin; 2. Experiments with truth: Transnational Justice and the process of Truth and Reconciliation – conference, film and video programs in New Delhi; 3. Creolité and Creolization – workshops in Saint Lucia; 4. Under Siege. Four African cities(Freetown, Johannesburg, Kinshasa, Lagos) – conference and workshops in Lagos.6 In his study with the telling title The Black Box, Enwezor explains that after thorough analysis of contemporary art and visual culture we have to realize that the visual arts can only be understood in the context of such other moving factors that go beyond the disciplinary borders of todays art production. Art objects as such do not exist outside the system of art, they have no autonomy outside the context of exhibitions. On the other hand, there are methods manifested in social, political and cultural networks which in turn mark out the outline and horizon of global discourse and give a different context to the projects than did Documenta 11. So the forums of Enwezor’s Documenta7 were dedicated to the ethical and intellectual processes of rethinking of historical events and phenomena, which help the elaboration of the controversial heritage of the past.8 Enwezor himself, in one of the chapters of his study entitled”What is an Avant-Garde today? The postcolonial aftermath of globalization and the terrible nearness of distant places”, argues for a committed avant-garde art and decolonizing as a liberating strategy.9\n\nIn critiques on Documenta, voices appeared in protection of Western culture, Niklas Maak quotes several of these, for example the author of the Washington Post”the deep loathing of the global left for our country”10 and Yugo Hasegawa, who, visiting the exhibition, felt that although it helped widen the horizons, it was like visiting Cultural Studies lessons of an American or British university.11 According to another critical opinion, the exhibition “outlines a radical trans-disciplinary, trans-cultural and trans-generational method for escaping the mediocrity of most what the art world has to offer these days”.12 Examples of Barbara Steiner proved to herself that “...every aesthetic space is certainly imbued with political, economic and social factors, but that is also offers a ’space for play and resistance’”.13\n\nEuropean artists sensed the beginning of demolition of the neocolonist world. The question of “many” or “few” calls attention to numbers: indeed, compared to the exhibition ten years before, when North American and (Western) European artists made up 90 percent of the exhibitors, in 2002 they made up 79 percent of the exhibitors (yet the only three artists from Eastern Europe were Pavel Brăila, Arthur Żmijewski and Sanja Iveković). The number of African artists increased from 0.5(!) percent to 8 percent, Asians from 6.6 to 7.5 percent, South Americans from 3 to 5 percent. This change may be considered as significant or insignificant (with the proportion of “the rest” growing from 10 percent to 21 percent); however, the shift is apparent and also the fact that the dominance of the “first world” remained. The tendency of decolonization expressible in numbers continued in 2007. The proportion of Euro-Atlantic participants further decreased (59 percent), Asians increased significantly (24 percent) and to some extent the presence of Africa and South America (9 percent and 8 percent, respectively). However, the 2017 figures again show a high percentage of North-American and European participation, though this backslide was mainly due to the fact that for the first time there were more artists from Eastern Europe (17 percent) and “Learning from Athen” being the motto there were many Greek artists present (20 percent) – and this also points to decolonization even if the number of African artists decreased from 9 to 8 percent and the number of South American artist from 8 to 7 percent, but this is not really significant compared with the decrease of Asian presence. While in 2007 they made up 24 percent of all exhibitors, this figure was a mere 13 percent in 2017. It seems that the decrease of Asian presence was the price of the increase in Eastern and Southern Europeans. However, it was really remarkable that unlike previous editions there was not one single Japanese artist in the show and even more conspicuous was the subsequent, gradual decrease of North American artists – from 31 percent in 1992 to 9 percent in 2017.\n\nThe presentation of the explicit post-colonialist intention and decolonist art practices that had been initiated in 2002 was not an explicit aim of the Documenta in 2007. However, it continued the trend both in respect of numbers and the themes exposed.14 Curators this time broke away from the tradition of exhibiting exclusively contemporary works. They presented creations from global art history from the 15th century on and this trend was followed in the Documenta 13 and 14 as well. Historicism in the Documenta 12 was a decidedly decolonizing practice inasmuch as it “discovered” (for the West) earlier Modernisms of the World (Nasreen Mohamedi, Běla Kolářová) and Neomodernist artworks (Iole de Freitas) and all this on the pretext of the question “Is modernity our antiquity?” – which really sounds like an ivory-tower sort of a question. Artworks selected in keeping with the other guideline of the exhibition, “bare life”, as formulated by Agamben, also referred implicitly to decolonization (Sonia Abián Rose, Amar Kanwar, Churchill Madikida).\n\nIn 2012 Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev – judging from the works exhibited – continued the decolonizing endeavour. She also hosted exhibitions outside Kassel and organized seminars in Kabul, Bámiyan, Alexandria, Cairo and Banff. The question itself whether this (neo)colonist expansion of the Documenta was really cultural colonization or true decolonization, is laden with issues, which also came up during previous Documentas and during the realization of Szymczyk’s 2017 concept “Learning from Athens”. Documenta 14 was decidedly dedicated to decolonizing. Its Magazine advocated this by saying, “work[s] against the politics of forgetting—forgetfulness of the history of colonialism and mass enslavement and displacement that brought us here, to our collective contemporary world; and forgetfulness of the dissident histories and peoples that have often been left out of the Western canon.”15 “In the current process of decolonization, memories of itineraries of the enslaved, migrants and refugees are reactivated against new politics of forgetfulness. Memory here is not the realm of subjective fleeting thought but a source of images, texts and songs that constitute a counter hegemonic library for present battles.”1 What can be learnt from Athens and which one? From the ancient Greeks or modern Greeks? Or the ideal which – among other people – German scientists and artists from Hegel to Heidegger looked upon with colonizing and at the same time admiring eyes? Though the curators declared, “…we will insist on ‘learning from Athens’ not as from the cradle of Western civilization but as a place where the contradictions of the contemporary world, embodied by loaded directional’s like East and West, North and South, meet and clash”,16 the emblem of this Documenta, apart from the owl of Athena, was the Parthenon – albeit only as a “copy” erected in Kassel. Having Documenta staged in two cities – though it intended as part of a decolonizing practice, the two places were supposedly equal, real as well as metaphoric – was nevertheless just as much about fixing borders (or at least making them more obvious) as it was about decolonizing. The improvements of infrastructures helped Athens a bit and many Greek artists, who could not show their work before, now could take part in a Documenta, but this extension really favoured only the wealthier parts of the world – who could afford to visit both venues? Moreover, as Nuit Banai pointed out when travelling from Athens to Kassel, “...multiple security checkpoints and teams of polizei were in place, gesturing to current anxieties about ’protecting’ the contempt European demos from migrants and the spectre of terrorism[…] the nation-state superseded Documenta’s attempt to enable a ’presentist demoracy” […] trumped the more inclusive notion of the people...”.17\n\nAthens artists expressed their discontent in an open letter2,3 and the graffiti in the city – Earning on Athens. Dear Documenta: I refuse to exoticize myself to increase your cultural capital – visualized the tension between one of the strongest economies of the world and one of the weakest in Europe. On the other hand, taking artworks from the National Museum of Contemporary Art of Athens to Kassel is doubtful, because as Birnbaum points out with neocolonist contempt, it made possible for us to see “mildly interesting Greek Conceptualism” and “If there’s a point, beyond the symbolic gesture of filling the space of Germany’s oldest public museum with Greek property, it is one the organizers have made by accident...”18 (italics mine), but because these artworks, without having their context properly outlined, were really lost in the rooms of Fridericianum. However, according to Nuit Banai, “The show […] updates the mega-exhibition’s historical status as a frontier and bellwether of Western humanism for contemporary conditions of neoliberal global capitalism”.19 The extension of borders of Documenta in the direction of Greece demanded the dissolution of many other borders, like between East and West and North and South. ”This is Documenta’s humanist strain which it simultaneously asserts, challenges and mourns by assimilating the border into its form, as a site of both maximum agency and utter impotence.”20\n\nIn Documenta exhibitions decolonialist artistic practices are manifested in the artworks. Many different approaches are possible: works focusing on decoloniziation, or coming from a decolonist way of thinking; or the context created by the curator leads to decolonist readings. When in her performance21a breathless Regina José Galindo is running in front of a tank for 18 minutes (and endlessly in the video loop), she not only refers to the perils of war but also the frenzy fed by permanent threat, which is known by those who living on borders, who belong neither to this country, area, or culture, nor the other. If they are lucky, they are related to both.22 Emily Jacir’s work4 presents this very situation from the point of view of intersectionality, in her army tent embroidered with text (also shown in Documenta 14) which had all the names of Palestinian villages occupied or destroyed by the State of Israel in 1948 and also his film Continuity by Omer Fast23 projected at the Documenta 13.\n\n1Editors’ Letter by Quinn Latimer, Adam Szymczyk.
