Pootle, Perkin, Posie, Ma and Pa Flump and Grandpa Flump all became real characters thanks to her tremendously talented acting.\n\nBut though kids of the 70s remember the Flumps fondly, there was actually only 13 episodes in total.\n\nHere Gay tells Ashley where The Flumps came from and how she came up with their voices, developed their characters and navigated a tremendously created script written by Julie Holder.\n\nPresented and produced by Ashley Byrne. Research by Andrew Edwards\n\nContinuity: Andy Hoyle and Jonathan Kydd.\n\nA Made in Manchester Production.\n\nDistinct Nostalgia costs money and time to make and we'd welcome your support through Patreon.
