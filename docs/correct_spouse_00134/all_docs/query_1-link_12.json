        "text": "The Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre (ALC) has concluded its successful participation in the 30th Beijing International Book Fair, held in the Chinese capital from 19 to 23 June 2024, where it showcased its most prominent projects and initiatives in various fields of publishing, translation, knowledge, and literature.\n\nThe Centre shed light on its role in supporting the translation movement to and from Arabic through its flagship Kalima Project for Translation – the most prominent of its kind in the Arab world – as well as on its contributions to publishing and authorship through the Esdarat programme, which has produced hundreds of Arabic books. The ALC also highlighted the range of exhibitions, festivals, conferences, and activities it organises that centre around books, language, and creative industries.\n\nThroughout the course of the Fair, the Centre offered a comprehensive programme, in an effort to enhance cooperation in the creative industries and enrich the cultures of both nations through joint projects that enable the establishment of valuable intellectual and cultural systems. Some of the most notable events in the programme included a seminar titled ‘Between Arabic and Chinese: Language and Cultural Communication’, in collaboration with the China International Communications Group (CICG), setting the stage for the comprehensive cooperation protocol signed between the two parties.\n\nThe seminar was attended by His Excellency Hussain Al Hammadi, UAE Ambassador to China; H.E. Prof. Dr. Jamal Sanad Al Suwaidi, Vice President of the Board of Trustees of the Emirates Centre for Strategic Studies and Research; H.E. Dr. Ali bin Tamim, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre; H.E. Khaled Al Shehhi, Deputy Chief of the UAE Mission to China, and Gao Anming, Vice President and Editor-in-Chief of the China International Communications Group.\n\nALC Chairman H.E. Dr. Ali bin Tamim signed an agreement with CICG to launch the China Academic Books series in Arabic. The signing ceremony was organised by the Foreign Language Press and the China Centre for Contemporary World Studies. The agreement aims to enhance communication between different cultures, in line with the vision of the wise leadership in the UAE and its capital, Abu Dhabi.\n\nH.E. bin Tamim said: “The Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre strives to achieve the ambitious vision of the UAE’s wise leadership to disseminate Arab culture, build bridges of communication with communities around the world, and establish partnerships in all fields related to language and culture to serve the present and future of humanity.”\n\n“Over the past decade, Abu Dhabi has consistently participated in the Beijing International Book Fair, becoming the most regular Arab participant,” H.E. added. “Meanwhile, the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair hosted more than 190 Chinese publishing houses over its last four editions, making it the most attractive international destination for Chinese publishers. Indeed, Chinese participation in the most recent session of the Fair was the largest in the country’s history of participation in global events.”\n\n“We must work harder to make language a foundation for developing cultural industries, exchanging knowledge, and spreading it among people around the world. It also critical that we recognise the importance of focusing on technology and artificial intelligence, steering these breakthroughs towards achieving sustainability in human values and enhancing multiculturalism,” H.E. bin Tamim concluded.\n\nOther ALC activities at the fair included the launch of the Chinese edition of ‘His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan: Insights into the Journey of the Man of Humanity’ in the presence of its author, H.E. Dr. Jamal Sanad Al-Suwaidi. The book focuses on His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and sheds light on various aspects of his exceptional journey.\n\nH.E. Hussain Al Hammadi, UAE Ambassador to China, said: “This year, we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, which have succeeded in building a strong strategic partnership based on the solid foundations of shared values, common interests, mutual respect, and commitment to supporting the development and prosperity of both nations.”\n\n“Through cultural communication, we can transcend geographical borders and language differences, and through literary arts and music, we discover the common grounds that bind us together,” H.E. Al Hammadi continued. “The UAE Embassy in Beijing is committed to supporting cultural communication between the Arab world and China, including supporting the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre, which is at the forefront of institutions specialising in teaching the Arabic language to non-native speakers.”\n\nThe ALC's agenda for the fair also included a panel discussion that brought together prominent researchers, namely Farida Wang Fu, recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award in Translation in China; Zhao Lijun, Director of the China Today magazine publishing house; Wang Jun Xiao, Secretary-General of the China Cultural Publishing House; Ahmed Al Saeed, CEO of Bayt Elhekma for Creative Industries, which is a recipient of the Sheikh Zayed Book Award; and Dr. Berlant Qabeel, Programmes Section Head at the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre.\n\nFurthermore, ALC Chairman H.E. Dr. Ali bin Tamim attended the professional meeting to explore opportunities for cooperation between Chinese and Arab publishers, where he stated that translation plays a critical role in fostering understanding between peoples and bringing cultures closer together, stressing that when translating, it is imperative to respect the value systems of the cultures involved.\n\nMeanwhile, the ALC delegation visited the China National Academy of Painting, run by the Ministries of Culture and Tourism in Beijing. The two sides exchanged information about their respective institutions, exploring opportunities for collaboration. Officials from the Academy expressed interest in participating in the Centre’s events, most notably the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair and the Arabian Days festival.\n\nFor his part, Gao Anming, Vice President and Editor-in-Chief of the China International Communications Group (CICG), said: “I visited the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre in September and explored its efforts to promote exchange between different cultures through language. Over the course of an entire year, the CICG Centre for Europe and Africa cooperated with the ALC, achieving notable results.”\n\nGao Anming went on to note that “With the Centre’s support, our Group participated in the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair 2024, which hosted a conference to present the Arabic edition of President Xi Jinping’s book ‘The Belt and Road Initiative’. Furthermore, China Today magazine launched the ‘China’s Intangible Cultural Heritage’ pavilion, allowing Arab audiences to enjoy the charm of Chinese culture.”\n\n“As the oldest and largest comprehensive media institution in China,” he continued, “the China International Communications Group recognises the importance of language as a vehicle for culture and a symbol of civilisation. By translating and publishing Arabic works, readers can learn about the Arab world’s rich cultural heritage. Similarly, translating and publishing Chinese works allows us to introduce the world to the modern China.”\n\nAnming outlined three areas for cooperation with the ALC, the first of which is deepening collaboration with the Centre to introduce and translate outstanding foreign cultural and literary works, in addition to presenting notable Chinese works to international audiences, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and respect between different cultures.\n\nThe second area of collaboration is organising art exhibitions, reading clubs, cultural seminars, and meetings with authors, while the third and final area consists of training talented professionals who master multiple languages and cultures in order to enhance cultural exchange between China and Arab countries, support language education, and strengthen intercultural communication skills among language learners.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre (ALC) organised a seminar titled ‘Between Arabic and Chinese: Language and Cultural Communication’, in collaboration with the China International Communications Group (CICG), as part of its participation in the 30th Beijing International Book Fair, held in the Chinese capital from 19 to 23 June 2024.\n\nThe Centre has prepared a comprehensive programme for the Fair, in an effort to enhance cooperation in the fields of creative industries and enrich the cultures of both peoples through joint projects that serve to build valuable intellectual and cultural systems.\n\nHis Excellency Dr. Ali bin Tamim, Chairman of the ALC, said: “The Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre strives to achieve the ambitious vision of the UAE’s wise leadership to revive Arab civilisation, build bridges of communication with cultures around the world, and establish partnerships in all fields related to language and culture to serve the present and future of humanity.”\n\n“Over the past decade, Abu Dhabi has consistently participated in the Beijing International Book Fair, becoming the most regular Arab participant,” H.E. added. “Meanwhile, the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair hosted more than 190 Chinese publishing houses over its last four editions, making it the most attractive international destination for Chinese publishers.

Dr. Ali bin Tamim, Chairman of ALC and Secretary-General of the Sheikh Zayed Book Award; Abdulrahman Mohamed Al-Naqbi, Director of the ALC’s Literary Awards Department; H.E. Omar Obaid Alshamsi, Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the Kingdom of Spain; H.E. Hala Keyrouz, Ambassador of Lebanon to Spain; H.E. Khalifa Al Kharafi, Kuwaiti Ambassador to Spain; H.E. Raghad Al Saqqa, Ambassador of Jordan to Spain; H.E. Zeineb Ely Salem, Ambassador of Mauritania to Spain; H.E. Abdullah Hallak, Chargé d'Affaires of the Syrian Embassy in Spain; and `H.E. Hisham Nouri, from the cultural attaché of the Yemeni Embassy in Spain`. A select group of Arab and Spanish academics, authors, and literary figures were also in attendance.\n\nH.E. Saood Abdulaziz Al Hosani, Undersecretary of DCT Abu Dhabi, said: “Our collaboration with Casa Árabe in Madrid to hold the ‘Arabian Nights’ conference is part of Abu Dhabi's endeavours to develop platforms that bring together different peoples and cultures around the world, fostering bridges of dialogue based on tolerance, understanding, respect and acceptance of others' cultures. Through these conferences, we also aim to promote and disseminate the Arabic language, introducing its literature, heritage and cultural and civilisational legacy.”\n\nH.E. Dr. Ali bin Tamim, Chairman of ALC and Secretary-General of the Sheikh Zayed Book Award, said: “The Sheikh Zayed Book Award is dedicated to upholding the values of tolerance, dialogue, and cooperation among various cultures and peoples around the world, enriching the cultural landscape. Spain served as the inaugural destination for our ‘Arabian Nights’ conference, and will be followed by two additional stops in Japan and the United Kingdom, reflecting our continuous efforts to promote and disseminate Arab culture internationally. We hope this conference inspires more thinkers, researchers, translators and students, encouraging them to delve deeper into Arab culture. We also aim to contribute to cultural communication with Spain, building bridges of communication and understanding between peoples.’\n\nIrene Lozano Domingo, General Director of Casa Árabe Foundation, said: “At Casa Árabe, we are very happy to be able to work together with one of the most important cultural institution in the Gulf region. Organising this seminar dedicated to ‘Arabian Nights’ is just one more example of our close collaboration and good harmony. The alliance with SZBA allows us to reinforce our presence as a Spanish institution of public diplomacy in the region, thus contributing to building bridges and improving understanding between our societies.”\n\nWith its enduring tales, stories, and characters, ‘Arabian Nights’ stands as a testament to human creativity, enriching world literature and serving as a bridge between Arab culture and others, particularly bridging East and West. It was translated into numerous international languages and inspired countless writers, artists, and poets, becoming a timeless human heritage passed down through generations. The work continues to be studied, critiqued, and analysed till today across the East and the West.\n\nThe conference coincided with the Madrid International Book Fair, providing an opportunity for communication and cultural exchange among the participating dignitaries.\n\nThe conference hosted a panel discussion on ‘The Influence of the Arabian Nights in Spain’, featuring distinguished renowned researchers and specialists including: Luis Alberto de Cuenca, a renowned writer, poet, critic, translator and academic, who twice served as the Secretary of Culture of Spain and former Director of the National Library, and was a laureate in 2015 of the National Poetry Award. He delivered a special keynote at the conference.\n\nThe list also included Paulo Lemos Horta, Assistant Professor of Literature at NYU Abu Dhabi, who has published extensive research on ‘Arabian Nights’ and recently edited a new annotated edition translated by Yasmine Seale; Salvador Peña Martín, Professor of Arabic Language and Translation at the University of Malaga, who has also taught at the universities of Baghdad, Leeds, Granada, Tetouan, and Castilla-La Mancha. His previous writings focused on the reception of ‘Arabian Nights’ in Spain, and in 2017, he received the National Translation Prize of Spain for his Spanish translation of ‘Arabian Nights’.\n\nMounira Soliman, Professor of English at Cairo University, was also on the panel; she co-edited Popular Culture in the Middle East and North Africa: A Postcolonial Outlook (2013), in which she explored the fantasy of ‘Arabian Nights’ in Western culture. And lastly, Desirée López Bernal, Senior Professor in the Department of Semitic Studies at the University of Granada, where she teaches subjects related to classical Arabic literature and the transmission of Arabic literature to European literatures. Her research revolves around these two thematic axes, and she is the author of several studies on the trace of Arabic storytelling in Spanish and European written literature and oral tradition. She is currently participating in a research project titled ‘The corpus of oral narrative in the western Mediterranean basin: comparative study and digital edition’.\n\nMeanwhile, Iraqi visual artist Hanoos Hanoos delivered an audiovisual presentation, drawing from his recent exhibition Shahrazad and the Arabian Nights. Hanoos Hanoos is a painter and modern art teacher. He has held more than 50 national and international exhibitions and has won 35 painting awards. He has been widely celebrated in Spain for his fostering of cultural links between the country and the Arab world. His works inspired by Arabian Nights have been displayed at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Madrid.\n\nThe conference concluded its programme with a concert by world-renowned Lebanese artist Abeer Nehme, celebrating the strength and enduring nature of cultural ties between Spain and the Arab world. In addition to her career as a singer and composer, Abeer works to facilitate cultural and musical dialogue within the Arab world and beyond. During the concert, she was accompanied by a Spanish band presenting a musical performance of Andalusian muwashahat and other songs that celebrated both Arab and Spanish cultures.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates and the People’s Republic of China enjoy strong bilateral relations that have spanned decades. The historic visit of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Founding Father of the UAE, to Beijing in May 1990 marked the first visit by a leader from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to China. This visit ushered in a new phase of cooperation between the two countries and laid the foundation for their robust cultural relations.\n\nDuring this visit, it was decided to establish the Emirates Centre for the Arabic Language and Islamic Studies, which has served as a key channel for civilisational and cultural communication between the Chinese and Arab peoples since its opening in 1994. The Centre continues to receive ongoing support from the UAE, encouraged by the deep-seated bilateral relations between the two countries, which continue to grow with mutual visits from officials of both countries.\n\nOn that note, China was Guest of Honour at the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair (ADIBF) in 2017, an exceptional edition that marked a significant milestone in the history of cultural exchange between the two countries. The Fair featured 120 cultural and artistic events, welcoming a Chinese delegation of more than 300 participants, and showcasing more than a thousand books.\n\nThe UAE-China cultural cooperation, now spearheaded by the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre (ALC), has made significant strides, growing stronger and setting ever deeper roots. Over the past five years, the ADIBF has topped the list of Arab exhibitions with the highest number of Chinese participants, becoming the only exhibition for which Chinese Government agencies issue circulars to encourage Chinese publishers and companies to participate.\n\nFor its part, Abu Dhabi has consistently participated in the Beijing International Book Fair (BIBF) over the past 10 years, becoming the most regular Arab participant.\n\nOrganised by the ALC, the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair has hosted some of China’s most renowned and influential authors, recipients of the prestigious Mao Dun Literature Prize, often referred to as the Chinese Nobel. Moreover, the Book Fair has seen the launch of more than 100 Chinese titles translated into Arabic in recent years, while in the last four editions alone, the exhibition welcomed over 190 Chinese publishing houses and more than 200 publishers, writers, and officials, who have participated in the Fair, either in-person or through representatives. This number represents one-third of all publishing houses in China, making ADIBF the most attractive international destination for Chinese publishers.\n\nIn an unprecedented move among Arab capitals, Abu Dhabi witnessed the launch of the Arabic editions of two books authored by Chinese President Xi Jinping: ‘The Governance of China’ in 2018, and ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ in 2024.\n\nIn the last three years, reports have indicated that the activities of the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair were covered in Chinese media more than 170 times, making it the most prominently featured event in Chinese media. This coverage set the stage for a dedicated report about the UAE in the official Chinese news broadcast, aired by over 100 Chinese channels and watched by more than a billion viewers.\n\nThe report followed the ALC’s success in hosting a seminar to present the Arabic edition of President Xi Jinping’s book, as part of the ADIBF 2024 agenda, in collaboration with the China Media Group and the Chinese Embassy in the UAE. The segment covered the seminar, highlighting the UAE’s pivotal role in the Belt and Road Initiative, and broadcasting promotional tourism scenes about Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre boasts the largest number of joint cooperation protocols with Chinese cultural and media entities, most notably the comprehensive cooperation protocols with the China Media Group and the Beijing International Book Fair.\n\nThe official BIBF website ranks His Excellency Dr. Ali bin Tamim, Chairman of the ALC, among the seven most important international guests in the field of publishing and culture at last year’s Fair, and in addition to that, more than 10 conferences on Arab-Chinese cooperation in culture, publishing, and advertising have been organised under the Centre’s patronage both in Beijing and Abu Dhabi.\n\nOn the same note, the Centre collaborated with the China Media Group to launch the Arab-Chinese Cooperation Centre for Publishing and Culture, the first Chinese-Arab platform serving the publishing sector in the two countries, while most recently, the China Publishing Association, Beijing International Book Fair, and China Publishers Group participated in the ADIBF Professional Programme.\n\nAnd marking the first Arab recognition of efforts in the field of Arab-Chinese cultural exchange, the House of Wisdom Group for Cultural Industries was granted the world-renowned Sheikh Zayed Book Award (SZBA) in the Publishing and Technology category. In 2011, the SZBA chose late Chinese orientalist Chung Jikun as the Cultural Personality of the Year.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of exchanging publishing and translations rights, more than 300 agreements have been signed between Chinese and Arab publishers at the ADIBF over the past three years.\n\nAdding to that, and as part of the Centre’s efforts to enhance Arab-Chinese cultural cooperation, the ALC Chairman made official visits to Renmin University of China, Peking University, Beijing Foreign Studies University, the Sheikh Zayed Centre in Beijing, the Chinese Ministry of Publicity, and the China Media Group, further strengthening Abu Dhabi’s cultural standing among Chinese intellectuals and officials.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi International Book Fair received high praise from various parties in China, with Chinese publishers describing it in media interviews as “the foremost Arab destination for Arab-Chinese cultural cooperation, a promising market for cultural industries, and a global platform for professional exchange in the field of publishing.”\n\nOver the course of the past year, the Centre welcomed high-level visiting officials, including the Chinese Vice Minister of Publicity (ministerial level) and two Vice Presidents of the China Media Group, paving the way for unprecedented Chinese participation in the ADIBF and more robust Emirati-Chinese cultural collaboration.\n\nChina’s unprecedented participation in this year’s ADIBF reflected the notable and growing Arab-Chinese rapprochement, now centred in the UAE, which underlines the Emirates’ pioneering role in bringing cultures together, while highlighting China’s significant interest in Arab culture and audiences, to whom it aims to present its culture. This, in turn, creates a positive environment for more translations between Arabic and Chinese, and provides additional opportunities for communicating Arab knowledge to a major country the size of China.\n\nThe substantial Chinese participation also extended the impact of the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair beyond the region to the global level, solidifying its position as a leading book fair on the world stage. It also paved the way for the launch of sustainable cultural and professional projects between Abu Dhabi and Beijing.\n\nContinuing on this communication-centred approach, a delegation from the ALC, headed by H.E. Dr. Ali bin Tamim, will visit the Beijing International Book Fair, which launches on 19 June. The visit underscores China’s importance to the Centre, paving the way for new collaborations that serve all of its sectors and meet its strategic objectives, in line with the UAE’s foreign policy of openness to world cultures, which further enhances Abu Dhabi’s international cultural standing and promotes the Arabic language globally.\n\nDuring this visit, the ALC will sign a strategic cooperation protocol with the China Media Group, a leading cultural and media entity and the primary official body in China, in charge of international cooperation in the fields of language, culture, publishing, media, and studies. The Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre will be the first Arab entity to sign such a protocol with the Group.\n\nMoreover, the visit will include professional meetings with major Chinese publishing houses and officials responsible for the publishing and cultural sectors in China, in an effort to promote the Centre’s initiatives, such as the Kalima Project for Translation, as well as the awards it offers and the book fairs it organises.\n\nAlso on the agenda for the visit is a seminar – the first of its kind to be held in China – titled ‘The Arabic Language and Civilisational Communication’, which will be organised during the visit and is set to be attended by senior Chinese officials and dignitaries.\n\nFurthermore, and in recognition of the ALC’s regional influence and status, H.E. bin Tamim will be participating as keynote speaker in an international conference held on the sidelines of the Beijing International Book Fair. The visiting delegation will explore the latest technologies in the fields of publishing, artificial intelligence, and content, inviting leading Chinese entities to its International Congress of Arabic Publishing and Creative Industries (PCI).\n\nThe visit aims to introduce influential Chinese players to the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre’s various departments and areas of work, explore opportunities for cooperation, and open new prospects for collaboration between the Centre’s various departments and their Chinese counterparts.\n\n“The United Arab Emirates has led an exceptional experience in comprehensive digital transformation,” asserted His Excellency Dr. Ali bin Tamim, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre (ALC), at the Jordan Forum for Media and Digital Communication, organised by the Jordanian Ministry of Government Communication.\n\nThe Forum was held under the patronage of H.E. Bisher Khasawneh, Prime Minister of Jordan, amid wide Arab and international media coverage. The event was inaugurated by the Minister of Government Communication of Jordan on Tuesday, 21 May 2024.\n\nRepresenting the ALC at the Forum, H.E. bin Tamim went on to note: “The UAE approaches the matter as a means to make people’s lives easier, adhere to best practices, and provide outstanding services, all in a bid to promote happiness, an objective that the wise leadership holds in the highest regard.”\n\nCulture and the Arabic language are top priorities in the UAE’s digital transformation plans, H.E. explained, noting that this “falls under the wise leadership’s vision to advance and ensure the sustainability of the cultural and creative sectors, in a bid to strengthen their role as part of our ambitious efforts to invest in people, which in turn is a focus of all UAE development strategies.”\n\n“The Arabic language is a leading marker of cultural identity for the Emirati people, and holds a wealth of values, science, knowledge, and creativity,” H.E. bin Tamim continued. “The language is facing major challenges in the modern era, especially with the rapid developments in technology, advances in artificial intelligence, and the evolving channels for acquiring knowledge and science – all of which are challenges that require attention, preparation, and effort.”\n\n“There are undoubtedly many initiatives and projects that serve this goal in various Arab countries,” H.E. said. “There isn’t enough time to discuss all of them, however, it should be noted that the UAE has led an exceptional experience in comprehensive digital transformation, approaching the matter as a means to make people’s lives easier, adhere to best practices, and provide outstanding services. We, at the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre, are part of this advanced ecosystem, designed to ensure the sustainability of the cultural and creative sector, drive it forward, and enhance the presence of the Arabic language – the most prominent component of cultural identity.”\n\nThe ALC Chairman shed light on a range of the Centre’s projects and initiatives, launched to enhance the presence of the Arabic language and culture in the digital era, most notably, the Poetry Encyclopaedia, Kanz Al Jeel poetry collection, the digital transformation initiative, Spotlight on Rights, BAREC Readability project, the ALC digital Dictionar, and the Poetic Intelligence Lab, among others.\n\nThese projects were designed around a set of objectives to enrich the Arabic language with technology and enrich technology with Arabic content, H.E. explained, affirming that the Arabic language is rich in science, knowledge, art, and literature, yet these treasures are not available in a format suitable for the digital era. “Arabic needs to master the language of this digital era, just as the digital era needs the richness of the Arabic language.”\n\nThe Jordan Forum for Media and Digital Communication was held in celebration of the silver jubilee of King Abdullah II’s accession to the throne and the 78th anniversary of the independence of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Over the course of two days and eight sessions that brought together 30 Jordanian, Arab, and international speakers, the Forum discussed topics related to the challenges facing Arab media and communication sectors in light of rapid technological and digital advancements. Attendees sought to brainstorm innovative solutions to enhance ethics and freedom in media, keeping pace with advancements in the field of digital media and communication.\n\nThe Arabic Language and Global Cultural Development\n\nThe first International Scientific Forum, organised by the Language Centre at the Jordan University of Science and Technology, welcomed Dr. Ali bin Tamim as a guest of honour and key participant in the Forum’s activities, which, over the course of two days, included several panel discussions and lectures delivered by experts in the fields of language, literature, translation, and language technology. Participants discussed a range of important topics, including the role of translation in transferring knowledge between cultures, the challenges of teaching Arabic to non-native speakers, and the impact of digital technology on the spread of the Arabic language.\n\nIn his opening speech, H.E. bin Tamim applauded the Forum’s efforts to discuss the status and role of the Arabic language in the global cultural system, as well as its future prospects. “This role intersects with our efforts at the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre to advance the presence of the Arabic language and instill it among the new generations, enabling them to benefit from its authentic and exceptional knowledge covering various aspects of life,” he said.\n\nThe ALC Chairman participated in a session titled ‘The Role of the Arabic Language in Global Cultural Development: Reality and Aspirations’, where he stressed the importance of continuing efforts to preserve the Arabic language, keep it within its authentic and development-oriented domain, and strengthen its presence in contemporary culture. “This is achievable,” he asserted, “provided that effective strategies are followed, most notably to promote linguistic and literary creativity by supporting writers, poets, and creators to produce outstanding artistic and literary works in Arabic. Equally important is encouraging the use of Arabic in various fields of literature and arts, and supporting the development of technology, software, and applications that enhance the use of Arabic in science, technology, and everyday life.”\n\nMoreover, H.E. bin Tamim stressed the importance of supporting the production of digital content in Arabic, focusing on specialised websites, applications, and other digital platforms., He also called for the development of educational programmes that focus on comprehensive learning and mastery of the Arabic language, including among non-native speakers. He also underlined the need to enhance cultural exchange by organising cultural, literary, and artistic events that promote the Arabic language as an integral part of human heritage.\n\nOrganised by the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre (ALC), the third edition of the International Congress of Arabic Publishing and Creative Industries (PCI) is preparing to host prominent figures in publishing, translation, digital content production, and entrepreneurship from around the world on Sunday, 28 April 2024, at Manarat Al Saadiyat in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe event aims to explore the latest trends shaping the publishing and creative industries, as well as new opportunities for growth and collaboration in this field.\n\nThe Congress is the first of its kind in the Arab world and seeks to facilitate dialogue among thought leaders, publishers, content creators, and entrepreneurs across diverse creative disciplines.

We congratulate this year’s winners and invite all creators to participate in the next edition of the Award, offering them the opportunity to make their contribution towards enriching the wider cultural scene.”\n\nThe winner of the Literature category of the Award is Egyptian writer Reem Bassiouney for her novel ‘Al Halwani...Thulathiyat al-Fatimiyeen’ (Al Halwani: The Fatimid Trilogy), published by Nahdet Misr Publishing, Printing and Distribution in 2022. Bassiouney is working on a project to write historical novels about Egypt in the Middle Ages, where she seeks to shed light on the Egyptian character with narratives that intertwine poetry, architecture, and mythology, while underscoring the human dimension. The author works to construct the narrative of historical and social development in Egypt in that era, using a narrative tone that aligns with the nature of that extended historical period and its intellectual and social dimensions.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Houssem Eddine Chachia from Tunisia won the SZBA in the Young Author category for his work ‘Al Mashhad al-Moriski: Sardiyat al-Tard fi al-Fikr al-Espani’ (The Morisco Landscape Narratives of Expulsion in Modern Spanish Thought), issued by the Centre for Research and Knowledge Intercommunication in 2023. The work sheds light on the expulsion of the Moriscos who had remained in Spain, addressing its socio-cultural dimensions, and exploring the relation between memory and historic identity. The researcher makes a notable effort in investigating and documenting facts, while ensuring analytical and critical presentation. The study presents historical material documented in Spanish on the subject, offering an interdisciplinary historical study into civilisations and their relationships from a scientific perspective.\n\nThe Editing of Arabic Manuscripts category saw Dr. Mustafa Said from Egypt win for his study titled ‘Safinat al-Mulk wa-Nafisat al-Fulk (Shehab al-Din) al-Muwashah wa-Musiqa al-Maqam al-Natiqa bil-Arabiya bayn al-Tantheer wal-Maras’ (The Ship of Possession and the Precious Ship (Shehab al-Din) - Muwashah and Arabic-speaking Maqam Music between Theory and Practice), published by ElAin Publishing in 2023. The researcher conducted a comprehensive methodological study, showcasing his scientific acumen and enhanced prowess to analyse, understand, and critique. Dr. Said’s work makes it evident that he made a significant effort to organise his report and present information clearly to the reader. Remarkably this study stands out as the first comprehensive report from a scientific point of view and includes an in-depth study and statistical charts of melodies and connections.\n\nMoreover, the winner of the Contribution to the Development of Nations category is Dr. Khalifa Alromaithi from the UAE, who won for his book: ‘Al-Asmaa’ al-Jughrafiya – Thakirat Ajyal’ (Geographical Names – Legacy of Generations), published by Austin Macauley Publishers in 2022. The book is characterised by its scientific spirit, accuracy of its language, and clarity of its style. It constitutes a study of geographical names in the United Arab Emirates, providing a reference for researchers into the subject. The author combines a historical and geographical approach, relying on data, numbers, maps, and historical tracing, making it a work of outstanding distinction and precision.\n\nIn the Translation category of the Award, the winner was Dr. Ahmed Somai from Tunisia, for his translation of ‘Al-Ilm al-Jadeed’ (La Scienza Nuova – The New Science), authored by Giambattista Vico, translated from Italian into Arabic, and published by Adab Publishing and Distribution in 2022.

The book sheds light on the key contributions of Islamic philosophy and its impact on subsequent developments in theology, science, and literature. It covers the developments that led to reshaping philosophical discourse in Islam during the 12th century. Griffel highlights figures who spoke in depth about philosophy in that era, delving into metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, and the intricate relationship between reason and revelation. One of the most innovative ideas expressed in the book is the combination of Greek philosophical ideas with Arab and Islamic schools of thought; it explains how scholars like Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina attempted to reconcile these diverse traditions. The book also reviews the figures and movements that influenced Islamic philosophy, making it a valuable contribution to understanding post-classical eras in Islamic philosophy.\n\nThe Publishing and Technology category saw China-based Bayt Elhekma for Creative Industries win the Award. The group aims to establish a cultural bridge that tells China’s story and history, promoting cross-cultural dialogue between China and the Arab world. Since its establishment, the group has translated and published more than 300 books and publications, in addition to a vast number of documents and newspapers. These efforts have allowed Bayt Elhekma for Creative Industries to compile a large database of Chinese and Arabic linguistic inventory, which can be employed to serve cultural endeavours on both the Chinese and Arab sides.\n\nThe group is an integrated cultural project operating in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and China. In just a few years, it has managed to build Arab, regional, and international knowledge bridges through its branches and projects that focus on connecting the Middle East with the Far East and establishing rooted knowledge through publishing, translation, education, visual media, cultural industries, and trade.
