Transition to motherhood is a universal phenomenon in which every culture has its own expectations and varying supports for women moving through this transition. International studies have provided models or categories of maternal responses related to cultural aspects of transition to motherhood. However, no known research has focused on transition to motherhood among Gulf Arab women. In the initial cohort seventeen first time Gulf Arab mothers in the United Arab Emirates were interviewed during the following three times: before childbirth, two-four weeks after childbirth, and forty-days after childbirth. A second cohort of seventeen first time new mothers was interviewed after childbirth in Sultanate of Oman. Four patterns were identified as indicators of change as women transitioned into motherhood: 1) Women's personal transition: women changed from feeling of freedom to feeling of dependency to self-confidence. 2) Mother/baby relationships: women changed from fear, anxiety, and uncertainty to feelings of care and confidence. 3) Family influences: women experienced family support to being integrated and feeling respected by family. 4) Cultural/religious beliefs and practices: women felt they were initially observers of culture, to experiencing cultural/religious beliefs and practices. This was followed by accomplishment in childbearing and childrearing practices. As Gulf Arab new mothers made the transition to motherhood, four implications for international nursing practice emerged: 1) patient teaching to help relieve anxiety, fears, and uncertainty, 2) facilitation of mother/baby relationships, 3) family-centered care, and 4) the importance of cultural/religious beliefs and practices to new mothers.\n\nQatar Peninsula, United Arab Emirates, Persian Gulf\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nIn this view of the Qatar Peninsula, United Arab Emirates, Persian Gulf, (25.0N, 51.0E) a large oil spill, seen as a large dark toned mass in the water covers much of the surface of the western Persian Gulf. Qatar is one of several of the oil rich United Arab Emirate states. Oil spills and oil pollution of the environment are common occurrances associated with oil tanker loading operations.\n\nArab - American relations in the Persian Gulf\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNakhleh, E.A.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe Saudi decision during the October War to combine oil and politics and to relate the flow of Saudi oil to American Middle Eastern policies marked a major deviation from a long-standing policy. This has resulted in a major re-thinking of U.S. interests and long-range policies by U.S. policy makers toward all Arab national interests. The entanglement has forced U.S. policy makers to recognize three realities. First, Arab oil production can no longer be treated separately from Arab national issues, most particularly the Palestine problem. Second, smoothly functioning economic relationships will follow only if outstanding political conflicts are resolved; again,moreÂ Â» the Palestine conflict is the uppermost issue. Third, the U.S., as a major industrial country and as a superpower directly concerned with international peace and security, can no longer choose between one of only two traditional positions: complete detachment or total involvement; other options must be examined. In order to develop a policy framework for future American relations with the Arab littoral states of the Gulf, several dimensions are examined, namely: the political and ideological nature of the Arab regimes in the Gulf, the religious/tribal foundations of these regimes and the oil-generated affluence of their ruling families, the diplomatic and military activities of regional and other powers; and the new economic factors in the Gulf. The last chapter presents a long-range projection of American international relations in the Gulf and the spectrum of options available to U.S. policymakers.

For example, hypertension is significantly more prevalent in blacks than whites. Endothelial cells are important regulators of vascular tone and homeostasis, in part through secretions of vasoactive substances including endothelin-1 (ET-1), a small peptide with potent vasopressor actions. In black hypertensives, ET-1 levels are higher than in normotensive blacks and in both hypertensive and normotensive whites. Since ET-1 might play a significant role in the development and severity of hypertension in the indigenous Arab population of the United Arab Emirates, we investigated the circulating levels of ET-1 in this homogenous population. ET-1 levels were measured in plasma samples from 60 untreated hypertensive Arabs and compared with 60 age- and sex-matched normotensive controls. ET-1 levels were significantly higher in hypertensives (mean 10.1 +/- 1 pmol/L) than normotensives (mean 2.2 +/- 0.5 pmol/L). Body mass index (BMI) was slightly higher among the hypertensives. For all subjects these levels significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with systolic blood pressure and less significantly (P < 0.05) with diastolic blood pressure and body weight. The correlation between ET-1 and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was persistently significant after adjusting for BMI. Plasma concentrations of ET-1 are significantly higher in hypertensive Gulf Arabs as compared with reported levels in white hypertensives and ET-1 could be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in this population. The endothelial system might be particularly important with respect to hypertension in this racial group and merits further study.\n\nUrbanization in contemporary Arab Gulf states.\n\nPubMed\n\nQutub, I Y\n\n1983-01-01\n\nUrbanization in the Arab Gulf states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates is analyzed.

This book examines this problem and other issues connected with the impact of oil revenues on development in the Gulf States. It considers changing oil production policies and developments in other sectors of the economy including agriculture, industry and banking. It explores population problems, moves toward Gulf economic co-ordination and the impact of oil on society, culture and education. The book provides an assessment of how much the region depends on oil for its economicmoreÂ Â» prosperity and its development and it provides some indication of the problems that would face the region should the demand for oil decrease still further.Â«Â less\n\nAl Jirab Island, United Arab Emirates, Persian Gulf\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1991-01-01\n\nAl Jirab Island, United Arab Emirates, in the Persian Gulf (24.0N, 54.0E) is an offshore oil tanker loading facility in the southern Persian Gulf. During the Gulf War in early 1991, drifting oil from the Kuwait Oil Fields, some 460 miles to the north, threatened the area. Seen as a dark blue floating mass as well as weathered patches of lighter brown, between the island and the mainland, the oil made its way into the channel, scaring the local beaches.\n\nSystemic review of the epidemiology of autism in Arab Gulf countries\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSalhia, Huda O.; Al-Nasser, Lubna A.; Taher, Lama S.; Al-Khathaami, Ali M.; El-Metwally, Ashraf A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective: To assess the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology of autism in Arab Gulf countries, and identify gaps for future research. Methods: PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were used to identify relevant articles published until the 3rd of April 2013 (date of search). The search was conducted using the electronic library of King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they concerned the epidemiology of autism, conducted in any Arab Gulf country, and published in English. Results: Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies showed a prevalence ranging from 1.4 to 29 per 10,000 persons. Identified risk factors were metabolic, autoimmune, and environmental in nature. The following determinants were found as possible contributing factors for autism: suboptimal breast-feeding, advanced maternal and paternal age, cesarean section, and prenatal complications. Conclusion: Only a few studies explored the epidemiology of autism in Arab Gulf countries and none have investigated the burden of the disease on the child, family, or society. More research is needed to better identify the burden and risk factors of autism in Gulf countries.

This book examines what options the Arab states have for countering this threat. It looks in detail at what opportunities exist for the Gulf states to accumulate sufficient productive capital in non-oil sectors of their economies. Particular attention is given to the possibilities for development through cooperation with the Third World as a whole.\n\nTrace elements in fish from the Arabian Gulf and the Shatt al-Arab river, Iraq\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAbaychi, J.; Al-Saad, H.T.\n\n1988-02-01\n\nIn the Arabian Gulf region, recently, vast industrial, agricultural, economic and social developments have taken place, in addition to an increase in population. This may enhance the magnitude of environmental pollution year by year. No detailed study has been undertaken to assess the concentrations of trace elements in commercial species of fish from the Arabian Gulf and the Shatt al-Arab River, despite the fact that fish are considered an essential part of the diet in the region. Therefore, an investigation was carried out on the concentration of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn in themoreÂ Â» following fish species from the Arabian Gulf: Tylosurus strongylurus, Eleutheoronema tetradactum, Pomadasys arel, Platycephalus indicus, Ilisha elongata, Thryssa hamiltonii, Arius thalassinus, Acanthophagrus luteus, Johnieops sina, Liza dussumeiri, Hilsa ilisha, Nematolosa nasus and Otoliths argenteus, and on species from the Shatt al-Arab River: Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi, Barbus xanthopterus, Barbus scheich, Aspius vorax, Cyprinus carpio, and Barbus grypus. Trace element levels in sediment samples from the area were also determined since sediments can accumulate different elements and may reflect the extent of pollution by these elements.Â«Â less\n\nThe oil policies of the Gulf Arab Nations\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRipple, R.D.; Hagen, R.E.\n\n1995-03-01\n\nAt its heart, Arab oil policy is inseparable from Arab economic and social policy. This holds whether we are talking about the Arab nations as a group or each separately. The seven Arab nations covered in this report-Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates--participate in several organizations focusing on regional cooperation regarding economic development, social programs, and Islamic unity, as well as organizations concerned with oil policies. This report focuses on the oil-related activities of the countries that may reveal the de facto oil policies of the seven Persian Gulf nations. Nevertheless it should bemoreÂ Â» kept in mind that the decision makers participating in the oil policy organizations are also involved with the collaborative efforts of these other organizations. Oil policies of five of the seven Arab nations are expressed within the forums of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC). Only Oman, among the seven, is not a member of either OAPEC or OPEC; Bahrain is a member of OAPEC but not of OPEC. OPEC and OAPEC provide forums for compromise and cooperation among their members. Nevertheless, each member state maintains its own sovereignty and follows its own policies. Each country deviates from the group prescription from time to time, depending upon individual circumstances.Â«Â less\n\nTeachers Education Development in the Arab Gulf States.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRasheed, Mohammed A.\n\nIn the first section of this paper, an overview of the teaching profession in the Arab Gulf States is presented.

[Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Oman\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBarger, T.C.\n\nAn attempt is made to trace the historical and social factors that affect the policies of the Arab states on the Gulf, especially with respect to the oil industry. The states are Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Oman; Oman qualifies as contiguous to the Gulf by reason of its possession of the point of land that comprises the southern shore of the Straits of Hormuz. The book analyzes pricing, production, and participation in the oil industry in the Gulf region; the formation of the organization of OPEC; and the Arab embargo of 1973. By examiningmoreÂ Â» both the general policies of these countries and their individual needs and goals, an objective observer may be able to evaluate the future timing and tenor of energy policy in this region, which will surely affect world policies. Also discussed is the greatest assemblage of offshore oil fields in the world in the Persian Gulf. Considerations in making energy policy and the policies of the seven countries are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6. A bibliographical note follows a concluding chapter.

On the basis of data obtained from Qatari Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, the present study provides norms for a set of 319 object pictures and a set of 141 action pictures. Norms were collected from healthy speakers, using a picture-naming paradigm and rating tasks. Norms for naming latencies, name agreement, visual complexity, image agreement, imageability, age of acquisition, and familiarity were established. Furthermore, the database includes other intrinsic factors, such as syllable length and phoneme length. It also includes orthographic frequency values (extracted from Aralex; Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2010). These factors were then examined for their impact on picture-naming latencies in object- and action-naming tasks. The analysis showed that the primary determinants of naming latencies in both nouns and verbs are (in descending order) image agreement, name agreement, familiarity, age of acquisition, and imageability. These results indicate no evidence that noun- and verb-naming processes in Gulf Arabic are influenced in different ways by these variables. This is the first database for Gulf Arabic, and therefore the norms collected from the present study will be of paramount importance for researchers and clinicians working with speakers of this variety of Arabic. Due to the similarity of the Arabic varieties spoken in the Gulf, these different varieties are grouped together under the label \"Gulf Arabic\" in the literature.

Comprising a distinctive geographic region spread across West Asia and North East Africa and unified by the Arabic language, these states share common values and characteristics despite having diverse economic and political conditions. The demographic lag (high fertility and low mortality) that characterizes the Arab world is unique, but the present trend of declining fertility, combined with the relatively low mortality, brings about significant changes in its population size. This research aimed to: (i) assess the population growth in the Arab world over 3 time periods, (ii) explore its components, and (iii) understand its public health impact. Data from the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau for 3 time periods (1992, 2002, and 2012) in 21 countries of the Arab world were analyzed by dividing them into four geographic sectors, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), West Asia, Maghreb, and the Nile Valley African Horn. The population of the Arab world has grown considerably due to both natural growth and migration. The immigration is pronounced, especially into resource-intensive GCC nations, not only from East Asian and Central African countries but also from resource-thrifty (limited-resource) Arab nations. The migrations within, as well as outside, the Arab world reveal an interesting demographic phenomenon that requires further research: migration flows and trends. However, the transformations in public health statistics related to mortalityâthe impact of demographic changesâdepict a new era in the Arab world.

Annual photographic censuses of approximately 2000 colonies were used to describe the demographics (size class frequencies, abundance, area cover) and population dynamics under \"normal\" environmental conditions. Size class transitions included growth, which occurred in 10-20% of the colonies, followed in decending order by partial mortality (3-16%), colony fission (<5%) and ramet fusion (<3%). Recruitment and whole colony mortality rates were low (<0.7 colonies/m(2)) with minimal interannual variation. Transition matrices indicated that the Arabian Gulf assemblages have declining growth rates (Î»<1) whereas the massive coral population is stable (Î»â=â1) in the Gulf of Oman. Projection models indicated that (i) the Arabian Gulf population and area cover declines would be exacerbated under 10-year and 16-year disturbance scenarios as the vital rates do not allow for recovery to pre-disturbance levels during these timeframes, and (ii) the Gulf of Oman assemblage could return to its pre-disturbance area cover but its overall population size would not fully recover under the same scenarios.\n\nDemography and Population Dynamics of Massive Coral Communities in Adjacent High Latitude Regions (United Arab Emirates)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFoster, Kristi A.; Foster, Greg\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIndividual massive coral colonies, primarily faviids and poritids, from three distinct assemblages within the southeastern Arabian Gulf and northwestern Gulf of Oman (United Arab Emirates) were studied from 2006â2009.

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and prevalence of SLE among the native Arab population of United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods Patients with SLE were identified from three sources: medical records of two local tertiary hospitals (four years; 2009 to 2012), laboratory requests for serum double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid and serum anti-nuclear antibody and confirmed histopathologic diagnosis of SLE (skin and kidney biopsy specimens). All the patients identified with SLE met the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Incidence and prevalence were calculated using the state records of the UAE native population as the denominator. The age-adjusted incidence was calculated by direct standardization using the World Health Organization world standard population 2000-2025. Results Sixteen new cases (13 females and three males) fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology SLE criteria. The mean (Â±SD) age at time of diagnosis was 28.6âÂ±â12.4 years. The crude incidence ratio (per 100,000 population) was 3.5, 1.1, 2.1 and 2.1 in years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, respectively. The age-standardized incidence per 100,000 population for the four years was 8.6 (95% confidence interval 4.2-15.9). The age-standardized prevalence of SLE among the native population according to the 2012 population consensus was 103/100,000 population (95% confidence interval 84.5-124.4). Conclusion The age-adjusted incidence and prevalence among UAE Arabs is higher than has been reported among most other Caucasian populations. Furthermore, the prevalence of SLE in UAE seems much higher than other similar Arab countries in the Gulf region.\n\nThe impact of the Gulf war on migration and remittances in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nPubMed\n\nAddleton, J\n\n1991-12-01\n\nThe author discusses the impact of the 1990 Gulf war on the migrant worker populations in the region, with a focus on migration and remittances in Asia and the Middle East. Both immediate and long-term effects are considered. \"From the perspective of foreign migrant communities living in the Gulf...the war...was much more of a disaster for Arabs than for Asians....Arab migrant populations...were dramatically affected by the Gulf crisis. In contrast, the Asian migrant community was largely concentrated in Saudi Arabia and the [United Arab Emirates] and remained relatively less affected by the crisis. Subsequent polarization in the Arab world gives Asian labor-exporting countries an unexpected opportunity to increase their share of Gulf labor markets still further in the coming years.\" (SUMMARY IN FRE AND SPA) excerpt\n\nParkinson's Disease in the Gulf Countries: An Updated Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlamri, Yassar; MacAskill, Michael; Anderson, Tim; Benamer, Hani\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Arabian Gulf region is a rapidly developing part of the world. With the increase in average life-expectancy, idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), is also expected to increase in prevalence. Furthermore, the high rate of consanguinity among Arabs probably makes familial cases of PD more likely to be encountered than other areas in the world. This review provides an update on the published literature on sporadic and familial PD in Gulf Arabs. Although the Arab population of this region shares religious beliefs and demographic characteristics with other Arabs, their environmental exposures and genetic makeup may be different. This could account for the relatively low prevalence of PD reported in the Al-Thugba study (27 per 100,000) compared with prevalence rates by most other studies on Arab (mainly North African) populations (31.4-557.4 per 100,000). Gulf countries are considered rich countries, which makes conducting nation-wide or even international studies logistically easier than it is in many other countries. Such multinational research can be organized by the existing Gulf Cooperation Council, or through a collaboration of the Ministries of Health. This would, hopefully, culminate in the introduction of more research centers, as well as the implementation of better health care policies and practices for the ageing community. Â© 2015 S.

This narrative review aimed to describe and synthesize HIV responses in Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A review of scientific databases and grey literature was conducted based on an international guide. Overall, 16 original studies and reports were found. The review indicates that HIV has been found present in each Arab state based on sporadic case finding. The prevalence of HIV is the result of heterosexual relationship and/or drug injection. Mandatory testing of the nationals and expatriate workers is the main route of HIV detection. In general, HIV knowledge and education are poor. Only Bahrain has some non-governmental organizations that provide HIV education. Lack of identifying key populations and high risk behaviors has been reported in all of the states. HIV responses are mainly for Arab and Arabic-speaking nationals. Effective strategic plans for HIV have not been developed in all of the states.

This narrative review aimed to describe and synthesize HIV responses in Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Evidence Acquisition A review of scientific databases and grey literature was conducted based on an international guide. Overall, 16 original studies and reports were found. Results The review indicates that HIV has been found present in each Arab state based on sporadic case finding. The prevalence of HIV is the result of heterosexual relationship and/or drug injection. Mandatory testing of the nationals and expatriate workers is the main route of HIV detection. In general, HIV knowledge and education are poor. Only Bahrain has some non-governmental organizations that provide HIV education. Lack of identifying key populations and high risk behaviors has been reported in all of the states. HIV responses are mainly for Arab and Arabic-speaking nationals. Effective strategic plans for HIV have not been developed in all of the states. The provision of antiretroviral therapy for the nationals is the main HIV response. Only Qatar has paid for the treatment of Qatari and non-Qatari HIV-infected patients. As a HIV response, drug treatment is based on short-term inpatient rehabilitation. Only Qatar has voluntary HIV counseling and testing. Lack of needle and syringe programs has been reported for people who inject drugs with HIV problem in all of the states. Conclusions To conclude, HIV problem needs a comprehensive policy response in each state. Providing effective strategic plans for HIV and sero-surveillance data systems is required. Empowering human resources and infrastructural development are suggested.

However, little is known about AR among the heterogeneous population of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). To estimate the prevalence of AR and its independent risk factors in Al-Ain City, UAE. We used a validated, self-administered questionnaire modified from the ISAAC study to collect data from a two stage randomly selected sample of 10 000 school children. Overall, 7550 subjects (aged 13 years and above, siblings, and their parents) responded. We assessed the prevalence of AR (both crude and standardized prevalence of previous 12 months) as well as the independent relationship of AR with age, gender, education, nationality and family history by means of logistic regression. The response rate was 76%. A total of 6543 subjects (median age 30 years) were included in the final analysis. Self-reported prevalence of AR (having symptoms in the past 12 months) was 36%, while adjusted values for sex/age yielded a prevalence of 32%. Regression analysis revealed that AR was independently associated with family history, Arab origin, younger age, female gender and higher education. The relatively high prevalence of AR found in this study may be attributable to modernization and genetic factors. Further studies on the impact of rapid environmental and cultural changes on AR in the Arab countries are needed and currently planned in conjunction with GA(2)LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network).\n\nApolipoprotein E polymorphism and lipoprotein levels in a Gulf Arab population in Kuwait: a pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Shammari, S; Fatania, H; Al-Radwan, R; Akanji, A O\n\n2004-01-01\n\nAPOE polymorphism is believed to confer susceptibility to coronary heart disease (CHD) and Alzheimer's disease. It is well known that patterns of APOE polymorphisms differ between populations and ethnic groups, although most of the data available so far have been in whites. We evaluated the frequencies of APOE genotypes and their relationships with serum levels of lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in two groups of Gulf Arab citizens: a control population of healthy voluntary blood donors (n=106), and a group of patients presenting to the lipid clinic for the first time with combined hyperlipidaemia (CH) (n=41). In both groups, fasting serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), HDL, LDL and apolipoprotein A1 and B levels were measured by routine autoanalyzer methods, and APOE genotyping was performed by validated PCR methods. The lipid and lipoprotein levels were related to the specific APOE allele frequencies. Allele frequencies were 5.7% for *E2, 85.4% for *E3, and 9.0% for *E4 in the healthy blood donor group. An essentially similar pattern was seen in the patients with CH. This APOE allelic distribution conforms to patterns described in Chinese, whites and South Asians. In both the blood donor and CH groups there were no consistent links between specific APOE pattern and serum lipoproteins, as would have been predicted from APO *E2 and APO *E4 frequencies. We conclude that APOE allelic patterns in healthy Kuwaiti blood donors and a smaller group of patients with CH do not satisfactorily predict circulating blood levels of lipids and lipoproteins.\n\nManagement of end-stage heart failure: a perspective on the Arab Gulf states\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAl Habeeb, Waleed; Stewart, Garrick C.; Mudge, Gilbert H.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe ever expanding epidemic of end-stage heart failure represents one of the greatest challenges of modern cardiovascular medicine. With medical treatments hampered by significant limitations, physicians caring for patients with advanced heart disease have turned to cardiac transplantation and durable mechanical circulatory assist devices as definitive therapies. These advanced therapeutic modalities are not widely available outside the United States and Europe, but nevertheless offer enormous potential for patients in the Arab Gulf suffering from end-stage heart failure. This review will discuss the management of end-stage heart failure in the Gulf States, with an emphasis on therapies best utilized within a framework of regional cooperation and coordination. PMID:19847084\n\nUnited Arab Emirates.\n\nPubMed\n\n1985-02-01\n\nThis discussion of the United Arab Emirates focuses on the following: the people; geography; history; government; political conditions; defense; the economy; foreign relations; and relations between the US and the United Arab Emirates. In 1983 the population was estimated at 1,194,000. In 1984 the annual growth rate was negative. Life expectancy is about 60 years. Fewer than 20% of the population are UAE citizens. Indigenous Emiris are Arab; the rest of the population includes significant numbers of other Arabs -- Palestinians, Egyptians, Jordanians, Yemenis, Omanis, as well as many Iranians, Pakistanis, Indians, and West Europeans, especially in Dubai. The UAE is in the eastern Arabian Peninsula, bounded on the north by the Persian Gulf. European and Arab pirates roamed the Trucial Coast area from the 17th century into the 19th century. Early British expeditions against the pirates led to further campaigns against their headquarters. Piracy continued intermittently until 1835, when the shaikhs agreed not to engage in hostilities at sea. Primarily in reaction to the ambitions of other European countries, the UK and the Trucial States established closer bonds in an 1892 treaty. In 1968 the British government announced its decision, reaffirmed in March 1971, to end the treaty relationship with the gulf shaikhdoms. When the British protective treaty with the Trucial Shaikhdoms ended on December 1, they became fully independent. On December 2, 1971, 6 of them entered into a union called the United Arab Emirates. The 7th, Ras al-Khaimah, joined in early 1972. Administratively, the UAE is a loose federation of 7 emirates, each with its own ruler. The pace at which local government in each emirate is evolving, from traditional to modern, is set primarily by the ruler. Under the provisional constitution of 1971, each emirate reserves considerable powers, including control over mineral rights, taxation, and police powers. In this milieu, the growth of federal powers has\n\nArab gene geography: From population diversities to personalized medical genomics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTadmouri, Ghazi O.; Sastry, Konduru S.; Chouchane, Lotfi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGenetic disorders are not equally distributed over the geography of the Arab region. While a number of disorders have a wide geographical presence encompassing 10 or more Arab countries, almost half of these disorders occur in a single Arab country or population. Nearly, one-third of the genetic disorders in Arabs result from congenital malformations and chromosomal abnormalities, which are also responsible for a significant proportion of neonatal and perinatal deaths in Arab populations. Strikingly, about two-thirds of these diseases in Arab patients follow an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. High fertility rates together with increased consanguineous marriages, generally noticed in Arab populations, tend to increase the rates of genetic and congenital abnormalities. Many of the nearly 500 genes studied in Arab people revealed striking spectra of heterogeneity with many novel and rare mutations causing large arrays of clinical outcomes. In this review we provided an overview of Arab gene geography, and various genetic abnormalities in Arab populations, including disorders of blood, metabolic, circulatory and neoplasm, and also discussed their associated molecules or genes responsible for the cause of these disorders. Although studying Arab-specific genetic disorders resulted in a high value knowledge base, approximately 35% of genetic diseases in Arabs do not have a defined molecular etiology. This is a clear indication that comprehensive research is required in this area to understand the molecular pathologies causing diseases in Arab populations.

In 1985, the size of the workforce in the Gulf States was 7.1 million. Non-nationals comprised 68% (in Saudi Arabia) to almost 91% (in United Arab Emirates) of the workforce. 63% of the non-nationals were from Asia. Non-national Arab workers represented 30% of the total. In 1985, 36% of all migrant workers came from India and Pakistan. Almost 30% of the non-nationals were employed in services (financial, personal, and community), and almost 29% were in construction. Non-nationals dominate 3 sectors: construction, manufacturing, and utilities. Non-nationals account for a relatively low 55% of the oil sector. The phenomenal rate of growth in non-national workforces during the mid 1970s began to slow in the 1980s. Labor permit issues peaked in the late 1970s and again in 1983-84. The timing and scale of the decline varies by sending country and by destination, reflecting variations in the rate and extent of the economic slowdown in different GCC states, as well as relative wage rates, occupational composition, and organization of the various labor flows. For example, Indian case worker placements fell by 49% between 1983 and 1986, while the number of Filipinos placed fell by 15%. During the 1980s, most Gulf states have increased efforts to enforce labor and residence regulations, but the number of illegal workers has continued to grow. During the 1st half of the 1980s, demand for non-national labor increasingly turned towards new supplies in South and Southeast Asia, notably Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Meanwhile, an increasing share of Arab and South Asian workers were renewing their work permits, often on less favorable terms. The construction sector has had the greatest decline in new labor inflows; however, the service sector is still growing.

This is particularly true of the Arab Gulf, a conglomerate of high income, oil-producing countries where prevalence rates are the highest. The prevalence rates among adults of the Arabic speaking countries as a whole range between 4%â21%, with the lowest being in Somalia and the highest in Kuwait. As economic growth has accelerated, so has the movement of the populations to urban centers where people are more likely to adopt lifestyles that embrace increased high-calorie food consumption and sedentary lifestyles. These factors likely contribute to the increased prevalence of obesity and diabetes in the Arabic speaking countries.

Five neonatal care units participated in this 2-year prospective study in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Data were collected prospectively using a standardized data collection form. EOS was defined as the growth of a single potentially pathogenic organism from blood or cerebrospinal fluid in infants within 72h of birth, with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with infection. Out of 67 474 live births, 102 cases of EOS occurred. The overall incidence of EOS was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.2-1.8) per 1000 live-births, ranging from 2.64 per 1000 live-births in Kuwait to 0.40 per 1000 live-births in King Abdulaziz Hospital in Saudi Arabia. The most common causative organism of EOS was group B Streptococcus (GBS; 60.0%), followed by Escherichia coli (13%). The incidence of invasive GBS disease was 0.90 per 1000 live-births overall and ranged from 1.4 per 1000 live-births in Kuwait to 0.6 per 1000 live-births in Dubai Hospital. The incidence of EOS and the patterns of the causative organisms in the Arab states in the Gulf region are similar to those in developed countries before the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Efforts should be made to improve intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in the Arab state setting, which could avert large numbers of GBS infections. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors.

On the mainland beaches opposite the island, a thick and continuous black fringe of oil can be seen as a line. Photo experts studying the STS 39 photography have not yet ascertained the source of the oil. They disclosed that if the oil does in fact stem from damaged Kuwaiti offshore oil fields, the slick has been blown southward at least 460 miles. The city of Tarif is visible in the affected area. Lighter brown slicks can be seen offshore. A causeway joins Al Jirab to the mainland and a dredged ship channel with its associated islands can be seen west of the causeway.\n\nCTGA: the database for genetic disorders in Arab populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nTadmouri, Ghazi O; Al Ali, Mahmoud Taleb; Al-Haj Ali, Sarah; Al Khaja, Najib\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe Arabs comprise a genetically heterogeneous group that resulted from the admixture of different populations throughout history. They share many common characteristics responsible for a considerable proportion of perinatal and neonatal mortalities. To this end, the Centre for Arab Genomic Studies (CAGS) launched a pilot project to construct the 'Catalogue of Transmission Genetics in Arabs' (CTGA) database for genetic disorders in Arabs.

In either case, the final search result is a detailed HTML record that includes text-, URL- and graphic-based fields. At present, CTGA hosts entries for 692 phenotypes and 235 related genes described in Arab individuals. Of these, 213 phenotypic descriptions and 22 related genes were observed in the Arab population of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These results emphasize the role of CTGA as an essential tool to promote scientific research on genetic disorders in the region. The priority of CTGA is to provide timely information on the occurrence of genetic disorders in Arab individuals.

Despite the collegial nature of many of these genome study consortiums, which has led to the cataloging of genetic variations of different ethnic groups from around the world, genome data on the Arab population remains overwhelmingly underrepresented. The National Arab Genome project in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) aims to address this deficiency by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to provide data to improve our understanding of the Arab genome and catalog variants that are unique to the Arab population of the UAE. The project was conceived to shed light on the similarities and differences between the Arab genome and those of the other ethnic groups.\n\nSecond Amman Declaration on Population and Development in the Arab World.\n\nPubMed\n\n1992-01-01\n\nMany demographic changes have occurred in the Arab region. Population increased from 132 million in 1974 to 237 million in 1992. In preparation for the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the Arab Population Conference was held in April 1993. This document summarizes the Arab conference proceedings: preamble, general principles, objectives, and recommendations for human development, the environment, population distribution and urbanization, international migration, women in development, maternal and child health and family planning, IEC, nongovernmental development programs, special topics, structural adjustment and population policies, research, and international cooperation. Arab countries were convinced that clear, comprehensive population policies were needed and should be integrated into development programs. Population policies must be based on the achievement of a satisfactory quality of life and integrity for the family as the basic unit of society. Women should be enabled to perform their full role as citizens. Children have a right to a happy, healthy, and secure life. Population is interconnected with development and should not be treated in isolation. The population problems of those in Israeli occupied territory should be addressed with consideration for the demographic pressure from occupational authorities. Arab states should provide family planning services as a basic human right of couples. Environmental concerns must be considered within development strategies. Reforms need to be made to correct imbalances between economic and social conditions and population problems. Arab countries must be involved in restructuring the world economy with the aim of balancing North and South trade. Rescheduling of debt servicing must be achieved. The industrialized countries must \"curb excessive consumerism and reduce huge expenditures on armaments.\" Individual country population policy should be constructed within a pan-Arab framework\n\nNovel approach to systematic random sampling in population surveys: Lessons from the United Arab Emirates National Diabetes Study (UAEDIAB).\n\nPubMed\n\nSulaiman, Nabil; Albadawi, Salah; Abusnana, Salah; Fikri, Mahmoud; Madani, Abdulrazzag; Mairghani, Maisoon; Alawadi, Fatheya; Zimmet, Paul; Shaw, Jonathan\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe prevalence of diabetes has risen rapidly in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf Region. However, some prevalence estimates have not fully accounted for large migrant worker populations and have focused on minority indigenous populations. The objectives of the UAE National Diabetes and Lifestyle Study are to: (i) define the prevalence of, and risk factors for, T2DM; (ii) describe the distribution and determinants of T2DM risk factors; (iii) study health knowledge, attitudes, and (iv) identify gene-environment interactions; and (v) develop baseline data for evaluation of future intervention programs. Given the high burden of diabetes in the region and the absence of accurate data on non-UAE nationals in the UAE, a representative sample of the non-UAE nationals was essential. We used an innovative methodology in which non-UAE nationals were sampled when attending the mandatory biannual health check that is required for visa renewal. Such an approach could also be used in other countries in the region. Complete data were available for 2719 eligible non-UAE nationals (25.9% Arabs, 70.7% Asian non-Arabs, 1.1% African non-Arabs, and 2.3% Westerners). Most were menâ<â65 years of age. The response rate was 68%, and the non-response was greater among women than men; 26.9% earned less than UAE Dirham (AED) 24â000 (US$6500) and the most common areas of employment were as managers or professionals, in service and sales, and unskilled occupations. Most (37.4%) had completed high school and 4.1% had a postgraduate degree. This novel methodology could provide insights for epidemiological studies in the UAE and other Gulf States, particularly for expatriates.

The study covers the cities proper or urban agglomerations, which includes the suburbs, whose population exceeded 100,000 in the most recent census. Altogether, the study covers 49 metropolitan areas from 9 Arab countries--Algeria; Morocco; Tunisia; Libya; Egypt; Sudan; Syria; Iraq; and Kuwait. Analysis revealed that metropolitan growth rates do follow geographic patterns. In countries with an oil-based economy, metropolitan growth rates are high; in countries with unexploited resources they are slightly below the 1st group; and countries which have pressure on land have low metropolitan growth rates. Population size of the metropolitan area appears to be an important factor associated with variations in metropolitan growth rates and net migration rates. Natural increase emerges as the predominant factor in metropolitan growth, but the differentials in the growth rates are more clearly associated with variations in net migration rates. As all the possibilities of analysis of relationships of metropolitan growth have not been exhausted, it is proposed to examine additional variables as possible factors associated with the speed of metropolitan growth.\n\nCompleted suicide and suicide attempts in the Arab population in Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrunstein Klomek, A; Nakash, O; Goldberger, N; Haklai, Z; Geraisy, N; Yatzkar, U; Birnai, A; Levav, I\n\n2016-06-01\n\nCompleted suicide and suicide attempts among four Arab groups defined by religious affiliation in Israel: Bedouins, Muslims (other than Bedouin), Christians and Druze were investigated using national databases of suicide (1999-2011), and suicide attempts (2004-2012). Age specific and age-adjusted rates and ratio of suicides to suicidal behavior were calculated, and compared with the total Israeli population rates. Age-adjusted suicide rates were lowest among the non-Bedouin Muslims, 2.5, followed in ascending order by Bedouins, 3.2, and Christian Arabs, 3.3 per 100,000 population, respectively. The highest rate was found among the Druze, 8.7, per 100,000 population, particularly for young males. The rates among the Arab groups were lower than for the total Israeli population, 7.9 per 100,000 population, except for the Druze. The pattern of suicide rates by gender, higher for males than females, was similar in all groups. The rates among the Arab Israelis were highest for the 15-24Â year old age group, while in the total population the rates increased with age. Age-adjusted suicide attempt rates were higher amongst non-Bedouin Muslims, 84.8 per 100,000 population, followed by the Bedouin, 72.4; Druze. 64.9; and lowest among Christian Arabs, 58.6, all per 100,000 population. In the total Israeli population, the rate was even higher, 89.8 per 100,000 population. Suicide attempt rates were higher for women in all groups, except among the Druze. Rates were higher in most groups for ages 15-24. In this age group, the rates for female Muslims and Bedouins and for male Druze were higher than among the total population. Arab elderly had low rates of both suicide and suicide attempts. The ratio of suicides to suicide attempts increased with age for all groups, except for the Christian Arabs. It was markedly higher for the Druze, compared to 7.3Â % for the total population for ages 15 and over. Findings highlight the importance of investigating the differential distribution\n\nThe genetic heterogeneity of Arab populations as inferred from HLA genes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlmawi, Wassim Y.; Arnaiz-Villena, Antonio; Hattab, Lasmar; Hmida, Slama\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis is the first genetic anthropology study on Arabs in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. The present meta-analysis included 100 populations from 36 Arab and non-Arab communities, comprising 16,006 individuals, and evaluates the genetic profile of Arabs using HLA class I (A, B) and class II (DRB1, DQB1) genes. A total of 56 Arab populations comprising 10,283 individuals were selected from several databases, and were compared with 44 Mediterranean, Asian, and sub-Saharan populations. The most frequent alleles in Arabs are A*01, A*02, B*35, B*51, DRB1*03:01, DRB1*07:01, DQB1*02:01, and DQB1*03:01, while DRB1*03:01-DQB1*02:01 and DRB1*07:01-DQB1*02:02 are the most frequent class II haplotypes. Dendrograms, correspondence analyses, genetic distances, and haplotype analysis indicate that Arabs could be stratified into four groups. The first consists of North Africans (Algerians, Tunisians, Moroccans, and Libyans), and the first Arabian Peninsula cluster (Saudis, Kuwaitis, and Yemenis), who appear to be related to Western Mediterraneans, including Iberians; this might be explained for a massive migration into these areas when Sahara underwent a relatively rapid desiccation, starting about 10,000 years BC. The second includes Levantine Arabs (Palestinians, Jordanians, Lebanese, and Syrians), along with Iraqi and Egyptians, who are related to Eastern Mediterraneans. The third comprises Sudanese and Comorians, who tend to cluster with Sub-Saharans. The fourth comprises the second Arabian Peninsula cluster, made up of Omanis, Emiratis, and Bahrainis. It is noteworthy that the two large minorities (Berbers and Kurds) are indigenous (autochthonous), and are not genetically different from âhostâ and neighboring populations.

It is concluded that the complexity of interrelationships is difficult to untangle. Researchers frequently neglect health issues in modeling the relationships. The lack of attention to the health, development, and environment nexus has serious implications in the Middle East and North Africa. In Lebanon, national strategies do not include a national waste management strategy based on reduction, reuse, and recycling. Most Arab countries face the major issue of the lack of adequate planning in many economic sectors, which results in imbalances in supply and demand. Most Arab countries do not have adequate statistical databases upon which to base development, planning, and policy-making. The last census in Lebanon was in 1932. Information is missing on health. Health economics are ignored. It is not possible to estimate the health costs due to deficiencies in sanitation, hygiene, water, and air quality. Capacity building for environmental management and intersectoral collaboration is hampered. Arab countries with large oil reserves have ignored the population and environment links. Poorer countries will suffer the most from limited renewable water resources and their decline due to population growth. The political agenda in Arab countries should give priority to health, environment, development, and population issues.\n\nProspects for the Growth and Influence of the Gulf Cooperation Council\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1983-10-01\n\nDARSP-supported Middle East study on \"The Future of Islamic Fundemental ism in the Arab World in the 1980’s,\" and find them very helpful.

The Arabian Peninsula was the initial site of the out-of-Africa migrations that occurred between 125,000 and 60,000 yr ago, leading to the hypothesis that the first Eurasian populations were established on the Peninsula and that contemporary indigenous Arabs are direct descendants of these ancient peoples. To assess this hypothesis, we sequenced the entire genomes of 104 unrelated natives of the Arabian Peninsula at high coverage, including 56 of indigenous Arab ancestry. The indigenous Arab genomes defined a cluster distinct from other ancestral groups, and these genomes showed clear hallmarks of an ancient out-of-Africa bottleneck. Similar to other Middle Eastern populations, the indigenous Arabs had higher levels of Neanderthal admixture compared to Africans but had lower levels than Europeans and Asians. These levels of Neanderthal admixture are consistent with an early divergence of Arab ancestors after the out-of-Africa bottleneck but before the major Neanderthal admixture events in Europe and other regions of Eurasia. When compared to worldwide populations sampled in the 1000 Genomes Project, although the indigenous Arabs had a signal of admixture with Europeans, they clustered in a basal, outgroup position to all 1000 Genomes non-Africans when considering pairwise similarity across the entire genome. These results place indigenous Arabs as the most distant relatives of all other contemporary non-Africans and identify these people as direct descendants of the first Eurasian populations established by the out-of-Africa migrations.

Results also demonstrate that short-term shamal winds have substantial impacts on oceanographic processes along the southern Persian/Arabian Gulf coastline, resulting in formation of large-scale (52 km diameter) eddies extending from the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to areas near the off-shore islands of Iran. Such eddies likely play an important role in transporting larvae from well-developed reefs of the off-shore islands to the degraded reef systems of the southern Persian/Arabian Gulf, potentially maintaining genetic and ecological connectivity of these geographically distant populations and enabling enhanced recovery of degraded coral communities in the UAE.

Much of the traditional growth and development of countries in the Middle East over the past 30 years or so has come from oil and gas revenues. The main areas that have been covered in this article are: synopsis of patenting system in each country, the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf patent filing system, patentability subject matter, prosecution of patent application, opposition and/or invalidation action(s) and issues that need to be resolved for an effective patent regime.\n\nDeterminants of family size in a Gulf Arab state: a comparison between two areas.\n\nPubMed\n\nHamadeh, Randah R; Al-Roomi, Khaldoon; Masuadi, Emad\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThe rapid economic transition in the Gulf Arab countries has resulted in marked changes in fertility and marriage patterns and a decrease in the number of children per family. Yet little is known about the determinants of family size in urban and less urban areas. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 450 Kuwaiti women aged 20-60 years who attended health care centres in Al Asima and Al Jahra governorates. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered through face-to-face interview which included variables on socio-demographic characteristics, family size, actual and ideal spacing, marriage related variables, health conditions and utilization of health services. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the factors that affect family size. The socio-economic indicators were significantly better in Al Asima, the capital, than in Al Jahra, a less urbanized area. On average, family size for the total sample was 5.97 +/- 0.114 with a larger size (6.27 +/- 0.242) in Al Jahra than in Al Asima (5.80 +/- 0.118) but without a significant difference. Al Jahra women reported a larger number of deliveries and past pregnancies but a lower usage of contraceptive measures. The total fertility rate was 3.65 in Al Asima, 3.84 in Al Jahra and 3.71 births per woman in the total population. Family size was inversely related to the educational level of women and their husbands. Currently employed women had a smaller family size (5.22 +/- 0.119) than the unemployed (6.81 +/- 0.187); p < 0.0005. Health problems in the interviewee or her husband played a minor role in the decision to have more children. Families where the husband was the decision-maker on the number of children had a significantly larger family size (6.91 +/- 0.451) than families where the couple both participated in the decision (5.83 +/- 0.129; p = 0.032).

All GCC nations have made substantial investments in telecommunications and electronic health infrastructure since 2000. Methods We conducted a literature search in English and Arabic on peer-reviewed e-health research up to December 2014 originating in the GCC. The objective was to retrieve all research on e-health in the GCC and to categorize and analyse it qualitatively to reveal the current state of e-health research and development in the region. Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed articles, books, book chapters, conference papers and graduate theses written on e-health in the GCC. Blogs, health websites and non-peer-reviewed literature were excluded. Results Three hundred and six articles were retrieved, categorized and analysed qualitatively to reveal the state of e-health research in the GCC. Both country-specific and GCC-wide major themes were identified using NVivo 10.0 qualitative software and summarized. The most common type of study was an overview (35.0%), with common study designs of case studies (26.8%) and descriptive articles (46.4%). Significant themes were: prospective national benefits from e-health, implementation and satisfaction with electronic health records, online technologies in medical education, innovative systems (case studies), and information security and personal health information. Discussion This is the first comprehensive analytical literature review of e-health in the GCC. Important research gaps were identified: few cost-benefit analyses, controlled interventional studies, or research targeting gender and religious issues were retrieved.\n\nHistopathologic Differences between Jewish and Arab Population in Israel at First-Time Presentation with Bladder Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nAvitan, Ofir; Bahouth, Zaher; Halachmi, Sarel; Shprits, Sagi; Masarwa, Ismail; Sabo, Edmond; Moskovitz, Boaz; Nativ, Ofer\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPathology of urothelial carcinoma may vary in different populations at diagnosis. Our aim was to evaluate the histopathologic differences between Jewish and Arab patients in Israel at first diagnosis of urothelial cancer. We retrospectively collected data of all patients with confirmed urothelial cancer, treated at our department between January 2010 and January 2015. We examined the distribution of the histopathologic data among the studied populations. To compare the categorical variables we used the Chi-Square Pearson test. Comparison of independent variables was made by Student's t -test. P value below 0.05 was considered significant. The study group included 413 patients, 345 Jews and 68 Arabs. The major differences were that Arab patients were younger (62.61 versus 68.55 years, P = 0.001), had more aggressive tumors that were detected at a more advanced stage, and had also a higher rate of metastatic disease (7.4% versus 3.2%, P = 0.05). Nonurothelial cell tumors were 2.3 times more prevalent in Arab population. Unlike Jewish population, Arab women had higher rate of invasive/metastatic disease compared with Arab men (40% versus 22.4%). At time of diagnosis the tumors were more aggressive in Arab patients, especially in Arab women. The reasons for those differences constitute a target for a separate research. These results should have an impact on prevention medicine and education of physicians treating mixed populations.\n\nDomestic violence in the Arab American population: transforming environmental conditions through community education.\n\nPubMed\n\nKulwicki, A D; Miller, J\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this research was to assess and provide community interventions for victims of domestic violence in the Arab American immigrant population in a large midwestern city of the United States. The theoretical framework of critical social theory provided the context for the research. A survey tool for assessing domestic violence was administered in the homes of 202 Arab American immigrants, followed by open discussion with the Arabic data collector. Findings from the research were used to develop and implement specific community education programs and clinic resources for the local immigrant population.\n\nSouth Persian Gulf Region\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThis oblique view of the south Persian Gulf region (26.0N, 54.0E) was taken over Iran looking west across the south Persian Gulf into the Trucial Coast of the United Arab Emirates and the prominent Qatar peninsula. Rich in petroleum resources, this region supplies much of the world's oil needs from its many ports and off shore loading facilities.\n\nUsing population models to evaluate management alternatives for Gulf Striped Bass\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAspinwall, Alexander P.; Irwin, Elise R.; Lloyd, M. Clint\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInterstate management of Gulf Striped Bass Morone saxatilis has involved a thirty-year cooperative effort involving Federal and State agencies in Georgia, Florida and Alabama (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Gulf Striped Bass Technical Committee). The Committee has recently focused on developing an adaptive framework for conserving and restoring Gulf Striped Bass in the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, and Flint River (ACF) system. To evaluate the consequences and tradeoffs among management activities, population models were used to inform management decisions. Stochastic matrix models were constructed with varying recruitment and stocking rates to simulate effects of management alternatives on Gulf Striped Bass population objectives. An age-classified matrix model that incorporated stock fecundity estimates and survival estimates was used to project population growth rate. In addition, combinations of management alternatives (stocking rates, Hydrilla control, harvest regulations) were evaluated with respect to how they influenced Gulf Striped Bass population growth. Annual survival and mortality rates were estimated from catch-curve analysis, while fecundity was estimated and predicted using a linear least squares regression analysis of fish length versus egg number from hatchery brood fish data. Stocking rates and stocked-fish survival rates were estimated from census data. Results indicated that management alternatives could be an effective approach to increasing the Gulf Striped Bass population. Population abundance was greatest under maximum stocking effort, maximum Hydrilla control and a moratorium. Conversely, population abundance was lowest under no stocking, no Hydrilla control and the current harvest regulation. Stocking rates proved to be an effective management strategy; however, low survival estimates of stocked fish (1%) limited the potential for population growth. Hydrilla control increased the survival rate of stocked fish and provided higher estimates\n\nHistopathologic Differences between Jewish and Arab Population in Israel at First-Time Presentation with Bladder Cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHalachmi, Sarel; Shprits, Sagi; Masarwa, Ismail; Sabo, Edmond; Moskovitz, Boaz; Nativ, Ofer\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Pathology of urothelial carcinoma may vary in different populations at diagnosis.

A multimode (mail, Web, or computer-assisted telephone interviewing) heath survey of 14,252 Gulf War and Gulf Era veterans. The survey consisted of questions about general, physical, mental, reproductive, and functional health. Gulf War veterans report a higher prevalence of almost all queried physical and mental health conditions. The population as a whole, however, has a significant burden of disease including high body mass index and multiple comorbid conditions. Gulf War veterans continue to report poorer heath than Gulf Era veterans, 20 years after the war. Chronic disease management and interventions to improve health and wellness among both Gulf War and Gulf Era veterans are necessary.\n\nOil slicks off the coast of Qatar, Persian Gulf\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nA detailed view the port facility of Musay'id on the Qatar Peninsula, United Arab Emirates, Persian Gulf (25.0N, 52.5E). Part of a large oil spill seen as a dark toned mass in the water, covering much of the surface of the western Persian Gulf, has moved offshore in this scene.

Obesity is a risk factor for both conditions. To investigate the prevalence of obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2), subjects' knowledge and behaviors, and their reports on practices of health-care professionals regarding body weight among Arabs and Jews. The study participants (n=880) were randomly sampled from the urban population of the Hadera district in Israel. Data on demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics; reports on height, current body weight and body weight at the age of 18 years; knowledge and behavior; and health-care professionals' practices with regard to body weight were obtained by interview. Anthropometric measurements were performed subsequently. Information on BMI was available on 868 participants (49% Arabs, 49% women, median age 46 years). Although the median BMI did not differ significantly between Arabs and Jews at age 18, the prevalence of current obesity was 52% in Arab women compared to 31% in Jewish women (P < 0.001), and 25% in Arab men compared to 23% in Jewish men (P = 0.6). On multivariate analysis, obesity was significantly associated with age, BMI at the age of 18 years, leisure time physical activity and cigarette smoking, but not with ethnicity. Fewer Arabs reported measuring their body weight and Arab women were less frequently advised to maintain an active lifestyle. The high prevalence of obesity among Arab women may be explained by lifestyle characteristics. Prevention of obesity in Arabs should be directed at women and should start preferably before adulthood.\n\nValidation of the GRACE Risk score for hospital mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome in the Arab Middle East.\n\nPubMed\n\nYusufali, Afzalhussein; Zubaid, Mohammad; Al-Zakwani, Ibrahim; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi A; Al-Mallah, Mouaz H; Al Suwaidi, Jassim; AlMahmeed, Wael; Rashed, Wafa; Sulaiman, Kadhim; Amin, Haitham\n\n2011-07-01\n\nOur objective was to validate the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score for in-hospital mortality in a Middle Eastern acute coronary syndrome (ACS) population enrolled in the Gulf Registry of Acute Coronary Events (Gulf RACE). Out of 8176, unselected, consecutive patients with ACS, during 6 months in 2006 and 2007 from 63 hospitals in 6 Arab countries in the Middle East Gulf region, 7709 (94.3%) with available data were included. The main outcome measures were discriminatory performance (using C-index) and calibration of the GRACE risk score (in-hospital mortality predicted by GRACE risk score versus the actual mortality). In-hospital mortality in the Gulf RACE was 3.09% (n = 238). The discriminatory performance of the GRACE risk scores in the Gulf RACE was good overall (C-index = 0.86). Observed and predicted risk corresponded well in each stratum of risk of in-hospital mortality. This suggests its suitability for clinical use in this patient population.\n\nShips at anchor, Gulf of Oman\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThese supertankers, riding at anchor off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, Gulf of Oman (25.5N, 56.5E) cast long shadows and eddy currents in the late afternoon sun. The ships are anchored just outside the Persian Gulf. Because of a surplus of supertankers in the world, many of them are simply moored in the Gulf of Oman where they can be safely anchored and yet be close to the oil ports when activated.\n\nPopulation crisis in the Arab world: an alternative view.\n\nPubMed\n\nBean, L L\n\n1981-01-01\n\nAspects of population policy that are relevant to the Arab world are examined.

The need for each country to develop a policy appropriate to its own perceived needs is stressed.\n\nThe prevalence of Parkinson's disease in an Arab population, Wadi Ara, Israel.\n\nPubMed\n\nMasalha, Rafik; Kordysh, Ella; Alpert, Gershon; Hallak, Maher; Morad, Mohammad; Mahajnah, Muhammad; Farkas, Peter; Herishanu, Yuval\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe prevalence of Parkinson's disease varies among ethnic and geographic groups around the world, being very low in China and high in Argentina. While the main etiology of the disease has yet to be determined, environmental, occupational and genetic factors seem to play important roles. To estimate the prevalence of PD in an Arab Muslim population in Israel, using the drug tracer approach. We studied a Muslim Arab population living in a well-defined geographic area in Israel, with the majority located in two towns and two large villages. Of the approximately 115,000 residents, about 38% are under the age of 15 and 7.75% are older than 65. Drug tracer methodology was applied in this study. All those who were on anti-PD medication were identified and examined by a neurologist to confirm the diagnosis. The overall crude prevalence of PD in this population was low, 43.24/100,000, while the prevalence in the age group above 65 years was 477.32/100,000. Below this age, the prevalence was very low, 12.29/100,000. PD prevalence was higher in males than in females (ratio 1.17); 63% of male patients smoked cigarettes. The prevalence was found to be twice as high among the residents of rural areas, where most inhabitants work in agriculture. The prevalence of PD among the Arab population in Israel is considered low and comparable to that reported in other Arab countries.\n\nHigher Education and Linguistic Dualism in the Arab Gulf\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFindlow, Sally\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis paper examines the spread of English as a medium of higher education in the Arab world, addressing questions about the relationship between higher education, language shift and cultural (re)production through such post-colonial educational bilingualism.

Participants (n = 1100) were randomly selected from the urban population of the Hadera District in Israel. The study sample was stratified into equal groups according to sex, ethnicity (Arabs and Jews) and age. Information on age at diabetes presentation, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics was obtained through personal interviews. Self reports of diabetes were compared with medical records and were found reliable (Îº = 0.87). The risk for diabetes was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Factors associated with diabetes in both ethnic groups were studied using Cox proportional hazard model. The prevalence of adult-onset diabetes was 21% among Arabs and 12% among Jews. Arab participants were younger than Jews at diabetes presentation. By the age of 57 years, 25% of Arabs had diagnosed diabetes; the corresponding age among Jews was 68 years, a difference of 11 years (P < 0.001). The greater risk for diabetes among Arabs was independent of lifestyle factors, family history of diabetes and, among women, history of gestational diabetes; adjusted hazard ratio 1.70; 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.43. Arabs in Israel are at greater risk for adult-onset diabetes than Jews and are younger at diabetes presentation. Culturally sensitive interventions aimed at maintaining normal body weight and active lifestyle should be targeted at this population. Possible genetic factors and gene-environmental interactions underlying the high risk for diabetes among Arabs should be investigated. Â© 2011 The Authors.

These states are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). One of the main stated objectives of the GCC is regional economic integration. This objective was expressed in the GCC Unified Economic Agreement which called for gradual creation of the GCC common market and cooperation and coordination in all economic fields at all levels. The GCC has chosen to approach economic integration in a gradual manner. The first step taken was the formation of a customs union. This study investigates the applicability ofmoreÂ Â» the theory of customs unions to this particular group at this time. The economies of the GCC members exhibit similar characteristics such as reliance on the export of a single nonrenewable commodity (oil), similar large-scale industrial projects (mainly petrochemicals), lack of complementarity of economic resource endowment, and little diversity in industrial production. The main conclusion of the study is that the possible gains suggested by the theory of customs unions are not expected to be realized to a significant extent as a result of forming the GCC customs union. Trade effects (if any) will be negligible due to vari"
