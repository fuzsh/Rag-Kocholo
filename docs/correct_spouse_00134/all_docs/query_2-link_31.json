We are here to build monuments for the flag\n\nHe mentioned Jenin’s governorate continuous achievements, saying “This governorate honored us three times within two days. Yesterday, Jenin camp declared two heroes on the altar of freedom. Also it presented the nation's top high school graduates. Today, we are honored with the university graduation ceremony”.\n\nRepresentative of the President of Palestine Speech\n\nIn the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas speech, his representative Head of Arab American University Board of Trustees Dr. Mohammad Shtayeh said “Congratulation my dear children and to your families. I convey President Mahmoud Abbas greetings which I’m honored to speaking on his behalf. Also congratulation to our children who got their high school results yesterday, we’re proud of you, your success and ambitions”.\n\nHe added “I would like to speak to you as Chairman of Board of Trustees and on behalf of my fellow members of the Board. I thank the Board of Directors, University President and employees for their continuous efforts for the University's progress”.\n\nDr. Shtayeh proceeded “Despite the University new and different experience as Palestine’s first private university, it has introduced new disciplines to meet society’s needs and became an important university locally and regionally, with academic partnerships with International Universities”. He added “Palestine needs its children to build it. Construction needs creators, critics and educational system to learn the skills to accomplish what they wants. Our universities have developed their educational systems to compete with the region’s most important universities. Today, our university graduates works at important international companies, media institutions and research centers. Palestinians are creative despite their suffering, the walls and lack of opportunities”.\n\nHe explained “The Palestinian situation is tough, Gaza, Jerusalem and West Bank are sieged. We suffer from what happens in Gaza and the division heavy burden for the last 10 years. In order to get rid of this suffering and siege, the leadership presented Hamas three points to response to: dissolve shadow government, form national unity government with Hamas as part and run legislative and presidential elections”. “We are ready for reconciliation tomorrow if the points were approved, but we haven’t get any response so far. Abu Mazen is closer than Tehran, Europe and regional alliances. Why do we ask for others help while we’re ready to reconciliation?” he added.\n\nDr. Shtayeh continued “A new year comes filled with crises and wars that affects our Palestinian cause negatively. Even that the Arab area shredded now, but our case still a top priority regionally and internationally. We want a peaceful solution for the Gulf crises, political one for Syria situation and we want everyone to be with Palestine”. He added “We want a peaceful solution to the region crises, enough killing in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. What we are witnessing is painful to all Palestinian because we know asylum, injustice and murders. In this era of Arab degeneration we see Israel the biggest beneficiary, expanding their colonization plans in Palestine and control the Arab world”.\n\n“Reasonable thinking and human development will stop this Arab blood bath. Rich Gulf countries must step in, develop poor Arab countries and make political and social reforms. This is the real solution to the areas dilemmas not wasting billions of dollars on weapons and wars” he proceeded.\n\nOn politics, Dr. Shtayeh mentioned “We know that the American administration is trying to solve the Palestinian issue. President Trump talks about the big deal, but Israel, as usual, is working to confuse any political course by intensifying settlements, continuing Judaization of Jerusalem, filling prisons with prisoners and killing our sons. Only yesterday we lost two young souls Aws Salama and Saad Salah from Jenin Camp” he said. Adding that “The test of the American effort towards peace is its ability to compel Netanyahu to stop settlements, work to end the occupation and establishing Palestinian state, while diving in details is a waste of time”.\n\nHe told the graduates “Palestinian reality is not easy. The road ahead is not paved with silk. There are many economic challenges unemployment and poverty rates are high and employment opportunities are limited, but hope and hard work to achieve your ambitions, innovation and creativity will motivate you after university to start a better life for you and your families. Palestinian youth are our national asset for a better future”. Adding “You are our guarantee to preserve Palestine identity and our inherited heritage. That’s why we helped improving universities infrastructure. The national private sector invested not only in soap factories, oil and marble industry, but also in manufacturing conscious, educated and patriotic human, and this university is a model for education investment”.\n\nDr. Shtayeh asked the students to be loving, creative thinker, work positively and fight all community negativities. The negative and ignorance people are sound thinking enemies, Imam Al-Shaafa'i said “Whenever I debated an ignorant he defeated me and whenever I debated a knowledgeable person I won”. Summing up saying “You are the mighty people. You are this country’s pillars. I am glad to see this thrill in the eyes of your parents. Congratulation and Godspeed”.\n\nAlumni’s Speech\n\nIn the alumni speech student Anstansia Qarwani said “It is a great pleasure to stand at this honorable ceremony by the Arab American University, my university, which I am proud to be its student and graduate. I still remember my first days in its corridors. As I found here a space for my ambition, I found my hopes and the urge to continue and move forward.” She added “As the years passed, I met in this distinguished university many people who only look like themselves. They gave me hope and frankly I wouldn’t meet this diverse mix anywhere else. As time passed I knew what distinguishes my university, in addition to its academic distinct, its environment that embraces different Palestinian students. Diversity is what you will find in life and work, it reflects the reality in which you will live”.\n\nShe proceeded “This University have united the divided Palestinians by the occupation and who have found a way to achieve their dreams and ambitions. This university has a great national role. It contributed in shaping me not only in knowledge, but also in terms of identity because it helped redefine our relationship with our historical Palestinian extension. Some may not feel this directly, but their involvement in this institution without a doubt left an impact at their subconscious, and this is important”.\n\nQarwani said “A whole life is waiting for us, full of challenges. Perhaps our previous experiences are only a drop in the sea of this life with its waves beating the strong and weak alike. There may be moments when we have no hope or futility, with life hitting us, not waiting for anyone. It may all be or may not be. But for today, think of your success only, it’s your right to rejoice in what you have achieved with your effort and perseverance”.\n\nShe concluded “Like you, I’m happy, but I’m a little bit sad too, for leaving this remarkable edifice where I experienced its beauty. During my few years here, less than four years, I saw how it developed, experienced significant changes not only in architecture, but also academically. This positive atmosphere had a great impact on my academic excellence and desire for the best. Arab American University is one of Jenin’s paradises and a hope for the city and Palestine”.\n\nThe ceremony included artistic performances by university choir.
