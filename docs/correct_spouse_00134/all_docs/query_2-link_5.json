        "text": "Angham Mohamed Ali Suleiman (Arabic: أنغام محمد علي; born 19 January 1972), known by the mononym Angham (Arabic: أنغام), is an Egyptian singer, recording artist, and actress. Her debut was in 1987 under the guidance of her father, Mohammad Suleiman. Following her divorce from Magdy Aref in 2000, Angham took much more control over her image and musical style after that Leih Sebtaha (Why Did You Leave Her) record established her into a strong position amid the constant emerge of new voices in the Middle East music scene. After a highly publicized feud between Alam El Phan Music Records' president Mohsen Gaber and the artist, She moved to another record company, Rotana."
