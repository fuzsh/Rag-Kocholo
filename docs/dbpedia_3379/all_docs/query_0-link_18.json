        "text": "http://english.columbia.edu/\n\nThe English and Comparative Literature Department:\n\nDepartmental Office: 602 Philosophy Hall; 212-854-3215\n\nhttp://www.english.columbia.edu\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Prof. Nicholas Dames, 603 Philosophy; 212-854-4016; nicholas.dames@columbia.edu\n\nUndergraduate Coordinator: Alexa Adams, 602 Philosophy; 212-854-6295; enclundergraduatecoordinator@columbia.edu\n\nThe Study of English and Comparative Literature\n\nThe program in English fosters the ability to read critically and imaginatively, to appreciate the power of language to shape thought and represent the world, and to be sensitive to the ways in which literature is created and achieves its effects. It has several points of departure, grounding the teaching of critical reading in focused attention to the most significant works of English literature, in the study of the historical and social conditions surrounding literary production and reception, and in theoretical reflection on the process of writing and reading and the nature of the literary work.\n\nThe courses the department offers draw on a broad range of methodologies and theoretical approaches, from the formalist to the political to the psychoanalytical (to mention just a few). Ranging from the medieval period to the 21st century, the department teaches major authors alongside popular culture, traditional literary genres alongside verbal forms that cut across media, and canonical British literature alongside postcolonial, global, and trans-Atlantic literatures.\n\nAt once recognizing traditional values in the discipline and reflecting its changing shape, the major points to three organizing principles for the study of literature—history, genre, and geography. Requiring students not only to take a wide variety of courses but also to arrange their thinking about literature on these very different grids, the major gives them broad exposure to the study of the past, an understanding of the range of forms that can shape literary meaning, and an encounter with the various geographical landscapes against which literature in English has been produced.\n\nStudent Advising\n\nConsulting Advisers\n\nQuestions about coursework or program requirements can be addressed to the department’s Undergraduate Coordinator, to the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS), or to any member of the department’s Committee on Undergraduate Education (CUE). The DUS and CUE are the department’s de facto academic advisors, and hold open office hours each week to offer guidance to majors, minors, and concentrators, as well as those interested in declaring in future.\n\nNewly-declared majors or minors should make an appointment with the DUS or a CUE member to discuss their academic plans as soon as possible after declaration. They should also contact the Undergraduate Coordinator and request that their names be added to the department’s listserv, which disseminates information and updates about courses, events, deadlines, and other matters.\n\nThroughout the year, the CUE will also organize dedicated information sessions about graduate study, professional development, fellowship and prize applications, and more.\n\nCourse Information\n\nLectures\n\nGenerally, lectures are addressed to a broad audience and do not assume previous course work in the area, unless prerequisites are noted in the description. The size of some lectures is limited. Senior majors have preference unless otherwise noted, followed by junior majors, followed by senior and junior non-majors. Students are responsible for checking for any special registration procedures on-line at https://english.columbia.edu/content/course-listings.\n\nSeminars\n\nThe department regards seminars as opportunities for students to do advanced undergraduate work in fields in which they have already had some related course experience. With the exception of some CLEN classes (in which, as comparative courses, much material is read in translation), students’ admission to a seminar presupposes their having taken ENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary Study. During the three weeks preceding the registration period, students should check https://english.columbia.edu/content/course-listings for application instructions for individual seminars. Applications to seminars are usually due by the end of the week preceding registration. Students should always assume that the instructor’s permission is necessary; those who register without having secured the instructor’s permission are not guaranteed admission.\n\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities\n\nIndependent Study Projects\n\nDuring the regular academic semester, students may design and undertake an individualized Independent Study with the sponsorship of a faculty member, in order to pursue a particular interest that is not represented in a given semester’s course offerings.\n\nMost Independent Study projects are awarded 3 points of academic credit, but proposals can stipulate anywhere from 1-4 points, depending on workload. For guidance on course points, see here.\n\nTo propose an Independent Study, please complete this form and submit it to the Undergraduate Coordinator no later than two weeks prior to the start of classes, for review by the DUS and CUE.\n\nNote that you cannot register for an independent study without official departmental approval.\n\nThe Richmond Williams Travelling Fellowship\n\nThe Williams Fellowship supports summer research projects requiring foreign travel, with grants of up to $6000.00. The competition is open to any Columbia College junior majoring in English and Comparative Literature. Recipients of the award must undertake a significant piece of independent scholarship based on their research in the senior year – either as an independent study, or as part of the Senior Essay program. The application can be found on the department website here. Note: it is highly recommended that applicants review Columbia’s Undergraduate International Travel Policy before and during the application process.\n\nThe Humanities Research Scholars Program\n\nThe Humanities Research Scholars Program (HRSP) offers a select group of rising juniors at Columbia College the opportunity to pursue independent research projects and to develop analytical and investigative skills that will serve them well in any future endeavor. This program is designed to help students learn from one another as well as from leaders in the academic and professional world, and to support students in their intellectual pursuits and their future growth. It focuses on students interested in research in the humanities or humanistic social sciences.\n\nHumanities Research Scholars will engage in two main pursuits over the course of one summer session of research: (1) the development of knowledge, skills, and approaches to the study of the humanities that will be transferable to any professional field; and (2) the development of an independent research project over six weeks of the summer that allows the exploration of a specific topic with guidance from a faculty member.\n\nLearn more about the HRSP here.\n\nOther opportunities\n\nThe Undergraduate Research and Fellowships office frequently posts opportunities for research across fields, here. Within English, faculty occasionally seek research assistants for help on specific projects; such calls for research assistants are usually made through the departmental listserv.\n\nThe Senior Essay Program\n\nThe Senior Essay program is an opportunity for majors in English and Comparative Literature to explore some literary topic of special interest to them in depth. Essay projects typically involve extensive critical reading and/or original research, and result in a piece of written work (approximately 10,000 words) that constitutes a substantial critical or scholarly argument.\n\nTo undertake a Senior Essay, students must first register for the fall research methods seminar, ENGL UN3795. In the spring, essayists then continue work on their projects with the guidance of a dedicated faculty advisor, and submit their final drafts in April. Examples of past Senior Essays in English can be found here.\n\nNote that English majors are not required to write a Senior Essay (although it is a requirement for eligibility for Departmental Honors).\n\nDepartmental Honors and Academic Prizes\n\nDepartmental Honors:\n\nEach year, in consultation with the faculty, the CUE awards Departmental Honors to no more than 10% of graduating majors. Honors are determined on the basis of the Senior Essay, as well as performance in departmental coursework and participation in departmental culture.\n\nAcademic Prizes:\n\nThe English department awards numerous prizes for critical and creative writing each year; information about these prizes can be found here.\n\nThe Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS)\n\nThe DAR is a useful tool for students to monitor their progress toward degree requirements, but it is not an official document for the major or concentration, nor should it replace consultation with departmental advisers. The department’s director of undergraduate studies is the final authority on whether requirements for the major have been met. Furthermore, the DAR may be inaccurate or incomplete for any number of reasons—for example, courses taken elsewhere and approved for credit do not show up on the DAR report as fulfilling a specific requirement.\n\nStudents should fill out a Major Requirements Worksheet early in the semester preceding graduation. The worksheet must be reviewed by an adviser and submitted to 602 Philosophy before the registration period for the final semester. The worksheet is available in the English Department or on the department website here.\n\nOnline Information\n\nOther departmental information—faculty office hours, registration instructions, late changes, etc.—is available on the departmental website.\n\nGuidance for Undergraduate Students in the Department\n\nProgram Planning for all Students\n\nThere are many paths through a degree in English and Comparative Literature, even within the requirements described below. Students considering a major or minor are encouraged to make an appointment with the DUS to discuss their particular interests and goals. They should also feel free to enroll in one of the department’s gateway lectures (1000-level), which have no prerequisites. Students who are already embarked on a degree in English should also be sure to check in with the DUS or a member of CUE regularly to ensure that they complete their requirements in the most rewarding way possible.\n\nEnrolling in Courses\n\nIn the weeks before registration, the departmental website will continually update course information, including prerequisites and course caps. Please be sure to check each course’s particular registration guidelines, as these can vary dramatically; for seminars, in particular, instructor permission is required for enrollment, and instructors will often require a specific application in order to consider any student for admission.\n\nApproaches to Literary Study\n\nThe introductory course ENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary Study, together with its companion seminar, ENGL UN2001 Approaches to Literary Study Seminar, is required for the English major, minor, or concentration. It should be taken by the end of the sophomore year. Fulfillment of this requirement is a factor in admission to seminars and to some lectures. This once-a-week faculty lecture, accompanied by a seminar led by an advanced graduate student in the department, is intended to introduce students to the study of literature. Students read works from the three major literary modes (lyric, drama, and narrative), drawn from premodern to contemporary literature, and learn interpretative techniques required by these various modes or genres. This course does not fulfill any distribution requirements.\n\nCourse Numbering Structure\n\n1000-level: Courses in this tier are broad gateway lectures, and do not require prior knowledge of or coursework in English.\n\n2000-level: Courses in this tier are lectures focused on more specialized topics. These courses may have prerequisites at the instructors’ discretion, and may also offer weekly discussion sections to complement lectures.\n\n3000-level: Courses in this tier are seminars intended for English majors and minors (though others are welcome to apply), and are capped at 18 students. While particular seminars may have particular requirements for admission, seminar applicants are generally expected to have taken ENGL 2000: Approaches to Literary Study.\n\n4000-level: Courses in this tier are advanced seminars, which require significantly more reading and writing than other courses offered by the department. Priority for enrollment will be given to senior English majors, although faculty may admit others (including graduate students) if space permits.\n\nUndergraduate Programs of Study\n\nMajor in English (for students who matriculated in 2023-4 and prior)\n\nPlease read Guidelines for all English and Comparative Literature Majors and Concentrators above.\n\nAt least 10 courses in English, including:\n\nThe Introductory Course\n\neither ENGL 3001: Literary Texts and Critical Methods, or ENGL 2000: Approaches to Literary Study\n\nDistribution Requirements\n\none course focused on each of the following genres (3 courses total): poetry, prose, drama/film/media\n\none course focused on each of the following geographical areas (3 courses total): British, American, Global/Comparative\n\nthree courses focused on literature pre-1800 (only one of which can be a Shakespeare course)\n\n(Designations of distribution requirements can be found on the department’s course listings site; note that a single course can fulfill more than one distribution requirement; Shakespeare 1, for example, would cover British, drama, and one pre-1800).\n\nMajor in English (for students who matriculated in 2024-5 and after)\n\nAt least 10 courses in English, including:\n\nThe Introductory Course\n\nENGL 2000: Approaches to Literary Study\n\nDistribution Requirements\n\none course focused on each of the following genres (3 courses total): poetry, prose, drama/film/media\n\none course focused on each of the following geographical areas (3 courses total): British, American, Global/Comparative\n\none course focused on the study of ethnicity and race\n\ntwo courses focused on literature pre-1700 (only one of which can be a Shakespeare course)\n\none course focused on literature 1700-1900\n\none course focused on literature 1900-present\n\n(Designations of distribution requirements can be found on the department’s course listings site; note that a single course can fulfill more than one distribution requirement; Shakespeare 1, for example, would cover British, drama, and one pre-1700).\n\nCapstone\n\neither a Senior Essay or an advanced (4000-level) seminar\n\nMinor in English\n\nAny 5 courses in English, including ENGL 2000: Approaches to Literary Study.
