        "text": "Archive: June 2003\n\nBack to the News Archive Index\n\nJUNE 30 - HICKS SATISFIED WITH GYM CHANGE\n\nHicks at Gemini in 2002\n\nFormer Canadian national champion Danielle Hicks is spending her final weeks of preparation before the upcoming world championship team trials at the Academy of Sport and Fitness under the tutelage of former coach Paula Johnson. Hicks previously trained at ASF from 1999 to 2001, but spent the last two years at Oshawa's Gemini Gymnastics Club under coaches Elena Davydova and Valery Yahchybekov. At Gemini, Hicks claimed the national title, represented Canada at the 2002 Pacific Alliance Championships, where she finished sixth on vault, and at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, where she placed fourth on her speciality, the balance beam.\n\nThe second half of 2002 was more frustrating for Hicks, with a lingering back injury ultimately preventing her from competing at the individual apparatus world championships and later Elite Canada. In that time, strain developed between Hicks and the Gemini club, resulting in the decision to move back to ASF. \"I needed to be at a club that supports me and makes me feel part of the team,\" Hicks told Gymn.ca this week. Despite the gym change, Hicks remains close with her former Gemini coaches, Davydova and Yahchybekov, who fought for Hicks' rights as an athlete at Gemini.\n\nAt ASF, Hicks has regained her motivation and is enjoying a resurgence with her gymnastics. She has also fully recovered from the ankle injury she sustained at the 2003 Romanian International and has now been cleared to train all four events. Hicks has used the time off to upgrade her uneven bar routine, where she is prepared to debut new elements. She is not yet training full difficulty on floor exercise, however, and as a result, Hicks is not certain whether she will be ready to compete all four events at trials (she will compete at least three). Hicks is also in discussions with several NCAA teams, and is now beginning the recruiting process in earnest.\n\nHer mother, Brenda, has been equally pleased with the change. \"We are very lucky that Paula and Danielle are able to work together again,\" she told Gymn.ca. \"This is a lot of work for Paula to pick up an athlete in her last year [prior to NCAA gymnastics] and she is a good person. She is re-organizing everything around Danielle and her needs. I don't know of any other club that would do that at the last minute.\"\n\nCanada's best female athletes will converge on Toronto for the world championship team trials at Seneca College from July 12-13. Gymn.ca will be providing extensive coverage of the meet, which will help to select the six athletes that will represent Canada at the upcoming world championships in Anaheim, California.\n\nJUNE 22 - SANDERS WINS 2003 U.S. NATIONALS\n\nRhythmic superstar Mary Sanders, who sports dual citizenship with Canada and the United States, is competing in her second U.S. National Championships this weekend. Sanders, who trains at Ritmika Rhythmic Club in Toronto, outscored silver medalist Olga Karmansky (Isadora Rhythmics; 99.900) by almost 10 full points Friday, to take the all around title for the second straight year. Lisa Wang of Rhythmic Gems finished third (96.275).\n\nSanders recently officially declared her intent to compete soley for the United States. \"It was a huge step to take and a big risk because it could end my career just as easily as start it,\" Sanders told USAG. \"I talked to my coach and she stuck by my side no matter what I did, and I got a lot of support from the U.S. The environment here is great and the people are amazing.\"\n\nChampionships continue today in Milwaukee, with the men contesting the all around title and the rhythmic ladies contesting individual event titles. Results are being posted to USA Gymnastics.\n\nUpdate: Sanders won all four event titles in the senior rhythmic competition!\n\nJUNE 15 - RHYTHMIC NATIONALS CONCLUDE; INTERNATIONAL ASSIGNMENTS NAMED\n\nAlexandra Orlando\n\nCourtesy of Tom Theobald\n\nBao Bao Dou (BC) continued on her winning streak, just one medal shy of a gold medal sweep. Dou captured three gold (free, hoop, ball) and one silver (rope). All around runner Demetra Mantcheva (BC) up was the gymnast, who stopped her, took gold in the rope and three silvers in the remaining apparatus. Ontarios Laura Chin won two bronze medals (free, ball), while Martina Vortel (BC) and Jacqueline Man (ON) each earned a bronze for their rope and hoop routines respectively.\n\nIn the junior competition, Ontarios Stefanie Carew revenged her 2nd place in the all around by claiming three gold medals in hoop, clubs, and ribbon, and a silver in rope. However, Junior Champion Jessica Krushen (BC) matched her gold from yesterday in the rope event, as well as taking home three additional silver medals in the other apparatus. Nathalie Ngos consistent performances earned her a bronze medal in each of the apparatus finals.\n\nSenior standout Alexandra Orlando (ON) extended her domination, completing her gold medal sweep for a total of five throughout the competition. BCs Megan Hui earned three silver medals (hoop, ball, clubs), but trouble in ribbon opened the door for Judy Berecz, who also secured the bronze in the ball and club events. Yana Tsidaridze (QP) finished the weekend with two bronze medals in rope and ribbon.\n\nTeam Ontario claimed the Tamara Bompa Cup, which is awarded to the top province. In addition the following teams were also announced:\n\n- Pan American Games  Alexandra Orlando, Megan Hui (coach Mimi Masleva) and the National Senior Group (Roxana Cervantes, Irina Funtikova, Pamela Jewell, Emilie Livingston, Sarah Stock  coach Zdravka Tchonkova)\n\n- World Championships  Alexandra Orlando, Megan Hui, Judy Berecz and the National Senior Group\n\n- Aeon Cup  Ritmika RSG Club (Alexandra Orlando, Carly Orava, Nathalie Ngo).\n\nComplete results will soon be available on RGC.ca.\n\nJUNE 14 - KRUSHEN AND CAREW BATTLE FOR GOLD AT 2003 JUNIOR RHYTHMIC NATIONALS; ORLANDO RUNS AWAY WITH GOLD IN SENIORS\n\nThe Junior all around came down to the wire, however the supple and charismatic Jessica Krushen (Okanagan, BC) took top spot over the consistent and technically superb Stefanie Carew (Seneca, ON) by the smallest of margins  75.783 to 75.766. Nathalie Ngo slipped one spot on the National team to claim the bronze medal.\n\nBCs Julianna Semenova (Academy  68.333) had some difficulty with clubs, but managed to earn fourth position, meanwhile ribbon trouble did not stop Katia Zaitseva from securing fifth position. The remaining positions on the National team were filled by Suzy Lendvay (Burlington, ON  64.933), Brihana Mosienko (Academy, BC  63.499), and Tracey Chu (HPTC, MB  61.784).\n\nAlexandra Orlando\n\nCourtesy of Tom Theobald\n\nThe Senior All around was virtually in the bag; nevertheless Ontarios Alexandra Orlando (Ritmika) gave the audience a treat with her spunky style and risky routines as she clinched the championship title with a score of 90.550. Megan Hui (Aura, BC), whose injury earlier on in the season kept her from competing at Elite Canada, combined solid routines with great improvements to earn her the silver medal (71.875). The strong and powerful Judy Berecz (Edmonton, AB) came in third with 71.550. Yana Tsikaridze (Questo, QP  69.325), who possesses tremendous presence on the floor, rounded out the top four.\n\nFormer junior standout, Olesia Zakon (Club Elite, BC) continues her impressive transition to senior despite slipping a few places on the National Team (68.80). Following her is another first year senior, Ontarios Carly Orava (Ritmika), whos consistent performances earned her sixth place with a score of (67.20).

The very expressive Demetra Mantcheva (Aura, BC) came in at 59.00 for the silver medal, while her teammate Ekaterina Yakubovich earned the bronze with 58.283.\n\nRepresenting the other side of the country, New Brunswick's Rosie Cossar (Romanesc) used her long lines to take fourth place with a score of 54.582. A trio of the host province's athletes claimed the next three positions; Natalia Murzenko (Kalev, ON - 54.217), Laura Chin (York Stars, ON - 53.850), and Jacqueline Man (Ritmika, ON - 53.649). Coming in eighth position was Edmonton RG's Caitlin Marchak.\n\nAfter two apparatus in the Junior division, defending National Champion Stefanie Carew (Seneca, ON) leads the way. However, experienced Jessica Krushen (Okanagan, BC), Nathalie Ngo (Ritmika, ON), and Julianna Semenova (Academy, BC) are hot on her heals.\n\nThe overall results will be awarded in both the Junior and Senior categories tomorrow.\n\nJUNE 11 - RHYTHMIC CHAMPIONSHIPS BEGIN TOMORROW\n\nThe 2003 Canadian National Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships begin tomorrow at Toronto's Humber College.
