On top of the 11 days of elite sporting competition, there was live entertainment, cultural highlights, fanzones and big screens, street theatre and something happening on every corner. Famed the world over for great crowds, great atmosphere and putting on a great show, this was Glasgow’s chance to do it on a record-breaking scale.

Also for the first time in the Games history, actually at any multi-sport event in the world, a number of full medal events for elite athletes with a disability (EAD) were included in a fully integrated sports programme.\n\nCanadian Team Chef de Mission - Marg McGregor\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Daniel Igali (Wrestling)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - Lori-Ann Muenzer (Cycling)\n\nCanadian team fun facts:\n\nTeam Size: 270 Athletes\n\nYoungest Athlete: Alexadre Déspatie (17) Diving; Kylie Stone (15) Gymnastics\n\nOldest Athlete: Frank Kurenda (58) Shooting; Vivian Berkeley (61) Lawn Bowls\n\nCanadian Medals: 117 = Gold 31; Silver 41; Bronze 45\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1998 Commonwealth Games - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\nFor the first time ever, the Commonwealth Games were held in Asia.

The end of apartheid saw the return of South Africa to the Commonwealth Games and ensured that the era of threatened boycotts was over. The 1994 Commonwealth Games logo was a celebration ribbon - embodied the energy, festivity and motion of the Games. The sweep of the red, white and blue ribbon represented the Roman Numbers XV, and the V represented both Victoria and Victory. The mascot symbolised fun, festivities and the host city's popular culture as a tradition at major sporting events. \"Klee Wych\", the Killer Whale, was symbolic of the intelligent sociable and graceful animals native to Canadian waters, and especially associated with the beauty and vitality of British Columbia. The name Klee Wych was picked after a competition and it is broadly translated as \"the laughing one\" in Nuu-chah Nulth peoples' language.\n\nCanadian Team Chef de Mission - Judy Kent\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Angela Chalmers (Athletics)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - Michel Dion (Shooting)\n\nCanadian team fun facts:\n\nTeam Size: 275 Athletes\n\nYoungest Athlete: Jason Caswell (15) Shooting; Jaime Hill (15) Gymnastics\n\nOldest Athlete: Ronald Jones (64) Lawn Bowls; Leona Peterson (60) Lawn Bowls\n\nCanadian Medals: 129 = Gold 40; Silver 42; Bronze 49\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1990 Commonwealth Games - Auckland, New Zealand\n\nThankfully, the threatened boycott gave way to a new positive spirit of co-operation far more in keeping with the image of “The Friendly Games” and a new record of 55 nations participated. The XIV Commonwealth Games were the third to be hosted by New Zealand and Auckland’s second.\n\nCanadian Team General Team Manager - Jim Daly\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Tom Ponting (Swimming)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - Mike Smith (Decathlon)\n\nCanadian team fun facts:\n\nTeam Size: 242 Athletes\n\nYoungest Athlete: Peter Ogilvie (17) Athletics; Janet Morin (14) Gymnastics\n\nOldest Athlete: Sandy Peden (55) Shooting; Tina Reimer (65) Lawn Bowls\n\nMost Commonwealth Games Attended: John Primrose (5th) Shooting;\n\nCanadian Medals: 113 = Gold 35; Silver 41; Bronze 37\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1986 Commonwealth Games - Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nAfter nearly two decades successfully averting political stay-aways and protests because of apartheid and sanction-busting sports tours to South Africa, the XIII Games, the second to be staged at Edinburgh, was to become known as “the Boycott Games”. Sadly, despite there being so many fond memories of the Scottish hospitality offered in 1970, 32 Commonwealth nations decided that they could not attend, because of their opposition to apartheid in sports. Twenty-six nations did attend the second Edinburgh Games.\n\nCanadian Team General Team Manager - Jim Daly\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Ben Johnson (Athletics)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - Sharon Bowes (Shooting)\n\nCanadian team fun facts:\n\nYoungest Athlete: Turlough O'Hare (17) Swimming; Allison Higson (13) Swimming\n\nOldest Athlete: Harold Willsie (58) Shooting; Nell Hunter (71) Lawn Bowls\n\nCanadian Medals: 116 = Gold 51; Silver 34; Bronze 31\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1982 Commonwealth Games - Brisbane, Australia\n\nOnce again, a boycott was avoided and the sun shone throughout the duration of the XII Games. The 1982 Commonwealth Games mascot was a kangaroo named Matilda, and proved to be one of the most successful parts of the marketing program for the Games. It was simple, but uniquely Australian. Matilda was popular all around the world.\n\nCanadian Team General Team Manager - Allan Fitzpatrick\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - John Primrose (Shooting)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - Alex Baumann (Swimming)\n\nCanadian team fun facts:\n\nYoungest Athlete: Alain Metellus (17) Athletics; Donna McGinnis (14) Swimming\n\nOldest Athlete: Ron Jones (52) Lawn Bowls; Agnes Bowlby (61) Lawn Bowls\n\nCanadian Medals: 82 = Gold 26; Silver 23; Bronze 33\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1978 Commonwealth Games - Edmonton, Canada\n\nThe XI Games was the first to bear the current day name of the Commonwealth Games. Edmonton organisers had to walk a careful tightrope in the lead up to the Games to ensure that there was no repeat of the African nations boycott of the 1976 Montreal Olympics caused by a New Zealand rugby tour of South Africa . The 1978 Commonwealth Games mascot was Keyano. The mascot represented the Swan Hills Grizzly Bear, native to Alberta, Canada, and found only in the Swan Hills, a heavily-forested mountain region of North Alberta. It is one of North America's largest bears and, at maturity, can weigh more than 400 kg. Its fur is a medium-brown colour and is long and shaggy. ‘Keyano’ is a Cree Indian word meaning ‘unity and brotherhood’, and appropriately describes the Friendly Games.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Russ Prior (Weightlifting)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - Ray Takahashi (Wrestling)\n\nCanadian team fun facts:\n\nMost Medals Won: Male - Graham Smith (6 gold) Swimming\n\nCanadian Medals: 109 = Gold 45; Silver 31; Bronze 33\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1974 British Commonwealth Games - Christchurch, New Zealand\n\nFollowing the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, the X Games at Christchurch was the first multi-sport event to place the safety of participants and spectators as its uppermost requirement. Security guards surrounded the athlete’s village and there was an exceptionally high-profile police presence.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Jamie Paulson (Badminton)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - Jules Sobrian (Shooting)\n\nCanadian Medals: 62 = Gold 25; Silver 19; Bronze 18\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1970 British Commonwealth Games - Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nThe IX Games in Edinburgh will be remembered for a number of firsts: first time that metric distances and electronic photo-finish technology were employed and the first time that HM Queen Elizabeth II attended in her capacity as Head of the Commonwealth.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Ralph Hutton (Swimming)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian Medals: 66 = Gold 18; Silver 24; Bronze 24\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1966 British Empire & Commonwealth Games - Kingston, Jamaica\n\nWith the British Empire formally ended, the Kingston, Jamaica Games became the VIII British Commonwealth Games. There was worry amongst the larger nations that Jamaica’s infrastructure would not be able to successfully deliver the Games – but Kingston proved us wrong!\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Bill Crothers (Athletics)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian Medals: 57 = Gold 14; Silver 20; Bronze 23\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1962 British Empire & Commonwealth Games - Perth, Australia\n\nThe VII Commonwealth Games are remembered for their “heat, dust and glory”. The day before the Perth Games opened the temperature was an expected 80 degrees Fahrenheit, but the heat was measured at 105 degrees at the opening ceremony in the new Perry Lakes Stadium the following day and such extremes persisted throughout the Games’ duration. In the previous 65 years, only 10 100 degree plus days had been recorded in Perth. Australian soldiers were pressed into action, ferrying water to competing athletes.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Gordon Dickson (Athletics)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian Medals: 31 = Gold 4; Silver 12; Bronze 15\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1958 British Empire & Commonwealth Games - Cardiff, Wales\n\nThe VI Games marked the largest sporting event ever held in Wales and it was the smallest country ever to host a British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Cardiff had to wait 12 years longer than originally scheduled to become host of the Games, as the 1946 event was cancelled because of World War II. The Cardiff Games were to be South Africa’s last until their post-apartheid return to the Games in 1994. A number of objections against South Africa took place in Cardiff because their team had been selected on the basis of race and colour rather than ability. South Africa subsequently withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961 for 30 years.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Doug Clement (Athletics)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - Wayne Pretti (Rowing)\n\nCanadian Medals: 27 = Gold 1; Silver 10; Bronze 16\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1954 British Empire & Commonwealth Games - Vancouver, Canada\n\nVancouver set new standards in organisation and presentation of not only Commonwealth Games but all multi-sport Games of the times. The athletes oath was taken by a Canadian, Bill Parnell, which for the first time would reflect the involvement of Commonwealth nations, outside of the British Empire. The Games put Vancouver on the world stage with The ‘Miracle Mile’. Both Roger Bannister of England (Gold Medallist) and John Landy of Australia (Silver Medallist) ran the mile in under four minutes, in an event that was televised live across the world for the first time.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - Gerard Gratton (Weightlifting)\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian Medals: 43 = Gold 9; Silver 20; Bronze 14\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1950 British Empire Games - Auckland, New Zealand\n\nWorld War II interrupted the staging of the British Empire Games scheduled for 1942 and 1946, however the enthusiasm from within the British Empire to continue what was started in 1930 was strong. The IV Games were awarded to New Zealand, and held in the nation’s largest city, Auckland.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian Medals: 30 = Gold 8; Silver 9; Bronze 13\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1938 British Empire Games - Sydney, Australia\n\nHeld in the southern hemisphere for the first time, the III Games opening ceremony took place at the famed Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 40,000 spectators.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian Medals: 44 = Gold 13; Silver 16; Bronze 15\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1934 British Empire Games - London, England\n\nThis was the last time that Newfoundland took part independent of Canada. A highlight of the 1934 Games was the inclusion of events for women in athletics. Originally scheduled for Johannesburg, South Africa, the II Games were hosted by London, in order to avoid a political crisis over South Africa's 'Apartheid' policy and its implications on visiting Commonwealth athletes and officials.\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Opening Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian team flag bearer: Closing Ceremonies - * Not Available\n\nCanadian Medals: 49 = Gold 15; Silver 25; Bronze 9\n\nDetailed Results\n\n1930 British Empire Games - Hamilton, Canada\n\nThe city of Hamilton proved a gracious first host of the Commonwealth Games. The Games then were called the British Empire Games. The athletes’ village was the Prince of Wales School next to the Civic Stadium, where the competitors slept two dozen to a classroom. Despite missing some basic comforts, the participants were unanimous in their praise for the Games and Hamilton’s hospitality. The Hamilton Games ran at a cost of $97,973.00"
