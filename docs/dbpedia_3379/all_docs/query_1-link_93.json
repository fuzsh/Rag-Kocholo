        "text": "Andy Kaufmann is a successful entrepreneur and businessman who started in his family business while a child. Andy learned a great deal about business from his first real life hero, his father. One of his duties included assembling first aid kits for his father's business, which in return his father paid him in baseball cards. In 1999, Andy graduated from Emerson College with a degree in Marketing on a mission to build brands. After selling his most recent company, UST Brands, he acquired Majority Ownership of the Miracle on January 8th, 2019. The team was rebranded the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels and also is a partner with the Minnesota Twins Spring Training. In July 2018, Andy formed a group of Jacksonville based investors and purchased the Jacksonville Icemen, creating the only locally owned sports team in Jacksonville. That group has expanded to include such sports stars as Tim Tebow (College Football, NFL and prior NY Mets prospect), Daniel Murphy (MLB Baseball star), Myles Jack (NFL star) and Reggie Hayward (former NFL star) among other successful investors. Since then, Andy has continued to grow Zawyer Sports & Entertainment by purchasing the Jacksonville Ice & Sportsplex, the now Community First Igloo, the latest ECHL expansion team in Savannah, GA, the Savannah Ghost Pirates, Lake Tahoe Pro Hockey, Marketing Agency based in Jacksonville, FL, 32 Degrees Marketing, and Screen Printing & Embroidery shop, Expert T's. Zawyer Sports & Entertainment also manages the Atlanta Gladiators. Zawyer Sports continues to grow as the business seeks new team and venue opportunities.\n\nAndy, his wife Farah and their sons Sawyer and Zachary live and are very active in the Jacksonville community.\n\nRunner up for ECHL Executive of the Year in 2018-19, Einhorn oversees all day to day operations for Zawyer Sports & Entertainment including ticket sales, premium sales, marketing, and merchandise. Under Einhorn's guidance, the Icemen have finished number one in group sales for the previous three seasons, won Group Sales Department of the Year in 2018-19, 21-22, and 22-23, and was voted number 1 sports franchise in Jacksonville by Action Jax News.\n\nPrior to starting up the Jacksonville Icemen, Einhorn oversaw all sales and marketing efforts for the Orlando Predators, Arena Football team. Einhorn moved to Florida back in 2011 to oversee all ticket sales efforts for the new Orlando Solar Bears. Under Einhorn's guidance, the Solar Bears set ticket records and was awarded the Ticket Sales Department of the Year in 2014-15.\n\nEinhorn began his career at Binghamton University as he moved up the ranks within the Athletic Department working as the school's mascot, a Sports Marketing Intern, and then in his third year as a Graduate Assistant. Einhorn interned over summers for the Hudson Valley Renegades as the Assistant Marketing Director overseeing pre-game set-up, ceremonial first pitches, and sponsorship activation. From there, Einhorn moved on to work at ESPN Radio, working major events such as Belmont Stakes, \"Lunch with Alexi Lalas,\" Jets' training camp, and press conferences at Madison Square Garden. Upon graduation in May, 2011 he began working with the New York Islanders Hockey Club as a Sales Executive.\n\nA native of Warwick, NY, Einhorn graduated Magna Cum Laude from Binghamton University in 2010 and in 2011 he received his MBA from Binghamton. Einhorn currently resides in St. Augustine, FL with his wife, sons, and black lab.\n\nWinner of the ECHL Marketing Team of the Year in 2022-23, Muni oversees all marketing, web, creative services, media buying, and social media for the Zawyer Sports & Entertainment entities, including the Jacksonville Icemen, Savannah Ghost Pirates, Atlanta Gladiators, Tahoe Knight Monsters, Allen Americans, Gastonia Baseball Club, 32 Degrees Marketing, and Igloo.
