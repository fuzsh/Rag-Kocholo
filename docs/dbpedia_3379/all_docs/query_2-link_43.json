        "text": "Five former Indiana State athletes have competed in past Olympics including Bruce Baumgartner, Larry Bird, Benita Edds, and Bryan Leturgez, and current throws coach Erin Gilreath. Kurt Thomas was on the 1980 United States Olympic gymnastics team but was unable to compete as the United States boycotted the games.\n\nBRUCE BAUMGARTNER\n\nBruce Baumgartner is one of the most heralded Indiana State University graduates in national and international competition. He won the NCAA championship in the heavyweight division as a senior at Indiana State, completing a perfect season with a 44-0 record. He was the NCAA runner up in the heavyweight division as a sophomore and junior and finished his Sycamore career with a 134-12 record with 73 falls.\n\nBaumgartner is one of the most decorated American wrestlers of all-time and just one of eight athletes to medal in four different Olympiads. He became America’s first gold medalist in 60 years of super heavyweight wrestling when he won gold at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. He also won gold at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, a silver at the 1988 Games in Seoul, and a bronze at the 1996 Games at Atlanta. He was also chosen captain of the USA Olympic Team in 1996 and carried the U.S. Flag during the opening ceremonies in front of more than 600 United States athletes.\n\nHe won the World Championship three times (1986 in Budapest, 1993 in Toronto, and 1995 in Atlanta) while also earning three silver medals and three bronze . Baumgartner also won three gold medals at the Pan American Games (1987 Indianapolis, 1991 Havana, and 1995 Mar de Plata) after earning a silver medal at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas. He also has four Olympic Festival titles, two AAU National titles, and a Junior National title.\n\nBaumgartner was presented the James E. Sullivan Award in 1995 as the top amateur athlete in the United States and was a top 10 finalist in 1986, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. He received the NCAA Top Five Award in 1983 for his athletic leadership and academic success. He was inducted into the Indiana State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1998, the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame in 2003, and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008. He is also a distinguished member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum and a charter member of the International Wrestling Federation Hall of Fame (FILA).\n\nLARRY BIRD\n\nLarry Bird was a three-time All-American at Indiana State and led the 1978-79 Sycamores to the finals of the NCAA Championships during his senior campaign after which he received the USBWA College Player of the Year award along with the Naismith and Wooden Awards which are given to the top male college basketball player.\n\nHe won gold in four international competitions, most famously with the “Dream Team” during the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona which was the first time that the United States sent professional players to compete. He also earned gold as a member of Team USA at the 1992 Tournament of America’s, as a member of Team USA at the 1977 World University Games and at the 1978 World Invitational Tournament.\n\nBird was inducted into the Indiana State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1999 as an individual and as a member of the 1978-79 team. He had a stellar career with the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association with three NBA championships, three NBA Most Valuable Player awards, two NBA Finals MVP awards, and was named a member of the NBA’s 50th Anniversary All-Time Team.\n\nBENITA EDDS\n\nBenita Edds competed in archery at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. She was named an All-American in 1980 and 1981 while competing for Indiana State and won the 1984 National Women’s Indoor Championship. A three-time member of the All-Midwest Archery team, Edds was an alternate to the U.S. World team in 1981 and 1983 and competed in three United States Sports Festivals. She was inducted into the Indiana States Athletics Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nBRYAN LETURGEZ\n\nBryan Leturgez’s legacy at Indiana State was in track & field but it was in another sport, and a different season, that he made his mark in Olympic history. Leturgez competed in the decathlon, 400 meter hurdles and high jump for Indiana State, setting a then school record with a 7-foot-1.75” leap in high jump. He still has the third best time in the 400 meter hurdles in school history with a 50.86 accomplished in 1986. He competed in the 1986 NCAA Track & Field Championships and the 1988 Olympic Trials in the 400 meter hurdles.\n\nHis athletic career took another turn after the Olympic Trials. Fellow Terre Haute native Bruce Rosselli, who was putting together a bobsled team, asked Leturgez to try out in the fall of 1988 and he made the World Cup team. He competed in the bobsled for the next 10 years.\n\nHe earned three gold medals, one silver and one bronze during the 1992-93 World Cup season and was part of the four-man team that won the overall World Cup championship that season. Leturgez was on the U.S. Olympic team at the 1992 games in Albertville, France, the 1994 games in Lillehammer, Norway, and the 1998 games in Nagano, Japan. He was team captain for the 1992 Olympic Bobsled, posting his best Olympic finish of 11th in the four-man event.\n\nThe former Sycamore also set world records in the 1994 World Push Championships two and four-man events and won six World Push Championships overall.\n\nHe was inducted into the Indiana State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nKURT THOMAS\n\nA 13-time NCAA All-American, Kurt Thomas led the Sycamores to the 1979 NCAA team championship by being the NCAA All-Around, parallel bars, and horizontal bar individual champion. He also won the NCAA All-Around and parallel bars title in 1977.\n\nHe won a gold medal, two silvers and two bronze at the 1975 Pan American Games which earned him a place on the U.S. Olympic team and competed at the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal. Thomas became the first American male gymnast to win a gold medal in floor exercise at the World Championships which he accomplished in 1978.\n\nThomas won two gold medals and three silver medals in international competition during 1979 and became the first gymnast to receive the James E. Sullivan Award for the best amateur athlete in the United States. He was expected to be the top gymnast at the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow but the games were boycotted by the U.S. government.\n\nHe was inducted into the Indiana State Athletics Hall of Fame as both an individual and as a member of the 1977 national championship team on Jan. 22, 1999. Thomas was also inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2003 and was inducted into the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nERIN GILREATH\n\nErin Gilreath has made a tremendous impact upon the fortunes of the throws group at Indiana State in the year that she has been a Sycamore assistant coach. Gilreath won the hammer throw at the 2004 Olympic Trials in Sacramento with a then Olympic Trials record throw of 231-feet-0-inches. She went on to finish 20th at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.\n\nShe finished eighth at the 2004 World Athletics Final in Szombathely, Hungary, 10th at the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki, Finland, eighth at the 2006 World Athletics Final in Stuttgart, Germany, and sixth at the 2006 World Cup in Athens. She competed in her second Olympic Trials at Eugene in 2008 and finished 12th in the finals. Gilreath also finished 25th at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, Germany.\n\nOther individuals with ties to Indiana State have competed in international competition.\n\nSYCAMORE TRACK & FIELD\n\nSeveral former members of the Indiana State track & field team have competed in international competition including Steve Smith, Aubrey Herring, Christy Barrett (Sherman), Omegia Keeys, Kylie Hutson, and Erica Moore.\n\nMoore competed at the 2012 World Indoor Championships and took third place in the women’s 800 meters with a personal best time of 1:59.97. Hutson won the 2011 USA Outdoor title in the women’s pole vault and finished tied for seventh at the 2011 World Outdoor Championships. Keeys finished third in the 200 meters at the 1995 Pan American Games while Barrett competed in the shot put at the 1993 World Outdoor Championships.\n\nSmith was second in the men’s high jump at the 1995 Pan American Games after a seventh place finish at the 1995 World Indoor Championships. Herring won the 110 meter hurdles at the North America Central American Caribbean Championships in 2000. Swift finished third in the 110 meter hurdles at the 2012 North America Central America Caribbean Championships, placed third at the 2011 Central America Caribbean Championships, and ninth in the event at the 2011 World University Games.\n\n1949-1950 BASKETBALL TEAM\n\nThe Indiana State Teachers College 1949-50 men's basketball team, coached by John Longfellow, compiled a 27-8 overall record and defeated East Central Oklahoma by the score of 61-57 to capture the 1950 NAIB (National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball) National Championship. In doing so, they became Indiana State's first and only National Championship basketball team.\n\nAs a result of that championship victory, seven Sycamores were selected for the 1951 Pan American Games basketball team. However, due to the expiration of collegiate eligibility, only one member of the 1949-50 team competed in South America - Bob Gilbert. The remaining six Indiana State players named to the 1951 Pan American team were members of the 1950-51 Sycamore squad including Roger Akins, Dick Atha, Thomas Kern, Eugene Lambdin, Ed Longfellow, and Cliff Murray. John Longfellow served as co-head coach of the team that won gold with a 6-0 record.\n\nThe 1949-50 basketball team was inducted into the Indiana State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2000. John Longfellow and Dick Atha were inducted as individuals in 1984.\n\nSYCAMORE BASEBALL\n\nTwo members of the Sycamore baseball team competed internationally with Team USA including Boi Rodriguez and Greg Baker. Rodriquez was on Team USA for the 1986 Baseball World Cup where the team finished with a 7-4 record. Baker was on the 1979 Pan American team that finished fourth with a 5-3 record in San Juan.\n\nSeveral other former Indiana State baseball players have played for Team USA including Bill Hayes in 1976, Tom Gilles in 1984, Bob Zeihen in 1986, Casey Whitten in 1990 and 1992, Stoney Burke in 1992, and Dan Olson in 1994. Several others have competed for Team Canada including Doug McPhail (1976 and 1979), Pat Dumochelle (1979 and 1980), Perry Lychak (1979, 1980 and 1981), Tom Nelson (1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984), Mike Gardiner (1984), and Scott Mann (1982, 1983 and 1984). Gardiner, Mann and Nelson were on Team Canada’s 1984 Olympic team.\n\nSYCAMORE BASKETBALL\n\nFormer Indiana State basketball player Carl Nicks also has international experience as he played on the USA Select Team during their China Tour in 1979 where the team finished 3-2."
