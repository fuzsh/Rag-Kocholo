        "text": "Affiliates\n\nWASHINGTON CAPITALS\n\nThe South Carolina Stingrays are a proud affiliate of the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Capitals, who play at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., have been affiliated with the Stingrays from 2004-2012, and 2014-present. Washington claimed their first-ever Stanley Cup Championship in 2018. The Stingrays have advanced numerous former players to Washington, including goaltenders Braden Holtby and Philipp Grubauer, who both started their professional careers as members of the Stingrays. Each season, the Stingrays receive Washington Capitals prospects who skate in South Carolina. Additionally, the affiliation agreement sees many members of South Carolina's roster participate in Rookie Tournaments and Training Camps with the Capitals. South Carolina staff also works closely with members of the Capitals staff on player development. Led by Head Coach Peter Laviolette, Washington is one of the NHL's premier franchises, boasting a roster that includes superstar forward Alex Ovechkin.\n\nWebsite: capitals.nhl.com Facebook: Facebook.com/WashingtonCapitals Twitter: @Capitals\n\nFounded: 1974 Conference: Eastern Division: Metropolitan\n\nGeneral Manager: Brian MacLellan\n\nHead Coach: Spencer Carbery\n\nCaptain: Alex Ovechkin Stanley Cups: 1 Division Championships: 13\n\nHERSHEY BEARS\n\nSouth Carolina is a proud affiliate of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL). The Bears, one of the most storied franchises in minor league hockey, were founded in 1932, have won the Calder Cup 11-times, and continue to be one of the league's top teams each season. Playing out of the GIANT Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania, the Stingrays have a close relationship with the Bears, maintaining an affiliation from 2005-2012, and 2014-present. The Bears and Stingrays work closely together on player development, and many members of the Stingrays roster have AHL contracts with Hershey, allowing them to move up from the ECHL to the AHL during times of injuries, call-ups, or because of strong play. Many of Washington's top prospects skate in Hershey, who led the AHL in attendance every season from 2006-07 thru 2016-17, regularly averaging over 9,000 fans per game.\n\nWebsite: hersheybears.com Facebook: Facebook.com/TheHersheyBears Twitter: TheHersheyBears"
