She also competed in showing jumping at the 1991 Pan Ams in Havana, Cuba.\n\nGirard leads team\n\nChef de mission Christine Girard won Canada's first Olympic gold medal in weightlifting when her bronze in 2012 was upgraded to gold six years later. The two competitors ahead of her in the 63-kilogram class were eventually stripped of their medals for doping.\n\nThe 38-year-old Girard from Rouyn-Noranda, Que., competed in three Pan Am Games for Canada and won gold in 2011 in Guadalajara, Mexico.\n\n\"Since I was named chef de mission earlier this year, my excitement for these Games has only grown with every team announcement and name added to Team Canada's roster for Santiago 2023,\" Girard said.\n\n\"Each of these almost 500 athletes comes with their own story and objectives, united by sport and all the values that we hold dear, that we share and that define us.\"\n\nThe Parapan American Games for Paralympic athletes Nov. 17-26 are also in Santiago."
