If you like what you read and want it in your inbox, sign up here.\n\nBoston is a city that loves its sports stars. And we have more than a few to root for over the next few weeks at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nTwenty athletes from Massachusetts will represent four different nations across 14 sporting categories at the Summer Games. That’s without including three members of the Boston Celtics — Jrue Holiday, Jayson Tatum and Derrick White — who will be suiting up for Team USA, hot off last month’s NBA championship.\n\nWhile you watch your favorite events, here are some local names to look out for (and when and where to tune in to see them in action).\n\nGymnastics\n\nWho: Frederick Richard (Stoughton) and Stephen Nedoroscik (Worcester)\n\nWhen: Both Bay Staters are competing for Team USA in men’s qualifying events Saturday, July 27 starting at 5 a.m. on Peacock and NBC. Richard also has high hopes to earn a medal in the all-round final Wednesday, July 30 (11:30 a.m. on NBC). Here’s hoping he doesn’t receive any distracting texts mid-flip.\n\nSoccer\n\nWho: Miles Robinson (Arlington)\n\nWhen: Robinson will anchor Team USA’s defense, as one of the three senior members of the under-23 team. After a loss to France this past Wednesday, the team will play their second group stage game Saturday, July 27 against New Zealand (1 p.m. on USA and Peacock).

Meanwhile, Hedeman and Salmons will make their first appearance in the women’s eight heats on Monday, July 29 (6 a.m. on Peacock).\n\nWho: Henry Hollingsworth (Dover) and Dara Alizadeh (Brookline)\n\nWhen: Alizadeh, a Massachusetts native who now lives in the United Kingdom, rows in the men’s single sculls Saturday, July 27, representing his mother’s home nation of Bermuda (3 a.m. on Peacock). Hollingsworth will compete for Team USA in the men’s eight heats on Monday, July 29 (5:40 a.m. on Peacock).\n\nRugby\n\nWho: Madison Hughes (Lancaster)\n\nWhen: The Dartmouth College alum made his third Olympic appearance, playing fullback for Team USA's rugby sevens squad.

Check out the full schedule here.\n\nField hockey\n\nWho: Alexandra Hammel (Duxbury)\n\nWhen: A Boston University alum, Hammel is set to play in five women’s field hockey matches with Team USA from July 27 to Aug. 3. You can watch their first match against Argentina Saturday, July 27 (1:45 p.m. on Peacock and CNBC). Find their game schedule here.\n\nFencing\n\nWho: Eli Dershwitz (Boston)\n\nWhen: Dershwitz will make his third Olympic appearance for Team USA in the men’s individual and team sabre fencing events, the earliest of which begin on Saturday, July 27 (4 a.m. on Peacock).

(6:30 a.m. on Peacock and USA).\n\nP.S. — Last but not least, we’ve also got four Paralympians with Massachusetts ties competing this year: Emilie Eldracher of Andover, Alex Flynn of Danvers, Saige Harper of Easthampton and Leanne Smith of Salem. Eldracher, Flynn and Harper are all para rowing athletes. You can check them out during the PR3 mixed cox fours at the Paralympic Games from Aug. 30 – Sept. 1. Smith, a silver medalist para swimmer, will compete from Aug. 29 – Sept. 7."
