I competed in gymnastics in college and did not run.\n\nCareer Highlights\n\n2023 Grandma's Marathon, 3rd place; 2023 Bank of America Chicago Marathon (4th American) 11th place; 2022 California International Marathon, 8th place. College Gymnastics: 6-time Division III National Champion (Vault 2007 and 2008, Floor 2010, Team National Champions 2008, 2009, 2010)\n\nFamily\n\nI met my husband, Alex, during my senior year of high school. We attended college together (he ran track and I did gymnastics), and were married a few years after we graduated. When running became more serious for me in 2019, Alex started formally coaching me. Today, he is my full-time running and strength coach and coaches my Raev Endurance teammates as well. My mom ran throughout her pregnancy with me. I credit my athletic interests to running with her before I was born. My niece, Tessa, was born at 27 weeks weighing just 1 lb, 1 ounce. Today, she is a fierce and healthy 9-year-old. She comes to all of my races and is my inspiration to keep working hard when things get tough.\n\nGreatest Accomplishment\n\nI am most proud of becoming a physician assistant. I feel lucky to be trusted by patients and families to take care of hospitalized patients everyday.\n\nInteresting Story\n\nI grew up as a competitive gymnast and competed through college. After college, I sampled different sports and found a new love for competition in running. I started training seriously in 2019 and enlisted the help of my husband, Alex, to coach me. I used the pandemic as a time to increase my volume and have more-consistent interval sessions. I ran my first marathon in 2021 and set a goal to hit the OTQ standard in 2022. Since then, I have continued to move the needle and focus on getting as strong and fast as I can. Throughout my training, I have continued to work full-time as a physician assistant. Recently, I dropped down to part-time work to allow me to train for the Olympic Trials.\n\nFavorite Book\n\nThe Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman\n\nFavorite Movie\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox\n\nFavorite TV Show/Series\n\nThe Bear\n\nFavorite Song\n\nDance Yrself Clean by LCD Soundsystem\n\nFavorite Post-race Indulgence\n\nPost-race beer or mimosa\n\nFavorite Breakfast\n\nAvocado toast with egg, coffee, and an old-fashioned sour cream donut\n\nFavorite Motivational Quote\n\n\"Love yourself, for who and what you are; protect your dream and develop your talent to the fullest extent.\" - Joan Benoit Samuelson"
