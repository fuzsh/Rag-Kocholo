The Commission is chaired by Jeff Christie (Luge) and its First Officer is Helen Upperton (Bobsleigh). The Athletes’ Commission represents athletes on the COC Board of Directors.

The six newly elected members will bring fresh perspectives and expertise to the COC. Together we will ensure the strategies proposed by the COC fully reflect the betterment of sport and our athletes’ interests. We will get to work right away.”\n\n– Jeff Christie, Chair, COC Athletes’ Commission, Two-time Olympian, Luge\n\n“I’m honored to have been elected by my fellow Team Canada athletes to represent their interests in this important role. I look forward to working with Jeff and other members of the Commission to find new and innovative ways to strengthen the sport community for the benefit of athletes and the country as a whole.”"
