        "text": "We’ve wrapped up our live coverage for the day. Follow more Olympics news here.\n\nThe best photos of the Paris Olympics\n\nFor the first time since 2012, the US women’s soccer team will be in the gold medal match at the Olympics.\n\nThe Americans advanced to the final with a 1-0 win over Germany on Tuesday. Sophia Smith scored in the 95th minute.\n\nThe United States will play Brazil for the gold on Saturday. The Brazilians knocked off Spain, the reigning World Cup champion, by a 4-2 score.\n\nHere are the most compelling photos we’ve seen from the Olympics so far.\n\nUS set to face Brazil in gold medal women's soccer game\n\nFor the third time, the American and Brazilian women’s soccer teams will face off for gold as Brazil beat reigning World Cup champions Spain in their semifinal 4-2.\n\nThe US beat Brazil 20 years ago in 2004, and again in 2008. They faced off for the CONCACAF W Gold Cup just five months ago where the US won 1-0.\n\nNow they’re set for the third edition of this epic matchup, and Brazil will get the legendary Marta back from suspension.\n\nBrazil are in this position in large part due to Spain’s many mistakes, and heroics by their goalkeeper, Lorena.\n\nAfter going up 2-0 in the first half, Adriana tacked on a third goal in the 70th minute by capitalizing on another Spanish error. Adriana had kicked the ball into the crossbar, but Spain were unable to clear the ball and she headed in for a goal.\n\nSpain’s 85th minute goal to break the clean sheet went in the scorebook as an own goal, but Salma Paralluelo deserves the credit. Unfortunately for her, Kerolin reestablished Brazil’s three-goal lead on a breakaway minutes later. Paralluelo added another goal in the 12th minute of stoppage time, and nearly completed a hat trick but it would not be enough to make up for early blunders.\n\nBrazil’s win was official following a whopping 15 minutes of stoppage time thanks to numerous injuries and substitutions. Spain will play Germany for bronze on Friday at 9 a.m. ET, and Brazil will play the US for gold on Saturday at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nUSA steamrolls Brazil, 122-87, in men's basketball quarterfinals\n\nAnd it’s all over here, though in reality, it was all over quite a while ago.\n\nTeam USA just trounced Brazil, 122-87, as they move toward a semifinal matchup with Serbia. It’s a rematch of the two teams’ opening game of the Olympics, which Team USA won 110-84.\n\nLed by Devin Booker’s 18 points, Anthony Edwards’ 17 and Joel Embiid’s answer to critics online and boo-birds in the crowd, it was just more proof that it is impossible to game plan for this team of stars.\n\nSure, LeBron James and Kevin Durant can have off nights by their standards, but there’s always another NBA All-Star who’s ready to fill in that gap.\n\nJames spent much of the third and fourth quarters in the locker room after taking an inadvertent elbow to the face from a Brazilian player.\n\nHe went down to one knee quickly and was eventually guided to the bench by a trainer. He received treatment on the bench before going to the locker room area. He would return and appeared to be OK as the game wound down.\n\nThings are looking good for this team as it looks for its fifth Olympic gold medal in a row.\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif advances to women's 66kg gold medal match\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif defeated Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand by unanimous decision in the women’s 66kg welterweight semifinal to advance to Friday’s gold medal match where she will face off with China’s Yang Liu.\n\nSpectators at Roland-Garros Stadium cheered Khelif as she entered the ring. Some in the crowd booed Suwannapheng as she made her entrance.\n\nThe broadcast showed Algerian fans waving the country’s flag prior to the bout.\n\nDuring the fight, the crowd was enthusiastically cheering for the Algerian, shouting Khelif’s name, “Imane! Imane! Imane!”\n\nThe fifth seed in the weight class was in control for all three rounds.\n\nAfter being announced the winner, Khelif waited for Suwannapheng to acknowledge the crowd before she held the ropes for the Thai boxer to exit the ring.\n\nThe Algerian then gleefully smiled and danced to celebrate the victory.\n\nShe began taking selfies with fans in attendance after speaking to the international press before departing to the crowd chanting her name.\n\nKhelif is sure to be a big crowd favorite on Friday.\n\nCNN’s Jimmy Hutcheon and Matthew Brealey contributed to this report.\n\nLeBron James returns to the bench from the locker room area and the crowd cheers – for Léon Marchand\n\nLeBron James is back on the bench and seems to be fine.\n\nAs he walks back to his seat, the crowd begins to chant. It sort of sounds like LeBron and the camera pans to James, who waves and gets a big cheer from the Bercy Arena.\n\nBut he wasn’t who the crowd wanted. They were chanting, “Lé-on! Lé-on!” for their new legend, swimmer Léon Marchand, who is in the crowd here.\n\nHe waves to the crowd and gets a standing ovation from the arena, who begin to sing his name in adoration.\n\nThe only star bigger than the ones on the court here in Paris is the new French swimming hero.\n\nUS dominating Brazil now with four minutes left in the final quarter\n\nWell, it’s a 32-point gap now, 112-80 in favor of the US with four minutes to go.\n\nThis American team just truly cannot be stopped once it gets going. Brazil made its run in the first half and ever since that four-minute run in the second quarter, Team USA has just been unstoppable.\n\nLeBron James hasn’t returned to the bench after going to the back with what appeared to be an injury to his face after taking an inadvertent elbow from a Brazilian player earlier.\n\nCNN has reached out to USA Basketball for any word on his condition.\n\nOlympic track coach has Paris Games accreditation revoked ahead of high-profile men's 200m race\n\nRana Reider, the personal coach for track stars Andre De Grasse and Lamont Marcell Jacobs, both of whom are competing at Paris 2024, had his Olympic credentials revoked by the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) on Monday.\n\nThe COC said the decision to deny the coach’s access to the Games was based on “new information about the appropriateness of Mr. Reider remaining accredited by Team Canada.”\n\nReider’s attorney, Ryan Stevens, said in a statement Monday that the coach was “unjustly stripped of his Olympic coaching credential, based on years-old claims in a lawsuit by former athletes seeking financial gain.”\n\nBoth De Grasse, a three-time Olympian for Canada, and Jacobs, who represents Italy, list Reider as their personal coach on their official Olympics bio pages.\n\nAn American coach, Reider had previously been under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct by the US Center for SafeSport.\n\nThe COC said Monday the committee had issued accreditation to Reider “based on the understanding that his probation with the US Center for Safe Sport ended in May this year, that he had no other suspensions or sanctions, and otherwise met our eligibility requirements.”\n\nStevens reiterated what the COC said about Reider not having any sanction against him by the US Center for SafeSport. Stevens also said there is no sanction against the coach by USA Track & Field or Athletics Canada.\n\nCNN has reached out to the US Center for SafeSport for comment.\n\nReider, is listed as a defendant in three lawsuits in Broward County, Florida, accusing the coach of “sexual and emotional abuses.”\n\nDe Grasse is set to race in a 200m semifinal on Wednesday with the final slated for Thursday. He won gold in this event at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. De Grasse failed to qualify for the 100m final in Paris.\n\nJacobs placed fifth in the men’s 100m event in Paris and is set to race again in the men’s 4x100m relay.\n\nTeam Italy had no comment regarding the Reider situation.\n\nCNN’s Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.\n\nUS women's soccer team has the upper hand but goes into halftime 0-0 against Germany\n\nThe US Women’s National Team has enjoyed the better of the first half against Germany, but has so far been unable to find a breakthrough.\n\nEmma Hayes’ side perhaps should have taken the lead through Rose Lavelle inside the opening five minutes, but she hit her effort straight at Ann-Katrin Berger when she was unmarked inside the area.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t all USA in the first half and goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher had to get down sharply to keep out Jule Brand’s low effort.\n\nThe comeback story of US swimming star Simone Manuel\n\nAt Rio 2016, American swimming star Simone Manuel became the first Black woman swimmer to earn an individual gold at the Olympics, winning the 100 meter freestyle.\n\nBut things took an unexpected turn just when she was reaching her prime. Manuel was diagnosed with overtraining syndrome in 2021; the swimmer was unable to recuperate after training, her body was overcome with constant nausea and fatigue.\n\nShe thought her career might be over after a disappointing Tokyo Olympics where she only won a team bronze in the 4x100m freestyle relay. She didn’t know if she could go on.\n\n“I just needed to breath,” Manuel told CNN Sport. She walked away from the sport she loves for five months to find clarity – and she found it.\n\nManuel learned to live with her condition and found the inner strength to persevere. She worked her way back to the Olympic stage and is now leaving Paris with two silver relay medals brining her career total to seven.\n\nHer impressive comeback story comes with her strong message of the importance of mental health and caring for oneself.\n\nShe also tells CNN about her concern for the lack of understanding – by casual fans and the media – of how stressful the Olympic stage is for athletes. Manuel quoted a post she made on X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2021 following Caeleb Dressel not qualifying for a swimming final and being emotionally overcome after missing out on qualifying for a final.\n\n“I’ll forever stand by this. Interviews/recordings/ photography in these moments really aren’t necessary,” Manuel posted. “I can attest to the fact that the moment is already traumatic and the capture of it is even more grueling. I hope we can give athletes more grace because they’re human first!”\n\nFrance keeps its double-digit lead over Canada in men's basketball quarterfinal\n\nThe initial frenzy of energy has cooled somewhat and the French team is still on top of Canada by double-digits as we pass the halfway point of the second quarter.\n\nThe two French stars who were left out of the starting lineup – Evan Fournier and Rudy Gobert – have both made their entrance into this game as the action settles in from the frantic early pace.\n\nThe Canadians will hope to emulate Germany, which earlier withstood an early charge by the underdog Greeks and pulled out an easy victory.\n\nBut this French crowd seems unlikely to drop its noise levels if this game gets close.\n\nFrance up 23-10 over Canada after the first quarter in men's basketball quarterfinal\n\nWell, the French couldn’t have scripted that better.\n\nA raucous crowd here has cheered Les Bleus to a double-digit lead here after one quarter of play.\n\nFrance is led by Isaïa Cordinier’s 10 points and Guerschon Yabusele’s seven.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamal Murray and Canada have yet to really get going. The Canadians are 3-for-15 from the field and already have seven turnovers after just 10 minutes of play.\n\nThe French are shooting 45% from the field and that defensive prowess has already paid dividends.\n\n14-year-old Arisa Trew wins skateboarding gold in women's park final\n\nAustralia’s Arisa Trew clinched the gold medal after a brilliant final in the women’s park event.\n\nThe 14-year-old needed a big run in the final round and scored a huge 93.18 points to move to the top of the podium.\n\nJapan’s Cocona Hiraki finished with the silver medal, while Team GB’s Sky Brown claimed the bronze. Brown defied the odds by coming third after recovering from a dislocated shoulder just days before competition started in Paris.\n\nTrew becomes the youngest medalist at this year’s Games, according to Olympics.com, and looked ecstatic as she was congratulated by her fellow competitors.\n\nShe is also Australia’s youngest ever Olympic champion.\n\nFrance takes a gamble leaving veterans out of starting line-up, jumps out to 16-5 lead\n\nBercy Arena is shaking from the noise of the French fans here as France jumps out to a double-digit lead in the early going.\n\nThe entire arena is bouncing and singing, an incredible sight as the French fans are buoyed by the hot start.\n\nFrance’s coach Vincent Collet is taking a big gamble with his starting five, leaving NBA stars Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier out of the starting line-up.\n\nSo far, so good on that front.\n\nFrance and Canada about to tip off in men's basketball quarterfinal action\n\nThe tricolore is flying around the Bercy Arena, the drum-led section of red-white-and-blue supporters are cheering and “Allez Les Bleus!” is being sung at top volume.\n\nIt’s almost time for France and Canada to get underway here for the day’s next quarterfinal match-up in the men’s basketball tournament.\n\nThe French team will have the heavy backing of the crowd here and it’s going to need all the help it can get to overcome Canada, which is laden with NBA stars. But the French defense, led by Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert, has been their calling card so far and will be tight against the North Americans.\n\nTip-off is at the top of the hour.\n\nWomen's and men's dinghy medal race abandoned for the day\n\nThe women’s dinghy medal race was meant to start at 2:43 p.m. local time (8:43 a.m. ET) but it has now been abandoned for the day due to a “lack of wind.”\n\nThe men’s race was scheduled to begin at 3:43 p.m. local (9:43 a.m. ET) after the conclusion of the women’s race, but has also been abandoned.\n\nAt 11, Zheng Haohao is the youngest athlete competing at the Paris Olympics\n\nFor those worried about getting older, look away now.\n\nOn Tuesday, the youngest athlete of these Games – China’s 11-year-old Zheng Haohao – was competing at the women’s park skateboarding event in Place de La Concorde.\n\nShe was born in August 2012, not long after Michael Phelps had become the most decorated Olympian of all time in London.\n\nZheng, who is also China’s youngest-ever Olympian, placed 18th in the women’s park prelims, failing to earn a spot in the finals.\n\nShe later said that it had been a challenge to share a training venue alongside bigger and older competitors, explaining:\n\nThe oldest competitor at the Games? That title goes to Spain’s 65-year-old equestrian rider Juan Antonio Jiminez Cobo, who made his Olympic debut at Sydney 2000.\n\nUS women's soccer team set for semifinal clash with Germany today\n\nIf one team is used to dealing with pressure, it’s the US women’s soccer team.\n\nSo much is always expected from those who wear the jersey and all eyes will be on the side’s semifinal against Germany today.\n\nThe crunch match will start at 12 p.m. ET (6 p.m. local) in Lyon, with Emma Hayes’ team hoping to continue its unbeaten run in this year’s competition.\n\nThe US women have won four gold medals in the Olympic Games — including a three-peat from 2004 to 2012 — but have gone without winning the competition since London 12 years ago, losing in the quarterfinals to Sweden in 2016 and winning the bronze medal in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nIn truth, the team is still in a transition period but have shown potential in Paris that points toward a bright future.\n\nImportantly, it has already beaten Germany in this year’s tournament, winning 4-1 in its second Group B match. The players will also be riding a high after winning a dramatic quarterfinal against Japan, courtesy of a late goal from Trinity Rodman.\n\nThe winner of the semifinal will face either Brazil or Spain in the gold medal match on August 10.\n\nHow the teams will line up today:\n\nUSWNT: Alyssa Naeher, Emily Fox, Naomi Girma, Trinity Rodman, Crystal Dunn, Mallory Swanson, Lindsey Horan, Sophia Smith, Tierna Davidson, Rose Lavelle, Sam Coffey.\n\nGermany: Ann-Katrin Berger, Kathrin Hendrich, Marina Hegering, Janina Minge, Sydney Lohmann, Sjoeke Nuesken, Giulia Gwinn, Jule Brand, Klara Bühl, Felicitas Rauch, Nicole Anyomi.\n\nThe post was updated with the team lineups.\n\nSerbia climbs back from a 24-point deficit to beat Australia in men's basketball quarterfinal\n\nIt was truly a tale of two halves here in the second quarterfinal of the men’s basketball tournament.\n\nAustralia and Serbia, with rosters dotted with NBA talent, played the most dramatic game of this tournament so far on Tuesday, the Serbs eventually coming out on top 95-90 in overtime.\n\nThe game started off with Australia on an absolute tear, led by the hot hand of Miami Heat player Patty Mills. His 20 points in the first half helped pace the Aussies to a huge lead as Nikola Jokić and company could not buy a bucket for huge stretches of the first half.\n\nBut the Serbs turned the momentum somewhat as the first half came to a close and then started off the third quarter on fire. A massive third quarter run brought them even and then ahead as the Bercy Arena in Paris exploded with noise.\n\nThe Aussies wouldn’t wilt in the face of that run and the fourth quarter was a back-and-forth affairs that stayed tight throughout. Jokić and Bogdan Bogdanović took over the offense for the Serbs while Josh Giddey carried to load for his team, ending with 25 points. The Serbs looked to have done enough, but were only able to get their lead to 2 points with seconds to play.\n\nMills, who was largely quiet in the second half, came up huge with a prayer of a shot that fell with 1.4 seconds to play, sending the game into overtime.\n\nThe extra 5 minutes was a heavyweight fight of punches and counterpunches that would eventually be settled by Jokić hitting one of his trademark fallaway jumpers in the low post over an out-stretched defenders hand. A steal on the ensuing inbounds pass and two more free throws from Bogdanović sealed the win for the Serbs.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had some huge moments for the Boomers at these Games and was asked about his game-tying shot.\n\nSerbia will play the winner of USA-Brazil later on tonight.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Australia’s Patty Mills.\n\nSerbia's Filip Petrusev steals the Aussie inbounds pass and completes the massive comeback\n\nAnd … exhale.\n\nSerbia’s Filip Petrusev steals the Australian inbounds pass with 25 seconds left and the Serbs run down the clock before an Aussie foul stops it.\n\nBogdan Bogdanovic drains 2 free throws and it’s the final score, 95-90 Serbia over Australia.\n\nThe Serbs go through to play the winner of USA-Brazil later on tonight.\n\nWhat a game here in the second quarterfinal of the day. France-Canada is up next in about 85 minutes.\n\nNikola Jokić puts Serbia up 3 with 25 seconds to play in overtime\n\nA punch-counterpunch overtime is down to its final seconds.\n\nAustralia took the lead briefly, but now Serbia has it back, 93-90.\n\nNikola Jokić just put on an absolute clinic in the low post, backing down his defender and hitting a fadeaway turnaround jumper to put his team up by 3 heading into the final stretch.\n\nIt’ll be up to the Aussies to pull out some last-second heroics one more time.\n\nAustralia's Patty Mills ties it with 1.4 seconds to go and we're headed to overtime\n\nPatty Mills chucks up a prayer and it falls with 1.4 seconds to play!\n\nIt’s 82-82 here at the buzzer after a last-ditch Serb shot misses everything.\n\nA moment for everyone to catch their breath as this game goes to overtime.\n\nSerbia 81, Australia 80 with 32 seconds to play\n\nSerbia is up by one point with less than a minute to play and they have the ball.\n\nNeither team has made their last two shots as things tighten up with the game on the line.\n\nJosh Giddey has been the Aussies’ top option in crunch time, but his foul on Jokić puts him just one more infraction from being kicked out of this game.\n\nGame starting back up now, here we go.\n\n17-year-old Quan Hongchan wins another diving gold for China\n\nShe’s just 17, but Quan Hongchan has just retained her Olympic title in the women’s 10m platform diving final.\n\nThe Chinese athlete scored a 90-point perfect dive on a forward 3½ somersaults pike on her way to yet another gold medal, beating compatriot Chen Yuxi courtesy of a better final attempt.\n\nQuan is now a three-time gold medalist, but she had more pressing matters on her mind after her victory.\n\n“Hungry,” she responded when asked about how she felt after the event. “Let’s get something to eat. I ate this morning at 8 a.m., one energy bar, went back to sleep, woke up at 11 a.m., had some milk tea. That’s all I’ve eaten.”\n\nShe won her first gold in the same event three years ago in Tokyo, aged only 14.\n\nNorth Korea’s Kim Mi-rae won bronze but couldn’t get close to the Chinese pair who finished in the exact same positions in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nIt also marks yet another diving success for China in Paris, as the country bids to win a clean sweep of diving gold medals at this year’s Olympics.\n\nGold: Quan Hongchan – 425.60\n\nSilver: Chen Yuxi – 420.70\n\nBronze: Kim Mi-rae – 372.10\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from China’s Quan Hongchan.\n\nAustralia buries a 3 to tie up Serbia with 3 minutes to go in men's basketball quarterfinal game\n\nIncredible ball movement from the Australians around the three-point line, three passes from one end to the other, ends up in Josh Giddey’s hands and he buries the triple to bring the Aussies level.\n\nIt’s 78-78 with just a few minutes to play in Paris, a dramatic ending in store.\n\nIt's 67-65 Serbia over Australia after three quarters in the men's basketball quarterfinals\n\nAll to play for in the fourth quarter.\n\nA massive run by the Serbs has put them over the Aussies heading into the final quarter here of this quarterfinal match up.\n\n“Freed From Desire” is once again blasting from the arena loudspeakers and the hyped-up crowd here is dancing and singing along with this staple of the Games here in Paris.\n\nA relatively quiet third quarter from Patty Mills after that blistering first half. Nikola Jokić now has 17 points and eight rebounds.\n\nSerbia takes the lead, overcoming 22-point first half deficit to lead Australia in the third quarter\n\nAnd Serbia is now all the way back.\n\nIt’s 61-60 Serbia over Australia with just a few minutes left in the third quarter as the Australians suddenly can’t make a shot and are having trouble running their offense.\n\nIt’s win-or-go-home basketball, setting up for a dramatic final quarter here.\n\nSerbia is almost all the way back as it slashes Australia's lead to 1 point\n\nThe Serbs here in Paris are going nuts as a massive Serbian 12-2 run over the last two minutes has made this a 1-point contest.\n\nAustralia was leading 60-56, but had to call a timeout to try and end the Serbs’ run. But on the ensuing possession, they turned the ball over and Serbia drained a 3 to close the gap to just a point.\n\nThe Serbs trailed by 22 during the first half as the red-hot Aussies looked ready to run them out of the Bercy Arena. All the momentum with Serbia now.\n\nChina's Quan Hongchan opens diving final with perfect score\n\nIt was an amazing start for China’s Quan Hongchan in the women’s 10m platform final.\n\nThe judges gave the 17-year-old a perfect 10 across the board as she recorded 90 points for her flawless first dive.\n\nThe defending Olympic champion’s second attempt was strong again, but she slightly missed the entry in her third dive and is now in a close battle for gold with compatriot Chen Yuxi.\n\nSerbia trying to claw its way back into this game, cuts deficit to 12 at halftime\n\nThe Serbs are not going away as their shooting finally started to pick up in the back half of the second quarter.\n\nAt halftime, it’s Australia 54, Serbia 42.\n\nThe atmosphere here is like an NCAA tournament game. Both Serbs and Aussies are out in full force and massive cheers greet every bucket. As with nearly every event at these Games, the fans are loud and into every bit of the action.\n\nThe Serbs’ run was answered at points by the Aussies, who finish the half shooting a lights-out 62%. If you’re a Serbia fan, you have to hope that kind of effort won’t keep up as we go into the second half.\n\nRed-hot Aussies open up 20-point lead on Serbia in men's quarterfinal basketball matchup\n\nThe Australians are just running all over the Serbs at the moment.\n\nPatty Mills now has 18 points and the disjointed Serb offense is not making any sort of impact with Nikola Jokić getting a breather on the bench. A 6-0 run to open the second quarter requires the Serbs to take a timeout to try and blunt the Boomers’ momentum.\n\nThere’s still a lot of time left, and Germany came back from a 12-point deficit in the first game to take the quarterfinal from Greece. But this one is threatening to get out of hand early.\n\nAustralia is shooting an absolutely blistering 79% from the field, including 4-for-6 from beyond the arc. Serbia, meanwhile, is having trouble buying a bucket and is shooting 36%.\n\nJokić is still stuck on the six points that he had to end the first quarter as we approach the halfway point of the second.\n\nJosh Giddey and Patty Mills star early for Australia as the Boomers open up a lead on Serbia\n\nJosh Giddey of Australia is out and running in this quarterfinal men’s basketball match-up.\n\nAustralia has a 31-17 lead over Serbia as we approach the end of the first quarter and the Chicago Bulls guard is starting to put criticisms of his performance so far in France to rest. His hot start helped pace the Boomers to an early lead.\n\nNikola Jokić is so far mostly quiet for the Europeans, who haven’t really gotten into any kind of offensive flow yet. This team will likely go as far as Jokić can carry them, so he needs to get going – he has six points so far.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia’s Patty Mills just knocked down multiple threes as the first quarter comes to a close and the Serbians are reeling. Mills has 12 points in just 10 minutes of play.\n\nAustralia and Serbia get ready to tip off in quarterfinal men's basketball action\n\nIt’s a full house here at the Bercy Arena and what was once a gymnastics gym is now a basketball arena.\n\nAustralia and Serbia, led by three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokić, are about to tip off here and the winner of this game gets either the USA or Brazil in the semifinals later on this week.\n\nTruly, you get a sense of how international basketball has become here in Paris. Jerseys from around the league and around the world have been spotted in the walk to the stadium and in the arena itself.\n\nNBA players dot both rosters in this game and, if the amount of Serbian fans in here is any indication, it’s about to be pretty loud.\n\nMen's speed climbing heats conclude with a world record and a lot of noise from the crowd\n\nThe men’s speed climbing heats have concluded at Le Bourget and eight athletes will progress to Thursday’s final.\n\nUSA’s Sam Watson stole the show with a time of 4.75 seconds to break his own world record, while the home crowd also had a reason to cheer: France’s Bassa Mawem, with the final act of the session, gained a spot in the final by just 0.01 seconds.\n\nThe 39-year-old Mawem finished marginally ahead of Ukraine’s Yaroslav Tkach in their heat, sparking loud chants of “Bassa! Bassa!” from the French fans.\n\nThese are the eight athletes to reach the final and their times:\n\nSam Watson (USA) - 4.75 seconds\n\nVeddriq Leonardo (Indonesia) - 4.79\n\nAmir Maimuratov (Kazhakstan) - 4.89\n\nMatteo Zurloni (Italy) - 4.94\n\nWu Peng (China) - 5.00\n\nBassa Mawem (France) - 5.16\n\nJulian David (New Zealand) - 5.20\n\nReza Alipour (Iran) - 5.06 (lucky loser)\n\nClimber Janja Garnbret scores near-perfect score in bouldering semifinal\n\nMuch was expected of Janja Garnbret before action began in Paris and the Slovenian certainly hasn’t disappointed so far.\n\nThe climber earned a near-perfect score during the bouldering semifinals on Tuesday, totalling 99.6 out of a possible 100.\n\n“It should be 100,” she said afterwards. “The first two problems went smoothly. Third one, it was basically just a little slip at the beginning, but otherwise no problems.\n\n“And then the fourth one, it was causing me some problems for some reason, and I still don’t know why.\n\n“I have to ask my coach what I did wrong because I just didn’t feel too comfortable, but I did it my way in the end, which was also great.”\n\nGarnbret must now keep her concentration for the lead semifinals on Thursday. The scores from both lead and bouldering will be combined to determine who makes the final.\n\nSport climbing at Paris has been a hit yet again, after making its debut at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nRead more about Garnbret’s preparation for this year’s Olympics here.\n\nWhat is the track and field repechage system introduced for the first time at Paris Olympics?\n\nTeam USA’s Freddie Crittenden successfully gambled that he would qualify for 110m hurdles semifinals in a ‘second chance’ race, but why was he allowed to do this?\n\nAthletes as well as viewers are getting accustomed to a new system World Athletics has introduced for the first time at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe so called repechage round allows athletes “who do not qualify by place in round one heats” to essentially have a second chance to qualify for the semis.\n\nPreviously, automatic qualifiers and the next fastest overall times would make it through round one. Now, everyone has the opportunity to come back and compete again in the repechage round.\n\nOnly athletes who made a false start or did not finish are excluded from the repechage round.\n\n“The new format means that every athlete competing in the events with a repechage round will have at least two races at the Olympic Games,” World Athletics said.\n\nThe new system was introduced to all individual track events from 200 meters to 1500 meters, including all hurdles event.\n\nThe new track and field system for this Olympics resembles the repechage round in rowing events where non-automatic qualifiers also get a second chance to qualify to the semifinals. Other sports like judo and wrestling feature repechage rounds as well.\n\nCNN’s Sam Joseph contributed to this post.\n\nSam Watson sets speed climbing world record in men's heats\n\nAmerican Sam Watson already set a short-lived Olympic record in the men’s climbing at Le Bourget. Now, he’s beaten his own world record.\n\nThe 18-year-old scaled the 15-meter wall in 4.75 seconds, taking 0.04 seconds off the time he set at a World Cup event in China in April.\n\nThat sees Watson top the standings in the heats and qualify for the speed climbing final on Thursday. Seven other athletes will join him when the heats conclude shortly.\n\nRecords tumbling at the men's speed climbing\n\nThe men’s speed climbing heats are not 15 minutes old but already we’ve seen the Olympic record broken several times.\n\nPerhaps that’s not a huge surprise given this is only the second time that speed climbing has appeared at the Olympics after its debut in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nIndonesia’s Veddriq Leonardo is the latest to set a new best at the Games, flying up the wall in a world-record-tying time of 4.79 seconds.\n\nPrior to that, Kazakhstan’s Amir Maimuratov and USA’s Sam Watson, who also has the world record in this event, were among those setting Olympic records.\n\nIn Tokyo, athletes competed in three climbing disciplines – speed, lead, and bouldering – for one set of medals.\n\nBut in Paris, the speed event, considered more of a specialized form of climbing, has been made into a separate category. Quite simply, it requires athletes to get to the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible while competing in a head-to-head format.\n\nNeeraj Chopra, who has gained unlikely stardom in India, closes in on another javelin success\n\nIndia’s Neeraj Chopra has breezed through to the men’s javelin final after an impressive qualification round.\n\nThe 26-year-old qualified in first place with a season-best throw of 89.34m.\n\n“It was a good throw. Maybe the biggest ever in qualifying for me. All the throwers look in good shape. The final will be a really good competition for sure,” he said after qualifying.\n\nChopra will be looking to add yet another medal to his growing list of achievements in Paris, as he continues to cement himself as one of the brightest talents in track and field.\n\nAfter winning Olympic gold in Tokyo three years ago – the first Asian athlete to do so in the javelin – Chopra was crowned world champion in Budapest last year, becoming the first Indian to win a world title in a track and field event of any kind.\n\nIt perhaps comes as no surprise, given his historic career to date, that the understated athlete has proven a hit back in India.\n\nChopra spoke to CNN Sport before action got underway in Paris.

It’s hot too! The sun is beating down.\n\nAfter the first of four heats, Japan’s Cocona Hiraki, the reigning Olympic silver medalist, is in first with a score of 88.07.\n\nAmerican Bryce Wettstein is in second, Japan’s Hinano Kusaki in third.\n\nThe defending gold medalist, and current #1 in the Olympic rankings, Sakura Yosozumi is fourth.\n\nSummer McIntosh, the history-making Canadian experiencing a summer like no other\n\nThis has been no ordinary summer; this has been the season of Canadian swimming sensation Summer McIntosh.\n\nParis was primed for the 17-year-old to make the step up from prodigy to champion – and she’s lived up to the hype and then some.\n\nThe Toronto-born swimmer ended her Parisian tour de force with four individual medals from a single Games – three golds and a silver – joining swimming great Michelle Smith, Katinka Hosszú and Kristin Otto as the only other women to do so at a single Summer Games.\n\nRead more about Summer McIntosh’s life and career here.\n\nGermany’s Christian Kukuk wins first gold of Day 11 in show jumping\n\nIt’s yet another equestrian gold medal for Germany.\n\nChristian Kukuk and his horse Checker 47 won the individual jumping event to claim the nation’s fourth gold in this sport in Paris.\n\nFaultless runs from Kukuk, Switzerland’s Steve Guerdat and Maikel van der Vleuten of the Netherlands meant that a jump-off was required to separate the three competitors.\n\nKukuk was the only one to produce a clean run once again in the jump-off, finishing with a time of 38.34 seconds.\n\nKukuk called it “the toughest competition I’ve ever had in my career.”\n\n“I had a good feeling but this day, you need the luck on your side a little bit,” he added. “But actually it didn’t feel like I needed a lot of luck today.”\n\nGuerdat took Switzerland’s seventh medal of the Games with silver while van der Vleuten claimed bronze.\n\nGermans up 11 halfway through the fourth quarter as the Greeks can't get it together\n\nThe Greek half-court offense is in shambles and the Germans are starting to open up a big lead.\n\nGreece can’t do anything unless Giannis Antetokounmpo does it, and he’s now facing at least two defenders every time down the court. That stifling defense and terrible shooting from the Greeks have allowed the Germans to take their first double-digit lead of this contest.\n\nIt feels like Greece’s upset chances are just slowly fading away now.\n\nSecond gentleman to lead US presidential delegation for the close of Paris Olympics\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff will lead the presidential delegation to the closing ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics and will meet with Team USA athletes, according to a statement from his communication director.\n\nWhile Emhoff is in France, he will engage government officials and senior leaders at UNESCO, according to the statement.\n\nEmhoff will also convene a roundtable to promote Holocaust education and combat antisemitism.\n\nThe second gentleman will also deliver remarks at the annual commemoration for the victims of the 1982 Rue des Rosiers attack. Six people were killed and 22 others were injured following an the 1982 attack on a Jewish restaurant in Paris.\n\nGermany up 7 over Greece heading into the fourth quarter of men's basketball quarterfinal\n\nThe world champions are surging into the final quarter here.\n\nGermany’s Isaac Bonga nailed a three just before the end of the third quarter to open up the Germans’ largest lead of the game, 59-52.\n\nGreece has suddenly gone cold in the face of this run by the Germans, who looked shaken early in this game after the Greeks stormed out of the gate.\n\nTen minutes to go in this first elimination game in Paris.\n\nUnexpected spectator drops in on the surfing semi-final in Tahiti\n\nWhale, we didn’t see that coming…\n\nWhile most spectators usually watch the surfing from the shore, one decided they wanted a closer look at the action of the women’s semi-final.\n\nBrazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb and Costa Rica’s Brisa Hennessy were treated to a spectacle during their women’s surfing semi-final in Tahiti when a nearby humpback whale, which migrates through Tahiti from July to November, breached behind them.\n\nGreece and Germany locked in a tie at halftime of the first men's quarterfinal basketball game\n\nIt’s set for a dramatic second half at the Bercy Arena as Greece, the lowest seed from pool men’s basketball play, is tied up with the world champion Germans at halftime.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo lead the Greeks with 8 points and Fritz Wagner leads the Germans with 6.\n\nIt’s all to play for in the second half as the Germans try to fend off what would be a high-profile upset in the first knockout game.\n\nTeam USA medalist discovers free healthcare in Olympic Village and becomes advocate for it back home\n\nThe Olympic Village is mystical place for us non-Olympians. But apparently, there are some perks that even the athletes aren’t aware of.\n\nTake Team USA’s rugby sevens bronze medalist Ariana Ramsey, for example.\n\nWhen the 24-year-old arrived in Paris, she apparently knew of the free food on offer in the Village. What she wasn’t aware of, though, was that free healthcare was available to all athletes.\n\nIn a video posted on her TikTok account, Ramsey said that she had a pap smear performed. That wasn’t all, as she said she had booked a dentist appointment and an eye exam.\n\n“Like, what?!” an incredulous Ramsey said.\n\nRamsey said her videos displaying her incredulity at the free healthcare were picked up by media in France and that she has received positive feedback from workers.\n\n“So when I was going into my eye doctors appointment – my free eye doctor’s appointment in the Olympic Village – my eye doctor recognized me. She was like: ‘Your video’s going viral.’\n\n“And then when I left, there were all these workers coming up to me and being like: ‘Thank you for your video.’ … France, you did do your big ones with free healthcare, or every other country minus America, did their big one with free healthcare.”\n\nThe experience seems to have changed Ramsey’s approach to healthcare.\n\nShe said in another video where she appeared to be at the dentist’s office: “This is going to be my new fight for action. Free healthcare in America. Period.”\n\nShe added: “Anyways, America needs to do better with their healthcare system. There’s no reason why me, an American girl, should be so amazed by free healthcare.”\n\nAlgerian runner misses out on men’s 100m semifinal by 0.001s while winner advances by just 0.002s\n\nIf you thought the men’s 100m final was a close finish, then this men’s 110m hurdles race takes the biscuit.\n\nNoah Lyles won gold on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second, but in Tuesday’s second repechage heat at the Stade de France, the margin was even tighter.\n\nThe trio of Rafael Pereira of Brazil, France’s Raphael Mohamed and Algeria’s Amine Bouanani finished almost perfectly in sync, needing a photo finish to determine a winner.\n\nPereira was the eventual winner with a time of 13.54 seconds. Remarkably, he finished 0.002 seconds ahead of the second-placed Raphael Mohamed, who also booked his spot in the semifinals.\n\nEven more remarkably, it was heartbreak for Bouanani as he missed out a spot in the semifinals by one thousandth of a second.\n\nIt was a chaotic race even before the start, with multiple false starts – Kazakhstan’s David Yefremov was disqualified as a result – and the starters gun appearing to break too.\n\nIt wasn’t the only extremely tight 110m hurdles repechage heat, with the third also coming down to a photo finish. This time, France’s Wilhem Belocian advanced to the semifinals ahead of Japan’s Shunya Takayama by just five-thousandths of a second.\n\n\"Dad is the only one without a medal,\" after Australian sisters dominate kayak and canoe events\n\nAustralian sisters Jess and Noemie Fox have clinched gold medals for Australia in canoe and kayak slalom — following the footsteps of their Olympic medalist mother.\n\nAustralian flagbearer Jess Fox won gold in the women’s canoe slalom and another in the kayak slalom. Her sister, Noemie, won gold in the kayak cross.\n\nAfter watching her sister win on Monday, Jess Fox leapt into the water to hug her, accompanied by their mum, Myriam, who competed in kayak singles for France and won Bronze at the 1996 Olympic Games.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after her sisters win, an elated Jess said her sisters win meant “poor dad is the only one without an Olympic medal,” Channel 9 reported.\n\nTheir father, Richard Fox, competed at the 1992 Olympic Games in the kayak singles.\n\nGreece out to a hot start in first men's basketball quarterfinal\n\nThe Greeks are bursting out of the gate in the first quarterfinal matchup against Germany.\n\nAfter the first quarter, it’s a 10-point game as Greece leads Germany 21-11. The Greeks were the lowest seed from pool play to qualify for the knockout rounds, and they are jumping on this opportunity early.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo leads the Greeks with 6 points as the world champion Germans look to turn the tide in the second.\n\nTeam USA’s Freddie Crittenden safely through to 110m hurdles semifinals after previously jogging through his heat\n\nFreddie Crittenden’s gamble paid off.\n\nThe American turned heads after appearing to take it easy in his 110m hurdles heat, jogging through the race and finishing almost five seconds behind the winner.\n\nHe eventually revealed that it was a strategic decision after feeling some pain coming into the sprint and opted to not risk injury, knowing that he had another go in the repechage race. The new system gives runners who don’t automatically qualify in their heats a second chance to make the semis.\n\nCrittenden made good on this opportunity, winning the race with a time of 13.42 seconds to qualify for the next round.\n\nThe 30-year-old is making his Olympic debut in what he describes as a “dream come true.” He kissed the track in celebration after crossing the line first.\n\nSpain’s Asier Martínez also moved on to the semifinals, finishing 0.04 seconds behind Crittenden.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Team USA’s Freddie Crittenden.\n\nFaith Kipyegon qualifies for women's 1500m semifinals after Monday's silver-medal saga\n\nIt’s been quite the 24 hours for Kenyan runner Faith Kipyegon.\n\nOn Monday night, she claimed silver in the women’s 5000m. After celebrating on track, she was then told she had been disqualified for some pushing and pulling that had occurred towards the end of the race.\n\nAfter appealing the decision, the silver medal was then reinstated around two hours later.\n\nThe rollercoaster saga didn’t knock Kipyegon off her stride this morning, though. The Kenyan qualified for the women’s 1500m semifinal after finishing fourth in her heat.\n\nKipyegon is the current world and Olympic record holder in the event and won gold at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nMeet Tara Davis-Woodhall, Team USA's long jump star\n\nThe women’s long jump competition starts today, with athletes heading to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis for the qualification rounds.\n\nAmong those bidding for a place in this year’s final is US star Tara Davis-Woodhall.\n\nThe “free-spirited” long jumper spoke to CNN earlier this year about her attitude towards the sport among other things.\n\nDavis-Woodhall will hope to replicate the form she showed at this year’s indoor world championships, where she picked up the gold medal.\n\nIt followed the bitter disappointment of finishing second at last year’s world championships.\n\nThe American is also confident she can go better than the sixth-place finish she managed at the Tokyo Games.\n\n“Now, I’ve figured out where I want to be and I’m doing what I want to do,” she said.\n\nDavis-Woodhall advanced to the long jump final with her 6.90 meters effort, and she credits her new red meat diet for helping her perform.\n\nWhen asked how she will celebrate if she wins gold, she said: “Another sirloin.”\n\nRead more about Davis-Woodhall’s life and career here.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Team USA’s Tara Davis-Woodhall.\n\nIt was another incredible day in Paris. Catch up on what happened Monday in the Olympics\n\nIt was another dramatic day at the Olympic Games that saw world records, legends slip, others soar and a relatively new sport to these Games have its breakout moment.\n\nMonday started with a dramatic triathlon. Germany took home the Olympic gold medal in the mixed relay triathlon after a late comeback by Laura Lindemann helped overcome a 12-second deficit to help the Germans get the win. The USA defending its silver medal from Tokyo and Great Britain picked up the bronze in a photo finish in front of the packed Paris streets.\n\nThe build up of the race was dominated by ongoing discussions around the safety of the River Seine.\n\nThe action then moved to the gym, where Simone Biles was aiming to go for her fourth and fifth gold medals in Paris. Instead, in the women’s floor exercise, Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade won the gold, with Biles winning her 11th medal with a silver and Jordan Chiles taking home the bronze medal.\n\nBiles had fallen off the beam earlier in the day and then struggled with another fall during her warm up. She took to the floor with her left calf strapped with tape.\n\nIn the men’s horizontal bar, the vast majority of competitors struggled with either staying on the bars or with their landings.\n\nAlice D’Amato’s sterling routine won her the gold medal in the women’s balance beam competition, a final that was also marked by disappointing performances from some of the sport’s top stars, who struggled to stay on the beam.\n\nOn the track, there was an early huge upset when Molly Caudery from Team Great Britain failed to clear 4.55 meters in the women’s pole vault qualification round. She will not be in Wednesday’s final.\n\nThe winners of the men’s and women’s 100-meter sprints – Noah Lyles and Julien Alfred cruised into the finals of the 200-meter sprint.\n\nA frantic finish in the women’s 5,000-meter final saw Kenyan Beatrice Chebet streak away from her compatriot and two-time Olympic medalist Faith Kipyegon in the closing stages. Kipyegon endured some drama after the race. She was initially disqualified and then appealed the decision. Two hours after the race was over, she was reinstated, taking the silver.\n\nGreat Britain’s Keely Hodgkinson led from the front to win the women’s 800-meter final, upgrading the silver medal she won at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAmerican discus thrower Valarie Allman struck gold for the second consecutive Olympic Games. Her best throw of the day went 69.50 meters, more than half a meter better than her gold medal throw in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nAnd Sweden’s Mondo Duplantis won the gold again in the men’s pole vault. Not satisfied with just taking the gold, Duplantis then beat his own world record, raising the bar to 6.25 meters.\n\nAnd in the nightcap, the 3x3 basketball tournament had a breakout moment with thrilling finals in both the men’s and women’s gold matches. Both matches went down to the last shot, with Germany winning the women’s gold and The Netherlands edging out host nation France to take the gold in the men’s game.\n\nIn other events:\n\nClimbing record: Aleksandra Miroslaw broke her own speed climbing world record twice in one day this Monday.\n\nAthletes qualify for pole vault: A crowded women’s pole vault final is set for Wednesday after 20 athletes made it through the qualification round. None of the competitors needed to reach the qualifying standard of 4.70m, as lower heights proved to be more than enough.\n\nMen’s parallel bars: China’s Zou Jingyuan won the gold in the men’s parallel bars.\n\nSouth Korean badminton win: An Se-young of South Korea won the gold medal in the women’s individual badminton event, beating China’s He Bing Jiao in the final. Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen successfully defended his men’s singles title on Monday, beating Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand.\n\nTeam skeet shooting: First ever skeet mixed team final was won by Italy as Team USA grabbed silver.\n\nBadminton: Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen successfully defended his men’s singles badminton title on Monday, beating Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand in the final.\n\nKayak cross: French-born Australian Noémie Fox, the younger sister of C1 and K1 gold medalist Jessica Fox, won gold in the brand-new kayak cross event on Monday. New Zealand’s Finn Butcher won gold in the men’s final.\n\nTahiti local Kauli Vaast wins gold for France in men’s surfing, while US' Caroline Marks wins women’s event\n\nTahiti local Kauli Vaast won gold for France in the men’s surfing event on Monday while Caroline Marks of Team USA won the women’s competition.\n\nVaast, who is from Teahupo’o where the event is being hosted, began the final against Australian Jack Robinson with an almost perfect 9.5 score on his first run before an 8.0 which sealed the victory.\n\nVaast, 22, was cheered on by the majority of the locals during the competition, and after claiming gold, it was a unique scene with many in the water and on land celebrating his victory.\n\nIn the women’s event, Marks produced scores of 7.50 and 3.00 but it was enough as her fellow finalist – Tatiana Weston-Webb of Brazil – fell just short of the 4.68 to win gold, scoring 4.50, as Marks was crowned Olympic champion.\n\nThe last time this wrestler competed at the Olympics, she did not concede a single point\n\nShe only recently turned 25, but Yui Susaki is already a reigning Olympic gold medalist and four-time world champion, and is widely touted as the best pound-for-pound freestyle wrestler in the world.\n\nSusaki – all five feet (1.52 meters) of her – has never lost an international bout at senior level, and another dominant performance at the Paris Games could propel her into the conversation over the greatest of all time. So how does she do it?\n\n“There’s a concept in Japanese – ‘shin-gi-tai’ – that encompasses the mental, technical and physical approach to life,” Susaki told CNN via video call between her grueling morning training sessions as she prepared for the Games.\n\n“When you get to the Olympics, the world’s highest stage, everyone’s shin-gi-tai is at similar levels. So to reach the top, you need your soul. Then your emotions are the last stretch – you need to believe in yourself constantly. I always make sure to do that when I train.”\n\nUnder the wing of long-time coach and wrestling legend Shoko Yoshimura, Susaki tore through her Olympic debut at the Covid-impacted Tokyo Games three years ago without conceding a single point in the women’s 50kg category.\n\nKnown for her technical prowess and raw strength, Susaki has been labeled “untouchable” and a “gold medal machine” by commentators in the lead-up to Paris. She intends to defend her title – but it doesn’t end there.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to Paris as there will be a live audience this time. My first goal is to win gold and I will do my best to achieve my second consecutive Olympic victory,” Susaki, a native of Chiba prefecture, said.\n\n“Then Los Angeles (2028), then Brisbane (2032), so my goal is to win at the Olympics four times in a row.”\n\nSusaki begins her title defense on Tuesday at 11 a.m. in Paris when she faces Vinesh Vinesh of India.\n\nRead more about Susaki’s journey here.\n\nA look back at Mondo Duplantis breaking the pole vault world record for the ninth time in his career\n\nNo one needs more proof that Mondo Duplantis is among the greatest athletes of this generation, but we get it almost every time he steps onto the runway.\n\nThe Paris Olympic Games were no exception. Backed by a deafening roar from those in the stands, the Swedish pole vault star broke his own world record with a giant clearance of 6.25 meters at the third and final time of asking.\n\nIt was the final act of a sweltering evening in Paris’ Stade de France on Monday, Duplantis once again underlining his complete dominance in this event by breaking the record for the ninth time in his career.\n\nAfter failing on his first two attempts at the record, Duplantis crept over the bar on his third, springing to his feet and running to the stands to embrace his family.\n\n“I haven’t processed how fantastic that moment was,” said the 24-year-old. “It’s one of those things that don’t really feel real, such an out-of-body experience. It’s still hard to kind of land right now.\n\n“What can I say? I just broke a world record at the Olympics, biggest possible stage for a pole vaulter. The biggest dream since I was a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.”\n\nDuplantis had wrapped up the gold medal long before his world record clearance, successfully defending his title from the Tokyo Olympics and adding to his three world championship crowns.\n\nRead more about Duplantis’ record-breaking evening here.\n\nUS gymnasts’ show of sportsmanship wins hearts in iconic podium moment\n\nA heartwarming display of sportsmanship by two American gymnasts on Monday won praise from fans in a viral moment that lit up social media and is likely to become another enduring image of the Paris Olympics.\n\nIt all happened when Brazilian gymnastics gold medalist Rebeca Andrade approached the podium for the medal ceremony following a women’s floor final full of twists and turns.\n\nShowing no hard feelings, American duo Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles turned to Andrade from the lower sections of the podium and bowed to the Brazilian, who raised her arms in triumph.\n\nThe golden moment, which also marked the first all-Black Olympics gymnastics podium, touched hearts on social media.\n\n“This is everything,” said a post on the Olympics’ official X, formerly known as Twitter, account underneath a photo of the moment that has been viewed more than 26 million times.\n\nClick here to read more."
