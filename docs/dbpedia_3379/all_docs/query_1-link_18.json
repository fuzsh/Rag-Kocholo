        "text": "Alexandra Orlando of Toronto won the gold medal Saturday in the women's all around competition in rhythmic gymnastics while Canada took silver in the women's team event in artistic gymnastics at the Pacific Alliance Championships in San Jose, Calif.\n\nOrlando was standing second after Friday's rope and hoop event but came back Saturday with strong performances on clubs and ribbon to take the title.\n\n\"A big win, it feels very good,\" said Orlando, who is tuning up for this summer's Olympics in Beijing. \"I was so mad at being second after yesterday [Friday] that it gave me a little push for today. I was No.-1 ranked heading in so it's a big confidence booster to win when there were expectations.\"\n\nIn the women's gymnastics team event, the U.S., took the gold with Canada second and China third.\n\nThe Canadian team members were Kristina Vaculik of Oshawa, Ont., Elyse Hopfner-Hibbs of Toronto, Nansy Damianova of Montreal and juniors Charlotte Mackie and Brittany Rogers, both of Coquitlam, B.C., and Peng Peng Lee of Toronto.\n\nIn the senior all around standings, Nastia Liukin led the U.S., to a 1-2 finish with Jana Bieger second and Dasha Joura of Australia third. Vaculik, the Canadian all around champion, was sixth.\n\nCompetition ends Sunday with the event finals in men's and women's artistic gymnastics and rhythmic gymnastics and the finals in trampoline."
