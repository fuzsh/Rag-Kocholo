        "text": "LATROBE, Pa. — Russell Wilson won’t play in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ first preseason game Friday as he recovers from a calf injury. However, the veteran quarterback has maintained the edge over Justin Fields in what coach Mike Tomlin is still calling a competition.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Tomlin underscored all of these points during his news conference to preview the Steelers’ first preseason game Friday against the Houston Texans at Acrisure Stadium.\n\nTomlin put the “pole position” label on Wilson but promised competition when the Steelers acquired both quarterbacks this offseason. That dynamic was complicated unexpectedly when Wilson injured his calf while pushing a sled during the team’s conditioning test on July 24.\n\nThe injury limited Wilson’s participation significantly in team periods last week. On Tuesday, he took a step forward when he took part more fully in 11-on-11 periods, including the popular Seven Shots segment to open practice. However, as of Wednesday morning, Wilson had thrown just a handful of passes in 11-on-11 settings.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nQB Russell Wilson takes big step in recovery\n\nBecause of Wilson’s limitations, Fields has taken the overwhelming majority of first-team reps in camp. Asked if Wilson still has the “pole position,” Tomlin referred to the depth chart the team released on Tuesday, which listed Wilson as QB1.\n\n“You guys saw the depth chart that I released yesterday,” Tomlin said. “That is real.”\n\nAt the same time, Tomlin is at least publicly saying there is still a chance for that depth chart to change ahead of the season opener on Sept. 8. and the preseason game will be an opportunity for Fields to make up ground.\n\n“It very much is a competition,” Tomlin said. “What happens in stadium is weighted heavier than what happens in a practice setting, because it’s more game-like.”\n\nTomlin confirmed that Fields is scheduled to start with the first-team offense on Friday. Tomlin plans for that group to get a few series of action.\n\n“(Fields) comes to compete every day,” Tomlin said. “He’s got an awesome competitive spirit. We’ve got a competitive environment, and it seems like he’s enjoying it. He’s doing a good job acclimating himself to it and his teammates and letting his talent show.”\n\nIn addition to Wilson, several other prominent Steelers are not scheduled to play Friday. Tomlin said he will hold out established veterans like left guard Isaac Seumalo, defensive lineman Cameron Heyward and edge rushers T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith. Inside linebacker Patrick Queen and safety Minkah Fitzpatrick are dealing with minor injuries and also will not play.\n\nRequired reading\n\nHow do AFC cornerback groups stack up heading into 2024 season?\n\n49ers confirm permission for Brandon Aiyuk to seek trade; Browns, Steelers suitors?\n\nSteelers training camp: Whose stock is up, who is trending down?\n\n(Photo: Joe Sargent / Getty Images)"
