        "text": "In Toronto, on 8 July, the IOC President addressed the 53rd General Assembly of the Pan-American Sports Organisation (PASO) chaired by IOC Member Julio César Maglione. He gave a speech on the progress of the implementation of Olympic Agenda 2020. He underlined the measures already taken with respect to the Olympic Games candidature process and the sports programme, transparency, good governance and compliance, as well as the Olympic Channel. The previous evening, at the Congress opening dinner, President Bach was presented with the PASO Order by its President, Julio César Maglione.\n\nOn the first day of the 2015 Pan Am Games, President Bach took in a full day of sports competition. Accompanied by Julio César Maglione and Marcel Aubut, he started the day with rugby sevens, and moved onto squash where he met Paraguayan Nicolas Caballero, a 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Ambassador. After the men’s and women’s BMX finals, the President finished the day at diving at the men’s 3m springboard final. Accompanied by Claudia Bokel, Chair of IOC Athletes' Commission and IOC Executive Board Member, the President visited the athletes’ village, where he was taken around by members of the PASO Athletes’ Commission, which is chaired by Canadian Alexandra Orlando. He met dozens of athletes and visited the athletes' accommodation. The President described the athletes’ village as “excellent\" and up to \"Olympic standards.\"\n\nOn 9 July, the IOC President made an emotional return to Montreal on the occasion of the Canada Olympic Excellence Day. It was his first visit since winning a fencing Olympic gold medal in 1976. He was accompanied throughout the day by IOC Members Richard W. Pound and Julio César Maglione, and COC President, Marcel Aubut. (You can also relive this day through a video).\n\nAt the City Hall, the President was made an honorary citizen of the city of Montreal by Mayor Denis Coderre and, as a symbol, received the key to the city during a ceremony held in the presence of almost 130 guests, among which Canadian Transport Minister Robert Poëti; COC President Marcel Aubut; President of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and IOC Vice-President Sir Craig Reedie; and IOC Member Julio César Maglione.\n\nAt a lunch attended by more than 2,000 people, including almost 200 Olympians, President Bach made a keynote speech about the reforms the IOC has undertaken with Olympic Agenda 2020 and praised the great contribution Canada has made to the Olympic Movement. The Chairman of NBC Sports Group, Mark Lazarus, and the Canadian Olympian sisters, Chloé, Justine and Maxime Dufour-Lapointe, also made some remarks during this fundraising event, an initiative of COC President Marcel Aubut, which raised over CAD 1.6 million for Canadian athletes.\n\nIn the evening, President Bach joined more than 100,000 people of Montreal to celebrate the placing of the Olympic rings on the new headquarters of the Canadian Olympic Committee. Montreal is the first Olympic city to take advantage of new proposals from Olympic Agenda 2020 which allow for the rings to be displayed prominently as a symbol of the legacy of the Olympic Games. Also at the celebration were dozens of Olympians, including Nadia Comaneci, Katarina Witt, Bart Conner (see photo), Johann Olav Koss, Mark Tewksbury, Steve Podborski and Greg Louganis.\n\nMario Pescante was appointed by the IOC President as liaison person with the Vatican City State which enjoys status of Permanent Observer to the United Nations like the IOC. He had a working meeting with the Undersecretary, Mons. Melchor Sánchez De Toca y Alameda, in charge of the Department of Culture and Sport of the Vatican. The meeting was held on 6 July at the Pontifical Council for Culture. Working meetings between the IOC and the Vatican City State are going on in order to strengthen the close existing cooperation between the two Institutions that will materialise, among other things, with an International Forum on \"Faith and Sport\" to be held in Rome in 2016. The Forum will see keynote speeches by Pope Francis, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the IOC President. Participants will include international sports representatives, leaders and athletes representing different continents and religious beliefs.\n\nReynaldo González López, IOC Member in Cuba, has died at the age of 66.

The IOC has now submitted the request for permission to extend its headquarters in the area adjacent to the Château de Vidy, and a public inquiry will be held from 30 June to 30 July 2015. Named “Olympic House” and designed by Danish architects 3XN, the new building will offer a place of welcome for the IOC Members, and will be a meeting place for the whole Olympic Movement. It will also allow for the entire administration to be grouped together in a single location, which will lead to significant long-term cost savings, greater efficiency and better use of energy.

The innovative design, which is inspired by the warmth of the Brazilian people, features movable segments that expand vertically to reveal the colours of Brazil when the Olympic flame is passed from one torchbearer to another. The triangular shape of the torch, meanwhile, alludes to the three Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect, while the floating effect of its different segments represents the efforts of the athletes. The design chosen is that of the São Paulo-based creative studio Chelles & Hayashi. The torch will be carried by some 12,000 torchbearers in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Torch Relay organised by Coca-Cola, Nissan and Bradesco, and which will stop over in 300 towns and villages throughout Brazil before the Olympic Games next year.
