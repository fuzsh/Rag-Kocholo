        "text": "PRESENTS\n\nCanadian Sports\n\nSPORTS IN CANADA\n\nCanadians enjoy sports of all types. They like to watch and they like to play all types of indoor and outdoor sports. The following will give you some idea of what Canada enjoys in the sporting world:- Alpine skiing, archery, automobile racing, badminton, baseball, basketball, billiards, boating, bodybuilding, bowling, boxing, broomball, caving, climbing, cricket, cross-country skiing, curling, cycling, darts, dog sled racing, diving, drag racing, downhill skiing, equestrian, fencing, field hockey, fishing, football, golf, gymnastics, horse racing, ice and snow sports, ice hockey, jet skiing, judo, karate, lacrosse, motorcycle racing, Olympic sports, polo, ringette, rugby, skiing, softball, speed and figure skating, snow boarding, soccer, squash, swimming, table tennis, target shooting, tennis, track and field, triathlon, volleyball, water sports, weightlifting and wrestling\n\nThe most prefered spectator sports are Ice hockey, Lacrosse, Curling and Canadian Football.\n\nFor information on how Canada has performed in the Olympics, go to our CANADIAN OLYMPIANS Page HOCKEY NIGHT IN CANADA and ELSEWHERE\n\nFoster Hewitt was known as \"The Voice of Hockey Night in Canada\". He began broadcasting the games from Toronto in 1926, when the only radio reception available was via a home-built 'crystal set'. He continued on radio and then on television for over 5 decades. Foster Hewitt's opening, \"Hello, Canada, and hockey fans in the United States and Newfoundland!\" is one of th most remembered opening statements in sports.\n\nHockey is still our national sport, just as baseball is in the USA. At one time nearly all NHL players were Canadian. A large number of them still are. Canada has 6 teams in the NHL - the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Montreal Canadiens, the Calgary Flames, the Ottawa Senators, the Edmonton Oilers and the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nSir John Franklin described a \"hockey on the ice\" game on Great Bear Lake (NT) in November 1825 in a letter to a friend. This is the earliest known reference to the game.\n\nThe first PUBLIC hockey game was played in Old Montreal in 1875. The puck was a block of wood. The game was between 2 McGill University teams and was called off 'mid-way' because of fighting and rough play!.\n\nThe first PROFESSIONAL hockey team was established in 1914.\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens were formed in 1909 by Ambrose O'Brian, but they were an amateur team and did not turn pro until later.\n\nThe first ARTIFICIAL ICE arenas were built in Vancouver and Victoria (BC) by Frank and Leater Patrick. Victoria hosted the first game ever to be played on artificial ice.\n\nThe first outdoor NHL Scheduled Hockey Game in 86 years was played in Edmonton, AB on Nov 22, 2003. A special rink was constructed within Commonwealth Stadium and over 56,000 hockey fans attended in -25C weather.\n\nFor our American hockey friends - the first USA team to win a Stanley Cup was the Seattle Metropolitans in 1917.\n\nCanadian Hayley Wickenheiser of Calgary, AB, was the first woman to register a point in a professional men's hockey game. She scored the assist for Finland's Kirkkonummi Salamat in January 2003 during the first game of a 30-day tryout.\n\nWorld Hockey - Canada\n\nWINTER OLYMPIC GAMES AND\n\nITERNATIONAL ICE HOCKEY FEDERATION\n\nMEDAL WINNERS - CANADA\n\nOlympic Games - Men Gold 9 Silver 4 Bronze 3\n\nOlympic Games - Women Gold 14 Silver 9 Bronze 0\n\nIIHF Men Gold 28 Silver 16 Bronze 9\n\nIIHF Men Under 20 Gold 20 Silver 10 Bronze 5\n\nIIHF Men Under 18 Gold 4 Silver 1 Bronze 4\n\nIIHF Women Gold 13 Silver 9 Bronze 1\n\nIIHF Women Under 18 Gold 6 Silver 7 Bronze 1\n\nCanada Cup/World Cup Gold 6 Silver 2 Bronze 0\n\nLACROSSE\n\nLacrosse is considered to be Canada's national game, although hockey is often thought of in the same way.\n\nOne of the first sports ever played in Canada, lacrosse came from the native peoples living in the region that extends eastward from Hudson Bay. It was played by them with a ball made from a deerskin bag stuffed with deer hair.\n\nThe Canadian Lacrosse Association makes annual awards in the form of the MINTO CUP (established in 1901) for the Junior Amateur Championship team and the MANN CUP (established in 1910) to the Senior team.\n\nTwo distinct 'types' of lacrosse are popular in Canada - field lacrosse, which is played outdoors, and box lacrosse played in an indoor arena. Box lacrosse is rapidly gaining in popularity and is played only by men's teams. Both men's and women's teams play field lacrosse.\n\nWith the introduction of the World Cup of Lacrosse, this distinctly Canadian game is gaining stature around the world.\n\nEvery wooden lacrosse stick used in the world today is made in the only factory of its type, located in Cornwall (ON).\n\nCFL FOOTBALL\n\nCanada also has its own version of the NFL - the CFL (Canadian Football League). Football is very popular in all regions of Canada.\n\nThere are 9 teams in the league - the B.C. Lions (Vancouver), the Stampeders (Calgary), the Elks (Edmonton), the Roughriders (Saskatchewan), the Blue Bombers (Winnipeg), the Tiger Cats (Hamilton), the Redblacks (Ottawa), the Argonauts (Toronto) and the Alouettes (Montreal).\n\nThe all-time passing record (79,816 yards) is held by the Montréal Alouettes' Anthony Calvillo on October 10, 2011.\n\nLui Passaglia -(Lions #5) holds the most records in the CFL. He played for the B.C. Lions for 25 years (1976-2000). He was a CFL All Star 5 times and a West Division All Star 10 times in his career.\n\nAs a field goal and place kicker, Lui is pro football's all-time leading scorer. He amassed a record 3,991 points in a record 408 games with the B.C. Lions. He won 3 CFL Grey Cup Championships with the Lions and he also holds records for the most converts, 1,045; and field goals, 875.\n\nEach year the winning teams from the East and the West Divisions play for the Grey Cup Championship(sort of a Canadian Super Bowl).\n\nThe FIRST Grey Cup was won in 1909 by Toronto University.\n\nDuring the past 10 years the winners were:\n\n| 2023 - Montreal | 2022 - Toronto | 2021 - Winnipeg | 2020 - Cancelled - COVID | 2019 - Winnipeg |\n\n| 2018 - Calgary | 2017 - Toronto | 2016 - Ottawa | 2015 - Edmonton | 2014 - Calgary |\n\nNOTE:- The Baltimore Stallions were in existance for only 2 years (1994 & 1995). They played in the Grey Cup final both years and were the only American CFL team to win a Grey Cup (1995).\n\nNBA BASKETBALL\n\nCanada now has only one basketball team in the NBA - the Toronto Raptors. (The second team, Vancouver Grizzlies was moved to Memphis.) By the way, for those of you who don't know, basketball was invented by a Canadian physical education teacher James A. Naismith in 1891.\n\nThe first-ever NBA Playoff game to be held in Canada was played in Toronto (ON) on April 30, 2000 between the Toronto Raptors and the New York Knicks. The Knicks won 87-80 and in so doing, eliminated the Raptors by winning 3 straight games.\n\nIn June 2019 the Toronto Raptors won the NBA Championship in the 6th game of the series. This was the first NBA Championship for a Canadian team.\n\nVictoria, BC's basketballer Steve Nash (Phoenix Suns) was voted NBA Most Valuable Player for the 2004-2005 season and AGAIN for the 2005-2006 season. He is the first Canadian to receive this award.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL\n\nCanada has one baseball team in the Major Leagues - the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League. The Montreal Expos were in the National League until 2004, but have now been moved to Washington and are called the Nationals.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays are the only Canadian team to win the World Series Championship of Baseball. They actually won back-to-back World Series titles in 1992 & 1993.\n\nLITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL\n\nTeam Canada (Fraser Valley Orioles) won the Big League World Series title in Tucson, AZ. They won 9-8 in the 10th inning against U.S. Champion Jeffersonville, on August 15, 2000.\n\nSKIING AND SNOW-BOARDING\n\nWhistler/Blackcomb (in southern B.C.) has been rated the \"number one ski area in North America\" by 2 major ski magazines.\n\nAlmost every Province/Territory in Canada has excellent ski and snow-boarding slopes plus cross-country trails to be enjoyed in Winter.\n\nSOCCER\n\nSoccer (football) is a very popular sport in Canada. There are soccer clubs and leagues for children, youths, adults and professionals all across Canada.\n\nCanadian teams also play on the A-League against USA teams.\n\nCanada teams have won three international titles: NAFC champions (1990), Gold Cup (2000), CONCACAF champions (1985). Most of the National Team players play abroad. They participated in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, the only Canadian participation on the world's biggest tournament. Their best win dates back a long way in a venerable rivalry tradition: in 1904, Canada defeated the USA 7-0.\n\nCanadian non-amateur Clubs are: Men - Edmonton Drillers, Montreal Impact, Toronto Lynx and Vancouver Whitecaps (previously known as Vancouver 86ers ). Women - Ottawa Fury, Toronto Inferno, and Vancouver Whitecaps (previously known as the Breakers). The major Canadian Leagues are: Alberta Major Soccer League, Canadian Professional Soccer League and Pacific Coast League.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD\n\nCanada's greatest marathon and Olympic long-distance runner was Tom (Thomas Charles) Longboat, an Onondagan Indian. He was born on the Six Nations Reserve, outside Caledonia, ON, on June 4, 1886. He died in Toronto, ON on January 9, 1949, a broken and virtually forgotten man.\n\nThe title of World's 3rd fastest man is held by Canada's Donovan Bailey, who shares the 3rd place record with fellow Canadian Bruny Surin. Their time for the 100 meter sprint is clocked at 9.84 (set in 1996 for Bailey and 1999 for Surin.)\n\nSPEED SKATING\n\nCatriona Le May Doan is the first Canadian to successfully defend an Olympic gold medal in an individual sport. She won her second gold medal in the 500-metre speed skating event at the 2002 Olympics.\n\nWORLD FIGURE SKATING\n\nCanada has a long history of excellence in World Figure Skating.\n\nCanada's Figure Skating (GOLD) World Champions include:-\n\n1947 Barbara Ann Scott (Ladies)\n\n1948 Barbara Ann Scott (Ladies)\n\n1954 Frances Dafoe and Norris Bowden (Pairs)\n\n1955 Frances Dafoe and Norris Bowden (Pairs)\n\n1957 Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul (Pairs)\n\n1958 Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul (Pairs)\n\n1959 Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul (Pairs)\n\n1960 Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul (Pairs)\n\n1962 Donald Jackson (Mens)\n\n1962 Maria Jelinek and Otto Jelinek (Pairs)\n\n1963 Donald McPherson (Mens)\n\n1965 Petra Burka (Ladies)\n\n1973 Karen Magnussen (Ladies)\n\n1984 Barbara Underhill and Paul Martini (Pairs)\n\n1987 Brian Orser (Mens)\n\n1989 Kurt Browning (Mens)\n\n1990 Kurt Browning (Mens)\n\n1991 Kurt Browning (Mens)\n\n1993 Kurt Browning (Mens)\n\n1993 Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler (Pairs)\n\n1994 Elvis Stojko (Mens)\n\n1995 Elvis Stojko (Mens)\n\n1997 Elvis Stojko (Mens)\n\n2001 Jamie Salé and David Pelletier (Pairs)\n\n2003 Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz (Dance)\n\n2008 Jeffrey Buttle (Mens)\n\n2010 Tessa Virtue and Scott Muir (Dance)\n\n2011 Patrick Chan (Mens)\n\n2012 Tessa Virtue and Scott Muir (Dance)\n\n2012 Patrick Chan (Mens)\n\n2013 Patrick Chan (Mens)\n\n2015 Meagan Duhmal and Eric Radford (Pairs)\n\n2016 Meagan Duhmal and Eric Radford (Pairs)\n\n2017 Tessa Virtue and Scott Muir (Dance)\n\n2018 Katelyn Osmond (Ladies)\n\n2024 Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps (Pairs)\n\nCanadian Kurt Browning landed the first-ever \"official\" quad jump (4 rotations in the air) in the World Figure Skating Championships.\n\nDeanna Stellato-Dudek is the oldest Canadian woman to win a World Gold Championship\n\nCanadian Olympic Medal winners in Figure Skating\n\nvisit our Olympics page\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONS\n\nThe following are the holders of the Senior Canadian National Figure Skating Championship titles for the past 8 years:-\n\n2024\n\nWesley CHIU - Senior Men\n\nKaiya RUITER- Senior Women\n\nDeanna STELLATO-DUDEK / Maxime DESCHAMPS - Senior Pairs\n\nPiper GILLIES / Paul POIRIER - Senior Dance 2023\n\nKeegan MESSING - Senior Men\n\nMadeline SCHIZAS- Senior Women\n\nDeanna STELLATO-DUDEK / Maxime DESCHAMPS - Senior Pairs\n\nNicolaj SORENSEN / Laurence Fouriner BEAUDRY - Senior Dance 2022\n\nKeegan MESSING - Senior Men\n\nMadeline SCHIZAS- Senior Women\n\nKirsten MOORE-TOWERS / Michael MAUNARO - Senior Pairs\n\nPiper GILLIES / Paul POIRIER - Senior Dance 2021\n\nCanadian Nationals Cancelled Due to COVID-19 2020\n\nRoman SADOVSKY - Senior Men\n\nEmily BANSBACK - Senior Women\n\nKirsten MOORE-TOWERS / Michael MAUNARO - Senior Pairs\n\nPiper GILLIES / Paul POIRIER - Senior Dance 2019\n\nNam NEUYEN - Senior Men\n\nAlaine CHARTRAND - Senior Women\n\nKirsten MOORE-TOWERS / Michael MAUNARO - Senior Pairs\n\nKaitlyn WEAVER / Abdrew POJE - Senior Dance 2018\n\nPatrick CHAN - Senior Men\n\nGabrielle DALEMAN - Senior Women\n\nMeagan DUHAMEL / Eric RADFORD - Senior Pairs\n\nTessa VIRTUE / Scott MOIR- Senior Dance 2017\n\nPatrick CHAN - Senior Men\n\nKatelyn OSMOND - Senior Women\n\nMeagan DUHAMEL / Eric RADFORD - Senior Pairs\n\nTessa VIRTUE / Scott MOIR- Senior Dance\n\n2018 was Pastrick CHAN's 10th Men's Canadian Championship.\n\n2018 was Tessa VIRTUE / Scott MOIR's 8th Senior Dance Chanpionship\n\n2018 was Meagan DUHAMEL and Eric RADFORD's 7th Senior pairs Championship\n\nKevin REYNOLDS is the first skater in ISU history to land a quadruple jump in Men's short program and first to perform 2 quads in the same short program at the 29 October 2010 Skate Canada and again in the 2011 Canada Championships.\n\nCURLING\n\nIt is reported that curling was first played in Canada by the Fraser Highlanders at Louisbourg in 1758. General Wolfe's soldiers are also known to have played the game in Canada a year later. It is believed that they used gun-carriage hubs as 'stones' on frozen rivers.
