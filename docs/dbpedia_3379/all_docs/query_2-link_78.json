        "text": "PARIS — From Andre De Grasse's 200-metre semifinal to Canadians in beach volleyball action, here are five things to look out for at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday, Aug. 7:\n\nDE GRASSE DEFENCE\n\nAndre De Grasse continues his defence of his Olympic 200-metre title when he runs in the semifinals. De Grasse finished second in his heat behind 100-metre champion Noah Lyles to advance. The star sprinter from Markham, Ont., won't have his personal coach with him when he runs. Coach Rana Reider had his accreditation revoked by the Canadian Olympic Committee on Tuesday for unspecified reasons. The 200 final goes Thursday.\n\n---\n\nSAND SPIKERS\n\nMelissa Humana-Paredes and Brandie Wilkerson can put themselves in a position to play for a medal when they face Spain's Daniela Alvarez and Tania Moreno in a women's beach volleyball quarterfinal. The Toronto tandem advanced with an upset win over second-ranked Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss of the United States on Monday. Humana-Paredes and Wilkerson both made it to the quarterfinals at the Tokyo Games with different partners before joining forces.\n\n---\n\nTEEING OFF\n\nCanadians Brooke Henderson and Alena Sharp are in the field as women's golf gets underway at Le Golf National southwest of Paris. Henderson, from Smiths Falls, Ont., tied for seventh at the Rio Games in 2016. The 13-time champion on the LPGA Tour also competed in Tokyo. Sharp, from Hamilton, won bronze at the 2023 Pan Am Games and is coming off a pair of top-20 finishes last month.\n\n---\n\nGOING FOR MOH\n\nCanadian long-distance runner Moh Ahmed of St. Catharines, Ont., returns to action in the 5,000-metre heats. Ahmed won the silver medal in the event at the Tokyo Games. He is looking to return to the podium after just missing in the 10,000 metres, where he finished fourth after a gutsy run.\n\n---\n\nDINGHY DO-OVER\n\nOrganizers hope that the medal races for one-person dinghies can finally take place after being scrapped Tuesday due to fickle winds in Marseille. In the women's race, Marit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands has enough of a lead that she just needs to complete the medal race to win gold. Toronto's Sarah Douglas is in 10th overall after nine races.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 6, 2024.\n\nThe Canadian Press"
