        "text": "Results (PDF)\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., March 29, 2008 – The USA won the team gold medal and claimed four all-around medals in the junior and senior rhythmic gymnastics divisions at the 2008 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships presented by Gillette Venus in San Jose, Calif. Marlee Shape of Buffalo Grove, Ill., won the junior all-around crown and Anastasia Torba of Orinda, Calif., won the bronze medal. In the senior all-around, Lisa Wang of Buffalo Grove, Ill., claimed the silver medal and Rachel Marmer of Los Angeles earned the bronze medal.\n\nThe U.S. Team’s score of 236.325 was 7.625 points better than Canada’s 228.700. Russia placed third with 218.300 points. Ava Gehringer of Buffalo Grove, Ill., and Tyler Rosemond of Fresh Meadows, N.Y., were members of the U.S. Team along with Marmer, Shape, Torba and Wang.\n\nShape posted an all-around score of 57.000 to best Canada’s Nerissa Mo, who placed second at 55.975, and Torba, who finished third at 55.400. Rosemond posted a score of 55.525 for sixth overall but is not in the final rankings because there is a maximum of two gymnasts per country in the final all-around rankings.\n\n“I just tried my hardest, went out there and performed and had fun,” Shape said. “I wanted to show that I had confidence and I wanted to project how much fun I was having. I couldn’t have done it without my team because they really helped me throughout the whole thing.”\n\nIn the senior division, Wang posted a 62.325 and Marmer earned a 59.575 to finish behind Canada’s Alexandra Orlando, who won the gold medal with a score of 63.925. Gehringer’s 56.875 was the fifth-best all-around score but did not count in the final rankings due to the two athletes per country limit.\n\n“I was very excited, but I feel like I could’ve done better,” Wang said. “I could’ve been more consistent, but I tried to go out there and show my expression and amplitude. I hope that I was able to convey my enjoyment of the sport to the audience.”\n\nRhythmic gymnastics competition concludes tomorrow with individual event finals at 3 p.m.\n\nAbout the Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships presented by Gillette Venus\n\nThe 2008 Pacific Rim Championships features competition in men’s and women’s artistic gymnastics; rhythmic gymnastics; and trampoline.\n\nThe remaining schedule for artistic gymnastics at the Pacific Rim Championships is: Sunday, March 30 — men’s and women’s individual event finals, juniors at 12 p.m. and seniors at 6 p.m. The competition is at the Events Center at San Jose State University.\n\nThe remaining schedule for rhythmic gymnastics and trampoline is: Sunday, March 30 — rhythmic and trampoline individual event finals, 3 p.m. Competition is at San Jose McEnery Conventions Center.\n\nNBC Sports is broadcasting action from the Pacific Rim Championships on April 13 at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Pacific Rim Championships, previously known as the Pacific Alliance Championships, were held in Honolulu in 2004 and 2006.
