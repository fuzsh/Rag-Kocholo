(AP Photo/Esteban Felix)\n\nWinnipeg’s Skylar Park was the first Manitoban to qualify to go to Paris.\n\nThe 24-year-old Taekwondo athlete will be marking her second Olympics. She has had plenty of success over her career starting in 2016 when she won gold in the 59kg category at the World Taekwondo Junior Championships. That same year she won bronze in the 57kg category at the Pan American Championships. She has also been able to take home three gold medals at the championships in 2018, 2021, and 2022.\n\nShe won a silver at the Pan American Games in 2019 and a gold in 2023.\n\nIn her first Olympic experience in Tokyo in 2020, she was able to reach the quarterfinals.\n\nKelsey Wog recovers after winning the Women’s 200m Breaststroke at the 2020 Olympic Swimming Trials in Toronto on Tuesday June 22, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn\n\nThe second Manitoban on the list is Kelsey Wog, who is also from Winnipeg.\n\nShe will be swimming in her second Olympic games after making her debut in Tokyo.\n\nIn the Canadian Olympic Swimming Trials in 2020, Wog won the 100m breaststroke, as well as the 200m and won silver in the 200m medley.\n\nShe was able to make it to the semifinals of the 200m breaststroke at the 2020 Olympics.\n\nWog won a gold medal in 2017 at the Universiade for her role in the 4x100m freestyle relay.\n\nThe University of Manitoba graduate also won the U Sports Female Athlete of the Year, Swimmer of the Year, and was named an Academic All-Canadian in 2019-20.\n\nTyler Mislawchuk of Canada #6 competes during the ITU World Triathlon Series race in Montreal, Sunday, August 26, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes\n\nThe third Manitoban to qualify for Paris is Oak Bluff's Tyler Mislawchuk.\n\nThe triathlon athlete will be competing in his third Olympics. In Rio and Tokyo, he finished 15th both times.\n\nThe 29-year-old is considered one of the most successful Canadians to participate in the sport as he has multiple top 10 and top five finishes to his name, which included a bronze in 2019 at the World Triathlon Championship Series and a silver at the World Triathlon Cup last year.\n\n\"Third time's a charm. Improbably just as excited as I was for my first Olympics but three is special,\" Mislawchuk said in a news release Monday. \"My first Games in Rio, I was just so excited to make the team as an underdog. Tokyo, I came in with a lot stronger odds on me and I ended up injuring myself, and now I find myself in Paris in the prime of my career ready to rip.\"\n\nShae la Roche of Canada, left, in action against Sabrina van der Sloot of the Netherlands during the women's water polo Round of 16 match between Canada and the Netherlands at the 19th FINA World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Sunday, June 26, 2022.

She set a school record with 302 goals, and is only one of five NCAA players to have more than 300 goals.\n\nCanada's Eric Loeppky (80) spikes the ball during Volleyball Nations League action against the USA, in Ottawa, on Saturday, June 8, 2024.

In 2020, she helped the women's soccer team secure the gold medal, and won bronze with Team Canada in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOutside of the Olympic stage, Scott has been a part of gold medal teams – the CONCACAF Championship in 2010 and the Pan American Games in 2011.\n\nShe played for the University of Manitoba Bisons from 2005 to 2010 and has suited up professionally for several teams, most recently Utah Royals FC from 2018 to 2020.\n\nCTV News Winnipeg will update this list as more Manitobans qualify for the 2024 Olympics Summer Games in Paris."
