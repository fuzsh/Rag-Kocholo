        "text": "Hunter Smith on the Men’s Wakeboard Podium at the 2023 Santiago Pan American Games\n\nPhoto by Express Media / Panam Sports\n\nCanada’s own Hunter Smith shone brightly on the Pan Am stage, winning the silver medal in Men’s Wakeboard at the 2023 Santiago Pan American Games. Despite the high-pressure stakes, Smith, who was third to take to the water in the finals, delivered a stellar performance that left the audience and judges in awe.\n\nWith his run complete and four competitors yet to perform, the anticipation was palpable. Every trick from the remaining riders meant an agonizing wait for Smith. Ultimately, his top-tier performance secured him a spot on the podium, a testament to his relentless commitment to the sport.\n\nOverwhelmed with emotion after the event, Smith reflected, “A lot of hard hours, a lot of work, a lot of dedication. I’ve been working really hard to get to the Games and to succeed in finals is just an unbelievable moment. I couldn’t be happier.”\n\nSmith’s success doesn’t just belong to him; it’s a beacon of inspiration for the entire wakeboard community in Canada. To his fellow enthusiasts and future athletes, Smith shared a heartfelt message, “Let’s just keep our sport going and keep it strong. It may be cold for 8 months out of the year but we can still get on the lake in the summer and push ourselves to be better.”\n\nTraining in Canada, where the climate doesn’t always cooperate, has its challenges. Smith has had to travel extensively to find the right training partners and conditions. “It’s really hard to find people to wakeboard with. I’ve made a lot of great friends in Florida and California to go train with. They let me stay at their houses, they let me ride their boats, and they let me train as much as I can. To those people in the States, I really appreciate you guys.”\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada is immensely proud of Smith’s achievements and celebrates the dedication and passion he represents. This silver medal is not just a win for Smith but a testament to the determination of athletes and the incredible potential of wakeboarding in Canada.\n\nAbout Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada:\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada (WSWC) is the national governing body for water skiing and wakeboarding in Canada.

The competition intensified as he jumped 63.9 meters. But the true spectacle was during the Tricks segment. Facing a challenging 30-point deficit, Dorien unleashed a masterclass, scoring 11,000 points. This feat not only propelled him into the lead but sealed his gold victory with a decisive margin of 280 points.\n\nThis gold achievement adds a glowing finish to his already notable Pan American Games journey. Just the day before, Llewellyn earned Silver medals in both the Men’s Jump and Men’s Trick events.\n\nSpeaking on the overwhelming emotion and celebration after his last run, Llewellyn shared, “That’s kind of just been the built-up energy from the last four months… To end on that trick run was amazing… I’m also excited to regroup and focus on getting my foot 100% again.”\n\nRemarking on the challenges he faced, he said, “It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions. After slalom, I knew I put myself in a really good spot. To have that moment where you celebrate and I turn around and my dad is celebrating in the boat, that’s amazing. To be able to share that history with him, it’s something that I don’t think a lot of people have and I’m truly grateful.”\n\nJaret Llewellyn, Dorien’s father and a 12-time Pan Am Games medalist, shared in the pride and reflected on the journey, “It was a rough season. Athletes are always shooting for the gold. We just didn’t even know if we were even going to be here so this is just an incredible way to end the season.” On his own experiences versus witnessing his son’s achievements, he expressed, “It was much easier skiing than going through this. It’s one of the best experiences.”\n\nWith two consecutive Overall Gold medals at the Pan Am Games, Dorien Llewellyn’s narrative is one of perseverance, resilience, and unparalleled skill, and stands as an inspiration for aspiring athletes everywhere.\n\nAbout Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada:\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada (WSWC) is the national governing body for water skiing and wakeboarding in Canada.

Transitioning seamlessly, Paige then made a commendable leap of 46.5m in the jump event and rounded off the day with a tricks score of 8890 points.\n\nEntering the tricks discipline, Paige was behind by 216 points but managed to narrow down the gap to a mere 10 points, winning the silver medal and exemplifying the tight competition at this elite level.\n\nThis achievement is particularly notable as it marks Paige’s third medal at the 2023 Santiago Pan American Games, having previously secured bronze in both the Women’s Slalom and Women’s Jump events.\n\nAfter the event, an elated yet reflective Paige shared, “It felt awesome, I was really close to that Gold which was a little bit frustrating but I’m just really thankful to be here and be representing Team Canada.” Discussing the nail-biting closeness of the competition, she mentioned, “It just comes down to those tiny little maneuvers, those seconds, those meters, it means everything for overall. I fell short a little bit but I’m still really proud of myself for everything I overcame.” On her overall haul at this edition of the Pan American Games, she expressed, “It feels awesome. Last Pan Am Games I had three bronze and my goal was to bring home either a silver or a gold and I met that goal.”\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada applauds Paige Rini for her unparalleled commitment, skill, and determination.\n\nAbout Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada:\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada (WSWC) is the national governing body for water skiing and wakeboarding in Canada.

Addressing his incredible feat, he said, “It was a good day. Obviously getting medals at all is awesome and to get two in the two finals I was in is great.”\n\nReflecting on his silver in the jump event, Llewellyn stated, “I’d be lying if I said the silver in Jump wasn’t a little disappointing, especially to come that close. You’re talking about .2 meters; it’s tough.” He also acknowledged the challenges he faced following a significant foot injury, remarking, “I hold myself to a high standard and I feel like coming back from this injury with my foot, I’m just not where I was before, and it’s tough when you feel like you’re a little bit stuck in a cage.” In a gracious nod to his competitors, he added, “At the end of the day, Milo went out and crushed a jump, and I couldn’t match that. So congrats to him.”\n\nLlewellyn’s exceptional day continued with the Men’s Trick Finals, where he achieved a remarkable 10,690 points. “To back it up with another silver in trick was great,” he remarked. “I was sitting in fourth going into the finals, and I went out and stood up. The name of the game is to always stand up and let everyone else make mistakes. The two guys made a couple of mistakes, and that’s just the game.”\n\nAlthough he hasn’t yet secured the gold, Llewellyn remains resilient and focused. Looking ahead to the Men’s Overall Finals, slated for tomorrow, October 24, 2023, he expressed his determination, saying, “I haven’t gotten that medal yet that’s the right color, but the overall final tomorrow, so I’ll try to step it up.”\n\nDorien also discussed the emotional and physical challenges of returning to the jump event following a major injury, explaining, “Today was probably the first jump set where I came into it, and I was super pumped. It’s tough to go out there knowing that you had a serious injury in jump.” He further emphasized, “It’s improvements mentally and physically on the water.”\n\nAs he anticipates the upcoming finals, Llewellyn exudes confidence, stating, “I feel good. Everything I did today was an improvement on the first round, so if I just keep that momentum going, then I feel really good about where I am.” He highlighted the importance of consistency, sharing, “At the end of the day, same thing as what I did in the trick finals. You’ve got to go out there; you’ve got to put a score down. Other people might make mistakes, you try to limit your own and just see what happens.”\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada is proud to support Dorien Llewellyn in his quest for excellence, and we invite fans to join us in cheering him on as he embarks on the Men’s Overall Finals, where he will compete in Slalom, Trick, and Jump.

She was joined on the podium with fellow Canadian Team Member Paige Rini who won bronze. Ross then went on to compete in the Women’s Tricks Finals. Her tactical yet ambitious execution earned her a score of 10,870 points, culminating in her second silver for the day.\n\nReflecting on her performance, Ross shared, “My goal was to come here and try to get on the podium twice, I did that so I’m walking away accomplishing my goal. I wanted to go for the gold in tricks, I had a run that could do it. I was a little bit slow but I’m still very proud to be representing Canada with the silver medal.”\n\nRoss delved into the intricacies of the tricks event, adding, “It’s tough because in tricks it’s so much strategy based off of what other people do. I went with a very high scoring run and it’s pretty risky because if one trick is out of time, you lose a lot of points. We went for it, I still got a really high score, it could have been a little bit higher but we went for it.”\n\nThe camaraderie between Ross and fellow skier Paige Rini was palpable as they championed the Canadian spirit. Speaking about their shared journey and the future, Ross mentioned, “Paige and I have talked about it, we’ve known each other literally since before we were born. We’ve talked about our lives and how long we’ll be skiing for. She’s one of my best friends and we want to keep doing it for as long as we can. Definitely, there’s a new generation coming into the sport.”\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada is immensely proud of Ross’s accomplishments and commends her unwavering dedication to the sport.

Whatever happened, happened and we ended up on the podium.”\n\nNeilly added, “Same for me. We both knew what the podium score would be. After reaching that point, you really have to go for it.

She’ll be taking to the water in finals tomorrow, October 23, 2023.\n\nA prodigy in her own right, Santiago holds a special place in Neilly’s heart. “This place is awesome. It means so much to me because when I was 12, I competed in my first World Championships here. It’s the place where I made my first Worlds finals,” Ross reminisced about her journey. Today, she’s come full circle and is poised to make history yet again on the very waters where her international journey began.\n\nRoss spoke candidly after her trick prelims performance, “I’m very excited to have stood up, I’m into the finals and I’m ready to go for it tomorrow and go for the win.” Offering insight into her strategy, she mentioned, “In prelims, it’s a little bit of a different mindset than in finals. In prelims it’s a lot about slowing down a little bit. Making sure you stand up. I wanted to make sure I had some good feelings without trying to go super fast. I was a little bit slower than I wanted to but tomorrow we’ll go for it and be a bit quicker.”\n\nIn addition to her trick performance, Ross is also set to compete in the Slalom finals tomorrow. Speaking about juggling two high-intensity finals, Ross enthusiastically shared, “Tomorrow in finals, there’s going to be nerves but I’m going to go for it. You have to go for the gold in both, try to win in everything.”\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada is proud of Neilly Ross’s achievements and is excited to see her give her best in the finals.

This achievement shines even brighter given that it is Dorien’s second Pan American Games appearance.\n\nIn the 2019 Lima Pan Am Games, Dorien clinched gold in the men’s overall, silver in tricks, and bronze in jump. This year, he is accompanied by his Coach and father, Jaret Llewellyn, a renowned figure in the sport with 12 Pan Am Games medals under his belt.\n\nReflecting on his performance today, Dorien stated, “I’ve left a little bit to be desired in both Trick and in Jump.” Speaking about his Trick Prelims, he added, “I went out and stood up both my runs. That’s always the first objective as a trick skier – to stand up and make the finals.” Although currently sitting fourth in Tricks, Dorien remains optimistic. “I’m just on the outside looking in on the podium but it’s an awesome place to be for tomorrow because I get to go out there and put a score down. If I put out a big score, we never know what could happen.”\n\nDiscussing the jump prelims, Llewellyn shared, “I went out as the last skier. I haven’t had a ton of jump experience this year from crashing earlier in the year so there was still a little bit of those nerves, a little bit of butterflies.” He confidently adds, “I think I put myself in a good position to put out a big jump tomorrow in the finals.”\n\nDorien’s resilience shines through as he comments on his journey post-injury. “It’s been challenging for sure coming off of this injury. I’ve basically had a month of training leading up to this.” He continued, “The World Championships was a huge test and this is just another test. Coming to a site I haven’t been to in four years and still having some doubt about what’s the limitations of my body at the moment – it’s challenging. But, I’m going to go out there and give it my best.”\n\nThe highly anticipated Jump and Trick Finals are set to take place tomorrow, October 23, 2023.

The Canadian trio of Paige Rini, Neilly Ross, and Whitney McClintock Rini all tied with impressive scores of 2 buoys at 10.75m/39off.\n\nDue to a unique circumstance and the competition’s rules stating that only two athletes from one nation can progress into the finals, the three Canadian athletes were required to participate in a tension-filled run-off. After a showdown on the water, Rini and Ross emerged victorious, securing their esteemed places in the Women’s Slalom Finals.\n\nFans and supporters are eagerly awaiting the Women’s Slalom Finals set to take place on Monday, October 23, 2023.

Photo Credit: Johnny Hayward / COC\n\nCanada’s impressive showing at the 2023 Santiago Pan Am Games Women’s Slalom Prelims saw an unexpected twist today. Canadian athletes occupied three of the top four positions based on their high scores in the preliminary round.\n\nHowever, under the current regulations, only two athletes from any one country can progress to the finals. This rule meant that Paige Rini, Neilly Ross, and Whitney McClintock Rini, all having identical scores, had to face a run-off. In a surprising turn of events, the veteran skier McClintock Rini, boasting 14 Pan Am medals spanning four Pan Am Games, did not make it through to the finals. As a result, Ross and Rini secured their places in the Women Slalom Finals.\n\nWhitney McClintock Rini, who became a mother to her son Zane during the COVID pandemic and remarkably reclaimed her position as the second-ranked skier in the world, shared heartfelt sentiments after the competition. Reflecting on the pressures of the sport, she remarked, “There’s more pressure I think at this stage.” However, she remained optimistic about the future of the sport, noting, “I do believe that God has everything under control and I think Paige and Neilly have a huge future in the sport.”\n\nBalancing her disappointment with a broader perspective, McClintock Rini added, “I think life is way more than just sport, and I believe that’s what God’s trying to reveal to me through all of this.” Her recent challenges on the water, including a difficult World Championships just last week, have been a testament to the ups and downs that even the most accomplished athletes face, “Literally within seven days, I’ve had two of my worst tournaments of my career.”\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada remains proud of all its athletes, and we look forward to supporting Ross and Rini as they represent Canada in the finals. The resilience, skill, and passion displayed by our athletes are truly commendable and are indicative of the bright future Canadian water sports hold.\n\nAbout Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada:\n\nWater Ski and Wakeboard Canada (WSWC) is the national governing body for water skiing and wakeboarding in Canada.
