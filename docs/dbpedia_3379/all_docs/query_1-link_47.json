Elected by their peers, these new representatives will bring a fresh outlook and renewed energy to our mission. I am honored to have served as the President of this Commission along with so many outstanding colleagues and friends. We have taken so many strides to strengthen the voice of athletes throughout the Americas, and I know that this next group of leaders will continue to fight for more rights and representation for all athletes,” said Alexandra Orlando, President of the Panam Sports Athlete Commission."
