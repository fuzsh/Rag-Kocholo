        "text": "It’s the highest-profile triathlon in the world, and it comes around just once every four years (barring a global pandemic, of course). For some athletes, just being on the start list for the Paris 2024 Olympic triathlon will be the pinnacle of their career.\n\nThe qualification window closed in in May, and national federations and Olympic committees had until July 8 to make their final discretionary picks. For some national teams or new flag desginations, this was a straightforward process; others, like Team USA and Great Britain, faced tough decisions when deciding who would represent their country in the triathlon competition at the Paris Games. For every joyful addition to the team, there was a heartbreaking conversation with those who didn’t make the cut.\n\nNow, the final deadline for selection has passed, and we know how many slots each nation has for its men and women, who will be taking those slots, and the 16 teams lining up in the mixed relay event. Here’s who will be racing triathlon at the Paris Olympics this summer.\n\nFor up-to-the-minute coverage from the Games, be sure to visit our Paris Olympic triathlon 2024 news hub, full of everything from athlete profiles to course previews – and, of course, all the race coverage from France.\n\nSection divider\n\nHow does qualifying for the Paris Olympics work in triathlon?\n\nThe Olympic qualification criteria are not straightforward, and it’s been made more complicated still since the introduction of the mixed team relay in Tokyo.\n\nThe top line is that 55 places are on offer for the individual men’s and women’s events, with the number of relay teams fluctuating depending on who qualifies and how.\n\nThe main path to qualifying is through either a relay team (which guarantees your country two individual starting berths per gender) or by finishing high enough in the Olympic rankings. There are also additional places for new flag spots, awarded to individuals who are the highest-ranked athlete on each continent whose nation doesn’t already have a spot.\n\nAn important element is that while triathletes can qualify slots for their nations, it’s down to the individual Olympic committees to make the final selection on who actually fills those slots. That means an athlete ranked number-one worldwide could still miss out on a spot for the Paris Olympic Games if they’re not selected by their country.\n\nFederations’ selection policies regarding who gets the earned places are complicated, nuanced, and differ from country to country (for example, you can see Team USA’s process here, or the British team’s process here.). Some stipulate a specific placing in a certain race, while others use the rankings system. Many ultimately come down to a discretionary clause.\n\nHere’s the current situation of who has been selected to race the triathlon events at the Paris 2024 Olympics, which we’ll update as new discretionary picks are announced.\n\nSection divider\n\nSlot allocation by country, Paris 2024 Olympic triathlon events\n\nThe slot allocation for each country for the individual Olympic event is now confirmed as follows:\n\nElite women\n\n3 slots\n\nFrance\n\nGreat Britain\n\nGermany\n\nItaly\n\nUSA\n\n2 slots\n\nAustralia\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBermuda\n\nBrazil\n\nSpain\n\nMexico\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPortugal\n\nSwitzerland\n\n1 slot\n\nArgentina\n\nCanada\n\nChina\n\nColombia\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nEcuador\n\nGuam\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nJapan\n\nKazakhstan\n\nLuxembourg\n\nPoland\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSweden\n\nElite Men\n\n3 spots\n\nSpain\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\n2 spots\n\nAustralia\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBrazil\n\nCanada\n\nChile\n\nGreat Britain\n\nHungary\n\nItaly\n\nJapan\n\nMexico\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPortugal\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSwitzerland\n\nUSA\n\n1 slot\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nBarbados\n\nBermuda\n\nDenmark\n\nHong Kong\n\nIsrael\n\nMorocco\n\nRomania\n\nTogo\n\nMixed team relay\n\nThe 16 teams that will line up in the second Olympic mixed team relay are also confirmed. Countries either qualified through designated qualifying relay races or by having two women and two men qualified for the individual races.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBrazil\n\nFrance\n\nGreat Britain\n\nGermany\n\nItaly\n\nMexico\n\nNetherlands\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNorway\n\nPortugal\n\nSpain\n\nSwitzerland\n\nUSA\n\nNote: Athletes can only compete in the relay if they have an Olympic ranking of 140 or better. If a country cannot meet that requirement, it must forfeit its team’s spot.\n\nSection divider\n\nWho is racing Paris Olympic triathlon, by country (Updated 7/10/2024)\n\nNow, let’s look at how the individual nations are selecting their teams and when, plus who is already locked in.\n\nArgentina\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nRimona Biagioli\n\nBiagioli will be Argentina’s only representative after bagging the new flag sport for the Americas. A third place in last year’s sprint distance Americas Championships was pivotal, backed up by sixth at this year’s Americas champs over the standard distance, plus a third place in a continental cup in Vina del Mar. .\n\nAustralia (Updated 6/20/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nMatthew Hauser\n\nLuke Willian\n\nConfirmed additions (Updated 6/20/2024):\n\nNatalie Van Coevorden\n\nSophie Linn\n\nA jubilant Willian clinched his automatic individual qualification with third place at Yokohama WTCS, joining the already-chosen Hauser to represent Australia at the Paris Games.\n\nWith eight Australian women in the top 100 of the Olympic rankings, but none higher than 35th place, the ability to perform in the relay would have a big bearing on selection. The spots were eventually awarded to Van Coevorden and Linn, with the Hedgeland sisters Jaz and Kira missing out, along with Charlotte McShane and London 2012 eighth-place finisher Emma Jackson.\n\nAustria (Updated 7/10/2024):\n\nConfirmed additions (Updated 7/10/2024):\n\nAlois Knabl\n\nTjebbe Kaindl\n\nJulia Hauser\n\nLisa Perterer\n\nHauser and Perterer have long been the firm favorites to represent Austria, both have raced extensively in the past couple of years to earn their spots. Hauser’s highest scoring performance came through a second place at last year’s European Games in Poland, while Perterer also finished runner-up at a World Cup in China last August.\n\nKnabl is the highest-ranked Austrian man, with Kaindl gaining just enough points to earn his country an automatic start in the relay, a 10th place at a World Cup in Napier, New Zealand greatly helping his cause.\n\nThe Austrians have yet to confirm who will be making the trip to Paris, but Julia Hauser and Lisa Perterer should be safe as the women’s selections, both having raced extensively in the past couple of years to earn their spots.\n\nAlois Knabl is the highest-ranked Austrian man, with Tjebbe Kaindl gaining just enough points to earn his country an automatic start in the relay. Leon Pauger is the only other Austrian ranked within the top 100.\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nRostislav Pevtsov\n\nPevtsov will be the only Azerbaijiani triathlete in Paris, with no other triathlete from his nation even appearing in the Olympic rankings. Pevtsov will fly the flag for the third time at a Games, hoping to improve on his previous best finish of 39th in Rio.\n\nBarbados\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nMatthew Wright\n\nWright is one of the new flag qualifiers, having won the Americas Championships over the sprint distance in 2023 and making a return to WTCS racing in Cagliari (after an absence of nearly six years). He placed 41st.\n\nBelgium (Updated 6/11/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nJolien Vermeylen\n\nClaire Michel\n\nMarten Van Riel\n\nJelle Geens\n\nBelgium is another team that has locked in its triathlon team. Geens and Van Riel were a shoo-in for men’s selection, with impressive resumes that include a sixth and fourth place for Van Riel in the past two Olympics, and Geens with seven top-eight finishes on the World Series in the qualifying period for Paris.\n\nThe women’s line-up has also been confirmed, with the highest-ranked duo Jolien Vermeylen and Clare Michel taking the spots. The self-titled Belgium Hammers will be eyeing an outside chance at a relay medal, too.\n\nBermuda\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nTyler Smith\n\nFlora Duffy\n\nErica Hawley\n\nHawley will line up alongside reigning Olympic champion Duffy after her ranking was just high enough to sneak the Bermudians a second slot. Smith wins his spot through one of two universality places on offer designed to support smaller, emerging triathlon nations. His seventh-place finish at the 2023 Pan American Games proved decisive in securing his spot.\n\nBrazil\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nManoel Messias\n\nMiguel Hidalgo\n\nDjenyfer Arnold\n\nVittoria Lopes\n\nThe Brazilian team is another that is good to go after top-ten-ranked Hidalgo was picked to join Messias who qualified at the end of last year after two World Series podiums. The women’s selection was equally clear-cut after Arnold put in impressive performances in both Yokohama and Cagliari to join Lopes.\n\nSadly, 2019 Pan American Games champion Luisa Baptista, who would have been in contention, was the victim of a hit-and-run incident at the end of last year that left her hospitalized for more than three months, taking her out of contention for the Paris 2024 Games.\n\nCanada (Updated 6/19/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nCharles Paquet\n\nConfirmed additions (updated 6/19/2024):\n\nTyler Mislawchuk\n\nEmy Legault\n\nCanada missed out on the final chance to qualify a relay team after going off course and being disqualified in Huatulco. As a result, they will only send two men and one woman to the Games. Legault always looked the most likely pick, with Dominika Jamnicky her closest rival for the place. Paquet was assured of his spot after a seventh place in Yokohama and an impressive fifth in Cagliari and will be joined by the higher-ranked Mislawchuk. It will be Mislawchuk’s third Olympic appearance, hoping for a change in recent fortunes that saw him unable to finish in either Yokohama or Cagliari.\n\nChina (Updated 6/6/2024)\n\nConfirmed addition (updated 6/6/2024):\n\nXinyu Lin\n\nChina’s single starting spot for the women’s individual triathlon in Pari went to Xinyu Lin, who is ranked 45th and was second at an Asia Cup race in Hatsukaichi in April.\n\nChile\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nDiego Moya\n\nGaspar Riveros\n\nChile’s triathletes have performed well enough to secure two starting spots in the men’s race in Paris, which go to Moya and Riveros. Moya is the more accomplished of the two, with a podium result in a World Cup in Wollongong in April. No women make the grade, with 150th-ranked Macarena Salazar outside the ranking required.\n\nColombia\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nMaria Carolina Velasquez Soto\n\nVelasquez Soto will be the only Colombian triathlete in Paris. Her best recent result was an impressive fourth place in a World Cup in Wollongong in April, the venue for next year’s World Triathlon Championship Series grand final.\n\nCzechia\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nPetra Kurikova\n\nKurikova will be the one Czech triathlete racing in Paris as she heads to her second Olympics hoping to improve on 30th place from Tokyo. While Kurikova wasn’t able to finish in Cagliari WTCS, Tereza Zimovjanova also wasn’t able to press her own claims with 47th place. Ranked nine places higher, Kurikova got the better of her team-mate and rival in head-to-head racing in Samarkand, Uzbekistan the weekend before.\n\nDenmark\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nEmil Holm\n\nAlberte Kjær Pedersen\n\nWith one slot for each gender for the Danes, the in-form Pedersen won in Huatulco in mid-May. Emil Holm has been officially confirmed as the male representative, as the only Dane with a high enough ranking to be allowed to compete.\n\nEcuador\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nElizabeth Bravo\n\nBravo will be the only triathlete from Ecuador in Paris, with a fourth-place finish in a World Cup in Hong Kong last March as her highest finish to date.\n\nGermany\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nTim Hellwig\n\nLasse Lührs\n\nJonas Schomburg\n\nNina Eim\n\nLisa Tertsch\n\nLaura Lindemann\n\nThe Germans locked in a strong team early and left just one men’s spot open in the final weeks of qualification. A podium in Chengdu from Schomburg meant they would send their full quota of athletes to Paris.\n\nHaving won the mixed relay even at last year’s Paris test event, they may feel the team event presents their best chance of a medal since Jan Frodeno’s gold in Beijing 2008. However, Lindemann’s third place in the test event and Tertsch’s recent second place in Cagliari WTCS show they pose a threat to the individual race, too.\n\nFrance (Updated 6/5/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nPierre Le Corre\n\nCassandre Beaugrand\n\nConfirmed additions (updated 6/5/2024):\n\nLeo Bergere\n\nDorian Coninx\n\nEmma Lombardi\n\nIt’s no surprise that Cagliari WTCS winner Beaugrand was joined by Emma Lombardi when the French federation made its final selection on June 5th, but the men’s decision was far more difficult. Faith has been placed in reigning world champion Coninx’s recovery from a crash at WTCS Yokohama that resulted in a fractured wrist and elbow, and he will be joined by 2022 world champion Bergere and Le Corre, whose sixth place in Cagliari was just enough to secure automatic qualification. But controversially it means no place for 2019 and 2020 world champion Vincent Luis, who was looking to compete at a fourth Olympic Games and has been fighting back to fitness in 2024.\n\nGreat Britain\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nAlex Yee\n\nBeth Potter\n\nConfirmed additions (updated 6/19/2024):\n\nSam Dickinson\n\nGeorgia Taylor-Brown\n\nKate Waugh\n\nGreat Britain has spent years cultivating the next generation of triathletes, and it’s paying off. Yee secured his spot at the test event and Potter at the Pontevedra Grand Final in 2023. The final men’s spot with the mixed team relay in mind was between Jonny Brownlee, going for a fourth straight Olympic medal, and Sam Dickinson, with Dickinson just edging the call. Taylor-Brown was selected alongside Potter after a sixth place finish in Cagliari WTCS, but the final women’s spot became mired in an appeals process, the announcement delayed for nine days before it was eventually awarded to Waugh over Sophie Coldwell. Read more on the Team GB decision here.\n\nGuam\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nManami Iijima\n\nIijima will become Guam’s first Olympic triathlete by taking the new flag slot for Oceania. In the past year, she has won three silver medals at Asia Cup events, in Pokhara, Hong Kong and Kota Kinabalu. It represents a landmark sporting moment for the tiny U.S. island territory in Micronesia.\n\nHong Kong\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nJason Tai Long Ng\n\nNg just about held off Kazakhstan’s Ayan Beisenbayev to collect the Asian new flag spot despite his rival winning last year’s Asia Championships over the sprint distance in 2023 and earning the bronze medal at the Asian Games. Ng finished second at the same 2023 Asia Championships and fifth at the Asian Games but made up the points deficit with seventh place at the Weihai World Cup.\n\nHungary\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nCsongor Lehmann\n\nBence Bicsak\n\nZsanett Kuttor-Bragmayer\n\nHungary is one of the unluckiest nations when it comes to the Paris Games triathlon start list, missing out by one ranking place to secure the full quota of three men’s slots and then by one position in the final relay qualifier in Mexico. After results didn’t go their way in the Yokohama or Cagliari WTCS races, selectors were forced to choose between Bicsák and Márk Dévay for the men, with Bicsák getting the pick. As the only triathlete ranked inside the top 100, the lone Hungarian woman will be Kuttor-Bragmayer.\n\nIceland\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nEdda Hannesdottir\n\nHannesdottir will head to represent Iceland in Paris following strong performances in Asian and African Cups in 2024, including a win in Pokhara in April and a second place in Subic Bay in May, followed by a third place in Osaka. It was enough to earn her a spot on the Paris Games triathlon roster, making her the first triathlete from Iceland to start an Olympic triathlon.\n\nIsrael\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nShachar Sagiv\n\nSagiv has long been Israel’s leading male triathlete, and the 30-year-old will head to Paris for his second Olympics after finishing 20th in Tokyo. The Supertri favorite’s best recent result is a fourth place from Napier, New Zealand.\n\nItaly (Updated 6/6/2024)\n\nConfirmed additions (updated 6/6/2024):\n\nAlessio Crociani\n\nGianluca Pozzatti\n\nAlice Betto\n\nBianca Seregni\n\nVerena Steinhauser\n\nWhile they might not have any Olympic triathlon medals to show for it, Italy is one of the strongest triathlon nations, and will send five athletes to Paris. This includes the maximum three on the women’s side where Betto, Seregni, Steinhauser were picked ahead of Ilaria Zane. Betto was the lowest-ranked of the four, but was also returning to the sport as a new mom and finished just three places behind Seregni in Yokohama WTCS.\n\nPozzatti was within the top 40 of the Olympic rankings and not a surprise choice, with the second spot going to the fast-rising Crociani, who had wins in New Zealand and Italy this year and forced his way in ahead of the higher ranked Michele Sarzilla – who has to settle for being a reserve alongside Zane – and Nicola Azzano, who was the highest-placed Italian finisher in the most recent WTCS race in Cagliari.\n\nJapan (Updated 6/4/2024)\n\nConfirmed additions (6/4/2024):\n\nKenji Nener\n\nMakoto Odakura\n\nYuko Takahashi\n\nWith Japan unable to qualify as a relay team, Asian Games champion Yuko Takahashi has been confirmed as the sole female representative. The men’s line-up includes Kenji Nener, who was seventh in Yokohama WTCS, alongside Makoto Odakura, who grabbed the final available spot ahead of Takumi Hojo, Aoba Yasumatsu or Ren Sato. Odakura’s consistency ultimately won out with seven top 10 performances including three podiums in Olympic qualification points races.\n\nKazakhstan\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nEkaterina Shabalina\n\nLast year’s Asian champion Shabalina will represent Kazakhstan after seeing off Hong Kong’s Bailee Brown to claim the new flag slot for Asia. In the end, it was last year’s form, where Shabaline won two Continental Cups and placed fourth at the Asian Games that made the difference in selection.\n\nLuxembourg\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nJeanne Lehair\n\nHaving previously represented France, Lehair’s switch of allegiance has been altogether positive as she’s posted a string of good results en route to becoming European champion last year in Madrid. A fifth place in the recent Cagliari WTCS suggests she is peaking just at the right time for Paris, where she’ll be Luxembourg’s only triathlete.\n\nMexico (Updated 6/4/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nAram Michell Peñaflor Moysen\n\nRosa Maria Tapia Vidal\n\nLizeth Rueda Santos\n\nConfirmed addition (6/4/2024):\n\nCrisanto Grajales Valencia\n\nMexico’s final pick went to veteran Crisanto Grajales Valencia. The 37-year-old is not the threat he once was, but has enjoyed two victories in the Olympic qualifying period in a continental cup in Montevideo and a World Cup in Weihai. It will be Grajales fourth Olympic Games, with a 12th place in Rio being his best result. Also selected, Peñaflor Moysen achieved three World Cup podiums last year but has yet to break through on the WTCS.\n\nTapia Vidal is likely to be Mexico’s best chance of individual success. Her career highlight is a second place in last year’s Yokohama WTCS. Tapia Vidal is joined by Rueda Santos, who beat her into third place to win last year’s Pan American title in Santiago in November.\n\nMorocco\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nJawad Abdelmoula\n\nJawad Abdelmoula has a high-scoring third place from the Hamburg WTCS in 2022 to fall back on, along with becoming the African champion in the same year and achieving numerous World Cup podiums. Abdelmoula finished in 40th place in the Olympic rankings to secure his spot as the only Moroccan triathlete in Paris.\n\nNew Zealand (Updated 6/23/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nHayden Wilde\n\nConfirmed additions (Updated 6/23/2024):\n\nDylan McCullough\n\nNicole Van Der Kaay\n\nAinsley Thorpe\n\nWith Olympic bronze medallist Wilde assured of his place, McCullough was eventually given the second slot ahead of Tayler Reid, with his task in the individual event likely to be supporting Wilde on the bike leg. With a relay team qualified, the two women’s spots were awarded to Thorpe and Van Der Kaay as expected.\n\nNetherlands\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nMaya Kingma\n\nRachel Klamer\n\nRichard Murray\n\nMitch Kolkman\n\nKingma and Klamer are the two standout Dutch women, with Barbara De Koning a distant 112th in the Olympic rankings. They’ll be joined by Murray and Kolkman at the Games after the Netherlands secured their relay ranking spot in Mexico during a remarkable final-leg comeback in Huatulco. Kolkman also needed to race in the individual race in Huatulco to score enough points to force his way into the top 140 or the Netherlands would have to forfeit their relay spot. He achieved it with a ninth-place finish to move up to 126th.\n\nNorway (Updated 6/4/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nKristian Blummenfelt\n\nConfirmed additions 6/4/2024:\n\nVetle Thorn\n\nSolveig Løvseth\n\nLotte Miller\n\nUnlike Tokyo, where they just missed out, Norway managed to qualify a relay team at the last attempt for Paris, meaning two men and two women will go to the Games. Olympic champion Blummenfelt will not be joined by friend and training partner Gustav Iden, who has returned to long-course racing. Instead, the consistent Thorn was given the spot ahead of former Bermuda WTCS winner Casper Stornes, with Thorn’s fourth place in Cagliari WTCS sealing the selection.\n\nThe women’s duo are Solveig Løvseth and Lotte Miller, who will hope to take advantage of any slip-ups by more fancied nations in the relay.\n\nPoland (Updated 6/7/2024)\n\nConfirmed addition (Updated 6/7/2024):\n\nRoksana Slupek\n\nWith no men making the grade, the single woman’s spot for Poland has been awarded to Slupek ahead of the more experienced Paulina Klimas. Slupek has been on a run of eye-catching results including placing third, fourth and sixth at World Cups in 2024 and finishing 15th in Cagliari WTCS.\n\nPortugal\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nMaria Tomé\n\nMelanie Santos\n\nRicardo Batista\n\nVasco Vilaca\n\nPortugal will have new faces of Vilaca and Batista replacing the old guard of Joao Silva and Joao Periera in the men’s race. After finishing second in the Paris test event, Vilaca is a dark horse for a medal.\n\nTomé and Santos are unlikely to be a threat in the individual race, but they are head and shoulders above other Portuguese women, and Portugal nabbed the last relay ranking qualification spot in March, confirming their selection.\n\nRomania\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nFelix Duchampt\n\nDuchampt will take part in his second Olympics after finishing 36th in Tokyo. After a fifth place in a World Cup in Weihai last year, a win at an Americas Cup race in February in La Guaira followed by a second place at the Iquique Americas Cup was enough to secure the European new flag spot for the Romanian.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nHenri Schoeman\n\nJamie Riddle\n\nVicky Van Der Merwe\n\nSouth Africa missed out on competing in the mixed team relay after Riddle crashed out on the first leg of the final qualifier. But the young South African has competed well enough to be awarded the second slot alongside Rio bronze medallist Henri Schoeman for the individual race. Veteran Van Der Merwe claimed the new flag berth for Africa. Unbeaten on African soil in 2024, Van Der Mew’s successes have included wins at the African Games and defending her continental crown.\n\nSpain (Updated 6/6/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nAntonio Serrat Seoane\n\nConfirmed additions (updated 6/6/2024):\n\nAlberto Gonzalez Garcia\n\nRoberto Sanchez Mantecón\n\nMiriam Casillas Garcia\n\nAnna Godoy Contreras\n\nWith three men’s picks, top-ranked Serrat Seonane is joined on the starting pontoon by Gonzalez Garcia and Sanchez Mantecón, with Sergio Baxter Cabrera named as the reserve.\n\nThe two places on the women’s roster go to Casillas García and Godoy Contreras (who raced well in both Yokohama and Cagliari), with Noémia Juan as back-up.\n\nSweden\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nTilda Månsson\n\nCurrent situation:\n\nSweden was the thickness of a trisuit away from winning Olympic gold in Lisa Norden’s sprint finish at the London 2012 Games. This year, they’ll send just one triathlete to Paris. In Månsson they have one of the most exciting prospects in the triathlon world. The junior world champion from 2022 has already won three World Cups and is lightning-fast on the run.\n\nSwitzerland (Updated 6/6/2024)\n\nConfirmed additions (Updated 6/6/2024):\n\nAdrien Brifford\n\nMax Studer\n\nCathia Schar\n\nJulie Derron\n\nFor the first Olympics since Sydney 2000, there will be no Nicola Spirig in Swiss colors. But in Julie Derron and Cathia Schär, they have some high-caliber women ready to step up to the plate. Derron has the best record and form having won a World Cup in Chengdu in April. They will be joined by Adrien Briffod and Max Studer, although the latter is yet to race in 2024.\n\nTogo\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nEloi Adjavon\n\nAdjavon will represent Togo, having earned one of two men’s universality places alongside Bermuda’s Tyler Smith. It will be a big step up for 194th-ranked Adjavon, who placed fifth at the 2023 Africa Championships and has mainly raced on his home continent.\n\nUnited States of America (Updated 6/5/2024)\n\nAlready qualified:\n\nMorgan Pearson\n\nTaylor Knibb\n\nConfirmed additions (updated 6/5/2024):\n\nTaylor Spivey\n\nKirsten Kasper\n\nSeth Rider\n\nWith Knibb (fifth) and Pearson (sixth place) having secured their spots at last year’s test event, Yokohama was pinpointed as the final chance for non-discretionary selection. But no American athletes ended on the podium, so two women’s spots were at the discretion of USA Triathlon. Their picks: Taylor Spivey and Kirsten Kasper. On the men’s side, USAT had one discretionary pick, which they awarded to Seth Rider.
