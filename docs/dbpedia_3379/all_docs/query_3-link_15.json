        "text": "Rhythmic gymnastics as a sport began to take shape in the 19th century. Vocal teacher and stage art theorist from France – François Delsarte – believed that physical exercise plays an important role in maintaining balance, beauty, health, and success.\n\nThe usefulness of Delsarte’s “expression system” was to improve the performance of vocal and theatrical productions and dances. His ideas about aesthetics and movement formed the core principle of modern gymnastics expression through movement.\n\nIn 1896, gymnastics appeared in the program of the first Olympic Games, which included swinging the mace and climbing the rope. In 1903, seven years later, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) organized the first world championship open to men only. Competitions for female gymnasts were added to the program in 1934. However, as early as 1928, female gymnasts could take part in the Olympic team competitions.\n\nIn 1963, the FIG officially recognized rhythmic gymnastics as a sport. The first World Championship in this type of gymnastics took place in the same year. In 1984, rhythmic gymnastics was included in the program of the Olympics, where only individual performances were presented. In 1996, 12 years later, teams in group exercises were included in the programs of the largest complex sports competitions in the world.\n\nCanada has strong gymnasts in both rhythmic and artistic disciplines. For the first time, gymnasts from Canada performed at the Olympic Games, which took place in 1908. Then only men took part in personal all-around and team competitions.\n\nCanadian athletes have competed in every Olympic Games since 1956. In the same year, gymnastics has returned to the Olympics with competitions for both men and women.\n\nAs for the participation of gymnasts from Canada in other competitions, Alexandra Orlando won six gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, 2006. This made her Canada’s most titled female athlete at those Games. In 2012, Canada’s senior group of gymnasts became the country’s first group to compete in the Olympics, finishing 11th in the qualifying rounds. The team entered the history of rhythmic gymnastics in Canada.\n\nYoung Canadian medalist Laurie Fang was born in Vancouver, Canada, in 1963. In the 70s, the girl began to do rhythmic gymnastics. In 1982, Laura had already become the champion of Canada.\n\nIn 1980, Laura Fang missed the Olympic Games, like many athletes from other countries, due to the boycott of the Olympic Games in Moscow. However, already in 1984, at the competitions in Los Angeles, Laura Fang, a 21-year-old Canadian gymnast, won the gold medal."
