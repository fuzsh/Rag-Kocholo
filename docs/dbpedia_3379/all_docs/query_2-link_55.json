        "text": "Franchesca Santi\n\nThe Pan American Games get underway today in Santiago, Chile, and now that we finally have the complete lists of all athletes attending, we are happy to share everything you’ll need to follow along over the next week.\n\nWhat’s at Stake?\n\nIn addition to the usual medals and other accolades available to the athletes competing at this major continental Games, there’s an added element of excitement here as two athletes – one WAG and one MAG – will earn berths to next year’s Olympic Games!\n\nWhile the rest of the continental berths won’t be available until the 2024 season, the Pan American federation was able to get permission from the FIG to use this year’s Games as the qualifier so they won’t have to organize yet another continental meet next spring after hosting two this year. Though this continental meet happens out of order in terms of how spots are awarded – it’s supposed to be apparatus world cups first, then continental meets) and these continental spots here won’t become official until after the world cups end next year, we’ll still unofficially know the recipients of these berths this week.\n\nTo earn the spot, the athlete must be the highest-ranked eligible individual based on the all-around final competition, which happens on Monday. Eligible here just means that they can’t have either previously qualified as an individual, or their nation can’t have qualified a full team, which currently rules out anyone who qualified at worlds last year or this year.\n\nWho’s Competing?\n\nPlease see below for the complete lists of athletes who are expected to attend.\n\nARGENTINA Santiago Agostinelli\n\nLuca Alfieri\n\nJulian Jato\n\nSantiago Mayol\n\nDaniel Villafañe Milagros Curti\n\nLucila Estarli\n\nNicole Iribarne\n\nLeila Martinez\n\nMeline Mesropian BARBADOS Anya Pilgrim BOLIVIA Oliver Sons Diana Vasquez BRAZIL Yuri Guimarães\n\nArthur Mariano\n\nBernardo Miranda\n\nPatrick Sampaio\n\nDiogo Soares Rebeca Andrade\n\nJade Barbosa\n\nCarolyne Pedro\n\nFlavia Saraiva\n\nJulia Soares CANADA Zachary Clay\n\nRené Cournoyer\n\nFélix Dolci\n\nWilliam Emard\n\nJayson Rampersad Cassie Lee\n\nFrédérique Sgarbossa\n\nAva Stewart\n\nAurélie Tran\n\nSydney Turner CHILE Joel Alvarez\n\nJosue Armijo\n\nLuciano Letelier\n\nCristobal Prado\n\nIgnacio Varas Barbara Achondo\n\nSofia Casella\n\nAntonia Marihuan\n\nMakarena Pinto\n\nFranchesca Santi COLOMBIA Kristopher Bohorquez\n\nDilan Jimenez\n\nJuan Larrahondo\n\nAndres Martinez\n\nSergio Vargas Luisa Blanco\n\nGinna Escobar\n\nDaira Lamadrid\n\nAngélica Mesa\n\nYiseth Valenzuela COSTA RICA Andres Valverde Franciny Morales\n\nAnelena Rodriguez CUBA Alejandro de la Cruz\n\nJosé Escandón\n\nDiorges Escobar\n\nPablo Pozo\n\nYohendry Villaverde DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Audrys Nin Reyes\n\nLeandro Peña Camil Betances\n\nAna Fuentes ECUADOR Cesar Lopez\n\nJohnny Valencia Ashley Bohorquez\n\nAlais Perea EL SALVADOR Pablo Velasquez Alexa Grande GUATEMALA Jorge Vega HAITI Lynnzee Brown JAMAICA Caleb Faulk Tyesha Mattis MEXICO Fabian de Luna\n\nRodrigo Gomez\n\nJosue Juarez\n\nIsaac Nuñez\n\nAlonso Perez Paulina Campos\n\nNatalia Escalera\n\nCassandra Loustalot\n\nAlexa Moreno\n\nAhtziri Sandoval PANAMA Richard Atencio Valentina Brostella\n\nHillary Heron\n\nLana Herrera\n\nCelia Kuriakuz\n\nKarla Navas PERU Edward Alarcon\n\nEdward Gonzales Ana Karina Mendez PUERTO RICO Nelson Guilbe\n\nJose Lopez\n\nAndres Perez Alejandra Alvarez\n\nKarelys Diaz\n\nStella Diaz\n\nAinhoa Herrero\n\nKatyna Alicea TRINIDAD & TOBAGO Jameel Ali Annalise Newman-Achee UNITED STATES Cameron Bock\n\nStephen Nedoroscik\n\nVahe Petrosyan*\n\nCurran Phillips\n\nColt Walker\n\nDonnell Whittenburg Jordan Chiles\n\nKayla DiCello\n\nKatelyn Jong*\n\nKaliya Lincoln\n\nZoe Miller\n\nTiana Sumanasekera VENEZUELA Edward Rolin\n\nAdickxon Trejo Milca Leon\n\nDeborah Salmina\n\n*Competing individually\n\nWhen’s it Happening?\n\nSee below for the complete schedule.
