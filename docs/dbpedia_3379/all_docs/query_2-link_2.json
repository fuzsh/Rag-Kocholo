Each of these almost 500 athletes comes with their own story and objectives, united by sport and all the values that we hold dear, that we share and that define us. With the full team now named and just over a week to go until the Opening Ceremony, I’m counting down the days until I’m on the ground in Santiago alongside them to support and cheer them on! Be ready to live sport achievements that will become part of Canadian sport history!”\n\n– Olympic and Pan American champion Christine Girard, Team Canada’s Santiago 2023 Chef de Mission\n\n“We are incredibly proud of this group of athletes that will represent Canada at Santiago 2023. These Games are special as they offer each athlete something different – whether it’s the opportunity to qualify your country for the next Olympic Games, to gain valuable experience or to shine a light on sports that don’t often get the opportunity to compete in major Games. It’s an amazing showcase for the place sport holds in the hearts and minds of Canadians and I look forward to seeing how these athletes will inspire us as momentum builds towards Paris 2024.”\n\n– Eric Myles, COC Chief Sport Officer\n\n“On behalf of the Government of Canada, congratulations to all the athletes, coaches and support staff representing Canada at the Santiago 2023 Pan American Games. You are a great source of pride and inspiration to all Canadians to pursue their dreams. Team Canada’s success is the result of the tireless efforts of hundreds of athletes and their coaches, the National Sport and Multisport Service Organizations, and Canadian Sport Centres. The entire country, from coast to coast to coast, will be cheering you on as you compete. Go Canada Go!”\n\n– The Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Sport and Physical Activity\n\nSANTIAGO 2023 CANADIAN FACTS AND FIGURES\n\nAthletes who identify as female or are competing in women’s events: 265\n\nYoungest: Fay De Fazio Ebert, 13 (November 19, 2009), skateboarding\n\nOldest: Beth Underhill, 61 (September 5, 1962), equestrian – jumping\n\nAthletes who identify as male or are competing in men’s events: 208\n\nYoungest: Nicholas Zhang, 17 (June 20, 2006), fencing\n\nOldest: Mario Deslauriers, 58 (February 23, 1965), equestrian – jumping\n\nProvincial and territorial breakdown (by hometown):\n\nAlberta – 45\n\nBritish Columbia – 109\n\nManitoba – 7\n\nNew Brunswick – 2\n\nNova Scotia – 13\n\nOntario – 162\n\nPrince Edward Island – 3\n\nQuebec – 102\n\nSaskatchewan – 11\n\nAthletes with hometowns outside Canada: 15\n\nOlympians: 100\n\nPan American Games medallists: 106\n\nOlympic medallists: 14\n\nMost Pan American Games: 5 previous appearances– Gregory Sych, shooting (2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019)\n\nFurthest back Pan Am Games appearance – Beth Underhill, 1991 (equestrian – jumping)\n\nThere are 21 sports/disciplines that will have Olympic quota spots up for grabs at Santiago 2023.
