        "text": "We’re going global – with our new partner 4GLOBAL PLC! They’re joining our Open Ice team to help us develop a new technology platform to analyze and leverage data about ice use in rinks across Canada for good, so we can make ice sports more accessible to everyone. The team at 4Global is not just the best in the world at what they do – they also share our values and mission to create equity in the game. 4Global acknowledges the power of sport to transform lives and sees their purpose as finding new and exciting ways to get people active through the intelligent use of data from across the sector. As their Partnership Director, Steve Mann, tells us, “We’re big believers in the health and social benefits of sport and think that hockey should be for everyone. But too many people remain shut out of the game because they can’t get on the ice. That’s why we’re thrilled to partner with the FHL to use our breakthrough technology to find new ways to improve equity and efficiency in ice access and management across Canada. All the data in the world has no value unless it’s accessible and, ultimately, actionable.” As a systems-level solution to the ice access problem, Open Ice create benefits for everyone: - Ensure that everyone who wants to skate gets the opportunity. - Grow participation in ice sports and recreational programming. - Improve community wellness. - Make better use of ice facilities.

We are currently onboarding sport organizations and, once again, the array of activities we will have on offer is heartwarming. (The breadth of sports and activities available in our region still amazes me.) We are happy to have 3 adapted sports join our event thanks to long time participants Wolverines Adapted Sports Association and including the new Volt Hockey program that is launching in the new year. If you don't know, our Winter Try-It Day and Try-It Day events serve a twofold purpose. First, the allow youth ages 6-17 to explore & experience new activities. It allows them to get a feel for the sport prior to deciding if they want to sign up for a full season. It also allows parents to see how the clubs & programs are run while determining if it is a good fit for their offspring. Secondly, it allows our sport organizations to showcase what they have to offer. It is their chance to shine. Registration is set to open on January 18 at 7am. Visit the event page to see all the details including registration links, an up-to-date list of activities, sponsors and (closer to the event) a schedule at https://lnkd.in/gqHPGPGH\n\nIn the last 10 years, I've dived deep into the world of registration systems. From evaluating the most basic platforms to engaging with the most sophisticated solutions, I've seen it all. Each system was born from the idea that it could outperform its predecessors, yet they all face a common challenge: keeping pace with the user experience standards set by giants like Amazon, Apple, and Netflix. Why does this matter? In the world of youth sports, where I've dedicated over two decades of my life, the expectations of parents and participants are shaped by their daily interactions with these tech behemoths. They're accustomed to seamless, intuitive experiences. When they encounter a registration system that's anything but, frustration is inevitable. But here's the thing - it's not just about avoiding frustration. It's about embracing the opportunity to set a new standard in our niche. The right registration system can transform the user experience, making it a powerful tool in the growth and management of youth sports organizations. As we navigate this ever-evolving landscape, I encourage my fellow youth sports executives to consider not just the functionality, but the user experience of the registration platforms we choose. It's a pivotal component of our service that can significantly impact participant satisfaction and retention. What are your thoughts on this? Have you encountered a registration system that truly understands the modern user's expectations? Let's discuss the future of registration systems in the context of user experience excellence. #YouthSports #RegistrationSystems #UserExperience #InnovationInSports\n\nPlay Well Reflection: Sport Participation – the value behind the count. The sports industry needs to move beyond simply counting participants, coaches, officials, and volunteers involved in community sport. Instead, we need to examine and measure the impact of involvement in sport on individuals, communities, and Australian society. By understanding and articulating sport's effect on physical and mental health, community cohesion, and economic prosperity, we can demonstrate the true value of sport. Rather than just focusing on numbers, let's highlight the transformative power of participation. Community sport promotes physical well-being, mental resilience, social cohesion, and drives local and national economic growth. By emphasising these impacts, we can build support for prioritising and investing in community sports initiatives. It's about recognising the invaluable role of community sport in enriching lives and strengthening our society.

On 16 September, 2023, a special event took place, resonating with the memory of a beloved figure, Anto Ćavar, and echoing the values of inclusivity and athleticism. The Multiplier Sports Event stood as a testament to the unyielding spirit of the human endeavor, transcending limitations and fostering unity. #csrforparasport Institut za društveno odgovorno poslovanje - The Croatian Institute for CSR Magyar Paralimpiai Csapat Paraolimpijac Šport invalidov Slovenský paralympijský výbor #csr #csr4parasport #parasport #inclusivity #inclusive #equality #integrity *Funded by the European Union.

The basic idea is to ditch the idea of a host city and go towards something like a host country. One advantage of this would be that you could use only existing infrastructures and eliminate new constructions, which is a great idea. This could only work in smaller and highly developed countries, and especially those with existing, reliable, and high quality transport. So in that sense, the Swiss bid might have something here. On the other hand, they say they'll have to build at least one new venue, which raises eyebrows. Research shows that once a bid is won, all bets are off. The gates can be opened for any number of expensive interventions, and no one can stop it because \"the Games must go on.\" Also problematic is the fact that so many slopes here rely on artificial snow. This is another warning that we as a species really can't continue business as usual. And then there are the security costs, which aren't mentioned in this article, but which are always huge and tend to be borne by the public. In all, is this the right time and place to be planning a global party? Even in a wealthy country with almost enough existing infrastructure, should we pretend that there aren't more pressing issues to deal with? And should we pretend that \"sustainable Games\" are even possible? I'm grateful to participate in this debate (thank you Anand Chandrasekhar), and I hope that the Swiss public are given a chance to make their voices heard. And it would be amazing if the high percentage of residents who do not have traditional voting rights could also participate, since they live here and pay taxes too. https://lnkd.in/es8whzB3"
