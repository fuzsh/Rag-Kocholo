And while the Israeli delegation brings many talented Jewish athletes to the international arena, so too do several other national teams – and we’ve found them all so you don’t have to.\n\nAustralia\n\nAt least seven Jewish athletes are competing for Australia in the Olympics, one of whom has already won gold less than a week into the Games.
