        "text": "Alex Martins, who has spent 33 years in professional sports management and rejoined the Magic in June 2005, was promoted to chief executive officer on December 7, 2011. He previously served as president for more than one year and was the team’s chief operating officer from 2006-10. Martins also serves as CEO of SED Development, LLC, an affiliate of the Magic which is currently planning an entertainment mixed use development across Church Street from the Kia Center. Martins represents the Magic as the team’s alternate governor to the NBA Board of Governors, as well as managing partner of the Lakeland Magic, Orlando’s affiliate in the NBA G League. Martins is a member of the NBA’s Team Media Advisory Committee, Labor Relations Advisory Committee and Business & Basketball Committee, as well as having served on the NBA’s Season Restart Committee which has advised the league on the return to play from the COVID-19 hiatus. Martins, who served in various senior-level management capacities with the Magic between 1989-98 and as the organization’s executive vice president of marketing and franchise relations in 2005-06, oversees all operations of the club. During the past 14 years, Martins led the Magic in a transformation of its business operations, while overseeing a ticket sales, premium sales and corporate partnership effort which saw the most successful business year in the history of the franchise in the 2010-11 season. The transformation process received the recognition of the SportsBusiness Journal which named the Magic as a finalist for Professional Sports Team of the Year, the only NBA team to be named a finalist that year. Similarly, Martins has spearheaded the transformation of the current Magic basketball operations department, with the hiring and management of the current basketball administration leadership. Included in the franchise’s success has been the largest season ticket base in franchise history in 2010-11(14,200) and the most successful corporate sales effort in franchise history in 2014-15. Amongst these records are the largest increase in attendance in the NBA over that five-year period. Martins was instrumental in helping to secure the new state-of-the-art Kia Center in Orlando. The Kia Center is part of a public community venues program that also includes a new Performing Arts Center and a renovation of the Citrus Bowl Stadium. The new Amway Center opened in October 2010 and is now named Kia Center. The facility was named a finalist for the SportsBusiness Journal’s Sports Facility of the Year Award for two consecutive years and captured the award in 2012. Additionally, the Magic also contributed $20 million toward and constructed five community recreation centers throughout Orange County, Florida, as part of its commitment to build the new Kia Center. The Kia Center was also honored in 2013 with the Customer Experience Award during TheStadiumBusiness Awards presentation held in association with TheStadiumBusiness Summit in Manchester, England. At the annual NBA Sales and Marketing Meetings, the Magic organization has been awarded the “New Full Season Ticket Award” twice for being No. 1 in the NBA in new full season tickets sold, a “90 Percent Renewal Award” for being just one of five teams to achieve a 90 percent or higher season ticket renewal rate in 2007, a “Sponsorship Account Performance Award” for the extraordinary number of accounts secured by the global partnerships department and the “Retailer of the Year Award” twice, for the team’s retail sales performance. The team has currently led the NBA in group ticket sales for four consecutive seasons. Martins originally joined the Magic as director of publicity/media relations in April 1989. In September of 1996, he was promoted to senior director of communications. He also previously served as the Chairman of the Board of the Magic Action Team Community Fund. The Magic Action Team Fund developed into the Orlando Magic Youth Foundation, which has distributed nearly $25 million to local nonprofit organizations during the last 30 years, including more than $1 million last season. Additionally, Martins served on the developmental board of the DeVos Sport Business Management Program at the University of Central Florida. The program has been funded through a $9 million endowment by Rich and Helen DeVos and awards dual Masters degrees in Sport Management and Business Administration. Martins also has served as the senior vice president of marketing and branding for the NBA’s New Orleans Hornets, vice president of communications and public affairs with the NFL’s Cleveland Browns and vice president of sports ventures with the Tavistock Group. At Tavistock, Martins served as tournament director of The Tavistock Cup, a PGA Tour-sanctioned event. Martins started his career as a student assistant in the Villanova sports information department, assisted in the Philadelphia 76ers public relations department and was also the assistant sports information director at Georgetown University (1988-89). Martins currently serves as the Vice Chair to the University of Central Florida Board of Trustees, also serving as Chair of the Finance and Facilities Committee. He is also past chairman of the Metro Orlando Economic Development Commission and The Central Florida Partnership, as well as past chairman of the Orlando Community Construction Corporation, the entity responsible for the construction of the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Martins also has served on the board of directors of the Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau and the Central Florida Commission on Homeless. He currently serves on the Central Florida board of directors for Seaside National Bank & Trust, and is the Chairman of the Governor’s Council of the Orlando Economic Partnership. In April 2015, Martins received the James B. Greene Economic Development Award, which is the highest honor bestowed by the Orlando Economic Development Commission, and recognizes an individual whose work has contributed substantially to the economic prosperity of the region. In 2013, he was awarded the Charles Andrews Memorial Hospitality Award for Community Leadership by the Central Florida Hotel and Lodging Association. The award is CFHLA’s highest honor recognizing an individual’s achievements and contributions to the Central Florida hospitality industry as well as the community at large. Following the tragedy at Pulse nightclub in June 2016, Martins was chosen by the City of Orlando to Chair the board of directors for the largest fund for victims of the shooting, the city-sponsored OneOrlando fund. Martins earned his MBA from the University of Central Florida, where he is a member of the College of Business Administration’s Hall of Fame and recipient of University’s Distinguished Alumnus Award. He also serves on the Dean’s Executive Council for the College of Business Administration at UCF, and was honored with the opportunity to serve as Commencement Speaker at UCF in August 2008. A native of Kearny, New Jersey, Martins earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from Villanova, where he graduated from in 1986. He resides in Winter Park, Fla., with his wife, Juliet, and daughters,Sophia (16) and Gabrielle (14)."
