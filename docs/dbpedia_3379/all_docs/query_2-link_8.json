        "text": "With the action underway at Santiago 2023, Olympics.com brings you the list of the most decorated athletes in the history of the Pan American Games.\n\nThe medal event begin on 21 October with stars from across North, Central, and South America as well as the Caribbean all vying for podium positions and spots at the Olympic Games Paris 2024.\n\nSince the first edition of the Games in 1951, there are many athletes who have excelled in the competition and - at the same time - written their names in history.\n\nOne such example is Brazilian swimmer Thiago Pereira who achieved the record for most medals at the Games, with 23 won across four editions: Santo Domingo 2003, Rio 2007, Guadalajara 2011 and Toronto 2015. It isn’t by a coincidence that Pereira earned the nickname “Mister Pan”.\n\n“I'd come away from a test and ask, 'What's next?' I focused on every race, elimination round, and semifinal. Regardless of how tired I was, I had to face each test. I couldn't settle on anything, otherwise it would all get mixed up in my head. It was a big challenge,” Pereira said to GE after retiring in 2017, about the quest for the record.\n\nPereira also made a name for himself at the Olympics, with silver in the 400m individual medley at London 2012, as well as three podium finishes at the World Aquatics Championships.\n\nPan American Games Santiago 2023: Preview, schedule, mascot, stars involved, and how to watch live action\n\nPan American Games Santiago 2023: Top stars to watch\n\nPan American Games 2023: A pathway to the Olympic Games Paris 2024\n\nPan American Games Santiago 2023: Did you know... fun facts about the multi-sport event\n\nEric Lopez: the greatest Pan American champion?\n\nDespite being the athlete with the most medals at the Pan American Games, Pereira perhaps would not be considered the greatest Pan American Champion. That accolade goes to Cuba’s Eric Lopez, an artistic gymnast who won 18 gold medals, three more than the Brazilian. In all, Lopez stood on the podium on 22 occasions.\n\nLopez’s reign began as an 18-year-old at Havana 1991 and continued through to Santo Domingo 2003 where he won six medals aged 31.\n\n“The only thing missing was an Olympic medal. It was a dream that I didn't achieve,” Lopez told newspaper O Globo during the Pan American Games in Rio in 2007.\n\nOne other case of interest is American gymnast John Beckner, who competed in the 1950s. He does not appear on the list of the 10 greatest medalists in history, but his success rate was impeccable: out of 17 medals, 15 were gold."
