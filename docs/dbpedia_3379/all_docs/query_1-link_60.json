        "text": "ATHLETE LEADERS ARRIVE IN MIAMI FOR PANAM SPORTS ATHLETE FORUM\n\nPanam Sports welcomes incredible athletes and sport leaders from not only the 41 countries of the Panam Sports family, but from around the globe to the second edition of the Athlete Forum of the Americas in Miami, USA.\n\nWith support and assistance from the Olympic Solidarity team at the International Olympic Committee, the Panam Sports Athlete Commission has put together a comprehensive three-day program to engage athlete leaders from throughout the world in a conversation about the topics and issues most important to them.\n\nBeginning on Friday, October 26 on the beach in Miami, the second edition of the Panam Sports Athlete Forum gives the athlete leaders an opportunity to not only learn and share best practices about how to improve sport and develop as an athlete, but also explore one of the United States’ top beach destinations.\n\nPanam Sports has organized a series of activities to ensure the athletes can socialize as they learn from one another. Team activities on famous South Beach will bring together the likes of Olympic and Pan American Games gold medalists Ruben Limardo of Venezuela and William Dean of Canada, as well as Athlete Commission leaders in their own countries and rising stars.\n\nAlthough the majority of the more than 75 athlete leaders attending the Forum are representing the NOCs of the Americas, Panam Sports is proud to welcome the Vice President of the IOC Athletes Commission, Danka Bartekova, as well as Paralympian and Member of the Athlete Council of the International Paralympic Committee Monica Bascio, and all the sport leaders who have traveled to Miami to participate in the Forum.\n\nPanam Sports Athlete Commission President Alexandra Orlando and AC Members Andrea Estrada, Aliann Pompey and Carlos Santiago will lead thoughtful discussions and exercises throughout the Forum as athletes seek to make a positive impact on the ways sport is developed throughout the world and the rights and expectations of athletes.\n\n“I’m incredibly excited to begin our second Panam Sports Athlete Forum with such an unbelievable group of leaders and ambassadors of sport. We’re going to dive into some of the biggest issues facing us as athletes and discuss ways to shift the status quo so that the voice of the athlete is not just heard, but valued,” said Panam Sports Athlete Commission President, Alexandra Orlando.\n\nThe Forum will include a series of panels and breakout sessions on topics including Commission Activities, Building a Strategic Plan, the Pan American Games, Athlete Resources, Clean Sport, Marketing and Career Development.\n\nPanam Sports President, Neven Ilic, will open the Forum on Friday morning, emphasizing Panam Sports’ renewed focus on athlete development and preparation.\n\n“We could not be more proud to host many of the top athlete leaders from our continent and the world at our second Athlete Forum of the Americas. The Forum is the best opportunity other than the Pan American Games for our athletes to meet one another, learn from everyone’s unique experiences and develop common goals to improve conditions for athletes in all areas of life. I hope all of the athletes leave the Forum with even more passion and inspiration to further the mission of athletes throughout the world,” President Ilic said."
