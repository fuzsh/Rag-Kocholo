Her musical studies led her to Paris, where she studied musicology at La Sorbonne, voice with Sophie Marin-Degor, and choral conducting at the Conservatoire d'Aubervilliers-La Courneuve with Catherine Simonpietri.\n\nMariette Wilson then moved across the ocean to Florida, USA, where she further studied choral conducting with Dr. Richard Zielinski and Dr. Robert Summer, and voice with Prof. Annetta Monroe. After obtaining a Master's degree in choral conducting and vocal performance, she returned to France, in Lyon, where she has since been conducting a variety of choirs and continued deepening her understanding of vocal technique.\n\nIn 2012 she created Les Chantiers Musicaux, a school of music based in Lyon, where she teaches vocal technique for adults, with her personal approach, that combines her American experience and her practice of yoga, where singing is not only a musical action but also an expression of the whole being.\n\nMs. Wilson's philosophy also includes using music as a means for service, and she has been developing various social projects to create bonding between populations that are otherwise separate, by teaching and performing with her groups in prisons, homeless shelters, retirement homes, medical centers for the blind or disabled people.\n\nShe is regularly called upon to teach voice workshops with various choirs in the region, where she also performs as a soprano solo.\n\nMariette Wilson was a member of the international jury at the 2021 World Choir Games.\n\nShe recently started working at the Lyon auditorium where she gives voice workshops for the general public.\n\nFrance\n\nJean-Baptiste Bertrand\n\nJean-Baptiste Bertrand\n\nFrance\n\nArtistic and pedagogic director of \"Maîtrise de la Loire\" (Public choir school)\n\nTeacher of choral-conducting at the National Conservatory of Saint-Etienne\n\nPast artistic director of the \"In Terra Pax Singer's\" (Poland) and the \"Saint-Etienne University's Choir\" (France)\n\nHe is invited as choir expert at international choral festivals and competitions and collaborated as conductor with many international artistic ensembles.\n\nHe is a member of the artistic board of the \"London International Choir Festival\" (UK)\n\nGermany\n\nThomas Kreiling\n\nThomas Kreiling\n\nGermany\n\nGermany\n\nTristan Meister\n\nTristan Meister\n\nGermany\n\nRegional Committee\n\nTristan is a freelance conductor based in Mannheim, in the South-West of Germany. He is really glad to have the opportunity of working with choirs of very different styles, ages and repertoire, including the male chamber choir Ensemble Vocapella Limburg, the semi-professional choir Vox Quadrata or the philharmonic choir Beethovenchor Ludwigshafen. Tristan loves the very important work with young voices and singers: He's the artistic director of the boy's and male section of Cantus Juvenum Karlsruhe and of the Jugendchor Hochtaunus, a mixed youthchoir, which is regularly invited to nationwide festivals. A big part of his profession is also the work as a conducting teacher at the University of Music in Frankfurt am Main, where he's trying to help young musicians finding their way and style of musical expression and transferring it to the singers in their choir. So nearly all of his work is about connecting music loving people and that's why he is really looking forward to bring these experiences to the World Choir Council and to learn from the great colleagues from all over the world.\n\nGermany\n\nDonka Miteva\n\nDonka Miteva\n\nGermany\n\nStudied choral conducting at the State Academy of Music in Sofia (Bulgaria) and orchestra conducting at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in Düsseldorf (Germany)\n\nFrom 2007-2011 conductor and Choir Director at the Staatsoper Münster (Germany)\n\nSince 2011 Artistic Director and conductor of Collegium Musicum Berlin at the Free and Technical Universities in Berlin\n\nRecipient of several conducting prizes in Münster in 2011 and St. Petersburg in 2013\n\nGermany\n\nJürgen Faßbender\n\nJürgen Faßbender\n\nGermany\n\nFirst prize winner at numerous international choir competitions\n\nRepeated Prize Winner of the German Choir Competition\n\nEditor of \"Reine Männersache\", \"Reine Frauensache\" Edition Peters\n\nInternational juror, lecturer and guest conductor\n\nGermany\n\nJürgen Budday\n\nJürgen Budday\n\nGermany\n\nFounder and Artistic Director of the Maulbronn Chamber Choir and the Kantorei Maulbronn (until 2016) and from 1979 until 2013 Artistic Director of the Festival Klosterkonzerte Maulbronn Maulbronn (UNESCO world heritage)\n\nRecorded more than 20 CDs with the Maulbronn Chamber Choir, including 10 oratorios by G.F.
