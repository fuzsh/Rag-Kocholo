        "text": "MIAMI (WSVN) - Brightline and Special Olympics Florida celebrated the send-off of approximately 180 Special Olympics athletes and their families as they embarked on their journey to the Special Olympics Florida State Summer Games.\n\n“They train for a minimum of 10 weeks before regional games and then those who qualify continue training for state games, so this is just something they’ve really poured a lot of energy into,” said Linsey Harris Smith, the Chief Development and Marketing Officer at Special Olympics Florida.\n\nThe event took place at the Brightline MiamiCentral Station, where athletes gathered alongside representatives from Special Olympics Florida and Brightline. The athletes, along with coaches and volunteers, are set to travel to Orlando for the games. Brightline will also transport athletes from Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach.\n\n“I am ready to compete in my three events and to have fun and to work hard like I always train and get better at it,” said Alien Figueroa, an athlete.\n\nThe State Summer Games, the largest event on the Special Olympics Florida sports calendar, will feature more than 2,300 athletes from across the state competing in seven different sports over the weekend at the ESPN World of Sports.\n\n“Being able to bond with the team, being able to showcase talent, being able to meet new friends, new people, being able to take in the moment all together, that’s the most exciting part of all of this,” said Ricky Dager, an athlete.\n\nJust last month, over 600 athletes competed in the Special Olympics Florida’s South Region Track and Field event for a chance to move on to the state stage.\n\n“For many of these athletes, it’s the first time they’re actually leaving Miami-Dade County,” said Smith. “To be able to travel by Brightline and to have this experience is something that they’re going to remember forever.”\n\nWhether its the first trip out of town or the first trip on a train, Brightline is happy to be apart of the journey.\n\n“We’re excited to welcome these Special Olympic athletes onboard and allow them the opportunity to relax, kickback, get ready to compete as they make their way up to Central Florida,” said Ali Soule, with Brightline.\n\nFor many it’s not just about competing, but it’s also about representation.\n\n“Also being able to say that I got to show what Special Olympics is all about,” said Dager.\n\nSouth Florida is rooting for our Special Olympic athletes to come back with some gold around their necks.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.
