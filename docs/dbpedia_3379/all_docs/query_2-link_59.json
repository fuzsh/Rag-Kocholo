        "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa – The Drake Relays presented by Xtream powered by Mediacom has announced a field of renowned athletes in the elite men's and women's hurdles for 2024. The lineups for the four hurdles events include a balance of accomplished Olympians and national record holders looking to fend off several of the sport's young rising stars.\n\n\"Elite hurdlers are some of the most impressive athletes at any track and field event, and we're proud to again feature the world's best at the Drake Relays,\" Blake Boldon, the Franklin P. Johnson Director of the Drake Relays said. \"These fields make such a difficult sport look easy, and every seat in the house will be full for these races.\"\n\nOne name in this year's women's elite 100m hurdles that stands out for Relays fans is hometown hero Lolo Jones. A three-time Olympian and former American record holder in the 60m hurdles, Jones also returns to Des Moines to be inducted into the Drake Relays Athletes Hall of Fame on April 25 at the Schickler Club in the Knapp Center.\n\nThe Des Moines Roosevelt graduate became the first four-time winner in the Drake Relays invitational women's 100m hurdles capturing consecutive titles from 2005-08. She was named the outstanding women's performer of the 2008 Drake Relays after setting a meet record of 12.74 seconds and finished second in the 100 hurdles at the 2010 and 2011 Drake Relays.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Trials champion in 2008, Jones led the finals of the 100 hurdles at the Beijing Olympics before clipping the ninth hurdle, finishing seventh. She also finished fourth in the 2012 Summer Games.\n\nShe won U.S indoor track and field national titles in 2007, 2008, and 2009 in the 60m hurdles. With gold medals at the World Indoor Championship in 2008 and 2010, Jones became the first to win back-to-back titles in the event. An 11-time NCAA All-American at LSU, Jones won three NCAA golds and earned silver four times.\n\n\"Not only is Lolo one of the most dynamic athletes to grace the Blue Oval, but her ties to Drake, Des Moines, and the state of Iowa cannot be understated,\" Boldon added. \"She has always been such a beacon of pride for Iowans and track and field fans everywhere. We're eager to give her a much-deserved celebration, both on the track and off.\"\n\nNia Ali enters Drake Stadium as one of the favorites in an accomplished 100m hurdles field. Ranked sixth in the event's global rankings, Ali's personal-best of 12.30 seconds is the ninth fastest finish in world history. The 2016 Olympic silver medalist, 2019 World Champion, and Drake Relays veteran is vying for her first Drake Relays victory, having finished third last year and fifth in 2019. Ali earned an eighth-place finish in the 100m hurdles at the 2017 and 2023 World Championships.\n\nJoining Jones and Ali as American Olympians in the race are Gabbi Cunningham, Christina Clemons, and Queen Harrison-Claye. Cunningham, who has held a world ranking as high as No. 8, earned seventh at the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo. She claimed third at the World Indoor Championships in the 60m hurdles the proceeding spring.\n\nClemons achieved a fifth-place finish at the 2017 World Championships and was a semifinalist at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. The world's former third-ranked hurdler secured one of her two NCAA Championships in Drake Stadium in 2012 and ran the tenth-best time of her career in 2018 at the Des Moines USA Championships in the Blue Oval.\n\nQueen Harrison-Claye, who set her personal record of 12.43 seconds in her 2013 Drake Relays victory, will be competing in her fifth Relays and first since 2017. The 2008 Olympian placed fifth at the World Championships in 2013 and won the Pan American Games in 2015. Great Britain and Northern Ireland's national record holder (12.50 seconds) and two-time Olympian Cindy Sember also poses as a threat in this year's race. She comes to Des Moines with a world rank of 23 and has held a rank as high as fifth.\n\nIn the men's 110 hurdles, Tade Ojora will also represent Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a top contender in the event. The four-time national champion presently holds the best global ranking of his professional career at No. 22 and has a personal best time of 13.26 seconds.\n\nTwo American challengers, Michael Dickson and Dylan Beard, have sights set on a top finish. Dickson placed seventh at the 2022 Relays while Beard is slated to make his Relays debut in 2024. Beard, a two-time conference champion at Howard, burst onto the national scene earlier this year, besting an impressive field the 60m hurdles at the 2024 Millrose Games in February. Beard's time of 7.44 seconds was just one-hundredth of a second from tying the all-time Millrose record.\n\nFans will witness a bevy of Olympians in this year's women's 400m hurdles. Ashley Spencer, who holds claim to the eleventh-best time in American history at 53.11 seconds, headlines a field of familiar athletes. Spencer won a bronze medal for the United States in the 400m hurdles at the 2016 Rio Olympics. With a decorated international resume in both the 400m hurdles and 4x400m relay, Spencer has finished second (2021), third (2019), and fourth (2018) in her career at the Drake Relays.\n\nThe majority of the women's 400m hurdlers representing international countries including Panama's national record holder Gianna Woodruff, who holds the second-best personal-best of the field at 53.69 seconds. The Olympian is racing in her fourth-consecutive Relays, placing third last year after claiming second in 2022 and first in 2021. Tia-Adana Belle of Barbados returns to America's Athletic Classic following her fourth-place finish in Des Moines last spring. Belle competed in the last two Olympic Games and is a five-time Barbados national champion.\n\nThe slate for the men's 400m hurdles features a trio of Americans leading the field with the top personal-best times. Trevor Bassitt, No. 6 in the event's latest world rankings, aims for the title in his Drake Relays debut. A recent collegiate standout at Ashland, Bassitt set two NCAA Division II records (Indoor 200m, Indoor 400m) and garnered 10 national championships and 21 All-American awards in his college career. Only two years removed from his days as a student-athlete, Bassitt has already set the ninth-best time (47.38 seconds) in United States history just last August at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nFellow Americans Khallifah Rosser and Aldrich Bailey Jr. should also challenge for the title in the men's 400m hurdles. Rosser is now ranked No. 12 and had long held a world rank of second. His personal best of 47.59 seconds is good for 14th best in American history. Bailey Jr., who has an accomplished resume in the 100m and 400m, began running in the 400m hurdles in 2021. Shortly after, he placed fourth at the 2021 Olympic Trials, narrowly missing the Olympic team by one place.\n\nSingle session tickets are now available, and the Saturday session is heading toward a 57th-consecutive sellout. Tickets for the 2024 Drake Relays are available here.\n\nWomen's 100m Hurdles\n\nNia Ali (United States)\n\nRanked No. 6 in the world\n\nWon silver at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro\n\nWon gold
