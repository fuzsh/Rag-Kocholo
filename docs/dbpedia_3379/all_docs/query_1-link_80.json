After over 70 bouts in the ring, Shannon could not find a place where the average person could be exposed to the \"Top Secret\" training of some of the best fighters in the world. That is where his vision for 9Round began. He knew that if he could take the gruelling workouts he did in the ring, and create a non-intimidating, convenient circuit workout format, then the average person could enjoy the benefits of boxing and kickboxing only available to professional athletes. Shannon and his wife, Heather, opened their first 9Round studio in 2008 in Greenville, SC. Since then, the brand has grown to more than 600 locations across 41 states and 18 countries, plus many more in various stages of development – all delivering on the promise of making members stronger in 30 minutes, physically and mentally.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss:\n\nShannon's story on founding 9Round fitness\n\nHow different teams across functions come together to drive growth\n\nShannon's framework to leading at the highest level, and why taking care of yourself must be a priority\n\nImportance of strong execution, and how Shannon aligns his team to metrics\n\nHow to measure and track progress for a unified vision\n\n9Round fitness franchising and its competitive advantage compared to other fitness brands\n\nCarla Rosenberg is Senior Vice President of Charity & Events Management for global sports marketing agency SPORTFIVE and is part of the leadership team.

While helping athletes manage their Foundations and having her finger on the pulse of the professional sports landscape and philanthropic scene, her ability to maximize revenue opportunities and execute championship-level charity events has earned her notoriety as a game changer in the industry. From professional tennis tournaments to galas, she and her team have planned and executed some of the nation’s highest-profile events.\n\nIn 2019, Carla was selected as a recipient of Sports Business Journal’s Game Changers Awards, which honors a select group of women who are having a major impact in transforming the sports business industry.
