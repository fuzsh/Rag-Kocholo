Then my mother introduced me to Rhythmic Gymnastics where I instantly fell in love. I have been in the gym almost everyday since then and if I wasn’t training you would find me in our basement practicing tricks and choreographing routines. I was fortunate enough to excel, quickly moving through the ranks. I competed for one year at the Provincial level and then immediately moved up to the National level, where at age 11, I won my first International competition in Los Angeles.\n\nSince I was young it has been my dream to compete for Canada at World Championships and ultimately the Olympic Games. My Olympic dream began a long time ago, when I first watched my Canadian idol Alexandra Orlando compete at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nI’ve been competing in Rhythmic Gymnastics for over 13 years now and as I have grown up in the world of Rhythmic Gymnastics I have overcome many injuries and personal struggles. This sport has taught me so much, priceless life lessons and tools that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.\n\nFor the past few years, with the help of my club Silhouettes of York, I’ve been able to organize annual Special Olympic workshops where I get to share my knowledge and expertise with many Special Olympic Gymnasts. This is just a small way I try to give back to my community and it is personally rewarding to see their smiles, enthusiasm, and enormous love for the sport! I’ve always had a passion for sports and competition and even when my career is finished, I hope to continue to inspire young athletes to pursue their dreams in sports."
