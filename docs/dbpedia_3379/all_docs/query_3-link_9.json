        "text": "Commonwealth Games star Alexandra Orlando of Toronto swept all four events Sunday at the Canadian rhythmic gymnastics championships in Surrey, B.C.\n\nOrlando, 19, who won a record six gold medals earlier this year at the Commonwealth Games, placed first in the ball, rope, clubs and ribbon events.\n\nOrlando completed a successful weekend as she won the all-around title on Saturday.\n\n\"I felt really good about my performances, I made no mistakes in all four events today,\" said Orlando, who plans to train the rest of the year and increase the difficulty of her routines for the Olympic qualifying events next season.\n\n\"I was most pleased with my ball routine because I made an error in it during the all-around competition.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Orlando's top national rival, Montreal's Yana Tsikaridze, announced her retirement after the competition. She competed for three seasons on the national team.\n\nThe 18-year-old Tsikaridze was born in Georgia and came to Canada at age 10. She placed third in the all-around event Saturday.\n\n\"I felt I delivered my strongest performance ever this weekend so I'm pleased to retire at my best,\" said Tsikaridze.\n\n\"Now I'll focus on school and also get into coaching.\""
