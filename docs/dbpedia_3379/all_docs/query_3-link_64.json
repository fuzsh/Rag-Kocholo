        "text": "SMC Athletics / Piper Westrom\n\nMen's Basketball 7/11/2024 10:55:00 AM\n\nMBB | Group of Former Gaels Compete in Early Wave of Summer League Games, Prepare for Vegas\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif./SALT LAKE CITY â€” The early wave of NBA Summer League competition has come to an end and teams are getting geared up for the major NBA 2K25 Summer League event in Las Vegas, which begins tomorrow. A pair of former Gaels were able to get their feet wet in the early Summer League events in Sacramento and Salt Lake City, while two more are getting geared up for their 2025 Summer League debuts in Vegas.\n\nOf the four Gaels on Summer League rosters, Jordan Ford is the only one who has seen time on an NBA court. The 2020 Saint Mary's graduate made his NBA debut with the Sacramento Kings on October 25 against the Utah Jazz, and scored his first NBA points a little over a week later against the Houston Rockets on November 4. In total, Ford appeared in six contests, shooting 57.1% from the field and 66.7% from three in limited action. He also appeared in 24 contests with the NBA G-League Stockton Kings, averaging 15.5 points and 4.2 assists per game.\n\nPlaying in the California Classic in Sacramento, Jordan Ford looked the part of a veteran amongst the group of younger Summer League players. The 26 year old guard averaged 19.5 points per contest, good for fourth best in the event, while shooting 65.2% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc. Ford appeared in two of his squad's three contests in Sacramento, leading the Kings, scoring 17 points on 7-10 shooting and a team best 6 assists in a victory over the Lakers, and leading Sacramento with 22 points in a loss to the Heat.\n\nReturning to Summer League for the first time since 2022, Tommy Kuhse also appeared in the California Classic, as a member of the Lakers Summer League side. In 2022, Kuhse played extremely well for the Orlando Magic in Summer League, averaging 17.3 points per contest and shooting 58.3% from the field, eventually earning him a roster spot for the Austin Spurs in the G-League in 2022-23. Last year, Kuhse played for SC Rasta Vechta of the Basketball Bundesliga in Germany. There, he appeared in 36 of 38 contests, leading the team with 17.9 points per game and 5.7 assists per game. Rasta Vechta went 22-16 last season, and made the Basketball Bundesliga playoff after being promoted from the ProA (German Second Tier League) just one year prior.\n\nKuhse appeared in all three of the Lakers contests in Sacramento this past week, averaging 11.3 points per contest to go along with five assists per game. He opened up Summer League play by scoring 15 points and dishing out eight assists against Jordan Ford's Kings squad. This outstanding performance earned him a start in game two against Golden State, and while his numbers weren't quite as solid as the game prior, he still managed 10 points against the Warriors. Closing out the event, Kuhse again started for the Lakers against Miami, and scored nine points while assisting on five buckets.\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 2024 NBA Draft, Alex Ducas signed a two-way deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Geraldton, West Australia native is coming off of a second team All-WCC campaign that saw him earn the distinction of most games ever played in an SMC uniform. Ducas led the Gaels to a WCC Regular Season and Tournament Title in 2023-24, averaging 10 points and six rebounds per game, and shooting 44% from three.\n\nDucas appeared on the Oklahoma City roster for all three Summer League contests in Salt Lake City, but did not play in any of the contests, dealing with a left hip strain. Ducas will look to recover and make his Summer League debut in Las Vegas. The Thunder will play on July 13 (Raptors), July 15 (Heat), July 17 (Suns), and July 19 (Warriors) before bracket play starts on July 20.\n\nRounding out the group of Summer League Gaels is Logan Johnson. Johnson spent last season with the Oklahoma City Blue of the G-League after being selected ninth overall in the 2023 G-League Draft. He appeared in 22 games with the Blue this past season, averaging 6.1 points per contest and shooting 49% from the field, helping the Blue to the G-League title.\n\nJohnson has made his way onto the Phoenix Suns' Summer League squad for 2024. The Suns did not compete in Sacramento or Salt Lake City, so Johnson will have a chance to make his 2024 Summer League debut in Las Vegas. The Suns will play on July 13 (Warriors), July 16 (Pacers), July 17 (Thunder), and July 19 (Bucks) before bracket play starts on July 20. Gaels fans should keep an eye on the July 17 matchup that should feature a clash between former teammates Logan Johnson and Alex Ducas.\n\n#GaelsRise\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#44 Alex Ducas\n\nG/F\n\n6' 7\"\n\nFifth Year"
