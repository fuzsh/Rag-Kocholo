        "text": "2024 Paris Olympics: Athletes to watch\n\nThe Paris Olympics officially began on July 26, 2024. Over the course of the next two weeks, some 10,500 athletes will compete in 329 events. The Games will feature a full roster of star athletes, and there will undoubtedly be a number of breakout stars. Who should be on your radar? Read on for our list of athletes who are likely to make news in Paris.\n\nGymnastics\n\nSimone Biles\n\nOne of the greatest gymnasts in the history of the sport, Simone Biles is hoping to add to her legacy in Paris. She is returning for her third Olympics after making headlines at the 2020 Games in Tokyo (delayed until 2021 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic). There she raised awareness of mental health issues and the pressures placed on athletes after she withdrew from a number of events due to the “twisties,” a mental block in which gymnasts lose their spatial orientation during aerial moves.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: United States\n\nBirth date: March 14, 1997\n\nOlympic medals: 6 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze\n\nSuni Lee\n\nSometimes overshadowed by her teammate Simone Biles, Suni Lee seized the moment at the 2020 Olympic Games, after Biles withdrew from a number of events. Lee went on to win a gold medal in the all-around event and a bronze in the uneven bars. She also helped the U.S. team capture a silver in the team event. For the past two years, Lee has been dealing with a kidney-related health issue, but she competed in Paris.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: United States\n\nBirth date: March 9, 2003\n\nOlympic medals: 2 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze\n\nTrack and field\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\n\nA two-time gold medalist in the 100-meter dash, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is considered one of the world’s best female sprinters. Known as the “Pocket Rocket”—she is 5 feet 3 inches (1.6 meters) tall—she won gold medals in the 100-meter race at both the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2012 London Games. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, she earned a silver medal in the event. Fraser-Pryce has announced that the 2024 Paris Games will be her last competition.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: Jamaica\n\nBirth date: December 27, 1986\n\nOlympic medals: 3 gold, 4 silver, 1 bronze\n\nSha’Carri Richardson\n\nAnother outstanding sprinter is Sha’Carri Richardson. She was considered a medal contender for the 2020 Olympics but was unable to compete after testing positive for marijuana. She overcame that setback, and at the 2023 world championships she won a gold medal in the 100-meter dash, finishing with the fifth fastest time ever for a woman. With her speed as well as a bold signature style, Richardson will likely earn more fans during the Paris Games.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: United States\n\nBirth date: March 25, 2000\n\nOlympic medals: 0\n\nEliud Kipchoge\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nWidely considered the world’s greatest marathoner, Eliud Kipchoge has won 15 of the 18 marathons in which he has raced. In addition to two Olympic gold medals, he has won the Chicago (2014), Berlin (2015, 2017, 2018, 2022, and 2023), and London (2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019) marathons. In addition, in 2019 he broke the two-hour mark in an unsanctioned marathon, finishing in 1 hr 59 min 40 sec. However, the time was not officially recognized, since the event did not follow competition rules.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: Kenya\n\nBirth date: November 5, 1984\n\nOlympic medals: 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nIn 2023 American sprinter Noah Lyles became known as “the fastest man in the world” after winning a trio of gold medals—in the 100 meters, the 200 meters, and the 4 × 100-meter relay—at the world championships. That title will be on the line at the Paris Games, where he hopes to win his first Olympic gold medals. In addition to his performance on the track, Lyles will likely draw attention for his sense of style.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: United States\n\nBirth date: July 18, 1997\n\nOlympic medals: 1 bronze\n\nNeeraj Chopra\n\nNeeraj Chopra is one of the leading competitors in the javelin throw.

She began winning international competitions at age 11, and at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics she won the silver in street skateboarding. With that win, the 13-year-old Leal became one of the youngest medalists in the history of the Games and the youngest Olympic medalist from Brazil.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: Brazil\n\nBirth date: January 4, 2008\n\nOlympic medals: 1 silver, 1 bronze\n\nYuto Horigome\n\nYuto Horigome began skateboarding as a toddler, and in 2018 he became the first Japanese athlete to win a Street League Skateboarding championship. Horigome’s success was partly attributed to his unparalleled control and finesse. At the 2020 Tokyo Games he continued to make history, becoming the first-ever Olympic gold medalist in the men’s street skateboarding event.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: Japan\n\nBirth date: January 7, 1999\n\nOlympic medals: 2 gold\n\nSport climbing\n\nNatalia Grossman\n\nMultidiscipline sport climber Natalia Grossman is considered a standout in bouldering.

In 2024 Moore announced that she will step away from surfing after competing in the Paris Olympics.\n\nQuick facts\n\nCountry: United States\n\nBirth date: August 27, 1992\n\nOlympic medals: 1 gold\n\nKatie Ledecky\n\nKatie Ledecky is one of the sport’s dominant freestylers, especially known for her performances in the 800 meters and 1,500 meters.
