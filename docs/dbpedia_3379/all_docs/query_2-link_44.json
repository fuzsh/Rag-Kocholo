        "text": "In her Olympic debut at PyeongChang 2018, Sarah Nurse helped Canada win the silver medal. Nurse won gold with Team Canada at the 2013 IIHF U18 Womenâs World Championship, despite having missed most of the selection camp due to injury. In 2015 she added a gold medal as a member of the National Womenâs Development Team that competed at the Nations Cup and made her debut with the National Womenâs Team at the Four Nations Cup. Nurse began her collegiate career at the University of Wisconsin in 2013-14 and was named to the All-WCHA Rookie Team. The following season she helped the Badgers win the WCHA Final Faceoff, for which she was named Most Outstanding Player. During the 2016 NCAA Frozen Four, Nurse fractured her wrist. She underwent surgery and was unable to hold a stick for three months. She was cleared to return to the ice just two weeks before the national U22 development team camp and made that team. In her senior year of college in 2016-17 she served as an alternate captain and was a Second-Team All-American.\n\nMost recently, Nurse won her first gold medal at the IIHF Womenâs World Championship in August 2021. When Sarahâs off the ice, her passion is making the game more inclusive now and for the future female hockey players who will follow.\n\nNurse is one of many prominent talented players of the Professional Womenâs Hockey Players Association (PWHPA). She also serves as a player representative on the PWHPAâs board for the over 200 top female hockey players in the world who banded together to create the association in May 2019.\n\nNurse also participated in the second installment of the PWHPA Dream Gap Tour that showcases the top players in womenâs professional hockey, along with community events.\n\nNurseâs extended family includes cousins Darnell Nurse, an NHL player with the Edmonton Oilers, and Kia Nurse, a standout basketball player at the University of Connecticut and 2015 Pan Am Games gold medalist.\n\nCynthia Appiah is a celebrated Canadian Bobsledder who was an alternate Brakewoman for Team Canada at the 2018 Olympic Games in PyeongChang. She will be making history competing in the Monobob event when it makes its debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nCynthia had an outstanding rookie start back in the 2015/2016 season as a Brakewoman. She pushed for two-time Olympic champion, Kaillie Humphries, when they achieved a Gold and Bronze medal at the World Cup. Cynthia also backed rookie pilot Alysia Rissling to her first ever World Cup Bronze medal. After PyeongChang, she decided to switch positions from Brakewoman to Pilot and has been in that position ever since. Cynthiaâs strongest event has become the Monobob. She claimed two victories in the event in 2019 and finished 5th at the 2021 World Championships.\n\nDespite being the victim of occasional racism competing in a sport where Black Pilots are rare, Cynthia has persevered and maintains a positive and hopeful outlook for the future. Appiahâs journey toward a life in elite sport began through a Jays Care Foundation outreach initiative where children from under-privileged Toronto neighbourhoods were invited to learn to play baseball at a local park. Cynthiaâs parents immigrated to Canada from Ghana and sheâs exceptionally proud of all that her family has achieved. Sheâs never allowed living in Toronto Community Housing to define herself or her family. She wants to inspire all the kids growing up in difficult circumstances to chase their dreams even when they seem impossible.\n\nLacquette was selected to represent Canadaâs National Womenâs Team at the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, making her the first First Nations athlete to play on Canadaâs Womenâs Olympic Hockey team. Lacquette made her debut in Canadaâs National Womenâs Team Program in 2008 with Canadaâs National Womenâs Under-18 Team. She is a two-time participant at the IIHF U18 Womenâs World Championship, winning Gold in 2010 and Silver in 2009. As a member of Canadaâs National Womenâs Development Team she appeared in 21 games, winning Gold at the Nations Cup in 2013 and 2016. She has been part of the National Womenâs Senior team since 2015, participating and winning medals in 2015, 2016 and 2019. In July 2021, Brigette accepted the role as a Pro Scout for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League. Brigetteâs success in hockey shows young Indigenous girls that they belong and can be successful in sports, and they can achieve greatness. Brigette is a role model for our youth and has used her platform to visit schools and communities to speak about the determination and resilience that led her through her hockey career.\n\n2018 Olympic Games â Silver\n\n2-time IIHF World Championship Silver medalist\n\n2013 Four Nations Cup â Gold\n\nLike so many Canadians, Meaghan Mikkelsonâs priorities are firmly rooted in a love for her family and teammates and respect for the game. Her father, Bill Mikkelson, played four seasons in the NHL in the early 1970s with Los Angeles, the New York Islanders and Washington Capitals. Her brother, Brendan, was a Memorial Cup champion with the WHLâs Vancouver Giants and now plays professional hockey in Sweden. And, her husband Scott Reid was a professional goalie for 13 years in the AHL, CHL, ECHL and in Europe. A graduate of The University of Wisconsinâs hockey program, Meaghan led the team to back-to-back NCAA Championships, won the Olympic Gold medal for Canada in Vancouver 2010 and followed that up with a win at the 2012 IIHF World Hockey Championships. In Sochi 2014, Meaghan added an element of hockey toughness to her growing resume. Playing with a broken hand in the Olympic Final versus the USA, she assisted on the opening goal for Canada that sparked the comeback that will be talked about for decades. Meaghan joined teammate Natalie Spooner on Season 2 of The Amazing Race Canada, winning an impressive 7 stages en route to finishing second in the finale. They were voted \"Canada's Favourite Team\" by fans of the number-one ranked show in the country. After Sochi, Meaghan took some time off from hockey to have a baby before returning to the team with the goal of representing Canada in Pyeongchang 2018. She was successful in doing so, and helped Canada bring home a Silver medal. Following the 2018 Olympics, Meaghan and her husband Scott decided it was time to add another âplayer to their teamâ and Meaghan took another year off to have her second baby. Though it would be easy to put her skates away and retire now, sheâs not done yet. With her sights set on the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, Meaghan is facing some of the greatest challenges she has ever encountered in her career. But thatâs not going to stop her.\n\n2018 Olympic Games â Silver\n\n2018 & 2014 Olympic Games â Gold\n\n2016 Clarkson Cup Champion\n\nMandy Bujold is a Canadian Olympic boxer, whose career was launched following a successful 2006 when she claimed the Canadian National Championship and Boxer of the Year titles. Weighing in at 51kg she has made her way as a Fly Weight Champion, with a trail of titles and victories following her. Included amongst her many achievements are 11 Canadian National Championships, 3 Continental Championships, a Gold medal at the first Pan American Games and a Bronze medal at the first Commonwealth Games that included womenâs Boxing. During the Toronto 2015 Pan American Games Mandy successfully defended her title and became the only female boxer in history to win 2 Pan American Games titles. She took home a Gold medal at the 2016 Continental Olympic Qualifier securing 1 of only 2 spots available for the continent in her weight division for the Olympic Games in Rio. Mandy has been recognized by Waterloo Region as a Woman of Influence and named KW Citizen of the Year for her outstanding contribution to the community. In 2018, Mandy brought her passion for the community and boxing together as she founded a white collar charity boxing event called Champions for Charity. She is also a new mom to Kate Olympia (âKOâ). Since qualifying for Tokyo, Mandy has become the first Canadian female boxer to represent Canada at two Olympic Games. In the end Mandyâs fight to qualify for Tokyo outside the ring was about more than an Olympic quota spot or a medal, it was about gender equity in sport.

As a child, she showed great strength of character and tenacity. ChloÃ© knew she loved mogul skiing from the start, but she wasnât really interested in school work. Yet, to be allowed to ski during the weekends, there was one important condition: to have good marks. Knowing she had to do better in order to keep doing the sport she loves, she put in more effort and soon became a good student. She realized that with concentration and hard work, all her dreams could come true. With this in mind, ChloÃ© set her focus on skiing, As a result, at only 18 years of age, her dream of skiing in front of the entire world at the Olympic Games became reality. In Vancouver (2010), she finished 5th and instantly charmed the whole country with her genuine smile. Four years later, at the Sochi Olympic Games (2014), with a bag full of experience, ChloÃ© won the silver medal. She captured the heart of Canadians once again when she stepped onto the podium holding hands with her sister Justine. Looking forward to Beijing (2022), in what will be her fourth Olympic Games, ChloÃ© would then share the Canadian record for the number of Olympic starts with Jean-Luc Brassard. She could also reach another important milestone by becoming the Canadian mogul skier with the most starts (overall), surpassing Pierre-Alexandre Rousseau and her other sister Maxime.\n\n2014 Olympic Games- Silver\n\n2015/2016 Crystal Globe Winner\n\n2014 World Championships- Gold\n\nFull of energy and strong-minded, Justine is the youngest of her two sisters. Growing up as the baby of the family, Justine followed her sisters Maxime and ChloÃ© everywhere they went and did everything they did. To keep up with her sisters, Justine started mogul skiing at 8 years old. She wasnât into competition at first as she preferred to have fun with her friends on the slopes and eat candies. However, after winning a few races, Justine discovered her taste for competition and realized that she was a talented skier. The moment Justine saw her sister ChloÃ© compete at the Olympic Games in Vancouver (2010) was really the triggering event and she then set her eyes on becoming an Olympian as well. After four years of hard work, she fulfilled her dream and gave an outstanding performance in Sochi (2014), winning the gold medal and becoming the second Canadian female athlete to win an Olympic gold medal in mogul skiing. Full of confidence and on top of her game, she came back in full force in PyeongChang (2018), winning the silver medal. Justine's next goal is set on Beijing (2022), where she could join Norwegian superstar Kari Traa at the top with three Olympic podiums and become the most decorated Canadian Olympian in mogul skiing.\n\n2014 Olympic Games â Gold\n\n2018 Olympic Games â Silver\n\n2018 World Championships â Bronze\n\nThe drive for Sara to be an athlete started back in her gymnastics days as a young child.

In her first year of multi-event training at Western University, Sara won the 2015 Junior National Championships in the heptathlon, which qualified her to represent Canada at the 2015 Junior Pan Am Games held in Edmonton. In her second year, while competing in the pentathlon at the Provincial University Championships (OUAs), she miscalculated a step in one of her long jump warm-ups and would later be diagnosed with a bone bruise in her ankle. Sara ended up with gold and was ranked first going into the Canadian University Championships (CIS, now USports), but the pain in her ankle was high. At CIS, she got to the second event, high jump, and it was evident she would not be able to continue the competitionâ¦She had DNF next to her name. After this experience, Sara became very unsure of her next steps. After a lot of back and forth, she decided that she would specialize in the throws. In 2019, she found herself standing on the podium in second place at the USports Championships in shot put. In 2018, Sara attended an RBC Training Ground event where she was put through various fitness tests such as a broad jump, vertical jump test, 30m sprint, etc. Sara ended up winning a few of the individual events and the overall for the women. It was here where she was recruited to a number of different sports including bobsleigh. In December of 2018, Sara had her first experience in a bobsled in Calgary. She had no clue what to expectâ¦She had seen it on TV, but âyou donât know what you donât knowâ. Her first run down the track ended in a crash! Luckily, that did not scare her off and she finished the week. She came back home to Ontario and knew that she was going to become a bobsledder. In October of 2019, she was announced to the Team Canada Development team, and has progressed nicely.
