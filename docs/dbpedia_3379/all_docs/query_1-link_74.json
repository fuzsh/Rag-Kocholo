        "text": "The Orlando Pride are making sure that Seb Hines isn’t going anywhere, announcing on Wednesday that they have signed the coach to a contract extension through 2026. The contract also includes an option for 2027.\n\nThis marks Hines’ second full season as head coach of the Pride, and he’s currently in the midst of leading the team on a historic unbeaten streak. Back in May, the club set the National Women’s Soccer League record for longest win streak with eight consecutive wins.\n\nThey’re also undefeated through 16 games to start the NWSL season, with their unbeaten streak going 17 games dating back to last season. It’s the longest unbeaten streak in NWSL history.\n\n“Seb has done a tremendous job leading the Orlando Pride since taking over as head coach in 2022, and we are very excited to reward him with a new contract with the Club,” Orlando Pride Chairman Mark Wilf said in a press release. “Bringing valuable experience from his time as both a player and a coach, Seb has elevated this team and helped build one of the most exciting squads in NWSL history. We are excited to continue working with Seb as our goals for the Pride continue to rise and we are thrilled to have him at the helm for the foreseeable future.”\n\nSave 24% for the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nIn honor of the 2024 Paris Olympics, we are offering a discount on new annual subscriptions to The Equalizer. Use code Paris2024 at checkout or follow the link below.\n\nCoupon valid through the closing ceremony on Aug. 11.\n\nFirst a player for Orlando’s MLS side, Orlando City, Hines joined the team’s youth coaching staff upon his retirement in 2018. He was later elevated to an assistant coaching position with the Pride in 2020.\n\nHe was named the club’s head coach in 2022 after then-coach Amanda Cromwell was placed on administrative leave roughly halfway through the regular season. The club finished in 10th in the league that year with a 5-7-10 record, with Hines guiding the team to a seven-game unbeaten streak during his time as interim coach.\n\nLast season, Hines took over as the Pride’s full-time head coach, leading them to a 10-1-11 record and finishing the season one spot outside of the playoffs.\n\nSince being hired as the team’s head coach, Hines has a 21-11-6 regular season record. The team’s 13 home wins in his time as head coach is the most of any NWSL club since the start of the 2023 season. He currently sits one win shy of Tom Sermanni for the most wins as a manager in Pride history.\n\nHines has also leaned into the development of players, with 2023 No. 3 pick Emily Sams being named an alternate to the U.S. women’s national team Olympic roster.\n\n“I’m proud of what we have accomplished to this point, but our work isn’t done yet,” Hines said in a release. “At the end of the day, we want to win something. We want to build a legacy here. We want to give back to the community and to make sure that fans are wanting to come watch this group of athletes go out there and perform every week. I’m excited to continue leading this Club and to continue giving back to a city that means so much to me and my family.”"
