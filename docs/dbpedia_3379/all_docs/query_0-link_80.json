        "text": "Gracie Survival Tactics (GST) is a revolutionary defensive tactics system based on Gracie Jiu-Jitsu that incorporates time-tested techniques into an easy-to-learn system designed to help officers verbally and physically de-escalate while humanely prevailing resistant and/or aggressive subjects.\n\nActive-duty law enforcement professionals, as well as military personnel and first responders, can access the GST system and become Certified Instructors via our Live Instructor Certification Program (Live ICP) or via our video-based Online Instructor Certification Program (Online ICP).\n\nExplore this page to learn more about the origins and objectives of GST program, and then visit the other tabs to learn about the path to GST Instructor Certification.\n\nGST Featured on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel\n\nA Century-Long Track Record\n\nGracie Jiu-Jitsu, also known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or BJJ, was developed by Helio and Carlos Gracie. Beginning in the 1920’s, Helio began his journey of tailoring the system to use various principles, such as leverage and distance management, to defeat opponents who were almost twice his size and much more athletic. Helio spent his long life testing and refining the techniques against all challengers.\n\nAfter the UFC took the world by storm in 1993, people all over the world realized that Gracie Jiu-Jitsu was the only system that would consistently give someone a realistic chance against a larger, more athletic opponent. Shortly thereafter, in response to requests by law enforcement officers, the Gracie Family extracted the simplest and most effective techniques to address the most common threat situations facing law enforcement professionals.\n\nIn the ensuing thirty years, GST has been taught to countless law enforcement agencies (Local, State, and Federal), and the program continues to evolve every single day based on the feedback from those whose lives depend on it. As Rener Gracie likes to say:\n\n“In the beginning, we were teaching jiu-jitsu TO law enforcement; now we’re teaching jiu-jitsu FOR law enforcement.”\n\nA Perfect Fit for Today’s Tactical, Legal & Political Environment\n\nThe GST System has recently been reviewed both medically and legally for use in law enforcement. Furthermore, although GST was developed for its tactical effectiveness, its leverage-based techniques are less likely to cause serious injury to both the officer and arrestee. Also, GST’s benign appearance has a greater acceptance from a viewing public, which has been increasingly scrutinizing televised videos of police actions. Here are the links to those reviews as well as some articles about the system:\n\nMedical Review #1\n\nMedical Review #2\n\nMedical Review #3\n\nLegal Review #1\n\nLegal Review #2\n\nLegal Review #3\n\nArticle 1 – How Mixed Martial Arts Impacted Law Enforcement\n\nArticle 2 – 10 Vital Steps to Incorporate GST in Your Agency\n\nArticle 3 – Why Investing in Empty Hand Skills Helps Reduce Liability Exposure for Officers and Their Agency\n\nGST Introductory Class\n\nThe 5 Pillars of GST\n\nThrough the GST program our goal isn’t merely to teach defensive tactics to an agency but rather to provide the agency with the tools to completely transform its culture from the inside out. This culture shift occurs when the following five pillars are in place at an agency.\n\nDe-escalation Culture\n\nAbove everything else, in GST we teach systems and strategies such as Dynamic De-escalation™ to reduce the intensity of each encounter, gain voluntary compliance, and mitigate the need for a higher level of force. Once this culture of de-escalation has permeated an agency, the questions isn’t “What’s the highest level of justifiable force for this encounter?” but rather, “What’s the lowest level of force needed to neutralize the threat and/or take the subject into custody?” Sound Decision Making\n\nThrough GST we condition officers to make effective decisions under the most challenging of circumstances. The “Amygdala Highjack” is known to occur when an officer experiences loss of control in a high-stress situations, at which point they are no longer able to make effective decisions. By teaching officers how to calmly and effectively manage physical encounters, they’re able to maintain the cognitive function of their Prefrontal Cortex so that they can make sound decisions even under the most stressful of circumstances. Mission Specific Tactics\n\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a rapidly growing sport, but at most BJJ schools, the practice of the art is tailored to sportive grappling competition rather than self-defense. Unless the art is adapted for law enforcement applications, there are many facets of BJJ that would not only be ineffective in law enforcement but could potentially increase liability for the officer and the agency. GST is the most widely adopted jiu-jitsu based defensive tactics program in the world because every technique has been highly scrutinized and specifically adapted for law enforcement application. Injury Reduction on Both Sides\n\nAt most agencies, defensive tactics training is conducted with a “fight club” mentality, which not only leads to higher rate of training injuries, but it discourages the officers who need the training the most from attending. In GST graduates are empowered with a turn-key curriculum and the time-tested Gracie Teaching Methodologies that will make DT classes safe, productive and encouraging for all officers at the agency, so that they want to come back of more. Best of all, because of the control-based nature of the techniques, published data at agencies where officers engage in regular jiu-jitsu practice has revealed a reduction in officer field injuries by as much as 48% and reduction in subject injuries by as much as 53%. Community Trust Building\n\nThere is nothing that erodes trust in a community more rapidly than when law enforcement officers use force that is perceived as inhumane and/or excessive, particularly in situations where a lower level of force could have reasonably been applied. Since GST teaches techniques that are so humane in their application and so benign in their appearance, the chances that an officer uses force in a manner that is likely to incite the community is drastically reduced, and only in the absence of inciting incidents can the foundation for a trust-building relationship with the community be established.\n\nTactical Gear Tested\n\nWe have tested every technique in the Gracie Survival Tactics course in body armor and a duty belt. In fact, we have included the full tactical gear demo for Level 1 and Level 2 techniques in the GST online video courses. At the five-day instructor certification courses, the techniques are practiced in duty gear to ensure universal effectiveness.\n\nPOST Certified Nationwide\n\nFor nearly three decades, our objective has remained the same: create an arrest and control program that provides the optimal solution to help law enforcement officers do their jobs as safely as possible while navigating the constantly evolving tactical, legal, and political environment of the nation. Gracie Survival Tactics (GST) is that solution.\n\nIn recent years, we have worked very closely with State Commissions, further modifying the GST program, to ensure that we meet highest standards when it comes to civilian safety and tactical de-escalation.\n\nThanks to the efforts of our in-house team and the support of so many LEOs nationwide, GST course is now POST Certified in almost every state, making Gracie University the only jiu-jitsu organization in the country to achieve this distinction!\n\nClick here to see if your state awards POST credit (or equivalent) for GST course completion.\n\nBJJ Black Belt & Police Lieutenant Critiques GST\n\nEducated Subjects\n\nMMA is the fastest growing sport in the world, and the general public’s knowledge of basic fighting strategies and techniques has never been so high. There is a very real risk that a law enforcement professional will encounter a subject with some form of martial arts training. The GST program is designed to give law enforcement professionals – regardless of age, gender or athletic ability – the skills to: 1) Neutralize the threat, 2) Retain control of their weapons, and 3) Achieve a position of advantage so they can utilize appropriate force.\n\nRemember, while you are reading this, the subject may be training.\n\nWATCH: Subject Uses “Rear Choke” on Police Officer\n\nTraining Topics\n\nIn the GST program, everything we teach falls into one of these five categories:\n\nSurvival & Escape Strategies: One of the worst-case scenarios for a law enforcement officer is to be taken to the ground by an aggressive subject. The GST course trains participants to use reliable leverage-based techniques to neutralize the initial barrage of strikes and escape from underneath the subject to regain a position of advantage. Additionally, since the techniques do not rely on strength, speed, or athleticism, they can be employed by smaller officers against larger, stronger subjects.\n\nWeapon Retention Techniques: A number of law enforcement officers who are killed in the line of duty are shot with their own weapon. Furthermore, when a subject disarms a police officer of any of their less lethal weapons, chances of the officer having to escalate to deadly force increase exponentially. The GST course teaches a series of simple yet highly-effective weapon retention principles that will defeat an attacker’s attempt to disarm the officer from any position in the fight, standing or on the ground.\n\nTactical De-escalation: For most, de-escalation is limited to verbal strategies. However, in the GST course, officers also learn Dynamic De-escalation™ which teaches officers how to also de-escalate once the situation becomes physical. Since the techniques are all based on non-violent control holds, and do not emphasize the use strikes, they are inherently de-escalatory. So even in the middle of what would otherwise be perceived as a violent physical encounter, a GST-trained officer can stay calm and mitigate the need for higher levels of force.\n\nArrest & Control Procedures: In a physical altercation with an actively aggressive subject, the interaction isn’t resolved until the threat has been neutralized and the subject is safely in custody. As such, the GST course specializes in the application of easy-to-learn highly effective handcuffing techniques that can be applied from any position in the fight and are effective in both solo and multi-officer arrest scenarios.\n\nGracie Teaching Methodologies: The GST course introduces participants to the time-tested Gracie Teaching Methodologies – perfected over nearly a century. Upon learning these skills, Gracie University certifies course participants to return to their organizations to share the invaluable survival skills with their colleagues. At many agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Gracie Teaching Methodologies are said to have completely changed the culture of the defensive tactics programs at the agency.\n\nThe Multi-Level Gracie System\n\nGracie Survival Tactics is a multi-level Defensive Tactics Instructor Certification Program that is comprised of 40 lessons in total: 23 are explored Level 1, and the remaining 17 are explored in Level 2.\n\nGST Level 1 Instructor Certification Program consists of 23 lessons that address the most common scenarios that a law enforcement professional is likely to confront in a hands-on encounter. This course is designed to take officers with absolutely no previous jiu-jitsu experience and equip them with the time-tested techniques and teaching methodologies to confidently instructor other officers within their organization. GST Level 1 Instructor Certification can be achieved by completing the program in person or by completing the course online and demonstrating proficiency via video upload.\n\nGST Level 2 Instructor Certification Program adds 17 more lessons to complete the system that will give law enforcement professionals the tools to survive and prevail in the ever-changing, fast-paced environment. Extra emphasis is given to the incorporation of multiple-officer tactics, including the groundbreaking new SafeWrap™ lateral restraint system, that will empower officers to work as a team to manage high-stress encounters with maximum efficiency and the lowest level of necessary force. GST Level 2 Instructor Certification can be achieved by completing the program in person or by completing the course online and demonstrating proficiency via video upload.\n\nDual Certification Opportunity (GST Levels 1 & 2)\n\nIn order for an agency to experience the full benefit of the GST program, we recommend each instructor completes Levels 1 and 2 as soon as possible. In the past, the only way to achieve this, was to attend 5-day GST Level 1 course at one location and then attend a 5-day GST Level 2 course at a completely different location several months later. With the new Dual Certification Course format, we conduct both courses back-to-back, so that students can learn all 40 techniques and all the Gracie teaching methodologies in 8 days instead of 10.\n\nReduced Training Time: Without any prior experience in jiu-jitsu or defensive tactics, a participant can get certified in GST Level 1 and GST Level 2 in the shortest time possible.\n\nLess OOO Time: Since the entire course is covered in 8 training days (Monday through Friday in week 1 + Monday through Wednesday in week 2), each participant will spend less time out of office than if they completed both courses separately.\n\nReduced Travel Expenses: Since both levels are completed back-to-back at the same location, students will save money on airfare and other travel expenses when compared to completing both courses at separate locations.\n\nReduced Tuition Expenses: The cost for Level 1 and Level 2 certification, if completed separately, is $3000 ($1500 per course). The cost for Dual Certification using this format is $2500.\n\n100+ Years of Law Enforcement Experience\n\nWe have been teaching GST for over 25 years, and in this time we have developed a team of world-class instructors (with over 100 years of combined law enforcement experience) that are dedicated to upholding the highest quality standards. To learn more about each GST Master Instructors, and to see what course participants are saying about each member of the team click here.\n\nTo: Gracie University\n\nFrom: Richard Lemro\n\nSubject: Instructor/training review\n\nGood morning, I recently attended the Gracie Survival Tactics Level 1 & Level 2 Dual Certification Course in Woodbury, New Jersey August 29-September 7th of 2022. I wanted to provide this letter as a thank you and testament to your GST instructors and GST program. The head instructor was Tom Chuckerel, assistant instructor Howard Steele, and intermittent assistant Rich Komar. The training was absolutely phenomenal. By far the best training I have attended. One of the best experiences I've had.\n\nI do have some background in jiu jitsu but have always been trying to figure out how to best apply jiu jitsu to law enforcement. GST really bridged the gap for me.\n\nThe defensive tactics techniques are well thought out, relatively easy to learn, applicable to everyone regardless of physical attributes and GST provided the perfect amount of detail.\n\nBesides the techniques, the class itself is structured very well with sequential learning and techniques flowing off of one another. I thoroughly enjoyed the training delivery via Slice Presentation Formula (layering technique). It really was an efficient way to learn. The taught error correction strategies are also a huge win.\n\nThe program is very thorough on de-escalating during a physical altercation, teaching not to take an altercation personally: \"you don't fight the person you fight their will to fight\"\n\nI love the concept of controlling the suspect and not rushing to handcuff a suspect before compliance is achieved. Another teaching point I really liked was how much GST talked about communication with other Officers when a physical altercation and arrest occurs.\n\nNow I would like to speak about the “make or break” of any program, the instructors. The instructors provided an extremely good training atmosphere and were very encouraging to everyone. I was not quite sure what to expect and thus I brought plenty of Motrin, Excedrin migraine, pain reliever gels and ice packs. Surprisingly I did not need any of the above as the class was extremely safe, well maintained, and dialed up intensity appropriately and as needed. The instructors did a phenomenal job of providing energy and good vibes. I don’t think I saw any students that appeared embarrassed, afraid to ask questions etc. I asked several questions and all were answered effectively.\n\nThe instructors made themselves available to students, were very humble and legitimately seemed invested in the students. The head instructor actually had remembered all ~80 some student's names by the end of day 1 (shocking considering there are not assigned seats, sitting on wrestling mats) it was a rather impressive display. I was able to have dinner with the head instructor Tom Chuckerel several nights and I have to say that GST hires down to earth well-rounded instructors that are just plain old good people. Tom is a class act. It was great to meet him and honestly, I would like to call him my friend. I knew the training and instructors would be good, but this exceeded my expectations.\n\nI honestly can't speak highly enough about the course or the instructors. While I had seen a few of the techniques or variations of techniques on youtube, the instructors had a way of \"making things click\" and providing a lot of details that gave \"ahah moments. \"Sometimes you get what you pay for and the quality was very obvious in this training. It was a great experience, not just a training, and I am excited to share the lessons with our department.\n\nP.S. Please see this letter gets forwarded to GST administrators and Gracie University owners. I would like to make sure the company truly understands the value of their instructors.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nS/Cpl.

The program can be completed in-person via our 5-day Live Instructor Certification Program or remotely via video using our Online Instructor Certification Program. Although no experience is necessary to participate in the program, only participants who meet the Gracie University quality standard for technical execution and instruction will qualify for Instructor Certification upon completion.\n\nOn this page, we will outline the similarities and differences between the Live Instructor Certification Program and the Online Instructor Certification Program to help you make the best decision for you and your organization. We’ll also discuss the Level 1 Recertification Requirements and the new online recertification opportunity available to you.\n\nOfficer Kevin Manuele on How GST Changed Everything for Him\n\n\"Reduced liability for me and my agency.\"\n\n-Mark Ammerman, Police Officer in Virginia\n\n“Without a doubt, the best training I’ve ever had in any subject.\"\n\n-Danny Savery, Police Officer in Rhode Island\n\n\"Amazing course…especially for women with no previous experience.\"\n\n-Danielle Desanctus, Police Officer in Virginia\n\nGST Live Instructor Certification Program\n\nCost: $1500 Per Participant\n\nSelect Location\n\nThe Level 1 GST Live Instructor Certification Program (Live ICP) is an immersive 5-day course, with eight hours of training per day, totaling 40 hours of instruction. The Live ICP is hosted year-round at various locations throughout the country. Absolutely no experience is necessary to participate in the course, and the techniques are designed to work for anyone regardless of age, gender, or fitness level.\n\nThe first three days of the GST course are dedicated to technical instruction. You will be introduced to all GST techniques in a calm and cooperative setting, and then we will use a series of Reflex Development Drills to develop your muscle memory and build your confidence.\n\nThe fourth day of the course is dedicated entirely to the Gracie Teaching Methodologies that have been perfected over nearly a century. Upon learning the formula, you will have a chance to hone your teaching skills in small focus groups. The last day of the course is when the final evaluation takes place. You will be tested on your techniques and teaching methodologies, and if your performance meets Gracie University standards, you will receive your GST Level 1 Instructor Certification.\n\nQualifications\n\nAbsolutely no experience is necessary to participate in the Level 1 GST Live ICP, and the techniques are designed to work for anyone regardless of age, gender, or fitness level. You must be active-duty military, law enforcement, or a first responder to participate. If you have any questions about your specific situation, feel free to email us at [email protected].\n\nTraining Partners\n\nSince each Live ICP typically attracts 50-150 participants from all over the world, you don’t need to bring a training partner. Although most agencies send two or more instructors to ensure the successful implementation of the GST curriculum at the organization, many participants attend the course alone and have no trouble learning the material. Part of the reason the course is so successful is because we go to great lengths to make sure everyone has a training partner that is best suited for them.\n\nInstructor Handbook\n\nUpon arrival to the Live ICP, you will be given a printed copy of the official GST Instructor Handbook which outlines all the techniques and teaching methods covered during the week. Not only will the handbook help you keep track of everything you learn throughout the week, but it will serve as an invaluable reference when you return home and are expected to teach the GST techniques to your colleagues.\n\nEvaluation Process\n\nDuring the Live ICP, we are evaluating you the entire week. Your techniques, your dedication, your interactions with the other students, etc. At the end of the week, we conduct a series of drills designed to assess your competency in the skills learned and use mock teaching exercises to verify your comprehension of the Gracie Teaching Methodologies. If your performance meets Gracie University standards, you will receive your GST Level 1 Instructor Certification.\n\nCertification Details\n\nUpon successful completion of the Live ICP, you will receive a GST Instructor Certificate, a GST Instructor T-shirt, and a GST Challenge Coin. You will be authorized to teach the GST Level 1 curriculum for 2 years (24 months) within your organization.\n\nOnline GST Access\n\nFor the duration of your certification period, you will have access to the online GST curriculum. The online curriculum is regularly updated with technique improvements and program modifications and features private forums where you can ask questions about techniques and get answers from GST master instructors. This is an invaluable resource, particularly when you are actively teaching GST in your organization.\n\nExpert Witness Support\n\nShould any UOF litigation arise involving the use of the GST techniques within your agency, Gracie University master instructors are willing to testify as subject matter experts on the agency’s behalf, so long as the defensive tactics instructor who taught the officer under investigation holds a valid GST Instructor Certificate.\n\nRecertification\n\nTo maintain your valid GST Instructor Certification you will need to recertify every 24 months. This can be done by attending any Level 1 Live ICP or you can do it online using our Video Evaluation Process. Alternatively, you may choose to complete the GST Level 2 Live ICP which would simultaneously certify you in Level 2 while also serving as your Level 1 recertification.\n\nAction Steps\n\nIf the Live ICP is your preferred method of certification, please take the following steps:\n\nSelect Your Course: Click here to review the list of upcoming course dates and locations.\n\nSave Your Spot: GST courses almost always reach capacity.

If you have any questions about your specific situation feel free to email us at [email protected].\n\nNo Risk 10-day \"Consideration Period\"\n\nGracie University pioneered online jiu-jitsu instruction, particularly when it comes to the use of a Video Evaluation Process for quality assurance. We have been doing online courses/certifications in the civilian sector for over 10 years, and the cumulative results have exceeded all of our expectations! In fact, we have over 270 civilian-operated Certified Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Training Centers worldwide and every one of them was certified “online.” That said, we are very excited to deploy our proven online certification processes in the law enforcement sector, even though we understand that it’s not “customary.” To eliminate any reservations you have regarding this method of learning/certification, we will grant you a 10-day “Consideration Period” when you enroll in the GST Online ICP. If, by the tenth 10th day, you aren’t convinced that the GST Online ICP path is for you, just let us know, and we’ll gladly remove you from the program and issue a full refund. Bottom line: we know it's a new learning format, but we're so confident in the quality of the program that we'll gladly assume any and all risk in order for you to give it a try.\n\nTraining Partners\n\nAll the GST techniques are designed and taught to be practiced with another person, so you will need at least one dedicated training partner in order to complete the Online ICP. Most departments typically send two or more officers to achieve GST certification, since it greatly increases the chances of successful implementation of the GST curriculum at the organization. That said, your selected training partner may be one that is pursuing GST Instructor Certification, but this is not a requirement. Neither you or your training partner need any previous experience to successfully complete the GST Online ICP.\n\nInstructor Handbook\n\nWhen you unlock the Online ICP, you will have the opportunity to download the official GST Instructor Handbook (pdf) which outlines all the techniques and teaching methods covered during the course. We recommend you print the handbook upon beginning the program, so you have a physical copy at your disposal through the learning process. Not only will the handbook help you keep track of everything you learn, but it will serve as an invaluable reference when you are expected to teach the GST techniques to your colleagues.\n\nEvaluation Process\n\nUpon completing the Online ICP, you will need to demonstrate your technique and teaching skills using our Video Evaluation Process. On or before the 60-day deadline, you will upload five (5) separate videos, based on specific criteria we will specify in the Gracie University Online Testing Center. A GST Master Instructor will review the videos and if your performance meets Gracie University standards, you will receive your GST Level 1 Instructor Certification. The first attempt at the Video Evaluation is covered in the cost of the Online ICP. If you fail to submit your evaluation videos on or before the 60-day deadline, or if you do not pass the test, you will have the opportunity to request a 30-day extension (additional fees will apply). Not only would this extend your access to the program for an additional 30 days, it would also give you another opportunity to submit your Video Evaluation. More details can be found in the Testing Center.\n\nOfficer Mason Barnes Uses GST to Survive Grapple with Armed Suspect\n\nCertification Details\n\nUpon successful completion of the Online ICP, you will receive a GST Instructor Certificate, a GST Instructor T-shirt, and a GST Challenge Coin. You will be authorized to teach the GST Level 1 curriculum for 2 years (24 months) within your organization.\n\nOnline GST Access\n\nFor the duration of your certification period, you will have access to the online GST curriculum. The online curriculum is regularly updated with technique improvements and program modifications and features private forums where you can ask questions about techniques and get answers from GST master instructors. This is an invaluable resource, particularly when you are actively teaching GST in your organization.\n\nExpert Witness Support\n\nShould any UOF litigation arise involving the use of the GST techniques within your agency, Gracie University master instructors are willing to testify as subject matter experts on the agency’s behalf, so long as the defensive tactics instructor who taught the officer under investigation holds a valid GST Instructor Certificate.\n\nRecertification\n\nTo maintain your GST Instructor Certification you will need to recertify every 24 months. This can be done by attending any Level 1 Live ICP or you can do it online using our Video Evaluation Process. Alternatively, you may choose to complete the GST Level 2 ICP (online or in person) which would simultaneously certify you in Level 2 while also serving so your Level 1 recertification.\n\nAction Steps\n\nIf the Online ICP is your preferred method of GST Certification, please take the following steps:\n\nSubmit Application & Payment: Since GST is only accessible to active-duty law enforcement, military and first responders, you will need to submit a short application verifying your credentials prior to gaining access to the material. If your training partner also intends to pursue certification, they will need to submit an application of their own.\n\nUnlock the Program: Once we review your application and verify your credentials, you will be accepted into the program and you will have 12 months to unlock the program and begin your training. Once unlocked, on the date of your choosing, you will have 60-days to complete the program.\n\nUpload Your Evaluation Videos: On or before the 60-day deadline, you will upload five (5) videos in the online Testing Center based on the specific GST evaluation criteria we’ve outlined in the program. If your performance meets Gracie University quality standards, you will join the global family of GST Certified Instructors!\n\nGST Level 1 Recertification\n\nCost: $1500\n\nGST is a perishable skill, and as a result, the GST Level 1 certification period lasts exactly two (2) years from the time of course completion. To ensure that all certified instructors are capable of maintaining the Gracie University quality standard within their organizations, and to maintain access to all the benefits offered to certified instructors, we require active instructors to recertify every two years.\n\nHere are the three ways you may choose from to meet your GST Level 1 Instructor Recertification Requirements:\n\n1.

Although most agencies send two or more instructors to ensure the successful implementation of the GST curriculum at the organization, many participants attend the course alone and have no trouble learning the material. Part of the reason the course is so successful is because we go to great lengths to make sure everyone has a training partner that is best suited for them.\n\nInstructor Handbook\n\nUpon arrival to the Live ICP, you will be given a printed copy of the official GST Level 2 Instructor Handbook which outlines all the techniques and teaching methods covered during the week.

In the meantime, get to the GST course as soon as possible, not for the POST credit, but for the best training of your life.\n\nIf you are an officer an IADLEST member state, but complete the GST course in a different state, you will still get POST credit. The only exception to this is if you complete the course in California, since we had to modify the course to meet California POST standards and as a result, you won’t get IADLEST POST credit.\n\nWe created the GST Online Instructor Certification Program so that officers with limited budgets and/or travel restrictions could learn all the GST techniques and get certified to teach GST from anywhere in the world. In order to get POST credit, however, the State Commissions require officers to complete the live in-person courses.\n\nYes, the GST Level 2 course is POST Certified in California, Arizona, Michigan and New Jersey and is pending certification in several other states.\n\nFor any questions about POST credit or if you are positioned to help us achieve POST Certification in any of the states we are not currently certified in, please contact the GST Team by sending an email to: [email protected] or calling 310-893-0400 ext. 3.\n\nTo review upcoming course dates and locations, click here.\n\nEven though GST is growing at an unprecedented rate, we are always looking to partner with new hosting departments/organizations to continue making the course available in as many territories as possible.\n\nThis page is intended to detail the benefits, eligibility requirements and the expectations so that you can make an informed decision as to whether or not hosting is the right option for your organization.\n\nHow to Host a GST Law Enforcement Course (for Free!)\n\nBenefits:\n\nThe host will earn one (1) complimentary slot for every 10 paid slots in the course. It is not uncommon for host agencies to earn 5-8 complimentary slots in a single course. Keep in mind that most or all of the paid slots typically come from outside agencies, so it’s very common for the hosting agency to have no out of pocket expense.\n\nBy becoming a host in a new territory, the GST course becomes available to countless officers in the region who would have never otherwise had access to the system.\n\nIt is common for a GST host to form bonds with many fellow Law Enforcement professionals across the nation as they become part of the large GST family. These bonds often extend beyond DT training as GST agencies commonly partner with each other in a variety of LE subjects/courses.\n\nGracie University does not charge the host agency any fees, unless the host wishes to purchase additional slots beyond the number of complimentary slots that they earn.\n\nEligibility:\n\nThe hosting organization must be a first-responder government agency (federal/local/state/tribal/county/college police/hospital police/etc.).\n\nThere must not be an active GST host already established in the region (contact [email protected] to inquire about availability of the region). If there is no established host in the region, then the first agency that can complete the verification process of Step 1 will get first shot at being the official GST host in the region.\n\nThe standard requirement for host’s facilities is 3400+ square feet of continuous mat space. However, we can start the process with as little as 2000 square feet of continuous mat space with the understanding that the mat space will need to be expanded if the enrollments look like they will outgrow the starting mat space.\n\nAll of the mat space must be in one large room such as a gymnasium. The mats and the facility can be rented or borrowed if not owned by the agency. Often times agencies will ask to use the facility from a local high school or BJJ academy if they don’t have enough space/mats at the police academy.\n\nHost’s facilities must have basic amenities such as restrooms and water fountains.\n\nFor a prospective host that is both interested and qualified, here are the four steps they will need to complete to bring the GST course to fruition:\n\nStep 1: The First 15\n\nSend us a list of 15 individuals who are seriously interested, and qualified, to attend the prospective GST course hosted by your organization. The following individuals are qualified to attend:\n\nFirst Responders who are employed by government agencies.\n\nActive members of the Military and Military reserves.\n\nCorrections officers who are employed by government agencies.\n\n“Seriously interested” is defined as someone who states that they are “highly likely” (90% chance or greater) to attend the course if your agency was to host it.\n\nThis list does not include the complimentary slots that the host will earn.\n\nOnce the list of 15 is compiled, the prospective host will send it to [email protected]. Someone from Gracie University will then vet the list. It is highly recommended to gather more than 15 as it is common for 3-5 of the list to not verify as they advise Gracie University that their status has changed and they will not be likely to attend (this is usually due to: injury, budgetary changes, command changes, staffing shortages, life changes, etc.)\n\nOnce 15 individuals are verified as seriously interested and qualified, Gracie University and the agency will choose a mutually acceptable course date at least 8 months from the date of the completion of this step. Gracie University will then put a temporary hold on that course date (maintaining the hold on the date is contingent on the completion of the subsequent steps).\n\nStep 2: 40 Serious Leads\n\nThe host needs to provide a list of 40 serious leads. This is a continuation of the first step, and the first 15 will count towards the list of 40 qualified, seriously-interested individuals. The agency is usually given 6 weeks to achieve this step. This is often reported as the most challenging step of the process. Once the 40 has been sent in to Gracie University and verified, they can move to step 3.\n\nStep 3: 20 Committed\n\n20 individuals must either pay the tuition or send Gracie University a purchase order. The standard time frame given to complete this step is 45 days from the previous step.\n\nStep 4: 30 Committed\n\n30 individuals must have paid the tuition or sent Gracie University a purchase order. The standard time frame given for completion of this step is 30 days from the previous step. Once 30 people have paid the full tuition, we will add the new GST course to the publicized list of upcoming courses so that officers all over the country will be notified and invited to attend. When this happens, enrollment typically doubles or triples before the course takes place.\n\nBeyond Level 1\n\nIt's a fair amount of work to get the first one going, but almost every host who successfully completes their first GST course, describes it as challenging but well worth it. In fact, after the first course is complete, almost all hosts become repeat hosts for several years thereafter, some agencies have been hosting annual GST courses for over 15 years!\n\nAfter hosting one or more successful GST Level 1 courses, a host may be qualified to host a GST Level 2 Course or a GST Dual Certification Course (Levels 1& 2) at their location so that all the officers in the region can benefit from the complete GST curriculum.\n\nIf you're interested in hosting, we look forward to working with you. If you have any questions, or you'd like to confirm the availability of your territory before getting started, please contact us at [email protected] or call 310-893-0400 ext. 3."
