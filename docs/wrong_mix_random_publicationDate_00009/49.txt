Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni said the actor was unique, since his films broke regional and language barriers.[126] That year, the government of Kerala honoured him for 50 years in Indian cinema during statewide Onam celebrations in Thiruvananthapuram.[127]

Haasan received the Kalaimamani Award from the government of Tamil Nadu in 1979.[128] Other honours include Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, Nandi, Screen and Vijay Awards, including four awards for his performance in Dasavathaaram. In 2009 he was appointed chairman of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Media and Entertainment Business Conclave, organised by FICCI's entertainment division.[129] He is on the academic advisory council for ISFM (International school of Film+Media),[130] and was the first Indian actor invited aboard an American ship as a special friend of the US.[131] In April 2013 he received an award on behalf of Indian cinema from Chris Brown, executive vice-president for conventions and business operations of the National Association of Broadcasters, as part of the New York Festivals International Film & TV Awards.[132] He is one of 20 film celebrities recognised by Coca-Cola India with the launch of the 24th edition of the Limca Book of Records in 2013.[133] Recently honoured with S.

Critique, professional and public perception[]

Mani Ratnam, who directed Haasan in Nayakan, has said that there are many things he can do that no other actor can.[135] Veteran Tamil actor Nagesh called Haasan the best actor he had ever seen.[136] Haasan's contributions to film have been praised by his contemporaries in the Indian film industry, including Sridevi, Amitabh Bachchan, Mohanlal, Venkatesh, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan.[137][138][139][140] Next generation actors (Suriya and Madhavan)[141][142][143] and filmmakers (Bala, Ameer and Gautham Menon) have been inspired by him.[144][145][146]

The animated action sequence in Quentin Tarantino's 2003 film, Kill Bill, was inspired by 2D animated sequences in an Indian film believed to be Aalavandhan.[147][148][149] Hollywood filmmaker Barrie M. Osburne called Haasan's knowledge of literature, history and films "encyclopedic",[150] and Ang Lee said he was stunned by his brilliance and knowledge of films.[151]

Some of his films were inspired from Hollywood films.[152][153] In 2015, Haasan was criticised by the-then Tamil Nadu Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam, who stated that Haasan was "confused" and had "blabbered" unaware of the ground reality for his statement on the government's response to rain relief efforts.[154][155] Haasan was also criticised by Nayakan's producer Muktha Srinivasan for his article in The Hindu taking unnecessary credit for that film.[156]

Haasan has been accused of self-indulgence,[157] and has been criticised for sexually explicit scenes and themes, offensive religious sentiments and superficiality about the social issues depicted in his films.[158][159][160] There have also been complaints about his obsession with perfection, which may have caused some of his films to run over budget.[161][162][163] In November 2017, Haasan said that right wing Hindus have started employing extremism to propagate their communal agenda.[164]
