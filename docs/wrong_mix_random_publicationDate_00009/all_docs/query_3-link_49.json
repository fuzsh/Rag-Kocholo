Over the next three days, the audience packing the Etihad Arena will get to witness several live performances by some of Bollywood’s biggest names, including Salman Khan, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana, Jacqueline Fernandez, Rakul Preet Singh and Nora Fatehi at the main awards, hosted by Abhishek Bachchan and Vicky Kaushal.

There are also three additional special awards.\n\nTaghrid AlSaeed, Executive Director of Group Communications and Destination Marketing, Miral, also believes that the partnership with IIFA will strengthen the bonds between India, Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates (UAE): “It will give a boost to trade, tourism and film production opportunities with Yas Island reinforcing its claim as the fast-growing global entertainment and leisure destination, as well as an international events hub.\n\nHis Excellency Saleh Mohamed Al-Geziry, Director General for Tourism at DCT, Abu Dhabi, points out that, “With an annual gala that is talked about in amazement and wonders for the rest of the year, IIFA has established its mark on the international arena. A galaxy of Bollywood stars will make a beeline for Yas Island next weekend because of IIFA's ability to promote the Indian film industry around the world. This provides us the chance, for the\n\nsecond year in a row, to honour the greatest in talent, glamour, and glamour while showcasing Abu Dhabi's thrilling nightlife, incredible cultural experiences, and restorative getaways to the world.\n\nKamal Haasan will be felicitated for ‘Outstanding Achievement in Indian Cinema’ while the made-for-each-other couple, Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D’Souza, for ‘Outstanding Achievement in Regional Cinema’. Designer Manish Malhotra will also be honoured for ‘Outstanding Achievement in Fashion in Cinema”.\n\nKamal Haasan, 68, began his career as a child artist, at the age of six, in the 1960 Tamil film Kalathur Kannamma, bagging the President’s Gold Medal. He won the first of his four National Awards for his performance as a school teacher whose selfless devotion to a young woman suffering from retrograde amnesia leaves him heartbroken in the 1982 Tamil film, Moondram Pirai, which was remade three years later in Hindi as Sadma.\n\nOver the years, he has distinguished himself as an actor, filmmaker, screenplay writer, playback singer and TV host, working in not just Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam\n\nfilms, but also in the Hindi and Bengali industries. Recipient of the prestigious Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan, Kamal Haasan is one of Indian cinema’s living legends.\n\nReacting to the honour, the maverick genius informs that he has enjoyed a decade-long relationship with IIFA. “I made my debut appearance in Singapore in 2012 when I unveiled the first look of my film, Vishwaroopam. That was pretty special. So, at this one, I will be walking the Green Carpet at Abu Dhabi, humbled by an honour that speaks of the overwhelming love of my audience which urges me to keep making films.”\n\nRiteish Deshmukh flagged off a successful career as an actor with the 2003 romantic drama, Tujhe Meri Kasam. Genelia was his leading lady and they went on to pair up for Masti and Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya, before tying the knot on February 3, 2012. A year later, Riteish launched his own production house, Mumbai Film Company, with the comedy-drama Balak Palak, which won plenty of awards and accolades.\n\nIn 2014, Riteish made his debut in Marathi cinema as an actor, in a double role in Lai Bhaari. Genelia, who also co-produced the action-drama, made a cameo appearance. The film was a blockbuster.\n\nThree years later, the couple produced Faster Fene. With Amey Wagh playing the titular character created by Bhaskar Ramchandra Bhagwat and a favourite with children, the crime thriller enjoyed a successful run.\n\nIn 2018, Genelia produced Mauli which had Riteish in a double role again, playing twin brothers who share the same name. Two years later, he made a special appearance in Adrushya and in 2022, Genelia produced Ved, a romantic drama that reunited them on screen, with Riteish playing her husband. The film was written by Riteish and marked\n\nhis directorial debut. It was the highest-grossing Marathi film of the year, and the third-highest Marathi grosser of all time, surpassing his own Lai Bhaari.\n\nElated with the IIFA special award, Riteish says, “Since I am a Maharashtrian and my roots run deep, I have always wanted to not just act, produce and direct Marathi films, but also push the envelope with respect to content and technical virtuosity. This honour proves that I’ve been successful in my experiments and endeavours to extend the boundaries, as far as Marathi cinema is concerned. I’m grateful to my baiko, Genelia, without whose support this journey would not have been possible.”\n\nAn upbeat Genelia adds, “Riteish has been a part of my film journey since day one. So, it feels great to go up on stage and receive an award that is both a validation and a celebration for us. IIFA, here we come again!”\n\nFashion designer Manish Malhotra has been an integral part of the Hindi film industry for 33 years. He introduced the concept of styling in costume design in Ram Gopal Varma’s 1995 musical romance, Rangeela, and since then, has flagged off many new trends, both on-screen and off it.\n\nIn 2005, the stylist-entrepreneur launched his eponymous label, Manish Malhotra, and today has three flagship stores in Mumbai, Delhi, and Hyderabad. His first international boutique is coming up at the Dubai Mall this year.\n\nManish has also expanded into verticals, like jewellery, and even has his own beauty line. One of the key highlights this year is a fashion show at Sobha Realty IIFA Rocks with Manish showcasing an exclusive “old world charm meets the new world” collection.\n\nRecalling his first appearance at IIFA in 2001, when he received the Best Costume Award for Mohabbatein, Manish says, “The special honour this year shows just how far I have come. A lot has changed since, what hasn’t is the love of the audience which even after three decades continues to drive me to revolutionize and redefine fashion in films.”\n\nSobha IIFA Weekend and NEXA Awards is partnered by Miral and the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi.
