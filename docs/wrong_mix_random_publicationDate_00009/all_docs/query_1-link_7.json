Ahead of the main ceremony, it has been learnt that Kamal Haasan, Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia Deshmukh will be honoured at IIFA 2023.\n\nadvertisement\n\nKAMAL HAASAN TO BE HONOURED ATT IIFA 2023\n\nKamal Haasan will be felicitated for 'Outstanding Achievement in Indian Cinema'. The superstar began his career as a child artist, at the age of six, in the 1960 Tamil film Kalathur Kannamma, bagging the President’s Gold Medal. He won the first of his four National Awards for his performance in the 1982 Tamil film, Moondram Pirai, which was remade three years later in Hindi as Sadma.\n\nOver the years, he has distinguished himself as an actor, filmmaker, screenplay writer, playback singer and TV host, working in not just Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam films, but also in the Hindi and Bengali industries. Recipient of the prestigious Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan, Kamal Haasan is one of Indian cinema’s living legends.\n\nThe maverick genius, who has a decade-long relationship with IIFA, says \"I am extremely honoured and grateful that I have been a part of many IIFAs and they are doing a great job promoting Indian cinema globally and this time I am being honoured at IIFA 2023 at Yas Island, Abu Dhabi. Excited to be present at the event.\"\n\nREAD | Hrithik Roshan to Alia Bhatt, here's confirmed guest list for IIFA 2023\n\nSPECIAL HONOUR FOR RITEISH-GENELIA\n\nOn the other hand, Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia Deshmukh are all set to be honoured for 'Outstanding Achievement in Regional Cinema' at IIFA 2023.\n\nRiteish Deshmukh flagged off a successful career as an actor with the 2003 romantic drama, Tujhe Meri Kasam. Genelia was his leading lady and they went on to pair up for Masti and Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya, before tying the knot on February 3, 2012. A year later, Riteish launched his own production house, Mumbai Film Company, with the comedy-drama Balak Palak, which won plenty of awards and accolades. In 2014, Riteish made his debut in Marathi cinema as an actor, in a double role in Lai Bhaari. Genelia, who also co-produced the action-drama, made a cameo appearance. The film was a blockbuster.\n\nMeanwhile, celebrity fashion designer Manish Malhotra will be honoured for 'Outstanding Achievement in Fashion in Cinema'."
