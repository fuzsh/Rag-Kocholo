My wife has not written me as many love letters in the entire life as LG sahib has in the past six months...,\" Kejriwal said in the tweet. -- PTI\n\nKamal Haasan\n\n23:07 No Hindu faith in Cholas' time: Kamal Haasan\n\nNational award-winning Tamil director Vetrimaaran has sparked controversy by claiming that Raja Raja Cholan wasn't a Hindu king.\n\nNow, Kamal Haasan has backed the director's statement which has opened floodgates for controversial debates regarding the king's identity.\n\nIt all started at an event Vetrimaaran attended where he raised a few eyebrows when he said, \"Raja Raja Chozlan wasn't Hindu but they (BJP) are trying to steal our identity. They have already tried to saffronise Thiruvalluvar. We should never allow that.\"\n\nThen, Kamal Hassan echoed similar sentiments and said, \"There was no name called 'Hindu religion' during Raja Raja Cholan's period. There was Vainavam, Shivam, and Samanam, and it was the British who coined the term Hindu since they didn't know how to refer to it collectively. It is similar to how they changed Thuthukudi into Tuticorin.\"\n\nInterestingly, Vetimaaran's remarks came just a day after the release of the film Ponniyin Selvan: 1 which is based on a fictional novel inspired by Raja Raja Cholan.\n\nAlthough Vetimaaran did find support from Haasan, BJP came all guns blazing at the director.\n\nBJP leader H Raja has stated that Raja Raja Chola was indeed a Hindu king.\n\nHe questioned Vetimaran, \"I am not well versed with history like Vetrimaran, but let him point out two churches and mosques built by Raja Raja Cholan. He called himself Sivapadha Sekaran. Wasn't he a Hindu then?\" -- ANI\n\n22:25 Punjab AAP MLA Bharaj to marry party volunteer on Friday\n\nAam Aadmi Party MLA from Punjab's Sangrur Narinder Kaur Bharaj is slated to marry a party volunteer on Friday.\n\nBharaj (28) will tie the nuptial knot with Mandeep Singh (29) in Patiala.\n\nChief Minister Bhagwant Mann is likely to attend the wedding event, a party leader said on Thursday.\n\nBharaj, a law graduate, had defeated political heavyweight and former minister Vijay Inder Singla in the assembly elections held earlier this year by 36,430 votes. -- PTI\n\nRepresentational image\n\n22:07 Indian origin student killed in US university\n\nA 20-year-old Indian-origin student has been killed in his dormitory in the US state of Indiana and his Korean roommate was taken into custody, according to media reports.\n\nVarun Manish Chheda from Indianapolis, who was studying at Purdue University, was found dead in McCutcheon Hall on the western edge of the campus, the police said on Wednesday.\n\nAnother university student was arrested on a murder charge Wednesday, NBC News quoted the school's police chief as saying.\n\nJi Min Jimmy Sha, a 22-year-old junior cybersecurity major and international student from Korea, called 911 around 12:45 am on Wednesday to alert police about the death, Purdue University Police Chief Lesley Wiete said at a news conference Wednesday morning.\n\nDetails of the call were not disclosed.\n\nAuthorities said the incident happened in a room on the first floor of McCutcheon Hall on the campus in West Lafayette, which is about 104 km northwest of Indianapolis.\n\nChheda, who was studying data science at the university, died of \"multiple sharp force traumatic injuries,\" and the manner of death was homicide, according to preliminary autopsy results.\n\nChief Wiete said she believes the attack was unprovoked and senseless\", Fox News reported.\n\nArunabh Sinha, a childhood friend of Chheda, told NBC News that Chheda had been gaming and talking with friends online on Tuesday night when they suddenly heard screaming on the call.\n\nSinha was not playing with his friends that night, but they told him they heard the attack and didn't know what happened.
