At the big do Kamal Haasan had the honour of meeting the Queen of England. – Elizabeth II.\n\nKamal Haasan took to Facebook and shared details of his meet with the royals...\n\n“The Queen seemed in good health and remembered her visit to India fondly. The Duke of Edinburgh was in great shape and health as well. The exchange was brief as there were too many people. You might remember during Her Majesty’s visit to India, she visited my film set. Probably the only film shooting she had attended in her whole life.\n\nFor those who don’t know, in 1997, when Queen of England made a trip to India, she paid a visit to the Marudhanayagam film set. It was ambitious big budget project based on the life of Marudhanayagam who contributed to the freedom struggle. However, we all know the film didn’t exactly take off due to reported lack of funds. But all the same, the Queen came to MGR film city on October 16, 1997. She was there for all of 20 minutes during which she was shown a short video of a battle scene from the film.”"
