        "text": "Click Here To Promote Anything On The Above Place\n\nMumbai, January 7 - 2023 proved to be a memorable year for the big-ticket entertainers at the box office as films like Pathaan, Jawan, Animal, Jailer, Gadar 2, Leo, Salaar, Tiger 3, and Dunki made the most of the changing dynamics. It was the year when Bollywood roared back with back-to-back blockbusters and regained the lost number 1 position.\n\n2024 is going to be a bit different from the previous year and the onus will be on franchises and sequels to continue the winning streak at the box office. This year could prove to be game-changing for the Indian film sequels and the prospects are already looking bright for them.\n\nFrom Allu Arjun's Pushpa 2 to Akshay Kumar's Welcome To The Jungle, there are several big-ticket sequels lined up for release in 2024 which have the potential to emerge as big blockbusters at the box office, be it domestically or worldwide.\n\nHave a look at some of the most-anticipated Indian film sequels in 2024 -\n\n1. Pushpa - The Rule - Potentially the highest-grossing Indian film of 2024, Pushpa 2 has been the most-anticipated Indian film since the first part was released in 2021. Starring Allu Arjun in the title role alongside Rashmika Mandanna and Fahadh Faasil, this Sukumar's directorial action drama is set for the box office explosion in August 2024 during the Independence Day weekend.\n\n2. Singham Again - Filmmaker Rohit Shetty returns to helm the third instalment of his biggest IP, the Singham franchise, starring Ajay Devgn in the titular role of a fierce cop. The movie boasts a solid star cast in the form of Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Deepika Padukone, and Tiger Shroff. Singham 3 is easily one of the most anticipated Bollywood films of the year. The movie, as of now, is scheduled to clash with Pushpa 2.\n\n3. Welcome To The Jungle (Welcome 3) - Despite the underperformance of the second instalment, Welcome remains one of the iconic comic entertainers in Indian cinema history. The third instalment, titled Welcome To The Jungle, has been in media headlines for many years, and it is finally set to spread the laughter riot during Christmas 2024. Superstar Akshay Kumar returns to headline the film after missing out on the 2nd instalment with an ensemble cast.\n\n4. Stree 2 - One of the biggest success stories of 2018, director Amar Kaushik's horror-comedy Stree is coming with its sequel in 2024. Starring Shraddha Kapoor in the titular role, alongside Rajkummar Rao, Stree 2 could be the dark horse at the box office. Being a sequel to a blockbuster film and part of a popular horror-comedy universe, Stree 2 is one of the films to watch out for in 2024. It is currently scheduled to be released in the month of August.\n\n5. Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 - After the massive success of BB2, Kartik Aaryan reunites with director Anees Bazmee for the next instalment of this popular horror-comedy franchise. Bhool Bhulaiyaa is one of the first horror-comedy franchises of the modern era, and with a super successful history behind it, BB3 is the potential blockbuster on the cards at the box office. It is scheduled to go on floors in March for Diwali 2024 release.\n\n6. Raid 2 - Inspired by real-life events, the sequel to Ajay Devgn-fronted drama thriller was recently announced amid huge anticipation. The original film, based on the real-life income-tax raid conducted by the officers of the Income Tax Department on Sardar Inder Singh in the 1980s, was a big hit at the box office and the expectations will be double from its sequel this time around. The filming has already commenced for the November release.\n\n7. Indian 2 - Legendary Kamal Haasan reunited with visionary director S Shankar for the sequel to their vigilante action film, Indian. It is shaping up to be one of the keenly-awaited films from Tamil cinema. Reports suggest it will be split into two parts and both of them will be released in 2024. Indian 2 will reportedly be released in April or May 2024 in multiple languages.\n\n8. L2: Empuraan - If there is one Malayalam film that can go Pan India, that is superstar Mohanlal's action thriller L2: Empuraan which is the sequel to one of the all-time biggest blockbusters of Malayalam cinema, Lucifer (2019). Directed by Prithviraj Sukumaran, the movie is currently on floors and is planned for its December 2024 release nationwide in multiple languages.\n\nStay tuned..."
