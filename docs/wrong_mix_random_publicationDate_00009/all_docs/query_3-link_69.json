He was awarded the Kalaimamani Award in 1984, the Padma Shri in 1990, the Padma Bhushan in 2014 and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Chevalier) in 2016. Haasan is also known for having starred in the most number of films submitted by India in contention for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

After beginning as a child actor, Haasan's breakthrough was with the film Apoorva Raagangal (1975), playing the role of a rebellious youth in love with an older woman. He secured his second National Film Award for his performance in the romantic drama Moondram Pirai (1982), and later won acclaim for his performance in Mani Ratnam's epic crime drama Nayagan (1987), which was ranked in TIME magazine's \"All-Time 100 Movies\" list.
