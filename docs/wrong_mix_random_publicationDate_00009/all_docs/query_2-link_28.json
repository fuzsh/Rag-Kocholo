        "text": "Meet Niamh Moore, Market Lead in the UK. Let's learn more about Niamh. Tell us a little bit more about yourself! When I was younger I had dreams of studying costume design at university, but I ended up studying English Literature instead (I love to read, too!). I still craft in my spare time - mostly crochet and macrame. My fiancé and I recently bought our first home, so I’m going to invest in a sewing machine and get back into my textiles! If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would it be and why? I love to backpack, so there’s so many places on my bucket list. Currently I’d say India is top. The culture, vibrancy and architecture fascinates me. I also love hiking and India has some breathtaking scenery. For any Shantaram fans, I’d definitely do a Shantaram tour in Mumbai!"
