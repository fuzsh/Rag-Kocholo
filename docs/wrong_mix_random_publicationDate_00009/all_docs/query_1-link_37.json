        "meta_description": "Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, passed away on September 8th. While the world is mourning her demise, we stumbled upon an old picture of the queen when she graced the launch event of Kamal Haasan's most ambitious, unfinished film 'Marudhanayagam.' Back in 1997, Kamal Haasan invited Elizabeth II as the chief guest, and the queen visited MGR film city, where a battle scene from the film got screened for her. Queen spent 20 minutes on the film's sets and was left mighty impressed. However, her presence at the launch event also sparked controversy as many questioned the queen's intentions as the film attempted to denounce the British.
