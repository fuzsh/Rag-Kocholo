        "text": "To paraphrase Dr. King, if the most urgent, persistent question in life is ‘What are you doing for others?’ Amy Brenneman and Brad Silberling have got it covered. Recognizing the social responsibility that comes with celebrity and the importance of using their collective voice for the greater good, Silberling and Brenneman set a high bar, embodying the change they hope to see in the world.\n\nEmmy and Golden Globe nominated actor, writer, producer and blogger, Brenneman is best known for The Leftovers, Judging Amy, NYPD Blue, Private Practice, and Heat. Silberling is a director, producer, and writer who has distinguished himself in feature films as well as TV (Reign, City of Angels, Lemony Snicket: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Moonlight Mile, Ten Items or Less, NYPD Blue, Jane the Virgin).\n\nBrenneman is a spokesperson for Healthy Child, Healthy World and has participated in numerous programs to educate the public about children’s health. Autism Speaks, Eracism Foundation, and Room to Read have all benefited from her efforts. Long time advocate for the Feminist Majority and NARAL Pro-Choice America, she has traveled to Peru, advocating for mothers and infants as an ambassador for CARE, the humanitarian organization devoted to fighting poverty. Outspoken Center for Reproductive Rights activist, Brenneman understands the responsibilities of motherhood and the importance of a woman’s right to choose. She is a founding member of the Cornerstone Theater Company and through her involvement with Women in Film, she spends her time encouraging generations of women to explore careers in the entertainment industry.\n\nSilberling is actively involved as a mentor at the Sundance Institute. Since 2010 he has committed to sharing his talents with aspiring filmmakers. He is also an active member of the Director’s Guild of America, where he sits on leadership councils concerned with, among other issues, violence and social responsibility.\n\nTogether, Brenneman and Silberling have moved well beyond installing solar panels and going organic. In 2007 the couple received the Help Humanitarian Award from the Help Group, an innovative nonprofit that serves children with special needs related to autism spectrum disorder, learning disabilities, ADHD, developmental delays, abuse and emotional challenges.\n\nBoth are actively involved with CHIME, their children’s school (a national leader and unique model of inclusive education). Together, they teach a graduate course about the art of creative collaboration at the UCLA School of Film and Television. They are longtime supporters of The Brady Campaign to Control Gun Violence and of the Los Angeles Children’s Hospital.\n\nWe celebrate their forward thinking and selfless efforts and the classy way that they remind us that giving back never goes out of style.\n\n."
