You will insult the government or the people who gave you the award with love. That will bring attention to it but there are many more ways,\" said the 60-year-old actor.\n\n\"They are talented people. Just one article by them will bring more attention than returning the awards. They should keep the awards, make us proud and continue to fight any government that is not tolerant enough,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked whether Haasan, who is in the city to promote his upcoming film \"Thoonga Vanam\", would ask the filmmakers to not give back the awards, the actor said he was not sure it will make any difference.\n\n\"'Mere bolne se thodi vo sunenge' (My appeal won't make a difference). We hope they don't get too angry. It is on their part also necessary to be a little more tolerant. Tolerance is give and take. I am not criticising any party but this is nothing new to India. It will surmount this also, as it has done before,\" he said.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
