        "text": "In the Tamil film industry, the name K Balachander will always be special and transcend the time zones. Therefore, when an award is instituted in his name, the recipient should also be a trailblazer, an avant-garde creator just like the veteran. And who better than Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan to adorn this special award named K Balachander Gold Medal for Excellence in Indian Cinema?\n\nClad in a long grey kurta and black pants with a twirled moustache, Kamal Haasan was as usual at his dashing best on 19th July at the Behindwoods Gold Awards event held at the ITC Grand Chola, Chennai.\n\nThe award was bestowed upon the actor by legendary old timer A.C.Thirulogachander. The audience sure missed KB, and a 3D animated video of the legend made many eyes go moist and choke with feelings.\n\nWhen Kamal spoke, he recalled his days with Thirulogachander and said that he was one of the tallest directors around. He furthered that it was a welcome relief to be at an award show without the usual dance rigmaroles. On KB, he said, “Artists are bound to be proud people. I do feel proud when I look at people who have not been trained under KB sir and realize how fortunate I am.”"
