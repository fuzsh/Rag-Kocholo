In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n(5) Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connexion with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.\n\n(6) Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 13 — Capital Gains\n\n(1) Gains from the alienation of immovable property, as defined in paragraph (2) of Article 6, may be taxed in the Contracting State in which such property is situated.\n\n(2) Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing professional services, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or together with the whole enterprise) or of such a fixed base, may be taxed in the other State.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this Article, gains from the alienation of ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships and aircraft shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.\n\n(4) Gains from the alienation of any property other than those mentioned in paragraphs (1) and (2), shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.\n\nArticle 14 — Independent Personal Services\n\n(1) Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other independent activities of a similar character shall be taxable only in that State unless he has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities.

the exemption from, or reduction of, Portuguese tax was first granted in respect of that source.\n\n(3) United Kingdom tax payable under the laws of the United Kingdom and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, on income or capital gains derived from sources within the United Kingdom by a resident of Portugal shall be allowed as a deduction from the Portuguese

gains charged to Portuguese tax; or\n\n(b) The proportion of the Portuguese tax before any such deduction which the amount of such income or capital gains charged to Portuguese tax bears to the total income or capital gains chargeable to Portuguese tax.\n\n(4) Where profits on which an enterprise of a Contracting State has been charged to tax in that State are also included in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to that enterprise of the other Contracting State if the conditions made between each of the enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, the amount of such profits included in the profits of both enterprises shall be treated for the purpose of this Article as income from a source in the other Contracting State of the enterprise of the first-mentioned Contracting State and credit shall be given accordingly in respect of the extra tax chargeable in the other Contracting State as a result of the inclusion of the said amount.\n\n(5) For the purposes of this Article, profits or remuneration for personal (including professional) services performed in one of the Contracting States shall be deemed to be income from sources within that State, and the services of an individual whose services are wholly or mainly performed in ships or aircraft shall be deemed to be performed in the Contracting State in which is situated the place of the effective management of the enterprise operating the ships or aircraft.\n\nArticle 23 — Non-Discrimination\n\n(1) The nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected.\n\n(2) The term “nationals” means:\n\n(a) In relation to the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) All citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies other than those citizens who derive their status as such from connexion with any territory to which this Convention may

Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of that first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.\n\n(5) Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident, nor as restricting the right of either Contracting State to tax in accordance with Article 10 dividends paid to a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State.\n\nArticle 24 — Mutual Agreement\n\n(1) Where a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Convention, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident.\n\n(2) The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention.\n\n(3) The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.\n\n(4) The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of

authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for the carrying out of this Convention and of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by this Convention insofar as the taxation there under is in accordance with this Convention.

Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, as may be specified and agreed between the Contracting States in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels.\n\n(2) Unless otherwise agreed by both Contracting States, the denunciation of the Convention by one of them under Article 29 shall terminate, in the manner provided for in that Article, the application of the Convention to any territory or part to which it has been extended under this Article.\n\nArticle 28 — Entry Into Force\n\n(1) This Convention shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged at London as soon as possible.\n\n(2) The Convention shall enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification and its provisions shall have effect:\n\n(a) In the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) As respects income tax, surtax and capital gains tax for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6th April in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force;\n\n(ii) As respects corporation tax for any financial year beginning on or after 1st April in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force.\n\n(b) In Portugal:\n\nAs respects Portuguese tax on profits, income or capital gains arising on or after 1st January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force.\n\nArticle 29 — Termination\n\nThis Convention shall remain in force until denounced by one of the Contracting States.
