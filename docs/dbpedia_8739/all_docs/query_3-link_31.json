Then, you can use that definition to learn more about examples of constitutional monarchies.\n\nRelated: US Constitution & Government\n\nConstitutional Monarchy Definition\n\nThe constitutional monarchy definition states this type of government uses the nation’s constitution to limit the powers of the monarchy.\n\nA monarchy has a ruler, and most fill that role with a king or queen.\n\nWhile a monarch may have some power, the constitution dictates what the monarch can and can’t do.\n\nConstitutional Monarchy Examples and Facts\n\nThere are many constitutional monarchies around the world. Here are some examples and facts about each one.\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is probably the most famous constitutional monarchy. Currently, the monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, and she has been the monarch since 1952.\n\nAlong with the United Kingdom, the constitutional monarchy includes the Commonwealth Realm. Because of this, many other countries share the same monarchy.\n\nCountries include:\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\n\nBarbados\n\nBelize\n\nGrenada\n\nJamaica\n\nCanada\n\nAustralia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nSolomon Islands\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nSt. Lucia\n\nSt. Kitts and Nevis\n\nThe Bahamas\n\nTuvalu\n\nSome of these countries are in the Americas, while others are in Oceania. Each country in the Commonwealth has a prime minister or representative.\n\nHowever, the British monarch is the head of state for these other countries.\n\nOthers in Europe\n\nWhile the United Kingdom is perhaps the most famous constitutional monarchy, other European nations share the same form of government.\n\nBelgium has a constitutional monarchy, and the current head of state is King Philippe.

The monarch has had more power in the past, but the country has started to become more democratic thanks to changes to the constitution.\n\nAfter a switch between an absolute monarchy and constitutional monarchy, Cambodia has settled on the latter.\n\nHowever, people in the country should not insult the king because that is a sign that someone may try to overthrow the monarchy.\n\nIn Jordan, the monarchy has power over the various branches of government. The king appoints the prime minister, but the parliament has to approve the appointment.\n\nKuwait has a more open constitutional monarchy than other monarchies in the region.

While the king is in charge of the armed forces, he has to work with the parliament to successfully rule the country.\n\nThailand’s monarchy has faced criticism and controversy, but it still follows the constitution. Succession follows the family line, and the monarch helps the government and the people.\n\nAfrica\n\nWhile Africa doesn’t have as many monarchies as other continents, there are some. Below are some African countries with a constitutional monarchy.\n\nLesotho’s current monarch is King Letsie III. He has served as the king since 1997, and his wife serves as the monarch when he is out of the country.\n\nIn Morocco, the monarch has struggled to balance his power with that of the parliament.
