        "text": "Measles cases are increasing globally, including in the United States. The majority of measles cases imported into the United States occur in unvaccinated U.S. residents who become infected during international travel. A list of countries with confirmed measles outbreaks can be found on the Global Measles Travel Health Notice (THN). Measles spreads rapidly in communities that are not fully vaccinated and may pose a risk to international travelers in places not included in the THN. CDC recommends all travelers get fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to any international destination."
