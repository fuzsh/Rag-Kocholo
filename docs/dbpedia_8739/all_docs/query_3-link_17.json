        "text": "The Monarchy in Canada\n\nThe positions of Head of State and Head of Government are held by separate people. The Prime Minister is the Head of Government, and the Monarch â currently His Majesty King Charles III â is the Head of State.\n\nThe Monarchâs powers and responsibilities are established and limited by the Canadian Constitution and several other laws.\n\nCanada shares its Monarch with several other Commonwealth realms such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Monarchâs role within each country is unique and independent from the others.\n\nHead of State vs. Head of Government\n\nIn some countries, such as the United States and Mexico, the Head of State and the Head of Government are the same person.\n\nIn Canada, the Head of State has important constitutional responsibilities but no political role. They are strictly non-partisan (not affiliated with any political party or platform).\n\nThe Head of Government is a political figure who leads Cabinet.\n\nThe Role of the Governor General\n\nThe Governor General is the Monarchâs representative in Canada. They are appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister. Although the Constitution does not assign a fixed term to the position, a new Governor General is usually appointed every five years.\n\nThe Governor General has four main areas of responsibility: constitutional duties, presentation of honours, military duties and ceremonies.\n\nConstitutional Duties\n\nThe Governor General performs the positionâs constitutional responsibilities in a non-partisan way, guided by the Constitution, by convention and by the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nThese responsibilities include:\n\nproroguing Parliament (ending a session)\n\ndissolving Parliament and calling an election\n\nsummoning a new Parliament after an election\n\nswearing the Prime Minister and Cabinet into office\n\nreading the Speech from the Throne, which sets out the governmentâs agenda at the beginning of each session of Parliament\n\ngranting Royal Assent, which is the final step in the legislative process, when a bill becomes law\n\nPresentation of Honours\n\nThe Governor General travels widely to encourage and acknowledge individuals and groups who have made substantial contributions to Canada. They also present honours and awards to people who have demonstrated excellence.\n\nMilitary Duties\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief of Canada, the Governor General plays an important role in recognizing the contribution of the Canadian Armed Forces and their families. The Governor General visits Canadian military members posted overseas, attends ceremonies for fallen members and honours veterans on Remembrance Day.\n\nCeremonies\n\nThe Governor General welcomes visiting heads of state and other important visitors to Canada. They also accept the credentials (official documents) of new ambassadors and high commissioners who represent their respective countries in Canada. During state visits abroad, they lead delegations and meet with other prominent officials to promote Canada on the international stage.\n\nThe Governor General is also the head of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, which grants coats of arms and other heraldic emblems to Canadian individuals and organizations.\n\nReserved Powers of the Monarch\n\nThe Governor General exercises all the powers and responsibilities of the Monarch, except for some that can only be performed directly by the Monarch, including the following:"
