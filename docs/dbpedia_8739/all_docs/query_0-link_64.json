        "text": "GEOGRAPHY\n\nSpecific Objectives and Competences\n\nTo understand the political systems of the European countries.\n\nTo identify the main differences between Europe’s different political systems\n\nContents\n\nThe systems of government of the EU can be divided into three types:\n\nConstitutional Monarchies: Belgium, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxemburg and the United Kingdom.\n\nFederal Republics: Germany and Austria.\n\nCentralised Republics: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Malta, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Franca, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n\nIn the constitutional monarchies, the head of state is the monarch, who has no truly political powers, whose main function is to represent the state.\n\nIn contrast, in the republics, the head of state is chosen by the citizens, either directly or through the parliament. The difference between the centralised and federal republics lies in the level of political decentralisation.\n\nIn the former, the regions have only limited competences and it is the central government that decides on the majority of issues. However, in the federal republics, the regions have a larger number of competences and also have legislative assemblies.\n\nThere are also other cases in which it is relatively difficult to classify a country based on its political organisation. For example, in Belgium there is a parliamentary monarchy established in conjunction with a federal state. In the case of Spain, the autonomous communities have been devolved powers that are comparable with those of many federal states.\n\nDebates\n\nBased on the national sides of the 2 euro coins, which bear the iconographic symbols of each member state (bg, da, et, cs, de, el, es, en, fr, it, lv, lt, hu, mt, nl, pl, pt, ro, sl, sk, fi, sv)\n\nIs it possible to identify the systems of government of the countries of the EU?\n\nDocuments\n\n>15 Division of powers between the European Union, the member states, and the regional and local authorities (en).
