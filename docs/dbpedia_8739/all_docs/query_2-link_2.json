        "text": "The country’s modern-day democracy was born between 1974 and 1976, the period between the Carnation Revolution (which brought down the authoritarian regime of the Estado Novo) and the promulgation of the country’s democratic Constitution. In the years since, Portugal has strengthened the independence of the judiciary by introducing multiple reforms to guide the transformation towards a citizen-centered system, and balanced the power of the executive and legislative through a strong regime of checks and balances.\n\nCurrent Portuguese politics are characterized by a cost of living and housing crisis, as well as struggles with corruption, including in top executive functions of the government. Additionally, despite an extensive anti-corruption legal and institutional framework, the country struggles with its implementation, efficiency and accessibility, particularly to improve public access to information.\n\nPopular discontent due to lower wages and rising uncertainty have changed Portugal’s political landscape after years of stability. Additionally, populist attitudes and anti-immigration sentiments have been amplified after recent elections. Despite the approval of a National Plan to combat racism and discrimination, which focuses on the country’s colonial legacy, both issues persist. Immigrants from former colonies, such as Brazilians and people of African descent, as well as Roma continue to experience disproportionately high rates of housing deprivation relative to the rest of the population and struggle to access essential services. Additionally, the Council of Europe has raised concerns about police violence towards minorities and ill-treatment of prisoners in Portugal, especially against people of African descent.\n\nPortugal performs in thehigh-range in Gender Equality, but the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted the absence of a law prohibiting femicide and an increase in dismissals of pregnant women from employment. Portugal has seen recent advances in LGBTQIA+ rights, such as the passage of legislation enabling legal gender recognition based on self-determination and prohibiting health services from discriminating between blood donors based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nLooking ahead, it will be important to watch both Access to Justice and Predictable Enforcement, particularly in view of issues with drawn-out investigations and court judgments leading to delayed accountability for corruption cases. It will also be important to watch Rights, especially in light of reported cases of discrimination against marginalized groups, but also following important signals of improvement. These include amendments to the penal code to protect victims of crimes against sexual freedom and a strategy for better integration of Roma communities. Finally, it will be crucial to monitor Economic Equality, due to the role of youth unemployment and high inflation in fueling rising discontent."
