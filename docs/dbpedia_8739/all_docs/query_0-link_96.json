From what little I have read, I would assume you have to incite a rebellion in your capitol province. Is this true? If so, it seems pretty lame to me, like the game was not designed to have players changing their government. If it was then there would be an option to do so. It seems ridiculous to me to incite a rebellion in your own country if you are the ruler...At the very least it is very gamey.",
