the ancient Phoenicians long exploited the Iberian Peninsula for its mineral wealthconventional long form: Portuguese Republic\n\nconventional short form: Portugal\n\nlocal long form: Republica Portuguesa\n\nlocal short form: Portugal\n\netymology: name derives from the Roman designation \"Portus Cale\" meaning \"Port of Cale\";

it may have been founded as an ancient Celtic settlement that subsequently maintained close commercial relations with the Phoenicians (beginning about 1200 B.C.); the name of the settlement may have been derived from the pre-Roman appellation for the Tagus River that runs through the city, Lisso or Lucio; the Romans named the city \"Olisippo\" when they took it from the Carthaginians in 205 B.C.; under the Visigoths the city name became \"Ulixbona,\" under the Arabs it was \"al-Ushbuna\"; the medieval version of \"Lissabona\" became today's Lisboa Administrative divisions17 autonomous communities (comunidades autonomas, singular - comunidad autonoma) and 2 autonomous cities* (ciudades autonomas, singular - ciudad autonoma);
