        "text": "For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the other countries, the date given may not represent \"independence\" in the strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form of government, or state succession. For a number of countries, the establishment of statehood was a lengthy evolutionary process occurring over decades or even centuries; in such cases, several significant dates are cited. Dependent areas include the notation \"none\" followed by the nature of their dependency status. See also the Terminology definition."
