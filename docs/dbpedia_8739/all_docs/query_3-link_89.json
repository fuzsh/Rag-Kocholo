They collected tax on their own, they put taxes on imported goods as they pleased, and they built many expensive places. “But his expenses are six millions, and this excess is covered by extraordinary taxes according to his pleasure (Document 3),” this explains that the monarchs could spend more than they received, they could raise taxes “according to his pleasure,” and they are in control of collecting, spending, and raising taxes. “The tsar, in order to reform that custom, ordered that\n\nRoyal absolutism is a form of monarchy in which one ruler has supreme authority and where that authority is not restricted by any written laws, legislature, or customs. There are many monarchical absolutist rulers however most of them are non- memorable. Two rulers I found to be most memorable is Louis XIV of France and Ivan the terrible of Russia. At 4 years old Louis XIV inherited the crown. After his mentor Cardinal Jules Mazarin, Louis XIV decided to take full authority of the throne.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1600 's, monarchial systems of both England and France were changing. Three royal figure throughout history who all tried to establish a role of absolutism in their societies all of them had varying factors with the greatest success from least to greatest being Charles I, Louis XIV, and Peter the Great. Absolutism is a form of government where a king or queen rules with unrestricted powers. They are often followed in heredity by passing on the leadership through bloodlines. All over the world these bloodlines still exist except, that most of them only remain as a symbolic figure or a person of fame. A couple of monarchs that still rule are Brunei, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Swaziland, the emirates comprising the UAE, and Vatican City.\n\nAbsolutism pertains to an absolutist state, where all power, or sovereignty is made in the ruler. These rulers claimed to have divine right, meaning they ruled by the grace of God and were responsible only to God. However, these absolute monarchs respected the basic laws of the land. They controlled interest groups within their territories and created bureaucracies as well, in which the offices held public/state positions, directing the economy to the benefit of the king. Absolute monarchs also kept\n\nAccording to the text book, an absolute monarch is a king or queen who has unlimited power and seeks to control all aspects of society (McDougall little, 1045). In more simple terms, it is a ruler who can do just about anything without having to get permission from anyone, or having to worry about the repercussions. This was a trend that started in the 1600’s by European leaders who were rich, and didn’t\n\nIn 17th-18th century Europe, the age of absolutism, absolute monarchs ruled most of Europe. Absolute monarchs are rulers that have complete control over the government and its people. They claimed to rule by “divine right,” where their authority comes from God and they were above the law. The views of being a proper role as an absolute monarch differed very much between rulers and their subjects. Certain rulers had ideas that both the people and ruler should be united, some abused their power with no sympathy towards the people they rule, and the subjects that suffered from the rulings of the monarch had a completely different perspective than the rulers that were in power.\n\nAn absolute monarch is a ruler by divine right who has control over every portion of his kingdom. The most famous absolute monarch, Louis XIV, had the longest reign of any of the French kings. Louis achieved this as a result of his reformed laws, foreign policy, a smart economic advisor, and his decision to deny power to the nobility. Although some of these ideas could be viewed as having a negative impacting on France, overall Louis XIV's absolute government was beneficial to the development of his country.\n\nAnswer: Absolutism hold the supreme or absolute powers and constitutionalism is the head of state and a hereditary or elected monarch. Absolutism is when the King or Queen rules with absolute and total power. Which basically makes them a dictator. A King or Queen of constitutionalism has limited powers since they rule along with a parliament or a governing body. An absolute monarch is entitled to make all the economic and other state-related decisions for the country whereas in the constitutional monarchy, the parliament is responsible for the economic and foreign affairs. A absolute monarch is not legally bound, a constitutional monarch is legally bound by the constitution of their country. The absolute monarch gains powers either from hereditary or from marriage. The constitutional monarch is either elected directly or indirectly.\n\nThe seventeenth century saw the evolution of two new types of government mainly because of the instability that was caused by religious wars. One type of government was a constitutional monarchy in which rulers were confined to the laws of the state, giving the people some liberties, best exemplified by William and Mary during the Stuart monarchial rule. Constitutional monarchy was successful in mainly in England because of the Magna Carta, which kept the king’s power in check. The other type was absolute monarchy, in which the king has power over everything, shown by the French under Louis XIV. Although these two\n\nDuring the late 1400s and 1500s, many rulers took great measures to centralize political power and place it in their own hands. This lead to the occurrence of absolute monarchies, some of which I thought were overall very effective. In absolute monarchies, theoretically the monarch is all-powerful, with no legal limitations to his or her authority. Absolutism in Europe was characteristically justified by the doctrine of divine right, according to which the monarch reigns all-powerfully by the will of God. The intention of absolute monarchs is to utilize his or her power in an effective, better-organized way, despite its weaknesses or negative consequences; and from my perspective, I would have to say\n\nThere is a lot of nations who unlikely to us count with Kings and Dictators. In England Queen Elizabeth II, has not much power over decision or passing laws for example, the prime minister and the parliament are in charge on this because there monarchy believes in constitution. On the other hand there is dictators like Fidel Castro who ruled Cuba for more than five decades, assigning his position to his brother Raul Castro. He became the only party who will rule Cuba, but the most famous one who made horror in history was Adolf Hitler. Close to this way of ruling a country is the novel 1984 by author George Orwell. On his book Orwell talks about the danger and possibilities of living under a regiment and how the basic rights and freedom can be taken away. Currently every single citizen in the United States count with rights and freedoms. This is called The Constitution of the United States that was signed on September 17, 1787 and presented by George Washington. Based on the Constitution there is articles and amendments missing in the novel 1984 and how those missing amendments and articles make our society free and democratic."
