The constitution allocates the rest of the government’s power to the legislature and judiciary. Britain became a constitutional monarchy under the Whigs; other constitutional monarchies include Belgium, Cambodia, Jordan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Thailand.”\n\nAtlas topic, subject, and course\n\nConstitutional Framework (core topic) in Governance and Institutions and Atlas100 Governance and Institutions.\n\nSource\n\nEncyclopaedia Britannica, Constitutional monarchy, at https://www.britannica.com/topic/constitutional-monarchy, accessed 15 August 2016.\n\nWikipedia, Republic, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic, accessed 15 August 2016."
