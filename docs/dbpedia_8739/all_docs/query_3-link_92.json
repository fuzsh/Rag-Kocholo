        "text": "Under the terms of Article 3 of the Constitution, the Crown of the Grand Duchy is hereditary in the Nassau family, in accordance with the Pact of 30 June 1783, Article 71 of the Treaty of Vienna of 9 June 1815, and Article 1 of the Treaty of London of 11 May 1867.\n\nThe Congress of Vienna of 1815 ceded the Grand Duchy to the King of the Netherlands, William I, Prince of Orange-Nassau, 'to be possessed in perpetuity by him and his successors in complete ownership and sovereignty'. The Final Act of the Congress thus applied the order of succession established between the two branches of the House of Nassau by the Pact of 1783 to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nWhile the first chapter of the Family Pact of 1783 describes the sovereign possessions of the House of Nassau, the second chapter is devoted to the order of succession. At that time, the Crown was transmitted according to Salic law in direct line by order of primogeniture to male descendants, excluding female descendants. In the absence of a male descendant in direct and collateral line in one of the branches of the House of Nassau, the Crown passed by right to the male descendants of the other branch. In the absence of male offspring in direct and collateral line in both branches, the Crown passed in order of primogeniture to the female offspring of the ruling dynasty.\n\nThe Treaty of London of 1867 redefined the status of the Grand Duchy. Napoleon III tried to acquire Luxembourg, but failed because of Bismarck's refusal to allow a former member of the German Confederation to fall under French rule. At the time, the City of Luxembourg was still occupied by a Prussian federal garrison. Following the 'Luxembourg Crisis', an international conference was organised in London to prevent a French-Prussian war. Prussia agreed to withdraw its garrison from the fortress of Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy was declared perpetually neutral. Article 1 of the treaty maintained the ties between the Grand Duchy and the House of Orange-Nassau and confirmed the rights that the agnates (the descendants by male links from a common male ancestor) of the House of Nassau have over the Grand Duchy.\n\nThe order of succession, as set down in the Family Pact, has been amended twice since then.\n\nIn 1906, Grand Duke Guillaume IV sensed that his health was worsening and that the question of who would succeed him would soon arise, since six daughters were born from his marriage to Maria Ana of Braganza. He therefore issued a new family statute to guarantee his daughters’ succession to the throne. This statute was based on Article 42 of the Family Pact, which stipulated that after the extinction of all the male members of the House of Nassau, the female line of succession would come into play. The 1907 statute also stipulated that the younger princesses would be next in line if there were no male descendant of Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde. Princess Marie-Adélaïde was declared heir apparent to the Crown. This statute was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, which gave it the force of law on 10 July 1907.\n\nOn 20 June 2011, by order of Grand Duke Henri, the Marshal of the Court announced a new internal regulation introducing absolute primogeniture to the order of succession within the House of Luxembourg-Nassau. This guarantees equality between men and women in terms of succession to the Throne. This new order of succession first applies to the descendants of Grand Duke Henri."
