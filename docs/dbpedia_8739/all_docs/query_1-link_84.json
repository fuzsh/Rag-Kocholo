        "text": "Luis Montenegro has been appointed prime minister of Portugal, the presidency said in a press release late Wednesday, March 20, after his right-wing Democratic Alliance party won the parliamentary elections on March 10.\n\nThe 51-year-old lawyer by training and seasoned parliamentarian succeeds the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa, who was in power since 2015 but did not have a stable parliamentary majority.\n\nPortugal has named its new prime minister on Wednesday once the final results of its March 10 election were announced after the counting of overseas ballots. After a narrow win, Luis Montenegro, the leader of the center-right Democratic Alliance (AD), was expected to be appointed as Portugal's next prime minister, succeeding socialist Antonio Costa.\n\nPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa received Montenegro at the presidential palace on Wednesday evening, before the overseas results were completed. Montenegro said that he told Sousa that his party was ready to take charge of the government and, \"as a consequence of that, to be named prime minister\".\n\nThe meeting was the final step of consultations Sousa was due to hold with the parties represented in parliament before inviting the election winner to form the next government.\n\nNear-complete official results showed the AD won 29.5 percent of the vote and at least 79 seats, far short of a majority in the 230-seat parliament. The incumbent Socialist Party (PS), in power for eight years, came in second place, winning at least 77 seats.\n\nEven with the backing of the tiny business-friendly Liberal Initiative (IL) party, the AD would still need the support of the anti-immigration party Chega to reach a majority of 116 seats in the assembly.\n\nCoalition with Chega ruled out\n\nHowever, Montenegro has ruled out forming a coalition with Chega, which took 48 seats, insisting that he intends to form a minority government. Chega's leader Andre Ventura warned of political instability if the AD continued to reject a coalition. \"We are continuing to put in all our efforts... to reach an agreement that will ensure the country's stability,\" Ventura said on Monday. \"If there is no government agreement, the AD will be responsible for the instability that will result.\"\n\nPartner service\n\nLearn French with Gymglish\n\nThanks to a daily lesson, an original story and a personalized correction, in 15 minutes per day.\n\nTry for free\n\nA minority administration will \"not necessarily\" be unstable because \"none of the actors has an interest in triggering a crisis\", said Antonio Costa Pinto, an analyst from the University of Lisbon's Institute of Social Sciences.\n\nThe election results marked another advance for the far right in Europe, where populist and nationalist parties are either already governing – often in coalitions – in countries such as Italy, Hungary, and Slovakia, or are steadily gaining as in France and Germany.\n\nChega, which means \"Enough\", calls for stricter controls over immigration, tougher measures to fight corruption, and chemical castration for some sex offenders.\n\nLe Monde with AFP"
