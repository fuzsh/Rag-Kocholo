        "text": "Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth was a fan favorite when it came out, if only because it was the first time we really got to see Pinhead unleashed upon our world with reckless abandon. Though it wasn’t always supposed to be that way…\n\nWhile chatting with Doug Bradley on Brainwaves last night, Bradley brought Clive Barker’s original idea for the film to light…\n\n“Clive had a plan for a third Hellraiser movie which he was working on while we were filming Hellbound that didn’t involve Pinhead at all,” Bradley tells us. “It was a story set in Ancient Egypt. The Great Pyramid was the first Lament Configuration that was built to raise the great Pharaoh, who was the first Cenobite.”\n\nAs it stands, Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth has yet to make it to Blu-ray here in the States, and to make matters worse, all we have is the R-rated cut. Maybe one day this devil will get its due."
