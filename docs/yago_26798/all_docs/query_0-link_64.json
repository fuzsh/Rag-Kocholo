        "text": "The traveler of multiple realms, it's no surprise that Pinhead is no stranger to the panels of comic books. His return to the medium this time is via BOOM! Studios' mini-series, Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Bestiary, that hits shelves with its first issue this August with a Tales From The Crypt-like anthology format. One of the story arcs features a seemingly impossible and suicidal mission for a team of mercenaries: the stealing of the head Cenobite's pins.\n\nClive Barker's Hellraiser: Bestiary #1 will be available online and in comic book shops on August 20th. We have the official details and looks at all three covers below:\n\nJuly 24, 2014 - Los Angeles, CA - \"Award-winning publisher BOOM! Studios invites horror fans to open the puzzle box and explore all-new tales of the LeMarchand Device with CLIVE BARKER’S HELLRAISER: BESTIARY, a new anthology-style limited series that picks up where classic horror anthologies like Tales from the Crypt and Vault of Horror left off.\n\nOver the past three years, Clive Barker has re-imagined the HELLRAISER mythos as only he could, building a long-form narrative that became one of the best-received horror comics in recent memory. Now, the Master of Horror takes us into his Bestiary for an anthology series—free of continuity, but full of shocking consequences. This series will feature comics’ rising stars like Ed Brisson (Sheltered) and Michael Moreci (CURSE), and the first issue will feature the comics debut of award-winning novelist Victor LaValle (The Devil in Silver, Big Machine).\n\n“Clive Barker has created an entire mythology that has become a cornerstone of the horror genre,” said BOOM! Studios Editor-in-Chief Matt Gagnon. “Now we get to dive back into the world of HELLRAISER with some of our favorite creators, exploring this dark world in ways we haven't experienced before. Clive himself chose many of the contributors in BESTIARY and the talent within this series is something to behold.”\n\nStep into the Bestiary for all-new tales of the LeMarchand Device and its guardians! This first issue contains the start of a six-part serial written by Mark Miller (CLIVE BARKER’S NEXT TESTAMENT) and Ben Meares (HELLRAISER ANNUAL 2013), and drawn by Carlos Magno (DEATHMATCH), where a team of mercenaries are hired to steal Pinhead’s pins. Also, superstar author Victor LaValle teams with artist Colin Lorimer (CURSE) to tell a story set on the outskirts of New York City, as a close-knit community is torn apart by the presence of the puzzle box.\n\nCLIVE BARKER’S HELLRAISER: BESTIARY #1 arrives in comic shops on August 20th with a retail price of $3.99 under Diamond order code JUN140941. The first issue will ship with a main cover by Conor Nolan and retailer incentive covers by Kim Herbst and Sam Shearon. Not sure where to find your nearest comic retailer?
