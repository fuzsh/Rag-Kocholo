        "text": "Hellraiser is a British horror franchise that consists of eleven films, a series of comic books, and additional merchandise. The franchise is based on the novella The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker, who would go on to write and direct the adaptation of his story, titled Hellraiser. The films, as well as the comic book series, continually feature the Cenobite Pinhead. The series' storyline focuses on a puzzle box that opens a gateway to the Hell-like realm of the Cenobites, an order of formerly human monsters who harvest human souls to torture in sadomasochistic experiments.\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nHellraiser (1987)\n\nHellbound: Hellraiser II (1988)\n\nHellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992)\n\nHellraiser: Bloodline (1996)\n\nHellraiser: Inferno (2000)\n\nHellraiser: Hellseeker (2002)\n\nHellraiser: Deader (2005)\n\nHellraiser: Hellworld (2005)\n\nHellraiser: Revelations (2011)\n\nHellraiser: Judgment (2018)\n\nHellraiser (2022)\n\nAbout\n\n[edit]\n\nI don't take stuff seriously. I saw 'Hellraiser 3' the other day at Cannes; it's OK, it's a good film, I didn't hate it or anything. I thought it was quite good, but it was all just so serious. Some guy walking round with pins sticking out of his face. I just can't sit there and think, 'this is really scary'. If I made a 'Hellraiser' film, I'd like Pinhead to be whacked against a wall and have all the pins flattened into his face.\n\nPeter Jackson Trash City Interview (1992)\n\nThis disambiguation page, one that points to other pages that might otherwise have the same name, lists articles associated with the name Hellraiser (franchise).
