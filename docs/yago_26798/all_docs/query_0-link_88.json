Clive Barker has turned in his second draft of the script for the remake but is just waiting for the word from Dimension head honcho Bob Weinstein for the go ahead. I’m going to be quietly optimistic about the remake. It’s great that we have Clive Barker back in some sort of capacity in the Hellraiser film universe, but with Dimension still involved I have heavy reservations. I’ll leave it at that for now. The quote is taken from an interview Barker did with Entertainment Weekly but has been re-posted through the fantastic horror news site Shock Till You Drop.\n\nIn fact, these days, Barker is very much back in the Pinhead business. The writer reveals he recently sent Dimension Films chief Bob Weinstein the second draft of his screenplay for a new Hellraiser movie, which Barker describes as a “very loose” remake of his original film."
