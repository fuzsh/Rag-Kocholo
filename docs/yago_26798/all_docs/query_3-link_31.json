        "text": "This era of big Hollywood films are dominated by reboots and franchises. The successes of endeavours like the Star Wars saga and the Marvel Cinematic Universe have production companies reaching down the back of their sofas looking for that lost penny which could open up a new series of films to make them a lot of money. Data suggests that 80 percent of the top 25 films of 2019 were sequels, while in 1981 this number was just 16 percent.\n\nLo and behold, Disney are releasing a new Hellraiser movie. Clocking in as film number 11 in the series, fans would be forgiven for being a bit lost with all the goings on in the Helloverse.\n\nData for the cost of the film has not been released and the movie has only had a limited run in cinemas before being dropped on Hulu+ for Americans, Disney+ for everyone else.\n\nIn what order were the Hellraiser films released?\n\nWhat order should the Hellraiser films be watched?\n\nAt this stage itâ€™s not clear where the new Hellraiser film fits in the series. Despite there being so many films only five fit in some sort of time frame - the others are standaloen flicks.\n\nThese films can be watched on their own, thoguh it is of course advised to watch the main serie sto have any idea of what is going on."
