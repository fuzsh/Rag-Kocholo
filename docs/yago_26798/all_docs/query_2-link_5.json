        "text": "A woman discovers the newly resurrected, partially formed, body of her brother-in-law and lover. She starts killing for him to revitalize his body and escape the demonic beings that are pursuing him after he escaped their underworld.\n\nKirsty is brought to an institution after the horrible events of Hellraiser - Das Tor zur HÃ¶lle (1987), where the occult-obsessive head doctor resurrects Julia and unleashes the Cenobites and their demonic underworld.\n\nLocked inside the infamous puzzle box, the gamer needs to fight cenobites and other monsters on each level of hell to open a section of the box. The game was never finished but remains a cult urban legend through gamers and fans of franchise.\n\nIn the 22nd century, a scientist attempts to right the wrong his ancestor created: the puzzle box that opens the gates of Hell and unleashes Pinhead and his Cenobite legions.\n\nA shady police detective becomes embroiled in a strange world of murder, sadism and madness after being assigned a murder investigation against a madman known only as \"The Engineer\".\n\nA behind-the-scenes look at 'Hellraiser (1987)' and its legacy, featuring interviews with various members of its cast and crew including Clive Barker and Doug Bradley.\n\nAfter a car crash, a shady stockbroker suffers from amnesia. This leaves him in a hazy limbo of sex and murder. But, as in a predestined journey, he unmistakenly takes the bait and follows the marked-out clues all the way to Pinhead.\n\nEarth has been silenced, and mankind eradicated by one final war. Now in the bowels of Hell, Pinhead - leader of the Cenobites - finds himself bored, tortured by his own immortality, and facing the fear that his own dark legion will eventually turn upon him. The only thing left to do? The last possible slice of sensation he can experience? To open the puzzle box himself.\n\nGamers playing a MMORPG based on the \"Hellraiser\" films find their lives endangered after being invited to a rave, the host of which intends to show them the truth behind the Cenobite mythos.\n\nIn this fan film crossover, Lucifer blackmails a young woman into solving the Lament Configuration, in hope of bringing the Cenobites into the Second Angelic War.\n\nA young woman struggling with addiction comes into possession of an ancient puzzle box, unaware that its purpose is to summon the Cenobites.\n\nTroubled young Priest Father Farrell returns to deserted house that cost his friends their lives nearly 20 years ago. Plagued by guilt, flashbacks and curiosity, Father Farrell attempts to confront the ghosts within himself as well as the house. But with the re-appearance of the Lament Configuration Puzzle, something much worse than dead friends is coming for Father Farrell."
