        "text": "UPDATE: Last year, Arrow Video released the first four Hellraiser films in a 4K box set called Hellraiser: Quartet of Torment. That box set is now making its way to North America, with a release date of October 22nd in the US and Canada! For information on what’s contained in the set, check out the write-up on last year’s UK release below. It appears that everything from the UK set will be included in the North American set.\n\nThe original article follows:\n\nA couple years ago, screenwriter Peter Atkins – who worked on the scripts for the first three Hellraiser sequels – published his original screenplay for the famously troubled fourth film, Hellraiser: Bloodline (the script is available for purchase at THIS LINK), saying, “Whilst you’ll never get to see a Director’s Cut of Hellraiser: Bloodline, you can read in this book what was supposed to be…” But even though the production was too complicated for us to ever see a proper director’s cut, there is a “newly uncovered workprint version” – and it’s going to be included in Arrow Video’s upcoming 4K box set release of the first four Hellraiser movies!\n\nHere’s the information on the films: We Have Such Sights To Show You… In the 1980s, Clive Barker changed the face of horror fiction, throwing out the rules to expose new vistas of terror and beauty, expanding the horizons for every genre writer who followed him. With Hellraiser, his first feature film, he did the same for cinema. Hedonist Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) thinks he has reached the limits of earthly pleasure. But a mysterious puzzle box will take him further than he can possibly imagine, opening the doors to a dominion where pain and pleasure are indivisible and summoning the Cenobites, whose experiments in the higher reaches of experience will tear his soul apart. When he manages to escape, Frank returns to the world skinless and in need of help. Now his former lover Julia (Clare Higgins) must kill to make him whole again. But the Cenobites want Frank back, and there’ll be hell to pay when they find him.\n\nHellbound: Hellraiser II expands on Barker’s original vision as screenwriter Peter Atkins takes Julia Cotton, her step daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) and the sinister Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham) into the dominion of the Cenobites themselves. Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth sees Pinhead set loose on the sinful streets of New York City to create chaos with a fresh cadre of Cenobitic kin. Then, Hellraiser: Bloodline sinks its hooks into past, present and future with the story of Phillip LeMarchand, the 18th-century toymaker who made the lament configuration puzzle box, his descendent John Merchant – a 20th-century architect whose most recent building bears a striking resemblance to the lament configuration – and Dr. Paul Merchant, a 22nd-century engineer and designer of The Minos, a space station which is a great deal more than it seems.\n\nExperience the sublime agony of this quartet of torment like you never have before in all-new 4K restorations from the original camera negatives.
