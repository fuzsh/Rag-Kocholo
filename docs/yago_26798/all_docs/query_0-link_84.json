        "text": "Has anyone seen a scarier figure than Pinhead from the \"Hellraiser\" movies? I haven't. Clive Barker Has always had a mind that twisted fear into reality. He has taken his nightmare and created art from them whether it be a collection of sketches, a novel or even a feature length film. Clive Barker is the one man who can take a beautiful puzzle box and make it into the most horrifying piece in all of horror.\n\nBack in September of 1987, \"Hellraiser\" was released and proved to be a first of its kind in the horror genre. Sure you had your classic slasher films, but \"Hellraiser\" raised the bar in terms of visual horror and gave us new and terrifying ways to view film. The film brought on ideas of Hell that had never been fleshed out in such a way on film that it captivated audiences and made them want more. Just look up how many sequels the \"Hellraiser\" franchise has produced. It's hard to believe that these ideas came from one man's imagination as well as his bad dreams. The absolute horror shown in these films were unimaginable and almost like Clive Barker saw hell in its truest form in his mind.\n\n\"Hellraiser\" and it's sequels not only deserve to be part of your Halloween Movie marathon, but it deserves a marathon of its own. This franchise has always been the franchise that had creeped me out the most. I give \"Hellraiser\" a 4.5 out of 5 on the scare factor."
