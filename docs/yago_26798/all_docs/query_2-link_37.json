        "text": "Welcome back to Horror 101, a series of articles where we explain horror movie legends and their lore. For beginners, the confused, or just those who need a refresher, these articles are for you.\n\nIt’s been a popular topic recently: finding someone who matches your freak. And horror is full of them, just straight-up nasties whose limits of experimentation know no bounds. But who are the unmatched freaks? The unrivaled weirdos, not just in this world, but across all realities?\n\nIf Clive Barker is to be believed, it’s the Cenobites.\n\nAnd today’s Horror 101 is all about the stars of the Hellraiser franchise: who they are, where they came from, what they want, and how that funny little puzzle box plays into it. Hellraiser is a sprawling franchise with comics and short stories galore, beyond the massive scope of its 11 films. To simplify things, we’re sticking to the films, except for Hellraiser: Judgement, because it left on a cliffhanger that doesn’t make sense in continuity and most likely won’t be continued—obviously, spoilers for almost all the Hellraiser films. Let’s get into it!\n\nWHAT IS THE LAMENT CONFIGURATION?\n\nBefore we can explain what the Cenobites are, we need to explain the thing that summons them. Known as the Lament Configuration, Hellraiser’s iconic infernal invention is a puzzle box, that when solved opens a gateway between Hell and Earth, allowing the Cenobites free passage between the realms. This passage can only be closed by reverting the box to its original form.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lament Configuration was made by a man named Philip Lemarchand (because, as with all bad things, the French caused it). Hellraiser: Bloodline shows us that Lemarchand was commissioned by a French occultist, De L’Isle, who performed an intricate and bloody ritual to summon a demon. This unleashed Angelique, the first of the Cenobites. Lemarchand was struck with guilt and cursed, with his bloodline becoming dedicated to destroying the passage De L’Isle created, but more on that later.\n\nRegardless of where it is in the franchise, the Lament Configuration is an artifact of terrifying power. The 2022 remake of Hellraiser shows the Lament Configuration in several other forms, each granting the user one wish. However, the wishes are a bit on the Monkey’s Paw side, as the film’s secondary antagonist Voight ends up wishing through the Sensation configuration for endless pleasure. He is of course given the Cenobites idea of endless pleasure: being made functionally immortal and implanted with an advanced mystical torture device that never relents.\n\nWHAT ARE THE CENOBITES?\n\nSpeak of the devil, and you’ll inevitably have to explain his lore. The Cenobites, known as The Order of the Gash or Pinhead’s Gash for short, are an order of interdimensional demons whose perceptions of pain and pleasure are one in the same. These grotesque (if not stylish) beings are brutal and efficient torturers whose idea of a good time involves putting their victims through hell and dragging them back to their dark world.\n\nEach Cenobite is brutally deformed, usually complete with flensed flesh, barbs and hooks, missing or deformed body parts, and bloodless pale skin. They also almost always wear leather outfits to fit their extreme BDSM ideals. On a textual level, the Cenobites and how they ravage people has always been an allegory for addiction (and in particular, sex addiction, but it expands as the series goes on and gets broader). They are beings stripped bare of anything but desire, and the extremes they’ll go to get what they want, and their aesthetics are tailor-made to match that.\n\nWHERE DO THE CENOBITES COME FROM?\n\nAll Cenobites were once human, victims of the Lament Configuration that were chosen as priests by Leviathan due to a lack of faith or having a particularly cruel streak. We learn in Hellraiser II and III that they’re created by fusing a demonic spirit, completely amoral and chaotic killers, with a damned human spirit, whose ideas of structure and order allow the ruinous power to be focused and execute Leviathan’s commands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHAT DO THE CENOBITES WANT?\n\nIf their victim’s spirits escape Hell, however, they will endlessly hunt for them, and take out anyone in their path to get them back. Though their name would make them seem like a dark order of monks, they mostly act as jailers for the Hell they reside in. The Gash follows a structured hierarchy and destroys threats to that hierarchy with impunity. At the top of it all is the boss called Leviathan.\n\nWHO IS PINHEAD?\n\nThough the Cenobites of The Gash seem unrestrained in their merciless methods, every depiction of them shows them led by a head priest: Pinhead.\n\nWhile the novella and subsequent stories don’t give much of an origin to Pinhead, we find out in Hellraiser 2 that he was once an English soldier named Elliot Spencer, who grew callous with life and began seeking new pleasures. Running into the Lament Configuration on his hedonistic journey, he was killed by the box and turned into Leviathan’s servant during World War 2. Since then, he has been such an icon of horror that you can’t have a Hellraiser without him.\n\n…Or her, or they, or it! In the 2022 remake, Pinhead (just called The Priest) doesn’t have any of this backstory, and is portrayed by Jamie Clayton instead of a traditional male actor one would expect. This is overtly a nod by director David Bruckner to the fact that in the original novella, Pinhead is androgynous with some feminine traits (but is only referred to with the pronoun “it”). The story version is seemingly gender nonconforming, while all the press and discussion about the film indicates remake Pinhead as female.\n\nAll of this to say, at the end of the day, a Pinhead is a Pinhead regardless of gender, and this franchise would be way worse without him, her, or them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHOW DO YOU DEFEAT THE CENOBITES?\n\nWhile it’s seemingly impossible to destroy the Cenobites, they can actually be slowed down and even swayed to your side. The simplest method of getting away from them is to, of course, revert the puzzle box to its original form and send the Cenobites back to Hell. The Cenobites have on one occasion been reminded of their formerly human lives, and turned on Leviathan for making them that way. However, this was only a temporary armistice as Pinhead eventually returned to his wicked ways.\n\nBut the most surefire way to stop the cenobites is one of the franchise’s most controversial moments: going to space and boxing them up like a gift. Remember how earlier in the article I mentioned the Lemarchand bloodline trying to negate the effects of creating the box? The Lemarchand family repeatedly tried and failed to create a puzzle box to do so, known as the Elysium Configuration: a device that could produce an unending source of light that would shut the pathway made by the Lament.\n\nThis came to a head in 2172, during the events of Hellraiser: Bloodlines. After multiple attempts, Dr. Paul Merchant had designed a space station known as the Minos. When the cenobites went to space to hunt down Merchant, it was revealed the Minos was the Elysium Configuration, and he had lured them into a trap.\n\nSince this is as far into the future of their universe as the story goes, Pinhead and his Gash were all (or will be in about 150 years, give or take) trapped in the Elysium Configuration satellite, constantly being blinded by eternal light.\n\nLive by the puzzles, die by the puzzles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n…WHY CD-HEAD?\n\nWhy not CD-Head? Look at him!\n\nHe is perfect the way he is.\n\nAnd that will be it for today’s Horror 101 lesson. See you in the next class, and stay tuned to Horror Press’s social media feeds (@HorrorPressLLC on Twitter and Instagram) for more content on horror movies, television, and everything in between!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWelcome back to Horror 101, a series of articles where we explain horror movie legends and their lore. For beginners, the confused, or just those who need a refresher, these articles are for you.\n\nThe zombie craze of the 2000s to 2010s had an undeniable and unrelenting grip on the consciousness of horror fans and the world in general. Shambling masses of the formerly living were a hot commodity, in everything from television to movies to gaming, and just about everything zombie was being greenlit. But as that new zombie bubble grew and properties like The Walking Dead and The Last of Us were exploding in popularity, the original series of films that started it all were finding a second wind: Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead” series was back, and even had new films being made. Night of the Living Dead, the one and only!\n\n…And Return of the Living Dead.\n\nAnd it’s sequels.\n\nAnd also Zack Snyder was doing his own thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, it may have gotten a little confusing trying to sort out and untangle the many overlapping Romero and Romero-like zombie films. But that’s what we’re here to do today: sorting out the various canons, how their zombies came to be, and how two franchises sprung from one classic movie. And hopefully, we won’t boil our brains in the process.\n\nWHY ARE THERE SO MANY DIFFERENT LIVING DEAD MOVIES?\n\nFrom the jump, what is now a piece of horror film history was a controversial coming attraction. George Romero and John A. Russo’s Night of the Living Dead, a story of survival in a bizarre and at the time unheard-of zombie apocalypse, was met with anger and indignation for its liberal amounts of violence in an era where the MPAA’s rating system was yet to be implemented (many even suspect Romero’s work was a major catalyst for getting the rating system codified).\n\nBut more important than its taboo nature was how much it made back: Night of the Living Dead was a smash hit at the box office, making back over 250 times its budget and cementing a franchise. But where there’s money, there are big problems: the schism between Night of the Living Dead’s many sequels is primarily a case of ownership of the film rights.\n\nIn another case of creatives suffering from success and splitting up (I’m looking at you Friday the 13th), Russo and Romero had differences regarding how they should take the property forward. Eventually, they settled on splitting the film’s “surnames”, with Russo owning the rights to title films with the phrase “Of the Living Dead”, while Romero owned the rights to make films under the “Of the Dead” title.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHAT FILMS MAKE UP THE “OF THE DEAD” SERIES?\n\nDespite what some cursory Google searching might tell you, the Night of the Living Dead series (or “Of the Dead” series) is six films, only 4 of which are in the same continuity.\n\nThe only direct sequels to Night of the Living Dead are Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, and Land of the Dead. The slow collapse of society, the behaviors of the zombies in these films, and the motif of zombies regaining some intelligence over time are the primary links between them since the casts of each film are never connected. In these films, the zombies result from some unknown pathogen, with the original film indicating it was brought back to Earth by a space probe returning from Venus.\n\nBe it radiation or a cosmic virus, it raises the recently dead and turns them into contagious monsters, which eventually causes the destruction of society and leaves humanity separated into small clades. But they have one fatal weak spot: having their brains destroyed. (I know you knew this. Of course you knew this, who doesn’t know this?) Diary of the Dead (2007) and its follow-up prequel Survival of the Dead (2009) are not actually sequels or reboots to the previous films in the franchise, but their own weird third thing. They just share the “Of The Dead” name because of Romero’s claim to it, and have similar zombies. In these films, we never actually find out what caused the zombies to rise from their grave.\n\nBut we do get an Amish guy fighting zombies and flinging dynamite at them, which was kind of cool.\n\nWHAT’S UP WITH THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD SERIES?\n\nReturn of the Living Dead, however, is a completely different beast. Russo’s Return series takes a unique approach as a sequel, and paints the events of Night of the Living Dead as a dramatized version of a real-world government coverup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Night is just a film in this universe, Return of the Living Dead posits it depicts the first Trioxin outbreak: the experimental use of a bio-weapon known as Trioxin gas created nearly indestructible zombies that hunger for human brains. These zombies are also fully conscious, feel everything happening to them, and eat brains as a form of relief, which is absolute nightmare fuel! They can, however, be put down with electricity, as we find out in Return of the Living Dead 2.\n\nThough the government was able to control the first outbreak, some of the zombies remaining bodies ended up being stashed at a medical supply warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky. Shock of shocks, some bozos open the canisters containing their remains, and a second outbreak ravages the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Army is incredibly incompetent in these movies, so the outbreaks happen a few more times in the sequels, and control of Trioxin gets so bad that college students even begin taking it as a recreational drug just for fun.\n\nIt’s all just a series of Trioxin “whoopsies” really.\n\nWHAT ABOUT ZACK SNYDER’S “OF THE DEAD” MOVIES?\n\nThese have no relation, to either of the previous series really. Dawn of the Dead (2004) is a remake of the original Dawn of the Dead, but does not share continuity with Night of the Living Dead or any of its sequels. Army of the Dead (2021) is also somehow not a sequel to Dawn of the Dead (2004). For some reason? I wish I had a better answer for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nARE THE ZOMBI FILMS SEQUELS TO NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD?\n\nThis, this question is the one that gets me.\n\nHilariously, due to the Italian legal system, yes. The first Zombi film was just an Italian rerelease of Dawn of the Dead, and because Italian copyright law allows producers to make sequels to films they didn’t make, Fabrizio De Angelis was able to make a sequel to Dawn of the Dead called Zombi 2. It was also directed by giallo visionary Lucio Fulci, who gave us that amazing scene of a zombie fighting a shark!\n\nThis leads to an even more confusing chain of films. In Italy, there are only three official Zombi movies, but there are two other Zombi 3’s that were not sequels to Zombi 2 and just took the name! To make it even worse, Zombi’s 4 and 5 are American releases of unrelated Italian films, which is completely backwards from how we started this. On top of that, Pulgasari, a film we discussed here, is called Zombi: The Communist Bull-Monster for its Pakistan release, despite having no zombies, no communists, and if you really think about it, arguably no bull monster! My brain is boiling inside my skull!\n\n…But yes, the answer to that question is yes. The three Zombi films are their own separate and messed-up continuity splintering off from the original Dawn of the Dead and, by extension, Night of the Living Dead.\n\nWell, that should be all for today’s Horror 101 lesson. See you in the next class and stay tuned to Horror Press’s social media feeds (@HorrorPressLLC on Twitter and Instagram) for more content on horror movies, television, and everything in between!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs August’s theme is Road Trip Month here at Horror Press, there is one aspect of horror out on the open road you might have forgotten about. While most of the action takes place on the asphalt as psychotic hillbillies chase their prey down in trucks and slashers hide in the backseat of their target’s cars, both killers and victims alike need somewhere to stay on long nights. You need a place to lay your head down. You need a hotel.\n\nAnd because Horror Press always has the concerned traveler in mind, we’ve reviewed some classic horror movie hotels and motels and rated how nice they’d actually be to stay in.\n\nWe’re factoring in four key qualities and rating them on a scale of 1 to 10:\n\nThe quality of the staff and management\n\nThe cleanliness and comfort of the rooms\n\nThe amenities available to guests\n\nOh, and most importantly, how cool I am with dying here (abbreviated as H.C.A.I.W.D.H?).\n\nBecause…it’s a horror movie hotel, you’re probably going to die there.\n\nWe’ll be beginning with the most unpleasant and working our way up to the best. Unsurprisingly, we start with…\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRATING HOTELS IN HORROR\n\nTHE KAHIKI PALMS MOTEL (THE DEVILS REJECTS)\n\nEven before the brutal torture and murders that took place here, the Kahiki Palms Motel wasn’t a sight for sore eyes when pulling off the highway. It’s got many of the same problems the Bates Motel has (more on that later), and the place is completely filthy even before the Firefly’s step foot in it.\n\nBeyond that, you’re in the middle of Texas cooking in the heat, with no AC and an ice machine that has definitely got sand in it. No bueno. The exterior looks cool at least, just stop and take some photos out there without actually checking in.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 1/10\n\nROOMS: 1/10\n\nAMENITIES: 1/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 1/10\n\nSEVEN DOORS HOTEL (THE BEYOND)\n\nThe Seven Doors Hotel is smack dab in the southern United States, in a woody and almost swampy part of Louisiana, near New Orleans but sitting directly over one of the seven gates to hell. It’s in disrepair, like many of the others on the list, but that’s nothing a little tender care and love from the new management can’t fix!\n\nJust kidding, this place is unfixable.\n\nYou should never stay at a hotel being run out of desperation. The owner, Liza, is hard up on cash and willing to put up with some supernatural nonsense to try and turn a profit, but she’s in way over her head. Some people just don’t have the heart or brains for hospitality, let alone hospitality when there’s some Lovecraftian black magic going on. An abundance of zombies and a possessed dog put this pretty low on the list of voluntary stays, especially when there aren’t any good views of nature to make up for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteer clear of this weird antebellum health hazard if you can, although a one-night excursion might be your only choice if the state of Airbnb in New Orleans is as terrible as it is everywhere else.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 3/10\n\nROOMS: 5/10\n\nAMENITIES: 3/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 3/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 3/10\n\nBATES MOTEL (PSYCHO FRANCHISE)\n\nLet’s get all the iterations of this place out of the way, since they’re pretty much the same: they’re kind of sleepy, fairly dusty, and completely underserviced given they don’t get much business. The biggest highlight of staying here is that beautiful house out back, and you don’t even really get to enjoy that outside of seeing Norman pace in the window. Sorry, seeing Mother pace in the window. There’s a difference.\n\nAssuming you are not a woman Bates falls in love with or someone investigating him, you’re pretty safe; after all, it’s just him. But it’s also just him running the motel. He is fairly nice when he isn’t consumed by a homicidal persona but remember: all it takes is one of his mental breakdowns happening during the night for him to be in a mumu walking around with a kitchen knife while the front desk phone is left ringing. Next thing you know, you’re waiting for room service while he’s cleaning up the remains of some private detective off the floor. You’re alive, but you’re also waiting for a cold, probably poorly cooked burger.\n\nStaff and management get two points since it’s technically one guy with two personalities, but that’s being generous.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 2/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 4/10\n\nAMENITIES: 3/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H.?: 6/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 4/10\n\nTHE HOTEL CORTEZ (AMERICAN HORROR STORY: HOTEL)\n\nI’m not staying here, there’s like eight different ways you could die and none of them are good! Why would I ever—wait was that Lady Gaga?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSTAFF AND MANAGEMENT: 10/10\n\nROOMS: 6/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 1/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE YANKEE PEDDLER INN (The Innkeepers)\n\nI like Ti West’s directing, but I’m not going to Connecticut to sleep in a tough queen bed with a scratchy quilt. It could be worse, as we’ve seen with previous entries on this list, but it could also be better. Claire and Luke seem like pretty reliable employees, and as long as you don’t go around swinging crystal pendulums and disturbing the traumatized ghosts, you should be fine. 6’s across the board, I guess?\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 6/10\n\nROOMS: 6/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nTHE DOLPHIN HOTEL (1408)\n\nThere is only one room in the hotel that is technically haunted, but we have to assume you’re getting that one because it’s kind of the whole premise of the movie. In which case, you have a 99% chance of dying in a horrible way, and you don’t get any rest or relaxation as the spirits haunting Room 1408 pump your brain full of harrowing illusions.\n\nIt’s not a very safe space for people wrestling with trauma or suffering from pre-existing mental health issues, but I guess what a haunted house is? Our protagonist, Mike, does manage to escape in the end (at least, one of the four endings this film has, I haven’t seen the others), but unless you have a bottle of 151-proof in your luggage to torch the place, you’re ironically kind of cooked.\n\nStaff seemed nice when they aren’t letting you walk to your death, it’s got a good view, and you’ll at least have something interesting to write about if you make it out of there.\n\nEditor, don’t even think about it.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 7/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 7/10\n\nAMENITIES: 7/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 1/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nTHE OVERLOOK HOTEL (THE SHINING, DOCTOR SLEEP)\n\nA scary giant hedge maze, snow-blanketed exteriors, and a high-quality turn-of-the-century architectural experience. Good lord, it even has high vaulted ceilings and clean-cut interior design. There are even opportunities to go skiing nearby. The Overlook gets a bad rap for being the site of a bunch of gruesome killings, but in their defense, your honor, the hotel was just evil. All that other stuff happened because the vibes were off.\n\nIs it possible to rehabilitate the place like the Torrance family tried? Not at all. Will you die if you stay there? Absolutely. Is it kind of worth it, cause the place is just so gorgeous? I’m not here to make that judgement for you, but you know you only get to travel so many times in your life, you might as well make the last one a bang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can always count on the management and other guests to be particularly friendly, helping you out of pickles like getting locked in a pantry. They enable your bad habits too, of course, but at least you’ll have company once you’ve frozen to death out there. Who knows, they might even put you in one of their cool time paradox photos!\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 8/10\n\nROOMS: 8/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 7/10\n\nTHE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL (TWIN PEAKS)\n\nThis is objectively the right answer, no? The entire Great Northern Hotel is gorgeous with its rich, dark, wood interiors, lit warmly and designed with comfort in mind. It’s serene, has a beautiful look to it, and if you’re not Dale Cooper, your chances of getting shot in the stomach are zero to none!\n\nAnd sure, the Horne Family that runs it is, on occasion, embroiled in scandal. And MAYBE Benjamin Horne is an irredeemable piece of garbage who wants to tear down the Ghostwood forest. And MAYBE he also owns a combination casino and brothel that he frequents. And MAYBE he’s partially responsible for the murder of a young woman who may or may not have been tortured to death by a demon/spirit/tulpa/doppleganger/Lynchian nightmare but…I mean, look at it! Tell me you wouldn’t want to stay there! Stop trying to take this away from me!\n\nAt least the Great Northern doesn’t have fish in its percolator.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 2/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 10/10\n\nAMENITIES: 10/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 10/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8/10\n\nAdvertisement"
