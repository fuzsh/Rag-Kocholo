        "text": "I was going through my DVD collection this past spring, making a list of memory movies I have yet to review, I’m talking the hardcore ones from way, way back, and was surprised to find there were a number of them I still hadn’t talked about yet, one of them being The Thing (1982). How the hell have I not talked about that movie?! The one movie that traumatized me so much it nearly desensitized me to all horror movies I would see thereafter; well, I can now cross that one off the list. Two others were Hellraiser (1987) and its sequel Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988). They’ve been sitting in the back of mind ever since, and have suddenly come to the forefront now that I’ve learned Arrow Video is releasing solo blu-ray editions of them here in the U.S. Previously they’ve only been available in their Hellraiser: The Scarlet Box set of the first three movies that’s now been long out of print here in the U.S. I’m glad they did this, because I failed to secure this expensive set when it came out back in 2016.\n\nThe first one entered my life back in 1987 when I was eighteen, and had just graduated from high school. They released the movie in September, which was a good idea, being close to Halloween and all. In fact I don’t know why they didn’t release it in October, close to Halloween. I’m going to say I first heard about the movie from Fangoria, and this was around the time I was just getting into Clive Barker and his Books Of Blood short story collections. When it was revealed it was an adaptation of his novella, “The Hellbound Heart,” I combed through the collections I had and couldn’t figure out where this story was, I couldn’t find it, to this day I still haven’t read it. It was then released a year later; I think it was part of the Books Of Blood collections in the U.K., but not part of their U.S. counterparts. I probably should give it a read since the movie and novella are very different, plus news broke this year they want to do a series make it closer to the source material.\n\nThe Fangoria articles were one thing, but once they started airing TV spots for it (I don’t ever remember seeing a trailer for it in the theater) . . . seeing the photos in motion and in context . . . this movie just grabbed me by the balls! It did help a lot I was a fan of Barker’s fiction, so I had a sense what sights this flick was going to offer me, and even then I was not prepared for what I saw. The Friday night it opened Chris gave me a call and asked if I wanted to go see it. This call was significant because Chris rarely called. Basically, when we were friends, if I wanted to hang out with him it was me doing the calling, so when Chris did the calling on this I had a pretty good feeling this was something important. Two other friends came with us, Gerry and Aaron; Chris drove, because of the four of us he was the only one who had a driver’s license. After it was over, and we were all in the car, talking about the movie, especially the sex scene, Aaron says from the backseat, “he wasn’t fucking her, he was stabbing her with his dick.” We all laughed. That moment has always been burned into my mind. He was right though.\n\nNow when Hellbound came out the following year, the studio didn’t release it in the fall, which you’d assume they would, but on December 23 instead. What?! Really?! Two days before Christmas?! I still shake my head at how they came to that decision. No one’s going to go see a horror movie, especially a sequel to Hellraiser, during Christmas. Chris was not with us, and I can’t for the life of me remember why. It was me, Gerry and Aaron again. And this time I was driving, because I had just gotten my license back in September. Other things were different too, Gerry had gone off to boot camp back in May, and had come back in October and December for visits. The mall was new back then, having been completed, I think, six months before, and this is where we saw the movie. The local theater in town didn’t get it, and we got there early so we could have time to explore this place that would end up being a staple in my life for roughly eight years. So many memories of that place.\n\nWe took this back road that was made when the mall was built specifically as a quick and easy route, but during one stretch it went up a steep ass hill and this day the sun was out, and it felt like I was driving directly up into it. This was a year or two before I started wearing sunglasses, and even with the sun visor down I was still having trouble seeing the road. We all joked about it all the way, but we made it safe and sound. That road no longer exists by the way.\n\nI can’t speak for Gerry or Aaron but I loved Hellbound, I even muttered to them while we watched I thought it was almost better than the first. I don’t think that way about it now. I consider both films of equal stature that complement each other perfectly.\n\nI’m going to aim this review at the person(s) who’s either not familiar with this franchise, or may have heard a little something about it and is curious, but remember the old saying ‘curiosity killed the cat,’ and there are things you’re going to learn you can’t unlearn. And with that let’s begin . . . right after the opening credits the movie starts off in some unnamed exotic local, India is what always came to my mind, and one of the film’s characters, Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman), is trying to buy this “box” off someone. The box, the puzzle box, the Lament Configuration, is your key into the Hellraiser world. Though in this first flick it’s only referred to as “the box” or the “puzzle box,” its technical description, the Lament Configuration, isn’t revealed until, maybe, the third movie, Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth (1992). I haven’t seen the third in a long time, but if you’ve read any articles about Hellraiser or Clive Barker, he reveals that term, it’s just not revealed in the movies until several installments in. If you’re feverishly searching for “the box,” and/or already have it in your possession you’re mostly likely not of “morally upstanding quality.” Yes, there’s a personality type that gravitates towards it, and Frank Cotton is it in spades. But, then again, the movie’s heroine, Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), is also “tempted” by it. The box is a lure and a trap, it’s lure is it can deliver pleasures beyond human comprehension, that’s its “public face,” but once you have it, and plan to “open” it, you’ve now stepped firmly into the trap, and if you’re at this stage you’re basically “dead man walking,” then again, maybe, not. It’s a cycle of seduction and damnation the box plays on in just about anyone who acquires knowledge of it, and only the morally incorruptible stand any chance of walking away from it in one piece.\n\nThe closest real world counterpart to the puzzle box would be a Rubik’s Cube, but it’s not hands that general “operate it,” in most cases it’s desire. By the time you’ve opened it, you’ll also realize the Lament Configuration is first and foremost a summoning device, and what it’s designed to call into your presence are “sadomasochists from beyond the grave.” This was Clive Barker’s working title for the film through production, and a fairly accurate one to boot. There are denizens of Hell(?) called cenobites, demons to some, angels to others, the leader (Doug Bradley) of this particular group describes themselves. Cenobites were once humans lured and trapped in the same way Frank Cotton is and brought to Hell(?), every so often, though, some are corrupted and made into cenobites. There are four cenobites in Hellraiser, in the end credits only two of them were given nicknames, Chattering Cenobite (Nicholas Vince) (the one with “chattering mouth”) and Butterball (Simon Bamford) (the fat one wearing the shades), the other two, the leader and the female, were simply credited as Lead Cenobite and Female Cenobite (Grace Kirby, replaced by Barbie Wilde in the sequel). The lead cenobite made such an impression on fans that literally over night he became a horror movie icon the likes of which we hadn’t seen since Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger at that time. They dubbed him “Pinhead” (he has pins strategically placed all over his head and face). That nickname stuck so hard and fast by the time the sequel came out a short year later he was credited as “Pinhead” in the end credits, and the Chattering Cenobite became known as “Chatterer.” To date the female cenobite never reached the same status as he, or the other two, which was a shame, because she makes an impression in both films.\n\nIt’s unclear whether cenobites are denizens of Hell, or of a specific dimension that deals in horrors created out of the mixing of pleasure and pain. There’s a scene, after Kirsty accidentally summons them, where she hollers, “Go to hell!!” and the female cenobite replies, “We can’t . . . not alone.” The novella may shed more light on this, but as you can tell from their attire cenobites are sadomasochists! Their tortures of the human flesh are done through chains! They love chains! And hooks! Hooks and chains latched cruelly onto flesh!\n\nThe opening of Hellraiser sets the movie’s tone brilliantly, after Frank opens the box, unaware of what he’s gotten himself into, these chains spring out and hook him. Now we cut to an unspecified time after, moments, perhaps, and the room is full of hanging chains, and boards, and flesh and limbs nailed to boards, and hanging from hooks! Dear God, it’s an unholy mess. “Pinhead” and the female cenobite are seen moving about in this makeshift torture chamber, looking for something amongst gruesome piles of bloody hunks of flesh all over the floor. What he finds are pieces of Frank’s face! He then locates the puzzle box and puts it back into cube form, as it does the room is restored to its normal empty state and the cenobites vanish. These opening scenes were like nothing I had ever seen in a horror movie before; these odd, leather clad beings seemed so at home among this gore they created! The puzzle box, as I’ve stated is a lure and a trap, it’s also a doorway, and once the box is put back to “normal” these “beings” and what they’ve brought with them are rendered invisible to the material realm once again, returning to their hell.\n\nThe remains of Frank, which are only his pulsating heart, is underneath the floorboards of that room. His soul, I imagine, is with the cenobites in their realm. His body and soul relationship is never fully explored, but the ambiguity of some of this bloody mythos does not deter from the impact of the movie as a whole, or your enjoyment of it. Some of it is explored further in the sequel anyway. Once you get to the sequel you’ll see there isn’t just this one puzzle box, there are many, briefly glimpsed on a shelf in the home of a Dr. Channard. And the moment I saw them I instantly theorized there must be loads of cenobites in existence and each box is connected to specific groups.\n\nWhat’s interesting about this first film is the cenobites aren’t the main focus, they appear in the very beginning to tantalize you, are spoken of in the middle by Frank, but don’t show up again until the third act. The main story is a tragic family drama in a way. Frank has a brother named, Larry (Andrew Robinson) who married Brit, Julia (Clare Higgins), after his first wife died (how she died is never explained). Larry has a daughter, Kirsty. Around the time Julia and Larry were getting married Frank came to visit and seduced Julia, later on we’ll learn she never really loved Larry, no idea why she married him anyway. But she never got over that afternoon of sex with Frank. Kirsty doesn’t get along with her stepmother, and it’ll eventually become obvious she’s in the “evil stepmother” role. The fact she prefers the scumbag brother of the Cotton family, well, that tells you all you need to know about her character.\n\nAfter Frank’s untimely demise in the opening act, the Cotton family has just relocated back to England, back to the house he and Frank grew up. Ah-ha! Now we know where that room is Frank opened the box in. And Larry is shocked to find the house lived in, just barely lived in. Frank isn’t much for the domestic lifestyle. It looks like squatters had been there, until they discover what’s left behind are actually Frank’s belongings.\n\nKirsty is relocating with her family too, but is living in an apartment, because as I said she and Julia don’t get along (duh). Wise choice, seeing as what’s about to happen in that house. She meets a guy, Steve (Robert Hines), and this is her boyfriend for the remainder of the movie. But his character doesn’t get ported over to the sequel. Too bad, he seemed like a decent kid too.\n\nIt’s a silly, everyday accident that triggers all the blood, gore and murder that’s about to take place. While moving a mattress upstairs Larry cuts his hand deep on an exposed nail. He’s the kind of guy that gets queasy and faints at the sight of blood, and, Christ, did he cut himself deep! Julia’s up in that room where Frank opened the puzzle box. It’s just a coincidence she wandered into it while reminiscing about that afternoon Frank plowed her. Larry comes staggering in, bloody hand and all, looking for help, and getting blood all over the floor! While they take him to the hospital something happens.\n\nThere were a couple of things I noticed in the movie I had never taken notice of before. One of them was the slight incubus/succubus vibe the cenobites have, though they themselves never engage in the sexual corruption of their prey, only moderate it. The second is the vampiric aspects of resurrected Frank. The blood all over the floor is absorbed by the remnants of the man underneath the floorboards and we get an impressive FX sequence of him reconstituting himself from liquid to bone and finally to flesh again. He comes quickly to the conclusion blood got him this far and a whole lot more might actually get him his entire body back. But he believes he’s on some kind of time table. He thinks his escape from the cenobites with eventually be found out, so this has to start happening real fuckin’ fast, so he can get away from this place.\n\nHis next objective is to reveal himself to Julia, who gets quickly on board with his plan. Perfect, now all she has to do is bring random guys to the house and have Frank drain them of their blood and tissue. There’s a total of three men she manages to lure, pretending to want sex from them, but she (and we the viewer) go along with the notion they have to be killed before Frank can drain them. And she chooses a hammer to do them in. The first guy she smashes twice over the head as hard as she can and even busts his jaw. The hammer murders were kind of cringe-worthy, and to this day I still think they are. Frank crawls out and drains them. Each time he does he gets more and more flesh on his body. He drains them by sticking his fingers into their necks, and with the creepy and augmented sound (to make even more disgusting) of someone trying to suck up the last of their drink through a straw you easily get that “vampire” vibe. Strange that “vampire” aspect never occurred to me when I first saw it, or the many times afterwards.\n\nThe middle part of the film also gave me a haunted house vibe, because Frank is confined to that one unused and dilapidated room, with only Julia knowing he’s there. But he so wants to be gone from this place it’s only a matter of time before he turns his murderous life draining attentions on his brother. That plot point is a nice twist at the end. We don’t see Larry killed, but Frank did it and put on his skin, the plan now, I always thought, was they’ll still be one happy family with Kirsty thinking her dad is alive and well. But Frank’s got some incestuous drives and once he sees how grown up hot Kirsty became he wants some of her too.\n\nNow that I think about it Kirsty is the second triggering force of the bloodbath in the final act. It’s her nosiness that gets her to the house one day where she happens to see Julia welcoming in a strange man, and the commotion of his attempted murder brings her directly in and face-to-face with this skinless monster. This is also where we see Julia really didn’t need to kill these men, Frank could have just drained them right there. I sometimes wonder if he tricked her into believing she had to for his own sick needs. Or, maybe, it was all her idea?\n\nKirsty grabs the box, Frank freaks out, and she tosses it out the window as a diversion, which allows her to get away. Funny that box stayed in that room after the cenobites were done taking Frank apart. Traumatized, she ends up in a hospital and this is where curiosity about the box brings about its opening, but it’s a little different with her. Before the cenobites show up she’s allowed to see a little bit of their dimension as the wall cracks open and we see an immense gothic hallway. I guess this is a good time to mention there are two more “demons” present in this film, but they’re never explained. I only know of them from what Barker has said in interviews, and from the commentaries on the disc he’s done. Say, hello, to the Engineer . . .\n\nI believe in the novella the Engineer is part of “Pinhead’s” group, and its description is 180-degrees from what was put on screen. In the movie it shows up at random to menace Kirsty as she explores that hallway, and appears one more time at the very end to try and snatch the puzzle box away from her. The design of this thing was also something I had never seen before. The first thing that caught my attention was that “tail,” it looked like a dick with a stinger. And if you know Barker’s fiction and how he loves to combine sex and horror in the most shockingly original ways I’m sure that “dick stinger” was entirely premeditated. It’s too bad this “cenobite” was never seen again in any of the sequels.\n\nThe other “cenobite” is cloaked as a derelict seen several times throughout the movie, usually by Kirsty and his most shocking appearance is at the pet store she’s working at. She finds him with his hand in a terrarium where grasshoppers are kept and is taking them out to eat. After the cenobites are sent packing and the Cotton house burns to the ground, Kirsty tries to destroy the box by tossing it into the burning wreckage. The derelict mysterious appears, walks into the fire, retrieves the box and changes into this skeletal, flying demon. This is the only sub-standard effect in the whole movie and that’s because Barker ran out of money. According to his commentary this derelict is the “keeper of the box,” and like the Engineer it’s never seen again in any of the sequels.\n\nApparently cenobites are like the Devil in that you can bargain with them, as that’s what Kirsty does to prevent them from taking her. Problem is like any deal made with the Devil he’s going to try and screw you in the end regardless and the cenobites are no different. Once she put two and two together and realized that thing she encountered in her parent’s house was their handiwork that got away, she says she’ll lead them to Frank and they can take him back instead. But “Pinhead” wants to hear it from Frank’s lips himself. This is a good time to mention some of the memorable dialogue, most of it uttered by the villains. Featured prominently in the TV spots at the time, “Pinhead” utters, “We’ll tear your soul apart!” That line comes with Kirsty’s bargaining with him and it’s a threat set up perfectly by the Female Cenobite, when she says, “If you cheat us . . .” When I first heard that on the commercials it was a threat from a supernatural movie villain I had never heard before and it resonated. My God, how lethal are these things if they have the capability to literally tear your soul apart, and I half wondered if that was something the film would actually show. “Pinhead” has another great line in that scene when Kirsty is freaking out, “Oh, no tears, please. It’s a waste of good suffering.”\n\nThe other lines, two of them, are uttered by Andrew Robinson playing homicidal Frank when he’s confronting Kirsty near the end of the movie. Both were ad-libs. After she realizes who he really is and tears at his cheek, he whips out his switchblade and calmly states, “So much for the cat and mouse shit.” And the line he utters just before his head explodes (see the beginnings of that in the photos below) was supposed to be, “fuck you,” but he ad-libbed, “Jesus wept” instead.\n\nOnce Kirsty and Frank are back in that damn room again, and confesses he’s Frank, and that he killed her dad the cenobites suddenly appear and literally hook him with so many chains he’s nearly unrecognizable. He utters that infamous, “Jesus wept,” line, smirks, and his head goes BOOM! Being as gory as it is Barker’s original cut had even more gore and sex and got an X rating from the MPAA, so edits had to made to get it down to an R, one of those gore shots taken out was Frank’s exploding head. You don’t actually see it happen in the final version, because one frame was taken out, so a nanosecond before Kirsty exits the room Frank goes from stretched out face to suddenly having no head. Despite the missing gore shot it’s still an effective edit, because you brain still registers the shock of what just happened. When they do a quick re-cap of the movie before the opening credits of Hellbound, you’ll see a tad more of what was cut. And Julia’s hammer murders were cut down, apparently they were more disturbing in their original cut.\n\nOnce they’ve reclaimed Frank again the cenobites turn their attentions back to Kirsty, and her boyfriend, and now she’s in a new cat and mouse game as they hunt her throughout the house. The cenobites may appear to be all powerful, but they adhere to rules too, especially the ones governing their connection to the Lament Configuration. From the point Kirsty accidentally summoned them in the hospital right to the end of the film the box is never restored to its cube form, and as we’ve seen in the final moments of the film putting the box back to a square sends the cenobites back, whether they want to go or not.\n\nThe doorway is closed once again!\n\nUntil the next time. And, you know what? There’s always a next time.\n\nIn every sense of the word I find Hellbound to be a proper sequel, and to me a proper sequel means chapter 2, carrying on some part of the story that began in the first with the same characters and actors, walking that fine line of giving you more of the same without it feeling like a remake, while expanding on the kernels set forth in the first film. Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) is another example of a proper sequel, as well as Halloween II (1981). In fact Hellbound is like Halloween II in that it takes place moments after the first one ends. After a recap of the final moments of Hellraiser we find Kirsty in a psychiatric hospital run by a Dr. Philip Channard (Kenneth Cranham). A detective explains how they found her, and her boyfriend Steve, and sent him straight home. Her babbling of demons and such is what landed her in Channard’s care. We easily get the vibe this is the same night the first film ended on. It’s never revealed how Dr. Channard came upon knowledge of the box, but the snooping around of his assistant, Kyle (William Hope), early on in his private study at his house, reveals three of them on display.\n\nHellbound eschews the tightly focused family drama plot for a more expansive look at where cenobites come from and how they’re made. But don’t worry there’s unfinished business left over from that “family drama,” mostly revolving around Frank (returning Sean Chapman, who uses his own voice this time. He was dubbed over in Hellraiser) and Julia (returning Clare Higgins, who no longer has that unattractive short hair, but gorgeous long locks). Last we saw Julia she had been killed by Frank and left on their bed with no face. The juxtaposition here is she’s now in Hell(?) and about to be in the same condition Frank was when he came back.\n\nJulia’s return is connected to the mattress her body was found on, and Kirsty has learned enough of how these forces operate to realize she has the ability to come back through it, if it’s not disposed off. Channard has the police deliver it to his home, and now the vampiric nature of the “resurrected” is about to go on gruesome display again. Channard’s institute hides the most sever psychotics and disturbed deep down in the “maintenance” section of the building. One particular schizoid (Oliver Smith, who played skinless Frank in the first film) constantly sees his body covered in maggots, and would do great harm to himself if he weren’t in a straitjacket. Channard sits him on the mattress, gives him a razor and watches as he cuts himself up and drenches it in blood. In no time a skinless Julia (Deborah Joel) surfaces, drains the rest of the man’s life, and makes a sexual connection with Channard. With his help he gets her a bunch of random chicks to drain to get her flesh back. With the reluctant help of poor Kyle too. Yes, he gets drained and his life force puts the remaining skin on her back.\n\nThat’s one family member back.\n\nKirsty has waking nightmares of a skinned man writing on the wall in blood, “I am in Hell. Help me.” The author looks a lot like her father’s skinned remains from the first film, so she naturally assumes this must be her father telling her she’s trapped in Hell(?). They couldn’t get Andrew Robinson back, so this plot point became a ruse. It appears the “damned” can reach out to the material world. Not so crazy a notion, since we do have the concept of ghosts being able to reach out to us from the beyond. But it’s not her father, when she mounts a rescue attempt that has her and another patient, a young, mute girl named, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), venturing into the realm of the cenobites, she’s shocked to find those pleas came from incarcerated Frank, who still wants to plow her. Jesus, Frank, let it go, man.\n\nAs this scene plays out Julia shows up and now we have a pretty twisted family reunion where Frank thinks he can still influence her, but with her newfound “state of being” she rebels and tears his heart out, literally! Obviously, he can’t be dead. That’s his soul, it’s trapped in Hell(?), and it will forever be, but Julia’s act did kind of show us you can “tear a soul apart.”\n\nNow, let’s talk about the new things we learn about this supposed “Hell” these crazy ass beings come from. So, are they really from Hell? Well, Kirsty makes a comment to Kyle, “Got a ticket to Hell?” so, she believes Hell is their home, and then there’s her vision of her supposed father, okay, well, he certainly believes he’s in Hell, and I don’t blame him. But is he telling her that because he has some inside knowledge now, or is his experience so hellish he has no alternative to believe he’s in Hell? Food for thought on that one. Then there’s the comment Pinhead makes to Kirsty when they finally meet again, threatening her that if she cheats them again her suffering will be legendary even in Hell. Did he mean that’s where they were or her suffering will be legendary in that other dimension known as Hell. She never thinks to ask him, and he doesn’t expound on his comment. Where the cenobites come from is a dimension constructed of gothic looking labyrinths. Yeah, the whole dimension appears to be a maze, as we see in an impressive landscape shot when Julia leads Channard out into the open to introduce him to her boss. Hovering above it all is a slowly spinning, elongated diamond shaped object with designs reminiscent of the puzzle box. There’s also a hole in both sides out of which spills pitch black light, if you’re caught in this light as it comes around you relive horrors from your past. This is Leviathan, Lord Of The Labyrinth, as Julia calls it, and this is her God. I like the Lovecraftian tone of that line. So, is this place Hell, or what? Maybe. In Satanist Anton LaVey’s book, the Satanic Bible, he refers to something called, Leviathan, being one of the Four Crown Princes Of Hell.\n\nAfter the opening credits we see a British soldier from one of the World Wars. In this movie he’s nameless, in Hell On Earth we learn his name is, Elliot Spencer, and, Jesus H Christ, he’s caressing a puzzle box! Looks can be deceiving, but from the little time we spend with him he doesn’t “look” like a douchebag, an asshole, a psychopath, the personality traits I most associate with someone wanting a puzzle box. It seems the process for becoming one might be different with each person, or it could be it’s the same and what we see after Spencer gets his ass hooked and dragged into Hell(?) is only a close-up of some aspect of that same process. We see his head carved up and patterned in preparation for the pins, and then the pins hammered in by possible biological “protuberances.” He’s screaming the entire town. Now we have a human face for what was once Pinhead’s life on Earth.\n\nBut Dr. Channard certainly can be a book judged by its cover, for he does have a look that gives away his true I-want-to-be-a-cenobite nature. He’s the second human we see transformed and it occurs after Julia introduces him to Leviathan. A huge closet-sized room that looks like a huge portion of the puzzle box rises up behind him, Julia walks him back into it and his head is wrapped tight in wire, another Cronenberg-inspired “protuberance” drains his blood out, while another replaces it with a blue liquid. And as the “room” slowly descends out of sight another Cronenberg-ish device shoves itself into his now bloody mouth. He looks like he’s being forced to drink something. When the “room” rises later in the movie he comes out looking like a cenobite, but there’s one final feature yet to be added to his appearance and it’s hooked onto his head after he steps clear. This appendage looks like a giant dick with a drill inside. The kind of drill Channard uses many times when he’s performing brain operations, and it drills itself into his brain. This thing carries him around so his feet never touch the ground, what it’s connected to at the other end is never shown.\n\nThe Channard cenobite is different from the others. It’s stronger, and can create bladed weapons from stop-motion tentacles that break out his palms. It doesn’t seem to share the same kind of desire to sexually torment others; it just wants to kill anyone it comes across, as we see when it enters back into the hospital and into an area where patients are kept. There’s definitely a one-note slasher/monster vibe about it that’s not quite in keeping with cenobite mythology, or maybe it is, maybe I’m just not that educated (yet) about the kinds of cenobites in existence. Through its interactions with Pinhead and his group we also learn they’re a lot like humans in that they, if given the opportunity and the motivation, will make war with others of their kind.\n\nCenobite Channard has a hard-on for Tiffany and chases her right into an already unfolding situation between Kirsty and Pinhead and his group where Kirsty has managed to make them aware of their human lives. And when Pinhead tries to prevent him from taking her he kills him and the rest of his group. This was a shocking moment for me in the film, during their deaths each reverts back to their human form, and Chatterer was a little kid!\n\nThe power of the Channard cenobite is also revealed when he forces Pinhead into a transformation back to his human form before slitting his throat. Now that’s really cold. I have to admit the Channard cenobite is a cool creation, but he ends ups biting the dust when we learn this dimension is a puzzle to be solved. Tiffany has a penchant for solving puzzles, the main reason why she was being kept in that hospital, for one day she would be used to open a puzzle box, and solving it turns Leviathan into an immense Lament Configuration threatening to trap Kirsty and Tiffany in Hell(?). Seeing this final sequence confirmed to me this can’t be Hell. It would have been interesting to see what this dimension looked like after it was “solved.” By the way Kirsty doesn’t die at the end, nor does Tiffany, and in the doc Director Tony Randel and Screenwriter Peter Atkins constantly refer to this dimension as Hell, so there you have it, cenobites are from Hell.\n\nThere’s one final scene of two movers coming to Channard’s house to remove that mattress. Julia was originally supposed to rise up out of the mattress looking like a cenobite, and she was supposed to take the mantel of the lead cenobite from here on out for the rest of the film series, but two things happened, the fans latched onto Pinhead and Clare Higgins didn’t want the role, so instead this board rises up with various gory horrors attached to it, including a cackling Pinhead face.\n\nThis film isn’t without its continuity problems. The Cotton home was supposed to have burned down at the end of Hellraiser, but we see two cops roaming around in it looking for bodies and it appears not a lick of it is burned. And according to Director Tony Randel in his commentary, when we see one cop brandishing a gun (British police aren’t armed with handguns, at least not back in 1988) and both are talking with American accents, he says the setting is America, though never explains why he broke with this continuity. On the other hand most everyone in Hellraiser has an American accent, despite the United Kingdom setting.\n\nBack in the 80s it was common place for FX artists to slime up their monsters, something I wish artists would go back to doing today; at times a “dry” looking effect doesn’t look as convincing, but Barker and Image Animation (who did FX on both films) took their application of KY jelly to a new level. In both films the blood and gore, with the jelly, were lit in such a way it made the carnage look attractive, for lack of a better word. You can see some of what I’m saying in the photos in this review, but to get the full effect you must check out the blu-rays. You can see this mostly in skinless Frank in Hellraiser and skinless Julia in Hellbound.\n\nLest I forgot, both films are tightly wrapped in an excellent score from Christopher Young! When I first heard it I thought it was from Richard Band. I was already familiar with Band through his scoring of Re-Animator (1985) and From Beyond (1986), and Band’s score for the latter sounds a bit similar. For a long time I used to always confuse those two composers when I heard their music. But Young’s music really is the icing on the cake for these two flicks.\n\nWhen I saw William Hope as Kyle, in the theater I leaned over to Gerry and said, ‘Hey, it’s Gorman from Aliens!” The one other movie I tend to always connect him with is Aliens (1986). He’s the inexperienced Lieutenant Gorman.\n\nThe Hellraiser franchise spans a total of ten movies, ten and counting I should say because it seems every few years someone makes a new Hellraiser film. I liked the third one, Hell On Earth, despite it’s continuity problems, like never revealing how Pinhead managed to survive his death. Believe me he was killed, but the franchise really starts to go down hill with Hellraiser: Bloodlines (1996), the fourth film, a shame because that one had promise. I’ve seen up to Hellraiser: Hellseeker (2002), where Kirsty comes back into the series and for a while I really enjoyed Hellraiser: Inferno (2000), but none of them hold a candle to the first two films.\n\nBack in 2016 Arrow Films released a limited box set of the first three films. Why the third film? Because the first three are generally accepted among fans to be the best of the franchise. These two blues I’m reviewing here are solo releases from that set. Arrow did release a solo Hellraiser blu over in the UK a year later, which this US blu is a copy of, but the solo Hellbound one is new to both countries, and you can buy them here on Amazon!\n\nVIDEO/AUDIO/SUBTITLES: 1080p 1.85:1 high definition widescreen—2.0 English LPCM, 5.1 English DTS-HD Master Audio—English, English SDH\n\nTransfers on Hellraiser and Hellbound look stupendous and gorgeous!
