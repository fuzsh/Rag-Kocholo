        "text": "Most people know of Clive Barker primarily due to the Hellraiser movies based on his novella The Hellbound Heart. He also wrote and directed the film. Many people are also fans of his large work of bizarre horror writing, which focus on fantastic worlds, dark horror and the juxtaposition of sexuality and horror. His unique writing style has brought him much critical acclaim and recognition.\n\nWhat you may be unaware of is that he is also an accomplished visual artist in his own right. Many of his books are illustrated with cover art based on his paintings, with pencil sketches of various characters throughout. These include his famous Books of Blood series, as well as his childrenâ€™s novel The Thief of Time.\n\nJust as his written works have their own unique perspective, voice and style that is instantly recognisable as Clive Barker, so too do his drawings and paintings. His visual art has been released in two collections, which today are much sought after by collectors:\n\nBarker makes a large variety of his artwork, including oil paintings and sketches, available for you to view on his website. Check them out here and be introduced to the wonderful visual accompaniment to his written word. See the imagination of Clive Barker brought to life."
