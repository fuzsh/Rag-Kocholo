The books tend not to go on horror shelves any more and when they do I tend to take them off.\"\n\nLord of illusion Plasma-and-viscera master Clive Barker has signed a deal with New Line to write and direct American Horror, which may have the legs to turn itself into a new franchise (they always say that, mind). Little has been announced about the film, except that it will be set on the expanding American railway network in the aftermath of the American Civil War, ie from about 1865 onwards."
