        "text": "About this Episode\n\nIn the 1980s, Clive Barker burst onto the cultural scene with The Books of Blood, collections of unforgettable tales of horror, depravity, and decadence the likes of which had been seldom seen since the days of Lautréamont's Les Chants de Maldoror and Huysmans' Là-Bas. In the decades that followed, he went on to create an astounding body of work in fantasy and horror as a writer, artist, and film director. In this episode, author, lecturer, and podcaster Conner Habib joins JF and Phil to discuss what is arguably Barker's best-known work, the 1987 horror classic Hellraiser, as well as the novella that inspired it, \"The Hellbound Heart.\"\n\nPreorder Pierre-Yves Martel's album Mer bleue.\n\nSupport us on Patreon and gain access to Phil's ongoing podcast on Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle.\n\nListen to volume 1 and volume 2 of the Weird Studies soundtrack by Pierre-Yves Martel\n\nFind us on Discord\n\nGet the T-shirt design from Cotton Bureau!\n\nGet your Weird Studies merchandise (t-shirts, coffee mugs, etc.)\n\nVisit the Weird Studies Bookshop\n\nReferences"
