        "text": "Another horror classic is getting a reboot, with Davis S. Goyer attached to write and produce a new spin on 1987’s ‘Hellraiser’. This will be the first project from the newly-formed Spyglass Media Group. The original franchise was based on the works of Clive Barker, starting with his novella ‘The Hellbound Heart’. There were ten movies in the original series, with the lead character, the Cenobite (creatures from hell) Pinhead becoming one of the most iconic monsters of horror. Doug Bradley portrayed Pinhead in the first eight movies, with Stephan Smith Collins and Paul T. Taylor taking over in the last two. Barker himself directed the first movie. The final film, ‘Hellraiser: Judgment’, was released in 2018.\n\nRELATED: New Details And A New Pinhead Are Revealed For ‘Hellraiser: Judgment’\n\nSpyglass’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Barber, said via a statement:\n\n“Clive and I go back more than 30 years together. For generations, his brilliantly twisted and imaginative Hellraiser haunted the minds of moviegoers with its searing imagery of Pinhead. David is the perfect storyteller to continue Clive’s vision for a new theatrical version of Hellraiser.”\n\nGoyer added:\n\n“I’ve been a fan of Clive’s work since the original Books of Blood paperbacks and The Hellbound Heart novella. Having the chance to reimagine Pinhead and the Cenobites for a new audience is a nightmare-come-true. Gary is a true fan as well and we’re committed to making something dark and visceral.”\n\nAmong his other works, Goyer wrote or co-wrote the ‘Blade’ movies, and Christopher Nolan’s ‘Dark Knight’ trilogy. He also co-wrote the upcoming reboot ‘Terminator: Dark Fate’, and the Apple TV series ‘Foundation’ based on the works of Isaac Asimov.\n\nRELATED: Apple Partners With David Goyer To Bring Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” To Life\n\nGoyer will produce the series with Keith Levine (‘The Mist’), under the Phantom Four banner. Spyglass’ Vice President of Development & Production, Chris Stone will oversee the project.\n\nAs this project was just announced, it will likely be years before it comes to fruition. But what do you think? Are you excited about a new take on ‘Hellraiser’?"
