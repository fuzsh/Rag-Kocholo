        "text": "To perpetuate itself in time, tradition makes recourse to figures that convey it. This study takes as its object the vampire figure that, in transmitting important aspects of the cultural tradition, takes the form of its own tradition, manifesting itself in a series of narrative and cultural works. As this study maintains, the vampire figure possesses its own literary and cinematographic tradition, even as it provides an understanding of transmission, tradition, and education. In order to persist through time, traditions need to retain a static core, while also being malleable enough to allow for the transformation of the secondary features. The vampire is a malleable cultural figure, making it the perfect emblem of the concept of tradition. Moreover, five recurring traditional constellations are present, in various degrees, in vampire-centric narratives. The victim choice, the vampiric bite and the transformative blood exchange – with its undeniable relation to “perverse” sexuality, the training process, the desire to belong to a family or a community, and the search for one’s origins all illustrate the link between the vampire and the concept of tradition. This thesis explores the impact of the vampire figure as an emblem of tradition through the most classic – the most traditional – narrative, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, and through the first three installments of Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles – Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned – as well as through their film adaptations.\n\nRichie (to his friend Lizzie who is presently crossing two sticks together): What are you doing? Lizzie: I’m working out the rules. Where can I get some garlic? (Carey & Gross (2011) The Unwritten #20, [19].) The Unwritten (2010¬-2015), a recent series of Vertigo fantasy comics created by writer Mike Carey and artist Peter Gross, discusses several unresolvable metafictional problems, mostly from the point of view of its self-consciously fictional characters. One of the trickiest, and perhaps the most central to the plot, is the characters’ relations to the work’s many intersecting genre conventions: can the protagonists exploit them, or are they ultimately unable to avoid becoming exploited by them? This peculiar push-and-pull between the characters’ designed, predestined fictional aspect and their willful, mimetic human aspect is made visible especially through two prominent vampire characters. Once the protagonist’s sidekick, Richie Savoy gets bitten, his relation to reality starts shifting: he finds himself a slave to familiar vampiric tropes, including bloodlust and super-sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Despite Savoy’s insistence that vampires do not exist in the storyworld he resides, the bite of this fictional creature seems to have infected him with generic “rules” that invade and control him like a disease, making him “less real” and more prone to certain roles, actions, habits, and dispositions. By contrast, when the antagonist, Count Ambrosio, hunts, it is him who appears to twist the storyworld around him: darkness spreads, and red-eyed wolves and bats come out to set him an appropriate stage. Yet, not even these two cases together have been enough to brand the entire series a ‘vampire comic’. To sum, then, The Unwritten implicitly evokes questions about the dynamics of character, trope, and genre: which motivates which, specifically in the case of vampire narratives? In my presentation, I will seek possible answers to these questions from narrative theory, transmedia theory, and character theory, including the theoretical constructions of James Phelan and Wolfgang G. Müller. That is, I will use the vampire scenes of The Unwritten comic as prompts to consider critically the interrelations of the vampire genre, the vampire as a stock character, and the popularcultural tropology that ties them together.\n\nTo perpetuate itself in time, tradition makes recourse to figures that convey it. This proposal takes as its object the vampire figure that, in transmitting important aspects of the cultural tradition, takes the form of its own tradition, manifesting itself in a series of narrative and cultural works. As this article maintains, the vampire figure possesses its own literary and cinematographic tradition, even as it provides an understanding of transmission, tradition, and education. In order to persist through time, traditions need to retain a static core, while also being malleable enough to allow for the transformation of the secondary features. The vampire is a malleable cultural figure, making it the perfect emblem of the concept of tradition. Moreover, five recurring traditional constellations are present, in various degrees, in vampire-centric narratives. The victim choice, the vampiric bite and the transformative blood exchange – with its undeniable relation to “perverse” sexuality (in psychoanalytic terms), the training process, the desire to belong to a family or a community, and the search for one’s origins all illustrate the link between the vampire and the concept of tradition. This paper will explore the impact of the vampire figure as an emblem of tradition through the first three installments of Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles – Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and The Queen of the Damned.\n\nIn The History of Sexuality, Michel Foucault put forward the “repression hypothesis” concerning, in the modern age, sexuality. I postulate that Gothic fiction is a significant breakout of this hypothesis by highlighting (with reference to the vampire) its sexual transgressiveness. In Gothic literature, the vampire is an immortal creature who must prey on mortals to maintain their undeadness. Since early vampire stories, the vampire’s predatory behaviour has acquired a connotation of transgressive sexuality. This creative practice aims to explore vampiric desire and its connection to the emotions of love and loss as well with a focus on the same-sex desire of which there are relatively few examples in Gothic vampire fiction. This literature review, therefore, gives more account of Foucault’s “repression hypothesis” and then surveys vampire fiction as a subgenre of the Gothic, touching upon its origins and vampiric folklore and how these fictional creatures stand for Otherness and symbolise sexual transgression. Then I examine a selection of Queer realist fiction from the 20th and 21st centuries that offer insight into the themes of love, loss, and desire. Foucault’s use of Plato’s treatise, Phaedrus, aids in looking at queer realist fiction as models for gay desire, love, and loss. The insights gained by investigating these themes will be applied creatively to write a Queer vampire novella, entitled Lautréamont that challenges the conventions of desire in the genre, and which will ‘remix’ historical vampire fiction with contemporary queer literature on love, loss, and longing.\n\nPreview and more information available from Sense Publishers (https://www.sensepublishers.com/catalogs/bookseries/teaching-gender/gender-in-the-vampire-narrative/): Gender in the Vampire Narrative addresses issues of masculinity and femininity, unpacking cultural norms of gender. This collection demonstrates the way that representations of gender in the vampire narrative traverse a large scope of expectations and tropes. The text offers classroom ready original essays that outline contemporary debates about sexual objectification and gender norms using the lens of the vampire in order to examine the ways those roles are undone and reinforced through popular culture through a specific emphasis on cultural fears and anxieties about gender roles. The essays explore the presentations of gendered identities in a wide variety of sources including novels, films, graphic novels and more, focusing on wildly popular examples, such as The Vampire Diaries, True Blood, and Twilight, and also lesser known works, for instance, Byzantium and The Blood of the Vampire. The authors work to unravel the ties that bind gender to the body and the sociocultural institutions that shape our views of gendered norms and invite students of all levels to engage in interdisciplinary conversations about both theoretical and embodied constructions of gender. This text makes a fascinating accompanying text for many courses, such as first-year studies, literature, film, women’s and gender studies, sociology, popular culture or media studies, cultural studies, American studies or history. Ultimately this is a text for all fans of popular culture.\n\nThe vampires of Gothic literature present a challenge to the monologic reader. Coleridge's 'Christabel' and Sheridan Le Fanu's 'Carmilla' are perfect examples of this. Rich in symbol and allegory, they offer themselves to an endless variety of interpretations and defy categorisation. There is no one correct meaning to be found in either: there is no one authoritative voice unifying the whole. 'Christabel' remains unfinished, as, to some extent, does 'Carmilla'. Since there is no conclusion, the texts cannot be wrapped in one neat package and forgotten on a shelf-an unfinished text is undead, like the vampire, and 'feeds' on other texts; its meaning, its lifeblood, depends on how it relates to what is outside it. The Gothic is by nature a subversive, parodying genre and its mode is ambiguity and intertextuality. 'Carmilla' and 'Christabel' derive their significance not from any inherently present 'answer', but rather from the questions they raise. By baffling our expectations, they show us our expectations. They hold a mirror up to the conventions of literature and in the glass, darkly, appear the very distortions inherent in our accepted way of thinking. Thus, they question standard notions of value and unbalance authority. They expose the arbitrariness behind our certainties and thereby open up new avenues of thinking. By presenting us with figures that resist classification, they show us the narrowness of usual categories and the failure of language to express the whole truth. \"There is a selection of answers which could all be adequate to some degree, there are no answers which are unequivocally correct\" 2. The vampire therefore works on two levels: textually, as the sharer whose intimacy shatters the fixedness of identity, and symbolically, as the text itself, which destroys any attempt at classification, remaining elusive to engage an intimacy with the reader, challenging him to his own, personal interpretation. The meaning of such a text is not created by the author alone. It resides in the interplay between text and reader, in the interaction of the specific with the general, in the changing position of the text within the field of discourse.\n\nThe vampire is one of the most powerful and enduring archetypes handed down to us by nineteenth-century literature, and remains, arguably, the most popular manifestation of the undead in popular culture. Perhaps more than any other monster, the vampire is a reflection of humanity. As Nina Auerbach says in her seminal work, Our Vampire, Ourselves, every generation creates its own vampire. Vampires embody our deepest fears and wildest desires, they represent the past that refuses to remain buried, our anxieties in the face of unavoidable social change and our fear of social and ethnic Others. They are signifiers that expose what we wish to conceal. Some vampires seem to uphold the status quo and a rigid patriarchal system, others defy the social and moral orders by freeing repressed desires and latent sexualities and by embodying in their very being all that is hated and suppressed by socio-normativity. This paper will examine the evolution of the vampire in popular narrative, discuss..."
