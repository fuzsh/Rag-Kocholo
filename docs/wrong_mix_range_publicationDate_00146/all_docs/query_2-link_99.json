        "text": "Literary Criticism and Theory is a course that will be offered across two semesters. Part I of this paper will be offered in Semester 1. This is a paper that introduces students to the major assumptions, perceptions, arguments and discussions that surround the study of ‘Literature’.\n\nLiterary Criticism and Theory – I traces the history of several ideas that connect the literary work to the world, the author and the reader. History is studied usually as a linear progression of events. The history (or herstory or history) of ideas, however, can be studied as a series of interwoven dialogues that may appear to be discontinuous and fissured. At the surface of Time, sometimes the debate may be around the author as the source of meaning. And at other times, the debate may be about how style contributes to meaning-making. As we look under the surface, we may be able to establish the connections that appear to have been lost simply because they were not foregrounded. And therefore, this paper foregrounds themes that are part of literary criticism in favour of a chronological study of contributions by thinkers and theorists.\n\nThe course will study how this cultural construct called ‘Literature’ has been received over the several years since Plato. It will look at what constitutes ‘value’; where is the location of meaning (in the writer? in the reader? in the written word?); what are the ways of reading a text; and, the contribution of canonical writes towards their understanding of what constitutes literature.\n\nThe course focuses largely on thinkers from the Euro-American canonical tradition. That tradition is undoubtedly at the centre. However, in every Unit, an attempt has been made to introduce foundational ideas about poetics that were at the heart of similar debates also in ‘India’.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nThe course aims to demonstrate how discussions around Literature - its production and consumption - emerge from an intellectual climate that is in dialogue with its past. Towards this end, this paper will:\n\n·Provide a broad overview of discussions around World – Author –Text - Reader.\n\n·Encourage students to participate and engage with the discussions that surround the production and consumption of literary texts.\n\n·Enable students to read seminal essays from the primary sources.\n\n·Persuade students to think creatively and interpret critically.\n\n·Help students to express their ideas coherently in both the written and the oral formats.\n\nMA English students have to undertake an internship of not less than 30 working days or 240 hours at any of the following: reputed research centers: recognized educational institutions; print, television, radio organizations; HR, PR firms; theatre groups/organizations; or any other approved by the Department.\n\nThe internship is to be undertaken during the second semester break. The internship is a mandatory requirement for the completion of the MA programme. However the Report and Viva will be conducted during Semester III and the marks will appear in the mark sheet of Semester III.\n\nThe students will have to give an internship proposal with the following details: organization where the student proposes to do the internship; reasons for the choice, nature of the internship, period of internship, relevant permission letters, if available, name of the mentor in the organization, email, telephone and mobile numbers of the person in the organization with whom CHRIST (Deemed to be University) could communicate matters related to internship. Typed proposals will have to be given at least a month before the end of the second semester.\n\nThe coordinator of the programme in consultation with the HOD will assign faculty members from the department as guides at least two weeks before the end of the second semester. The students will have to be in touch with the guides during the internship period either through person meetings, over the phone or through internet. At the place of internship the students are advised to be in constant touch with their mentors.\n\nAt the end of the required period of internship the candidates will submit a report in not less than 1500 words. The report should be submitted within first 10 days of reopening of the university for the III semester.\n\nApart from a photocopy of the letter from the organization stating the successful completion of internship, the report shall have the following parts.\n\no Introduction to the place of internship\n\no Reasons for the choice of the place and kind of internship\n\no Nature of internship\n\no Objectives of the internship\n\no Tasks undertaken\n\no Challenges Faced\n\no Learning outcome\n\no Suggestions, if any\n\no Conclusion\n\nA photocopy of the portfolio, if available may be given along with the report. However, the original output, if available should be presented during the internship report presentation.\n\nReport Format\n\n• 12 font size\n\n• Times New Roman font\n\n• One and half line spaced\n\n• Name, register no, and programme name, date of submission on the left-hand top corner of the page\n\n• Below that in the centre title of the report ‘Report of internship undertaken at ____ from ____ (date, month in words, year); no separate cover sheet to be attached.\n\nWithin 20 days from the day of re-opening, the department must hold a presentation by the students. Students should preferably be encouraged to make a PowerPoint presentation of their report. A minimum of 10 minutes should be given for each of the presenter. The maximum limit it left to the discretion of the evaluation committee. If the first year students are present they could also be made the audience.\n\nThe MA Dissertation intends to foster a research culture by focusing on critical reading and academic writing. Students are expected to make a submission at the end of the second year of their Postgraduate programme, MA in English with Communication Studies. Tapping on their interests in particular fields of study, the aim is to probe new areas of understanding, research domains and knowledge repositories. This paper will cater to diverse and disparate possibilities of doing research without limiting the scope of the paper to conventional methods and understandings of a dissertation. The aim is to cut across disciplines and patterns to equip students to cultivate reading habit with special focus on topics of research interest, honing writing skills with due emphasis on grammar and vocabulary and integrating reading and writing to communicate their knowledge about the chosen field of study in the most effective manner.\n\nThe focus will be on defining their area of study, contextualizing it within English studies. The students should have a comprehensive knowledge of the significance of the research they undertake. The prime focus will be to help students put into practice the theoretical knowledge that they have acquired from the Research Methodology paper (MEL 132).\n\nAs part of the requirements of the programme, the students will write a guided dissertation in the fourth semester of the course or they may undertake a guided project for the duration of the semester culminating in a Project Report. The choice between Dissertation or Project may be made on the basis of the student’s skill sets and career choice on the advice of the faculty instructor in consultation with the Course Coordinator and HoD.\n\nThe coordinator in consultation with the HoD will assign guides to the students before the end of the second semester. The student may also indicate the names of supervisors they prefer. However, the coordinator in consultation with the HoD will allot the students to members of the faculty in consultation with them. If the dissertation demands and the coordinator feels the need for a supervisor outside the department, coordinator may assign guides from other departments in consultation with them.\n\nThe students are expected to start working with their guides in their third semester. In their 3rd semester, the students will also participate in a colloquium where they will be expected to present their work to an internal examiner and will be graded on it. Apart from this, each student will have to either present/publish a paper related to their area of interest by the end of the first year. By the end of the 4th semester, each student should have published atleast one article in an UGC approved journal. These publications and presentations will carry marks and also ensure the acceptance of the dissertation for final evaluation.\n\nThe dissertation should be submitted to the coordinator in the prescribed format in the penultimate week of the fourth semester. The evaluation and viva should be completed within a month from the last working day of the semester. The thesis will be evaluated by preferably external examiner and by the guide out of 100 each and the average of both the evaluations should be awarded out of 100. If there is a difference of more than 20 marks, a third evaluation should by both the evaluators together. The viva should be conducted out of 50 each and average of the two should be taken. Only the supervisor and the external evaluator shall evaluate the thesis. The external examiner should have valid research experience, namely, MPhil or PhD or equivalent qualification, or should have undertaken a research project from reputed organizations in social sciences or humanities, or should have research publications preferably in refereed journals.\n\nThe course plan drawn for the dissertation needs to specify the evaluation rubrics/parameters that would be used to evaluate the students. Each supervisor can draw their course plans. The evaluation of the dissertation will be based on the rubrics specified in the course plan.\n\nThe Department of English can decide to evolve with a common set of parameters or rubrics for both dissertation and project. These can further be modified to suit the needs of individual students.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nAt the end of the course the students will:\n\n• Understand research in different areas of interest\n\n• Develop research skills in areas of interest\n\n• Produce research in areas of relevance\n\n• Gain a clear understanding of the different concerns in the areas of english studies\n\n• Critique ideas with specific focus theoretical and methodological positions\n\nThe MA dissertation can be:\n\n• A thesis with a definite research objective, questions, thesis statement, analysis and findings. The thesis can be in any domain but should be linked to Literature. The students can undertake their research in Literature, Languages, Cultural studies, Film Studies, ELT, Linguistics. Since the prime criterion is to strengthen the reading culture, the emphasis will be on an exhaustive bibliography (minimum of 15 research articles / papers connected to the immediate area of study and feeding into the research undertaken). It is mandatory that the background is clear and the students have to be abreast of the latest developments in the chosen field of study (contemporariness is the binding concern). The research has to definitely contribute to the existing body of knowledge and the students should be able to articulate their questions and focus with utmost clarity. Any mere comparison or description will not be considered unless the student qualifies the necessary understanding as deemed by the supervising guide for the field chosen.\n\n• A biography which will contextualize and enquire into the literary, political and socio-cultural climate of the time period of the individual taken up for study. The aim is to go beyond a simple biography and read the life history and socio-political history as co-texts than contexts.\n\n• An ethnographic study thoroughly rooted in the notion of ‘writing a culture’. It involves a perfect blend of description and interpretation with multi-methods of data collection and analysis.\n\n• An action research that is simultaneously participatory and collaborative. The stress will be on the procedure and the analysis of the outcome. The implementation should feed into these processes perfectly.\n\n• A literary translation with due emphasis on the mechanics of translation and the critical elucidation of the process involved. The translated piece should subscribe to the common understanding of Translation studies based on the invisibility of the translator.\n\n• A project emanating from internships and research associations in the past, but with connection to the core understanding of English with Communication studies.\n\n• The dissertation will enable students to bring about a confluence of their research interest and academic orientation, with a definite understanding of research and its parameters. Every student will have to be thorough with the different aspects of any dissertation.\n\nAs postgraduate students they should be able to write clearly:\n\nA clear abstract stating -\n\no The area and purpose of the study\n\no The research problem\n\no The methods\n\no The conclusion and findings\n\no The significance of the research project\n\nA literature review to -\n\no Place each work in the context of study\n\no Describe the relationship between different works\n\no Unearth different interpretations, applications and gaps / limitations\n\no Situate the research within the framework of existing research\n\nAnnotated Bibliography to highlight -\n\no The problem\n\no Research questions\n\no Sources\n\no Relevance\n\nAs stated above the prime aim of the dissertation is to help students implement:\n\n• Critical reading –\n\n• Seeking mere information is not the sole aim\n\n• Unearthing and understanding new ways of thinking (central aim, reasoning, evidence and evaluation) about the topic\n\n• Academic Writing –\n\n• Writing as a process\n\n• Seeking interpretations\n\nUsing specific methodologies relevant to the topic of study\n\n• Asking questions\n\n• Building arguments\n\n• Bringing in evidence\n\n• Documentation that breathes credibility\n\nResearchers are expected to follow a definite strategy while carrying out their study.
