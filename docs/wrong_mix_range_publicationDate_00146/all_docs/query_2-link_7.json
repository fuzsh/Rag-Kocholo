It provides a chronological history of Science Fiction (SF) with an emphasis on literature and film, and it includes other useful resources, such as a glossary of terms, an extensive list of SF definitions, additional resources, a syllabus with hyperlinked readings available online, and video lectures.\n\nIt tells a story, but not the only story, about SF history. It’s also an experiment in using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to assist with editing a large body of text, in this case over 60,000 words.\n\nWho made YASFT?\n\nYASFT was written by Jason W. Ellis, Associate Professor of English at the New York City College of Technology, CUNY where he is also the Coordinator of the City Tech Science Fiction Collection, an over-600-linear-foot archive of near-complete runs of the major SF magazines, novels, anthologies, and scholarship. If you have suggestions, feedback, or corrections, please email them to him at jellis at citytech dot cuny dot edu.\n\nWhy was YASFT made?\n\nWhile on sabbatical during the 2023-2024 academic year, he was approached by an academic publisher about writing a textbook on SF. That project appealed to him greatly, but he understood that it would take a tremendous amount of time and energy to complete–time and energy that he unfortunately did not have. While he had to decline the offer, it made him think that it wouldn’t take too much time and energy to convert his SF course lecture notes developed over the past 10 years into a less expansive textbook that still had tremendous use value an open educational resource (OER) that he could put in readers’ hands almost immediately. Also, he imagined that leveraging generative artificial intelligence technologies, which he had been experimenting with and documenting over the past year and a half, might speed up the editing that such a project would need.\n\nWhat he imagined was a single webpage that chronicled the history of SF in about 60,000 words (which included a syllabus, a list of SF definitions, links, and other resources). A single page would be easily hyperlinked to, and being a single page, it would be easy to copy its content in accordance with an open license (see section on “How Can YASFT Be Used?” below). Not only would such a resource be useful to his students but also to students anywhere with Internet access–either by finding the YASFT or having it assigned by their professors. It would also be more accessible than other free resources such as the SFRA Review‘s detailed but dispersed 101 Series, and be more compact and to-the-point than the impressively detailed and multimodal A Virtual Introduction to Science Fiction edited by Lars Schmeink. Unlike the important print textbooks on the market (some of which are in the further reading appendix below), YASFT would be free.\n\nWhy is it called YASFT?\n\n“Yet Another” is a computer naming joke that is often used to denote a new piece of software where there already exists other programs that basically do the same thing. Nevertheless, the programmer releases the yet another named application, because she believes it has something to offer users that the other already existing applications do not. Similarly, there are a number of other SF textbooks on the market. Some are far superior to YASFT and others claim not to be SF textbooks when in fact they are (another joke; see Appendix 3: Futher Reading for a list of other textbooks). Calling this SF textbook yet another one signals its entrance in a field of others, but it also says that there is something that sets it apart.\n\nHow can YASFT be used?\n\nYASFT is released under an Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Creative Commons License. It’s freely available to be read as it is. However, if anyone would like to use it in another way, there are licensing terms that must be followed: “This license requires that reusers give credit to the creator. It allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, for noncommercial purposes only. If others modify or adapt the material, they must license the modified material under identical terms.”\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nHow was YASFT made?\n\nYASFT was created using the following workflow. It began as typed lecture notes used by Jason Ellis in his SF classes at Georgia Tech (2013-2014) and City Tech (2014-present). Some paragraphs and sections were already written out while large portions were bullet point lists of words and incomplete thoughts. The latter were copied section-by-section into a text editor and revised into sentences and paragraphs, which were fed into a generative AI with instructions to improve the writing.\n\nChatGPT was not used. Instead, an open source generative AI was run on a desktop workstation with an NVIDIA RTX A6000 video card, which can load a 65B to 70B parameter large language model (LLM) into its 48GB GDDR6 memory. For comparison, many claim GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter model and there are rumors that GPT-4 is a 1.7 trillion parameter model. While the LLMs used are smaller than those in production by OpenAI, they are quite capable for generating and editing text. Also, it is preferable to run one’s own hardware and software rather than renting someone else’s.\n\nUsing obabooga’s text-generation-webui to load Tim Dettmer’s Guanaco 65B model (based on Meta’s Llama 1) and Mikael110’s Llama 2 version of Guanaco (based on Llama 2), the generative AI models were prompted with a variation on a copywriter prompt developed by Dave Birss for a course on LinkedIn Learning:\n\nYou are an expert copywriter with more than 20 years of experience in writing high-performing copy. I want you to rewrite the following copy to make it better. Rewrite it with an engaged but scholarly tone. Correct misspelled words and bad grammar. Vary the length of sentences to make the text more interesting. Do not omit any facts or information in the copy. Do not incorporate outside information. Use only the information contained in the copy. The copy I want you to improve is:\n\nDepending on the output, changes were made to improve it, such as swapping “editor” for “copywriter” and “engaging textbook” for “high-performing copy.” The prompt needed tweaking throughout the editing process, especially to avoid the introduction of facts or names offered by the LLMs, for each section of text. It’s important to note that some but not all of YASFT‘s paragraphs were edited by the LLMs. The generative AI was not used in any way to add or contribute facts, information, anecdotes, or quotes. All quoted material from outside sources is documented in-text. Most links lead to relevant pages on Wikipedia. Any incorrect facts, dates, or quotations are the author’s fault.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI owe a deep debt of gratitude to Lisa Yaszek, Regents Professor of Science Fiction Studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who showed me that you can make a living by teaching and researching SF. Her Summer 2002 SF class taught me about SF and how to teach SF. She has been a friend and mentor to me for over 20 years.\n\nYASFT is also enriched by what I learned in other classes at Georgia Tech taught by Carol Senf, Narin Hassan, Kenneth Knoespel, Robert Wood, and Eugene Thacker; at the University of Liverpool: Andy Sawyer, David Seed, Peter Wright, and at Kent State University: Mack Hassler, Tammy Clewell, Babacar M’Baye, Robert Trogden, and Kevin Floyd (1967-2019). Scholarship by Brian Aldiss (1925-2017), Marleen Barr, Ritch Calvin, Doug Davis, Rob Latham, and Patricia S. Warrick (1925-2023) were also important to my thinking about specific SF topics and how I might approach them in the classroom.\n\nI also would like to thank my wife Yu-Fang Lin, who helped me write the Taiwanese SF chapter and several blog posts on SF fandom in Taiwan. Without her, I wouldn’t have had access to the exciting SF in the Republic of China where democracy, thankfully, still stands.\n\nPreface\n\nMy Science Fiction (SF) journey began a long time ago. In fact, my first memory is what set me on this path. I was sitting on the floor of my family’s mobile home in Hortense, Georgia. I looked up from my toys long enough to see the whoosh and swoop of the Millennium Falcon weaving through the asteroids in a trailer for the film The Empire Strikes Back (1980), which was going to be playing at the local drive-in. Those images became an indelible memory for me.\n\nWhile Star Wars fed the first coordinates into my navigational computer for SF, it wasn’t long before I began hopping galaxies aboard the USS Enterprise from Star Trek or traveling through time and space inside a police box that was bigger on the inside on Doctor Who.\n\nLater, I asked Marty Magda, my friend from Boy Scouts who worked at the local Waldenbooks, who I should be reading from the “Science Fiction and Fantasy” section. He led me through the aisles to the back left corner of the store. He advised Asimov, Bradbury, and Clarke. So, I started with I, Robot (1950), The Martian Chronicles (1950), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).\n\nWhen I first started as an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, I heard about a crazy class about SF taught by the singular Bud Foote. His teaching style and classes were so popular that I was never able to get in before I failed out. Reading and viewing SF gave me solace while I worked for Internet service providers and tried to figure out how to get back on track at Tech.\n\nThankfully, I made my way back to Georgia Tech, but I couldn’t anticipate how SF would radically transform my way forward in life. I learned that Professor Foote had retired and a new professor, Dr. Lisa Yaszek, was teaching the SF class. With uncertainty, I signed up. Prof. Yaszek’s class was transformative to me in the way that Archer Sloane’s literature class was to the eponymous Stoner in John William’s 1965 novel. It showed me a different way to think about and enjoy SF that was beyond my ability to imagine up to that point. Slowly, a new way forward seemed possible that combined my deep love of SF with the potential of a career in academia.\n\nAlong my journey, I have continued to carry what I learned in Prof. Yaszek’s class, and the classes of my other professors. Each of them helped me along my path in different but signficant ways, offering new knowledge, new perspectives, encouragement, invaluable feedback, and models for teaching. I paid attention and listened. I applied what I had learned and observed into my teaching: first, at Kent State where I was a graduate student, then at Georgia Tech where I was a Brittain Fellow, and now at City Tech where I am an Associate Professor. It has been and continues to be my goal to pay forward all of the help that I received that made it possible to be where I am today.\n\nIt was that idea of paying forward in a new way that inspired Yet Another Science Fiction Textbook (YASFT). While it’s a resource that I will share with my students, it has the potential to reach a wider audience within and without the academy. It might be read by a student halfway around the world, it might be assigned by a professor in a different time zone, or it might be seen by someone who discovered it from a web search.\n\nHowever you happened to find your way here, I hope that the YASFT will be useful to you in some way, whether it teaches you a little about the history of SF or gives you some ideas about how to teach SF. My joy in this is the hope that the YASFT might help you on your own SF journey–wherever it might take you.\n\nOrigins of Science Fiction\n\nScience Fiction (SF), or the cultural expression in writing, film, music, video games, and other art forms of the effects of science and technology on individuals and society through imaginative narratives involving other spaces and times, has its roots in our distant past before the idea of science was invented. Those early stories imagined fantastic creatures, incredible powers, and epic voyages to far off lands and outer space. And, they certainly inspired the genre of stories and other art to come that we now call SF.\n\nEarly Fantastic Stories\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known works of literature dating back to ~2150-2000 BC, serves as a critical precursor to science fiction. This Mesopotamian tale chronicles the adventures of King Gilgamesh of Uruk and his companion, Enkidu, the Wildman. Their escapades, including slaying the great mountain keeper and the Bull of Heaven, invoked the wrath of the gods. Following Enkidu’s demise, Gilgamesh embarked on a quest for eternal life, discovering that although longevity may elude him, immortality through memory can be attained. A surviving fragment from the poem poetically depicts Gilgamesh as “He who saw the Deep” or “He who sees the unknown.” This epic represents a pivotal moment in the history of storytelling, where the boundaries between reality and imagination were blurred, laying the groundwork for the genre we now know as science fiction. Reflecting it’s significance and reach, the Epic of Gilgamesh was woven into “Darmok,” one of the most popular episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation that originally aired in 1991.\n\nHesiod’s Theogony from the 8th century BC introduced the mythical figure of Prometheus, one of the Titans, precursors to the Olympian gods. As a champion of humanity, he recognized our intellectual potential and daringly bestowed us with the gift of fire – an act that led to his punishment by being chained to a rock and having his liver devoured daily by an eagle, only to be regenerated for the next feeding. This cycle continued until Hercules intervened and set him free. Another notable work is Ovid’s Metamorphoses (8 AD), which showcased transformations, extraordinary events, divine powers, and amorous relationships between gods and humans. Additionally, Lucian’s True History (2nd century) explored concepts such as space travel, extraterrestrial life, and intergalactic conflict. Beowulf (8th-11th century) is an epic poem recounting the heroic battles of Beowulf against the monsters Grendel, Grendel’s mother, and ultimately the dragon. Lastly, the 13th-century German epic poem Nibelungenlied or The Song of the Nibelungs tells the tale of Siegfried, the dragon-slayer, his unjust demise, and his wife’s vengeance upon those responsible for it.\n\nIn Utopia (1516), Thomas More (1478-1535) introduces the term which has come to represent an idealized world. This philosophical treatise outlines a rational and communistically-planned city-state where philosophy permeates daily life. Interestingly, the work’s title has dual meanings in its Greek origins – ‘eu-topos’, meaning both ‘good place’ and ‘no place’. Johannes Kepler’s Somnium (completed in 1610) explores space travel and alternate perspectives of the Earth. The text includes extensive footnotes explaining planetary observation from other celestial bodies, concealing Kepler’s support for the heliocentric model of the solar system. In William Shakespeare‘s (1564-1616) The Tempest (1610-11), Prospero, a powerful sorcerer, rules over an island alongside his daughter Miranda, two servants: the monster Caliban and the spirit Ariel. He conjures a storm to wreck a ship and reclaim his lost titles and standing. Comparisons can be drawn between Prospero and Victor Frankenstein (see next chapter) as they use their abilities with disregard for the potential repercussions. The Tempest is also the inspiration for the 1956 SF film Forbidden Planet (see SF Film Through the 1950s chapter below). New Atlantis (1627) by Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) portrays a utopian society named Bensalem prioritizing science and knowledge. Lastly, Jonathan Swift’s (1667-1745) Gulliver’s Travels (1726) uses its story of fantastic journeys to veil its biting political satire. While the fantastic elements of the story are certainly interesting, it’s important to remember that it, like SF to follow, is about the here-and-now.\n\nScientific Revolution\n\nIn the wake of the Scientific Revolution, the Age of Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, Romanticism, and the Gothic movement, science fiction emerged as a distinct genre. This unique combination of historical and cultural shifts laid the foundation for the development of science fiction and its captivating exploration of technology, society, and the future.\n\nFor centuries, the prevailing view held by many was that the Earth lay at the center of the universe. However, during the Scientific Revolution which started in the late 16th century, pioneering thinkers such as Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) put forth a radical new theory – that the Sun lies at the center of our solar system. This concept of a heliocentric universe marked a significant departure from established beliefs and paved the way for groundbreaking discoveries about our cosmos.\n\nAt its core, the Scientific Revolution represented an unprecedented shift towards empiricism – the notion that knowledge can only truly come from direct observations and experiments. Adherents like the German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), who discovered elliptical planetary orbits; Italian astronomer and engineer Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), widely regarded as the father of modern astronomy; English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton (1642-1727), whose laws of motion and gravity laid the foundation for classical physics; and French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, the father of analytic geometry who also invented what came to be called Cartesian coordinates, all contributed to this revolutionary movement. Through careful experimentation, thorough analysis, and persistent inquiry, these visionaries expanded our comprehension of reality beyond what had previously been imagined.\n\nAge of Enlightenment\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment, also referred to as the Age of Reason or simply The Enlightenment, emerged in England during the seventeenth century. This period was marked by a distinctive optimistic outlook towards the present, which stood in stark contrast to the perceived darkness of the past. The illumination that characterized this era arose from a widespread skepticism regarding the existing social order and prevailing wisdom.\n\nThe defining features of the Age of Enlightenment were rooted in a profound reverence for reason as the most consequential and beneficial faculty of human nature. Through the application of reason, individuals could emancipate themselves from antiquated, dogmatic, and superstitious beliefs that had hitherto constrained them. By cultivating rational thinking, people could attain not just accurate cognition but also ethical conduct.\n\nAdvocates of the Enlightenment maintained that reason held the key to unlocking humanity’s collective potential for achieving terrestrial perfection. They believed that steady advancements in philosophy and science would ultimately lead to universal equality and justice. Consequently, all members of society ought to be treated equally under the law, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nCentral to the ideology of the Enlightenment was the conviction that opinions and beliefs must be grounded solely in reason rather than tradition or religious authority. Moreover, all pursuits should strive to augment knowledge and understanding instead of merely appealing to emotions or personality traits.\n\nFor centuries, human civilization had been constrained by manual labor and limited resources. However, between 1760 and 1840, a remarkable transformation took place that would change the course of history forever – the Industrial Revolution. This era marked a significant shift from traditional methods of farming and manufacturing towards mechanized processes, which revolutionized production and transportation. The result was a surge in productivity, efficiency, and profitability that drove economic growth both domestically and internationally. Agricultural innovations played a crucial role in this transformation, as they enabled larger crop yields and better land management practices. Meanwhile, new modes of production allowed for mass production at unprecedented speeds while also introducing novel forms of organization within factories. The impact of these changes cannot be overstated; they laid the foundation for modern industry and set us on an irreversible path toward global interconnectedness through trade networks spanning continents.\n\nRomanticism\n\nDuring the British Romantic period (1785-1830), social change and revolution sparked a literary and artistic movement including significant figures William Wordsworth (1770-1850), Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834), Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), and Edmund Burke (1729-1797).\n\nRomanticism is characterized by its focus on five key elements – imagination, intuition, idealism, inspiration, and individuality. These ideals were embodied in notable works such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Lyrical Ballads (1798), which celebrated the power of the human mind and the spontaneous emotional responses evoked through poetic expression.\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley’s “A Defense of Poetry” (1821, published posthumously 1840) further underscored the importance of imagination in bringing the natural world into our minds, transforming it through the creative process, and imbuing it with human meaning. For the Romantics, this connection between nature and human experience was central to their innovative approach to literature. They challenged traditional materials, forms, and styles, prioritizing novelty and experimentation in their works.\n\nWordsworth believed that great poetry emerged organically from “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.” This sentiment highlights the significance of emotion as a driving force behind literary creation during the Romantic era. In conclusion, the British Romantic period marked a pivotal moment in literary history, where the boundaries of traditional literature were pushed by visionaries like Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley who championed imagination, individuality, and the intrinsic bond between humans and nature.\n\nEdmund Burke’s Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757) reveals a distinct contrast between the concepts of the sublime and the beautiful. The sublime, favored by the romantics, is characterized by its immense scale and ruggedness; it exhibits a preference for irregularity while still maintaining solidity and massiveness. This notion embraces darkness, terror, and peril. Conversely, the beautiful, which was admired by the neoclassicists, embodies delicacy, smoothness, and subtle deviation from straight lines. It shuns obscurity and is founded upon pleasure.\n\nThe advent of Romanticism marked a transition from writing about others to a focus on the self – the narrative voice was assumed to be that of the author themselves or solitary figures existing outside societal structures, engaged in challenging and prolonged quests. During the early stages of the French Revolution, many writers perceived humans as possessing boundless aspirations towards an infinite good, inspired by the individual’s imagination.\n\nThe Gothic\n\nThe Gothic style emerged during the Romantic period as a distinct literary and artistic mode, characterized by its dark portrayal of humanity’s complex relationship with nature. This mysterious and often unforgiving external reality serves to position humans as subjects to its whims. Key features of the Gothic tradition include settings typically rooted in isolation, such as castles or ancient structures, supernatural elements, secrets, boundary crossings, and evocative emotions like suspense, horror, foreboding, and terror.\n\nHorace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto: A Gothic Story (1764) marks the earliest known example of this genre. Other notable works within the Gothic canon include Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), Matthew Lewis’ The Monk (1796), and Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897). Through these texts, we see the enduring impact of the Gothic mode on our understanding and representation of humanity’s intricate connection to the natural world.\n\nMary Shelley’s Frankenstein\n\nThe British Science Fiction writer and critic Brian Aldiss (and others) argue that Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus (1818) is the first example of what we now call science fiction. Of course, at the time Frankenstein was published, there was not yet a term for that kind of literature. It draws on many generic elements—namely: Gothic literature, mythology, and travel narratives and it builds on ideas that were of utmost importance at that time: including: the Age of Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, Romanticism, and the Gothic.\n\nMary Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797-1851) is the daughter of the two of the most famous radicals of that era. Her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797), was a pioneering feminist theorist who fought for equal rights for women and access to education for women. She argues for these things in her groundbreaking work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). To put things into context, she began by establishing women are rational, like men, and their supposed inferiority comes from their being denied an education. Her father, William Godwin (1756-1836) was a minister turned atheist who gained notoriety and fame through his writing, including Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Morals and Happiness (1793), which argues that humanity can progress through individual rationality and anarchism or the absence of an imposing government, and Things as They Are; or The Adventures of Caleb Williams (1794), which mirrors what Godwin sees as tyrannical government and its destructive effects on individuals. Mary Wollstonecraft died 10 days after giving birth to Mary due to puerperal septicemia. Godwin and his daughter Mary remained very close and he carried on his wife’s ideals by educating Mary and her half-sister Fanny Imlay (1794-1816).\n\nFrankenstein is the first novel to have a character make a choice between alchemy and the scientific method. It extrapolates or imagines where things might go based on the sciences of Shelley’s day. It explores the morality or ethics of human use of science and technology and what effects that use might have on others. Much like some of the definitions that you’ve read in our class so far, it is the first story to present a human problem that pivots on science and technology. Unlike a gothic story, Frankenstein is firmly rooted in scientific extrapolation and rationality instead of the supernatural and irrationality.\n\nFrankenstein tells the story of the scientist Victor Frankenstein, who turned away from pseudoscience and alchemy and pursued the sciences of chemistry and galvanism to discover how to give life to inanimate matter. He constructs a creature that looks like a large man, but he abandons it in horror and disgust. The creature, a being with a mind like a tabula rasa or blank slate, uses reason, observation, and trial and error to learn how to survive, learn to speak, read, and write. Believing that he had mastered language enough to convince a family of refugees to accept him, he confronts them but they recoil in horror. Angry at humanity for how he has been treated, the creature chooses vengeance against his creator. He kills Victor’s younger brother William, and frames the innocent Justine. Then, he bargains with his creator—build a mate for him and he will leave humanity. Victor agrees to his creature’s demand, travels to the far reaches of Scotland to create a female version of his creature, but then realizing she will have free will and reason just like his creature and might not want to go along with his bargain, he destroys his work before giving her life so as to avoid her unknown choices and possibly the creation of a new race of beings. Enraged, his creature tells Victor, “I will be with you on your wedding night” and flees. The creature kills Victor’s best friend Clerval, and Victor is suspected of the crime. Released, Victor makes his way back to Switzerland to marry Elizabeth. After the wedding, the creature kills Elizabeth and Victor pursues him all the way to the arctic where Victor meets Captain Walton. After Victor’s death, the creature appears to Captain Walton, laments his creator’s passing, and disappears, vowing to end his own life.\n\nMary Shelley published her novel Frankenstein, Or, The Modern Prometheus originally in 1818 anonymously. Its origins lie in June 1816 of the Year Without a Summer when Mary Shelley; Percy Bysshe Shelley, the poet and Mary’s soon-to-be husband who was also still married to Harriet Westbrook (1795-1816); Lord Byron (1788-1824), the poet and member of the House of Lords; Claire Clairmont (1798-1879), Mary Shelley’s stepsister); and John Polidori (1795-1821), a writer and physician, spent time together in a house on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland. There, they agreed to have a competition of ghost stories–each person would tell a story of their devising. Of their attempts, Mary Shelley’s was the most successful and influential after she expanded and published it.\n\nThere are three editions of Frankenstein: the original 1818 edition in three volumes, the 1823 edition in two volumes, and the 1831 edition in one volume that was heavily edited and included a new preface by Mary Shelley.\n\nThe story is told in an epistolary form. This means that it is told through letters between Captain Robert Walton and his sister Margaret Walton Saville. There are these narrative frames: Walton’s letters to his sister Margaret Saville contains: Victor Frankenstein’s narrative told to Walton contains: the Creature’s narrative told to Victor who recounts it to Walton. Then, the Creature’s mourning his dead creator as told to Walton.\n\nAnother way to visualize the narrative frames is:\n\n(Walton's letters to his sister Margaret Saville\n\n(Victor's narrative told to Walton\n\n(the Creature's narrative told to Victor\n\nand recounted to Walton\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(the Creature speaks to Walton above his dead creator\n\n)\n\n)\n\nScience-Saturated Novel\n\nFrankenstein is a science-saturated novel. It is the first novel that demonstrates a choice made between the pre-scientific and the scientific and its plot hinges on the new sciences of biochemistry, anatomy, and galvanism. Its characters: Victor, Walton, and the Creature are all scientists of a kind driven by curiosity. Walton goes on his voyage of discovery to find what attracts the compass needle, or magnetism. He wants to “regulate a thousand celestial observations” and find a new path to the Americas. Essentially, he wants to Go where no man has gone before (where have we heard that before?). Note, however, the influence of romanticism on Walton—he was a poet for some time, and he writes, “I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.”\n\nThe introduction by Mary Shelley and the original preface by Percy Bysshe Shelley mention “Dr. Darwin.” They are referring to Charles Darwin’s (1809-1882) grandfather, Erasmus. Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) was a natural philosopher whose ideas were further developed by his grandson Charles. Erasmus was an atheist, too. Even though Mary Shelley’s father and Erasmus never met, they were attacked together in public as atheist writers.\n\nBiological galvanism is the application of electrical current to muscles to elicit their contraction. Today, we call this electrophysiology. Galvanism was state-of-the-art science during Mary Shelley’s teenage years. Luigi Galvani (1737-1798) is the Italian scientist who experimented on this phenomenon with dissected animals in the late 1700s.\n\nVictor Frankenstein’s Hubris\n\nFrankenstein’s act of creation is an example of the concept of hubris, or an excessive confidence and defiance that challenges established boundaries. This idea draws from Greek mythology where hubris referred to acts deemed arrogant or offensive towards the gods, often leading to retribution by Nemesis. For instance, Prometheus displayed hubris when he believed himself wiser than Zeus, bestowing humans with fire despite the ruler’s decree against it; this ultimately led to Prometheus’ punishment. Similarly, in the King James Version of the Bible (Proverbs 16:18), “Pride goes before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall,” highlights how hubris can lead to one’s downfall.\n\nFrankenstein exhibits hubris through his ambition to create life without considering potential consequences or responsibilities toward his creation. His actions reflect a belief that his insights and achievements grant him superior authority to determine the fate of his creation. The creature becomes Frankenstein’s nemesis, serving as an unavoidable force of retribution for his hubris. In popular culture, a nemesis is commonly regarded as an arch enemy.\n\nCritique of the Age of Enlightenment\n\nFrankenstein serves as a critique of the Age of Enlightenment by delving into the consequences of scientific and rational knowledge on society. Victor’s inner conflict highlights the complex relationship between progressive thought and ethical implications. This idea resonates with the atrocities of the 20th century, including World War I and II, the Holocaust, and the atomic bomb. The book’s ambiguous tone and tensions create a captivating message that still resonates today. Mary Wollstonecraft’s impact is evident in Elizabeth Lavenza’s education alongside Victor, showcasing gender disparities in intellectual opportunities. William Godwin’s ideas on justice and equality are also explored throughout the story. The character pairings of Victor Frankenstein and his creation, Walton and Victor, and Victor and Clerval represent various interpretations of doppelgangers and the intricate relationship between appearance and inner psyche. Ultimately, Frankenstein examines societal obligations, communal dynamics, and isolation.\n\nVictor’s unwavering commitment to rationality and empirical methods distinguishes him from those who rely on mysticism and illusion. Through his investigations in chemistry, physiology, and anatomy, he unravels the mysteries of animation – how matter acquires life. His pursuit of perpetual existence draws parallels to the legendary quest of Gilgamesh for everlasting life. The Creature embodies reason, analyzing the world through experimentation, reflection, and hypothesis testing. His cognitive prowess encompasses both induction (from specific observations to broad inferences) and deduction (from universal principles to precise conclusions). Clerval personifies the Romantic spirit, embodying artistic ideals and imagination. Meanwhile, Captain Walton’s journey represents a transition from Romantic inclinations toward a quest for knowledge grounded in empirical observation. In this regard, he occupies a unique position between the realms of Romantic poetry and scientific inquiry–a liminal figure between Victor and Clerval.\n\nTabula Rasa\n\nAnother key scientific and philosophical debate in Frankenstein concerns the biology of mind and the question: Does the human brain form with inherent information or is it a tabula rasa or blank slate? This is called the innateness question. Even with the rudimentary understanding of human biology and specifically of the brain at that time, it was a hotly discussed topic, because knowing the answer to that question determined how philosophers were able to establish foundations for concepts such as equality and justice. It also lent itself to debates about the human organism as simply another animal or a special creature imbued with a soul by God.\n\nShelley seems to side with John Locke (1632-1704), who was an empiricist, or one who believed that the mind was a blank slate and we acquired language and knowledge through empirical trial and error. Essentially, human beings become who they are by figuring things out.\n\nMore recently, it seems that the rationalists, represented by René Descartes (1596-1650), won out in the end due in part to the theory of Universal Grammar that makes humans receptive to learning a language early in life. Perhaps Shelley sided with the empiricists, because at that time, the empirical view did not require the invention of a soul.\n\nAmong other places, such as Treatise of Man (1662), Descartes wrote about the pineal gland in a letter dated 29 January 1640 to Lazare Meyssonnier: “As a beginning, I will answer the question you asked me about the function of the little gland called conarion [Descartes’ term for the pineal gland]. My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed. The reason I believe this is that I cannot find any part of the brain, except this, which is not double. Since we see only one thing with two eyes, and hear only one voice with two ears, and in short never have more than one thought at a time, it must necessarily be the case that the impressions which enter by the two eyes or by the two ears, and so on, unite with each other in some part of the body before being considered by the soul. Now it is impossible to find any such place in the whole head except this gland; moreover it is situated in the most suitable possible place for this purpose, in the middle of all the concavities; and it is supported and surrounded by the little branches of the carotid arteries which bring the spirits into the brain” (Descartes, René. “To Meyssonnier, 29 January 1640.” The Philosophical Writings of\n\nDescartes, Volume 3: The Correspondence. translated by John Cottingham, Robert\n\nStoothoff, Dugald Murdoch, and Anthony Kenny, Cambridge UP, pp. 143-144).\n\nAccording to Gert-Jan Lokhorst, Descartes considered the pineal gland, “as the principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed” (Lokhorst, Gert-Jan. “Descartes and the Pineal Gland.” The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition). edited by Edward N. Zalta. 21 June 2011, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/, par. 1). The pineal gland represented the unity of thought and soul that Descartes sought. What influence Descartes’ thoughts on the pineal gland had on Dick is unknown, but it is worth raising as a point of contact, because like Dick, Descartes wrote in his Treatise of Man about human beings by imagining creatures like us, but mechanical (and made by God): “These men will be composed, as we are, of a soul and a body; and I must first separately describe for you the body; then, also separately, the soul; and finally I must show you how these two natures would have to be joined and united to constitute men resembling us./I assume their body to be but a statue, an earthen machine formed intentionally by God to be as much as possible like us. Thus not only does He give it externally the shapes and colors of all the parts of our bodies; He also places inside it all the pieces required to make it walk, eat, breathe, and imitate whichever of our own functions can be imagined to proceed from mere matter and to depend entirely on the arrangement of our organs./We see clocks, artificial fountains, mills, and similar machines which, though made entirely by man, lack not the power to move of themselves, in various ways. And I think you will agree that the present machine could have even more sorts of movements than I have imagined and more ingenuity than I have assigned, for our supposition is that it was created by God” (Descartes, René. Treatise of Man. translated by Thomas Steele Hall, Prometheus Books, 2003, pp. 1-4).\n\nIn 1972, John R. Searle says of Noam Chomsky’s revolution in linguistics: “The most spectacular conclusion about the nature of the human mind that Chomsky derives from his work in linguistics is that his results vindicate the claims of the seventeenth-century rationalist philosophers, Descartes, Leibniz, and others, that there are innate ideas in the mind. The rationalists claim that human beings have knowledge that is not derived from experience but is prior to all experience and determines the form of the knowledge that can be gained from experience. The empiricist tradition by contrast, from Locke down to contemporary behaviorist learning theorists, has tended to treat the mind as a tabula rasa, containing no knowledge prior to experience and placing no constraints on the forms of possible knowledge, except that they must be derived from experience by such mechanisms as the association of ideas or the habitual connection of stimulus and response. For empiricists all knowledge comes from experience, for rationalists some knowledge is implanted innately and prior to experience. In his bluntest moods, Chomsky claims to have refuted the empiricists and vindicated the rationalists” (Searle, John R. The New York Review of Books, 29 June 1972, https://web.archive.org/web/20151210212202/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/06/29/a-special-supplement-chomskys-revolution-in-lingui/, section iv, par. 1).\n\nHe goes on to say, “Now, in spite of all these facts the child who learns his first language, claims Chomsky, performs a remarkable intellectual feat: in “internalizing” the grammar he does something akin to constructing a theory of the language. The only explanation for all these facts, says Chomsky, is that the mind is not a tabula rasa, but rather, the child has the form of the language already built into his mind before he ever learns to talk. The child has a universal grammar, so to speak, programmed into his brain as part of his genetic inheritance. In the most ambitious versions of this theory, Chomsky speaks of the child as being born ‘with a perfect knowledge of universal grammar, that is, with a fixed schematism that he uses,…in acquiring language.’ A child can learn any human language on the basis of very imperfect information. That being the case, he must have the forms that are common to all human languages as part of his innate mental equipment” (Searle, section iv, par. 5).\n\nProto-SF\n\nWhile we can point to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein as being the first work of Science Fiction (SF), there took a number of historical and cultural developments for the literary genre of science fiction to take the form that we know it as. These science fictional stories published after Frankenstein until the Pulp SF era can be called Proto-SF.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nHistorically, a different philosophical and scientific worldview had to emerge. This took place in the seventeenth century, but it took time—well into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—before it was more widely established. These were the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution discussed previously.\n\nAlso, the social revolutions of the late eighteenth century, such as those of America and France, demonstrated that social structures were fragile and possible to change. These revolutions were made possible by the changing worldview of the Age of Enlightenment and what followed—including the political thinking of people like Mary Shelley’s parents—William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft.\n\nSF emerged through the fusion of several distinct earlier literary forms. Fantastical journeys, including ancient tales like the Epic of Gilgamesh (2100 BC) and Homer’s Odyssey (800 BC or older), and later works such as Cyrano de Bergerac’s Other Worlds (1657-1662) and Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726), played a significant role in shaping science fiction. Additionally, the concept of utopian societies, introduced by Sir Thomas More’s Utopia (Latin, 1516; translated into English in 1551), contributed to the development of science fiction.\n\nThe genre was influenced by the conte philosophique or philosophical tales of French writer and philosopher Voltaire (1694-1778). These were used as satirical devices to critique society’s follies and vices with thought experiments. Gothic literature, known for its emphasis on mystery and the supernatural, challenged the Enlightenment’s reliance on reason and knowledge. Furthermore, technological and social advancements during this period sparked greater anticipation and imagination about future developments. Cheaply produced dime novels, featuring inventors, lost races, and marvel stories like The Steam Man of the Prairies (1868) by Edward S. Ellis (1840-1916). Stories like this captured the public’s fascination with innovation and progress in what has come to be called an Edisonade, or mythologizing the success of Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931), the Wizard of Menlo Park. These diverse literary traditions collectively laid the foundation for the enthralling and ever-evolving genre of science fiction.\n\nIt’s also important to consider some of the historical and scientific advancements in the years after the publication of Frankenstein in 1818 in the 19th century. Some of the abolitionist goals set forth in the Enlightenment came to fruition with Britain’s Slavery Abolition Act in 1833 and the American Civil War from 1861-1865 and President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1962. Charles Darwin (1809-1882) published On the Origin of Species in 1859 making the case for evolution by natural selection. While inoculation with weakened or similar disease causing agents, such as cowpox was known to reduce smallpox mortality, Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) in France developed the first vaccine for rabies and created the process of pasteurization that keeps our foods, like milk, safe. James Clerk Maxwell (1821-1879) discovered the equations governing classical electromagnetism in 1861, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) gave us the Periodic Table in 1869, and Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered radioactivity in 1896. In astronomy, international cooperation began between observatories in the 19th century to create a photographic map of the night sky, Neptune was discovered in 1846, and in 1859, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) and Gustav Kirchhoff (1824-1887) used the earlier invention of spectroscope by Joseph von Fraunhofer (1787-1826) in 1814 to establish that spectral lines of observed in sunlight correspond to those produced by chemicals burned on Earth, the 1874 transit of Venus permitted an accurate calculation of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835-1910) first described what were believed to be canals on Mars in 1877. While the first steam locomotive began service in 1804, the first public rail line didn’t open until 1825 in England. Then, the internal combustion engine comes along in 1826, the electric motor in 1829, the telegraph in 1837, daguerreotype photographic process in 1839, Alexander Graham Bell’s (1847-1922) patent for the telephone in 1876, the phonograph in 1877, the lightbulb in 1879, and x-rays in 1895.\n\nWithin the changing and interconnected social, scientific, and technological realms, there are several notable proto-SF writers, including Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and E.M. Forster.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe\n\nEdgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is the originator of the horror story and the great detective story and innovator in psychological realism and poetic form. He influenced the French Symbolist movement. And, he melded science with mysticism. Among his stories, two that have distinctly SFnal, or science fictional elements are The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838), which is a fantastic adventure story involving shipwrecks and sailing to unknown lands, and “The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar” (1845), which explores what would happen if a person on the edge of death were mesmerized or what we would call hypnotized. In this latter story, Poe uses the rhetoric of science and the ideas of Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who created a therapeutic technique involving hypnosis.\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864), who you might know as the author of the 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter—about the adulteress Hester Prynne, also wrote proto-SF. There are many scientists and inventors in his other fiction. These include mesmerists and biologists. He depicts the creative and destructive skills of the sciences. His stories feature fantastic events that are given naturalistic explanations. You can think of his fiction as a response to the emergence of a technical-scientific elite during the nineteenth century. Two representative stories are “The Birth-Mark” (1843), which is about a beautiful woman with one blemish—a birthmark in the shape of a hand on her cheek that her husband obsesses over and creates a potion to remove it. While he’s successful at removing the birthmark, the potion kills the woman. Another is “Rappaccini’s Daughter” (1844) in which a poisonous maiden gains resistance to poisonous plants and becomes poisonous herself. She dies when the man she loves gives her an anecdote.\n\nJules Verne\n\nJules Verne (1828-1905) was a French writer and an especially important figure in proto SF. Verne was influenced by Poe, so much so that he even wrote a sequel to The Adventures of Arthur Gordon Pym. Verne’s writing is full of optimism about progress and European Man’s central role in nineteenth-century culture, which included Pro-expansionist and Orientalist ideas. He was born and raised in the port of Nantes, so it might not be surprising that the sea figures into many of his fictions. The overarching theme of his writing is called Voyages Extraordinaires or extraordinary voyages, which are near-future stories that take existing technologies just beyond what was then realizable. Verne takes the known and improves upon it for his stories. In his stories, readers learn something about science, technology, geography, and the natural world. But, his stories usually have a satirical edge to them. Three notable works of Verne include: Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), in which a group of adventurers navigate volcanic tubes through the Earth beginning in Iceland and re-emerge in Italy. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1869-1870) is about Captain Nemo and his electric submarine called the Nautilus. While submarines were known at this time, Verne takes the idea and improves on it. It’s worth noting that 20,000 leagues is a measure of distance, not depth in this context. Also, Nemo means no man or no body, and is the name that Odysseus from Homer’s Odyssey gives to the Cyclops. In the story, Nemo is a man outside society or community, like Victor Frankenstein. The character Professor Aronnax talks about science, but always does so incorrectly. On the other hand, Ned Land, the Canadian harpooner in the story uses common sense and reason to make educated guesses that prove correct over Aronnax’s lectures. Finally, Around the World in Eighty Days (1873) is about circumnavigating the globe aboard steamships and trains—wonders of contemporary transportation technologies of his time.\n\nH. G. Wells\n\nH. G. Wells (1866-1946) was a British writer who was one of the seminal figures in the development of SF. Born to working class parents, he won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science in London where he studied biology with T.H. Huxley (1825-1895), a scientific humanist and so-called “Darwin’s Bulldog.” This background and Wells’ voracious interests in science and technology led to him writing some of the most groundbreaking fiction about evolution, invention, the prophecy of change, social extrapolation, and the promise and peril of science and technology (his fiction celebrates and cautions about science and technology). Like Verne’s Voyages Extraordinaires, Wells earned a term for his kind of proto SF: Scientific Romances. Wells’ Scientific Romances share four main characteristics: i) long evolutionary perspective, ii) absence of a frontier, iii) faceless or nameless hero or one powerless in the face of natural forces, and iv) pessimistic or less hopeful about the future.\n\nSome of Wells’ notable works that introduce science fictional concepts that get picked up and developed further include: The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896) connects to the theme of scientific creation in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein through the character of Dr. Moreau who creates human-like creatures from animals; The Invisible Man: A Grotesque Romance (1897) is a story about hubris: a scientist devises a way to reduce his body’s refractive index to that of air and thus become invisible with a goal of gaining fame and fortune; The War of the Worlds (1898) is about the invasion of Earth by resource depleted and strange looking, tentacle-armed Martians driving their mighty tripod walking machines armed with heat rays and chemical weapons, but their lack of immunity to our bacteria kills them before they kill all of the humans; The First Men in the Moon (1901) is about two British men constructing a spherical spaceship out of a newly designed metal called “cavorite” that negates the force of gravity and flying in it to the moon where they experience weightlessness during the journey and encounter the insect-like Selenites on the moon; “The Land Ironclads” (1903) prophesied the construction and battlefield strategy of the modern tank; and “The Star” (1897), a short story that is widely anthologized about the passing of a rogue star through our solar system and the terrible ecological effects brought by this wayward star on our planet. Like Kepler’s Somnium (see first chapter above), we see at the end observations made about Earth from another point in the solar system—from Mars by the Martians. Wells alludes to the social benefits that come to humanity as a result of our weathering this catastrophe. Finally, the story takes a big perspective with no single hero to thread the story together. Its perspective is cosmic and on the level of the universe. It conjures the later so-called “Pale Blue Dot” photograph. This photograph of Earth was made by the spacecraft Voyager 1 from 6 billion kilometers away from Earth. This is the kind of perspective that Wells takes—not only in terms of Earth’s place in the universe but also in regard to aspiring to greatness by humanity’s collective effort.\n\nOne of Wells’ most famous novels is The Time Machine (1895), which introduces the idea of a machine capable of moving forward or backward in time, and it focuses on the idea of long, evolutionary time. Unlike Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol (1843) or Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s Court (1889), both of which magical time travel, Wells’ The Time Machine configures time as something traversable into the future or backward into the past via the application of science and technology. The former involves Scrooge’s dream, and the latter uses a massive punch to the side of Hank Morgan’s head to send him back in time. Wells’ novel is set apart because it does a couple of important things. First, it relies on the idea of time as a fourth dimension (where length, width, and height are the first three). Whereas we can move through space (three dimensions), he configures time as a fourth dimension we can move forward or backward along. Second, he devises his story around the Time Traveler’s invention of a time machine—a technological apparatus that one may use to travel forward or backward along the fourth dimension. Of course, these ideas got significantly updated in the Back to the Future film trilogy (1985, 1989, 1990) directed by Robert Zemeckis (1952-). In place of the time machine, scientist and inventor Emmett “Doc” Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd (1938-), and his friend Marty McFly, played my Michael J. Fox (1961-), discover the dangers of time travel in a DMC DeLorean automobile outfitted with a nuclear-powered flux capacitor and time circuits. Back to Wells’ novel, the Time Traveler goes forward into the future to the year 802,701 AD where he encounters the serene Eloi and the dangerous Morlocks. Considering Darwin’s theory of evolution, the Time Traveler deduces that the Eloi and Morlocks are divergent species from homo sapiens—one bred for slaughter and the other intelligent cannibals. This division reflects a societal division between an dilettante upper class (the Eloi) and the working lower classes (the Morlocks getting their revenge on their past oppressors). Following his escape from the Morlocks, he travels into the distant future and sees that life on Earth had “devolved” and further still to observe the sun grow and then diminish until the earth was left a barren and cold world before returning to his present time before setting out again into the streams of time, never to return.\n\nE. M. Forster\n\nE. M. Forster (1879-1970), a British writer and contemporary of H. G. Wells, wrote only one proto-SF story—“The Machine Stops” (1909). His other writing is what we would call realistic, being set in a world like his own. They are dramas about the human condition. In general, his writing includes strong themes of humanism and social connection, issues of class differences, sexuality, and symbolism or meanings in things or symbols. Some of his most important realistic fictions include Howards End (1910), which is about social conventions and fin de siècle interpersonal relationships; A Room with a View (1908), which is about the personal life of a young woman in Edwardian England; and A Passage to India (1924), which deals with social relations and racism in British colonized India. It presents a theme that becomes important for SF—the Other, or that which is distinct from, different from, or opposite to something or oneself. For example, E.M. Forster’s A Passage to India is about the meeting and unfortunate confrontation between the white British colonizers (self) and their Indian subjects (other).\n\nForster’s “The Machine Stops” (1909) focuses on the questioning Kuno and his blissfully ignorant mother Vashti. Kuno questions the hive-like, technologically mediated existence that they all live while Vashti is content and happy with her machine-mediated existence. While most people venerate and pseudo-worship the machine, some do not and are banished to live on their own on the surface of the Earth, which Kuno admits to his mother having seen once before being taken back into the hive by the Machine. As the story progresses, the machine begins to break down and with it the hive and the machine-mediated human civilization. Those living on the surface are humanity’s last best hope for survival after everyone below ground likely dies. Forster was incredibly prescient in this story—there are intelligent machines, self-repairing machines, air transportation networks, video conferencing, and information serving machines that are like computers with an Internet connection long before any of these technologies were possible, much less widely discussed. Also, Forster shows how we are shaped by our technology—becoming anti-social in person, being overweight, and otherwise unhealthy due to our technological isolation and social distancing thanks to communication technology mediation.\n\nForster points to Wells as the inspiration for this story, but it wasn’t because Forster thought Wells’ ideas were great. Instead, Forster thought that Wells’ insistence on evolution and not technology as being the driving force in historical development was misguided. Forster wrote “The Machine Stops” as a way to illustrate his point. Forster’s story reflects a deep skepticism of human dependence on technology, and what effect that technology will have on humanity’s development. Wells on the other hand generally argued that the effects of technology on social development could lead to better social arrangements for the good of all. Forster, however, sees technology as a threat to humanistic values, namely human agency, values, empiricism, and rationalism. Forster extrapolates the technology available at the turn of the century and imagines what they would be like in the far future and what effects they would have on people. Clearly, Foster’s vision of the future in the story is a nightmare. However, Wells took a generally even-handed approach by showing the promise and peril of humanity’s future in many of his works. For example, Wells’ The Time Machine is a warning against Whig interpretations of history, or an interpretation of history as progress moving toward a higher, more perfect state than what preceded it. In a sense, a Whig view of history is on-wards and up-wards. However, Wells and Forster are correct to point out that there is nothing guaranteeing the Whig view. Of course, there is that potential, but there is also the potential for dystopia, degeneration, devolution, and other negative outcomes for humanity.\n\nPulp SF\n\nAfter Mary Shelley published Frankenstein and other writers wrote stories in the 19th and early 20th century that explored the effects of science and technology on individuals and society, there was not yet a term that captured all of these narratives. That would change in the early 20th century with new, low cost publishing technologies combined with an increasing interest in science and technology.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nTo set the stage for the emergence of SF as a named genre, consider what was taking place historically in the early 20th century. First, modern science came into its own through phenomenal theoretical breakthroughs and experimental confirmations. On Dec. 17, 1903, the Wright Brothers achieved powered flight for the first time. In 1905, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) published what has come to be known as his Annus Mirabilis or miracle year papers in the scientific journal Annals of Physics—the first paper explained the photoelectric effect, which alone earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics, the second paper explained Brownian motion or the random motion of particles in a medium like air or water, the third introduces his special theory of relativity about the relationship of time and space, and the fourth explores mass and energy equivalence or E=mc2, which is a consequence of the special theory of relativity. Then, in 1915, Einstein published the general theory of relativity, which generalizes his special theory of relativity into a theory of gravitation that unifies time and space into four-dimensional spacetime. Quantum mechanics was established in the early 20th century with the quantum hypothesis in 1900 of E (photon energy) = h (Plank’s constant) times v (photon frequency) developed by Max Planck (1858-1947). The term for this new science was coined by a group of physicists at the University of Gottingen in the early 1920s, including Max Born (1882-1970), who worked on the statistical interpretation of the wave function, Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), who also gave us the uncertainty principle, and Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958), who gave us the exclusion principle. Erwin Schrodinger (1887-1961) further expanded quantum mechanics in mid-to-late-1920s with wave mechanics, the Schrodinger equation, and Schrodinger’s cat gedankenexperiment to make fun of the now widely taught Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and all of its weird implications.\n\nThere were innovations in the human-centered science of psychology. While Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) began developing his theory of psychoanalysis in the late 1880s and gave its name in 1896, he lays out his theory in The Interpretation of Dreams in 1899 which is followed by an abridged version On Dreams in 1901. He expanded on his theory of sexuality with Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in 1905.\n\nThere were new innovations in management and industrial production—notably the assembly line in 1901 and the moving assembly line to build the Ford Model T in 1913. Along with this was the beginnings of automobile culture in the US and around the world.\n\nModernism began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and it could be said to continue into the 21st century, but alongside other movements, such as postmodernism (see Cyberpunk chapter below). Modernism is a movement encompassing art, literature, music, architecture, and philosophy. At its core, according to the poet Ezra Pound (1885-1972), is the concept of “Make it new!” New art, new thinking, new social relationships, etc. It is a reaction to the past and a reckoning with the new scientific, industrial, and social changes taking place in the 20th century. In particular, it could be said to respond to the increasingly industrialized world and the place of the individual in that world—one in which the individual is reconfigured as a cog in the machine. In art, there is Cubism, Surrealism, Dada, and abstract art. An important example of Modernist painting is Pablo Picasso’s Guernica from 1937, which depicts the Nazi bombing of the Basque Country town of Guernica in Northern Spain during the Spanish Civil War, which lasted from 1935 to 1939. Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) and Le Corbusier (1887-1965) were creating innovative buildings, and there were the beginnings of skyscrapers in metropolitan cities. In literature, there is experimentation with new techniques including stream of consciousness. Some important works included Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time (1913-1927), Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis (1915), T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land” (1922), William Carlos Williams’ Spring and All (1922), James Joyce’s Ulysses (1922), e.e. cummings’ Tulips and Chimneys (1923), F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925), Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway (1925), John Dos Passos’ Manhattan Transfer (1925), William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury (1929), and Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms (1929).\n\nMotion pictures had their first public screenings in 1895. Silent films gained a following through the first two decades of the 20th century. Sound was introduced in the 1920s. Color was added in the 1930s.\n\nRadio or wireless broadcasting and receiving sound was invented and improved upon during the late 1800s, but it was developed by hobbyists, enthusiasts, and inventors in the early years of the 20th century. Radio development at that time can be seen as analogous to the personal computer hobbyist movement of the mid-to-late-1970s that led to the development of the Altair 8800, IMSAI 8080, and the Apple I. In fact, the radio hobbyist scene was instrumental to the beginnings of the Pulp SF publishing phenomenon as we will see shortly.\n\nThere were significant upheavals in the world due to wars and disease. The First World War, which lasted from July 28, 1914 to November 11, 1918. introduced new ways to kill and maim and its aftermath laid the groundwork for the mid-century Second World War. As soldiers returned home, they inadvertently spread a deadly strain of the flu. The Spanish flu pandemic killed tens of millions of people around the world between 1918 and 1919. People then innovated mask wearing as a way to prevent the spread of the virus. The Great Depression began with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929, known as Black Tuesday, and its effects lasted through the decade—business failures, massive unemployment, drops in production, drops in crop prices, and few social safety nets to help people. There was the Russian Revolution of 1917 to 1922, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Sun Yat-Sen (1866-1925) helped establish the Republic of China after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, which punctuated 5,000 years of monarchy in China.\n\nIt was out of these big scientific, technological, and social changes at the beginning of the 20th century that Science Fiction came into its own.\n\nOverview of Pulp SF\n\nThe Pulp Science Fiction (Pulp SF) period was roughly from the 1920s to the 1930s. The name comes from the type of magazines and how those magazines were made. Pulp magazines (SF and other genres) measured about 10 x 7 inches, and they were printed on cheap paper made from chemically treated wood pulp, which is a process invented in the 1880s. Pulp paper is rough, absorbent, acidic, and thick. Pulp paper ages poorly–yellowing and becoming brittle–due to the acidic content. Nevertheless, Pulp SF magazines feature brightly colored and in some cases provocative covers that attracted potential readers’ attention. Writers for the pulps were paid very cheaply by the word. This led to a certain kind of less than stellar writing style, because writers aimed to get paid as much as possible for the least time writing. Thus, stories were churned out as quickly as possible and the literary quality often suffered.\n\nPulp SF has eight characteristics: i) exciting stories full of action, romance, heroism, success, exotic settings, fantastic adventures, and usually a happy ending; ii) stylistically crude (but there are exceptions such as the writer Jack London, who you might know as the author of White Fang); iii) formulaic or following a certain pattern in many stories; iv) written for a less educated audience or put another way aimed to the lowest common denominator; v) little emphasis on character and drawing on stereotypes; vi) many recycled ideas; vii) BEMS or bug eyed monsters; and viii) specific SF themes include galactic empires, heroes, optimism and pessimism, sex, space opera, superman, sword and sorcery, and villains.\n\nThe major Pulp SF publications include Weird Tales, Amazing Stories, and Astounding Stories of Super-Science. Weird Tales, which was founded in 1923 by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger and published fiction by H. P. Lovecraft, C. L. Moore, and Robert E. Howard. The magazine hit its stride under the editorship of Farnsworth Wright beginning in Nov 1924. Weird Tales is known for publishing horror stories, sword and sorcery, exotic adventure, and anything else which its title might embrace. Then, Hugo Gernsback (discussed in the next section) inaugurated Amazing Stories in April 1926 as the first publication to exclusively publish what he called “scientifiction.” Amazing Stories was published in the so-called bedsheet size or approximately 9 x 12 inches. Gernsback reprinted Poe, Verne, and Wells, but he also sought out stories from new writers. In 1929, Gernsback’s publishing company was forced into bankruptcy and he lost control of Amazing Stories. Soon, he was back with new magazines: Air Wonder Stories, Science Wonder Stories, Science Wonder Quarterly, and Scientific Detective Monthly. Later, Gernsback even published an “educational” sex magazine called Sexology that had an extended run. In January 1930, publisher William Clayton began publishing a new magazine under the editorial direction of Harry Bates titled Astounding Stories of Super-Science. Its focus was more on action and adventure with science playing only a supporting role to the story. It is the longest running SF magazine having gone through various name changes–now being called Analog Science Fiction and Fact and edited by Trevor Quachri–celebrated its 90th anniversary at the Fourth Annual City Tech Science Fiction Symposium in Brooklyn, New York in 2019.\n\nHugo Gernsback\n\nHugo Gernsback (1884-1967) innovated the Pulp SF magazine and gave a name to the kind of literature that we know as Science Fiction. He was a Luxembourg-born writer and editor who immigrated to the United States in 1904 and wound up in New York City. Drawing on his interests in electricity and radio, he launched an electronics mail order company. As a way to attract customers and give them ideas about what electrical equipment and parts to purchase, he started Modern Electrics in 1908. It was a magazine that reported on new scientific and technological innovations, shared plans for building different electrical apparatuses such as magnetos or radios, and published stories that integrated science and technology into the plot.\n\nIt was in Modern Electrics that Gernsback serialized his first novel Ralph 124C 41+ across twelve issues from April 1911 to March 1912. Later, he revised and published Ralph 124C 41+ as a standalone novel in 1925. The title is the name of the story’s hero: Ralph 124C 41+. He is a lone inventor whose work gained him immense celebrity in the 27th century. He uses his inventions to accomplish daring feats always in the service of saving the girl he falls in love with. Gernsback, thinking that his ideas might inspire readers to buy his electronic gear and build their own inventions, meticulously describes how they work. Also, his focus is on prediction of the future—following one of his favorite writers—H.G. Wells (discussed in the Proto SF chapter above). Therefore, think about the hero’s name—Ralph one to foresee for one plus (meaning everyone).\n\nIn addition to Gernsback’s electrical equipment sales and associated magazine, he also began broadcasting over an AM radio station in New York City with call letters WRNY in 1925 as a means to promote his radio and science magazines. His station also played a role in some of the first experimental television transmissions in the 1920s. Gernsback had written about television technology in his magazines since the December 1909 issue of Modern Electrics. In 1928, Gernsback published plans for building television receivers in the magazines Science and Invention (formerly The Electrical Experimenter) and Radio News. But, only those most knowledgeable about radio and electronics could build these early television receivers that showed a picture about the size of a large postage stamp.\n\nWhat happened after he had founded his electrical parts business, numerous magazines, and a radio station is what Gernsback is most remembered for today: In April 1926, Gernsback published Amazing Stories, the world’s first science fiction magazine. In its first editorial, he coined a new word called “scientifiction.” He explains, “By ‘scientifiction’ I mean the Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision … Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading—they are always instructive. They supply knowledge . . . in a very palatable form … New adventures pictured for us in the scientifiction of today are not at all impossible of realization tomorrow … Many great science stories destined to be of historical interest are still to be written … Posterity will point to them as having blazed a new trail, not only in literature and fiction, but progress as well” (Gernsback, Hugo. “A New Sort of Magazine.” Amazing Stories, vol. 1, no. 1, April 1926, p. 3).\n\nThese are the three core components of Gernsback’s definition of scientifiction: i) 75% literature and 25% science; ii) didactic, which means it teaches; and iii) prophetic, which means that it foresees and predicts the future.\n\nGernsback also played an important role in the inauguration of science fiction fandom, or the community of science fiction readers and fans when he started the Science Fiction League in his magazine Wonder Stories in 1934. Fandom is the active readership and invested fans of SF. Unlike most other genres and cultural works, SF has a long history of fans coming together to meet in clubs or conventions, discuss their favorite and most despised stories, self-publish criticism and original stories (fanzines), and bestow awards. First recorded SF fan club meeting was the New York Scienceers on 11 December 1929. The first convention was in Leeds on 3 January 1937. The first World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) was held in New York in 1939. Worldcon is an annual event held in a different host city/country each year that continues to this day. Worldcon members are responsible for selecting the winners of the annual “Hugo Awards” named for Gernsback.\n\nE. E. “Doc” Smith\n\nE. E. “Doc” Smith (1890-1965) is considered the father of space opera—a subgenre of SF innovated in the pages of Gernsback’s Amazing Stories. In August 1928, Gernsback published E.E. “Doc” Smith’s The Skylark of Space and Philip Francis Nowlan’s Armageddon 2419 AD (the first Buck Rogers story) in the same Amazing Stories issue.\n\nLike SF being around before its term was coined, space opera existed for some time before a word was created to define it. In 1941, SF writer and fanzine publisher Wilson Tucker (1914-2006) suggested the term “space opera” to refer to “hacky, grinding, stinking, outworn, spaceship yarn.” Soap operas, radio dramas for women working from the home, did not come about as a term until radio was a widely dispersed technology. Space operas are stories that are high adventure set in interplanetary or interstellar conflict. C. L. Moore‘s “Shambleau” (discussed in the next section) could be considered a space opera. Another example would be George Lucas’ Star Wars (1977). Other important early space opera writers is “Thundering Worlds” (Weird Tales, March 1934) by Edmond Hamilton (1904-1977) in which planeteers strap rockets to their planets to find a new star to orbit after their star burns out.\n\nE.E. “Doc” Smith earned the “Doc” nickname for having a PhD. Though, his terminal degree was in chemical engineering and his profession was in food engineering—using science to improve foods, especially processed foods. At the time he was writing The Skylark of Space, he was working as chief chemist for a large mill in Michigan where he was working on doughnut mixes.\n\nThe first installment of The Skylark of Space appeared in the August 1928 issue of Amazing Stories with a byline including E. E. “Doc” Smith and Ms. Lee Hawkings Garby. When E. E. “Doc” Smith first began writing The Skylark of Space, Lee Hawkings Garby, the wife of one of his college friends, offered to help with writing the dialog and romantic scenes while Smith focused on the science and technology aspects of the story. Later, Smith revised The Skylark of Space and removed Garby’s byline. The original version of the novel by Smith and Hawkings Garby is a three-part serialization of the novel. This means that the whole novel was split into three parts—one part published in three subsequent issues. The first part appears in the August 1928 Amazing Stories, the second in September 1928, and the third in October 1928. To read the whole novel at that time, one would have to buy those three issues of the magazine.\n\nSmith’s The Skylark of Space began a series of four novels that continued with Skylark Three (serialized 1930, collected 1948), Skylark of Valeron (serialized 1934-1935, collected 1949), and Skylark DuQuesne (serialized 1965, collected 1966). It focuses on the scientist, inventor, and adventurer Richard Seaton and his rival Dr. Marc “Blackie” DuQuesne. The first novel begins with Seaton and his wealthy friend Reynolds Crane discovering how to unlock “intra-atomic energy” or what we would think of as atomic energy to create a new propulsion system for a spacecraft, new electrical energy production, and dangerously powerful weapons. DuQuesne wants Seaton’s invention for himself so that he can become rich, so he kidnaps Seaton’s girlfriend Dorothy Vaneman and her friend Margaret Spencer. Seaton and Crane pursue DuQuesne, overtake him, rescue the women, and extract a promise of cooperation from DuQuesne to help them return to Earth. They have adventures in outer space, collecting material for fuel on alien worlds–similar to one of the core game mechanics of Hello Games’ No Man’s Sky (2016), meeting a god-like intelligence–a theme explored later in the Star Trek franchise, and finding themselves caught in political intrigue between two rival alien races. Eventually, they make their way back home aboard a newly built Skylark Two made by their new alien allies.\n\nSmith’s space opera Lensman series (1934-1950) presents an expansive history of the universe from the formation of the Galactic Patrol to enforce intergalactic law and the first Lens, a technology that gives the Galactic Patrol’s leader telepathic abilities to aid in enforcement of the law. However, it presents eugenics as a means to create posthuman supermen. Eugenics is the selective breeding of human beings to produce certain desired traits, akin to the breeding of animals. Eugenics has a long history in racist ideologies.\n\nSmith’s The Skylark of Space also reflects racist attitudes and opinions circulating within culture in the early 20th century. For example, while DuQuesne’s nickname is “Blackie” due to his black hair, but this is also used as a racist epithet. Reference is made to the “old colored couple who were his servants.” “Colored people” is another term referring to people who are Black. Seaton says half of a terrible epithet, “a good Indian,” which implies the other half, “is a dead Indian.” And in reference to Crane’s assistant Shiro, the villains refer to him as “that Jap,” using the racist label for Japanese. Racism is unfortunately present in many Pulp SF stories.\n\nIt is certainly terrible and disturbing to encounter racism as well as other repugnant attitudes about sex, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, and other aspects of one’s identity in these stories. However, taking an objective, anthropological viewpoint can be beneficial for seeing these things as representing the culture from which the writer lives and operates. SF is always about the here-and-now in which it is written, because writers exist within their culture and time that serves as the point from which they extrapolate their SF stories. Considering their initial conditions and what we observe in their writing help us better understand the larger context of the stories and recognize that SF has more to tell us than its extrapolations. Additionally, a reader today can see how these discriminatory words and images rise, fall, change, and influence culture today.\n\nC. L. Moore\n\nC. L. Moore (1911-1987) gained fame as a pulp science fiction writer with her short story “Shambleau” in 1933. Moore’s “Shambleau” is a femme fatale story set on Mars featuring the character Northwest Smith and his ally Yarol, a Venusian. Moore is also recognized as the writer of the first sword and sorcery story with a female hero Jirel of Joiry. Another important story by Moore is “No Woman Born” (1944). It is about a dancer named Deirdre whose body is terribly burned in a fire. She is given a robotic body and becomes a cyborg. The story raises questions about how one’s embodiment changes consciousness and emotions. Deirdre is the same person, but she is also different in subtle, perhaps disturbing ways. Moore’s first collaboration with her future husband Henry Kuttner (1914-1958) was a crossover story featuring Jirel and Northwest Smith titled “Quest of the Starstone,” which was published in the November 1937 issue of Weird Tales. Moore was the stronger writer in the pair, but sexism led to Kuttner getting more of the praise. Moore wrote for television, too, but she stopped writing altogether in 1963 when she remarried.\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) is probably most well-known for Tarzan of the Apes (1912, All-Story Magazine) which is about a high-born, feral child raised amongst a community of apes in Africa who returns to civilization after falling in love with Jane, a woman he encounters in the wild; and the Barsoom or Martian stories (Barsoom being the name Martians give to the planet Mars), which includes A Princess of Mars (1912, All-Story Magazine) and follows the adventures of Earthman John Carter, the red Martian Princess Dejah Thoris, and the Green Martian Tars Tarkas. It should be noted that Burroughs’ Barsoom stories were inspired by the supposed discoveries of “canals” on Mars by the American astronomer Percival Lowell (1855-1916). After reading Camille Flammarion’s La planete Mars (1892) and its drawings of the allegedly seen canals of Mars by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835-1910), Lowell built an observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona for an extensive study of Mars. In three books, Lowell presented his own observations in a series of books from 1895-1908 of intricate canals on the surface of Mars, which he believed indicated the presence of intelligent life. Unfortunately, the canals didn’t exist—they were disproved by NASA’s Mariner missions in the 1960s and early 1970s. In the meantime, the idea of life on Mars captured the interest of many people including Burroughs, who used that idea as the inspiration for his Barsoom stories.\n\nUnlike many other successful SF writers—even in the pulp SF era, Burroughs wrote about things that he knew very little about. He wasn’t a wide reader, and he had no formal writing background. In fact, he was down on his luck and in his 30s when he decided to begin writing A Princess of Mars during the downtime at a failing business venture. Gore Vidal (1925-2012), an American writer and public intellectual, described Burroughs’ writing as “daydreaming” in a 1968 issue of Esquire magazine. Burroughs stories have poorly developed, but the action descriptions are exciting. The stories have many coincidences and unbelievable plot developments. They also feature many stereotypes and racist themes.\n\nNevertheless, it can’t be understated how much influence Edgar Rice Burroughs had on the next generation of SF writers including Ray Bradbury (1920-2012) and scientists including Carl Sagan (1934-1996). Bradbury says this of Burroughs in an interview shortly before his death: “Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out—and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly—Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world. By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special. That’s what we have to do for everyone, give the gift of life with our books. Say to a girl or boy at age ten, Hey, life is fun! Grow tall! I’ve talked to more biochemists and more astronomers and technologists in various fields, who, when they were ten years old, fell in love with John Carter and Tarzan and decided to become something romantic. Burroughs put us on the moon. All the technologists read Burroughs. I was once at Caltech with a whole bunch of scientists and they all admitted it. Two leading astronomers—one from Cornell, the other from Caltech—came out and said, Yeah, that’s why we became astronomers. We wanted to see Mars more closely. I find this in most fields. The need for romance is constant, and again, it’s pooh-poohed by intellectuals. As a result they’re going to stunt their kids. You can’t kill a dream. Social obligation has to come from living with some sense of style, high adventure, and romance” (qtd. in Weller, Sam. “Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203.” Paris Review, https://web.archive.org/web/20100923144726/http://www.theparisreview.org:80/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury).\n\nCarl Sagan writes about Burrough’s influence on his life in the 28 May 1978 issue of The New York Times, “I find that science fiction has led me to science,” and reflects when he was 10 years old that, “About this time a friend introduced me to the Mars novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. I had not thought much about Mars before, but here, presented before me in the adventures of John Carter, was another inhabited world, breathtakingly fleshed out: ancient sea bottoms, great canal pumping stations and a variety of beings, some of them exotic. There were, for example, the eight‐legged beasts of burden, the thoats. These novels were exhilarating to read. At first. But slowly, doubts began to gnaw. . . . I decided that Burroughs might not have known what he was talking about, but he certainly made his readers think. And in those many chapters where there was not much to think about, there were satisfyingly malignant enemies and rousing swordsmanship—more than enough to maintain the interest of a city‐bound 10‐year‐old in a long Brooklyn summer” (Sagan, Carl. “Growing Up With Science Fiction.” The New York Times, 28 May 1978, pp. 24-31, https://nyti.ms/3OwMfrD).\n\nH. P. Lovecraft\n\nH. P. Lovecraft (1890-1937) spent most of his life in Providence, RI but he did live for a time in New York. In addition to writing fiction, he was a prolific writer of letters. Lovecraft contributed to Weird Tales and influenced the weird fiction subgenre. Most of his fiction is known as weird fiction, which has these four characteristics: i) Broad term that describes fantasy, supernatural fiction, and horror tales that embody transgressive material; ii) Motifs of Thinning (diminishment or reduction of the protagonist, health of the land, or loss of the land) and the Uncanny (the strange and unusual); iii) Occultism and Satanism; iv) Doppelgangers, or uncanny doubling of characters. Lovecraft supplies his own definition for weird fiction in the essay, “Supernatural Horror in Literature” in The Recluse in 1927: “The true weird tale has something more than secret murder, bloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule. A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of that most terrible conception of the human brain—a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space” (Lovecraft, H. P., “Supernatural Horror in Literature.” The H. P. Lovecraft Archive, http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/shil.aspx, par. 6). In addition to weird fiction, Lovecraft is known as a horror writer, but with his Cthulhu Mythos stories, he attempted to develop a unique blend of SF and horror known as “cosmic horror.” Cosmic horror has these five characteristics: i) Other Dimensions; ii) Invasion by aliens; iii) Interference with human cultural and physiological evolution; iv) The Universe is essentially horrible and hostile to humanity; and v) Writing shifts between clinical to dense, adjective filled descriptions.\n\nSF Film Serials of the 1930s and 1940s\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, pulp science fiction made its mark on the film industry, which was already well-established by that time. This transition from page to screen is discussed in more detail in the “SF Film Through the 1950s” section later in this book.\n\nA “medium,” as it relates to human communication, refers to the technology used to convey a message or tell a story. Some common media include print (magazines and books), film, recorded audio, and video games. Each of these media has its own unique set of strengths and limitations.\n\nMagazines, for instance, allow for linear storytelling, printed text, and vibrant cover art. However, they are limited by their lack of interactivity, absence of motion and sound, and reliance on literate readers. Similarly, video games offer a highly immersive, non-linear experience with advanced graphics and sound effects. On the other hand, they can be hampered by hardware compatibility issues, performance considerations, and the need for skilled players to progress through the game.\n\nEach medium has its own unique advantages/affordances and disadvantages/constraints, and understanding these differences is essential for effectively communicating ideas and telling stories effectively in a given medium.\n\nSF stories have been told through various media over the years, each taking advantage of their unique characteristics to tell engaging tales. One such medium is serialized films, which combine the regular installments of SF magazines with the dynamic visuals and sounds of cinema.\n\nEach week, audiences would eagerly anticipate the latest installment of a serialized science fiction film. These short movies would often begin with a quick recap of the previous episode, followed by a self-contained adventure that ends on a cliffhanger – leaving viewers excited for the next chapter. The episodes were designed to be experienced in sequence, building upon one another to create a larger narrative.\n\nThe earliest serials emerged during the silent film era in the 1910s and 1920s. As technology advanced, these films transitioned into the talkies of the 1930s and 1940s, allowing for even greater storytelling possibilities. However, with the rise of television in the 1950s, serials fell out of favor as episodic TV shows became the preferred means of delivering sequential entertainment.\n\nThe key features of science fiction movie serials can be summarized as follows: i) Regular installments released every week prior to the main feature; ii) Modest production costs that allow for frequent releases; iii) Basic production values that often repurpose special effects and sets from previous films; and iv) Cliffhanger endings engineered to entice audiences back for the next episode. Television has adopted this formula to create long-running shows with engrossing narratives that keep viewers coming back for more.\n\nSF is a promiscuous genre when it comes to claims of origination or translation. Its stories are told and retold across a variety of media. It’s impossible to say that one medium is superior to another, because no one medium can accommodate every possible affordance and overcome every possible constraint.\n\nTwo important SF film serials in the early 20th century are Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon.\n\nBuck Rogers\n\nBuck Rogers first appears in “Armageddon 2149 AD” by SF writer Philip Francis Nowlan (1888-1940) in the August 1928 issue of Amazing Stories, the same issue in which E.E. “Doc” Smith’s The Skylark of Space begins. The Buck Rogers comic strip appeared the following year in 1929. Buck Rogers is a space opera, or a science fiction story about interplanetary conflict. The story begins when Buck Rogers, a war veteran and pilot, falls into suspended animation for nearly 500 years and finds himself in the future where North America is ruled, with racist overtones, by the Han, the main ethnic group of China. He saves Wilma Deering, who becomes his girlfriend. He joins forces with the resistance against the Han. The comic strip has a slightly more developed story with additional characters including the villain Killer Kane. It has a moderately adult and sophisticated storyline but crude dialog and artwork. Buck Rogers has had many media translations or adaptations, including original short story, comic strip, radio (it was actually the first SF radio program), serial films, and two television series.\n\nFlash Gordon\n\nPeople in the publishing industry took notice of the popularity and success of Buck Rogers. American illustrator Alex Raymond (1909-1956) created the Flash Gordon comic strip for King Features Syndicate in 1934 to compete with the long established Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Flash Gordon has a plot that shares similarities with Buck Rogers, but it also goes into new directions. It begins with meteors striking the Earth and mad scientist Dr. Zarkov works to uncover their origin. Zarkov kidnaps Flash Gordon, polo player and Yale graduate, and Dale Arden, Flash’s fiancée, and takes them on his rocketship back to the origin of the meteors: the planet Mongo, which is ruled by Ming the Merciless whose name and appearance mirrors the Yellow Peril racism of Buck Rogers. Like Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon is a space opera, too. Unlike Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon features well drawn and exotic stories. Flash Gordon includes an interesting tension between the Future (rocketships and death rays) and the Past (dinosaurs, jungles, swords). Flash Gordon’s media translations include comic strip, novelizations, serial films, live action TV show, animated TV show, and film.\n\nFlash Gordon film serial adaptations include three series. Flash Gordon: Space Soldiers comprises 13 2-reel episodes (each reel contained about 10 minutes of playback). It was released in 1936 by Universal Pictures. Flash Gordon’s Trip to Mars was released in 1938 as 15 episodes. Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe was released in 1940 in 12 episodes. The cast features Buster Crabbe (1908-1983), an Olympic swimmer who the 1932 Olympic gold medal for the 400m freestyle competition, as Flash; Charles Middleton (1874-1949) as Ming the Merciless; Jean Rogers (1916-1991) as Dale; Priscilla Lawson (1914-1958) as Princess Aura; and Frank Shannon (1874-1959) as Dr. Zarkov. It’s worth noting that the Buck Rogers SF film serial was released in 1939 by Universal, and Buster Crabbe also portrays Buck Rogers!\n\nGolden Age SF\n\nThe Pulp SF era was framed by these major historical events: the First World War from July 28, 1914 to Nov. 11, 1918, the stock market crash of Oct. 29, 1929, and the ensuing Great Depression that lasted through the following decade. It is out of the tail end of the Great Depression and the beginnings of Wo"
