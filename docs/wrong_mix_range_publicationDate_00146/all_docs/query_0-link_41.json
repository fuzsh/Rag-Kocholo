Stretching from the Classical to the Contemporary, the ﬁrst section of the book, ‘Origins’, considers the importance of particular areas of philosophy, theory, and criticism that have been important for conceptualizing affect and its relation to literature, including ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, eighteenth century aesthetics, Marxist theory, psychoanalysis, queer theory, and postcolonial theory. The chapters of the second section, ‘Developments’, correspond to those of the previous section and build on their insights through readings of particular texts. The ﬁnal ‘Applications’ section is focused on con temporary and future lines of enquiry and revolves around a particular set of concerns: media and communications, capitalism, and an environment of affective relations that extend to ecology, social crisis, and war. alex houen is author of Terrorism and Modern Literature (2002), and Powers of Possibility: Experimental American Writing since the 1960s (2012). His edited publications include: a special issue on ‘Affects, Text, and Performativity’ of Textual Practice 25:2 (March/April 2011); and (with Jan Melissa Schramm), Sacriﬁce and Modern War Literature: Battle of Waterloo to the War on Terror (2018). He also co edits the international journal of poetry, Blackbox Manifold.\n\ncambridge critical concepts Cambridge Critical Concepts focuses on the important ideas animating twentieth and twenty ﬁrst century literary studies. Each concept addressed in the series has had a profound impact on literary studies, as well as on other disciplines, and already has a substantial critical bibliography surrounding it. This series captures the dynamic critical energies transmitted across twentieth and twenty ﬁrst century literary landscapes: the concepts critics bring to reading, interpretation and criticism. By addressing the origins, development and application of these ideas, the books collate and clarify how these particular concepts have developed, while also featuring fresh insights and establishing new lines of enquiry. Cambridge Critical Concepts shifts the focus from period or genre based literary studies of key terms to the history and development of the terms themselves. Broad and detailed contributions cumulatively identify and investigate the various historical and cultural catalysts that made these critical concepts emerge as established twenty ﬁrst century landmarks in the discipline. The level will be suitable for advanced undergraduates, graduates and specialists, as well as for those teaching outside their own research areas, and will have cross disciplinary relevance for subjects such as history and philosophy.

Scene: I’m lying on the bed, face down on the pillow. Outside in the guttering some house-sparrow chicks are cheeping incessantly for food, they’re like feathered car alarms. I’m exhausted – bodily and mentally. Partly from having been immersed all afternoon in the dense, translated prose of Spinoza’s Ethics. Partly from having had to clear up the effects of a plumbing emergency in my house yesterday. Partly from doing extra childcare (it’s school holiday time). Plus I’ve been trying without success not to think of the imminent anniversary of a friend’s death. A sudden pang of grief dies away with the thought of it. I concentrate on the pulse in my ear; it’s slowing. The sparrows are very insistent. Little prickles of anxiety. I should do more work. I must go on. I can’t go on – not when I feel so lacking in energy. Long pause. I ﬁnd myself imagining my ﬁve-year-old daughter sneaking out into the street to look for our cat. She’s been out there for a while and I hear a scream. I picture myself looking out of the window and see her being pulled into a car by a man. Dashing out of the house I run after the car I’ve imagined such a chase before am exploding into myself the car trying to speed up our narrow street hits a van jutting out and goes into a bit of a spin. One man in the back gets out and runs off – that’s my daughter under a blanket? – I’m ripping open the front door I pull the driver out smash him down onto the road my rage fuelling rage, but no what about my daughter and what am I doing? I can’t bear to see her looking traumatised. Pulse racing against the pillow, I focus on my breathing until I’m ﬂoating on the bed in a kind of manageable suspended rage, a soft rage accompanied by sparrow song. Must get back to work.\n\n***\n\nThe written ‘scene’ above is just one example presenting how a person can be affected by various things in various ways, but it raises a host of general 1\n\n2\n\nalex houen\n\nissues and questions with which this book is concerned. What is the relation of mind and body in terms of how one feels emotionally affected? At points above it seems that sensation triggers affect, as when sparrow song elicits irritation. At other points it seems that a thought causes affect, as when remembering the anniversary prompts a ‘pang’ of ‘grief’. If that pang suggests a sharp awareness – one that is both mental and bodily – of an affect’s presence in experience, it’s also true that the lived present in the scene is repeatedly coloured confusingly by things that have already happened (the plumbing emergency, etc.), and things that are going to happen (the anniversary), as well as things imagined as happening (the kidnapping). That raises an important question in terms of this book’s literary focus: if affective experience can be so temporally and spatially manifold in being coloured by multiple things simultaneously, then is affect compatible with sequenced orderings of narrative prose, or even with the linguistic expressions of innovative poetry? For if affect extends to bodily sensation, then can it be conveyed adequately through language? When writing the scene above I began to feel that the sentences referring to various forms of affect would build thematically – resonate together – over the reading experience to engender a tonal atmosphere. I also tried to get style to do some affective labour: for example, the longer ﬂowing sentences with less punctuation registering the rush of rage; also the paragraph break mid-sentence for the sudden change of heart. At other times, I let forthright assertion do pathos: ‘I must go on. I can’t go on’. The latter is actually a loose quotation that came to mind from Samuel Beckett’s novel The Unnamable (1953), though, and Beckett on occasion also uses mid-sentence paragraph breaks.1 That raises the question of how literary expressions of affect relate to those of ‘real life’. Is our affective life ever separate from our imaginary life? My scene above did actually happen to the extent that I lay on my bed and pictured my daughter being kidnapped, and while that kidnapping only happened in my imagination it did precipitate a form of rage. I felt that rage in my body as well, but it also felt somewhat up in the air precisely because the kidnapping remained imaginary – which is why I’ve described the affect as ‘a kind of manageable suspended rage, a soft rage’. If affects can include real and imaginary experience at the same time, is literary writing particularly well suited to exploring their dynamics?\n\n***\n\nTo help us think more about matters and questions such as those I’ve just raised there is no shortage of ‘affect theory’ which, over the last two decades, has gained interest across numerous disciplines – including anthropology,\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\npsychology, philosophy, sociology, politics, cultural studies, and literary studies. ‘Is there any remaining doubt that we are now fully within the Episteme of the Affect?’,2 asks Eugenie Brinkema rhetorically. Well, certainly affect has increasingly become a principal subject of investigation not just in academia but also in the wider world, partly because it’s seen by many to be a basis of knowledge. (At the time of writing, for example, I’ve seen multiple journalism articles in just the past few days arguing that today’s ‘post-truth’ politics and ‘fake news’ are appealing primarily to people’s affective sensibilities.3) Within academia, two publications in 1995 are regarded as having been particularly inﬂuential in fostering an ‘affective turn’: Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Adam Frank’s ‘Shame in the Cybernetic Fold’, and Brian Massumi’s ‘The Autonomy of Affect’. The two texts are not singing from the same score: Sedgwick and Frank’s explores the importance of the psychologist Silvan Tomkins’s work on affect, whereas Massumi’s is mostly drawing on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s reading of Spinoza’s Ethics. Despite their different sources of inspiration, these two texts have both been viewed by some theorists as advancing a concept of affect as a form of bodily feeling that is distinct from emotion, cognition, and language. It’s easy to deduce such a view from Massumi’s text, given statements in it such as the following: affect (which he also calls ‘intensity’) ‘is embodied in purely autonomic reactions most directly manifested in the skin – at the surface of the body, at its interface with things’; it is ‘outside expectation and adaptation, [. . .] disconnected from meaningful sequencing, from narration’; ‘It is crucial to theorize the difference between affect and emotion’; ‘Language [. . .] is not simply in opposition to intensity. It would seem to function differentially in relation to it’; ‘Emotion is qualiﬁed intensity, the conventional [. . .] point of insertion of intensity into semantically and semiotically formed progressions, [. . .] into function and meaning’.4 As I’ll show shortly, it’s harder to draw a similar conception of affect as fundamentally distinct from cognition, emotion, and language in the writings of Tomkins or Sedgwick and Frank. Ruth Leys is not alone in thinking otherwise, though: she aligns Tomkins and his followers with Massumi in arguing that they similarly characterise affect as ‘nonintentional, bodily reactions’; ‘noncognitive, corporeal processes or states’.5 Leys is right to argue that such a characterisation has become a principal way of conceiving affect in affect theory. It’s evident, for example, in Patricia Ticinetto Clough and Jean Halley’s inﬂuential collection of essays The Affective Turn: Theorizing the Social (2007) – Clough states in her ‘Introduction’ that the volume’s interdisciplinary explorations are particularly inﬂuenced by the work of Deleuze and Guattari, Massumi, and\n\n4\n\nalex houen\n\nSpinoza.6 Another inﬂuential collection of essays, Melissa Gregg and Gregory J. Seigworth’s The Affect Theory Reader (2010), similarly has an Introduction that frames the essays by setting up the importance of Tomkins, Sedgwick, Deleuze and Guattari, Massumi, and Spinoza for affect theory.7 Most of the contributors to these two volumes work outside literary studies in the social sciences or humanities. But their characterisation of affect has also been advanced by literary theorists such as Fredric Jameson. Prior to the affective turn, Jameson in his Postmodernism (1991) declared that the surfeit of simulated and mediated experience in contemporary culture had compromised any sense of authentic subjectivity and emotion to such an extent that we face a wholesale ‘waning of affect’ – ‘there is no longer a self present to do the feeling’.8 More recently, in The Antinomies of Realism (2013), though, he has done a volte face by arguing that affect thrives as a vital, bodily phenomenon that is irreducible to literary representation. Like Massumi, Jameson argues that there is a ‘structural difference’ between emotion and affect: whereas emotion arises as cognitive, ‘named’ structures of feeling that entail ‘the intervention of language’, affects are ‘bodily feelings’ that are resistant to language.9 Accordingly, Jameson is keen to insist ‘on the new representational tasks [affect] poses poets and novelists in the effort somehow to seize its ﬂeeting essence and to force its recognition’.10 This approach to affect as distinct from emotion, cognition, and language is not the only one to have grown prevalent in affect theory. As Leys points out, in addition to the ‘noncognitivist’ approach there is the ‘opposing’ side of ‘cognitivists’, which includes psychologists such as Richard Lazarus and philosophers such as Martha Nussbaum and Anthony Kenny.11 It’s not surprising that numerous philosophers and literary theorists have been keen to develop a cognitivist approach to affect in literature, given their common investment in exploring the richness of mental life – including memory, consciousness, and imagination – as well as its relation to language and representation. Cognitivists tend to uphold a concept of affect as emerging through distinct cognitive ‘attitudes’; subjective outlooks, that develop like narratives.12 For that reason, cognitivist approaches to literature have tended to focus on prose ﬁction as a means of reﬂecting on emotion in terms of character and personality. When considering that emotional content of literature, cognitivists have also argued that it can elicit sympathy or empathy in readers and so foster good ethical capacities. This kind of approach is prominent in Donald Wehrs and Thomas Blake’s The Palgrave Handbook of Affect Studies and Textual Criticism (2017), which raises some important questions about the\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nlimitations of regarding affect as essentially corporeal.13 Yet cognitive approaches have their own limitations. Their focus on mental attitudes often subordinates the question of what role bodily sensation plays in affective life. Moreover, in viewing narrative or language as ‘expressions’ of subjective feeling, cognitive approaches have often emphasised emotional content over literary form and so ignored questions of what role and aesthetic impact form, genre, or style might have in presenting emotion in a distinctly literary way. For the rest of this Introduction I want to build the case for an approach to affects in theory and in literature that is neither strictly cognitivist nor noncognitivist, and that is open to considering literary affect in terms of fusions of content and form. I’ll do this ﬁrst by showing that Spinoza and Deleuze, then Tomkins, Sedgwick and Frank, do not in fact support an opposition of bodily affect versus emotion and cognition. I’ll then consider the work of other literary theorists that lends support to an approach that is reducible neither to cognitivism nor noncognitivism. After offering my own examples of what such an approach looks like in practice, I’ll conclude by outlining how the three sections of this book build distinctly literary perspectives on affect.\n\nII. One of the most important features of Spinoza’s philosophy is its monism: there is no dualism or split between mind and body, he asserts, for they are two ‘attributes’ of the same ‘substance’ and are always correlated with each other.14 That is evident in what Spinoza calls the ‘affections’ (affectio) which arise whenever you are affected by something: ‘The [affections] of the human body whose ideas represent external bodies as present to us, we shall call the images of things [. . .]. When the mind regards bodies in this way, we shall say that it imagines’.15 When Massumi discusses Spinoza’s affections in ‘The Autonomy of Affect’ he stresses that they form bodily ‘traces’ and suggests that ideas of them are generated through secondary ‘conscious reﬂection’ that amounts to a process of ‘abstraction’.16 Deleuze, however, offers a different interpretation and asserts that the bodily ‘image’ of an affection is inherently a form of ‘idea’.17 As he points out, Spinoza also states that the affections form another kind of affect (affectus) that is a felt idea of how one’s affective state itself has shifted: ‘The affectio refers to a state of the affected body and implies the presence of the affecting body, whereas the affectus refers to the passage from one state to another’.18 In general, then, Spinoza does not assert that ideas tied to affections and\n\n6\n\nalex houen\n\naffects arise as secondary cognitive ‘abstractions’; instead, as Deleuze puts it, ‘Our feelings are in themselves ideas’.19 Seeing Tomkins as dissociating affects from cognition is similarly questionable. While Sedgwick and Frank argued that Tomkins saw cognition and affects as systems that ‘involve many kinds of interdependent transformations’,20 Leys argues that he ‘remained committed to the idea of their autonomy as separate subsystems’ and that he keeps them ‘inherently independent of each other’.21 It’s true that Tomkins proposes a system of nine distinct and innate affective ranges: distress-anguish; interest-excitement; enjoyment-joy; surprise-startle; anger-rage; fearterror; shame-humiliation; disgust (the impulse to expel something noxious); and dissmell (the impulse to pull away from something noxious).22 It’s also true that he posits a ‘freedom’ of each affect to ‘combine’ and ‘coassemble’ with objects as well as various mental and bodily ‘components’ of the human organism – including other affects, memory, sensation, perception, and action. Contrary to Leys’s assertion, though, Tomkins by the end of his four-volume magnum opus, Affect, Imagery, Consciousness (1962–91) does not maintain that the cognitive and affective are ‘inherently independent’ systems; instead, he states that the two are conjoined through ‘a set of relations of partial independence, partial dependence, and partial interdependence that vary in their interrelationships, conditional upon the speciﬁc state of the whole subsystem at any one moment’.23 In other words, the dynamic conjunction of affects and cognition is ﬂuid, contingent upon the ‘state’ one happens to be in – which is comparable to Spinoza’s conception of affect (affectus) as a felt idea of ‘the passage from one [affective] state to another’. Tomkins might at times theorise affect and cognition as two separate systems, but he does so largely for heuristic reasons; the reality of the situation, as he states, is that ‘The coassembly and fusion of both motivational [affective] and cognitive mechanisms is the rule, not the exception’.24 As in Spinoza’s theory, affects and cognition need to be seen as thoroughly fused with each other. Such fusion develops, for example, through the ‘affect theories’ and ‘affect scripts’ that Tomkins says are developed by people individually. As Sedgwick and Frank explain, according to Tomkins the ‘theory’ a person builds for a particular affect is built up empirically over the course of multiple experiences of it. The theory is thus ‘cognitive and affective’ in nature, and also involves strategies for dealing with the affect – for example, by amplifying it, diminishing it, or combining it with other affects.25 Similarly, Tomkins’s ‘script theory’ is based on affective ‘scenes’, and the scripts – which are continually ﬂexible and revised – are generated by what\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nTomkins comes to call the ‘minding’ system, which is ‘composed of cognitive and affective subsystems’26: Scripts are generated by the minding system as rules for that system, including rules for both cognitive and affective ordering as subsets, analo gous to the way in which an interpretation of a text presupposes and includes rules of grammar, semantics, pragmatics, and more.27\n\nUltimately, then, the case for seeing Tomkins as upholding a ‘noncognitivist’ account of affect is as tenuous as the one that ascribes such an account to Spinoza and Deleuze. Contrary to Jameson’s and Massumi’s positions, Tomkins’s does not call for strict differentiation between emotion and affect, and far from seeing affective life as being ‘in opposition’ to language, Tomkins suggests that the ‘scripts’ people form with and for affects are akin to the work of textual criticism. I. A. Richards in Practical Criticism (1929) commented that while critical practice had become rich in methods of interpreting meaning, it was poor at dealing with feeling: ‘For handling feeling we have nothing at all comparable. We have to rely upon introspection, a few clumsy descriptive names for emotions, some scores of aesthetic adjectives [. . .]’.28 That imbalance has increasingly been redressed, particularly since the ‘affective turn’, with critics and theorists not only developing fresh insights into how affect can be interpreted through language, but also new understandings of how language itself is affective. Denise Riley, for example, has recently been inﬂuential in exploring how language ‘does not express feeling’ so much as it ‘does feeling’.29 While language is ‘impersonal’ in being indifferent to those who use it, she argues, its architecture is at the heart of the affects we form. Punctuation, vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and ideological discourse can all be informative and formative for a person’s affective life. Punctuation can do affect by exclamation marks, for example, just as a statement can be modiﬁed affectively by tone or volume of voice. Vocabulary alone affords a variety of tones: when relating the fact of a person’s death, for example, I can say he ‘died’, or ‘passed away’, or ‘kicked the bucket’, each of these carrying a different affective charge, the force of which will also depend on my tone of voice no less than the affective state of the person hearing it. In using any of those words for death I could also retain quotation marks around them (if speaking, I can signal that with ﬁnger movements) in order to ironise the meaning, affective charge, and my identiﬁcation with them. For Riley, as well as Judith Butler, we each come into being as a social individual largely by identifying oneself through the terms and structures of language.30 We are interpellated into society through language, by taking up a position in it, and\n\n8\n\nalex houen\n\nit’s because the terms of language are consequently very much at the core of one’s selfhood that hate speech, for example, can be so affecting and injurious.31 As Riley argues, the self identiﬁcations we make with language can engender an array of affects. In stating, for example, that ‘I am an Australian, a father, and a lover not a ﬁghter’, I might feel pride and solidarity with others who identify with any of those terms – though if I were to let my daughter be kidnapped under my watch and then let her see me pummelling her kidnapper in rage I’d be more likely to have what Riley calls ‘linguistic shame’ in feeling that I do not live up to the terms. The affective dynamics of linguistic identiﬁcation should not be seen as involving just nounal categories but also other grammatical modes as well as syntax. In saying ‘I love you’, for example, the very act of identifying my feeling with that statement can augment the feeling itself while formalising its existence for me and my beloved. In other words, the statement isn’t simply expressive but also performative in so far as the feeling emerges through its verbal formalisation.32 As with any statement, though, one can have varying affective identiﬁcations with ‘I love you’. It might make me feel happy in thinking that my love resonates with other love scenes that I have taken to heart from literature and ﬁlms and life. I can even take the statement’s syntax gladly to heart and feel that, yes, I as subject am doing the emotion and am giving it to my beloved. Alternatively, I might think that the statement is a cliché and that its syntax doesn’t ﬁt with feeling how I am subject to a love that has arisen not solely in me but between me and my beloved – in which case I’m better off declaring ‘Love You-It-I makes me’. Taken together, the points I’ve made in relation to Tomkins and Riley support the case for arguing that affective experience can lead to modiﬁcations of how we theorise, script, and interpret it, just as those theories and scriptings play a part in informing and forming affects. This doesn’t mean that affects are reducible to the affective ‘architecture’ of language; as the ‘I love you’ example shows, we need to think of affect, language, and cognition as thoroughly conjoined yet open to various modes of interaction, coassembly, and fusion. When Riley asserts that ‘sensibility is words’ it sounds as though she’s maintaining that affect is purely linguistic, but she emphatically states that she is not suggesting that it ‘is “really only” words’.33 Conjoining ‘words’ and ‘sensibility’ means seeing language, affect, and cognition as being interrelated, yet open to the different kinds of affective identiﬁcation and linguistic negotiation that I’ve described.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nThat ﬂuidity of interaction leaves the intimacy of language and affects open to context and historical change. ‘Sensibility’ itself has shifted over the centuries. As Raymond Williams has noted, in the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth centuries the word meant ‘physical feeling or sense perception’, in the eighteenth century its meaning was ‘much like that of modern awareness (not only consciousness but conscience)’, and in the twentieth century it was seen more as ‘a whole way of perceiving and responding, not to be reduced to either “thought” or “feeling”’.34 The very word ‘sensibility’ has thus reﬂected and informed attitudes to how cognition and affect relate. That’s also true of ‘affect’. The Latin of Spinoza’s Ethics means that his use of affectus and affectio harks back to classical Roman senses of those words. Yet, as Philip Fisher has pointed out, Spinoza – like other thinkers such as Aquinas, Descartes, Hobbes, and Kant – modiﬁed the senses of the Latin terms to give them different values and meanings.35 It’s notable that the Latin affectus was also frequently translated as ‘passion’ or ‘emotion’, writes Teresa Brennan, who argues that the current concept of ‘affect’ as fundamentally bodily stems largely from Charles Darwin’s physiological account of emotions, along with William James’s psychological writings.36 Lineages of aesthetic theory and literary criticism show how particular forms of feeling have been developed in relation to speciﬁc modes of language and literature. Take the sublime, for example. In Longinus’s On the Sublime (written around the ﬁrst century CE), he associates sublimity with a ‘grand style’ of ‘elevated language’, the effect of which ‘is not to persuade the hearers, but to entrance them’ with ‘wonder’ such that ‘sublime passages exert an irresistible force and mastery’ over them.37 For Longinus, the affective force of this sublimity is rooted in combining ‘grand conceptions’ and ‘powerful and inspired emotion’ as well as ‘ﬁgures of thought and speech’, ‘noble diction’, and rhetorical style.38 (In discussing how language ‘does’ feeling, Riley also considers rhetoric and cites Demetrius, for example, explaining how asyndeton can make speech dramatic.39) The grand style is thus conceived as eliciting a particular form of feeling – wonder – through speciﬁc forms of language and literature that combine powerful conception and emotion. In Edmund Burke’s eighteenth-century writings, though, the sublime entails a different form of feeling: not wonder so much as terror and even physical pain. Some of Burke’s thinking about the importance of terror relates to his views on politics of the time, but he also relates it to the power of language. Words, he argues, ‘are able to affect us often as strongly as the things they represent, and sometimes much more strongly’.40 Unlike Longinus, he suggests that language itself even harbours the potential for surpassing our\n\n10\n\nalex houen\n\nconceptions, as when he considers the phrase ‘universe of Death’ from Milton’s Paradise Lost: Here [. . .] are two ideas not presentable but by language; and an union of them great and amazing beyond conception; if they may properly be called ideas which present no distinct image to the mind [. . .]’.41\n\nFor Burke, then, the ﬁgurative language of Milton’s poem effectively amounts to a novel form of aesthetically affecting idea that is ‘amazing’ by virtue of exceeding conventional ideas. Burke also intimates that mediating effects – such as arise through the artiﬁce of mimesis and ﬁgurative language – can elicit an aesthetic form of affect: if the pain and terror are so modiﬁed as not to be actually noxious; if the pain is not carried to violence, and the terror is not so conversant about the present destruction of the person [. . .] they are capable of producing delight; not pleasure, but a sort of delightful horror, a sort of tranquility tinged with terror [. . .].42\n\nWhereas Longinus portrays the grand style as expressing and performing powerful conceptions and emotions that the writer or speaker has already had, Burke suggests that language and literature can generate affect with an aesthetic twist. The indeterminacy of the ‘delightful horror’ and ‘tranquility tinged with terror’ that Burke emphasises with his ‘sort of [. . .] sort of’ brings me back to the ‘kind of manageable suspended rage’ that I began with, and the question it led me to: if affects can include real and imaginary experience simultaneously, is literary writing particularly well suited to exploring their dynamics? A sublime aesthetics of ‘delightful horror’ has certainly been explored and fostered by Gothic novels. Other speciﬁc literary forms and genres, too, have traditionally focused on particular affects: for example, the sonnet on love; comedy on mirth and laughter; elegy on mourning and melancholy.43 In Raymond Williams’s view, such literary explorations of affect serve an important function, for they can register and convey to readers wider social ‘structures of feeling’, which he elaborates in a chapter of his Marxism and Literature (1977). Williams argues that ‘the social’ has been regarded too much in terms of ‘ﬁxed forms’ of social institution and class tied to ‘formal concepts’, ‘ideology’, or ‘world-view’.44 What we need to grasp more, he writes, is that a person’s experience as a social being is actually ‘present and moving’ and involves ﬂuid, often ephemeral, ‘structures of feeling’ that take shape and circulate among people.45 In engaging with these affective structures, writers and critics ‘go beyond formally held\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nand systematic beliefs’ and are ‘concerned with meanings and values as they are actively lived and felt’.46 That means exploring how the transmission of meanings and beliefs is partly contingent upon people’s experience of them and how they interact with them. Just as Riley asserts that one can adopt different stances of affective identiﬁcation with forms of language, so Williams asserts that the relations between ‘formal or systematic beliefs’ and people’s actual lived experience of them ‘are in practice variable’ and range ‘from formal assent with private dissent to the more nuanced interaction between selected and interpreted beliefs and acted and justiﬁed experiences’.47 These interactions extend to a person’s ‘impulse, restraint and tone: speciﬁcally affective elements of consciousness and relationships: not feeling against thought, but thought as felt and feeling as thought: practical consciousness of a present kind, in a living and inter-relating community’.48 As a critical concept that predates the affective turn, Williams’s structure of feeling is an important one in terms of the opposition between cognitivists and noncognitivists that I’ve discussed, for it involves seeing emotion and cognition to be ﬂexibly fused no less than individuality and community. It’s also a rather loose critical concept; deliberately so, of course, because Williams is pitting it against ‘ﬁxed’ conceptual forms of ideology and wants it to afﬁrm the importance of ‘forming and formative’ social processes and encounters. There is little by way of an actual literary example of a structure of feeling in Williams’s Marxism and Literature chapter, though; the main one involves a range of novels: Early Victorian ideology, for example, speciﬁed the exposure caused by poverty or debt or by illegitimacy as social failure or deviation; the con temporary structure of feeling, meanwhile, in the new semantic ﬁgures of Dickens, of Emily Brontë, and others speciﬁed exposure and isolation as a general condition, and poverty, debt, or illegitimacy as its connecting instances.49\n\nWilliams’s argument is that ideology maintained a generally ﬁxed and narrow ideal of the social by virtue of marginalising particular states of people’s lives as negative aberrations. In contrast, the novelists, through the ‘new semantic ﬁgures’ of their characters, elaborate at length those particular conditions as part of a wider ‘structure of feeling’ and so present a very different image of society in general. Whereas the rigidity of the ideology means it lost touch with the reality of social processes, the novelists, in Williams’s view, present those processes as they are thought and felt such that the writing amounts to a kind of realism of social sensibility.\n\n12\n\nalex houen\n\nIn stressing the important affective labour that writers perform in exploring social feelings, Williams has relatively little to say about how writers might transform those feelings or turn them into something distinctly literary. He does state that changes in ‘literary style’ register shifting structures of feeling, but that still suggests that style is aiding a realist work dedicated to mapping the feelings that are in society. A good example of a writer who makes a counter case for literary emotional labour is T. S. Eliot when he states that: The business of the poet is not to ﬁnd new emotions, but to use the ordinary ones and, in working them up to poetry, to express feelings which are not in actual emotions at all. And emotions which he has never experienced will serve his turn as well as those familiar to him.50\n\nFor Eliot, that ‘working [. . .] up to poetry’ means turning feeling over to things such as rhythm, rhyme, and ﬁgurative imagery, all of which help to convert what was emotionally ‘ordinary’ into something distinctly literary and extraordinary. Burke saw poetry such as Milton’s to be ‘amazing’ in going ‘beyond conception’; Eliot sees poetry as going beyond emotion itself. Consequently, for Eliot, ‘Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality’.51 He takes the measure of ordinary emotion by making poetic estrangements out of it. More recently, Jonathan Flatley has argued that such estrangements can involve a form of literary ‘affective mapping’. Flatley bases his arguments on literary modernism and also takes inspiration, in part, from Williams’s concept of the structure of feeling, arguing that it ‘should emerge, as it has begun to, as a full-ﬂedged parallel to ideology’.52 Flatley’s affective mapping, though, does not involve the kind of realist approach that I’ve associated with Williams’s concept, for it works not primarily through a realist representation of a social space in the world, but through a representation of the affective life of the reader herself or himself. Such a representation is accomplished by way of a self estrangement that allows one to see oneself in relation to one’s affective environment in its historicity.53\n\nFor Flatley, it’s because literature can experiment imaginatively and linguistically to pose an alternative world of possibility that readers who immerse themselves in it can experience ‘self-estrangement’ from their usual ‘affective environment’. The affective mapping is thus largely something that readers can perform on themselves with the text – Flatley gives\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nthe experience of reading Gertrude Stein’s experimental Tender Buttons (1914) as an example: one ﬁnds oneself in a world that does not exist, or that exists only in this space at this moment. This otherness is not liberatory in itself, but inasmuch as the relationships between space and time, for example, that we are used to in our everyday lives are altered in some way, we may see that the logic of the world that we live in is not compulsory.54\n\nFlatley’s shifting stance here regarding the ontological existence of the text’s ‘world’ is particularly interesting; that the text is an imaginary world leads him ﬁrst to assert that it ‘does not exist’ in reality, but this suspended world does take on existence in the event of reading by exerting real affective force and thereby making the reader feel other with it. Let’s consider in more detail this matter of literature being affective in posing its own distinct otherness. The ‘cut-up’ writing of William S. Burroughs provides a good example. Burroughs along with his partner Brion Gysin and others developed the cut-up technique in the early 1960s as a form of textual collage. The basic cut-up method is simple: take at least two texts, cut them into pieces, then recombine the pieces to produce unexpected hybrid statements. Although the materials used in the cut-ups included journalism articles, letters, and diary entries in addition to literary writing, the point of the technique was not simply to represent social structures of feeling but to take and break conventional lines of meaning and affect in order to synthesise alternative potentials from them.55 As Gysin put it: ‘Shufﬂe the pieces and put them together at random. Cut through the word lines to hear a new voice off the page. A dialogue often breaks out. “It” speaks’.56 That ‘It’ arises from the spliced text as a form of otherworldly third-person, or rather ‘third mind’ – the concept of which is acknowledged as being inspired, in part, by Eliot’s The Waste Land (‘Who is the third who walks always beside you’57). Burroughs took the otherworldliness of cut-ups to great lengths by using them to develop his sci-ﬁ imaginings of outer space and alien characters. In his view, the space programmes of the time were encouraging disappointingly conventional structures of feeling; popular magazines such as Life, Time, and Fortune regularly carried articles portraying astronauts and their families as exemplary white, middleclass Americans. In response, Burroughs offered his sci-ﬁ writing as an alternative space programme for readers: by scrambling space-time through cut-ups he saw himself as producing an alternative affective script that enabled readers to have novel forms of experience.\n\n14\n\nalex houen\n\nBurroughs’s novel The Soft Machine (1961) presents a clear example of such scrambled writing in the form of a cut-up that his character Bradly Martin makes: WAS WEIGHTLESS NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE PARIS APRIL 17, 1961 ‘One’s arms and legs in and out through the crowd weigh nothing grey dust of broom in old cupboard Mr. Bradly Mr. I Myself sit in the chair as i subways and basements did before that but hung in dust and pain wind My hand writing leaning to a boy’s ﬂannel pants did no change although vapor trails fading in hand does not weigh anything now Gagarin said grey junk yesterdays trailing the earth was quite plain and past the American he could easily see the shores of continents islands and great rivers’. Captain Clark welcomes you aboard. Glad to have you aboard, reader, but remember there is only one captain of this subway . . .58\n\nThe quoted section (added to the 1966 edition) is presented as being taken from a newspaper article reporting Yuri Gagarin’s voyage as the ﬁrst man in orbit, but it’s obviously not an actual quotation from it. Harking back to Flatley’s comments above, we’re clearly reading a literary scene that ‘does not exist’ in the world. The writing’s suspension from the world is foregrounded not only through the references to ﬂoating in zero gravity, but also through the spliced statements that suspend conventional syntactic sense. The relations between the various phrasings are in turn kept paratactically in suspense by the repeated use of dashes that separate them. These forms of suspension can help to precipitate the kind of ‘self estrangement’ from everyday affect that Flatley describes, such that the expressions of ﬂoating in zero gravity also pertain to the disorientation a reader might feel in reading them. The text is both in suspense and affective, then, and Burroughs also presents his alien textual compounds as extending to composite experiences composed of and with other people and things: ‘One’s arms and legs in and out through the crowd’; ‘Mr. Bradly Mr. I Myself [. . .] as i subways and basements’. For Burroughs, crafting alternative ‘outer’ space with his writing means the text becomes a kind of aesthetic hybrid vehicle (part spaceship, part ‘subway’) in which readers can explore reﬁgured forms of affective relation – ‘Glad to have you aboard, reader . . . ’ It’s not just experimental writing such as Burroughs’s or Stein’s that has a suspended relation to everyday experience and meanings; indeed, as the philosophers Jacques Rancière and Jacques Derrida have argued, an aesthetics of suspension is fundamental to literary writing. Rancière states the\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\ncase regarding art generally when he writes that it ‘frames itself through the constitution of a speciﬁc space-time of suspension with respect to the ordinary forms of sensory experience’.59 Derrida makes a particular case for literature: ‘There is no literature without a suspended relation to meaning and reference’.60 As he explains, although not all literature is of the genre ﬁction, ‘there is a ﬁctionality in all literature’61 such that we accept by social convention that the statements and sentiments of a poem’s speaker, or a narrator or character in a novel, or a character in a play, are not reducible to their actual author. Even when the statement of a real person is used by a literary author (as in Burroughs’s use of Gagarin’s comments above) it takes on an aesthetically suspended status in being framed within a literary work. While Rancière and Derrida discuss artistic and literary suspension mostly in terms of ‘sensory experience’ and ‘meaning’, respectively, others have considered it more in terms of emotion. For example, among the philosophers and critics who take a cognitivist view of literary emotion, two opposing views have developed concerning its status and readers’ emotional responses to it. On the one hand, ‘emotional irrealists’ such as Kendall Walton, Gregory Currie, and Jerrold Levinson have argued that the feelings ﬁction presents are not real but ‘make-believe’, and the emotions that a reader feels in response are similarly imaginary and so not real.62 On the other hand, ‘emotional realists’ such as Berys Gaut and Jenefer Robinson argue that ﬁction can present and elicit real affect. In Robinson’s view, the emotions a reader forms about characters ‘actually work just the same way as they do when we respond to people and events in real life’.63 It’s true that recent experiments by cognitive psychologists have shown that ﬁction stimulates parts of the brain associated with emotion in a similar fashion to non-ﬁctional stimuli. The psychologists have thereby made advances in an approach to affect that W. K. Wimsatt and M. C. Beardsley commented on disparagingly some seventy years ago in ‘The Affective Fallacy’ (1949): ‘the affective critic is today actually able, if he wishes, to measure the “psychogalvanic reﬂex” of persons subjected to a given moving picture’.64 Wimsatt and Beardsley’s criticism of such an approach stems from their belief that it upholds ﬁlm and literature as having real emotional content and effects while occluding the matter of how that relates to their being distinct aesthetic art forms. This criticism relates to the one I made earlier in relation to most cognitivists’ approach: in conceiving the emotionality of ﬁction as interpersonal (character or narrator to reader), they tend to ignore the role that genre, form, and language can play in imaginatively ﬁguring or transforming affect. Gaut does address the status of imagined emotion when, for example, he\n\n16\n\nalex houen\n\nargues that ‘make-believe fear must keep its phenomenology the same as that of fear, because it is a truth of introspection that one can be in a state that feels like fear when watching a horror ﬁlm’.65 The emphasis with ‘feels’ there distracts attention from the importance of the next word, ‘like’. If the distinctiveness of the make-believe affect includes aesthetic awareness of simile and simulation, then how can it be phenomenologically ‘the same’ as real fear? That begs a further question: to what extent might the distinctly aesthetic aspect of the affect be inﬂuenced by formal features, including cinema shots, editing, and special effects? While emotional realists have tended not to pursue the importance of formal artiﬁce in much detail, the emotional irrealists have stressed the artiﬁce of emotion in ﬁction to deny its affective reality. My own view, as I’ve stated elsewhere, is that the suspended status of literary writing presents a reader with distinctly aesthetic forms of feeling that can be experienced as exerting their own affective force despite the suspension. That concept of literary affect is a development of my arguments about how affect can become fused and transformed with language, cognition, bodily feeling, and the imagination. In order to give more of a sense of how that concept facilitates affective critical readings of literary text, let’s consider a brilliant passage from Virginia Woolf’s last novel Between the Acts (1941) that presents the character Isa Oliver reﬂecting on her amorous feelings for someone other than her husband: She returned to her eyes in the looking glass. ‘In love’, she must be; since the presence of his body in the room last night could so affect her; since the words he said, handing her a teacup, handing her a tennis racquet, could so attach themselves to a certain spot in her; and thus lie between them like a wire, tingling, tangling, vibrating she groped, in the depths of the looking glass, for a word to ﬁt the inﬁnitely quick vibrations of the aero plane propeller that she had seen once at dawn at Croydon. Faster, faster, faster, it whizzed, whirred, buzzed, till all the ﬂails became one ﬂail and up soared the plane away and away . . . ‘Where we know not, where we go not, neither know nor care’, she hummed. ‘Flying, rushing, through the ambient, incandescent, summer silent . . . ’66\n\nA cognitivist approach might focus on the emotion in the passage as deriving from a distinct cognitive ‘attitude’ formed subjectively by Isa. Yet in line with the novel’s title, the extract’s emphasis is on how Isa’s feeling emerges through interactions between her and things and language and other people. The ﬁrst sentence presents her identifying with that stock phrase ‘In love’, the quotation marks suggesting that she’s aware of identifying her emotion\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nwith a common form of feeling. Bearing in mind my earlier discussion of Riley and affective identiﬁcation, we can see that language both informs and helps form Isa’s affect – although she also takes up different identiﬁcatory stances with romance, as when she earlier considers her love for her husband: ‘“The father of my children”, she added, slipping into the cliché provided by ﬁction’.67 The forms of love she feels and negotiates are thus various, and combine both her real lived experience and the ﬁctional or imaginary. Her feelings also involve her body, for the ‘affect’ the words exert on her is presented as being very much material in attaching to ‘a certain spot in her’ while also vibrating ‘like a wire between them’. What she feels ‘in her’, then, is an affective betweenness that arises as an interaction between language, bodily feeling, cognition, material things, memory, and her beloved. I stated earlier that in feeling I’m subject to a love that arises between me and my beloved I’m better off declaring poetically that ‘Love You-It-I makes me’. In the passage above, the distinct ‘It’ of love’s betweenness is connected to the affective materiality of words that is ‘like a wire’ ‘vibrating’, which is in turn likened to the ‘quick vibrations’ of an ‘aeroplane propeller’. For Gysin, the synthesis of cut-ups meant that ‘“It” speaks’ from them as a fresh, singular textual composite. In the Woolf passage, affect itself takes on a distinct thirdperson It-ness as an event occurring through a manifold interaction not unlike the composite experience featured in the above extract from Burroughs’s The Soft Machine. I argued that Burroughs’s writing becomes an aesthetic vehicle of affect partly through its modes of suspension; so far, I’ve analysed affect in the Woolf passage from Isa’s perspective, from within her world, but the words-wire-propeller-love that the passage develops takes off as a distinctly literary form of affect largely through the writing’s formal features. For example, the ﬁctionality of Isa as a character in a novel is reinforced by Woolf’s use of indirect and free indirect style, whereby Isa’s thoughts and feelings are blended in varying degrees with the voice of the anonymous third-person narrator who presents them. Isa’s incorporation of others’ language (ranging from stock phrases to songs) is doubled by the narrator’s incorporation of her voice. The indirect style thus presents an intimacy with her trains (and planes) of thought and feeling, yet it’s an intimacy of literary artiﬁce that keeps them aesthetically suspended. That suspension does not mean the passage’s affect remains abstract, inert, or unreal, for the passage itself afﬁrms that feeling can be formed with phrases from ﬁction or lines of poetry, as when the vibratory rhythms Isa feels with her love slip into the trochaic rhythm of the poetry she starts humming. The aesthetic nature of literary emotion is always open to affective interactions with readers.\n\n18\n\nalex houen\n\nIn Lauren Berlant’s view, free indirect style is useful for questioning a cognitive view of subjectivity, for the style’s blending of narrator’s and character’s consciousnesses ‘performs the impossibility of locating an observational intelligence in one or any body’.68 Consequently, she argues, it ‘forces the reader to transact a different, more open relation of unfolding to what she is reading’.69 It’s the artiﬁce of the style that makes the reader aware of having to deal with a synthesised consciousness and so ‘forces’ her to adopt a different ﬂexible critical relation to what she’s reading. That awareness and stance involves treating the text as an aesthetic object. Yet Berlant also suggests that the style is instructive because blendings of mind happen with ‘any body’ in real life. Deleuze and Guattari have argued along similar lines: because a person’s use of language always means speaking or writing a common language of others, language use ‘in its entirety is indirect discourse’.70 And because they see language as having an affective force, they assert that it also engenders forms of indirect feeling: ‘There are many passions in a passion, all manner of voices in a voice [. . .]: that is why all discourse is indirect’.71 That commingling of language and passion accords with their view of affect as emerging through interactions. As in the Woolf passage above, Deleuze and Guattari characterise affect as having a betweenness that is reducible neither to subject nor object and that can take on singular forms, including aesthetic ones. The affects of works of art are distinct ‘beings’ they argue, and a ‘great novelist is above all an artist who invents unknown or unrecognized affects and brings them to light as the becoming of his characters’.72 By ‘becoming’ they mean the process whereby characters’ affects develop through being composed with and of other things (both animate and inanimate), as in the instance of Isa’s words-wire-propeller-love. Rather like Eliot’s notion of poetic emotion, they see writers’ recasting of affect as being indissociable from their materials: ‘The writer’s speciﬁc materials are words and syntax, the created syntax that ascends into his work and passes into sensation’.73 Again, the distinctly artistic nature of the affects doesn’t render them abstract in Deleuze and Guattari’s view, for writers ‘give them to us and make us become with them, they draw us into the compound’.74 I’ve been discussing the affect of literary texts at length, but what about the affective stance of the reader? What part does it play in relation to a text’s ‘compound’ affects? Sianne Ngai’s theorising of literary tone is important for considering these issues. Tone, she argues, is not reducible to a subjective ‘attitude’ of a text’s speaker or character or narrator, for it includes the interplay of ‘objective’ features of genre, form, and style.75 Yet that doesn’t mean tone is synonymous with a text’s varied ‘internal\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nrepresentations of feeling’, nor is it reducible to ‘a reader’s emotional response’ to the text; rather, tone emerges as an ‘affective relay’ between the reader and text, which is also an exchange between the ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’.76 In that respect, it emerges as having the kind of composite ‘betweenness’ that I’ve been ascribing to affect. Ngai also theorises how tone’s affective relay constitutes a speciﬁcally aesthetic feeling: ‘We project the feeling that the object inspires’ and in doing so ‘create a distance between ourselves and that feeling’, which ‘in turn produces fresh affect’.77 That creation of distance ‘constitutes the object as an aesthetic object’, and Ngai notes the affective paradox of the exchange: ‘What is new and surprising is the idea of “detachment” being produced by affect – the idea of a distance attained not from feeling but by feeling’.78 The concept of literary affect that I’ve outlined entails a somewhat different dynamic: aspects of a text’s genre, form, and style combine to present its affective bearing to the reader with its own mode of aesthetic suspension. That suspension is part of the text’s affective bearing, its tonal feeling. A reader can be ‘inspired’ by that feeling and ‘project’ it, but can also bring her own affective critical stance into play. What’s surprising is that suspension isn’t distance from feeling in this relay but is intrinsic to aesthetic feeling. I can imagine that some readers might think that my emphasis on aesthetic suspension amounts to advocating a sense of literary autonomy such that literature and its affects are viewed as being separate from socially-reinforced values of affect in the world. That’s not the case. While it’s true that I’ve afﬁrmed how writers such as Woolf and Burroughs make innovations with form and genre to present distinctly literary approaches to affect, they’re still working directly with social phrasings and values of affect because the innovations involve recasting linguistically how affect is socially borne with language. In the examples I discussed, Woolf does that by reﬁguring affect-laden stock phrases (‘In love’, ‘the father of my children’); Burroughs similarly draws ‘found’ textual material into fresh affective compounds. The literary text’s affects are thus not ontologically distinct from the real world of social phrasings and values, for the latter are there in the text’s language but in a suspended and therefore transformed state. Just as a text’s suspension isn’t distance from feeling but intrinsic to the aesthetic feeling a reader can have of the text, its suspension is also not simply distance from social values of affect but intrinsic to how those are textually reﬁgured. On that score, we also need to bear in mind the Derrida argument that I’ve mentioned: even the practice of accepting literary texts as having a suspended ‘ﬁctionality’ is fundamentally a social convention. How this ﬁctionality bears on social\n\n20\n\nalex houen\n\naffect varies, of course, from text to text, as is evident from the different literary approaches discussed in this volume. Stephen Morton, for example, discusses in his chapter the importance of Williams’s structures of feeling for coming to terms with the critical rendering of subaltern affect that Neel Mukherjee presents in his novel The Lives of Others (2014). In contrast, Amira Jarmakani analyses how the contemporary sub-genre of ‘desert romances’ reinforces an intimacy between romantic values and those of military strategy in the War on Terror. Two further matters to consider: ﬁrst, what about the fact that a reader’s affective stance can prevent him from happily embracing the text’s? And second, Ngai argues that her concept of tone entails a ‘hyperrelational’ feeling of a text’s overall affective ‘orientation’: ‘To speak of tone is thus to generalize [. . .] the “world” of the literary object’.79 But does a text always have one overarching tone or ‘world’? What about a cut-up text or a poetry sequence that can present a reader with various tonal shifts or discrete scenes? Those two matters are important for Lyn Hejinian’s poetry sequence/‘essay’, Happily (2000) which I’ll discuss in closing this section. Claire Colebrook has argued that happiness is a ‘baseline or ground’ affect that ‘organizes all other feelings’.80 That’s because happiness has come to be viewed as the principal affective goal for a person; it’s seen as a constant stable state (as in ‘happily ever after’) to be attained as a telos, an ‘end’ – one that also puts an end to affective volatility or contingency. Thus, as Sara Ahmed writes, ‘One history of happiness could be described as the history of the removal of the hap from happiness’.81 Ahmed argues for an alternative approach to happiness that’s open to the ‘happenstance’ and would be a ‘stance toward possibility’: ‘To have a sense of the happenstance would involve being open to the possibility of good and bad things happening’.82 It would also mean ‘We can value happiness for its precariousness, so something that comes and goes, as life does’.83 That’s easier said than done, though, especially as the conception of happiness as affective ‘end’ has gained considerable traction. Adopting an alternative approach like Ahmed’s requires practice. Experimental writings that use chance methods to explore possibility and the happenstance are one means to such practice, and Hejinian’s Happily is a particularly good example of that.84 Her preparatory notes for the sequence show that she was intent on exploring happiness along lines similar to Ahmed’s. ‘Happiness’, muses Hejinian, ‘erupts in amor fati – it is a term for the uproar in one’s emotions in response to all that comes to one, good or bad’.85 The poem’s performance of being open to\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nfate is aimed at materialising the ‘etymological link’ of ‘happiness’ to ‘happening’ and ‘haphazardness’. Hejinian conjoins those things through the practice of experiment itself: ‘By making sentences as I am – putting down sentence beginnings and sentence ends and then inserting multiple “middles” between those frames – something like “events” occur. Or eventuality(?) is implied. [. . .] Eventuality: a possible event’.86 Such a stance towards the haphazard, like Ahmed suggests, is thus also ‘a stance toward possibility’, one that extends for Hejinian to variations in tonal texture: My intention was to allow for the inﬂux of material that surges into any thought, material that is charged with various and sometimes incompatible emotional tonalities. These emotional tonalities make it impossible to say with certainty that one is happy, for example, just as they make it impossible to say that one is not. That is, one is never solely happy.87\n\nHappily’s 176 lines are thus pieced together to encourage an openness to the happening of the haphazard, which also means being open to a certain haphazardness of affect itself. Let’s consider that in relation to an extract from the text: Context is the chance that time takes Our names tossed into the air scraped in the grass before having formed any opinion leaving people to say only that there was a man who happened on a cart and crossed a gnarled ﬁeld and there was a woman who happened on a cart and crossed a gnarled ﬁeld too Is happiness the name for our (involuntary) complicity with chance?88\n\nIn the second long line here (which runs from ‘Our names’ to ‘ﬁeld too’) we, as readers, are immediately thrown into the happenstance with ‘Our names’ being ‘tossed into the air scraped in the grass’. Does the speaker’s ‘Our’ extend to us readers? How is it possible for the names to be airborne while simultaneously scraping the ground? That makes sense, though, because the line presents the very meaning and identity of the names as being ‘up in the air’, in suspense, even though they are rooted in a particular context that includes the line’s peculiar syntax and its relation to the adjacent lines. The preceding line points us to the importance of the contextual as ‘the chance that time takes’; the sense of a word is always partly determined by the particular context in which it happens to be – for example, look at how ‘who’ and ‘too’ colour each other by rhyming in the second line above – such that its meaning and effect take place as\n\n22\n\nalex houen\n\na singular situated event each time, and so remain open to chance. For Hejinian, it’s not just words that are subject to context; so are people. She asserts as much in her poetic sequence My Life (1980, 1987) with charming concision: ‘A person is a bit of space that has gotten itself in moments’.89 In other words, being a person means getting yourself into situations and happening on yourself in them. We can thus read the second line above to be saying that the ‘man’ and ‘woman’ chanced upon a ‘cart’ in the particular ‘gnarled ﬁeld’ they got themselves into, and ‘happened on’ themselves in the process. And if we’re happy as persons to happen on the happenstance in that way, then, yes, we can afﬁrm with the poem that happiness does name our ‘complicity with chance’ – and, yes, that complicity is partly ‘involuntary’ because the situations and things that affect us are indeed irreducible to our own volition. If ‘we’re happy’ to happen that way . . . I know from my experiences of teaching experimental texts such as Hejinian’s that not everyone will be happy to afﬁrm its affective play. Responses to Happily that I’ve heard in class pertain to a number of the positive and negative affective ranges that Tomkins theorises – notably, interest-excitement, enjoyment-joy, and distress-anguish – but that’s largely because, as Hejinian notes, the poem itself is ‘charged with various and sometimes incompatible tonalities’. A reader’s affective stance can certainly be an important factor in how they develop a critical or theoretical reading, as Sedgwick noted. In her view, critical theory has too often adopted a particular affective outlook that she characterises as a ‘hermeneutics of suspicion’ or simply ‘paranoid reading’.90 One example she offers is New Historicism’s tendency to ‘rely on the prestige of a single, overarching narrative: exposing and problematizing hidden violences in the genealogy of the modern liberal subject’.91 Another example she could have given is Jameson’s Postmodernism, in which he asserts that ‘If we do not achieve some general sense of a cultural dominant, then we fall back into a view of present history as sheer heterogeneity, random difference’.92 Given the prevalence of the paranoid outlook, Sedgwick suggests that critical theory is sorely in need of other kinds of affective comportment. She doesn’t outline an alternative rooted in a speciﬁc affect, but she does describe a form of ‘reparative reading’ that’s notably similar to the happy reading encouraged by Hejinian. In contrast to a paranoid approach, reparative reading means developing one’s critical and theoretical perspective in the process of negotiating the singular features of a text. It requires close readings and attention to the ‘local’ while retaining a sense of contingency. For a ‘reparatively positioned reader’, writes Sedgwick, it can thus ‘seem\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nrealistic and necessary to experience surprise’, and by taking this approach the reader endeavours to ‘assemble and confer plenitude’ on the text, with the understanding that it ‘will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self’.93 From the perspective of paranoid theory, argues Sedgwick, such reparative modes of reading will seem ‘inadmissable’ or superﬂuous, ‘both because they are about pleasure (“merely aesthetic”) and because they are frankly ameliorative (“merely reformist”)’. As the critical concept of literary affect I’ve been developing includes attention to how texts present singular forms of aesthetic feeling, a happy or reparative mode of reading seems particularly appropriate for it, not to mention the chapters that follow.\n\nIII. This book is not intended to cover exhaustively the relation of affects and literature; the enormous ambit and variety of that relation over the centuries makes any attempt to do so impossible. Instead, the volume’s chapters discuss a variety of positive, negative, and aesthetic affects that have been of particular interest to literary writers and to theorists and critics, notably: interest itself, sympathy, bemusement, fun, animatedness, enjoyment, joy, wonder, astonishment, exhilaration, ecstasy, suspense, disinterest, dysphoria, anxiety, disgust, pity, terror, fear, trauma, paranoia, anger, and rage. Outside literature, the thinking about such affects, as I’ve shown, has been both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. Because of this volume’s literary focus, the majority of the contributors work in literary studies, but much of their engagement with affect, as you’ll see, is interdisciplinary, and there are also a few contributors who are based in philosophy, gender and sexuality studies, or communication and media studies. While the literary focus is Anglophone, various chapters also engage with philosophy, theory, and criticism originally written in other languages. Rather than concentrating on one particular genre, the volume presents critical explorations of ﬁction, poetry, drama, as well as criticism and theory, and to reﬂect how the scope of literary studies has continued to broaden there are also some considerations of ﬁlm and media. In assembling the line-up of contributors, I didn’t ask them to adhere to a particular concept of affect, as I wanted the volume to feature a selection of the approaches that have become prominent. For that reason, there is some variety among the chapters regarding whether affect is distinct from emotion or cognition. I also encouraged contributors not to present introductory or summative reﬂections; in line with the tenor of other books in the ‘Cambridge Critical Concepts’ series, each of the chapters presents original\n\n24\n\nalex houen\n\nthinking and research. In reﬂecting on affect as a ‘critical concept’, the volume is largely aimed at presenting the contemporary richness of that for criticism and theory, and there is a similar emphasis on modern and contemporary literature. Affect and Literature is not offering a ‘history of emotions’, or a history of literary engagements with them. That said, because, as I’ve shown, there are particular literary and theoretical lineages of affect – that of the sublime being just one example – some of the chapters do focus on inﬂuential developments in earlier periods, while other chapters show the importance of returning to previous writers and thinkers (Spinoza, for example) when advancing contemporary theory. With twenty-three chapters to follow, I don’t have space to introduce each one in detail, so I’ll ﬁnish by introducing the rationales for each of the book’s three sections while indicating how those sections’ chapters complement each other. The ten chapters of the ‘Origins’ section reﬂect on key developments in areas of philosophy, theory, and criticism regarding the conceptualisation of affect and how it pertains to literature. In Chapter 1 Dana Munteanu discusses the signiﬁcance of writings from Greco-Roman antiquity regarding how poetry and tragedy elicit fear. Stefan Uhlig’s chapter on ‘Secondary Affect’ builds on the thinking about tragedy and affect by considering how their relation was conceived in terms of aesthetic feeling by German theorists such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn, and Kant in the eighteenth century. John Protevi’s chapter presents a theory tour de force in considering the importance of vitalist philosophy for reconceiving affect; starting in the seventeenth century, he ﬁrst discusses Spinoza’s thinking before reﬂecting on Friedrich Nietzsche’s and Henri Bergson’s innovations. Two other chapters develop an understanding of Spinoza’s importance: Jean-Michel Rabaté in Chapter 6 compares Freud’s and Lacan’s psychoanalytic conceptions of affect, and he argues that Spinoza is a particular inﬂuence for Lacan’s; in Chapter 8 Anthony Uhlmann compares Massumi’s concept of affect with Deleuze and Guattari’s partly by contrasting their interpretations of Spinoza. Protevi’s and Uhlmann’s chapters are useful for considering whether affect is distinct from emotion and cognition. Other chapters in the ‘Origins’ section focus more on affect’s intimacy with language and literary writing. Alison Denham’s chapter, for example, considers in detail the philosophical debates about the realist status of ﬁction’s emotions. Helen Thaventhiran’s chapter on New Criticism and Practical Criticism discusses how those critical approaches extend to reading literary tone. Ross Wilson’s piece on Marxist theory considers Williams’s conception of\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\n‘structures of feeling’ as well as Theodor Adorno’s views on the culture industry’s manufacturing of ‘false pleasure’. Geoff Gilbert in his chapter similarly thinks about the social currency of affect and argues that queer theory such as Guy Hocquenghem’s can be seen as a ‘particular kind of affective writing’ that presents ‘style’ and ‘affectation’ as being ‘internal to the life of affect’ itself. Similarly, in developing a postcolonial conception of affect, Sneja Gunew in her contribution analyses a recent novel by South Korean novelist Han Kang to examine how ‘affective grammars’ arise ‘out of speciﬁc languages and belief systems’ and so require translation that is ‘both linguistic and cultural’. The seven chapters of the ‘Developments’ section build on the foci and insights of the ‘Origins’ chapter largely by developing close readings of particular texts. Each of the ‘Developments’ chapters corresponds to at least one particular chapter in the preceding section. In Chapter 11 Benedict Robinson compares early modern conceptions of passion and feeling with contemporary affect theory. His chapter complements Munteanu’s in showing how early modern writers drew on classical philosophy and rhetoric. Matthew Bevis’s essaying on ‘laughable’ Romantic and post-Romantic poetry also discusses eighteenth-century aesthetics and so relates to Uhlig’s preceding chapter as well as Wilson’s points about ‘false pleasure’. Derek Attridge’s chapter on how three contemporary Irish novelists draw on modernist innovations with form develops further the focus on literary affect; closely examining the emotional tone and effect of the novel’s style, his chapter complements both Thaventhiran’s and Denham’s in ‘Origins’. Christopher Nealon’s chapter also addresses the importance of tone; considering it in terms of Marxist and antihumanist theory, his chapter relates to Thaventhiran’s as well as Wilson’s. In Chapter 15 Amber Musser brings the focus back to artistic form with her discussion of Bette Davis ﬁlms. Considering the ﬁlms in terms of camp and melodramatic styles, her chapter complements Gilbert’s preceding chapter on queer theory. Musser raises issues of racialising subjectivity in her discussion, and those issues also bear on Ankhi Mukherjee’s consideration of affect as ‘mode of identiﬁcation’ in the postcolonial novel. As well as drawing on postcolonial theory, Mukherjee discusses psychoanalytic approaches to affect; her chapter thus relates to both Rabaté’s and Gunew’s in ‘Origins’. Stephen Morton continues the postcolonial focus with his chapter on ‘subaltern affects’ in ﬁction and so similarly relates to Gunew’s chapter. In discussing the affective impact of capitalism and debt, his chapter also complements Wilson’s and Nealon’s preceding discussions of Marxist theory.\n\n26\n\nalex houen\n\nThe ‘Applications’ section chapters continue to develop some of the thematic, theoretical, and generic concerns of the preceding sections. The general ‘Applications’ focus is more on contemporary and future lines of enquiry revolving around a particular set of matters: media and communications, capitalism, and an environment of affective relations that extend to ecology, social crisis, and war. In Chapter 18 Margaret Ronda discusses ecopoetics in relation to poetry by Inger Christensen and others. Drawing on Deleuze and Guattari as well as object-relations theory, her chapter corresponds to Uhlmann’s as well as Rabaté’s. Emily Horton’s chapter complements Attridge’s in focusing on twenty-ﬁrst-century ﬁction by Ben Lerner and Tom McCarthy. Like Ronda, Horton considers affect in terms of environment, and in examining depictions of social alienation and disaffection in relation to late capitalism her chapter also relates to Morton’s, Wilson’s, and Nealon’s. Amira Jarmakani keeps the focus on ﬁction with her chapter on ‘desert romances’ about the ‘war on terror’. Asserting that such novels romanticise liberalism, whiteness, and technologies of security in opposition to the terrorists, Jarmakani’s chapter thus complements Musser’s reﬂections on race, as well as Morton’s, Mukherjee’s, and Gunew’s chapters on postcolonial novels. In Chapter 21 Andrew Murphie maintains the focus on twenty-ﬁrstcentury technologies in discussing digital media and its role in transmitting and transforming modes of affect. Eric Jenkins similarly considers the importance of digital technology in analysing cinematic ‘special affects’ associated with formal aspects of ﬁlm, including slow motion, computer-generated imagery, and editing. Jenkins’s chapter thus complements my own brief discussion of ﬁlm form, as well as Musser’s chapter on cinematic style. The ﬁnal chapter is Claire Colebrook’s on ‘Cartesian Affect’, and it stands as something of an Afterword in offering a fresh reconsideration of contemporary affect theory and of how a mind-body dualism is at stake when the theory distinguishes affect and emotion. Her chapter therefore brings the book’s focus back full circle by corresponding to Protevi’s, Uhlmann’s, and Robinson’s considerations of affect theory, as well as my own in this Introduction. So, having outlined the book’s sections and their chapters’ interrelations I am left with one last thing to say: Happy reading, Reader!\n\nNotes 1.
