        "text": "Villain Overview\n\n“ He's melting! HE'S MEEEELLLTINNG! „ ~ Firefly trying to melt Batman.\n\n“ Kerosene, know what I mean? „ ~ Ted Carson as Firefly.\n\nGarfield Lynns, also known as Firefly, is an antagonist from DC Comics, most often going against Batman and Robin, and sometimes Green Arrow. He is a pyromaniac who became horrendously scarred all over his body after a chemical explosion, leading him to wear a flame proof bodysuit during his crimes.\n\nBiography[]\n\nPre-Crisis[]\n\nGarfield Lynns was a film special effects expert who ended up living in poverty. When his attempt to rob a theatre by faking a fire was foiled by Batman and Robin, Garfield found himself being pursued by the Caped Crusader in his attempt to escape.\n\nSeeing a firefly glowing in the distance, Batman mistook it for Lynns' lit cigarette and chased after it, giving Lynns the chance to escape. Inspired by this turn of events, Lynns took on the name Firefly and began his career in crime, utilizing various special effects and optical illusions to pull of his heists.\n\nModern Age[]\n\nAs a child, Garfield Lynns and his sister Amanda grew up at St. Evangelina Home for Orphans, after being taken from their abusive parents. Unlike his sister, who proved to be relatively normal, Garfield gained a reputation as a problem child and troublemaker, resulting in him never being chosen for adoption.\n\nIn his adulthood, Lynns became a pyrotechnics expert working on motion pictures at Gotham City, until he became a victim of poverty and turned to crime. Lynns originally took up arson as a hobby during his robberies, but his troubled childhood caused him to begin seeing visions in the fires he caused. Garfield decided to embrace his pyromania, constructing a flamethrower, jetpack and fire-resistant jumpsuit before attempting his first robbery as Firefly.\n\nNew 52[]\n\nFirefly's history was altered for the New 52. In this continuity, the original Firefly was a pyromaniac named Ted Carson who wore a robotic suit to achieve flight and spread fires. At some point Ted was seemingly killed, allowing someone else to take up the mantle of Firefly.\n\nNightwing found reasoned to believe that this new Firefly had to be former pyrotechnician Garfield Lynns, who may have been motivated by revenge after being fired from his job by his ex-girlfriend and film actress Cindy Cooke. However, he soon discovers that Ted Carson had faked his death and Garfield was a victim of his crimes.\n\nDC Rebirth[]\n\nFirefly's history was further altered as a result of DC Rebirth. In the revised timeline, Garfield Lynns served as Firefly during a past gang war between the Joker and Riddler. However, Ted Carson still eventually took up the mantle himself. Much later, it was revealed that Ted was grooming a protégé named Bridget Pike, who also went by the name Lady Firefly.\n\nInfinite Frontier[]\n\nIn the Fear State tie-in event Firefly along with Killer Croc, Knockout and Cheshire brought by Clayface potential allies seeking a second chance bring them together to defend the Allytown\n\nIn Other Media[]\n\nBatman: The Animated Series[]\n\nThis version of Garfield Lynns was a pyro-technician obsessed with pop star Cassidy, whom he briefly dated. After intentionally rigging a pyrotechnics display to run wild during one of her concerts, he went into hiding to develop a special fireproof flight suit.\n\nCalling himself Firefly, he stalked Cassidy, burning down a music club she helped finance and ultimately kidnapped her. His ultimate plan was to flood the Gotham sewers with a highly flammable gel and disappear with her during the ensuing firestorm. Though Batman captured him and saved Cassidy, the ordeal left her with extreme pyrophobia.\n\nBatman: Arkham Series[]\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins[]\n\nMain article: Firefly (Arkhamverse)\n\nAlong with seven other assassins, Lynns was offered a $50,000,000 reward if he were to kill the Batman on a Christmas Eve night by Gotham's most feared mobster, Black Mask.\n\nHe planted a quadruplet of bombs around a Gotham bridge in order to lure the Bat out of the shadows. It was successful, forcing Batman to visit the bridge, but the bombs were quickly disabled and Firefly himself was defeated, having his scarred, burnt face revealed via a visor cracking family of punches that knocked the pyromaniac unconscious and ready to be arrested by the GCPD.\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum[]\n\nThe Firefly doesn't appear in the game Batman: Arkham Asylum. One of the Riddler's riddles revolves around him. He has an entry in the Character Bios. His profile states: A pyromaniac, Garfield Lynns began as a petty criminal but soon graduated to major crimes centering around arson, torching huge parts of Gotham in the process.\n\nBut his fires soon raged out of control, leaving him horribly scarred by one of his own blazes. His body is almost fully covered with burns, and now wore a full-body flame-retardant suit when he is out pursuing his criminal interests between bouts of incarceration in Blackgate.\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight[]\n\nYears later, Lynns returned to Gotham and join Scarecrow's militia of villains. His job was to incinerate fire stations in Gotham. As Batman encounters him at the first fire station, Firefly is seen flying outside of the building, telling Batman he defeated once a long time ago before flying away on his jetpack.\n\nBatman pursues Firefly in his Batmobile. As soon as he got close enough to him, he ejects and beats Firefly on the ground. Firefly managed to escape on his jetpack after that. After Firefly burned down a third fire station, Batman pursues him one more time and manages to put him behind at Gotham City Police Station.\n\nLego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham[]\n\nMain article: Firefly (LEGO Batman)\n\nFirefly is a supporting antagonist and the only unplayable villain in the story version of the Lego video game Lego Batman 3. Firefly teams up with Killer Croc, Cheetah, Solomon Grundy, and Joker.\n\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold[]\n\nFirefly appeared in the teaser of the episode Emperor Joker. This version of Firefly references the first version of him, having powers that are based off on colors of his utility belt and a suit that looks like a bug. As Firefly robs the gold depository, he comes face to face with Robin and Batman in a red costume. Firefly shoots a beam at Batman, but Batman's red costume deflects it.\n\nFirefly, on the other hand, uses all of his colorful rays on his belt to create a colorful monster known as the Rainbow Creature that shoots colorful rays out of his mouth, each color with its own power. Batman changes the color on his costume into a rainbow pattern that is immune to the Rainbow Creature's beams. As Firefly was about to reach something in his pocket, Batman punches him in the face, telling him what is in his pocket stays there.\n\nArrow[]\n\nGarfield Lynns makes an appearance in episode 10 of Arrow \"Burned.\" He was shown as a firefighter who was believed to be dead after a huge fire several years ago, but survived but with severe burns covering his body.\n\nHe crashes a gala (thrown by Oliver for the fire department as a trap for Lynns) and attempts to kill the Fire Chief for not sending backup to save him on the night of the fire. He is confronted by the hood and commits suicide by walking into fire and burning himself alive.\n\nHe was portrayed by Andrew Dunbar.\n\nThe Batman[]\n\nMain article: Firefly (The Batman)\n\nGotham[]\n\nMain article: Bridgit Pike\n\nA female version of Firefly named Bridgit Pike debuted in the fifth episode of the second season of Gotham \"Scarification\" and continues to appear in a recurring role in the following two seasons.\n\nThis version of Firefly was later carried over into the main DC continuity.\n\nShe is portrayed by both Michelle Veintimilla and by Camilla Perez.\n\nBatman: Bad Blood[]\n\nFirefly is one of the Gotham villains employed by the Heretic on behalf of the League of Assassins. Even after Talia executed the Heretic, the arsonist remained obedient. Outside the hijacked airborne embassy, Firefly engages in an aerial dogfight with Batwing; one of Firefly's jetpack wings is damaged, which makes him lose control, accidentally rushing into one of embassy's engines, which explodes and killing him in process.\n\nSmallville[]\n\nFirefly appeared in the Season 11 comic book of Smallville. When Parallax released his yellow rings, they headed to Arkham Asylum granting the inmates abilities of the Yellow Lanterns. Batman and Nightwing were doing their best to contain the newly powered inmates of Arkham, including Firefly, who have already been transformed into Yellow Lanterns.\n\nBatman fights with Firefly, when suddenly he gets a call from Tess Mercer and Chloe Sullivan in Watchtower, who ask him to secure a single yellow ring for them. Batman fights with Firefly and during the battle he tricks Firefly into colliding to a building. There Batman finds the chance and takes the yellow ring, which tempts him to become his new bearer, from Firefly. After their rings get rebooted, Firefly lost his powers.\n\nDC Extended Universe[]\n\nFirefly appeared in the comic Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice – Batman, which is set before the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\n\nThe Ted Carson version of Firefly was set to appear as the main antagonist in the DC Extended Universe film Batgirl in which he was to be portrayed by Brendan Fraser, who also portrayed the Tasmanian Devil in Looney Tunes: Back in Action and Monkeybone in Monkeybone. The film was completed but its release cancelled as a tax write off.\n\nAttributes[]\n\nThorough knowledge of flammable agents\n\nExtensive arsenal of fire-creating weapons\n\nScarred over 90% of his body\n\nSociopath with intense pyromania\n\nRelationships[]\n\nAllies[]\n\nMafia's and Mobsters of Gotham (formerly)\n\nCorrupt cops of Gotham\n\nCorrupt politicians of Gotham\n\nCorrupt business owners of Gotham\n\nSecret Society of Super Villains\n\nLegion of Doom\n\nSuicide Squad\n\nCriminals of Gotham\n\nOther Supervillains (sometimes)\n\nBlack Mask (sometimes)\n\nHarley Quinn (formerly)\n\nPenguin (sometimes)\n\nCatwoman (sometimes)\n\nRiddler (sometimes)\n\nPoison Ivy (sometimes)\n\nBane (sometimes)\n\nClayface (sometimes)\n\nMad Hatter (sometimes)\n\nMr. Freeze (sometimes)\n\nTwo-Face (sometimes)\n\nCalendar Man (sometimes)\n\nKiller Croc (sometimes)\n\nEnemies[]\n\nBatman\n\nJames Gordon\n\nAaron Cash\n\nGCPD\n\nBatgirl\n\nHarvey Bullock\n\nNightwing\n\nTim Drake\n\nOther Supervillains (sometimes)\n\nJustice League\n\nBirds of Prey\n\nBatwoman\n\nMafia's and Mobsters of Gotham\n\nMaroni family\n\nFalcone family\n\nRupert Thorne\n\nBlackgate staff\n\nArkham Asylum staff\n\nPoison Ivy (sometimes)\n\nTwo-Face (sometimes)\n\nMad Hatter (sometimes)\n\nRiddler (sometimes)\n\nHarley Quinn (formerly)\n\nKiller Croc (sometimes)\n\nCatwoman (sometimes)\n\nClayface (sometimes)\n\nBane (sometimes)\n\nCalendar Man (sometimes)\n\nBlack Mask (sometimes)\n\nSuicide Squad\n\nQuotes[]\n\n“ Thanks but I'm already burned. „ ~ Firefly in the CW show Arrow.\n\n“ Scream for me! „ ~ Firefly in Batman Arkham Origins.\n\n“ Fire is nature's way of clearing the path stand in it's way and you will be destroyed. „ ~ Firefly\n\nNavigation[]\n\nVillains\n\nComics\n\n2-Face-2 | Abraham Langstrom | Alfred Protocol | Alfred Stryker | Alice | Amanda Waller | Amygdala | Anarky | An Innocent Guy | Ares | Arkham Knight | Arnold Flass | Azrael | Baby Doll | Bane | Barbatos | Batman of Zur-En-Arrh | Bat-Mite | The Batman Who Laughs | Bizarro | Black Glove | Black Mask | Blockbuster I | Blockbuster II | Brain | Brainiac | Broker | Bronze Tiger | Brother EYE | Bruno | Calculator | Calender Man | Castle Bat | Captain Fear | Captain Boomerang | Captain Cold | Carmine Falcone | Catman | Catwoman | Cheetah | Cheshire | Circus of Strange | Clayface | Clayface (Matt Hagen) | Claything | Clock King | Clownface | Club of Villains | Cluemaster | Composite Superman | Condiment King | Colony | Copperhead | Cornelius Stirk | Court of Owls | Crazy Quilt | Crime Doctor | Curtis Base | Dark Archer | David Cain | David Li | Darkseid | Dark Knights | Daniel Captio | Deacon Blackfire | Deadshot | Dealer | Deathstroke | Devil Nezha | Dick Grayson (DC vs Vampires) | The Dawnbreaker | The Devastator | Dr. Crane | Doctor Death | Doctor Double X | Doctor Phosphorus | Doctor Randolph Porter | Doomsday | Dollmaker | Donna Troy | Dr. Silversmith | The Drowned | Eggers | Electrocutioner | Emperor Penguin | Enigma | The Eraser | Ernie Chubb | Failsafe | Faceless | False-Face | Falcone Crime Family | Film Freak | Fun Haus | Firebug | Firefly | Flamingo | Floronic Man | Gearhead | General Ulysses Armstrong | Gilda Dent | Gorilla Boss | Gorilla Grodd | Gotham City Police Department | Gillian B.
