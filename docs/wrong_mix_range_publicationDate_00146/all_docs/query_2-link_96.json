        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nANY WORK CONCERNING THE life and romance of Indian days requires a rather accurate knowledge of what these native people produced and how they lived. To weave a narrative of any consequence, the author must be familiar with the implements, utensils and the daily routine of the people. This seems self-evident but many writers have ignored this basic necessity and written purely from imagination, filling in the gaps with pre-conceived knowledge or basing it upon modern adaptations of European practices.\n\nIt is refreshing, therefore, to find an author whose initial work had gone so faithfully into the ethnology of the people of which she writes. Her detailed studies of the Indian way of looking at things and her painstaking effort to find out the exact type of implements, utensils and methods of producing them, reflect in her descriptions. This makes satisfying reading to the expert as well as to the average reader for the narrative then becomes convincing because it is based upon accurate knowledge.\n\nThe career of Mary Jemison, the White Captive of the Genesee, has been the subject of several books and many papers and addresses. Many efforts to describe her life and Indian background have lacked the very essential things which Miss Lenski has introduced. Not only did Miss Lenski make a study of the literature but visited the Indians, many of whom are descendants of the subject of her book. She carefully examined many Indian drawings and discussed with Gaoyaih, one of the skilled Indian artists, the material of which various features in his drawings and paintings were made. Her studies in the various museums containing Iroquois and especially Seneca objects culminated in a very exact understanding of how the people forming the background of her story lived.\n\nNot only is the text interesting but her drawings are of such delightful quality that they will add a vast amount of interest to this work which she issues under title Indian Captive. In them she has caught the spirit of ancient days. The attitudes of the individual figures and the facial expressions are characteristic and most pleasing.\n\n—Arthur C. Parker\n\nDirector, Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences, Rochester, N. Y.\n\nFOREWORD\n\nIN THE EARLY DAYS of the settlement of America, children were frequently captured by the Indians. Sometimes the captivity was of short duration and they were returned to their families. Some of them have left written accounts of their experiences. An interesting fact, revealed by a careful study of the subject, is that many children did not return, some by reason of their own choice. Well-known examples of children who did not return are Eunice Williams, Esther Wheelwright, Horatio Jones, Frances Slocum and Mary Jemison. The three latter lived their entire lives with the Indians, refusing various opportunities to return to the whites.\n\nThe story of Mary Jemison is one of the most interesting of all captivity stories, perhaps because we have a more complete record of it than of any other. At the age of eighty years, she told her memories of her experiences in detail to James Everett Seaver, M. D., and the book was first published at Canandaigua, N. Y., in 1824. It has been issued in some thirty editions, the last as late as 1932. Mary Jemison’s story is remarkable in that it gives us a picture of Seneca Indian life from the inside, told in simplicity and sympathy.\n\nMary Jemison was born of Scotch-Irish parents, Thomas and Jane Erwin Jemison, on board ship during their emigration to this country, probably in the year 1743. She had two older brothers, John and Thomas, and an older sister, Betsey; also two younger brothers, Matthew and Robert, born in this country. The family landed in Philadelphia, then removed to a large tract of land on Marsh Creek in Adams County, Pennsylvania, where they lived for seven or eight years. With the exception of the two oldest boys who escaped, they were all captured by the Indians on April 5, 1758. All except Mary were massacred by the Indians the day following.\n\nMary Jemison, who was called the White Woman of the Genesee, lived all her life with the Seneca tribe of the Iroquois Indians, in the western part of what is now New York State. She married two Indian husbands and had her own farm and home on Gardeau Flats, just below the Portage Falls on the Genesee River. When she died, in 1833, at the age of nearly ninety-one years, she was buried in the Seneca churchyard at South Buffalo, and later re-buried at Letchworth Park in her beloved Genesee Valley. Mary Jemison was loved, honored and respected by both red men and white and many of her descendants still live on the Indian reservations in western New York.\n\nMy story, Indian Captive, presents an interesting theme—the conflict between Indian and white life. Every effort has been made to present an authentic and sympathetic background of Seneca Indian life, as lived in the Genesee River Valley in the years 1758-60. It is the time of the French and Indian War, when the French and the English were competing for help from the Iroquois Indians, in order to stop the onrush of colonists westward. But the fact that the frontier was a dangerous place to live did not hold the pioneers back, and so the ground work for the Revolutionary War was rapidly laid.\n\nThe pre-Revolutionary period in Iroquois life was a transition period. The old Indian ways were being replaced by new ways for which the white man was responsible. The white traders brought iron and steel implements to replace primitive stone ones; cloth to replace deerskin; brass kettles for earthen pots; glass beads for porcupine quills; guns and powder for bows and arrows; log cabins to replace bark long houses. All these things changed the Indians’ mode of living materially and marked the beginning of a new era.\n\nFor a long period the old and the new overlapped. There is no doubt that at this time and even later the Iroquois Indians still clung to many old customs and ways of working, although they were gradually adjusting themselves to the new. I have tried to suggest this transition, emphasizing at the same time those older ways which we have come to think of as typical of the Iroquois—those older ways which distinguish the Iroquois from other Indian tribes found in other parts of the United States.\n\nMy story deals only with Mary Jemison’s childhood—not her later life. Certain liberties have, of necessity, been taken with Mary’s own story, to adapt it to fictional use for modern young people, but the essential facts remain true to Mary’s actual experiences. The chief change made has been a telescoping of events in point of time. Certain events which happened later have been moved forward to take place during the first two years of her captivity, before her early marriage. The Indian baby in my story is her Indian sisters’, not her own. A few details from other captivity stories have been incorporated, to give a better-rounded picture.\n\nBefore she went to Genishau, Mary actually spent four years in southern Ohio; her winters near the mouth of the Scioto River, and her summers in two Ohio River Indian villages—the first at Seneca Town or Mingo Town, located about three miles below the present Steubenville, and the second, called Wiishto, at the mouth of Swan Creek, sixteen miles below the present Gallipolis.\n\nThe actual journey which Mary took from Wiishto to Genishau (which I have not described in my story) covered over 680 miles, and followed a devious route by way of the Muskingum River and its western branch to Upper Sandusky, Ohio, then by Indian trails eastward across the northern part of Ohio to French Creek, Franklin, Pa., then northward to Warren, Pa., Caneadea, N.Y. and Genishau, which was located on the Genesee River near the mouth of Little Beard’s Creek, not far from the present Cuylerville.\n\nThere is some difference of opinion as to whether Mary’s actual age at the time of her capture was twelve or fifteen. I have chosen to keep her twelve. She was known to be small for her age and has been described by those who saw her as a small woman, only four and a half feet in height. Her Indian name was Deh-ge-wa-nus, which meant, literally, The-Two-Falling-Voices.\n\nA privately printed book, dealing with reminiscences of family life in western New York State, prior to 1815, mentions the Indian captive, Molly Jemison. In this particular family, for several generations, Mary Jemison was always called Molly. This would indicate that the nickname was commonly used in the vicinity where she lived and that it clung to her to the end of her life and long after her death. For this reason I have chosen to make use of the more intimate form of the name, Mary, and have called her Molly.\n\nThe designs used on title-page and cover are typical motif taken from Seneca embroideries. The flower design on the cover is called the celestial tree.\n\nOver six thousand acres of land covering the section around the Portage Falls on the Genesee River fifty miles south of Rochester are now known as Letchworth State Park. Here, due to the interest and foresight of the late William Pryor Letchworth, have been assembled an old Indian council house which formerly stood at Caneadea, the log cabin of one of Mary Jemison’s daughters, and a bronze statue representing Mary as a young woman, over her burial place. It is easy to understand why Mary came to love this beautiful valley and why, to those who know her story and go on pilgrimage there, her spirit still lingers by the Great Falling Waters.\n\nFor generous help in the preparation of this book I am deeply indebted to: Mr. Elrick B. Davis of the Cleveland Press for his initial suggestion; Mr. R. W. G. Vail, New York State Librarian, for first bringing the story of Mary Jemison to my attention, and for constant help and encouragement; to Dr. Arthur C. Parker, Director of the Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences, and Dr. Clark Wissler, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, for their helpful interest in reading the book in manuscript and checking it, as well as my illustrations, for accuracy; to Prof Wm. P. Alexander, Buffalo Museum of Science, for checking portions of the manuscript dealing with wild animal life for accuracy; to Mr. Noah T. Clarke, New York State Archeologist, and Miss Bella Weitzner, Assistant Curator of Anthropology of the American Museum of Natural History for checking details; to Mr. Milton L. Bernstein for the loan of several early print views of the Portage Falls; to Maud Hart Lovelace, Beatrice de Lima Meyers, Miriam Elizabeth Bass, G. W. Walker and others for helpful suggestions.\n\nA careful study of Seneca Indian material was made at the American Museum of Natural History, the Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences, the Museum of the American Indian at New York and the New York State Museum at Albany. I wish also to thank the Buffalo Museum of Arts and Sciences for its generous ban of pictorial material.\n\nLois Lenski\n\nGreenacres\n\nHarwinton, Connecticut\n\nApril 4, 1941\n\n1\n\nCome What May\n\nMOLLY CHILD, NOW SUPPER’S DONE, go fetch Neighbor Dixon’s horse.\n\nMolly looked up at her father. At the far end of the long table he stood. He was lean, lanky and raw-boned. Great knotty fists hung at the ends of his long, thin arms. His eyes looked kind though his face was stern.\n\nAll I need is another horse for a day or two, the man went on. Neighbor Dixon said I could borrow his. I’ll get that south field plowed tomorrow and seeded to corn.\n\nYes, Pa! answered Molly. She reached for a piece of corn-pone from the plate. She munched it contentedly. How good it tasted!\n\nCorn! All their life was bound up with corn. Corn and work. Work to grow the corn, to protect it and care for it, to fight for it, to harvest it and stow it away at last for winter’s food. So it was always, so it would be always to the end of time. How could they live without corn?\n\nThe Jemison family sat around the supper table. Its rough-hewn slabs, uncovered by cloth, shone soft-worn and shiny clean. A large earthen bowl, but a short time before filled with boiled and cut-up meat, sat empty in the center. Beside it, a plate with the leftover pieces of corn-pone.\n\nYou hear me? asked Thomas Jemison again. You ain’t dreamin’?\n\nThe two older boys, John and Tom, threw meaningful looks at their sister, but said no word. Betsey, tall, slender fifteen-year-old, glanced sideways at their mother.\n\nMolly colored slightly and came swiftly back from dreaming. Yes, Pa! she said, obediently. She reached for another piece of corn-pone.\n\nInside, she felt a deep content. Spring was here again. The sun-warmed, plowed earth would feel good to her bare feet. She saw round, pale yellow grains of seed-corn dropping from her hand into the furrow. She saw her long, thin arms waving to keep the crows and blackbirds off—the fight had begun. The wind blew her long loose hair about her face and the warm sun kissed her cheeks. Spring had come again.\n\nCan’t one of the boys go? asked Mrs. Jemison. Dark’s a-comin’ on and the trail’s through the woods…\n\nHave ye forgot the chores? Thomas Jemison turned to his wife and spoke fretfully. There’s the stock wants tendin’—they need fodder to chomp on through the night. And the milkin’ not even started. Sun’s got nigh two hours to go ’fore dark. Reckon that’s time enough for a gal to go a mile and back.\n\nBut it’s the woods trail… began Mrs. Jemison anxiously. ’Tain’t safe at night-time…\n\nThen she can sleep to Dixon’s and be back by sunup, said the girl’s father, glancing sternly in Molly’s direction. He sat down on a stool before the fireplace and began to shell corn into the wooden dye-tub.\n\nMary Jemison, do you hear me? he thundered.\n\nYes, Pa! said Molly again. But she did not move. She sat still, munching corn-pone.\n\nJane Jemison said no more. Instead, she looked down at her hands folded in her lap. Her hands so seldom at rest. She was a small, tired-looking woman, baffled by both work and worry. Eight years of life in a frontier settlement in eastern Pennsylvania had taken away her fresh youth and had aged her beyond her years.\n\nLittle Matthew, a boy of three, climbed into his mother’s lap. She caught the brown head close to her breast for a moment, then put him hastily down as a wailing cry came to her ears. The baby in the homemade cradle beside her had wakened. The woman stopped wearily, picked him up, then sat down to nurse him.\n\nYe’ll have to wash up, Betsey, she said.\n\nMolly’s thought had traveled far, but she hadn’t herself had time to move. She was still sitting bolt upright on the three-legged stool when her ears picked up the roll of a horse’s hoofs.\n\nNor was she the only one. The others heard, too. As if in answer to an expected signal, the faces turned inquiring and all eyes found the door. All ears strained for a call of greeting, but none came. In less time than it takes for three words to be said, the door burst open and a man stumbled in.\n\nIt was Neighbor Wheelock. He was short and heavy. Like Thomas Jemison, he too had the knotty look of a hard worker, of a frontier fighter. It was only in his face that weakness showed.\n\nWheelock gave no glance at woman or children. He said in a low but distinct voice to Thomas: You heard what’s happened?\n\nThe clatter of a falling stool shook the silence and a cry of fear escaped. Betsey, white-faced and thin, clapped her hands over her mouth. Mrs. Jemison, the nursing baby still at her breast, stood up. Let’s hear what ’tis, she said, calmly.\n\nChet Wheelock needed no invitation to speak. The words popped out of his mouth like bullets from a loaded gun.\n\nIt’s the Injuns again! he cried, fiercely. They’ve burnt Ned Haskins out and took his wife and children captive. They’ve murdered the whole Johnson family. They’re a-headin’ down Conewago Creek towards Sharp’s Run, a-killin’, a-butcherin’ and a-plunderin’ as they come. There ain’t a safe spot this side of Philadelphy. I’m headin’ back east and I’m takin’ my brother Jonas’s family with me.\n\nThomas Jemison looked up from his corn shelling, but his placid face gave no hint of troubled thoughts. A gust of wind nipped round the house and blew the thick plank door shut with a bang. The children stared, wide-eyed. Jane Jemison sat down on a stool, as if the load of her baby had grown too heavy and there was no more strength left in her arms.\n\nWhat are we a-goin’ to do, Thomas? she asked, weakly.\n\nDo? cried Thomas. Why, plant our corn, I reckon.\n\nYou won’t be needin’ corn, neighbor. Chet Wheelock spoke slowly, then he added, his eyes full serious: You ain’t aimin’ to come along with us then?\n\nThomas Jemison rose to his feet. He thumped his big doubled-up fist on the table—his heavy fist that looked like a gnarled knot in an old oak tree. We’re stayin’ right here! he said.\n\nBut, Thomas, if Chet says the Indians’re headin’ this way… began Jane.\n\nThomas stood up, tall and gaunt. He laughed loudly.\n\nI ain’t afeard of Injuns! he cried. I’ve lived here for eight years and I ain’t been molested yet. There’s been Injuns in these parts ever since we first set foot in this clearing. We’ve heard tell of so many raids, so much plunderin’—I don’t put much stock in them tales. No…I don’t give up easy, not me!\n\nJohn and Tom, the two boys, laughed too. Who’s afeard of Injuns? Let ’em come! they cried in boastful tones.\n\nJane put the baby down quickly in its cradle. She caught her husband desperately by the arm.\n\n\"Don’t you hear, Thomas? Chet says they’ve murdered the whole Johnson family…We can’t live here with Indians on all sides…devourin’ the settlement. Forget the corn.\n\nWe’re stayin’ here, I said! repeated Thomas. Come what may, I’ll plant my corn tomorrow! His voice rang hard, like the blow of a blacksmith’s hammer against the anvil.\n\nIn the silence that followed, Jane’s hand fell from her husband’s arm. Molly ran to her mother’s side and put both arms about her waist.\n\nThomas’s voice went on: As soon as the troops start operations, the Injuns’ll run fast enough. They’ll agree to a treaty of peace mighty quick. Then our troubles will all be over. We’ve stuck it out this long, we may as well stay for another season. Leave a good farm like this? Not yet I won’t! I’ll plant my corn tomorrow! His words were cocksure and defiant, but they brought no comfort to his listeners.\n\nThe baby began to cry and Neighbor Wheelock went out. In a moment he was back, addressing Mrs. Jemison.\n\nI brought my sister-in-law and her three children along with me, ma’am. Her husband, my brother Jonas, is with the troops and I’m takin’ her back east. She won’t stay in the settlement longer. Our horse was half-sick before we started and can’t go no farther. Can ye give us lodgin’, ma’am, for a day or two, to git rested up?\n\nNone of the Jemison family had looked out or seen the woman. She stood by the horse, waiting patiently, with a boy of nine beside her and two small girls in her arms. Mrs. Jemison hurried out to bid her welcome, calling back to Betsey to put the pot on to boil.\n\nBoys, the chores! called Thomas. Then he added, \"Go fetch Neighbor Dixon’s horse, Molly-child, like I told you.\n\nMolly and her father walked out the door together. Despite his stern ways and blustering words, he had a great affection for his children and Molly was his favorite. He put his great, knotty hand on her head and rumpled her tousled yellow hair.\n\nPa… Molly hesitated, then went on: Ain’t you ever afeard like Ma?\n\nWhy should I be afeard? laughed her father. \"There’s nothin’ to be scared of. The Injuns’ll never hurt you, Molly-child! Why, if they ever saw your pretty yaller hair, a-shinin’ in the sun, they’d think ’twas only a corn-stalk in tassel and they’d pass you by for certain!\"\n\nMolly laughed. Then she turned her head and looked back—in through the open cabin door. She saw her mother and Betsey with Mrs. Wheelock and her little ones busying themselves in the big room. She saw the thick oak timber door, battened and sturdy. She knew it turned on stout, wooden hinges and was secured each night with heavy bars, braced with timbers from the"
