        "text": "558 SEAGUY This shift toward more adult audiences is often located in two major works, Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns (1986) and Moore’s Watchmen (1986–87). Both of these deal with science ﬁction tropes. In Dark Knight, Frank Miller creates an older version of Bruce Wayne, retired for 10 years at the start of the story, who feels compelled to resume the mantle of Batman. Set in the near future, Gotham City is a media-saturated, violent nightmare version of a decaying urban landscape, and Miller oﬀers the reader an uncompromising version of an iconic character. In Watchmen, Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons set their story of superheroes within a distinctive alternative Earth of 1985, where Richard Nixon remains president and where atomic science has created the ultimate superhuman. Essentially a murder mystery, this struc- tural tour de force shows the potential of the medium while also making use of science ﬁction concepts familiar in other source materials, such as Charlton superhero comics and an episode of the science ﬁction TV series The Outer Limits. In 1996, DC Comics launched Helix, an imprint devoted to science ﬁction; it featured work by noted creators including Michael Moorcock, Chaykin, and Garth Ennis. The imprint was short-lived, lasting until 1998, and its only major success was Transmetropolitan by Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson, which switched to publica- tion under DC’s Vertigo imprint with issue #13. The series follows the experiences of Spider Jerusalem, a journalist of the future inspired by Hunter S. Thompson’s style of gonzo journalism (as featured in the novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and other works). Jerusalem is a drug-taking, chain-smoking, hard-drinking, foul-mouthed crusading journalist of the future, who operates in an unnamed city (although clues point to it being New York). The series, which uses its dystopian setting to comment satirically on a variety of issues, ran for 60 issues, and is collected in a series of 10 trade paperbacks. Ellis has produced other sf and sf-inﬂuenced titles as well, and remains one of the writers most productive in the ﬁeld. Andrew Edwards SEAGUY. Seaguy, created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Cameron Stewart, is a three-volume series of comic books, with each volume containing three issues. It is published by DC Comics’ Vertigo imprint. Two volumes have appeared at the time of this writing, Seaguy (2004) and Seaguy: The Slaves of Mickey Eye (2009), with the ﬁnal volume entitled Seaguy Eternal being still being planned for the future. The series uses a colorful, whimsical sense of visual design, which is tempered by a darker mood as it progresses. The delay of ﬁve years between volumes one and two seems to have been the result of poor sales for the ﬁrst series. It has been alleged that publication of the second volume was ﬁnally agreed to by DC as a result of a deal struck with them by Morrison, in which he oﬀered his services to join other writers on DC’s weekly series 52 in exchange for being allowed to continue with Seaguy. Despite these problems the series has become a critical success, with some critics declaring volume two to be some of Morrison’s best work.\n\nSEAGUY 559 Seaguy is a non-powered superhero who wears a scuba suit. He is accompanied by his sidekick Chubby Da Choona, a talking, ﬂoating, cigar-smoking ﬁsh who wears a sailor’s hat. They both live in New Venice, a Florida-style location set in the near future (some 50 to 70 years into the future, according to Morrison), full of color and energy. Seaguy and Chubby spend their days watching TV, speciﬁcally Mickey Eye, a charac- ter who has a television show and seems to be a twisted, panoptic version of a Mickey Mouse type icon, and is a disturbing looking eyeball with two legs and one arm. They also visit Mickey Eye’s theme park on a daily basis. Seaguy also plays chess with Death, who is depicted in this series as a skeletal gondolier. Other characters include Old Seadog, Seaguy’s mentor, and Doc Hero, a former superhero who is now compelled to continuously ride a Mickey Eye tilt-a-whirl, having lost the power of ﬂight. At the start of the ﬁrst volume, Seaguy is consumed with the desire to have adven- tures and to be noticed by She-Beard, a warrior woman with facial hair who desires a mate but requires him to beat her in combat. However, the age of superheroes is over and Seaguy is ﬁnding it impossible to even get noticed by her. His boring existence changes when he discovers that a popular new food called Xoo has achieved sentience, and he feels compelled to protect it from forces who are after it. He also hopes to be ﬁnally noticed by She-Beard as a result of this. In addition, Moon rocks are falling to Earth in the form of small meteorites, which is made even more strange due to the fact that they are covered in hieroglyphics, with one such rock having the American ﬂag embedded in it (as planted by astronaut Buzz Aldrin). All of this occurs in a world where, at some point in the past, the superheroes have triumphed over evil and have retired, after beating a supervillain called the Anti-Dad. Series two, Seaguy: The Slaves of Mickey Eye, built upon the cult reputation of its predecessor, and was critically acclaimed in the comics press. It opens with Seaguy, who has retained no knowledge of what happened to him in series one due to the psycho- logical manipulation he was subjected to at the end of series one; this is reminiscent of what occurs to the protagonists in the novels 1984 and A Clockwork Orange, by George Orwell and Anthony Burgess respectively. The second series is darker in tone than the ﬁrst, a more somber echo of the predominantly joyful tone of its predecessor. Chubby has been replaced by Lucky the parrot, and Seaguy has no initial memories of his friend, although Chubby seems to invade his consciousness throughout the series. Mickey Eye now dominates the landscape and Seaguy struggles to cope with life. Seaguy escapes from an institution where he has been incarcerated due to the inter- vention of Tree Guy, Pea Guy and Three Guy, three super-powered heroes who have been inspired by Seaguy. He is then given a new identity, that of El Macho, a “bull- dresser” who has to dress bulls, not kill them like a matador. He also has to deal with the impending marriage of Seadog and She-Beard and the growing power of Mickey Eye during the course if this second series. Morrison has called Seaguy his attempt at a Watchmen-style series in conceptual terms, not in plot or characterization. He is laying down his core beliefs regard- ing the superhero concept, and he has noted that the third volume will bring these\n\n560 SETH concerns to the fore. He has declared it to be a new type of superhero comic, one which consciously avoids current trends that have elevated a violent type of coolness to the fore in the medium, a trend that he dislikes intensely. He sees Seaguy as a move to a more new-wave, Silver Age-inspired aesthetic combined with a modern literary sensibility. This idea, and the work on Seaguy that has occurred as a result of it, is per- haps similar in tone and execution to some of the work created by Alan Moore in his America’s Best Comics (ABC) line. Morrison and Stewart have generated a sense of surreal, weird mysteriousness that has its roots in work like The Prisoner TV series from the 1960s, which Morrison has stated as being a speciﬁc inﬂuence on Seaguy. Morrison gives full vent to his surreal and bizarre interests in this series, and while much can feel illogical or disconnected at times, he ultimately begins to draw the seemingly disparate threads together as each issue of both series progresses. Morrison has stated that Seaguy Eternal, the proposed ﬁnal series of the trilogy, will form the ending to his ultimate statement on comic superheroes, and at the time of this writing is set for publication in the near future. Andrew Edwards SETH (born Gregory Gallant, 1962–) is a Canadian artist and illustrator living in Ontario. Educated at the Ontario College of Art, Seth ﬁrst gained attention for his comics work with his autobiographical series Palooka-Ville, ﬁrst published in 1991 by Montreal’s Drawn & Quarterly, and re-issued in a 10th anniversary edition in 2001. In earlier issues of the series, he recounts daily events, ranging from an episode from 1984 where he was beaten up on the subway, to simply hanging out and talk- ing with other characters. Most frequently, these people are the other two members of the “Toronto Three”—Seth, Chester Brown, and Joe Matt, who became the col- lective public face of mid-1990s autobiographical comics. All three were published by Drawn & Quarterly, worked at that time on largely autobiographical comics, and appeared in one another’s works. Where early Palooka-Ville issues were autobiographical and narrative-driven, later issues are more concerned with the small details of careful, slow story telling and beautifully rendered panels. Seth’s work is elegant and demands that the reader both pay attention to the characters’ facial expressions and notice the backgrounds suﬀused with nostalgia. For example, Palooka-Ville became a way for Seth to start crafting longer stories, such as 2004’s Clyde Fans in which two brothers’ fan business is driven to ruin by the rise of air conditioning. Overall, Seth’s comics work displays a fascination with lost history and the past, be that traveling salesmen in small-town Canada, mystery New Yorker cartoonists, or collecting various artifacts—Pez dispensers, View-Master reels, or comic books (such as in 2005’s Wimbledon Green). Between Palooka-Ville and Clyde Fans rests what is Seth’s most critically acclaimed work. In 1997, he won Ignatz Awards for Outstanding Artist as well as Outstanding Graphic Novel or Collection for It’s A Good Life, If You Don’t Weaken (Drawn and Quarterly, 1996, Palooka-Ville issues #4–9). On ﬁrst pass, this work seems to interweave\n\nSEVEN SOLDIERS OF VICTORY 561 autobiography and history in Seth’s search for a New Yorker cartoonist named Jack “Kalo” Kalloway, meant perhaps to evoke thoughts of Charles M. Schultz—something that makes sense, given Seth’s current work as designer for Fantagraphics’ 25-volume edition of Peanuts (winning both an Eisner and a Harvey Award in 2005). In time, astute readers deduced that Kalo never existed, that Seth created the drawings himself, and that much of the main story was elaborate ﬁction presented as autobiography. Like other commercial illustrators, such as Adrian Tomine, Seth has done the cover art for magazine and CDs, including a 2001 Aimee Mann album (Lost in Space). Seth is also the designer responsible for the April 2006 Penguin Classics revised Portable Dorothy Parker. Seth spent a half-year, starting in September 2006 serializing George Sprott (1894–1975) for The New York Times Magazine, with a revised edition to follow. Other publications include Bannock, Beans, and Black Tea (2004), in which he illus- trates some of his father’s stories, and one volume of his sketchbooks, titled Vernacular Drawings (2001). His most recent work includes solo and touring shows of his ﬁc- tional city of Dominion, and its sister city of Beaver, models created as reference for the buildings in his work. Both have been exhibited in small-scale model form, though Dominion was reworked to include a life-size working movie theater. Anne Thalheimer SEVEN SOLDIERS OF VICTORY. A large-scale series written by Grant Morrison, the umbrella title Seven Soldiers of Victory encompasses eight interlocking comic book series, totaling thirty issues, published by DC Comics between April 2005 and December 2006. Morrison’s project comprises the bookends Seven Soldiers of Victory #0 and #1, with art by J. H. Williams III, and seven intervening four-issue miniseries that spotlight the individual “soldiers.” The seven miniseries are: Shining Knight, with art by Simone Bianchi; The Manhattan Guardian, with art by Cameron Stewart; Zatanna, with art by Ryan Sook; Klarion, with art by Frazer Irving; Mister Miracle, with art by Pasqual Ferry and Freddie E. Williams II; Bulleteer, with art by Yanick Paquette; and Frankenstein, with art by Doug Mahnke. The miniseries were designed to be released on progressive monthly schedules, so that each week a diﬀerent title under the Seven Soldiers banner would be on sale. Although missed deadlines curtailed this intended schedule, the unusual format of the series and Morrison’s structuring of the narrative still contribute to a compelling—if somewhat disorienting—reading experience. The basic premise of Morrison’s Seven Soldiers is to re-imagine the superhero team concept, most conspicu- ously by featuring revised versions of obscure or minor characters from the DC stable unwittingly cooperating together in order to stop an impending menace. As with much of Morrison’s work for DC, Seven Soldiers draws heavily upon the writer’s extensive knowledge of the company’s publishing history and lore. The Seven Soldiers of Victory ﬁrst appeared in Leading Comics #1 (Winter 1941–42), but the team’s continuity within the DC universe is convoluted and obscure. The origi- nal team, also known as “Law’s Legionnaires,” was created by Mort Weisinger and Mort Meskin in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the superhero team format\n\n562 SEVEN SOLDIERS OF VICTORY utilized in the popular Justice Society of America, and ran for the ﬁrst 14 issues of Leading Comics. The team’s members were drawn from anthology books, and included Green Arrow and his sidekick Speedy, the Crimson Avenger, the Shining Knight, the Vigilante, and the duo Star-Spangled Kid and Stripesy, as well as an unoﬃcial “eighth member,” the Crimson Avenger’s sidekick, Wing. This version of the team was reintro- duced in Justice League of America #100 (1972), in a story where the Justice League is contacted by their Earth-2 counterparts, the Justice Society. The society is seek- ing assistance from the Justice League in locating the lost members of the legendary Seven Soldiers, who were scattered across time and space—and seemingly erased from collective memory—as an unfortunate consequence of their ﬁnal victory against the threat known as the Nebula Man. After this revival in Justice League of America, the Seven Soldiers franchise would remain eﬀectively dormant until DC’s company-wide retroactive continuity revamp in the wake of Crisis on Inﬁnite Earths (1986). In the initial reworking of the Seven Soldiers, Wing was promoted to full membership and the Vigilante’s sidekick, Stuﬀ, was made an active member in order to replace Green Arrow and Speedy, who no longer had Golden Age counterparts. Even this revised version would be subsequently changed in the late 1990s, with Wing’s spot as a soldier now ﬁlled by the archer known as The Spider, who had previously appeared in the Crack Comics feature, “Alias the Spider,” published by defunct Quality Comics. This current version of the Seven Soldiers parallels the scenario presented in Justice League of America #100: the forgot- ten team is dispersed and lost throughout time after a battle with the Nebula Man. The major diﬀerences are that newly added member, the Spider, is actually a villain who sabotaged the team’s ﬁnal mission, and that the Vigilante spends 20 years ﬁghting crime in the Old West before being rescued by the Justice League and Justice Society. This version of the team and its continuity is used as the starting point for Morrison’s Seven Soldiers of Victory. The plot of Morrison’s Seven Soldiers centers around an invasion from a fairy-like race of beings from the future called the Sheeda. The Sheeda attack Earth periodi- cally throughout history, devastating the planet through a process called the Har- rowing, which leaves Earth and humanity with just enough resources to survive and rebuild in order to be conquered again. Prophesy states that a band of “seven soldiers” will eventually stop the Sheeda, so the army targets teams of seven during their invasions. To counteract this strategy, the mysterious Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp subtly orchestrate events that prod the current, individual soldiers into battling the Sheeda without ever realizing that they are cooperating with the others. Throughout the separate miniseries, the characters occasionally cross paths in their struggles against the Sheeda, and their respective journeys converge in the second bookend issue that concludes the story, but they generally remain unaware of each other and the ways their eﬀorts coincide. Ultimately, the Sheeda are defeated and Klarion usurps the leadership of the assassinated Sheeda Queen, returning with them to their future as king, thereby fulﬁlling the prophesy that a soldier will turn\n\nSEVERIN, JOHN 563 traitor. Another prophesy states that one soldier will die, which seemingly comes to pass when Shilo Norman, Mister Miracle, sacriﬁces himself to defeat the villain who unleashed the Sheeda on humanity, Darkside. The series’ ﬁnal image, however, is of Norman’s hands bursting from his grave, indicating that the world’s greatest escape artist found a way to cheat death. Despite complaints of lateness in the publication of individual issues, Seven Soldiers was a commercial success, due in part to Morrison’s popularity and the consistently high quality of art. The maxi-series was also critically well-received, winning the Eisner Award for Best Finite/Limited Series in 2006. Although not Morrison’s strongest or most incisive work, Seven Soldiers is nevertheless a considerable accomplishment, espe- cially as an experiment in the possibilities of comic book storytelling. For example, the mosaic structure and unusual publication format allow for a variety of reading expe- riences. Moreover, the patterned structure highlights Morrison’s desire to move away from cinematic comics and the increasingly popular screenplay style of comics writing. Seven Soldiers expands the borders of the superhero genre by incorporating disparate inﬂuences, such as speculative architecture, Celtic mythology, “Goth” subcultures, DC continuity, the occult, and hip-hop, among others. As with much of Morrison’s work, some critics have charged that—at least occasionally—Seven Soldiers borders on incomprehensibility, yet much of the appeal of the series lies in its zaniness and frenetic energy. In fact, the inevitable confusion one encounters when reading Seven Soldiers is one of its charms, as it replicates the disorientation a new comics reader faces when confronted with decades of complicated continuity. Unlike many writers of mainstream superhero comics, whose inclinations are to sieve and streamline continuity in order to make it as accessible and continu- ous as possible, Morrison (as exempliﬁed by Seven Soldiers) embraces convolution and outlandishness as sources of unique storytelling opportunities. Jackson Ayres SEVERIN, JOHN (1922–). In a career that has spanned over 60 years, John Severin has demonstrated that he is one of the very best artists to ever work in war/military and Western comic books. He has always had a tremendous passion for his subject mat- ter and has illustrated countless stories in an exquisite, ﬁne lined, realistic style. Not only is Severin an accomplished penciller and inker, but he is a talented humorist and caricaturist as well. Though he began drawing cartoons professionally at the age of 10, Severin was not a fan of comic books and had only purchased a single comic as a boy. After graduating from New York’s High School of Music and Art, he began to work with Harvey Kurtz- man and Will Elder. After learning how much Kurtzman got paid for such work, he entered the ﬁeld and published his ﬁrst comic book story in 1947. The job was for Joe Simon and Jack Kirby and the story was published in Crestwood’s American Eagle. Severin penciled it and Will Elder inked it. The two would collaborate for many years and become one of the great teams in comic book history.\n\n564 SEVERIN, MARIE In 1950, Severin and Elder followed Kurtzman over to EC Comics to work on Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat. Kurtzman felt that both artists complemented each other wonderfully and created some of the ﬁnest work ever done in the genre of war books. Eventually this partnership did break up. Severin stated it was on friendly terms and that both were just “set to go on our own.” Severin continued to work at EC and was an important contributor to Kurtzman’s MAD Magazine, his work appearing in 9 of the ﬁrst 10 issues. Severin never worked on any of the EC horror comics simply because, he claimed, working on such subject matter made him sick. Severin was editing Two-Fisted Tales at the time of EC’s collapse in the mid-1950s. In 1956 Severin accepted a staﬀ position with Stan Lee at Atlas, working primarily on Westerns. When Atlas became Marvel in the early 1960s, Severin worked on a variety of material including The Hulk, and a long run inking Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos for which he won the Alley Cat Award for Best War Title of 1967 and 1968. Also, Severin was the main artist for Cracked from the ﬁrst issue in 1958 until very recently and he freelanced for Warren Publications (Creepy and Blazing Combat) and DC (Sgt. Rock). In the 1970s he teamed up with his younger sister and longtime EC colorist, Marie Severin, to work on Marvel’s Kull the Conqueror. In 2003, Severin worked on Marvel’s highly publicized and controversial gay interpretation of Rawhide Kid. When asked what his favorite work had been, Severin replied that it had been “at EC, Warren, and Cracked because he had the most free expression with them.” In 2003, John Severin was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame.

Marie Severin is an award-winning, pioneering woman cartoonist. In the 1960s she was the only woman drawing for mainstream comic books. In the 1970s, she was one of two women drawing for the mainstream, the other being Ramona Fradon. It is symbolic that Stan Lee, who liked to give rhyming or alliterative names to the Marvel creators (Sturdy Steve Ditko, Jolly Jack Kirby, Genial Gene Colan) refereed to Marie Severin as “Marie the She,” for indeed, she was the only “she” drawing for Marvel at the time. Severin attended Pratt Institute for exactly one day before deciding that what they were teaching was not what she was interested in learning. Subsequently she attended and graduated from the Cartoonists and Illustrators school in the early 1950s. In 1952, at the suggestion of her brother John Severin, who was one of the EC artists, Severin went to work for EC Comics. She started as a Girl Friday, but soon progressed to doing full-time production, coloring, and researching as Harvey Kurtzman’s assistant. The ﬁrst book she worked on was “A Moon, A Girl . . . Romance,” which had formerly been Moon Girl comics, but she worked on all the EC books, ﬁnally leaving when, as\n\nSGT. FURY AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS 565 a result of the 1954 Kefauver hearings, EC canceled all their comic book titles and turned Mad Comics into a magazine. Severin was hired by Atlas comics in 1956, doing touch-up, paste-up, lettering, and other production work until the comic book implosion of the late 1950s, when Atlas, like most of the comic book publishers in the last 1950s, severely reduced their staﬀs to keep from going under. In 1958 she went to work as a staﬀ artist for the Federal Reserve Bank, where she produced, among other things, a 20 page comic book called“The Story of Checks.” During this period, she was also freelancing, and drew a story for DC’s Challengers of the Unknown #4, in 1958. She returned to Timely, now called Marvel Comics, on a freelance basis in 1964 and joined the staﬀ in 1965. She continued doing production work until 1966, when she drew her ﬁrst comic book for Marvel, an issue of Doctor Strange. Among the many titles Severin has worked on for Marvel over the ensuing years are Sub-Mariner, Crazy, The Hulk, Iron Man, FOOM (the Marvel in-house magazine), The ﬁrst issue of The Cat (inks) and the ﬁrst issue of Star Wars (colors), and a special one-shot, “The Life of Pope John Paul,” in 1982. She also worked on Marvel’s Star line during the 1980s, drawing the Muppet Babies and eight issues of Fraggle Rock, and has said in interviews that her favorite work has been light, humorous stories like the ones she drew for the Star line. Marie Severin received the Inkpot Award at the San Diego Comicon in 1988, and in 1997 she was inducted into the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame by Friends of Lulu, an organization that promotes participation in comics by women. She was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 2001. Trina Robbins SGT. FURY AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS. Sgt. Fury and His Howling Comman- dos were a heroic group of seven highly capable misﬁts led by Sgt. Nick Fury, whose cigar chomping, take-no-prisoners attitude informed their commando raids during World War II throughout all of Europe, and on occasion Japan. In the early 1960s, Marvel wanted to work oﬀ the formula that brought DC success with their army comic book Our Army at War, speciﬁcally the character Sgt. Rock. In response, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Dick Ayers combined their eﬀorts and created Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos, who ﬁrst appeared in their own self-titled comic in 1963. The group was composed of fairly standard formulaic types, including the second in command “Dum Dum” Dugan, who was a former circus performer (and requisite Irishman, complete with bowler); Dino Manelli, a handsome man/movie star who joined the war to do his duty; Izzy Cohen, the jaunty Brooklynite who could ﬁx any- thing;“Junior” Juniper, the Ivy League college graduate who met an untimely end early on in the series; “Rebel” Ralston, a southern Jockey who was wiry and a sure shot; and Gabriel Jones, an African American who liked to play his bugle while going into battle. This last member of the team is of interest, as regular units of the American Army in World War II were segregated until near the end of the war. The timing of\n\n566 SGT. FURY AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS the comic book coincided with the height of the Civil Rights movement in the United States as well. The commandos were often used for behind the lines missions, similar to the true- life exploits of British commandos during World War II. The unit would often end up managing to get out of some close call that put them against the Germans in France. Eventually the Germans countered with their own unit, The Blitzkrieg Squad, led by a Colonel Baron von Strucker. The Germans were continually defeated, after which the Howling Commandos would return to England to be re-assigned by Captain “Happy Sam” Sawyer. Even the death of “Junior” Juniper did not hamper the team. He was replaced with a British soldier, Percival Pinkerton. While aﬀecting typical British manners and provid- ing comic relief, Pinkerton proved himself to be an outstanding soldier. As with many of the comic books that centered on war themes, the Howling Commandos were always in the thick of the ﬁghting, or training for action. The story lines, while discussing combat in World War II, also took on concepts of bigotry, competition within services, vaudeville (through Dum-Dum’s continual comments on his mother-in-law), and even some romance. Fury at one point was involved with a British countess, whose brother was a Nazi sympathizer. It was on a rescue mission to bring back the brother (Lord Haha) that Junior Juniper was killed. As always, the war interfered with the sergeant’s love life. The countess Pamela Hawley was killed later in the series, and this further doomed Fury to be alone. In keeping with their general policy of allowing popular characters to cross over from one comic to another, Marvel often had characters from other comics temporarily join the Howling Commandos. For instance, Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four) was an OSS oﬃcer in the famous Lord Haha episode, while Captain America sometimes fought alongside the Howlers. Many of the characters introduced in the Sgt. Fury series went on to be featured in the continuation series, Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., in which Fury headed up an agency of super spies. While Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos served as a counter to DC’s Sgt. Rock, the two did have their diﬀerences. The Howlers were constantly involved with combat as ﬁrst squad of Able Company, First Attack Division. DC’s war comics were more serious in tone, as opposed to the Sgt. Fury comics, which used humor, romance, and slapstick in telling their stories. That humor also included a number of inside jokes. For example, Dick Ayers (artist) and Stan Lee (writer) made cameo appearances in Sgt. Fury #22, and the creators of the comic often identiﬁed themselves by their former service branch. Often Fury showed a disobedience that would only be set oﬀ by outstanding results as a soldier. However, the Howlers were anything but realistic professional commandos. They fought with their ﬁsts rather than with weapons, and often exposed themselves unnecessarily to enemy ﬁre or possible harm. While the con- cepts of honor and redemption were clearly used in the comic book story lines, the action was far diﬀerent than the cold reality of combat, where people die, suddenly\n\nSHADOW, THE 567 and violently. The stories also often addressed current events, as in several issues that dealt with racism. The series was immensely popular, and soon Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. was created. Both series ran simultaneously for several years. The characters Fury, Dum Dum and Gabe continued on in the S.H.I.E.L.D. series. Fury has been re-imagined again and again over the years, and remains a popular character. He ﬁgured into the Civil War series as a man who no longer ran S.H.I.E.L.D. and whose stance on the question of superhero registration was generally unclear. Fury was also brought back to his World War II roots with the miniseries Fury: Peacemaker, created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. Here, Fury was a far more realistic soldier, as well as a far more ruthless one. The new series showed his character ﬂaws, and yet gave him believability as a man who had a drive to do “the right thing.” In the end, Fury still served as a long lasting and popular character within the Marvel Comics stable. Cord Scott SHADOW, THE.“Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!” Those chilling words were uttered by the mysterious vigilante known as The Shadow, ﬁrst on radio and later through a series of adventures in pulp magazines, comic strips, comic books, and motion pictures. The Shadow was an ominous avenger who helped popularize the concept of a crimeﬁghter operating under a secret identity. He terriﬁed his adversaries with both his maniacal laughter and willingness to use deadly force. It was not uncommon for him to act as judge, jury, and executioner as he gunned down criminals with his two blazing .45s. The Shadow debuted as the narrator of radio’s Detective Story Hour in 1930. The program was sponsored by Street and Smith Publications in order to promote their weekly Detective Story Magazine. The character, which was originally voiced by James LaCurto, was intended to only introduce dramatizations of the magazine’s stories. How- ever, listeners soon became fascinated by the mysterious storyteller with the sinister voice and demanded to learn more of his exploits. To capitalize on The Shadow’s unan- ticipated popularity and to protect their copyright interests, Street and Smith created a new pulp magazine, The Shadow, a Detective Magazine. Journalist Walter Gibson, an amateur magician who had ghostwritten for Houdini, was commissioned to develop the character. Gibson’s ﬁrst novel-length story, The Living Shadow, was published in 1931. He wrote 282 of the 325 Shadow adventures that appeared in the magazine over the next 18 years. Gibson, who wrote under the pseudonym Maxwell Grant, is credited with establishing many of The Shadow’s most recognizable trademarks, gimmicks, and supporting cast. The Shadow was depicted as a thin man with a hawk-like nose and piercing black eyes. He wore a long, black, crimson-lined coat, a broad-brimmed slouch hat, and later sported a red scarf to conceal the lower portion of his face. In print, The Shadow employed numerous identities in his war on crime, such as businessman Henry Arnaud, elderly gentleman Isaac Twambley, and Fritz, an old janitor who worked at police\n\n568 SHADOW, THE Alec Baldwin as Lamont Cranston, a.k.a. the Shadow, in the 1994 film The Shadow, directed by Russell Mulcahy. Universal/Photofest headquarters. His most prominent alias was that of Lamont Cranston, a millionaire playboy. In 1937, The Shadow Unmasks revealed the hero’s true identity to be Kent Allard, a famed World War I aviator and spy. Seeking new challenges after the war, he faked his death in a South American jungle and returned to the United States to ﬁght crime. Later adventures created more ambiguity as they raised questions regarding the validity of this origin. On radio and other media, this complicated back-story was dis- carded as Lamont Cranston was The Shadow’s true self. While the hero possessed no true superpowers, he was said to have acquired “the mysterious power to cloud men’s minds, so that they could not see him” while he was traveling throughout Asia. The Shadow was often assisted by a network of agents who joined in his crusade against crime. The most notable were his right-hand man Harry Vincent, cabdriver Moe “Shrevy” Shrevnitz, radio operator Burbank, gangster Cliﬀ Marsland, and Margo Lane, a wealthy socialite and potential love interest. He also gained numerous enemies, such as international spies, mad scientists, gangland kingpins, and various supervillains. The Shadow’s most frequently recurring foes included The Voodoo Master, The Cobra, and The Wasp; Shiwan Khan, The Shadow’s archenemy, ﬁrst appeared in 1939. This descendant of Genghis Khan repeatedly fought the hero in his attempts to conquer the world. The Shadow’s popularity in the pulp magazines led to a wave of merchandise that included coloring books, wrist watches, sheet music, disguise and ﬁngerprint kits, and comics. In 1937, the character returned to radio, but not as merely a narrator. Orson Welles starred as Lamont Cranston and Agnes Moorehead portrayed Margo Lane in\n\nSHOOTING WAR 569 the adventure series. Welles’s Shadow was less deadly than the version seen routinely in the pulps. Although Welles left the show after only a year, the program remained a radio favorite until its cancellation in 1954. In newspapers, The Shadow comic strip, which ran from 1939 until 1942, was written by Walter Gibson and illustrated by Ver- non Greene. The Shadow has also been seen many times in motion pictures. His ﬁrst ﬁlm appearance came in 1937’s The Shadow Strikes, starring Rod LaRocque. A sequel, International Crime, was released in 1938. Victor Jory played the hero in a 1940 serial. Kane Richmond then took over the role in the low-budget The Shadow Returns in 1946. It was followed by two forgettable sequels. In 1994, Alec Baldwin took on the role of The Shadow/Lamont Cranston in The Shadow. This ﬁlm combined both the pulp novel and radio versions of the character. In 2006, Hollywood director Sam Raimi expressed interest in producing a new ﬁlm that would introduce The Shadow to another genera- tion of fans. The Shadow has routinely appeared in comic books over the decades. From 1940 to 1949, 101 issues of Shadow Comics were published. Beginning in 1964, Archie Comics published an eight issue series titled The Shadow. This is the most bizarre interpreta- tion of the pulp hero, in which The Shadow is seen as a muscular blonde man wearing green and blue superhero costume. A more faithful and critically praised version of the character came in a12-issue series produced by DC Comics from 1973 to 1975. Writ- ten by Dennis O’Neil and drawn by Mike Kaluta, this series was highly inﬂuenced by Gibson’s novels. The Caped Crusader even encounters The Shadow during this period in Batman #253 and #259. DC revived The Shadow again in the 1980s, but placed him in modern-day New York, a move that proved unsuccessful. Marvel Comics then published Hitler’s Astrologer (1988), a Shadow graphic novel. From 1989 to 1992 DC published The Shadow Strikes. This series was set in the 1930s and is notable for fea- turing The Shadow’s ﬁrst team-up with Doc Savage, another pulp hero. Dark Horse Comics next took on The Shadow in two miniseries, In the Coils of the Leviathan (1993) and Hell’s Heat Wave (1995). Dark Horse also published The Shadow and Doc Savage (1995), a miniseries that pitted the heroes against Nazi kidnappers. The Shadow is one of the most notable pulp heroes. His menacing vigilantism inspired later comic book heroes and taught generations of fans that “the weed of crime bears bitter fruit.” Charles Coletta SHOOTING WAR. A web-comic and graphic novel written by Anthony Lappé and illustrated by Dan Goldman, Shooting War is a satire of contemporary journalism, war, and politics. The book is unique in that it integrates contemporary people and places with dramatic artistic styling and actual location photography. Shooting War is a mod- ern fable about the power of media and celebrity, and what happens when one’s ethics contradict one’s career. The central character of Shooting War is Jimmy Burns, a 20-something indepen- dent video blogger from Brooklyn who is determined to uncover corporate greed with his live independent vod-casts. While he is uploading a program to his Web site in a\n\n570 SHUSTER, JOE Starbucks coﬀee shop, the shop explodes. The explosion, a result of a terrorist attack, has Burns in the right place at the right time, capturing it on video. Global News, a world-wide media conglomerate, gets the feed from his site and broadcasts it, making Burns an instant celebrity hounded by other media. After the typical rounds of interviews with print and television personalities, Burns agrees to work for Global News, the epitome of the media entities critiqued by his anticapitalistic blogs. However, working from the inside to expose the gritty underbelly of life appeals to Jimmy, so he accepts. He is hooked on the adrenaline rush that comes with war reporting. In pursuit of the ultimate war story, Jimmy Burns and a military crew head to Baghdad but get shot down and captured by the terrorist group, The Sword of Mohammed. Convincing the group to let him live by broadcasting their message live, Burns becomes the media outlet for the group. With this new role, Burns is released and ﬁnds himself back in his hotel awaiting contact with a new producer but is given an ultimatum— broadcast the group’s messages or face the consequences. As Shooting War continues, the plot has Burns encountering a variety of attacks, all controlled by the Sword of Mohammed. Torn between doing what is right and report- ing the news, he realizes that he has become the media pawn for the group. This troubles Burns, but also intrigues him as a journalist. Another prominent journalist, Dan Rather (now reporting for the Dallas Mavericks), works with Burns to help him realize that reporting is more than just uncovering the facts, but being able to do the right thing for the good of society. Rather, in a tense battle scene, ends up saving Jimmy in a heroic turn of events that could have ended both of their lives. At the end of the book, Burns stands on his own and becomes an independent journalist in order to report breaking stories throughout the world. The book satirizes media exploitation, truth, politics, and corruption of power. It also shows the power of public journalism and its responsibility to both society and the citizens who watch it. As Marshall McLuhan famously said, “the medium is the message.” In this case, the message in Shooting War is one of caution because things are not always as they appear to be.

Shuster was born in Toronto, Canada, and moved to Cleveland, Ohio. Growing up, Shuster was a fan of the Wash Tubbs comic strip and the pulp illustrations of Frank Paul. Shuster would draw on his mother’s breadboard on old wallpaper, packages, and anything else he could ﬁnd. At Alexander Hamilton Junior High School, Joe drew com- ics for the school newspaper, The Federalist. At Glenville High School, Shuster was in- volved with set design for the drama club and won a cartoon contest about Thanksgiving.\n\nSHUSTER, JOE 571 He also won a citywide poster contest for a football game. Shuster agreed to illustrate and design a ﬁve-issue fanzine named Science Fiction written by Siegel. Unable to get a scholarship to the prestigious Cleveland School of Art (he received Honorable Mention), Shuster continued to draw from magazines and took night classes at the Huntington School of Art. Driven by Siegel’s relentless drive to publish, Shuster was soon drawing many Siegel cartoon scripts including “Bruce Verne, G-man of the Future” and “Snoopy and Smiley,” among others. Yet it was Shuster’s ability to draw strongman heroes and gorgeous damsels that helped the duo get published starting in 1935 with several serials in More Fun Comics, New Comics, Adventure Comics, and Detective Comics. In these comics, Shuster used ﬁlm techniques to provide emotional close-ups and stunning full- page action sequences, often elevated by Shuster’s creative use of Craftint paper. At the same time, they worked on another character: Superman. Shuster designed the famous costume using elements of physical ﬁtness culture, of which he was a strong follower. Superman was ﬁnally bought for $130 (including the rights) and the character debuted in Action Comics #1 (1938). Shuster (who was born with poor eyesight) opened his own Cleveland studio—with young artists such as Wayne Boring, Leo Nowak, and John Sikela—to help with the workload. Early stories were also lettered by Shuster’s brother, Frank. After World War II, Siegel and Shuster began proceedings to sue their employer, National Allied Publications (the primary direct forerunner of DC Comics) for the rights to Superman and were con- sequently ﬁred. Shuster teamed up with Sie- gel again on the comic Funnyman (1947), taught, and contributed pencils and covers to horror and racing comics. In the late 1950s and in need of money, he did anonymous work on the Nights of Horror magazines, which depicted his famous archetypal characters in outlandish fetish fantasies. Shuster tried to launch an art show and cre- ated a cartoon called “Kosmo,” but neither worked out. He moved to California and was married brieﬂy to Judy Calpini in 1975, the same year that he and Siegel were granted a pension by DC and were returned Artist Joe Shuster, who co-created Superman (ca. 1980s). to the byline of Superman.

Jerry Siegel was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Lithuanian Jewish immigrants and is the famous co-creator (with Joe Shuster) of Superman. When his father died of a heart attack during a hold-up in 1932, Siegel turned to reading and writing as a means of escape and expression. In high school, he wrote prodigiously for the school newspaper, The Glenville Torch. Siegel also self-published ﬁve issues of an early fanzine called Science Fiction which included the story “The Reign of the Superman,” a pulp homage illustrated by Shuster about a bald scientist who creates an evil mental marvel. Inspired by early comic books such as Detective Dan, Siegel and Shuster sent pitches for comics to early publishers (Consolidated Publishing) and local newspapers (The Cleveland Shopping News) but to no avail. They ﬁnally sold a series of short comics to More Fun Comics, New Comics, and Adventure Comics starting in 1935 with “Henri Duval,” which was followed by “Spy,”“Radio Squad,”“Doctor Occult,” and“Slam Bradley” which Siegel wrote for Detective Comics from 1937 to 1941. Siegel’s narratives are heavily pulp in tone but also humorous as well, draw- ing from a variety of print, radio, and ﬁlm sources. In the mid-1930s, Siegel and Shuster also worked up a new character called Superman who was a combination strongman and civic hero. The character went through a variety of incarnations, artists, and formats. Finally rescued from the slush pile, National Al- lied Publications (a forerunner of DC Comics) bought Superman’s initial 13-page manuscript (and all subsequent rights) for $10 a page. Superman debuted in 1938’s Action Comics #1. A new comic, Superman (1939), and a syndicated newspaper strip quickly followed, both written by Siegel. Writer Jerry Siegel, who co-created Superman (ca. 1980s). Siegel was drafted in 1943 DC Comics/Photofest and, upon his return from World\n\nSIENKIEWICZ, BILL 573 War II, instigated a complicated set of lawsuits in 1946 to regain control over Superman and the new character Superboy. Siegel and Shuster settled with their employer, National Allied Publications, the primary direct forerunner of DC, over Superboy, but were also summarily ﬁred. Their last comics collaboration,“Funnyman” (1947) did not catch on. Siegel returned to write a host of un-credited Superman stories for DC dur- ing the late 1950s and 1960s. He also did limited work for Marvel Comics. Siegel worked in children’s television, was the comic director for Ziﬀ-Davis, and created (with Paul Reinman) The Mighty Crusaders for Archie Comics. He also worked on the Dis- ney Duck comics, mostly for the Italian comic, Mondadori Editore. In 1975, after a long national campaign by fellow comics creators to coincide with the ﬁrst Superman movie, Siegel and Shuster were given a pension settlement that also returned their names to the masthead of every incarnation of Superman. Siegel was married twice: ﬁrst, to Bella Lifshitz, with whom he had a son, Michael. He later married Joanne Carter, the original model for Lois Lane, and had a daughter, Laura.

Born Boleslav Felix Robert Sienkiewicz in Blakely, Pennsylvania, and growing up in New Jersey, Bill Sienkiewicz is an innovative graphic novel artist and writer. Descended from the Nobel Prize-winning Polish novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz (Quo Vadis), he started drawing when he was about four or ﬁve and has stated that he was inﬂuenced by Curt Swan and Jack Kirby. As an adult, Sien- kiewicz worked at construction sites in order to aﬀord attending the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts in Newark, New Jersey. Sienkiewicz started his comic book career doing the art for Marvel’s “Moon Knight,” which was the back-up story in the Hulk Magazine, starting with issue #13 in 1978. Moon Knight received its own series in November 1980, and Sienkiewicz did the majority of the inside art and covers for the 30-issue run. From 1984 to 1986, Sien- kiewicz established himself as a masterful cover artist when he was the primary artist on Marvel’s New Mutants written by Chris Claremont. Sienkiewicz’s impressionistic covers stood out among other superhero titles of the time, which classically depicted an action from inside the book. Instead, he simpliﬁed his ﬁgures to their iconic traits—the heroes were shadowy ﬁgures with identiﬁable characteristics. On many of his covers and in his interior pages, lines, often white, radiated from the center, conveying frenetic action as well as psychological turmoil, a trademark of his style throughout his career. In January 1986, he teamed up with writer Frank Miller to produce Marvel Graphic Novel issue #24 titled Daredevil: Love and War. Miller, after having produced the seminal Dark Knight Returns, was a great ﬁt for Sienkiewicz’s experimental art; they produced the eight-issue Elektra: Assassin (August 1986–June 1987), which pushed\n\n574 SILVER SURFER, THE the boundaries of superhero comics even further with its adult themes and political commentary. For his work on these issues, Sienkiewicz won international acclaim, receiving the 1986 Yellow Kid Award (Italy) and the 1987 Jack Kirby Award, presented by Amazing Heroes magazine. He also worked on the graphic novel, Shadowplay: The Secret Team, published in Brought to Light, with writer Alan Moore (Eclipse Comics 1988), about the history of the CIA. Sienkiewicz teamed up with Moore again in 1991 with the ambitious, but unﬁnished, series, Big Numbers; he produced art for only the ﬁrst two issues before dropping out of the project. From January 1988 to April 1989, Sienkiewicz became a writer and artist for his four-issue series, Stray Toasters (Epic Comics), which featured a detective hunting down a serial killer. Freed from the restrictions of the superhero genre, Sienkiewicz produced innovative text work and images that depicted the insanity of the killer and the world of his disturbed characters in his nonlinear narrative. Alternating splash pages with 9 and 12-panel pages, Sienkiewicz used a variety of media—from pen and ink drawings to mixed-media collages, to lush oil paintings—in order to evoke the inner chaos of his characters. Since then, Sienkiewicz has worked on a variety of titles for DC and Marvel, notably winning the 2004 Eisner Award for his contribution to Sandman: Endless Nights, written by Neil Gaiman (DC-Vertigo 2003). Sienkiewicz’s chapter, cov- ering the character Delirium, is a cornucopia of techniques, from washes, to pen drawings, overlays, photographic images, and the combination serves the storyline admirably, blending the chaos of Delirium’s mind with a pictorial delight in excess. Other notable illustration projects include the 1995 Voodoo Child: The Illustrated Legend of Jimi Hendrix (Kitchen Sink Press) and, in 1998, the children’s book, Santa, My Life and Times (Avon Books). He also took his talent to other media, producing CD covers, movie promotional art, and trading cards. Further, Sienkie- wicz has been an active character designer for television, earning two Emmy Award nominations in 1995 and 1996 for his work on Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

The Silver Surfer is a Marvel Comics character created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. He falls under the category of a “cosmic” superhero. The character has powers on a vast scale and has been criticized as diﬃcult to write for a monthly title. Generally, the character serves the genre convention of the “other” (or an outsider) used to provide an introspective perspective on a litany of human ills and social injustices.\n\nSILVER SURFER, THE 575 Doug Jones as the Silver Surfer, in the 2007 film Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, directed by Tim Story. Actor Laurence Fishburne provided the voice of the Silver Surfer. 20th Century Fox/WETA/Photofest The Silver Surfer ﬁrst appears in a three-issue sequence of Fantastic Four (known today as the“The Galactus Trilogy”) beginning with issue #48 in March 1966. Here the Silver Surfer comes to Earth, heralding the coming of Galactus, the devourer of worlds. While interacting with several characters, notably Alicia Masters, the Silver Surfer begins to feel conﬂicted between protecting what he deems as a worthy planet and his duties to Galactus. His outlook on the goodness and unlimited potential of humanity reﬂects similar humanistic progressive themes in much science ﬁction writing of the time, most notably in Gene Roddenberry’s original Star Trek. The Silver Surfer’s deﬁance of Galactus echoes Lucifer’s rebellion and subsequent exile from Heaven. Although Earth is spared, as a punishment for his transgression the Silver Surfer is exiled from the cosmos (i.e., Heaven). This exile is explored in the ﬁrst series, running from August 1968 to #18 in September 1970. In this series, the Silver Surfer undergoes trials and temptations while continuing to reﬂect on the nobil- ity of humanity despite the day-to-day bigotry and ignorance he sees. To further his Odysseus-like journey, the Surfer is feared and rejected by the majority of humans with whom he comes into contact, making his self-sacriﬁce and exile all the more bitter- sweet. This series is among Stan Lee’s most introspective work and reﬂects many of the cultural and critical challenges of the social and political issues raised in the late 1960s. The Silver Surfer wanders the Earth during his exile in the ﬁrst series, longing to return to his home planet of Zenn-La and his mate, Shalla Bal. Here, again echoing The Odyssey, as the Surfer takes on the literary and mythological conventions of exile, trials, and temptation. The Surfer stands in for the incorruptible soul, constantly tested and tempted by a gallery of villains such as Dr. Doom, Loki, and the demon Mephisto. While Doom desires the Power Cosmic from the Surfer, Loki and Mephisto are attracted to\n\n576 SIM, DAVE the challenge of breaking the Surfer’s will. As with many comics characters, the themes of willpower and moral clarity run deep in the narrative of Silver Surfer. Indeed, it is Mephisto who desperately wants to corrupt the “courage [. . .] purity [and] lack of mal- ice” exhibited by the Surfer. Here again Mephisto stands in as a tangible representation of the baser instincts of human behavior opposed to the ideals of moral clarity. Stan Lee’s Silver Surfer series also includes the origin story of the Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd is an impatient scientist/astronomer from the planet Zenn-La, which has achieved such a degree of scientiﬁc advancement that all of the wants of its inhabitants are fulﬁlled. Such a culture frustrates young Radd as “the spirit of high adventure [and] the thrill of exploration” are lost on the contented people of Zenn-La. Anti- utopian currents run throughout the origin story, as Radd’s individualism continually comes into conﬂict with the communal orientation of his advanced, seemingly utopian society. As was often the case in the Marvel comics written by Stan Lee, the aliens and monsters reﬂect aspects of human behavior, drawing obvious parallels to the social movements of the late 1960s. After the cancellation of the original series, the Silver Surfer made various appearances in other Marvel titles including Fantastic Four and Defenders. One-shots in 1978 and 1982 were followed by a continuing series in July 1987 that ran until issue #146 in November 1998, featuring the end of the Silver Surf- er’s Earth-bound exile. This series is oriented toward science ﬁction adventure, with less time given to social commentary and introspection. Various subsequent one-shot and special issues would feature the Surfer as a springboard for social commentary. Placing the Surfer in the role of a messianic ﬁgure reaches its high point in Silver Surfer: Parable, a two-part sequence written by Lee with art by Moebius, published in 1988 and 1989. In this story, addressing wide ranging themes such as religious fanati- cism; in one scene the Surfer is depicted in a cruciﬁed stance, with Lee’s script quoting “They know not what they do.” The depiction of the Silver Surfer in Parable thus takes the character away from its origins as a Lucifer deifying the destroyer God Galactus. Instead, his allegorical portrayal shifts to that of a Christlike, self-sacriﬁcing ﬁgure defending a populace that hates him; at the same time he searches for “an oasis of sanity in this desert of [human] madness” that can reclaim his faith in humanity. Although leaving little room for ambiguity, Parable is among the most signiﬁcant of Lee’s later works commenting on the overall cultural materialism, social apathy, and religious narrow-mindedness of 1980s America. D. R. Hammontree SIM, DAVE (1956–). A longtime resident of Kitchener, Ontario, Dave Sim is one of the most successful self-publishers of comic books thus far. The creative work Sim is most known for is Cerebus the Aardvark, a sprawling and often challenging series published on a regular basis from 1977 until 2004. Prior to Cerebus, Sim contributed to and published fanzines, as well as creative work, including stories for a variety of independent publishers, and even a comic strip. Cerebus evolved from Sim’s fanzine work, beginning as a sort of parody of various popular and, for the time, cutting-edge\n\nSIMON, JOE 577 productions from Marvel Comics, particularly Conan the Barbarian. Sim, along with his then-wife, Deni Loubert, established his own publishing imprint, Aardvark- Vanaheim, as a vehicle for Cerebus. Sim attracted interest in Cerebus for its high quality, his resistance to ﬁnancial support from any outside publishers, and his vow to complete 300 regularly-issued numbers of the series. He was a tireless advocate of creator ownership, particularly through the vehicle of self-publishing, which he felt allowed the individual creator the best opportunities for ﬁnancial success as well as artistic integrity. To that end, Sim published the Cerebus Guide to Self-Publishing, a collection of columns and writ- ten observations about creating and distributing comics independently. Together with his creative partner, Gerhard (who was responsible for the backgrounds), Sim also founded the Day Prize, named for his friend and mentor Gene Day, which was awarded yearly for outstanding achievements in self-publishing at the Small Press and Alternative Comics Expo (S.P.A.C.E.), held yearly in Columbus, Ohio. The prize gave critical recognition to independent creators from 2001 until 2007. In 2008, Sim withdrew from participation in the prize, which has been renamed the S.P.A.C.E. Prize. For a time, Sim assisted other creators to achieve publication. With Deni Loubert as publisher, Aardvark-Vanaheim published several other titles for a time, including Flaming Carrot Comics by Bob Burden, normalman by Jim Valentino, and Ms. Tree by Max Allan Collins and Terry Beatty. Upon their divorce, Loubert would publish most of their old titles through her own company, Renegade Press, leaving Cerebus as the sole title published by Aardvark-Vanaheim. Subsequent titles (written and illustrated by Sim) published by Aardvark-Vanaheim include Judenhass, a prestige-format title about the Holocaust, and Glamourpuss, an unusual series that at times discusses Sim’s opinions about the history of cartooning (in particular, early issues featured Sim’s recreations of later illustrations by Flash Gordon creator Alex Raymond), and at other times lampoons fashion culture. While Sim’s creative output has slowed somewhat since the end of Cerebus, he remains an important creative force in comics. Robert O’Nale SIMON, JOE (1913–). Raised in Rochester, New York, Joe Simon is one of the central ﬁgures in comic book history. After graduating high school and later working as art director for the Syracuse Journal American, Simon moved to New York City where he retouched publicity photos for Paramount Pictures and did illustrations for various magazines. In 1939 he did his ﬁrst comics work assignment for Funnies, Inc. and then created his ﬁrst comic book hero. He also did freelance stories and art for Centaur, Novelty, and Fox Publications. Working on Blue Bolt Simon met Jack Kirby and the two would soon become one of the most successful and inﬂuential teams in the comics business. After leaving Fox, Simon found himself at publisher Martin’s Timely (the future Marvel). As the company’s ﬁrst editor, Simon had a young Stan Lee as his oﬃce\n\n578 SIMONE, GAIL assistant. At Timely, Simon and Kirby created the one of the most famous comic book superheroes, Captain America in late 1940. Steve Rogers was an ordinary GI who was part of a secret Army experiment to create stronger soldiers, thus becoming Captain America. Along with his sidekick Bucky, Cap would ﬁght the Nazis even before the United States had entered into World War II. Although their highly patriotic issues sold out, Simon and Kirby disagreed with Goodman over royalties. Yet, instead of challenging him, they sought out Jack Liebowitz at National Comics who would be only too happy to oﬀer them a better deal. On hearing of this, Goodman ﬁred the team. At National, they took over the Sandman character and had hit after hit including the Boy Commandos, Newsboy Legion, and Manhunter. Simon created The Fly for Archie Comics and Stuntman, Boy Explorers, and Boys’ Ranch for Harvey Publications—this last title being his favorite collaboration with Kirby. In 1953, the Simon and Kirby team would also create what would be another one of their favorites, the Western comic, Bullseye. For Prize Publications they created an early horror comic Black Magic and are also credited with creating the entire romance genre of comics with Young Romance Comics in 1947. As the industry fell into a sharp decline in the mid 1950’s, Simon focused more on commercial art, but also helped oversee many of the kid-friendly comics put out by Harvey Comics. In 1960, the business-savvy Simon created Sick Magazine, which com- peted favorably against Mad. The Simon and Kirby partnership ended in 1955, but they would come together over the years to work on updating old characters or creating new ones. Their last collaboration was in 1974 when Simon wrote the ﬁrst issue of a new Sandman for DC. Sixty-six years after his co-creation of Captain America, Simon commented: “We were movie directors, script men, penciler, colorers, inkers . . . we had dirty hands.” Simon did it all and in doing so his creative force directly shaped the American comic book industry almost from its inception. Selected Bibliography: Simon, Joe, and Jim Simon. The Comic Book Makers. Lakewood, NJ: Vanguard, 2003. Jeﬀ McLaughlin SIMONE, GAIL (1974?–). In 1999, Gail Simone, a hairdresser and comics fan in her native Oregon, compiled a list of women characters in comics who had been raped, crippled, depowered, magically impregnated (without consent and therefore a form of rape), turned evil, given a life-threatening disease, or murdered. Because of extended continuity—made necessary by the longevity of medium—these characters were often subject to a combination of these atrocities. This trend, Simone observed, became known as “Women in Refrigerators”—after the particularly gruesome demise of the Green Lantern’s girlfriend, Alexandra DeWitt—who was murdered and stuﬀed in a refrigerator. The list was sent to several comics creators, along with a letter, asking for\n\nSIMONSON, WALTER (WALT) 579 their thoughts. Simone went on to write a weekly column called“You’ll All Be Sorry” for the Web site Comic Book Resources (1999–2003). She later began scripting Simpsons comics for Bongo. Marvel Comics’ Joe Quesada suggested Simone pitch for the title Deadpool which was later revamped as Agent X. Simone left Marvel over creative diﬀerences and began work at DC Comics where she wrote for various titles, including Action Comics, and a Rose and Thorn limited series (2004). Simone also wrote Killer Princesses for Oni Press with co-creator and artist Lea Hernandez. In 2003, Simone took over DC’s Birds of Prey title (formerly written by Chuck Dixon) with issue #56 and added Helena Bertinelli/Huntress to the line-up of Barbara Gordon/Oracle and Dinah Lance/Black Canary. Under her direction, Birds of Prey became one of DC’s steadiest selling and most critically acclaimed books. Simone’s success as a comic book writer, as well as her enjoyment of it, led her to give up hair- dressing to focus on writing full-time. In 2006, she was the writer for a limited series of The Secret Six, a DC superhero team that originated in the Silver Age. In 2007, she took over writing duties on Wonder Woman with Issue #14. Additionally, Simone’s commitment to creating diverse casts of characters led her to win a Glyph Comics Award for Best Female Character in Thomasina Lindo—one of the lead characters in Welcome to Tranquility—a creator-owned comic published by WildStorm. Simone has also worked on a reboot of Gen for WildStorm and All-New Atom for DC. She has also done work in scripting for television and ﬁlms based on comics. She wrote an episode of Justice League Unlimited and early drafts of the Wonder Woman animated direct-to- DVD feature ﬁlm that was released in 2009.

Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, comic book writer and artist Walter Simonson graduated from Rhode Island School of Design in 1972. His thesis project Star Slammers would serve as his ﬁrst portfolio and would later form the basis for a graphic novel and a miniseries. His widely recognizable signature in the shape of a brontosaurus reﬂects his early interest in paleontology. Although he started in the industry illustrating war comics for DC Comics and other companies, Simonson’s big break actually came from writer Archie Goodwin, who invited him to draw Manhunter in 1973, which ran in the back of Detective Comics. Simonson’s four-year stay with DC also included reviving the Metal Men. At Marvel Comics, Simonson did a number of comic book movie adaptations including Battlestar Galactica, and Star Wars, and worked on X-Factor with his wife, writer Louise Simonson. He is best known for taking over The Mighty Thor in 1983 and creating story arcs that raised the level of the book to that of its earlier Stan Lee/\n\n580 SIN CITY Jack Kirby days. Although Simonson injected a ﬁne mixture of science ﬁction and mythology, fans typically remember two events during his approximately four years on the series. First, turning Thor into a frog for three issues (an homage to Simonson’s favorite comic book writer and artist as a boy: Carl Barks) and second, the introduc- tion of Beta Ray Bill, an alien who became only the second individual (at the time) deemed worthy enough to pick up Thor’s hammer Mjolnir. In late 1989, Simonson became writer and artist on The Fantastic Four. His year-and-a-half tenure included the memorable nonlinear presentation of a ﬁght between Dr. Doom and Reed Richards that required the reader to read the issue twice. Simonson enjoyed working in the shared-universe concept where the various characters moved between diﬀerent books, thereby creating complex back stories; thus he wrote and/or drew many characters for both Marvel and DC Comics including the Avengers, The Hulk, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Dr. Fate. This shared-universe concept was also part of publisher Malibu’s Bravura line of creator-owned comics, which Simonson joined brieﬂy before the company was bought out by Marvel. As a fan of Jack Kirby’s Fourth World mythos, Simonson was excited to bring back the character Orion for DC for a run that lasted 25 issues. Simonson also illus- trated Michael Moorcock’s miniseries Elric: The Making of a Sorcerer. Simonson had no preference for drawing covers or interiors as he found they oﬀered diﬀerent artistic challenges. When once asked which was more important in comics, writing or drawing, he responded that the question was like asking“Which is more important, breathing air or drinking water?” Simonson’s illustration inﬂuences include Moebius, Jim Holdaway, Frank Bellamy, Sergio Toppi and various Silver Age Marvel artists. His writing inﬂuences include J.R.R. Tolkien, numerous science-ﬁction writers, his friend Archie Goodwin, and wife Louise Simonson. A legendary talent, Simonson nevertheless remains an open-minded artist—willing and wanting to learn from anyone and anything. Jeﬀ McLaughlin SIN CITY. The title refers to a variety of story arcs occurring in the same environment written and drawn by Frank Miller, who is renowned for his take on Batman in The Dark Knight Returns. The ﬁrst Sin City story was published in Dark Horse Comics Presents Fifth Anniversary Special (1991) and then continued in the anthology Dark Horse Presents #51-62 (1991–92). These stories were later collected in graphic novel form and expanded along the years with more single issues and book collections com- ing along. There is no main protagonist in Sin City, but several characters appear regu- larly throughout the narrative threads (or “yarns” as they are referred to) as they weave in and out among each other. The individual yarns usually follow a central character but the stories are thoroughly intertwined and can be puzzled into a grand Sin City narrative chronology. Sin City is the nickname of the ﬁctional Basin City—the setting in or around which the stories take place. The diﬀerent parts of town act as the framing structure for the stories as they move from the rich neighborhood of Sacred Oaks to the\n\nSIN CITY 581 worn-down projects, and city landmarks help anchor the fast-paced plot lines in areas like the surreal Tar Pits of the closed down amusement park and the fenced evil of The Farm. Old Town is a city within the city populated by prostitutes; as long as a fragile truce is kept, the mob and police leave the women of Old Town to carry out their own justice. Basin City has a very high frequency of violence and crime and is controlled by corrupt politicians, the mob, and various crime lords using hitmen as go-betweens. The police force is part SWAT team members and part regular cops, most of whom are in the pocket of one or the other powerful criminals. Miller uses an immediately recogniz- able style where great emphasis is put on the eﬀects of light and shadow, using black and white to outline bodies, light up faces and keep things hidden in the dark. Contrasts between black and white shape the characters as black patches of ink are criss-crossed by falling white rain, and silhouettes in white or black take up big parts of the page design—their bodies striped by the light coming through numerous Venetian blinds. Grey tones are not an option in the visual execution of Sin City, but on rare occasion Miller uses a primary color for eﬀect: a red dress, blue eyes or the yellow body of a vile villain known as the Yellow Bastard. The only exception to this black/white scenario is a passage in the volume Hell and Back where the drug- overdosed mind of the pro- tagonist is reﬂected in a water-colored section featuring a wide variety of monsters and intertextual references to other comics. With the exception of Family Values, all the Sin City volumes were ﬁrst published as single issues. The Hard Goodbye (original title: Sin City) ﬁrst collected in 1992, features Marv—a chivalrous but primitive muscle-man. After having spent a night with the beautiful Goldie just to wake and ﬁnd her murdered in a way clearly intended to frame him for the crime, Marv swears revenge and starts killing his way through the people involved in her death. Original comic panel of Nancy and Hartigan from Frank Miller’s graphic novel Sin City. Dimension Films/Photofest\n\n582 SIN CITY In A Dame to Kill for (1994) the photographer Dwight gets framed by his devious ex-girlfriend Ava Lord. Enlisting the help of Marv and the women of Old Town he is able to make Ava pay for her deeds and get his revenge. The Big Fat Kill (1996) ﬁnds Dwight in yet another precarious situation when he has to help cover up the murder of a crooked cop named Jack who was killed by the girls of Old Town. Both the mob and the police would love to take over Old Town and Jack’s murder could be their chance. The ﬁnal showdown refers to the battle of Thermopylae—a story Miller would later go on to elaborate in the graphic novel 300. The main antagonist in That Yellow Bastard (1997) embodies all meanings of the word yellow. He preys on little girls and is maimed by the policeman Hartigan in an eﬀort to save 11-year old Nancy Callahan from rape and murder. Eight years later he wants to get his hands on Nancy and Hartigan has to ﬁght him again. Once more Dwight is the main character in Family Values (1997), where he has been sent on a mission by the girls of Old Town. With him is deadly ninjette assassin Miho and their target mob family is made to understand that family can expand beyond blood relations. A collection of small stories with the characters from Sin City is put together in Booze, Broads, and Bullets (1998). Saving a girl from committing sui- cide takes ex-Navy Seal Wallace to Hell and Back (A Sin City Love Story)(2000) as he has to ﬁght powerful moneyman Wallenquist to free the mysterious woman. Sin City is a revision of the clas- sic noir crime comics bordering on pastiche but deﬁnitely an hom- age to a kind of comics the Comics Code helped obliterate. The set- ting is dark, the violence is graphic, and the heroes are men of action most often in pursuit of danger- ous dames or damsels in distress. This central plot is underlined by the many close-ups of determined male faces and the repetition of silent, full-page images of scantily clad women. Sympathy is on the side of the lone avenger or the few and supposedly powerless against the many and powerful. No matter how hard the rain falls, how hope- less the situation seems or how Benicio Del Toro as Jack Rafferty, in the 2005 film Sin City, black the night is, in Sin City there directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. Dimension is always a way out for those who Films/Photofest choose to ﬁght.\n\nSPAWN 583 Sin City was made into a movie in 2005 directed by Robert Rodriguez and co-directed by Miller himself. In the making are Sin City 2 and Sin City 3, scheduled for release 2010 and 2011. Rikke Platz Cortsen SPAWN. Created by Todd McFarlane, Spawn made his ﬁrst appearance in May, 1992, in the ﬁrst issue of the comic book that bears his name. Spawn was one of the original creations from Image Comics, of which McFarlane was one of the co-founders. The central ﬁgure in Spawn is Albert“Al” Francis Simmons, a Detroit-born African American CIA agent whose boss, Jason Wynn, orders him assassinated. Simmons is sent to Hell because of his status as a mercenary. In Hell, Simmons, motivated by a desire to see his wife Wanda once more, unwisely strikes a deal with Malebolgia, a powerful lord, and returns to Earth as a Hellspawn, an oﬃcer in Hell’s army. His memory in tatters and his body misshapen beyond recognition, Spawn re-enters the world in a state of stupefaction. Once on Earth, he soon discovers that ﬁve years have passed since his death, and that his wife Wanda Blake has since married his friend Terry Fitzgerald, their union yielding a daughter named Cyan. Spawn was represented as a rather conventional crime-ﬁghting anti-hero in the initial issues. His most signiﬁ- cant encounters are with Anti-Spawn, or the Redeemer, who is later revealed to be Jason Wynn, and Angela, who was, like Cogliostro, created by Neil Gaiman in issue #9 of Spawn. Both the Redeemer and Angela were heavenly agents meant to counter Spawn, although Angela eventually comes to assist Spawn several times. Following Spawn’s encounter with the Redeemer, his suit, a crucial source of his power, undergoes a signiﬁcant change (the ﬁrst of many), becoming more powerful in the process. The suit is symbiotic and connected to his body and its nervous system; it is nourished by necroplasm, the hellish substance out of which Spawn was created. Spawn’s necroplasmic power is limited, and its complete exhaustion would lead to eternal suﬀering in Hell. Spawn, given his origins, functions within a good-evil dichotomy, represented in the early issues by, respectively, an old man named Cagliostro and the clown-like Violator, Malebolgia’s earthly agent. That initial dichotomy is complicated by the introduction of an alternative realm to Hell and Heaven through the Heap. The Heap is a monstrous ﬁgure that formed when a man named Eddie Beckett inadvertently came into contact with necroplasm, leading to a merging of his body with the surrounding garbage. Spawn’s battles with the Heap result in the latter swallowing the former, transporting Spawn to Greenworld, a kind of natural Purgatory independent of Hell and Heaven. Spawn employs the powers accorded to him by the forces of that realm to defeat Urizen, a god released by Malebolgia in a failed attempt to assume control of all of Hell. Spawn, accompanied by Angela, enters Hell and destroys the weakened Male- bolgia. He is then oﬀered Malebolgia’s place by Mammon, and after initially refusing it, decides to accept it in order to transform Hell into a paradisiacal realm. His plans are, however, thwarted by Cagliostro, who betrays Spawn, assumes control of Hell for\n\n584 SPAWN himself, and reveals himself as the Biblical Cain. Cagliostro returns Spawn to Earth seemingly trans- formed back to his original form as Al Simmons. Simmons does not remain in that state for long, however, and is able to transform himself into Spawn again with the help of a witch named Nyx. He assumes a position strikingly similar to his original one, with Mammon replacing Malebol- gia as the chief adversary. Spawn later ﬁnds himself at the center of Armageddon, where he rises to be- come as powerful as God and Satan (re-imagined as warring children of a more powerful ﬁgure named the Mother).Spawn destroys the armies of Hell and Heaven as well as all of humanity, and subsequently creates a new Earth with the sanction of the Mother. He asks the Mother to return him to Earth as Al Simmons Michael Jai White as Spawn, in the 1997 film by the same thereafter. name, directed by Mark A. Z. Dippé. Photofest/New Line Subsequent episodes in the Cinema Spawn narrative take a decidedly domestic turn, with Spawn’s fam- ily relations and Mammon’s long-time involvement in his life since early childhood taking precedence. The convoluted family history essentially centers on Mammon’s intentions to create the ultimate Hellspawn, originally meant to be Al Simmons but afterwards his child Morana, whom Wanda miscarried after she was beaten by Sim- mons just prior to his death. Mammon’s plans are foiled by the clairvoyant Cyan, who in cooperation with Nyx destroys Morana. From the very beginning, the sense of uncertainty regarding Spawn’s identity and past forms a central theme in the comic. In issue #2 of Spawn, for example, Spawn attempts to use his powers to assume a human shape, only to ﬁnd that he has assumed the body of a blonde, white man. The issue of Simmons/Spawn’s race is of striking interest given the dearth of main characters in comics that are African American. The matter has been addressed directly in the comic several times, nowhere as visibly as in Spawn #30, where Spawn, returning to the world after a sojourn in Heaven, ﬁnds himself in the U.S. South confronting the KKK while trying to protect an African\n\nSPEEDING BULLETS 585 American family. He is shot in the head by the Klan members and then hanged, though he lives to exact revenge on them. Religion forms another signiﬁcant and consistent element in the comic, with Judeo-Christian mythology forming the basis for the comic’s worldview. The resur- rected Spawn, for example, has clear if somewhat antithetical predecessors in Lazarus and Christ. As well, the apocalyptic elements in the comic owe a great deal to The Book of Revelation, while the geography of Hell was clearly inspired by Dante’s Inferno. Spawn remained popular for much of the 1990s, and even starred in a feature ﬁlm in 1997. Although his popularity has waned considerably since then, Spawn still remains a notable ﬁgure in comics. There have been several spin-oﬀs, among them Curse of the Spawn, Angela, Sam & Twitch, a special featuring Spawn alongside Batman, and a manga titled Shadows of Spawn. The character’s main narrative, however, is still found in the Spawn comic book, whose issues trace the myriad transformations that the character has undergone and continues to undergo. Denis Yarow SPEEDING BULLETS. A 52-page graphic novel written by J. M. DeMatteis and illus- trated by Eduardo Barreto that was published in 1993 by DC Comics as part of its prestige Elseworlds line, Speeding Bullets won the Comic Buyer’s Guide Fan Award for “Favorite Original Graphic Novel or Album of 1993.” The premise of the story is based upon an amalgamation of the Superman and Batman myths: What would happen if the Kryptonian rocket ship that carried baby Kal-El to Earth had been discovered not by Jonathan and Martha Kent of Smallville, Kansas, but rather by Dr. and Mrs. Thomas Wayne of Gotham City? Superman and Batman have had a long history of joining forces ever since the pair ﬁrst discovered each other’s secret identities and teamed-up in Superman #76 (May–June 1952). Beginning in 1954 with World’s Finest Comics #71, the heroes regularly worked together in that title until its cancellation in 1986. The Man of Steel and the Caped Crusader were also seen together in a number of “Imaginary Stories” published by DC Comics over the years. As with the Elseworlds tales, the “Imagi- nary Stories” were not restricted by DC Comics canon. There are several notable Imaginary Stories from both the Silver Age and Bronze Age of comics history that combined Superman and Batman’s supporting casts, villains, settings, and plotlines. World’s Finest #136 (September 1963) contained a story titled “The Batman Nobody Remembered” which showcased a parallel universe where Superman is secretly Bruce Wayne and Batman never existed. World’s Finest #167 ( June 1967) presented “The New Superman-Batman Team!” in which baby Kal-El grows up powerless after his exposure to a gold Kryptonite meteor. Instead, Lex Luthor uses science to gain super- powers so he can become Superman. Batman is later revealed to be Clark’s wealthy uncle Kendall, who is unaware of his Kryptonian heritage. A third interesting story is titled “Superman and Batman—Brothers!” and it appeared in World’s Finest #172 (December 1967). In that tale, Bruce Wayne is adopted by the Kents after his parents\n\n586 SPEEDING BULLETS are murdered. The kindly farm couple takes the sullen boy into their home so that their son Clark can have a brother.Together the boys ﬁght crime in Smallville. By the end of this imaginary adventure, Batman joins the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th cen- tury, while Superman continues his never-ending battle against evil in the 20th century. In Superman #353 (November 1980) DC Comics began a short-lived backup series featuring the exploits of “Bruce (Superman) Wayne.” In this alternative reality, baby Kal-El is discovered by James Gordon, who gives him to the Waynes. Bruce Wayne grows up to become Superman and later marries Barbara Gordon (Batwoman). One of the most unique amalgamations of the characters debuted in World’s Finest #142 ( June 1964); the composite Superman was a grotesque shapeshifting villain with green skin who formed a costume that was half Superman’s and half Batman’s. This rogue returned several times but was always soon defeated by the heroes. Speeding Bullets continues the tradition of recreating the Superman legend by infusing it with elements from Batman’s history. The graphic novel begins with the destruction of Krypton and the arrival of Kal-El’s rocket on Earth. Instead of the Kents arriving at the crash site in their old pickup truck, the alien child is discov- ered by the Waynes who are being chauﬀeured by their butler Alfred. They name the boy Bruce and raise him to be cultured, respectful, and intelligent. As in DC Comics’ established history, tragedy strikes years later as the Wayne family emerges from a theater when they encounter a hoodlum named Joe Chill. The thief brutally murders the elder Waynes during a robbery attempt. As young Bruce Wayne tearfully stares at his parents’ killer, heat beams suddenly blast from his eyes and incinerate the murderer. The trauma of that night’s events causes him to forget his unearthly abilities until years later when Alfred is threatened by a burglar. Bruce saves his faithful butler and begins to fully remember the facts surrounding his parents deaths. He soon dis- covers Thomas Wayne’s journals relating how they found their son in the rocket ship. Again, as in the long-established DC canon, Bruce Wayne becomes the crimeﬁghter Batman, although this Dark Knight is super-strong and can ﬂy. Other elements of the Superman and Batman histories are incorporated into Speed- ing Bullets as Bruce Wayne purchases the Gotham Gazette newspaper and hires editor Perry White and journalist Lois Lane. To protect his secret identity from Lois he pre- tends to be a shy, stuttering, klutz. Like the story’s hero, the villain is a combination of Superman and Batman adversaries. Lex Luthor is presented as a ruthless billionaire, as had been established by John Byrne’s continuity revamp of the character during the 1980s. However, this Luthor harbors a dark secret. An earlier accident in a chemical plant had transformed him into the Joker. He also employs a lethal umbrella in the man- ner of the Penguin, another traditional Batman nemesis. Batman defeats the Joker in a violent encounter. Eventually, Lois convinces Batman that he could be an even greater hero if he abandoned Batman’s darkness and instead became a symbol of hope. The story concludes with Bruce Wayne adopting a new costumed identity—Superman. Speeding Bullets was one of several Elseworlds graphic novels that either combined the Superman and Batman legends in unique ways or placed the Man of Steel in\n\nSPIDER-MAN 587 new settings, such as medieval England, Soviet Russia, or Hollywood in the 1920s. Elseworlds stories provided interesting new perspectives on popular heroes and Speeding Bullets showcases the elements that have allowed both Superman and Batman to become enduring comic book icons. Charles Coletta SPIDER-MAN. Created in 1962 by illustrator/plotter Steve Ditko and writer Stan Lee with input from Jack Kirby, Spider-Man is arguably the most popular comic book superhero and certainly the most popular character of Marvel Comics. First appearing in the ﬁnal issue of the science ﬁction and fantasy anthology comic book series, Amazing Fantasy #15, Spider-Man has appeared in several eponymous (and non-eponymous) comic book titles over 45 years, most centrally in The Amazing Spider-Man—ﬁrst published in March 1963 and in continuous publication since. In addition to the issues produced by the initial creators, a particularly successful run of this title began in 1988, when artist Todd McFarlane joined writer David Michelinie beginning with issue #298. McFarlane also helped create the wildly popular villain Venom, an alien symbiote that can take over the bodies of humans, including, at one point, Spider-Man himself. In 2000, Marvel introduced Ultimate Spider-Man, written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by Mark Bagley, to reboot the Spider-Man story for a newer audience. Spider-Man has appeared in several other media, such as animated and live-action television programs, toys, electronic games and live-action blockbuster ﬁlms. Indeed, the ﬁlms, Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004), Spider- Man 3 (2007), and Spider-Man 4 (due in 2011), directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, constitute one of the most commercially success- ful franchises in movie history. Peter Parker is an orphan being raised by his loving Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Upon being bitten by an irradiated spider at a science demonstration, the unpopu- lar high school student ﬁnds himself acquiring spider-like powers: the proportionate strength, speed, and agility of a spider, the ability to stick to nearly any surface, and an uncanny “spider-sense” that senses impending danger. The bright science student invents a “web ﬂuid” that mimics the strength and stickiness of spider webbing, as well as wrist-mounted web-shooters. Designing the now-iconic blue and red costume with superimposed web patterns, and a mask with large white eyepieces, Peter is ready to face the world as Spider-Man. Rather than using his powers for the greater good, Spider-Man at ﬁrst appears on television variety shows to earn money. After one such appearance at a studio, Spider-Man fails to stop an escaping burglar, who kills Peter’s beloved Uncle Ben later that day. Realizing that his self-interested inaction resulted in the death of his uncle, Peter realizes that “with great power there must also come— great responsibility!” Spider-Man’s debut story repeated many of the themes common in Amazing Fantasy and other comic books of the early 1960s, most notably the moralizing twist- ending and the anxiety over nuclear technology. Whereas in other stories the person\n\n588 SPIDER-MAN who made the mistake would be held accountable for it, in this story the martyr- dom of Uncle Ben establishes the moral. Moreover, the changes brought about by the irradiated spider and Peter’s realization of responsibility can also be seen to stand in for puberty and the ways in which a teenager transitions to adulthood. Indeed, the inter- action between Spider-Man using his powers responsibly and Peter Parker attempting to adapt to his often rapidly changing personal circumstances—and the ways in which one aspect of his life inﬂuences or interferes with the other—has come to character- ize the essence of Spider-Man comics. For instance, a blood transfusion from Peter to Aunt May results in her becoming ill from radiation. The serum necessary for the cure is hijacked by the nefarious Doctor Octopus, and it is up to Spider-Man to ﬁnd it. In one of the most iconic sequences of Ditko’s art, a trapped Spider-Man frees himself from under tremendously heavy wreckage to reach the serum and save his aunt—all of this just before Peter is set to begin college. As if the death of Uncle Ben was not enough, Spider-Man is often involved in the deaths of many others close to Peter Parker, and many of Spider-Man’s most trenchant villains are linked to his private identity. Retired police captain George Stacy is killed when he saves the life of a child standing under falling debris from Spider- Man’s battle against Doctor Octo- pus. Stacy’s daughter, Gwen, Peter’s girlfriend, is later killed during Spider-Man’s battle with the Green Goblin. Meanwhile, the Goblin is actually Norman Osborn, the fa- ther of Peter’s best friend, Harry. Although Norman Osborn had al- ready been a manipulative tycoon, a chemical accident turns him into a super-powered villain and contrib- utes to his mental degeneration. Osborn never tires of torturing Peter/Spider-Man, for instance kidnapping his and wife Mary Jane Watson’s baby, presumably mur- dering her. Being situated in contemporary contexts, Spider-Man comics have always dealt with social issues. The Amazing Spider-Man issue #19, published in Decem- Spider-Man comics in the 1960s ber 1964. Marvel Comics Group/Photofest and 1970s depict college protests\n\nSPIEGELMAN, ART 589 and city politics, in which Peter is loath to get involved. A story arc in 1971 features Harry Osborn’s addiction to drugs, whereas a 1982 single-issue questions the preva- lence of guns in America. In 1974, Spider-Man teams up with The Punisher to ﬁght the Tarantula, an operative of a repressive government in Latin America. While beating on the villain, Spidey delivers a speech in which he eﬀectively aligns himself with revo- lutionaries ﬁghting tyranny. The most sustained examination of Spider-Man’s role in social realities comes during writer J. Michael Straczynski’s tenure in the 2000s. Sepa- rated from his wife, Peter returns to his high school to realize that the neighborhood has changed for the worse. He becomes a teacher and attempts to counsel students who might otherwise get into trouble. Spider-Man recognizes that he has never paid atten- tion to the problems of street youth and the homeless, and a reformed thug questions why he only deals with things after they go wrong rather than trying to prevent them from going wrong. Peter Parker’s private life also becomes more complex as Aunt May learns of his secret identity and he restarts his relationship with Mary Jane, while joining the New Avengers. In the Civil War storyline (2006), Spider-Man unmasks to the world as Peter Parker in support of superhero registration, which he later realizes is a mistake. As a result, May is shot by a sniper sent by a villain and, in a coma, is on the verge of dying. Peter and Mary Jane make a deal with the devil (Mephisto) to keep May alive. The resultant resetting of the Spider-Man storyline means that Peter and Mary Jane had never married in the ﬁrst place and Harry Osborn, long dead, somehow comes back to life, while Spider-Man’s unmasking has been erased from collective memory. Peter is once again a bachelor, with a doting aunt, far removed from introspection about his role in society—other than knocking heads together in a superﬁcial fulﬁllment of the dictum that great power entails great responsibility. Noaman G. Ali SPIEGELMAN, ART (1948–). An artist and writer whose work has done much to bring critical respect to comics and graphic novels, Spiegelman was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He emigrated with his parents, Vladek and Anya (Zylberberg) Spiegelman, to Norristown, Pennsylvania before settling in the Rego Park neighborhood of Queens, New York. Geographical transience and the importance of place in establishing one’s identity have remained consistent themes in his work, particularly Maus: A Survivor’s Tale (1986, 1991) and In the Shadow of No Towers (2004). He began drawing comics at an early age, publishing his ﬁrst drawing at age 13 before becoming a student at Manhat- tan’s High School of Art and Design. While doing freelance work for a small newspaper in Queens, he met Woody Gelman, art director of the Topps Chewing Gum Company, who would become a life-long mentor and friend. After graduation from the School of Art and Design, he attended Harpur College (now SUNY-Binghamton), where he worked as a cartoonist for the college newspaper and edited a humor magazine. In the summer of 1966, he became a creative consultant for Topps and began publishing his own underground comics work in such venues as the East Village Other.\n\n590 SPIEGELMAN, ART Tensions between independent artistryandthedemandsof commer- cial fame characterized Spiegelman’s professional life, even as he drew upon such precedents as Harvey Kurtzman’s MAD magazine and Robert Crumb. A hospitalization for mental illness and his mother’s suicide ended Spiegelman’s time at Harpur in 1968. After a few years spent cartooning for men’s magazines, he moved to San Fran- cisco, where he published in Gothic Blimp Works, Funny Animals, and Young Lust, and co-edited Short Order Comix and Whole Grains. In 1975, he moved back to New York City, where he began co- editing Arcade magazine, married Françoise Mouly, and published a collection of his experimental comics in Breakdowns (1977; re- Art Spiegelman with wife and collaborator Françoise Mouly published 2008). He and Mouly (2000). Photofest began the groundbreaking maga- zine RAW, which assembled a vari- ety of graphic projects. At the same time, however, Spiegelman continued to work for Topps and began teaching at New York’s School of Visual Arts. RAW serialized Maus, an exploration of his parents’ Holocaust ex- periences and his own life as a second-generation survivor, for several issues before its two volumes, My Father Bleeds History and And Here My Troubles Began, were published. He ended his career with Topps in 1989, as the second volume of Maus was underway. The publication of Maus marked both Spiegelman’s emergence as a critically recognized artist and a widespread acceptance of graphic novels as serious literature. Particularly after receiving a special Pulitzer Prize in 1992 for the two volumes, he found himself at the center of a maelstrom of media attention and scholarly analysis. The book’s success helped him to promote comics’ visibility, a long-term goal, and gar- nered him signiﬁcant acclaim. His black-on-black portrait of the missing Twin Towers for the New Yorker’s 9/11 cover was included in the American Society of Magazine Editors’ 2005 list of “Top 40 Magazine Covers;” the image also appeared on the cover of In the Shadow of No Towers, his autobiographical study of both the devastation of New York City and its history in comics. His public commentaries on world events continue to generate controversy and esteem.\n\nSPIRIT, THE 591 Selected Bibliography: Spiegelman, Art. Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*!

A comic book feature regularly produced by Will Eisner and his studio be- tween 1940 and 1952, The Spirit was the lead feature in a comic book supplement licensed to newspapers by the Des Moines Register and Tribune syndicate. During its best periods, before and for several years after the artist’s military service in World War II, Eisner was primarily responsible for the feature, writing and drawing, and closely collaborating with assistants to create the book. The eponymous hero of the series is a detective hero, Denny Colt, who is declared dead after a gas attack by criminal mastermind the Cobra. Colt is buried at Wildwood Cemetery, which subsequently becomes the Spirit’s headquarters. The Spirit section, usually titled The Comic Book Supplement, was created for news- paper editors worried about the competition from the new medium of the comic book, particularly after the success of Superman.
