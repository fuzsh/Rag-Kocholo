        "text": "It is her fairy stories that are credited with changing people’s lives. It is her novels for which her prose gets most praise. Angela Carter refashioned the docility of fairytale heroines – Sleeping Beauty, she observed, did not have much “get up and go” – and invented creatures who were wild and wilful.\n\nShe gave fictional prose a good going-over with her rich swerves between fantasy and realism. Yet it is her journalism, collected in the 1997 volume Shaking a Leg, to which I find myself returning again and again, struck freshly by its forthrightness, its imagination, its unpredictability – and by the sheer range of subjects on which she was fluent."
