The core study of TechnoFeminism gives voice to the mutual relationship between women and technology that is a constructivist and a sociotechnical network by rejecting technological determinism. Likewise, TechnoFeminist Science Fiction, a new trend in women or feminist science fiction, provides both technoscientific politics and TechnoFeminist politics in desire for women or feminist science fiction writers to be more active in creating female cyber and cyborg images in their technoscience fictions. Thus, it aims to create new women perspectives and point of views by erasing the gender duality problem with characterization of emancipatory cyberself and cyborg embodiment through breaking down the boundaries between human and machine, animal/organism and machine, and physical and non-physical organisms. The aim of this study is to demonstrate how British novelists, Justina Robson and Sue Thomas, have opened a different technodigital space for equal and mutual relationship between gender and technology by weaving the issues of TechnoFeminism and the concepts of technoscience, AIs, genetic technologies, the internet, regenerative technologies, communication technologies, nanotechnology, biotechnology, molecular biology and they have also developed an image of the cyborg consistent with any of Haraway’s cyborg metaphors and cyberspace consistent with Plant’s cyberfeminism with wired, wet, fluid, flexible, adaptable, mutable, multiple, ever-flowing, unstable, self-controlled, virtual cyberselves.\n\nSümeyra Buran Assistant Professor, PhD Atatürk University, Erzurum\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

She has offered her unreserved help and guidance. I am very grateful to her for her scientific advice and knowledge and acknowledge the patience for insightful comments, discussions, editing and suggestions about the research. I feel deeply honoured in expressing my sincere thanks to Sue Thomas for attending my Ph. D. viva live online connecting via video conferencing through Skype. I am also grateful to her for giving generously of her time to be interviewed on “TechnoFeminist approach and Correspondence” conducted on March 19, 2013 at her office at De Montfort University in Leicester, and for welcoming and hosting me in a very kind manner. I would also like to thank Christopher Lewis, who is studying anthropology and religious studies at the University of Groningen in the faculty of Theology and Religious Studies, for taking time to meet me for his valuable suggestions and academic directions and particularly his comments on religious/Biblical concept related to cyborg metaphor in the third part of the book. I would like thank all the present professors, lecturers and colleagues in the department of English Language and Literature at Atatürk University. I would like to thank and acknowledge the people who have made it possible for me to complete this project. Last but not the least; I am grateful to my family members, especially to my sister for her support and taking care of my son during my long writing process. I would especially like to thank my five-year-old son, Kaan Yılmaz, for his love and support and for understanding and waiting for me in patience to finish the project.\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

TechnoFeminist Science Fiction aims at showing the stories of technowoman and their technoworld. Those eager to read more TechnoFeminist Science Fiction writers may be disappointed to discover there is no recommended reading list in this book because there is not any anthologization of the works of women (and men) who wrote TechnoFeminist Science Fiction texts in the New Millennium, and there is not even enough attention to the field by women writers. Until such time when TechnoFeminist Science Fiction writers increase and enough attention are paid, we can offer this sampler of novels by those not last but the pioneer TechnoFeminist Science Fiction writers.\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

All rights reserved.\n\nHISTORY OF SCIENCE FICTION Science fiction has been one of the great leading literary successes since the second half of the twentieth century. Nowadays, the genre is associated with America, but “the origins and inspirations for science fiction lie outside the United States, though within the period of the Industrial Revolution.”1 The term science fiction did not emerge until the 1930s and “could only have come to prominence in the twentieth century, with its sweeping social changes and its unveiling of the promises and threats of modern technology.”2 It was Hugo Gernsback who invented the term “scientifiction” in order to characterize the contents of stories published in Amazing Stories (one of the magazines he edited) in 1926. Then, the term “came to be recognized as a distinct literary genre, largely because it had so insistently ‘arrived’ as a social phenomenon. Sociologists, psychologists, historians of ideas, and political scientists began to turn to it on the assumptions that it was an important aspect of the ‘signs of the times’.”3 Our endeavor here will find this assumption to be correct and will explore the relationship between science fiction and contemporary feminism. According to science fiction historian Brian M. Stableford, the first definition was made in A Little Earnest Book Upon a Great Old Subject (1851) by British Poet William Wilson. The only example for the new genre Wilson could find was Richard Henry Horne’s fable The Poor Artist (1850), which deals with the discovery of creatures’ eyesight.4 Wilson cites the saying of Scottish poet Thomas Campbell that “Fiction in poetry is not the reverse of truth, but her soft and enchanting resemblance” and then, Wilson comments that “Now this applies especially to Science-Fiction, in which the revealed truths of Science may be given interwoven with a 1\n\nBrian Aldiss with David Wingrove, Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction, Paladin Grafton Books, A Division of the Collins Publishing Group, London 1988, 14.

For example, Kingsley Amis defines the term as a “prose narrative treating of a situation that could not arise in the world we know, but which is hypothesized on the basis of some innovation in science or technology, or pseudo-science or pseudotechnology, whether human or extra-terrestrial in origin.”7 On the other side, Joanna Russ, as a science fiction writer and critic, states that science fiction is “a mode rather than a form (a form would be something like the sonnet, the short story, etc.). It is, basically, anything that is about conditions of life or existence different from either what typically is, or what typically was, or whatever was or is . . . Science fiction is about the possible-but-not-real.”8 However, Brian W. Aldiss with David Wingrove assert that science fiction is “both formulaic and something more than a genre. It is a mode which easily falls back into genre. The model is flexible, changing with the times. New designs are forever produced.”9 Farah Mendlesohn also regards the term as “a discussion or a mode, and not a genre” by differentiating the term from other forms: “If sf [science fiction] were a genre, we would know the rough outline of every book that we picked up. If it were a mystery, we would know that there was ‘something to be found out’; if a romance, that two people would meet, make conflict and fall in love; if horror, that there would be an intrusion of the unnatural into the world that would eventually be tamed or destroyed.”10 That is, science fiction is regarded as “less a genre – a body of writing from which one can expect certain plot elements and specific 5\n\nWilliam Wilson, A Little Earnest Book Upon A Great Old Subject, Darton and Co., Holborn Hill, London 1851, 138-139, See also, Jeff Prucher, Brave New Worlds: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction, Oxford University Press, New York 2007, 171. 6 Stableford, The Sociology of Science Fiction, 80. 7 Kingsley Amis, “Starting Points”, in Science Fiction A Collection of Critical Essays, (Ed.), by Mark Rose, Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey 1976, 11. 8 Joanna Russ, “Reflections on Science Fiction- An Interview with Joanna Russ”, in Building Feminist Theory: Essays from QUEST, Longman, New York and London 1981, 243. 9 Aldiss with Wingrove, 15. 10 Farah Mendlesohn, “Introduction: reading science fiction”, in The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction, (Ed.), by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2003, 2. 2\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

Delany regards science fiction as “a tool to help you think” but “like anything that helps you think, by definition it doesn’t do the thinking for you.”14 Taking all of these different definitions into consideration, there are three influential critics who are foundational in shaping the definition of the term. Roberts, in his Science Fiction book, stresses these three major definitions of science fiction by Darko Suvin, Robert Scholes and Damien Broderick.15 Science fiction is defined by Suvin as “a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author’s empirical environment.”16 With its rational and logical implications, thanks to this cognition, we can understand and comprehend the alien landscape. We recognize the estrangement element of science fiction as different from the familiar and every day. To Suvin, however, a science fiction text should include both features and be in-between estrangement and the cognition, because if it is entirely concerned with estrangement, it would be difficult to understand. If it is entirely concerned with cognition, it would be scientific or documentary. That is why, thanks to this co-presence, science fiction becomes relevant to our world by challenging the ordinary at the same time, so that the alternative world of science fiction is determined by estrangement and cognition. By this definition, Suvin distinguishes science fiction from other genres such as Gothic, Fantasy and the fairy tale. Each of these genres present worlds that are estranged, but not cognitive, whereas in science fiction which, with its possible alternative worlds, reflects the constraints of science. Meanwhile, although detective fiction uses cognitive logic, it is not in an estranged fictional realm. For Suvin, cognitive and science are almost synonymous, that is, defining the science fiction term in another way is using the phrase 11\n\nIbid., 1. Ibid., 11. 13 Adam Roberts, Science Fiction, Routledge, London 2000, 1. 14 Samuel R. Delany, Starboard Wine: More Notes on the Language of Science Fiction, Dragon, New York 1984, 34. 15 Roberts, Science Fiction, 8. 16 Darko Suvin, Metamorphoses of Science Fiction: On the Poetics and History of a Literary Genre, Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn. 1979, 8-9. 12\n\n3\n\nBuran, Sümeyra. TechnoFeminist Science Fiction, Romanian Institute of Orthodox Theology and Spirituality, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. Romanian Institute of Orthodox Theology and Spirituality. All rights reserved.\n\n“cognitive estrangement.” Roberts asserts that “one of the strengths of Suvin’s definition is that it seems to embody a certain common-sense tautology, that science fiction is scientific fictionalizing.”17 Suvin argues that the science in science fiction plays the role of a discourse built on certain logical principles; that is, rational rather than emotional, as if fiction deals with emotions and science with truths. However, science is based on falsifiability because hypotheses are tested by experiment, so a scientific premise may not be proven false or true. Thus, in science fiction we cannot say that the science used in it makes it true or false. In the same way, Gwyneth Jones regards science fiction as a form of the thought experiment and “what if” game. For her, truth of science in science fiction is not important because the scientific method is much more important, that is the logical working through of a particular premise.18 Like Jones, Russ sees science fiction as “What If literature” which shows scientific things as they might be with serious, rational and consistent explanations.19 Unlike Suvin, Scholes stressed more on the literary features of science fiction texts and the metaphorical strain of science fiction. For him, science fiction is concerned with things different from the world we live in, but this does not show that science fiction is escapist or irrelevant. He argues that science fiction is both different and the same; it is both discontinuous from the world we actually inhabit simultaneously and confronts that world in some cognitive ways. He uses the term “fabulation” for any “fiction that offers us a world clearly and radically discontinuous from the one we know, yet returns to confront that known world in some cognitive way.”20 This fabulation world is created in all fantastic and imaginative literature. He adds structural notion to his fabulation definition when he calls fabulation synonymous with fiction and uses structural synonymous with science. To him, science fiction is a kind of “awareness of the universe as a system of systems, a structure of structures” and he asserts that “Structural fabulation is neither scientific in its method, nor a substitute for actual science. It is a fictional exploration of human situations made perceptible by the implications of recent science.”21 He gives more importance to the fictionalization of the premise by seeing science as only the starting point and an observational method for science fiction.\n\n17\n\nRoberts, Science Fiction, 8.

All rights reserved.\n\nThe last critic Roberts mentions is Broderick, who continues both Suvin’s sense of cognitive estrangement and Scholes’s structural fabulation. Broderick claims that science fiction text will be a kind of representation of the world metaphorically and he cannot consider the actual elements in the novel to be metaphorical, but metonymic. While in metaphor, one element stands for another, in metonymy one element represents the whole. The whole science fiction text is metaphorical, but science fiction as part of an imagined world stands in for the process of the whole environment.22 Following the definitions of Suvin, Scholes and Broderick, Roberts argues that the degree of proximity of the difference of the world in science fiction should neither too removed nor too close to the world we live in because if it is too removed, then the text becomes merely escapist, and if is too close, then the text becomes a conventional novel. He adds that “balancing ‘cognition’ and ‘estrangement,’ or the continuities and discontinuities of the SF text, becomes the index of success of the SF text.”23 Roberts asserts that the sense of science fiction within these three definitions becomes a symbolist genre. For example, Delany sees science fiction as “a symbolist genre, because it seeks to represent the world instead of reproducing it.”24 In the same way, Suvin sees science fiction as a symbolic system as well.25 According to Roberts, why science fiction is symbolic rather than allegoric is that symbolism “opens itself up to a richness of possible interpretation, where allegory maps significance from one thing onto one other thing” and symbolism is a correspondence between the spiritual and the natural world, but science fiction is to be “less spiritual and more material.”26 It is the same case for realism, a nonsymbolist mode of writing. For Roberts, although science fiction is symbolic, it also adapts a realist mode of accumulation of detail. Science fiction texts may be read like realist novels, but “the crucial point is that science fiction reconfigures symbolism for our materialist age.”27 In other words, the symbolic function of the science fiction texts is “precisely the representation of the encounter with difference, Otherness, alterity”28 such 22\n\nDamien Broderick, Reading by Starlight: Postmodern Science Fiction, Routledge, London and New York 1995, 155. 23 Roberts, Science Fiction, 16. 24 Delany, Silent Interviews, On Language, Race, Sex, Science Fiction and Some Comics, 123. 25 Suvin, Defined by a Hollow: Essays on Utopia, Science Fiction and Political Epistemology, 85-86. 26 Roberts, Science Fiction, 17. 27 Ibid., 18 28 Ibid., 25. 5\n\nBuran, Sümeyra. TechnoFeminist Science Fiction, Romanian Institute of Orthodox Theology and Spirituality, 2014. ProQuest\n\nas human of colour, females, cyborgs, androids, aliens, gynoids, cybernetic organisms, etc. In most celebrated science fiction texts, we see the problematic of this encounter with difference, “the difficulty of representing the Other without losing touch with the familiar.”29 The root of science fiction is based on an alien kind of encounter and exploring alterity, so “the meeting of self with other is perhaps the most fearful, most exciting and most erotic encounter of all.”30 Thereby, Roberts defines the term as in the following:\n\nCopyright © 2014. Romanian Institute of Orthodox Theology and Spirituality. All rights reserved.\n\nReading SF […] is about reading the marginal experience coded through the discourses of material symbolism; which is to say, it allows the symbolic expression of what it is to be female, or black, or otherwise marginalized. SF, by focusing its representations of the world not through reproduction of that world but instead by figuratively symbolizing it, is able to foreground precisely the ideological construction of Otherness. In other words, in societies such as ours where Otherness is often demonized, SF can pierce the constraints of this ideology by circumventing the conventions of traditional fiction.\n\nMoreover, another point in defining the term is “the literature of change” that Frederick Pohl mentions. He claims that “writing it consists in looking at the world around us, dissecting it into its component parts, throwing some of those parts away and replacing them with invented new ones ― and then reassembling that new world and describing what might happen in it.”31 Likewise, James E. Gunn’s broader definition is about change: “Science fiction is the branch of literature that deals with the effects of change on people in the real world as it can be projected into the past, the future, or to the distant places.”32 The last point concerns reader expectations. As Brooks Landon asserts “the stories of SF are not just ‘about’ new ways of seeing, new perspectives, but actually demand new ways of seeing from its readers.”33 That is, expectations of readers shape the function of science fiction. In other words, science fiction depends on the reader expectations that change for different types of fiction. Delany\n\n29\n\nIbid., 26.

For example, Landon claims, “the reader of reportage assumes that its words refer to what has happened, the reader of naturalistic fiction to what could have happened, the reader of fantasy to what could not have happened, and the reader of SF to what has not happened” and he adds that “what has not happened, in turn, subsumes stories about events that will not happen and events that might happen.”35 Despite such definitions, science fiction is much more than a definition and the very “non-definability” 36 of term is one of the important qualities of the genre. Science fiction stories might be born as a result of dissatisfaction with science or in order to be free from the limitations of the known science, hence science fiction “must also move forward as advances in science reshape our sense of what is not yet possible (and not yet impossible),” therefore; “the science fiction story should be thought of as part of a genre-in-the-making that must continue to escape the fixing stasis of definition.”37\n\nCopyright © 2014.

The First Wave Science Fiction a) Proto-Science Fiction We call the period before the Pulp/Magazine era the First Wave science fiction that covers the Proto-Science fiction and the Scientific Romance periods. The term science fiction “emerged from a mass of competing labels only in the late 1920s” and descriptions “like ‘different’, ‘off-trail’, ‘pseudo-scientific’ or ‘weird-scientific’ were used.”38 While science fiction began to be used as a term after the 1920s, the critical history of it is very new. The origin of the term started with Hugo Gernsback who first used the term ‘scientific fiction’ in 1923. The contraction ‘scientifiction’ was proposed in 1924 and continued to appear in his editorials of Amazing Stories from 1926 and then he coined the term ‘science fiction’ in his\n\n34\n\nDelany, The Jewel-Hinged Jaw: Notes on the Language of Science Fiction, 2137. 35 Landon, Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars, 8. 36 Ursula K.

Some critics take the origin of science fiction with H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, two fathers of science fiction, while some consider the origin of it as ancient as literature by searching fantastic and science-fictional elements in artworks. However, some consider earlier texts as protoscience fiction texts such as Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (2000 BC) or Lucian’s True History.41 Though some take the beginning of science fiction further back to Bible, some consider Thomas More’s Utopia (1516) as a starting point, or some others claim that it begins with John Milton’s Paradise Lost (1674), while some like Paul K. Alkon claim that “Science fiction starts with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein”42 (1818) as the grandmother of the genre. Therefore, it is difficult to say a concrete date for the beginning of science fiction genre. According to Stableford, the historical origin of science fiction dates at 17th century. Before the science fiction genre, in the 17th, century we could come across speculative fictions dealing with new discoveries and technologies and the earliest examples of science fiction texts were seen in the existing genres such as utopian fantasy and travelers’ tales. Luckhurst asserts that we see the trace sources of science fiction back to travelers’ tales because in science fiction we encounter with the other and the portrait of exotic difference.43 Some examples are Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis (written in 1617; published in 1627), Jonathan Valentin Andreae’s Christianapolis (1619) and Tommaso Campanella’s La Cittá del Sole (The City of the Sun, written 1602; published 1623).44 In addition, most utopian fantasies were based on scientific discoveries as well as on technological advancement and on some imaginary voyage, which was the usual narrative form of utopian fantasy as well as of scathing satirical fantasies.45 For example, Margaret Cavendish’s The Blazing World (1666) weaves 39\n\nIbid., p. 15.

Imaginary voyage was important for the history of science fiction in which we see the journey of a traveler to unknown parts of the world seeing marvels and reporting them back.46 Stableford asserts that imaginary voyages in 17th and 18th century to the interplanetary remained like a dream, but gradually became plausible after the mid-19th century.47 That is, imaginary voyages had very crucial role in the 19th century science fiction. Related to imaginary voyage in proto-science fiction, lunar voyage was very important. Lunar voyage type of fiction goes back to A True Story of Lucian of Samosata (in the second century A. D.) Some examples to lunar voyage are Johannes Kepler’s Somnium (A Dream, 1634), Francis Godwin’s farcical account The Man in the Moon (1638) and John Wilkin’s essay “Discovery of a World in the Moon” (1638).48 Besides this lunar voyage, there appeared other cosmic voyages as well such seen in German scholar Athanasius Kircher’s Itinerarium Exstaticum (Ecstatic Journey, 1656), Gabriel Daniel’s Voyage au monde de Descartes (Voyage to the Descartes, 1692) and Christian Huygen’s Cosmotheoros (1698). Roberts argues that William Blake’s Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1793), or Percy Shelley’s Queen Mab (1813) in which the protagonist travels around the solar system in a magic car, or Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818) helps the development of science fiction genre.49 In the same way, the 18th century cosmic voyages were seen in Arcana Coelestia (1749-56) by Emmanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish theologian. This cosmic voyage tradition took a new direction in France by adding magical devices thanks to the translation of One Thousand and One Nights (1704-17) or known as The Arabian Nights by Antoine Galland.50 Meanwhile, by the end of the 18th century two other types, the story of the future and the invention of story emerged such as Louis Sébastien Mercier’s L’Andeux mille quatre cent quarante (The Year 2440, 1771). In the same way, Shelley and Webb wrote future life novels in the early 18th century, as well. After the story of future, in the late 18th and early 19th century, the modern invention story emerged with the great works; William Godwin’s St Leon (1799) and his daughter Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818). 46\n\nEverett Franklin Bleiler, Science-Fiction, the Early Years: A Full Description of More Than 3,000 Science-Fiction Stories from Earliest Times to the Appearance of the Genre Mag, Kent State University Press, Kent, Ohio 1990, xix. 47 Stableford, “Science fiction before the genre, The origins of science fiction”, 16. 48 Ibid., 16. 49 Roberts, Science Fiction, 55. 50 For the other examples to cosmic voyages, See Stableford, “Science fiction before the genre, The origins of science fiction”, 17. 9\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

Scientific Romance Patrick Parrinder claims that Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Verne, and Wells were four important figures in terms of their methods and objectives among the 19th century authors of scientific romances.52 Frankenstein: OR, The Modern Prometheus is written in the form of scientific romance and like Milton’s monstrous alien Satan, Shelley’s gothic monster is also first created and then abandoned by his creator as he falls into an amnesiac state. The strangeness and otherness of the monster and his story of creation in the laboratory by a scientist and supernatural, extraordinary elements make the novel a kind of science fiction, but there is not a detailed scientific explanation of the origin of the creature of the monster. Roberts argues that Shelley’s alienated monster “articulates the way ‘science’ cuts itself off from the more organic process of nature, and in turn functions as a symbol for a modern sense of alienated existence.”53 Suvin claims that the novel has a current theme of science fiction and the fiction that “progress becomes indissoluble from catastrophe.”54 However, Jane Webb Loudon’s work The Mummy! A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century (1827) depicts little explorations of speculative future inventions. Nevertheless, after Shelley, as Parrinder asserts, we see a prolonged gap because of the undeveloped systematic process of scientific romance until the works of Verne and Wells.55 In the 19th century, we see many science fiction stories that might be called as scientific romance in American literature, as well.56 H. Bruce Franklin asserts that “There was no major nineteenth-century American writer of fiction, and indeed few in the second rank, who did not write some science fiction or at least one utopian romance.”57 Therefore, 19th century American literature was associated with science fiction or scientific romance. Poe was the first writer to grapple with this problem. He 51\n\nBleiler, Science-Fiction, the Early Years: A Full Description of More Than 3,000 Science-Fiction Stories from Earliest Times to the Appearance of the Genre Mag, xx. 52 Parrinder, Science Fiction: Its Criticism and Teaching, xvi. 53 Roberts, Science Fiction, 59. 54 Darko Suvin, Metamorphoses of Science Fiction: On the Poetics and History of a Literary Genre, 10. 55 Parrinder, Science Fiction: Its Criticism and Teaching, 7. 56 Landon, Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars, 40. 57 H.

Sir Humphry Davy formulated his Consolations in Travel (1830) in a series of dialogues and wrote his thoughts on speculations of alien life. Then, Robert Hunt published The Poetry of Science (1849), which later became the source of inspiration to Wilson’s A Little Earnest Book Upon a Great Old Subject (1851). In other words, the 19th century science fiction genre was associated with scientific romance which “at its simplest consists in the use of scientific (or, more often, quasi-scientific) elements in highly coloured romantic fiction.”59 During the middle and late 19th century similar concepts to lunar voyages that came to an end during the late 18th century reappeared as a result of archeological discoveries in Central and South America and new geographical explorations in Central Africa and Asia. Thanks to these geographical events, two new story types developed; the voyage extraordinaire of Verne and his imitators and the lost-race novel. Hence, influenced by Poe, French author Verne (1828-1905) pioneered the science fiction genre with his method of “extrapolation of contemporary technology, and he became famous for the application of hypothetical locomotive technologies to laborious exploration and leisurely tourism.”60 Verne wrote about the stories of fantastic voyages, underwater travel with practical submarines, space travel, air travel (air travel and submarines were not invented at that time as well as practical means of space travel) in his series of Voyages Extraordinaires (Extraordinary Voyages, 1863-72). Like Verne and Gernsback, Wells (1866-1946) was also considered as the “Father of Science Fiction” genre. Nicholas Ruddick regards H. G. Wells as the originator of British science fiction in the 19th century.61 Likewise, Parrinder asserts that Wells as a pivotal figure played an important role in the evolution of bringing scientific romance into modern science fiction.62 Parrinder relates the success of Wells to “his mastery of representative themes (time-travel, the alien invasion, biological mutation, the future city, anti-utopia)” because “his stories embody a new generic 58\n\nStableford, “Science fiction before the genre, The origins of science fiction”, 1819. 59 Parrinder, Science Fiction: Its Criticism and Teaching, 4. 60 Stableford, “Science fiction before the genre, The origins of science fiction”, 20. 61 Nicholas Ruddick, Twentieth-Century British and Irish Fiction: The Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Fiction, (Ed.), by Brian W. Shaffer, WileyBlackwell, West Sussex 2011, 332. 62 Parrinder, Science Fiction: Its Criticism and Teaching, 10. 11\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

Besides, Wells, like Verne, wrote about lunar exploration in The First Man in the Moon (1901).65 In his other scientific romance The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), we see the reworking of Shelley’s Frankenstein and through it Milton’s Paradise Lost. Stableford calls three works of Wells as painstaking moral fables; The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898) all of which are “albeit of an unprecedentedly zestful and unusually realistic kind, cleverly assisted by the narrative labour that made their central devices plausible.”66 Shortly, Wells’s combination of fantasy and realism made a significant contribution to the definition of the genre, but he was the last to use this old style because after then the magazines “did not share Wells’s gloom about the immediate future” by rejecting the stories “outside the realm of scientific possibilities.”67 Scientific romance tradition attracted many writers such as Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford (in The Inheritors, 1901), Rudyard Kipling (“With the Night Mail,” 1905 and “As Easy as A. B. C.,” 1912), E. M. Forster (in “The Time Machine Stops,” 1909),68 Arthur Conan Doyle (The Lost World, 1912 and The Poison Belt, 1913), and his contemporary George Griffith (A Honeymoon in Space, 1901), who at the same time “became a prolific writer of ‘karmic romances’.”69 Moreover, a frequent subject of the 20th century British science fiction was a kind of reflection of pessimism as a result of disasters, either man-made or natural as seen in M. P. Shiel’s The Purple Cloud (1901), S. Fowler Wright’s Deluge (1927), Robert Cromie’s The Crack of Doom (1895), and William Hope Hodgson’s\n\n63\n\nIbid., 10-11.

Beresford’s The Hampdenshire Wonder (1911), G. B. Shaw’s Back to Methuselah (1921), E. V. Odle’s The Clockwork Man (1923), Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932), John Gloag’s Tomorrow’s Yesterday (1932), and W. Olaf Stapledon’s Odd John (1935).71 After the Great War, some writers wrote about the destruction of civilization and future anticipation about that destruction caused by the war such as what Edward Shanks (in The People of the Ruins, 1920) and Cicely Hamilton (in Theodore Savage, 1922). The 1880s and 1890s witnessed two crucial developments: the scientific trappings the American social utopias and the science fiction dime novel.72 The most notable American social utopia was Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward (1888).73 While these social utopias struggle for some change, science fiction dime novels appeared to entertain people.74 The dime novels dominated American literature between the Civil War and World War I and focused on speculative technology about transportation such as advanced submarines and flying machines, or on lost-race stories, but “the dime novel was politically very conservative and jingoistic.”75 The most known writers of this dime novel were Francis W. Doughty, Philip Reade and Cornelius Shea. Edward Sylvester Ellis’s Edisonade invention story The Steam Man of the Prairies (1868) is a notable example. Consequently, the arrival of the pulp magazine format forced the dime novels out of existence.76 Scientific romance, as the British tradition represented by Shelley and Wells, gave its place to that popular so-called pulp-fiction market in U.S. Until very late in the 19th century, we cannot see such a popular market evolving in Britain. Therefore, after the decline of the scientific romance in Britain and the science fiction dime novel in U.S., a new trend began; that was the rise of pulp magazines. 70\n\nRuddick, Twentieth-Century British and Irish Fiction: The Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Fiction, 333. 71 Ibid., 333. 72 Bleiler, Science-Fiction, the Early Years: A Full Description of More Than 3,000 Science-Fiction Stories from Earliest Times to the Appearance of the Genre Mag, xxi. 73 Ibid., xxi.

Cheap magazine format known as ‘pulp’ became famous and, thanks to cheap publishing, a wide range of magazines popped up as well as specific markets such as westerns, detective fiction and romantic love stories. In pulp magazines, many types of science fiction stories were published such as “lost-race stories, foolish invention stories, interplanetary adventure fiction, early aeronautics fiction, and scientist stories, and many other.”77 Hence, Attebery calls the history of science fiction period from 1926 to 1960 the magazine era.78 Thrill Book was considered as the first pulp started publishing in 1919 and Amazing Stories as the first magazine started in April 1926 (this issue appeared on the newsstands in early March).79 That is, it was Hugo Gernsback who both invented the first science fiction magazine and coined the term science fiction by using ‘scientifiction’ term. Gernsback started publishing several magazines such as Modern Electrics in April 1908 (in which he published Ralph 124C 41+) and Science and Invention in 1921 before publishing Amazing Stories in 1926. In one of his editorial magazines, Science Wonder Stories (June 1929), Gernsback refused to publish the stories outside the realm of scientific possibility and correctness. Hence, in his early science fiction novel Ralph 124C 41+ written in serial, Gernsback foretold some technological predictions about future technology such as spaceflight, channel surfing, power transmission, remote-control, the video phone, artificial cloth, voice printing, tape recording, etc. That is, “Gernsback and his successors showed that stories embodying social change, providing that they offered a Verne-like combination of boyish adventure with nuts, bolts and blueprints, could more than hold their own against other descendants of the nineteenthcentury romance such as the mass-produced tales of horror and supernatural fantasy.”80 In his early magazines Modern Electrics, The Electrical Experimenter (1908), Radio News (1919), and Science and Invention, he printed occasional stories, some issued technology and a few of them were primitive science fiction. 77\n\nBleiler, Science-Fiction, the Early Years: A Full Description of More Than 3,000 Science-Fiction Stories from Earliest Times to the Appearance of the Genre Mag, xxii. 78 Brian Attebery, “The Magazine era: 1926-1960”, in The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction, (Ed.), by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2003, 32. 79 Roberts, Science Fiction, 67. See also Bleiler, xxii. 80 Parrinder, H.G. Wells: The Critical Heritage, 13. 14\n\nBuran, Sümeyra. TechnoFeminist Science Fiction, Romanian Institute of Orthodox Theology and Spirituality, 2014. ProQuest\n\nCopyright © 2014. Romanian Institute of Orthodox Theology and Spirituality. All rights reserved.\n\nThus, after seeing the popularity of such stories, which he first called “scientifiction” and then later “science fiction,” he began to publish science fiction stories. Gernsback, in his first editorial, talked about the scientifiction of Wells, Verne and Poe by suggesting that “the ideal proportion of a scientifiction story should be 75 percent literature interwoven with 25 percent science.”81 Then later, he changed his expression scientifiction by inventing the term “science fiction” in an editorial, in the June 1929 Science Wonder Stories. Before Gernsback, of course, there were science fiction stories, but it was Gernsback after whom science fiction became a genre.82 Thus, it can be said that Gernsback was a pioneering figure who makes the term a notable and formal genre. Meanwhile, two terms emerged in the magazine era; hard science fiction and space opera. Hard science fiction, which was mostly written by scientists, was concerned with hard facts and hard sciences; thus the hard science fiction writer was interested in finding “new and unfamiliar scientific theories and discoveries which could provide the occasion a framework for introducing the scientific concept to the reader.”83 In other words, knowledge of science and technology were central themes and hard science fiction was based on scientific knowledge external to the story. On the other side, the space opera concerned about “a melodramatic adventurefantasy involving stock themes and setting is evolved on the flimsiest scientific basis” such as science fiction “films, TV serials and comic strips.”84 That is, space opera weaved romantic and melodramatic adventure stories set in outer space and it was not related to soap opera or music. Edward Elmer Smith (1890-1965), also known as E. E. “Doc” Smith or “Skylark Smith” was the father of space opera and famous for his Lensman series and the Skylark series.85 Most of the pulps had a reputation of alien invasion tradition. Roberts claims that pulps “have a reputation for a very different sort of fiction: for kinetic, fast-paced and exciting tales are also clumsily written, hurried in conception, and morally crude.”86 For example, we see the repeated use of alien invasion of Wellsian type in which human being triumphs over alien menace as seen in Edgar Rice Burroughs’s The Moon Maid (1926), and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (which first appeared in Philip Nowlan’s Armegeddon 2419 in 1929 and then in Amazing Stories during 1928-29) 81\n\nQuoted by Landon, Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars, 51. 82 Ibid., 53. 83 Parrinder, Science Fiction: its Criticism and Teaching, 13-15. 84 Ibid., 15. 85 Joseph Sanders, E.

We can see the same characters, the alien type creatures as a reputation of the same scenario, so we could find the same ingredients in different stories of the pulp tradition. After Amazing Stories reached a great number of readers thanks to its formula, other pulp publishers began to create their own science fiction magazines such as Astounding Stories (1930), Astonishing Stories (1931), Marvel Science Stories (1938), and Startling Stories (1939). The most important of these new publishers was John W. Campbell who published Astounding Science-Fiction in 1937 as a science fiction magazine editor. Before Campbell, the magazine’s editor was F. Orlin Tremaine who gave the name of Astounding Stories to the magazine, but later Campbell renamed it as Astounding Science-Fiction. The Golden Age of science fiction genre is often referred to the period that begins with the editorship of Campbell. b) The Golden Age The Golden Age of science fiction consists of a period from the late 1930s to the 1950s, but the period roughly began in 1937 when Campbell started the editorship of Astounding Stories.87 Campbell argued that science fiction could educate people as well as entertaining them. He agreed to the idea that science should be intermingled with the story, but more than this, he believed that there should be more than machines and ideas in science fiction, such as the response and reaction of people to those ideas. Campbell edited such well-known science fiction writers like Isaac Asimov, Lester del Rey, Arthur C. Clarke, Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon, A. E. Van Vogt, L. Sprague de Camp, L. Ron Hubbard, Clifford D. Simak, Jack Williamson, Henry Kuttner, and C. L. Moore. David Hartwell claimed that “the real golden age of science fiction is twelve,”88 alluding to the fact that the genre was discovered at the age of 12 and as Mike Ashley claims “by 1938, magazine science fiction was 12 years old and was about to enter its teens.”89 Ashley argues that the year 1939 was a boom year of science fiction and “in 1938 the first signs of this boom came the appearance of Marvel Science Stories amongst the pulps\n\n87\n\nKeith Booker and Anne-Marie Thomas, The Science Fiction Handbook, WileyBlackwell, West Sussex 2009, 326. 88 James E.

Asimov regarded the genre of Campbell as social science fiction, which was interested in the impacts of scientific advance on human beings, thus he called Campbell the father of social science fiction.93 Asimov was famous for both his social science fictions and hard science fictions and he was notable for his much imitated books, the Foundation series, set in a Galactic Empire. Asimov preferred to explain scientific concepts by using history as seen in his Foundation series. Asimov also coined the term “robotics” in his story “Liar” (1941). In addition to his Foundation series, Asimov published his robot stories many of which were collected in I, Robot (1950) telling the rules of ethics for robots. One of these robot stories “The Bicentennial Man” (1976) was made into a film starring Robin Williams in1999 as well as I, Robot was made into a film starring Will Smith in 2004. Heinlein was one of these writers who tried to show the realistic picture of the social developments of the age. Heinlein saw science fiction as “Realistic Future-Scene Fiction” and in his essay “Science Fiction: Its Nature, Faults and Virtues” (1959), he defined science fiction as a “realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method.”94 With his editor Campbell, Heinlein improved his art of writing by stepping science fiction to a higher status.95 In other words, Campbell supported the idea of avoidance from mysticism and the writers under his editorial could express his “vision of the orderly, knowable universe and the place of the scientifically minded man within it.”96 Heinlein was one of these writers 90\n\nIbid., 135.

By investigating the social trends, writers published many stories “about telepathy and other forms of extrasensory perception, so-called ‘psi powers’” in the magazines of the 1940s and 1950s.97 One of psionic writers that Campbell favored was Canadian A. E. Van Vogt (best known novel Slan, Astounding Science Fiction, 1940).98 Besides Asimov’s Foundation series, Frank Herbert’s Dune series are also considered as to write Asimov’s concept of randomness of the historical process. Herbert’s most notable novel Dune (1995) was a landmark soft science fiction in which he addressed the future of humanity rather than the future of humanity’s technology, so he suppressed technology deliberately. Dune was also the first major ecological science fiction in which we see the interaction of men with the climate, geography, and ecology. 99 After Astounding, the trend of publishing more personal voices and visions started and then a lot of magazines appeared around 1950s. The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (1949), If (1953) and Amazing, which appeared with a different editor Cele Goldsmith in 1956, were three challenging examples to Astounding by introducing new and untouched writers. On the British magazine side, the London-based New Worlds in which we see the tradition of speculative fiction beginning with Wells, first appeared as Nova Terra, but later transformed into the American mode in 1949. For instance, Arthur C. Clarke tried to “combine the efficient storytelling of American sf with Wells’s social awareness and Olaf Stapledon’s visionary grandeur” in his alien invasion story Childhood’s End (1953), which first appeared as “Guardian Angel” (1950) in New Worlds. One name who gained much fame was John Wyndham. He became more famous with his paperback publication The Day of the Triffids (1951) among the British writers of 1950s and contributed to the magazine New Worlds with other writers as Brian Aldiss, John Brunner and J. G. Ballard. Thus, paperback publishing began to be important among science fiction writers. Galaxy Science Fiction magazine was founded by Horace L. Gold in 1950. It was “the most representative ‒ and perhaps most important ‒ sf magazine of the 1950s” in which a typical galaxy stories were published with certain central characters such as “the chain-smoking, rumpled-suitwearing, martini-drinking” man or weak women characters some of whom\n\n97\n\nIbid., 40.

However, without the earlier efforts of magazines, “the genre would not be what it has become.”101 Thus, the science fiction genre shifted from the cheap publications of magazine era to the New Wave period. When science fiction novels reached the bestseller lists, science fiction scholarship grew up; thus, the number of science fiction movie fans increased and science fiction criticism flourished.\n\nCopyright © 2014.

The New Wave Science Fiction The term New Wave is derived from Françoise Giroud’s term nouvelle vague that describes a group of young French film directors.102 However, in terms of science fiction Christopher Priest “appropriated the term for a sf almost equally disruptive, existentially fraught and formally daring that evolved around the British sf magazine New Worlds in the mid to late 1960s.”103 Likewise, Luckhurst asserts that in England the magazine New Worlds edited by Michael Moorcock was associated with the New Wave.104 Moorcock aimed to redefine the term “speculative fantasy” and to promise nothing less than “an important revitalization of the literary mainstream.”105 Within American science fiction, Harlan Ellison joined to the New Wave science fiction with his Dangerous Visions collection in 1967. Both Ellison’s and Moorcock’s group considered Golden Age science fiction as “an exhausted mode of low culture, trapped in a ghetto of its own construction.”106 Thus, the course of the genre’s history was changed by the New Wave. Writers of this New Wave were postwar generation and this New Wave saw important experimental science fiction novelists such as British ones; Moorcock, Ballard, Aldiss, Brunner, and Pamela Zoline, and American ones; Harlan Ellison, Philip K. Dick, Delany, Heinlein, Ursula Le Guin and Octavia Butler. 100\n\nAttebery, “The Magazine era: 1926-1960”, in The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction, 42. 101 Ibid., 46-7. 102 Damien Broderick, “New Wave and Backwash: 1960-1980”, in The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction, (Ed.), by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2003, 49-50. 103 Ibid, 50. 104 Luckhurst, Science Fiction, 141. 105 Michael Moorcock, “A New Literature for the Space Age”, New Worlds, 142(23), May/June, 1964, 3. 106 Luckhurst, Science Fiction, 142. 19\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

Some examples to these writers are Aldiss’s Non-Stop (1958), Robert Zelazny’s Lord of Light (1967), John Bruner’s Stand on Zanzibar (1969) and Moorcock’s Dancers at the End of Time sequence, and short stories like Harlan Ellison’s “‘Repent, Harlequin!’ Said the Ticktockman” (1965).111 That is to say, from the late 1930s to the early 1960s, during the Golden Age period, science fiction was incoherent with the scientific realities, because then, the term science fiction suggested imaginative and futuristic fiction.112 That is, there appeared skeptical technological solutions to the problems of social and environmental in the science fiction of the New Wave. 113 In other words, the Golden Age of science fiction was a “quest for transcendence,” which was not effective in the sixties.114 Unlike Campbellian science fiction that included the physics and mechanistic psychology, Ballard supported new fiction that depended on “abstract” and “cool” sciences, “more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time-systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the remote, somber half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.”115 The New Wave science fiction was associated with 107\n\nIbid., 141.

That is, the New Wave science fiction was formed in opposition to “the plain prose, straightforward narration, and idea-driven stories characteristic of the Golden Age.”116 American New Wave science fiction witnessed pioneering figures such as Heinlein (the ‘drop-out’ hippy countercultural novel Stranger in a Strange Land, 1961),117 Tolkien (alien-populated science fiction landscape The Lord of the Rings, 1954-55),118 Herbert (ecological science fiction novel Dune (1965),119 black and gay Delany (confounded prejudice and illuminated Otherness novel Triton, 1976),120 Dick (the philosophic depth and schizophrenic novels Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, 1968 and Ubik, 1969),121 and Ellison. Ellison’s science fiction short story anthology Dangerous Visions (1967) was conceived as a platform for speculative fiction and remained a turning point for the New Wave. Ellison’s own short stories entered a rich stream in the late 1960s as well as teen gang fiction and Gothic horror. When we come to the 1970s, we see that it has been a fruitful decade for science fiction. It is “a moment of breakthrough: the success of Moorcock’s transformation of New Worlds and Ellison’s Dangerous Visions project gave a new legitimacy to SF.”122 The Scientific Research Association was founded in America in 1970, and the Science Fiction Foundation formed in England in 1972. Science Fiction Studies began in 1973 co-founded by Suvin, the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts emerged in 1980 accelerated the academic legitimacy and institutional consolidation of by science fiction stressing on the cognitive estrangements of contemporary writers. Then, after Star Trek (1966-8), Hollywood turned to science fiction in the late 1970s such as George Lucas’s Star Wars (1977), Stephen Spielberg’s Close Encounters, as well 116\n\nElhefnawy, After the New Wave: Science Fiction Since 1980, 10.

It was the New Wave which caused huge changes “in the relationship of SF to mainstream writing, its engagement with cultural issues, its attitude toward science and technology, its treatment of sex, and its growing concern with the ‘soft’ sciences of psychology, sociology, and anthropology.”124 To sum up, by the New Wave, science fiction has welcomed many diverse voices and colors as well as to other disciplines.\n\nCopyright © 2014.

The Fourth Wave Science Fiction In the Fourth Wave, which is the period we are in now, science fiction writing has flourished and varied as it has never been before. The science fiction readership broadened and diffused, so science fiction was no longer a genre to amuse the adolescents. A number of science fiction magazines decreased and a number of books and novels written on science fiction increased accordingly. Moreover, people started to consume science fiction through films, computer games, and TV. This tendency towards media paved the way for industrialized science fiction. The movies and TV series such as Star Trek or Star Wars increased exponentially. Hence, we can say that Cyberpunk began to be famous at that time the nature of our real world began to be shaped by the Internet. The term Cyberpunk was coined by science fiction writer Bruce Bethke in 1983 in order to “describe novels and stories about the information explosion of the 1980s (hence ‘Cyber,’ from cybernetics), most of them picturing a dense, urban, confusing new world in which most of us will find that we have been disenfranchised from any real power (hence ‘punk’).”125 The term “cyber” pertains to information systems and the term “punk” refers to fractious youth, so these two terms together suggest “an artificial human with torn clothes and spiky hair, and something very close to that image can be seen”126 in the characters of Cyberpunk novels. 123\n\nRoberts, Science Fiction, 84.

The first is a synthesis of the ideas and approaches of New Wave and hard science fiction; the second, a sophisticated use of self-reference; and the third, the creative use of the historical past.”132 Firstly, some examples of the starting point of synthesis of the older and newer traditions in the New Wave were John Varley’s The Ophihuchi Hotline (1977) and Gregory Benford’s Timescape (1980). On the other side, in the 1980s, we saw increasingly self-conscious and explicit synthesis such as combining radical and hard science fiction with contemporary science and technology.133 In the same way, Bruce Sterling in his editorial newsletter, Cheap Truth, agreed about the influence of the previous ideas and approaches of the New Wave and hard science fiction on Cyberpunk.134 Sterling identified a core group of Cyberpunks in his preface to Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology (1988): Gibson, Rudy Rucker, Lewis Shiner, John Shirley and Pat Cadigan (the only woman in the anthology). Sterling asserts that the group as “the definite product” of the “Eighties milieu” grew up “not only within the literary tradition of 127\n\nPatricia Melzer, Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought, University of Texas, Austin, TX 2006, 6-7. 128 Ibid., 69. 129 Ibid., 71. 130 Elhefnawy, After the New Wave: Science Fiction Since 1980, 14. 131 Ibid. 132 Ibid., 13. 133 Ibid. 134 Bruce Sterling, “Preface”, in Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology, (Ed.), by Bruce Sterlin, Arbor House, New York 1986, viii. 23\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

Besides the synthesis of New Wave and hard science fiction as Cyberpunk, the New Space Opera or the New Weird was the other most evident and productive synthesis of New Wave and hard science fiction. Between 1980 and 2000, science fiction became New Space Opera. The stories of this New Space Opera can resemble the classic space opera with its epic scope, but it evokes pessimism about humanity’s future. In other words, the New Space Opera embraces “extreme variety in forms of intelligent life ‒ humans, aliens, machines or combinations thereof ‒ crafted by evolution, technology or bioengineering,” rather than just featuring only humans and humanoid aliens. In this New Space Opera universe, humans are not dominant, and we see other means of transportation rather than starships or spaceships.137 In the late 1980s, we see the major revival of the form, but this American sub-genre reappeared in Britain with writers who tried to wake up the New Wave’s avant-garde ambitions.138 In America, we cannot talk about some kind of return to space opera because the form never fully disappeared; so this New Space Opera was associated with British science fiction after the New Wave. At the end of 1980s and in the 1990s, we see a cluster of British New Space Opera works by Ian Banks, Paul J. McAuley, Colin Greenland, Stephen Baxter, Peter Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds, Ken Macleod, Justina Robson and John Clute. On the other side, American writers made very important contributions to this sub-genre as well with such notable writers like Dam Simmon, Sterling, Orson Scott Card, Greg Bear and Kim Stanley Robinson. Finally, the New Space Opera or the New Weird were the famous trends within 1990s American and British science fiction, which responded 135\n\nIbid., vii.

For example, pastiche alien invasion fantasies are borrowed from the 1950s B-movie idioms as seen in movies Independence Day (1996), Mars Attacks! (1996), Godzilla (1998). Another example in novel form is Robinson’s Mars trilogy (1992-6) which shows the Martian planetary romance. Shortly, 1990s science fiction is pastiche, repetition, “a consolidation and rejuvenation.”140 The second issue Elhefnawy asserts is that there was a sophisticated use of self-reference by the writers of 1980s. He claims that new writers consciously step in a tradition by playing with that tradition through injokes and self-reference.141 For example, Rucker in his Software (1982) and Wetware (1988) stressed on Asimov’s robotic laws. Such kind of selfreference examples continued and among 2008’s releases, we see Elizabeth Bear’s “Shoggoths in Bloom,” John Kessel’s novelette “Pride and Prometheus” in which Frankenstein meets Jane Austen’s Bennett family, Cory Doctorow’s Little Brother, and Charles Stross’s Saturn’s Children, which is a late period homage to Heinlein’s Friday (1982). Thirdly, retro-futurism or alternate history boomed in the 1980s and 1990s. That is, “Besides synthesizing new futures out of principally older elements, and making an art form out of self-reference, the preoccupation with the past increasingly drove writers to invent new pasts‒ and also, the futures that might have followed from them.”142 Steampunk and retrofuturism are often set in the 19th century or post-apocalyptic environment and they are blended from the alternate history and retro-futurism. Retrofuturism is often seen as associated with historical counterfactuals or with the futurology of an earlier period. However, much of retro-futurism is based on self-reference because the ultimate self-reference refers to the earlier science fiction which founded many of the worlds in these stories.143 Thus, the post-Cyberpunk writers often wrote in steampunk way; Rucker in The Hollow Earth (1990), Gibson and Sterling in The Difference Engine (1991), Paul Di Filippo in Steampunk Trilogy (he was the first to use the word steampunk, 1995), Neil Stephenson in the 1995 Cyberpunk steampunk combination novel The Diamond Age (after his post-Cyberpunk 139\n\nIbid., 221.

Thereby, from 1990s to the present, British science fiction has felt a boom with such notable writers who have combined science fiction with other genres: Gwyneth Jones in her Bold as Love (2001) combined science fiction, fantasy and horror fiction with a feminist view, China Mieville in her weird fiction Perdido Street Station (2000) used Marxism and contemporary literary theory and won both science fiction and fantasy awards in 2000, and Stephen Baxter in Darwinian epic Evolution (2002) used the tradition of Wells, Stapledon, and Clarke. In other words, in the New Millennium we see the mixture of genres and “recombinant genre fiction”; stories not only borrow materials and techniques from previous literary traditions and even use domestic realism traditions, but also decompose and reconstitute these genre materials and techniques effectively. 144 Hence, today it is difficult to name a work of art solely science fiction, fantasy, or gothic. On the other side, hybridity has always hidden in science fiction even in its earliest emergence in the late 19th century when in the 1880s and 1890s contemporary genres emerged such as spy fiction, horror, detective fiction, and science fiction. That is, science fiction “has turned full circle” and “the genre has always been a mixed, hybrid, bastard form, in a process of constant change.”145 For this reason, some genres or approaches like TechnoFeminism bring different but correlative movements, genres or discourses together. TechnoFeminism, the combination of Cyberfeminism and Cyborg feminism, will be examined as a new approach to contemporary feminist science fiction in the following chapter. Consequently, after giving some definitions of the term science fiction and presenting information about the history of science fiction in this introduction chapter, we will explain the herstory of science fiction ―women/feminist science fiction from the proto-women science fiction up to the present technodigital age― in the first chapter. In the second chapter, we will examine Judy Wajcman’s TechnoFeminist approach that we have brought it together with contemporary feminist science fiction, and so used the term TechnoFeminist Science Fiction. Finally, the last chapter will explore the analysis of TechnoFeminist Science Fiction novels Natural History by Justina Robson and Correspondence by Sue Thomas, which demonstrate the impact of technology and science on the lives of women through the internet, regenerative technologies, communication 144\n\nGary K.

This chapter evaluates science fiction’s emphasis on gender from the First Wave feminist theory to the present time. It also reviews the herstory of proto-feminist or women’s science fiction, the First Wave feminist science fiction (pulp/magazine era women science fiction), the Second Wave feminist science fiction (the New Wave women science fiction, and the birth of the Feminist Science Fiction in 1970s), the Third Wave feminist science fiction (Cyberpunk era), and the Forth Wave feminist science fiction (the New Millennium feminist science fiction, technoscience, TechnoFeminist Science Fiction, from 1990 to the present). In order to explore social relations, feminists increasingly employ science fiction narratives, so they recognize political implications of science fiction.146 Patricia Melzer claims, “both science fiction texts and feminist theories conceptualize issues of difference, globalization, and technoscience that increasingly affect women’s lives and both are concerned with contested boundaries and definitions of bodies and cultural/social territories” so, because of this reason, “feminist writings (and readings) of science fiction can be understood as part of a feminist criticism of existing power relations.”147 For example, cyber theorists Donna J. Haraway and Sadie Plant are interested in the effects of science and technology on women’s lives and queer feminists Teresa de Lauretis and Judith Butler are concerned with the subject and gender construction. That is, Melzer argues that science fiction, because of its particular narrative mode, remained valuable for feminists: Two textual aspects that define science fiction are the structures and/or narrative devices that constitute its mode, on one hand, and themes and approaches on the other. Several structures and narrative devices of science fiction have been identified in classical science fiction criticism, such as the element of estrangement, or the confrontation of normative systems/perspectives, and the implication of new sets of norms that result in the factual reporting of fiction. Spatial and temporal displacement as well as absent paradigms that structure the reading process is typical for science fiction. Also characteristic for science fiction are “worlds,” or 146 147\n\nMelzer, Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought, 4. Ibid. 28\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

Schlobin’s list of additional 375 female authors from 1962 to 1982 over a course of almost 300 years, as well as their collections, anthologies and science fiction novels in 830 book-length English language.153 As a term, science fiction did not exist before its invention in 1929; the works of women writers can be regarded as protoscience fiction as the works of Verne and Wells. Cavendish, the Duchess of Newcastle, is regarded as the first female science fiction writer by some and her prose romance The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing World (1666) is the first female utopian novel, which is among the earlier examples of science fiction. Many critics cite the root of science fiction as Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818) which was also one of the proto examples of science fiction along with The Last Man (1826). Loudon was one of the followers of Shelley and The Mummy! A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century (1827) is about speculative future inventions such as moving houses, barrels of air, stage balloon, mail-post letter-ball, moving houses. Loudon foresees changes in fashion as well; for instance, her court ladies wear trousers. Mary Griffith’s Three Hundred Years Hence (1836), in which a hero awakens from a deep sleep into a future utopian state, is regarded as the 148\n\nIbid., 2.

In America, this utopian speculation was engaged with the first feminist movement that took place at a convention in Seneca Falls in 1848. For example, Jane Sophia Appleton talked about women’s rights in her 22 page utopia, “Sequel to the Vision of Bangor in the Twentieth Century” (1848) in Voices from the Kenduskeag. In the same way, Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote for women’s rights in her utopian trilogy Moving the Mountain (1911), Herland (1915) and With Her in Ourland (1916). In the Victorian era, female writers such as Mrs. J. H. Riddell, Amelia B. Edwards, Elizabeth Gaskell, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Sarah Orne Jewett, Harriet Prescott Spofford and Edith Wharton existed as the authors of ghost stories weaving science fictional features. For example, Spofford creates an object that helps people to pass through solid matter in her “The Ray of Displacement” (published in Metropolitan Magazine in October 1903). In the story, a nameless narrator discovers the Y-ray that opens up interatomic spaces and when he is sent into prison for theft, he leaves the prison by walking through the walls periodically in order to work in his laboratory. Later, in the spiritualist movement of the twentieth century, female writers appeared as spiritualist writers like Sara Weiss. Weiss’s spiritualism in her Decimon Huydas, a Romance of Mars: A Story of Actual Experiences into Ento, Mars, Many Centuries Ago Given to the Psychic (1906) could be now called science fiction. In Virginia Woolf’s Orlando (1928), we encounter sex changes several times. Shortly, female writers, long before the term science fiction started to be used, featured some science fiction elements to express things that could not be expressed in any other medium. 1. The First Wave Women’s Science Fiction (The Magazine/Pulp Era, 1920s-1950s) The First Wave women’s science fiction appeared in the birth of magazine form, grew throughout 1930s and 1940s, and matured in 1950s “when it evolved into a recognizable ‘female counter-culture’ to the dominant male culture.”154 During the magazine era, some proto-science fiction by female writers appeared in pulp-fiction form. Women writers were interested in the adventure pulps such as detective fiction. In 1866, Metta Victoria Fuller Victor, under the name of “Seeley Regester”, published the first detective novel, The Dead Letter. Another detective fiction was The Leavenworth Case (1878) by Anna Katharine Green. Between the years of two World Wars, women writers such as Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Josephine Tey, Ngaio Marsh and Margery Allingham dominated in 154\n\nIbid., 57. 30\n\nBuran, Sümeyra.

As Davin asserts, “although presumed to be entirely a ‘man’s world,’ detective pulps regularly featured female authors writing under their own name, including such well-known authors as Sayer, Carolyn Wells, and Christie.”155 For example, some American detective pulps such as Detective Fiction Weekly, Mystery Magazine, Flynn’s Weekly, and Street & Smith’s Detective Story156 published some of Christie’s novels and twenty of her short stories and she published in other magazines like Ghost Stories and Blue Mask, as well. Black Mask, one of the famous detective pulps, regularly published the works of female authors under their own names such as Florence M. Pettee, Elizabeth Dudley, Sally Dixon Wright, Eliza Mae Harvey, Helen Holley, Wyona Dashwood, and Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, Marian O’Hearn, Kay Krausse, Leigh Brackett, Frances Beck, Tiah Devitt, Dorothy Dunn. Some of them later made their names in science fiction, for example, Brackett wrote hard-boiled detective fiction between 1943 and 1945 and “Hollywood hired her in 1946 to co-author, with William Faulkner, the screenplay of Chandler’s classic novel, The Big Sleep, which became the film of the same name starring Humphrey Bogard and Lauren Bacall.”157 Nevertheless, women authors in pulp-fiction could be classified as protoscience fiction writers as they held science fiction elements in their works. For example, Katherine Kip published her short story “My Invisible Friend” in the Black Cat (February 1897) which tells the story of a scientist’s invention of liquid that causes the invisibility as H. G. Wells’s The Invisible Man, but printed before it. In the same way, Octavia Zollicoffer Bond’s “A Rule That Worked Both Ways” ("
