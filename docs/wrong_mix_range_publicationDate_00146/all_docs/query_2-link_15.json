        "text": "✓\n\nVillain Overview\n\n“ NO! I am not taking no more charity...not from kin, not from friends, and especially not no damn government! The taste of it rots in my mouth! I'm gonna get me power over my own life! And heaven help the one who tries to take that power from me!! „ ~ Amanda Waller to her sister.\n\n“ What brings you to see the great and powerful Amanda Waller?! „ ~ Amanda Waller addressing those who greet her.\n\nAmanda Waller is a major character in the DC Universe, mostly of the Justice League and Suicide Squad franchises.\n\nShe has had various and very different incarnations throughout her history, but is almost always a hard-line top-ranking U.S. Government agent involved in clandestine operations. She has always been and more often than not, depicted as a middle age African-American woman, she tends to be of the heavy-set variety (though thinner, slimmer versions of her have also appeared in her New 52 storylines and her Arrowverse counterpart).\n\nWaller is noted to be known for her extreme ruthless and manipulative nature, willing to protect the world crossing any moral length to achieve her goals. She is also the leader of Task Force X (AKA the Suicide Squad), a group of supervillains that are force to work with Waller under the threat of a bomb implanted in their neck.\n\nBiography[]\n\nOrigin[]\n\nBorn and raised in the crime-ridden Cabrini-Green area of Chicago, the woman that would become one of the U.S. government's highest-ranking agents and most feared in the world was just an ordinary young woman. She married her sweetheart Joseph Waller at the age of 18.\n\nQuickly having a large family, her first child Joe, Jr., then Damita, then the twins Martin and Jessie, and then her youngest child Coretta. While their lives were a financial struggle, and they often relied on social welfare programs, they were happy. However, tragedy struck the Waller family when her oldest son Joe, Jr. was killed in a mugging gone wrong, and her daughter Damita was raped and brutally murdered on her way home from church.\n\nWhile they knew that the serial killer known as Candyman was responsible for Damita's murder, the police could not get a conviction because no one dared testify against him. Joseph set out to kill Candyman, and both men shot each other dead. It was through these tragic events that would change Waller - she swore that the streets would take no more of her family and she wouldn't rely on or accept help from the government that failed her.\n\nModern Age[]\n\nWith a renewed prospective on life, Waller took on multiple jobs as she worked hard to put all her younger children through college and then herself as she went through college and earned a political science degree. She then decided to go into politics, and approached a democratic congressional candidate named Marvin Collins to become his campaign director.\n\nThanks to her efforts and skills, Collins was elected, and he took her with him to Washington as his aide. It was there that Waller discovered old files on a clandestine secret agency and supervisory organization called Task Force X while searching through old bills, and asked to revive the program as the colorfully named Suicide Squad under her direction.\n\nThe New 52[]\n\nWhen DC later rebooted their series into the New 52, Waller was given a much younger and slimmer appearance. In this continuity, other than the Suicide Squad, she is also involved with Team 7 and is one of the founders of the Justice League of America to undermine the main Justice League team (in this continuity the JLA is a separate group from the JL).\n\nFollowing the release of the DC Rebirth event, Waller returned to her more classic appearance.\n\nDawn of DC[]\n\nDuring the Dawn of DC, Waller joined the Council of Light and allied herself with Trigon, using the accidental transformation of several heroes and villains into animals during the \"Beast World\" event as an excuse to launch a campaign to rid of all metahuman people on Earth. However, she's also been using some super-powered people for her own purposes, like the demon-hybrid Doctor Hate, the alien Brainiac Queen, and the cyborg Failsafe.\n\nOther Media[]\n\nTelevision[]\n\nJustice League Unlimited[]\n\nMain article: Amanda Waller (DC Animated Universe)\n\nAmanda Waller was one of the stand-out major antagonists and anti-heroes of the Justice League Unlimited cartoon series. She was voiced by CCH Pounder.\n\nIn the show, Waller's history is reworked as an already influential government official and the puppeteer of a shadow government of Cadmus. In the show, Waller helped establish Cadmus after Superman's assault on Earth while being controlled by Darkseid.\n\nThough Superman would be freed from Darkseid's control and sought out to make amends, many officials began to consider back-up plans to protect the US and world in general if one of their superheroes ever went rogue again. When Earth was invaded by the Justice Lords, versions of the Justice League from an alternate reality, officials previously only spooked began to put together an initiative called Cadmus and Amanda Waller was its founding member.\n\nWaller devoted herself to preparing for the next time the Justice League decided to turn on humanity by doing things like growing her own bio engineered super-heroes, programmed to be loyal to her.\n\nCollecting DNA from Supergirl to make a clone loyal to Cadmus, spying on the members of the Justice League, kidnapping and attempting to brainwash mutants from around the country as an elite anti-superhero crew, freeing Lex Luthor from jail and sponsoring his bid for Presidency of the United States.\n\nLex Luthor gave Cadmus a one-of-a-kind prototype gun created to permanently rob a metahuman of their superpowers used once to de-power the Justice Lords, in exchange for the gun and his financial backing of Cadmus to get it off the ground Amanda Waller was Luthor's friend in high places, although she never fully trusted him.\n\nLuthor eventually turned against Waller and Cadmus by hijacking the Watch Tower's energy gun and attempted to destroy Cadmus' base of operations, fortunately Waller had the foresight to move the base before-hand fearing implication if the Justice League raided the base. Waller followed up on a lead from Batman about the attack being controlled remotely from an outside source and quickly found the signal linking back to Luthor.\n\nLuthor had set off the attack to implicate the Justice League, get rid of his debts to Cadmus and destroy any obstacles that could shut down his grand scheme to up-load his brain into an advanced android based on the Amazo android, granting him what her saw as god-hood.\n\nWaller arrived just in time to destroy the android Lex was planning on using as a new body. As the Justice League arrived, Amanda shot Luthor point blank range with an energy rifle as thanks for his treachery, however his body regenerates revealing Lex Luthor was an avatar for Brainiac. Unbeknownst to Luthor, his decisions up until that point had been subconsciously influenced by a piece of the evil AI implanted as genetic code in Luthor long ago.\n\nWaller still had a back-up plan though and siced the Justice League on Brainiac/Luthor when he proved more than she was prepared for. After the experience and a public scandal revealing the influences of Cadmus in Luthor's political campaign Cadmus is shut down by the government, though Amanda and other heads of Cadmus were spared arrest much of their previous official powers were destroyed, reducing most of them to normal bureaucrats.\n\nAmanda still had the right clout to make things happen behind the scenes though, just not in any official capacity anymore and knew enough to pretend she had been robbed of all her influence like the other members of Cadmus. 65 years after the events of Justice League Unlimited 's era, Amanda Waller is still alive and kicking as a retired but still powerful woman feared in underworld circles.\n\nIn her old age, Waller admits that at a certain point she began to fear less of what would happen if the super-heroes of the world went rogue and more of what the world would do without them. To that end, she created a clone of Bruce Wayne named Terry McGinnis.\n\nTerry was raised by Warren and Mary McGinnis, whom Waller hired assassin Andrea Beaumont to kill in order to create the same kind of tragic circumstances that led Bruce Wayne to become Batman. Unwilling to orphan an innocent child, Beaumont refused the job, but Warren would be murdered anyway by Mr. Fixx and Derek Powers, influencing McGinnis to become the elderly Bruce Wayne's successor as Batman.\n\nWhen Terry found out his DNA matched Bruce’s, he went to Amanda’s house as she knew this was bound to happen. She told him about everything he wanted to know and reassured that Terry is not a clone, but Bruce’s son. She also stated that Terry still can make his own choice.\n\nSmallville[]\n\nAmanda Waller appeared in the Ninth Season portrayed by Pam Grier. Waller was the ruthless White Queen of Checkmate who hired Cameron Mahkent aka Icicle II to hunt down and kill members of the Justice Society of America, using his anger towards them as a catalyst. She later sent clues to Lois Lane about the JSA and Icicle to which she began investigating.\n\nAfter giving Lois time to investigate, Waller visited her, telling her that she planted the classified information and gave her a phone before leaving, all this without introducing herself. When Icicle failed in his mission, Waller took him into custody and revealed that he had actually succeeded, having been used in order to shake up the JSA and bring them back together.\n\nShe then aimed a gun at him and said \"Welcome to the Suicide Squad\" before shooting him. Waller then met up with Tess Mercer in the Checkmate base, at which point revealing that Tess is a Checkmate agent.\n\nWhen Tess failed to kidnap Green Arrow and recruit him for the government, Waller threatened to terminate her. Later, at the Checkmate Castle, John Jones attempted to destroy the Kandorian blood sample that Dr. Chisholm took from the Kandorians, but Waller managed to trap the Martian Manhunter in a fire cage.\n\nAfter taking her form to fool a Checkmate agent, John escaped. Later, while she was in her office, Waller had her men kidnap Watchtower. When The Blur came into Waller's office, she showed that she had Chloe and that she knew what she's doing.\n\nWhen she finally made Clark step into the light to reveal his identity, the power went out. After Clark and Chloe escaped, the Martian Manhunter came back to the Castle and erased her memory of Clark, Chloe and Oliver's identities. She later found a Red Queen on her chess board and swiped it off in anger, realizing that she wasn't the only player in the game.\n\nWaller had her men search for Tess until she realized where the Kandorians were. When she and her men had captured them, she ordered her men to execute the Kandorians. Clark, as the Blur, arrived just in time to save them all, except for Faora, whom Waller took and was talking with. As Waller was threatening Faora, Major Zod arrived and threw her into her car windshield.\n\nFortunately for her, Clark came just in time to stop Zod from murdering Waller. Waller later told Stuart Campbell that he needed to stop his mission against Tess, but he ignored her order. Later, Zod tracked Checkmate down and, as Amanda and Stuart were in the hallway, he used his heat vision to burn down the castle, as she told him to run. Waller and Campbell's fate are unknown.\n\nYoung Justice[]\n\nIn this series, Amanda Waller is the former warden of Belle Reve Penitentiary. She is portrayed as tough, intimidating, stubborn, and harsh, traits required for a job as intense as warden of Belle Reve. Even when in danger, her strong attitude is just as salient, as exhibited during the prisoner takeover of Belle Reve.\n\nUnbeknownst to Waller, Superboy and Miss Martian were on an undercover mission at Belle Reve as Tommy and Tuppence Terror.\n\nWhen they arrived along with Mister Freeze and Icicle Jr., Waller introduced herself and explained the basics of the inhibitor collars. She then stated the prison walls were thick enough to hold even Superman, and went on to say that no one had and never would escape Belle Reve.\n\nAfter a \"scuffle\" in the mess hall, Mr Freeze was brought before Waller. Freeze froze the prison guard, and broke his cuffs with an ice gauntlet. Waller activated his collar, but Freeze tore it off, and froze Waller's arm before she could fire a gun. Freeze shut down the collars and cell doors, allowing the prisoners to break free. He imprisoned Waller, Dr. Hugo Strange, and the guards in the cells.\n\nWhen Brick taunted Waller about being warm due to their thermal uniforms, Waller incited him. Brick grabbed her through the bars menacingly, but Hugo Strange convinced him to spare her.\n\nEventually, Superboy (still disguised as Tommy Terror), turned the collars back on. This angered Icicle Sr., who assumed it was Waller. He confronted her and as he was about to land a blow, Hugo tackled Icicle Sr. and knocked him out. After Superboy walked out with Miss Martian, the prisoners were put back in their cells, and Belle Reve was scheduled to be up and running the next day.\n\nUnfortunately, the breakout attempt cost Waller her job as warden, and she was replaced by Hugo Strange.\n\nArrow[]\n\nMain article: Amanda Waller (Arrowverse)\n\nIn this series, Amanda Waller is the leader of A.R.G.U.S.. In the season 2 episode \"Keep Your Enemies Closer\", she captures John telling him that she needs his help to rescue Lyla Michaels as she has gone dark in Moscow. She parts with a statement saying that A.R.G.U.S. are aware of what Oliver and him do at night. In the end of the episode \"Tremors\" she takes Bronze Tiger out of jail and recruits him for the Suicide Squad.\n\nMy Adventures With Superman[]\n\nMain article: Amanda Waller (My Adventures With Superman)\n\nAmanda Waller serves as one of major antagonists of the series.\n\nDC Universe (James Gunn)[]\n\nMain article: Amanda Waller (DC Extended Universe)\n\nAmanda Waller is set to appear in both Waller and Creature Commandos, both series will take place in the new DC Universe multimedia franchise by James Gunn. Viola Davis has been confirmed to reprise the role despite this being a reboot.\n\nMovies[]\n\nSuperman/Batman: Public Enemies[]\n\nAmanda Waller appeared in the movie adaptation Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, with C. C. H. Pounder reprising her role. This version is depicted as more sympathetic, betraying President Lex Luthor's offer of a prominent position in his \"new world order\" to provide Superman and Batman with information that they can use to destroy a Kryptonite Asteroid that is heading for Earth.\n\nGreen Lantern (2011)[]\n\nAmanda Waller appeared in the live-action Green Lantern film, where she is played by Angela Bassett. This version is a scientist who works for the DEO under the command of Senator Robert Hammond, father of xenobiologist Hector Hammond. After Hector acquires the power to read minds from exposure to Parallax's DNA (a fragment of which remained in the body of Abin Sur until Hammond was called on to perform the autopsy), contact with Waller reveals that her family was killed by an unidentified gunman when she was younger.\n\nHammond attempts to kill her using his telekinetic powers in a later confrontation, but Green Lantern caught her in a ring-formed 'pool' of water that subsequently carried her out of harm's way.\n\nBatman: Assault on Arkham[]\n\nAmanda Waller appeared as the main antagonist of the animated movie, Batman: Assault on Arkham.\n\nFor the backdrop of the story, Waller puts together the Suicide Squad on a special mission: infiltrate Arkham Asylum and take down the Riddler, who has stolen top secret information on potential Squad members from Waller's COMPUTER. During the mission, Killer Frost learns that there is no information, and the real reason is Riddler knows how to disarm the nanobombs in their necks. After realizing that the Suicide Squad knows how to disarm the bombs, she attempts to detonate them, only to kill King Shark and Black Spider, the latter of whom at the time was in Batman's batsuit due to Batman stealing his so he could be closer to the Suicide Squad.\n\nAt the end of the film, Batman confronts her in her office where Batman warns her to stop her games and there won't be a next time, where she mocks Batman telling him that she is the U.S. Government and no one can stop them. Batman leaves in the middle of the conversation, which she calls Batman a punk after noticing it. When she turns around, she notices a laser sight on her chest and then moves between her eyes.\n\nShe realizes it is Deadshot taking revenge and only lets out a shocked \"motherf-\" (the remaining part of the f-word is omitted due to it zooming out). Deadshot is shown in the distance with his daughter. As Deadshot is shown peering through his sniper, he says aloud \"Bang\" before smiling. Her assassination was prevented thanks to Batman.\n\nBatman: Hush[]\n\nAmanda Waller appeared in Batman: Hush. When captured Bane and took him to Arkham, she attempt to get him to join the Suicide Squad. However, Bane is out of control. With the help from Batman, Waller captured Bane and used the nerve toxin to knock Bane unconscious.\n\nSuicide Squad: Hell to Pay[]\n\nAfter Ocean Master's defeat by the Justice League, Amanda sent her Suicide Squad (Deadshot, Black Manta, Count Vertigo, Punch and Jewelee) to collect information from Tobias Whale. When Vertigo and Jewelee betrayed the Squad and killed Punch, Waller detonated their nano-bombs only blowing up Vertigo's head. When Jewelee was killed by Deadshot, Lawton told Waller to turn off the bomb which questioning Floyd if it's mercy killing or he went soft on her.\n\nWaller once again assemble the Suicide Squad (Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Copperhead, Killer Frost and Bronze Tiger) to get a valuable card from Vandal Savage; yet her motivation was due to a terminal brain tumor, and with her lifetime of unethical violence and manipulation, she is desperate for the Get Out of Hell Free card to avoid afterlife repercussions.\n\nHowever, Killer Frost was saved by Professor Zoom/Reverse Flash for the price of getting the card for himself.\n\nWhen Copperhead holding the traitorous Killer Frost long enough, Waller detonated Copperhead's nano bomb to kill both Copperhead and Killer Frost.\n\nAfter the deaths of both Professor Zoom and Bronze Tiger, Deadshot gives Waller the now-useless card - as its one use was taken when Deadshot let the dying Tiger hold the card - and she is annoyed when seeing Harley is still alive. Waller removed the nano bombs of the remaining members of the Suicide Squad and commuting Lawton's sentence so he could be with his daughter, Zoe.\n\nJustice League Dark: Apokolips War[]\n\nSometime during the two year occupation of Earth by Darkseid, the brain tumor spread until the cancer killed Amanda Waller. Due to the chaotic state of the world, Harley Quinn took her place as commander of the Suicide Squad, moving the team to be based in Stryker's Island Prison.\n\nSince Constantine convinced the Flash to trigger another Flashpoint, it is plausible that Waller was returned to life as a new person in the new reality.\n\nDC Extended Universe[]\n\nMain article: Amanda Waller (DC Extended Universe)\n\nAmanda Waller appeared in the 2016 movie Suicide Squad where she convinced the government to allow her to create the Task Force X as a last way to save the United States from alien or metahuman attacks. Unintentionally, this results in the Enchantress being set loose on Midway City, where Waller and a group of ARGUS agents are located. The Squad is sent into the city to retrieve Waller but Waller's escape helicopter is destroyed by Enchantress' brother Incubus. Amanda is ultimately saved by the Suicide Squad but true to her cold-hearted nature forces the team members to resume their prison sentence but only gives Deadshot to spend his time with his daughter, Zoe.\n\nAmanda Waller returned in the sequel film, The Suicide Squad, where she, once again, acts as the director of Task Force X. In the film, Waller organizes an undercover mission in the south american country, Corto Maltese, in order to investigate and destroy an ominous project called \"Project Starfish\". In order to create a brand new Suicide Squad, Waller blackmails the mercenary Bloodsport by threatening to arrest or kill his daughter if he doesn't join the team. With the Squad set up and divided in two branches, Team A and Team B, she begins the invasion of Corto Maltese. After Team A is entirely massacred by the army (with the exception of Harley Quinn), Waller becomes the sole commander of Team B, comprised of Bloodsport, Ratcatcher 2, Peacemaker, King Shark and Polka Dot Man. It is eventually revealed that the real purpose of the mission was to destroy the evidence of the involvment of the american government in Project Starfish. After Starro is accidentally released and starts attacking the city, Waller advises the Suicide Squad to retreat, as their mission was over, but the team ends up turning against her and disobeying her orders, going back to the city in order to kill Starro. Waller then threatens to kill them all by activating their neck bombs, but is knocked out before she can do anything. Upon Starro's death, and at the end of the movie, Bloodsport strikes a deal with her where she has to release his daughter and set him free or else he would leak all the information about Project Starfish to the public.\n\nVideo games[]\n\nInjustice[]\n\nIn the comic, Waller appears in the Quiver to capture Harley Quinn with her team. When Harley gets away, she orders Deadshot to stop her, to which he succeeded. Later when Harley wakes up in her base, she welcomes her in the Suicide Squad due to the fact that she now has a bomb in her head. When a guard is neutralized by a Batman, Amanda tells him that he can't go in a government facility like that. This Batman imposter thanks her before shooting her and Rick in the face, killing them both.\n\nDC Universe Online[]\n\nAmanda Waller appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Debra Cole. In the Bludhaven Alert, Major Force mentioned to the players that Waller has sent him to Bludhaven to gather samples of Chemo and to test out the Chemoids.\n\nBatman: Arkham[]\n\nMain article: Amanda Waller (Arkhamverse)\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins[]\n\nAmanda makes a brief appearance in a post-credits cutscene in Batman: Arkham Origins. She enters Blackgate Prison and gives Deathstroke the opportunity to work for the Suicide Squad. Like her Justice League Unlimited counterpart, she is voiced by CCH Pounder.\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins Blackgate[]\n\nWaller appears as the overarching antagonist of Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate. She anonymously hires Catwoman to break Bane out of Blackgate.\n\nBatman: The Enemy Within[]\n\nMain article: Amanda Waller (Telltale)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAmanda Waller is typically portrayed as very overweight, although she also sometimes only slightly obese or even athletic.\n\n[]\n\nAmanda Waller on the DC Database Wiki\n\nAmanda Waller on the Heroes Wiki\n\nNavigation[]\n\nVillains\n\nComics\n\n2-Face-2 | Abraham Langstrom | Alfred Protocol | Alfred Stryker | Alice | Amanda Waller | Amygdala | Anarky | An Innocent Guy | Ares | Arkham Knight | Arnold Flass | Azrael | Baby Doll | Bane | Barbatos | Batman of Zur-En-Arrh | Bat-Mite | The Batman Who Laughs | Bizarro | Black Glove | Black Mask | Blockbuster I | Blockbuster II | Brain | Brainiac | Broker | Bronze Tiger | Brother EYE | Bruno | Calculator | Calender Man | Castle Bat | Captain Fear | Captain Boomerang | Captain Cold | Carmine Falcone | Catman | Catwoman | Cheetah | Cheshire | Circus of Strange | Clayface | Clayface (Matt Hagen) | Claything | Clock King | Clownface | Club of Villains | Cluemaster | Composite Superman | Condiment King | Colony | Copperhead | Cornelius Stirk | Court of Owls | Crazy Quilt | Crime Doctor | Curtis Base | Dark Archer | David Cain | David Li | Darkseid | Dark Knights | Daniel Captio | Deacon Blackfire | Deadshot | Dealer | Deathstroke | Devil Nezha | Dick Grayson (DC vs Vampires) | The Dawnbreaker | The Devastator | Dr. Crane | Doctor Death | Doctor Double X | Doctor Phosphorus | Doctor Randolph Porter | Doomsday | Dollmaker | Donna Troy | Dr. Silversmith | The Drowned | Eggers | Electrocutioner | Emperor Penguin | Enigma | The Eraser | Ernie Chubb | Failsafe | Faceless | False-Face | Falcone Crime Family | Film Freak | Fun Haus | Firebug | Firefly | Flamingo | Floronic Man | Gearhead | General Ulysses Armstrong | Gilda Dent | Gorilla Boss | Gorilla Grodd | Gotham City Police Department | Gillian B.
