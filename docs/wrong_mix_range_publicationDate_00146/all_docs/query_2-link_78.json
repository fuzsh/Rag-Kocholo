        "text": "HUMAN FACTORS\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe space environment is so inconvenient for human beings. There is so much that one has to bring along to keep them alive.\n\nLife Support has to supply each crew member daily with 0.0576 kilograms of air, about 0.98 kilograms of water, and about 2.3 kilograms of (wet) food (less if you are recycling). Some kind of artificial gravity or a medical way to keep the bones and muscles from wasting away. Protection from the deadly radiation from solar storms and the ship's power plant and propulsion system. Protection from the temperature extremes in the space environment. Protection from acceleration. Medical support. And then there are the psychological factors.\n\nRecently John Lumpkin and I were allowed the rare privilege of submitting questions to NASA astronaut Captain Stephen G. Bowen a couple of questions about life in the space environment.\n\nAcceleration Protection\n\nThe bottom line seems to be the acceleration should be limited to 4g or less if you want the astronauts capable of using their hands on controls, and limit it to 17g while sitting down or 30g while lying flat to prevent serious injury to the astronauts. But only for less than 10 minutes or so, see graph below for details. This is usually not a problem unless you are dealing with a torchship. Conventional spacecraft cannot accelerate at that rate for much longer than 10 minutes before their propellant tanks run dry.\n\nNote that the piloting controls will need to be specially designed to be used under 4gs, you ain't gonna be able to do fussy fine control when your arms weighs 20 kilograms each.\n\nIn the science-fictional role playing game Universe, people with enough money can have an \"internal gravity web\" surgically implanted. This is a series of strong nets anchored to bone that support the internal organs. It allows the person to undergo accelerations larger than 2.5g indefinitely with no ill effects.\n\nAcceleration PositionsNameCoordDescriptionVerticularAssessmentTransverse forces supine+GxLying on your backEye Balls InRecommended high acceleration positionTransverse forces prone-GxLying face downEye Balls OutSecond-best high acceleration positionPositive longitudinal+GzSitting with head above heartEye Balls UpThird-best high acceleration positionNegative longitudinal-GzStanding on your headEye Balls DownReally stupid\n\nProne Acceleration\n\nI would have thought that lying prone was a bad way to take high acceleration, because you can't breath. But then I saw the image above.\n\nWhen it came to piloting aircraft, both prone and supine allowed the pilot to take much higher acceleration than sitting normally. This is because in the sitting posture the body and legs are a long distance below the brain, and acceleration drags all the blood in the pilot's body downward; i.e., out of the brain causing blackout. Prone or supine means the blood cannot be yanked very far downward from the brain.\n\nBut prone made it very difficult for the pilot to look upward, and supine made it very difficult to look downward. So prone with a bubble window was better for:\n\nFighter airplanes with speed superior to their opponents\n\nBombers\n\nHigh speed reconnaissance airplanes\n\nAirplanes that operate or attack at angles greater than 30°\n\nFor other types of aircraft, the drawbacks of prone position outweighed the superior acceleration endurance. In particular, it is hard for a pilot to make the aircraft climb if they cannot turn their head to look upward.\n\nAfter some research I stumbled over the report Human Capabilities In The Prone And Supine Positions: An Annotated Bibliography. Remember that \"supine\" means \"eyeballs-in on-your-back\" while \"prone\" means \"eyeballs-out on-your-stomach\". \"Semi-prone\" means prone but the knees are significantly lower than the body.\n\nThe prone position of the pilot in high-speed airplanes has certain advantages (higher g-tolerance of the pilot, reduction of drag due to decrease of frontal area, improved instrument visibility) and drawbacks (narrowing of field of vision, decrease of visual acuity, aggravation of claustrophobic tendencies, discomfort encountered in this abnormal position). A nylon bed designed in 1948 by the Aero Medical Laboratory was tested for 8 to 12 hours without apparent signs of discomfort. Three-dimensional hand control (i.e. operation of all the control surfaces by band motions only) likewise gave good test results. Restriction of vision (up to 35°) was one of the major complaints raised by the test pilots.\n\nThe paper concludes with a brief discussion of flight tests at accelerations of less than 1 g, as would be encountered in space flight. The prone pilot was instrumented for recording of heart rate and electrocardiagram. He was asked to shake his head and to nod during the runs at zero g. There were no ill effects following these movements, but after the subgravity flight there was frequent vertigo. Coordination was not impaired, although there was tendency to overreach.\n\nWill prone flight lick high g-loads? AVIATION WEEK v. 57, n. 26, p. 21-22, 24-25, 29 Dec 1952\n\nThe changes produced by body posture on total lung capacity and its subdivisions have been reported for all positions except the prone position.\n\nTwenty normal subjects, twelve males and eight females, had determinations of total lung capacity in the three body positions, sitting, supine and prone. Tidal volume, minute ventilation and O2 consumption were also measured.\n\nThe changes found on assumption of the supine position from the sitting position were similar to those previously reported. For the prone position, a smaller inspiratory capacity and a larger expiratory reserve volume were found. The mean values were changed, respectively, 8% and +37%. Association with these changes was a significant increase of the functional residual capacity by 636 ml.\n\nVentilation did not change significantly from that found during sitting, unlike the findings associated with the supine position, in which the tidal volume was decreased. Respiratory frequency remained the same for all positions.\n\nEffect of body posture on lung volumes. JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY 16, n. 1, p. 27-29, Jan 1961.\n\nThe \"B.9\" is a twin engine, cantilever, low-wing monoplane of composite conotruction, stressed for an ultimate factor of 22g. The pilot is placed in the fuselage nose.\n\nThe bed on which the pilot lies is provided with fore and aft adjustment and an adjustable chin rest. There are arm rests, and the legs are slightly bent. A back parachute replaces the conventional chest-type parachute. Modified stick controls (in preference to wheel controls) are used. Brakes and rudder are controlled by the feet in the conventional manner. All secondary controls and switches are situated on the port side of the fuselage.\n\nThe prone position was considered comfortable by the pilots. Fatigue was experienced by some in the nape of the neck and the shoulders. The chin rest was considered disturbing in horizontal flijht. The relative position of the field of view, as compared to the seated position, shifted into a position with the main line of vision declined 300 below the horizon. Flight handling was not encountered difficult. The feeling of \"suspension\" was absent in the vertical dive. Maximum accelerations of 8.5 g in pullouts and 6 g in steep spirals were tolerated over several seconds.\n\nInvestigations of the prone position for pilots. ZENTRALE FUER WISSENSCHAFTLICHS BERICHTSWESIEN DER LUFTFAHRTFORSCHUNG (BERLIN) UM 1297, 13 May 1944.\n\nNaturally an acceleration couch for a quadruped such as a dog or a centaur-like alien will probably be a prone couch. Think about the problems of a horse in a spaceship lying on its back with all four legs in the air and you'll see what I mean.\n\nAcceleration Couches\n\nAn acceleration couch is a chair that will hold an astronaut in relative comfort under several gs of acceleration. The Apollo crew's acceleration couches only had to protect the crew from a maximum of 4gs on lift-off, and about 7gs during reentry.\n\nIn The Mote in God's Eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, the couches had a built-in \"relief tube\" (i.e., a rudimentary urinal) for use during prolonged periods of multi-g acceleration. For various reasons military crews were all stag, no women allowed.\n\nFlotation Mattress\n\nIf you have a torchship, and it is going to accelerate at more than one g for longer than a few minutes, the crew is going to need special couches to lie in. Otherwise the g forces will cause severe injury or even kill. A standard Apollo couch just ain't gonna cut the mustard. You are going to need something more fancy.\n\nThe next step up is an advanced waterbeds or flotation mattress. The astronaut lies on a big flexible plastic bag full of water. The water automatically conforms to the contours of the astronaut's body.\n\nIn Robert Heinlein's Sky Lift and Double Star these are called called \"cider presses\" for sarcastic reasons. The water mattress is the fruit and the astronaut is the piston.\n\nIn The Mote in God's Eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle the flotation chairs were supplemented by a few motorized acceleration couches used by damage control parties who had to move around during high gs. Such mobile couches also appeared in Joe Haldeman's The Forever War.\n\nLiquid Breathing\n\nIn the real world, liquid breathing is a technique with applications to ultra-deep ocean diving. Past a certain depth the water pressure will crush a diver's lungs into pulp. But since fluid is incompressible, filling the lungs with fluid instead of gasous breathing mix will provide protection. They do not quite have the technique ready for commercial use, yet, but they are working on it. A gentleman named Arnold Lande patented a liquid breathing scuba suit in 2010.\n\nYou can see this in the movie The Abyss. The bit with the man is special effect, but the part with the rat is real.\n\nSince multiple gravities of acceleration stress the internal organs much like water pressure, fluid breathing could provide acceleration protection as well.\n\nHandwavium Anti-Acceleration\n\nForeseeably science fiction has several choice examples of acceleration protection constructed out of pure handwavium, mostly described as some kind of magic force field. They are amusing but I wouldn't take any of them seriously.\n\nCommon scifi names include acceleration compensator, deceleration compensator, inertial compensator, deceleration equalizer, and drive compensator. Sometimes scifi misuses the term \"inertial damper\" which has a very different and very mundane meaning, the proper term is Inertial Negation.\n\nIn addition to the drives mentioned here, there is also the broad classs of carrot-on-a-stick drives. These avoid killing the crew by high acceleration by virtue of using handwavium paragravity for acceleration. Since gravity (or paragravity) accelerates all the atoms of of both the ship and crew evenly, the crew will be in free fall regardless of how massive the acceleration is. In other words, there is acceleration, but there is no acceleration differential between the ship and the crew (or between the various internal organs inside each crew member).\n\nThese are handwavium, with the exception of Charles Sheffield's \"Balanced Drive.\" It is more unobtainium, we can't build the blasted thing but it does not break any of the laws of physics (it is really really hard to make a disk one hundred meters in diameter and one meter thick with the mass of Mount Everest). It sure looks like a handwavium carrot-on-a-stick drive, but it isn't.\n\nHandwavium acceleration protection includes:\n\nis a consequence of the definition of momentum, (which in a way is more fundamental since it directly ties in with ) and inertial mass appear to be equal. At least in my old school physics textbook (early 1980s!) this was presented as a cool unsolved mystery, but it is a consequence of the equivalence principle in general relativity (1907): all test particles accelerate the same way in a gravitational field, and this is only possible if their gravitational mass and inertial mass are proportional to one another. , the force law and the formula for kinetic energy . is the effect of the magic field, running from , with 1 corresponding to it being absent. . Now the momentum and kinetic energy jumps by a factor of 1000 if the velocity remains unchanged. Were I to catch the ball I would have gained 999 times its original kinetic energy: this looks like an excellent perpetual motion machine. Since we do not want that to be possible (a space empire powered by throwing ping-pong balls sounds silly) we must demand that energy is conserved. . Inertia-increasing fields slow down objects, while inertia-decreasing fields speed them up. field around itself and boost its speed by a huge factor. Sounds very useful. But now an impacting meteorite will both have an high relative speed, and when it enters the field get that boosted by the same factor again: impacts will happen at velocities increased by a factor of as measured by the ship. So boosting your speed with a factor of a 1000 will give you dust hitting you at speeds a million times higher. Since typical interplanetary dust already moves a few km/s, we are talking about hyperrelativistic impactors. The armour above sounds like a good thing to have… accelerating it along the length bore, it will pick up Joules of kinetic energy from the work the cannon does – independent of mass or inertia! The difference may be power: if you can only supply a certain energy per second like in a coilgun, having a slower projectile in the bore is better. : it becomes far higher in the inertia-dampening field, producing helium-voice like effects. Air molecules inside an inertia-decreasing field would tend to leave more quickly than outside air would enter, producing a pressure difference. , momentum and energy , it reduces is inertia and increases the speed to , keeps the kinetic energy at , and the momentum is now . machine with an object it experiences a force enough to change its velocity by . When set to increase inertia it is pushed back a bit, potentially moving up to speed . When set to decrease inertia it is pushed forward, starting to move towards the direction the object impacted from. In fact, it can get arbitrarily large velocities by reducing close to 0. (giving the above formula) and , which insists that . Clearly we cannot have both. ), which would look like changing both energy and normal momentum at the same time. , the new kinetic energy would be . Just like in the kinetic energy preserving case the object slows down (or speeds up), but more strongly. And there is an energy debt of that needs to be fixed. . The really tricky case is if you are in energy-debt: you have an object of lowered inertia in the field, and cut the power. Now the object needs to get a bunch of kinetic energy from somewhere. Sudden absorption of nearby kinetic energy, freezing stuff nearby? That would break thermodynamics (I could set up a perpetual motion heat engine this way). Leaving the inertia-changed object with the changed inertia? That would mean there could be objects and particles with any effective mass – space might eventually be littered with atoms with altered inertia, becoming part of normal chemistry and physics. No such atoms have ever been found, but maybe that is because alien predecessor civilisations were careful with inertial pollution. . This means that paramagnetic materials become more strongly affected by magnetic fields, and that ferromagnets are boosted. Conversely, higher inertia reduces magnetic effects. from the place where the observer is, but not inside their field). Strong enough fields will cause shifts so that absorption and transmission outside the visual range will matter, e.g. infrared or UV becomes visible. where k is the wave vector. So we could assume a factor of or gets in there and the field red/blueshifts photons. This would complicate things a lot, so I will leave analysis to the interested reader. But it would likely make inertics fields visible due to refractive effects. , is the reduced mass. In short, the inertial manipulation field scales the energy levels up and down proportionally. One effect is that it becomes much easier to ionise low-inertia materials, and that materials that are normally held together by ionization bonds (say NaCl salt) may spontaneously decay when in high-inertia fields. : low-inertia atoms become larger. This really messes with materials. Placed in a low-inertia field atoms expand, making objects such as metals inflate. In a high inertia-field, electrons keep closer to the nuclei and objects shrink. to 0.99 or 1.01 would be enough to create many of the bad effects of high fever or hypothermia, and a bit more would be directly lethal as proteins denaturate. and this also changes their gravitational mass. The equivalence principle still holds. kg asteroid mass black hole to implode the Earth. And the while the bulk of the spacecraft is surrounded by other fields. A failure of this counter-inertics field does not just instantly turn the crew into tuna paste, but into blue toxic tuna paste.\n\nSuspended Animation\n\nThe ability to put crew members to sleep for months at a time would be an awfully convenient thing to have. Such crew members would use air and food at a much reduced rate and would not be prey to interplanetary cabin fever or space cafard.\n\nHibernation or \"cold-sleep\" would mimic what bears and squirrels do in the winter. The crewmember would sleep and breath slowly. Food would be administered by an intravenous pump or the body's internal fat could be used. The crew member still ages, abet at a slighly slower rate.\n\nSuspended animation, cryo-freeze, or cryogenic suspension is more extreme. The crewmember is frozen solid in liquid nitrogen. They do not breath, eat, nor age. Special techniques must be used to prevent the ice in the body's cells from freezing into tiny jagged knives shredding the organs. This is naturally more dangerous than mere hibernation. It is generally used for slower-than-light interstellar exploration (where the travel time is much longer than average human life span), or to put a crewmember with an acute medical condition into stasis if the ship cannot arrive at a hospital for some months.\n\nHibernation was shown in the movies Alien, Doppelgänger, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and 2010: The Year We Make Contact.\n\nIn Doppelgänger the astronauts spent the three week trip plugged into a \"Heart Lung Kidney\" machine via veins in their wrists. This kept them oxygenated, fed, and sedated into a deep sleep for the entire trip.\n\nIn William Tedford's Silent Galaxy, interplanetary fighter pilots would sometimes find themselves out of fuel and on trajectories that would take years to return to a spot where they could be rescued. They would use hibernation to stretch their consumables and to sleep the time away.\n\nHibernation and suspension is often encountered in SF novels where large numbers of people have to be shipped, e.g., troop carriers, slave ships, and undesirable persons shipped off as involuntary colonists to some miserable planetary colony. Some passenger liners will have accomodations of First-class, Second-class, and Freeze-class (instead of Steerage). There is often a chance of mortality associated with hibernation and suspension. In some of the crasser passenger ships there will sometimes be a betting pool, placing bets on the number of freeze-class passengers who don't make it.\n\nPoul Anderson noted that there is probably a limit to how long a human will remain viable in cryogenic suspension (in other words they have a shelf-life). Naturally occuring radioactive atoms in the body will cause damage. In a non-suspended person such damage is repaired, but in a suspended person it just accumulates. He's talking about this damage happening over suspensions lasting several hundred years, during interstellar trips. This may require one to periodically thaw out crew members and keep them awake for long enough to heal the damage before re-freezing them.\n\nSpace Torpor\n\nSpaceWorks Engineering is working on a cold-sleep system for a NASA mission to Mars. You can read their report here. This is for a cold-sleep/hibernation system, since we are no where near knowing how to do full suspended animation.\n\nHaving the astronauts pass the journey in cold-sleep has many benefits, but the most remarkable one is the huge payload mass savings. In the table below, the habitat module from the NASA Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA) 5.0 study is compared to the same module using cold-sleep technology. The mass savings is a whopping 52% !\n\nMass ComparisonITEMDRA 5.0\n\n(kg)Torpor Hab\n\n(kg)Delta\n\n(%)Structure2,0801,170-44%Crew\n\nAccom3,9601,400-65%Environ Control\n\nLife Support3,8502,419-37%Thermal Management1,210750-38%Power System6,2403,420-45%Avionics280280-EVA Systems840840-Mass Growth\n\nAllowance (30%)4,6902,660-43%Additional\n\nSpares4,5502,500-45%Crew560560-Total Transit\n\nHabitat Mass28,26015,990-43%Food\n\n(Return+Outbound Trip)5,4801,620-70%Food\n\n(Contingency)7,6002,250-70%Total\n\nConsumables Mass13,0803,870-70%TOTAL MASS IN LEO41,33019,860-52%\n\nThe report lists the following benefits:\n\nReduction in required amount of consumables\n\nReduction in required pressurized living space volume\n\nElimination of many ancillary crew accommodations (galley, kitchen, exercise equipment, entertainment, etc.)\n\nReduction of psychological challenges for crew\n\nAnd the Hab Module mass savings can be used to increase payload, increase delta V, expand launch windows and mission options, increase radiation shielding, reduce the number of heavy-lift launches, reduce number of on-orbit assembly operations, increase subsystem mass margins (to improve redundancy, reliability, and safety).\n\nThe report focuses on Therapeutic Hypothermia (temperature-based hibernation) as the method of choice to induce cold-sleep. Mostly because it has actually been used medically to treat ailments such as cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, etc. Chemical/Drug-based (hydrogen sulfide or activating adenosine receptors) and Brain Synaptic-based hibernation are much less mature technologies. The report assumes that therapeutic hypothermia can be advanced to the point where the astronaut's metabolism can be reduced from normal to somewhere between moderate and significant reduction (but not to actual total metabolic stoppage), for periods of many months. Black bears and some rodents can do it, so we know it is possible.\n\nCooling mechanisms:\n\nInvasive: cooled intravenous fluids, e.g., CoolGard 3000Rtm with IcyT catheter by ZOLL MedicalNon-invasive: evaporative gases in the nasal and oral cavity, e.g., RhinoChill SystemtmPassive: conductive cooling (and rewarming) with gel pads placed on the body, e.g., KOALA Systemtm\n\nAll three methods are low mass, low power, and easily automated.\n\nThe astronauts will be fed by Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), which means fed intravenously. The nutrient fluid is a mixture containing lipids, amino acids, dextrose, electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements; all the essential nutrients needed for a human body to function.\n\nDelivered via a tunneled central venous catheter or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)\n\nAdministered through pump or gravity IV, usually given at around 50 ml per hour with supplemental maintenance fluids.\n\nBypasses the usual process of eating and digestion; digestive tract is inactive.\n\nThere are some medical challenges to solve, such as blood clotting, bleeding, infection, electrolyte imbalances, fatty liver, liver failure, bone demineralization, hypo/hyper glycemia, bile stasis, and others. The chosen method must have little or no long-term effects, no effects on crew functional abilities, and there should be some protocol for an accelerated warming/wakeup in case of emergencies\n\nGallery\n\nOld Astronaut Syndrome\n\nThere are some maladies that afflict people who spend prolonged periods in microgravity, exposed to space radiation, and exposed to radiation from nuclear propulsion. These could be characteristic signs of space traveling old-timers.\n\nMaladies from Microgravity\n\nThe most obvious effect of microgravity is the astronaut's muscles atrophy and the shedding of calcium by their bones (1% to 1.5% per month, like osteoporosis). Being weak with brittle bones isn't lethal but presumably the astronauts at some point want to return home to Terra and still be able to walk. Science fiction literature is full of mandatory exercise to combat this, with \"exercise credits\" awarded for time spent under acceleration and in centrifuges. NASA astronauts on the International Space Station have to exercise two hours a day for this reason. Some astronauts (or colonists of low gravity planets and moons) might require man-amplifier prosthetics in order to walk under a full Terran gravity.\n\nNaturally such space osteoporosis can lead to kidney stones, the agony of which is the closest a male will ever come to the sensation of giving birth. Space osteoporosis can also be combated by exercise.\n\nAstronaut's eyes are especially vulnerable. Recently NASA made the horrible discovery that exposure to microgravity for six months or longer causes permanent damage to the eyes, similar to idiopathic intercranial hypertension. There is some evidence that this is due to enzyme polymorphisms that increases astronaut vulnerability to bodily fluid shift in free fall.\n\nAstronauts may appear to be older than they actually are, because microgravity accelerates aging.\n\nAnd a science fictional favorite is the microgravity adapted astronaut who when on Terra has a tendency to let go of glasses of water in mid air, expecting them to float.\n\nMaladies from Radiation\n\nThe two main effects of radiation on an astronaut are [1] cancer and [2] death by radiation sickness. You are unlikely to encounter an old astronaut suffering from [2] unless you like to visit graveyards. But the probability is high that most old astronauts will have undergone treatment for cancer at one time or another. Probably several times. NASA tries to avoid this by ensuring that there are no old astronauts. NASA has strict career limits on astronaut radiation exposure.\n\nSecondary effects of radiation are skin ulceration and blindness due to cataracts scarring. High-mass, high-charged (HZE) cosmic rays might accelerate the development of Alzheimer's disease. Radiation also lowers the immune system (chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes), but it can recover.\n\nAtomic rocketeers on board an atomic rocket will also without fail have a package of potassium iodide tablets on their persons at all times. Why? If the reactor core is breached, the mildly radioactive fuel and the intensely radioactive fission fragments will be released into the atmosphere. While none of the fission fragment elements are particularly healthy, Iodine-131 is particularly nasty. This is because ones thyroid gland does its level best to soak up iodine, radioactive or not. Thyroid cancer or a hoarse voice from thyroid surgery might be common among atomic rocket old-timers. The tablets prevent this by filling up the thyroid first, before the Iodine-131 arrives. The instant the reactor breach alarm sounds, whip out your potassium iodide tablets and swallow one.\n\nMiscellaneous other Maladies\n\nAstronauts who eat more than fifty grams per day of spirulina algae from your closed ecological life support system run the risk of developing gout. That could be Old Poor Astronaut Syndrome.\n\nOld astronauts might have deformed fingernails due to space suit gloves.\n\nOld astronauts might tend to become alarmed when they feel a breeze. To an astronaut, moving air means you have a hull breech.\n\nOld astronauts might dislike hissing noises. To an astronaut, such noises means your spacesuit has sprung a leak.\n\nOld astronauts might be anal-retentive about having every object either in its holder or tied down. In a spacecraft, unexpected acceleration converts any free-floating object into a deadly missile.\n\nOld astronauts might tend to become alarmed of the building or vehicle they are in shudders. Because spacecraft never shudder unless they are lifting off from a planet's surface or about to disintegrate into fragments.\n\nIn Larry Niven's \"Known Space\" series, belters do NOT perform any hand gestures at all. This is because Niven's belters fly in very small spacecraft called \"singleships\". The habitat module is only slightly larger than a coffin. Which is also the control cabin, i.e., there are controls on almost every surface.\n\nDisgusting Recycling\n\nClosed ecological life support systems are dynamite on paper. Instead of the spacecraft being forced to drag along tons of air, food, and water the CELSS can take sunlight or other energy source and magically produce the needed elements.\n\nOne little problem: novice spacecraft passengers tend to throw temper tantrums when you tell them they'll be eating and drinking recycled urine and faeces. The disgust reflex kicks in at the thought of drinking purified pee and reconstituted poop.\n\nThe problem is magnified by the fact that disgust is a powerful pro-survival trait favored by evolution. Creatures with disgust do not die as quickly, so it is a pretty fundamental reflex. You can try to explain to the passengers until you are blue in the face that the CELSS algae has totally transformed and sterilized the feedstocks into sparkling pure water and nutritious food, but they will stubbornly tell you they ain't gonna eat that crap. This can also be a predictor of a person's political orientation but I digress. Or maybe not; a science fiction author could use this fact for, say, an undercover agent inadvertently revealing themselves.\n\nResearchers and engineers are facing this in the real world. There is a global shortage of potable water which could be solved by reclamation equipment transforming waste water into pure water. But the people who could be helped would rather die of thirst. Scientists call it the \"toilet-to-tap\" problem.\n\nThis is a problem that needs to be fixed by a psychologist, not an engineer.\n\nAs a mental model, disgust about recycled water and food tends to mirror \"magical thinking\" used by pretechnological cultures. The four elements are:\n\nPhysical contact is necessary for contagion to be effective.\n\nPermanence: Once magical contamination has occurred, it tends to be permanent. Neither time nor spatial distance reduce the effect substantially.\n\nDose insensitivity: Very brief contact with a disgusting entity is sufficient to endow a target entity with disgust properties, cf. childhood bullying called \"catching Cooties\"\n\nResistance of contaminated entities to purification. This amounts to indelibility of contamination for some contaminants and some individuals.\n\nThe sad fact of the matter is that even though the above magical thinking elements are totally untrue in the realm of science, most people are convinced that these elements are the true reality.\n\nA closely related problem is a CELSS generating food in the form of insect protein. From a scientific standpoint this is an admirably efficient way to make food. From a human standpoint most people from western cultures will turn a little green around the gills at the thought of eating a plate of bugs. The disgust mechanism kicks in because it is trying to protect a person from infection. Insects and other vermin are associated with unhygienic conditions almost as strongly as urine and faeces.\n\nDrop Sickness\n\nSpace Adaptation Syndrome aka \"drop sickness\" is a kind of motion sickness caused by weightlessness. Outer space sea-sickness, so to speak. Symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and an inability to care about anything but your own private world of pain. The joke is drop sickness makes you feel like you are going to die, and you are actually looking forwards to it.\n\nThe French term for seasickness is \"mal de mer\" so in his Venus Equilateral stories George O. Smith thought it would be cute to call spacesickness \"mal de void.\"\n\nAbout half of new astronauts suffer from drop-sickness when they first travel into space. Of those who suffer, 50% have mild symptoms, 40% have medium, and 10% have severe. The most severe that NASA ever recorded was that of Senator Jake Garn in 1985. They jokingly use the \"Garn scale\", where 1.0 Garn is the worst.\n\nDrop sickness usually goes away after two to four days exposure to free fall. Occasionally there is a relapse, which can happen at any time. When suffering from drop sickness, be careful not to rapidly turn or shake your head. This will make the fluid in the inner ear slosh and make things much worse.\n\nNovice NASA astronauts do not take motion-sickness medication on their first trip into orbit. It is considered better for them to be miserable for a day or two but actually adapt to become immune. This is also the reason NASA never schedules EVAs for the first two days of a mission.\n\nHaving said that, NASA astronaut always put on a transdermal dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patch when suiting up in a space suit, because throwing up inside a suit can be fatal. A little dramamine is much better than suffocating to death in a vomit-filled helmet.\n\nDrop sickness can be avoided if the spacecraft or station has artificial gravity, though that creates more problems. And \"disabled\" persons with malfunctioning inner ears are immune to drop sickeness.\n\nIn a couple of Robert Heinlein novels free-fall newbies are issued \"sick-kits.\" These are cloth barf bags that strap over your mouth. In other novels spacecraft with large numbers of passengers are equipped with vomit vacuums that stewards use to suck blobs of vomitus out of the air before they splash on something or somebody.\n\nIn some old science fiction novels the writers like to pull that tired old joke. The protagonist is offered an anti-drop-sickness pill before lift-off, and they decide to be all macho and decline the pill. Which results in projectile vomiting hilarity. Except in Arthur C. Clarke's Islands in the Sky, the port officials make quite sure that the young protagonist takes all his pills.\n\nSleep\n\nCrying\n\nGravity is so useful for many things. Like when you cry, gravity yanks down your tears so they run down your cheeks.\n\nAin't no gravity in space.\n\nSo when you cry in space, your tears accumulate over your eyes in large liquid balls. If you head moves the tear balls may detach and float around the room until they are sucked up by the ventilator grates. This stings and makes it very hard to see things.\n\nBoredom\n\nSeveral SF novels point out the dangers inherent in cooping up people in a tin can surrounded by vacuum for months at a time. They will be prey to \"space cafard\" (i.e., deep space cabin fever, what the French Foreign Legion called \"the beetle\").\n\nIt can be even worse if the tin can is a little too cramped.\n\nThe only solutions seem to be [a] put them in the suspended animation freezer, [b] drug them, or [c] keep them busy, busy, busy! (a bitching, er, ah complaining spacer is a happy spacer) The first officer can assign some worthless busy-work, like a once daily nose to stern ship inspection for micro-meteor holes.\n\nOne might think that the same problem would be faced by the crew on a military submarine, but as it turns out the analogy is inexact. Christopher Weuve says: A long submarine mission is six months, and keeping people sane is an issue, solved in part through over-work (which I think helps in the short run) and very careful screening.\n\nA more constructive approach (for officers) is a huge stockpile of study-spools and daily home-work in such topics as higher mathematics, astronavigation, and nuclear physics. Plus other non-space related subjects just to keep the mind flexible. There will also be an active schedule of cross-training, e.g., the astrogator learning how to maintain an atomic drive unit. You never know when knowledge of a job outside of your specialty could prove vital in an emergency.\n\nThe sergeant in charge of the enlisted men will have to know when to turn a blind eye to the home-made moonshine \"still\" hidden on Z deck and the floating poker and dice games. Gambling and rocket-juice will combat boredom.\n\nLast but not least is locally hosted internet games (local because a latency of 24 minutes makes real-time games impossible). However, such games might be restricted to cooperative games. Competitive games are too vulnerable to Griefers. If you have a bunch of crew whose nerves are already on edge due to living in a sardine can for the last eight months, the last thing you want is some sociopath deliberately enraging everybody. Tempers will flare while blood and body parts accumulate on the air intakes.\n\nThe other danger is internet games that are a little too immersive. Given the the choice between the real world of sensory deprivation inside the spacecraft and the fantasy world full of adventure and excitement, the crew might lose touch with reality. This was the topic of Poul Anderson's The Saturn Game.\n\nCoffee\n\nIn Anne McCaffrey's novel Dragonsdawn it states that the first two things human colonists always do on a new world are:\n\nFind something that can be turned into booze\n\nFind a substitute for coffee\n\nHere on Terra coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and there are many who cannot fully wake up and do work until they've had their morning cup of java. Particularly the various branches of the military. There are many who say that the US Navy runs on coffee. Furthermore it is hard to exaggerate the effect coffee houses had on merchant trading and shipping. Ship-owners, merchants, and insurance houses made deals in the coffee houses over cups of \"the new black liquor from Turkey\".\n\nIn a science fictional future, spacecraft crew may be forbidden tobacco to avoid death by asphyxiation but you can bet your last rocket they will have some sort of caffeinated beverage.\n\nBut since science fiction authors can't resit using the old Call a Rabbit a \"Smeerp\" trick, they will have all sorts of strange names for coffee in a desperate attempt to convince the reader that they are not in Kansas anymore. Occasionally in science fiction you will find species of deadly hyper-coffee with extreme effects.\n\nIn The Beast Master they drink Swankee, King David's Spaceship has Chickeest, the Sten novels have Caff, Warhammer 40K has Recaff, the Wheel of Time novels have Kaf, The Pern novels have Klah, and the Helmsman saga has Cvcesse. In Derelict for Trade they have Jakek which is a syntho coffee substitute the crew makes do with when times are lean.\n\nMore realistically the previously mentioned human colonists will find that coffee refuses to grow on their new world so they will frantically have to find a replacement. Authors are fond of having new colonists complain about how disgusting the local ersatz coffee is and how they miss the real stuff. Second and subsequent generations of colonists have never tasted honest-to-Joe coffee so they are satisfied with the substitute as long as it has plenty of caffeine.\n\nSpace Booze\n\nWhile most illegal drugs and other controlled substances are rather difficult to manufacture in the space environment, good old alcohol is relatively easy. After all, convicts manage to make Pruno in prison; even with limited access to raw materials, workspace, and privacy from prison guards.\n\nIn most cases, the actual production of alcohol from sugar is done by yeast cultures. These cultures are almost impossible for the authorities to keep out of the hands of illegal brewer-masters of contraband alcoholic beverages. In the case of making wine, the yeast can be conveniently found already living on the grape skins.\n\nAnd if the CELSS is using yeast to make single-cell protein, there is no way to prevent moonshiners from obtaining a supply. In 2015 the Australian government was considering making the national staple food Vegemite a controlled substance (inspiring howls of outrage). Apparently home-brewers in remote areas were purchasing Vegemite in bulk and using it to make moonshine. After all, the main ingredient of Vegemite is leftover brewers' yeast extract (not baker's yeast, brewers' yeast). In Australia there has already been a ban on Vegemite in prisons since the 1990's for the same reason. Controlling it outside of prison is going to be an uphill battle.\n\nNote that when traveling, if the bacterial content of the local water is questionable, it is much safer to drink the local beer instead of the water. Use beer to brush your teeth as well. An ancient Egyptian tomb inscription boasted about the dear departed's generosity by saying \"I gave bread to the hungry and beer to the thirsty\".\n\nSome anthropologists have a theory that early man invented agriculture not to increase the supply of food, but to increase the supply of beer.\n\nNote that through thousands of years of recorded history the brewing of beer was the domain of women (see \"Alewife\"). It wasn't until relatively recently that it became a male dominated profession.\n\nAlcohol is absorbed into the blood stream slowly in the stomach, but the rate can be increased if the beverage is carbonated. This is why strong people who are apparently unaffected by a shot of whisky will sometimes start to giggle if they drink bubbly champagne (carbonated wine). Beer is carbonated, but it is so weak it needs all the help it can get. Champagne has more of a kick than non-carbonated wine. And a cocktail that includes some sort of carbonated mixer is most potent of all.\n\nKeep in mind the drawback of carbonated beverages in free fall. You see, you cannot burp in space, not just burp gas at any rate. Here on Terra the gravity allows the gas to separate from the solids and liquids, so the burp contains only gas. But with no gravity, there is no separation, so a burp is more like projectile vomiting. Some astronauts called the \"Bomit\". This is bad enough, but it gets worse. Since the gas cannot exit the mouth via a burp, it has to find another way out…\n\nSome old SF novels call space hooch \"rocket juice\", as a tribute to the torpedo juice from WW2. In Star Trek, Captain Kirk liked his Saurian Brandy, and McCoy was fond of Romulan ale. And of course Scotty is partial to scotch, even mixed with theragen.\n\nOther noteable alcoholic beverages from science fiction include Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster, Ambrosa (yeah, this is only 100 yahrens old, they don't give us the good stuff), and Klingon Bloodwine.\n\nIt is also possible to have an alcoholic beverage as the focus of a science fiction story. I highly recommend Golubash, or Wine-Blood-War-Elegy by Catherynne M. Valente\n\nDrunken Astronaut\n\nNeedless to say, becoming drunk in an inherently dangerous environment such as deep space is a quick way to get yourself killed. In the US the legal drunk driving limit is 0.08% Blood Alcohol Content (other nations have different standards). A general rule is that one standardized \"drink\" = one hour = no exceptions (that is, if you had three drinks, wait three hours before driving). For private airplane pilots, the general rule is Eight Hours Bottle To Throttle.\n\nIn the U.S. (wet) Navy, drinking alcohol is not allowed while aboard a ship (since the passage of General Order No. 99 in 1914), and off ship it is forbidden if the person is on duty or under-aged. In the U.K., which has a tradition of a daily rum-ration for sailors, crew is limited to consume no more than 35mg of alcohol per 100ml when they are on safety-critical duty (same as the U.K. drink-drive limit). For U.K. naval crew handling weapons the limit is 9mg per 100ml. The U.K. Armed Forces Act of 2011 prohibited the consumption of more than five units of alcohol 24 hours before duty and no alcohol was to be consumed in the 10 hours before duty.\n\nIn Jerry Pournelle's Falkenberg's Legion series of science fiction novels the CoDominium navy and marines have no regulations against drinking alcohol, even on duty. But there are severe penalties for rendering oneself unfit for duty (penalties up to execution by firing squad). When deployed, CoDominium marines were commonly given a daily wine ration of half a liter per person.\n\nWine\n\nA \"wine\" is an alcoholic beverage produced by yeast converting the sugar in fruit juice into ethanol. At some point the ethanol level rises high enough to kill off the yeast, halting production. This limits the proof of wines, usually 9%–16% alcohol by volume (ABV) or 18—32 proof.\n\nA fortified wine is a wine with the alcohol content increased by adding some distilled spirits (generally brandy, which is distilled wine). If the brandy is added before the wine fermentation is completed the resulting fortified wine will be sweet. This is because the brandy kills off the yeast before all the sugar is consumed. Fortified wines can be up to 20% ABV (40 proof).\n\nSome anthropologists have a theory that wine was discovered by some cave-man who took a drink out of a puddle full of rotting fruit.\n\nBeer\n\nA \"beer\" is an alcoholic beverage produced from grain, usually barley or wheat. First the grain is \"malted\": germinated in hot water, then dried. The malting process creates enzymes which can convert starch into sugar.\n\nThe malt is mixed with hot water to create what brewers call \"wort\" but we can call \"yeast food.\" This allows the enzymes to convert the starch in the grains (which yeast cannot eat) into sugar (which yeast will merrily convert into alcohol). See \"saccharification of starch\".\n\nAfter about two hours the malt enzymes has converted most of the starch into sugar, and the wort is boiled to get rid of some of the water. After the wort is cooled, it is put in a fermenter along with hungry yeast. The yeast put on their bibs, whip out their knives and forks, and start gobbling sugar while excreting ethanol. Yes, beer is yeast pee. As if that will stop you from drinking it. Beer is generally 2%—12% ABV (4—24 proof).\n\nA \"malt liquor\" is a beer made by adding sugar, corn, or other adjuncts to the wort in order to increase the alcohol content (above 6% or 12 proof). The extra yeast food means more alcohol.\n\nDistilled Spirits\n\nSince people have a tendency to be min-maxers, they looked for ways to increase the ethanol levels in their product. The tried and true method is to use a distillery rig, aka a moonshine \"still\". Such items have to heat up the source alcoholic beverage using fire, but in space the abundantly available vacuum can be used instead.\n\nJohn Reiher notes that you do NOT want to use a vacuum still on beer or any other mash containing hops. One of the essential hop oils, Myrcene, has a boiling point of 63.9° C, which is under alcohol's 74° C. If you're not careful, you'll end up with very hoppy ethyl alcohol (i.e., incredibly bitter).\n\nThe basic idea is to remove water from the booze, thus increasing the relative percentage of alcohol. Conventional stills take advantage of the fact that water and alcohol have different volatility. That is, ethyl alcohol boils at a much lower temperature than water.\n\nYou boil the wine or mash at a temperature (78°C) which vaporizes the alcohol but very little of the water. Then you send the alcohol vapor through a condenser to turn it back into liquid. The alcohol drips out of the condenser into a jug. The condenser is that copper spiral tube (the \"worm\") you see on classic moonshine stills. Copper is used because it absorbs sulfur-based compounds which would otherwise make the product taste like skunk juice.\n\nThe products of a still are called distilled beverage, spirit, liquor, or hard liquor. Typical distilled spirits are about 40% ABV (80 proof), extreme stuff is 75% ABV (150 proof), Everclear grain alcohol is about 95% ABV (190 proof) which is close to being rocket fuel.\n\nWhiskey and the like are made with pot stills where there is lots of water in the vapor sent to the condenser. After two distillations whiskey has a 70% ABV. Moonshine is made in moonshine stills, with very little water in the vapor. It has a 95% ABV, almost suitable for use in a Rocketdyne RS-88 rocket engine.\n\nThere are many kinds of distilled spirits. A \"brandy\" is distilled wine. A \"whisky\" is distilled from grain mash (like beer's barley or wheat) except whisky can also be made from corn or rye. You can think of whisky as distilled beer without being utterly wrong. A \"vodka\" is generally distilled from fermented potato mash, its main feature is the almost total lack of flavorings.\n\nA more low-tech way to increase the alcohol level is to use freeze-distillation (aka \"jacking\"), such as in the manufacture of applejack. Alcohol freezes at a lower temperature than water (this is why you can use it as antifreeze). So in the American colonial period, apple juice from the harvest was allowed to ferment into a sort of fruit beer (less than 10% ABV). Then during the winter, the juice was placed outside to freeze, or at least the water would. The frozen lumps of water were removed, thus raising the alcoholic content of the remainder (up to 40% ABV). This method might be popular on newly colonized Terran planets with a low tech base. A drawback to freeze-distillation is that (unlike conventional distillation) the process concentrates dangerous poisons such as methanol and fusel oil.\n\nBack in the 1920's during Prohibition in the US, amateurs made Bathtub gin. This lead to the creation of many gin cocktails, as the speakeasies desperately experimented with sugary flavors to mask the vile taste of the poorly made gin. Everything old is new again. Enlisted spacecraft crew will also be eager to steal fruit juices from the quartermaster to doctor the foul product of their vacuum stills.\n\nFornication\n\nTo combat boredom, the crew will think of other forms of recreation.\n\nIn the anime Planetes, they recognize the fact that having male and female crew members cooped up in close quarters for weeks at a time can cause certain tensions. When stocking a spacecraft for a mission, one officially required item is a selection of erotic magazines (available at spaceport chandlery). This allows the crew members to take care of the problem in solitary fashion. Fornication among the crew is generally always a bad idea. There will be all the problems common to office romances, but with the hatred turned up to 11 by stress of living in such confined quarters.\n\nThe medic can prescribe libedo-suppressing medications, though if you haven't heard already the tales of various militaries putting saltpetre or potassium bromide in soldier's food is a myth.\n\nThe actual mechanics will be quite different, as the natural recoil will tend to make the couple separate and go flying into opposite sides of the cabin. Some futurists have spectulated that a set of bungee cords will be required. Other are of the opinion that a third person will be needed as a helper, much as has been observed with some species of dolphin in the free-fall environment of the ocean\n\nPsychological Problems\n\nAnd then there are mental problems. The dread spectre of space madness. They might even start seeing space gremlins.\n\nObviously there are problems with confining too many astronauts in a too-small habitat module for prolonged periods of time with not enough sleep and practically no privacy. Add pressure from ground control to work the astronauts to death coupled with boredom and you have a real recipe for blood floating all over the module. At least in an Arctic research station a researcher close to snapping can step outside for a breath of fresh air. Not so the astronaut\n\nCosmonaut Valery Ryumin, twice Hero of the Soviet Union, quotes this passage from The Handbook of Hymen by O. Henry in his autobiographical book about the Salyut 6 mission: “If you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by twenty-foot cabin for a month. Human nature won't stand it.”\n\nThis was sort of hinted at by the 1999-2000 Russian Sphinx-99 experiment. This enclosed six crewmembers in a simulated space station for six months. About two months into the experiment there was a bloody fist-fight between two of the Russian crewmembers. Shortly thereafter the Canadian female crewmember (Dr. Judith Lapierre) was dragged off camera by the Russian commander and forcibly french-kissed despite her vigorous protests. In two separate incidents. The researchers reponded by giving Dr. Lapierre the only key to one section of the simulated station.\n\nThe problem of astronaut cabin fever was even mentioned in a 1964 Saturday-morning cartoon called \"Jonny Quest\", in an episode entitled \"Double Danger\". Dr. Quest is looking for solutions to the cabin fever problem. He plans to visit Thailand to scout some hallucinogenic plants as a possible treatment or cure (the Jonny Quest producers didn't want to come out and openly say \"marijuana\" or \"LSD\" on a kid's TV show). Unfortunately for Dr. Quest, his arch-enemy the evil Dr. Zin wants to get his sinister claws on the plants. Apparently they can be used to make a tranquilizing drug capable of immobilizing entire cities. Mwah-ha-ha-ha!\n\nBreak-Off Effect\n\nAnd then there is the Break-Off effect. This was first reported before the dawn of space travel, by high altitude military airplane pilots. It was a type of psychological dissociative anomaly, a feeling of detachment. Most pilots felt peaceful, a few euphoric, and about a third were panic-stricken.\n\nIt was thought this would also happen with astronauts. But in the 1970's when cosmonauts and astronauts actually started flying the problem seemed to disappear.\n\nIt wasn't until recently that it became clear the Break-Off effect did not disappear in astronauts. What disappeared was the astronauts reporting it. Astronauts are in constant terror of being grounded, so they developed a \"lie to fly\" culture. The last thing they are going to do is report to the flight surgeons some scary mental breakdown that will get them grounded faster than a teenage girl staying out five hours past her curfew.\n\nDuring the Apollo missions, some astronauts reported how the vision of Earth as the big blue marble caused a sudden cognitive shift in awareness. They suddenly saw Earth as a fragile ball of life where national boundaries became unimportant. A writer named Frank White coined the term The Overview Effect, and wrote a popular book on the topic in 1987. You can find some quotes about the effect here. Some have pointed out a similarity to the Japanese aesthetic of Yūgen.\n\nAnd there are some psychologists who suspect that the Break-Off Effect and the Overview Effect are one and the same.\n\nMinimum Living Volume\n\nThe US wet Navy crams twelve enlisted men into 100 m3, or 8.3 m3 per man. For deep space missions of 5 months or longer, this NASA report (Minimum Acceptable Net Habitable Volume for Long-Duration Exploration Missions) recommended a minimum acceptable Net Habitable Volume of 25 m3 (883 ft3) per person.\n\nFor more details go here.\n\nDiscworld Mine Sign\n\nTerry Pratchett's Discworld novels are satirical fantasy for thinking people. While they are comedy, many of the jokes require a bit of scientific knowledge on the part of the reader. Which explains why I find them so entertaining. My personal favorites are The Truth (the invention of the newspaper), Going Postal (post office vs the Victorian internet), and Raising Steam (the invention of the steam locomotive).\n\nAnyway like many fantasy novels the Discworld has a race of dwarfs. They spend most of their time in cramped mines in very close quarters with other dwarfs. Things can get tense.\n\nMuch like spacers on a prolonged deep-space mission in a tiny hab module, actually. Or asteroid miners.\n\nAs a sort of social network to reduce tensions Discworld dwarves use something called \"mine signs\", a species of graffiti. I am wondering of the idea can be adapted to a rocketpunk universe. Imagine Banksy using Spacers Runic\n\nSocial Media\n\nOn a spacecraft it might be considered a bit ghetto-like to spray-paint Dwarf Mine Signs on the corridor walls to blow off emotional steam, even if you are using Spacer's Runic. Especially if this is a military spacecraft.\n\nA more sophisticated method to deal with crew getting cabin fever would be to use a shipboard version of social media (space twitter) sending hashtags as a reflexive meta-commentary ( #THEFOODSTINKS! ). The main thing is that the messages have to be sent anonymously. Just like graffiti.\n\nThere was something like that in Sir Arthur C. Clarke's novel The Songs of Distant Earth, called \"Shipnet.\"\n\nHow Space Kills You\n\nA NASA technician said \"If you treat vacuum as you would poison gas you won't go far wrong.\" G. Harry Stine coined the term \"traumatic abaryia\" which more or less means \"damage caused to your body by sudden exposure to vacuum\".\n\nHow does space kill you? Let me count the ways. Face it, the human body was not designed to properly function in the vacuum of space. At a rough guess a person can survive space exposure as long as they are placed back inside a pressured atmosphere within 90 seconds. After that time, death might be unavoidable. You will only have about ten seconds before you become unconscious. Dr. Geoffrey Landis has an analysis here. There are some more links on the topic of explosive decompression here.\n\nAnd anybody who's seen 2001 A Space Odyssey knows that a human exposed to vacuum is not going to pop like a balloon.\n\nIn order of lethality the effects are:\n\nEbullism\n\nFormation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids by reduction of environmental pressure aka your blood starts to boil. Your eyes and mouth freeze due to evaporative cooling, tissue dies with loss of oxygen, entire body swells enormously, circulatory failure, muscle failure due to flaccid paralysis, lungs collapse and fill with ice.\n\nHypoxia\n\nThe body being deprived of adequate oxygen supply aka suffocation because there ain't nothing to breath in space. Ataxia, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, behavioral change, severe headaches, reduced level of consciousness, papilloedema, breathlessness, pallor, tachycardia, pulmonary hypertension, cyanosis, bradycardia, cor pulmonale, low blood pressure, death\n\nHypocapnia\n\nA state of reduced carbod dioxide in the blood aka turbocharged hyperventilation. Transient dizziness, visual disturbances, anxiety, pins and needles sensation, muscle cramps and tetany in hands and feet.\n\nDecompression Sickness\n\nDissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation aka turn your blood stream into red foam like a shaken can of soda pop. Symptoms may range from rash to agonizing joint paint to death.\n\nExtreme Temperature Variations\n\nIn sunlight at Terra's orbit the body may overheat, in shadow the body can lose heat at a rate of up to 1,000 watts.\n\nRadiation\n\nProlonged exposure to ultraviolet, x-rays, and energized protons can cause death by organ failure, short-term exposure may cause cancer. Chances are exposure to space will kill you in a matter of minutes so I wouldn't worry about the cancer.\n\nArtist Nathan Hoste is doing a well-researched series called Bodies in Space on all the damage space does to an unprotected human. Warning, images may be considered NSFW.\n\nNo Air\n\nIf exposed to the vacuum of space, you got 10 seconds before you go unconsious. And 90 seconds before your body suffers fatal damage.\n\nThe main deadly feature of space is the lack of air. Unsurprisingly, out of the six major lethal factors of outer space, four of them are due to fact that there ain't nothing to breath: Ebullism, Hypoxia, Hypocapnia, and Decompression Sickness.\n\nBesides the fact that you can't breath, a dead giveaway which tells an astronaut that they are in a vacuum without a space suit is when the saliva in their mouth suddently starts to boil.\n\nIf you suddenly find yourself in a vacuum, do NOT try to hold your breath. The air pressure trapped in your lungs will cause pulmonary barotrauma (aka all the zillions of tiny alveoli of your lungs will start popping like balloons). This means even if you manage to make it back into a pressurized area, you'll still die since you cannot breath with exploded lungs. To be really safe you should yell to help expell every bit of your lung pressure.\n\nAIR FACTS\n\nLUNG DECOMPRESSION\n\n10 secs until unconscious\n\n90 secs until fatal damage\n\nHypoxia\n\nmaybe Ebullism\n\nHypocapnia\n\nThe Bends\n\nEBULLISM OCCURS IF\n\n< 6.3 kPa w/bare skin\n\n(Armstrong Limit)\n\n(Kittinger Syndrome)\n\n< 2.0 kPa w/Pumpkin Suit\n\nNever w/space suit\n\nHABITAT AIR\n\nN2 79%, O2 21%\n\n< 25.1 kPa: Anoxia\n\n101.3 kPa: Normal\n\n> 254.0 kPa: O2 toxicity\n\n> 400 kPa: N2 narcosis\n\nSPACE SUIT AIR\n\nO2 100%\n\n< 5.3 kPa: Anoxia\n\n32.4 kPa: Normal\n\n> 53.3 kPa: O2 toxicity\n\n< 3/5 kPa can safely open ISS outside airlock hatch without damaging the hinges\n\nAnd there are a couple of effects that are not actually lethal, just incredibly painful.\n\nArmstrong Limit\n\nIf you take glass of water, and lower the air pressure, the temperature point at which the water boils is lowered as well. This is why cake mixes have high altitude instructions: the watery part has a lower boiling point/maximum temperature than normal so it takes longer to cook. If you are living in a habitat module with a pure oxygen breathing mix, the pressure will be at about 32.4 kPa (80% normal Terran atmospheric pressure). Here too the cake mixes will take longer to cook since water boils at 70° C, and your tea will always be lukewarm.\n\nWhat I am leading up to is the Armstrong Limit. You see, if the pressure drops to 6.3 kPa (63 mbar), water will boil at 37° C. Which just happens to be normal human body temperature. The saliva will boil off your tongue, the tears will boil off your eyes. If you become so frightened that you pee in your pants, that will boil as well. The same goes for poop but that's a horrible image I just don't want to think about.\n\nThe blood will boil in your veins too, were it not for the fortunate fact that your skin will pressurize your vascular system enough to prevent that unhappy state of affairs. This is why soft suits can get away with not pressurizing your body.\n\nYes, the technical name for this low-pressure boiling is ebullism, as previously mentioned.\n\nNaturally astronauts will not commonly be constantly exposed to 6.3 kPa. Much more likly they will briefly encounter it as the pressure plummets to zero kPa, as all the breathing mix goes rushing out a deadly tear in their space suit or a major breech in the hull of the habitat module.\n\nBut in any event if your saliva starts to boil, be aware that you have only ten seconds to get to safety before you lose consiousness, and 80 additional seconds for your buddies to drag you into somewhere pressurized before you die. Be quick or be dead.\n\nKittinger Syndrome\n\nIn addition: hands, feet, arms, and legs that are no pressurized will suffer an attack of Kittinger Syndrome. They will swell up to about twice normal size, with accompanying agonizing pain. Bringing back pressure will return them to normal, but if swollen for more than a few minutes there wil be aneurisms and hematomas. G. Harry Stine calls this \"Vac Bite.\"\n\nAs a matter of interest, NASA has a rule that the International Space Station's airlock pressure has to be lowered to 3.5 kPa (35 mbar) before it is safe to open the hatch to space. Otherwise the residual air pressure inside the airlock could break the hinges.\n\nStupidity\n\nArguably the biggest killer in the space environment is Stupidity.\n\nLarry Niven coined the phrase \"Think of it as evolution in action\".\n\nSpace Burial\n\nA morbid but necessary fixture that nobody talks about will be the \"C-Chute\" (from the Isaac Asimov story with the same name). \"C\" is short for \"Casualty\". A dead body will quickly contaminate the air of the lifesystem, not to mention being a biohazard as it decomposes. So there has to be a way to jettison the dear departed.\n\nLacking a dedicated C-Chute, a spacecraft can make do with sending the corpse to the great beyond by using an airlock.\n\nNASA doesn't want to talk about such things. NASA astronauts will make vague noises about the crew on the International Space Station storing a body in an airlock or in the coldest part of the station (where they already store garbage, to keep the smell down). If the dear departed died during an EVA, the crew would probably keep the body inside the suit. Apparently the body would decompose more rapidly inside the suit. And the suit will help keep in the noxious outgassing and unsanitary bacteria.\n\nCONQUEST OF SPACE morale disaster\n\nAlso of concern is the effect on crew morale. Personnel will be prone to morbid thoughts while their crewmate(s) mortal remains are lying in the next cabin. There will probably be a tradition of laying the dead to rest within twenty-four hours of death.\n\nIt will be important to have an already established protocol for laying the dead to rest. In the movie Conquest of Space they did not have such an established protocol, and the results were ugly. During an EVA astronaut Andre Fodor is killed by a meteor. Not knowing what to do, they leave the body out there still on the safety line.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nYou can see the surviving crew start to freak out as they try to ignore their dead friend floating outside the porthole. Finally one of them cracks and starts to scream at the body. That's when the captain suddenly wakes up to the vital necessity of laying to rest the dear departed. Say a few words, and push the body off into space.\n\nDon't bother trying to push it into collision course with the Sun, it takes far too much delta V and if the course is only a tiny bit off the body will just sling-shot around and head off to the Oort cloud.\n\nAs it turns out, NASA does not have an established protocol for dealing with unexpected dead bodies. They are going to be faced with the \"Conquest of Space\" scenario if they don't quit pretending that it will not happen. This is complicated by the fact that the UN space debris mitigation guidelines forbid space littering, which includes dumping dead bodies.\n\nA radical suggestion is the Body Back. The technical term is \"promession\", but what it means in practice is:\n\nPlace the body of the dear departed into a special bag\n\nHang the bag out in vacuum, where in an hour it will freeze-dry into the consistency of florist foam\n\nBring the bag in and place it in a high-frequency vibration unit\n\nThe body shatters into fine powder. You now have a bag full of about 23 kilograms of dust.\n\nAttach the bag to the outside of the spacecraft until it can be returned for proper burial\n\nIn far future and alien cultures there can be all sorts of methods for the disposal of the dead.\n\nIf the spacecraft uses a closed ecological life support system and is on a very long mission, they may be forced to recycle the body back into the system. However you'll probably find this more on a generational starship on a hundred year trip or in a space colony.\n\nOn military spacecraft, the death of crewmen will be a more common occurrence than on a NASA ship. For purposes of morale, a ship-board military funeral will be part of The Book of military regulations. Military ships cannot afford \"Conquest of Space\" scenarios, not with the high mortality rates common to battles. Science fiction authors are fond of such ships using their torpedo tubes to launch the dear departed to their eternal rest. In the webcomic Schlock Mercenary they use \"coffinpedoes\".\n\nThis was done with a lot less dignity in the movie Enemy Mine. In that movie the military was so callous and cynical about the many combat deaths that the space stations had a \"funeral launcher\" fed with dead soldiers on a conveyor belt, equipped with a side-magazine loaded with cheap funeral wreaths and Muzak-style funeral parlor music playing in the background. The current body in the launcher stops just long enough for the bored technicians on duty to check the deceased's religion and play the appropriate prerecorded last rites.\n\nSpace Mummy\n\nSooner or later some poor space traveler is going to die in space in some remote location, their body is not going to be recovered promply, and nature will take its course. Eeeeeeew.\n\nA popuar artistic motif is skeletons in spacesuits. But in reality a long-dead body in space is probably going to more resemble a mummy than a skeleton. They might look like the Gebelein predynastic mummies.\n\nDead People Don't Drop\n\nIn free-fall you don't fall. Meaning that in microgravity if you shoot and kill the space pirate, their dead body is not going to fall to the floor. They will just sort of float where they died.\n\n◀Design: CELSS\n\n◀Design: CELSS\n\nAtomic Rockets notices\n\nThis week's featured addition is SPIN POLARIZATION FOR FUSION PROPULSION\n\nThis week's featured addition is INsTAR\n\nThis week's featured addition is NTR ALTERNATIVES TO LIQUID HYDROGEN\n\nAtomic Rockets search"
