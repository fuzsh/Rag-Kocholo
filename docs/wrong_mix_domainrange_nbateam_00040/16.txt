If there's a better way to honor a fallen civil rights pioneer and inspirational spirit than with twelve straights hours of NBA on TV, I'd like to hear it. Coming at the two-and-a-half hour mark of today's marathon will be the Sixers traveling to Minnesota to battle the less-than-mighty Timberwolves. The Wolves are a West-worst 8-33 for the season, including a recent 0-4 road trip that climaxed in them getting blown out by the Grizzlies. Still, there are no automatic wins in the NBA, and the Wolves have a nice young core in place with rookie guards Jonny Flynn and Wayne Ellington in the backcourt, and skilled big men Kevin Love and Al Jefferson up front.

The talent hasn't added up to much in terms of wins, though, and the Sixers should have a decent shot at getting their second win in a row after a fine effort at home against Sacramento last Friday. Despite a couple of frustrating losses, the Sixers have actually played plus-.500 ball so far this month, winning four of seven games, and it would be pretty super-fine to see them continue on that trend and end up with their first winning month of the season. Continued front-court success seems like the key--if Samuel Dalembert can keep gobbling up rebounds and Elton Brand can keep hitting his mid-range jumper, this can be a pretty tough team to beat, regardless of the opponent.

3:30 tip from the Target Center. There's far too much good basketball to look forward to today for my day to be completely ruined by the Sixers laying an egg with this one. Still only five-and-a-half games out of the playoffs, people.
