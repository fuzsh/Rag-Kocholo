        "text": "The University of South Florida women's basketball team looks to extend its winning streak to five games this weekend when it faces its final in-state foe of the season in Florida A&M, Sunday at 2 p.m. ... The game can be heard live in the Tampa Bay area on 1010 Sports with Garrett Walvoord handling the play-by-play and Amanda Miller providing color analysis ... Live audio and video can also be accessed by logging on to www.GoUSFBulls.com and clicking PressPass (subscription required) ... USF's current four-game winning streak is the longest winning stretch sicne the Bulls opened the 2006-07 campaign winning their first seven ... They would put together two three- game winning streaks last season after winning their first seven but could not extend it to four ... Sunday's game is the second of a brief two-game homestand for USF ... Following this weekend's game the Bulls will get a week off to prepare for the Caribbean Classic in Cancun, Mexico ... While in Mexico, USF will face Oregon (Dec. 18) and Belmont (Dec. 19) ... The Bulls are 20-11 against teams from Florida since head coach Jose Fernandez took over prior to the 2000-01 season, 13-4 since 2003-04 and 12-1 since the 2004-05 campaign ... USF comes into the game with Florida A&M holding a 36-13 record against regular season non-conference opponents since the 2004-05 season and a 16-5 slate since the beginning of last season ... The Bulls are coming off a 75-68 victory over North Florida on Wednesday in the Sun Dome ... Jessica Lawson logged her second consecutive double-double with an 18-point, 10-rebound effort against the Lady Ospreys ... It was just her second non-20-point game in her last five outings ... Gianna Messina added 15 points and ChiChi Okpaleke chipped in with her own double-double scoring 12 points and grabbing 12 rebounds ... Shantia Grace rounded out the double-figure scorers with 13 points ... Grace continues to pace USF averaging 16.7 points and Lawson is netting 16 points per contest ... Jazmine Sepulveda is third on the team in scoring falling just under double figures averaging 9.1 points per game.\n\nScouting Florida A&M\n\nFlorida A&M comes into Sunday's game sporting a perfect 7-0 record and a 1-0 mark in the Mid Eastern Athletic Conference ... The Rattlers are coming off a 66-57 win over Jacksonville in Tallahassee on Dec. 6.\n\nThe Rattlers have been led so far by Joslyne Jackson who is averaging 16 points per game ... She is one of four players in double figures for FAMU and is joined by Deidra Jones (14.4 ppg), Stephanie Foster (12.0 ppg) and Q'Vaunda Curry (10.4 ppg).\n\nDenise Tate leads the Rattlers on the glass grabbing 9.3 rebounds per contest.\n\nFAMU is coming off a 66-57 win over Jacksonville on Thursday night ... Joslyn Jackson poured in 25 points on a blistering 9-12 shooting from the field, including 2-2 from three-point range, and 5-8 from the free throw line ... Stephanie Foster scored 11 points, and both Denise Tate and Q'Vaunda Curry added double doubles with 11 points and 12 rebounds and 11 points and 10 rebounds respectively.\n\nThe Series vs. The Rattlers\n\nSunday's game with Florida A&M marks the 15th meeting all-time between USF and the Rattlers with FAMU holding a 10-4 all-time series lead, dating back to the 1972-73 season.\n\nThe two schools haven't met since Dec. 21, 2001 when USF defeated FAMU 89-66 in Tallahassee ... The Rattlers have won four of the last five meetings in the series.\n\nUSF vs. The Mid Eastern Athletic Conference\n\nThe Bulls are currently 13-12 all-time against teams from the Mid Eastern Athletic Conference\n\n... Despite there being 25 games played against MEAC schools, USF has faced three of its members in its 35-year history - Bethune-Cookman (8-2), Coppin State (1-0) and Florida A&M (4-10).\n\nUSF opened the 2007-08 season defeating MEAC member Bethune-Cookman 84-49 on Nov, 13 ... Jessica Lawson and Jazmine Sepulveda both dropped in 16 points apiece in the win.\n\nThe Bulls final home game of the 2006-07 season came against MEAC foe Coppin State in the second round of the Women's National Invitation Tournament ... USF handed the Eagles a 66-49 setback on the heals of 24 points and eight rebounds from Jessica Dickson, and 14 points from Rachael\n\nSheats ... USF also used a 20-3 run over the final 11 minutes of action to put the game away.\n\nThe Last Time Out vs. FAMU\n\nUSF and Florida A&M last met on Dec. 21, 2001 when the Bulls handed the Rattlers an 89-66 setback ... Sonia Cotton led USF with 22 points and Tristen Webb added seven rebounds in the win.\n\nThe Last Time Out\n\nUSF won its fourth straight game with a 75-68 win over North Florida ... The win marked the Bulls' longest winning streak since taking the first seven games of the 2006-07 season.\n\nUSF's win over UNF raised its record against teams from the State of Florida - this season - to 4-0.\n\nJessica Lawson led four players in double figures with a team-high 18 points and 10 rebounds ... It marked her second straight double-double, her third of the season and the fourth of her career.\n\nGianna Messina poured in a career-high 15 points while Shantia Grace added 13 points in the win ... ChiChi Okpaleke recorded her first double-double of the season with 12 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nThe Bulls were dismal once again from the free throw line hitting just 55.3 percent (21-38) of their shots from the charity stripe.\n\nUp And Down With The Rock\n\nSo far this season USF has been extremely inconsistent with protecting the ball ... In the Bulls' first four games of the season they recorded 83 turnovers and didn't have fewer than 20 in any one game during that stretch ... Last year USF recorded 20 or more turnovers (25 vs. Jacksonville, Dec. 20) just once.\n\nUSF head coach Jose Fernandez has said that his ideal target was to keep turnovers to less than 14 per game and during a two-game stretch the Bulls seemed to right the ship ... Against Stetson and Florida International USF had recorded a combined 19 assists in the two games combined including a season-low eight against the Hatters.\n\nThe Bulls, however, seem to have lost their grip on the ball once again ... In the past two games - against Saint Peter's and North Florida - USF has recorded a combined 34 miscues including 19 against UNF on Dec. 5.\n\nUSF comes into Sunday's game logging 136 turnovers on the year in just eight games while it took the Bulls 11 games last season the record the same amount.\n\nShantia Grace Named To Weekly BIG EAST Honor Roll\n\nShantia Grace was named on Dec. 3 to the BIG EAST Conference women's basketball weekly honor roll for the week ending Dec. 2, 2007 ... It is the first such honor for a USF player this season ... Last week Grace averaged 23 points per game in helping the Bulls to a 2-0 record ... She also averaged four rebounds, four assists and three steals per outing in the two games ... She poured in a career-high 29 points including 20 points in the first half against in-state rival Florida International on Nov. 29 in Miami ... In doing so, she was 5-15 from the floor in the first stanza against the Golden Panthers and 7-8 from the charity stripe ... She also dished out a season-high six assists in the win ... Grace followed her career-high with a 17-point outing against the Peahens on Dec. 1 in 40 minutes of action.\n\nUSF Was Treymendous Against Bethune-Cookman ...\n\nUSF wasn't shy about firing up the long ball in its season opener on Nov. 13 ... The Bulls were 11-30 (36.7 percent) from behind the arc against Bethune-Cookman ... USF's treys made was the fourth-most hit in school history, and the most since hitting 11 against UAB on Jan. 6, 2002.\n\nThe backcourt tandem of Jazmine Sepulveda and Shantia Grace combined for 8-11 from behind the three-point arc against the Wildcats ... Grace was also 5-10 from the floor on the night.\n\n... And Florida International\n\nThe Bulls also found themselves on fire from behind the three-point arc on Nov. 29 against Florida International ... USF shot 50 percent (9-18) from three-point range, including a 53.3 percent clip (8-15) in the first half.\n\nn USF's eight treys made against the Golden Panthers is tied for the 10th most in school history.\n\nJ-Law Making The Most Of Her Minutes\n\nJessica Lawson regrouped from a tough outing in the Bulls' lone exhibition game of the preseason where she was 0-4 from the field and 1-2 from the free throw line against the Miami Sun in 21 minutes ... Although Lawson saw just 18 minutes against Bethune-Cookman on Nov. 13, she tallied 16 points on 6-9 shooting from the field and 4-7 from the charity stripe ... She also grabbed six rebounds in the win over Bethune-Cookman.\n\nLawson had - what was then - a career afternoon on Nov. 18 against Illinois State despite it being in a loss ... The transfer from California poured in a career-high 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds ... It was her second career double-double and her first at USF ... She surpassed her previous career best of 19 points scored twice against Arizona.\n\nLawson followed up her 20-point outing (23 pts.) against Illinois State with another against Stetson ... She shot 7-11 from the field and was 6-8 from the charity stripe for 20 points in 25 minutes ... It is the first time of her career that she has recorded back-to-back 20-point games.\n\nOn Dec. 1 against Saint Peter's, Lawson surpassed her previous career-high set against Illinois State on Nov. 18 ... Lawson poured in 25 points and 14 rebounds against the Peahens on Dec. 1 ... It was her third 20-point outing in her last four games.\n\nWith her 18-point outing on Dec. 5 against North Florida, Lawson has recorded four double-figure games in her last five games played ... During that stretch she is averaging 18.8 points in addition to 10 rebounds per contest.\n\nAmazing Grace Is Back\n\nShantia Grace is back where she left off after the 2006-07 season concluded ... Grace leads the team in scoring averaging 16.7 points per game and leads the team in assists per game handing out 3.6.\n\nGrace recorded a new career-high with 29 points, including 20 in the first half, against Florida International on Nov. 29 .. That surpassed her old mark of 26 points against FIU last year on Nov. 30, 2006.\n\nGrace is the only player on the team to have scored in double figures in every game she has played in this year - seven ... Grace missed the New Hampshire game on Nov. 17 due to a coaches decision ... Coming into the Florida A&M game, Grace has netted double digits in the scoring column in her last seven games played and eight straight dating back to last year.\n\nGrace also comes into the weekend just 85 points shy of reaching the 1,000-point plateau ... Should she do it, she would be the 16th player in school history to accomplish the feat.\n\nGrace Moving Up The Charts\n\nShantia Grace continues to move up USF's career assist chart ... She came into the season No. 7 on the school's all-time list with 311 career handouts ... Her 25 assists so far this season has her in sixth place on the chart with 336 career handouts ... Grace is currently 29 assists shy of tying Anedra Gilmore (2003-05) and 30 from moving into sole possession of fifth place.\n\nRunning Like A Porche\n\nPorche Grant got out of the gate quickly against Bethune-Cookman on Nov. 13 ... Grant hauled down a career and team-high 14 rebounds against the Wildcats surpassing her previous best of 11 against Massachusetts on Nov. 26, 2006.\n\nGrant recorded her first career double-double on Nov. 20 against Stetson with a 10-point, 12-rebound outing ... Her 10 points was also a career-high surpassing the eight scored in her collegiate debut against Wisconsin-Milwaukee on Nov. 10, 2006.\n\nComing into the game with Florida A&M game, Grant is third on the team in rebounding grabbing 6.4 per outing behind ChiChi Okpaleke who is hauling down 7.6 boards per game.\n\nD-Bert's Big Night\n\nMelissa Dalembert had a huge night in USF's outing against New Hampshire on Nov. 17 ... Dalembert poured in a career-high 19 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in the 72-56 win over the Wildcats ... In 27 minutes Dalembert was 8-13 from the field and 3-4 from the free throw line.\n\nDalembert has two career starts under her belt in back-to-back outings against Stetson on Nov. 20 and Florida International on Nov. 29.\n\nDalembert is the sister of current Philadelphia 76er Samuel Dalembert.\n\nAll That Jaz\n\nJunior college transfer Jazmine Sepulveda has scored double figures in three of the team's seven games this season ... She tallied 16 points in the season opener against Bethune-Cookman on Nov. 13 and established a career-high 17 points against New Hampshire on Nov. 17 ... She also had 13 points on Nov. 29 against Florida International.\n\nSepulveda is currently second on the team in assists with handing out 3.4 per game but leads slightly in total assists with 27 (just ahead of Shantia Grace with 25) ... The Brooklyn, NY, native dished out a season and career-high six in the season opener against Bethune-Cookman and fell just one handout short of that with five, twice, against FIU and North Florida.\n\nSepulveda hasn't only shot and distributed the ball effectively but has hit the glass as well ... She is currently averaging 4.6 rebounds per game which is good enough for fifth on the team ... She grabbed a career-high 10 boards in USF's loss to Illinois State on Nov. 18 from the point guard spot ... In her last five games - including the game when she grabbed 10 rebounds - Sepulveda is averaging 5.4 boards per contest almost a full rebound more than her season average.\n\nAlthough 10 of the 11 players on USF's roster have gotten the starting nod this year, Sepulveda is the only player to start in all seven games this season.\n\nUsing The Mitryk Scale\n\nCaitlyn Mitryk had the best game of her career at USF on Nov. 20 against Stetson ... Mitryk scored a career-high 10 points and grabbed a career-best six rebounds ... She also added three assists in 24 minutes of action.\n\nMitryk earned her first career start on Nov. 17 in the Bulls' game against New Hampshire ... She also got the starting nod on Nov. 29 at Florida International.\n\nGianna Picking It Up\n\nAlthough she is just averaging 3.4 points per game, Gianna Messina has been extremely solid for the Bulls off the bench ... The Tampa native scored a, then-career-high eight points - in 12 minutes - on 3-4 shooting from the field and 2-3 from behind the three-point arc at Florida International on Nov. 29 in Miami.\n\nThe following game against Saint Peter's, Messina teetered on the verge of a double-double without scoring a basket ... She would establish two new career highs with nine rebounds and eight assists in the win over the Peahens.\n\nMessina, offensively, had her best collegiate game of her career against North Florida on Dec. 5 ... She poured in a career-best 15 points on 4-10 (40 percent) shooting from the field including 3-6 (50 percent) from behind the three-point arc ... Messina also logged three assists and a steal in a career-high 33 minutes of action.\n\nJose Fernandez Etches His Name In USF Record Books\n\nTo say that being the head women's basketball coach at USF has been a work in progress is certainly an understatement ... Jose Fernandez comes into tonight's contest with a 106-109 career coaching record, however it has been what he has done over the past four seasons ... Fernandez has led the Bulls to four-straight postseason appearances - the WNIT in 2004, 2005 and 2007, and the NCAA in 2006 - all while posting a 81-52 (60.9 percent) record since 2003-04.\n\nAgainst Vermont on Dec. 28, 2006, Fernandez became USF's all-time leader in career wins surpassing former head coach - and former general manager of the now defunct Charlotte Sting of the WNBA - Trudi Lacey (1988-96) who held the top spot with 88 career wins.\n\nFernandez surpassed Lacey, who held the mark since 1996, accomplishing the feat in his 186th game, while Lacy took 215 out of 219 outings to win 88 ... The Miami native surpassed the mark despite having to include a rough 4-24 campaign in his first year at USF (2000-01).\n\nJose Fernandez vs. The Top 25\n\nUSF is 5-22 vs. teams ranked in the Top 25 of either the AP or ESPN/USA Today polls since Jose Fernandez took over prior to the 2000-01 season.\n\nUSF has already faced one Top 25 team this season when it dropped a 89-52 decision to No. 10/9 Duke on Nov. 15 in the ESPNU Invitational at the St. Pete Times Forum ... Duke is one of just two non-conference teams that the Bulls will face that are ranked in the preseason Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today Top 25 polls ... USF will take on No. 23/17 Vanderbilt on Jan. 2 in Nashville.\n\nNo. 3/3 LSU and No. 3/3 Connecticut - UConn both times when USF played them - were the highest-ranked opponents that the Bulls have ever faced ...
