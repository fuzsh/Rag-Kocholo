        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nCan dominate as a rebounder and as a shot-blocker when he's on his game. Tough and physical in the paint, takes up a lot of room, and can intimidate drivers coming into the lane. Knows his offensive limits but can still score effectively when needed. Foul-prone and very streaky: overpowering for stretches and invisible for others. Could stand to pass the ball more often. Has bounced around the NBA from team to team, and has clashed with coaches in the past. Somewhat prone to injuries."
