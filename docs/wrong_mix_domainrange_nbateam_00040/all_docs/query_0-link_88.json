        "text": "Kenny Thomas' confidence is so shot, he's bordered on depressed, wishing he'd get traded. Samuel Dalembert still hasn't recovered from O'Brien's decision to bench him, knowing free agency is approaching.\n\nNeither Thomas nor Dalembert particularly likes O'Brien, feeling he has negatively affected their games. The same probably could be said for Green, who was benched for two straight games\n\nDalembert at the 5 can be like another Ratliff. Kenny would not be a bad backup and can play both forward positions (a little small for the 4 though).\n\nThis is not a rumor people just a general question\n\nKenny Thomas no...I like him as a player but he is a 4, the Wolves are pretty strong at that position, now that griff is backing up KG. Samuel Dalembert yes...the Wolves need a weakside shot blocker like Dalembert because they get in trouble when they give up alot of penetration, because they dont really have anyone to bail out the permieter when those guys get beat. The Problem is what do the Wolves have to give up. The sixers arent taking Wally S, because they are already filled at the shooting guard & small forward position. They really need a PG, but Troy Hudson isnt the type of pg they need. They need a floor General, not a less talented version of Iverson polaying alongside AI. So that leaves Kandiman or Ervin Johnson's cap space potenial, Iam not sure either could entice them to part with Dalembert.\n\nBut Dalembert would really be a difference maker for tyhe Wolves at the 5 spot on defense. he cant score but they been getting by without point production since last year. So they can live with him not producing offensively. His defensive impact will make up for that. But wolves just dont have anything to throw their way unless, a package is extended and the Wolves take on one of their bad contracts, but Mchale wont do that. And he shouldnt do that."
