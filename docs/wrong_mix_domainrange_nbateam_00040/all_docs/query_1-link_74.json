        "text": "The Houston Rockets were blocked at the rim when they tried to acquire Pau Gasol as part of the Chris Paul trade/fiasco, so they’ll have to settle for the next best thing … Sammy Dalembert? I guess. ESPN reports: “The Houston Rockets have reached terms on a new contract with free-agent center Samuel Dalembert, according to sources close to the situation. Sources told ESPN.com that Dalembert has agreed to a two-year deal worth $13.7 million — $7 million this season and $6.7 million in 2012-13. But the Rockets have a team option for the second season that would allow them to buy out of the contract for a fee of $1.5 million. Dalembert told Fox Sports Florida on Tuesday night that he was on the verge of re-signing with the Sacramento Kings, but the Kings issued a news release Wednesday afternoon saying they had withdrawn their offer to Dalembert. The Rockets held a face-to-face visit with Dalembert early in free agency but made no secret that their dream target to replace the retired Yao Ming was Los Angeles Lakers big man Pau Gasol. The Rockets thought they had Gasol, too, only for NBA commissioner David Stern to step in and veto a three-team trade that would have sent Chris Paul from the league-owned New Orleans Hornets to the Lakers and Gasol to Houston.”"
