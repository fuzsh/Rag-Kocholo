        "text": "Things were starting to look up for the Sixers. They won three out of four games and seemed to be playing solid team basketball.\n\nBut that all came to a crashing end when the Sixers suffered one of their ugliest losses of the season Monday in Minnesota. The Sixers frittered away a 20-point lead against a young Timberwolves team and lost in overtime, 108-103.\n\nLosses like that are why media pundits have the Sixers buried at the bottom their power rankings once again this week.\n\nHere's Pattison Ave.'s weekly roundup:\n\n*ESPN.com demonstrated a positive outlook for Sixers' center Samuel Dalembert, despite the personal issues he's been going through in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that struck his native Haiti. They bumped the Sixers from No. 23 in last week's rankings to 21 this week, largely because of Dalembert's recent improvement on the court.\n\nAll those trade rumors. Tragic pictures from his earthquake-ravaged homeland every time he turns on his TV. And here's how Haiti's Sam Dalembert has held up over the past six games: 13.5 ppg and 14.3 rpg.\n\n*NBA.com touched on the same notion. Dalembert has been huge for the Sixers the last couple of games, while also taking a leading role in the earthquake relief efforts. They moved the Sixers up two slots from 26th last week to 24th this week.\n\nNot only is Samuel Dalembert leading the charge to aid earthquake victims in Haiti, but he's also playing his best basketball. Over the last six games, he's averaging 13.5 points, 14.3 rebounds and 2.8 blocks, while shooting 73 percent.\n\n*FOXSports.com believes the Sixers' frontcourt players aren't living up to their pay grade - something few Sixers fans would argue. They kept the Sixers at No. 24, the same ranking they held a week ago.\n\nElton Brand and Sam Dalembert would be considered useful role players if only they weren't paid like superstars."
