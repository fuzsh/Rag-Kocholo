        "text": "Lower Merion, which captured the Central League boys’ basketball title, went undefeated in the Central circuit for the first time since 1996, Kobe Bryant’s senior season.\n\nEvery year, the Aces come up with a few standout guards, but during the 2011-12 campaign, Lower Merion featured some notable size as well, with 6-foot-7 senior forward Darryl Reynolds, 6-foot-7 junior forward Yohanny Dalembert (brother of former 76er Samuel Dalembert) and 6-foot-5 junior guard B.J. Johnson.\n\nEarlier this season, Lower Merion head coach Gregg Downer was asked how the Aces’ size allows them to play differently than in past seasons, and he responded, “You can gamble more, and cheat a little bit more when you’ve got shot blockers in the back to clean up any mistakes you might make. You can apply [more defensive pressure], double-team, just be more aggressive in general.”\n\nVIDEO PLAYS BELOW\n\nhttp://eplayer.clipsyndicate.com/cs_api/get_swf/3/&pl_id=22545&wpid=10192&page_count=10&windows=1&show_title=0&va_id=3268282&auto_start=0&auto_next=0\n\nDowner called B.J. Johnson, “a talented, athletic scorer with excellent length,” Dalembert “an emerging big man and shot blocker” and Reynolds “a strong interior defender and developing scorer.”\n\n6-foot-2 junior guard Raheem Hall, a recent Main Line Athlete of the Week, has been averaging more than 14 points per game, as well as close to five rebounds and five assists per contest. Sophomore guard JaQuan Johnson, known as a hard-nosed, playmaking point guard, also has been supplying firepower at the guard spot for the Aces.\n\nAnother emerging sophomore has been 6-foot-3 forward/guard Justin McFadden. Noted by Downer as a heady player, he came up with some big plays in the Aces’ 71-31 Central League championship win against Upper Darby.\n\nOther Lower Merion seniors include 6-foot-2 guard Mike Robbins, an athletic winger with an all-around game; and 6-foot-2 Bryce Williamson, a hard-nosed, versatile forward. The Aces have a productive bench, including 5-foot-10 junior guard Bryan Shapiro, a strong defender and shooter; 6-3 junior guard Baird Howland, who is noted for his shooting and all-around skills; 5-foot-11 freshman guard Corey Sherman, considered a good shooter and ballhandler; 6-foot-3 junior forward Doug Cotler, an athletic post player; 6-foot-4 freshman forward Jule Brown, a slashing-type wing player; and 5-foot-10 junior guard Emery Shiffraw, considered a strong defender and hard worker.\n\nLower Merion (21-2) has been tough outside the Central League too – each of its losses were by three points (78-75 to Roman Catholic Dec. 10 and 68-65 to Emmaus (Dec. 28). The Aces, who are on a 15-game winning streak, have yet to lose in 2012.\n\nOn Saturday, the Aces culminated their drive to the Central League title, defeating Upper Darby, 71-31, Saturday evening in the league championship final at Penncrest High School.\n\nThe Aces used their trademark strong perimeter defense to trigger numerous steals, and relied on some red-hot shooting from three-point territory to outscore the Royals 40-6 in the second and third quarters.\n\n“We had lots of good shot-blocking at the rim,” said Downer in the Aces’ spirited locker room. “In our last game [a 57-38 win against Upper Darby], we thought we gave up too many drives to the basket, and I thought we clogged those driving lanes tonight.”\n\nHall led Lower Merion with 20 points, followed by Dalembert (13) and JaQuan Johnson (12 ).\n\nComparing the Aces’ performance Saturday night to their prior game against Upper Darby, Hall said, “We kept our foot on the gas pedal the whole night tonight, we didn’t let up at any time. The last game was at their place, but this game we felt we had our crowd [the Lower Merion fans] with us tonight, and that kept us going.”\n\nDowner praised Hall and added, “I thought Yohanny played very well, he was very active in finishing plays near the rim.”\n\nDalembert said, “We came out on fire tonight.”\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter"
