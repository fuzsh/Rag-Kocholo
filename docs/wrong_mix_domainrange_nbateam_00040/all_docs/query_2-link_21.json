        "text": "Some Post NBA Draft Analysis\n\nEditor’s Note: Shawn Ryan sent some thoughts before the 2010 draft. But time ran short and these thoughts were not posted. Shawn, though, was nice enough to use his analysis to create the post-draft tables. What follows are tables based on his analysis, some of his pre-draft thoughts, and some stuff the editor (DJ) threw into […]\n\nThe Washington Wizards Build for Something\n\nWhile some teams are looking at this year’s free agent market to rebuild their franchises, the Washington Wizards are taking a different approach. In the past week, the Wizards have drafted John Wall, acquired Kirk Hinrich, and now traded for Yi Jianlian. The results… well, not impressive. At least, that is the story told by […]\n\nRasheed Wallace Retires and a Preview of the Next Week\n\nRasheed Wallace has announced his retirement. Wallace was the 4th player selected in the 1995 draft. Across the next 15 seasons he posted the following numbers: $150 million in salary (according to Basketball-Reference.com) 1,088 games played 35,947 minutes played 15,860 points scored 68.2 Wins Produced 0.091 Career WP48 [Wins Produced per 48 minutes] If we […]\n\nTrading away your second most productive player when you lose?\n\nEditor’s Note: The recent trade between the Kings and Sixers has already been discussed from the Sacremento perspective by Mike Madden (a fan of the Kings). Now we have the perspective of Sam Cohen, a fan of the Sixers. One should note, this was submitted before the NBA draft. Sam Cohen grew up just outside […]\n\nGordon Hayward in the Lottery?\n\nThe Utah Jazz took Gordon Hayward with the 9th pick in the NBA draft. Imagine a world where Butler does not advance to the Final Four. In such a world, does a sophomore from Butler — who averaged only 15.5 point per game and shot less than 30% from the college three-point line — go […]\n\nThe PAWS40 Story Before the 2010 NBA Draft\n\nArturo Galletti, Andres Alvarez, and I were planning on presenting a wealth of material on the 2010 NBA draft. But time has run out and our plans were not realized (but we have high hopes for 2011!!!). At this point, all there is time to do is to present the Position Adjusted Win Score per […]\n\nArturo Galletti Evaluates 30 Years of the NBA Draft for the Wall Street Journal\n\nDavid Biderman of the Wall Street Journal has once again referenced Wins Produced in telling a story. Biderman’s story — Good News, Nets: Third Pick’s Better Than the Second – offers evidence that the second pick in the NBA draft is not necessarily better than the third pick. As noted, Biderman’s evidence is based on […]\n\nThe Trade of the Century?\n\nEditor’s Note: The recent trade between the Kings and Sixers will be discussed from two perspectives. The following is from Mike Madden, a fan of the Kings. An upcoming post – from Sam Cohen – will discuss this trade from the perspective of the Sixers. Mike Madden is a noble man living in the slums […]\n\nHow the Thunder Charged Forward (and How the Charge can Continue)\n\nJames Brocato graduated from Washington State University in 2009. He is currently attending Law School at Gonzaga University. He grew up a passionate supporter of the Seattle Supersonics, but their relocation to Oklahoma City in 2008 put him in an awkward position. Failed attempts to root for Phoenix and Portland made him realize that his […]\n\nNot So Final Thoughts on the 2010 Finals\n\nHere are the final Wins Produced numbers for the 2010 NBA Finals. And for those who are interested, here are the WP48 marks for players who played at least 10 minutes in Game Seven: Pau Gasol: 0.452 Derek Fisher: 0.283 Lamar Odom: 0.116 Kobe Bryant: 0.110 Ron Artest: 0.095 Andrew Bynum: 0.004 Jordan Farmar: -0.625 […]"
