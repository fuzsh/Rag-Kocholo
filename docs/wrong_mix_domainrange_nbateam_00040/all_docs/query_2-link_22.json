Was used as a third guard in the final season of the Richmond era, and then released a few weeks into the Adelman era the next year.\n\nCollege & Pre Kings Career\n\nActually played for fellow King Bobby Hurley's dad in high school, and was a good friend of the younger Hurley's. Went to college at Seton Hall where he set all kinds of three point shooting records, and was named Big East Player of the Year in 1992-93. He was taken by the Clippers with the 13th pick in the 1993 draft, and stayed with them for 4 years, including his best statistical season in 1995-96 where he averaged 12.4pts 4.3ast and shot .440 from beyond the arc. His role declined the next season with the arrival of another future King in Darrick Martin, and he was let go for the Kings to pick up in 1997.\n\nPost Kings Career\n\nAfter the Kings released him in 1999 Dehere signed with Vancouver for the remainder of the season, but was largely ineffective, and never played in the NBA again.\n\nPost NBA Career\n\nDehere tried Europe for a year (Germany), and mounted a short lived NBDL comeback a couple of years later, but his basketball career was over by 2002.\n\nHe now owns a restaurant in his hometown of Jersey City, runs a local charity, and has dabbled in local politics.\n\nStatistics With the Kings\n\n1997-98: 77gms 18GS 18.3min 6.4pts (.399 .379 .798) 1.4reb 2.5ast 0.7stl 0.1blk 1.2TO 1.9FL\n\n1998-99: 4gms 0GS 5.0min 2.3pts (.364 .200 .000) 0.5reb 0.3ast 0.5stl 0.0blk 0.5TO 0.5FL\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOTALS: 81gms 18GS 17.7min 5.7pts (.398 .372 .798) 1.3reb 2.4ast 0.7stl 0.0blk 1.2TO 1.9FL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Dehere\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/deherte01.html\n\nIke Diogu\n\nBorn: September 11, 1983\n\nNumber: 3\n\nHeight: 6'8\"\n\nWeight: 250\n\nPosition: PF\n\nYrs w/Kings: 2009 (1 year)\n\nHow Acquired: traded (POR/SAC) Feb. 2009 for Michael Ruffin\n\nHow Departed: free agency 2009\n\nAn undersized PF with a physical post game, Diogu was picked up midseason of a lost 17win 2008-09 campaign and barely played until he briefly excited Kings fans when out of nowhere he put up back to back monster statlines in the final two games of the season (32pts 11reb followed by 28pts 13reb). That was the last time he was seen in a Kings uniform however.\n\nCollege & Pre Kings Career\n\nDiogu had a big college career at Arizona State, averaging 21.4pts 8.8reb over his three years and winning both Pac-10 Freshman of the Year and Pac-10 Player of the Year as a junior. He was taken 9th overall in the 2005 Draft by the Warriors, but never was able to establish himself as more than just an undersized bench scorer, and began bouncing around the league, eventually landing with the Kings.\n\nPost Kings Career\n\nDiogu signed with New Orleans after leaving the Kings, but never played a game for them as he suffered a knee injury and chose to undergo season ending microfracture surgery. He returned a year later to play for the Clippers, and then very briefly in January 2012 for the Spurs, but that was his last NBA stop.\n\nPost NBA Career\n\nAfter the Spurs stint Diogu has played for multiple teams in Puerto Rico, China, and the NBA's D-League, where he was a D-League All-Star in 2014.\n\nStatistics With the Kings\n\n2008-09: 10gms 1GS 14.2min 9.2pts (.600 .500 .758) 3.9reb 0.3ast 0.2stl 0.1blk 0.6TO 1.4FL\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOTALS: 10gms 1GS 14.2min 9.2pts (.600 .500 .758) 3.9reb 0.3ast 0.2stl 0.1blk 0.6TO 1.4FL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Diogu\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dioguik01/gamelog/2009/\n\nJerry Eaves\n\nBorn: February 8, 1959\n\nNumber: 22\n\nHeight: 6'4\"\n\nWeight: 180\n\nPosition: PG\n\nYrs w/Kings: 1987 (1 years)\n\nHow Acquired: 10 day contract Feb. 1987\n\nHow Departed: released Feb. 1987\n\nCup of coffee backup PG who was at the end of a short career, Eaves was signed on a 10 day contract in February of 1987, let go at the end of it, and that was the end of his NBA career.\n\nCollege & Pre Kings Career\n\nEaves was a roleplayer at Louisville for 4 years in the early 80s, and was taken in the 3rd rnd (#55 overall) of the 1982 Draft by the Jazz. He actually got decent minutes for the Jazz his first couple of seasons in the league, but after being waived during training camp 1984 (his backup PG spot was taken by some kid named Stockton) he was never able to catch back on in the league, and got just a few weeks with the Hawks and Kings before his career was finished.\n\nPost NBA Career\n\nAfter being released by the Kings, Eaves turned to coaching, beginning as a scout for the Jazz, then pursuing a long career as an assistant coach at both the college and NBA levels. Most recently he was the head coach at North Carolina A&T for 9 years between 2003-2012.\n\nStatistics With the Kings\n\n1986-87: 3gms 0GS 8.7min 1.3pts (.125 .000 1.000) 0.3reb 0.0ast 0.3stl 0.0blk 0.7TO 2.0FL\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOTALS: 3gms 0GS 8.7min 1.3pts (.125 .000 1.000) 0.3reb 0.0ast 0.3stl 0.0blk 0.7TO 2.0FL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Eaves\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/eavesje01.html\n\nhttp://www.ncataggies.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=24500&ATCLID=204928256\n\nPervis Ellison\n\nBorn: April 3, 1967\n\nNumber: 42\n\nHeight: 6'9\"\n\nWeight: 210\n\nPosition: C/PF\n\nYrs w/Kings: 1989 (1 year)\n\nHow Acquired: drafted First Round (#1 overall) 1989 Draft\n\nHow Departed: traded (SAC/WSH/UTH) Jun. 1990 for Bob Hansen, Eric Leckner, a 1st rnd pick (Anthony Bonner was taken) and 2 2nd rnd picks\n\nPerhaps a bit unfairly maligned in Kings history, Ellison was the only #1 overall pick in Sacramento era history, and unfortunately it was a draft where no single player really deserved to be a #1 pick. A skinny 6'9\" shotblocker out of Louisville (roughly the same size as then Kings GM Bill Russel was when he played, which may have gone into the decision to take him), Ellison had earned the nickname \"Never Nervous Pervis\" for his unflappable demeanor as a collegian, but that was quickly perverted to \"Out of Service Pervis\" (supposedly coined by teammate Danny Ainge) as he was immediately injured and struggled through his rookie season playing in fewer than half his games. Ellison was too skinny and fragile for an NBA center, but very long and mobile, an excellent shotblocker, and a player with some real skills offensively and as a passer. Nonetheless his finesse game was a major disappointment to a team hoping to draft a franchise center with their pick, and after only a single season he was dumped for a package of mediocrities just before the 1990 Draft.\n\nCollege\n\nA 4 year starter at Lousiville, it might have behooved the Kings to notice that the finest moment of his college career probably came as a freshman, when he was named Most Valuable Player of the Final Four as Lousiville won the NCAA title. Thereafter he was very steady in his remaining three seasons, but showed very little statistical growth, and may have been drafted as much for the promise he showed as a freshman as for the player he was as a senior.\n\nPost Kings Career\n\nThe idea of Ellison as a draft bust became very firmly planted very early, but in the immediate years after his trade to Washington he looked like he might shed that label entirely. By his third year he was becoming the player the Kings thought they had drafted, and averaged 20.0pts 11.2reb and 2.7blks for Washington in 1991-92 and won the NBA's Most Improved Player Award. But he remained extremely injury prone, and after two major knee injuries that finished him for the following season, it was really a constant unending string of injuries and missed games that kept him from ever realizing his potential and reduced him to a declining reserve role for Washington and then the Celtics. His career still lasted 12 years (although he missed the entire 1998-99 season with injury), but overall he played in only 474 of a possible 892 career games.\n\nPost NBA Career\n\nEllison now coaches basketball at a private religious K-12 school, Life Services Academy, in New Jersey.\n\nStatistics With the Kings\n\n1989-90: 34gms 22GS 25.5min 8.0pts (.442 .000 .628) 5.8reb 1.9ast 0.5stl 1.7blk 1.8TO 3.9FL\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOTALS: 34gms 22GS 25.5min 8.0pts (.442 .000 .628) 5.8reb 1.9ast 0.5stl 1.7blk 1.8TO 3.9FL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervis_Ellison\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/ellispe01.html\n\nMaurice Evans\n\nBorn: November 8, 1978\n\nNumber: 5\n\nHeight: 6'5\"\n\nWeight: 228\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nYrs w/Kings: 2004-05 (1 year)\n\nHow Acquired: free agent Oct. 2004\n\nHow Departed: free agency 2005\n\nHyperatheltic roleplaying swingman trying to establish himself in the league (which he would -- he would go on to play for 10 years). Could jump out of the gym and gave you defensive effort, but was not a scorer and not yet a great three point shooter (his range only extended to the short corner three at the time), although he would become a classic 3 and D player later in his career.\n\nCollege & Pre Kings Career\n\nEvans was well on his way to a spectacular career at Wichita State, averaging 22.6pts as a sophomore, before he had a falling out with his head coach, who was publicly reprimanded by the university for exceeding practice limits. This led to Evans transferring To Texas, missing a season, and having a relatively modest senior season (15.6pts) which resulted in his going undrafted. After a very limited 10 game stint with the Timberwolves as an undrafted free gent, he was out of the NBA and spent two years in Europe trying to get another shot. The Kings were the team which gave him that shot, signing him for the 2004-05 season.\n\nPost Kings Career\n\nEvans went on to a long journeyman career as a \"3 and D\" guy, playing for 10 years total, and 7 teams along the way. He was also prominently involved in the NBA Players Association during the 2011 lockout, and made accusations afterwards that the reason his career ended after 2011-12 was because of his steadfast support of .former NBPA Executive Director Billy Hunter, who eventually lost a power struggle.\n\nStatistics With the Kings\n\n2004-05: 65gms 11GS 19.0min 6.4pts (.442 .329 .756) 3.1reb 0.7ast 0.6stl 0.1blk 0.5TO 1.6FL\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOTALS: 65gms 11GS 19.0min 6.4pts (.442 .329 .756) 3.1reb 0.7ast 0.6stl 0.1blk 0.5TO 1.6FL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Evans_(basketball)\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/evansma01.html\n\nhttp://lubbockonline.com/stories/021099/spo_021099078.shtml\n\nLawrence Funderburke\n\nBorn: December 15, 1970\n\nNumber: 51\n\nHeight: 6'9\"\n\nWeight: 230\n\nPosition: PF\n\nYrs w/Kings: 1997-03 (5 years)\n\nHow Acquired: drafted 2nd round (#51 overall) 1994 Draft\n\nHow Departed: waived 2004\n\nFunderburke was a smooth scoring big man able to hit from both the post and outside. He was no more than adequate in other areas of the game and undersized by NBA standards, but while backing up Chris Webber on the loaded Kings teams of the late 90s and early 00s he was able to be an efficient scorer off the bench. Funderburke took a bit of a road less traveled to reach the NBA, not debuting until he was 27 years old, and off the court would have been known as mature and involved in charitable work until his image got hijacked with the revelation in a 1998 Slam magazine article that he believed literally in biblical prophecy that the world was soon going to end (likely as part of the Y2K hysteria). He grew dissatisfied with his declining role as the years went by, and after tearing his Achilles and missing the entire 2003-04 season, he was finally released in February 2004. Overall he played in 316 games for the Kings over six years, starting only 7 of them.\n\nCollege & Pre Kings Career\n\nFunderburke began his college career at Indiana, but did not tolerate Knight's particular form of tough love, and transferred to Ohio State after his freshman season. In three years at Ohio State he played the inside to future King Jimmy Jackson's outside as they led Ohio State to national prominence. Jackson was the greater talent however, and Fundy's development seemed to stall out.\n\nThe Kings selected him in the 2nd round (#51 overall) of the 1994 Draft, but Funderburke chose to head to Europe for the first 3 seasons of his professional career, and did not return to the Kings to make his NBA debut until 1997, when he was already 27.\n\nPost Kings Career\n\nFunderburke would briefly attempt a comeback the following season with the Chicago Bulls, signing with them in the final week of the season and then playing sparingly in their playoff run, but announced his retirement after the 2005 season.\n\nPost NBA Career\n\nFunderburke graduated magna cum laude in Business Finance at Ohio State, and continues to run the Lawrence Funderburke Youth Organization for troubled youths, that he established back in 2000 during his playing days.\n\nStatistics With the Kings\n\n1997-98: 52gms 1GS 21.0min 9.5pts (.490 .143 .679) 4.5reb 1.2ast 0.4stl 0.3blk 1.2TO 1.1FL\n\n1998-99: 47gms 2GS 19.9min 8.9pts (.559 .200 .708) 4.7reb 0.6ast 0.5stl 0.5blk 1.1TO 1.6FL\n\n1999-00: 75gms 1GS 13.7min 6.4pts (.523 .000 .706) 3.1reb 0.4ast 0.4stl 0.3blk 0.5TO 1.2FL\n\n2000-01: 59gms 2GS 11.8min 4.9pts (.496 .000 .623) 3.3reb 0.3ast 0.2stl 0.2blk 0.5TO 0.7FL\n\n2001-02: 56gms 1GS 12.9min 4.7pts (.469 .000 .607) 3.5reb 0.6ast 0.2stl 0.3blk 0.6TO 1.2FL\n\n2002-03: 27gms 0GS 8.5min 2.7pts (.444 .000 .588) 2.0reb 0.3ast 0.0stl 0.4blk 0.2TO 0.9FL\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOTALS: 316gms 7GS 14.9min 6.4pts (.506 .118 .676) 3.6reb 0.6ast 0.3stl 0.3blk 0.7TO 1.1FL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Funderburke\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/fundela01.html\n\nhttp://buckeyeprep.blogspot.com/2014/01/lawrence-funderburcke-to-speak-at-bp.html\n\nLarry Drew:\n\nBorn: April 2nd, 1958\n\nNumber: 22\n\nHeight: 6'1\"\n\nWeight: 170 lbs\n\nPosition: PG\n\nYr's w/Kings: 1985-86 (one year w/Sacramento Kings)\n\nHow Acquired: Arrived along with the team after moving from Kansas City to Sacramento. He was acquired by the Kansas City Kings from the Detroit Pistons for a 1982 2nd round pick, and a 1984 2nd round pick.\n\nHow Departed: Traded on August 19th, 1986 to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Mike Woodson, a 1988 1st rd pick and a 1989 2nd rd pick for Junior Bridgeman, Franklin Edwards, and Derek Smith.\n\nHistorically, the most memorable thing about Drew was his being traded along with Mike Woodson and a 1st round pick that later turned out to be Hersey Hawkins. Both Drew and Woodson were starters on a fairly young Kings team that had just gone to the playoffs in their first year in Sacramento. The Key to the trade was supposed to Derek Smith, who had put up some great numbers for the Clippers. However he was coming off knee surgery and he was just a shell of his former self. The trade started a downward spiral that would last for years. Drew, 27 years old upon arriving in Sacramento, was an above average PG and and efficient scorer. In his four years at Kansas City, he averaged 15.5 ppg, 48.2% fgp, 2.2 rpg, 6.9 apg, 1.4 spg. He was also a good defender. Drew played in 75 games for the Sacramento Kings.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings Career:\n\nDrew spent four years at,(1976-80) and graduated from the University of Missouri. He averaged just over 12 ppg with a 47.6% fgp over that span. In the 1980 NBA draft he was drafted by the Detroit Pistons with the 17th pick in the 1st round.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nDrew played two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers (1986-87 to 1987-88). His final two years in the NBA were with the Los Angeles Lakers (1989-90 to 1990-91. He also squeezed in a year in the Italian league (1988-89) with Scavolini. He signed as and assistant coach with the Lakers (1992- 99. With the Pistons (1990-2000). With the Wizards (2000-03). With the Nets (2003-04). And with the Hawks (2004-2010). Finally in 2010 he got his first head coaching job with the Hawks. He was replaced by Mike Budenholzer after the 2012-13 season. On May 31st, 2013 he was hired as the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, and was fired on June 30th of 2014. He was the victim of the Jason Kidd debacle that took place after the new owners took over the team. On August 19, 2014, he was hired as an assistant coach by the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nStatistics With the Kings:\n\n1986-87: 75gp - 26.3mpg - 16.9ppg - 48.5%fgp - 32.3%3pp - 1.7rpg - 4.5apg - 0.9spg\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Drew\n\nhttp://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/larry-drew-1.html\n\nhttp://www.basketballreference.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=DREWLA01\n\nTony Delk:\n\nBorn: January 28,1974 in Covington TN.\n\nNumber: 00\n\nHeight: 6'2\"\n\nWeight: 189 Lbs\n\nPosition: SG/PG\n\nYr's w/Kings: 1999-2000 (one year)\n\nHow Acquired: August 16, 1999 signed as free agent\n\nHow Departed: Contract expired\n\nDelk was with the Kings just long enough for a drink of water. He only played in 46 games while with the Kings Delk was very athletic and more of a SG than a PG. Unfortunately, he was very undersized for a SG, and to make matters worse, he was a very inconsistent shooter, especially from long range. He's probably best remembered in Sacramento for scoring 53 points, while hitting 20 of 27 shots against us on january 2nd, 2001. While here, Delk was a favorite golfing companion of Rick Adelman.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings Career:\n\nDelk was a four player at the University of Kentucky, and in his senior year helped lead them to a national title. As a result, Delk was named the NCAA Basketball Tournament's most Valuable Player. Delk was drafted in the NBA's 1996 draft by the Charlotte Hornetts with the 16th overall pick. In 1997 he was traded to the Warriors where he played two seasons.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nIn August of 2006, Delk signed with the Greek team Panathinaikos in Athens. Helped then win the Greek Cup, The Greek Championship, and the European Championship. But he was released in May of 2007, citing incompatibility issues. He retired from basketball in November of 2007. On April 16th, 2009, Delk returned to his alma mater (Kentucky) along with college teammate Scott Padgett to serve on coach Calapari's staff. In July 2011, he was hired as an assistant coach by the New Mexico St. Aggies. In June of 2013 Delk left the Aggies to find opportunities closer to home.\n\nStatistics With the Kings:\n\n1999-2000: 46gp - 14.8mpg - 6.4ppg - 43.0%fgp - 22.5%3pp - 1.9rpg - 1.2apg - 0.7spg\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Delk\n\nhttp://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tony-delk-1.html\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/delkto01.html\n\nLloyd Daniels:\n\nBorn: September 4th, 1967 in Brooklyn N.Y.\n\nNumber: 24\n\nHeight: 6'7\"\n\nWeight: 205 Lbs\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nYr's w/Kings: 1996-1997\n\nHow Acquired: Signed as free agent.\n\nHow Departed: Released.\n\nLloyd Daniels time with the Kings was so short it's not worth talking about. He played in 5 games total and was released. His off court struggles are more noteworthy than his basketball accomplishments. A troubled New York playground legend, his addiction to drugs ruined his career, and indirectly affected the career of coach Jerry Tarkanian of UNLV. Daniels was brought to Tarkanian by Richard Perry, a man who was later found to have been convicted of sports bribery twice. When Daniels was arrested for drugs, it led to Perry, which led to an NCAA investigation of Tarkanian, who was suspended as a result. Daniels is yet another example of a career destroyed because of drug addiction.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings Career:\n\nDaniels was recruited UNLV, but couldn't meet the academic standards. Daniel had gone to 5 different highschools, and when he graduated, he could only read at a 3rd grade level. Tarkanian got him enrolled at Mount San Antonio College, a junior college in the Los Angeles area. On Feb 9th, Daniels was arrested for trying to buy crack cocaine, and that was too much for Tarkanian. Daniels bounced around professional ranks for the next 6 years, and went through drug rehabilition three times. On may 11th 1989 he was shot in the shot in the chest three times and survived. When Tarkanian was signed as the head coach of the San Antonio Spurs in 1992, he signed Daniels, a free agent, to a contract.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nDaniels played for the New Jersey Nets, and the Toronto Raptors. In his first game with the Raptors, he scored 22 points. In the 1995-96 season he played in Italy for the Scavolini Pesaro. He averaged 21.6 points per game. After retiring from professional basketball, he joined the Jason Williams Foundation and played charity exhibition games across the United States.\n\nStatistics With the Kings:\n\n1996-97: 5gp - 5.6mpg - 1.2ppg - 12.5%fgp - 18.2%3pp - 0.8rpg - 0.2apg - 0.2spg\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Daniels\n\nhttp://www.basketballreference.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=DANIELL01\n\nVinny Del Negro:\n\nBorn: August 9th, 1966 in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nNumber: 15\n\nHeight: 6'4\"\n\nWeight: 189 Lbs\n\nPosition: SG\n\nYr's With Kings: 1988-1990 (two years)\n\nHow Acquired: Drafted in 1988 in the 2nd round with the 29th pick.\n\nHow Departed: Contract expired (2 years) and wasn't resigned.\n\nVinny was a fairly popular player in his two year stay with the Kings. He played with a fiery attitude that helped make him a fan favorite. He was a decent scorer with a good midrange shot, but early in his career, struggled shooting the three. He handled the ball well, was a good passer, and an excellent free throw shooter. He had the misfortune of being on a very bad Kings team that went 27/55 in 1988, and 23/59 in 1989. No wonder he opted to play in Italy when his contract expired in 1990. He might be best remembered for being drafted by the Kings the same year as Rickey Berry, who committed suicide following his rookie year, the 1988/89 season.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings:\n\nDel Negro graduated after four years at the University of North Carolina St. He had the good fortune to play for the great Jim Valvano. Del Negro helped his team to four consecutive NCAA tournaments, and back to back elite eight finishes in 1985 and 1986. In 1987 he was awarded the Everett Case Award as the MVP of the ACC tournament for leading his team to the ACC tournament championship.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nFollowing Del Negro's two years with the Kings, he opted to play for Benetton Treviso (Italy) for two years (1990-1992). He returned to the NBA when he signed with the San Antonio Spurs where he played for six years (1992-1998). He played for Teamsystem Bologna (Italy) (1999), then the Milwaukee Bucks (1999-2000). He played one year for the Golden State Warriors (2000-2001), and the Phoenix Suns in the 2001-2002 season. From 2003 to 2006 he worked as a color analyst for the Phoenix Suns broadcast teams. His broadcast career also included occasional stints as an analyst for ESPN and for the San Antonio Spurs. He was named Director of Player Personnel for the Phoenix Suns for the 2006-2007 season, and was promoted to Assistant General Manager from 2007 to 2008. From 2008 to 2010 he was the head coach of the Chicago Bulls, and was the head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers from 2010 to 2013.\n\nStatistics With Kings:\n\n1988-1989: 80gp - 19.5mpg - 7.1ppg - 47.5%fgp - 30.0%3pp - 2.1rpg - 2.6apg - 0.8spg\n\n1989-1990: 76gp - 24.4mpg - 9.7ppg - 46.2%fgp - 31.3%3pp - 2.6rpg - 3.3apg - 0.8spg\n\nhttp://www.nba.com/coachfile/vinny_del_negro/index.html\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinny_Del_Negro\n\nTyus Edney:\n\nBorn: February 14, 1973 in Gardena, California.\n\nNumber: 5\n\nHeight: 5'10\"\n\nWeight: 158 Lbs\n\nPosition: PG\n\nYr's With Kings: 1995-96, 1996-97 (two years)\n\nHow Acquired: Drafted 47th overall (second round) in the 1995 NBA draft.\n\nHow Departed: Contract expired.\n\nTyus came to the Kings in the same draft as Corliss Williamson, the teams first round pick that year (1995), and another player that would never suit up in the NBA, Dejan Bodiroga, the 51st pick in the second round. By most standards, Tyus had a very good rookie year, averaging 31 minutes a game and 6.1 assists a game. He was one of the fastest, if not the fastest PG in the NBA at the time, and despite his height, (5'10\"), he was an excellent defender. He took over a team that was previously led by Bobby Hurley, who was a shell of his former self after his tragic accident. Apparently the Kings wern't convinced that Edney was the PG to lead them into the future, because in the following offseason they acquired Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf to compete for the starting job. When Edney failed to rise to the challenge, the handwriting was on the wall. At the end of his second year, his contract was up, and he was gone in search of greener pastures.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings:\n\nEdney was another in the long line of UCLA players that made it to the NBA. He played on the same team with Ed O'Bannon. A team that went on to win the National title in his senior year (1995). In 1992 he was named the most valuable freshman on his team. He made a step up his sophmore year by being named the MVP on the team. That same year he was also named to the 1st team all Pac 10 conference team. A title he earned again his senior year. He was also named 1st team all Pac 10 conference defensive team three years in a row. Historically, he's probably best remembered for hitting the winning shot against Missouri in the NCAA tournament. With UCLA down one point 78 to 77 and 4.8 seconds left on the clock, Edney took the in bounds pass in full stride and dribbled the full length of the court, through 4 defenders and banked in the winning shot over a 6'9\"defender as the buzzer went off. Missouri, a very good defensive team, not wanting to foul, played off the in bounds pass instead of pressing or trapping. They didn't take into account Edney's blazing speed.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nUpon leaving the Kings, Edney played one year with the Boston Celtics (1997-1998). He then headed to europe to play for Zalgiris Kaunas, who he led to the 1998-1999 euroleague title. The following year (1999-2000) he played for Benetton Treviso (Italy), who lost in the Italian League finals. He signed with the Indiana Pacers for the 2000-2001 season, which would be final adventure in the NBA. From 2001 to 2009 he bounced around europe playing for such teams as, Benetton Treviso, Lottomatica Roma, Olympiacos and Climamio Bologna. He played his last professional season with Cajasol Sevilla in 2009.\n\nPost Basketball Career:\n\nOn August 2nd, 2010, the head coach of UCLA, Ben Howland, announced that Tyus Edney had been appointed as the Director of Men's Basketball Operations. Edney is married to his wife Shewan, and they have a daughter, Kennedi, who is a world class gymnast.\n\nStatistics with Kings:\n\n1995-1996: 80gp - 31.0mpg - 10.8ppg - 41.2%fgp - 36.8%3pp - 2.5rpg - 6.1apg - 1.1 spg - 2.4to\n\n1996-1997: 70gp - 19.6mpg - 6.9ppg - 38.4%fgp - 19.0%3pp - 1.6rpg - 3.2apg - 0.8spg - 1.6to\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyus_Edney\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/edneyty01.html\n\nFranklin Edwards:\n\nBorn: February 2nd, 1959 in New York City, New York.\n\nNumber: 22\n\nHeight: 6'1\"\n\nWeight: 170 Lbs\n\nPosition: PG\n\nYr's With Kings: 1986-1988 (two years)\n\nHow Acquired: Traded by the Clippers to the Kings in 1986\n\nHow Departed: He retired after being waived by the Kings at the end of the 1987-1988 season\n\nEdwards was a part of the the trade that brought himself, Junior Bridgeman, and Derek Smith to the Kings in exchange for Larry Drew, Mike Woodson, and a first round draft pick. Edwards stay with the Kings was marred by injuries that allowed him to play in a total of 24 games in his two years with the team. At the end of the 1987-88 season, he was waived by the Kings, and he immediately retired from professional basketball at the ripe old age of 29.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings:\n\nEdwards graduated from Cleveland State University, and played all four years for the Vikings. He led his team in scoring his last three years, and during his junior year, he set the Viking team record for the most points scored by a player in a game, with 49 points. That same year he averaged 21.9 ppg, 4.5 apg, and 3.0 rpg. In the 1981 NBA draft he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76érs with the 22nd overall pick. He had the misfortune of playing in the shadow of Andrew Toney, and Maurice Cheeks. He played for the 76'ers for three years (1981-1984) and was a part of the 1982-1983 NBA world championship team, as well as both Eastern Conference championships teams, 1981-1982 and 1982-1983. Edwards played one year (1984-1985) for the Lancaster Lighening of the CBA. He also played one year (1985-1986) for the San Diego Clippers.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nEdwards is currently a color analyst for the Cleveland State University Vikings men's basketball television broadcasts.\n\nStatistics with Kings:\n\n1986-1987: 8gp - 15.3mpg - 3.5ppg - 28.1%fgp - 00.0%3pp - 1.3rpg - 3.6apg - 0.6spg - 2.1to\n\n1987-1988: 16gp - 25.9mpg - 8.3ppg - 47.0%fgp - 00.0%3pp - 1.2rpg - 5.8apg - 0.6spg -\n\nhttp://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Edwards\n\nhttp://www.basketballreference.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=EDWARFR01\n\nTony Douglas:\n\nBorn: March 16th, 1986 in Tampa, Florida.\n\nNumber: 0\n\nHeight: 6'2\"\n\nWeight: 195 Lbs\n\nPosition: PG\n\nYr's With Kings: 2012-2013 (22 games)\n\nHow Acquired: Traded to Kings from Houston on February 20th, 2013.\n\nHow Departed: Contract expired.\n\nDouglas came to the Kings as part of a larger deal that included Cole Aldrich and Patrick Patterson from Houston, in exchange for Thomas Robinson, Francisco Garcia, and Tyler Honeycutt. It didn't take long for Douglas to become a fan favorite with his in your face defense. He only played in 22 games, and considering his unfamiliarity with his new teammates, he played well, if somewhat inconsistently. Unfortunately he came to a team that already had two young point guards in Isaiah Thomas and Jimmer Fredette on the roster. Most fans bemoaned his departure through free agency at the end of the season. Which was understandable, since the Kings were a team in dire need of defense, and Douglas was arguably the best defensive player on the team.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings:\n\nDouglas originally enrolled at Auburn University, and although he had a very good freshman year, he became frustrated at having to play the Shooting Guard position. So at seasons end, despite leading his team in scoring, and being voted to the all SEC freshman team, he submitted his name for the 2005 NBA draft. After getting feedback from teams, he withdrew his name in time to remain eligible for College Basketball. After requesting a change to the PG position, and being refused, he asked to be let out of his scholarship so he could transfer to another school. He signed with Florida St. prior to the 2005-2006 season, but because of NCAA rules, had to sit out a year and didn't play until the 2006-2007 season. His Sophmore year was marred by a broken bone in his right hand (his shooting hand). But his junior year he showed improvement in both his ability to play point guard, and play defense. He averaged 2.6 steals a game that year. His senior year he led a team composed mainly of freshman and Sophmore's. Despite the lack of experience on the team, he led them to Florida St's first NCAA tournament berth in eleven years. It came to a bittersweet end when the player he was guarding hit the winning shot to end Florida State's run. His senior year he averaged 21.5 ppg, and made the ACC all defensive team. He was drafted 29th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2009 NBA draft, and traded that same day to the New York Knicks for a 2nd round pick in the 2011 draft, and three million dollars in case considerations. On july 11th, 2012, Douglas was traded, along with Josh Harrellson, Jerome Jordan, and 2nd round picks in the 2014 and 2015 drafts, for Marcus Camby in a sign and trade deal.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nJuly 18, 2013, Douglas signed with the Golden State Warriors, and on January 15th, 2014 he was traded in a three team deal to the Miami Heat for Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks. August 19th, 2014 he signed a one year deal with the Jiangsu Dragons of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nStatistics With Kings:\n\n2012-2013: 22gp - 17.1mpg - 6.1ppg - 43.0%fgp - 38.9%3pp - 2.2rpg - 2.6apg - 1.4spg - 1.1to\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toney_Douglas\n\nhttp://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3979/toney-douglas\n\nJimmer Fredette:\n\nBorn: February 25th, 1989 in Glen Falls, New York.\n\nNumber: 7\n\nHeight: 6'2\"\n\nWeight: 195 Lbs\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nYr's With Kings: 2011-2014 (3 years)\n\nHow Acquired: Drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2011 NBA draft, 10th overall, and traded to the Kings in a draft day transaction.\n\nHow Departed: His contract was bought out on February 27th, 2014.\n\nFredette arrived in Sacramento with great promise. He had just finished an outstanding college career and was one of the top college scorers in the nation. Yes, there were questions about his ability to defend, but no one doubted his ability to score. His jersey was already the top seller at the Kings store before he ever played a game. Jimmer mania was in full swing. What could go wrong? Well, everything went wrong. He struggled with his ballhandling, and wilted under the competition coming from Isaiah Thomas, the last pick in the 2011 draft. His confidence started to fade, which was reflected by his poor shooting, the one thing he was good at. Despite his struggles, Jimmer remained popular with the average fan. But as his shooting averages went up the next two seasons, his minutes went down. Thomas had a strangle hold on the starting PG position, and the Kings had brought in more competition with the addition of Ray McCallum. And on February 27th, 2014 the fantasy ended, and Jimmer departed via a buyout.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings:\n\nFredette played basketball for, and graduated from BYU. Unlike the one and done players of today, he was a four year player. He improved every year, which usually bodes well for the future, and before graduating he was considered one of the best shooters in all of college. His senior year he averaged 35.8 mpg, 28.9 ppg, and 4.3 apg. He was voted the 2011 National Player of the Year, and was also awarded the 2011 Best Male College Athlete ESPY Award. On June 23rd, 2011, Fredette was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks, and Immediately traded to the Kings in a three team deal that also included the Charlotte Hornets, along with John Salmons, Beno Udrih, Shaun Livingston, Corey Maggette, and Stephen Jackson.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nOn march 2nd, 2014 Fredette signed with the Chicago Bulls for the remainder of the 2013-2014 season.

Dalembert was an excellent shotblocker and rebounder, plus he also did a good job in man to man defense at the basket. If he had a fault, it was that he fancied himself to be more than that. He wanted a larger role in the offense. To be fair, he had a decent 15 foot jumpshot, which was good enough to keep the defense honest, but not good enough to be the number two or number three option on the team. Plus, he tended to be a turnover machine if he handled the ball too much. The larger mystery is why the Kings made so little effort to resign him. Especially when you consider that they gave up a young center with promise in Spencer Hawes and a solid, if somewhat inconsistent SF in Andres Nocioni. So at the end of the 2010-2011 season, Dalembert departed and took his shotblocking with him. The Kings have yet to replace him.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings:\n\nDalembert went to Seton Hall University and played on the men's basketball team for two years. His college stats were remarkably similar to his NBA stats. In his two years there he averaged 21.1 mpg, 7.1 ppg, 53.7% fgp, 0.4 spg, and 2.8 bpg. Dalembert was drafted 26th overall in the 2001 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76érs, for whom he played from 2001 to 2010 (eight years). During his last seven years there, he averaged 2.0 blocked shots per game.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nAfter leaving the Kings, he signed a multi-year contract with the Houston Rockets on December 26, 2011. On June 27, 2012, Dalembert was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks along with the 14th pick in the 2012 NBA draft, in exchange for Jon Brockman, Jon Leuer, Shaun Livingston, and the 12th pick in the 2012 NBA draft. On July 19th, 2013, Dalembert signed with the Dallas Mavericks. On June 25th, 2014, he was traded along with Shane Larkin, Wayne Ellington, Jose Calderon, and two 2nd round, 2014 NBA draft picks, in exchange for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton.\n\nOther Activities:\n\nDalembert traveled to Haiti to help with the 2010 Haitian earthquake relief effort. He also pledged $100,000.00 to UNICEF. As a result of his contributions for the Haitian people, he won the 2009-10 J. Walter Kennedy Award.\n\nStatistics With Kings:\n\n2010-2011: 80gp - 24.2mpg - 8.1ppg - 47.3%fgp - 8.2rpg - 0.8apg - 0.5spg - 1.5bpg - 1.7to\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Dalembert\n\nhttp://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/samuel-dalembert-1.html\n\nC\n\nAnthony Fredrick:\n\nBorn: December 7th, 1964\n\nNumber: 41\n\nHeight: 6'7\"\n\nWeight: 205 Lbs\n\nPosition: SF\n\nYr's With Kings: 1990-1991 (35 games)\n\nHow Acquired: Free Agency\n\nHow Departed:\n\nFredrick hardly had a cup of coffee with the Kings. In fact, he barely had a cup of coffee with the NBA, playing for only 3 NBA teams over a six year period with some stops in the CBA and in Spain. He was drafted by the Denver Nuggets in the sixth round of the 1986 NBA draft (133rd overall). However, he never played a game for them, but instead started his professional career with the La Crosse Catbirds of the CBA (1986-1987). The Kings signed him as a freeagent during the 1990-1991 season. He was known as an outstanding defender, and a above average athlete. At the end of the 1990-1991 season the Kings decided not to resign him.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings:\n\nFredrick attended Santa Monica College for two years, and then transferred to Pepperdine University for his final two years, where he earned all WCC honors as a junior during the 1984-1985 campaign. After starting his career in the CBA with the La Crosse Catbirds (1986-1987), he played for the Mississippi Jet's of the CBA (1987-1988). The following year he made his NBA debut with the Indiana Pacers (1988-1989). In the 1989-1990 season he played for Real Madrid (Spain).

Dorsey was part of a controversial trade that saw the Kings depart with Kevin Martin, Hilton Armstrong, and Sergio Rodriguez in exchange for Carl Landry, Larry Hughes, Joey Dorsey and cash considerations. Needless to say, Dorsey was popular with some fans, desperate for a tough big man. He did prove to be a very good rebounder in the limited minutes he played.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings:\n\nDorsey played his college basketball at Memphis Univresity from 2004 to 2008. He's remembered for calling out Greg Oden of Ohio St., calling himself Goliath and Oden \"The Little Man\". In their one meeting, Oden scored 17 points and grabbed 9 rebounds, while Dorsey scored no points and grabbed 3 rebounds. Dorsey was drafted 33rd overall by the Portland Trailblazers and immediately traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for the 25th pick (Nicolas Batum) in the 2008 draft. On Feb 18th, 2010 he was traded to the Kings.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nOn april 4th 2010, Dorsey signed a non-guaranteed contract with the Toronto Raptors.

He was the perfect fit on a team that came together quickly that year, and made the playoffs. In the six years he was with the team, he was a leader, a big brother, and the glue that held everything together. Fans quickly forgot that he was an ex-laker. And despite his chain smoking habit, he was very durable, playing no less than 80 games every year he was with the team except the shortened 50 game season. It could be argued that no player in Sacramento Kings history was more loved. The Kings made the playoffs all six years Vlade was with the team, winning 55 and losing 27 games in his final year. If Vlade had one play he could do over, it would probably be when he swatted the ball away with 2 seconds left in game four of the 2002 playoffs that bounced directly to Robert Horry who hit a three to win the game. When his contract expired at the end of the 2003-2004 season, the Kings didn't resign him. Although he ended up resigning with the Lakers, he developed back problems and played in only 15 games. On July 14, 2005, Vlade retired from basketball.\n\nPre Kings Career:\n\nDivac began his professional career in 1983 when he signed with Sloga from Kraljevo. In 1986 he transfered to Partizan Belgrade (1986-1989). His NBA career began when he was drafted 26th overall in the 1989 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. During this time period, he also played on the Yugoslavian national team. Though Vlade was a Serb, some of his best friends were Croatian. When the national team won the gold medal in the 1990 FIBA world championships, a fan ran onto the floor waving a Croatian flag. Vlade asked him to stop since it was the Yugoslavian team that had won the medal. When the fan refused, Vlade grabbed the flag from him and put it aside. Unfortunately this angered some of his Croatian teammates, many of whom would never speak to Vlade again. Vlade said that he would have done the same thing if it had been a Serbian flag. In 1996 Vlade was traded to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant. After his contract expired in 1998 he signed with the Sacramento Kings.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nVlade signed with the Los Angeles Lakers at the end of the 2003-2004 season, but struggled with back problems and retired after the 2004-2005 season. He accepted a position with the Lakers as a european liaison to help with their overseas scouting. On October 16, 2008 he was appointed a government advisor in Serbia for humanitarian issues. On February 2nd, 2009, Vlade was elected president of the Serbian Olympic Committee (a four year term). On March 31st, 2009 his jersey was retired in a ceremony by the Sacramento Kings. On August 20th, 2010 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall Of Fame. Vlade Divac is one of only six players in NBA history to record 13,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 3,000 assists, and 1500 blocked shots. The other five players are, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett, and Hakeem Olajuwon. There would be others on the list, (Chamberlain, Russell) but they played at time when no record of blocked shots was kept.\n\nStatistics With Kings:\n\n1998-1999: 50gp - 35.2mpg - 14.3ppg - 47.0%fgp - 10rpg - 4.3apg - 0.9spg - 1.0bpg\n\n1999-2000: 82gp - 29.0mpg - 12.3ppg - 50.3%fgp - 8.3rpg - 2.9apg - 1.3spg - 1.3bpg\n\n2000-2001: 81gp - 29.9mpg - 12.0ppg - 48.2%fgp - 8.3rpg - 2.9apg - 1.1spg - 1.1bpg\n\n2001-2002: 80gp - 30.3mpg - 11.1ppg - 47.2%fgp - 8.4rpg - 3.7apg - 1.0spg - 1.2bpg\n\n2002-2003: 80gp - 29.8mpg - 9.9ppg - 46.6%fgp - 7.2rpg - 3.4apg - 1.0spg - 1.3bpg\n\n2003-2004: 81gp - 28.6mpg - 9.9ppg - 47.0%fgp - 5.7rpg - 5.3apg - 0.7spg - 1.0bpg\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlade_Divac\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/divacvl01.html\n\nTyreke Evans:\n\nBorn: September 19th, 1989.\n\nNumber: 13\n\nHeight: 6'5.5\"\n\nWeight: 220 Lbs\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nYr's With Kings: 2009-2013 (four years)\n\nHow Acquired: Drafted 4th overall in the 2009 NBA Draft.\n\nHow Departed: Signed and traded to New Orleans in exchange for Greivis Vasquez. A deal that also sent Robin Lopez to Portland.\n\nTyreke Evans is one of the most popular players to play for the Kings, in the post Webber, Vlade era. Regardless of what you may think of him now, he exploded onto the scene, and the entire league took notice. The future suddenly looked bright. It appeared that the Kings had found a star on which to hang their hat. On December 1st, 2009, Tyreke was named the Western Conference player of the month. On December 21st, 2009, Tyreke led the Kings back from a 35 point deficit to beat the Chicago Bulls. He single handedly outscored the entire Bulls team in the fourth quarter. On January 4th, 2010 he was named Western Conference Player of the Month for the second straight month. On Febuary 12th, 2010, he was named the MVP of the Rookie/Sophmore game with 26 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, and 5 steals. On march 11th, 2010, he recorded his first triple double with 19 points, 10 assists, and 10 rebounds. At seasons end, he became the fourth player in NBA history to average no less than 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists a game. Joining the elite company of Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Oscar Robertson. Finally, on april 27th, 2010, he was awarded the 2009-2010 Rookie of the Year award. Unfortunately, His rookie year would prove to be his best while with the Kings. Like any new player in the league, his weaknesses became exposed, and then exploited. Evans was one of the best ball handling players in the league, and his ability to finish at the basket was unequaled. However, it was his inability to shoot consistently from beyond the three point line that came under fire. He also became a man without a position as some questioned his ability to run a team from the point guard position. Considering that Tyreke had played small forward in highschool, and wasn't switched to point guard until his 11th game at Memphis, he was new to the position. As a result, over the next three years, he would play small forward and shooting guard along with time at the point guard position. At the end of his contract, the Kings were unwilling to pay the market price, and instead worked out a sign and trade with New Orleans. A deal that brought Greivis Vasquez to the Kings.\n\nCollege and Pre Kings Career:\n\nTyreke attended the University of Memphis where he had been recruited by head coach John Calapari. Evans, who had played small forward in highschool, was switched to shooting guard at Memphis. He didn't make the switch easily, and struggled from the start. After 10 games, and perhaps prompted by an injury to Memphis starting point guard, Calapari started Evans at the point in game eleven. Evans responded by scoring 14 points, in addition to 10 rebounds and 8 assists. With Evans at the point, Memphis wouldn't lose another game that season until being defeated by the Missouri Tigers in the NCAA tournament. Evans was named Conference USA Rookie Player of the Week 8 times that season. It should be noted that as a highschool player Evans was compared to Tracy McGrady, was named co-MVP of the Jordan Brand Classic, and was named MVP of the McDonalds Highschool All American game.\n\nPost Kings Career:\n\nOn July 10th, 2013, Evans was traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in a sign and trade that brought Greivis Vasquez to the Kings, and sent Robin Lopez to the Portland Trailblazers. Evans had a reasonably good year for the Pelicans although his minutes were reduced a bit, down from 31.0 mpg to 28.2mpg. While his scoring average remained close to the same along with his rebounds and assists, his shooting percentages, particularly his three point percentage ended up being a reversal of fortune. After shooting a promising 33.8% from the three his last season with the Kings, he shot a paltry 22.1% for the Pelicans. But he did have him moments. On December 30th, 2013, he hit the game winning shot with 1.2 seconds left in the game. On April 14th, 2014, Evans scored a career high 41 points in a 101-89 victory over the Portland Trailblazers.\n\nStatistics With Kings:\n\n2009-2010: 72gp - 37.2mpg - 20.1ppg - 45.8%fgp - 25.5%3pp - 5.3rpg - 5.8apg - 1.5spg\n\n2010-2011: 57gp - 37.0mpg - 17.8ppg - 40.9%fgp - 29.1%3pp - 4.8rpg - 5.6apg - 1.5spg\n\n2011-2012: 63gp - 34.3mpg - 16.5ppg - 45.3%fgp - 20.2%3pp - 4.6rpg - 4.5apg - 1.3spg\n\n2012-2013: 65gp - 31.0mpg - 15.2ppg - 47.8%fgp - 33.8%3pp - 4.4rpg - 3.5apg - 1.4spg\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyreke_Evans\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/evansty01.html"
