The game against the Peahens can be heard live on 1010 Sports with Garrett Walvoord handling the play-by-play and Andrikk Frazier providing color commentary ... In addition, the contest will be televised live in the Tampa Bay area on Catch 47 with Drew Felios as play-by-play announcer and Amanda Miller as color analyst ... The game is also the first of a men's-women's doubleheader where the USF men's team will play UCF at 7 p.m. ... For the Bulls, Saturday will mark the first game of a three-game homestand before heading to Cancun, Mexico on Dec. 16 for the Caribbean Classic ... Prior to its trip, USF will face North Florida on Dec. 5 and Florida A&M on Dec. 9 in the Sun Dome ... Saturday's game is also the Bulls' second in the past 48 hours ... USF comes into the game with Saint Peter's boasting a 34-13 record against regular season non-conference opponents since the 2004-05 season and a 14-5 slate since the beginning of last season ... The Bulls are coming off a commanding 84-56 win over Florida International on Thursday night in Miami ... Shantia Grace poured in a career-high 29 points including 20 in the first half ...

Fans can bring an unwrapped new or gently used toy to Entry Three of the Sun Dome where members of the United States Marines Corps will collect the toys ... In turn, fans will receive a voucher good for a two-for-one ticket to that day's game ... The voucher, however, can't be combined with any other ticket promotion.\n\nScouting Saint Peter's\n\nSaint Peter's comes into tonight's game with a 5-1 record and on the heals of a commanding 77-52 win over Wagner College on Tuesday night in Jersey City, NJ.\n\nThe Peahens, who's lone loss came to Delaware State, 72-57, on Nov. 20 in Dover, DE, started the season 3-0 ... They also recently faced New Hampshire on the road where they defeated the Wildcats, 60-49, on Nov. 24 ... The Bulls handed UNH a 72-56 setback in the first round of the USF Best Western Roundball Classic on Nov. 17.\n\nSPC will face one other BIG EAST opponent this season when it takes on Syracuse on Dec. 22 in the Carrier Dome.\n\nLauma Reke leads three players in double figures for Saint Peter's averaging 14.3 points per game and also leads the team on the glass grabbing 6.3 rebounds per contest ... Tanie Kennedy and Charlene Riddick are also netting double digits averaging 11.1 and 10.3 points.\n\nJohnell Burts leads the team in assists with 34, and steals with 16, however has also committed 24 turnovers on the year.\n\nThe Series vs. The Peahens\n\nTonight's game with Saint Peter's marks the first meeting between the two schools.\n\nUSF vs. The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference\n\nTonight is the 11th meeting all-time between the Bulls and a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference ... USF holds a 7-3 edge against the MAAC and has not faced a school from that conference since defeating Niagara, 73-58, on Jan. 6, 2004.\n\nThe Bulls have faced current MAAC members Canisius (2-0), Fairfield (0-2), Iona (1-0), Manhattan (2-0), Niagara (1-0), Rider (1-0) and Siena (1-0).\n\nUSF head coach Jose Fernandez is 3-0 against members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference with wins over Manhattan (66-58) on Dec. 18, 2001, Canisius (78-57) on Dec. 28, 2003 and Niagara (73-58) on Jan. 6, 2004.\n\nThe Last Time Out vs. Saint Peter's\n\nSaturday's game is the first-ever meeting between USF and Saint Peter's.\n\nThe Last Time Out\n\nUSF won its second straight game on Thursday night with an 84-56 victory over Florida International in Miami ... The triumph was the Bulls' fourth straight over the Golden Panthers and improved USF head coach Jose Fernandez' all-time record against his alma mater to 4-0.\n\nThe Bulls shot an impressive 50 percent (9-18) from behind the three-point line against Florida International ... The nine made treys is tied for the 10th most in school history.\n\nNine of the 10 players that saw time for the Bulls against FIU ended up in the scoring column ... In addition, USF's bench came up big outscoring the Golden Panthers reserves 30-11 in the win.\n\nShantia Grace poured in a career-high 29 points, including 20 in the first half against the Golden Panthers ... Grace established herself early netting the first eight points of the game for USF and logging double figures with 11:23 left in the first half ... It was her fifth straight double-digit outing of the season and the sixth consecutive dating back to last season.\n\nChiChi Okpaleke scored a season-high 16 points off the bench and Jazmine Sepulveda added 10 points in the win.\n\nCaitlyn Mirtyk and Melissa Dalembert each got their second career starts while Dalembert earned her second consecutive.\n\nGianna Messina scored a career-high eight points on 3-4 shooting from the field and 2-3 from behind the three-point line in just 12 minutes.\n\nProtecting The Rock\n\nDuring the past two games USF has come a long way in terms of protecting the ball ... In the Bulls' first four games of the season they recorded 83 turnovers and didn't have fewer than 20 in any one game during that stretch ... However, in the past two outings, the Bulls have recorded just 17 - a season-low eight against Stetson on Nov. 20, and 11 against Florida International on Nov. 29.\n\nLast year USF recorded 20 or more turnovers (25 vs. Jacksonville, Dec. 20) just once.\n\nUSF Was Treymendous Against Bethune-Cookman ...\n\nUSF wasn't shy about firing up the long ball in its season opener on Nov. 13 ... The Bulls were 11-30 (36.7 percent) from behind the arc against Bethune-Cookman ... USF's treys made was the fourth most hit in school history, and the most since hitting 11 against UAB on Jan. 6, 2002.\n\nThe backcourt tandem of Jazmine Sepulveda and Shantia Grace combined for 8-11 from behind the three-point arc against the Wildcats ... Grace was also 5-10 from the floor on the night.\n\n... And Florida International\n\nThe Bulls also found themselves on fire from behind the three-point arc on Nov. 29 against Florida International ... USF shot 50 percent (9-18) from three-point range, including a 53.3 percent clip (8-15) in the first half.\n\nUSF's eight treys made against the Golden Panthers is tied for the 10th most in school history.\n\nJ-Law Making The Most Of Her Minutes\n\nJessica Lawson regrouped from a tough outing in the Bulls' lone exhibition game of the preseason where she was 0-4 from the field and 1-2 from the free throw line against the Miami Sun in 21 minutes ... Although Lawson saw just 18 minutes against Bethune-Cookman on Nov. 13, she tallied 16 points on 6-9 shooting from the field and 4-7 from the charity stripe ... She also grabbed six rebounds in the win over Bethune-Cookman.\n\nLawson had a career afternoon on Nov. 18 against Illinois State despite it being in a loss ... The transfer from California poured in a career-high 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds ... It was her second career double-double and her first at USF ... She surpassed her previous career best of 19 points scored twice against Arizona.\n\nLawson followed up her 20-point outing (23 pts.) against Illinois State with another against Stetson ... She shot 7-11 from the field and was 6-8 from the charity stripe for 20 points in 25 minutes ... It is the first time of her career that she has recorded back-to-back 20-point games.\n\nLawson has also been pretty automatic from the free throw line over the past two games ... She comes into Saturday's against Saint Peter's hitting 77.2 percent (17-23) of her free throws in her last three games including an 81.8 percent clip (9-11) against Illinois State on Nov. 18.\n\nAmazing Grace Is Back\n\nShantia Grace is back where she left off after the 2006-07 season concluded ... Grace leads the team in scoring averaging 17.4 points per game and leads the team in assists per game handing out 4.0.\n\nGrace recorded a new career-high with 29 points against Florida International on Nov. 29 .. That surpassed her old mark of 26 points against FIU last year on Nov. 30, 2006.\n\nGrace is the only player on the team to have scored in double figures in every game she has played in this year - five ... Grace missed the New Hampshire game on Nov. 17 due to a coaches decision ... Coming into the Saint Peter's game, Grace has netted double digits in the scoring column in her last six games played.\n\nGrace also comes into the weekend just 115 points shy of reaching the 1,000-point plateau ... Should she do it, she would be the 16th player in school history to accomplish the feat.\n\nGrace Moving Up The Charts\n\nShantia Grace continues to move up USF's career assist chart ... She came into the season No. 7 on the school's all-time list with 311 career hand-outs ... Her 20 assists so far this season has her in sixth place on the chart with 331 career handouts ... Grace is currently 34 assists shy of tying Anedra Gilmore (2003-05) and 35 from moving into sole possession of fifth place.\n\nRunning Like A Porche\n\nPorche Grant got out of the gate quickly against Bethune-Cookman on Nov. 13 ... Grant hauled down a career and team-high 14 rebounds against the Wildcats surpassing her previous best of 11 against Massachusetts on Nov. 26, 2006.\n\nGrant recorded her first career double-double on Nov. 20 against Stetson with a 10-point, 12-rebound outing ... Her 10 points was also a career-high surpassing the eight scored in her collegiate debut against Wisconsin-Milwaukee on Nov. 10, 2006.\n\nComing into the game with Saint Peter's, Grant leads the team on the glass grabbing eight rebounds per game and has pulled in 8.5 per outing in her last two.\n\nD-Bert's Big Night\n\nMelissa Dalembert had a huge night in USF's outing against New Hampshire on Nov. 17 ... Dalembert poured in a career-high 19 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in the 72-56 win over the Wildcats ... In 27 minutes Dalembert was 8-13 from the field and 3-4 from the free throw line.\n\nDalembert has started in the last two games against Stetson on Nov. 20 and Florida International on Nov. 29 ... Those two nods are the first of her career.\n\nDalembert is the sister of current Philadelphia 76er Samuel Dalembert.\n\nAll That Jaz\n\nJunior college transfer Jazmine Sepulveda got a fast start for the Bulls this season netting double figures in three of the team's six games ... She tallied 16 points in the season opener against Bethune-Cookman on Nov. 13 and established a career-high 17 points against New Hampshire on Nov. 17 ... She also had 13 points on Nov. 29 against Florida International.\n\nSepulveda is currently tied for the team lead in total assists with 20, along with fellow backcourt-mate Shantia Grace ... The Brooklyn, NY, native dished out a season and career-high six in the season opener against Bethune-Cookman and fell just one handout short of that with five against FIU.\n\nSepulveda hasn't only shot and distributed the ball effectively but has hit the glass as well ... She is currently averaging 5.3 rebounds per game which is good enough for fifth on the team ... She grabbed a career-high 10 boards in USF's loss to Illinois State on Nov. 18 from the point guard spot.\n\nAlthough nine of the 11 players on USF's roster have gotten the starting nod this year, Sepulveda is the only player to start in all six games this season.\n\nUsing The Mitryk Scale\n\nCaitlyn Mitryk had the best game of her career at USF on Nov. 20 against Stetson ... Mitryk scored a career-high 10 points and grabbed a career-best six rebounds ... She also added three assists in 24 minutes of action.\n\nMitryk earned her first career start on Nov. 17 in the Bulls' game against New Hampshire ... She also got the starting nod on Nov. 29 at Florida International.\n\nJose Fernandez Etches His Name In USF Record Books\n\nTo say that being the head women's basketball coach at USF has been a work in progress is certainly an understatement ... Jose Fernandez comes into today's contest with a 104-109 career coaching record, however it has been what he has done over the past four seasons ... Fernandez has led the Bulls to four-straight postseason appearances - the WNIT in 2004, 2005 and 2007, and the NCAA in 2006 - all while posting a 80-52 (60.6 percent) record since 2003-04.\n\nAgainst Vermont on Dec. 28, 2006, Fernandez became USF's all-time leader in career wins surpassing former head coach - and former general manager of the now defunct Charlotte Sting of the WNBA - Trudi Lacey (1988-96) who held the top spot with 88 career wins.\n\nFernandez surpassed Lacey, who held the mark since 1996, accomplishing the feat in his 186th game, while Lacy took 215 out of 219 outings to win 88 ... The Miami native surpassed the mark despite having to include a rough 4-24 campaign in his first year at USF (2000-01).\n\nJose Fernandez vs. The Top 25\n\nUSF is 5-22 vs. teams ranked in the Top 25 of either the AP or ESPN/USA Today polls since Jose Fernandez took over prior to the 2000-01 season.\n\nUSF has already faced one Top 25 team this season when it dropped a 89-52 decision to No. 10/9 Duke on Nov. 15 in the ESPNU Invitational at the St. Pete Times Forum ... Duke is one of just two non-conference teams that the Bulls will face that are ranked in the preseason Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today Top 25 polls ... USF will take on No. 23/17 Vanderbilt on Jan. 2 in Nashville.\n\nNo. 3/3 LSU and No. 3/3 Connecticut - UConn both times when USF played them - were the highest-ranked opponents that the Bulls have ever faced ... The Lady Tigers defeated USF 87-44 in Baton Rouge on Dec, 30, 2005 while the Huskies handed USF an 81-67 loss on Feb. 20, 2007 and a 74-54 setback on Mar. 4, 2007.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2005, DePaul - who was ranked No. 11 in the AP Top 25 and No. 13 in the ESPN/USA Today Poll - was the highest ranked team that the Bulls have ever defeated handing the Blue Demons a 79-77 loss in overtime ... The game was the inaugural BIG EAST opener for both schools ... USF's 74-58 win over No. 15/15 Louisville on Jan. 16, 2007 marked the second-highest ranked team that the Bulls have recorded a win over.\n\nUSF defeated No. 21/22 Notre Dame on the road in overtime, 68-64, on Jan. 28, 2006.\n\nUSF defeated No. 23 Tulane (69-64) on Jan. 20, 2002, and No. 18 TCU (89-84) in a double-overtime thriller on Feb. 2, 2004.\n\nUSF defeated three of its last seven Top 25 teams that it played in the Sun Dome (No. 18/18 TCU, No. 11/13 DePaul and No. 15/15 Louisville) with all three victories being conference wins (TCU, Conference USA, DePaul and Louisville, BIG EAST) ... The four losses came against No. 13/15 Michigan State (81-66) on Dec. 10, No. 10/9 Rutgers (66-65) on Jan. 11 last year and to No. 6/6 LSU (60-48) on Jan. 3 and No 3/3 UConn (81-67) on Feb. 20.\n\nThe Bulls are 3-1 in overtime games against Top 25 teams since Jose Fernandez took over for the 2000-01 season ... They've defeated No. 18/18 TCU (89-84, 2ot) on Feb. 2, 2004, No. 11/13 DePaul (79-77) on Dec. 7, 2005, and No. 21/22 Notre Dame (68-64) on Jan. 28, 2006. ... The only setback came at the hands of No. 8/8 Connecticut (75-65) on Dec. 1, 2004 in Storrs ... The UConn game was the first overtime game that the Huskies ever played in Gampel Pavilion.\n\nDome Sweet Dome\n\nUSF has dominated its opposition on its home floor of late and look to continue the trend this season ...The Bulls have turned in an impressive 43-9 overall record and a 25-4 mark in non-conference games on their home turf dating back to the 2004-05 season ... In addition, USF is 47-9 in the Sun Dome since defeating No. 18 TCU, 89-84, in double overtime on Feb. 2, 2004, unquestionably the defining game that has led to the Bulls' success over the last three years, and 29-7 on their home turf since the beginning of the 2005-06 season.\n\nUSF is 12-4 in BIG EAST games at home - since joining the conference for the 2005-06 season - and 22-5 in league games dating back to the 2004-05 campaign.\n\nUSF Inks Another Standout Class\n\nUSF head women's basketball coach Jose Fernandez has signed another standout recruiting class with the signing of four players to National Letters of Intent during the recent early signing period ... The Bulls have inked 6-3 forward Tawatha Tucker from Raeford, NC (Village Christian HS), 5-7 guard Jasmine Wynne from Jacksonville, FL (University Christian HS) and 5-8 twin backcourt mates Andrell and Andrea Smith from Lakeland, FL (Lake Gibson HS).

She has tremendous court awareness and presence, and the ability to make plays in the transition and hit the three-point shot.\n\nThe Smith tandem has been labeled as \"one of the best guard combinations in the country\" by the CGBR and helped Lake Gibson High School to a 23-5 record during the 2006-07 season ... Andrell is ranked No. 105 by the CGBR and No. 93 by the All Start Girls Report and has already tallied a 40-point game this season ... She is widely regarded as the true point guard and play maker of the duo ... She averaged 9.8 points per game last season for Lake Gibson and was tabbed an All-Class 5A honorable mention ... Andrea averaged 20.7 points per game last year proving to be a big-time scorer ... Last year she was named to the Florida Sportswriters Association All-Class 5A third team.\n\nUSF Picked To Finish Ninth In Preseason BIG EAST Coaches Poll\n\nDespite the loss of more then 60 percent of its offensive production off last year's team, USF still found itself picked near the middle of the pack in this season's BIG EAST Conference preseason coaches poll ...
