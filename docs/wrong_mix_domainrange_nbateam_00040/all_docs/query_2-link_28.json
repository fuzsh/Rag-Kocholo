        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — Spike Lee missed out. Knicks center Cole Aldrich should have played a starring role in Lee’s triangle documentary.\n\nWhether the preacher is Tex Winter, Phil Jackson or Derek Fisher, the triangle needs a big-bodied center who can post up, hit an old-school hook shot and pass well out of the low block.\n\nAldrich fits the bill, and the former Kansas center could have a future with President Jackson, according to a league source. Aldrich signed a one-year, $980,000 deal last July for the collective bargaining agreement’s minimum based on his five years of service.\n\n“I personally love the triangle, being able to have more opportunities to post up but also have the ball in your hands in the pinch post with the guard coming off,’’ Aldrich said after his 18-point, seven-rebound outing in Saturday night’s 135-129 overtime loss to the Kings in Sacramento. “There’s a lot of opportunities to get assists and easy buckets down.”\n\nAldrich, originally a Glen Grunwald acquisition, was the only Knick other than Carmelo Anthony re-signed as a free agent by the Zen Master. Though Fisher has found sporadic playing time for Aldrich, Saturday night, when he was pressed into a starting role, could mark a turning point in Aldrich’s season. There’s very little reason to continue watching Team Tri-tanic, but Aldrich’s development could be one.\n\nAldrich posted 12 points and a career-high 19 rebounds in Sunday night’s 101-79 loss to the Trail Blazers.\n\n“I think Cole has shown some of this previously, which is why we feel good about having him out there to start the game some of these nights Amar’e [Stoudemire] has been out,’’ Fisher said. “Cole is doing some really good things for us on both ends of the floor. We like what he brings. I don’t know if [Saturday’s performance] means he’ll break out and do this every night. But Cole understands what we’re doing on both ends and is pretty consistent doing it.’’\n\nAldrich, set to make his fifth start of the season Sunday night in Portland, has played in 21 of the first 33 games. He has averaged 4.8 points and 3.6 rebounds in 12.9 minutes. He’s averaging a double-double per 36 minutes — 13.4 points, 10 rebounds. It appears he had leapfrogged Samuel Dalembert on the depth chart even before Dalembert sprained his ankle late in Sacramento.\n\nAldrich willed the Knicks into overtime against the Kings, and maybe the Knicks would have stolen the game if he didn’t foul out on the opening possession of the extra session trying to control DeMarcus Cousins, who then took over the game.\n\nAldrich, 26, started over disappointing Dalembert on Saturday, when the team was shorthanded. He could easily assume the starting duties for the season’s duration as Fisher and Jackson look more at the youngsters with the season having spiraled out of control. Dalembert, who is on an expiring contract, is not a triangle fit because of his bad hands and lack of a post game.\n\nShane Larkin and Tim Hardaway Jr. also helped key the Knicks’ comeback from 14 points down with nine minutes left in the fourth quarter.\n\n“We have a number of young guys to have played key roles for us — from Travis Wear, Cole is still young and developing, Shane and Tim,’’ Fisher said. “A number of our guys are getting great experience learning how to compete and play hard every night. Even though we’re struggling in wins, some guys are getting great opportunities.’’\n\nAldrich, one of the more astute players on the Knicks, is the team’s representative to the players association and is often in conversation before home games in the locker room with union bigwig Ron Klempner.\n\n“I’m having fun, playing hard,’’ Aldrich said. “I know some nights are better than others. If you always play hard, most nights you’re going to be OK.’’\n\nJackson appeared lukewarm about Aldrich’s status during the preseason, but then he didn’t know Dalembert would be such a flop."
