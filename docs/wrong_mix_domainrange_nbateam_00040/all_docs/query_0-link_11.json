        "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks suspended center Samuel Dalembert for one game without pay on Tuesday after an undisclosed violation of team rules, the team announced. He will miss a game Tuesday night in Dallas against the Mavericks.\n\nDalembert is averaging 7.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game this season. For the first time since his rookie season, the Haitian big man is averaging less than 20 minutes per game. He's playing an average of 16.7 minutes as the backup center behind third-year big man Larry Sanders, who leads the NBA with 3.2 blocks per game.\n\nSanders is averaging a couple of double-8s on the year: 8.8 points and 8.8 rebounds per game.\n\nFor more visit BrewHoop.com\n\nThough Sanders has garnered more starts (32 to Dalembert's 19), the two big men have similar PERs (Dalembert sits at 19.8 while Sanders is 18.7). In a four-game stretch from Feb. 6-13 when Sanders sat out with a back bruise, Dalembert produced as a starter with averages of 11.8 points, 11 rebounds and a very impressive three blocks per game.\n\nMore in the NBA:\n\n• NBA Power Rankings: Can Heat overtake Spurs?\n\n• Dennis Rodman on tour ... in North Korea?\n\n• GIFs: The NBA's week in worst\n\n• Who doesn't like In-and-Out burgers?
