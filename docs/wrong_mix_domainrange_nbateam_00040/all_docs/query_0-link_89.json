You just have to wait and see them play, see how the teams are getting together, how fast they’re jelling. I mean, you never know. I’m surprised they got rid of him so quick. Gosh.”\n\nAfter Detroit lost in the Eastern Conference Finals for the last three years after making it to the NBA Finals the previous two years, team president Joe Dumars promised changes. But the summer came and went and the team remained intact.\n\nTrading Billups will eventually free up more time for Rodney Stuckey, the Pistons’ young guard.\n\n“I think it makes Denver better,” Sacramento coach Reggie Theus said. “Dumars has done a great job down there. He’s got something in mind. I think Allen is a great basketball player. They must really feel confident in Stuckey. There must be something they like.”\n\nl l l\n\nWhen Rider University’s Jason Thompson entered the NBA Draft last spring he was projected to go in the last third of the first round.\n\nBut Sacramento surprised a lot of people when they chose him 12th overall. Now, it appears they saw something others might have missed.\n\nWith Brad Miller out with an injury, Thompson has seen more playing time and he has not disappointed. In his first NBA game, he went for a double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds against Minnesota.\n\n“It was good,” Thompson said. “It wasn’t like I was looking at stats while I was playing. I was just trying to do whatever it takes, do the little things to help the team out. I was scoring and playing defense and getting some rebounds and it all worked out.”\n\nThompson continued to produce with 10 points and seven rebounds against Miami and 12 points and five rebounds against Orlando.\n\nSaturday night.\n\nOriginally Published: November 4, 2008 at 3:46 a.m."
