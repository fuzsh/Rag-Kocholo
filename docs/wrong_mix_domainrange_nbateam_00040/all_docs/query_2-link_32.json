        "text": "Hall of Fame Recognizes Leaders in Basketball for Humanitarian Efforts\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Mass. – The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced today the winner of the 2022 Mannie Jackson - Basketball’s Human Spirit Award. Honored for its outstanding humanitarian efforts, the 2022 award recipient is The McLendon Foundation. The foundation will be formally recognized in September 2022 during the Hall of Fame Enshrinement Weekend.\n\n“The Basketball Hall of Fame is proud to recognize The McLendon Foundation as the 2022 Mannie Jackson Award recipient,” said John L. Doleva, President and CEO of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. “The Hall is known as a place to recognize those who excelled in the game, but it is vital to also honor and celebrate leaders who have used their platform to leave a lasting impact on their communities and better those around them. The McLendon Foundation was selected as this year’s recipient to highlight their efforts in the McLendon Minority Leadership Initiative, which provides minorities a jump-start to their careers through practical experiences, networking, and instilling the principles of John McLendon.”\n\nEstablished in 2007, the Mannie Jackson - Basketball’s Human Spirit Award honors individuals who have found the game of basketball to be a contributing aspect of their personal growth and accomplishment, a place to develop an understanding of others and an avenue that has helped shape his or her growth into a recognized visionary leader. Winners must reflect the values of Mannie Jackson’s life-long mission to overcome obstacles and challenge the status quo, while taking responsibility for his or her actions and seeking the highest standard of excellence.\n\n“A Hall of Fame should recognize great athletes, but also the great people who are in athletics and are doing extraordinary things for the world around them,” said Mannie Jackson, the Award’s namesake. “The people we are honoring have all made tremendous efforts to better their communities and our nation in a variety of ways. We thank them for their contributions and willingness to lead in this space.”\n\nJackson, in addition to his business successes, is a Past-Chairman of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and a recipient of the NCAA’s coveted Theodore Roosevelt Award in 2015. A former Illinois Big Ten All-Star and a team captain for the Harlem Globetrotters, Jackson retired as a senior executive and corporate officer for Honeywell Inc. and in the early 1990’s he purchased the Legendary Globetrotters from bankruptcy. In 2002, the resurrected Harlem Globetrotters were elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Jackson was the first of three Black owners of a major sports and entertainment organization and his family’s charitable contributions have totaled over $15 million.\n\nIn 2012, Jackson penned his bestselling autobiography, “Boxcar to Boardrooms” and continues to donate generously to numerous causes including the University of Illinois, South African youth funds, cancer research and the Basketball Hall of Fame. He is also active in promoting the mission of the Mannie Jackson Center for the Humanities located in his hometown Edwardsville, Illinois, while serving as the Center’s lead investor. He was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nThe Mannie Jackson - Basketball’s Human Spirit Award Winner 2022\n\nThe McLendon Foundation – Founded in 1999 by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA), the McLendon Foundation honors the legacy of John McLendon through the McLendon Minority Leadership Initiative (MLI).\n\nThe MLI is a coach-driven initiative that provides diverse college graduates a jump-start to their careers through practical experiences and opportunities to build their network while instilling in them the values of John McLendon: Integrity, Education, Leadership and Mentorship. Participants in the initiative are known as MLI Future Leaders.\n\nIn the program, Future Leaders receive career exposure working in college athletics departments while also learning the importance of interviewing, networking, decision making, leadership, and career planning. In an on-going effort to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, an emphasis is placed on supporting HBCUs as well as universities with female coaches interested in supporting the initiative and serving as ambassadors.\n\nThe McLendon Foundation also provides eight postgraduate scholarships annually to minority students who intend on pursuing an advanced degree in athletics administration. These scholarship recipients are known as McLendon Scholars. Through the scholarship program and leadership initiative, the McLendon Foundation provides minorities educational resources, practical experiences and serves as a vehicle for networking, career advancement and advocacy on behalf of the profession.
