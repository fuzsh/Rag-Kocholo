        "text": "The Warriors are aggressively searching for a big man to bolster their roster, and this year’s free agent market offers several legit options.\n\nThe team has done little to hide its interest in Tyson Chandler — even general manager Larry Riley called the Dallas Mavericks free agent the top option. But Golden State would be happy with one of several other centers on the market.\n\nWhom the Warriors land when free agency kicks off Friday is not completely in their hands. It’s going to take a few things to fall into place for Golden State to get any of the coveted free agent bigs — the right price, the right fit and a desire within that player to come to the Bay Area.\n\nGolden State also might have to create salary cap space to make such a deal happen.\n\nChandler is expected to command somewhere between $12 million to $15 million in the first year of a new deal. But to finally get an impact player at center, such a steep price might be worth it to the Warriors.\n\nCertainly, Golden State won’t get a much better opportunity to solidify its middle. Here’s a look at the Warriors’ options.\n\nTyson Chandler\n\nAge: 29 (11th year)\n\nSize: 7-foot-1, 235 pounds\n\nStatus: Unrestricted free agent (Dallas)\n\nWhat he brings: New coach Mark Jackson and his staff are all about defense. To that end, Chandler is the ideal center. He finished third in Defensive Player of the Year voting despite averaging shy of 28 minutes, and he averaged 9.4 rebounds. He’s a proven shot-blocker, averaging 1.4 per game over his career. Chandler is one of the best finishing big men in the game, which is largely why he shot a career-best 65.4 percent from the field last season.\n\n“He plays hard every play,” said former Warriors center Clifford Ray, a noted big man coach who last worked as an assistant with Boston. “He does the little things. He’s tough. He doesn’t worry about when he’s getting ball. He just goes out and plays his game.”\n\nRisk: Besides being injury prone, Chandler leaves the Warriors wanting offensively. He’s never been one to create offense, so the Warriors would still need a place to turn for inside scoring.\n\nAttainability: Good. Chandler told ESPN.com he suspected his days with the Mavericks are over. He’s expected to command upward of $10 million, which means the Warriors will have to make a move to create cap space. Chandler also has interest from Houston and New Jersey.\n\nNene\n\nAge: 29 (10th year)\n\nSize: 6-foot-11, 250 pounds\n\nStatus: Unrestricted free agent (Denver)\n\nWhat he brings: The Warriors have been in search of low-post offense for years, but if they land Nene, their thirst for a back-to-the-basket scorer figures to be quenched. Over his last three seasons, Nene averaged 14.3 points on 60.1 percent shooting — and that’s on an average of fewer than nine shots per game.\n\nRisk: Nene (career average 0.9 blocks) is not the defensive presence the Warriors need in the middle. Over the same three-year stretch, he averaged 7.7 rebounds per game. Not terrible, but not great.\n\nAttainability: Possible. Nene is expected to command upward of $12 million in the first year of his deal. That exceeds the Warriors’ available cap space, which means they’d have to use their amnesty. Nene reportedly wants to leave Denver, but Golden State has competition from New Jersey, Houston and Indiana.\n\nMarc Gasol\n\nAge: 26 (4th year)\n\nSize: 7-foot-1, 265 pounds\n\nStatus: Restricted free agent (Memphis)\n\nWhat he brings: Gasol isn’t as polished a scorer as Nene, but he gets it done inside. His back-to-the-basket game, highlighted by his feathery touch, is developing. Plus he has a nice midrange jumper, and he makes his free throws (career 71.5 percent). His size alone would help the Warriors defensively.\n\n“He’s more of a traditional center,” Warriors big man Ekpe Udoh said. “He can step out and shoot. He’s a really skilled big man, and he can move a little bit for his size.”\n\nRisk: He’s not super athletic and is perhaps best suited for a half-court team. He needs the ball to be most effective, which might be a lot to ask considering the number of gunners the Warriors have.\n\nAttainability: Long shot. According to the Memphis Commercial-Appeal, the Grizzlies are planning to match any offer sheet Gasol signs. Still, offering Gasol a contract is a risk. If he signs an offer sheet with the Warriors, that salary cap space will be tied up for a three-day period.\n\nDeAndre Jordan\n\nAge: 23 (4th year)\n\nSize: 6-foot-11, 265 pounds\n\nStatus: Restricted free agent (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nWhat he brings: He’s young and loaded with potential. The most athletic of the options, Jordan figures to fit in with the Warriors’ desired up-tempo style while being a force on defense (he averaged 7.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 25.6 minutes last season).\n\nRisk: Jordan is more potential than production. The Warriors are already young. One might argue they don’t need to add another project.\n\nAttainability: Long shot. The Clippers, according to Yahoo! Sports, have offered Jordan a five-year, $40 million deal. The Warriors could still sign him to an offer sheet, though the Los Angeles Times reported the Clippers plan to match any offer Jordan receives.\n\nSamuel Dalembert\n\nAge: 30 (10th year)\n\nSize: 6-foot-11, 250 pounds\n\nStatus: Unrestricted free agent (Sacramento)\n\nWhat he brings: He’s big, experienced and somewhat of a defensive specialist with career averages of 8.3 rebounds and 1.9 blocks. He would instantly improve the Warriors on defense.\n\nRisk: He’s on the downside of his career and is limited offensively. He shot just 47.3 percent with Sacramento last season.\n\nAttainability: Highly unlikely. Dalembert told Yahoo! Sports his desired location was Houston. And Golden State’s interest is lukewarm.\n\n“He’s on the list,” one team source said. “But he’s near the bottom of it.”\n\nSleepers to watch\n\nGreg Oden (unrestricted): Questionable whether he’ll ever be healthy. But with his youth (23), size (7-0, 285) and skill, he might be worth taking a chance on for the right price.\n\nChuck Hayes (unrestricted): Undersized (6-6, 238), but the Oakland native brings the physicality and defensive presence the Warriors need.\n\nKwame Brown (unrestricted): He has evolved into a serviceable big man and figures to come at a good price."
