        "text": "At best, Dalembert would be a fallback option if Chris Andersen signs for more elsewhere or perhaps if Joel Anthony’s contract could be offloaded. But for as much as Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra talk about the Heat’s culture, I’m not sure that Dalembert fits that culture. I’m not sure he has the passion for the game that the Heat insist upon. If there is Heat interest, it would come later in free agency, if at all, and at the minimum, at the most. He hardly was impressive Thursday. I don’t know what Drew Gooden has done, but you would think with some of the Bucks’ struggles that they would be able to find minutes for him, perhaps instead of Dalembert.\n\n“The Heat will be definitely an option,’’ Dalembert told FOX Sports Florida before his Bucks lost to the Heat 110-87 in Game 1 of an Eastern Conference first-round series Sunday night at AmericanAirlines Arena. “It’s up to them and seeing what’s going to be out there. But at this point you want to be with a contending team. You don’t want to go backwards, so you want to chase that promised land.’’\n\nDalembert said the Heat continued to talk to him about signing for an even lesser amount before he got a two-year, $13.7 million deal with Houston just before the start of the 2011-12 season. Dalembert, who was traded last June to the Bucks, now says he would be willing to sign this summer for money similar to what he turned down initially from the Heat if it means going to a top team. “I’d look at the mid-level, whatever’s going to be out there,’’ Dalembert said. “If it is a real contending team, we’ll have no problem. So we’ll see.’’\n\nSamuel Dalembert is now facing the Miami Heat. Next season, he has interest in playing for them. The Milwaukee Bucks center becomes a free agent this summer. Dalembert, who had discussions about joining the Heat before last season, expects they again will be in the mix.\n\nA few months ago, it was announced that the Bikini Basketball Association is a real thing, and would be coming to Philly in 2013. They have announced their schedule on the league website, so fans of both basketball and scantily clad women can start getting excited. The season kicks of in June, with the first games on Saturday the 22nd. The Philadelphia Diamonds, however, will open their season at home on Saturday, June 29 against the Houston Inferno. It is still unclear where the team will play. In a side note, Melisa Dalembert, sister of former 76er Samuel Dalembert, will play for the Miami Spice. She played college ball at the University of South Florida and is currently playing professionally in Germany."
