        "text": "DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) -- The Dallas Mavericks have officially announced the signing of free agent center Samuel Dalembert.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed per team policy.\n\nDalembert, a 6-foot-11 center from Haiti, has appeared in a total of 774 games with Philadelphia, Sacramento, Houston and Milwaukee in his career. He has averaged 8.0 points, 8.1 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 25.2 minutes per game.\n\nThe 11-year veteran played in 47 games in 2012 with the Milwaukee Bucks, averaging 6.7 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.1 blocks, while shooting .542 from the field.\n\nDalembert was selected by Philadelphia with the 26th overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft and played for the 76ers for eight seasons (2001-10). Philadelphia traded Dalembert to the Sacramento Kings for center Spencer Hawes and forward Andres Nocioni in 2010.\n\nThe center played collegiately at Seton Hall for two years, averaging 7.1 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.83 blocks in 59 games. He currently owns the school record at Seton Hall for career blocked shots (267).\n\nThe move comes just days after the Mavs agreed to terms with guard Monta Ellis, who is in the process of signing to a three-year deal with the team.\n\n(Â©2013 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
