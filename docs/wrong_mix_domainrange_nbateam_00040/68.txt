(Sports Network) – Michael Beasley poured in a career-high 42 points and grabbed nine rebounds, and the Minnesota Timberwolves pulled out a rare road win, 98-89, over the Sacramento Kings.

Sebastian Telfair netted 16 points, while Wesley Johnson added 12 and seven rebounds for the Timberwolves, who had lost six straight overall and 17 in a row on the road dating back to last season.

Omri Casspi had a team-high 17 points, while Beno Udrih chipped in 16 and nine helpers for the Kings, who dropped the final three games on a four-game homestand.

Minnesota held a slim 74-72 edge going to the fourth and a Telfair layup a little more than two minutes in pushed the margin to 80-73.

Casspi hit a three-pointer to cut into the deficit, but Tyreke Evans, the reigning Rookie of the Year, fouled on the next possession with 9:02 remaining and the Kings never recovered.

Six straight points by Love in just over a minute gave the visitors a 91-82 lead with 3:51 on the clock, and it was at least a two-possession game the rest of the way.

The Timberwolves, coming off a tough loss to the Lakers, led 27-22 after the first quarter and extended the slight margin to 51-45 at the break.

They continued to play front-runner until a Samuel Dalembert alley-oop slam capped a seven-point run for a 64-62 Kings lead at the midway point of the third.
