        "text": "hi Jason,\n\nthanx for the reply!\n\nthat sounds about right.\n\ndoes anyone know what songs the band played on Skippy's final performance with them?\n\nthanx all!\n\nThere has been some new info about Skip that surfaced recently: after his release from Bellevue, he went to Santa Cruz to be with his family, and then went to Nashville to record. I like the first story better, but...\n\nTruly Fine Citizen\n\nReleased July 30, 1969 as Columbia CS 9912\n\nPeak chart position: #157\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJerry Miller - Guitar, vocals\n\nPeter Lewis - Guitar, vocals\n\nBob Moore - Bass\n\nDon Stevenson - Drums, vocals\n\nAfter Moby Grape '69 peaked at a paltry #113 on the Billboard album chart, Bob Mosley decided he'd had enough and left the band to join the Marines. The remaining trio, left with a contractual obligation to Columbia for one more album, proceeded to regroup in Nashville with bassist Bob Moore to replace Mosley, and recorded what I've always felt was a criminally underrated, flawed country-rock masterpiece - Truly Fine Citizen. The album was recorded over the course of three days and produced by legendary Columbia producer Bob Johnston, who produced classics by Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel to name just two. This album is almost universally panned for sounding like a contract obligation and sounding like the band members half-@$$ed it.\n\nThe biggest fault I see in the album is the use of Bob Johnston's signature production techniques of the time, namely drenching the electric guitar in reverb. Anyone who's ever heard the Byrds' Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde will know what I'm talking about. As far as Truly Fine Citizen sounding half-@$$ed or sounding like a contract obligation, I don't hear it. The \"human\" element to this album has to be heard to be believed; this is great music for the soul. Put this on and listen while staring out the window at the rain and you'll get it. Peter Lewis had to be coaxed into doing this album and ironically, he stepped up with some of the best material like \"Changes, Circles Spinning\" and \"Now I Know High\". Other highlights include \"Tongue-Tied\", \"Truly Fine Citizen\", \"Beautiful Is Beautiful\" and \"Treat Me Bad\". Unfortunately the album tanked upon its July 30, 1969 release, only climbing as high as #157 on the charts. At this point, Moby Grape's contract with Columbia was fulfilled and the band proceeded to go on hiatus due to legal wranglings and general disinterest.\n\nI think two songs on here (Right Before My Eyes and Changes, Circles Spinning) are among the best things Lewis ever did. Maybe even the best. Really fine songs, well sung. It is puzzling he didn't ever make a solo album back in the day. Now I Know High is just okay, and this is my least favorite version of Looper. Don's prominent backup singing is too overwrought for me.\n\nThe rest of the album has a few good moments but is mostly just okay. Though I generally like their work, Jerry and Don are my two least-favorite singer/songwriters in the band. Truly Fine Citizen and Treat Me Bad are decent little songs. Tongue Tied brings some of that classic Skippy feel to the proceedings. One wishes they'd been able to get him to participate... coming right off Oar, the finest album ever, he might have had something decent to add. For the record, Bob says he was out of the Marines by the time this was recorded, but declined to participate. Another too bad.\n\nI think your points about the album are well taken. Just another take real quick to build on your points...\n\nI think Truly Fine Citizen inadvertently goes a long way to prove that Moby Grape had talent coming out their ears. The fact that this band loses two of the most important members (arguably) and still manages to record an album even half as good as Truly Fine Citizen speaks volumes about the raw talent that exited within their ranks methinks.\n\nAccording to the notes in the Sundazed Oar CD release the recording dates were :\n\nDec 3 1968\n\nDec 5th 1968\n\nDec 6th 1968\n\nDec 12th 1968\n\nThis includes the bonus tracks on the Sundazed issue.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by Truly Fine Citizen . Although I was a very big Moby Grape fan back in the original era, I had never picked up the Truly Fine Citizen album originally. I can only speculate that I had heard it was a big dud and they were essentially finished so I passed on it , or I was in college and didn't have the money for everything and I purchased something else instead and never got around to it.\n\nAnyway, I am surprised by how much I enjoy Truly Fine Citizen at this late date in comparison to it's original release date.\n\nLike mentioned previously, Peter Lewis's songs really shine on this album, and most of the others are good to .. passable at least.\n\nI notice that some of songs sound \"Moby Grape finished\" on the record, while others sound more like demos than some of the actual demos presented throughout the Sundazed reissue series. I especially notice this in the quality of the vocals and vocal harmonies on some of the songs . The harmonies sound more like first or second attempts at vocals than the more polished sound of the harmonies I am used to with the Grape. Whether this was down to production money or time constraints I don't know , and don't particulally even care about at this late date. I enjoy the disc quite a bit , and it's a worthy addition to the catalog.\n\nOn a side note I'd like to mention that this whole Sundazed reissue series has reignited my passion for Moby Grape again and I think the whole reissue series has been wonderful and has really fleshed out the Moby Grape experience for me.\n\nP.S. The Sundazed Oar notes mention that Columbia documents list Dec 11th as a recording date also , but what if anything was accomplished on that date is unclear. David Rubinson also mentions that he cannot explain the break in recording after Dec 6th. He says\n\n\"I think he sent the first bunch of songs to me in New York. And maybe on the basis of what he sent me, I got him more time in the studio.\n\nI don't know if Old John is going to cover Oar in the future , but if not and any of you are Moby Grape obsessives you need it. it's similar to liking Pink Floyds first album and then getting one of Syd Barrett's solo albums. It expands the picture and the process of....losing touch with reality unfortunately.\n\n20 Granite Creek\n\nReleased in 1971 as Reprise RS 6460\n\nPeak chart position: #177\n\nPersonnel:\n\nSkip Spence - Guitar, vocals\n\nJerry Miller - Guitar, vocals\n\nPeter Lewis - Guitar, vocals\n\nBob Mosley - Bass\n\nDon Stevenson - Drums, vocals\n\nA quick step back...\n\nIn September 1967, the band formally notified manager Matthew Katz that they were rescinding all of their management contracts with him, including an addendum to the contracts which gave Katz exclusive rights to the Moby Grape name, due to violations of the labor code. In 1969, they filed an action with the labor commissioner requesting to formally set aside their contracts with Katz. The ruling was in the band's favor, and in 1971, with Bob Mosley and Skip Spence back in the band, the group signed a deal with Reprise Records.\n\n20 Granite Creek, the band's one and only album for Reprise, seems to pick up right where Truly Fine Citizen left off, but with less satisfying results. It's also worth noting that not all band members are featured on all of the songs. That said, the album definitely has its moments, such as \"Road to the Sun\", \"Apocalypse\" and \"Roundhouse Blues\". Overall though, one can't help but feel like these guys were spinning their wheels and weren't really sure what to do or why they were doing it. Upon its 1971 release, it was evident that Moby Grape's commercial fortunes wouldn't return as the record just scraped the bottom of the Billboard album charts, peaking at #177. At this point, Moby Grape hung up their cleats and called it a day and wouldn't be heard from again for several years..."
