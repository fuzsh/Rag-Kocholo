See ya in a couple days.\n\nBack cover:\n\nAnd some reading new matter:\n\nMoby Grape’s Peter Lewis: A rock and roll survivor, now on 'The Road to Zion'\n\nMoby Grape’s Peter Lewis speaks about the release of his latest solo the album 'The Road to Zion.'\n\nGoldmine1\n\nNov 18, 2019\n\nhttps://www.goldminemag.com/article...ock-and-roll-survivor-now-on-the-road-to-zion\n\nMoby Grape’s Peter Lewis: A rock and roll survivor, now on 'The Road to Zion' - Goldmine Magazine: Record Collector & Music Memorabilia\n\nBy Bill Kopp\n\nAsk a hardcore rock music fanatic to name the most underrated band of the 1960s, and the answer you’re most likely to get is “Moby Grape.” Though sometimes credited as an early example of country rock, Moby Grape could rock as hard as any San Francisco band. And they came up with catchy, single-worthy tunes; all five members of the band could write songs and sing. As one of the era’s few groups with three guitars, Moby Grape created musical fireworks without descending into musical chaos.\n\nBut today, Moby Grape is largely unknown outside the circle of pop music historians and serious students of ’60s rock. The ill-starred San Francisco Bay area band’s career was fraught with all manner of setbacks — arrests, battles with management, mental illness and a backlash to shameless over-hype by its record label — yet Moby Grape crafted a near-perfect debut album. The succession of records that followed 1967’s Moby Grape were arguably uneven, but all contained at least a few gems. Yet in the face of overwhelming adversity — the product of both bad luck and bad choices — the band never fully capitalized on its stellar debut.\n\nNor did Moby Grape ever completely break up. Though for many years the band couldn’t legally use its name — former manager Matthew Katz claimed ownership of it — the musicians got together often, billing themselves as The Melvilles, Mosley Grape, Fine Wine, Legendary Grape and even Maby Grope. The group’s history is one filled with heartbreak, gallows humor and — most of all — some great music.\n\nThe Road to Zion, a collection of songs some of which date back many years. He says that at this point in his life and career, he doesn’t feel the need to “write a cool song anymore. It’s more (about) trying to communicate something about life that I’ve learned,” he says.\n\nOne of those life lessons came in 1983 when Lewis was part of a backing group playing at the opening ceremonies for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He recalls the glad-handing and schmoozing that was part and parcel of the experience. “You’re expected to interact with all these people, the public side of the music business where you’re there to just be part of this carnival scene.” Making the point that for the most part, being a musician is a solitary endeavor, he admits that “I went back to my hotel room, thinking about how much I would like to not have been there.”\n\nThat program also included an ad hoc band made up of what Lewis describes as “writers who play music for fun.” He says that their performance felt like a mean-spirited parody of real, working musicians. “They were all up there in costumes and making fun of music,” he recalls. “It just seemed so far away from the ’60s.” The unpleasant experience did have an upside; it would yield “In This Place,” a standout track on Lewis’ The Road to Zion.\n\nThe songs on Lewis’ new album are rooted in a country-rock style that will sound warmly familiar to listeners who enjoyed 1968’s Wow. “The Road to Zion” would be right at home on Moby Grape ‘69, and “When I’m Gone” bears a melodic resemblance of the title track off Moby Grape’s fourth album, 1969’s Truly Fine Citizen. Lewis is in fine voice throughout the 11 songs on The Road to Zion, hitting occasional high notes with ease and exploring the sonic textures found in a variety of electric and acoustic guitars.\n\nLewis has some experience distilling inspired music from difficult situations. His powerful “Fall On You” for Moby Grape is an uptempo rocker, but its lyrics focus on pain, betrayal and loss. And sometimes — as with another song on Moby Grape’s debut album —the equation worked in the reverse direction. Lewis says that when he wrote the melancholy “Sitting by the Window,” he “had a marriage that worked, and everything. But then when that song got out there, in a weird way, that song started singing me. I ended up a year later without a marriage; I became that guy in the song.”\n\nHis problems at the time weren’t nearly as severe as those facing Spence, who famously came at bandmates Miller and Stevenson with a fire axe. Mosley suffered a breakdown of sorts as well in 1969, abruptly quitting the band and enlisting in the Marines (he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and discharged within months of joining).\n\nLewis — who has been asked about his bandmates’ problems countless times, and who has had decades to consider the subject — has his own take on their challenges. “When you look at what happened to Skip or Bobby, part of what that is, I think, just the metaphysics of fame,” he suggests. “They get out there and they show people a certain character, however they’re dealing with their career, however seriously they take their music. And that can sort of get you in a feedback loop with the future. And then, (they can suffer) not knowing how to deal with that, trying to make it real.”\n\nfifth album: 20 Granite Creek (1971)\n\nSkippy's back...\n\n20 Granite Creek is the rock band Moby Grape's fifth album. After recording their last album for Columbia Records, Truly Fine Citizen, the band went on hiatus until 1971 when they reunited with Skip Spence and Bob Mosley and recorded this reunion album for Reprise Records; their only album for the label.\n\nDavid Rubinson, who produced most of the band's Columbia albums, was back as producer here, as well as serving as the band's manager.[citation needed]. The album title refers to an address near Santa Cruz, CA but there is no record that any band member ever lived there. The rights to this album are now owned by Matthew Katz [of course they are ] and is available on his San Francisco Sound label catalog number SFS 04499. It is no longer on Reprise.\n\nReviewing for Rolling Stone in 1971, music critic Richard Meltzer found the album remarkable and said that it \"proves that without an audience and with all the members of the original Grape aboard ship they can outdo Truly Fine Citizen with their eyes closed.\"[3] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice found it drab and marred by kotos,[4] but warmed to the album over time; in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), he said Moby Grape sounds intense and hopeful for a band in decline: \"You can hear the country undertone now, but you can also hear why you missed it—at their most lyrical these guys never lay back, and lyricism is something they're usually rocking too hard to bother with, though their compact forms guarantee poetic justice.\"[2] -wiki\n\nSide one\n\n\"Gypsy Wedding\" (Mosley) – 2:30\n\n\"I'm the Kind of Man That Baby You Can Trust\" (Miller) – 2:38\n\n\"About Time\" (Stevenson) – 2:52\n\n\"Goin' Down to Texas\" (Lewis) – 2:00\n\n\"Road to the Sun\" (Mosley) – 2:48\n\n\"Apocalypse\" (Lewis) – 2:11\n\nSide two\n\n\"Chinese Song\" (Spence) – 5:42\n\n\"Roundhouse Blues\" (Miller) – 2:45\n\n\"Ode to the Man at the End of the Bar\" (Andy Mosley) – 3:43\n\n\"Wild Oats Moan\" (Miller, Stevenson) – 3:12\n\n\"Horse Out in the Rain\" (Lewis) – 2:20\n\nPersonnel[edit]\n\nPeter Lewis - rhythm guitar, vocals\n\nJerry Miller - lead guitar, vocals\n\nBob Mosley - bass, vocals\n\nSkip Spence - rhythm guitar, vocals\n\nDon Stevenson - drums, vocals\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nJeffrey Cohen - bass\n\nAndy Narell - steel drums\n\nDavid Rubinson - electric piano, congas\n\nGordon Stevens - electric viola, dobro, mandolin"
