Moby Grape: Naked, If I Want To (Jerry Miller) 1967\n\nMoby Grape: Columbia Records  CL 2698\n\nGrape Notes\n\nThe Members:\n\nDon Stevenson (born October 15, 1942, Seattle, Washington)\n\nfirst obtained local recognition as a member of The Frantics, a band based in Seattle and including fellow Washingtonian Jerry Miller (from Tacoma) on guitar. The band relocated to San Francisco in 1966 and formed the nucleus of what became Moby Grape.\n\nJerry Miller (born July 10, 1943 in Tacoma, Washington)\n\nJerry Miller's professional career began in the late 1950s, playing and recording with popular Northwest dance-rock bands including The Elegants. He was apparently a member of The Kingsmen (of Louie Louie fame) at one time, with promotional photos that exist as evidence of that. He contributed guitar work to an early version of the hit record I Fought the Law by The Bobby Fuller Four, and toured with Bobby Fuller in his predecessor group to The Bobby Fuller Four\n\nAlexander Lee \"Skip\" Spence (April 18, 1946  April 16, 1999 b. Windsor ON)\n\ndrummed on Jefferson Airplane's debut album, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off, and was dismissed by the band after taking an unannounced vacation to Mexico. He briefly considered joining Buffalo Springfield as a drummer before returning to the guitar to co-found Moby Grape. Spence died of lung cancer two days before his 53rd birthday.\n\nPeter Lewis (born July 15, 1945)\n\nis the younger of two sons by actress Loretta Young (1913-2000) and writer-producer Tom Lewis (d. 1988), and is apparently a cousin of guitarist David Lindley.\n\nBob Mosley (born The bobmeister Mosley; December 4, 1942, in Paradise Valley, California)\n\n\"In 1996, Peter Lewis picked me up along the side of a San Diego freeway where I was living, to tell me a ruling by San Francisco Judge Garcia gave Moby Grape their name back. I was ready to go to work again.\"\n\nThe group was formed in late 1966 in San Francisco by Skip Spence, former drummer of Jefferson Airplane.\n\nJerry Miller and Don Stevenson had moved with The Frantics from Seattle to San Francisco after a 1965 meeting with Jerry Garcia.\n\nTheir name came from the punch line of the joke \"What's big and purple and lives in the ocean?\n\nThe band had three guitar players: Spence on rhythm; Peter Lewis fingerpicking; Jerry Miller, lead. Bob Mosley played bass and Don Stevenson, drums.\n\nAll MG members wrote songs and sung lead vocals\n\nReleased 5 singles simultaneously - probably the only recording artists to ever do that. It actually worked against them!\n\nRecorded 2 different renditions of Naked, If I Want To released on their 1st & 2nd albums\n\nBalked at being filmed at Monterey Pop Fest:\n\nThe group appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival on Saturday, June 17, 1967. Due to legal and managerial disputes, the group was not included in the D.A. Pennebaker-produced film of the event, Monterey Pop. Moby Grape's Monterey recordings and film remain unreleased, allegedly because Matthew Katz demanded one million dollars for the rights.\n\nThe flag behind Skip Spence on the cover of the first album is actually a United States flag that Columbia Records decided to obscure through airbrushing, presumably due to the political climate of the times. Because Don Stevenson thought that the photographer was an asshole he 'flipped the bird' at him, hoping he wouldn't get to do the album cover; it was used anyway. After the first pressing of 250,000 albums, the finger was airbrushed off subsequent covers.\n\nThe bands second album Wow included the track \"Just Like Gene Autry, a Foxtrot\", a tribute to the ballroom music big band era which was tracked to only be played back properly at the speed of 78 RPM and featured Arthur Godfrey on banjo and ukulele.\n\nEarly copies of 'Wow' omit the band's name from the record label, for unknown reasons. It was released as a 2 album set with Grape Jam for the price of a regular LP.\n\nGrape Jam: a jam session that included Al Kooper and Michael Bloomfield, was the inspiration for a number of other studio \"jam\" albums during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Later examples of this included Al Kooper's Super Session and the 3rd LP of George Harrison's All Things Must Pass.\n\nMoby Grape's success was significantly impeded by decades-long legal disputes with their former manager, Matthew Katz. Legal difficulties originated shortly after the group's formation, when Matthew Katz insisted that an additional provision be added to his management contract, giving him ownership of the group name. The dispute with Katz became more acute after the group members' rights to their songs, as well as their own name, were signed away in 1973, in a settlement made without their knowledge between Katz and Moby Grape's then manager (and former producer), David Rubinson.\n\nRubinson produced such diverse acts as Moby Grape, Herbie Hancock, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, the Pointer Sisters, Santana, The Chambers Brothers and Taj Mahal. Rubinson also founded The Automatt Recording Studios and was the music producer for the film Apocalypse Now\n\nIn 1969 Moby Grape released two more LPs: Moby Grape '69 and Truly Fine Citizen. 69 was the last LP before the group started fragmenting. Truly Fine Citizen features only Peter Lewis, Don Stevenson and Jerry Miller.\n\nCovers:\n\nThe Move covered \"Hey Grandma\" (a Miller-Stevenson composition) on their first album. It was also included in the soundtrack to the 2005 Sean Penn-Nicole Kidman film, The Interpreter, as well as being covered in 2009 by the Black Crowes, on Warpaint Live. \"8:05\" became a country rock standard covered by Robert Plant. \"Murder in My Heart for the Judge\" is a blues rock tune written by Don Stevenson that was later recorded by Lee Michaels, Three Dog Night and Chrissie Hynde.\n\nThe band did re-union gigs but were not allowed to be called Moby Grape since Katz sent out fake Moby Grape bands to do gigs. That has since been resolved. Skip Spence's son, Omar, has performed with Grape re-union gigs with the other original members.\n\nHour Two\n\n1.
