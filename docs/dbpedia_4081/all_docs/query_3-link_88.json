        "text": "Moby Grape is the most legendary classic rock band you’ve never heard of. And their self-titled debut is a missing link, a fossil capturing the fleeting moment just as “rock’n’roll” became “ROCK”.\n\nIn 1967, the biggest bands in the world were The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and the Grape. In ’68, when Jimmy Page put together a pickup band to finish out tour dates for the recently broken-up Yardbirds, a band which soon renamed itself Led Zeppelin, the first two or three songs they jammed on were singer Plant’s favorite Grape tunes. The Grape were one of the big headliners at the Monterrey Pop Festival, where a little-known guitar player named Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire for the first time.\n\nThe Grape came out of the San Francisco flower power hippie scene (their name comes from the punchline to a stoner joke: “What’s purple and lives in the ocean?”). While they have a superficial resemblance to those bands, they’re different. They’ve got the gorgeous harmony vocals, and the messages of peace and love, but underneath, strains of darkness and muscular dominance flex. Check out Don Stevenson’s hand on the unretouched cover photo, flipping the bird. Watch Skip Spence playing “Omaha” on the Mike Douglas show, throwing his guitar around, singing on mic only when the spirit moves him.\n\nRock’n’roll is fundamentally party music, but Rock aspires to art. Released the same day as “Sergeant Pepper’s”, the song structures and harmony vocals are evolving into something new, no longer derived from the vocal bands of the past, something untethered from tradition and its rigid insistence on reality. Don still initially approaches the drums like a jazz player of yesterday, with a clean, soft touch; but once the approach meets he switches to a ferocious assault, reflecting players like Elvin Jones and the emerging freedom of contemporary jazz. The amps crackle with electricity; fuzz pedals, Marshalls and other gadgets designed to distort have only been invented months before, and aren’t yet common. Instead, these are basic Fenders turned ALL THE WAY UP, like the hard hitting artists changing Country music at the time. Everyone, all five of them, are world-class vocalists and songwriters, but the vocals and songs blend like alloys melted in a crucible. I’ve been listening to this album for 15 years, and I still have a hard time telling who is singing lead. It actually doesn’t matter — this is a band, an indivisible unit, greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n“To be fully modern”, the novelist Kundera declared, “one must be the brilliant ally of one’s one gravediggers.” Moby’s debut contains the seeds of its own obsolescence; all their admiring fans like Zep and Hendrix are about to take their artistry and surpass them at their own game. “Moby Grape” was necessary for modern rock to emerge from, and then discard, like the butterfly and its cocoon.\n\nThe Grape had many other dark signs over its birth; greedy managers, bad record company deals, the latent schizophrenia of two members which drug use kindled to a roaring flame, the customary egos. Fifty years after its release, you can’t go purchase “Moby Grape”; legal garbage makes the album unavailable electronically. There’s a playlist on Youtube that cobbles together a Frankenstein version of the album. Or you could do like I did the first time, and check out a battered CD from the library. This is my ironic, greedy beauty; in this age of instant information availability, “Moby Grape” still demands you put in some effort to hear it.\n\nIt sounds like a tragedy, to fall from kings of the world to almost completely forgotten in just a few years. But go look at those live performances; they are ecstatic in the purity of the moment. This is ultimately the message of “Moby Grape” to me: just make something beautiful right now, and let it drift away like motes in a sunbeam. What could rock harder?"
