        "text": "Bob Mosley (Moby Grape) \"Bob Mosley\" 1972 US Psych Blues Rock\n\nWithin a year of Moby Grape sadly crashing to a halt again after the release of the ill-fated reunion album 20 Granite Creek, Bob Mosley (who sang, played guitar, and wrote songs with the group) released his first solo album, and if 1972’s Bob Mosley isn’t a masterpiece on the order of Moby Grape’s peerless debut album, it showed that Mosley’s share of the talent that produced that great record was still in working order. Bob Mosley is a decidedly harder-rocking album than much of the Grape catalog, with Mosley and Ed Black loading up the songs with plenty of tough guitar work, but the melodies show the same blend of grace and power that marked his best work, and Mosley’s pipes are in strong form here, with his blues-based vocals sounding potent and impassioned throughout (he also gets a great assist from the Memphis Horns, who add their punchy brass accents to several tracks). “Joker” and “Where Do the Birds Go” are fiery rockers, “Let the Music Play” is the sort of anthem Grape needed in the wake of their debut, and “Thanks” and “Gone Fishin’” are country-rock workouts that fit Mosley like a glove. Bob Mosley turned out to be Mosley’s first and last solo album (except for an unreleased 1974 set that didn’t see release until 1999), but if he fell victim to the same bad luck that haunted Moby Grape, he at least left behind a record that proved he had the talent to make it as a solo act if he’d been dealt a better hand…..by Mark Deming ….~\n\nIf you are like me and can’t get enough of the Moby Grape sound, you’ve probably tracked down all of their albums, including their rather obscure 1970s live releases and maybe even Legendary Grape from ‘89. While Live Grape and Legendary Grape have their merits, the music doesn’t give me the same feel I get when I put on '69 or WOW. Sort of disappointing.\n\nWell, this Bob Mosley solo album from '72 is what you need. Bob really taps into the San Francisco sound here and gives you the funky, hard-rocking, and introspective groves that the Grape were always good for in the '60s. “Gone Fishin’” harks back to the stoned silliness of “Murder in My Heart for the Judge,” and “Hand in Hand” could easily have been written during the WOW or '69 sessions. I suspect that some of these songs were leftovers from the good 'ole Moby Grape days. In other words, they are amazing.\n\nUnfortunately this CD is out of print, and looks like most sellers are price gouging. Still, this CD is very much worth it. Burn it in lossless format to your computer and resell on eBay…..~\n\nBorn and raised in Southern California (Paradise Valley), James Robert Mosley spent his teens playing in a number of local bands, including stints with The Frantics, The Misfits and the Strangers. By 1966 Mosley was a member of the ill-fated Moby Grape. His residency proved fairly brief. Discouraged with the band’s lack of commercial success and what he saw as Columbia Records unwillingness to adequately support the group, Mosley dropped out of the band following the release of “Moby Grape '69”.\n\nAs the story goes, Mosley was working as a school janitor and was about to be drafted when he decided to volunteer for the Marine Corps. Mosley made it through basic training, however an extended military career was not in the cards. Following a fight with an officer, nine months into his enlistment he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid-schizophrenic and discharged. Returning to California, he rejoined The Grape in time to record 1971’s “20 Granite Creek”. Unfortunately, shortly after the album was released the group again called it quits. Somehow attracting the attention of Reprise Records, Mosley secured a recording contract, going into Hollywood’s Crystal Studios with producer Michael O'Connor.\n\nRecognizing that cut out bins are full of atrocious solo efforts, we weren’t expecting all that much from 1972’s “Bob Mosley”. Our mistake !!! (Guess we should have remembered that the guy wrote some of The Grape’s best material - “Mr. Blues”, “Come In The Morning” and “Trucking Man”.) Credited with penning all eleven tracks (one co-written with brother Andy), Mosley turned in an album that was as good as anything The Grape ever recorded. Supported by a talented pick-up band including former Superfine Dandelion guitarist Ed Black and former Morning Glory drummer Allen Wehr, Mosley demonstrated an almost chameleon-like ability to handle different musical styles.\n\nThe lead off “The Joker” was a roaring slice of fuzz guitar propelled rocker, “Hands of Time” was a nice West Coast rocker, while “Thanks” offered up a pretty country-rock tune. Among the other highlights, sporting backing from the Memphis Horns, “Let the Music Play”, “Nothing to Do” and a rerecorded “Gypsy Wedding” offered up three classic slices of blue-eyed soul. Personal favorite, the wonderful “Gone Fishin’” Sadly, this lost classic vanished without a trace. ……Bad-cat……~\n\nKearny High School grad Bob Mosley came up in local garage band the Misfits, who once opened for the Rolling Stones in San Diego and recorded one single on Imperial Records and one on Troy Records, as well as playing with Misfit member Joel Scott Hill’s band.\n\nHe later became Moby Grape’s singer/bassist. Songs he wrote for the group included “Mr. Blues,” “Come in the Morning,” and “Lazy Me.”\n\nMosley hit on hard times after Moby Grape dissolved amidst years of lawsuits. “I was living in the bushes alongside a San Diego freeway in 1996,” he recalled in 2005, “when a friend picked me up and told me Judge Garcia in San Francisco had agreed to give the Moby Grape name back to the band, instead of the corporate suits.”\n\nMosley was signed to Reprise Records and released his first solo album in 1972. The next year, he cofounded the Darrow Mosley Band with Chris Darrow (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Kaleidoscope), who released one album, Desert Rain. In 1977, he played with Neil Young in the Ducks.\n\nMosley’s solo album Never Dreamed (2000) includes covers of songs by Justin Hayward, Gene Pitney, and Dolly Parton. His album True Blue was released in 2005. The partially reformed Grape occasionally performs and records today…..~\n\nMusicians\n\n*Woodie Berry - Backing Vocals\n\n*Ed Black - Guitar\n\n*Bob Mosley - Vocals, Bass\n\n*Frank Smith - Backing Vocals\n\n*Allen Wehr - Drums, Backing Vocals\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 The Joker 3:37\n\nA2 Gypsy Wedding 3:40\n\nA3 1245 Kearny 3:15\n\nA4 Squaw Valley Nils (Hocked Soul) 3:09\n\nA5 Let The Music Play 3:43\n\nA6 Thanks\n\nGuitar [Pedal Steel] – Ed Black\n\n3:00\n\nB1 Where Do The Birds Go 3:30\n\nB2 Hand In Hand 3:00\n\nB3 Gone Fishin’ 2:45\n\nB4 Nothing To Do 2:20\n\nB5 So Many Troubles 4:03"
