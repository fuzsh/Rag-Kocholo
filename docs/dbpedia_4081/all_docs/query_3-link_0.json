        "text": "1967 studio album by Moby Grape\n\nMoby GrapeStudio album by ReleasedJune 6, 1967[1]RecordedMarch 11 – April 25, 1967StudioCBS, HollywoodGenreLength30:47LabelColumbiaProducerDavid RubinsonMoby Grape chronology\n\nMoby Grape\n\n(1967) Wow/Grape Jam\n\n(1968)\n\nSingles from Moby Grape\n\nReleased: June 6, 1967\n\nReleased: June 6, 1967\n\nReleased: June 6, 1967\n\nReleased: June 6, 1967\n\nReleased: June 6, 1967\n\nMoby Grape is the 1967 debut album by rock band Moby Grape. Coming from the San Francisco scene, their reputation quickly grew to immense proportions, leading to a bidding war and a contract with Columbia Records. The album peaked at #24 on the Billboard 200 albums chart in September 1967.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction began on Moby Grape in Los Angeles in March 1967.[5] Produced by David Rubinson, the thirteen tracks were recorded over six weeks, from March 11 to April 25, at a cost of $11,000.[6] Another song \"Rounder\" was also recorded, but no lyrics or vocals were completed for it at the time.[5]\n\nCover\n\n[edit]\n\nThe cover photograph is by rock photographer Jim Marshall. On the original release, Don Stevenson is shown \"flipping the bird\" (making an obscene gesture) on the washboard. It was airbrushed out on subsequent pressings, but the UK reissue on Edsel/Demon restored it.\n\nThe flag behind Skip Spence is actually a United States flag that Columbia Records decided to obscure through airbrushing, presumably due to the political climate of the times. On the original release, the flag is colored red. When the cover was revised to remove the offending finger mentioned above, the flag was changed from red to black, again presumably due to possible political interpretations (the association of the color red with communism). The Edsel vinyl (1984) and CD (1989) re-issues restored the photo to its original state, with Don Stevenson's displayed finger and an un-airbrushed United States flag. Other CD re-issues use the cover from the first pressing, with the finger intact and the flag tinted red.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[7]Rolling Stone[8]The Village VoiceA−[4]Encyclopedia of Popular Music[9]\n\nReleased by Columbia on June 6, 1967,[10] simultaneously with ten of the thirteen songs on five singles: \"Fall on You\"/\"Changes\", \"Sitting By the Window\"/\"Indifference\" (2:46 edit), \"8:05\"/\"Mister Blues\", \"Omaha\"/\"Someday\" and \"Hey Grandma\"/Come in the Morning\".[11] Of these five, only \"Omaha\" and \"Hey Grandma\" charted. All five records were issued with picture sleeves showing the same album cover photo.\n\nNevertheless, as Gene Sculatti and Davin Seay write in their book San Francisco Nights, Moby Grape \"remains one of the very few psychedelic masterpieces ever recorded.\"[12] The original Billboard review noted the unusual promotion campaign behind the group before simply stating \"it has what it takes.\"[13] Justin Farrar considered that \"(i)t's no understatement to hail the group's 1967 debut as the ancestral link between psychedelia, country rock, glam, power pop and punk.\"[14] In addition, the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide said their \"debut LP is as fresh and exhilarating today as it was when it exploded out of San Francisco during 1967's summer of love.\" In 2003, the album was ranked number 121 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 124 in a 2012 revised listing.[3] It was also voted number 98 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).\n\nThe album was included in Robert Christgau's \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981).[15] As reviewed by Mark Deming in AllMusic, \"Moby Grape is as refreshing today as it was upon first release, and if fate prevented the group from making a follow-up that was as consistently strong, for one brief shining moment Moby Grape proved to the world they were one of America's great bands. While history remembers the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane as being more important, the truth is neither group ever made an album quite this good.\"[7]\n\nIn 2008, Skip Spence's song \"Omaha\" was listed as number 95 in Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\".[16] The song was described there as follows: \"On their best single, Jerry Miller, Peter Lewis and Skip Spence compete in a three-way guitar battle for two and a quarter red-hot minutes, each of them charging at Spence's song from different angles, no one yielding to anyone else.\"[16] Writing in 1967,[17] shortly after the album's release, Crawdaddy! creator Paul Williams described \"Omaha\" as \"the toughest cut on the album (and) one of the finest recorded examples of the wall-of-sound approach in rock. It surges and roars like a tidal wave restrained by a seawall.\"[18]\n\n2007 Sundazed reissue\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 9, 2007, Sundazed Records released a remastered CD version of the album's stereo mix containing bonus tracks, some of which were previously unreleased. In addition, Sundazed also released the album's mono mix on LP, but with no bonus tracks. Both the CD and LP versions were taken out of print, along with Wow and Grape Jam, on November 3, 2007, for reasons not officially stated. It has been widely circulated among the Moby Grape mailing list that former manager Matthew Katz, with whom the band has been in legal battles since the late 1960s, threatened to file a lawsuit against Sundazed claiming ownership of the album artwork.\n\nNotable covers and soundtrack inclusions\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert Plant covered \"8:05\" and \"Naked If I Want To\" as B-sides to 1993 singles; \"8:05\" is also included on the expanded reissue of his Fate of Nations album on Rhino Records. Robert Plant also performed \"Hey Grandma\" live when with his pre-Led Zeppelin Band of Joy, during the 1967-1968 period.[19] The Move covered \"Hey Grandma\" on their self-titled first album, released in 1968. More recently, \"Hey Grandma\" was included in the soundtrack to the 2005 Sean Penn-Nicole Kidman film, The Interpreter, as well as being covered in 2009 by the Black Crowes, on Warpaint Live.\n\nCat Power has recorded two covers of \"Naked, If I Want To\" which appeared on her 2000 album The Covers Record and on the limited edition of her 2008 album Jukebox.\n\n\"Omaha\" has been covered by The Golden Palominos in 1985 on their Visions of Excess album, with Michael Stipe on lead vocal. The song has also occasionally been performed live in concert by Bruce Springsteen.\n\n\"Ain't No Use\" has been covered by bluegrass band Long Road Home.\n\n\"8:05\" appears on Christy McWilson's 2002 album Bed of Roses, as a duet with Dave Alvin, and on the 2013 album Have Harmony, Will Travel as a duet by Peter Case and Carla Olson.\n\nBritish band Diesel Park West have covered many Moby Grape songs both on record and live. From this album, they covered \"Lazy Me\" on their outtakes album Flipped from 1990. They have covered \"Fall On You\" live and based the opening track, \"Charlotte, It’s All Over\" from their latest album Do Come In, Excuse The Mess around the guitar riff.\n\nIn 2015, band member Peter Lewis's daughter Arwen recorded a track-by-track cover of the album. It released October 2, 2015.[20]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nMoby Grape\n\nPeter Lewis – rhythm guitar, vocals\n\nJerry Miller – lead guitar, vocals\n\nBob Mosley – bass, vocals\n\nSkip Spence – rhythm guitar, vocals\n\nDon Stevenson – drums, vocals\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbum - Billboard\n\nYear Chart Position 1967 Pop Albums 24\n\nSingles - Billboard\n\nYear Single Chart Position 1967 \"Omaha\" Pop Singles 88 1967 \"Hey Grandma\" Pop Singles 127\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
