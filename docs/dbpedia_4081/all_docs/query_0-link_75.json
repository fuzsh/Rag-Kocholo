        "text": "The Beach Boys\n\nThe Beach Boys Today! (1965)\n\nFirst FL-S-1193\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Capitol album that replaces the brown background with yellow. Again.\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nBeach Boys’ Party! (1965)\n\nLiming LM-2026\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Capitol album that replaces the orange background with pink. Reducing the original color photos to blue and pink was an interesting decision; surrounding them with a pink background was not.\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nPet Sounds (1966)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-293\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nPet Sounds (1966)\n\nFirst FL-1362\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nBoth of these albums are decent reproductions of the original Capitol album but with some alterations. The Chung Sheng album has a white field at the top instead of green, and the original large yellow song titles have been replaced with teeny-weeny red ones. Still, it’s a nice-looking cover.\n\nThe First album has a red field at the top instead of green and the album title is centered instead of flush left. The song titles have been eliminated completely. I like this cover for its boldness and may prefer it to the original. (I know—I blaspheme, but that’s life.) I especially like the deft touch of adding a dash of red to the bits of food that Carl and Brian are offering the goats.\n\nThe photo that the Beach Boys or Capitol selected for PET SOUNDS is charming but it was probably not the best image to put across the “genius” of Brian’s “new” music. Still, it was a huge step forward from striped Pendleton shirts that they wore for the Sloop John B picture sleeve a few months earlier.\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nBest of the Beach Boys (1966)\n\nSun Shine SS-160\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Capitol album but the original cover has the song titles in red, blue, and black print. This Sun Shine cover has red and black titles and adds a blue border around all four sides. This is actually a more effective design.\n\nThe photos on the cover don’t acknowledge the sixth Beach Boy, Bruce Johnson. By the time this album was released, he was a permanent member, performing at all the group’s concerts and singing background on their records.\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nSmiley Smile (1967)\n\nSong Jwu SAL-7041\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThis is a decent reproduction of the original Brother album but with some alterations. On the original, the vegetation is several tones of green and brown with shading. The title and artist credit are green.\n\nThe Song Jwu cover changes all the vegetation to shades of green and changes the title and artist credit to a bright red.\n\nThis is nowhere near as lovely as the original but it is stronger graphically and would probably attract more attention from casual browsers in a record store.\n\nThis music was received as rather “unhip” in 1967, and this cover art didn’t help. The album was used as evidence that “Brian is a genius” was not an astute observation by Jules Siegel and Paul Williams, but merely a clever ploy to make the group look hip to the emerging hip counterculture. Fortunately, time and succeeding generations have been very kind to SMILEY SMILE, a truly beautiful (if truly weird) album.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nWith the Beatles (1963)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-274 [a]\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Beatles\n\nWith the Beatles (1963)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-274 [b]\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThese albums feature a different image than the original Parlophone album, using a photo from another source. On the image on top [a], the Beatles’ bodies are flat but their heads have tone and shading and jump out of the background. The effect is merely cheesy.\n\nOn the image on the bottom [b], the bodies and background have been even more flattened. But the way the shaded heads pop out of the simple, bold colors is both ridiculous and striking. This was a common effect on Taiwanese covers and below I refer to them as “pop-out heads.”\n\nAlso, the first nine song titles are typeset but the bottom four are hand-lettered.\n\nThe letterer ran out of room for the final title, “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me”—instead of breaking it up into two lines and indenting the second line, he curved the last three words up over Ringo’s shoulder!\n\nThe Beatles\n\nMeet the Beatles (1963)\n\nHae Shan HS-238\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Beatles\n\nMeet the Beatles (1963)\n\nHaishan HS-251\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Hae Shan album is a reproduction of the original Parlophone album. Here Hae Shan cropped the Beatles’ heads out of the famous blue-black backdrop of the original cover and pasted them onto a white or neutral field and added a few Chinese characters. All in all, it’s an effective cover design.\n\nThe Haishan album features a different image than the original Capitol album. It is a painting of another photo and looks like “fan art” that might have appeared in a quality fanzine.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nA Hard Day’s Night (1964)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-34\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis album features a different image than the original Parlophone album. It uses a photo from another source. This is so shoddy that even the red-on-pink color scheme can’t save it.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nBeatles for Sale (1964)\n\nFirst FL-1157\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Beatles\n\nBeatles for Sale (1964)\n\nHae Shan HS-281\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe First album is a reproduction of the original Parlophone album with the background whited out. Robert Freeman’s original photograph is so stunning that even an incompetent designer can come away with a striking image.\n\nThe Hae Shan album is a reproduction of the original Parlophone album but with the Beatles cropped out of the photo and set into a not particularly attractive green field. This one looks like a high-quality bootleg from the early 1970s when there were no high-quality bootleg manufacturers.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nHelp! (1965)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-105\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Beatles\n\nHelp! (1965)\n\nFirst FL-S 1198\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThese albums feature a different image than the original Parlophone album. They are reproductions of the original Capitol picture sleeve for the Help! single. The monochromatic blue of the Chung Sheng cover is kinda nice looking while the First album has a modest pop-out head effect.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nRubber Soul (1965) Chung Sheng CSJ-152\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Beatles\n\nRubber Soul (1965)\n\nFirst FL-1255 [a]\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Beatles\n\nRubber Soul (1965)\n\nFirst FL-1255 [b]\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThese are all reproductions of the original Parlophone album, which was one of the outstanding covers of the ’60s. Each looks like a photocopy many generations removed from the original.\n\nThe second First album [b] is considerably sharper but still gives the Fab Four a sorta ghostly quality, which is attractive.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nRevolver (1966)\n\nFirst FL-1337\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Beatles\n\nRevolver (1966)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-384\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe First album is a reasonably accurate reproduction of the original Parlophone album but with “Revolver The Beatles” dropped onto Paul’s face. This gives the pristine look of the original a slightly tacky look. The Chinese characters don’t detract all that much.\n\nThe Chung Sheng album features a different image than the original Parlophone album. It does away with the cover art and prints the lyrics to some of the songs instead.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nSgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)\n\nBlack Cat BC-4113\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis album features a different image than the original Parlophone album. It is a reproduction of the interior photo on the gatefold jacket. The album title has two typos: “Peppep’s” and “Loney.”\n\nThe Beatles\n\nThe Golden Hits by Beatls 67′ (1967)\n\nLarge World LW-299\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nMost readers will immediately note the misspelling of the band’s name in the title. Fewer will catch the fact that the apostrophe in the contracted year is in the wrong place. It should be “Beatles ‘67” instead of “Beatls 67′.” (Actually, the title should be “The Golden Hits of the Beatles 1967.”)\n\nFewer still will get far enough to discover that this is not a compilation of hits from 1967 but is, in fact, the complete SGT. PEPPER’S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND album!\n\nThe Beatles\n\nThe Beatles (1968)\n\nLiming LM-2237\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Beatles\n\nThe Beatles (1968)\n\nLiming LM-2238\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nLiming 2237 contains sides 1 and 2 of the two-record set THE BEATLES from 1968 (also known as The White Album). Liming 2238 contains sides 3 and 4.\n\nInstead of the plain white jacket of The Beatles, these albums use the four bonus photos that were included with the original two-record album.\n\nThe front cover of 2238 credits “The Beatles,” the back cover credits “The Beales,” and the record labels credits “The Bealfs.”\n\nThe Byrds\n\nMr. Tambourine Man (1965)\n\nCathay CA-1029\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Byrds\n\nMr. Tambourine Man (1965)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-244 [a]\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Byrds\n\nMr. Tambourine Man (1965)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-244 [b]\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThese are all reproductions of the original Columbia album. The Cathay album has a dark blue backdrop and combined with the Chinese characters it is rather eye-catching. The Chung Sheng album [a] is a reproduction of the original Columbia album but with the black backdrop replaced with aquamarine. It also adds a yellow tint to the artist’s credit and the photo that enhances the cover somewhat.\n\nThe Chung Sheng album on the bottom [b] is an even shoddier album and may be a reproduction of the first one but with a pink tint to the artist’s credit and the photo that is less effective. This album looks like a kissin’ cousin to the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s ARE YOU EXPERIENCED on World Record below.\n\nI bought the MR. TAMBOURINE MAN album as soon as it came out in 1965. I was 13 years old and had never seen an album cover that looked anything like it. The fish-eye lens photo cropped into a circle set against a black backdrop looked like the Byrds were peering from California through a hole in the universe into my room in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Byrds\n\nTurn! Turn! Turn! (1965)\n\nLarge World LW-113\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Byrds\n\nTurn! Turn! Turn! (1965)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-245\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Large World album is a reproduction of the original Columbia album but with the beautiful blue backdrop replaced with an ugly green.\n\nThe Chung Sheng album is a reproduction of the original CBS from Japan but turning the beautiful full-color cover of the original to a garish red tone.\n\nThe Byrds\n\nYounger than Yesterday (1967)\n\nSun Shine SS-120\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Columbia album. If I had to choose a Favorite Album Cover of All Time, it would be the cover of the original stereo release of YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY. But all the subtlety and beauty of the original is lost on this Sun Shine album.\n\nThe pointillist effect of the original cover art (click on the link on the title above) was lost in the multiple generations of photocopies used for this cover. The glorious color photo was reduced to black and white with pink, green, and blue tones added. This makes the four Byrds look like creatures from a bad horror movie!\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nI Walk the Line (1964)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-49\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Columbia album but the results are so bizarre I am uncertain as to whether Johnny’s face is a distorted photo or just some ugly artwork! Either way, it makes Johnny look like he was auditioning for Eraserhead.\n\nPetula Clark\n\nChante en Anglais (1966)\n\nBlack Cat BC-4064\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Vogue album but with the background replaced with a pink field. There is also a pop-out effect on Pet’s head. (I also remember when girls drank sodas out of bottles with two straws. I don’t know why, but I found it sexy. Sigh . . .)\n\nCream\n\nWheels of Fire (1968)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-815\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nCream\n\nWheels of Fire (1968)\n\nFirst FLS-1629/1620\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Chung Sheng album is a reproduction of the original Atco album but with a yellow border. The original Atco album featured one of the first outrageous album covers with black line drawings by Martin Sharp. The art was covered with a faux silver foil finish that made the gatefold jacket shine.\n\nThe clothes that Baker, Bruce, and Clapton wore and the instruments they played during their mind-altering tour of the US in 1968 were designed and painted by Simon Posthuma and Marijke Koger They were the leaders of a Dutch art collective known as The Fool. While Cream was colorfully psychedelic in person, little on this album topped DISRAELI GEARS for psychedelicness.\n\nThe First album eliminated the original cover art and replaced it with graphics that look like they were done by an 8-year-old. This may be the cheesiest cover on this page! I awarded it a 2 instead of 3 for sheer chutzpah.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival (1968)\n\nTai Shen KT-3070\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Fantasy album but with a pop-out effect on the entire figure of the four band members. The original cover design was kind of cheesy: a nice color photo of CCR hanging out in the woods was bordered on three signs by what looks like the type of filigree art associated with 19th-century books.\n\nDonovan\n\nSunshine Superman (1966)\n\nLiming LM-2177\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThese are both reproductions of the original Epic album with interesting alterations in the colors. While the Epic cover is attractive, it’s also kinda laid back. I think the Liming color scheme is a more effective and eye-catching scheme than the Epic cover.\n\nThe Doors\n\nThe Doors (1967)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-611\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Doors\n\nThe Doors (1967)\n\nWorld Record SLW-1642\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThese are both reproductions of the original Elektra album. The Chung Sheng album adds a white border to the photo (and red to Morrison’s lips), more or less ruining a great cover. The World album also adds an unnecessary border but I like the pink-orange tone.\n\nThe Doors\n\nStrange Days (1967)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-655\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis album features a different image than the original Elektra album. The original album has a photo of a group of circus people, including the gentleman above in the photo above. It hinted at the carnival of sounds and effects on the record within.\n\nThe Chung Sheng album uses the photo on the back cover of the Elektra album, adding a blue border. This ruins the whole effect of the marvelous original cover. The back cover of the Chung Sheng album features the lyrics to the songs.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nBringing It All Back Home (1965)\n\nSun Shine SS-176\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Columbia album that blurs many of the details that made the cover so interesting to Dylanaddicts for years. Many of them believed that Dylan selected and arranged the items in this Daniel Kramer photograph as clues to the puzzle that Dylan was becoming in early 1965.\n\nMarianne Faithfull\n\nMarianne Faithfull (1965)\n\nFirst FL-1302\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Decca album with the addition of the horizontal bar or stripe on the left, which looks like a Japanese obi. Miss Faithfull was one of the legendary beauties of Swinging London in the ’60s. She was the one who got Mick Jagger and kept him for several years. Unfortunately, few of the photographs on her records capture that beauty, this one being no exception.\n\nThe Four Seasons\n\nSherry (1962)\n\nFirst FL-1070\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Vee-Jay album that replaces the black background with a dull blue. Stereo copies of most Vee-Jay albums from the early ’60s are rather rare records. It’s rather interesting that First Record got hold of a stereo copy in Taiwan to use as the source for this cover.\n\nConnie Francis\n\nNever on Sunday (1961)\n\nHaishan HS-4\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nConnie Francis\n\nNever on Sunday (1961)\n\nHaishan HS-4\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThese albums feature a different image than the original MGM album. These two pressings of Haishan 4 feature photos from another source. The design isn’t half bad.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience\n\nAre You Experienced (1967)\n\nWorld Record SLW-1652\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Reprise album that replaces the green background with a dull blue. The original full-color, psychedelic photo by Karl Ferris has been replaced with a black & white photocopy. This album looks like a kissin’ cousin to the Byrds’ MR. TAMBOURINE MAN album on Chung Sheng above.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience\n\nAxis: Bold as Love (1967)\n\nFirst FL-1610\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Reprise album with the subtle shaded pink and orange rays in the background turned into garish red and yellow beams. While the original is more attractive, the boldness of this design makes the First album more of an attention-getter.\n\nHerman’s Hermits\n\nIntroducing Herman’s Hermits (1964)\n\nFirst FL-1242\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThis album features a different image than the original MGM album. This design is similar to the original HERMAN’S HERMITS EP album from Spain (Odeon 7EPL-14.185), but replaces the original photo with a painting of the photo! It looks like fan art that might have appeared in a quality fanzine.\n\nThe Hollyridge Strings\n\nThe Beatles Song Book (1964)\n\nFirst FL-1268\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis album features a different image than the original Capitol album, using a photo from another source. It bears no resemblance to the original album, which does not have any image, just text against a blue background.\n\nIan & Sylvia\n\nEarly Mornin’ Rain (1965)\n\nHaishan HS-528\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Vanguard album with the colors washed out. Haishan took the original full-color photo and reduced it to black and white, they then added blue and red tones to everything but the faces. Interesting effect.\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nSurrealistic Pillow (1967)\n\nLarge World LW-335\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThis is the same design as the original RCA Victor album but replaces the original photo with an amateurish painting of the photo. It looks like fan art that might have appeared in a quality fanzine.\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nAfter Bathing at Baxter’s (1967)\n\nLarge World LW-349\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original RCA Victor album without the big white stars in the blue banner at the top. The original design and art were done by Ron Cobb, the king of the underground press cartoonists at the time.\n\nAFTER BATHING AT BAXTER’S is one of my favorite album covers, so I even like this cheesy repro (even if it ruins the intricate coloring of the airplane by making everything green).\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nCrown of Creation (1968)\n\nFirst FL-1639\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThis album features a different image than the original RCA Victor album. First Record took the multi-exposure photo of the group from the back cover of the original album and superimposed it over an atomic fireball.\n\nThis is a more striking design than the original album! This is one of the few instances where a Taiwanese design team showed real creativity and beat the original graphics people at their own game.\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\nLed Zeppelin (1968)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-846\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\nLed Zeppelin (1968)\n\nUnion TD-1721\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThese are both reproductions of the original Atlantic album. On the Chung Sheng cover, the original white background has been filled with a muddy sepia color.\n\nThe Union album uses a negative image of the original cover to great effect. I prefer it to the original.\n\nThe Lovin’ Spoonful\n\nDo You Believe in Magic? (1965)\n\nLeico PLS-3087\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Kama Sutra album but replaces the black background with an ugly blue.\n\nLulu\n\nTo Sir, with Love (1967)\n\nFirst FL-1523\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nLulu\n\nTo Sir, with Love (1967)\n\nLiming LM-2204\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nBoth of these albums are packaged as the soundtrack to the movie To Sir, With Love. Both contain the same track content as Lulu’s solo album LULU SINGS TO SIR, WITH LOVE. At least, that’s the title of the US release; in the UK, it was saddled with the sales-killing LOVE LETTERS TO LULU.\n\nThe cover for the Liming album is a collage that was lifted from a movie poster. The cover to the First album is a collage of images from the movie and, while amateurish, is more effective than the staid photo of Mr. Thackeray (Sidney Poitier) at his desk in school gracing the cover of the actual soundtrack album.\n\nThe Mamas & The Papas\n\nIf You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears (1966)\n\nTai Shen KT-3023\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis album crops a portion of the photo on the original Dunhill album and sets it against a blue background. While it ruins the charm of the original cover, it’s hard to be angry with a design with a big green “Mama’s & Papa’s” on it (even if there are apostrophes incorrectly added to each noun).\n\nThe Mamas & The Papas\n\nJohn – Michelle – Cass – Dennie (1967)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-445\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis album features a different image than the original Dunhill album using a photo from another source.\n\nMoby Grape\n\nMoby Grape (1967)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-599\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Columbia album that replaces the black border with yellow. It’s the original, untouched cover with Don Stevenson’s finger still attached to his hand.\n\nThe Monkees\n\nThe Monkees (1966)\n\nLarge World LW-230\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis a reproduction of the original Colgems album. The original photo is full color but here it’s reduced to black and white with a red tone. But my-o-my look at those teeth! This highlighting of the teeth occurs on many Taiwan albums, only a few of which are on this page.\n\nThe Monkees\n\nMore of the Monkees (1966)\n\nFirst FL-1427\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Monkees\n\nMore of the Monkees (1966)\n\nLiming LM-2157\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nBoth of these albums are reproductions of the original Colgems album but with the group’s faces enhanced so that they have that absurd pop-out head effect.\n\nThe Monkees\n\nPisces Aquarius Capricorn & Jones Ltd. (1967)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-663\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThis album features a different image than the original Colgems album. It is one of the more adventurous efforts by a Taiwanese record company’s art department. It’s also one of the more interesting covers on any Monkees record anywhere!\n\nPeter, Paul & Mary\n\nSee What Tomorrow Brings (1965)\n\nLiming LM-2027\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Warner Brothers album but is just plain ugly, removing all the charm of the original photo.\n\nPeter, Paul & Mary\n\nLate Again (1968)\n\nLiming LM-2247\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis album features a different image than the original Warner Brothers album, using a photo from another source. It looks homemade. As cheesy as it is, I kinda like it.\n\nGene Pitney\n\nGolden Greats (1967)\n\nSong Jwu SAL-7039\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThis is a decent reproduction of the original Musicor album with the original solid black background replaced with bright red and all those stripes. This is a more effective design for attracting the eye of a record buyer.\n\nElvis Presley\n\nElvis’ Golden Records Volume 3 (1963)\n\nFirst FL-S-1209\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original RCA Victor album that replaces the blue background with gold. Like most of the photos used on Elvis’s albums and pictures sleeves in the ’60s, this presents the singer so blandly as to be devoid of spark and pizzazz.\n\nElvis Presley\n\nParadise, Hawaiian Style (1966)\n\nFirst FL-1373\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original RCA Victor album but First Record cropped the photo of Elvis and surrounded it with a blue border. It’s tacky as all get-out but the blue adds a touch of drama to the blasé original.\n\nPaul Revere & The Raiders\n\nMidnight Ride (1966)\n\nTongsheng MXL-1082\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Columbia album but Tongsheng cropped the group photo and surrounded it with a gold border added to the photo. The border makes the album look like the quadraphonic albums that Columbia released in 1973-1975.\n\nPaul Revere & The Raiders\n\nRevolution (1967)\n\nWorld SLW-1648\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Columbia album with a banner added to the top and a nice pop-out head effect on the group.\n\nCliff Richard & The Shadows\n\nFinders Keepers (1966)\n\nLiming LM-2137\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Columbia album in which the dismal photocopy makes the boys look like some form of British undead. With this cover, it’s hard to believe this is the soundtrack album for a movie that boasts, “The beat is the wildest, the blast is the craziest, and the fun is where you find it!”\n\nThe Righteous Brothers\n\nSoul and Inspiration (1966)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-363\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nRighteous Brothers\n\nSoul and Inspiration (1966)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-363\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThese albums feature a different image than the original Verve album. They use a reproduction of the original Moonglow album THE BEST OF THE RIGHTEOUS BROTHERS. But they are so poorly reproduced that Bobby Hatfield looks like he was used as a sparring partner (sans headgear) in a workout with Mike Tyson (sans gloves).\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nAftermath (1966)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-435\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nAftermath (1966)\n\nFirst FL-1305\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nIn 1968, Mick and Keith decided they wanted to outrage us all with tasteless cover art for the brilliant BEGGARS BANQUET album, which Decca had the good sense to quash. Most of the sleeve art that followed was tacky at best. But from 1964 through 1967, Rolling Stones picture sleeves and album covers were among the most beautiful of the ’60s.\n\nAFTERMATH had two covers: the one the group selected appeared on the Decca album in the UK and most of the rest of the world. Then there was another cover that appeared on the London album, apparently selected for the American market. Both are fine but I prefer the London album cover.\n\nFortunately, the Taiwanese companies chose to ape the London album. Chung Sheng added a yucky green banner to the top so that the album looks like a bootleg. First reduced the color photo to black and white and added a red tint, making an effective and attractive alternative to the original.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nBig Hits (High Tide & Green Grass) (1966)\n\nBlack Cat BC-4110\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Decca album—which was another beautiful Stones cover—with the background reduced to black and white. The images of the five Stones are in washed-out colors with a pop-out head effect.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nFlowers (1967)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-610\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nThis album features a different image than the original London album, using a photo from another source. While it’s nothing like the original cover—of which I am rather fond—it’s not bad-looking.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nTheir Satanic Majesties Request (1967)\n\nLarge World LW-351\n\nCheese Factor: 1\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Decca album with the group’s name and the album title added. Original copies of the album had a plastic, lenticular window glued over the photo. This gave the photo a 3-D effect where the parts of the photos appeared to move when the jacket itself was moved.\n\nDue to the clarity of the photo here, I assume that Large World used an album cover that had did not have the lenticular window.\n\nThe Shadows\n\nOut of the Shadows (1962)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-81\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original EMI album. The original cover is full color and has the four band members posing in a black environment while being lit from their right.\n\n(Has anyone ever suggested that the striking chiaroscuro effect on the cover of the original OUT OF THE SHADOWS album may have been the inspiration for Robert Freeman’s iconic photo for the With the Beatles album? There the four band members are posing in a black environment while being lit from their right with a striking chiaroscuro effect.)\n\nSimon & Garfunkel\n\nParsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme (1967)\n\nFirst FL-1428\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nSimon & Garfunkel\n\nParsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme (1967)\n\nLarge World LW-331\n\nCheese Factor: 2\n\nBoth of these albums are reproductions of the original Columbia album with the black background replaced with blue. The person who cropped the foreground photo from the black did a poor job on poor Paul’s head. It’s so poor that it gives the new image a Dada-like look. This may be my favorite pop-out head effect in this article!\n\nNancy Sinatra\n\nBoots (1966)\n\nFirst FL-1343\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThis is a reproduction of the original Reprise album, which is one of the most distinctive album covers of the ’60s. The reproduction of the photo of Nancy crops the point off the end of the boot on her right foot, making it look like her toes have been amputated!\n\nThe Supremes\n\nThe Supremes at the Copa (1965)\n\nChung Sheng CSJ-197\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nThe Supremes\n\nThe Supremes at the Copa (1965)\n\nHaishan HS-405\n\nCheese Factor: 3\n\nBoth of these albums are reproductions of the original Motown album. The Chung Sheng album cropped the foreground photo (the audience, the Supremes, and the musicians) out of the original cover and replaced the dark drapes with a plain pink screen."
