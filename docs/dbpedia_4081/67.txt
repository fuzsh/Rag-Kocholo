Moby Grape is an American rock group from the 1960s, known for having all five members contribute to singing and songwriting and that collectively merged elements of folk music, blues, country, and jazz, together with rock and psychedelic music. The group continues to perform occasionally......

....All band members wrote songs and sang lead and backup vocals for their debut album Moby Grape (1967). Mosley, Lewis, and Spence generally wrote alone, while Miller and Stevenson generally wrote together. In 2003, Moby Grape was ranked as number 121 in Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". Noted rock critic Robert Christgau listed it as one of The 40 "Essential Albums of 1967". In 2008, Skip Spence's song "Omaha", from the first Moby Grape album, was listed as number 95 in Rolling Stone's "100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time".....In a marketing stunt, Columbia Records immediately released five singles at once, and the band was perceived as being over-hyped....Nonetheless, the record was critically acclaimed and fairly successful commercially,....(Read more at Wikipedia)

Moby Grape were one of the bands who emerged from San Francisco's hippy scene in 1967, performing at the local rock "ballrooms", issuing a debut album that summer and becoming more widely known by performing at the Monterey Pop Festival (although their performance wasn't included in the film of the event). In contrast to some of the albums Peel played on his Perfumed Garden as imports, CBS Records were quick to release the LP in the UK, along with the single "Omaha/Hey Grandma". It was John Peel's Climber in the Radio London playlist for the week beginning 30 July 1967 [1] and entered the station's Fab Forty chart in the following week, just before "Big L" closed down. The single never made the UK national charts, but the Move covered "Hey Grandma" on their first LP and on their first Top Gear session. It remained Moby Grape's best-known record and Peel revisited it much later in his career.

Subsequent Moby Grape albums made less impact than their debut, but the band's releases of the late 1960s were featured on Peel's shows, and they were one of the few US groups to do a Top Gear session, during a visit to the UK in early 1969. It was broadcast on 16 February 1969, although Peel complained that the band didn't seem particularly interested in recording it.

The first Moby Grape album was one of Joe Boyd's choices for his Record Box [2], selected from Peel's record collection.
