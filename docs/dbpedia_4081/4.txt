Moby Grape were formed in San Francisco at the end of 1966. The original line-up of the group was Peter Lewis, Jerry Miller, Bob Mosley, Skip Spence and Don Stevenson. They signed with Columbia and released five singles simultaneously in the middle of 1967 followed by their first LP. A second LP followed in 1968.Spence left the group in 1968 and the remaining four members continued to perform and recorded another album. Mosley left the group in 1969. The remaining trio recorded the Truly Fine Citizen album which was released in late 1969. The group then split up. The five original members reunited in 1971 to record an album and perform a few shows before splitting up again. Subsequently the group has occasionally reformed for short periods in various formats and often using different group names.
