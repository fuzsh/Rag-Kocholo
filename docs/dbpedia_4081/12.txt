Kearny High School grad Bob Mosley came up in local garage band the Misfits, who once opened for the Rolling Stones in San Diego and recorded one single on Imperial Records and one on Troy Records, as well as playing with Misfit member Joel Scott Hill's band.

He later became Moby Grape's singer/bassist. Songs he wrote for the group included "Mr. Blues," "Come in the Morning," and "Lazy Me."

Mosley hit on hard times after Moby Grape dissolved amidst years of lawsuits. “I was living in the bushes alongside a San Diego freeway in 1996,” he recalled in 2005, “when a friend picked me up and told me Judge Garcia in San Francisco had agreed to give the Moby Grape name back to the band, instead of the corporate suits.”

Mosley was signed to Reprise Records and released his first solo album in 1972. The next year, he cofounded the Darrow Mosley Band with Chris Darrow (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Kaleidoscope), who released one album, Desert Rain. In 1977, he played with Neil Young in the Ducks.

Mosley's solo album Never Dreamed (2000) includes covers of songs by Justin Hayward, Gene Pitney, and Dolly Parton. His album True Blue was released in 2005. The partially reformed Grape occasionally performs and records today.
