        "text": "Gloria Gaynor became synonymous with an anthem of independence, sass, guts, and faith, but it wasn’t until her sixties that she learned what it really meant to survive—and thrive.\n\nThis and other heartfelt revelations shimmer through Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive, an affectionate and engrossing documentary filled with confessional interviews, historical videos, and intimate footage of disco’s onetime queen recording her first gospel album.\n\nGaynor, 79, won her first Grammy in 1980 for the song I Will Survive, which the US Library of Congress has inducted into the National Recording Registry as culturally significant. Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive is part biography, part underdog story, recounting Gaynor’s life while following her through several years of recording Testimony, the roots gospel album that earned her a second Grammy in 2020.\n\n“She’s the poster child of people getting through,” says Bart Millard of MercyMe, one of Gaynor’s collaborators.\n\nLongtime producer Betsy Schechter makes her feature directing debut with this film, which premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It opens around 2015, when Gaynor and her manager, Stephanie Gold, connect with Tennessee music producer Chris Stevens.\n\nNo one had been interested in a gospel album from Gaynor, thinking of her as a disco or pop act. However, Stevens had a disco band in his youth and recognized that a lot of musicians still love her. “That’s why we’re here—to help her get her art out,” he says.\n\nSchechter and editors David Zieff and Kieran Healy deftly blend photos, archive footage, and interviews, recapping Gaynor’s youth in Newark, New Jersey; her early touring days; her breakout hit, Never Can Say Goodbye; and her subsequent success.\n\nGaynor’s father abandoned her family shortly before Gaynor was born. She recalls how that rejection and subsequent sexual abuse left her feeling unworthy of love, to the point she’d sing I Will Survive onstage but not believe it.\n\nShe and her former husband and manager, Linwood Simon, were together for more than two decades before his partying and her constant European touring, which he arranged, soured the union. Gaynor notes how she feared being alone, then realized she already was, a eureka moment that led her to file for divorce.\n\nThe film also touches on Gaynor losing a sister to violence, attending college in her sixties, and dealing with a debilitating back injury. After years of pain and uncomfortable posture, the singer underwent corrective spinal surgery in her seventies.\n\nWhile the biographical material moves along at a swift pace, enhanced by Gaynor’s frankness and warmth, the best parts of Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive take place in the studio, where she shows off her still-impressive vocals. Backup singers, musicians, and guests such as Millard geek out over meeting her, and closeups, medium shots, and wide shots convey the energy of these creative people jamming together and inspiring each other.\n\n“It’s like going to church, isn’t it?” someone remarks after one spirited session. Amen to that.\n\nCompassionate and honest, Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive is an uplifting look at a woman not content to rest on her laurels while feeling grateful for how much she’s survived. (She’s working on another album for her 80th birthday, the film notes.)\n\nHonored by those who find solace in her signature hit, Gaynor says she considers that song a gift.\n\n“I feel it’s a great responsibility, and I am—dare I say—flattered that God would entrust me with this,” she says."
