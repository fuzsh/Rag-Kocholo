        "text": "For Gloria Gaynor, \"I Will F Survive\" is so much more than just a universally celebrated disco anthem. The song won Gloria, 80, a 1980 Grammy for Best Disco Recording, but it is also a mantra that has accompanied her throughout her life. \"The first step out of the darkness is recognizing that there is light at the end of the tunnel. There were times I just saw darkness, but the light was shown to me whenever I felt there was no way out,\" she tells Closer. Since its release in 1978, listeners have also embraced the song's message. \"I feel it has become the core of my purpose, which is to bring hope, encouragement and empowerment to people all over the world,\" Gloria says of \"I Will Survive.\"\n\nThat life-affirming mantra is now the title of a new documentary, Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive, which will debut in more than 900 movie theaters nationwide for one-day special screenings on Galentine's Day, Feb. 13.\n\nWhen did you decide to be a singer?\n\nI was 13 and standing in the hallway of my apartment building. I started singing Frankie Lymon's \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love.\" When my neighbor came downstairs, she said, \"Oh my goodness, I thought that was the radio.\" I thought, \"Oh, yes, I can do this!\"\n\nWho were the singers you admired?\n\nNancy Wilson. I loved her voice and style, not only her singing, but the way she carried herself and the way she dressed. She was very much a lady, and I admired that. I was very happy in my 40s to get to tell her that her song \"Save Your Love for Me\" was the first song I ever sang in public."
