        "text": "“I Will Survive” (1978) is one of the great empowerment songs of all-time. Gloria Gaynor—born in Newark 80 years ago—was 35 when she took that song to #1. What she has endured—including being cheated out of proper royalties, an ugly divorce from her manager husband of 25 years, being paralyzed from the waist down after an onstage fall, financial ruin and career devastation, is the subject of a 2024 documentary feature film, slated for released February 13. It is entitled, just like her 2000 memoir, Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive. It was her faith in God that saw her through. And she put her mighty talents into a gospel bag for 2019’s Testimony. Imagine hitting rock-bottom at 65? A lesser human might’ve succumbed to the indignity. You can watch the trailer here:"
