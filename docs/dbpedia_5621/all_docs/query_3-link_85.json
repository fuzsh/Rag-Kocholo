        "text": "After decades spent as the reigning Queen of Disco, Gloria Gaynor is announcing the release of her new gospel album, Testimony (June 7th). Recording for the first time in Nashville, Gaynor uplifts listeners with a carefully-chosen selection of classic hymns, self-penned songs, as well as a stirring cover of Bob Dylan’s “Man of Peace.”\n\nGloria Gaynor is an internationally acclaimed singer-songwriter with a long string of immediately recognizable hits to her name. Chief amongst these is “I Will Survive”, which has since been re-recorded more than 200 times by illustrious artists of all genres. In 2005, Gloria, along with the song, were inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame. Testament to the enduring impact of the song, VH-1 honored Gloria with the #1 spot during their countdown of the Top 100 Dance Records of All Time."
