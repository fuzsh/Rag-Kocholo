        "text": "On Sep 5, 2023\n\nNewark’s University Hospital has received a substantial art donation from 2x GRAMMY winner and global Gloria Gaynor, which will be displayed in the hospital’s Pediatrics Department and support its goal of creating a friendly, welcoming, and whimsical environment for young patients on their healing journeys.\n\nGaynor, celebrated for her timeless contribution to music, including hits “I Will Survive” and “Never Can Say Goodbye,” donated a 7-part series of paintings by artist Thomas Kinkade. The scenes are inspired by the Disney universe and are intended to enhance and uplift spirits in the Pediatrics wing. Inspired by the healing power of art, the gift is underpinned by Gaynor’s connection to the hospital. A Newark-Native, she was born at University Hospital under its previous name.\n\n“I’m giving the paintings in memory of my mom who was the best mom the world has ever known.” Said Ms. Gaynor, “She gave birth to all of her children at University Hospital, which at the time was called ‘Newark City Hospital.”\n\n“The administration, staff, and employees at University Hospital are appreciative of Ms. Gaynor’s generosity and touched by her personal connection to the hospital.” Said Ed Jimenez, president and CEO of University Hospital, “Ms. Gaynor’s music has uplifted so many over generations as this series will in the Pediatrics Department.\n\nThe Department of Pediatrics is a multidisciplinary, cross-departmental program of University Hospital and the New Jersey Medical School. The institute offers family-centered care from birth through adolescence with a full array of ambulatory and inpatient services for health needs that range from routine to life-threatening. The hospital offers a 10-bed general pediatric unit and an extensive Child Life Program to support children in the Department’s inpatient units through developmentally appropriate play activities.\n\nThe Thomas Kinkade series is on display as of September 1st, 2023. The first painting in the series, titled, “Disney The Lion King: Remember Who You Are,” was unveiled at a small gathering at the Hospital today with Ms. Gaynor present.\n\nGaynor recently returned from a special command performance in Tuscany, Italy, with the world-famous Italian Tenor, Mr. Andrea Bocelli, followed by concert dates in Malaga, Spain; Geneva, Switzerland; Albufeira, Portugal; and Montreal, Canada for crowds in excess of 60,000 people at her performances. She will be in concert with her ten-piece band on Saturday, Sept. 16, at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in Englewood.\n\nTo access more business news, visit NJB News Now.\n\nRelated Articles:"
