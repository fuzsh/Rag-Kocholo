        "text": "Born: 1949. Living in: United States\n\nGloria Gaynor is an American singer, best known for the disco era hits \"I Will Survive\" (Hot 100 number 1, 1979), \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" (Hot 100 number 9, 1974), \"Let Me Know (I Have a Right)\" (Hot 100 number 42, 1980) and \"I Am What I Am\" (R&B number 82, 1983). After almost 30 years of its release, Gaynor continues to ride the success of \"I Will Survive\", touring the country and the world over and performing her signature song on dozens of TV shows. A few successful remixes of the song during the 1990s and 2000s along with new versions of the song by Lonnie Gordon, Diana Ross, Chantay Savage, rock group Cake and others as well as constant recurrent airplay on nearly all Soft AC and Rhythmic format radio stations have helped to keep the song in the mainstream."
