However Boston disco radio DJ Jack King promoted \"I Will Survive\" and he massive audience response forced the record company to flip the songs, so that subsequent copies of the single listed the more popular song on the A-side. Gaynor and King each received a Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording in 1980, the only year that award was given (Gloria had to wait another 40 years for her second Grammy, in the Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album category, for Testimony, in January 2020).\n\nGaynor would achieve her final success in the 1980s with the release of her album I Am Gloria Gaynor in 1984. This was mainly due to the song \"I Am What I Am\", which became a hit at dance clubs, and then on the Club Play chart in late 1983/early 1984. \"I Am What I Am\" became a gay anthem and made Gaynor a gay icon.\n\nGaynor married her manager Linwood Simon in 1979. The couple divorced in 2005. She has no children. According to Gaynor, while she always wanted children, her ex-husband never desired any.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nassociate relationship with Minogue, Kylie (born 28 May 1968).
