        "text": "1.1K\n\nA new documentary about Newark native Gloria Gaynor, best known for her ’70s hits “I Will Survive” and “Never Can Say Goodbye,” will be shown in theaters TBA on Feb. 13. You can watch its trailer below.\n\nIts title is “Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive,” and it was directed by Betsy Schechter. The website describes the movie as “A journey of faith, hope, and a magnificent second act.”\n\nA press release elaborates:\n\nGloria Gaynor, music icon and disco legend, inspired millions for decades with her words “I will survive.” But she only truly understood the profound meaning of her lyrics when she hit rock bottom at the age of 65. Facing a devastating divorce to her husband and manager of 25 years, financial ruin, and spiraling health concerns, Gaynor sought to not only survive, but thrive.\n\nWith unwavering faith and the spark of new dreams, the film follows Gaynor as she embarks on an unexpectedly difficult 8-year journey to write and record a gospel album, rising up after downfall. Going behind the mic, we discover a tale of the remarkable challenges that fueled Gaynor’s music and path to stardom, and her present-day message empowering audiences to believe it’s never too late to transform dreams into reality.\n\nThat gospel album, 2019’s Testimony, featured guest appearances by Yolanda Adams, MercyMe’s Bart Millard and others, and won a Grammy in the Roots Gospel Album category.\n\nFor information and updates, visit gloriagaynoriwillsurvivemovie.com."
