        "text": "A homegrown Garden State talent who rose to fame during the height of disco is looking to sell a suburban house after calling the custom-designed property home for two decades.\n\nNewark-born singer Gloria Gaynor, who won a Grammy for her 1978 hit single “I Will Survive,” is trying one more time to find a buyer for her two-story home in Green Brook. The house sits on a quiet cul-de-sac in the small Somerset County town, which is home to about 7,000 residents.\n\nFirst built in 1988 on a lot spanning about an acre, Gaynor and her former husband purchased the home over 20 years ago from architect Jeffrey Beer. The disco queen paid $888,000 for the digs back then and has now listed the 5,318-square-foot home for $1.249 million.\n\nThe custom-designed house sports five bedrooms, four full bathrooms, and two half-baths in a space that is entered through a two-story marble foyer complete with floor-to-ceiling windows. A sunken living room features a marble wood-burning fireplace that leads to a formal dining area, while the nearby kitchen comes equipped with granite countertops, a breakfast bar, and a pantry.\n\nThe first-floor master bedroom suite features an en-suite bathroom with a Jacuzzi, a walk-in closet, a solarium, plus a sitting room complete with fireplace. The property’s finished basement focuses on recreation with a game room, home gym, and a home theater with 12 reclining seats.\n\nA ground-level patio in the backyard leads to an enclosed heated pool and gazebo complete with a “stage” that Gaynor constructed for parties. The home, which also includes a three-car garage, is located about 35 miles west and south of New York City. Property taxes on the house run $26,471/year.\n\nGaynor’s home has been offered for sale twice since the start of 2019, with the initial asking price set at $1.4 million. Lisa Poggi with Douglas Elliman is the broker of record on the current listing, which hit the market earlier this month."
