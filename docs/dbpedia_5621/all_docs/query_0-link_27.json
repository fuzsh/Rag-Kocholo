        "text": "When Gloria Gaynor began performing \"I Will Survive,\" a song that would become an anthem for generations of women done wrong, she considered it simply a \"timeless lyric.\"\n\nBut after more than three up and down decades in the music industry, the 1995 beating death of her sister, Irma Proctor, and her failed 24-year marriage, Gaynor says that for the first time in her life, she considers \"I Will Survive,\" a personal declaration.\"I am actually singing that song for myself now,\" she says. And last month, Gaynor released a commemorative CD of the '70s hit to mark its 30 anniversary.\n\nDuring a visit to her sprawling 5,500-square-foot contemporary-style home, The Green Brook resident talked about the new significance of the song in her life and spoke publicly for the first time about the 2005 breakup of her 30-year relationship with Linwood Simon, a former New York City Transit police officer and music publisher. Now on her own in the dream home she and Simon bought together in 1999 for $888,000, Gaynor still loves everything about the property, which is tucked into the foothills of the Watchung Mountains.\n\n\"The house was already here,\" Gaynor says, sitting in her comfortable living room lined with floor-to-ceiling windows -- a feature that initially drew her to the house.\n\n\"My ex-husband went around to find houses he liked and he loved this one. I said, \"Okay, he loves it. I fell in love with it immediately. Let's get it.'\"\n\nUntil then, the couple had been living in Simon's apartment in Cliffside Park, Bergen County.\n\n\"I saw how bright it was with the floor to- ceiling windows and skylights in the bedroom and terrace, and I just love modern structures. And I love the fact that the basement leads out to the backyard,\" she says.\n\n\"We weren't looking in a particular area -- I just loved driving up here when we first saw it. The houses are really beautiful.\"\n\nIt's a long way from the gritty streets of Newark where a little girl named Gloria Fowles was born in 1949, but Gaynor couldn't feel more comfortable in her country home.\n\n\"I've got country-style neighbors. We borrow cups of sugar from each other. We pick up each other's mail, but we're not in each other's face all the time. I was here well over a year before they knew who I was.\"\n\nOne neighbor welcomed her with a plant, a card and a map of the neighborhood. She was told where the post office and the nearest grocery store were.\n\n\"When there's a party, they'll bring a potato salad or a pan of something, and they invite me to their houses.\"\n\nFor a long time, everything was perfect -- and then it wasn't. \"It was a fairytale for about 20 years,\" Gaynor says about her marriage.\n\n\"We had a fairytale meeting. I was working with his sisters, who were my background singers, and we became like sisters.\"\n\nThey showed her a picture of their brother one day, and right away Gaynor declared, \"That's my husband!\"\n\n\"We met four months later and it was love at first sight.\" She got pregnant on their honeymoon but lost the child.\n\n\"We were actually together 30 years. We went together five years and things were going fine, then little by little things started to change.\n\n\"I was married a lot longer than he was . . . Let's just say we just grew apart.\"\n\nWhen Gaynor was inducted into the Disco Hall of Fame in 2006, she says her signature song took on a whole different meaning.\n\n\"I sang it for the first time for myself. Everything was going on but nobody knew about it,\" Gaynor says about her breakup.\n\n\"I sang a marathon version of it when I began to think about my own situation and sang it for about 10 minutes. I was really feeling empowered and I think it just dawned on me that the song had truly become the story of my life. And I was not only surviving, I was triumphant.\"\n\nToday Gaynor's still in demand, performing her Disco hits, including another favorite, \"Never Can Say Goodbye.\"\n\nShe says that despite her divorce, she hasn't said farewell to the concept of marriage. And she believes the future holds nothing but possibilities.\n\n\"I don't blame marriage,\" she says. \"I do understand and appreciate the institution of marriage and I can look back and say I gave my all to the marriage and that it (ending) wasn't my fault. If anything, I was not setting up boundaries for myself. He was very controlling. I'd wonder, \"Where do you end and I begin?'\"\n\nGaynor says she's happy now, and that one day she might meet that special someone, but believes that you don't find love when you go looking for it.\n\n\"I attribute my happiness now to my faith.\" Gaynor became a born-again Christian in 1982. \"I had come to a place in my life that everyone would call success, yet I felt unfulfilled. I'm a very analytical person, so I was very curious. I went on a quest to find out what can make a person feel fulfilled.\n\n\"I had cars, houses, jewels, furs, and a husband who loved me, and a career I was happy with. But I found fulfillment in my relationship with Christ,\" she says.\n\n\"The best way I can describe it is when you've had a huge meal -- soup to nuts -- yet you're not satisfied. Something didn't quite do it for me. Christ does not fulfill the human element, but he certainly fulfills every other need in your life. As far as I'm concerned, there's no better love affair.\"\n\nIn the future, Gaynor sees shifting her focus from singing to giving back to her community. She wants to help teenagers and other young people starting families without fathers.\n\n\"I want to establish a center in Newark with a large staff of people with degrees in psychology and marriage and family counseling,\" Gaynor says, noting that she was the \"neighborhood babysitter\" as a young girl living in the city. \"It's a large vision that I have.\""
