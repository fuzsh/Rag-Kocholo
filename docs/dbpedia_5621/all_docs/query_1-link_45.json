        "text": "Career\n\nGloria Gaynor was a singer with the Soul Satisfiers, a jazz/pop band, in the 1960s. Her first solo single was \"She'll Be Sorry/Let Me Go Baby\" (1965). Her first real success came in 1975 with the release of her album Never Can Say Goodbye, which established her as a disco artist. The first side of this album consisted of three disco songs (\"Honey Bee\", \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" and \"Reach Out, I'll Be There\"), with no breaks in between the songs. This 19-minute dance marathon proved to be enormously popular, especially at dance clubs. All three songs were released as singles via radio edits, and all of them became hits. \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" became the first song to top Billboard magazine's dance chart. So, in that sense, she was the first. Capitalizing on the success of her first album, Gloria Gaynor quickly released her second album Experience Gloria Gaynor later that same year. While this album was also successful, it was not quite as popular as her previous album in the mainstream.\n\nAfter her 1976 album, I've Got You, Gaynor shifted from her hit production team, to work with other productions. While it seemed like a good move, her subsequent producers did not seem to match Gaynor's vocal approach and style as well. This caused her the albums that followed such as 1977's Glorious and 1978's Park Avenue Sound to be regarded as merely good albums instead of excellent albums.\n\nIn late 1978, with the release of her album Love Tracks, she climbed the pop charts again because of her song \"I Will Survive\". The song was awarded the first and only Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording in 1980 (the category was discontinued upon disco's fall from favor shortly afterward). In late 1979, she released the album I Have A Right which contained her next disco hit, \"Let Me Know (I Have The Right)\", which featured Doc Severinsen of The Tonight Show fame, on trumpet solo. In 1999, Pixar animator Victor Navoneused this song to create an alien music video which for a time was a minor Internet phenomenon.\n\nIn September 2002, Logic Records/BMG released the highly anticipated United States LP entitled \"I Wish You Love.\" That was her first worldwide release in 15 years. It gave birth to 4 #1 dance singles on Billboards Dance Charts as well as her first top ten, \"I Never Knew\", on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Charts. She also recorded a new version of \"I Will Survive\" in Spanglish, recorded live in Brazil.\n\nHer popularity has continuously flourished into the new millennium. In 2002, she was honored at the World Music Awards in Monte Carlo with the coveted LEGEND award presented by long time fan Prince Albert. She made a splash on Broadway in the longest running musical revue, \"Smokey Joe's Café\", and on national TV, as a guest star on such popular programs as \"That '70's Show\" , \"Ally McBeal\" and more, introducing her to a whole new generation of fans.\n\nGloria is finishing a new album of inspirational songs \"Testimony\". She spent time in Nashville during 2014 and 2015 co-writing and collaborating with Grammy Winning Contemporary Christian Music songwriters and producers."
