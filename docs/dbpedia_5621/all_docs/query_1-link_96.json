It becomes a female-empowerment anthem, but the song was written by two men.\n\nGaynor summons up her inner strength in this disco classic, singing about all those nights she spent thinking about the one who did her wrong, and deciding that it's time to move on. Sounds like she's trying to escape the orbit of an overbearing ex, but for the song's lyricist Dino Fekaris, it had a different meaning. Fekaris was a staff writer at Motown Records, where his compositions included \"I Just Want to Celebrate\" by Rare Earth and \"Mother Nature\" by The Temptations. When Motown fired him, he was distraught, facing grim prospects as an out-of-work songwriter. His spirits lifted when he turned on the TV and a song he wrote for Rare Earth played on the program. Fekaris saw it as a sign: \"I'm going to be a songwriter. I will survive!\" Fekaris and another former Motown employee, producer Freddie Perren, formed a production company and made a demo of \"I Will Survive.\" When Gloria Gaynor came in to record a song called \"Substitute,\" they played her \"I Will Survive,\" and she recorded it for the B-side. \"Substitute\" made it to #107, but DJs (in clubs and radio stations) started playing the flip side. \"I Will Survive\" is issued as the A-side and it climbs to #1, giving confidence and courage to anyone looking to break free from a toxic relationship.\n\nCategories\n\nCharts\n\nDisco\n\nOne-Hit Wonders"
