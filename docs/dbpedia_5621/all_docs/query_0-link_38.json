        "text": "Gloria Gaynor is saying goodbye to her longtime suburban New Jersey home.\n\nThe Newark-born singer, best known for the megahit “I Will Survive,” is asking $1.25 million for the 5,318-square-foot in Green Brook, according to the New York Times.\n\nShe previously put it on the market in 2019 and then again at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. The housing market has picked back up in the past year.\n\nThe home was built in 1988 by its architect, Jeffrey Beer. Gaynor and her former husband Linwood Simon bought the property in 1998, according to the publication.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nGaynor said that over the years she has renovated the kitchen and bathrooms and finished the walkout basement. It has five bedrooms, four full bathrooms, and two half bathrooms.\n\nThe front entrance leads to a two-story octagonal foyer with marble floors. Off the foyer, there’s a master suite with a walk-in closet, sunroom and sitting room. The large sunken living room features a marble fireplace, and there’s a formal dining area.\n\nGaynor said she regularly hosted parties at the house and — fittingly, for a disco queen — built a stage for dancing in front of the pool.\n\nGaynor is now selling the property following health issues that have made its layout challenging for her, per the report. She’s currently building a house in Englewood Cliffs and plans to move in early next year."
