        "text": "[2020, on being Grammy-nominated at age 76, after 50+ years in the music business] Being nominated for two Grammys is really quite exciting for me and it's kind of a stamp of approval of what I've been doing and where I've been trying to go and where I've been trying to bring my audience. It's saying, 'Yes, you're on the right track.' And not only that but 'You're doing a good job of it.' So it's very exciting for me.\n\nThere was always music in my childhood home, but only my brothers sang in public. Being a girl, I wasn't invited. Then one day, aged 13, I was singing to myself in the hallway of our building. A neighbour came down the stairs and said, \"My goodness, Gloria, was that you? I thought it was the radio.\" I decided then and there I would perform."
