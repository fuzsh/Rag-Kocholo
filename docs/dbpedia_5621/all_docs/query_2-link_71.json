        "text": "University Hospital, New Jersey’s only public academic medical center and the principal teaching hospital for all Newark-based medical education has received a substantial art donation from two-time Grammy Award-winning singer and humanitarian Gloria Gaynor. The gifted collection will be displayed in the Pediatrics Department and support University Hospital’s goal of creating a friendly, welcoming, and whimsical environment for young patients on their healing journeys.\n\nThe first painting in the Thomas Kinkade series, titled, “Disney The Lion King: Remember Who You Are,” was unveiled at a small gathering at the Hospital yesterday. WBGO's Doug Doyle had a chance to ask Gaynor some questions during the event on September 1. Gaynor, who was born at University Hospital, not only talked about why she wanted to give back to kids and the community, but she also told stories about her hit global anthem \"I Will Survive\" and her first gig at the Cadillac Club in Newark.
