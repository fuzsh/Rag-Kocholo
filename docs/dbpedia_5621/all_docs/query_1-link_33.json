        "text": "Description\n\nGrammy Award winner and Hall of Famer, GLORIA GAYNOR was born on the 7th of September 1949 in Newark, N.J. and sang as a young girl in her school choir, mixed chorus and her schools girl glee club. While she knew she one day wanted to have a career in music, GLORIA GAYNOR still went to school with the aim of having something to fall back on and studied beauty and business courses.\n\nGaynor began to taste real success with the release of her cover version of Never Can Say Goodbye and later became iconic with the release of I Will Survive in 1978.\n\nIn 1982 GLORIA GAYNOR released her 10th studio album, GLORIA GAYNOR on Atlantic Records, now fully remastered and repackaged for the first time on CD by BBR! The album featured three singles which placed Gloria in a more R&B/Street Soul groove than she had previously recorded. Tease Me was followed by an update of the Supremes classic Stop In The Name Of Love which saw Gaynor backed by Kool & The Gang. The patriotic America continued the new sound that would span across the album."
