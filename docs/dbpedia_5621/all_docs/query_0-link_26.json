        "text": "Born: 7 September 1943\n\nBirth name: Gloria Fowles\n\nGloria was born in Newark in New Jersey. Her father played ukulele and guitar in a band called Step ‘n Fetchit which played in nightclubs. She began her singing career as part of a band called the Soul Satisfiers and recorded a single called ‘She’ll Be Sorry’ in her own name in 1965 which was released on Johnny Nash’s Jocida label. In 1971 she signed for Columbia Records but her only output there was a single called ‘Honey Bee’ which didn’t do anything and she would leave the label. Her breakthrough came when she signed for MGM records and saw her single, ‘Never Can Say Goodbye’, go to number 9 in the US and 2 in the UK. She would go on to see 7 US hits, topping the charts with ‘I Will Survive’ in 1979. In the UK she has seen 11 hits with ‘I Will Survive’ also being her only chart topper."
