        "text": "University Hospital kicked off the Labor Day holiday weekend in a big way – welcoming hometown hero and Grammy award winner Gloria Gaynor to Newark.\n\nThe music legend was on hand Sept. 1 to make a substantial art donation to the state’s only public academic medical center. As a result, a seven-part series of paintings by artist Thomas Kinkade, inspired by the Disney universe, are now on display in the Pediatrics Department.\n\nThe contribution, University Hospital said, will help to create “a friendly, welcoming and whimsical environment for young patients on their healing journeys.”\n\n“The administration, staff, and employees at University Hospital are appreciative of Ms. Gaynor’s generosity and touched by her personal connection to the hospital,” said Ed Jimenez, president and CEO of University Hospital. “Ms. Gaynor’s music has uplifted so many over generations as this series will in the Pediatrics Department.”\n\nGaynor’s ties to University Hospital go beyond the power of her voice – which can be heard on hits including “I Will Survive” and “Never Can Say Goodbye” – as the singer was born at the facility under its previous name, the hospital said.\n\n“I’m giving the paintings in memory of my mom who was the best mom the world has ever known,” Gaynor said. “She gave birth to all of her children at University Hospital, which at the time was called ‘Newark City Hospital.’”\n\nThe first painting in the donated series, “Disney The Lion King: Remember Who You Are,” was unveiled during a Sept. 1 event at the hospital.\n\nThe Department of Pediatrics at University Hospital, also the principal teaching hospital for all Newark-based medical education, is a multidisciplinary, cross-departmental program between the facility and the New Jersey Medical School. It offers family-centered care with a a full slate of ambulatory and inpatient services with a 10-bed general pediatric unit and an extensive Child Life Program to to support children in the department’s inpatient units through developmentally appropriate play activities."
