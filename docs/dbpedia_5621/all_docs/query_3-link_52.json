        "text": "On February 13, in 800-theaters across the country, audiences can pay tribute to musical icon and disco legend Gloria Gaynor whose contributions have inspired millions with her powerful song “I Will Survive,” for a one-night-only theatrical release of the riveting documentary from Director Betsy Schechter, GLORIA GAYNOR: I WILL SURVIVE. Following the screening, guests will participate in a once-in-a-lifetime singalong of the song that has inspired millions “I Will Survive.”\n\nGLORIA GAYNOR: I WILL SURVIVE is a story about reinvention, the power of faith and a magnificent second act.\n\n“I am finally in a place of joy and self-fulfillment, and I am ready to share my secret to not only surviving, but thriving with the world,” said Gloria.\n\nThe documentary which has been hailed by critics as “...affectionate and engrossing…” and that “...inspires the audience to believe it’s never too late to do whatever it is you want…” is a celebration of an icon and a testament to the power of resilience.\n\nGLORIA GAYNOR: I WILL SURVIVE is Directed by Betsy Schechter.\n\n##"
