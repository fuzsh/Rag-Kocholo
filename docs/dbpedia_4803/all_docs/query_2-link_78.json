Preferably, this database is located in the IT security system of the building itself.\n\nthe reading device also comprises a microcontroller, which is linked to all of the components comprised in the reading device, to assess whether or not access should be granted to the person.\n\nthe microcontroller executes the method for access control which comprises the following stages: reading the recorded heart rate and unique code comprised in the chip through the reading/recording element, registering this heart rate and the unique code in the database connected to the network of the server of the access control system, verifying the unique code with that of the database and assigning a new code in the chip and in the database, comparing the heart rate to the range of values that comprises at least one previously registered heart rate in the database for the person; when the heart rate is not within said range, maintaining the latches extracted and blocking access to facilities and showing a feedback by means of colors and sounds emitted by the light and by the horn, respectively; when the heart rate is within said range, requesting that the person place their preferred finger in the biometric reader in order for their fingerprint to be read, verifying the fingerprint in the database, and when the fingerprint is located\n\na system administrator enters the data of each person who has access to the facility into a database and previously provides a first unique code and/or a first heart rate to each emitting device.\n\nthe access control system will be waiting for an access request, and once the user has the emitting device and proceeds to request access to the area, the reading device will proceed to take the readings of the emitting device of the user.\n\nthe system will compare the records saved in the database connected to the access control system network and, depending on the results, will either grant or deny access to the area.\n\nthe microprocessor will block the person's access for a period of 24 hours as a security measure against possible threats where the person might be involved in a high-risk situation causing their vital signs to be altered.\n\nOne advantage of the invention is that unique code varies with each reading, unlike other inventions that use permanent codes that may easily be copied.\n\nThis invention is more secure than others since it combines random unique codes with specific heart rate ranges and fingerprints of the person. This combination makes it impossible for third parties to use force against people who have access to facilities to make them open the door.\n\nAnother advantage of the invention is the use of an emergency electric battery in the case of a power failure within the facility, generating records of the failure and of all people who entered before, during and after the power outage, thereby preventing possible intruders.\n\nAnother advantage of the invention is the rechargeable battery of the emitting device, which makes it more environmentally friendly since it reduces the amount of disposable batteries that are purchased.\n\nFigure 1 shows a front view of the second emitting device.\n\nFigure 2 shows another front view of the second emitting device.\n\nFigure 3 shows a general front view of the reading device located in a door.\n\nFigure 4 shows a front view of the first of the reading devices located in a door.\n\nFigure 5 shows a general top view of the reading device located in a door.\n\nFigure 6 shows a side view of the reading device located in a door.\n\nFigure 7 shows an inner side view of the reading device located in a door.\n\nFigure 8 shows a flow chart of the access control method.\n\na preferred embodiment of the present invention is an access control system that comprises a reading device (1) by way of a lock on a door, wherein this reading device (1) establishes communication with an emitting device (9), intended to be worn by a person.\n\nfigures 1 and 2 show an emitting device (9) which comprises a chip (10) for reading and recording the access data linked to a heart rate reader (1 1) intended to measure and record the heart rate of the person wearing the emitting device (9).\n\na heart rate reader (1 1) intended to measure and record the heart rate of the person wearing the emitting device (9).\n\nBoth the chip (10) and the heart rate reader (1 1) are electrically powered by a rechargeable battery (12), which is also comprised in the emitting device (9).\n\nthis chip In addition to recording the person's heartbeats, or the recorded heart rate (16), this chip (10) records a unique code (17).\n\nthis emitting device (9) is an accessory for the wrist.\n\nfigures 3 to 8 show different views of the reading device (1) and of the access control method, wherein the reading device (1) is intended to be placed in the lock of the door of the facility to control the access of people.\n\nThis reading device (1) comprises a reading/recording element (3) intended to read the unique code (17) and the recorded heart rate (16), a screen (2) intended to show information, and a biometric reader (4) intended to record a fingerprint (14).\n\nAt least the reading/recording element (3), the screen (2) and the biometric reader (4) are controlled by a microcontroller, not shown, which, once the unique code (17) is read, emits a new unique code (15) and classifies the recorded heart rate (16). If this recorded heart rate (16) is within the normal range, that is to say between 60 and 80 beats per minute, it is considered to be within a normal range and therefore information is then requested (name, surname, a recent photo, the department in which the person works, etc.) of the person who is wearing the emitting device (9) from a database (13) and this information is shown on the screen (2). Once the information is shown on the screen, the microcontroller proceeds with the biometric reading of the fingerprint (14) by means of the biometric reader (4).\n\nthe reading device (1) will show a feedback of the person wearing the emitting device (9) with colors and sounds, which will be made by lights (5) and horns (8), respectively.\n\nfigure 2 shows a front schematic view of the reading device (1) located in the lock of the door, wherein the reading device (1) comprises a set of retractable latches (6) that extend or retract depending on whether or not access is granted to the person wearing the emitting device (9). More specifically, figure 7 shows how the latches (6) of the reading device (1) are intended to be coupled, when they are extended, at stations (7) made in the doorframe.\n\nFigure 8 shows the flow chart of the access control method that is preferably done by the microcontroller. More specifically, this method comprises the steps of: reading the recorded rate (16) and the unique code (17) comprised in the chip (10) by means of the reading/recording element (3), recording this recorded heart rate (16) and the unique code (17) in the database, verifying the unique code (17) with that of the database and assigning a new unique code (15), comparing the recorded heart rate (16) to a range of values considered to be normal for the person wearing the emitting device (9); when the recorded heart rate (16) is within said range, requesting and taking a reading of the fingerprint (14) by means of a biometric reader (4), verifying the fingerprint (14) in the database, and when this fingerprint is located in the database, proceeding to retract the latches (6) and grant access to the area.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nHuman Computer Interaction (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nMeasurement Of The Respiration, Hearing Ability, Form, And Blood Characteristics Of Living Organisms (AREA)\n\nLock And Its Accessories (AREA)\n\nCollating Specific Patterns (AREA)\n\nPCT/IB2016/055829 2016-07-28 2016-09-29 System and method for access control WO2017042764A1 (en)\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (2)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title PA91279 2016-07-28 PA9127901 2016-07-28\n\nPublications (1)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date WO2017042764A1 true WO2017042764A1 (en) 2017-03-16\n\nFamily\n\nID=62791432\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date PCT/IB2016/055829 WO2017042764A1 (en) 2016-07-28 2016-09-29 System and method for access control\n\nCountry Status (1)\n\nCountry Link WO (1) WO2017042764A1 (nl)\n\nCitations (4)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US5574425A (en) * 1995-02-03 1996-11-12 Aaa Plus International, Inc.
