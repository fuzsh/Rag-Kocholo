        "text": "Born in McAllen on March 29, 1980, Yadira was raised in Mission, TX by her parents, Rosa Maria and Ricardo Rosales (deceased). And grew up with her brothers, Ricardo Rosales Jr. and Jose Jesus Rosales. Yadira Lizette Rosales embraced the arms of eternal peace and slumber the morning of December 2, 2022.\n\nYadira’s nurturing and vivacious spirit provided warmth and humor at any event or family function. She always tried to attend them all because she treasured her connections among her family, who has shown so much love and support while Yadira had been suffering. After her time came to finally rest, her presence had the ability to bring out the best in people. She saw the best in everyone and cherished the authentic relationships and bonds she maintained among her lifelong friends, relatives, and especially her dearest loved ones.\n\nYadira had a tenacious attitude and despite how much her body hurt or how little sleep she received, she always pushed past her doubts. She was a self-reliant, strong and independent woman who was always an example of what strength and resilience looked like. Although, her body and mind were exhausted, Yadira fought to the very last minute as she was surrounded by her loved ones one last waking moment.\n\nYadira presumed the role of Mama Bear and always ensured the safety and needs not only for her mother and biological children. She had an extended surplus hospitality for anyone and everyone who has had the opportunity to step on the doorstep of her life. Making it a point to support her children Carina Yisette, Carlos Yisai, and Alyssa Yvette. Yadira always persevered to make sure her children didn’t have to live a life in pain and suffering like she did. Not always having all the answers or resources, Yadira was clever and always managed to support any and all pursuits of her beautiful children she raised. Yadira never failed to show pride and support for their accomplishments. Whether it was attending talent shows, swim meets, parent-teacher nights, or football games, Yadira always made it a priority to be there for her children. And anyone else's endeavors who were also a part of her children’s lives.\n\nShe may have felt alone in her battle, but her passing has shown the amounts of love and support from the community that she created whom she was so loyal, transparent and truthful to. Among all the gracious amounts of friends and family and many more than could be counted, Yadira has always been and will always be loved and cared for because she was never alone in her battles. The memories created were deeply cherished by Yadira in her waking life, and will continue to be memorialized in celebration of her life as per her wishes.\n\nYadira is survived by her loving family: Carina Yisette Martinez, Carlos Yisai Martinez, Alyssa Yvette Segura, Step-Daughter's Ashley Martinez, Angela Katia Zapata, Step-Son Rafael Arturo Segura Jr, Husband Rafael Arturo Segura, Mother Rosa M. Rosales, Brother’s Ricardo Rosales Jr and Jose Jesus Rosales. And the COUNTLESS uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, and friends. She will live on forever in our hearts and was loved so much and will be deeply missed. Rest in peace, Yadira.\n\nVisitations will be held from 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm Wednesday, December 7, 2022 at Rivera Funeral Home of Mission with a Holy Rosary being recited at 7:00 pm.
