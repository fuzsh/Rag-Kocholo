        "text": "The admission routes and requirements into Master's level teachings are those set out in Royal Decree 1393/2007 of October 29, with its subsequent modification in Royal Decree 861/2010, of July 2, which establishes the planning of official university teachings.\n\nFor its part, the admission profile for the Master's Degree in Behavioral Problems in Educational Centers at the Antonio de Nebrija University is as follows:\n\nAll applicants who meet the requirements imposed by current legislation will be able to access the Master's Degree in Behavioral Problems in Educational Centers, and the candidates must be graduates (associate's, undergraduate, bachelor's or master's degree) in Education, Social Work or Psychology.\n\nAs established in Article 16 of RD 1393/2007, modified by RD 861/2010, students who meet any of the following conditions will be able to access Master's degree studies:\n\nHave an official Spanish university degree, or other degree issued by an institution of higher education of the European Higher Education Area that grants access to Master's studies in the country issuing said degree and that fits the established admission profile to access this degree.\n\nGraduates of educational systems outside the European Higher Education Area may access without the need for homologation of their degrees, after verification by the University that they accredit a level of studies equivalent to the corresponding official Spanish university degrees and that these grant access to postgraduate education in the country issuing said degree. Access through this route will not imply, in any case, the homologation of the previous degree of the interested party, nor its recognition for other purposes than that of taking the Master's degree. In the cases in which the homologation of any degree, diploma or studies obtained abroad is required to access the University, the Antonio de Nebrija University may admit on a conditional basis the students who prove that they have submitted the corresponding application for homologation while it is being resolved. The University has developed a \"Conditional Enrollment Procedure\" within the Academic Organization Plan that includes these cases.\n\nIn the case of students with Special Educational Needs (SEN), the need for possible curricular adaptations, itineraries or alternative studies will be assessed.\n\nNon-Spanish-speaking candidates must submit a certification that accredits knowledge of the Spanish language at a B2 level of the CEFR. The level accreditation will be validated through the official diplomas admitted in the table of certificates accepted by ACLES and/or Instituto Cervantes. Valid for one year.\n\nAs a general rule, the admission documentation will be submitted to the Admissions Department.\n\nThe student must provide the originals or certified copies of the documentation submitted within the deadline established by the University in order to formalize their enrollment. Any inaccuracy, falsity or omission of information, statement or document provided by the student in the admission period will determine the impossibility of continuing to exercise the right from the moment the University has proof of such facts, proceeding to the cancellation of the application for admission submitted and the place awarded, notwithstanding the criminal, civil or administrative responsibilities that may arise.\n\nIn order to access the official university master's degrees, it is necessary to submit the following documentation:\n\nCompleted admission application.\n\nIdentification document (D.N.I) or valid passport.\n\n1 passport-size photograph.\n\nAcademic transcript with the grades that grant access to the Master's degree.\n\nCertified photocopy of official Spanish university diploma or receipt of having requested it.\n\nForeign students:\n\nCertified photocopy of the official diploma issued by a foreign higher education institution belonging to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) that grants, in the issuing country, access the official master's degree studies.\n\nCertified photocopy of the official diploma issued in a foreign educational system not belonging to the EHEA. In this case, access will be conditional upon verifying that the studies completed correspond to a level of education equivalent to that of official Spanish university degrees, and that they enable access to official master's degrees in the country where the diploma was issued. This procedure does not imply, in any case, the homologation of the previous degree, nor its recognition for any other purpose than to access the master's studies.\n\nOnly if necessary, will the foreign student be asked for a letter issued by the University in which he/she has completed the level that grants access to the Master's degree studies in the country issuing the diploma.\n\nIn the event that the studies with which the pre-registration for the Master's degree is accessed are completed in a Foreign Higher Education institution, both the diploma and the academic record (grades) must be official and issued by the competent authorities, in accordance with the legal system of the country of origin.\n\nIf the number of applicants exceeds the number of places offered, the student's academic record (average grade) will be taken as an admission criterion.\n\nTherefore, anyone interested in accessing the Master's Degree in Behavioral Problems in Educational Centers must present their academic record, since it will be the average grade therein that decides their admission to the Master's degree, in the event that the number of applications exceed the number of places offered.\n\nOnce the places are full, if there are more people interested in accessing the degree, they will be put on the waiting list for possible vacancies that may arise before the start of the academic year, for which the admission and selection criteria detailed in point 4 will be applied for the rest of applicants.\n\nIn addition to the evaluation of the academic merits provided by the candidate, students must take the following tests that are part of the admission process.\n\nIn addition to the evaluation of the academic merits provided by the candidate (20%), the students must have a personal interview (80%), held by the Director of the Program or by University advisers. This interview is aimed at verifying the suitability of the candidate and their profile in accordance with the degree. This is done in order to determine if the candidate has sufficient motivation, training and knowledge, abilities, aptitudes, communication skills, extracurricular activities and future interests necessary to be admitted as a student of the Nebrija University postgraduate programs.\n\nIn addition, non-Spanish-speaking foreign students must take a Spanish language placement test in order to know their real level of language. It will not be necessary for the candidate to take the language placement test if he/she submits a certification that accredits knowledge of the Spanish language at B2 level of the CEFR. The level accreditation will be validated through the official diplomas admitted in the table of certificates accepted by ACLES and/or Instituto Cervantes.\n\nIn order to access this Admission Process, candidates must accredit having a degree (associate's, undergraduate, bachelor's or master's degree) in Education, Social Work or Psychology."
