        "text": "As I’ve already mentioned elsewhere on this blog (see here and here), part of my PhD thesis focuses on the representation of immigrants and immigration in contemporary Spanish cinema. A crucial counterpoint to this figure is the Spanish exile or emigrant, a figure relatively neglected in contemporary scholarship on Spanish migratory cinema. In this context, Spanish exiles and emigrants are of both historical and contemporary relevance. As an example, Biutiful (Iñárritu, 2010), which I analyse in my thesis, juxtaposes the Spaniard exiled from Francoist Spain with contemporary immigrants.[i] The father of protagonist Uxbal, who appears as a ghost in the film, indexes historical patterns of migration that predate Spain’s contemporary status as a host country. Such patterns are often overlooked in discussions of the contemporary phenomenon of immigration to Spain.\n\nWhile Biutiful proffers a somewhat gritty portrait of the harsh realities of immigration, emigration and exile, the subject of this post – Un franco, 14 pesetas (Iglesias, 2006) – provides a more light-hearted depiction of these issues. Unlike Biutiful, which straddles two temporal moments, Un franco, 14 pesetas focuses solely on Spanish emigrants in the context of Francoist Spain. The film is one of several in director Iglesias’ filmography that deals with the theme of emigration from Francoist Spain: Ispansi (2010) is set during the Second World War and concerns the transportation of Spaniards out of Spain at this time, while 2 francos, 40 pesetas (2014) is the sequel to Un franco, 14 pesetas.\n\nSet in Madrid in 1960, Un franco, 14 pesetas narrates the story of Martín, a middle-aged Spaniard living in his parents’ basement with his wife Pilar and their son Pablo. Surplus to requirements at his place of work, Martín loses his job. When Martín’s friend Marcos suggests they emigrate to Switzerland in search of work, Pilar – who is desperate for her family to have a home of their own – encourages him to do so. The film recounts the trials and tribulations of Martín and Marcos as they travel to Switzerland in search of a better future for them and their families. Focused on the bromance between Martín and Marcos, Un franco, 14 pesetas is thus a road movie of sorts, set in the historical context of Spanish emigration.\n\nWhile Un franco, 14 pesetas is not without its problems – it is, at least in some ways, akin to the nostalgic revisioning of the past as seen in films such as Belle époque and La lengua de las mariposas – the visual vocabulary deployed in the film resonates not only with other Spanish films that deal with immigration, emigration and exile, but, also beyond the Spanish context, with diasporic or ‘accented’ cinema, to use Hamid Naficy’s term, and with the Hollywood road movie. The most obvious motif in this regard is vehicles and transportation. For Naficy, the vehicle constitutes one of several ‘important transitional and transnational places and spaces’ in accented works.[ii] He considers vehicles ‘privileged sites’ in terms of ‘journeys of and struggles over identity’, given that makers of accented cinema ‘engage in many deterritorializing and reterritorializing journeys […] including home-seeking journeys, journeys of homelessness, and homecoming journeys’.[iii]\n\nIn Un franco, 14 pesetas, the protagonists travel by train from Spain to Switzerland. A frantic sequence on the platform of the railway station shows the emotional farewells of Martín and Marcos to their respective loved ones, before the film depicts in considerable detail their transit across Europe. They are shown sleeping in their compartment alongside several other men when officials enter and demand identification from all the passengers (Figure 1). Martín is depicted contemplating the passing landscape from the window of the train (Figure 2). They are shown befriending another Spaniard who shares his chorizo with them (Figure 3). The use of dissolves to transition between images (Figure 4) echoes both the passing of time and the passing landscapes, visible from the train carriage window.\n\nThe aforementioned bromance between Martín and Marcos is another trope that links Un franco, 14 pesetas to cinematic works of migration, movement and mobility. Indeed, the film resonates, in some ways, with the Hollywood road movie, so many of which are, as Julian Stringer observes, ‘same-sex buddy films’.[iv] Having arrived in Switzerland, Martín and Marcos initially share a hotel room. The film emphasises their blossoming bromance by frequently depicting them in their adjoining beds (Figure 5). At one point, they even snuggle closer together so as to keep warm in Switzerland’s frosty climate, to which they are unaccustomed (Figure 6). When Marcos is invited to spend Christmas with one of the Swiss girls they have befriended, leaving Martín alone, their reunion is depicted as a pseudo-romantic encounter. Marcos hurls snowballs at the window of Martín’s hotel room, leading to the resolution of their earlier conflict. Reminiscent of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, Martín appears at the window (Figure 7), addressed by Marcos below (Figure 8), as the pair resolve their differences.\n\nThe window constitutes a key visual motif in Un franco, 14 pesetas. The characters are frequently framed by windows within the filmic frame, as in Figures 2 and 7 above. This gesture carries several symbolic resonances. While many of Naficy’s examples describe scenes that feature windows, he does not expand upon the potential symbolic significance of this icon.[v] Here, the window functions as a reminder of these characters’ liminality, evidencing their status as outsiders looking in on a society of which they are, at least initially, not a part. This sentiment applies not just to their status in Swiss society but also in Spanish society upon their return to Madrid, a sentiment echoed by Marcos’ wife Maricarmen who declares, towards the end of the film, that ‘Ya no somos de ninguna parte’ (‘We are now from nowhere’).\n\nThe window as a visual symbol is something I’m only just beginning to think through in my research. Having recently completed my doctoral thesis, I am beginning to work on a post-doctoral project that examines the concepts of (in)visibility and (dis)location in visual representations of Ceuta, Melilla and Gibraltar. In the very early research I’ve conducted for this project, I’ve noticed that the symbol of the window is visually significant within these contentious border sites, a figure for the physical flimsiness of the border and a counterpoint to the lack of transparency at work within such liminal border spaces. A case in point is the Telecinco television series El Príncipe (Figure 9). Any thoughts on this would be very much appreciated, so please feel free to comment below.\n\nTo conclude, while Un franco, 14 pesetas is perhaps not the most imaginative or visually striking depiction of Spanish emigration, the film engages with other works pertinent to this topic through its network of visual symbols, such as train travel and windows, as well as through narrative tropes, such as the bromance or buddy relationship often at the core of the road movie. I hope to post on Iglesias’ other works in the near future as his work is exemplary of the cinematic swing towards migratory patterns away from Spain. While immigration from other countries to Spain represents one of the most dominant political themes of Spanish cinematic production from the 1990s until the early 2010s, the current economic crisis and its provocation of a shift in migratory patterns have diminished the prevalence and significance of this topic in the context of the most contemporary releases of Spanish cinema. A quick glance at the subject matter of recent works reveals that Spanish cinema is turning its attention to another crucial migratory flow relevant to contemporary Spain: the rising number of individuals leaving Spain, whether these are immigrants returning home due to the lack of opportunities resulting from the aforementioned economic crisis, or Spanish professionals unable to find employment in their own country. This trend is inspiring filmmakers across diverse genres. Recent releases include: Perdiendo el norte (Velilla, 2015), a comedy which focuses on two young men with degrees who cannot find work in Spain and so emigrate to Germany; En tierra extraña (Bollaín, 2014), a documentary which follows young Spaniards abroad in search of a better future and El rayo (Araújo, 2013), a road movie which follows Hassan, a Moroccan immigrant who, unable to find work, decides to return home after thirteen years in Spain. What this emerging cinematic trend reveals is the need for further examination of the migratory dynamics explored in contemporary cultural production in Spain, an example of which is Iglesias’ filmography.\n\nNotes\n\n[i] Biutiful also engages with the dynamics of internal migration. Protagonist Uxbal (Javier Bardem) is a xarnego/charnego, a term used in Catalonia to refer to migrants from other areas of Spain. Director Iñárritu discusses this aspect of the film in the notes accompanying the film at the Cannes Film Festival, available here.\n\n[ii] Naficy, Hamid.

I’ve had the DVD for a while, and I’ve been looking forward to watching it. The film won the 2014 Goya for Best Newcomer for Javier Pereira, and was nominated for Best Director and Best Actress. I can’t remember now where I first heard/read about it, although it was most likely on Twitter. There were two aspects of the film I found particularly intriguing: firstly, the fact that the film was crowd-funded, and secondly, the much-discussed ‘twist’ halfway through the film. It more than lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe film’s financial profile is particularly relevant, given the dire economic climate in Spain generally, and with regards to the film industry in particular. I’ll offer a brief overview of the scenario here. State funding of Spanish cinema has halved in the past four years, with the most recent budget cuts (October 2013) meaning that the national cinematography fund will receive only €33 million (£28m) in 2014. This constitutes a 14% drop on last year, and is only just enough to cover the industry’s debts. These cuts have been described as politically-motivated by, among others, Enrique González Macho, President of the Spanish Cinema Academy, who has remarked that this represents the extent to which the current PP government are scared of the culture and cinema, and their potential for change and impact. These cuts have significantly affected the amount of films being made in Spain. Indeed, 2013 saw 28% fewer films in production, and, consequently, enforced unemployment. To add to this, VAT on ticket sales has risen to 21% in Spain. (You can read more about this here.)\n\nAgainst this dismal financial backdrop, the producers of Stockholm turned to the crowd-funding website Verkami to secure funds to complete their film. The DVD includes a press conference, in which one of the producers talks about their move from the more creative side of filmmaking to the financial side as a necessity because the various sites in which they would usually seek funding had closed down. The credits list all of the Verkami contributors, in a gesture that underscores the value of their contribution to the project and acknowledges that contribution as part of the labour through which the film was produced.\n\nAlongside the film’s alternative path to funding, the second element I was initially intrigued by was the much-discussed ‘twist’ halfway through the film. Stockholm begins as a very conventional teenage/youth scenario, in which boy meets girl and claims to be in love with her. While she initially resists his advances, they spend the entire night walking around the city, until eventually they end up back in his apartment. And this is where the twist occurs – which I won’t reveal in order to avoid any spoilers for those who are still to watch the film (and I recommend that you do!). Suffice to say, this twist constitutes a moment of rupture that splits the film in half, separating the initial, conventional ‘boy-meets-girl’ narrative of the first half from the tense, dramatic, second half of the film, which is more akin to the thriller than the romance genre.\n\nThe film’s aesthetics constitute a site in which these two intriguing aspects of the work converge. Because of its modest budget, Stockholmwas filmed in just twelve days. The limited funds, and thus time, available led to a strikingly minimalist aesthetic. Indeed, the majority of the film’s action takes place on the streets of Madrid at night in the first half, and within the apartment of the unnamed male protagonist (known as ‘Él’ (‘He’) in the script) in the second half of the film. This split between an exterior and an interior location mirrors the narrative and genre split between the two halves of the film. This is further underscored by the colour palette of both halves. Darkness, at times tinged with accented red and blue lighting, dominates the first half, symbolising intrigue, the unknown, and the excitement connected with these qualities. By contrast, a stark, bleached whiteness overwhelms the second half, signifying the cold, harsh truth the characters face the morning after their night together. These diverging aesthetic approaches produce a fissure in the texture of the film, a fissure embodied by the unnamed female protagonist (known as ‘Ella’) quite literally in the colours of the clothing she wears: a black cardigan over a white dress.\n\nAll in all, this is a striking film, aesthetically pleasing, with an engrossing soundtrack, and displaying incredible performances by both lead actors. Highly recommended!\n\nLast week I attended the Spanish Cinema Symposium with Icíar Bollaín at the University of St. Andrews. I was very much looking forward to the event, not least because it allowed me to escape my huge pile of marking for the day! I did live-tweet throughout the day, but I found that I was unable to keep up with the demands of live-tweeting and note-taking. I decided to write up my notes into this blog post, for those who were following my tweets and were interested to learn more about the day’s proceedings.\n\nAfter a brief welcome and introduction by St. Andrews’ own Bernard Bentley, the day kicked off with Professor Núria Triana Toribio (University of Kent), and her presentation entitled ‘Cine es pañal: Spanish “Realismo Social” and Icíar Bollaín’s Mataharis’. Triana began by noting that Bollaín positions herself, and is positioned by critics, as part of a European realist tradition, before arguing that Mataharis constitutes a moment of rupture within this framework. In an inspired reading of the opening credits, Triana argued that the image in which one of the female detectives changes her baby’s nappy (hence the talk’s title, ‘Cine es pañal’ (nappy)) represents a dramatic shift both in terms of Bollaín’s filmmaking, and within the wider context of Spanish cinema. In the context of Bollaín’s oeuvre, this moment, and more generally this film, marks a departure from the social realist tradition of which she is a part. For Triana, the inclusion of this nappy-changing moment indicates a turn to the quotidian, in comparison with the filmmaker’s earlier focus on the ‘big topics’ or ‘headlines’ of social realism: the depiction of immigration and social integration in Flores de otro mundo (1999) and the treatment of domestic violence in Te doy mis ojos (2003) are examples of this earlier trend. With regards Spanish cinema more broadly, Mataharis’ reworking of the film noir genre is demonstrative of the turn to genre in 2008. Triana traced this turn to genre in Spanish cinema through a series of changes at the level of practice within the Spanish film industry, including television companies venturing into film funding, El Orfanato – a horror film – winning the Goya for Best Film, and the realisation that genre allowed filmmakers to speak to both national and international audiences. She concluded her talk by comparing detective Eva (Najwa Nimri) and her return to work – which can only occur once she has run the bath, organised dinner, and settled the children – with Jeff’s return to work in Out of the Past (1947) – which occurs after a dramatic revelation and passionate encounter with the lady in his life. With this comparison, Triana demonstrated her thesis: that Bollaín’s Mataharis reworks genre/gender with a focus on everyday realism.\n\nAfter a brief break for coffee and cakes (which were delicious!), Dr. David Archibald (University of Glasgow) offered a presentation on the topic of ‘Cinematic Representations of Anti-Fascist Women in the Spanish Civil War’. He focused on representations of women fighting – or not – in the Spanish Civil War, and how this concept is treated in different cinemas. His presentation offered a survey of diverse films and their depictions of women in the Spanish Civil War context, including For Whom the Bell Tolls (Wood, 1943), El árbol de Guernica (Arrabal, 1975), ¡Ay, Carmela! (Saura, 1990), and Libertarias (Aranda, 1996). He then turned his attentions to Tierra y libertad (Loach, 1995), starring Bollaín, arguing that this film illustrates the complexities of the female figure at the front. For Archibald, Bollaín’s character is politically aware but also displays warmth, solidarity, and compassion with her comrades. However, he acknowledged the film’s limitations in terms of the representation of women in conflict, given the symbolic use of the female body through the character of Blanca, who is shot in the back precisely at the moment in which the POUM are betrayed. Overall, Archibald’s paper offered an overview of how leftist women have been differently depicted across distinct geographical and historical contexts.\n\nFollowing a break for lunch, we returned for a screening of También la lluvia, introduced by the director herself. I have seen the film a number of times, but it was such a pleasure to see it on a big screen again. It contains a number of actors I enjoy watching (Tosar, Bernal, Arevalo), and I find the metacinematic dimension of the film really interesting. I am not going to spend time unpacking the film in any more detail here (perhaps a future blog post in that…). But I wanted to at least mention this element of the programme, because I think it was an inspired decision. Not only did it allow the audience to relax after lunch (always a sleepy moment in the day for me!), but it also provided fodder for the question-and-answer session that followed.\n\nAfter the film had finished, we had another quick coffee and cake break before the Q and A session with Bollaín. Bernard Bentley collected questions from the audience and wrote them on the board. Bollaín offered responses to most of the questions raised, talking openly and articulately about her life and work. She began by discussing why she wanted to become a filmmaker as a means of telling her own stories, noting that it stemmed from her career as an actress, in which she felt that she was a vehicle for someone else’s story. She spoke in detail about the process of script-writing, about how she prefers to work with a co-scriptwriter rather than on her own, about how she spends a lot of time researching the topic she is working on in the film. She stressed the need for more female authors in the film industry, noting the male bias which persists even in the contemporary context. Picking up on Núria Triana Toribio’s earlier presentation, she discussed the motivation behind Mataharis, which reflects her life at the time of production – in which she was dealing with babies and nappies, juggling work and motherhood. For Bollaín, this film represented what was missing from the big screen: representations of women in their 30s, simply dealing with everyday life. She was also asked about her methodologies when working with different actors, detailing her recent forays into working with non-professional actors (in También la lluvía and Katmandú, un espejo en el cielo (2011) in particular), and praising an actor with whom she has worked several times: Luis Tosar. The conversation was frequently punctuated with clips from Bollaín’s oeuvre, including the very amusing short (featuring the aforementioned Tosar) ‘Por tu bien’ (which you can watch here – and you should – it is very funny!).\n\nIn addition, Bollaín also spent a considerable amount of time speaking about the creative processes of filmmaking. She noted that she loves editing, finding it the most creative part of filmmaking (other than the writing of the script). In a lovely metaphor, she compared it to going to the market to get the ingredients you need, but it is when you start editing that you start cooking. She also commented that she always changes the endings of her films during the editing process. She spoke at length about the procedures they had to follow in Bolivia when making También la lluvía, including going to the local assemblies to ask permissions, having to provide materials for the local communicates and so on. Finally, she spoke about her current project, which is a documentary about Spanish people, with qualifications, leaving Spain and working in menial jobs in other countries. She stressed a desire to convey the reality of their situations, which is at odds with how Spanish politicians portray their circumstances, in that they insist that these people have made decisions to better/further their careers and so on. She also noted that she will be filming another script written by Paul Laverty – who wrote the script for También la lluvía – next year. As a closing remark, she observed that she is impressed by the way academics dedicate themselves to film.\n\nAll in all, this was a highly enjoyable, successful event, and a real pleasure to attend!\n\nAs I’ve previously mentioned on this blog, one of the chapters of my PhD thesis explores the figure of the child in post-Franco Spanish cinema. Given the diffuseness of this subject matter, and the relative gap in terms of scholarship on the child in Spanish cinema (Sarah Wright’s recently-published monograph The Child in Spanish Cinema is the first book-length study of this topic), I narrowed the focus of my chapter to the intersection of childhood and history in four key films: El espíritu de la colmena/The Spirit of the Beehive (Víctor Erice, 1973); Cría cuervos/Raise Ravens (Carlos Saura, 1976); El espinazo del diablo/The Devil’s Backbone (Guillermo del Toro, 2001); and El laberinto del fauno/Pan’s Labyrinth (Guillermo del Toro, 2006). This term I’ve suspended my PhD studies to take up a temporary Teaching Fellowship in the department of Film & Visual Culture at my institution, and have had the opportunity to teach an Honours module based on my PhD research. As a result, I’ve recently rewatched three of the above films (Espíritu; Cría; Laberinto) with my Honours students, and in so doing, my curiosity in the visual rhetoric that circulates amongst these films was renewed.\n\nThe most recent of the three films – El laberinto del fauno – repeatedly and explicitly engages the previous two films through visual citations. Clearly, the films are narratively and thematically comparable in that they all deal with the child’s escape into fantasy, imagination, and fairytale, with death, and with the politics of the Civil War and Francoist Spain. However, this post focuses on the implicit visual connections between the films. I’m certainly not the first scholar to point out that the later film references the earlier two films – see, for example, this piece by Paul Julian Smith. That said, I think the parallels are worth restating because they reveal the extent to which Mexican director del Toro inserts his film within a specifically Spanish history of cinematic childhood.\n\nIndeed, within the first few minutes of the film, El laberinto del fauno visually cites both Cría cuervos and El espíritu de la colmena. The car in which protagonist Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) stops so that the latter can get some fresh air. As Carmen composes herself, Ofelia wanders off into the woods, looking up at the trees above her. The point-of-view shot recalls a moment in Cría cuervos when Ana (Ana Torrent) looks up at the trees in her garden, before she sees/imagines herself leaping off the roof of a nearby building.\n\nThis is followed by a reference to the Don José sequence in El espíritu de la colmena, when the young Ana (Ana Torrent) grants the class mannequin the ability to see by attaching his eyes. In place of a mannequin, Ofelia encounters a stone statue, and inserts a round stone, which she finds on the ground nearby, into the open eye socket.\n\nMoreover, the Falangist symbol of the yoke and arrows, which adorns the cars in which Ofelia and her mother travel, constitutes a further visual reference to Erice’s film, in which the same symbol appears on a building of the village Hoyuelos in the opening sequence.\n\nThese visual citations appear throughout El laberinto del fauno. For instance, the Captain is repeatedly pictured shaving in his quarters – an act which reminds us of the playful moment in El espíritu de la colmena when, in the absence of their father, Isabel (Isabel Tellería) instructs her younger sister Ana how to shave. Similarly, the mud-encrusted Ofelia’s emergence from the tree, having completed her first task, recalls the mournful Ana and her mud beard in Cría cuervos.\n\nFurthermore, the bearded doctor of El laberinto del fauno recalls the bearded doctor, who, at the end of El espíritu de la colmena, insists that Ana will recover from her traumatic experiences. In addition, the monstrousness of maternity embodied by Ofelia’s mother Carmen in El laberinto del fauno resonates with María’s cancerous womb in Cría cuervos. This link is underscored by the visual echoes between the scene in which Carmen gives birth to Ofelia’s baby brother in El laberinto del fauno, with women bustling around with bloodied sheets, and the scene in which María is dying in Cría cuervos, where the maid Rosa acts as a nurse, removing bloodied sheets from the bed. The significances of these visual citations are tied up with gender, a theme which has, for the most part, not yet been analysed in detail, and this is precisely one of the themes I investigate in my thesis.\n\nA handful of visual citations concerned with death, devastation, and destruction also link the three films in question. Vidal’s broken pocket watch recalls Fernando’s pocket watch in El espíritu de la colmena. Its unreliability, combined with the careful attention the Captain affords to its cleaning, demonstrates an obsessive concern with order and precision that is destined to fail. The train wreck caused by the maquis in El laberinto del fauno reminds the viewer of the symbolic importance of the train in El espíritu de la colmena. The train’s derailment in the later film constitutes a symbol of how progress was brought to a halt under Franco. The burial of Ofelia’s mother, who dies during childbirth, recalls the proliferation of death in general across these films, but also more specifically Ana’s isolated ceremony of mourning for her guinea pig Roni in Cría cuervos. Finally, Ofelia drugs the Captain by spiking his drink, implicitly referencing Ana’s attempts to poison her father and aunt by lacing their drinks with what she believes to be poisonous powder in Cría cuervos.\n\nClearly, the resonances between these films extend beyond what I’ve pointed out in this short post. However, what I hope to have demonstrated here is that El laberinto del fauno, in spite of its transnational production history (directed by a Mexican filmmaker, starring both Spanish and Latin American actors and actresses, financed by both Spanish and Mexican production companies), is positioned within a lineage of Spanish films centred on the intersection of childhood and history. In my thesis, as mentioned above, I dedicate a chapter to the exploration of these three films in conjunction with El espinazo del diablo. As I’m still working towards the completion of my thesis, any thoughts, pointers, comments are most welcome on what I’ve presented here.\n\nThis discussion between myself and Niamh Thornton took place through Skype instant messages on Friday 7th February. Our aim with this conversation was to expand on our previous blog posts.\n\n[09:42:41] Niamh: In your blog I was really interested in the shared use of the media as a motif. In Pacific Rim TV news is used as a form of commentary and economical mode of storytelling. In Bordertown and the Virgin of Juarez the female protagonists are both journalists.\n\n[09:45:12] Fiona Noble: It’s really striking that this is a feature shared by the films we are both working on – and I don’t think that this is exclusive to these films.\n\n[09:45:43] Niamh: Do you think that it’s about telling stories about disenfranchised others in the films you are writing about?\n\n[09:46:14] Fiona Noble: I can think of other examples in the Spanish context which include media reporting/representation as a visual motif – Las cartas de Alou springs immediately to mind but there are many others.\n\n[09:47:29] Fiona Noble: Yes, I think on the one hand there is as you say the need to tell the other’s story.\n\n[09:47:38] Niamh: In films and literature about Juarez it is a repeated trope. Frequently, they are journalists from outside (US, Spain, UK…).\n\n[09:48:23] Fiona Noble: So, it is the external other who tells the story, who has the voice?\n\n[09:48:54] Niamh: Yes, and the power to go above the local strictures.\n\n[09:49:42] Fiona Noble: I think this provides a point of contrast then between the films/contexts we are working with – it is usually the Spanish characters who are journalists in the films I’m working on.\n\n[09:49:58] Niamh: There is an important Mexican female journalist character (likely based on a real individual) in Bordertown who provides valuable information. But, the film is still focused on an Other as victim.\n\n[09:50:43] Fiona Noble: Ilegal is the perfect example of this – protagonists Luis and Sofia are a journalist and private inspector, respectively. The plot places them in a position similar to that of an illegal immigrant, and so seems to expect us to empathise.\n\n[09:51:28] Niamh: Is the assumption that we wouldn’t empathise if we followed the story of one of migrants?\n\n[09:51:55] Fiona Noble: It seems that way – at least that is how the film has been read by others (i.e. Santiago Fouz Hernandez).\n\n[09:52:36] Niamh: There are films that do take that position, though. Is that not the case?\n\n[09:52:57] Fiona Noble: A more empathetic/sympathetic portrait of immigrant experience, you mean?\n\n[09:53:12] Niamh: A more subjective one\n\n[09:53:32] Fiona Noble: Yes, I think that’s what I was trying to map out in my original post.\n\n[09:54:03] Fiona Noble: Ilegal is now ten years old – the more recent Retorno a Hansala seems to gesture towards a more subjective representation of immigrant experience.\n\n[09:54:35] Niamh: Do you think that this trope of outsider experiencing/witnessing these events is successful?\n\n[09:55:01] Fiona Noble: I think it can be.\n\n[09:55:24] Fiona Noble: In the Spanish case, most films about immigrants/immigration are not made by those who have direct experience of this phenomenon (Santiago Zannou is the only director I know of who is a second-generation Spaniard, whose parents were African immigrants). So, I think to have this outsider framework can show a certain degree of respect for the distance between director/production team and topic.\n\n[09:56:39] Niamh: Necessarily?\n\n[09:56:54] Fiona Noble: That said, I think it can also be an extremely risky strategy – as in Ilegal where the immigrants are mere secondary characters, barely glimpsed in the background, while the Spanish protagonists take centre stage. What are your thoughts on this? How does it play out in the films you are working on?\n\n[10:01:45] Niamh: I agree. That is often the case with Juarez. In the films on Juarez the victims are often multiply marked as others: working class, indigenous, country girls vs urban, cosmopolitan, middle class journalists. Also, the victims are to be read as “good” victims i.e. religious (sometimes to the point of superstition), virginal and innocent. They have none of the messiness of “bad” behaviour of real life. How does that play in terms of the immigrants you consider?\n\n[10:06:32] Fiona Noble: It varies. In Ilegal we are offered next to no information about the immigrants who are the victims of persecution/ill treatment/death. They are illegal immigrants who are smuggled into the country. This is all we know. Retorno takes a slightly different approach: it begins with an unidentified illegal immigrant drowning. The film then follows legal Moroccan immigrant Leila and her attempt to come to terms with the death of her brother Rachid while attempting to make the crossing to Spain from Morocco.\n\n[10:08:51] Niamh: In both films about Juarez the women survive being left for dead and arise from the grave in ways that are reminiscent of horror films.\n\n[10:09:59] Fiona Noble: And, is it indicated that their “good” characters has something to do with their survival? Is this a sort of triumph over evil?\n\n[10:11:26] Niamh: It does appear to be. They are deserving of re-birth/second chance. But, their “goodness” and naïveté means that they must be protected by these stronger US women.\n\n[10:12:13] Fiona Noble: So, we’re back into the hegemonic conceptualisations of self/other that we spoke about before.\n\n[10:12:30] Niamh: Yes, no doubt. I suppose, now the question arises whether we are comparing like with like? Is there something unique about the migrant story and its tropes and can we talk about violence and its ethics alongside films about other themes? That being said, the border looms large in the Juarez film and there is some crossing of it by the privileged journalist and the victims. This might take us back to thinking about violence and how we write about its representation on screen. Can we have common strategies when writing about violence?\n\n[10:16:08] Fiona Noble: I think this is an excellent point – one of the things I’ve been thinking about in response to our dialogue has been about the cultural specificity of violence. In your post you talked about having to make ‘multidisciplinary borrowings’, and, I wonder, to what extent we can compare the films/contexts we are working on?\n\n[10:18:33] Niamh: Considerably, it would seem. But, also, it’s necessary to return to context and specifics.\n\n[10:19:43] Fiona Noble: It certainly seems that our films share a similar visual grammar.\n\n[10:20:39] Niamh: Yes. It can be useful to have tools from other contexts to use. Do you think that Spanish filmmakers pay much attention to the Mexican-US border narrative?\n\n[10:21:33] Fiona Noble: That’s a really interesting point. Off the top of my head, I can’t think of any specific examples where other border discourses come into play in Spanish films about immigrants/immigration.\n\n[10:22:18] Niamh: I suppose it’s difficult to tell unless a filmmaker expressly lays claims to influences.\n\n[10:22:41] Fiona Noble: I guess. The example that springs to mind is Inarritu’s Biutiful.\n\n[10:23:15] Fiona Noble: This film does situate contemporary immigration in Spain within a wider, global context. Although the link to Mexico is more historical than current – indexing Republican exile to Mexico in Spanish Civil War through Uxbal’s father.\n\n[10:24:25] Niamh: Yes. There is that film which has 3 stories: one in Mexico-US, the other in Cuba and the third in Morocco. I can’t remember the name.\n\n[10:24:39] Fiona Noble: Babel?\n\n[10:25:27] Niamh: No. But that is an interesting example of the wider context and linked global experiences\n\n[10:26:05] Fiona Noble: I’m not sure of the one you mean.\n\n[10:26:28] Fiona Noble: But, it sounds like it would be an interesting one for both of us.\n\n[10:27:29] Niamh: Just found it online, Al otro lado. Yes, because one of the stories is about a child going from Morocco to Spain. All of the migrants are young children and therefore necessarily sympathetic.\n\n[10:28:05] Fiona Noble: Title sounds familiar – will check it out. I wonder if there’s a distinction to be made when events are based largely/primarily on fictional narratives (Pacific Rim) and when they are based on real events (such as the Juarez films). How does the treatment of violence differ in these contexts? You did talk about this in your post, but I wondered if we should elaborate on this.\n\n[10:29:16] Niamh: It’s interesting because the distinction is about intention, but not necessarily about visual grammar. For example, Pacific Rim is very deliberately about spectacle in a way that would be tasteless if it were about a real event.\n\nThe violence inflicted on the women in Bordertown, for example, is ridiculous, because it seems that the director fails in making it convincing although his intention is to be sensitive. In the key attempted murder scene the woman is being strangled by a man who is raping her. He has his face contorted in ways that are exaggeratedly grotesque, while her face is acting “real” anguish. The problem is that a woman’s body on screen is always already objectified, so in an attempt to avoid this we are shown the violence either in long shot or the camera lingers on her pained and tearful face, and his grotesque expression, but the contrast between their performative styles in this one is jarring. Consequently, for me, it is unsuccessful.\n\n[10:36:07] Fiona Noble: Which brings us back to the points you made at the beginning of your original post – about the difficulty of representing/writing about onscreen violence. That is, in spite of its prevalence.\n\n[10:37:27] Niamh: Yes. Do we have new conclusions from today’s discussion, I wonder?\n\n[10:37:45] Fiona Noble: Or more questions?\n\n[10:38:15] Fiona Noble: I think we have ascertained that the films we are working on, in spite of their distinct production contexts/subject matters, share a certain visual grammar.\n\n[10:38:18] Niamh: Which can be more productive in ways…\n\n[10:38:28] Fiona Noble: Absolutely.\n\n[10:38:57] Niamh: This is true. Also, we are still convinced that multiple tools are required to analyse these. Context can never be forgotten, but should not limit comparisons.\n\n[10:39:41] Fiona Noble: I agree. And, we’ve also talked about the relationship between subjectivity and mass media across the distinct contexts, and the various possibilities/problems that this framework offers.\n\n[10:40:39] Niamh: All worthwhile. It’s been good chatting about this. I certainly find it useful to know the commonalities and differences.\n\n[10:42:51] Fiona Noble: I completely agree. Much definitely remains to be said not only about the complexities of representing violence onscreen, but also about scholarly approaches to the topic. The fodder of future blog posts and Twitter exchanges, I’m sure.\n\nAs I’ve previously mentioned on this blog, one of the chapters of my PhD thesis considers the representation of the immigrant in contemporary Spanish cinema, with particular emphasis on the theme of death. The prevalence of death in Spanish films that take immigration as their focus of course represents a particular reality: specifically the very real threat of death faced daily by immigrants, whether in transit, due to poor living and working conditions, or because of xenophobic violence. In the context of Spanish cinema, these issues have been diversely represented in films such as 14 Kilómetros/14 Kilometres (Gerardo Olivares, 2007), Malas temporadas/Hard Times (Manuel Martín Cuenca, 2005), Las cartas de Alou/Alou’s Letters (Montxo Armendáriz, 1990), Bwana (Imanol Uribe, 1996), Taxi (Carlos Saura, 1995), and Salvajes/Savages (Carlos Molinero, 2001). Beyond this significance, my investigation of the intersection of immigration and death in contemporary Spanish cinema is conceptually motivated, addressing both the aesthetics and ethics of the cinematic representation of the death of the immigrant other. In this post, inspired by Niamh Thornton’s recent meditation on the ethics of the use of war photography in fiction film, I consider the aesthetic and ethical implications of the representation of the death of the immigrant in two films: Ilegal/Illegal (Ignacio Vilar, 2003) and Retorno a Hansala/Return to Hansala (Chus Gutiérrez, 2008).\n\nAt the crux of this constellation of ideas – immigration, death, and cinema – is the notion of visibility, of making visible. As phenomena that prove problematic at the level of rendering visible, how are immigration and death represented by cinema, a predominantly visual medium? How do immigration and death intersect on screen? How are they made (in)visible? Recent theoretical interventions related to this topic include Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s concept of a ‘subjectivity of the dying’ (Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity 173), and Emma Wilson’s exploration of art and culture as a space for the exploration of death and its meanings (Love, Mortality and the Moving Image). A gap remains, however, in terms of the specificities of these issues in the context of immigration and race. This post is a mere starting point for thinking about these questions.\n\nThe metafilmic credit sequence of Ilegal immediately underscores the question of the visibility of the immigrant and of death. A black and white image depicts ocean waves washing over various items of clothing, soaked through and strewn haphazardly on the sand, abandoned on an unidentified shoreline. In a metacinematic gesture, the image is presented as though seen through the lens of a video camera, encased by a circular black frame and edged with textual indicators, such as a battery meter, a flashing red recording light, and the date. The camera continues recording, encountering an abandoned boat, flooded with seawater and filled with more discarded items, an eerie intimation that something tragic has occurred. This reading is supported by the scene’s tense, melodramatic soundtrack. The film’s opening sequence implies, but does not make visible, the death of the immigrant.\n\nStill taken from Ilegal\n\nThe camera through which these images are presented belongs to journalist Luis, the film’s central character. The focalisation of the image through the journalist’s camera establishes a hierarchical paradigm of looking, in which the Spaniard looks and the immigrant is looked at, that will pervade the film. This paradigm is intensified by the spectator’s alignment with the film’s journalist protagonist. The metafilmic opening described above not only encourages the spectator’s identification with the Spaniard rather than with the film’s many migrant characters, but also reinforces the immigrant’s positioning as the object of the gaze. The fact that the immigrant is only an implied presence in this sequence can be read as a critique of journalistic and mass media representations of immigrants and immigration. Such representations often disregard the individuals involved, and tend to be more concerned with the totalling of casualties or with creating paranoia around the notion of an uncontrollable flood of immigrants. In this way, Ilegal’s opening sequence immediately foregrounds the visibility of both immigration and death as a challenge to visual media such as film.\n\nIn spite of this stimulating credit sequence that draws attention to the aesthetics and ethics of the representation of the death in the context of immigration, Ilegal is at risk of repeating and perpetuating this approach, given its narrative and visual focus on the plight of its two Spanish protagonists, Luis and Sofia. As Santiago Fouz Hernández and Alfredo Martínez Expósito point out, Luis in particular ‘has no qualms about obtaining and then exploiting images of migrants against their will’ (Live Flesh: The Male Body in Contemporary Spanish Cinema 171). His dubious motives thus call into question the seemingly cautious, evocative and ethically-driven credit sequence described above. The film becomes even more problematic at its conclusion, when Luis decides that the images he has captured have provoked too many deaths; because of this, he launches the tapes into the sea. A tracking shot of the tapes floating in the water before they land on the seabed provides the background image of the film’s closing credits. Like its opening sequence, Ilegal’s final images replace the immigrant with a visual remainder of his/her existence, erasing not only the body of the immigrant, but also the visual traces of that body. In sum, the aesthetics and ethics of Ilegal’s representation of the death of the immigrant opens up, even if the film ultimately falls short of addressing, pertinent questions concerning the visibility and visibilisation of this phenomenon.\n\nLike Ilegal, the opening sequence of Retorno a Hansala immediately addresses the visual representation of the death of the immigrant. The sequence depicts the death of an anonymous, unidentified immigrant, who drowns while in sight of the Spanish coastline. Accompanied by the choking sounds of the individual in question, the camera takes on the perspective of the drowning immigrant, dramatically circling above and below the water, and eventually becoming submerged below the water level. The sequence ends with images of the seabed, the ripples of the water dabbled with sunlight. The film’s title appears in white text, superimposed over this image of the seabed. The text dissolves, and the image fades to black.\n\nStill taken from Retorno a Hansala\n\nBy aligning the camera with the perspective of the dying immigrant, and in so doing opening up a space for the articulation of a ‘subjectivity of the dying’ (Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Touching Feeling 173), Retorno a Hansala undermines the aforementioned paradigm of looking established in Ilegal, whereby the immigrant is always situated as the object of the gaze. The visual prioritisation of the dying immigrant’s point of view prefigures the film’s narrative focus on Leila (Farah Hamed), a Moroccan immigrant who has been living in Spain for five years. As the title suggests, the film tracks Leila’s return journey to her home town of Hansala, the purpose of which is the repatriation of her younger brother’s body. Unlike Leila, Rachid was unsuccessful in his attempt to make the crossing from North Africa to Southern Spain. In comparison with Ilegal, Retorno a Hansala thus approaches a more ethical account of immigrant experience, and particularly of the representation of the death of the immigrant. That said, the problem of visibility remains insofar as the identity of the dying immigrant remains undisclosed, although it would not be too much of a stretch to surmise that this opening sequence adopts the perspective of Leila’s brother Rachid, whose lifeless body washes ashore in the sequence immediately following the credits.\n\nThe closing credits of Retorno a Hansala, which are rendered in white text on a black background, and accompanied by the sound of waves crashing ashore, distance the film from journalistic and mass media representations concerning immigration. The credits appear on the left-hand side of the frame, while a series of over-exposed photographs, presumably of immigrants although the contents are difficult to establish, fade in and out one by one. An avalanche of words and numbers follow these images, reminiscent of the vocabulary used in journalistic reporting regarding immigration, and of the incessant tallying of immigrants, whether in terms of the number of foreigners living in the country, or in terms of the number who die trying to make the crossing (examples include: ‘a bordo de una patera’ (‘on board a raft’); ‘83 “sin papeles”’ (83 undocumented’); and ‘Trece inmigrantes ahogados’ (‘Thirteen immigrants drowned’)). In this way, the end credits of Retorno bleakly parody media discourse on immigration. In so doing, they indicate a critical self-awareness of the problem of visibility, in terms of both immigration and death, contained within the opening sequence.\n\nAs I said above, this post – which has been written in dialogue with this post by Niamh – is merely a starting point for thinking through extremely complex questions concerning the ethics and aesthetics of onscreen violence and death. In an attempt to continue this thought-provoking and necessary discussion, Niamh and I will follow this post with a conversation about the commonalities and distinctions between the distinct films and contexts we are both working on. In the meantime, any questions, comments, or thoughts are very welcome.\n\nReferences:\n\nFouz-Hernandez, Santiago, and Alfredo Martinez-Exposito.

Both actors had tweeted about the film during the production process and I was particularly struck by the awesome cast: Cámara, Noriega, Ricardo Darín, Eduard Fernández, Jordi Mollà, Alberto San Juan, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Luis Tosar, Cayetana Guillén Cuervo, Candela Peña, Clara Segura, and Leonor Watling. The film was promoted as a comedy centred around a group of male characters, between the ages of 30 and 50. I was interested to see the film due to its focus on masculinity: issues surrounding gender and sexuality have formed part of my research since my Masters year, however my interest in masculinity signals a more recent development in my work. I knew the film was unlikely to be released in UK cinemas so when I spotted the film for a bargain of a price on amazon.es I swiftly purchased it.\n\nUna pistola en cada mano is directed by Cesc Gay, who also directed Krámpack/Nico and Dani (2000), a coming of age narrative that focuses on the sexual awakening, and homoerotic relationship, between two teenage boys. While Una pistola marks a continuation of Gay’s investigation of masculinity, its focus is not teenage boys but rather, as I mentioned above, a group of men aged between 30 and 50 years old. The film is set and filmed in Barcelona, although the city’s iconic buildings and sites are, for the most part, absent from the mise-en-scène. The film is structured around a series of vignettes in which, typically, two characters have a frank discussion about particularly challenging issues they are facing in their lives.\n\nThe first of these vignettes stars Sbaraglia and Fernández. The pair are school friends who have not seen one another in a long time, and their encounter is a chance one, facilitated by E. (Fernández) deciding to take shelter from a heavy rain shower. It becomes evident that neither of the men are particularly content with their lot, and the viewer detects that there is a hint of resentment, at least in terms of J. (Sbaraglia) who insensitively asks about the death of his old friend’s father and who makes a snide remark about not being invited to his wedding.\n\nThe second segment details a conversation between S. (Javier Cámara) and his ex-wife, in which he confesses his love for her – only to be told some surprising news. The scene is at once awkward and moving; this is underscored by Cámara’s appearance as rather rotund and with a receding hairline, in stark contrast to his turn as camp air steward Joserra in Pedro Almodóvar’s most recent production, Los amantes pasajeros/I’m So Excited.\n\nThe third vignette – my favourite – stars Ricardo Darín and Luis Tosar. The two men meet by chance in a park, having met the previous summer while on holiday. G. (Darín) is a little out of sorts because he has followed his wife to her lover’s apartment. He shares the details of his wife’s infidelity with L. (Tosar), who has also recently split with his partner, and the two men debate what G. should do next. The way in which their exchange is filmed – and indeed this applies in some of the other segments – indicates the curious proximity of the two men, in spite of their status as acquaintances; this is underscored by the close-ups of the backs of their heads, side-by-side on the park bench.\n\nThe fourth segment is the most uncomfortable to watch – at least in my opinion. The setting for this encounter is an open-plan office. P. (Eduardo Noriega) approaches Mamen (Candela Peña) as he is leaving and offers her a lift. Attempting – unsuccessfully – to flirt with her, the viewer sympathises with him, interpreting his ineptitude as shyness. However, we quickly learn that he in fact has a wife, and a child. Mamen does not hesitate in teaching him a humiliating lesson.\n\nThe fifth and sixth vignettes are intercut, building up a dialogue between the two couples in each part. María (Leonor Watling) spots A. (Alberto San Juan) and offers him a lift to the party where several of the characters are headed. In the meantime, their partners, Sara (Cayetana Guillén Cuervo) and M. (Jordi Mollà) happen upon one another in a wine shop. Each of the women talk to their partner’s friends about issues that they are struggling with – including domestic violence and erectile dysfunction – meaning that when the two men encounter each other at the party, they are unable to make conversation or even to look one another in their eye.\n\nThe film ends with a short sequence bringing together the majority of the film’s characters at S.’s party. A brief episode involving his neighbour closes the film on a humorous note, only subtly implying the link between the two characters to the viewer.\n\nThe segments solely involving male characters prove the most interesting, at least from my perspective. Those depicting conversations between a male and a female character are notably more awkward, and the dialogue is more serious and less humorous. The film’s focus on middle-aged masculinity reflects, what I see as, a wider cinematic exploration of crises in manhood. Examples of this include Daniel Craig’s ageing James Bond; Andrew Garfield’s uninvincible Spiderman; and Robert Downey Jr’s post-traumatic-stress-suffering Ironman. In Gay’s film, these crises stem mainly from fractured romantic relationships, but involve also the failing bodies and the tortured minds of some of the characters. A link might be traced then between this and other representations of “inadequate” Spanish masculinities in recent years in films such as Los lunes al sol (Fernando León de Aranoa, 2002), which focused on unemployed Galician dock workers, and Mar Adentro (Alejandro Amenábar, 2004), which depicted the story of Ramón Sampedro – a quadriplegic who fought for 26 years for the right to end his life.\n\nOne criticism I would direct at the film is its unique focus on heterosexual men, and its failure to incorporate a homosexual male character. The inclusion of one vignette detailing the choices and problems facing a homosexual man of the same age would have made for an intriguing point of contrast.\n\nIn sum, I would recommend the film for those seeking a light-hearted comedy that is not afraid to tackle sensitive issues.\n\nYesterday I attended the Centre for Sex Gender & Sexualities Summer Workshop at the University of Durham. The theme of the event wasReimagining Gender, Reimagining Sexualities, and the day incorporated two keynote presentations – from Prof. James Messerschmidt on the topic of hegemonic masculinities and from Prof. Wendy Chapkis on gender dynamics in the context of the medical marijuana movement in the US – four parallel research methodology masterclasses, two parallel panel sessions, before a round table discussion to close the workshop.\n\nMyself and two colleagues – Dr. Rebecca Ferreboeuf (Durham) and Dr. Tara Plunkett (Queen’s University, Belfast) co-ordinated a panel for the event entitled Gender in Flux: Re imagining Sexualities in Varied Modes of Cultural Production. The premise of the panel was that cultural production provides a fruitful site for the articulation of alternative gender and sexual identities. Each paper centred on the fluidity, flexibility, malleability and multiplicity that characterises gender and sexuality. Given the diverse subject matter at the heart of each paper, our aim was to consider the extent to which medium specificity impacts upon the expression of gender and sexual identity positions. Our core question was: How can the arts shape new currents of discussing gender and sexual identity?\n\nImage taken from http://manbehindthecurtain.ie/2012/01/28/i-despise-the-dawn/\n\nTara’s paper was entitled Beholders of Beauty: Overcoming the Subject/Object Dichotomy in the Surrealist Self-Portraits of Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington. She focused on two works by each artist, underscoring the complex position they occupied given their engagement with an artistic movement heavily centred on the sexualised female body. This was further complicated by their decision to work primarily with the self-portrait – a genre historically regarded as the domain of the male artist. Tara argued that although adopting distinct approaches, both women succeeded in artistically reflecting on their own sexual identities within the restraints of a typically masculine and misogynist movement and genre.\n\nImage taken from http://www.renaud-bray.com/books_product.aspx?id=179666&def=Mon+corps+et+moi%2CCREVEL%2C+RENE%2C97822530562\n\nRebecca’s paper was entitled ‘Pamphlet against Myself’: René Crevel’s My Body & I. Crevel, the only homosexual writer of the Surrealist group primarily remembered for his premature death by suicide in 1935, was the focus of her paper. She provided close textual analysis of his 1925 text Mon Corps et moi, and utilised contemporary queer theory to illuminate the particularities of the difficulties Crevel faced at the time of writing. She argued that Crevel expresses a conflicted attitude towards the homosexual self, whose identity is not only challenged at the level of the social but also at an individual level.\n\nImage taken from http://celebrities.findthedata.org/l/644/Javier-Bardem\n\nMy paper was entitled Elastic Masculinity: The Fluctuating Gender Identity of Javier Bardem, and considered two films that more or less frame the actor’s career to date: Jamón jamón (Bigas Luna, 1992) and Skyfall (Sam Mendes, 2012). I selected the films for a number of reasons, including their temporal distance from one another, their discrete production contexts, and the distinctiveness of the character played by Bardem in each case in terms of gender and sexual identity: while his character Raúl in Jamón epitomises the ‘macho ibérico’ – attractive, athletic, arrogant – his character Raoul in Skyfallhas certain camp characteristics. My claim was that Bardem, in spite of being associated with a hegemonic masculinity, demonstrates a fluid gender and sexual identity across the distinct roles he has played.\n\nOur panel was followed by an excellent presentation by Durham’s own Santiago Fouz Hernández on Tactile Optics & Erotic Perception in the Recent Films of Bigas Luna. Fouz Hernández’s paper explored the director’s most recent – and sadly his final (he passed away suddenly in April of this year) – works: Yo Soy La Juani (2006) and Di Di Hollywood (2010). His analysis considered the ways in which these films appeal to the senses, echoing and drawing upon recent developments in film theory such as Laura Marks’ haptic visuality, Vivian Sobchack’s phenomenology of film, Patricia MacCormack cinesexuality, and Jennifer Barker’s work on tactility.\n\nOverall, the event provided an interesting forum for discussions centring on sex, gender, and sexualities for scholars spanning the arts and the social sciences. The organisers were able to keep the costs of the event to a minimum – each participant/attendee paid a small fee of £10 – which is crucial for postgraduate and early career researchers (such as myself and my colleagues) who have less and less access to funding. The catering was superb, and although myself and my colleagues were unable to stay, evening entertainment – including a poetry slam – had been organised for all participants. All in all, an inspiring and highly enjoyable event!"
