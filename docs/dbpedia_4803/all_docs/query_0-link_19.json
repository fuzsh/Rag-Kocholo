Report of two cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nGraham, B D; McKinsey, D S; Driks, M R; Smith, D L\n\n1991-02-01\n\nColonic histoplasmosis is a rare entity. There have been four previous reported cases within the population of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Because of the increasing incidence of HIV infection within regions where histoplasmosis is endemic, this condition may become more common. Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis has protean clinical manifestations, and symptoms are often nonspecific. Any patient with HIV infection who has unexplained GI symptoms should undergo evaluation for possible histoplasmosis. Aggressive long-term amphotericin B therapy has been effective in HIV patients with histoplasmosis. Resection or diversion of symptomatic colonic strictures caused by histoplasmosis may be necessary in addition to medical therapy.\n\nHistoplasmosis infections worldwide: thinking outside of the Ohio River valley\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBahr, Nathan C; Antinori, Spinello; Wheat, L. Joseph; Sarosi, George A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn the United States, histoplasmosis is generally thought to occur mainly in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys, and the classic map of histoplasmosis distribution reflecting this is second nature to many U.S. physicians. With the advent of the HIV pandemic reports of patients with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis and AIDS came from regions of known endemicity, as well as from regions not thought to be endemic for histoplasmosis throughout the world. In addition, our expanding armamentarium of immunosuppressive medications and biologics has increased the diagnosis of histoplasmosis worldwide. While our knowledge of areas in which histoplasmosis is endemic has improved, it is still incomplete. Our contention is that physicians should consider histoplasmosis with the right constellations of symptoms in any febrile patient with immune suppression, regardless of geographic location or travel history.

Most experience has been derived from small single center case series, or case report literature reviews. Therefore, a larger study of central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis is needed in order to guide the approach to diagnosis, and treatment. A convenience sample of 77 patients with histoplasmosis infection of the CNS was evaluated. Data was collected that focused on recognition of infection, diagnostic techniques, and outcomes of treatment. Twenty nine percent of patients were not immunosuppressed. Histoplasma antigen, or anti-Histoplasma antibodies were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 75% of patients. One year survival was 75% among patients treated initially with amphotericin B, and was highest with liposomal, or deoxycholate formulations. Mortality was higher in immunocompromised patients, and patients 54 years of age, or older. Six percent of patients relapsed, all of whom had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and were poorly adherent with treatment. While CNS histoplasmosis occurred most often in immunocompromised individuals, a significant proportion of patients were previously, healthy. The diagnosis can be established by antigen, and antibody testing of the CSF, and serum, and antigen testing of the urine in most patients. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (AMB-L) for at least 1 month; followed by itraconazole for at least 1 year, results in survival among the majority of individuals. Patients should be followed for relapse for at least 1 year, after stopping therapy.

This coinfection interferes with prompt diagnosis, and treatment is difficult because of drug interactions. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 14 HIV-infected patients who had concomitant tuberculosis and histoplasmosis. The most frequent clinical manifestations were weight loss (85.7%), asthenia (78.5%), and fever (64.2%). The diagnosis of histoplasmosis was made primarily by histopathology (71.4%), and the diagnosis of tuberculosis was made by means of direct microscopic examination (71.4%). Death occurred in two patients, and relapse of both infections occurred in one patient. Moxifloxacin was substituted for rifampicin in six patients, with good outcomes noted for both infections. The clinical presentation does not readily identify acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients who have tuberculosis and histoplasmosis. The use of a fluoroquinolone as an alternative agent in place of rifampicin for tuberculosis allows effective therapy with itraconazole for histoplasmosis.

All patients were infected in a common-source outbreak of histoplasmosis which occurred on one day. All patients had both strictly defined clinical and serologic evidence of infection. The SACE activity was elevated at six weeks compared to normal controls, and seven of the 44 had levels more than 2 SD above the normal mean. SACE levels were also measured at three and 24 weeks after acute infection in a smaller number of the same subjects. Serial observations demonstrated that all subjects (including those with normal and elevated SACE at six weeks) had a rise and fall in SACE activity following symptomatic acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Our findings suggest that elevated SACE does not reliably separate sarcoidosis from histoplasmosis, although elevations in histoplasmosis are much less common and may occur only briefly following acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. More important, it seems that SACE activity rises acutely in all patients with symptomatic acute histoplasmosis and then falls gradually toward baseline over several months, coinciding temporally with the granulomatous response.\n\nSurgical aspects of pulmonary histoplasmosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSutaria, M. K.; Polk, J. W.; Reddy, P.; Mohanty, S. K.\n\n1970-01-01\n\nHistoplasmosis is of special interest to thoracic surgeons because it may appear in such a wide variety of clinical forms. Fourteen years' experience with 110 proved cases of surgically treated pulmonary histoplasmosis has been reviewed. Twenty-one of these patients manifested as `coinlesion' and underwent only wedge resection without amphotericin B therapy. A long-term follow-up of these patients indicates that these lesions are benign and need no additional therapy. Thirteen patients with pulmonary infiltration underwent surgery and three received post-operative amphotericin B therapy. Our largest group of surgically treated patients is of cavitary histoplasmosis. There were 76 patients in this group; 38 were managed with only surgical resection and the other 38 had surgical resection together with amphotericin B therapy. Operative indications, various forms of treatment, post-operative complications, and their results have been critically analysed. From this study we conclude that amphotericin B offers little protection against the immediate post-operative complications, but it reduces mortality and a recurrence of the disease, as judged from long-term follow-up.

Histoplasma capsulatum is the most common endemic mycosis in the United States and is a frequent cause of opportunistic infection in immunodeficient hosts. Histoplasmosis is most often self-limiting and goes unrecognized in the immunocompetent population but can progress to disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with an impaired immune system. Liver involvement as a part of disseminated histoplasmosis which usually originates in the lung is well known. However, extrapulmonary hepatic histoplasmosis as a primary manifestation is extremely rare. Case Presentation. We report a rare case of histoplasmosis that presented as persistent fever and abnormal liver function tests in a 66-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis, receiving infliximab. Conclusion. Emphasizing histoplasmosis as a major cause of acute granulomatous hepatitis and fever of unknown origin in cell mediated immunodeficient population, this case highlights the need for high index of suspicion and the importance of prompt diagnosis since any delay of treatment can be life threatening in this population.

Pulmonary histoplasmosis may be misdiagnosed as tuberculosis (TB). In the last six decades (1952â2017), 470 cases of histoplasmosis have been reported. HIV-infected patients accounted for 38% (178) of the cases. West Africa had the highest number of recorded cases with 179; the majority (162 cases) were caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. dubuosii (Hcd). From the Southern African region, 150 cases have been reported, and the majority (119) were caused by H. capsulatum var. capsulatum (Hcc). There have been 12 histoplasmin skin test surveys with rates of 0% to 35% positivity. Most cases of Hcd presented as localised lesions in immunocompetent persons; however, it was disseminated in AIDS patients. Rapid diagnosis of histoplasmosis in Africa is only currently possible using microscopy; antigen testing and PCR are not available in most of Africa. Treatment requires amphotericin B and itraconazole, both of which are not licensed or available in several parts of Africa.

Although Histoplasma capsulatum pneumonitis is common, pleural effusions associated with histoplasmosis are quite rare, and massive pleural effusions have not been reported. There have been several reports of pericardial fibrosis secondary to histoplasmosis, but epicardial fibrosis has not been described. We report a biopsy-proven case of histoplasmosis initially associated with recurrent massive pleural effusions and excessive pleural fibrosis causing a trapped lung. The patient later developed constrictive pericarditis. Despite pericardiectomy, severe cor pulmonale occurred, and the patient died. Necropsy demonstrated fibrosis of the epicardium.\n\nCentral Nervous System Histoplasmosis in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nNyalakonda, Harita; Albuerne, Marisol; Suazo Hernandez, Lia Patricia; Sarria, Juan C\n\n2016-02-01\n\nInvolvement of the central nervous system (CNS) by Histoplasma capsulatum in AIDS is uncommon and not easily recognized. CNS histoplasmosis cases from our institution were identified by a retrospective chart review from 2004-2014. A thorough literature search was performed for additional cases and their characteristics were compared. Clinical findings, treatment and outcomes are discussed. A total of 5 cases from our institution were identified. They had a clinical presentation that included classic signs of meningitis, often with evidence of disseminated involvement, and was typically severe with important neurological impairment. These cases were treated with antifungal agents, including a lipid amphotericin B formulation and azole drugs, but eventually 3 experienced nonresolution of their disease likely because of lack of adherence to therapy and died from their infection. The clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of these cases did not significantly differ from cases found in the review of the literature. Clinicians practicing in endemic areas should be aware of this rare but serious form of histoplasmosis. The recognition of 5 cases of CNS histoplasmosis in AIDS patients from a single institution suggests that histoplasmosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of the CNS complications of AIDS.

Histoplasmosis is not a reportable disease in Colombia and consequently, a survey was designed to collect histoplasmosis cases diagnosed in the country. The aim of this work was to analyze the data collected from 1992 to 2008. Materials and methods. The survey included demographic data, risk factors, clinical manifestations, imaging data, diagnostic methods and antifungal treatment. Patients were grouped according to risk factors and comparisons of the various findings were done. A total of 434 surveys were gathered from 20 of the country's Departments. Most patients (96.1%) were adults, 77% were males with a mean age of 38.4 years. Only 3.9% were children less than 15 years of age. In the adult population, AIDS was reported in 70.5% of the cases; additionally, in 7.0% patients other immunosuppressive conditions were informed. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever (76.1%), cough (54.8%) and constitutional symptoms (56.8%). X rays abnormalities were represented mainly by infiltrates (65.9%) and nodules (17.1%). Diagnosis was made by microscopic observation of H. capsulatum in 49.6% patients, by culture in 58.0% and by serological test in 14.6% cases. Antifungal use was recorded in 52.5% cases. Histoplasmosis is frequent in Colombia, especially in certain risk factor groups such as the HIV-infected population. Data collected from this large number of cases has allowed valid comparisons on various aspects of histoplasmosis in Colombia.\n\nLymphocyte transformation in presumed ocular histoplasmosis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGanley, J.P.; Nemo, G.J.; Comstock, G.W.\n\nLymphocytes from individuals with inactive macular disciform lesions of presumed ocular histoplasmosis challenged with three histoplasmin antigens incorporated tritiated thymidine at a significantly higher rate than histoplasmin-stimulated lymphocytes of matched control and peripheral scar groups. This finding is consistent with the etiologic association of the disciform ocular syndrome and previous systemic infection with Histoplasma capsulatum. The disciform group had a higher mean response than the other two groups to pokeweed mitogen but not to phytohemagglutinin and had higher mean counts per minute to the specific antigens Toxoplasma gondii, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M battery, and M gaus, butmoreÂ Â» not to Candida albicans. These data would suggest that individuals with the disciform lesion of presumed ocular histoplasmosis have a hyperreactive cellular immune response; this response may play an important role in the development of the disciform.Â«Â less\n\nCognitive impairment and memory loss associated with histoplasmosis: a case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoughan, Ashlee R; Perna, Robert; Hertza, Jeremy\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHistoplasmosis is a rare disease caused by inhalation of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. It can spread via cerebral circulation to the central nervous system as a manifestation of a disseminated infection; particularly in patients with immune suppression, which can result in isolated ring-enhancing lesions and inflammation in the brain. Of the reported disseminated histoplasmosis cases (approximately 1 in 2000 per year), only 5-20% have evidence of central nervous system involvement. This paper reviews a single case study of a 57-year-old female diagnosed with disseminated CNS histoplasmosis. Patient's complaints included reduced short-term memory, word-finding problems, and difficulty organizing, making decisions, getting lost while driving, recalling names, retaining information while reading, and slowed processing speed. There was also a history of mild depression and anxiety. Direct testing revealed deficits in multiple cognitive domains including complex attention, processing speed, semantic fluency, visual scanning, motor speed, set-shifting, naming, nonverbal memory, and verbal memory. Neuropsychological deficits suggest cortical and subcortical brain dysfunction, including anterior, temporal, and mesial-temporal regions. This case illustrates the need for neuropsychologists to understand histoplasmosis, the related pathophysiology, and the neuropsychological impact; particularly with the potential for delayed progression.\n\nA diagnostic predicament: activated sarcoidosis or pulmonary histoplasmosis. A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nLingscheid, Tilman; von Heinz, Marie; Klages, Birgit; Rickerts, Volker; Tintelnot, Kathrin; Gerhold, Manuela; Oestmann, JÃ¶rg-Wilhelm; Becker, Markus; Temmesfeld-WollbrÃ¼ck, Bettina; Suttorp, Norbert; HÃ¼bner, Ralf-Harto\n\n2017-05-01\n\nWe report a case of a 41-year-old man presenting with persisting fevers over 2 weeks. The patient had spent 4 weeks in Central America. He was in control of a stable stage II sarcoidosis. Laboratory and various microbiological tests as well as chest radiography led to no diagnosis. Activated sarcoidosis was hypothesized as the most likely diagnosis. However, we considered an infectious process as a differential diagnosis, in detail, the travel history imposed histoplasmosis. Chest-CT documented localized interstitial consolidations. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy was performed. Results of BAL fluid, biopsy, distinct sarcoidosis serum markers and a borderline positive histoplasmosis-serology yielded in a diagnostic dilemma as no distinct diagnosis was drawable. After the patient was already started on a prednisolone trial, the final diagnosis - pulmonary histoplasmosis - could be achieved via positive culture and PCR out of the BAL fluid. This case shows the difficult differentiation between an acute exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary disease and a concomitant infection, which was especially aggravated in this case as the histoplasmosis masqueraded an acute picture of sarcoidosis.

Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Î± inhibitors are known to increase the risk of systemic fungal infections such as disseminated histoplasmosis. Abatacept is a biologic agent with a mechanism different from that of TNFÎ± inhibitors: It suppresses cellular immunity by competing for the costimulatory signal on antigen-presenting cells. The risk of disseminated histoplasmosis for patients on abatacept is not known. We report a case of abatacept-associated disseminated histoplasmosis and review the known infectious complications of abatacept. While the safety of resuming biologic agents following treatment for disseminated histoplasmosis is also not known, abatacept is recommended over TNFÎ± inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis patients with a prior serious infection. We discuss the evidence supporting this recommendation and discuss alternative treatments for rheumatoid arthritis patients with a history of a serious infection.\n\nHistoplasmosis treated with a sulphonamide.

Abnormalities detected via initial clinicopathologic analyses included anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hypoproteinemia, and hypoglycemia. Results of a fecal flotation test were negative. Three weeks after the initial evaluation, splenomegaly was detected via palpation and ultrasonography. The hedgehog was treated with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, resulting in an initially favorable response. Fenbendazole was also administered against possible occult parasitic infestation. After 3 weeks of illness, the hedgehog's condition had worsened and supportive care and administration of additional antibacterial agents were instituted. The hedgehog died, and pathologic examinations revealed severe splenomegaly; granulomatous infiltrates were evident in multiple organs, and Histoplasma capsulatum yeasts were detected intralesionally. Histoplasmosis can develop in a wide range of mammalian species. African pygmy hedgehogs are becoming increasingly popular as exotic pets, and vague signs of illness and splenomegaly are often attributed to hemolymphatic malignancies, which are somewhat common in this species. Practitioners should be aware that similar clinical signs may be associated with histoplasmosis in these animals. Although the hedgehog of this report was confined indoors, it originated from an area where histoplasmosis was endemic; this indicates that the disease should be included as a differential diagnosis for hedgehogs that develop vague signs of illness and are known to originate from such geographic regions.\n\nChronic Progressive Disseminated Histoplasmosis in a Mexican Cockfighter\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFlores-Franco, RenÃ© AgustÃ­n; GÃ³mez-DÃ­az, Antonio; de JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Alonso, Antonio\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present illustrative images from a Mexican 58-year-old man who had the occupation of cockfighting from childhood and presented with chronic progressive disseminated histoplasmosis with primarily cutaneous manifestations.

We interviewed workers and family members, reviewed medical records, tested serum and urine for Histoplasma antigen/antibody, and conducted a cohort study to identify risk factors for histoplasmosis and severe infection (intensive care). A crew of 36 male workers removed large amounts of bat guano from tunnels without respiratory protection for a median of 24 days per worker (range, 1-25 days). Median age was 32 years (range, 18-62 years); none were immunocompromised. Thirty (83%) workers had illness that met the case definition, of whom 28 (93%) were hospitalized, 9 (30%) required intensive care, 6 (20%) required intubation, and 3 (10%) died. The median time from symptom onset to antifungal treatment was 6 days (range, 1-11 days). Twenty-two of 34 (65%) workers had laboratory evidence of infection. Severe illnesses and death likely resulted from exposure to large inocula of Histoplasma capsulatum spores in an enclosed space, lack of respiratory protection, and delay in recognition and treatment. Clinician education about histoplasmosis, improved laboratory capacity to diagnose fungal infections, and occupational health guidance to protect workers against endemic fungi are recommended in the Dominican Republic.\n\nIncremental cost-effectiveness of laser therapy for choroidal neovascularization associated with histoplasmosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrown, G C; Brown, M M; Sharma, S; Busbee, B; Brown, H\n\n2000-01-01\n\nLaser photocoagulation has been shown in a large clinical trial to be efficacious in reducing the degree of vision loss occurring secondary to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with ocular histoplasmosis. Nevertheless, data are lacking concerning the impact of the therapy on quality of life and its value to stakeholders in health care. Recently, information concerning the utility value of visual states has become available. Accordingly, the authors undertook to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of laser photocoagulation for the treatment of extrafoveal CNV occurring in eyes with ocular histoplasmosis. Design--A computer simulation, econometric model is presented to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of laser photocoagulation therapy, as compared with the natural course of the disease, for the treatment of patients with extrafoveal CNV associated with ocular histoplasmosis. The model applies long-term visual data from previous clinical trials, utility analysis (which reflects patient perceptions of quality of life), decision analysis with Markov modeling, and present value analysis with discounting to account for the time value of money. Outcome measure--Cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from treatment. Laser photocoagulation therapy for extrafoveal CNV associated with ocular histoplasmosis costs $4167 1999 US dollars (at a 3% discount rate) for each quality-adjusted life-year gained from treatment. Sensitivity analysis shows that changing the discount rate substantially alters the cost-effectiveness, with a value of $1339 at a 0% discount rate and $56,250 at a 10% discount rate. Compared with therapeutic modalities for other disease entities, laser therapy for the treatment of extrafoveal CNV associated with ocular histoplasmosis appears to be a cost-effective treatment from the patient preference-based point of view.\n\nAcute systemic histoplasmosis associated with chorioretinitis in an immunocompetent adolescent\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFowler, Brian; Shen, Christopher; Mastellone, Joseph; Chaum, Edward\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSummary Histoplasmosis is an endemic, systemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. A minority of patients develop asymptomatic chorioretinitis known as presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), which is typically associated with chorioretinal scarring and peripapillary atrophy and occasionally with choroidal neovascularization secondary to maculopathy. We report a case of acute severe bilateral chorioretinitis associated with disseminated H. capsulatum in an immunocompetent adolescent boy living in an endemic area. The chorioretinitis did not respond to systemic antifungal therapy, but both his systemic illness and ocular lesions resolved with the addition of systemic steroids.

Histopathological examination revealed a systemic mycosis with most severe involvement of the lungs suggestive of Histoplasma (H.) capsulatum-infection. Molecular confirmation was based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis of a fungal culture from liver samples. This is the first case of feline histoplasmosis proven by molecular diagnostic technique in Europe and reported in Austria, etc. PMID:24432230\n\nHistoplasmosis in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnderson, Albert M.; Sanchez, Alejandro; Farabi, Alireza; Hage, Chadi; Baddley, John W.; Jhaveri, Malhar; Greenberg, Richard N.; Bamberger, David M.; Rodgers, Mark; Crawford, Timothy N.; Wheat, L. Joseph\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract Although discontinuation of suppressive antifungal therapy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated histoplasmosis is accepted for patients with immunologic recovery, there have been no published studies of this approach in clinical practice, and minimal characterization of individuals who relapse with this disease. We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine the outcome in AIDS patients following discontinuation of suppressive antifungal therapy for histoplasmosis. Ninety-seven patients were divided into a physician-discontinued suppressive therapy group (PD) (38 patients) and a physician-continued suppressive therapy group (PC) (59 patients). The 2 groups were not statistically different at baseline, but at discontinuation of therapy and at the most recent follow-up there were significant differences in adherence to therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA, and urinary Histoplasma antigen concentration. There was no relapse or death attributed to histoplasmosis in the PD group compared with 36% relapse (p < 0.0001) and 5% death (p = 0.28) in the PC group. Relapse occurred in 53% of the nonadherent patients but not in the adherent patients (p < 0.0001). Sixty-seven percent of patients with initial central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis relapsed compared to 15% of patients without CNS involvement (p = 0.0004), which may be accounted for by nonadherence. In addition, patients with antigenuria above 2.0 ng/mL at 1-year follow-up were 12.82 times (95% confidence interval, 2.91â55.56) more likely to relapse compared to those with antigenuria below 2.0 ng/mL. Discontinuation of antifungal therapy was safe in adherent patients who completed at least 1 year of antifungal treatment, and had CD4 counts >150 cells/mL, HIV RNA <400 c/mL, Histoplasma antigenuria <2 ng/mL (equivalent to <4.0 units in second-generation method), and no CNS histoplasmosis.

To report a histoplasmosis outbreak in Zapala town, Province of NeuquÃ©n, Patagonia Argentina. We evaluated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 5 patients involved in the outbreak. Environmental studies were conducted to determine the source of infection. The genetic profile of Histoplasma capsulatum strains isolated from the index case (IC) were compared with clinical isolates from Argentinean patients not related to the outbreak, using RAPD-PCR with primers 1281-1283. The patients were residents of Zapala, and had not visited other geographical areas before. All patients had an influenza-like syndrome, and X-ray revealed disseminated micronodular images throughout the lung parenchyma. The IC needed specific antifungal therapy; the remaining 4 patients had mild symptoms, and did not require therapy. All of them had a good clinical outcome. Strains of H. capsulatum isolated from blood culture and lung biopsy of the IC showed a genetic profile different from other strains analyzed. The presence of the fungus in the environment was demonstrated by the detection of anti-Histoplasma antibodies in BALB/c mice inoculated with soil obtained in a culvert where workers had dug up earth after a landslide. This outbreak suggests the histoplasmosis endemic area is under the 38Â° S parallel. Patients from NeuquÃ©n, Patagonia Argentina, with compatible symptoms of histoplasmosis should be tested, regardless of their travel or exposure history.

A positive HIV serology was discovered and a chest radiography revealed a 'miliary pattern'. Bone marrow aspiration pointed out yeast inclusions within macrophages. Given the morphological aspect, the clinical presentation and immunosuppression, histoplasmosis was retained as a working hypothesis. Antiretroviral and amphotericin B treatments were promptly initiated. Review Given the immigration wave that Europe is currently experiencing, we think it is important to share experience and knowledge, especially in non-endemic areas such as Europe, where clinicians are not used to face this disease. Histoplasmosis is due to Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus. Infection occurs by inhaling spores contained in soils contaminated by bat or bird droppings. The clinical presentation depends on the immune status of the host and the importance of inoculum, varying from asymptomatic to disseminated forms. AIDS patients are particularly susceptible to develop a severe disease. Antigen detection, molecular biology techniques, and microscopic examination are used to make a rapid diagnosis. However, antigen detection is not available in Europe and diagnosis needs a strong clinical suspicion in non-endemic areas. Because of suggestive imagery, clinicians might focus on tuberculosis. Our case illustrates the need for clinicians to take histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis, depending on the context and the patient's past history.\n\nHigh Mortality and Coinfection in a Prospective Cohort of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Patients with Histoplasmosis in Guatemala.\n\nPubMed\n\nSamayoa, Blanca; Roy, Monika; Cleveland, Angela Ahlquist; Medina, Narda; Lau-Bonilla, Dalia; Scheel, Christina M; Gomez, Beatriz L; Chiller, Tom; Arathoon, Eduardo\n\n2017-07-01\n\nHistoplasmosis is one of the most common and deadly opportunistic infections among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Latin America, but due to limited diagnostic capacity in this region, few data on the burden and clinical characteristics of this disease exist. Between 2005 and 2009, we enrolled patients â¥ 18 years of age with suspected histoplasmosis at a hospital-based HIV clinic in Guatemala City. A case of suspected histoplasmosis was defined as a person presenting with at least three of five clinical or radiologic criteria. A confirmed case of histoplasmosis was defined as a person with a positive culture or urine antigen test for Histoplasma capsulatum . Demographic and clinical data were also collected and analyzed. Of 263 enrolled as suspected cases of histoplasmosis, 101 (38.4%) were confirmed cases. Median time to diagnosis was 15 days after presentation (interquartile range [IQR] = 5-23). Crude overall mortality was 43.6%; median survival time was 19 days (IQR = 4-69). Mycobacterial infection was diagnosed in 70 (26.6%) cases; 26 (25.7%) histoplasmosis cases were coinfected with mycobacteria. High mortality and short survival time after initial symptoms were observed in patients with histoplasmosis. Mycobacterial coinfection diagnoses were frequent, highlighting the importance of pursuing diagnoses for both diseases.\n\nHIV infection with concomitant cerebral toxoplasmosis and disseminated histoplasmosis in a 45-year-old man.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurata, Masayuki; Furusyo, Norihiro; Otaguro, Shigeru; Nabeshima, Shigeki; Ariyama, Iwao; Hayashi, Jun\n\n2007-02-01\n\nAlthough disseminated histoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients in endemic areas, it is not widely known in Japan. We report a rare case of a man from Ghana infected with HIV who was hospitalized in Japan and who suffered from coinfection with cerebral toxoplasmosis and disseminated histoplasmosis. The diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis was confirmed by a brain biopsy, and the therapy for the disease resulted in almost complete resolution of the brain lesion. However, fever of unknown origin continued for 2 weeks, and disseminated histoplasmosis was diagnosed by examination of a blood smear and by the detection of the histoplasma genome in the peripheral blood by means of polymerase chain reaction. The isolate was confirmed to be Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii. Therapy with amphotericin B was initiated, and no histoplasma genome in the peripheral blood was detected 3 days later. Unfortunately, the patient died after 10 days from acute respiratory syndrome. This case highlights that histoplasmosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of opportunistic infections in AIDS patients when patients have a history of travel to or arrival from endemic areas.\n\nThe use of genetic markers in the molecular epidemiology of histoplasmosis: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nDamasceno, L S; LeitÃ£o, T M J S; Taylor, M L; Muniz, M M; ZancopÃ©-Oliveira, R M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHistoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungal pathogen that can infect both humans and animals. This disease has worldwide distribution and affects mainly immunocompromised individuals. In the environment, H. capsulatum grows as mold but undergoes a morphologic transition to the yeast morphotype under special conditions. Molecular techniques are important tools to conduct epidemiologic investigations for fungal detection, identification of infection sources, and determination of different fungal genotypes associated to a particular disease symptom. In this study, we performed a systematic review in the PubMed database to improve the understanding about the molecular epidemiology of histoplasmosis. This search was restricted to English and Spanish articles. We included a combination of specific keywords: molecular typing [OR] genetic diversity [OR] polymorphism [AND] H. capsulatum; molecular epidemiology [AND] histoplasmosis; and molecular epidemiology [AND] Histoplasma. In addition, we used the specific terms: histoplasmosis [AND] outbreaks. Non-English or non-Spanish articles, dead links, and duplicate results were excluded from the review. The results reached show that the main methods used for molecular typing of H. capsulatum were: restriction fragment length polymorphism, random amplified polymorphic DNA, microsatellites polymorphism, sequencing of internal transcribed spacers region, and multilocus sequence typing. Different genetic profiles were identified among H. capsulatum isolates, which can be grouped according to their source, geographical origin, and clinical manifestations.\n\nPresentation and Treatment of Histoplasmosis in Pediatric Oncology Patients: Case Series and Review of the Literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nHess, Jennifer; Fondell, Andrew; Fustino, Nicholas; Malik, Jeff; Rokes, Christopher\n\n2017-03-01\n\nHistoplasmosis is an endemic fungus in several regions of the United States. The diagnosis and treatment of this infection can be challenging in pediatric oncology patients. We present 5 patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis while receiving treatment at a midsize pediatric oncology center in Iowa. Two cases occurred in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 3 cases in patients with solid tumors. All patients were treated with antifungal therapy and demonstrated excellent clinical response. Histoplasmosis should be considered as a potential cause of nonspecific febrile illness, pulmonary masses, and bone marrow suppression in immunocompromised patients in endemic regions. Prompt and accurate diagnosis can facilitate timely antifungal therapy and avoidance of prolonged hospital stays, invasive testing, unnecessary antibiotics, and unwarranted anticancer therapies.\n\n[Imported histoplasmosis in Navarra: presentation of four cases].\n\nPubMed\n\nNavascuÃ©s, Ana; RodrÃ­guez, Irene; RepÃ¡raz, JesÃºs; Salvo, Soledad; Gil-Setas, Alberto; MartÃ­nez PeÃ±uela, JosÃ© MarÃ­a\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHistoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by the dimorphic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum. Its incidence in Spain has increased in recent years, mainly due to the increased presence of immigrants from Latin America and increased travel to the continent for tourism and cooperation. Our aim was to review the clinical characteristics of cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed in our hospital during the last six years. We diagnosed 4 cases from 4 patients from South America, 3 of whom were HIV positive and 1 diagnosed with dermatomyositis was treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The laboratory diagnosis was carried out by histological and microbiological study, by culture and specific PCR directly on the sample. As it is an imported infection there needs to be a high level of suspicion and a detailed history taken to get a diagnosis. This infection requires a differential diagnosis between febrile syndrome in immunosuppressed patients, both HIV positive and immunosuppressive therapy, which originate from endemic areas, or who have a history of staying in them.

We describe the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of patients with histoplasmosis-associated HLH at our institution. Methods.âWe performed a retrospective chart review of all inpatients at Parkland Hospital diagnosed with HLH associated with Histoplasma capsulatum from 2003 to 2013. Results.âEleven cases of histoplasmosis-associated HLH over this time period were identified. Nine of eleven cases were males (82%). Nine of these patients had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 1 was a renal transplant patient on immunosuppressants, and the other had no documented immunocompromise. The most common HLH criteria were splenomegaly (n = 10), fever (n = 10), and ferritin >500 ng/dL (n = 9). Urine Histoplasma antigen was positive in every patient tested (n = 9 of 9), and most antibodies for Histoplasma were positive if checked (n = 4 of 5). A majority of patients received liposomal amphotericin B (n = 9) with an average treatment duration of 11 days, and 5 patients also received prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or both. Overall, 5 patients died within 30 days (45.5%), and 7 patients died within 90 days (63.6%). Of the 5 patients that received immunosuppression, 4 died (80%), whereas in the group not given additional immunosuppression (n = 5), 2 died (40%). Conclusions.âHistoplasmosis-associated HLH among adults is a lethal disease of highly immunocompromised patients, especially patients with HIV/AIDS. Clinical features such as splenomegaly, elevated ferritin, and cytopenias should prompt evaluation for HLH in this population. Further data are needed to define the role of immunosuppression, IVIG, and highly active antiretroviral therapy in treating this condition.

Se encontrÃ³ el mismo perfil de expresiÃ³n en las comparaciones entre los casos de LEG esporÃ¡dico y familiar, asÃ­ como en los consanguÃ­neos sanos de las familias multicasos, que incluÃ­a una expresiÃ³n incrementada de VÎ² 5.2, VÎ² 11 y VÎ² 16, y una menor expresiÃ³n de VÎ² 3, VÎ²4, VÎ² 7.1 y VÎ² 7. De manera interesante, solo VÎ² 17 se expresÃ³ de modo diferente entre casos familiares y esporÃ¡dicos de LEG. Igualmente, la expresiÃ³n incrementada de VÎ² 9 fue el distintivo entre los casos de LEG familiar (casos y consanguÃ­neos sanos) y los controles sanos. Estos resultados refuerzan la nociÃ³n de que el perfil final del repertorio VÎ² TCR observado en LEG familiar y no familiar parece surgir de la interacciÃ³n de factores genÃ©ticos, ambientales e inmunorreguladores, ademÃ¡s de que pueden explicar las alteraciones inmunitarias que se observan en los consanguÃ­neos sanos de pacientes con LEG.

A range of unusual clinical manifestations of disseminated cutaneous histoplasmosis (DCH) in AIDS patients has been documented, but the cutaneous histopathological descriptions are short and incomplete. In addition, the histopathological spectrum of AIDS-associated DCH is poorly recognized. This is a prospective 32-month study of all HIV positive patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis in the Departments of Anatomical Pathology and Dermatology, Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine and King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa. Clinical distribution and morphology of the individual skin lesions and CD4+ lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood were analysed in relation to the histopathological features of biopsied lesional tissue. Ultrastructural examination of tissue retrieved from the wax blocks of three cases that exhibited dermal karyorrhexis and collagen necrosis was undertaken. Fungal culture of lesional skin tissue was undertaken in all patients. Twenty-one biopsies of papules (7), nodules (4), plaques (5), erythema multiforme-like lesions (2), vasculitic lesions (2) and exfoliative dermatitis (1) from 14 patients were examined. Of four biopsies (CD4 range: 120-128 cells/mm3) one and three demonstrated necrotizing and non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with a paucity of intrahistiocytic microorganisms. Seven biopsies (CD4 range: 2-56 cells/mm3) demonstrated diffuse dermal and intravascular accumulation of histiocytes densely parasitized by Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum. Vasculitis, karyorrhexis or collagen necrosis was not present. Ten biopsies (CD4 range: 2-72 cells/mm3) demonstrated diffuse dermal karyorrhexis, collagen necrosis and interstitial, extracellular H. capsulatum var. capsulatum.

A diferencia de los adultos, en muchos casos no se asocia a tumores y las manifestaciones iniciales en niÃ±os mÃ¡s frecuentes son crisis convulsivas y trastornos del movimiento, mientras que en los adultos predominan las alteraciones psiquiÃ¡tricas. Casos clÃ­nicos Presentamos seis casos pediÃ¡tricos confirmados con anticuerpos contra la subunidad NR1 del receptor de NMDA en suero y lÃ­quido cefalorraquÃ­deo. Cinco de los casos comenzaron con crisis convulsivas como manifestaciÃ³n clÃ­nica inicial antes de desarrollar el cuadro clÃ¡sico de esta entidad. En todos los casos se utilizaron esteroides como primera lÃ­nea de tratamiento, con los que sÃ³lo se observÃ³ control de las manifestaciones en uno, por lo que el resto de los pacientes requiriÃ³ inmunomoduladores de segunda lÃ­nea. Todos los pacientes recibieron metotrexato como tratamiento inmunomodulador para evitar recaÃ­das y la evoluciÃ³n fue a la mejorÃ­a en todos ellos. Conclusiones En nuestra serie de pacientes con encefalitis por anticuerpos contra el receptor de NMDA, ninguno se asociÃ³ a tumores. Todos los casos recibieron metotrexato por lo menos durante un aÃ±o, no observamos eventos adversos clÃ­nicos ni por laboratorio, ni hubo secuelas neurolÃ³gicas ni recaÃ­das durante el tratamiento.

All patients were adults. Those with paracoccidioidomycosis exhibited the chronic disseminated form of the disease; 21 of these patients had lesions in two or more locations, and four had lesions only on the larynx or mouth. Itraconazole was administered at a daily dosage of 50 mg for six months in the majority of these cases. All infections were clinically cured or showed striking improvement. Patients with histoplasmosis had the chronic pulmonary or chronic disseminated form of the disease. A daily dose of 100 mg was administered until clinical cure was established; the dose was then changed to 50 mg until the completion of six months of treatment. Twelve infections were clinically cured; four were strikingly alleviated. The remaining patient, who discontinued treatment with itraconazole after two months, had a severe relapse and died of respiratory failure.\n\nDisseminated histoplasmosis presenting with ileal perforation in a renal transplant recipient.\n\nPubMed\n\nZainudin, B M; Kassim, F; Annuar, N M; Lim, C S; Ghazali, A K; Murad, Z\n\n1992-08-01\n\nA renal transplant patient presented with ileal perforation due to histoplasmosis 3 years after transplantation.

Most experience has been derived from small single center case series, or case report literature reviews. Therefore, a larger study of central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis is needed in order to guide the approach to diagnosis, and treatment.A convenience sample of 77 patients with histoplasmosis infection of the CNS was evaluated. Data was collected that focused on recognition of infection, diagnostic techniques, and outcomes of treatment.Twenty nine percent of patients were not immunosuppressed. Histoplasma antigen, or anti-Histoplasma antibodies were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 75% of patients. One year survival was 75% among patients treated initially with amphotericin B, and was highest with liposomal, or deoxycholate formulations. Mortality was higher in immunocompromised patients, and patients 54 years of age, or older. Six percent of patients relapsed, all of whom had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and were poorly adherent with treatment.While CNS histoplasmosis occurred most often in immunocompromised individuals, a significant proportion of patients were previously, healthy. The diagnosis can be established by antigen, and antibody testing of the CSF, and serum, and antigen testing of the urine in most patients. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (AMB-L) for at least 1 month; followed by itraconazole for at least 1 year, results in survival among the majority of individuals. Patients should be followed for relapse for at least 1 year, after stopping therapy.\n\nOrofacial manifestations of histoplasmosis in HIV-positive patients: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nGomes Ferreira, O; Vieira Fernandes, A; SebastiÃ£o Borges, A; SimÃ£o Ferreira, M; Mota Loyola, A\n\n2001-01-01\n\nAmongst the main opportunistic diseases that affect the HIV-positive patient, histoplasmosis is found. This systemic mycosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum has the capacity to disseminate from the lung to the skin and oral mucosa. Oral lesions of histoplasmosis can be found with ulcerated or nodular aspect, being always very painful and infiltrating the mucosa. When they are present in the mouth, they strongly indicate the presence of some kind of immunosuppression. This study shows the disease's evolution in an HIV-positive patient, who presented several ulcerated lesions in the oral cavity and facial skin. The symptomatology and clinical aspects of the lesions were not specific for the disease, and due to this, the diagnosis was obtained by cytological smear and oral biopsy. The results of the exams defined the disseminated picture of the infection. The treatment plan involved the use of amphotericin B for the lesions' remission, and, following this, itraconazole was administered in the maintenance phase.\n\nUsefulness of molecular markers in the diagnosis of occupational and recreational histoplasmosis outbreaks.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrÃ­as-De-LeÃ³n, MarÃ­a Guadalupe; RamÃ­rez-BÃ¡rcenas, JosÃ© Antonio; RodrÃ­guez-Arellanes, Gabriela; Velasco-CastrejÃ³n, Oscar; Taylor, Maria Lucia; Reyes-Montes, MarÃ­a Del RocÃ­o\n\n2017-03-01\n\nHistoplasmosis is considered the most important systemic mycosis in Mexico, and its diagnosis requires fast and reliable methodologies. The present study evaluated the usefulness of PCR using Hcp100 and 1281-1283 (220) molecular markers in detecting Histoplasma capsulatum in occupational and recreational outbreaks. Seven clinical serum samples of infected individuals from three different histoplasmosis outbreaks were processed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to titre anti-H. capsulatum antibodies and to extract DNA. Fourteen environmental samples were also processed for H. capsulatum isolation and DNA extraction. Both clinical and environmental DNA samples were analysed by PCR with Hcp100 and 1281-1283 (220) markers. Antibodies to H. capsulatum were detected by ELISA in all serum samples using specific antigens, and in six of these samples, the PCR products of both molecular markers were amplified. Four environmental samples amplified one of the two markers, but only one sample amplified both markers and an isolate of H. capsulatum was cultured from this sample. All PCR products were sequenced, and the sequences for each marker were analysed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn), which revealed 95-98 and 98-100Â % similarities with the reference sequences deposited in the GenBank for Hcp100 and 1281-1283 (220) , respectively. Both molecular markers proved to be useful in studying histoplasmosis outbreaks because they are matched for pathogen detection in either clinical or environmental samples.\n\nImmunological assays employed for the elucidation of an histoplasmosis outbreak in SÃ£o Paulo, SP\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPassos, Angela Noronha; Kohara, Valdelene Sayuri; de Freitas, Roseli Santos; Vicentini, Adriana Pardini\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSeveral reports showed outbreaks of histoplasmosis acquired while bat-inhabited caves were visited by tourists, miners or researchers.

The existence of epidemiologic link, four patients with clinical signs suggestive of histoplasmosis and mycological confirmation has made that all 35 individuals involved to the cave visit were subjected to serological evaluation. By DI, we observed reactivity against H. capsulatum antigen in a single serum examined nearly 20 days after exposure to fungal propagules. On the other hand, IB showed reactivity against H and M fractions in 50% of samples evaluated. The analysis of the second sample batch, collected two months after the exposure showed that 96.7% were reactive by DI with antibodies titers ranging from 1 to 16 and 100% of reactivity against H and M fractions, by IB, suggesting an acute infection. The analysis of the overall agreement between the methods showed to be reasonable (Îº = 0.37). This study confirms the importance and efficacy of more sensitive methodologies, such as IB assay, to early elucidation of disease, especially in cases of patients without mycological information.

Chest computed tomography showed a nodule in the left lower lobe adjacent to the visceral pleura. Histopathologic examination of a thoracoscopic partial pulmonary resection specimen showed coagulation necrosis with a number of yeast-like forms on Grocott staining. In addition, serum anti-Histoplasma antibody positivity was detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Histoplasma-specific nested real-time polymerase chain reaction results were positive in the pulmonary region. Finally, pulmonary histoplasmosis was diagnosed, and treatment with itraconazole was initiated. The patient's wife who had accompanied him to Mexico was asymptomatic and was not found to have histoplasmosis based on diagnostic imaging and serological findings. Although rare in Japan, histoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions in patients who have returned from travel to endemic areas.\n\nHistoplasmosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS): multicenter study of outcomes and factors associated with relapse.\n\nPubMed\n\nMyint, Thein; Anderson, Albert M; Sanchez, Alejandro; Farabi, Alireza; Hage, Chadi; Baddley, John W; Jhaveri, Malhar; Greenberg, Richard N; Bamberger, David M; Rodgers, Mark; Crawford, Timothy N; Wheat, L Joseph\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAlthough discontinuation of suppressive antifungal therapy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated histoplasmosis is accepted for patients with immunologic recovery, there have been no published studies of this approach in clinical practice, and minimal characterization of individuals who relapse with this disease. We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine the outcome in AIDS patients following discontinuation of suppressive antifungal therapy for histoplasmosis. Ninety-seven patients were divided into a physician-discontinued suppressive therapy group (PD) (38 patients) and a physician-continued suppressive therapy group (PC) (59 patients). The 2 groups were not statistically different at baseline, but at discontinuation of therapy and at the most recent follow-up there were significant differences in adherence to therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA, and urinary Histoplasma antigen concentration. There was no relapse or death attributed to histoplasmosis in the PD group compared with 36% relapse (p < 0.0001) and 5% death (p = 0.28) in the PC group. Relapse occurred in 53% of the nonadherent patients but not in the adherent patients (p < 0.0001). Sixty-seven percent of patients with initial central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis relapsed compared to 15% of patients without CNS involvement (p = 0.0004), which may be accounted for by nonadherence. In addition, patients with antigenuria above 2.0 ng/mL at 1-year follow-up were 12.82 times (95% confidence interval, 2.91-55.56) more likely to relapse compared to those with antigenuria below 2.0 ng/mL. Discontinuation of antifungal therapy was safe in adherent patients who completed at least 1 year of antifungal treatment, and had CD4 counts >150 cells/mL, HIV RNA <400 c/mL, Histoplasma antigenuria <2 ng/mL (equivalent to <4.0 units in second-generation method), and no CNS histoplasmosis.\n\nClinical and Laboratory Profile of Persons Living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and Histoplasmosis from a Colombian Hospital.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaceres, Diego H; TobÃ³n, Angela M; Cleveland, Angela Ahlquist; Scheel, Christina M; Berbesi, Dedsy Y; Ochoa, JesÃºs; Restrepo, Angela; Brandt, Mary E; Chiller, Tom; GÃ³mez, Beatriz L\n\n2016-10-05\n\nHistoplasmosis is common among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (PLWHA) in Latin America, but its diagnosis is difficult and often nonspecific.

During 3 years (May 2008 to August 2011), we identified 89 PLWHA hospitalized with symptoms suggestive of PDH, of whom 45 (51%) had histoplasmosis. We observed tuberculosis (TB) coinfection in a large proportion of patients with PDH (35%), so all analyses were performed adjusting for this coinfection and, alternatively, excluding histoplasmosis patients with TB. Results showed that the patients with PDH were more likely to have Karnofsky score â¤ 30 (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97-4.06), liver compromised with hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly (PR = 1.77, CI = 1.03-3.06) and elevation in serum of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase to values > 40 mU/mL (PR = 2.06, CI = 1.09-3.88 and PR = 1.53, CI = 0.99-2.35, respectively).

However, many disseminated infections in Latin America go undiagnosed. A simple, rapid method to detect Histoplasma capsulatum infection in regions where histoplasmosis is endemic would dramatically decrease the time to diagnosis and treatment, reducing morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to validate a commercial monoclonal Histoplasma galactomannan (HGM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immuno-Mycologics [IMMY], Norman, OK, USA) in two cohorts of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). We analyzed urine samples from 589 people (466 from Guatemala and 123 from Colombia), including 546 from PLHIV and 43 from non-PLHIV controls. Sixty-three of these people (35 from Guatemala and 28 from Colombia) had confirmed histoplasmosis by isolation of H. capsulatum Using the standard curve provided by the quantitative commercial test, the sensitivity was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95 to 100%) and the specificity was 97% (95% CI, 96 to 99%) (cutoff = 0.5 ng/ml). Semiquantitative results, using a calibrator of 12.5 ng/ml of Histoplasma galactomannan to calculate an enzyme immunoassay index value (EIV) for the samples, showed a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 89 to 100%) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI, 96 to 99%) (cutoff â¥ 2.6 EIV). This relatively simple-to-perform commercial antigenuria test showed a high performance with reproducible results in both countries, suggesting that it can be used to detect progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in PLHIV in a wide range of clinical laboratories in countries where histoplasmosis is endemic.

Experience at the Francisco J. MuÃ±iz Infectious Diseases Hospital in Buenos Aires].\n\nPubMed\n\nNegroni, Ricardo; Messina, Fernando; Arechavala, Alicia; Santiso, Gabriela; Bianchi, Mario\n\nClassic histoplasmosis is a systemic endemic mycosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum. A significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality of AIDS-related histoplasmosis has been observed since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and secondary antifungal prophylaxis. The aim of this study was to determine the current state of prognosis and treatment response of HIV-positive patients with histoplasmosis in the Francisco J. MuÃ±iz Infectious Diseases Hospital in Buenos Aires City. A retrospective study was conducted using the demographic, clinical, immunological and treatment data of 80 patients suffering from AIDS-related histoplasmosis. Of the 80 cases studied 65 were male, the median age was 36 years, with 73.7% of the patients being drug addicts, 82.5% of the patients was not receiving HAART at diagnosis, and 58.7% of the cases had less than 50 CD4+ cells/Î¼l at the beginning of the treatment. The initial phase of treatment consisted of intravenous amphotericin B and/or oral itraconazole for 3 months, with 78.7% of the cases showing a good clinical response. Only 26/63 patients who were discharged from hospital continued with the follow-up of the HAART, secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole or amphotericin B. Secondary prophylaxis was stopped after more than one year of HAART if the patients were asymptomatic, had two CD 4 + cell counts greater than 150cells/Î¼l, and undetectable viral loads. No relapses were observed during a two-year follow up after prophylaxis was stopped. The treatment of histoplasmosis in HIV-positive patients was effective in 78.8% of the cases. The combination of HAART and secondary antifungal prophylaxis is safe, well tolerated, and effective. The low adherence of patients to HAART and the lack of laboratory kits for rapid histoplasmosis diagnosis should be addressed in the future.

Published case series provide limited guidance on disease management. We sought to determine the need for long-term antifungal therapy and the safety of resuming TNF-Î± blocker therapy after successful treatment of histoplasmosis. Methods.âWe conducted a multicenter retrospective review of 98 patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis between January 2000 and June 2011. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate risk factors for severe disease. Results.âThe most commonly used biologic agent was infliximab (67.3%). Concomitant corticosteroid use (odds ratio [OR], 3.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.06â14.60]) and higher urine Histoplasma antigen levels (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.03â1.25]) were found to be independent predictors of severe disease. Forty-six (47.4%) patients were initially treated with an amphotericin B formulation for a median duration of 2 weeks. Azole treatment was given for a median of 12 months. TNF-Î± blocker therapy was initially discontinued in 95 of 98 (96.9%) patients and later resumed in 25 of 74 (33.8%) patients at a median of 12 months (range, 1â69 months). The recurrence rate was 3.2% at a median follow-up period of 32 months. Of the 3 patients with recurrence, 2 had restarted TNF-Î± blocker therapy, 1 of whom died. Mortality rate was 3.2%. Conclusions.âIn this study, disease outcomes were generally favorable. Discontinuation of antifungal treatment after clinical response and an appropriate duration of therapy, probably at least 12 months, appears safe if pharmacologic immunosuppression has been held. Resumption of TNF-Î± blocker therapy also appears safe, assuming that the initial antifungal therapy was administered for 12 months.

We report 18 cases and review 34 published cases in the medical literature. We did a retrospective chart review from patients seen in our medical practices between 1989 and 2004. Most of our patients were men who had sex with men and who were not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Median CD4 count was 34/muL. The most common presenting symptoms were diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss. The most commonly involved site was the colon or cecum. Biopsies revealed visible Histoplasma capsulatum organisms in 89%. Cultures from any site were positive in 76.9%. Four patients died from GIH. Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis occurs in severely immunocompromised patients with AIDS not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Typical manifestations include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Diagnosis is confirmed by blood or gastrointestinal tissue culture. Improvements in antiretroviral and antifungal therapies appear to have reduced the incidence of GIH and may improve the prognosis of this disease.\n\nPlanificaciÃ³n NeuroquirÃºrgica con Software Osirix\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJaimovich, SebastiÃ¡n GastÃ³n; Guevara, Martin; Pampin, Sergio; Jaimovich, Roberto; Gardella, Javier Luis\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroducciÃ³n: La individualidad anatÃ³mica es clave para reducir el trauma quirÃºrgico y obtener un mejor resultado.

Positivity value for cultures was 35.7% (74/207), reactivity of serological tests was 95.2% (160/168), and a combination of both methodologies was 16.9% (35/207) for non-HIV patients. Positivity value for cultures was 75.0% (138/184), reactivity of serological tests was 92.4% (85/92), and a combination of both methodologies was 26.0% (48/184) for HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients; 48.1% (102/212) of extrapulmonary samples from HIV/AIDS patients yielded positive cultures compared with 23.1% (49/212) in non-HIV patients. Lymphocyte counts made for 33.1% (61/184) of HIV/AIDS patients showed a trend to low CD4+ numbers and higher proportion of positive cultures. These results indicate that culture is the most reliable fungal diagnostic method for HIV/AIDS patients, and contrary to what is generally believed, serological assays are useful for diagnosing histoplasmosis in these patients.

In murine histoplasmosis, inhibition of the LT-generating enzyme 5-lypoxigenase (5-LO) increases the susceptibility of the host to infection. In this study, we investigated whether murine resistance or susceptibility to Histoplasma capsulatum infection is associated with leukotriene production and an enhancement of in vivo and/or in vitro antimicrobial effector function. We show that susceptible C57BL/6 mice exhibit a higher fungal burden in the lung and spleen, increased mortality, lower expression levels of 5-LO and leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1) and decreased LTB4 production compared to the resistant 129/Sv mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous LTs are required for the optimal phagocytosis of H. capsulatum by macrophages from both murine strains, although C57BL/6 macrophages are more sensitive to the effects of LTB4 than 129/Sv macrophages. Therefore, our results provide novel evidence that LTB4 production and BLT1 signaling are required for a histoplasmosis-resistant phenotype.\n\nNew clinical and histological patterns of acute disseminated histoplasmosis in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nOllague Sierra, Jose E; Ollague Torres, Jose M\n\n2013-04-01\n\nHistoplasmosis has attained increasing relevance in the past 3 decades because of the appearance of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In most immunocompetent persons, the infection is asymptomatic or can produce a respiratory condition with symptoms and radiological images similar to those observed in pulmonary tuberculosis; in non-HIV+ immunocompromised patients, it can cause respiratory symptoms or evolve into a disseminated infection. The same can occur in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. We have observed a series of HIV+ patients with AIDS who presented with cutaneous histoplasmosis and in whom the clinical and histopathological features were highly unusual, including variable mucocutaneous lesions that were difficult to diagnose clinically. These patients displayed unusual, previously undescribed, histological patterns, including lichenoid pattern, nodular pseudomyxoid pattern, pyogenic granuloma-like pattern, perifollicular pattern, and superficial (S), mid (M), and deep perivascular dermatitis; and more commonly encountered patterns, such as histiocytic lobular panniculitis and focal nodular dermatitis. The novel histopathological patterns of cutaneous involvement by histoplasmosis seen in these patients resembled other common inflammatory and infectious conditions and required a high level of suspicion and the application of special stains for organisms for confirmation. These new, clinical, and histological findings do not seem to be commonly encountered in HIV- patients infected with the fungus but seem to be displayed most prominently in HIV+ patients with AIDS.\n\nFast protocol for the production of Histoplasma capsulatum antigens for antibody detection in the immunodiagnosis of histoplasmosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Freitas, Roseli Santos; Kamikawa, Camila Mika; Vicentini, Adriana Pardini\n\nCurrent methods for the production of Histoplasma capsulatum antigens are problematic in terms of standardization, specificity, stability, repeatability and reproducibility. In this study, we sought to optimize the methodology for producing H. capsulatum antigens, and to evaluate its applicability. Antigenic preparations obtained from 12 H. capsulatum isolates were evaluated by double immunodiffusion and immunoblotting assays against homologous and heterologous sera. The evaluated and optimized protocol allowed a more stable production, as well as repeatable, reproducible, with shorter culture time and less costly. By double immunodiffusion and immunoblotting assays, the best pattern of reactivity was observed for antigens obtained with 33 days of culture from the isolates 200 and 406 against the M antigen and for the isolate 200 with 15 days against H antigen. The SDS-PAGE presented antigenic components of molecular masses between 17 and 119kDa. The immunoblotting sensitiv"
