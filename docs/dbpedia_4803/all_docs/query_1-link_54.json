The conservation project of the Toledo Gate in Ciudad Real (Spain)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAlmagro Vidal, A.; RamÃ­rez GonzÃ¡lez, I.; Clemente San RomÃ¡n, C.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe Toledo Gate of Ciudad Real, Spain, constructed between the late 13th and early 14th centuries, is the last remaining portion of a once complete medieval city wall. It represents the long history of the city and constitutes its main heritage symbol, dividing the historic city centre from the later 19th and 20th century expansions. In October 2012, the Town Hall and the Montemadrid Foundation started the conservation works to preserve this important monument. The preliminary phase of this project included an in-depth series of scientific studies which were carried out by a multidisciplinary team focusing on archival research, historic investigations, archaeological excavations as well as material composition analysis and main treatment application tests. As a result of these studies a series of virtual 3D models were created to inform, discuss and study the monument. A first digital model permitted visualization of the gate in the 19th century and how the main entrance to the city was integrated as a fundamental part of the city walls. This virtual reconstruction also became an important part of the campaign to raise awareness among the citizens towards a monument that had remained in the shadows for the last century, isolated in a roundabout after the systematic demolition of the city walls in the late 19th century. Over the last three years and as a result of these archaeological and historic investigations and subsequent virtual models, surprisingly new and interesting data were brought to light thus permitting the establishment and corroboration of a new and updated hypothesis of the Toledo Gate that goes beyond the previous ideas. As a result of these studies a new architectural typology with construction techniques of has been suggested. This paper describes how the results of this continuous and interdisciplinary documentation process have benefitted from a computer graphic reconstruction of the gate. It highlights how virtual reconstruction can be a\n\nThe Toledo Cartulary, Capitulary Library of Toledo, 42-20 (1190 and its Contribution to the History of Toledo Cathedral\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRuth Miguel Franco\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The Toledo cartulary, Capitulary Library of Toledo, 42-40 (1190, is the oldest cartulary produced in Toledo Cathedral. It may also be considered an example of a cartulary-chronicle, as this volume not only includes royal, ecclesiastical and private documents relative to the institution (?, but it also includes some pieces of writing that contextualize the copied documents by relating them either to historical events, or to the Cathedral itself and to other assets or documents. The aim of this article is to analyze the construction of this cartulary and the mechanisms that it uses to transform individual documents into an account of the institutional history of Toledo Cathedral, focusing on the privileges of the mensa capitularis.\n\nFACETS OF THE ICONOGRAPHY OF DON JUAN MARTÃNEZ SILÃCEO, ARCHBISHOP OF TOLEDO = ALGUNOS ASPECTOS EN TORNO A LA ICONOGRAFÃA DEL ARZOBISPO DE TOLEDO DON JUAN MARTÃNEZ SILÃCEO\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarÃ­a Alegra GarcÃ­a GarcÃ­a\n\n2014-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Juan MartÃ­nez Siliceo (c. 1477-1557 was a Roman Catholic cardinal and archbishop and a distinguished humanist and mathematician who played an important role in the History and culture of Toledo and Spain during the 16th century.

Un caso real en Toledo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSobrini, I. M.\n\n2001-12-01\n\nFull Text Available We expose the environmental impact statement (EIS of a future golf course in Toledo city (Spain. This golf course is included in an ambitious scientific-medical research project concerning new therapies through the practice of golf for medullary handicapped persons, in addition with a cultural approach between the three big monotheistic religions that have historically lived together in Toledo. The methodology used to carry out the EIS was very particular and easy to be extrapolated to similar cases, but not to be generalized. It was based in comparing the future project. with the actual intensive irrigation farming of the land, and with the future urban consequences due lo its position next to Toledo city. The comparison between the different environmental impacts of this project and a the actual use of the land, suffering a very intensive irrigation farming, and b the future without the project, was favourable to the golf course, because it was concerned as less aggressive. An appropriate water managing will allow reducing the consumption from the actual 99 l/s authorised for agricultural use, until 54 l/s required for the golf course, improving the environment of this section of the Tajo river: The turf management will be less harmful than the irrigation farming, this one being held nowadays with a high pesticide consumption. Later on, environmental management practice will allow to reduce costs and will help to increase golf-players environmental consciousness. This new golf course will provide the integration o/ this section of Tajo River in the future urban development of Toledo city, creating a green island in its west side, profitable for all city dwellers. This change will be a great improvement, not only for ToledoÃ¢ÂÂs environment, but also for the development of different economical sectors. due to the golf course implantation.Se expone el estudio realizado sobre la incidencia ambiental de un futuro campo de golf en Toledo\n\nGeocronologÃ­a de los yacimientos achelenses de Pinedo y Cien Fanegas (Valle del Tajo) e implicaciones en la evoluciÃ³n fluvial en el entorno de Toledo (EspaÃ±a)\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nLÃ³pez-Recio, M.; Silva, P.

The poem presents the connection of Mendes with the architectural elements of the city of Toledo and some writers connected to this place, as Miguel de Cervantes and Lope de Vega, and the Renaissance artist El Greco. This link is created by an intertextual dialogue established by the Brazilian poet in a kind of affective constructions of reminiscences and nostalgia. Inserting the poem cultural elements from Spain, the poet allows communication between your lyrical voice and the other voices introduced by the reference among texts. Besides the past, the writer also builds intertextual relationships among his poetic voice, his context and the influence that the Spanish city of Toledo raises him. From these contacts, emerges the picture of a changing country in a movement of tension between history, culture - the memories - and the necessity of current developments. It also appears the poetic voiceâs personal conflict, who observes this conflict between nostalgia and loneliness.\n\nLa metamorfosis de Toledo en la pintura de El Greco\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPalma MartÃ­nez-Burgos GarcÃ­a\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFull Text Available En el presente artÃ­culo se abordan los distintos enfoques con los que El Greco interpreta el paisaje de Toledo. HÃ¡bil en el uso de la escenografÃ­a, tal y como la habÃ­a aprendido en su periplo veneciano y romano, sabe usar convenientemente los hitos arquitectÃ³nicos de Toledo para enmarcar sus composiciones religiosas. De este modo y bajo sus pinceles, Toledo se metamorfosea en JerusalÃ©n, en Troya, en Egipto, en Tours o en las tierras toscanas que acompaÃ±an algunas de sus composiciones. Fragmentado o envuelto en el enigma, el perfil de Toledo responde al capricho de la clientela mÃ¡s culta, habituada al uso de la Historia y de la AntigÃ¼edad.This article describes the various approaches used by El Greco to interpret Toledoâs landscape. Skilled in the use of scenery, which he had learned in his trips to Venice and Rome, he knows how to use Toledoâs architectural landmarks to frame his religious compositions. In this manner, and using his paintbrushes, Toledo metamorphoses into Jerusalem, Troy, Egypt, Tours, or the lands of Tuscany present in some of his works. Fragmented or shrouded in mystery, the profile of Toledo responds to the whims of the most cultured clientele, accustomed to the use of history and antiquity.\n\nPriscilianistas: Actas del I Concilio de Toledo recopiladas por BartolomÃ© Carranza\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRuiz de Pablos, Francisco\n\n2001-06-01\n\nFull Text Available In the current article, the author provides some documents which demonstrate that BartolomÃ© Carranza, (Archbishop from Toledo was the first person who compiled the Â«Actas from the 1st Council of ToledoÂ», against the theory sustained by Chadwick since 1978.\n\nEn el presente artÃ­culo el autor aporta documentos que demuestran que BartolomÃ© Carranza, arzobispo de Toledo, fue el primer recopilador de las Actas del I Concilio de Toledo, en contra de la teorÃ­a sostenida por Chadwick desde 1978.\n\nLa Primera Muestra de Contabilidad por Partida Doble en la Catedral de Toledo. El Manual y Mayor del Racionero Gutierre Hurtado (1535-1536\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSusana Villaluenga de Gracia\n\n2005-06-01\n\nFull Text Available En la lÃ­nea de las investigaciones desarrolladas sobre la contabilidad de las instituciones eclesiÃ¡sticas en EspaÃ±a, este trabajo estudia la que en el siglo XVI fue considerada la sede mÃ¡s rica de la Cristiandad despuÃ©s de Roma, la Catedral de Toledo. Su elevado estatus pudo ser una cuestiÃ³n significativa para influir en el proceso de desarrollo de su sistema de gestiÃ³n y en la adopciÃ³n de prÃ¡cticas contables novedosas. AdemÃ¡s, dentro de la catedral existÃ­an beneficiados con aptitudes para dar soluciÃ³n a cualquier cuestiÃ³n econÃ³mica. MÃ¡s concretamente, uno de ellos, el racionero Gutierre Hurtado, fue el autor de la primera muestra de contabilidad por partida doble en la catedral de Toledo y la primera muestra conocida, hoy por hoy, en el mundo para una entidad eclesiÃ¡stica. En este trabajo se muestran algunos fragmentos sobre su vida y cometido; y los aspectos generales y especiales que caracterizan el mÃ©todo contable usado por este racionero. Para ello, examinaremos los documentos que se conservan en el Archivo de la Catedral de Toledo Palabras clave: Contabilidad eclesiÃ¡stica, partida doble, catedral de Toledo.Through an approach close to the research of the studies on accounting of the religious organizations in Spain, this paper intends to study an entity that was considered the richest see of Christendom after Rome in the 16th century, the Cathedral of Toledo. Its highest level could possibly have been a significant element in the development of sophisticated management and accounting practices in this church. In addition, acting at the cathedral of Toledo, there were men who were capable to manage any economic question. More specifically, one of these prebendaries, Gutierre Hurtado, was the author of the first accounting demonstration for double entry in the cathedral of Toledo and the first one that is known, at the present time, in a religious organization on the world. This paper will show some features of all what we\n\nThe Alfonsine tables of Toledo\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nChabÃ¡s, JosÃ©\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe Alfonsine Tables of Toledo is for historians working in the fields of astronomy, science, the Middle Ages, Spanish and other Romance languages. It is also of interest to scholars interested in the history of Castile, in Castilian-French relations in the Middle Ages and in the history of patronage. It explores the Castilian canons of the Alfonsine Tables and offers a study of their context, language, astronomical content, and diffusion. The Alfonsine Tables of Toledo is unique in that it: includes an edition of a crucial text in history of science; provides an explanation of astronomy as it was practiced in the Middle Ages; presents abundant material on early scientific language in Castilian; presents new material on the diffusion of Alfonsine astronomy in Europe; describes the role of royal patronage of science in a medieval context.\n\nArchaeological evidence for Pott's disease on historical populations: Tomb 05 at the Roman Circus maqbara as an example of social solidarity (Toledo, Spain).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRuiz-Taboada, Arturo; Rodrigo, Isabel Molero\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWorld societies can often be characterized by their attitude towards elderly and illness. It is well known that most cultures were concerned about those who were not able to produce and take care of themselves. This brings to the development of social processes that involve such individuals within the community, resulting in groups who stick together, and at last, ensuring the survival of the group. The contextualization of many of those social processes might be studied through Physical Anthropology and Paleopathology. This paper presents tomb 05 (T-05) as a new case of probable tuberculosis in Toledo from the medieval maqbara of the Roman Circus that provides new paleoanthropological data to understand the treatment given to sick people in a sparsely studied context.\n\n40 CFR 81.43 - Metropolitan Toledo Interstate Air Quality Control Region.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

A review of the size of the community, the present spanish groups and the experiments in which they are involved is given. the importance of the CERN installations will be emphasized by reviewing the activities as well as the strong implication of the spanish larger groups in the LHC project. A growing interest in astroparticle physics and neutrino physics is emerging, with a total of 7 experiments with spanish participation. The two laboratories, hosting astroparticle physics experiments, that have their sites in Spain, will be briefly described: Canfranc-an underground facility-and El roque de los muchachos-the canary islands telescope observatory. A final remark on funding will also be given. (Author)\n\n[Typology of nosocomial architecture on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, XVI century. Enrique Egas' model in Spain and Vasco de Quiroga's model in New Spain].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRodrÃ­guez-Orozco, Alain Raimundo; RodrÃ­guez PÃ©rez, Martha Eugenia\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTwo visions of the nosocomial architecture are discussed, located in a close time period, 1505-1535, but inserted in two different scenarios. One is in the Renaissance Spain, proposed by the architect E. Egas (born in Toledo, Spain), and the other one in the New Spain, proposed by V. de Quiroga, who chose an architectural style coherent with the Franciscan ideals of humbleness and evangelization, which set aside the ornamentation typical of Spanish medieval hospitals rather than palatial monuments built by E. Egas. The \"hospital-village\" project by V. de Quiroga allowed the patients and their families to live together, which was accepted by pre-Hispanic families that in the time were extensive. The hospital-village, both in its typology and in its health conception, returns to designs already in disuse of the Spanish Middle Age by picking up the idea of a hospital as a multifunctional space in which sanitary attention, nurseries, and shelters for poor people were combined within the church.\n\nLa caza mayor y le economÃ­a rural en la provincia de Toledo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez, Ãngel JuliÃ¡n\n\n2004-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Leisure or business? Is it the hunt a really profitable activity? If it is like that, who are the biggest beneficiaries? How it has influenced in the most disadvantaged rural zones? Here there are some of the questions about economic and social reality of hunting, and its answers are tried to be approached in this work, for a confirmed hunting tradition zone as Â«Los Montes de ToledoÂ», in the province of the same name, where are placed the most of the best major hunting areas in the Toledo province. The Mounts of Toledo, due to its excellent natural resources for the hunting and to the crisis of the agrarian traditional utilizations, constitute an area where the major hunt is the most adapted use to contribute to the biological balance with a rational management.\n\n[es] Â¿Ocio o negocio?, Â¿es la caza una actividad verdaderamente rentable?

The TL effect of irradiation with dose 0.8 Mrad is greater than the effect of unirradiated samples at least by one order. The TOLEDO was proved to be able to determine TL intensity as function of absorbed dose and post-irradiation storage time. The measurement procedure is rapid and simple, that expect to be used as a standard control method of irradiated food.

The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the level of habitual physical activity in 8-9 years old schoolchildren from Spain and India. With this purpose, it was administered the questionnaire PACE (Physician-based Assessment and Counseling for Exercise in a sample of 85 schoolchildren (44 from Spain and 41 from India. The results showed that the sample studied does not do enough physical activity, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, as they do at least 60 minutes of physical activity; only an average of 3.13 days/week (SD=1.91. 8-year-old schoolchildren do more physical activity than 9-year-old schoolchildren in both countries; boys do more physical activity than girls in both countries; schoolchildren from India do more physical activity than schoolchildren from Spain. Therefore, it is concluded that the level of physical activity is insufficient, decreases slightly with the age and is higher in India.\n\nViolencia sexual y grupos juveniles en el arzobispado de Toledo durante el siglo XVII : los casos de La Estrella de la Jara\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFernando MartÃ­nez Gil\n\n1999-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Ante los tribunales episcopales de la EspaÃ±a moderna pasÃ³ una variada gama de causas civiles y criminales que iluminan aspectos inÃ©ditos de la cultura popular, los comportamientos y mentalidades de la Ã©poca. El Archivo Diocesano de Toledo guarda innumerables procesos, todavÃ­a sin catalogar, relativos a conductas de religiosos y seglares que causaban escÃ¡ndalo pÃºblico pero que no eran competencia de la InquisiciÃ³n por no atentar contra los principios de la fe.

Cross-sectional study of the general adult population of Spain (n = 2,121). Non-psychotic mental disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) and physical conditions with a checklist. The role functioning dimension of the WHO-Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) was used to asses the number of days in the past month in which respondents were fully or partially limited to perform daily activities. Generalized linear models were used to estimate individual-level associations of specific conditions and role functioning, controlling for co-morbidity. Societal level estimates were calculated using population attributable risk proportions (PARP). Mental disorders and physical conditions showed similar number of days with full role limitation (about 20 days per year); in contrast mental disorders were responsible for twice as many days with partial role limitation than physical conditions (42 vs 21 days, respectively). If the population were entirely unexposed to mental and physical conditions, days with full limitation would be reduced by 73% and days with partial limitation by 41%. Common health conditions in Spain are associated with considerably more days with role limitation than other Western countries. There is need of mainstreaming disability in the Spanish public health agenda in order to reduce role limitation among individuals with common conditions. Copyright Â© 2013 SESPAS.

The outcrops belong to the Caliza de los Navalucillos Formation and they record a considerably high diverse archaeocyath assemblage in the Lower Cambrian successions from the Central Iberian Zone (Julivert et al. 1972 [1974]). In fact, it is first time recorded the presence of Agyrekocyathus, Dokidocyathus, and Plicocyathus in the Central Iberian Zone. Therefore Plicocyathus is no longer exclusive to biozone VI in Spain. The presence of Anthomorpha is characteristic for the early Botomian, presently early Stage 4 (ICS, 2009), and the assemblage corresponds to the biozone VII (late Ovetian, following the biozonation of PerejÃ³n & Moreno-Eiris, 2006). The fossiliferous part of the succession is formed by seven lithofacies, all of them tectonically folded and with a low grade metamorphic overprint. They are comprised by two main groups of facies: (a) mound-shaped to massive lithofacies (A1, A2, A3, A4) and (b) massive to bedded and nodular lithofacies (B1, B2, B3). Archaeocyaths occur in several facies: (A1) mound-shaped white marble with irregular to stromatactoid cavities; (A2) massive mottled white to grey limestone; (A3) massive grey limestone with slumps levels; (A4) massive archaeocyath-rich orange limestone; as well as in carbonate nodules embedded in siltstones and cherts (B1, B2 and B3). The best preserved assemblage comes from the nodule record, where fossils are partially pyritized. This type of preservation is exceptional and has never been described before. XRD and wavelength-dispersive electron microprobe analyses reveal the presence of pyrite and pyrrotine partially altered to iron oxides and hydroxides (hematite and goethite) surrounding the archaeocyath cups. In Central Iberian Zone, the development of mounds and nodular facies like those described here is unusual, although the Botomian marks the peak for Early Cambrian archaeocyathan-microbial mounds\n\nLa organizacion del Cabildo de Jurados de Toledo (1422 1510\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRosa MarÃ­a Montero Tejada\n\n1990-01-01\n\nFull Text Available En 1422 Juan II llevÃ³ a cabo la que fue sin duda mÃ¡s importante reforma en el gobierno municipal de Toledo.

Patients carefully selected what they wore as they entered the hospital to produce certain effects on local audiences. Thus, these choices can be understood as body scripts meant to be read in certain ways rather than mere reflections of actual social status. In a context of gendered and social pressures associated with women's sexuality, female syphilitic patients wore garments meant to emphasize respectability and thereby avoid a loss of reputation.\n\nMoriscos expulsados de Granada y âavecindadosâ en Toledo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRodrÃ­guez de Gracia, Hilario\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The expulsion and resettlement in Castile of thousands of Moriscos from Granada began in November 1570. The first expedition, consisting of 624 people, arrived in Toledo at the end of that month, and all of those from the age of ten were handed over to local citizens to work for them as a way to prevent destitution. The main objective of this part of the article is to analyze the number of each expedition, its origins, the hardships people endured on the journey and their final destination. Studying their work preferences and their location in the parish districts of Toledo is the main point dealt with in the second part of this article. Conclusions are drawn from the powers of attorney made by notary public Blas Hurtado in 1587. In them appear more than four hundred men with their names, occupations and residence. The information allows us to know what their preferred activities were and where within the city they established their residence.La expulsiÃ³n y reparto por Castilla de miles de moriscos granadinos comenzÃ³ en noviembre de 1570.

Over the centuries it has undergone numerous restorations, also according to different criteria. The cathedral is situated in an environment of low aggressivity, in terms of atmospheric contamination, but the passage of time has taken its toll on many structural, architectural and artistic elements. During recent restoration work several metallic elements, which have been exposed for many years or even centuries to the inclemencies of the Toledo climate, were taken in order to analyse their composition and deterioration. The techniques used have been Scanning Electron Microscopy with X-Ray Microprobe (SEM/EDAX, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD. The elements considered are a piece of roofing lead, a lead slate clamp, a piece of stained glass window leading, and an iron nail.\n\nLa Catedral de Toledo se edificÃ³ en un perÃ­odo de mÃ¡s de 200 aÃ±os, bajo numerosos criterios de construcciÃ³n que se reflejan en la multiplicidad de estilos que alberga (entre mudÃ©jar y gÃ³tico, con aportaciones flamencas, barrocas y renacentistas.

[Downtown Toledo steam system\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWatt, J.R.; Sommerfield, G.A.\n\n1979-08-01\n\nEach of the tasks is described separately: Task 1 - Demonstration Team; Task 2 - Identify Thermal Energy Source(s) and Potential Service Area(s); and Task 3 - Energy Market Analysis. The purpose of the project is to establish and implement measures in the downtown Toledo steam system for conserving scarce fuel supplies through cogeneration, by retrofit of existing base- or intermediate-loaded electric-generating plants to provide for central heating and cooling systems, with the ultimate purpose of applying the results to other communities. For Task 1, Toledo Edison Company has organized a Demonstration Team (Battelle Columbus Laboratories; Stone and Webster; Ohio Dept. of Energy; Public Utilities Commission of Ohio; Toledo Metropolitan Area Council of Governments; and Toledo Edison) that it hopes has the expertise to evaluate the technical, legal, economic, and marketing issues related to the utilization of by-product heat from power generation to supply district heating and cooling services. Task 2 gives a complete technical description of the candidate plant(s), its thermodynamic cycle, role in load dispatch, ownership, and location. It is concluded that the Toledo steam distribution system can be the starting point for developing a new district-heating system to serve an expanding market. Battelle is a member of the team employed as a subcontractor to complete the energy market analysis. The work is summarized in Task 3.

One of the most important specific qualities of the Islamic civilization is that it is a well-balanced civilization that brought together science and faith, struck a balance between spirit and matter and did not separate this world from the Hereafter. This is what distinguishes the Islamic civilization from other civilizations which attach primary importance to the material aspect of life, physical needs and human instincts, and attach greater attention to this world by striving to instantly satisfy desires of the flesh, without finding a proper place for God and the Hereafter in their philosophies and education systems. The Islamic civilization drew humankind closer to God, connected the earth and heavens, subordinated this world to the Hereafter, connected spirit and matter, struck a balance between mind and heart, and created a link between science and faith by elevating the importance of moral development to the level of importance of material progress. It is owing to this that the Islamic civilization gave an immense contribution to the development of global civilization. Another specific characteristic of the Islamic civilization is that it spread the spirit of justice, impartiality and tolerance among people. The result was that people of different beliefs and views lived together in safety, peace and mutual respect, and that mosques stood next to churches, monasteries and synagogues in the lands that were governed by Muslims. This stems primarily from the commandments of the noble Islam according to which nobody must be forced to convert from their religion and beliefs since freedom of religion is guaranteed within the Islamic order. The Islamic civilization in Spain encompasses many fields that left a profound imprint in the Iberian Peninsula and Europe. The cultural climate of Spain in the era of Muslim rule (711\n\nThe Toledo QurâÄn and Islamic Eschatology: Translating the Names of Hell in Aljamiado Literature\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTottoli, Roberto\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The introduction of the Toledo QurâÄn states that the text in the Latin alphabet was copied from an Aljamiado translation. In fact, the translation of terms and expressions relating to hell shows some specific characteristics of Aljamiado literature, such as the privileged use of calques from Arabic and a preference for the term Jahannam, though the most quoted term al-nÄr (âfuegoâ is also attested. These characteristics are more evident when compared to Latin translations prior or contemporaneous to the Toledo QurâÄn. It is clear that in the translation of terms related to hell, these works display greater attention to Latin style and final result thus evidencing another perspective and consequently another audience. The preference given to the term Jahannam is closely linked to the evidence emerging from the Aljamiado eschatological literature, where Jahannam is generally preferred to al-nÄr/ âfuego.â This preference reflects more than specific characteristics of the literature of the Moriscos, an evolution of Muslim literature as a whole, which is reflected in the kind of literary materials circulating and trasmitted. Futher, along with this, Aljamiado literature on hell and also the Toledo QurâÄn reflect similar developments in the late medieval Muslim Arabic literature, and therefore also in eschatological traditions, in which Jahannam emerges strongly as the term used to describe hell in narratives.La introducciÃ³n del CorÃ¡n de Toledo dice que el texto en alfabeto latino se copiÃ³ de una traducciÃ³n aljamiada.

However, some studies have revealed potential risks to these types of social relationships. Different authors have indicated that dating violence among adolescents is an issue for concern. To date, there has been little research on this topic cross-nationally. This study examined and compared the prevalence and characteristics of physical dating violence among young people aged between 15 and 18 years in England and Spain (N = 200 in Spain, N = 199 in England), and how being involved (or not) in this violence relates to romantic relationship quality. Results indicated that approximately 23% of young people reported victimization and 30% reported perpetrating physical dating violence. In both countries, most of those involved in physical dating violence reported involvement in reciprocal violence (displaying both aggression and victimization). Those young people involved in dating violence reported higher levels on scales assessing negative aspects of relationship quality compared with those not involved, but there were no significant differences in positive aspects of relationship quality. Furthermore, different patterns appeared relating to the severity of violence and country. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theory and practice.

The meeting was organized by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) in collaboration with CIEMAT. It was supported by the Programa Nacional de Fisica de Altas Energias, by UCM and CIEMAT. As in previous editions, it brought together researchers working in experimental and theoretical Particle and Astroparticle Physics. More than seventy physicists from several countries participated in the Meeting. General talks, most recent results and time for physics discussions were considered in the program. In parallel to the development of the Meeting several other events took place. These events included a meeting to study the future of the Spanish Program of Advanced Studies in Theoretical High Energy Physics, an informal meeting to study the future for detection of high energy neutrino beams with underground detectors in the Canary Islands and another one concerning the PDGE /Proyecto Data Grid Espana). In addition we had the last day a special seminar in the honour of the 60th anniversary of Professor Yndurain. Francisco J. Yndurain played a leading role in the development of High Energy Physics in Spain and all over he was one of the founders of the International Meeting on Fundamental Physics in 1973 (in those days called International Winter Meeting on Fundamental Physics). The efficient assistance of M. Fatas in the organization of the conference is warmly appreciated. We thank R. Pascual for helping us to find the excellent hotel Calipolis where the meeting took place. We are deeply indebted to M. J. Josa and to the HEGRA people form the UCM for their valuable technical assistance along the entire process of preparing the Meeting. We also thank J. C. Gonzalez and M. Lopez for their effort in the preparation of these proceedings and finally to p. Seoane for the design of the poster, advertisements and the logo of the Meeting.

In this search the cities will erect as the pillars on which to build the frame of a Crown energetic and authoritarian. Local elites, who had in their hands the governments of the cities, eventually became a factor basic in the stability or instability of the kingdom. One of the Castilian cities in which the influence of elites was more visible was Toledo, whose insurgent activity in the fifteenth century could be compared to other famous by factional attitude european cities, such as Ghent and Florence. The social elite of Toledo projections during the reigns of John II, Henry IV and Elisabeth I come from a model in two ways: in their ability to shock people, causing riots and deaths, but also relating to pacification measures in times of calm, in order to promote their own domain, submission of the city to the kings and prosperity of the region.\n\nA Phase 1 Study of 4 Live, Recombinant Human Cytomegalovirus Towne/Toledo Chimera Vaccines in Cytomegalovirus-Seronegative Men.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAdler, Stuart P; Manganello, Anne-Marie; Lee, Ronzo; McVoy, Michael A; Nixon, Daniel E; Plotkin, Stanley; Mocarski, Edward; Cox, Josephine H; Fast, Patricia E; Nesterenko, Pavlo A; Murray, Susan E; Hill, Ann B; Kemble, George\n\n2016-11-01\n\nâHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection causes disease in newborns and transplant recipients.

M.; Santos, A.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nSpain was a scientifically backward country in the early 19th-century. The causes were various political events, the War of Independence, and the reign of Fernando VII. The introduction of contemporary physics into textbooks was therefore a slow process. An analysis of the contents of 19th-century Spanish textbooks is here presented, centred on imponderable fluids, the concept of energy, the mechanical theory of heat, and the kinetic theory of gases.\n\nThe (In)Visibility of Gender Knowledge in the Physical Activity and Sport Science Degree in Spain\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSerra, Pedrona; Soler, Susanna; Prat, Maria; Vizcarra, MarÃ­a Teresa; Garay, Beatriz; Flintoff, Anne\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper draws on research that aimed to explore the construction of gender relations in sport and physical education (PE) through a national study of Spanish university degree curricula.

For the last 3 years, we have trained up to 21 undergraduates (primarily physics/astronomy majors) in a given academic semester, ranging from freshman to seniors. Various projects are currently being conducted by undergraduate students with guidance from graduate student mentors, including constructing three-color images, observations of transiting exoplanets, and determination of binary star orbits from echelle spectra. This academic year we initiated a large group research project to help students learn about the databases, journal repositories, and online observing tools astronomers use for day-to-day research. We discuss early inclusion in observational astronomy and research of these students and the impact it has on departmental retention, undergraduate involvement, and academic success.\n\nInfluencia del medio fÃ­sico en el origen y evoluciÃ³n de la trama urbana de la ciudad de Toledo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosÃ© FariÃ±a Tojo\n\n1993-04-01\n\nThis paper attempts to identify the City of Toledo main urban elements. Due to the special characteristics of the site, a special method that emphasizes the study of the physical environment is used. In this way, an analysis of the relationships between the natural, topographical and climatic characteristics, and the evolution of the urban form, with special regards to the wall system, is presented. With this method five structural axes are identified: one formed by the streets \"Del Barco\" and \"Pozo Amargo\", the one of the \"Puerta de San Sebastian\", the one of \"Tendillas\" and \"Nuncio Nuevo\", and finally, the one of the \"Antequeruela\". This scheme is completed with other physical corridors. Finally, a main collector articulating all the system elements is also detected. It is shaped by the streets of \"Angel\", \"Santo TomÃ©\", \"Trinidad\", \"Hombre de Palo\" and \"Comercio\", and connects the old inner gates of \"Assuica\" and \"de la Sangre\".\n\nSocializing Agents for Sport and Physical Activities in Teenage Students: Comparative Studies in Samples From Costa Rica, Mexico, and Spain.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRuiz-Juan, Francisco; Baena-Extremera, Antonio; Granero-Gallegos, Antonio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to analyze a set of socializing agents for sport and physical activities and to establish their relationship with leisure time sport and physical activities behaviors and practice patterns in samples of teenage students with different sociocultural backgrounds. The sample included 2168 students in their first year of secondary education, 423 of them being from Costa Rica, 408 from Mexico, and 1337 from Spain (1052 male students, 1037 female students, and 79 students who did not specify gender) aged 11-16 years old ( Mâ=â12.49; SDâ=â.81). A validated questionnaire with questions about leisure time sport and physical activities and socializing agents was used. Descriptive, inferential, and multinomial logistic regression analyses were carried out with SPSS 17.0 to compare all three countries. Costa Rica had the most active students, best friends' inactivity, and unsupportive parents being the agents predicting inactivity and a low level of sport and physical activities. Mexico has a high dropout rate and inactive students exceed active ones; no agent predicts inactivity or sport and physical activities pattern. Spain has the highest level of sport and physical activities practice, and parents, siblings, and friends are predicting agents of inactivity together with unsupportive parents and friends.\n\nArte rupestre paleolÃ­tico y postpaleolÃ­tico al aire libre en los Montes de Toledo occidentales (Toledo, Castilla - La Mancha, EspaÃ±a: noticia preliminar\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJesÃºs F.

Here we analyze lead concentrations in bones (n = 84), livers (n = 15), primary feathers (n = 69), secondary feathers (n = 71) and blood feathers (n = 14) of 85 individuals collected between 1997 and 2008 in central Spain. Three birds (3.6%) had bone lead concentration > 20 (mu or u)g/g and all livers were within background lead concentration. Bone lead concentrations increased with the age of the birds and were correlated with lead concentration in rachis of secondary feathers. Spatial aggregation of elevated bone lead concentration was found in some areas of Montes de Toledo. Lead concentrations in feathers were positively associated with the density of large game animals in the area where birds were found dead or injured. Discontinuous lead exposure in eagles was evidenced by differences in lead concentration in longitudinal portions of the rachis of feathers.\n\nPhysical activity and gender: comparative study between adolescents from Monterrey, Mexico and Zaragoza, Spain.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOswaldo Ceballos Gurrola\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose of this study is to compare medium energy expenditure and levels of physical activity between adolescents from Monterrey, Mexico and Zaragoza, Spain taking into consideration variables such as gender, type of school, and time of the week.Â Methods: adolescent students of 12 to 17 years of age from public and private schools in Monterrey (N= 396 and Zaragoza (N= 394.Â The Four-by-One-Day Physical Activity Questionnaire was used and a .89 reliability with a test-retest because the test was adapted to this study.Â Results: In Zaragoza as well as in Monterrey there is a significant number of students with low levels of physical activity.Â Almost half of the students have been classified as inactive and very inactive.Â The energy expenditure was very similar for both cities: Monterrey 37.52 Â± 2.12 kcal/kg/day and Zaragoza 37.66 Â± 2.95 kcal/kg/day.Â Conclusions: Regarding gender, men show greater levels of physical activity than women.Â This data coincides with the majority of the studies.Â Students perform a higher level of physical activity during school days than during weekends.\n\nA computerized traffic control algorithm to determine optimal traffic signal settings.

Named ''Alexfest'', it gathered friends and very prominent physicists from around the world that came to Brazil specially to render a tribute to Alex, as many friends and colleagues called him. During the whole afternoon, the invited speakers presented some of the physics topics and important contributions that Alex gave to the field of nuclear physics during his five decades of intense work. Alex is the responsible for several landmarks in the Brazilian nuclear science, especially in the Institute of Physics of the University of Sao Paulo (IFUSP), where he spent almost his entire career. He started his professional life in the IFUSP Van de Graaf Laboratory, under Oscar Sala's supervision as an undergraduate student. His talent allowed him to give significant contributions to the machine operation since the beginning of his internship in the laboratory. He soon became the responsible for the development, construction and implementation of an ion source for the new Pelletron accelerator, project coordinated by Oscar Sala as well. This was a huge responsibility for a young master degree student. His PhD thesis was about nuclear fusion, a topic that he mastered during his career. His international reputation allowed him to become a visiting researcher at several laboratories in the US, France, Japan, Russia and Germany. Not satisfied with the challenges that his career was imposing to him, Alex pioneered the creation of a high-energy nuclear physics group in Brazil, becoming member of the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At Rhic) collaboration in 1995, one of the two major experiments of the RHIC accelerator (Relativistic heavy Ion Collider), located in the Brookhaven National Laboratory, USA. Later on, in 2006, he also led his group to become part of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) experiment ALICE (A\n\n[Adiposity and psychological well-being: effects of physical activity on university students in Valencia, Spain].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCastillo, Isabel; Molina-GarcÃ­a, Javier\n\n2009-10-01\n\nTo determine, through the use of a structural equation model, the relationships that exist between physical activity, body fat, perceived physical ability, and three indicators of psychological well-being, in a sample of Spanish university students. A descriptive cross-sectional study of 639 students 18-29 years of age representative of the universities of Valencia, Spain, during the 2005-2006 term. Physical exercise was rated by taking an inventory of healthy behaviors among students. The following scales were applied: self-perceived physical ability, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, and subjective vitality. Body fat was expressed as the percentage of fat mass (PFM). A theoretical model was devised using six measured variables. The participants' level of physical activity was moderate; they perceived themselves to be physically competent; had high self-esteem; were satisfied with life; and had high vitality. Physical activity was negatively correlated with PFM in men and women alike; and negatively associated with perceived physical ability; while perceived physical ability was positively associated with self-esteem, life satisfaction, and subjective vitality. The effect of physical activity on perceived competence was mediated in part by PFM in men. In women, exercise was directly correlated to PFM, as well as perceived ability, without PFM mediation. Increased physical activity is of great value to public health because, in addition to helping to reduce body fat, it improves psychological well-being and self-image.\n\nArabicizing, Privileges, and Liturgy in Medieval Castilian Toledo: The Problems and Mutations of Mozarab Identification (1085-1436)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMoreno, Aaron Michael\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMost approaches to the history of Mozarabs (Christians with lineal roots in Muslim-ruled Iberia) in Castilian Toledo are framed within linear narratives of assimilation, treating the fates of their communal linguistic, legal, and liturgical traits--that is, the use of Arabic, the enjoyment of communal-specific juridical privileges, and the adherence to the traditional Spanish rite--as a metric for gauging the vitality of their identities.

Esta exigencia surge, a su vez, de lo acordado en los concilios, cuyos cÃ¡nones, una vez publicados, tomaban forma en los sÃ­nodos diocesanos para acomodarlos a necesidades concretas, integrÃ¡ndose despuÃ©s en la normativa interna de las corporaciones religiosas.Habida cuenta de esta Ãºltima documentaciÃ³n referida a la Iglesia de Toledo, estudiaremos la figura de los visitadores y contadores, nombrados para supervisar y controlar el correcto funcionamiento de la instituciÃ³n, salvando asÃ­ la responsabilidad del Cabildo en la administraciÃ³n temporal y espiritual de los bienes eclesiÃ¡sticos. Al mismo tiempo, haremos hincapiÃ© en los instrumentos de control: el inventario y el mÃ©todo de cargo y data o descargo. Finalmente, nos centraremos en la actuaciÃ³n de los contadores, encargados de tomar la cuenta a los responsables de los diferentes centros donde se manejaba particularmente el dinero en efectivo de cada lote de rentas vinculado a un fin concreto.This paper provides empirical evidence on the existence of an important monitoring device and physical control and accounting in the Church, aimed at ensuring the conservation of ecclesiastical heritage and the proper management of their revenues, avoiding extravagance, ensuring an appropriate use of these revenues, and demanding responsibilities to those held accountable in that regard. This requirement arises, in turn, from measures agreed by the Councils, whose canons, once published, were collected in diocesan synods and in the internal normative to meet the specific needs of the different religious organisations.Given this latest documentation\n\nLeisure-time physical activity and prevalence of non-communicable pathologies and prescription medication in Spain.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFernandez-Navarro, Pablo; Aragones, MarÃ­a Teresa; Ley, Victoria\n\n2018-01-01\n\nOur aims were to describe physical activity (PA) behaviour in Spain and to examine its association with the prevalence of some of the major non-communicable diseases and with the use of prescription medication. Individualized secondary data retrieved from the 2014 European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) for Spain were used to conduct a cross-sectional epidemiological study (n = 18926). PA was assessed by two different measures: a specific designed variable for EHIS and a leisure time PA frequency-based query of the national survey. Diseases analyzed were hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, depression and anxiety. The use of prescription medication was also included in the study. Weighted percentages were computed and contingency tables were calculated to describe PA by levels of the traits and sociodemographic characteristics. Chi-square test was used to compare percentages between groups and weighted logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between PA and the prevalence of the disease. About 73% of the Spanish population performs no PA at all or only occasionally during their leisure time, and only one third meets minimum PA international guidelines (â¥ 150min/week). Men are considerably more active than women and less PA is observed as the education level decreases and as age increases. The risk of the diseases evaluated was up to three times higher among inactive individuals. This study provides national population-based estimations highlighting the impact of PA in Spain, not only in the prevalence of some of the major non-communicable diseases but also in reducing prescription medication, and the potential sex and socioeconomic influence.\n\n77 FR 64718 - Safety Zone; Steam Ship Col.

The methodology for analyzing the consumer behavior are the models of discrete choice based on the Theory of Random Utility. These models are based on the definition of preferences through a utility function that is maximized. These models also denominated of disaggregated demand derived from the decision of a set of individuals, who are formalized by the application of probabilistic models. The objective of this study is to determine the behavior of the consumer in the choice of a service, namely of transport services and in a short-distance corridor, such as Toledo-Madrid. The Toledo-Madrid corridor is characterized by being short distance, with high speed train available within the choice options to get the airport, along with the bus and the car. And where offers of HST and aircraft services can be proposed as complementary modes. By applying disaggregated transport models with revealed preference survey data and declared preferences, one can determine the most important variables involved in the choice and determine the arrangements for payment of individuals. These payment provisions may condition the use of certain transport policies to promote the use of efficient transportation.
