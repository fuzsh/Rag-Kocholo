The first part of the paper briefly presents the wider context of strengthening and preserving heritage churches and monastic buildings and describes the architectural setting and the structural features of the traditional Romanian Orthodox churches. The second part of the paper is a case study related to the rehabilitation of a medieval heritage church, which is the paramount building of a larger monastic complex. Erected in 1496, the church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary closely follows the medieval traditional Orthodox patterns from both architectural and structural points of view. Structural assessment and diagnosis revealed that degradations were induced and developed throughout the life of the structure due to approximately 24 earthquakes (estimated at over 6.0 magnitude) having endangered the structural safety of the building and the mural iconography. After the structural diagnosis, a combined and complex method of strengthening consisting of both grouting and introducing steel rods in vertically drilled galleries along the entire height of the walls was selected. The main advantage of applying this combined strengthening strategy was a remarkable enhancement of the structural seismic performance of the church building.

It reflects the developmental potential and competitiveness of the economy or an economic system. An objective and reasonable assessment framework of the production efficiency in the construction industry is essential to promote the industry’s high-quality development. This study aims to propose a scientific and holistic framework to examine the production efficiency in the construction industry and to investigate evolution patterns from a macroeconomic perspective. Input and output indicators were identified through the value-added and the fuzzy Delphi methods. In addition, the production efficiency in the construction industry was examined via the bootstrap-DEA and Malmquist exponential decomposition models. A case study in China was conducted at the end of this research. The panel data of 31 provinces from 2010 to 2020 were applied in the case study. The results reveal the following: (1) The bootstrap-DEA model results show that the trends of production efficiency before and after rectification are similar, but the difference is largest at the peak. Moreover, the production efficiency value after correction is evidently lower than that which is obtained by the traditional DEA model. (2) The Malmquist index decomposition results show that the change trend of technical efficiency in the construction industry is contrary to that of the scale efficiency. In addition, the improvement of scale efficiency cannot bring a melioration of management efficiency or the accumulation of production experience. (3) There is no direct correlation between production efficiency and economic development. High-value areas and median areas are contiguous, and they are mainly distributed in the central and eastern provinces. The findings accurately reflect construction industry productivity, providing practical data for developing policy recommendations for bridging regional construction development gaps.

Within this building sector, there is a growing attention toward development and adoption of energy efficient retrofit strategies. Plagued by the lack of efforts in achieving comprehensive energy efficient retrofit solution sets (passive, active, and renewable energy systems), the authors acknowledge the concept of NZEB toward achieving energy efficiency by 2050. Toward this end, a numerical energy simulation modeling is carried out to retrofit an existing French “Puccini house” using ‘passive, energy efficient building systems and renewable energy’ strategies toward an NZEB target in the Mediterranean climate of Nice. Using Design builder 7.0, the simulated baseline energy model (Case A) is retrofitted through variations in the proposed energy efficient retrofit measures using two case scenarios (Case B: passive retrofit; Case C: energy-efficient building) to achieve NZEB (Case D). Assessing the performance of energy efficient retrofits using % energy reduction, the implementation of a high-performance building envelope is achieved using a thermally insulated external wall (46.82%), upgraded airtightness (20.39%), thermally insulated pitched roof component (33.03%), and high-performance window type—a glazing system (3.35%) with maximized window-to-wall ratio (5.53%). The maximum energy-saving retrofit solutions provide an ambitious reduction in energy consumption by approximately 90% from the baseline. A deep retrofitting of the French house meets the NZEB targets, as it reduces the baseline energy consumption from 194.37 kWh/m2/year to 23.98 kWh/m2/year using both passive and active strategies. The remaining energy demand is met by the integration of on-site PV panels (EUI= −27.71 kWh/m2/year), which achieve an increase in energy production by 15.5%, while returning energy back to the grid (−3.73 kWh/m2/year). Findings of this study serve as a guideline for retrofitting traditional French single-family residences, while contributing toward the NZEB goal.

Using a computer simulation analysis of the gray correlation, taking Mohan port–Yunnan economic hinterland as an example, the relationship between Mohan port and the Yunnan economic hinterland was quantitatively measured based on the indicators of cross-border tourism from 2006 to 2020. The study aimed to identify the driving mechanisms behind the synchronized development of Mohan port–Yunnan economic hinterland. The results are as follows: (1) due to the influence of administrative interventions and the competition of the neighboring ports, the correlation between the Mohan port and the Yunnan hinterland from 2006 to 2020 showed a rising–falling trend; (2) the correlation between the Mohan port and Xishuangbanna prefecture showed an obvious fluctuating trend, and the original port–city development relationship evolved to a competitive status; (3) the degree of spatial correlation of the Mohan port–Yunnan hinterland system evolved in a north–south-central–south direction, with “border zone–central region–northern region” distribution characteristics; (4) the natural conditions of the location, national policies, competition of nearby ports, infrastructure and traffic conditions, and economic strength are the main driving factors affecting the correlation change between Mohan port and the Yunnan hinterland. These findings can help enrich the theoretical research system of buildings economics, and expand the application of computational decision-making support in tourism spatial optimization.

However, research on topology optimization using the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization method is limited. Accordingly, this study optimized the topology of the stiffening effect of steel plate shear walls (SPSWs) based on this method. A finite element model of the SPSW was established using Abaqus software through the “sandwich” modeling method. An optimization region was expanded into two optimization regions. As the optimization targets, SPSWs with different aspect ratios were selected. Elastoplastic optimization of a single-layer SPSW was performed through the horizontal displacement cyclic loading, and the distribution law of the stiffening effect was obtained. The stiffeners on the SPSW were arranged according to the SPSW-A075 scheme. Monotonic and reciprocating loading simulation tests were performed on the unstiffened SPSW and common transverse and longitudinal stiffeners to analyze their mechanical properties. The results show that the optimized layout of the stiffened SPSW demonstrated better seismic performance and energy dissipation capacity. The buckling bearing capacity increased by 2.17–2.61 times, and the stiffness and initial stiffness improved significantly.

The first stage of the site characterization is identifying collapsible soils, since these are problematic soils. Seismic cone testing (SCPT) has been increasingly used for site characterization, because it allows combining stratigraphic logging with the maximum shear modulus (G0) determination. In this paper, laboratory and in-situ tests carried out at 21 sites with collapsible and non-collapsible soils are interpreted to differentiate between such soils, based on the seismic cone test (SCPT). Collapsible soils have G0/qc values greater than 23 and qc1 values less than 70, while non-collapsible soils have G0/qc values less than 23 and qc1 values greater than 70. The investigated collapsible soils have microstructure (bonding/cementation), but the classical approach cannot be sufficient to identify collapsible soils alone. An approach was used to identify collapsible soils based on maximum shear modulus (G0), normalized cone resistance (qc1), and cone resistance (qc). The chart G0/qc versus qc1 and boundaries is an alternative for distinguishing between collapsible and non-collapsible soils in the early stage of site investigation. This qualitative approach should be used in the preliminary investigation phase to select potentially collapsible soils and helps guide the sampling of potentially collapsible soils for laboratory testing. Further SCPT data from different soil types, particularly the collapsible ones, are valuable to adjust or confirm the boundary equations suggested.

Approximately 37% of energy consumption belongs to the building sector, and management of building energy is a critical factor. In this paper, we present an energy sharing scenario for energy stabilization, assuming that electric vehicles and their charging stations are widely distributed in the future. Consequently, fewer fuel cars will exist, and electric cars will become the major mode of transportation. Therefore, it is essential to install charging stations for electric vehicles in the parking lots of future buildings, and business models are expected to expand. In this paper, we introduce a future energy stabilization mechanism for peak power management in buildings and present a platform that entails connection-based energy trading technology based on a scenario. We also propose an energy supply strategy to prevent excess prices incurred due to peak consumption. Then, we analyzed the electricity bill for one month through scenario-based simulations of an existing building and the proposed system. When applying the proposed system, we derived a result that can reduce electricity rates by 38.3% (best case) to 78.5% (worst case) compared with the existing rates.

The force process of the tower-line structure is a combination of instantaneous and continuously stressed, so it is not accurate to judge the safety of the transmission line based only on the operation status of the transmission tower or the conductor. In this paper, a finite element model of three towers and two lines with large span and large elevation differences is established by taking into account the tower-line coupling system. From the static point of view, the static axial force of a single tower and the contribution rate of wind and ice load are analyzed, and the ultimate bearing capacity of a tension-type electric tower is obtained by considering the bending effect and critical initial defects. From the perspective of transient dynamic response, the displacement of the tower-line coupling system under wind–ice load is calculated, and the force characteristics and force transmission process of the straight tower under wind–ice load are observed. Multiple comparison models are set up to compare and analyze the sway and tension under large span and large elevation differences, and the maximum icing thickness of each group model is obtained by repeated trials. The experimental results show that under the tower-line coupling system, the contribution of wind load to the axial force of the main material is 72.92%, and the contribution of wind–ice load to the axial force of main material is 27.6%. The maximum increase tension under transient ice-off effect is 59.58%, the ultimate force of the tension tower is 545.5 kN, and the maximum icing thickness of the transmission line under large span and large elevation differences is 28.7 cm, which is slightly larger than the design icing thickness. In conclusion, this paper can provide reference for the construction of mountain transmission towers, power safety inspection, and line health status assessment.

Although the technology offers a wide variety of structural, economic, and environmental benefits, it is still restricted in use due to certain limitations that are still under research. This paper explains the fundamentals of the 3D printing process, its potential, challenges, as well as the different 3D printing systems. The recent literature is explored for recommended materials that possess the required properties for 3D printing, as well as reinforcement methods and techniques. This paper also reviews 3D printing extrusion using concrete and foam and explores the effect of both materials and extruding systems on the final product. The application of different additive construction systems with Building Information Modeling (BIM)-integrated algorithms are also discussed in this paper. It is believed that with providing a comprehensive knowledge of 3D printing for concrete construction, there is a huge potential to change the way cementitious materials are formulated and sustainability aspects are implemented, especially for complicated designs.

The cross-sectional loss in the structural members due to corrosion reduces the load-carrying capacity of the members and the stability of their structures. In this study, the main reasons for the collapse of three steel sports infrastructure facilities after moderate snowfall were investigated by conducting field observations and detailed numerical analyses. Finite element models of the structures were developed by considering the effects of different rafter systems and corrosion damage at their columns’ support regions. The load-carrying capacity ratios and stress distributions of the structural members were determined under the effect of the snow load at the time of the collapse. The analysis results were consistent with the damage modes observed during site inspections. The snowfall was not the primary cause of the collapse; however, the section and joint losses due to excessive corrosion, improper erections, and discrepancies between the design project and the as-built project were the main reasons for the collapse.

Changes in project management approaches are urgently required in construction organizations to better align digital technology and organizational conditions. However, little literature has explored the pivotal role of the project management approach from an organizational perspective. To fill this gap, this research investigates ways of using a project governance model for integration to promote the digitalization of construction projects through a case study. The three integration dimensions, namely stakeholder integration, lifecycle integration, and project management knowledge integration, are identified, and governance elements under each dimension are displayed—and further stratified—based on the three levels of the governance model, including institutional level, organizational level, and behavioral level. The logical relationship between elements and their roles in project digitization is finally summarized. The developed conceptual model will provide an approach for construction enterprises to promote project digitalization.

Few researchers have investigated the effectiveness of the fastening techniques without a bonding agent to overcome the undesirable debonding failure of the bonded FRP–steel system. This paper reports the outcomes of experimental and numerical investigations conducted on steel beams strengthened by HFRP using steel bolts. Twenty-two steel beams were tested in four-point loading to investigate the effect of the HFRP length and the bolt arrangement on the flexural behavior of the strengthened systems. The observed failure modes, load-deflection relations, deflection profiles, and strain measurements were also studied. The tested beams showed a ductile behavior, with 15.1 and 22.2% enhancements in the yield and ultimate flexural capacities, respectively. Simplified empirical equations were developed to predict the ultimate load of the bolted HFRP–steel beams. ANSYS software was used to model the beams’ behavior and investigate the effects of the HFRP thickness, bolt spacing, steel grade, loading scheme, and beam length on the effectiveness of the adopted fastening technique. Increasing the HFRP length enhanced the utilization of HFRPs as well as the beam’s ductility, with a reduction of up to 51.2% in the mid-span deflection. Moreover, the strain compatibility of the HFRP–steel beams was improved with an 87.2% reduction in the interfacial slippage. The bolt arrangement showed an insignificant effect on the overall performance of the beams. The numerical results verified the effectiveness of the fastening technique in enhancing the flexural performance of the steel beams, with gains of up to 16.7% and 34.5% in the yield and ultimate load-carrying capacities, respectively.

So, because of this fact, buildings have been improved in terms of their thermal and energy efficiency. Regarding this, the Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 15.575-4/2013 set minimum parameters for the thermal transmittance and thermal capacity of sealing elements, which allow classifying the thermal efficiency of the building. In order to comply with the requirements, the usage and study of lightweight construction materials have been in focus. An example of these materials is vermiculite. The present research reviewed articles about expanded vermiculite. The study involved the examination and comparison of various articles to analyze the properties of vermiculite and the impact of its usage on coating mortars. It was possible to verify that using vermiculite in mortars caused bad workability and a decrease in mechanical strength. However, the porosity and water absorption in mortars increased. Additionally, it reduced the specific weight and the thermal conductivity of the mortars, allowing for a better thermal insulation of the rooms. As an alternative to decreasing the negative effects of vermiculite, it is possible to use chemical admixtures, mineral additions, and mix design with a greater consumption of binder or a combination of particle sizes.

Exoskeletons and exosuits (collectively called EXOs here) are designed to protect workers from these injuries by reducing exertion and muscle fatigue during work. However, the usability of EXOs in construction is still not clear. This is because extant EXO assessments in construction were mainly conducted in laboratory environments with test participants who are not construction professionals. In this research, we conducted a pilot study to investigate the usability of EXOs in a real construction workplace. Four experienced workers were recruited to push/empty construction gondolas with and without a Back-Support EXO, HeroWear Apex. Three workers were recruited to install/remove wooden blocks between steel studs with and without two Arm-Support EXOs, i.e., Ekso EVO and Hilti EXO-001. Their motions, postures, heart rates, and task completion times were recorded and compared. The workers were also surveyed to gather their attitudes toward the EXO’s usefulness and ease of use. The study results demonstrated that the workers responded to the use of EXOs differently and consequently were not unanimously in favor of EXO adoption in practice. The preliminary results and findings from this pilot study help in building a foundation of understanding to improve EXO products to fit the needs of construction workers and foster EXO-enabled construction tasks in the future.

This paper is based on the premise that collaborative design processes, or co-design, used in collaborative housing (CH) in Europe reduce building costs and consequently increase the affordability of these housing projects. However, research remains scarce on the extent to which CH is an affordable solution from a design perspective compared to affordable mainstream housing (MH), in which no co-design is used. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by assessing the impact of design choices on building costs in CH and MH. To this end, we developed a simulation model to compare the building costs of CH with MH based on their design choices. Findings indicate that CH represents a more affordable and space-efficient solution when compared to MH, if we look at the building costs per unit. This is because CH provides less expensive units while it includes larger common spaces and extra quality. These results help to refute existing claims about the unaffordability of CH design solutions.

With the rapid development of engineering construction in China, steel formwork concrete structures, characterized by convenient construction, good seismic performance, and high strength, are expected to be more extensively applied in engineering practice. However, the bearing capacity of different forms of steel formwork concrete is still unclear. Two prefabricated columns with different internal diaphragm styles were set up for axial compression tests to investigate the performance of steel formwork columns. This study conducts monotonic static loading tests on six prefabricated steel tube column specimens and performs finite element analysis by taking steel tube thickness, rebar diameter, and internal diaphragm style as the influencing parameters. The results show that the prefabricated specimens can work in the test process, and the ultimate bearing capacity is consistent between the tests and numerical simulation. Moreover, the nephograms obtained from numerical simulation also conformed to the failure mode of the specimens in the test process. Therefore, the finite element model proposed in this study can accurately predict the stress performance of steel formwork concrete stub columns. These results offer guidance for future engineering practices.

Many studies have been developed in recent years with the aim of solving problems in various fields of structural engineering with the aid of intelligent algorithms; however, when it comes to the optimization of structural designs, the approaches considered by the authors involve a large number of variables and constraints, making the implementation of optimization techniques difficult and consuming significant processing time. This research aims to evaluate the efficiency of intelligent algorithms when associated with structural optimization approaches that are simpler to implement. Therefore, a Genetic Algorithm in Real Coding was built to serve as an auxiliary tool for pre-dimensioning prestressed concrete beams. With this, the problem becomes simpler to implement, as it depends on a smaller number of variables, leading to less processing time consumption. Simulations were performed to calibrate the Genetic Algorithm and find the optimal solution later. The solution found by the algorithm was compared with the real solution of a project that had already gone through a traditional optimization process. Even in these circumstances, the proposed Genetic Algorithm was able to find, in 210 s, a more economical solution. Our studies found that even with more straightforward approaches, intelligent algorithms can help in the search for optimal solutions to structural engineering problems; in addition, using real coding in fact proved to be a great strategy due to the nature of the problem, making the implementation of the algorithm simpler and ensuring answers with little processing time.

The amount of straw fiber incorporated included different percentages of the gelling material mass: 0% (reference specimen), 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10%. The study focused on the concrete’s compressive strength, permeability, and thermal coefficient. The thermal coefficient of dry concrete decreased with increasing fiber content. However, the porosity of concrete mixed with more straw fibers increased, thus decreasing compressive strength. Concrete with a fiber content of 7.5% had the best overall performance, and it had a low thermal conductivity (0.158 W/(m·k)). According to COMSOL simulation results, the tunnel wind flow temperature of concrete with 7.5% fiber content was lower than the tunnel wind flow temperature of plain concrete. Thus, the obtained straw fiber heat-insulating concrete is a promising candidate material for tunnel insulation.

An idea to influence airflow in the ventilated gap of the façade is presented based on the results of developed software and the suitability of closing the air gap in winter and in the transition period of the year is described. First, the boundary conditions of the calculations, which are further used in the energy balance between the interior of the building and the exterior environment are defined. In order to include these influences, a discrete analytical calculation was created. It consists of the time distribution of the investigated thermal phenomena calculations. A significant finding is an obvious benefit of controlling the airflow through a ventilated gap in the winter and especially in the transitional period of the year. This technological knowledge has a high potential for energy savings related to the heating of buildings. As the calculations show, airflow control through a ventilated façade reduces heat flow by 25–30% on average, and in contrast, it increases heat gains by 20% and the specific values are presented within the article.

Using the wedge-splitting tensile method to research the rule of change in moisture content, double-K fracture toughness and fracture energy of three strength grades (C20, C30, and C40) of concrete immersed in a free water environment for 0 h, 2 h, 5 h, 24 h, and 120 h were studied in order to provide support for the safety evaluation of concrete structures in a water environment. The initial cracking fracture toughness of C20, C30, and C40 concrete in saturated state were, respectively, 29.6%, 23.2%, and 33.4% lower than that in dry state. The unstable fracture toughness of C20, C30, and C40 concrete in saturated state were, respectively, 22.7%, 23.9% and 33.8% lower than that in dry state. The fracture energy of C20, C30, and C40 concrete in saturated state are only 71.99%, 70.29%, and 66.11% of that in dry state, respectively. The initial cracking fracture toughness and unstable fracture toughness of concrete all show a linear, decreasing trend with an increase in moisture content. Before the crack initiation, the measured P–CMOD curve had an obvious linear elastic stage, stable expansion stage, and unstable expansion stage. The critical crack opening displacement gradually decreases with an increase in moisture content; the deformation capacity and toughness of concrete are shown to decrease. The humidity state should be fully considered when evaluating the fracture mechanical properties of concrete.

A house builder is responsible for repairing any defects in a newly built house. However, since house builders’ risk of closure and bankruptcy are increasing due to aggravated disputes and economic crises, builders may become insolvent and fail to perform defect repairs. In preparation for this, many countries have established defect repair deposit or guaranty insurance systems; however, the standards for these systems are not based an objective evidence since the current standards were arbitrarily established during industrialization. It has been pointed out that Korea’s housing defect repair deposit has been set excessively high and is being abused in disputes. Based on dispute cases in Korea, this study analyzed housing construction costs, deposits, and defect repair costs, resulting from lawsuits due to defects. The results confirmed that the defect repair deposit has been set too high compared to incurred defect repair costs. In addition, it was found that the guaranty insurance premium in lieu of the housing defect repair deposit was excessive compared to the damage caused by builder insolvency. In order to improve this, in this study, we proposed two alternative plans in which the housing defect repair deposit was set at a certain percentage of the construction cost based on the current Korean standard. In addition, based on the concept of different deposit levels using the scale of housing construction, such as in Australia and Canada, two additional alternative plans with different deposit ratios for each scale of housing construction were presented. The comparison results for housing defect repair deposits and guaranty insurance premiums based on the four presented alternative plans accompanied by actual cases showed that all the alternative plan deposits were higher than the actual defect repair costs. Even in the case of a guaranty insurance premium, the level was at least twice as high as the damage caused by builder insolvency. Therefore, all the alternative plans can fulfill their original role of protecting homeowners in the case of builder insolvency. At the same time, reducing the guaranty insurance premium to reflect the cost of housing construction is possible, and would benefit both house builders and home buyers. The results of this study are valuable as a reference for other countries considering establishing or revising a housing defect repair deposit system. Specifically, these findings, which analyzed the case of Korea’s socioeconomic changes as it transitioned from a developing country to a developed country, can provide important information for many developing countries operating housing defect repair deposit policies and systems.

Prolonged exposures to low temperatures resulting in heart and respiratory morbidities are estimated to be responsible for 50% of the reported illness in the plateau, attributable primarily to the design of homes ill-suited to extreme temperatures. Consequently, there is a growing need to ensure that dwellings provide adequate indoor thermal conditions in the region. Hence, on-site sensors were used to collect temperature and relative humidity data every five minutes in 26 living rooms in the Plateau for 11 months. From these data, a subsample was determined, resulting in dwelling-level thermal comfort and health surveys on 15 homes. Computer simulations were used to investigate whether the building itself could provide thermal comfort under different retrofitting scenarios. Multiple linear regression relating the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfaction (PPD) index to self-perceived health was undertaken. Both monitored and simulated results were matched against our underheating model, finding that 92% of the homes had cold indoor environments, some even during summer. High PPD and intense levels of underheating were positive predictors of higher self-reported health problems. More self-reported health problems were correlated with both lower life satisfaction and self-worth, and with subjects’ use of more adaptive strategies against environmental dissatisfaction. Dynamic computer simulations suggested that indoor thermal environments could be improved by enforcing the non-utilised standard NOM-ENER-020, which recommends the addition of insulation on walls and roofs. These findings suggest that the cold environments within homes of the plateau influence the self-perceived physical and mental health of its population. Hence, the application of adequate measures, such as retrofitting homes with stronger standards than the existing NOM-ENER-020 are needed in place.

A building project on a subsurface layer of soft soil has been analyzed. The Boundary Element Method with the Mindlin fundamental solution has been applied to compute the displacement resulting from the interference between pressure bulbs on the foundation. The rheological Kelvin–Voigt model has also been used for soil–structure interactions. Terzaghi’s Theory of Consolidation was used to fit the displacement–time curves. Finally, the rheological model was coupled through an iterative procedure, employing structural non-linear geometric effects. The results are consistent with settlement predicted effects and revealed that the slow distribution of efforts can cause relevant increases in some regions in the structure of the building.

Based on relational contract theory, this study employs trust and relational norms as the two relational governance mechanisms for improving knowledge collaboration. Next, this study explores the effect of relational governance mechanisms on knowledge collaboration and the moderating role of the building information modelling (BIM) application level. We collected data from 166 responses in construction projects. Our results reveal that relational norms significantly impact knowledge collaboration, which is contrary to the effect of trust. Furthermore, the BIM application level has an interactive effect with relational norms, which improves knowledge collaboration. These findings reveal that the level of BIM application significantly affects the effectiveness of relational governance mechanisms. This study suggests that project managers should help project parties to develop BIM responsibilities in order to facilitate collaborative performance.

Concrete is made up of binder materials and aggregates. Cement is a primary binder material used to produce conventional concrete. Carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere are a symptom of the issue related to Portland cement manufacture. It is estimated that one ton of cement produced releases an equal amount CO2 into atmosphere. On other hand, many industrial wastes are dumped in open spaces, leading to land pollution. Researchers have developed a construction material known as geopolymer concrete that uses industrial waste materials as a binder material to address these two issues. Excellent mechanical and durability characteristics are displayed by geopolymer concrete. For the creation of geopolymer concrete, fly ash is employed as a binder material. The drawback of utilizing fly ash is the curing method. Due to increased setting time, concrete samples require either heat curing or oven-curing. Geopolymer paste preparation is based on the type of binder materials used. In this study, GGBS is partially added with fly ash to cure specimens in ambient temperature due to presence of a higher amount calcium in GGBS. The present study investigates the consistency of geopolymer pastes, their workability, and the compressive strength of cement mortars by varying the amount of binder content (360 kg/m3 & 400 kg/m3). The molarity of NaOH was varied from 8 to 12. The ratio between binder material and alkaline to binder ratio were 0.45 and 0.50, respectively. The specimens were cured in both ambient and oven temperatures to study their strength development caused by temperature. A total of 396 specimens were cast to study the behavior of geopolymer concrete made with fly ash and GGBS (FAG). The test results revealed that the substitution of 50% GGBS with fly ash exhibited better strength properties during curing. Additionally, by increasing the binder content to 400 kg/m3, the results of 80% GGBS and 20% fly ash revealed excellent consistency among all other mixes. The oven-cured specimens showed more strength compared to specimens cured in ambient temperature, but the ambient cured specimens (ACS) attained the required strength. It was also not practically possible to cure the structural members by oven-curing in the field. The mix with 80% of GGBS and 20% fly ash can be used for construction. The required strength can also be achieved by increasing the molarity ratio.

In urban areas, surface deformation could lead to the deformation of surrounding buildings, which may cause damage to communities when accumulated to a certain extent. However, the current construction organization and management mainly rely on on-site deformation measurements, and there is still a lack of reliable prediction methods. Here, we proposed an effective evaluation method for frame building deformation based on the stochastic medium theory and the equivalent beam theory. This method could effectively evaluate the surface and building deformation after a horseshoe tunnel excavation by considering the non-uniform convergence. Furthermore, its accuracy and practicability were verified using the Nanyan Fourth Circuit Transmission Reconstruction located in Dalian, China. The results show that the spatial distribution and characteristic values of the maximum tensile strains were closely related to the ratio of Young’s modulus to the shear modulus (E/G), the building height (h), the tunnel depth (H), the tangent of the tunnel influence angle (tan β) and the convergence radius (ΔR). These achievements can provide a theoretical basis and analytical ideas for investigating the influence of shallow buried tunnel excavation on frame structure buildings in cities.

This phenomenon can significantly affect the lifecycle of concrete structures. Self-healing concrete (SHC) is considered a promoted innovation capable of overcoming this inevitable occurrence. In accordance with current SHC development processes, this paper utilizes the numerical simulation approach to test the performance of reinforced SHC beam specimens modeled using the commercial software ABAQUS 6.14 (Vélizy-Villacoublay, France). This paper aims to contribute to the scarce literature on SHC models by utilizing the overlooked dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) agent and ambiguous variability of crystalline admixtures. The SHC is introduced to the beam models at various depths and analyzed using load against displacement curves compared with a reference model of ordinary concrete. The effects of SHC on the mechanical properties of structural elements were determined. The results show a distinct improvement of the load-carrying capacity of SHC beams, indicating an efficient contribution of SHC in structural applications.

Their resistance can be reached by lateral distortional buckling (LDB), coupling LDB and local failure modes, or limit states of cracking or crushing in the concrete slab. This case is characteristic of continuous or cantilever elements. Another critical issue is that the design and calculation recommendations only address the LDB verification on steel-concrete composite beams without web openings, thus disregarding the interaction between the buckling modes. Furthermore, it is necessary to use adaptations of these formulations for beams with web openings. This review paper aims to evaluate the different approaches for standard code adaptations to verify the LDB resistance of the beams in question and to highlight the investigations that addressed this issue. The addressed adaptations consist of different approaches which determine the cross-section geometric properties in the central region of the openings, the so-called double T section, in the region of the web posts (solid section), and the averages between the solid section and double T section. The accuracy of the formulations in question is verified against experimental results from the literature. Furthermore, discussions and suggestions for further studies are presented.

To improve the contact at the steel–concrete interface, a novel arch rib was manufactured by longitudinally welding perfobond-rib-shear connectors to the inner surface of a steel tube and then filling the tube with concrete. In this study, extensive numerical and analytical investigations on the mechanism of introducing loads into CFST arch ribs through perfobond-rib-shear connectors were carried out. A deck CFST arch bridge, namely, the Shuangbao Bridge in China, was selected as a typical application location. The design parameters, including the geometric dimensions of the perfobond-rib-shear connector and the arrangement of the perfobond rib along the cross-section and longitudinal section of the arch rib, were evaluated. The design flow for the joint with perfobond-rib-shear connectors between the vertical columns and the CFST arch ribs was proposed. To improve the load-transfer efficiency, the design scheme of the joint in the Shuangbao Bridge was optimized by replacing the weld studs with perfobond ribs. Significant increases of 1.84–4.02 in the shear resistance were found for the perfobond ribs compared to the welded studs. Additionally, the fabrication of the perfobond ribs was more convenient compared to that of the welded studs.
