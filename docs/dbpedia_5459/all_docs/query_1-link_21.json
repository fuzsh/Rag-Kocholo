        "text": "Time for the Fed to pivot?\n\nFor the first time in years, the consumer price index — one measure of inflation — fell below 3%. That's good for Americans and the Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate to maintain stable prices and maximum employment. But as inflation has chilled out, so has the job market. What can the Fed do about it? Also in this episode: Mars bets that America will keep snacking, the lag in housing inflation data, and one interest rate to rule them all?\n\nTime for the Fed to pivot?\n\nListen · 27:35 27:35\n\nTaking the temperature of small business\n\nWhen you think \"high prices,\" you might think of stressed family budgets. But small businesses have to pay up too. Nevertheless, small-business optimism hit a two-year high last month, but it remains under the 50-year average. We'll visit a boutique in New York and a bookstore chain in Georgia to get entrepreneurs' on-the-ground perspectives. Also in this episode: New labor data could signal that interest-rate cuts are imminent, snack companies cook up Ozempic-friendly treats and Canada steps into the crude oil supplier spotlight.\n\nTaking the temperature of small business\n\nListen · 28:02 28:02\n\nThe ol' stock-bond balancing act\n\nLast week, when the stock market took a tumble, some investors put their cash into bonds instead. Why? Well, we tend to think of the stock and bond markets as having an inverse relationship: when stocks do well, bonds do worse. But when the economy gets wonky, that relationship doesn't necessarily hold. Also in this episode: Aging Chinatown residents struggle to pass the baton, consumers guess where the economy is headed next, and we ride an Amtrak train from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe ol' stock-bond balancing act\n\nListen · 29:21 29:21\n\nThe politics of Fed independence\n\nA lot of folks like to weigh in on what the Federal Reserve should do with interest rates; Donald Trump said this week that if he were to reoccupy the White House, he should have a say in setting monetary policy. But keeping the Fed free of political pressure is important for several reasons. We'll get into them. Also: Oklahoma tribal nations fill a gap in federal food aid for kids, Oregon ranchers deal with major wildfire losses, and theme park attendance dips.\n\nThe politics of Fed independence\n\nListen · 25:45 25:45\n\nThis back-to-school season, “value” is at the top of America’s shopping list\n\nThe back-to-school shopping season is well underway. But with stubborn high prices in this economy, how will parents get their kids ready without feeling financially burdened? Also: decoding quarterly earnings, what goes into pricing mortgage rates, and why airport food is so expensive. Plus: A projectionist remembers his reel life.\n\nThis back-to-school season, “value” is at the top of America’s shopping list\n\nListen · 25:31 25:31\n\nThis back-to-school season, \"value\" is at the top of America's shopping list\n\nThe back-to-school shopping season is well underway. But with stubborn high prices in this economy, how will parents get their kids ready without feeling financially burdened? Also: decoding quarterly earnings, what goes into pricing mortgage rates, and why airport food is so expensive. Plus: A projectionist remembers his reel life.\n\nThis back-to-school season, \"value\" is at the top of America's shopping list\n\nListen · 25:31 25:31\n\nHas the Fed ever met its 2 goals?\n\nSince the 1970s, the Federal Reserve has been officially tasked with a dual mandate: keeping prices stable and maximizing employment. But has the Fed ever found that sweet spot? It would be easier to answer if the economy wasn't always in flux. Also: Disney's streaming service posts its first profit, what we can learn from women entrepreneurs of the 19th century, and noise from a bitcoin mine haunts people in a rural Texas town.\n\nHas the Fed ever met its 2 goals?\n\nListen · 25:36 25:36\n\nWhy we freak out when the stock market freaks out\n\nHow are people feeling about the economy after the dramatic drop in stocks? They’re “Googling the word ‘recession’ like crazy,” an economics professor told us. On the show today: Why perception is so important in economics. Also: The not-so-bad reasons for the higher unemployment rate, what the Google antitrust ruling could mean for Big Tech, and stealth shopping — hiding purchases from partners — is on the rise.\n\nWhy we freak out when the stock market freaks out\n\nListen · 25:28 25:28\n\nWhy we freak out when the stock market freaks out\n\nHow are people feeling about the economy after the dramatic drop in stocks?

Global markets, including the major U.S. indexes, tanked today. Along with stocks, crude oil prices also took a hit. We’ll look at the causes and what might happen next. Also, the critical role of exporting services in this economy and a status report on a possible TikTok sale.\n\n“Chaotic,” “volatile,” “tumultuous”\n\nListen · 25:45 25:45"
