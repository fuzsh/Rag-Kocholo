CUBA RHC Bauta in English checked today Sunday Jan 30 at 07.26 UT, 6060even kHz exact fq, and much clean audio, no buzz at all today to state, S=9 noted in eastern states like NY, NJ, MA, also \\\\ at 9699.996 kHz channel in 31 meterband, also from Bauta site (ex6145/6165 kHz in B20 season), much clean audio too at 07.28 UT. But on western US tate parts CA / WA, or Alberta-CAN, Masset BC-CAN the Cuban and Florida signals much poor and tiny this Sunday, only S=3 to S=6. The antenna in Masset BC province pointed to East Asia ? The Japanese Nikkei R1 Nagara signal on 6055 kHz arrived with S=9+15dB instead, path over Alaska and the Pacific at 07.40 UT. When tuned-in and checked again both RHCuba Bauta signals at about 08.18 UT, heard RHC in Esperanto language in progress, the half hour program only on Sundays at 08.00 and 08.30 UT, S=9+10dB again noted in Rochester, NY state, and \\\\ 9699.996 kHz - Bauta in 31 mb - same strength too - and surprise, surprise an extra treat for the North America and Europe listener of the Bauta transmissions: empty signal carriers appeared still on air on both 6060 and 9700v, between 08.30 UT - and 22 minutes longer, until switch-off exact at 08.52:30 UT much late - ended the sleep of the RadioCuba local Bauta technician.

I am interested in building one myself. All the Youtube videos I have watched (about 15 of them) don't show any significant construction details. I am wondering if they can be made to work in the 137, 183 and 475 kHz ham bands and the LF NDB bands. And the videos I've seen show an FSL antenna that is just one coil with coupling to an AM receiver accomplished by proximity. How would I connect one to an SDR receiver that covers this LF range?

DJ still distorted says ``Imagine that``, and ``Alice? Radio``. Drama about Mars lander leads into another song; 2323 another Alice Radio ID. Well, it`s really OUTHOUSE Radio per all these; enunciate! https://www.hfunderground.com/board/index.php/topic,92274.0.html with three noisy SSTV captures, a pierced tongue outstuck, a privy, and a full-bearded guy (Glenn Hauser, OK, WOR) ** TURKEY. 5960, Jan 29 at 2302, no signal from VOT direct. Unknown if it might have come on later. Something`s always erroneous at Emirler (Glenn Hauser, OK, WOR) ** U S A [and non]. WORLD OF RADIO 2123 monitoring: confirmed UT Sunday January 30 at 0053 the 0030 on WRMI 7730, S9+12 into Knoxville SDR. Also confirmed starting at 0445 UT Sun Jan 30 on WA0RCR, 1860 AM, MO, S9+15 into nearby SDR but with multi-pitched very fast robotic CW QRM -- must be another 160m A1 contest encroaching on this A3 broadcast. Also confirmed Sunday January 30 at 1350 the 1330 on WMRI Europe, via Channel 292 Germany 9670, S9+20 into UTwente reading +7 Hz, modulation surges up and down a bit, but receiving artifact? Also checked Carlow, Ireland SDR at 1355, S7-S9 and not surging, +6 Hz carrier offset. Both have lite ACI from music on 9665, presumably CRI Russian via x-site rather than Korea North. I happened to awaken an hour earlier than I would have preferred. Not knowing this, tnx also to Alan Roe, Teddington UK: ``WOR 2123 confirmed on WMRI Europe Sun 1330 UT on 9670``. Where is Teddington? ``a suburb in south-west London in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. In 2021, Teddington was named as the best place to live in London by The Sunday Times. Historically in Middlesex, Teddington is situated on a long meander of the Thames between Hampton Wick and Strawberry Hill, Twickenham.

Beyond me why TRSW would choose a time up against not only Encore but The Giant Jukebox, and TOUTA, the Saturday evening music-glut hour (Glenn Hauser, OK, WOR) ** U S A. (5085), UT Sun Jan 30 at 0047, `Theater Organ Under the Arch` is already underway on WTWW-2 webcast. Must have started way earlier than usual? Since it`s chopped off without any formal closing at 0059 for Bible verse, CQ, WTWW canned ID treating our national anthem as a produxion jingle, and then a ham radio show. Something`s always loco at Lebanon (Glenn Hauser, OK, WOR) ** U S A. Prompted by announcements preceding and following `Weekend Radio`, webcast at 0300 & 0400 UT January 30: classical WCLV Cleveland OH will soon be changing from 104.9 to 90.3; this is because of a merger of sorts with WKSU at Kent State, and realigning those stations; some years ago WCLV lost its original better frequency, I believe it was 90.3, and had to move to 104.9 where the power can be only 6 kW ERP. 90.3 has been occupied by another Ideastream station, 47 kW, WCPN with NPR news/talk programming, and WCLV banished to HD2 on that frequency. WKSU originates on 89.7. >From a detailed press release at https://www.ideastream.org/about/press-releases/ideastream-public-media-and-wksu-public-radio-to-enter-into-public-service-operating-agreement ``Between January 1 and April 1, 2022, the following changes are expected to take place: WKSU will become the region?s NPR news and information station, with repeater stations in Ashland, Mansfield, New Philadelphia, Norwalk, Thompson and Wooster continuing to serve their local markets. Ideastream Public Media will reformat 104.9 FM to serve an additional repeater station for WKSU programming, bolstering coverage in the Cleveland area. The call letters associated with 104.9 FM will change from WCLV to WCPN. Those who love the classical programming provided by WCLV at 104.9 FM will have access to that programming at the new WCLV at 90.3 FM. There, they can continue to enjoy locally hosted performances by local artists and ensembles, including The Cleveland Orchestra, Apollo?s Fire and L?s Delices, along with student and faculty ensembles from the Cleveland Institute of Music, Oberlin Conservatory, Baldwin Wallace Conservatory and Cleveland State University. Reflecting the intent to serve its new expanded coverage area, 90.3 FM programming will spotlight more performances by musicians in Akron and Kent as well...`` (Glenn Hauser, OK, WOR) UNIDENTIFIED. 12000- CW, Jan 30 at 1552, letter Z sent over and over, JBA fading in and out; unsure if some other letter or number interspersed. First time noted despite bandscanning across here every day. One of those Russian one-letter beacons? I have not deliberately sought any of them out. Other letters on other frequencies, but not Z, have been logged by Harold Frodge, MARE Tipsheet. They are never on exact even frequencies. My Z was slightly on the minus side but too weak to measure (Glenn Hauser, OK, WOR) This report dispatched at 1936 UT January 30 End of Hard-Core-DX Digest, Vol 229, Issue 31 *********************************************"
