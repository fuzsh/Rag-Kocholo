        "text": "The way some people party on Fat Tuesday, you'd think the English translation of Mardi Gras was \"last call.\"\n\nToday is Ash Wednesday. Lent has officially arrived. Time to put away the beads, thaw the fish sticks and toss out the Marlboros, Dr Pepper, Twinkies and Guinness (at least until St. Patrick's Day.)\n\nWhat do you plan to give up for 40 days?\n\nThe usual suspects include candy, chocolate, coffee, pop, beer, TV, texting, video games, swearing and smoking. But Lent doesn't have to be a 40-day guilt trip.\n\nWhy not make it a 40-day gratitude journey?\n\nYou could spend 40 days practicing that greatest commandment of all: Love.\n\nThe point is to grow spiritually, not to punish yourself. Easter is a love story, not a horror story.\n\nLent is a great time to take stock of your spiritual condition. A great time for a little spiritual spring-cleaning. What's buried in the closet of your soul? What needs to be released from the nooks and crannies of your heart?\n\nFear? Resentment? Anger? Apathy?\n\nIf you start with the end in sight, on Easter morning, what do you want to have changed over these 40 days? What difference do you want to have made? What habit or character defect do you want removed? Who do you want to be?\n\nPeople wear ashes today to remember our mortality. If you had 40 days to live, what would you give up? Better yet, what would you give?\n\nYou could . . . .\n\nGive a single mom 40 minutes of time to do something alone.\n\nGive up a grudge.\n\nGive a compliment, a smile, an ear, a shoulder, a cup of coffee to a stranger, a lane to that car in a hurry.\n\nGive thanks for 40 minutes at the cemetery to your ancestors for all the sacrifices they made for you.\n\nGive up fear, doubt, gossip, complaining and whining.\n\nGive up your old bogey man God and find a God of joy who loves the masterpiece that is you.\n\nGive up multi-tasking and simply do one thing with complete presence.\n\nGive time. Spend 40 minutes getting to know a neighbor or co-worker.\n\nGive up your regrets. For 40 days, at the end of every day, pause and review the day. Is there anyone you shut out of your heart? Any words you wish you could take back? Any words you wish you had said? Make amends.\n\nGive up sad, depressing, angry music. What do you want to be the soundtrack to your life? Create one.\n\nGive up one meal a week and donate the money to the Cleveland Foodbank.\n\nGive away one item a week to the Cleveland Furniture Bank.\n\nGive yourself a retreat at the Jesuit Retreat House in Parma to feed your own soul.\n\nGive someone else's religion a chance. Visit a different church, temple or mosque.\n\nGive thanks to 40 people. Send a thank you note every day to the neighbors, teachers, family and friends who have blessed your life.\n\nGive yourself 40 seconds in the mirror every day to remember who you are in God's sight. Bask in God's love for the imperfect you who will probably cheat and eat a Twinkie, sip a beer and maybe even cuss during Lent.\n\nRelax. If you're embracing Lent, that means you believe in Easter, which means you've already been saved.\n\nImagine if you really believed it.\n\nJoin Regina Brett at 7 p.m. Wednesdays on WKSU FM/89.7 for \"The Regina Brett Show.\" This week: What makes a great movie great?
