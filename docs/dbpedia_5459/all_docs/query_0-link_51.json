        "text": "This paper presents an overview of the upcoming television broadcast spectrum incentive auction in the U.S., which will be the first ever attempted worldwide, and discusses the main business, regulatory and technical challenges of a successful incentive auction. The process combines two separate but linked auctions: a reverse auction, which will identify the prices at which broadcasters are willing to relinquish their spectrum; and a forward auction, which will determine the price mobile network operators are willing to pay to acquire the new frequencies. The two auctions will determine the buyers and sellers and also the amount of spectrum to be cleared in the 600 MHz band after reorganizing the television stations that remain on air. This process is known as repacking and will create contiguous blocks of cleared spectrum at the high frequency side of the UHF band for mobile use. The paper also reviews the potential plans for the 600 MHz band and discusses the opportunities that could bring about the new digital terrestrial television standard known as \" ATSC 3.0 \" .\n\nSince its creation, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has maintained that it acts only to serve 'the public interest, convenience, and necessity.' This phrase has been invoked to justify a range of activities so wide that their totality could never conceivably support any meaningful abstract standard either in word or in deed. Despite numerous and repeated claims to the contrary, the FCC has primarily served commercial broad- casting and industrial interests to the exclusion of other alternatives.â€™ An important example of this service to industry, with enormous implications for the structure and efficacy of future information distribution systems, is a series of recent FCC auctions of licenses for 'personal com- munications systems' (PCS) and a variety of proposed wireless telephone, interactive television, and computer data systems.\n\nThe financing represents the most important issue which implies the existence of public broadcasters all over Europe and all over the world. Arrangements are different from a country to country : entirely from the state budget, part from the budget, part from radio tax, entirely tax etc. The financing system in Romania is built on three piles: from state budget,\n\nTable of Contents: 1.
