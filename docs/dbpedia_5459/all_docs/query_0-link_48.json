Photo- graphs of other installations by this organiza- tion appear on pages 49 ro 5y There was an item in one of the magazines a while ago about the consternation created in its editorial offices when the publisher appeared and announced that he wished to write a piece tor the magazine. Publishers, they felt, were a strange breed for whom the \"no loitering\" sign in the editor's otiice was specifically prepared. If this story is typical, then High-Fidelity can consider itself a magazine indeed out of the ordinary, because its publisher is distinctly literate and always a welcome contributor. When readers have finished the article by Milton Sleeper, which begins on page 13, we are sure they will agree. Discussion among audio hobbyists as to which piece of equipment is the most im- portant in a high fidelity installation usually goes on into the wee hours of the morning. With characteristic originality, G. A. Briggs approaches his subject of sound reproduction in the home with the conviction that the most important aspecr of hi-fi is the one which is least often discussed: the human ear. Thus the first in his series of articles for High-Fidelity begins with The Loud- speaker and the Ear, on page 17. His thesis is that since the whole purpose of realistic audio reproduction is to please the ear, we had better start any discussion of the subject by understanding exactly what this thing is which we are trying to please. A thesis which, for us, seems wise indeed. We do not understand at all why we were so rash as to undertake to experiment on the Air-Coupler, to edit and publish this maga- zine, and to prepare a considerable amount of equipment for the Audio Fair in New- York - all simulraneously! Our foolish- ness has practically wrecked our health and has made us late getting this issue of High- Fidelity off the presses. Nevertheless, excellent progress was made with the new design of the Air-Coupler, the magazine is finally in print, and the Audio Fair was an overwhelming success. We admit that our sense of humor wore a little thin at times during the long hours spent working with the Air-Coupler, and we got very tired of rrips to the hardware store to buy more by io flat-head screws . . . bur in the Continued on page 79 Published by: AUDIOCOM, INC. at 264 Main Street, Great Harrington, Mast.

Additional entry at the Pott Office, Pitlsfield, Mass. Printed in the U. S. A. www.americanradiohistorv.com AS THE EDITOR SEES IT A DOZEN times a day, by phone and by mail, we are asked the simple question, \"Which piece of audio equipment is best?\" , The fact that such a question arises so often for every- one, from audio hobbyist to casual music listener, seems significant because, in audio, we are dealing with equip- ment which is rated by a number of technical standards; we are presumably dealing with a science. But are we? Is sound reproduction a science? Before we consider that question, let's go back to the original one. How far can we go toward deciding which piece of equipment is best? In our opinion, there is no conclusive answer. Certainly, a piece of equipment can be put through its electrical paces. A transformer rated at 50 watts can be tested to determine at what point it will collapse from overload. Intermodulation distortion in an amplifier can be measured with a high degree of accuracy. These determinations of quality mean much but not everything. They must not be underestimated, nor taken as the final answer. For one thing, although the question may be stated as: \"Which amplifier is best?\", the question is, in fact: \"Which amplifier, when used in conjunction with the other pieces of equipment which I have in my system, and operated at the particular volume level which I enjoy in my living room, will sound best to my ears at my age and at the time of day when I usually listen, which is when I am moderately tired after a day's work in a noisy office?\" Even though many factors are incorporated into the statement of that question, there are still more. Yet, altering any one of those factors may affect the decision as to which piece of equipment is best for the system under consideration. It is, of course, the old story of the chain and all its links. // is also much more. For in sound reproduction, factors enter in which, so far, no one has been able to analyze and correlate with finality. Some of these factors vary so widely that they are too complex for convenient analysis. Others are as yet undetermined. For example: even though every link from studio micro- phone to living room loudspeaker were perfect, there would still be the extremely complex problem of room acoustics. And then the final link in the chain — there is the almost Complete unknown: the human being. Thus, satisfactory and pleasing sound reproduction is not only a matter of highly complex engineering but also of physiology and psychology. We harp once again on this subject because its impor- tance was brought home to us very forcefully at the Audio Fair in New York and because we may need to reexamine our perspective. We hesitate to estimate how many hundreds of audio- philes came to our exhibit room a sort of last port of call — dazed, bewildered, and probably slightly deaf! One after another said, \"Well, I've heard umpteen ampli- fiers. They may all be flat from 10 to 100,000 cycles. But they don't sound alike at all!\" Not so common was the person who had heard them all, and arrived at a decision as to which he liked the best. But then, so often that it ceased to be amusing, would come the conflict: one person would announce his deci- sion and a second, overhearing it, would come in with a \"You thought that was best? Why, I thought such and such was much better!\" This is the quandary of the audio-phile. For the advanced hobbyist, it is half the fun of the hobby, changing and experimenting, to determine what improvement he can make in the final result: his listening pleasure. For the person just becoming acquainted with the possibilities of high fidelity reproduction of sound, the problem is baffling and sometimes discouraging. He has been led to be- lieve, perhaps, that by a judicious selection of components, each rated by engineering measurements, he can achieve a degree of perfection limited only by his pocketbook. How is it there can be such confusion in a science} -PeRHAPS the time has come for a long look at the de- velopment of the audio art. And perhaps the last word in that sentence is the key to the present problem: sound reproduction is not only a science; it must also be recog- nized as an art. Not long ago, an improvement in the technical rating of an amplifier indicated an improvement in sound re- production which was clearly audible. Today, the en- gineers have developed amplifiers to a point where there is little audible difference between any in a given price class. There may be an indefinable and subtle difference which is audible, but it does not seem to correlate with differences in engineering specifications. Should we therefore stop talking and writing about audio systems, with the idea that they are something scientific which we know all about and can discuss in clean- cut scientific terms? Should we face the fact that audio reproduction has outgrown science and entered the realm of art? Has the turning point arrived? Are we beginning to deal with a musical instrument? Shall we look forward to the day when a phonograph player is chosen by ear alone, as musical instruments are selected? The scientist can analyze the sound and construction of a violin and he can reproduce the instrument, but the chances are indeed slim that the facsimile will sound exactly like the original. There will be something missing — and that something is the contribution of the violin- maker's art. So too with audio. We are tremendously indebted to the scientist and the engineer; they have made possible the achievement of the present, and they have much still to accomplish. But should we not acknowledge the broadening of our horizon and consider music listening systems no longer a matter solely of audio engineering but also of musical art? To put rhe audio science in this perspective will restore the balance of importance between the ear and the engineer. www.americanradiohistorv.com Model RC-80 ^Jj i^^THE WORLD'S FINEST RECORD CHANGER 5% \"clearance above and S'/a\" clearance below lop of motor board. PUSHER TYPE PLATFORM: Adjusts simply to 7 —10' —12 rec- oros regardless of diameter or size of spinale hole.

At least 8.000 audio- philes are recuperating from had aural hang- overs and, without doubt, a goodly propor- tion have become temporary auilu)- pbobts. Both the hangovers and the audio-phobia will pass; enthusiasm will return, and heaven help us! New York's Audio Fair next year will be bigger and better than ever! We have not yet assembled our thoughts into coherence; the percussion of Varese's Ionization on EMS label is not yet stilled. Hut perhaps random impressions will be in order, for the henerit of those unable to attend . . Strongest impression: the battle of the Midgets and the Giants, Electro- Voice produced the biggest giant, the Patrician, and also the smallest midget, the Baronet. The latter is a corner enclosure about iK ins. high and occupying barely a square foot of floor space! It housed an K*in. loudspeaker, radiating direct from the front, horn loaded a la Klipsch at the rear. For an K- in. unit, astonishingly good reproduc- tion, probably the best balanced ot any of the midgets. Other midgets were the R-J and the Hartley. The R-J was demonstrated with ear-shattering volume (by no means the only unit guilty oi such conduct!) which certainly dug deep but stirred up a little mud in the extreme low-frequency region. Future development of the R-J is well worth watching carefully, as is the entire trend toward disproving the axiom that good bass reproduction requires giant size. The Hartley was extremely clean from middle (. on up. Both the R-J and the Hartley bring to mind the days in the rnid-thirties when it was fashionable to house an 8-in. Western Electric speaker in a tightly closed box. i cubic foot or less in size, using anything in sight to fill the back of the box to deaden back radiation from the speaker. Giants included the Electro-Voice Patri- cian, grandest and most impressive sonical- ly ot the lot; the Altec 820, clean and bright, whether operated pianissimo or super- fortissimo; the Jim Lansing, attractive in de- sign and exquisite in sound particularly when demonstrating the Magnecord bin- aural system; the Brociner corner design, which sounded wonderfully restful to the ears (partly due. no doubt, to the fact that the exhibitor's door was kept closed and volume level kept blessedly low, and brand new the Mcintosh sa wed-off cor- ner enclosure. Its square footage of space occupied was high, but its cubic footage low: it stood only waist-high. Bass was full and good; an efficient tweeter would have improved it for us.

Congratulations to them tor a smart idea, and for recognition of a pressing need on rhe part of many audiophiles. As Victor Brociner points out elsewhere in this issue of High-Fidelity, time was when only a few hard-bitten audio hobby ists knew the function of record com pen sators and preamplifiers. This year's Fair ended that era for good; everyone in sight had a pre-amp-cotnpensator unit Nore worthy new editions were announced by Pickering, Radio Craftsmen, H. H Scott, and Altec-Lansing. What to do with Messrs Fletcher and Munson with their Curves of hearing characterises, troubled some in this group of manufacturers. A few progres- sives bluntly admitted the existence ot Fletchcr-Munson curves, and used a loud ness control on their preamps. Others, such as Waveforms and Radio Craftsmen, adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude and incorporated a switch to throw the loudness Control feature in or out.

After reading letters from your subscribers, it appears that I am not the only one will- ing nay, anxious — to have your maga- zine do some of the listening and testing for us. I believe most of your readers would like detailed information such as that given in the Fall issue on amplifiers, but even more important, accurate data on perform ance. This information should not, and need not, be highly technical. However, articles such as Alan Macy's on Tape Re- cording are educanng your subscribers to the point where some technical information is meaningful and highly desirable. Concerning the discussion about reviews of popular music and the Music Between, I cannot complain of the lack of opportunity of making listening tests on popular records, what with the omnipresent radio and juke box. An expansion into the field of Music Between sounds interesting, especially if it could include music from all times and places, the unusual, and even, occassionally, the bizarre. All this, of course, provided it entails no restriction of the present classical reviews. G. At. Connally Floresville, Texas How do readers feel about the Equip- ment Reports on pages 80-83? — Editor Sir- I took your suggestion made in the first issue and wrote letters to the FM stations to which I listen. Most of them answered and seemed to be very glad I had written. It might not be a bad idea to repeat your suggestion in the next issue. For those of us with FM sets, three cents and a little time is a small amount to pay to help pro- tect an investment of usually more than one hundred dollars A E. Foster Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla. Sir It would be interesting to hear from readers using Magnecord Tape Recorders and Mcintosh Amplifiers, if they have con- sidered the advantage of a plug-in pre- amplifier for their Mcintosh. This pream- plifier might use a 12AX7 with bass equaliza- tion rising slowly from 1,000 cycles to a maximum of 20 db. boost at 20 cycles, to correct deficiencies in the tape. In this manner, instead of feeding the Mcintosh from the 16 ohm output of the tape re. corder, a low-level signal can be amplified out of the bridge-in jack following the first 12SJ7 stage in the Magnecord.

NAME 12 www.americanradiohistorv.com 15,000-CycIe FM Broad casting Is it true that listeners don't want 15,000-cycle tone quality on FM? Here are some significant /acts that many people don't know about, and others have forgotten, together with a report on listeners' opinions of a musical program using original, full-range tape recordings. BY MILTON B. SLEEPER TO UNDERSTAND the present status of FM broad- casting, and the possibilities of future improve- ment, it is necessary, and very interesting, to turn back to 1940, the year the FCC formally recognized FM. The invention of FM by Major Edwin H. Armstrong was the result of his search for a method of eliminating static. Important as that was, FM listeners back in 1940 were more impressed by its startling quality and realism. In those days, there was much more live-talent broad- casting than there is now. You may remember that NBC had a strict rule, in those days, against the use of phono- graph records. And all the early demonstrations of FM were made with live talent. Actually, FM provided the first source of high-fidelity music. One of the most impressive programs on the air was the broadcast of the New York Philharmonic con- certs on Sunday over Major Armstrong's FM station at Alpine, N. J. They were fed to Alpine over a special telephone line by CBS. An account of one incident will point out the exceptional quality of those broadcasts. I had tuned in the Philhar- monic Orchestra for some friends who had come to visit me. They brought their daughter, age four, to whom radio was nothing more than voices and music made by people who were somewhere else because they were no- where in sight. When I first turned on my FM receiver. Deems Taylor was speaking. After a moment, the little girl turned to her mother and said: \"Mommie, it sounds as if the man is right inside that box!\" That comment, coming from a child, was the most im pressive testimonial I have ever heard as to the realism that can be provided by FM. I never did find out why, but not long after that incident, CBS stopped furnishing rhe Philharmonic concerts to Alpine. Probably the first formal presentation of FM to a large group of advertising managers and executives occurred at Boston, in October, 1940, when the late John Shepard III and Paul deMars pur on a demonstration from Pax- ton for the local Advertising Club at the Hotel Statler. 1 Today, we hear that advertisers are indifferent to the use of FM broadcasting, but I recall, because I was there, that the members of the Boston Advertising Club ap- plauded the artists who performed for them by FM with more spontaneous enthusiasm that I ever knew such a group to show before or since that occasion. They didn't identify what they heard as the beginning of high-fidelity reproduction, but that is what it was. They only knew that this was totally different and superior to any radio reception they had ever heard before. In the discussion that followed, there were various com- ments to the effect that FM had ushered in a new era in broadcasting, when sponsors would increase the effec- tiveness of their programs and multiply their audiences, because such startling realism opened up new horizons of radio entertainment that would attract a still larger nuni ber of listeners. X hAT WAS the status of FM on Dec. 7, 1941 , when, without warning, scheduled programs were suddenly in- terrupted and cancelled so that radio stations could carry the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the rapid suc- cession of events that followed. By April, 1942, manu- facture of all home radio sets was stopped by Government order. FM audiences were growing at a furious pace at that time, but they were still numerically small, com- pared to AM listeners, when the supply of receivers was cut off. So, of necessity, the broadcast stations put aside their plans for the expansion of FM service. But why didn't the progress of FM pick up at the point where it had been stopped, as soon as the production of radio receivers was resumed? What happened to those ■Details of this event were published in FM Magazine for December, 1940. Among those who displayed particular enthuisasm over the demonstration were Craig Smith of Gillette, George Chatfteld of Lever Bros., E. C.

I* www.arnericanradiohistorv.com WABF announcer Bob Bigham, left, has done an excellent job of the commercials for High-Fidelity, He has an effective, low-key style, welt suited to FM, magnificent live-talent programs? How about the 15,000- cycle networks that AT&T said they could furnish? Is it true that, as broadcasters and set manufacturers widely assert, the public today doesn't want high-fidelity recep- tion? Or if people do want the kind of audio quality that characterized FM before the war, why aren't they getting it? Well, in the years following the war, many things hap- pened to bring about a decided deterioration of audio quality on AM, and to reduce FM to the same low level. In fact. FM was affected so adversely that only during the past two years has it shown definite signs of progress toward recovering its position of preeminence as a high- fidelity service. In the perspective of time, it now seems clear that, among the many contributing factors, FM was hurt most by 1) the antagonistic attidude of the Federation of Musi- cians, 2) the CBS report on listener preferences, and 3) the advent of television. That FM has survived these ad- verse influences is the most definite assurance as to its future progress. By the way of keeping the record straight, as Major Armstrong would say, it's worth while to look back on the three factors just cited to see just what effect they had on the audio quality of FM broadcasting. First came the refusal of the musicians' union to parti- cipate in programs transmitted on both FM and AM unless they received additional pay. Since, economically, that was out of the question, FM stations were forced to limit their musical programs to the use of records and transcriptions. Later, the union withdrew that refusal but, in the meantime, they had increased their scale of wages by such an amount that many musical shows on the networks were dropped, and in their place came soap operas, disc-jockey shows, crime stories, and mystery dramas. As for the independent stations, both AM and FM, they had to depend on recorded music. Then came the CBS report that, as determined by ex- haustive engineering research. listeners did not want high- fidelity music' This conclusion was completely contrary -'\"Tonal-Range and Sound-Intensity Preferences of Broadcast listeners\" by H. A. Chinn and P. Eisenberg, Proc. of the I.R.E.. Sept. 1945. This was followed by a further report: \"Influence of Reproducing System on Tonal-Range Prefer- ences\" by H. A. Chinn and P Eisenberg. Proc. of the I.R.E., May 1948. to the reactions of people listening to live-talent FM pro- grams under normal home circumstances. However, the results of the tests were publicized widely. Broadcasters quoted the report to explain their abondonment of good musical programs, and as a reason for not making available the full capabilities of FM. With nearly three times as many AM stations on the air as before the war, set manufacturers were forced to narrow the pass band of their IF ampli- fiers, reducing upper-frequency response to as low as 3,500 cycles, in order to limit whistles caused by inter- station interference. Under such circumstances, there was no justification for making expensive AM sets, since the difference in audio performance would not justify higher prices. So they were pleased to accept and pass on the word about the public rejection of high-fidelity. Just when it began to seem that the set manufacturing business would be limited to the production of cheap table models, television got under way. Sets priced up to Si.ooo or more began to sell faster than the factories could turn them out. In time, as competition brought the prices down, the demand increased. FM receivers were forgotten in the stampede to produce TV sets. Furthermore, the advertising agencies saw a golden opportunity in television. Their revenue is a percentage of what they spend for their clients. If an audio pro- gram costs $5,000 and a television show costs $20,000, it's easy to see why the agencies are inclined to be so enthusiastic about TV, and indifferent toward attempting to develop the art of audio programming. *3o MUCH for the adverse influences that brought about the deterioration of audio quality on AM broad- casting, and that so severely limited FM. It was an un- fortunate situation, but all the cards were not stacked against FM and high-fidelity programs. Far from it! Actually, many influences were at work to stimulate interest in high-fidelity, and to draw new devotees into this group of enthusiasts. To recall a few: There was Jerry Minter's paper on intermodulation, delivered before the Radio Club of America back in 1945. 3 Lincoln Walsh stirred up wide interest in the possibilities of better audio quality by bringing out the Brook amplifier. Then, from England, came the London FFR Records, followed by Columbia's development and promotion of LP record- ings. Norman Pickering contributed a pickup that took more from records than had been heard before. Paul Klipsch, answering the criticism that extended treble response alone sounded too shrill, provided an extension of musical bass response. Further audio developments followed fast and furiously. Meanwhile, parallel progress was being made in another direction. When most of the larger set producers dropped FM to devote their efforts to television, Zenith Radio went into TV, too, but Commander Eugene McDonald took this opportunity to move in as the No. 1 manufacturer of FM receivers. And Zenith's Chicago station WEFM is one of the oldest in the Country. Back in 1940, Browning Laboratories came out with www.americanradiohistorv.com what was then a new idea. Instead of making complete receivers, they produced FM tuners to which individual purchasers could add whatever audio amplifiers they pre- ferred. Immediately after the war. Browning added FM- AM tuner designs, promoting their sale aggressively and successfully. Meissner. Radio Craftsmen, and F.spey fol- lowed suit. Terminals and switches were provided for connecting phonographs. Interest in high-fidelity reproduction spread most rapid- ly in areas where there was good FM broadcast service. Naturally, the hi-fi enthusiasts built FM tuners into their systems so that, at least, they could have interference-free reception, and once in a while a live-talent program. In addition, although the AM broadcasters don't seem to know it yet, there are many sections of the Country where there is no primary AM coverage, but an excellent choice of FM programs. HAT WAS the situation a year ago, when we were making final plans to bring out High-Fimlity Magazine. Since then, despite the tremendous and fast-spreading inter- est in hi-fi reproduction that made this publication an immediate success, a great many well-informed individu- als in the industry have held forth at great length, in person and by letter, concerning the public rejection of full-range audio quality, as evidenced by the fact that many FM stations are being programmed mostly with well-worn records, and the best are carrying 5,ooo-cycle network shows. There was no doubting their sincerity, and I had no evidence to prove they were wrong. Still, looking back over the events of the past two years, it seemed to me that circumstances, rather than the preference of the listeners, were responsible for the present low standards of audio broadcast quality. This subject came up during a staff discussion at a time when it was proposed that we use some spot announcements on a recorded program over WABF New York, as a means of acquainting their audience with HIGH- FIDELITY Magazine. That idea was dropped, however, because our staff was unanimously opposed to program quality inconsistent with the name of the Magazine! Soon alter that decision had been reached. 1 mentioned it in the course of a discussion with Leon Wortman. of A-V Tape Libraries. He said: \"How would you like to put on a show with ivooo-cycle tape, using an Ampex machine and original Mercury tape recordings?\" As a result of his suggestion, an arrangement was worked out with David Hall for the use of the tapes, and to have Mr. Hall handle the show on two half-hour periods each week. The Ampex machine was duly installed at WABF. and the program started at the end of September. This, as far as I know, was the first radio show to offer orchestral masterworks of i vooo-cycle tape quality. Here was our chance to find out whether or not listeners would notice any difference in audio quality and. if they did. whether they would like it or not. For the first month. 'This paper, entitled \"Audio Distortion in Radio Reception\" waa reprinted from the Radio Club Proceedings in the March. 194fi issue nrFM and TELE we made no point of the high-fidelity feature, except to explain that we were using original 1 5,000-cycIe Mer- cury tapes. Then our announcements were changed to ask the listeners if they noticed any difference in the quality of this musical series and that of other programs with which they were familiar. The replies expressed a degree of enthusiasm beyond anything we expected. For example: Robert W. Cushman. Newtown. Ha. Were I in the movie business, my comment on the broadcast from tape of the Bartok work would be \"stupendous \".

Com- pared to your programs, the conventional presentation is no more than an unreasonable facsimile. Thanks. Let's have many more of these gems. Richard Stewart, Larchmont, N. Y. — It truly was a revelation to hear your high-fidelity recording of Bartok's work, even on my Zenith All programs not related to time can be recorded well in advance of the actual date of transmission. That is being done now, in many cases, but the tape shows are being put over 5,000-cycle lines. In point of expense, it would be cheaper to make tape copies and to distribute them by mail, even to a large number of stations. It is not necessary to use telephone lines for distributing such programs. And all the larger stations have tape equip- ment now. That would not improve AM, but it would make it possible for all FM stations to furnish the full-range quality that has so impressed the audience on our WABF shows. Even the soap operas and the mystery plays would be made more interesting by the live quality of the voices, and the realism of the at this point an electric Razor, a mixer and a vacuum cleaner start operating table model receiver. Hubert Prince, New York City — The hi-fi re- cordings make all the dif- ference in the world. That music popped right into my living room as if by magic. I guess it is magic — wonderfully alive and vibrant. P. Hafstein, New York City — The medium of full-fidelity tape is a de- cided improvement over the generally badly-worn recordings that serve as the core of too many otherwise well-planned programs. We have reams of simi- lar letters and postcards, and they are still coming in. But these typical quo- tations confirm my long- standing conviction that the interest in and appreci- ation of full-range pro- gram quality is actually far greater today than it was in 1940. What is lacking now is program material of such quality as to evoke the enthusiastic response represented by those letters. Broadcasters, not listeners, have rejected high-fidelity. Of course, we have only used the formal music for our WABF programs as has been available through the gen- erous cooperation of Mercury Records. It might be said that full-range quality would not be a factor in plays, where music is incidental. That was not the case in the early days of FM, when I heard several live-talent shows of that kind. Mr. G. A. Briggs, in his article in this issue of High-Fidelity points out that lack of realism is more noticeable in sound effects than in music. I re- call hearing a play on FM in which there was some shoot- ing. The sound of the shots and the reverberation fairly took me off my chair. But with 5,000-cycle quality, a revolver makes a noise like a cap-pistol. Today, tape offers the simple answer to better quality The Unseen Audience : : : : : : : : By tebstek There are times, of course, when freedom from static is more im- portant than tone quality, as indicated in this cartoon published recently in the New York Herald Tribune. sound effects. More important to many listeners is the improve- ment possible in musical programs. The relatively few shows that employ live talent could be taped, of course. Think what it would mean, for example, if FM stations could get 1 5,000-cycle tapes of the current NBC Symphony programs, with Toscanini conducting. Such music could be repeated several times a year. Instead, it is available only once, and then over 5,000-cycle lines! On the other hand, efforts to improve audio quality do not rule out transcriptions and some records. The serious troub- le with such music is thai the discs are used too many times. Here, again, tape offers a solution, be- cause it can be run repeatedly without evidencing audible signs of wear. Thus, if a record or transcription is run just once to make a tape, the original quality can be pre- served. A few stations are doing that now, but most use their discs until needle scratch competes with the music. In short, broadcasters have at their command right now the means for furnishing programs of 10,000 to 1 5,000- cycle quality for immediate use on FM stations affiliated with the networks. Similarly, the independents can im- prove their audio quality to a considerable degree, and at a small, extra expense that would be covered quickly by attracting added sponsors. Well, there you have the picture of audio program quality as it was, as it is, and as it can become. But if listeners want full-range programs, they must take a per- sonal interest in the operation of their local stations. They must make their desires known. Broadcasting will only improve to the extent that listeners demand it. W7 95- 16 www.americanradiohistorv.com the LOUDSPEAKER and the EAR K y G. A. BRIGGS This is the first of a series of four articles by the noted authority on loudspeakers and acoustics, G. A. Briggs. Subsequent arti- cles will discuss Room Acoustics, the Loud- speaker, and Loudspeaker Mounting. I SHOULD like to begin by saying that I was extremely pleased to receive an invitation from the Editor of this journal to make a contribution to its pages, for two main reasons: i) In the present disturbed and un- certain state of the world, any move, however small and however remote from politics, which tends to bring our two countries into closer contact, is to be warmly wel- comed. 2) As a result of the American demand for my books, \"Loudspeakers\" and \"Sound Reproduction\", I have received many friendly letters bearing U. S. post- marks, and I appreciate this opportunity to write more directly for American readers. There is one more personal point that I should like to raise. I am actually a maker of loudspeakers. My activities in this field provide facilities for making tests and experiments which help me in writing on kindred topics; but it will be my endeavor to preserve an impar- tial attitude toward all types and all makes, so that the principles and ideas which are considered can be applied to as broad a range of loudspeakers as possible. To that end, the relevant characteristics, such as flux density, cone resonance, and diameter of the units used in the tests will be stated. This neutral line is fairly easy to follow in my case, because my factory is small and is usually fully loaded with orders. And, being on the wrong side of 60, I am not interested in enlarging the works and turning my few remaining hairs even grayer than they are. The general position in relation to sound reproduction was neatly summed up in the Editorial of the July 1951 issue of Wireless World in the following words: \"Among the many branches of electricity, electro-acoustics is unique in that it has attracted a large band of fervent devotees. The reasons for this are not far to seek: the quest for perfect reproduction amounts to chasing the unattain- able, and so offers a constant stimulus to human instincts. Again, art enters into it quite as much as science. Interest in the subject was never at a higher pitch than at the present time; according to correspondents in the U.S.A., the same applies in that country, where hi-fi tends almost to displace television.\" I think that America, Canada, and Great Britain are the countries which show the keenest interest in this question, followed by certain South American countries, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. I am not in a position to speak about conditions in Germany, but 17 www.americanradiohistorv.com other European countries still show a good deal of apathy. During a recent visit to Holland and Belgium I was sur- prised at the generally low standard of sound reproduc- tion which is still accepted. N OW it seems to me that there are four variable and uncertain elements in the domestic reproduction of sound. These are: 1. The human ear 2. The listening room 3. The loudspeaker 4. The method of mounting the loudspeaker, for coupling elements 2 and 3 together, to give maxi- mum satisfaction to number 1. To expect all listeners to agree about items 3 and 4 wou'd be equivalent to converting all the Conservatives and Socialists in this country to Liberalism. (Even this miracle would leave a smattering of Communists). For, although differences of opinion on quality of reproduction are often looked upon as questions of taste, they may be due in fact to differences in what is heard, depending on the personal characteristics of the ears of the individuals con- cerned. This involves the faculty of tonal discrimination, which is probably most highly developed in recording engineers, who must constantly exercise this faculty by comparing reproduced music with the original. Strangely enough, musically gifted people do not neces- sarily shine in the tonal department; I have often noticed that a fine musician may be a poor judge of loudspeaker performance, and I am astonished at the low standard of reproducing equipment which is tolerated in the homes of many famous pianists and other artists. The musician is impelled by instinct and habit to concentrate on the music, and on its interpretation by the performers, whereas these vital qualities must be totally ignored if concentra- tion on quality of reproduction is to be ensured. The B.B.C. recently ran a series of programmes on \"Records I Like\", by famous musicians, which con- firmed this view. Of those I heard, only one musician made any reference to quality of recording. This was none other than the great Sir Thomas Beecham himself, who played a pre electrit recording of a song and came out with the amazing remark that very little progress had been made in recording the human voice during the last 40 years. Sir Thomas is never dull he is always lively and entertaining when he speaks — but he surely never said anything funnier than this! The record in question sounded exactly as though the singer was bellowing into a horn, which of course he was One can only conclude that the pronounced recording resonances in the middle register did not worry Sir Thomas Beecham's ear; his musical genius must be a talent quite distinct from this problem of tonal judgment. Comparison Of Speakers When comparing the performance of a variety of loud- speakers, it often happens that different listeners select different types as the best, particularly on music. There 18 is less confusion when speech and noise effects are repro- duced. I have an excellent \"bathroom\" recording (free from the commercial curse of preemphasis at high fre- quencies), made by Cecil Watts of Sunbury-on-Thames, giving life-like reproduction of the sound of water run- ning into a wash basin. I generally fall back on this record — figuratively speaking - when I want to convince a visitor that a certain loudspeaker is better than its fellows. There are two main reasons for the success of such a noise test. The first is that many changes to the har- monic structute and resonance of music are possible without destroying its appeal, whereas similar mutilation of noises often destroys the natural quality, due mainly to the enormous frequency content of the noise. The second is that the distraction of music and its dynamic and aesthetic appeal are removed. I have more than once been asked why a visitor's opin- ion as to which is the best reproduction of music should not be as good as mine. How do I know that my tonal judgment is so wonderful? And so on. One reply is that if I really set about 1 a visitor and apply the heat for half an hour and draw attention to such factors as obvi- ous resonances, I can usually bring him round to my way of thinking. But the best reply is that my judgment, while not infallible, is constantly being checked by tests of response range, frequency and intensity of resonances, performance of units under transient impulses, purity of output at low frequencies, and intermodulation products. If, after these tests, my choice of what sounds best did not in a general way agree with what should be best, I should naturally have to revise my ideas and suspect my judgment. How The Human Ear Hears A brief study of the ear from the physiological aspect would not be out of place here. The best summary I have come across is in the interesting book \"Wave Motion and Sound\" by R.W.B. Stephens and A. E. Bate, 2 from which three diagrams have been taken. The human ear is made up of three compartments, shown diagramarically in Fig. 1. Sound vibrations pass through the air of the outer ear, through the solid bone of the middle ear, and then through the liquid of the inner ear. The transfet of sound energy, from the ear drum to the oval window through the middle ear, is per- formed by the lever action of the small bones called oxides, depicted in Fig. 2. The area of the oval window is much smaller than the ear drum, and it is stated by Stephens and Bate that the middle ear acts as a step-up acoustic transformer, the pressure variations of the sound waves being stepped up by 50 or 60 times. At the same time, the low acoustic impedance of the air is matched to the high impedance of the liquid of the inner ear The main portion of the inner ear consists of a coiled tube or shell, known as the cochlea, represented uncurled and diagramatically in Fig. 3.

The most interesting item of all the complicated details of the ear is the basilar membrane. It is calculated that this membrane contains some 30,000 fibres of varying length and tension, which transmit impulses of frequency and intensity of sound to the brain. In order to complete this short description of the work- ing of the ear, I must quote from \"Theory of Hearing\" by E. G. Wever, 3 in which the volley theory of hearing is put forward as a combination of the resonance and place theories. According to the volley theory, the area of the HINGE IMER ^ ANVIL OVAL WINDOW ROUND WINDOW EUSTACHIAN TUBE Fig. 1. A simplified sketch of the human ear, showing the three compartments: outer, middle, and inner ear. basilar membrane and the number of fibres which are used vary according to the frequency involved, as shown in the following table: Table I Frequency Spread Density Score % cells spread x per mm. density 30 49.0 1 16 5,684 100 46.0 173 7.958 200 45.0 787 35.415 500 4>-5 1,150 47,725 1,000 3>-5 1,225 38,587 3,000 1 2.0 1,140 1 3,880 5,000 7.0 1,025 ~7.>75 10,000 4-3 975 4.192 20,000 3-7 ■79 662 It is interesting to note that the largest number of fibres or cells are brought into play at the middle frequencies where the sensitivity of hearing is well known to be high- est, thus accounting for the normal threshold-of-hearing curve. These brief details of the ear are adequate to remove any surprise at the fact that human beings vary enor- mously in what they actually hear under identical condi- tions. Indeed, it is surprising that there is so much unani- mity that an outstanding voice, such as Gigli's, can achieve world-wide recognition. Distortion It is often stated that distortion is produced in the ear at low frequencies by the non-linear lever action of the bones of the middle ear, but I am inclined to think that this statement should be accepted with reserve. It is of course clear that distortion sets in when the intensity of sound is unduly increased; this is obvious where very loud speaker output is used to surmount a high level of background noise in a factory. The ear interprets distor- tion and suffers accordingly, although the amplifying equipment may be blameless. Such distortion is heaviest 'John Wiley it Sons. Inc.. N Y., 1949. Fig. 2. Sound energy is transferred from the outer to the in- ner ear by means of small bones, called ossicles. at low frequencies where the sound amplitude is greatest. Paradoxically, it is also stated in some quarters that the ear is not worried by distortion at low frequencies at reasonable levels in reproduced sound. In order to test these ideas, a pure tone, set at 0.5 watt at 500 cycles, was fed into various loudspeakers at fre- quencies from 250 cycles down to 30 cycles, and a micro- phone was placed in front of the unit under test. I listened carefully to the sound emerging from the speakers, while my confederate watched the wave form on an oscilloscope, and I had no difficulty in detecting the first signs of dis- tortion usually frequency doubling and trebling. In other words, what I heard agreed with what the observer saw. It is interesting to compare the results from different units and cabinets, tested in a room about 15 ft. by 14 ft., with facilities for facing any loudspeaker unit through a hole in the wall into a large, quiet field for free-field con- ditions. The wave-form of any note was the same which- ever way the unit faced, which shows that although an enclosed space makes an enormous difference to the in- tensity of low notes, it does not affect the actual quality from a single-tone source. It is regretted that the following diagrams, Fig. 4, are not actual photographs because the main oscillograph (with camera attached) started to go up in smoke during the course of the tesrs, and we were compelled to bring on its understudy (with no camera). My confederate, Mr. E. M. Price, M. Sc. Tech., a Senior Lecturer at Brad- ford Technical College, has approved the diagrams as presenting a reasonable picture of what happened. It is important to note that there was no trace of distortion or harmonic content in the output from the oscillator at the power and frequencies used; the input to the speakers was a pure sine wave in every case. The point of maxi- mum interest is the frequency at which distoition com- menced. The power of the ear to recognize non-linearity at fre- quencies below 100 cycles, even at low volume levels, is beyond dispute. It is satisfactory to note at the same time that the loudspeakers which produce the best low- frequency wave forms also sound best when reproducing music which contains the lower frequencies. Fig. 3. The basilar membrane, shown in the accompanying sketch of the cochlea is estimated to con- tain some 30,000 fibres of varying length and tension. HELICOTREMA '9 www.americanradiohistorv.com Masking When two tones of different frequency are produced, increasing the power of one of the tones may, at certain frequencies, mask the other tone and render ir inaudible. Such masking occurs only where the frequencies are fa : rly close together say within a range of two or three octaves — and is most easily produced in the region of 500 to 8,000 cycles, where the sensitivity of hearing is greatest. The masking tone may be higher or lower in pitch than the tone under test, the effect being due to the spread of the action of the masking tone on the basilar membrane. A test with two loudspeakers and two audio frequency oscillators gave the results shown in Table II. In each case, the speaker under test was fed with 0.5 watt from the oscillator. It was found necessary to use the full output of 6 watts from the second oscillator before any total mask- ing effects could be produced. No attempt was made to increase the power of the masking tone above 6 watts, be- cause we are concerned here only with what happens to the ear under normal conditions, and 6 watts with units of reasonable efficiency is too loud to be comfortable. Table II: Test for Masking Speaker No. 1 Speaker No. 2 10,000 cycles at 0.5 watt masked by 6 watts at 3,000 cycles 5.ooo \" \" 2,500 2.000 ■■ •■ 1,100 1 ,000 700 ',000 \" •' 1,200 500 600 The masking tone was started at a remote frequency, and was made to approach the frequency under test until the latter became inaudible. It was veiy difficult to make reliable tests, because all sorts of beat effects, difference •tones at lower frequency, and summation tones ax higher frequency were produced, and these often persisted after the tone under test was actually inaudible. In such cases, it was assumed that complete masking in the ear had not been effected. No doubt masking effects in music are of sufficient importance to account for the difference in the tone of a musical instrument played solo compared with the same instrument heard in an orchestra, but I think the effects •may be safely ignored so far as domestic loudspeakers are concerned. Unfortunately, it has often been stated by people who ought to have known better — includ- ing yours truly — that high notes are masked by very low ones, thus accounting for the excess of bass and lack of \"top\" which is sometimes noticed when reflex loading is applied to a single loudspeaker. Any such lack of balance is not due to masking. It is, I suppose, simply due to lack of balance. Interference The effect of interference is rather different. According to Wever in \"Theory of Hearing\", it is due to electrical activity of the cochlea, rather than overlap in the basilar membrane, and produces a reduction in the magnitude of 20 one tone on the presentation of another. Interference occurs between any pairs of tones at any frequency, but is again most pronounced for tones to which the ear is most sensitive, so far as the frequency of the interfering tone is concerned. Very loud sounds are required to produce noticeable interference by listening tests; volume levels of 5 or 6 watts from the oscillator have no serious effect on other low-level tones. The interference caused by background noise is of course a common experience. Percussion sounds, such as clicking or hammering, have a much stronger interference value than steady tones. Few people can listen to music with equanimity if accompanied by constant banging, even when the sound level of the noise is below the sound level of the music. On the other hand, this phenomenon accounts for the clarity of the piano against quite a large orchestral background, which in turn accounts in no small degree for the enormous popularity of the piano concerto. Another interesting aspect of interference is that uneven frequency levels are almost as objectionable as sudden changes in intensity. Factory noise often comprises severe frequency changes as well as peaks of intensity, which make the satisfactory reproduction of speech and music much more difficult than would be the case with steadier conditions. In other words, the nature of the noise may be quite as important as the over-all volume level. To return home, the same problem applies to sur- face noise from records, where pronounced resonances in pickups and loudspeakers often intensify the annoyance, and the pop-gun effects of some early LP records loomed up as a serious threat to the survival of the system. In order to check the actual masking effect of needle scratch, a test was made by playing the centre groove of a worn 78-rpm. record through a wide-range, two-speaker system. It was found necessary to increase the volume to a room level of 78 db. above the threshold of hearing, according to the noise meter used. This level cannot be guaranteed as an absolute statement of fact, but it is about equal to the volume of sound produced by playing a piano ff. When heard in the form of needle scratch, it is a lot of noise and, in this case, was sufficient to drive my secretary headlong out of the room, after she had withstood the pure-tone masking rests previously des- cribed. Another loudspeaker was then connected to an oscillator, and could be clearly heard at all frequencies above 60 cycles up to 10,000 cycles with an input of no more than 0.5 volt into 15 ohms (only about .02 watt). At 50 cycles, the speaker became inaudible with this input. Although rather astonishing, these results do little more than confirm that masking and interference effects at domestic power levels are of small consequence. (I would hardly advocate this amount of needle scratch as a cure for 50-cycle 4 hum). Surface noise is also intensified by cabinet resonance. A simple but illuminating test is easily made with the help of an ordinary electric kettle. When water reaches a temperature at which singing is heard, place the kettle first on the carpet, then directly on the floor boards, and «50-cycle AC is used in England, instead of the U. S. 60-cyde standard. www.americanradiohistorv.com A. 8-in. unit on on 1 8-in. baffle at 100 cps. The dis- tortion was just discernable to the ear. B.

The singing of the kettle is somewhat similar in frequency content to needle scratch, although the latter contains more of the lows. The main point is that these random noises consist of an infinite number of frequencies which are sure to find the fundamental or harmonics of the natural resonances of surfaces which they excite. The acoustic coupling is very strong in the case of the kettle, as there is actual mechanical contact, but it should be remembered that surface noise from records is only troublesome during soft passages of music, where even the slightest increase caused by resonance is objectionable. The effect of cabinet resonance on the reproduction of speech or music is of course much more pronounced. Conclusion The importance of the vagaries of the human ear has long been recognized in connection with high fidelity. In fact, it is an old dodge of a certain British loudspeaker maker to condemn all his competitors as being owners of cloth or tin ears. Such descriptions of the ear get us no- where, and I feel that the time has arrived when it should be possible to assess the value of the interpretation which the individual places on the sounds he hears, in addition to the existing tests of ear efficiency by audiometer. I also think that regular concert-going is a necessary part of the equipment of any sound enthusiast or engineer. How else shall he know what is good? I am still regularly shocked by the difference between music at first hand and the same at one remove. Much of what we hear today from gramophone records is at two or three removes. For instance, recorded music goes from a concert stage through a microphone, through a tape recorder, to a disc, through a pickup, and finally through a loudspeaker before it can be heard in the home . . . and then it goes through the ear.

The second, on room acoustics, will appear in the next issue of HlGH-FlDELITY. 21 www.americanradiohistorv.com Prescription for better bass: 1 j By CHARLES FOWLER IN THE first issue of High-FideliTY, the article \"How To Achieve Full Bass Response\" told about a method of speaker mounting which provided a remarkable improvement in the reproduction of low frequencies simply, and at relatively low cost. The article created wide interest, and many requests for further information. In this article, we shall provide additional details about the device used for bass reproduction: a speaker cabinet which we call an Air-Coupler. In addition, we shall re- port on a series of recently completed experiments which have brought about a substantial improvement in the powerful bass reproduction already made possible by the Air-Coupler. Complete technical details on the experi- ments are given in Radio Communication Magazine, beginning in the October 1951 issue. The articles are replete with charts, graphs, frequency response curves, and other impedimenta 1 . In High-Fidelity, we shall discuss the Air-Coupler without getting involved in technicalities which, to be entirely honest, relatively few people understand anyway! The system works, as a very large number of people have proven to their own entire satisfaction. Let's not, there- fore, examine too closely into why the system works; far better technical minds than the author's have pondered the question at considerable length, only to conclude that, in theory, it cannot produce the results that are obtained in practice! 'For those to whom such things are a delight, copies are available at 35 cents each from Radiocom, Inc., Great Barrington, Mass. 22 As a specific and amusing instance of such scientific confuddlement, we recall the visit to our workshop of an engineer representing a company which manufactures a particularly well-known loudspeaker, which we shall call \"XY\". We were using a 12-in. XY speaker in the Air- Coupler at the time, and demonstrated to our visitor the wonderful, floor-shaking response we were getting at 20 cycles. This engineer insisted that we could not be using the XY speaker, because 12-in. XY units could not re- produce 20 cycles! What is the Air-Coupler? As has been discussed in previous articles in High-Fi- delity, one of the great problems in the reproduction of low frequency sounds bass notes — is that of coup- ling a large body of air to the cone of the loudspeaker. The device under discussion performs that function in an effective if somewhat unorthodox fashion. The Air- Coupler is a low frequency reproducing unit which utilizes any good 12-in. speaker, and which can be used with any good amplifier. It improves bass reproduction greatly when added to an existing amplifier and system of speakers. It is neither complicated nor expensive. As can be seen from Fig. r, the Air-Coupler is a long, rectangular box whose inside dimensions are 70'/$ by 1 4V2 by 4V2 ins. The speaker is mounted on the back panel, and faces into the box. The front of the Air-Coupler is totally enclosed except for a port or opening. www.americanradiohistorv.com The Air-Coupler is usually fabricated from 5 4-in. ply- wood, but it can also be made from other, thicker woods. Because the speaker tends to make the whole enclosure vibrate at low frequencies, the joints should be tightly glued and screwed together. The Air-Coupler can be disposed of in any number of ways so long as it is heavily weighted or well anchored to the floor or wall. From the interior decorating point of view, one of its big advantages is that the small port is the only necessary opening into the room. For people who do not mind cutting a hole 14H by 5 ins. in the floor, preferably near a wall, the Air-Coupler can be mounted under the floor as in Fig. 2. Since floor joists are cus- tomarily spaced 16 ins. on center, a net inside space is available of 14 to 14V2 ins. This corresponds to the in- side width dimension of the standard Air-Coupler. There- fore, the back panel, on which the speaker is mounted, can be cut to slip between the joists, and screwed to a 1 by 2-in. strip attached to the inside edges of each joist. The Air-Coupler can be mounted between studs in a room wall, in a closet, or in the ceiling. In all these ar- rangements, the low-frequency speaker and its enclosure are completely out of sight. If, as is often the case, structural changes to the house are not possible, the Air-Coupler can be laid on its 6-in. side so that there are 2 to 5 ins. clearance from the back of the speaker to the room wall. It can then be covered with a heavy board, and used as a magazine and book shelf, or the board can be covered with cushions and used as a bench or seat. Further thought will suggest other ways of disposing of the Air-Coupler. The only important points are that it must be firmly anchored, and the port must face into the room, though its exact location in the room is of little importance. From the decorating point of view, an indirect advan- tage of the Air-Coupler is that the remainder of the speaker system can be housed in almost any cabinet. It is cus- tomary to think that a good loudspeaker system requires a large enclosure. This is quite true — ■ but only insofar as the reproduction of low frequencies is concerned. With an Air-Coupler, the frequencies below 350 cycles are fed into the speaker on the Air-Coupler. Only fre- quencies above this point are carried by the rest of the Fig. 2. Dimensions of the Air-Coupler are such that it can be mounted between floor joists. It may be necessary to mount the cover between the beams, so as to make the inside depth 0/ the Air-Coupler not more than 4^/2 ins. FRONT VIEW BACK VIEW MATERIAL OF CONSTRUCTION — PLYWOOD OR HEAVIER Fig. 1. The original Air-Coupler was a long, rectangular box. speakers in the system. Since it is a general rule of thumb that baffle or enclosure size is not important above 250 cycles, even a 15-in. coaxial speaker can be tucked away in a 3-cu. ft. enclosure. What Other Equipment Is Necessary? It was stated above that frequencies below 350 cycles were fed to the speaker on the Air-Coupler, and that those above were handled by the other speakers in the system. To divide the frequency spectrum into these two sections, a crossover, or divid- ing, network must be used. This is the only equipment, other than a speaker and the wood for the Air- Coupler, required for a complete installation. Easily assembled components for dividing networks operating at 350 cycles are available commercially, and at reasonable cost. Only two coils or inductances, and two capacitors are required. The coils can be designed and wound by the home experimenter, if desired. Complete details on their construc- tion were given in the December 23 www.americanradiohistorv.com 1950 issue of Radio Communication. 2 It should be pointed out that dividing networks can be designed to operate at any desired frequency. It has been found that best results are obtained with the standard Air-Coupler if a crossover frequency of 350 cycles is used. Experimental Work With Air-Couplers So much for the background of the Air-Coupler design. Built exactly according to instructions, and combined with a middle-range speaker and tweeter, or with a co- axial speaker and connected to the amplifier through the proper dividing network, the Air- Coupler will provide an astonishing improvement in bass reproduction. Any professional carpenter or mod- erately skilled hobbyist can con- struct the case. The rest of the assembly is simplicity itself. On the other hand, those who are experimentally inclined can have many hours of audio fun work- ing with the basic Air-Coupler idea. Fundamentally, it draws upon three different principles of loudspeaker enclosure design: air column, Helmholtz resonator, and acoustic labyrinth. Each of these basic principles has been thorough- ly explored from the theoretical viewpoint. But when the three are combined into a single unit, it requires an analog computer to determine in advance, what result may be expected. Hence, the prac- tical way to make progress with the Air-Coupler is by guess and by gosh . This means that the non- technical hobbyist is just as likely to make a radical improvement as the man with fourteen academic degrees after his name. Since the original series of articles on the Air-Coupler started in the October 1950 issue of Radio Com- munication, hundreds and hun- dreds of people have worked with it. Some have followed the basic design to the letter, and secured results which they usually described by \"never heard anything like it\". Others have gone far afield. O. C. Hoggren, in Chicago, has managed to fold the Air-Coupler so that it is more compact; he is one of the few to develop a successful folded design. L. C. Gal lagher, in Dallas, has a 14-ft. Air-Coupler in his floor And so it goes. Pig. 3. A reflex enclosure /or the Air-Coupler ^Reprints are available at 10 cents each. Our group at High-Fidelity and Radio Communica- tion has continued to experiment. Milton Sleeper, our publisher, started the first wheels turning, a long time back, and then withdrew from the battle to devote his attention to other matters. Roy Allison was most in- strumental in the early work, and was just about to get his slide rule going again when the Navy remembered him from days gone by. Apparently, the Navy tired of hearing about Air-Couplers, for they released him last August. Now, as Editor of Radio Communication, his return to the fold will be felt by all Air-Coupler enthusiasts when they begin reading the series of articles in his publi- cation, describing the changes that have been wrought in the basic Air-Coupler construction. During Allison's absence, the writer continued his experimental efforts, using an approach quite unorthodox from the engineering point of view. An examination of the original design reveals that the sound from the back of the speaker is \"wasted\". In a floor or wall installation, it is totally lost. It seemed logical to try to utilize this sound by bringing it around to the front, where it could reinforce the sound from the Air-Coupler port. A reflex coupler, Fig. 3, was designed and promptly named, be- cause of its bulk, the \"telephone booth\". Results were quite aston- ishing; the sound certainly poured forth in a way not previously ex- perienced. This design was de- scribed in the May 1951 issue of Radio Communication, as an experimental model. Allison promptly advised us that it wouldn't work, since the radiation from the back of the speaker would cancel that from the front. This may be true in theory, and it may be true at one or two specific frequencies, but the overall effect was fantastic. Pedal notes on organ records such as the Bach Toccata and Fugue in D Minor shook the entire room. The next undertaking was to reduce the telephone booth to reasonable size by designing a corner enclosure. At that point, Alan Macy en- tered the picture as an enthusiastic, spare-time worker, and Allison re- turned from the Navy. A major redesign job was under- taken and this time, the technical approach was followed throughout. Thus Allison read the orders of the day, Macy and the writer did the carpentry and generally provided background noise. 24 www.americanradiohistorv.com Equipment Used for Tests A large amount of measuring equipment was brought together for the tests. The photograph, Fig. 4, shows it assembled in one corner of our library-workshop. In essence, the test set-up was this: a Sylvania audio oscil- lator provided pure sound from 20 cycles on up to 20,000. This was fed into a Williamson-type amplifier, previously found to have the necessary flatness of response in the range under examination. The output of the Williamson was connected to whatever speaker was being tested. It is quite simple to measure the impedance of a speaker voice coil over a range of frequencies, and it is often as- sumed that actual frequency response follows the impedance curve. However, it has been shown that there is not neces- sarily any continuous correlation between the impedance of the voice coil and sound power output of a speaker and its enclosure. Hence, we approximated, as closely as possible, the test set-up used by speaker manufac- turers and acoustic laboratories. The actual sound output of various experimental Air- Couplers was picked up by an Altec 21-B microphone (used because of its exceptionally flat response even at room acoustics. For the first frequency run, we had the microphone set up 5 ft. away from the \"telephone booth\". At several frequencies in the 20 to 200 range, the meter indicated almost no sound. Yet, at those same frequen- cies, we could very definitely hear sound and lots of it! If the microphone were moved to a different position, the frequencies at which there was \"no sound\" would change. This phenomenon can bring the most careful work of a design engineer to naught. Even if every link in the chain of audio reproduction could be made absolutely per- fect flat sound source, flat amplifier, and flat speaker and enclosure still, the frequency response heard at any given spot would not be flat. The frequencies at which sharp peaks and valleys occur will change drastically, depending on the microphone location in the room, the shape and size of the room, the number and position of its furnishings, and the degree to which the walls are covered with drapes and other sound-deadening or de- flecting materials. This is not the time to go into a study of room acous- tics. That subject will be dealt with in future issues of High-Fidelity (in the next issue, for that matter, by no less an authority than G. A. Briggs), but the point is I'ig. 4. Equipment used to test frequency response of experimental Air-Couplers included a Sylvania audio oscillator which was fed into the Williamson-type amplifier, directly above it in the illus- tration. Power supply for the Altec 2t-B microphone is shown to the right of the Williamson. The microphone {moved near the equipment for photo- graphic reasons) was connected to a Pickering preamplifier, which was mod- ified to remove bass compensation cir- cuits. This, in turn, wis fed into the Mcintosh •jo-W-2. at right on desk. Out- put of the w-W-2 was measured on the llickok VTVM. very low frequencies), amplified by a Mcintosh 50-watt amplifier, the output of which was read from the Hickok vacuum tube voltmeter. Frequency runs were made on each piece of equipment separately so that compensa- tion could be made for even slight deviation from flatness. Room Acoustics For our first test, we set up the microphone and other equipment right in the workshop, and began taking read- ings over a frequency range from 20 to 200 cycles. Here we ran into a phenomenon which causes engineers who design equipment for home use to turn grey prematurely: brought out here to emphasize once again the importance of adapting and adjusting a high fidelity system to the conditions under which it will be used. For our tests, room acoustics forced us outdoors, to operate under \"free field\" conditions. Literally, we took all the equipment to a location where there were no near- by buildings or other objects which would reflect the sound from the speaker back to the microphone. Dozens of Air-Couplers were built, tested, torn down, rebuilt, and retested. Allison gave off with the theories, and the two carpenters struggled furiously to keep up. At one point, theory got so far ahead of human frailty that though the meter reading was splendid, no sound could be heard! 25 www.americanradiohistorv.com At another point, the carpenters got ahead of the de- sign engineer, and Allison was hard put to it to come up with theories which would account for the various results achieved. A port size would be changed, \"just to see what happens\". \"Such and such will happen\", Allison would say. If it didn't, he would think fast and decide, \"Well, that was based on the assumption that the results would follow the behavior pattern of an air column. If you had given me time to think, I would have realized it would follow a Helmholtz resonator pattern, which, of course, accounts for the results achieved\". Then the carpenters would make some more background noise, and the tests would proceed. The Final Design One day, when rainy weather necessitated a postpone- ment of our outdoor tests, Allison got all his theories going at once and developed the design shown in Fig. 5. The overall size of the Air-Coupler was not changed, but partitions were to be placed inside the unit in such a way as to produce two tubes or air columns, one 7 ft., the other 9 ft. long. Thus, instead of a single 6-ft. air column with a resonant peak at approximately 46 cycles, the new design called for two air columns which would resonate at 30 and at 40 cycles. The result should be smoother response at very low frequencies, and added sound power output at these frequencies. Subsequent tests confirmed Allison's hopes in every detail. Overall response in the range from 20 to 200 cycles was considerably improved. Response was flatter and cleaner. Screwing the front and back panels to the in- ternal partitions strengthened the Air- Coupler and reduced the possibility of panel resonance. Low frequency response between 20 and 40 cycles was improved. Total sound power output on or- chestral selections seemed to be greater, though actually it was slightly less. The apparent increase was due to the fact resonant peaks were flattened, thus producing better balance through- out the frequency range of the Air- Coupler. The dimensions of the outside case, as given in Fig. 5, are the same as for the original design. The change lies only in the addition of the partitions which form the two air columns. Readers who have Air-Couplers can add the partitions very simply. Others are urged to follow the new design from the beginning. The Duplex Air-Coupler, as we named it, can be installed in exactly the same locations (floor, wall, ceiling, closet Vig. 5. The drawing shows the dimen- sions and arrangement of inside parti- tions added to the standard Air-Coupler. door, or on its narrow side as a bench or magazine shelf) as the original design. Corner-Mounted Air-Coupler It still seemed logical to try to use the sound from the back of the speaker to reinforce that from the front. With the old Air-Coupler mounted in the \"telephone booth\", a marked improvement in total sound power output had been achieved. It was logical to hope, at least, that the same result could be secured with the Duplex. How- ever, since we wanted also to redesign the telephone booth into a more compact corner-type enclosure, we started our experiments with this design in mind. It is obviously more complicated to design such a structure, because cancellations can occur between the sound from the main opening and that from the reflex port. Furthermore, a whole series of new enclosure charac- teristics must be taken into consideration. Another air column is involved; so is another Helmholtz resonator. Once again, the problem was ap- proached from a try-it-and-see view- point. Corner-mounted Air-Couplers were built, tested, redesigned and re- tested. The design which has produced the best result so far is shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 9. The photographs in Figs. 6 and 7 are of the test model. The internal structure of the Duplex Air-Coupler is clearly visible in Fig. 6; the overall front appearance is shown in Fig. 7. The type of construction shown in these two illustrations is adequate for experimental purposes, but it should not be followed in a final set-up, because it is impossible to keep the three front panels, as shown in Fig. 7, from loosening up after a few hours of use. Therefore, the construction method shown in Figs. 8 or 9 should be fol- lowed: a Duplex Air-Coupler should be built and then screwed and glued to a large front panel, 35*4 ins. wide and at least 78 ins. high. This panel can then be attached directly to the walls of a room, as in Fig. 8, or two back panels constructed and the front panel attached to them, as in Fig. 9. All tests of this type of design indicated that total sound power out- put was greater than with the Duplex Air-Couple"
