        "text": "I am 24-year-old Jessica Hannan from Ashland, Ohio, and I am back in the music world performing country music again after taking several years off.\n\nI am a dynamic singer who loves performing in front of large and small audiences. I am best known for my stage presence, a beautiful smile and a strong, dynamic voice.\n\nMy resume is quite impressive as it includes many stage performances, including the opening act for Curb recording artist Jeff Carson. I studied voice under the renowned Renee Grant-Williams in Nashville, Tennessee. This came about following a meeting with Blue Diamond Records founder who was so impressed with me that he used his influence to land lessons with this industry giant.\n\nIn spring of 2003, I released my first CD, titled “First Flight,” and WNCO-FM 101.3 began playing the first single titled \"Here Again\"\n\nand followed that with “One of Those Days.” The CD featured 12 songs, including 10 originals, several of which were co-written by me. During the summer of 2003, I performed at more than 50 shows at fairs and festivals throughout the state.\n\nMy career first took off in 2002 after I was named winner of Sonic Records' International Talent Search competition. By winning this event, I was signed as a Sonic Records' recording artist and received the opportunity to record a song in the Sonic Records studio in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Her Sonic Records' single, \"Here Again,\" was played on a number of radio stations throughout the country.\n\nToday, I am performing as lead vocalist with the band, The Shelby Project, and I continue to spend time writing songs and perfecting my guitar playing. My goal is to get as much exposure in the country music world as possible. All of this affirms my dream -- to get an opportunity to go to Nashville and receive a recording contract to sing country music professionally.\n\nPlease check out my videos and music on YouTube at:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/JessicaHannanCountry\n\nAlso, you can catch up with me at some of my other social media sites including:\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/jessicahannancountry\n\nwww.twitter.com/JessicaHannan1"
