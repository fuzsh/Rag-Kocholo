        "text": "The haze is gone, but so are those jobs. I’d run my finger on the white siding of a house, and it’d be rust orange, the residue from the steel mill that loomed, literally and figuratively, over Ashland.\n\nGraveyard-shift men drove home through the dawn, windshield wipers clearing the heavy dew I’ve still only seen in the unique geography where the Appalachian foothills roll right into the Ohio or Big Sandy rivers.\n\nThe rivers and their banks, which separate that corner of Kentucky from both Ohio and West Virginia, were home to Armco Steel and its countless allied industries and, next door in Russell, the largest rail yards at that time in the world. The Eastern Kentucky coalfields sent their coal north to Ashland. A local radio station made it easy for us to remember why, ultimately, most of us were there: WCMI — Where Coal Meets Iron.\n\nWriting a new chapter in EKY: 'Our potential is the real story'\n\nFor shorthand, I told others Ashland is in Eastern Kentucky, but people from the mountains object. I understand. In many ways it was as much Youngstown, Ohio, as it was Pikeville. The Ohio towns across the river are named Ironton. And Coal Grove.\n\nBut it’s no less Kentucky. Pride in the Cats. A (possibly diminishing) distrust of Louisville. The unspoken understanding that Lexington, not Frankfort, is the capital of the state. The physical beauty. The twang that is neither slow nor Southern. The churches. The independence and strength of the people. The optimism. The 25% living below the poverty line.\n\nI’m not the best person to write this. I don’t live in Ashland anymore. My sons, all in their 20s, were raised in Louisville. Ashland to them is the I-64 exit after Frankfort after Lexington after Mount Sterling after Morehead, where their doting grandparents live.\n\nI left after high school. Many did, and continue to. It’s home now to 21,000 people, but there used to be many more. When I started high school in 1973, my classmates assumed that, like their fathers, their futures were secure. The orange glow at night, the rumbling trains and the occasional thunderous boom when hot slag hit cold water were promises that hard work was being done, it paid well, and it would last forever.\n\nAlso: One conversation led to Galen College of Nursing opening an Eastern Kentucky campus\n\nA few ambitious high school friends with union connections joined the “reserve labor pool” for a summer working nights at the mill and made more money than the rest of us in teenage retail made in four summers. A union card, a home and a bass boat awaited. Friends who excelled in science began their engineering careers as interns across town at the Ashland Oil refinery. We ate after midnight at the railroad YMCA after covert rides over the bridge for beer not sold in then-dry Ashland.\n\nIt took longer, I know, but in my own memory in just the four years to graduation it was gone. As if, while we were walking across the gym stage in our plastic maroon graduation robes, shaking the superintendent’s hand, and busting out the doors with our proud parents, the steel mill, the railroad and Ashland Oil. Just. Left.\n\nThe reasons are well-documented elsewhere.\n\nFrom the Monongaleh valley\n\nTo the Mesabi iron range\n\nTo the coal mines of Appalacchia\n\nThe story's always the same\n\nSeven-hundred tons of metal a day\n\nNow sir you tell me the world's changed\n\nOnce I made you rich enough\n\nRich enough to forget my name\n\n— Bruce Springsteen\n\nIn a town that size, everything is connected, like the human body itself. The people who built one of the largest cities in the state at the time from coal, iron and oil lost that lifeblood in a series of heartbreaking blows.\n\nNot everyone, of course, worked at the mill, the railroad, the solvent plant or Ashland Oil. Coal and iron combined to make more than steel. It made a busy commercial and social life.\n\nI didn’t realize how grand Winchester Avenue was, and how unusual for a city our size, until I traveled elsewhere. A broad boulevard — not a small town Main Street — with banks, one of the nation’s first urban indoor malls, department stores, fine hotels and the Paramount Theater, built in 1931 by Paramount Pictures itself as a showplace in one of America’s most prosperous cities. An enormous Central Park with ponds and ball fields. Fine brick streets. Mansions on the hills overlooking the town.\n\nAs the industrial colossus choked and then died, so did those businesses that relied for generations on its prosperity. Empty storefronts and thrift shops lined Winchester when I returned. Like their neighbors in the southeastern mountains, the money men had taken all they wanted and left.\n\nNot just treating symptoms of poverty: We are transforming Appalachia Kentucky\n\nIn EKY, we don't need a savior: We need to reinvest in Appalachian people\n\nBut here’s the thing about generations of women and men who’ve done hard work. They don’t quit. They helped build a nation, and now they took to rebuilding their home. The task could have seemed overwhelming. The population shrank. Young people did what young people do and left for more opportunity.\n\nSurrounded by rural counties that had struggled for generations with the ill health and pain that are the product of poverty — a political failure shared by both parties — medical providers began replacing steel workers.\n\nAshland’s hospitals and specialty practices grew and recruited doctors from around the world. By becoming a center of healing, Ashland was also healing itself.\n\nI only have one hometown, so I have to assume others would say the same about theirs: It’s the people.\n\nWhether it’s the crossroads location, the ore still under the ground, the heavy dew or the shared history, the community continues to produce champions, stars and leaders well out of proportion to its size. (In truth, it’s the Giovanni’s pizza. Not the one on Route 60, the one out on Argillite Road. You’re welcome).\n\nWhere the railroads and rivers used to connect Ashland to the world, technology and committed leadership does today. Families enjoy safe streets, good schools, parks and a community that never stopped celebrating — anything you can imagine — together on its riverfront, plazas and wide boulevards.\n\nYou may live in a town in which your mayor or city council member is singing the lead role in \"Oklahoma!\" or just won \"Dancing With The Stars\" at a bigger-than-Broadway theater downtown. But I doubt it.\n\nYou may like: Mitch McConnell scored a victory for Kentucky steel workers in Carroll County\n\nEvery day on the way to school I passed the Ashland Works. That’s what steel companies called their mills — “works.” When I was little and still figuring out language, the label seemed odd to me. Now I realize that, unintentionally, truer words have never been spoken: Ashland does, indeed, work, when given the chance.\n\nThe flames atop the blast furnaces burned purple-blue, with orange traces, like mythical torches high above the unimaginably massive steel mill below, all day and night. Whether you worked there or not, they were part of you.\n\nOnly one furnace remains now, cold and silent, with no flame. As it happens, though, what burned so bright wasn’t the coke and iron ore, it was the people of Ashland. That flame still burns.\n\nMarc Murphy is an attorney and political cartoonist whose work is published in the Courier Journal and courierjournal.com."
