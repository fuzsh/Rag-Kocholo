Who would be in the lineage of programming and what would be introduced..I'd have to ponder...\n\nThe only one close that I could think of would be Steve Wainstead back in the '80's.\n\nHis show, \"Wainstead All Night\", on WCSB 89.3 from Cleveland State U. kept me aloft during my night shift at a printing company in Medina. Party line conference call-ins, little or no dump button for language. Zappa, and plenty of it. Tube Bar (before Jerky Boys) and all kinds of mayhem...ended the show with Zappas \"Watermelon in Easter Hay\"\n\nCheck this out...for Mp3's on his shows\n\nhttp://www.panix.com/~swain/inc.html\n\nLast edited by newmex; 11-19-2008 at 06:35 PM..\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Fresh Air Friend\n\nFresh Air offered probably the first tastes of rap music with the recordings by the Last Poets. Of course, back then...1975 or 1976, the Last Poets were considered Jazz, but basically they were at the roots of rap, if not the founders of it. .playlist radio has distilled the music to the point that all flavor has been completely removed.\n\nYes.\n\nI remember the first time I heard the Last Poets. And Gil Scott-Heron.\n\nIt was more like 1972-73.\n\nI was blown away by White Man Got a God Complex, When the Revolution Comes, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised. Talk about consciousness-raising.\n\nThing is, their work still sounds fresh (and timely, and oh-so-appropriate) today.\n\nI love mixes, but agree about playlist radio.\n\nI miss those album side weekends, too..."
