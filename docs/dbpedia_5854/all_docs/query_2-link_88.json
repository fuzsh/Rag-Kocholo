        "text": "History of The Day of Illustrious Puerto Ricans\n\nPuerto Ricans are the inhabitants and residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as well as their descendants. The Tano, who called the island Borikén, were the original inhabitants of Puerto Rico. However, as in other parts of the Americas, the native people quickly declined in number after the arrival of Spanish settlers.\n\nPuerto Rico is a United States of America territory (Commonwealth), and Puerto Ricans share common citizenship, currency, and defense. Even though Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they do not pay federal income taxes and cannot vote in presidential elections. Puerto Ricans do not need a work visa (also known as a green card) to reside and/or work in the U.S. because they are citizens.\n\nPuerto Ricans identify as Americans but are incredibly proud of their island and heritage. They usually refer to themselves as “Puertorriqueños” or “Boricuas,” rather than “Americans” or “Americanos.” Most Puerto Ricans define “my country” as “Puerto Rico,” not “the United States.” Boricua, derived from the Tano word Boriken, is used to express Puerto Ricans’ pride in their Tano heritage. Boriken is translated as “the great land of the valiant and noble Lord.” Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Tano people used the name Borikén.\n\nBarbosa, de Diego, Muñoz Rivera, de Hostos, Luis Muñoz Marín, Ramón Emeterio Betances, Ernesto Ramos-Antonini, Román Baldorioty de Castro, and Luis A. Ferré are all honored on this day. The Day of Illustrious Puerto Ricans aims to encourage the present generation of Boricuas to recognize the contributions that these great leaders made to the rise of the national identity of Puerto Ricans."
