        "text": "Quick Facts\n\nHOSTOS FACTS\n\n2023 - 2024\n\nHostos Community College was established in the heart of the South Bronx in 1968 in response to the protests of the predominantly Puerto Rican local community, who took to the streets to demand access to higher education within their neighborhood.\n\nNamed after the Puerto Rican philosopher, pedagogue, and writer Eugenio María de Hostos (1839-1903), the institution reflects his unwavering dedication to progress, education, and justice.\n\nPresently, Hostos boasts a culturally diverse student body, with the majority coming from Dominican, Puerto Rican, or Central and South American backgrounds. Hostos students are predominantly Hispanic (52.6%) and Black (37.9%), and upwards of three-quarters of them speak a language other than English at home.\n\nTwo-thirds of Hostos students live in the Bronx. Sixty-nine percent are female, and 31% are male. The average age of Hostos students is 25 years old.\n\nOffering 28 associate degree programs and two certificate programs, Hostos provides students with a clear path to seamless transfers to four-year colleges within CUNY and beyond. Notably, Hostos graduates have regularly achieved admission to prestigious universities, including the Ivy League.\n\nRobust financial assistance programs further underscore the College's commitment to educational success. Ninety-five (95%) of our student population is eligible for financial aid.\n\nImpressively, 58% of the student population is first-generation college attendees, emphasizing the institution's dedication to breaking down educational barriers.\n\nThe College has twice been recognized as a Top Ten Community College in the nation by the Aspen Institute for Community College Excellence.\n\nHostos President Daisy Cocco De Filippis of Hostos is recognized as a trailblazing leader in higher education. Recently, the New York League of Puerto Rican Women named her Woman of the Year, and she was included in the prestigious 2023 Higher Education Power 100.\n\nAnother resounding endorsement of the College’s work was the generous $15 million gift from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, which has been used to fund scholarships, establish the Hostos Research Center, and other initiatives.\n\nThe Division of Continuing Education and Workforce Development’s Community Health Worker Training Program received a three-year $3 million grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHostos is home to the Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture (HCAC), a leading Latino arts center in the northeast, reflecting the cultural richness and talent of the community.\n\nThe College is actively engaged in multiple National Science Foundation projects focused on STEM education and socio-economic mobility. As of Fall 2023, there are 6 NSF projects at Hostos, the most in the College’s history.\n\nOur faculty is also a model of inclusivity. 60% of our full-time faculty are women, and over 50% identify as non-White.\n\nHostos’ staff also embodies the diversity ethos, with 58% being female and a significant 85% hailing from non-White backgrounds.\n\nOur academic bona fides are also solid: 53% of our full-time faculty hold doctoral-level degrees, and includes Fulbright grant recipients and world-renowned artists who have exhibited internationally.\n\nWe are the only community college in New York City to offer a Game Design program. And only 2-year institution in New York to offer a paid internship as part of educational and training experience in the gaming industry.\n\nThe Hostos Repertory Company achieved success at the International Collegiate Theater Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2013, Hostos was the first ever community college to be invited. This year was the third time the College participated in the Festival.\n\nHostos alumna Kay Bell was named the 2023-2025 Bronx Poet Laureate, promoting poetry and creative expression within the community.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, the College received a $1.5 million grant from Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson for cafeteria renovations.\n\nIn April, Hostos was awarded the Title V Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions grant from the Dept. of Education. The five-year $2.86 million grant is to help the college improve student access, increase retention, and improve graduation rate.\n\nAs part of the FY2023 Congressional Budget, Hostos received a $1 million earmark, secured by Congressman Ritchie Torres, to support undergraduate transfer opportunities to Queens College, City College, and Columbia University."
