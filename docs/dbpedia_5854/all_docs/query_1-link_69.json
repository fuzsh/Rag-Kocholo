        "text": "My grandfather, Cosmo Damiano Depinto was born on May 15, 1939 in the small town of Molfetta, Italy. He is the son of Nicoletta Depinto, his mother, who was one of three siblings. Her two sisters were named Lina and Giovanna. His mother had a full time job as a seamstress. His grandmother was responsible for making fishing nets. His grandfather, Orazio, had a similar profession in the fishing industry and and worked as a local fisherman. But unfortunately he passed away when a mine blew up while he was fishing in his boat after World War I (1914-1918).\n\nSandra Cisneros, an author who is deeply inspired by her Mexican American heritage. This inspiration is clearly shown throughout every one of her writing pieces such as “Salvador Late or Early” and “Eleven”. Both short-stories focus on adolescents with a mature mindset and adult precision, and each story does a marvelous job portraying Cisneros constant writing style. “Salvador Late or Early” is focusing on a young boy, Salvador, with heavy burdens to carry on his shoulders, which is unfortunate because he is such a young boy with an old soul. The responsibilities he has are unimaginable due to the fact they don’t pertain to his age. The short-story “Eleven” is about an eleven-year-old girl named Rachel, a forthright character who explains\n\nCuba is merely one example of a society. Juan Cabrera is simply an ordinary example of an individual. What The Lonely Crossing of Juan Cabrera by J. Joaquin Fraxedas bring to light is the extraordinary effects of stepping outside the comfort zone of following the expectations of those that lead our governments. Although the situation was unlike our own it highlights what could very well could have\n\nThe author and researcher of Punished: Policing the Lives of Black and Latino Boys, Victor M. Rios, was a former gang member from Oakland as well, who learned in his adolescence what a small break from police and educators could mean for a boy on his way to prison. Rios made it out of gang life through the support of concerned teachers, and a very fortunate break from a cop who gave him a last chance. After the death of his best friend and countless negative interactions with the police, Rios was forced to reflect upon the larger image of youth violence and criminalization. He wanted and needed to find out the reason of the prevalence of youth and police violence in his community. After graduating college, and attending graduate school,\n\n1. In the “Latino Threat Narrative”, Chavez believes that the international terrorism of 911 acts as a trigger and strikes which raised the alarm of the national identity crisis of the United States in 2011, meanwhile, it also further threatens the survival and image of Latino unlimitedly. When the American witnessed the tragedy and the danger of their country in 911, their patriotism leads them to perceive the foreigners, specially the Latino and Mexican as a threat, heresy or even enemy who threaten the stability and security of the national identity. Due to the rapid growth of the Latino population in the United State, the Latino not only constitutes as a threat on the national security, but also labeled as an illegally radicalized ethnics groups or even “illegal Aliens” who rejects to assimilate into the mainstream of American culture and their alienation even make the United State further loss its cohesion. As a result, the American is facing the danger of disintegration.\n\nThe port Rican writer Miguel Pinero describes the struggle of Latin people who came to America and faced all the harms and worries. From the title of the poem, “Seeking the Cause”, we, the readers, notice how the writer is portraying the distressing situation of the Latin people through a person died seeking the reason behind his misery. According to Pinero,\n\nGloria Anzaldua’s short essay, Towards a New Consciousness, begins with the description of her mixed culture, a mestiza, and the conflicts she faces in being torn between being Mexican and Native American. Anzaldua expresses her struggle of her torn heritages by describing herself as being caught between two cultures and their values. Instead of being able to love and respect both cultures, Anzaldua feels as if we people feel the need to take up one side of our heritage and end up hating the other part. She paints an image as standing on an opposite side of a riverbank, yelling back and forth answers and questions showing that we eventually end up favoring one side and only getting pieces of the other\n\nCulture shock: what white America feels after reading this book. Juan Gonzalez’s Harvest of Empire encases what most Latinos want to say, but always gets muted for. The empowerment behind the title is such an intricacy yet soft to the touch. This book will make any reader reconsider about everything they’ve learned from any culture. This book covers most atrocities committed to Latin America by Spain and the US. The factor of white hegemony, hunger for power and possessions, discrimination, conquest, and the terrorization by Americans in Latin America makes this book difficult to read as a Latina. The limelight of this book is in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Mexico because how relatively close these three countries are in relation to the US. Gonzalez’s main argument of this book is to demonstrate to America how Latino presence is becoming a commonality and it will be normalized. Furthermore, it talks about the second wave of immigration and how pivotal it has become. Finally, he discusses\n\nAnzaldúa recounts her experience growing up in a community where her Chicana culture wasn’t widely accepted. She would be punished for speaking the language her culture influenced to create a language, which corresponds to a way of life. In Gloria Anzaldúa’s “How to Tame a Wild Tongue” the variety of languages helps her compare, contrast and define her argument of the distinguished languages concerning her Chicana identity.\n\nThe once powerful Spanish Empire was hanging onto a thread as Cuba and Puerto Rico were their last two major colonies. Tension between the Cuban people and the Spaniards had been building since the beginning of Spanish reign over the island in 1492. One of the leading issues was the “impact of increased taxation and an international economic crisis” (LOC). Spain was exploiting Cuba for its sugar plantations and treating the locals very poorly. This poor treatment and taxation by Spain would lead to the “Ten Years' War” (LOC), from 1868 to 1878, in which the Cubans\n\nLouis Hémon creates a story of the rural life in a family of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, the Chapdelaine’s. He uses the climate and traditional values in a way in which the novel still has an ironic and crucial element. Also, the beginning of the novel on Ite, missa est[1] is (“the mass”) a claim on religious behaviour, a main theme in this novel. Maria Chapdelaine, a novel personifying the spirit of French Canada at its most romantic, was written by\n\nThe next portion of the paper analyses the film “The Revolution is Us” by David C. Stone. She criticizes this documentary by saying that it only tells a single story of what it means to be Cuban under the Revolution. In this instance she is referring to this Pacheco, who in the mind tells the story of what it means to be Cuban in the eyes of a manipulative government. Pacheco is a man who mentions that he would die for the revolution and feels that he in forever indented or at the service of the Revolution. Later on in this section Guerra mentions the “absence of all the most integrated Cubans from the collection deliberately provides tunnel vision into Cuban society; yet this is an advantage in that one sees citizen- deputies actively\n\nI will be discussing how the country of Puerto Rico’s impact of resource scarcity, issues with boundary delineation, separatism and sovereignty issues, poverty, migration, legacies of colonialism and imperialism, global climate change and its impact. The once poor nation of Puerto Rico now seems to be a stepping stone for trading in the Caribbean. With its location in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico is a major asset for shipping lanes. One of the main reasons the U.S. wanted to take over this land. Its geographical location is important in helping to move resources around the world, as well as keeping an eye on Cuba. The economic system of\n\nThe caribbean is where a small island, contains two countries within its borders and a long history of conflict. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are two different country, with completely different cultures, from religion, to the food they eat, Two countries, with two different, yet correlating stories. A story of conflict is what unites these two countries. This paper will attempt to analyse that story, and answer how this small island came to be divided into two countries, and inhabited by two peoples of such different cultures. This paper will also take a small look at the results of this history, and it’s effects on both countries."
