        "text": "History of Hostos Community College\n\nHostos Community College was created by an act of the Board of Higher Education on April 22, 1968, in response to the demands of Puerto Rican and other Hispanic leaders who urged the establishment of a college to meet the needs of the South Bronx. In September 1970, Hostos admitted a charter class of 623 students at the site of a former tire factory at 475 Grand Concourse. Enrollment grew rapidly to more than 2,000 students by June of 1974. In addition, the State Legislature acted to ease an increasing space shortage by passing a special bill to acquire the “500 Building” across the Grand Concourse from the original site. In the same year, Hostos was granted full and unconditional accreditation following a highly favorable evaluation by the Middle States Association.\n\nThe fiscal crisis of the mid-1970’s resulted in an effort to merge Hostos with another institution as a cost-saving measure. This effort was rebuffed by strong college and community opposition, which led the State Legislature to include a guarantee of Hostos’ existence in the Landes Higher Education Act, passed on June 9, 1976. To meet growing interest in the College, the campus now has six buildings, three of which have been specially designed to meet the institution’s need. Hostos takes pride in its well-equipped science, math, writing, and computer labs; its excellent physical education facilities; and its state-of-the-art theatres.\n\nFaculty and Students\n\nAs of the Fall 2002, 50.3 percent of the full-time faculty hold doctorates and 45.5 percent have master's degrees. The student population is diverse with nearly all cultures represented, the majority identifying themselves as being of Dominican, Puerto Rican, or of Central or South American descent. Financial assistance is provided to all eligible students, and nearly 90 percent receive some form of Federal or State aid.\n\nAccreditation and Affiliations\n\nHostos Community College is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York.\n\nThe College offers career programs accredited by the New York State Education Department, the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology, and the American Dental Association. The Allied Health programs are accredited by the appropriate agencies, including the American Dental Association and the New York Department of Health.\n\nIn addition, Hostos Community College is a member of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, the American Council on Education, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, the American Education Research Association, the National Association for Bilingual Education, and other professional and learned organizations devoted to the advancement of education."
