        "text": "EL Education\n\nEugenio María de Hostos is a network school under EL Education. EL Education is a school reform model that emphasizes high achievement through active learning, character growth, and teamwork. Students engage in their learning through expeditions, case studies, and projects. Students demonstrate ownership of their learning when they engage in Student-Led Conferences biannually.\n\nIn EL Education schools, each student is known well by at least one adult within the school. One structure for developing this relationship—and supporting students socially, emotionally, and academically—is crew. Crew allows students to build positive connections with their peers and with their crew leader. At EMHCS, we are CREW!\n\n​\n\nElementary Education\n\nAt Eugenio María de Hostos Charter School, our students at the K-2 grade level begin schooling in a Dual Language Program (See Bilingual Education). Students learn literacy instruction in their dormant language and learn math, science, and social studies in both Spanish and English. This establishes a foundation in both languages for students. Once they begin 3rd grade, they transition out of a Dual Language Program model and receive their instruction primarily in English while they continue to develop the Spanish language.\n\nThe curriculum is aligned with the Next Generation Standards. Teachers use a multitude of resources (Illustrative Math, EL Education 2.0 Modules, PebbleGo, Generation Genius, Descubre Listos, Elevate Science, and Aleks) to create rigorous and engaging units and lessons.\n\n​\n\nMiddle School\n\nStudents in grades 7 and 8 at Eugenio María de Hostos Charter School continue their core instruction in English while further developing the Spanish language through either World Language: Spanish courses or Spanish Language Arts courses (see Bilingual Education). Both language pathways lead to students earning the Seal of Biliteracy upon graduation. Eighth-grade students have the opportunity to gain high school credit through Honors classes in Math, Science, and Spanish.\n\n​\n\nThe curriculum is aligned with the Next Generation Standards. Teachers use a multitude of resources (Illustrative Math, Aleks, EL Education 2.0 Modules, Mosa Mack, and Encuentros) to create rigorous and engaging units and lessons.\n\n​\n\nHigh School\n\n​EMHCS is ​committed to ensuring all students graduate with a Regents Diploma. EMHCS offers the opportunity for multiple diploma designations, such as an Advanced Regents Diploma, the Seal of Biliteracy, and the Seal of Civiic Readiness. All students complete a capstone course in their senior year with a focus on social justice. Elective courses include:\n\nCareer & Financial Management\n\nDigital Electronics\n\nDesign & Drawing for Production\n\nStudio Art\n\nGraphic Art\n\nSocial Justice\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nSports & Entertainment Marketing\n\nAccess the Seal of Civic Readiness here.\n\n​\n\nAssessment\n\nAt EMHCS, assessments are looked at as a tool to measure student growth and ensure the instructional practices meet the needs of each student.\n\n​"
