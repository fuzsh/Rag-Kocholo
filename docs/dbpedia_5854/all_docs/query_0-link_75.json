        "text": "Hostos, Eugenio Maria de (1839-1903).\n\nPuerto Rican educator and man of letters. Hostos was educated in Spain, where he wrote La peregrinacion de Bayoan (1863), a political novel, and fought for the short-lived republic of 1868. His hopes that Puerto Rico might be granted autonomy with Santo Domingo and Cuba in a confederation of the Antilles were dashed by the imperialist attitude of the Spanish republicans. Hostos is remembered not only as a patriot, but also as an enlightened teacher, dedicated to progress and truth. His best-known work, Moral social (1888), is a guide to ethical social conduct, which was designed as a school text. He also wrote an excellent essay (1872) on Hamlet."
