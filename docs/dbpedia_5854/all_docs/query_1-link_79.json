He lived in Argentina and then, returning to New York, became involved in a mission to carry reinforcements to the Cubans, who were fighting for their independence (1895).\n\nHostos next went to the Dominican Republic, where he edited Las tres Antillas.\n\nDuring his 10 years there, he started the country's first normal school.\n\nHe formed the League of Puerto Rican Patriots and led the commission that presented United States president William McKinley with a plan that would allow a Puerto Rican plebiscite to decide whether Puerto Rico should be annexed to the United States or become independent.\n\nThe commission failed and no plebiscite was held. Hostos left Puerto Rico in 1900, again disillusioned. He returned to Santo Domingo, at that government's invitation."
