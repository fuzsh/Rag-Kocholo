        "text": "Ham Newsletter\n\nEntropy Arbitrage\n\nPull Requests\n\nDash\n\nNext\n\nToday, many Puerto Rican communities celebrate Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos, ‚Äúthe Great Citizen of the Americas.‚Äù He was a vocal advocate for independent rule of former Spanish colonies, fought race and sex discrimination in South America, rebuilt secular educational systems in multiple countries, and taught throughout the Americas.\n\nOn to my work for the week.\n\nHam Newsletterüîó\n\nAfter running into some issues generating the December newsletter, Ham Newsletter now uses a simpler syntax to avoid potential errors.\n\nEntropy Arbitrageüîó\n\nThe blog‚Äôs code now finally generates the JSON file with post titles matched to URLs, which Ham Newsletter uses. I have also cleaned up the explanation of when the newsletter goes out, in the slide-out panel to the right.\n\nEach issue of the newsletter is released on the Saturday of the Sunday-to-Saturday week including the last day of the month.\n\nIt‚Äôs still slightly clunky, but it‚Äôs much better than (paraphrasing) ‚Äúthe first Saturday of the month, unless the month ends on a Saturday, in which case it‚Äôs the last day of the month.‚Äù\n\nPull Requestsüîó\n\nI merged an automated pull request for Chroma Schema bumping a library version.\n\nDashüîó\n\nWhile not a new project, after needing to reconstruct some pieces because of my assorted laptop woes, I finally decided to publish my ‚Äúmorning dashboard‚Äù script Dash. The code hasn‚Äôt gone out yet, but the repository is waiting for it, probably today.\n\nSome of this will be old code, since I‚Äôve used it for years, but one of the reasons that I haven‚Äôt published it before now is that I constantly tweak it as I find small issues that annoy me or decide to add another tiny piece of information that I might want to see in the mornings. Because of that, sometimes the files might not quite be synchronized, if code needs a specific new style or configuration option that I haven‚Äôt finalized.\n\nI‚Äôve tried to keep the code relatively modular, at least.\n\nNextüîó\n\nI‚Äôll obviously finish up posting the current state of Dash and may extend it once or twice. I also still have pull requests to merge."
