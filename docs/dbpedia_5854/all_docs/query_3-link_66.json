        "text": "The production of Hostos is very extensive and varied, and, despite such diversity, is presided over for the most part by the same ideals of freedom, in the political field, and humanism, in the educational field, that always guided his life trajectory.\n\nThis selection of Essays by Eugenio María de Hostos contains some of his best-known social texts. We also include others of a more literary nature, such as the essay on “Hamlet” and some dialogue vignettes. Reflections on “Women’s Science Education”; the condition of “El Cholo” or the Battle of Ayacucho.\n\nAmong the essays gathered here we highlight “The abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico”, where the author analyzes the parliamentary debate that decided the liberation of slaves in his country. Here is a passage:\n\n“The Republicans, who had remained silent as long as the project did not go beyond such, were frightened to leave to the radicals of the monarchical government the glory of so transcendental a reform, and Mr. Castelar presented a proposal in which the immediate abolition of slavery was purely and simply requested.\n\nHe delivered a speech of his own, in which speaking of everything except the law under discussion, and in which taking and expanding and applying to his whim the theory of national mediators, invented by Quinet to demonstrate the necessity of Alsace and Lorraine being French, he took advantage of his easy glory. (…)\n\nThe Republican Party, already victorious, began by postponing the abolition law; But urged again by outside influences, he put the tormented project back into debate. What had been necessary for the radicals when they were in power seemed to them outside of it a great danger and radical motions against immediate abolition rained down.”\n\nEugenio María de Hostos y Bonilla (Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, 1839-Santo Domingo, 1903). Puerto Rican politician, educator and writer. A man of liberal ideas, he was influenced by Krausism and positivism. He devoted his life to a double ideal: the independence of his homeland and the education of peoples."
