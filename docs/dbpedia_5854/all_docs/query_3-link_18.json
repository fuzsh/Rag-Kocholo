        "text": "Nearly all human beings love, but nearly none know how to love.\n\nBy educating women to use all their brains, men will not only be just, but will also ensure the future of a new social order in which women will apply their intelligence and warm feelings to the problems of living. Men are fools to entrust the upbringing of their sons, whom they expect to grow up to love freedom, to women who have never known freedom themselves.\n\nThere are complete men and incomplete men. If you would be a complete man, put all of your soul's strength into all of your life's actions.\n\nIf you wish to know what justice is, let injustice pursue you.\n\nLend your light to the blind. Why should the wickedness of men irritate you, when it is only blindness?\n\nWhen you cannot be just through virtue, be so through pride.\n\nIdeas are born, they struggle, triumph, change, and they are transformed; but is there a dead idea which in the end does not live on, transformed into a broader and clearer goal?\n\nSlavery has as many shapes among us as there are things we need.\n\nWhen you cannot be just because of your nature, be so through your pride."
