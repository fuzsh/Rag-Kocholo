        "text": "In a weekly series, Ed Trust–NY will highlight New York FAFSA Challenge Winners for the 2021-2022 school year and the promising strategies they used to support more students to complete the FAFSA.\n\nThis year at Eugenio Maria de Hostos Charter School (EMHCS) began as a struggle as students returned to school in person. When it came to FASFA and college applications, the school had to use all of the resources available. At the start of the school year, staff met one-on-one with students and parents to help them understand things such as the importance of their tax returns. The school also reached out to the Rochester College Access network for support. The network team came into the building once every two weeks and helped students complete applications.\n\nYeriel, who will receive the FAFSA Challenge scholarship is smart, dedicated, and ambitious. He understands the meaning of hard work. He is also constantly helping others around him. He has been accepted to St. John Fisher College to study biology."
