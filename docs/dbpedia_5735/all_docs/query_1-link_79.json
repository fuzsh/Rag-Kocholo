        "text": "Anyone here have an appreciation for 'Mark I' of Deep Purple?\n\nThis first line-up covers the band's first three albums: Shades of Deep Purple, Book of Taliesyn and Deep Purple.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not about to start telling you the band's first line-up is the second coming of Christ and that what you're about to uncover are hidden masterpieces the world has done themselves a disfavour of mostly overlooking, but I do believe that their first three albums are solid releases that get unfairly overlooked, even by Deep Purple fans.\n\nNow, I haven't actually heard In Rock and anything post-Mark 1 as I'm listening to their albums in order of release date, but I'm quite familiar with Shades of Deep Purple and their self-titled third album and have heard Book of Taliesyn a few times. I enjoy all of them. There's not a song on neither their first or third albums that I dislike, and I haven't heard their second enough to judge but I've liked it every time.\n\nWhat convinced me to make this thread was their third album, though. It's a big-step up production wise (it sounds very good -- stereo drums!) and it has some great playing on it. Their cover of Donovan's 'Lalena' is superb. A truly beautiful song that has helped me get through some stuff. The rest is at a very high quality. Unfortunately, outside of the awesome 'Hush', I don't see these albums mentioned... anywhere! I just heard Hush while playing a video game and had to give the album another listen... yep, still good!\n\nAnyone else here enjoy some early DP? (Also, I know I've been making a lot of threads lately... this is my last for a while, I promise )\n\nI got a cassette out of the local library a long, long time ago with Shades on one side and Taliesyn on the other and have loved both albums since. I have both on CD, and the Early Years compilation, but for some reason I've never owned the S/T.\n\nI don't think there's much doubt that Deep Purple Mark II was a better and definitely more significant band, and I like a lot of what they did, but I still have a lot of affection for those first two albums."
