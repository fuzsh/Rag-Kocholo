Disaffiliated from NBC in 1955. (At the time, Altoona/State College was a separate market from Johnstown, who already had an NBC affiliate (WJAC-TV), and WFBG-TV/WTAJ-TV had long claimed the Johnstown market as part of its coverage area.) Ames-Des Moines, Iowa WOI-TV 5 (now WOI-DT) 1950–1954 (secondary) ABC WHO-DT 13 Secondary affiliation, with CBS as its primary affiliation. Lost NBC affiliation upon the sign-on of WHO-TV due to WHO radio's long-time affiliation with the NBC Radio Network. Fort Dodge-Des Moines, Iowa KQTV/KVFD-TV 21/50 1953–1977 Defunct Served as the NBC affiliate for the Fort Dodge area. Ceased operations in 1977 due to a tornado causing damage to KVFD-TV's studio and transmitter, and the next year's death of station owner Edward J. Breen. Des Moines, Iowa KDSM-TV 17 1984–1987 (secondary) Fox Cleared NBC programs not cleared by the network's existing affiliate WHO-TV. Disaffiliated from NBC in 1987.

KHAR-TV 13 (now KYUR) 1970–1971 ABC Swapped affiliations with ABC affiliate KENI-TV in October 1971, reuniting NBC with its original Anchorage affiliate (KFIA/KENI-TV was a joint primary of NBC and ABC from 1953 to 1967, and a secondary affiliate (with ABC as its primary affiliation) from 1967 until KHAR-TV took the NBC affiliation in 1970).

The deal reunited ABC with its original Atlanta affiliate, since WSB-TV carried a secondary affiliation from 1949 until WXIA-TV signed on (as WLTV) in 1951. WVEU 69 (now WUPA) 1985–1986, 1989–1994 (both secondary) Independent Secondary affiliation (WVEU was an independent station); cleared NBC programming not cleared by the network's existing affiliate WXIA-TV.

From December 1968 to 1970, WATU-TV served as a full-time NBC affiliate; however, NBC allowed WJBF and CBS affiliate WRDW-TV to \"cherry-pick\" its strongest programming because, in addition to its weak signal, television sets in the area were not capable of receiving UHF channels. Disaffiliated from NBC entirely when WATU-TV returned to the air in 1974. WRDW-TV 12 1967–1974 (secondary) CBS Secondary affiliation, with CBS as its primary affiliation; shared with ABC affiliate WJBF. From December 1968 to 1970, WATU-TV served as a full-time NBC affiliate; however, NBC allowed WRDW-TV and WJBF to \"cherry-pick\" its strongest programming because, in addition to its weak signal, television sets in the area were not capable of receiving UHF channels.

WATU-TV/WAGT 26 1968–1970, 1974–2017 Defunct Initially left the air in 1970, unable to compete with WRDW-TV and WJBF because, in addition to its weak signal, television sets in the area were not capable of receiving UHF channels, but returned to the air in 1974.

WINR-TV/WICZ-TV 40 1957–1996 Fox Disaffiliated from NBC and joined Fox as the result of an affiliation agreement signed the previous fall between Fox and WICZ's owners, Stainless Broadcasting Company. Between then and April 1996 when WICZ's full-time Fox affiliation began, the station heavily preempted NBC programming in favor of Fox Kids programming. Elmira-based NBC affiliate WETM-TV subsequently launched a cable-only version of the station to serve the Binghamton area under a LMA with Time Warner Cable. This programming would eventually move to W08DL in 1997.
