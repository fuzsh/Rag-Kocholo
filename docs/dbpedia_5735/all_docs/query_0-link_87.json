They are used mostly for infomercials and classified ads. They also broadcast sports shows, such as Heartland Poker and Midwest Outdoor Magazine, as well as public affairs shows such as Comcast Newsmakers. Comcast Television was launched on March 1, 2008, after the closure of Comcast Local.\n\nOn August 15, 2008, Comcast launched Comcast Television 2, which also shows infomercials and classified ads. Comcast Television 2 is also used for Fox Sports Detroit's overflow feed, Fox Sports Detroit Plus.[2]\n\nLocal sports[edit]\n\nOne of the original shows on Comcast Television is the Detroit Tigers monthly magazine show Your Tiger Ticket, which is also available on Comcast's On Demand service for customers in Michigan. Other local sports content includes MHSAA Network telecasts of regular season and state championship games, GLIAC football games, CCHA hockey games, as well as high school and college sports magazine shows. With this local sports coverage, Comcast Television could be considered a small regional sports network, even though it does not air sports programs on a regular schedule or have rights to major professional and college teams like other regional sports networks, and it airs a lot more infomercials and classified ads than other regional sports networks.\n\nComcast Television is not part of Comcast SportsNet (owned by entertainment subsidiary NBCUniversal), since local broadcast rights to major Michigan sports teams are owned by Fox Sports Detroit, Big Ten Network, the ESPN family of networks, Fox Sports, CBS Sports and the Detroit Lions Television Network.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nComcast Local[edit]\n\nComcast Local (also known as CL) was a regional sports network from 2005â€“2008 that carried collegiate, high school and minor league sports from the Detroit area, throughout Michigan and central Indiana. The network also carried coverage from the Comcast SportsNets, (although it was not a separate Comcast SportsNet affiliate) such as Chicago Fire MLS matches from CSN Chicago and the Canadian Football League (simulcasted from CBC affiliate CBET-DT).\n\nThe network carried infomercials from 12AM ET until 6AM and at other various times throughout the day.\n\nComcast Local was used for Fox Sports Detroit's overflow feed, Fox Sports Detroit Plus; such usage continues today on Comcast Television 2.\n\nThe station was the cable television home of Michigan's Big Ten and Mid-American Conference teams as well as the Grand Valley State University Lakers and the Grand Rapids Rampage. After the formation of the Big Ten Network, Comcast Local produced selected Eastern Michigan University Eagles football games for WXYZ-TV in Detroit.[citation needed]\n\nComcast Local ceased operations on February 29, 2008, merging with a number of other Comcast properties in Metro Detroit to form Comcast Television.[citation needed]. Today, the rights to the EMU Eagles are owned by Fox Sports Detroit, making them cable exclusive, while ESPN Plus owns the rights to the Central Michigan University Chippewas (through WNEM-DT2) and the Western Michigan University Broncos (through WXSP-CA).[citation needed] WXSP-CA also owns the television rights to Grand Rapids' minor league sports teams and the GVSU Lakers.\n\nFormer Comcast Local personalities[edit]\n\nThe sports broadcasters on Comcast Local included:\n\nJoe Abramson: High School Football Analyst\n\nRod Beard: Prep Ticket Host\n\nClarence Black: College Basketball Analyst\n\nMatt Dery: College Basketball Play-by-Play\n\nRoger Faulkner: Soccer Analyst\n\nRon Gillum: High School Football Analyst\n\nMark Herrmann: Varsity Showcase Football Analyst\n\nBen Holden: CCHA Play-by-Play\n\nDean Jackson: Varsity Showcase Play-by-Play, plus fill-in\n\nRick Mahorn: College Basketball Analyst\n\nTom Markowski: Prep Ticket Host\n\nRuss McNamara: Volleyball Play-by-Play\n\nRob Otto: College Football Analyst, College Wrestling Analyst\n\nAl Pawlowski: Soccer Play-by-Play\n\nLyle Phair: CCHA Analyst\n\nArt Regner: CCHA Tonite Host\n\nSean Ritchlin: CCHA Analyst\n\nMatt Shepard: WNBA Play-by-Play\n\nTim Twentyman: Prep Ticket Host\n\nDerrick Walker: High School Football Analyst\n\nDave Zoran: College Football/Basketball/Soccer Play-by-Play, High School Sports Play-by-Play\n\nReferences[edit]"
