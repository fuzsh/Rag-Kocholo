Parties will be contacted only if their submissions raise procedural questions.\n\nWritten interventions should be submitted to the Secretary General of the Commission in only one of the following formats:\n\nby using the\n\n[Broadcasting interventions/comments form]\n\nor\n\nby mail to\n\nCRTC, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0N2\n\nor\n\nby fax at\n\n819-994-0218\n\nA true copy must be sent to the applicant, and proof that this has been done must accompany the intervention sent to the Commission.\n\nThe Commission advises those who file and serve by electronic mode to exercise caution when using e-mail for service of documents or notification, as it may be difficult to establish that service has occurred.\n\nParties must ensure that, before initiating service through electronic mode, they will be able to satisfy the Commission, upon request, that service of the notification was completed.\n\nSubmissions longer than five pages should include a summary.\n\nEach paragraph of the submission should be numbered. In addition, where the intervention is filed by electronic means, the line ***End of document*** should be entered following the last paragraph of the document, as an indication that the document has not been damaged during electronic transmission.\n\nInterventions should clearly identify the application referred to and indicate whether parties support or oppose the application, or, if they propose changes to it, include the facts and grounds for their proposal.\n\nIn the event that the application is brought to the oral phase of the hearing, and if parties wish to appear, they must provide reasons why their written interventions are not sufficient and why an appearance is necessary.\n\nPersons requiring communications support such as assistance listening devices and sign language interpretation are requested to inform the Commission at least twenty (20) days before the commencement of the public hearing so that the necessary arrangements can be made.\n\nImportant notice\n\nAll information that parties provide as part of this public process, except information granted confidentiality, whether sent by postal mail, facsimile, e-mail or through the Commission's website at www.crtc.gc.ca, becomes part of a publicly accessible file and will be posted on the Commission's website. This information includes personal information, such as full names, e-mail addresses, postal/street addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers, and any other personal information parties provide.\n\nThe personal information that parties provide will be used and may be disclosed for the purpose for which the information was obtained or compiled by the Commission, or for a use consistent with that purpose.\n\nDocuments received electronically or otherwise will be put on the Commission's website in their entirety exactly as received, including any personal information contained therein, in the official language and format in which they are received. Documents not received electronically will be available in PDF format.\n\nThe information that parties provide to the Commission as part of this public process is entered into an unsearchable database dedicated to this specific public process. This database is accessible only from the web page of this particular public process. As a result, a general search of the Commission's website with the help of either its own search engine or a third-party search engine will not provide access to the information that was provided as part of this public process.\n\nThe Commission encourages interested parties to monitor the public examination file and the Commission's website for additional information that they may find useful when preparing their interventions.\n\nExamination of documents\n\nAn electronic version of the applications is available from the Commission's website by selecting the application number within this notice.\n\nA list of all interventions will also be available on the Commission's website.
