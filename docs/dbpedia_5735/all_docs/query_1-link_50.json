        "text": "The City of Buffalo plans to build a palace of a new fire station in South Buffalo, judging from its price tag.\n\nOver the last several years, the city has approved borrowing about $9 million to replace Station No. 6 at the corner of Seneca Street and Southside Parkway. The station houses two trucks, Engine 25 and Ladder 10, and the department’s 6th Battalion.\n\nThe 62-year-old building definitely needs replacing. It’s a wreck.\n\nBut $9 million (“… and counting,” says a City Hall source) is more than double the cost of the last new fire station the city built in 2010, in the Kensington-Bailey neighborhood.\n\nIt’s also more than double the estimate Cannon Design gave the city for replacing that station six years ago, according to court documents filed in a lawsuit generated by the project.\n\nThat’s right: The project has already generated a lawsuit.\n\nIn 2014, before the city contemplated building a new station, it decided to put a new roof on the existing building. The lowest responsible bidder was Weaver Metal & Roofing, an East Side company, which gave a price of $514,900 for the job.\n\nThe project stalled for a while, but finally the contract was signed in April 2016.\n\nTwo months later, the city tried to cancel the contract.\n\nBased on consultations with Cannon Design, the city decided replacing the building was better than putting a new roof on it. The structure was compromised, Cannon concluded. Roof replacement wouldn’t work.\n\nHowever, Weaver already had committed time and money to the project. They had a signed contract. And, according to the company’s lawyers, that contract did not permit the city to simply change its mind.\n\nThe company sued the city in June 2018, seeking to be made whole.\n\nLast month, the Common Council signed off on a settlement. The city agreed to pay Weaver Metal & Roofing $112,500 for its trouble.\n\nFor roof that will never be built on a structure slated for replacement.\n\nAdd it to the bill.\n\n– Geoff Kelly\n\nWednesday, Feb. 16, 2022\n\nHeaney on Hochul: “I’m not impressed\n\nTuesday, Feb. 15, 2022\n\nOTB reform bills pass first test\n\nAmid pushback from some county law legisislatures, a series of bills aimed at restructuring operations of the Western Regional Off-Track Betting Corp. have cleared their first legislative hurdle.\n\nThe the three bills, sponsored by Buffalo Democratic Sen. Tim Kennedy, moved through the state senate’s Committee on Racing, Gaming and Wager on Monday.\n\nKennedy introduced the bills last month in a bid to end what he described as “perverse dysfunction” within WROTB. His proposed legislation calls for a restructuring of OTB’s board based on population. It would also limit the take-home use of OTB vehicles by select agency employees and put a $15 cap on the value of items, including tickets to sporting events and concerts, that could be accepted by OTB board members.\n\n“Taxpayers are tired of the dysfunction that continues to plague the Western Regional OTB,” Kennedy said in a release issued by his office following Monday’s committee meeting.\n\n“These bills were drafted in order to finally bring accountability and structure to a state corporation that has time and again demonstrated mismanagement and misuse of resources. By codifying these expectations and policies into law, we’re making it clear: corruption will be met with consequences.”\n\nKennedy introduced his reform package in response to an audit by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli that identified several issues within OTB’s operations, including improper use of tickets to luxury suites at sporting and music events at Highmark Stadium and Keybank Center.\n\nEarlier this month, OTB board members directed agency President Henry Wojtaszek to explore options for challenging the bills. Wojtaszek cited litigation as one possible option.\n\nOn Friday, Genesee County lawmakers approved a resolution calling on the Senate to oppose Kennedy’s legislation. The resolution suggests the proposed reforms would cause “irreparable harm to Genesee County, its interests in WROTB, the economic interests of Genesee County, and the taxpayers of (Genesee County).” The Wyoming County Board of Supervisors previously adopted a similar resolution.\n\n“This bill would take away the equalization of all the counties and we are in opposition to this bill,” Supervisor Susan May of Orangeville told the Daily News in Batavia.\n\n– Mark Scheer\n\nMonday, Feb. 14, 2022\n\nGiambra tests run for State Senate\n\nIt looks like Joel Giambra, the former Erie County executive, is once again kicking the tires on a run for elected office.\n\nThis time the Democrat-turned-Republican seems to have his eyes on the 60th District State Senate seat, currently occupied by Democrat Sean Ryan.\n\nLast week a poll began popping up on the cell phones of likely voters in the district, one of whom shared the link with Investigative Post.\n\nThe poll begins with a handful of questions meant to determine where on the political spectrum the respondent resides: Is New York State headed in the right or wrong direction? How do you feel about Joe Biden? Kathy Hochul? Mark Poloncarz?\n\nThen the poll gets specific: What do you think of Joel Giambra? How about Sean Ryan? Which one would you vote for if an election were held today? What’s your opinion of Assemblyman Jon Rivera, a Ryan ally?\n\nFinally, the poll gets topical: Should the state’s bail reform measures, championed by Democrats in the State Legislature, be reversed? Should the state end mask mandates for kids in schools? Are you concerned about “the rise of New York City dominated socialism in the State Legislature?”\n\nSince leaving the county executive’s office 15 years ago, Giambra has made a living as a lobbyist and an investor in West Side real estate. He’s kept his hand in politics, too, and put himself forward as a candidate for office several times.\n\nFor example, in 2018 he said he was running for governor, but ultimately withdrew from the Republican primary and failed to win third party support.\n\nIn 2020, he suggested he’d run for the Assembly seat Ryan left when elected to the Senate that year. He called off that campaign due to illness, and Jon Rivera won the seat.\n\nLast year, he told the Buffalo News he was interested in running for governor again.\n\nNow his attention seems to have shifted to the State Senate.\n\nGiambra, 65, hasn’t filed a campaign finance disclosure statement since January 2021, when he reported having about $70,000 in the bank left over from his career as an elected official. Before his two terms as county executive, Giambra served 10 years as Buffalo city comptroller and eight years as Niagara District Common Council member. Ryan has about $235,000 in campaign funds.\n\nTwo long-time participants in Western New York politics, who requested anonymity, characterized Giambra’s recent candidacies as marketing: Getting his name in the press, they told Investigative Post, helped Giambra to impress potential clients.\n\nA third was more succinct, describing Giambra’s motivation in one word:\n\n“Relevance.”\n\nAfter this story published, Giambra texted a statement to Investigative Post:\n\n“I was ready to ask the voters if they would want me to represent them in the Buffalo Assembly seat last cycle,” he wrote, noting he dropped out in order to get a kidney transplant. “My interest in returning to government has not diminished. Chances are very good that I will be asking voters to consider my candidacy for some state office.”\n\n– Geoff Kelly\n\nFriday, Feb. 11, 2022\n\nHochul donors hiding behind LLCs\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul was New York’s most successful political fundraiser last year, according to campaign finance disclosures filed last month with the state elections board. Her campaign committee raked in $21.6 million in just five months.\n\nBut Hochul’s campaign “flouted the law,” according to an analysis by New York Focus, by failing to identify the owners of 130 limited liability companies, or LLCs, that gave money to her committee.\n\nSince 2019, candidates running for office have been required to identify the owners of LLCs that donate to their campaigns. An LLC’s donation is divided among the owners; each owner’s share counts against the cap on how much an individual can give a candidate. (In the governor’s race this year, the cap is $69,700.) The law’s intent is to close a loophole which saw wealthy donors using the anonymity of LLCs to skirt those donation limits.\n\nLast year, 170 LLCs donated to Hochul, according to the New York Focus analysis, which was aided by the Public Accountability Initiative, a Buffalo-based public interest research organization, and co-published with The City.\n\nFewer than a quarter of those donations identified the LLC’s owners, effectively rendering the donors anonymous.\n\n“We don’t know who is funding Governor Hochul, despite her pledges of transparency,” PAI’s Robert Galbraith told New York Focus. Hochul said last August her administration would open a “new era of transparency” in Albany.\n\nThe report identified a number of other state elected officials who also failed to list owners of the LLCs that support them, including Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt of Niagara County.\n\nOn Twitter, Galbraith noted that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown is a repeat offender, too, as Investigative Post has reported more than once:\n\nThe LLC violations and other apparent illegalities in Brown’s filings were the subject of a formal complaint filed Aug. 20 with the state elections board by Peter Rizzo, who analyzed Brown’s campaign finances for Brown’s challenger, India Walton.\n\nThe elections board’s enforcement division acknowledged receiving his complaint, Rizzo told Investigative Post, but he hasn’t heard from them since.\n\n– Geoff Kelly\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\n\nThursday, Feb. 10, 2022\n\nAmazon subsidies: $4.7 billion and counting\n\nAmazon is the world’s largest online retailer and, at a current value of $1.6 billion, one of the wealthiest companies of any kind on the planet.\n\nA report released Wednesday by the subsidy watchdog group, Good Jobs First, suggests the retail giant is also in an elite category when it comes to cashing in on taxpayer-funded benefits.\n\nThe report, titled “Amazon.com’s Hidden Worldwide Subsidies,” found the company has received $4.7 billion in public subsidies over the past decade to help drive the expansion of its global network of warehouses, distribution centers, office complexes and call centers.\n\nAccording to the report, the bulk of the subsidies – about $4.1 billion – supported Amazon projects in the United States, where the company has 110 fulfillment centers.\n\nAmazon has two distribution facilities in Western New York, one in Tonawanda and another in Lancaster. It is reportedly in talks to build a third location, with an estimated value of $49 million, at the Lake Erie Commerce Center in Hamburg.\n\nOutside the United States, the report determined that Amazon has received at least $600 million in public assistance in more than a dozen countries. Due to “poor disclosure practices in most countries,” the report concludes that the true value of the subsidies is “hidden” and likely much higher.\n\nThe authors of the report, which was generated with help from the UNI Global Union, a pro-labor federation representing 20 million service workers worldwide, call for an end to government subsidies for Amazon. Failing that, the authors suggest greater transparency is needed for projects involving Amazon and its affiliates.\n\n“There’s no reason for national, regional, state or local governments to help offset Amazon’s costs for operations that are core to its strategy,” said Kenneth Thomas, a research fellow at Good Jobs First. “They should stop providing subsidies to Amazon, and instead use the money to invest in small businesses and public services.”\n\n– Mark Scheer\n\nWednesday, Feb. 9, 2022\n\nSchool attendance continues to slide\n\nA return to classroom instruction has not improved attendance in Buffalo schools. In fact, it’s gotten worse.\n\nAn analysis by Layne Dowdall found that nearly four in ten students have missed at least one day of class a week this school year. Fewer than two in 10 have satisfactory attendance rates. Both those numbers are appreciably worse than the 2020-21 school year when instruction was remote.\n\nDistrict officials say COVID – and the fear of getting infected – is a major reason for the problem. The district has responded by adding attendance teachers, among other steps, but some parent leaders say schools should be doing more.\n\nTeachers, meanwhile, note that the pandemic has exacerbated a long-standing attendance problem, rooted in part in an unwillingness of some high school students to show up for school.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTuesday, Feb. 8, 2022\n\nNFL stadium rush is on\n\nMonday, Feb. 7, 2022\n\nThe latest news on The Buffalo News\n\nHere’s the latest on the tussle over the ownership of the chain that owns The Buffalo News:\n\nTo recap, Alden Global Capital made a bid late last year to purchase Lee Enterprises, whose newspaper holdings include The News. Lee has resisted in a series of maneuvers and the back-and-forth between the companies has gotten quite nasty.\n\nThe latest salvo came last week in the release of the chain’s quarterly financial report in which it described its media holdings as “the fastest growing digital subscription platform in local media.” Net profits were $13.2 million. All is good, according to Lee.\n\nAlden had a different take, declaring the numbers “disappointing” and Lee’s integration of newspapers it bought from Warren Buffett in March 2020 as “inept.” Those papers include The News.\n\nInvestigative Post turned to two independent industry analysts, neither of which are fans of Alden, for their take.\n\nKen Doctor, who heads his own digital news operation in Santa Cruz, CA, wasn’t impressed with Lee’s spin.\n\nIn an email, he told us: “The continuing overall circulation revenue loss is most telling. They are buying lots of digital starts, but the loss in circulation revenue tells, combined with declines in revenue overall, says they are not ‘transitioning’ well after 15 years of transition.”\n\nRick Edmonds, media analyst at the Poynter Institute, wrote a column on the Lee report that said the numbers “suggest that that 59% year-to-year growth in digital-only subscriptions appears to have been achieved only with deep discounting.”\n\nWe asked Edmonds if he thought Alden would eventually prevail in its efforts to acquire Lee.\n\nHis response: “I can’t really predict. Of course they could up their offer, but they may well be too cheap for that. They have tried some of these takeover moves and ended up walking away. By the same token, they are often patient and persistent. Should keep us both watching for a while.”\n\n– Jim Heaney\n\nFriday, Feb. 4, 2022\n\nState paid $1B in OT last year\n\nIt cost New York taxpayers nearly a billion dollars to cover the overtime for state employees last year.\n\nThat’s part of the findings from a review of state salary data posted Thursday to seethroughny.net, a government transparency website operated by the Albany-based think tank, the Empire Center for Public Policy.\n\nIn its analysis of the 2021 state government payroll, the Empire Center determined state agencies paid $953.6 million in overtime during the calendar year. That’s $100 million, or about 12 percent, higher than in 2020.\n\nAccording to the Empire Center, 228 state employees were paid $100,000 or more in overtime in 2021. A total of 1,443 state employees, including 1,412 executive branch workers, were paid more than the governor’s salary of $225,000 last year.\n\nOverall salaries for state employees rose 6.1 percent, from $64,124 to $68,292.\n\nThe data examined by the Empire Center included 2021 base pay rates and total pay for more than 289,000 employees who worked in the state’s executive, legislative and judicial branches.\n\nNinety-eight of the state’s 100 top earners worked at the State University of New York (SUNY) or City University of New York (CUNY).\n\nThe highest-paid state employee was Dr. Robert Corona Jr., the CEO of SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, who received $823,933.\n\nTwo University at Buffalo coaches ranked among the 100 highest paid SUNY employees, James Whitesell (basketball, $441,618) and Lance Leipold (​​football, $419,632.) Liepold has since left UB and is coaching at Kansas University at triple the salary.\n\n– Mark Scheer\n\nThursday, Feb. 3, 2022\n\nStadium benefits campaign goes public\n\nA coalition that wants a community benefits agreement attached to public subsidies for a new Buffalo Bills stadium has taken their campaign public, after months of quiet organizing.\n\nThe coalition held a press conference Tuesday morning at Johnnie B. Wiley stadium on the city’s East Side — the old Rockpile, the original home of the Bills. The speakers included community activist Karima Amin, Tanvier Peart and Miles Gresham of Partnership for the Public Good, Bridge Rauch of Buffalo Transit Riders United, and Dr. Myron Glick, the founder and CEO of Jericho Road Community Health Center.\n\nThe coalition wants a legally binding agreement governing hiring and contracting during construction and for stadium operations once the facility is up and running. They want the public dollars at work — perhaps as much as $1 billion — to stay local, to benefit individuals and firms from economically disadvantaged parts of the city and county, and to favor minority- and women-owned businesses, all at levels higher than currently prescribed by state law.\n\nAt the press conference, PPG’s Gresham noted that Erie County Legislature Chair April Baskin is a CBA proponent, as Investigative Post reported in one of three stories on the issue published last week. Baskin’s CBA plan includes the Bills committing up to $100 million to fund community health, affordable housing, recreational and educational programs — all things professional sports teams have agreed to do in many other communities.\n\n“[A] rotating loan fund for first-time homebuyers … expanded public transportation … expanded facilities for schools … building new affordable housing. All are within the realm of possibility and should be what we’re asking for, not just the state minimum,” Gresham said.\n\nIn addition to reporting on Baskin’s plan, Investigative Post looked at comparable CBAs around the country and the mixed record of previous CBA campaigns in Western New York.\n\nAnother proponent of a Bills stadium CBA is State Senator Sean Ryan, whose district includes Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park. The Bills intend a new stadium to be built adjacent to the current facility.\n\n“We would like to see that stadium built with all union labor,” Ryan told Investigative Post last Friday. “But we also want to make sure that all the jobs that occur inside the stadium are high-wage jobs … people cleaning the stadium, security, parking cars … we want to make sure that workforce also comes from the city of Buffalo, and it’s also paid a living wage, and has a chance to unionize if that’s what the workers want.”\n\n– Geoff Kelly\n\nDonate to support our nonprofit newsroom\n\nWednesday, Feb. 2, 2022\n\nIntel lured by $2 billion subsidy\n\nThe microchip subsidy game is getting more and more costly for taxpayers.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported this week that it cost the state of Ohio more than $2 billion worth of incentives to convince tech-giant Intel Corp. to invest $20 billion in the construction of two chip-making plants just outside of Columbus.\n\nThe subsidy package for what’s been described as the largest single private-sector company investment in Ohio history reportedly involves $1.2 billion in cash incentives, including a direct cash grant to the company valued at $600 million. Economic development officials in Ohio described the $600 million as an “onshoring grant” that would be used to help offset Intel’s construction costs, which officials suggested would be 20 percent to 30 percent higher in the United States than Asia.\n\nIn addition, Ohio has reportedly agreed to cover $691 million in infrastructure costs for the project and provide Intel with $650 million in job-creation tax credits over a 30-year period.\n\nLocal property tax abatements and $150 million in economic development and workforce grants from JobsOhio, the state’s development agency, will push the incentive package over the $2 billion mark.\n\nIntel’s new Ohio plants will be built on 1,000 acres in New Albany, 15 miles northeast of Columbus. The factories are expected to create about 7,000 construction jobs and employ 3,000 workers when they open in 2025. Intel officials have said the project would be part of a larger $100 billion investment aimed at creating the largest chip-making complex in the world.\n\nInvestigative Post first reported in January that another tech giant, Samsung, turned down a subsidy offer worth $1.9 billion to locate a plant in Genesee County. The company instead opted to build a chip manufacturing facility in Taylor, Texas, just outside Austin.\n\nThat deal, had it been accepted, would have been the second largest incentive package in New York history and among the largest in the country. It was pitched as part of an ongoing effort to bring a large commercial tenant to the Science, Technology and Advanced Manufacturing Park, a 1,250-acre industrial site located in the Town of Alabama.\n\n– Mark Scheer\n\nTuesday, Feb. 1, 2022\n\nOTB striking back: Officials to fight reform effort\n\nOfficials from the Western Regional Off Track Betting Corp. plan to fight one state senator’s efforts to reform their operation.\n\nFollowing OTB’s monthly meeting on Jan. 21, agency President Henry Wojtaszek told the Daily News in Batavia that he was directed by the agency’s board to explore options for challenging three pieces of legislation introduced by state Sen. Tim Kennedy.\n\nWotjaszek hinted that one option could be litigation.\n\nAnother could involve encouraging local lawmakers representing Western New York communities served by OTB to approve resolutions opposing Kennedy’s reforms.\n\n“You heard today that the board certainly doesn’t support a measure to dismantle the board that has done such a great job to bring Batavia Downs to where it is right now, where it is returning record amounts of money to the municipalities,” Wojtaszek said.\n\nOn Jan. 13, Kennedy unveiled legislation that would alter OTB’s board structure based on population and prohibit the take-home use of OTB vehicles by select agency employees. In addition, the legislation calls for a $15 cap on the value of items, including sports and concert tickets, that board members are permitted to accept.\n\nKennedy introduced the legislation in response to an audit by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli that identified several issues within OTB’s operations, including improper use of tickets to luxury suites at sporting and music events at Highmark Stadium and Keybank Center.\n\nWojtaszek has previously said that OTB has already taken steps to address concerns raised by the comptroller’s audit. He and other OTB board members bristled at Kennedy’s suggestion that additional reforms were needed.\n\nWojtaszek told the Daily News that the perks covered under Kennedy’s proposed legislation were addressed by the corporation three years ago and said that his proposed cap on promotional items was not needed because OTB already had a “limit relative to gifts.”\n\nThe Daily News also reported that Genesee County’s OTB representative, Richard Seibert, planned to present lawmakers in his county with a resolution that would assert the county’s home rule in an effort to oppose Kennedy’s reforms. He suggested there are plans to distribute similar pieces of legislation for consideration in other counties within Western OTB’s jurisdiction, while calling Kennedy’s plan a “power grab for the bigger counties.”\n\n“It’s a complete takeover by some powerful people,” Siebert said.\n\nOTB did not respond to requests for comment from Investigative Post.\n\nA spokesperson for Kennedy’s office said the senator declined comment.\n\n– Mark Scheer\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\n\nMonday, Jan. 31, 2022\n\nCouncilmen violating campaign finance law\n\nThree of Buffalo’s Common Council members are behind on filing campaign finance disclosure statements, the latest of which was due Jan. 18.\n\nOr, rather, they were behind.\n\nWhen Investigative Post started asking about their missing filings last week, at least two of them began trying to catch up.\n\nWhen we checked the state election board’s online records shortly after the Jan. 18 deadline, we found two city legislators — Rasheed Wyatt and Ulysees Wingo — hadn’t filed since 2019. That was the last year Buffalo Council members were on the ballot. A third, David Rivera, hadn’t filed since July 2020.\n\nSince we began asking questions, Rivera has caught up. Wyatt has started to catch up. Wingo, a spokesman for the state elections board told Investigative Post, has not done so yet.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n– Geoff Kelly\n\nFriday, Jan. 28, 2022\n\nCBA proponents here seeking first win\n\nCommunity groups in Western New York twice have tried to attach community benefits agreements, or CBAs, to taxpayer-funded development projects. The first local CBA campaign was for Canalside in 2009, the next a few years later for an expansion of the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.\n\nBoth campaigns failed to win legally binding agreements, though there were some silver linings.\n\nA similar coalition hopes the third try will be the charm, as it seeks a CBA for a new Buffalo Bills stadium, which is expected to receive substantial public subsidies.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThursday, Jan. 27, 2022\n\nLinking community benefits to a new Bills stadium\n\nYesterday we reported how other cities have used community benefits agreements, or CBAs, to get the best value for their money from professional sports venues built with the help of taxpayer dollars.\n\nToday, Geoff Kelly looks at a CBA proposal championed by Erie County Legislature Chair April Baskin, enumerating conditions she and others want attached to any public subsidies for a new Buffalo Bills stadium.\n\nBaskin wants benchmarks for hiring and contracting that favor local workers and firms, support women- and minority-owned businesses, and ensure good-paying jobs during and after construction. Her proposal also asks the Bills to commit $100 million to fund programs that benefit Erie County’s urban and rural poor.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWednesday, Jan. 26, 2022\n\nHow a stadium can benefit the community\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Clippers wanted a new basketball arena, the team committed to a community benefits agreement, or CBA, earmarking $100 million for affordable housing, college scholarships and other programs to help out the host community.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons ponied up $40 million for parks and a job training center, among other civic-minded investments, to help justify public subsidies for a new football stadium. The Pittsburgh Penguins paid for a new grocery story in a neighborhood that had been without one for decades.\n\nHere in Western New York, community groups and elected officials are looking at these and other CBAs as models for what Erie County and New York State might demand from the Buffalo Bills before forking over public dollars to build the team a new, $1.4 billion stadium.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTuesday, Jan. 25, 2022\n\nThe Pegulas should pay up\n\nLet’s face it, taxpayers are going to have to shell out to help pay for a new stadium for the Buffalo Bills. The question is how much.\n\nJim Heaney, in his Outrages & Insights column, argues that most of the burden should fall on the team’s billionaire owners, Terry and Kim Pegula. Drawing in part on research by Forbes magazine, Heaney details just how rich the Pegulas are, the growing value of the team since they bought the Bills, and how uber-profitable NFL teams are.\n\nHeaney’s column also draws on reporting done by Mark Scheer for Investigative Post, noting that the Bills are believed to be seeking subsidies that could dwarf those doled out to other NFL teams while benefiting from a one-sided lease on their current stadium that enables the team to keep almost all revenues while saddling taxpayers with most expenses, right down to those cost of paying ushers, ticket takers and security personnel.\n\nYou can read the column here.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\n\nMonday, Jan. 24, 2022\n\nAnother high-tech miss for Genesee County\n\nAnother tech giant with big microchip expansion plans is bypassing New York, this time for Ohio.\n\nIntel Corp. announced on Friday plans to invest at least $20 billion to develop amicrochip manufacturing complex in Jersey Township, outside of Columbus. Company officials said the plant will employ 3,000. Construction is expected to begin later this year, with production expected by the end of 2025.\n\nIntel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger said the project is part of the company’s plans to invest $100 billion to build up to eight microchip factories on the Ohio campus by 2030.\n\nThe project is being billed as the largest economic development project in Ohio history and one of the largest microchip manufacturing investments ever in the United States.\n\nSo far, there’s no word on local or state subsidies. However, Gelsinger and other Intel officials have been advocating for approval of the CHIPS Act, a federal bill that would pump $52 billion into domestic microchip manufacturing.\n\nBefore choosing Ohio, Intel officials reportedly considered sites in New York state, including the Science, Technology and Advanced Manufacturing Park in rural Genesee County.\n\nWhile local, state and federal officials have touted the largely undeveloped 1,250-acre site in the Town of Alabama as a future landing spot for various big tech companies, to date, there is just one tenant – a hydrogen fuel company called Plug Power. The subsidy package for that project amounted to $4 million per job.\n\nLast year, the Genesee County Economic Development Center and the Empire State Development Corp. came up short in a bid to lure another microchip giant – Samsung – to STAMP, despite offering an incentive package worth nearly $2 billion.\n\nSamsung accepted a smaller subsidy package worth just over $1 billion from the state of Texas, where it will build a microchip plant in the City of Taylor, outside Austin.\n\nGenesee County economic development officials have so far spent more than $30 million to develop STAMP, which remains mostly fields. A letter from the Empire State Development Corp. offering an incentive package worth $1.9 billion to Samsung indicated that another $200 million in infrastructure improvements would be needed.\n\n– Mark Scheer\n\nFriday, Jan. 21, 2022\n\nEye-catching public pensions\n\nWorking for a public school system in New York State tends to pay well.\n\nSo does being retired from one.\n\nTeachers and administrators who retired last year left with an average pension of $73,552 annually. That was up about $2,500 from the previous year.\n\nThe figures reflect teachers and administrators who put in at least 30 years and worked outside of New York City.\n\nRetirees from Western New York averaged $63,060. That placed WNY in the middle of the pack of nine regions around the state. Tops was Long Island, with an average pension of $94,108 per year.\n\nPensions for educators\n\nRegion Retirees Pension Long Island 713 $94,108 Mid-Hudson 520 $83,668 Capital 271 $63,592 Western New York 272 $63,060 Finger Lakes 263 $61,754 Mohawk Valley 118 $57,785 Central New York 224 $56,670 Southern Tier 196 $55,148 North Country 108 $54,946 Total 2,685 $73,553\n\nSource: The Empire Center for Public Policy.\n\nMore than 10 percent of new retirees are drawing six-figure pensions, led by the $271,275 paid to former Locust Valley School Superintendent Anna Hunderfund. The biggest pension paid among new retirees from WNY was $103,280 annually.\n\nThe pension payouts are according to a new report from the Empire Center for Public Policy.\n\n– Layne Dowdall\n\nThursday, Jan. 20, 2022\n\nA lack of urgency on Bills stadium\n\nThere’s been talk lately from the Buffalo Bills and government officials that time is running out to decide on a new stadium for the team.\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, that a committee was put together at Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s behest to consider stadium options – eight years ago.\n\nIt only met once. Eight years ago.\n\nThe group wasn’t lacking in clout. Notable New Stadium Working Group members included U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz, LP Ciminelli Chairman Louis Ciminelli, Lt. Gov. Robert Duffy, Empire State Development Corp. President Kenneth Adams and Kathy Hochul, the current governor, who was a vice president of M and T Bank at the time. The committee included several Bills officials, including President and CEO Russ Brandon and Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Littmann.\n\nAlong with political juice, the working group had resources.\n\nThe stadium’s 2013 lease allocated more than $2 million in funding to the committee by 2018 and a total of $11.7 million by 2023, the final year of the agreement.\n\nDuring the group’s initial meeting on April 1, 2014 – yes, April Fool’s day – members were briefed on the stadium lease and plans for $130 million in planned renovations to the existing facility.\n\nFollowing the meeting, then Brandon, the Bills president at the time, said eight years was not a long time to secure the franchise’s long-term future in Western New York.\n\n“That’s the reason we’re standing here today,” Brandon said. “This will be a long process. We have a lot of work that needs to be done. But I know our group is up for the task.”\n\nThe stadium group never met again, nor has it played any role in planning for what’s been reported as a new $1.4 billion stadium in Orchard Park.\n\nSo, why didn’t the group meet again?\n\nDuffy, Poloncarz and Brandon served as co-chairs.\n\nWe asked Duffy, lieutenant governor at the time, why the lack of action. He didn’t get back to us. We couldn’t get an explanation from Poloncarz’s office, either. Brandon is long gone from the Bills.\n\nPamm Lent, a spokesperson for Empire State Development, said responsibility for developing stadium plans shifted to the Bills after Ralph Wilson’s estate sold the team to the Pegulas.\n\nIndeed, the Pegulas have since taken the lead on stadium development, having commissioned their own study that examined potential stadium sites in Buffalo, Amherst and Orchard Park.\n\nThe Bills took their time hiring the consultants that produced the report. CAA ICON was retained in November 2018.That was four years after the working group met for its first and only time.\n\nThe Bills later shared that study with the state, but refused to release it to the press or public until Investigative Post sued for its release.\n\nThe state later commissioned its own study, released in November, well after stadium negotiations had started.\n\nAll this begs the question: If time was of the essence, why haven’t the Bills and politicians acted with a greater sense of urgency?\n\n– Mark Scheer\n\nSupport our nonprofit newsroom with a donation\n\nWednesday, Jan. 19, 2022\n\nEnck: Test for “forever chemicals”\n\nA former top EPA official is calling for the monitoring of members of Buffalo’s Burmese community because of their consumption of fish contaminated with so-called “forever chemicals.”\n\nJudith Enck is responding to an Investigative Post story published in September.\n\nThe story, ‘More Danger Lurking in the Water,” covered a state and federal study of fishermen who eat their local catches.\n\nAll of the fishermen tested had elevated levels of the toxin known as PFOS, one in a class of chemicals known as PFAS, but the highest were found in Burmese citizens, who make up one of Western New York’s largest immigrant communities. Their results were as much as 6.5 times higher than the national average.\n\nEnck, the EPA’s top administrator during the Obama years for the region that includes New York, told Investigative Post the findings in the story were “stunning” and “really disturbing.”\n\nPublic officials and other agencies should do more to make people aware of the risks, Enck said, which include a host of damaging health effects, including immunity and fertility issues, hypertension and cancer.\n\n“There needs to be signs all over that waterfront, and not just brochures that no one reads. I mean, those are really high levels,” she said.\n\n“They’re probably experiencing some health problems,” Enck said, adding she had made calls to local advocacy groups, like Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper. “They may not know why that is happening. They need medical monitoring, right away.”\n\nThe chemicals were used widely in industrial and household goods for decades, including firefighting foams and lubricants; and nonstick coatings, like teflon, food packaging and fabric protectors.\n\nJill Jedlicka, waterkeeper’s executive director, said the group is one of several in the state “sounding the alarm on the risks from PFAS for some time now.”\n\n“There is no known safe level of PFAS in drinking water. Waterkeeper will be advocating strongly for state and federal regulators to direct resources into WNY for dedicated testing and monitoring in our community, and wherever they are found, we will fight for both public transparency and the timely cleanup of these damaging contaminants.”\n\n– Phil Gambini\n\nTuesday, Jan. 18, 2022\n\nThe hidden cost of housing the Bills\n\nThere’s been a lot of chatter about how much money the public might have to fork over for a new stadium for the Buffalo Bills. Little attention has been paid to the other ways in which taxpayers would be on the hook. The costs are considerable.\n\nMark Scheer has done an in-depth analysis of the Bills’ current lease on Highmark Stadium, which is a starting point for ongoing negotiations. He found that, over the years, Erie County has surrendered all claims to stadium revenue, while county and state taxpayers took on expenses that come to about $13 million a year.\n\nDid you know, for example, that taxpayers are responsible for paying the wages of ushers and ticket takers? Ditto for security, including those in parking lots where the Bills keep all the revenue. The lease even provides the Bills money to spend on team operations as the Pegulas see fit.\n\nMark also reviewed leases at four other subsidized stadiums built in the past decade. He found ours lacking.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMonday, Jan. 17, 2022\n\nOrtt’s failing environmental report card\n\nFew in the state Legislature protect the environment as poorly as Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt, according to one leading ecological advocacy group.\n\nEnvironmental Advocates Action gave Ortt its 2021 “Oil Slick Award” for his voting record. The group, a lobbying and advocacy outfit, annually “honors” officials whose positions they deem most harmful.\n\nAccording to Peter Iwanowicz, executive director of Environmental Advocates NY, Ortt’s “extreme anti-environmental voting record should make him an outcast, not the Senate minority leader.”\n\nOrtt, R-North Tonawanda, refused an interview, but his spokesman, Andrew Dugan, told Investigative Post that the minority leader supports “sensible” policy positions. Environmental Advocates is a “left-wing special interest” group, Dugan contended.\n\nIwanowicz noted Ortt’s opposition to a proposed state constitutional amendment adding a right to “clean air and water, and a healthful environment,” which was approved by voters in November. According to a Siena College Research Institute poll published last year, the amendment was supported by 64 percent of Republicans.\n\n“Almost 2 million New Yorkers just voted overwhelmingly to add the right of clean air and water and a healthful environment to the state Constitution,” Iwanowicz said. “Senator Ortt tried to block that from happening. It’s clear from his record that Senator Ortt doesn’t share their values.”\n\nOrtt ranked low during last year’s evaluation too, receiving the worst grade of the 208 state legislators reviewed. His positions are not unique among Western New York GOP legislators, though. The local Republican caucus averaged a score of 41 out of 100 in 2020, compared to the statewide Republican average of 60.\n\nLook back at last year’s rankings, and listen to a conversation with Iwanowicz, here.\n\n– Phil Gambini\n\nFriday, Jan. 14, 2022\n\nCounty election boards fail transparency test\n\nWhen a good government group decided to test whether county election boards comply with the state’s open government laws, the first hurdle was getting someone – anyone – at those boards to answer an email or a phone call.\n\nIt wasn’t easy.\n\nLast summer the New York Coalition for Open Government — a group that tracks government agencies’ compliance with freedom of information and open meetings laws — emailed 17 county election boards across the state to ask how often commissioners held meetings, whether those meetings were publicized, and whether meeting agendas and meetings were posted online. In many cases they followed up with phone calls.\n\nEleven of the 17 boards — including those in Erie and Niagara counties — didn’t bother to reply.\n\nOf the six who did, only one reported that it publicized upcoming meetings and posted agendas online. The other five said their election commissioners met regularly, as required by law, but did not invite the public or publish meeting agendas and minutes.\n\nAn Oswego County election commissioner “seemed flabbergasted by the questions,” the coalition reported earlier this week.\n\n“[The commissioner] did not understand what the board would meet about, what actions they would take publicly or privately, or what minutes would be logged,” according to the coalition’s report.\n\nThe coalition followed up with a formal Freedom of Information Law request, adding two more counties, for a total of 19 election boards. Just five acknowledged the FOIL request in writing within five days, as required by law. Four more eventually responded, but after the five-day deadline.\n\n“Amazingly, 10 election boards just never acknowledged our FOIL request,” said Paul Wolf, a Western New York attorney who is the coalition’s founder and executive director.\n\nSo, the coalition sent a second FOIL request a month later. That one didn’t fare much better.\n\nIn the end, just 10 of the 19 boards — Erie County’s among them — provided the coalition with agendas and minutes of meetings. The Niagara County Board of Elections was never heard from.\n\n“A pretty pitiful success rate,” Wolf said, noting that one board only responded a week ago, almost six months after the fact. State law gives public agencies up to 20 business days to fulfill FOIL requests.\n\nAmong the report’s conclusions: The state should create a body that has the authority, the resources and the political independence to monitor and enforce transparency laws, leveling penalties when agencies persistently violate them.\n\n“Frankly, we’re getting tired of releasing report after report of noncompliance with the law,” Wolf said.\n\nRead the full report below:\n\n— Geoff Kelly\n\nTuesday, Jan. 11, 2022\n\nBuffalo schools failing the test\n\nSo what does a school district do when many of its underachieving students miss a year’s worth of instruction due to the pandemic?\n\nIf you’re Buffalo schools, you promote almost all of them to the next grade.\n\nIn doing so, the district pledged programming to help students catch up. But halfway through the school year, that effort is hamstrung, mostly by problems related to the pandemic.\n\nAs parent leader Sam Radford told us: “Our children who are already the furthest behind … they’re falling further behind.”\n\nSubscribe to our free weekly newsletters\n\nEmail*\n\nComments\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nΔ\n\nWednesday, Jan. 5, 2022\n\nNearly $2 billion wasn’t enough\n\nState and local officials, determined to win the competition for a semiconductor plant that will employ 1,800, offered Samsung $1.89 billion in subsidies to locate the factory in Genesee County, just north of Batavia.\n\nThe chief competition, two sites in and around Austin, Texas, dangled large subsidy packages, as well. But at $1 billion each, they fell way short of what New York was offering.\n\nNevertheless, Samsung opted for Taylor, Texas.\n\nWhy did the company bypass Genesee County?\n\nIt’s unclear, but the remote location could have been a factor. How remote? It was going to cost $200 million just to bring utilities to the site, located in an industrial park that is mostly fields.\n\nNew York’s subsidy package, if it has been accepted, would have been the second-largest in state history, double that of what Tesla received to build its plant in South Buffalo.\n\nSunday, Jan. 2, 2022\n\nTop iPost story of the year\n\nReaders voted Phil Gambini’s report on high levels of E. coli bacteria in local waterways at our top story of 2021. Blame it on the discharge of untreated sewage which is spewed into waterways after heavy rains..\n\nGambini reported:\n\nThere’s a particular problem with the Black Rock Canal, popular with fishermen, the occasional swimmer and, most notably, the West Side Rowing Club and high school and college crew teams. E. coli readings consistently exceed safe limits — by up to 14 times — established by the federal government.\n\n“There are people coming in contact with water with E. coli from human feces every single day,” Wendy Paterson of the Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper told Investigative Post.\n\nOther affected waterways included the Buffalo and Niagara rivers and Scajaquada, Ellicott and Eighteen Mile creeks.\n\nThursday, Dec. 30, 2021\n\nCity inspectors MIA\n\nThe Great Northern grain elevator on the Buffalo River has been crumbling in plain sight for 28 years. Fault the building’s owner, Archer Daniels Midland. But City Hall is also complicit.\n\nYes, the company is at fault for not maintaining the hulking structure, but it’s been aided and abetted by City Hall.\n\nThe city has inspected the building only one time since ADM purchased it in 1993. That dates all the way back to the administration of Anthony Masiello.\n\nThe city can’t say it wasn’t warned. ADM, seeking to make a case for demolition, alerted the city several times over the years to serious problems with the structure. The city’s response was to do nothing, not even inspect the gain elevators, save one time.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\n\nTuesday, Dec. 28, 2021\n\nTesla: Better late than never\n\nTesla has finally met its job goals at its billion dollar plant in South Buffalo.\n\nThe state had extended Tesla’s deadline twice. The third time was a charm, and in this case, a way of dodging a $41.2 million penalty.\n\nTesla had until the end of the year to meet the target of 1,460 jobs; employment as of early November stood at 1,557.\n\nLet’s hold off celebrating, however.\n\nA look at Tesla’s online job postings shows a lot of positions pay modest wages. And the plant, built with nearly $1 billion in state subsidies, has produced little spin-off development, aside from the Tim Horton’s across the street.\n\nThursday, Dec. 23, 2021\n\nSued into doing the right thing\n\nYou may have read or watched stories in the daily newspaper or local television stations about the details of studies involving the proposed construction of a new stadium for The Buffalo Bills. You can thank Investigative Post.\n\nThe state released the studies after we sued Empire State Development, the state’s primary economic development agency, after it rejected our requests for copies under the Freedom of Information Law. Only when we filed the lawsuit did the state relent.\n\nSaid Michael Higgins, one of our attorneys: ““These documents were always public records and Empire State Development withheld them, gambling that no one would expend the time and money it takes to file a lawsuit to force their release. They lost that gamble.”"
