        "text": "HAUNTED HOUSE HOTLINE\n\nA free public service from the\n\nZIOPTIS FOUNDATION in Detroit, The Haunted House Birthplace of the USA.*\n\nWELCOME TO THE ZIOPTIS FOUNDATION HAUNTED HOUSE HOTLINE, your insider fast track to the HOTTEST HAUNTED ATTRACTIONS in Michigan and the whole nation! We attend as many haunts as possible each year, and post reviews that are archived for future reference.\n\nOur mission is to give you an authentic feel of what each haunt is like, but without giving away too much. It's a challenge we're up to, because we don't want to spoil the experience for you!\n\nDon't think of us as judges, but as storytellers. Every haunt has a story, and we'll bring it to life right here. It's almost like going to a haunted house without going to a haunted house!\n\nYou'll also find info on off-season haunt events as well as alternative entertainment, so stay tuned. Stuff like fireworks displays in the winter, free concerts, and where to see amazing automated Christmas light displays.\n\nWE ARE INDEPENDENT AND NON-PROFIT. The website has large type and is dial-up friendly for maximum accessibility to all. Localities appear in red for easy identification. And the original, one and only FreeZIOPTIS DIAL-A-TRIP that started the ball rolling in 1986 is still available 24/7 at (313) 274-1111.\n\nHistory - in the mid-90's, we started adding stories at the end of the Dial-A-Trip episodes in October about the coolest haunted houses we went to. So much interest was generated that in 1998 the decision was made to start a separate service, and the ZIOPTIS HAUNTED HOUSE HOTLINE was born!\n\n* = To our knowledge, the very first haunted attraction in the USA was MUTILATION MANSION in Detroit suburb MADISON HEIGHTS, MICHIGAN which began in 1966. Disney’s Haunted Mansion debuted in 1969, and Knott’s Berry Farm haunt started in 1973. If anyone can provide evidence of an earlier haunt, please email us at ZioptisFoundation@gmail.com\n\nZIOPTIS PHOTOSTREAM: https://www.flickr.com/photos/45316911@N03/\n\nNO ADVERTISING! NO COOKIES! JUST THE GOODS._____________________________________________________________________\n\nMAY 1, 2024 WEDNESDAY 3 PM - THE BIG ULTIMATE NOTHING\n\nAll day long, things demand your attention. Listen to this, look at that, react to this, ignore that...blah blah blah...\n\nContinual stimuli eventually takes its’ toll and it’s time to jump into the Arms of Morpheus, the god of sleep.\n\nA dark, quiet room is what you need. You can turn off the lights, but what if you can’t turn off the noise?\n\nWhether it’s thin apartment walls or the neighbor’s kids garage band, some sounds can’t just be shut off. So what do you do?\n\nCOMING NEXT - BEING WRITTEN\n\nNow posted - the latest statistics list detailing 45,480 hits for the last period: http://www.zioptis.com/html/archive_33.shtml\n\nAPRIL 30, 2024 TUESDAY 5 PM - CIRQUE ITALIA FREEBIES FOR KIDS\n\nJust spotted this primo deal for world class entertainment sure to please the whole family. CIRQUE ITALIA will be at FAIRLANE TOWN CENTER in DEARBORN MAY 16 - 19. Adult tix are not free, but well worth the price. ONE FREE CHILD PER PAID ADULT in Levels 2 and 3, use PROMO CODE FACEFREE online.\n\nhttps://gold.cirqueitalia.com/events/1076_Water-Circus-Gold-Unit-Dearborn-MI\n\nHere’s some shots from their 2022 show: https://www.flickr.com/photos/45316911@N03/albums/72177720300900927/\n\nWe plan on taking this in, we went twice last time they were in town!\n\nAPRIL 30, 2024 TUESDAY 2 PM - BIG NUMBERS, BIG HEADACHES & MILLIONS OF LITTLE JOYS\n\nThe record breaking numbers are in for the DETROIT NFL DRAFT: 775,000 attendance and $165 million influx!\n\nTHE DEVIL IN THE DETAILS\n\nBut the whole thing almost came to a screeching stop, with only two hours to go until they opened the floodgates into Hart Plaza on opening day last Thursday.\n\nAnd if you have a haunt you’ll especially appreciate how the powers that be must have felt...\n\nAt the security headquarters, a large staff of workers was monitoring the vast system of VIDEO CAMERAS. Any problem could be pinpointed in real time, and the closest officer dispatched to deal with it.\n\nFLYING BLIND\n\nBut things went from HUNKY DORY to OH NO! in a flash, as every video cam in the network suddenly went dark. A worst case scenario.\n\nLET YOUR FINGERS DO THE WALKING\n\nMAYOR DUGGAN took quick action, calling the AT&T CEO and explaining the dilemma.\n\nQuicker than you can say “JACK ROBINSON” a crew was dispatched from AT&T Headquarters Downtown Detroit to Hart Plaza.\n\nLIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED\n\nThey began a system wide analysis, and quickly identified the problem. A different phone company was doing work in the area, and mistakenly cut the main FIBER OPTIC CABLE running the video network.\n\nThe splicing technicians had the system up and running in short order, allowing the original schedule to go on with the public unaware there was any difficulty.\n\nWhew! Let’s hear it for the original, real telephone company AT&T.\n\nAPRIL 28, 2024 SUNDAY 2 PM - DETROIT WOWS THE WORLD, AGAIN\n\nAbout a million people from all over the world came to Detroit for the much ballyhooed NFL DRAFT, and the reviews are overwhelmingly positive.\n\nIt was great to see MAYOR DUGGAN at the microphone, announcing a player THE DETROIT LIONS were selecting.\n\nMAYOR DUGGAN has done so many positive things for Detroit that he keeps getting reelected. I saw one report recently about blight reduction, showing the demolition of abandoned house #6,000 with still more to go.\n\nDowntown Detroit was shining brightly as over 275,000 filled the main area, breaking previous NFL records. An estimated $160 million was injected into the local economy.\n\nIn short, just like the MICHIGAN HAUNT SCENE the Detroit NFL DRAFT is a GIANT WINNER!\n\nAPRIL 27, 2024 SATURDAY 12 NOON - A BETTER MOUSE TRAP\n\n“Build a better mouse trap, and the world will beat a path to your door” is what smart guy Ralph Waldo Emerson said many moons ago.\n\nThat’s sort of what DETROIT MAYOR DUGGAN did with downtown Hart Plaza as a hub for the NFL DRAFT Thursday thru Saturday.\n\nDay One attendance record: over 275,000 NFL FANS show up at HART PLAZA! Entrance closed much sooner than anticipated.\n\nhttps://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/2024/04/27/detroit-shatters-all-time-nfl-draft-attendence-record/\n\nAPRIL 26, 2024 FRIDAY 1 PM - TAYLOR SWIFT & DETROIT BREAK WORLD RECORDS, AGAIN\n\nThe Guinness Book of World Records needs to be updated, because the world just can’t get enough of our Official Unofficially Adopted kid sister TAYLOR SWIFT and the incredible haunted attractions of DETROIT.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have arrived in Detroit because THE SCREAM MACHINE, DERANGED HAUNT, and AWAKEN are having off season events.\n\nOkay, maybe it’s actually something to do with football.\n\nYup. Sure is. Never mind.\n\nAPRIL 19, 2024 FRIDAY 2 PM - TAYLOR SWIFT DECLARED PRESIDENT AS ORANGE GUY IS KICKED TO THE CURB\n\nSome nut job just lit himself on fire outside the New York Court where what’s-his-name is on trial.\n\nBut nobody cares, because PRESIDENT SWIFT just dropped her new double album “THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT.” The SWIFTIE ARMY is celebrating their Commander In Chief’s return to the TOP OF THE BILLBOARD CHARTS. https://www.theringer.com/music/2024/4/19/24135012/taylor-swift-1830s-tortured-poets-department-new-album\n\nThis is where we want our beloved kid sister to be, in the limelight because of music and love.\n\nWe still aren’t buying her records. But we will defend her to the end like a bully big brother.\n\nAPRIL 18, 2024 THURSDAY 5 PM - PUNCH DRUNK MIKE TYSON REVEALS DARKEST AI SECRET\n\nMIKE TYSON? Isn’t he the guy who bit the ears off his opponent in a gory display never before seen in what many say is the most violent sport on the planet?\n\nHis brain has likely turned into jello, after thousands of blunt trauma impacts of high intensity on his frontal lobes. Sort of a full blown lobotomy, except without the hospital, doctors and such.\n\nWhat in the world does MIKE TYSON have to do wit AI, and why does it matter to the world of haunted attractions?\n\nIn short order, you’ll understand as MIKE TYSON explores the ghoulish possibilities that could arise when Artificial Intelligence surpasses human intelligence. Really? MIKE TYSON? Sorta. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntuzVdZGghk\n\nAPRIL 18, 2024 THURSDAY 4 PM - AI IDENTITY CRISIS SMACKS YOU IN THE FACE\n\nCOMING SOON!\n\nAPRIL 18, 2024 THURSDAY 3 PM - RABBIT JUMPS OUT OF THE HAT\n\nDid you know that Michigan is widely considered to be the MAGIC CAPITAL OF THE WORLD?\n\nCOLON, MICHIGAN is home to ABBOTT’S MAGIC COMPANY which is host to the annual MAGIC GET TOGETHER: https://magicgettogether.com/schedule.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott%27s_Get_Together https://abbottmagic.com/\n\nWe’re finally going to this for the first time this year, we can’t wait!\n\nAPRIL 7, 2024 SUNDAY 2 PM - SO NEAR AND SO FAR\n\nHaunt operators across the nation are busy designing new shows for next season. Some of this involves shuffling around of existing scenes and props, and some is brand new goodies from TRANSWORLD last month: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftuhoNZm5g\n\nAnd then there are haunts that design and make their own new gags.\n\nLet’s say you’re one of these ambitious haunts, and are designing original artwork to establish a certain spooky feeling for the new room. Perhaps it will be projected, made into giant wallpaper panels, or even 3D printed.\n\nMaybe you have STU SMITH on your speed dial. Or like the former owner of JACKSON’S UNDERWORLD, your son has become a wizard at SPOOKY 3D ARTWORK.\n\nBut if not, some of you will probably use AI art generators to create the EXQUISITE SCARY IMAGERY you have in your twisted mind. Having a twisted imagination is a must, but realization can be a challenge. Features like MAGIC PROMPT with IDEOGRAM can help, but you need your own prompts to get started.\n\nAI can be finicky, requiring many attempts until you’re satisfied.\n\nEven so, many times we’ve found that one last detail isn’t right. So it’s “back to the drawing board” and more time wasted. Until now, that is...\n\nDALL - E has added a new fine tuning feature sort of like the Content Aware Brush Healing function on Photoshop. You can fix a specific part of the image, leaving intact the good parts. AI WORKSHOP takes you through the process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxFSied7dnI\n\nMARCH 31, 2024 SUNDAY 1:30 AM - NEW HIT LIST POSTED\n\nThe latest hit list detailing 40,083 hits over the last period has been added to Archives 33: http://www.zioptis.com/html/archive_33.shtml\n\nMARCH 31, 2024 SUNDAY 1 AM - BUTTER CHICKEN & CHOCOLATE BUNNIES A GO-GO\n\nHappy Easter everyone! If you’re a Christian, today is THE SUPER BOWL of spiritual events and religious observances. Christ is risen and it’s time to celebrate the biggest gift ever!\n\nOf course holidays are also a time for culinary excellence at family dinners, but that means somebody has to do the dishes.\n\nYuck. Forget that.\n\nOr you could go the easy route, and visit a famous elegant dining room that sports THREE giant spectacular chandeliers and world class ethnic gourmet cuisine to die for.\n\nIt’s PUNJAB INDIAN CUISINE at 36071 Plymouth Rd. in Livonia: https://www.facebook.com/punjabcater/ They have a buffet with over 40 items, so come hungry! Event runs from 11 AM - 9 PM.\n\nWe went last year and it was exceptional. It’s $24.99 and a bargain considering the amazing variety of truly top notch gourmet cuisine prepared by people that barely speak English. It’s the real deal super authentic, and the BUTTER CHICKEN will melt in your mouth! Talkie: (248) 622-5489\n\nEven better than the convenience of letting top level chefs do the work, this is some of the healthiest food you can put in your body.\n\nTurmeric is a spice they use, and has been shown to have many positive effects on the brain. My partner feeds her dogs a food supplement containing turmeric and they eagerly devour it literally to the last drop!\n\nTo our knowledge, PUNJAB is the biggest Indian restaurant in Michigan! Many moons ago, JOEY’S COMEDY CLUB was in this building.\n\nWe’ve mentioned this before, but NO we still have no direct connection with this restaurant.\n\nMARCH 30, 2024 SATURDAY 3 PM - MOVIE INDUSTRY FIRED / HOLLYWOOD DECLARED OBSOLETE\n\nLet’s say you’re an aspiring film maker, toiling on a killer script for a HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. You met with a local film director for a casting session, and ended up rewriting her movie and then decided to write your own movies.\n\nYou bought FINAL DRAFT to have your script conform to Hollywood standards. Despite its high price, it keeps crashing and you lose countless hours of work. You end up buying FADE IN screenwriting open software instead, and it’s awesome. Better yet it’s way under the $200 you’ll shell out for FINAL DRAFT. https://www.fadeinpro.com/\n\nNow, how do you get your movie made?\n\nIf you have a high profile entertainment industry contact and have included her in the script, getting her excited about the movie should help.\n\nOn the other hand, hundreds if not thousands of others also have such connections and will never see their efforts land on the SILVER SCREEN.\n\nSo you could spend years trying to make it happen, and have nothing to show for your efforts.\n\nOr, you could just push one BIG RED BUTTON that’s been added to CLAUDE: https://claude.ai/chats https://claude.ai\n\nJust load in your entire HOLLYWOOD FORMAT SCRIPT, and CLAUDE will take care of everything! Scene creation, voice overs, music, the whole kit and kaboodle. So how good is it? We don’t know, yet!\n\nBut just the chance to do something like this is a game changer.\n\nSo who will be the first haunted attraction to make their own spooky movie using AI?\n\nA spooky movie was already made conventionally by the now defunct HAUNTED HILL ACRES in BELLEVILLE. It was an artistic success, but it never got the recognition it deserved as it flopped and bankrupted them. Despite the dismal result, we salute HAUNTED HILL ACRES for their bold efforts.\n\nWe just heard that MADONNA is using AI generated video backgrounds at her concerts. Many major shows feature amazing dramatic videos, often with dazzling fractal geometry sequences.\n\nCreated by conventional means, these elaborate productions are labor intensive and costly. Forget that.\n\nIt seems like a logical choice for haunted attractions to use the powerful AI tools practically begging you to use them. Push some buttons, spin some dials, make it happen!\n\nMARCH 30, 2024 SATURDAY 2:30 PM - GIVING YOUR WILDEST IMAGINATION FREEDOM TO FLY\n\nHere we go again, blabbering about the supposed latest and greatest OPENAI generator SORA. It’s not even available to the public yet, but beta testers have been gleefully posting some startling realistic depictions of impossible stuff. https://openai.com/sora\n\nOne of the most amusing examples we’ve seen is SHY KIDS - AIR HEAD which is first in this compilation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwgJc5gP_tc\n\nAIR HEAD is but one example of bringing impossible stuff to life. “The sky is the limit” truly applies here. If you can think of it, AI will be happy to render it into convincing visuals. Here are some more possibilities: SORA - 14 NEWEST HOT EXAMPLES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhucjIBa5E\n\nMARCH 30, 2024 SATURDAY 2 PM - BATTLE OF THE BANDS\n\nMany moons ago, we packed up my brother’s band equipment into the family station wagon and drove to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn to a music store for a “Battle of the Bands.”\n\nI think it was Meyers Music, which was the smallest of the music stores on Michigan Ave. in Dearborn. There was also Wonderland Music, Hewitt’s Music, and Grinnell’s as I recall.\n\n***Local sidebar: Ron Henry Music also in Dearborn was on Ford Road, and was where I bought my ZICKOS clear drumset. Also, Anderson Music was on Ford Road.***\n\nIt was a friendly competition among local musicians and a real big deal. Each band tried to outdo the others, much as some haunted attractions do.\n\nBattle of the Bands is gone now, but there remains a major public arena where certain groups are trying their best at beating the competition.\n\nCan you guess what it is?\n\nPolitics.\n\nI know, I know...like at the big Thanksgiving Day Dinner there are two things NOT to bring up if you want to keep the peace: religion and politics right?\n\nYou don’t want to upset CRAZY UNCLE BOBO or whoever... forget politics and instead tell them about the amazing adventures you went on last fall at the WILDEST HAUNTED HOUSE YOU EVER SAW. Really? What was that like? Please pass the Brussels sprouts and I’ll tell you all about it!\n\nMARCH 29, 2024 FRIDAY 1 PM - FISH TO THE RESCUE FOR THE LAST TIME\n\nI can’t believe it. When growing up, the Weyands were our next door neighbors on Shady Hollow in Dearborn and they had two fish stores in Dearborn and Wyandotte.\n\nWEYAND FISHERIES is closing, and tomorrow is their FINAL DAY: https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/dining/2024/03/04/wyandotte-weyands-seafood-retail-store-will-close/72844643007/\n\nBOO HOO! This has been our longtime source of the BEST SMOKED FISH you’ll ever taste, just like going UP NORTH to the U.P. More later, I’m on my way there now for WHITEFISH & SALMON.\n\nMARCH 23, 2024 SATURDAY 8 PM - ATTENTION QUEEN FANS\n\nNow showing on TV20 WMYD in DETROIT - FREDDIE MERCURY: THE FINAL ACT, a 2 hour documentary.\n\nWe’ve been QUEEN FANS since the first self-titled album...cutting edge drum tones from producer Roy Thomas Baker...and of course the soulful searing vocals of Freddie Mercury.\n\nMARCH 14, 2024 THURSDAY 4 AM - HAUNTED JOURNEY BACK IN TIME\n\nWe’ve been diligently keeping our eyes open for AI VIDEOS reminiscent of haunted attractions, willing to travel to the ends of the earth and beyond if need be. Persistence is a virtue.\n\nAnd so it is that we present this gem made with MIDJOURNEY by MarsTraveler. It reminds us of THE REALM OF DARKNESS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmoy4-IIWk4\n\nMARCH 13, 2024 WEDNESDAY 6 PM - NEVER MIND\n\nAlready? Yup, forget all about SORA which is still delayed. They could be obsolete even before public release, thanks to MorphStudio and STABLE DIFFUSION 3.\n\nMORPHSTUDIO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6Q5k4yTiw\n\nSTABLE DIFFUSION 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiyGW1tCMOA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FST6wqz5s5Y\n\nMARCH 13, 2024 WEDNESDAY 3 PM - HOUSEKEEPING\n\nThe main page filled up again yesterday, so some content at the bottom of the page has been moved to Archive 42.\n\nAlso, in case you didn’t know there’s an EAST COAST TRANSWORLD CONVENTION: https://www.facebook.com/EastCoastHaunters\n\nMARCH 13, 2024 WEDNESDAY 3 AM - WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING\n\nLast night the AI ART SCENE changed the world forever again...like four or five times at least. Yawn...\n\nFirst GOOGLE, not to be outdone, quietly dropped GEMINI and LUMINERE promising game-changing paradigm shifts to astound you.\n\nBut then the SORA demos blew away virtually everything else: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU1gMloI0kc https://openai.com/sora Alas, public release is still unknown: https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099402/openai-text-to-video-ai-sora-public-availability\n\nAnd ELON MUSK is all in a tizzy flexing his legal muscles by taking OPENAI to court...wait a sec how can that be because MUSK started OPENAI to begin with...oh boy, those finicky billionaires...is the love affair with MICROSOFT over? Or is this just a quickie love spat?\n\nWho cares because IDEOGRAM just turned the tables on DALL-E, MIDJOURNEY, LEONARDO, CANVA and such with PROMPT COMPLIANCE & ACCURACY off the charts.\n\nLet’s say you want SPONGE BOB SQUARE PANTS in command of a space ship with PRESIDENT BIDEN & TRUMP as naughty schoolboy passengers about to be sent out the airlock if SPONGE BOB pushes the BIG RED BUTTON being guarded by REN & STIMPY. A wormhole threatens to suck everything into the abyss of outer space, Earth is seen in the ship’s viewer in the far distance.\n\nGood luck trying that with most AI places, save time clicky here: https://ideogram.ai/login\n\nWe used IDEOGRAM already to celebrate Leap Year with BIDEN & TRUMP: https://www.flickr.com/photos/45316911@N03/albums/72177720314688370/\n\nMARCH 13, 2024 WEDNESDAY 2 AM - CRAWLING OUT OF THE RABBIT HOLE\n\nNOW POSTED - HUSH pics from Devil’s Night 2023: https://www.flickr.com/photos/45316911@N03/\n\nFEBRUARY 26, 2024 MONDAY 6 PM - DANCING IN THE STREETS\n\nMARTHA REEVES made a surprise appearance at the SAG-AFTRA MICHIGAN VIEWING PARTY last Saturday night -- it was fabulous! She is so cool, as well as our many other union brothers and sisters in attendance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68Uv959QuCg HEAT WAVE - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k0GDQrK2jo\n\nFEBRUARY 26, 2024 MONDAY 5 PM - TRANSPECIES SCANDAL ALLEGED IN TAYLOR SWIFT MERMAID STAGE ROUTINE\n\nNEWS FLASH! As you know, we at Zioptis have a special place in our heart for the MARVELOUS MERMAIDS in showbiz -- like Morgaine Rosenthal with CIRQUE ITALIA who WOWED MICHIGAN: https://www.flickr.com/photos/45316911@N03/albums/72177720300900927/\n\nAnd now we have another unofficially official adopted MERMAID KID SISTER -- Taylor Swift. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3aIxNywRpc\n\nSWIFTIES FEELING OF BELONGING - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCC7H5iNnCc We often mention the powerful “shared experience” aspect of haunted attractions -- this also applies to pop concerts in massive arenas!\n\nFEBRUARY 25, 2024 SUNDAY 11:11 PM - NEW & IMPROVED, THE AMAZING GAME CHANGER\n\nYeah, yeah Zioptis, we’ve heard it before -- the latest and greatest new widget you can’t live without, and didn’t even know existed until a few minutes ago.\n\nIt will change forever the way you thought about entertainment and movies.\n\nHOLLYWOOD FACES TOTAL ANNIHILATION AS SORA SOARS OVER NEW HAS-BEENS\n\nYawn.\n\nThere are all kinds of AI programs out there for making images and videos.\n\nRUNWAY GEN2, LEONARDO, and MIDJOURNEY are cool I guess but you only get 30 seconds per segment. Others say DALL-E and PIKA LABS are the way to go. But the top pros would never use anything but real cameras and such, right?\n\nBefore you answer, consider that recently some HOLLYWOOD BIGWIG was poised to invest $800 BILLION in a brand new state-of-the-art studio. Ready to sign the check.\n\nBut then he saw a demo of SORA that quickly changed his perspective, probably something like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFwzaAU8xFA\n\nSORA WILL CHANGE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ3WtQRn9xs\n\nSORA FULL ANALYSIS - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYTRFKGR9wQ\n\nSHORT DEMO WITH GOLDEN RETRIEVERS PODCASTING ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmNl6-UBmbI\n\nIS THIS THE END OF CREATIVE TRUST - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G690CqaTPJ0\n\nThe future is now. Who will be the first haunted attraction to develop a video with SORA?\n\nFEBRUARY 24, 2024 SATURDAY 1 PM - DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE\n\nI’ve been busy on the other side of our dual-identity computer, in the home stretch working on the HUSH pictures. They’ll be coming soon!\n\nBut right now I’m getting ready to join my fellow SAG-AFTRA Michigan members as we get together tonight at our annual Awards Viewing Party.\n\nThe SAG AWARDS (Screen Actors Guild) are a little different from other movie awards shows like The Academy Awards, as the SAG members vote for the winners.\n\nFEBRUARY 16, 2024 FRIDAY 2 PM - GOOD TO THE LAST DROP\n\nHUSH HAUNTED ATTRACTION in WESTLAND is open tonight and tomorrow! https://valentinehauntdetroit.com/\n\nIf you didn’t already go on Valentine’s Day, why not floor your sweetie with an amazing adventure never to be forgotten? CARPE DIEM, BABY!\n\nFEBRUARY 16, 2024 FRIDAY 12:53 AM - DETROIT ROCK CITY USA\n\nThe Motor City played a pivotal role in Motown music and Rock ‘N’ Roll. The whole world turned its’ ears to Detroit, and it continues to this day.\n\nFor example, just now on LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MYERS as they were cutting away to an ad break the band played “KICK OUT THE JAMS” by the MC5. The studio audience heard the rest of the song while the TV audience saw some ads.\n\nMC5 is short for Motor City 5, and they were the house band of sorts at the GRANDE BALLROOM in DETROIT. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ5NZnzlLA\n\nThe raw, primal energy this band unleashed is legendary and has been cited by many other bands as an early influence.\n\nLater, Detroit was the birthplace of TECHNO MUSIC which is celebrated every year as people from all over the world flock to an international festival. https://movementfestival.com/\n\nThe world also looks to Detroit as the BIRTHPLACE OF HAUNTED ATTRACTIONS.\n\nSo you can see -- in many ways planet Earth looks to Detroit as an entertainment leader of the pack!\n\nFEBRUARY 15, 2024 THURSDAY 10 PM - HOW MGM NEARLY RUINED THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME\n\nQuick, what’s the greatest movie of all time?\n\nMany would say THE WIZARD OF OZ. Many moons ago it was shown only once per year, and it was a major event.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY HOWARD ARLEN\n\nToday is Howard Arlen’s birthday. But who is he, and what does that have to do with this?\n\nHe wrote a song you’ve probably heard called “Somewhere Over The Rainbow.” You probably can picture it...a young girl on a farm with her small dog...contemplating her life journey...her soul cries out as she sings a song while wishing she could fly like a bluebird.\n\nBEING WRITTEN\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhRIbjvTjfw\n\nFEBRUARY 15, 2024 THURSDAY 12 NOON - WHOLE LOTTA LOVE\n\nRock music almost always has electric guitars. Many times it’s the first thing you hear in the song. Like some of you already have a certain Jimmy Page riff running through your mind... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmmM_qwG4k\n\nOr how about STEVEN WILSON? He’s the guy from England who has several bands, with PORCUPINE TREE being his flagship effort. They seriously rock, but with complexity and proficiency of the highest level.\n\nSeveral of our friends name PORCUPINE TREE as being rare in that they produce EXCITING NEW MUSIC in a sea of 3 chord bands on late night TV.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION\n\nFEBRUARY 14, 2024 WEDNESDAY 10 PM - AFTERGLOW\n\nHopefully you had a wonderful evening with your Valentine’s Day sweetie, and now you’re back at your place for “only a little while.”\n\nThe right music can work miracles, setting the right mood. Try this sleeper gem from Steven Wilson, the guy behind PORCUPINE TREE. SIGNIFICANT OTHER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAColKjZJz0\n\nAfter that, “WIND AND WUTHERING” by GENESIS should do the trick by the time the last track plays which is literally called “Afterglow.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB17cC8lBuY&list=PLDD6nAEVVZxGbso0OD9XesiUVU2YFp8W4\n\nYou’re welcome. (:\n\nFEBRUARY 14, 2024 WEDNESDAY 2 PM - OF THESE THE GREATEST IS LOVE\n\nHappy Valentine’s Day / Ash Wednesday! Love is in the air, and Cupid’s arrow will be doing its’ job bringing lovers together.\n\nHUSH HAUNTED ATTRACTION in WESTLAND will be bringing lovers together starting tonight for a special 3 night off-season run. Based on their great success last year, we feel confident in giving it our full endorsement. https://valentinehauntdetroit.com/\n\nMany moons ago, we presented a special Valentine’s Day episode on ZIOPTIS DIAL-A-TRIP that features FIN-TIN THE DIRT FACED CLOWN who we occasionally mention here.\n\nUnfortunately, all of our answering machines used for ZIOPTIS DIAL-A-TRIP are broken. It’s too long for here, so we’re putting the script for “FIN-TIN’S PANCAKE PRINCESS” at the top of Archive 42. There’s no audio, so imagine hearing sad violin music in a minor key under the voice over: http://www.zioptis.com/html/archive_42.shtml\n\nFEBRUARY 13, 2024 TUESDAY 2 PM - THROWING A MONKEY WRENCH IN VALENTINE’S PLANS\n\nTV News has just reported that LYFT, UBER, and DOORDASH will be going on strike tomorrow which is VALENTINE’S DAY.\n\nSome of you are probably planning on using one of these services to go to HUSH HAUNTED ATTRACTION tomorrow for the first of three days of their VALENTINE’S DAY event. https://hushhauntedattractions.com/\n\nIf so make alternate transportation plans today!\n\nFEBRUARY 12, 2024 MONDAY 2 PM - HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY!\n\nTaylor said: “It was unbelievable! That was the craziest thing I’ve ever experienced.”\n\nWOW! What a great game it was last night with the KANSAS CITY CHIEFS winning THE SUPER BOWL in overtime. The game lived up to the hype and then some, with frequent cutaways to TAYLOR SWIFT whooping it up having the time of her life: https://ftw.usatoday.com/2024/02/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-super-bowl-2024-postgame-conversation\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2024/02/12/sports/brittany-mahomes-message-to-taylor-swift-after-chiefs-super-bowl-win/\n\nFEBRUARY 12, 2024 MONDAY 11:11 AM - SWIFTIES CONQUER ALL WHO DARE OPPOSE QUEEN TAYLOR\n\nWe’re still not buying her records, but Taylor Swift won the Super Bowl last night in a thrilling surprise finish!\n\nIt was so much fun seeing her having big fun and letting loose with her girlfriends and MAMA KELCE. The happy vibes flew straight out of TV screens worldwide and made everyone with a heart smile!\n\nOh yeah, there was a football game too and her boyfriend’s team won at the last moment.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs may have won a title, but the real winner was FEMALE EMPOWERMENT.\n\nNot only that, BEYONCE ran an ad that appears to be announcing a NEW MUSIC DROP from the other queen.\n\nAs you probably know, BEYONCE is also true royalty in musical hierarchy with her own army of followers lovingly known as “THE BEE HIVE.”\n\nThey don’t know it yet, but TAYLOR SWIFT, BEYONCE and SHAKIRA will be joining CANDY FISHALOT aka TRACY BEACH as her Personal Posse for a ZIOPTIS LIGHT PAINTING photo shoot at a MAJOR DETROIT MEGA HAUNT, pending movie script completion and logistics research.\n\nThe movie’s working title is “REDEMPTION IN A HOOPTIE - JANE & TRACY’S AMAZING TRYST WITH DESTINY.” In case you don’t know, a “hooptie” is a junk car, in this case Tracy’s POWDER BLUE FORD PINTO STATION WAGON she used to escape her abusive boyfriend in Toledo, Ohio.\n\nThe car is littered with empty garlic paste containers and dog food cans, and features a CRAIG brand cassette player. A tape is stuck inside, “THE INNER MOUNTING FLAME by MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA” and Tracy becomes intimately familiar with the highly complex drumming this masterpiece features.\n\nThis knowledge eventually plays a key role in unlocking the secrets of life that allude poor Tracy, who life has crapped on at every possible phase of her beleaguered existence.\n\nMost movies following this format of THE HERO’S JOURNEY have an ALL IS LOST moment, when things couldn’t possibly get any worse. But this movie has a long series of ALL IS LOST moments, further endearing the audience to the hapless waif.\n\nFEBRUARY 11, 2024 SUNDAY 8:15 PM - HALF TIME SUPER BOWL PREDICTION\n\nHere’s our 100% guaranteed outcome prediction: If TRAVIS & TAYLOR win The Super Bowl, they will not gloat. If they lose, they will not complain. It’s called class, something they both have. TRUTH MATTERS!\n\nFEBRUARY 11, 2024 SUNDAY 12 NOON - BUFFALO DIP & CHICKEN WINGS\n\nHAPPY SUPER BOWL SUNDAY!\n\nA mountain of chicken wings and a sea of Ranch Dressing will be finding its’ way into the plumbing infrastructure of countless cities across the USA. The phones won’t stop ringing at every pizza parlor in town. It too will end up in the extensive sewage system.\n\nTHE BIGGEST & BADDEST EVER\n\nThis is the most widely promoted and ballyhooed sporting event in the USA every year, with tonight on track to set new records.\n\nThe primary driving force behind this doesn’t even play football to our knowledge. She’s a self made billionaire with a modest disposition, and a penchant for making giant donations at food banks in every city she goes to.\n\nFor example, after she played 2 sold out shows at LEVI’S STADIUM she made a donation to the food bank in Santa Clara. They wouldn’t give a dollar amount, but said it was enough to feed 500,000 people per month for a year!\n\nSo who is this new hero?\n\nIn case you had your head in the sand, we’re talking about Taylor Swift. She is AN AMERICAN TREASURE, and has created a curious new phenomenon. Her boyfriend is a NFL FOOTBALL STAR, turning her Army of Swifties into instant football fans.\n\nTHE TAYLOR SWIFT EFFECT\n\nMany of them have dads who for years have watched football without them. But that was then, and this is now the SWIFTIE ERA.\n\nSuddenly, teenage girls are asking dad if they can watch the football game with them.\n\nReally? Are you kidding? What dad in his right mind wouldn’t want that? To squander such an opportunity would be insanely stupid IMHO.\n\nA real dad would never trash their daughter’s hero, right? But sadly, some of them do...maybe not directly to their daughter’s face, but in words and deeds affecting their future freedoms...\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION\n\nFEBRUARY 11, 2024 SUNDAY 11:11 AM - TAYLOR SWIFT ELECTED QUEEN OF SUPER BOWL\n\nWe’re still not buying her albums. But there’s no denying that TAYLOR SWIFT has changed the landscape of pro football, quicker than you can say Jack Robinson. Besides, everybody has forgotten about Colin Kapernik.\n\nA new breed of football fans think of church when they hear the phrase “HAIL MARY.” Lots of them don’t yet have a driver’s license.\n\nI saw a picture of one of them, an adorable ten year old girl holding a sign that said “GO TAYLOR’S BOYFRIEND!”\n\nFootball will never be the same. CARPE DIEM, BABY!\n\nFEBRUARY 11, 2024 SUNDAY 3 AM - LONG DISTANCE RUNAROUND\n\nNo, not the song by YES. It’s a special private jet airplane flight currently on its’ way to LAS VEGAS from JAPAN. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La9Me7alNqA\n\nOur kid sister TAYLOR SWIFT played a sold-out concert in Japan yesterday, and is probably asleep right now en route to the USA.\n\nThe authorities in Japan were happy to help get Taylor and her jet safely off in time to make it to The Super Bowl later today. THANK YOU, JAPAN! The whole world loves Taylor.\n\nFEBRUARY 10, 2024 SATURDAY 11:11 PM - FLIPPING THE COIN OF DESTINY\n\nSo who are you going to root for in The Super Bowl tomorrow, the SAN FRANCISCO 49ers or the KANSAS CITY CHIEFS?\n\nIf the 49ers win, isn’t that better as far the reputation of The Lions is concerned? Because the only team that could beat us also beats the closest other competitor, right?\n\nSo if you’re a TRUE BLUE LIONS FAN the 49ers should be your choice.\n\nBut I have relatives in Kansas, and Taylor Swift has become our unofficial official adopted kid sister... So we’re rooting for the KANSAS CITY CHIEFS along with untold MILLIONS OF SWIFTIES!\n\nDON’T MESS WITH THE SWIFTIES\n\nMake no mistake, QUEEN TAYLOR rules an army. They are kind and gracious, but also wildly enthusiastic and highly protective of her like a bully big brother. As long as you don’t mess with their queen, you’ll be fine. But don’t cross the line, lest you endure the wrath of the masses.\n\nFEBRUARY 10, 2024 SATURDAY 10:06 PM - SNL RERUN WITH TRAVIS KELCE HOSTING NOW PLAYING ON NBC TV\n\nFEBRUARY 10, 2024 SATURDAY 10 PM - WHISTLE BLOWER IN TELL-ALL SECRET SUPER BOWL CONSPIRACY\n\nNEWS FLASH! We have a shocking report from an insider who would speak only under the condition of remaining anonymous, spilling the beans exclusively to Zioptis News:\n\nThe Pentagon has rigged the football game tomorrow -- the KANSAS CITY CHIEFS will win by 1 point in a thrilling but fixed nail biter. Then TAYLOR SWIFT and TRAVIS KELCE will get engaged on LIVE TV, and TAYLOR will announce she is buying the team who will now be known as KANSAS CITY SWIFTIES.\n\nSaving the best for last, Taylor will then “introduce the new team manager” as PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN suddenly appears on stage for a big happy group hug. Jaws will drop, and Taylor will perform a new song written for the occasion. JOE BIDEN will sing backup harmony parts with uncanny precision thanks to AI software. The audience goes wild.\n\nSo there you have it. No need to tune in tomorrow and waste precious time you could be using to sort your pocket lint or eating a custard filled PACSKI.\n\nFEBRUARY 10, 2024 SATURDAY 6 PM - ZERO EFFORT\n\nSome people spend their lives trying to get famous, but never make it wasting priceless time in the process. Even worse, many of these folks abandon life’s treasures along the way in fruitless efforts to hit the big time.\n\nSome people reverse the process. Hitting the big time is the last thing on their mind as they embrace life’s rewards first and foremost. They treasure each and every precious moment “SMELLING THE ROSES” as they go.\n\nFEBRUARY 10, 2024 SATURDAY 3 PM - BOO!\n\nTonight is your big chance! Off season VALENTINE HAUNT EVENTS will be held tonight at AZRA, ELOISE, and THE SCREAM MACHINE.\n\nAnd then HUSH will have their VALENTINE HAUNT EVENT on February 14, 16 & 17 from 7 - 10 PM.\n\nFEBRUARY 9, 2024 FRIDAY 10 AM - WITCH’S REVENGE TOMORROW\n\nHere’s another PRIMO CHOICE for a Valentine’s Date like no other, at THE SCREAM MACHINE in TAYLOR. https://thescreammachine.com/\n\nIt’s one night only, Saturday 7-10 PM February 10, 2024 which is tomorrow.\n\nIf you haven’t been to the new location for THE SCREAM MACHINE here’s your big chance! And if you have seen it, it’s still a great opportunity to get your haunt on at this longtime Downriver fave.\n\nFEBRUARY 8, 2024 THURSDAY 6 PM - THE SILVER SCREEN\n\nWe’ve been exploring some fascinating AI FILMS and wondering how they might help haunted attractions.\n\nBut movies are not new to haunted attractions, with one fabulous example coming from CRAZY BOB TURNER at HAUNTED HYDRO in FREMONT, OHIO. They fashioned a movie theater from one of their buildings, with bleachers and props to simulate a typical movie house. The movie they showed was filmed inside that same structure!\n\nThis produced a strange mirror-image feel to the presentation, that also included many scenes of VINTAGE FORD CARS & TRUCKS in pristine condition. As I recall this surreal movie ran about 10 minutes.\n\nLooking to shorter length movies from haunts, we have many examples ranging from intros shown before entering the haunt to “trailers,” or short promotion videos designed to attract fans. Some of these are masterpieces! Here’s a few at random: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkI4WTtNi9E&t=1s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy13ixGRnmA\n\nFEBRUARY 8, 2024 THURSDAY 3 PM - LEGENDARY DETROIT ROCKER TEAMS UP WITH ROB ZOMBIE\n\nThis should be a monster! https://www.livenation.com/event/vv17OZbdGknWHSTN/rob-zombie-and-alice-cooper-freaks-on-parade-2024-tour\n\nFEBRUARY 6, 2024 TUESDAY 5 PM - ORANGE MAN DECLARES “HOLY WAR” ON AMERICA’S SWEETHEART & NFL\n\nIt’s on. A war for no good reason.\n\nThere’s no volleyball scholarship. No stint at financial giant Goldman Sachs. There’s no limit to all the stuff a politician can tell you!\n\nIt’s so easy to get confused about politics...people getting upset, lashing out...why can’t we spend all that energy on haunted attractions instead? Maybe the TV NEWS can tell us why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXVi7RJdbXM\n\nFEBRUARY 6, 2024 TUESDAY 4 PM - LOOKING INTO THE CRYSTAL BALL, AGAIN\n\nAh yes, I can see it now: A 2nd MAJOR DETROIT HAUNT will use AI in their show. EREBUS was the first, which proved a prediction of ours correct BTW\n\nSo what kind of innovative way for a new twist in a MAJOR GAG could a haunt use?\n\nThe sky’s the limit...looking for a serious mind messer...what kind of imagery from beyond can we come up with...how best to present it...what if we insert crazy stupid prompts into MIDJOURNEY or LEONARDO then feed it to RUNWAY GEN2? Let’s make up some wacky prompts...Wooden Candy Bar Demon...Bob Slobber Barbecue Trout Mix...Rhinoplasty Custer Strut...Jello Choo Choo Train...Concrete Pillow Monster NEON PETER MAX REMIX...\n\nThe AI SHORT FILM scene is exploding, and it seems likely that somewhere a haunt operator is experimenting with making strange mind blowing movies as we speak...\n\nLet’s take a look at what some people have come up with:\n\nECHOES OF NOW - THE VISIBLEMAKER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cs9iwG8htM\n\nGOLDEN TOUCH - COSMIC HORROR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUFmRyPLrjk\n\nTHE SOFT SIDE OF OUR AI FRIEND\n\nAnd we even found one with a unicorn that little girls would like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfxPrNTjQLU\n\nFEBRUARY 4, 2024 SUNDAY 11:30 PM - ICING ON THE TOP / KID SISTER MAKES GOOD!\n\nThey always save the biggest award for the end at THE GRAMMY’S, and just as we were hoping our little sister Taylor won ALBUM OF THE YEAR for “MIDNIGHTS.” The place went crazy, and Taylor was very gracious. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq-q-ZCZwxc\n\nNo doubt the nay sayers and conspiracy theorists will declare it a fixed contest, after all that’s exactly what they predicted.\n\nBut that’s just SOUR GRAPES it seems to us, although we are wondering when BEYONCE will win ALBUM OF THE YEAR as her husband JAY-Z was quick to point out. This was the only controversial moment of the evening we saw. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ic3fXuM52TI\n\nFEBRUARY 4, 2024 SUNDAY 11 PM - HEAT OF THE MOMENT\n\nCandy and Fin-Tin are dancing with joy, after seeing TAYLOR SWIFT BEING SILLY on The Grammy’s. She was giving noogies to someone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4UjSHlgsk\n\nRECORD OF THE YEAR AWARD = FLOWERS BY MILEY CYRUS\n\nFEBRUARY 4, 2024 SUNDAY 9 PM - TAYLOR SWIFT CAUGHT IN SECRET GIVEAWAY TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NON-SWIFTIES\n\nYou won’t hear it from Taylor or complaining politicians. Even the TV NEWS has largely ignored this BLOCKBUSTER OUTBURST OF KINDNESS. So allow us to toot her horn...\n\nEvery week she’s on tour, hundreds of thousands of FAITHFUL SWIFTIES pack arenas worldwide. While Taylor is thankful for a steady stream of SOLD OUT SHOWS, she also feels compelled to help the many thousands of WANNA BE SWIFTIES out there. These are the people who can’t afford to buy a ticket. Even worse, many of them can’t even afford to feed their families.\n\nTaylor is famous for\n\nunder construction\n\nFEBRUARY 4, 2024 SUNDAY 7 PM - A BLOODY MESS / ROB ZOMBIE CLOBBERS TAYLOR SWIFT IN GRUESOME GRAMMY’S TAKEDOWN\n\nWill this be the SHOCKING HEADLINE from the GRAMMY AWARDS SHOW later tonight which starts on CBS-TV at 8 PM? https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/04/arts/grammy-awards\n\nProbably not, because ROB ZOMBIE won’t be there to our knowledge.\n\nEven if he was, this would never happen. They both have too much class. We’re just kidding of course...and besides we know someone who worked closely with Rob Zombie, and in real life he’s nothing like his stage character.\n\nThe big hubbub about the GRAMMY’S TONIGHT is...you guessed it, of course it’s the top contender for MOST FAMOUS PERSON IN THE WORLD: POPEYE THE SAILOR TAYLOR SWIFT.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT & TOMMY LEE CAUGHT MAKING OUT IN GRAMMY’S CLOAK ROOM\n\nWill this be the SHOCKING HEADLINE from the GRAMMY AWARDS SHOW later tonight which starts on CBS-TV at 8 PM?\n\nProbably not, because TOMMY LEE won’t be there to our knowledge.\n\nBut if he was there, and Taylor decided to get wild and have some BIG BAD BOY FUN with him we would say YOU GO GIRL!\n\nTaylor has become our unofficially officially adopted kid sister, and we defend her life choices...especially when she upsets small minded politicians. Hmmm...how about this:\n\nWe think Taylor should invite President Biden AND President Trump to party with her at THE SUPER BOWL next Sunday night. Maybe they could all kiss and make up, and Taylor could add WORLD PEACE to her list of accomplishments!\n\nFOR HEIGHTS & DEPTHS NO WORDS CAN REACH, MUSIC IS THE SOUL’S OWN SPEECH\n\nIf TAYLOR SWIFT wins ALBUM OF THE YEAR some will claim that the contest was rigged and fixed. Nonsense.\n\nHere’s Taylor’s mindset, revealed in a video clip of a previous music awards show she was also nominated at: When someone else won, Taylor was the first on her feet for a STANDING OVATION to honor her competitor. That’s class.\n\nTREVOR NOAH is hilarious on The Grammy’s! More later...\n\nJONI MITCHELL will perform tonight on The Grammy’s! Love her big time, especially FOR THE ROSES.\n\nFEBRUARY 3, 2024 SATURDAY 6 PM - NEW HIT LIST\n\nThe latest report detailing 39,630 hits over the last period has been added to Archive 33: http://www.zioptis.com/html/archive_33.shtml\n\nFEBRUARY 2, 2024 FRIDAY 4 PM - ICE FESTIVAL IS A GO\n\nNever mind the mild weather, the 42nd ANNUAL PLYMOUTH ICE FESTIVAL is a go. Dry ice will assist the festivities which start at 5 PM TODAY: https://www.facebook.com/plymouthicefestival/\n\nOver 200 sculptures are made from 150,000 pounds of ice!\n\nDAIRY KING vs. DAIRY GO-ROUND\n\nAlso, a contest to determine the best gourmet ice cream is sure to please the kids of all ages that flock to this FROSTY FESTIVAL year after year.\n\nJANUARY 30, 2024 TUESDAY 4 PM - BIRDS OF A FEATHER\n\nNot sure if we already posted this cool looking Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/rankergraveyardshift\n\nJANUARY 30, 2024 TUESDAY 3 PM - DETROIT LIONS WIN SUPER BOWL!\n\nThe game last Sunday was rigged. There were many irregularities. In short, it was stollen by the bad guys!\n\nRidiculous? Of course, we’re just kidding.\n\nBut it’s this kind of fuzzy logic that sadly has seeped into politics, where 2 + 2 = 5 if the supreme leader says it does.\n\nTHE DETROIT LIONS lost the game, fair and square. It was close, but no cigar. Congratulations to the SAN FRANCISCO 49ers on their well deserved victory. To them we say LIVE LONG & PROSPER! And if they WIN THE SUPER BOWL, it will show that nobody else could beat the team that defeated The Lions.\n\nCritics may point to a key decision by Coach Dan Campbell to GO FOR IT on a 4th down instead of kicking a field goal for 3 points, the exact margin we lost by.\n\nHistory does not reveal its alternatives, so we’ll never know if we might have otherwise won. Nonetheless, we support Campbell’s decision to make a calculated risk.\n\nCalculated risks are part of the haunted attraction industry.\n\n“WHAT IF” we try something that nobody has ever tried before at a haunt? “WHAT IF” we spend our entire budget on just one incredible prop from DISTORTIONS UNLIMITED?\n\nThese are the questions industry leaders ask themselves, with the potential to make or break a haunt. God bless them, may they all LIVE LONG & PROSPER!\n\nJANUARY 28, 2024 SUNDAY 4 PM - DUSTING OFF THE CRYSTAL BALL\n\nOMG! The QB for the BALTIMORE RAVENS just caught his own pass for a gain of yardage. He threw the ball, it was deflected, and he was able to catch it and run! We’ve never seen this done before, and it will be on the news sports highlights later for sure.\n\nAnd we’re only about 2 hours away from kickoff for THE DETROIT LIONS vs. SAN FRANCISCO 49ers, with the winner going to the SUPER BOWL. We predict THE LIONS will win by 3 points.\n\nJANUARY 27, 2024 SATURDAY 11:11 PM - ROBOT RUDENESS\n\nIt was only a matter of time until somebody used AI for nefarious purposes, and now we have two incidents recently.\n\nFirst, a DEEPFAKE message using the voice of President Biden was sent to thousands of phones. It said not to vote now and waste your vote, wait until November.\n\nApparently, most people recognized this to be deliberate misinformation because Biden won the election despite not even being on the ballot. People wrote him in.\n\nSo the effort to discredit Biden bombed, and nobody cares...at least not us.\n\n***SIDE BAR - Biden is like the broad side of a barn, being an easy target for AI PRANKSTERS to poke light hearted fun at the POTUS. If you didn’t already see them, here’s FAKE BIDEN DAIRY QUEEN ADS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XID0yQueHuo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19xgfA4YncM US PRESIDENTS GO TO DAIRY QUEEN NEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otSATyp7BdA ***\n\nBut now some nefarious jerk has attacked our kid sister TAYLOR SWIFT in a disgusting way using AI, and it’s tempting to hit back.\n\nBut I was brought up learning that “two wrongs don’t make a right” so I should let it go...\n\nOn the other hand, if somebody else wants to take a swipe back that has MIDJOURNEY and RUNWAY GEN2 and a sharp sense of political humor who am I to say they shouldn’t?\n\nWe do have free speech, so let’s hear what SCARED KETCHUP makes of all this POLITICAL POLLUTION. Warning: Snarky political humor with spicy language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdzXluj5wkU\n\nJANUARY 27, 2024 SATURDAY 4 PM - BIG FUN IN THE D\n\nWhat youngster doesn’t love excitement, adventure, and fun? After all, those are key elements of haunted attractions which are wildly popular but closed right now.\n\nHere’s an event that will hurl you thousands of years into the past, straight into an experience sure to thrill the kids.\n\nWelcome to DINOSAUR ADVENTURE, running today and tomorrow at HUNTINGTON PLACE in DETROIT (formerly COBO HALL): https://dinosauradventure.com\n\nJANUARY 27, 2024 SATURDAY 3 PM - KINGS OF THE JUNGLE\n\nTHE DETROIT LIONS are only one victory away from being in The Super Bowl, and FORD FIELD is totally sold out for the game tomorrow.\n\nThe drum lines are ready, the cheerleaders have their pom poms in hand, the ice cold beer is ready, and the climate control is set at 70 degrees for maximum comfort of the screaming fans.\n\nWait a sec, isn’t the game being played in California?\n\nYup. But Lions fans are so pumped there’s a giant game viewing party at FORD FIELD. The only thing missing will be the physical presence of the football players, as the game will be seen on a barrage of giant TVs.\n\nOh wait, also missing will be TAYLOR SWIFT who will most likely be at another football game supporting her boyfriend in the CHIEFS.\n\nWe’re still not Swifties, but she has become our unofficially adopted kid sister who we’ve become very protective of like a bully big brother.\n\nJANUARY 24, 2024 WEDNESDAY 7 PM - STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS\n\nThe Governor of Michigan is giving the STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS right now on WXYZ TV 7.\n\nConditions in Michigan affect the haunted attraction industry, so it’s worth checking this out. More later...\n\nJANUARY 24, 2024 WEDNESDAY 1 PM - MORE MITTEN MAGIC\n\nHere’s another epic winter celebration that reminds us of CHRISTMAS IN IDA, but is much closer to Detroit: https://www.winterblast.com/ It runs Feb. 2-4, 2024\n\nJANUARY 23, 2024 TUESDAY 10 PM - THE SONG THAT BIRTHED PROG ROCK / CAME FROM BED SHEETS!\n\nRock music takes many forms -- alternative, metal, speed metal, hard, garage, grunge, punk, psychedelic, etc.\n\nRock music fans are known for extreme enthusiasm for their favorites. But what if you’re a musician yourself, having grown up surrounded by Motown and classical as well as rock?\n\nIf so, like me there’s a good chance you also become a fan of jazz and progressive rock aka PROG ROCK. PROG ROCK can be defined as combining elements of classical and jazz with rock. The tempo, time signature, and style can change many times in a single song.\n\nEarly masters of PROG ROCK include EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER, GENESIS, GENTLE GIANT, KING CRIMSON, JETHRO TULL, PINK FLOYD, SOFT MACHINE and YES.\n\nBut the band that brought this sub-genre of rock to the public limelight was a rhythm and blues band whose first big hit was anything but PROG, a slow rollicking song about love sick teenager angst.\n\nThis story, and many others about unlikely song origins are told by THE PROFESSOR OF ROCK on Youtube. Here’s the rest about this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDcgGvBb-SA Others: https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorofRock\n\nThis guy seems cool and a likely kindred spirit!\n\nJANUARY 22, 2024 MONDAY 3 PM - MY BLOODY VALENTINE\n\nVALENTINE’S DAY is coming soon, and here’s your chance to plan the perfect evening with your sweetie.\n\nDinner and a movie is old hat, and likely to result in a so-so experience. At dinner you look at each other while remembering to keep your mouth closed as you chew. Then you both look at a movie screen that demands attention.\n\nYawn. Forget that! We have a much better “serving suggestion” that virtually guarantees the happy ending you both want.\n\nOff season HAUNT EVENTS will be held at three major haunts -- AZRA CHAMBER OF HORRORS HAUNTED HOUSE in MADISON HEIGHTS, ELOISE ASYLUM in WESTLAND, and HUSH HAUNTED ATTRACTION in WESTLAND. https://azrahaunt.com/ https://eloiseasylum.com/ https://hushhauntedattractions.com/\n\nFor added impact this could be a surprise, but either way it’s big fun!\n\nJANUARY 22, 2024 MONDAY 2 AM - PARTY ALL AROUND THE WORLD\n\nThey were DANCING IN THE STREETS last night after the triumphant victory of THE DETROIT LIONS over our inferior opponents the TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS.\n\nDetroit was ground zero, but the positive energy exploded worldwide in a flash. SUPER BOWL FEVER is already affecting The Mitten, even though we need to win one more game against the SAN FRANCISCO 49ers before qualifying for the SUPER BOWL.\n\nWe have the momentum. We have the motivation. We have the talent. GO LIONS!\n\nJANUARY 21, 2024 SUNDAY 2:20 PM - THE FINAL COUNTDOWN\n\nNo, not the song...it’s the hubbub before the big football game with THE LIONS about to EAT BUCCANEERS FOR LUNCH in front of the whole world.\n\nJust practicing drums and listening to music before kickoff...any PROG ROCK fans out there...talkin’ early masters like GENESIS, KING CRIMSON, EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER, JETHRO TULL, and YES...speaking of YES, the closest we’ll probably see to a new YES album is the new TREVOR RABIN - “PUSH” BTW, Trevor was in YES during the BIG GENERATOR era.\n\nYou just have time to see his cool music video before game time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udpVPB223O0\n\nAnd here’s a VISUAL MASTERPIECE from STEVE HACKETT who played guitar for Genesis. This dropped 10 days ago and is from the album THE CIRCUS & THE NIGHTWHALE out on February 16th, 2024: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LwYc8_orY8\n\nATTENTION GENESIS FANS! Check out some awesome live Genesis songs superbly performed by Steve Hackett: https://www.youtube.com/@RulieArifin Also check with: https://www.youtube.com/@insideoutmusic\n\nJANUARY 21, 2024 SUNDAY 1:30 PM - WHO’S IN CHARGE NOW?\n\nI’ve been noticing something weird when working with AI generated images. When I tell LEONARDO to include certain words in the image, it never complies.\n\nMaybe you noticed this in the HEIDI TRAILER with Heidi spelled as HCRLIC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A2-Af5JEWU\n\nAnd sometimes the spelling changes on its own, but why and who decided that?\n\nHere’s more AI WEIRDNESS inspired by surreal artist BOSCH made with MIDJOURNEY and RUNWAY GEN2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3gsJUTG8JU\n\nJANUARY 21, 2024 SUNDAY 12:30 PM - AAARGH MATEY!\n\n2 1/2 hours from now, THE DETROIT LIONS will take on another bunch of football players with EVIL LOOKING SKULLS on their helmets as they try their best to WIN THE BIG GAME.\n\nWill Detroit win by 3 points, as we predicted last night?\n\nWe hope so, but either way we’re confident that kindness and respect will prevail. Last week our former QB MATTHEW STAFFORD was met with only a few token BOO’S, to be expected.\n\nBut people remember that he and his wife and kids spent 12 years doing their best to help The Lions win and were involved with many community improvement efforts in Detroit. Stafford is a class act by all measures.\n\nSo GO LIONS and ye shall certainly obliterate your inferior competitors, the TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS. By 3 points.\n\nJANUARY 21, 2024 SUNDAY 7 AM - HONOLULU BLUE & HOT CHOCOLATE\n\nThe Channel 4 Detroit local news is on, and the football tailgaters have already started arriving setting up grills and such...\n\nOfficial TV coverage starts at noon on WDIV TV 4 NBC, with short segment teasers along the way.\n\nLast week’s game went smoothly, with no major incidents and lots of police for safety. And when people are feeling safe and comfortable they’re more likely to spend more money. Last week’s game brought about $20 million in, and today should do at least as well.\n\nAnd just as important, Detroiter’s have made visitors feel welcome.\n\nAlso, there’s a DETROIT PISTONS hockey game at LITTLE CAESARS ARENA tonight! They delayed the start of the game by an hour to accommodate traffic and parking logistics.\n\nTime to go back to bed now, more later...\n\nJANUARY 21, 2024 SUNDAY 6 AM - REVEALED: SECRET SPACE ALIEN MUSIC MACHINES!\n\nHave you ever been up north far away from the BIG CITY LIGHTS and gazed up in wonder at the SKY FULL OF STARS?\n\nSurely there must be other planets where sentient beings of some sort have also “invented” music. There are certain constants throughout the universe like frequencies involving light and sound it seems...so I can’t help but wonder what would ALIEN BOOM BOXES look like?\n\nApparently a guy in India was also contemplating this issue. So he fired up MIDJOURNEY and RUNWAY GEN2 and made a music video for his band TETOUZE. Check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXVDqqqt3M\n\nOnce upon a time, it took lots of cash and planning to make elaborate music videos like “RIO” by DURAN DURAN for example.\n\nBut now anybody with a computer can get LEONARDO for free, which is almost a clone of MIDJOURNEY. NEWS FLASH! I just saw videos saying LEONARDO now has IMAGE2MOTION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2KYpCfdG-E https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTMaKREEYKU\n\nI’ve been using LEONARDO and it’s addicting! You can scroll thru the latest and greatest new art...click on one and copy the list of prompts...change the main character from a pretty girl to a singing frog or fish...dressed to the 9’s with a tux and top hat, playing a guitar...then try a black hole spinning vortex with earth seen from outer space... oh, wait maybe a scary monster on an alien planet instead like at a haunted attraction...hmmm, now I’m wondering...which MICHIGAN HAUNT will be the first to use AI ART on a really big scale?\n\nOne cool thing about LEONARDO is that they give you like 200 credits per day on the free plan, so you can only go so long before they run out and you have to stop. Of course they’re hoping you’ll be so immersed you won’t be able to stop and you’ll sign up for recurring payments.\n\nFREQUENSEERS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KLMmDbNvSU\n\nSUYRA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ13GVGYbfI PRIMAL PULSE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNrfO-z7QJY METAL LET IT GO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxi9edQlKk GOD MADE A DICTATOR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Q6Vq_7PVQ\n\nJANUARY 20, 2024 SATURDAY 10 PM - LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW\n\nFootball in winter can be brutal. THE BUFFALO BILLS recently had to literally hire football fans twice for $20 an hour to shovel 5 feet of snow out of the stadium to be able to have their game!\n\nThe weather in Detroit for tomorrow’s big game will be brutal, with subzero wind chill temperatures. But that won’t stop the zealous tailgaters, as they party hearty in preparation of The Lions in their relentless pursuit of WINNING THE SUPER BOWL!\n\nBut we have a secret weapon that will kick in as soon as the tailgaters are done. Okay, it’s not a secret -- it’s the fact that FORD FIELD is a covered heated stadium. Fans will casually stroll in, and make their way to their seats in climate controlled comfort. Of course the beer will still be ice cold, just not the stadium itself.\n\nOnce again, DETROIT rules and the whole world will be watching.\n\nLast Sunday we correctly predicted The Lions would win by 1 point, in a posting at 4 PM.\n\nSo let’s look into the crystal ball again. Ah, here it is -- THE DETROIT LIONS will win the game tomorrow by 3 points.\n\nJANUARY 20, 2024 SATURDAY 3 PM - THAT OLD TIME RELIGION\n\nGimmee that old time religion, it’s good enough for me” so goes the song and for some of us AUTHENTIC HAUNT PROPS are like a religion.\n\nNothing else screams STEEPED IN HISTORY haunt scenes like REAL ANTIQUES, especially if they’re still in their original location like on NAUTICAL NIGHTMARE which was a haunt made from an old BOB LO ISLAND BOAT.\n\nWho remembers the incredible analog electronics room at HAUNTED HILL ACRES in BELLEVILLE? Or the mammoth gear in DARK LEGACY in NOVI? (Both of these haunts are gone.)\n\nAs for haunts still open, we’d have to say the hands-down most incredible assortment of old analog equipment is at THE EDSON INCIDENT in BAY CITY.\n\nThis haunt is literally aboard an old battle ship from the VIETNAM ERA. Almost every room has some sort of old analog electronic equipment, with lots of it being used as you make your way through this HISTORICAL TREASURE HOUSE!\n\nJANUARY 20, 2024 SATURDAY 2 PM - VINTAGE ELECTRONICS SHOW TODAY\n\nSorry for the short notice -- possible props for analog electronics room of a haunt from MICHIGAN VINTAGE ELECTRONICS CLUB in SOUTHFIELD until 4 PM today. https://www.thevee.org/\n\nJANUARY 14, 2024 SUNDAY 11:11 PM - ZIOPTIS PREDICTS THE FUTURE AGAIN!\n\nFirst we predicted a Michigan haunt would use AI last season, and EREBUS proved us right as previously reported.\n\nEarlier today in the 4 PM posting, we predicted The Lions would win by 1 point. Here’s the final score: DETROIT LIONS 24 - LA RAMS 23\n\nOkay, so we got that right. However, we also said it would be “at the last moment of the game” which is not the case...it was like 2 minutes or so...and the truth matters so we’re only half right in the prediction.\n\nFIRST PLAYOFF WIN IN 32 YEARS!\n\nWhat a fabulous celebration it was, with kids of all ages up to 89 like a guy from GROSSE POINTE they highlighted.\n\nJANUARY 14, 2024 SUNDAY 5 PM - IMMERSIVE EXTRAVAGANZA TO CHALLENGE YOUR PERCEPTION OF SOUND\n\nThis sounds like an interesting sonic journey in FARMINGTON HILLS: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/imaginariun-music-experience-in-3-dimensional-sound-reality-tickets-786607884357?aff=ebpredboostfbandigads&td_campaign_id=613721&fbclid=IwAR0kI90fo4X mLFzOhWjH4Ohvacg5DGg7GbhYJS2Ms5XmQ_rfgWKd2BbY3f4\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/imaginariun-music-experience-in-3-dimensional-sound-reality-tickets\n\nJANUARY 14, 2024 SUNDAY 4 PM - ALL EYES ON DETROIT, AGAIN\n\nTHE DETROIT LIONS stand ready to make MINCE MEAT tonight of their former QB MATTHEW STAFFORD who returns with a new football team after we traded him away for JARED GOFF.\n\nThe media has played up the rivalry big time as expected, and the public is understandingly excited.\n\nRegardless, MATTHEW STAFFORD should be shown great respect and zero animosity or rudeness. After all, he and his wife were a dynamic positive presence in Detroit for like 7 years was it?\n\nWe can ROOT ROOT ROOT for the home team, if they don’t win it’s a shame...as the song goes...but it will be a proud moment for Detroit when we cheer for MATTHEW STAFFORD as he enters FORD FIELD tonight...and then cheer even louder when we beat them by 1 point at the last moment of the game! That’s our prediction, let’s see how close we called it.\n\nJANUARY 13, 2024 SATURDAY 2 PM - THE MOST WHOLESOME FAMILY FRIENDLY MOVIE MEETS THE WOOD CHIPPER\n\nAnyone remember HIGHLAND APPLIANCE? They ran silly TV ads, like one where they threw a dart at a map to decide a new store location. Competitor OLLIE FRETTER promised to give you FIVE POUNDS OF COFFEE if they couldn’t beat your best deal. A friend of ours qualified to get the reward...and it was a ONE pound can with a label claiming to be FIVE pounds! Wow, FAKE NEWS even then...haha\n\nAnyway, we recently joked about having beer guzzling buddies over to watch a big football game...and then at kickoff time showing the movie “Heide” instead. And HIGHLAND APPLIANCE ran an ad with this scenario.\n\nThe truth is that a real life mixup led to this story: https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-heidi-bowl\n\nPERMANENT PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE WARNING!\n\nAnyway, the wholesome nature of the HEIDE MOVIE makes it an easy target for a highly sinister AI remake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A2-Af5JEWU\n\nAnd check this alternate version, with a soundtrack reminiscent of TOD DOCKSTADER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pmyjtGXe4w\n\nJANUARY 13, 2024 SATURDAY 1 PM - DING DONG!\n\nNope, it’s not DRIZZLY or AVON CALLING.\n\nIt’s BACON BECKONING, and the LURE OF LORNA DOONE...\n\nIf you made NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS to improve your diet you may have tried to eliminate unhealthy cuisine choices. But forget all that.\n\nWe almost missed this gem of a discovery, but yesterday was NATIONAL QUITTER’S DAY: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/quitters-day-2024-from-abandoning-new-year-resolutions-to-setting-achievable-goals-12044141.html\n\nHave you ever woke up to the alluring aroma of bacon coming from the kitchen? It’s no wonder dogs go wild for the stuff -- they even have a special treat for them mimicking bacon called BEGGIN’ STRIPS which some of you have in your pantry now.\n\nHow about LORNA DOONE shortbread cookies? They’ve been around since 1912, so they must be doing something right with their melt-in-the-mouth buttery goodness. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorna_Doone_(cookie)\n\nBut isn’t bacon loaded with saturated fat and sodium, and LORNA DOONE chock full of High Fructose Corn Syrup? Yup. *\n\nWho cares? Nobody expects you to follow through on those pesky NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS, so what better time to abandon them than NATIONAL QUITTER’S DAY or the day after?\n\nDENNY’S is open late, home of the GRAND SLAM BREAKFAST or RAM’S HORN with their PAUL BUNYAN COMBO. Both feature beau coup bacon.\n\n* = Saturated fat got a bad rap, that’s now been largely debunked. On the other hand, High Fructose Corn Syrup has been banned in Europe.\n\nJANUARY 12, 2024 FRIDAY 6:30 PM - HALLOWEEN SWEETS\n\nHalloween and candy go together like cheese and crackers. It’s one thing about Halloween that’s not creepy, right?\n\nBut hold on, don’t answer until you see this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDnnfGq73no\n\nAnd for the DOG LOVERS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7t2P9uV-vc&t=1s\n\nJANUARY 11, 2024 THURSDAY 4 PM - CREEPY B&W AMUSEMENT PARK AI FILM\n\nJust added to POOL FULL OF JELLO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryNtckMT49M\n\nThis might be the creepiest AI film so far! Maybe you shouldn’t watch it. Children being eaten by hideous creatures and such...yeah, never mind don’t watch this.\n\nJANUARY 9, 2024 TUESDAY 4 PM - A HORSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR\n\nHAUNTED AMERICA brings you a paranormal event with a difference: https://www.ghostconference.net/\n\nJANUARY 9, 2024 TUESDAY 3 PM - THE SPIRIT OF HALLOWEEN\n\nHalloween is all about fun and spooky stuff, but it’s also about The Golden Rule: https://www.facebook.com/reel/1332945614004328\n\nJANUARY 9, 2024 TUESDAY 2 PM - POOL FULL OF JELLO\n\nHave you ever had a nightmare where you’re trying to run away from something hideous, but your legs are bogged down? Try as you might, your legs won’t respond and running away is suddenly not an option.\n\nAs we’ve seen, AI is a quick learner and this is something it learned in Kindergarten. Depending on your point of view, this could be a curse or a blessing. If you’re creating a haunted attraction, this could be wonderful. But if you’re an Ordinary Joe, who knows what sort of psychological damage could be inflicted on an unsuspecting public?\n\nWe’ve seen through a variety of AI films that a multitude of personalities can emerge, depending on the input or “prompts” as they say on major AI platforms like MIDJOURNEY and LEONARDO which we use.\n\nAs this is a website dedicated to HALLOWEEN and HAUNTED ATTRACTIONS, we’ve been seeking the creepiest and most disturbing manifestations of AI films.\n\nFirst it was a DYSTOPIAN FAKE BEER COMMERCIAL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Geja6NCjgWY and then the twisted GLEEFULLAND https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuIS5K-6p8I But those are SUNSHINE & LOLLIPOPS compared to POOKY PARK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryNtckMT49M\n\nJANUARY 8, 2024 MONDAY 11:11 PM - HAIL TO THE VICTORS!\n\nThe UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN football team just defeated their inferior competition WASHINGTON to win the National Championship!\n\nSeventeen couches are on fire in Ann Arbor and the world once again is focused on Michigan, the birthplace of haunted attractions.\n\nLet the good times roll! Please pass the grey poupon.\n\nJANUARY 7, 2024 SUNDAY 5 PM - NFL BOWS TO DETROIT ROYALTY\n\nTHE DETROIT LIONS just defeated their inferior competition 30 - 20, putting them one step closer to WINNING THE SUPER BOWL!\n\nNFL DEMANDS THE WORLD SHALL RESPECT DETROIT\n\nAs noted below, a segment of “RESPECT” by ARETHA FRANKLIN was played going into the TWO MINUTE WARNING.\n\nThis clearly a message to the world that DETROIT is to be respected and revered...or else!\n\nJANUARY 7, 2024 SUNDAY 2:30 PM - FIND THE QUEEN OF ALL MY DREAMS\n\nSo goes a line from “RAMBLE ON” by LED ZEPPELIN.\n\nA portion of this song was just played going into half-time of THE DETROIT LIONS game that’s being played right now on FOX-TV with Detroit leading 13-3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzGBQerkvWs\n\nNFL & FOX-TV DECLARE ROLLING STONES GUILTY OF FAKE NEWS SCANDAL, SORTA\n\nTV SPORTS & ROCK ‘N’ ROLL go together like cheese & crackers. Often they play rock music leading into ads, trying to sound cool and keep you tuned to that channel.\n\nSo a decision as to which song is best for the task is made by a big shot TV producer. If the best result comes from the best music, this choice also correlates to the best band among the many qualifiers one could reasonably argue.\n\nBut WHO exactly is “The World’s Greatest Rock ‘N’ Roll Band?”\n\nSome people will say THE ROLLING STONES, but which people? Turns out it’s the band themselves that first coined the phrase and claimed to be “The World’s Greatest Rock ‘N’ Roll Band.”\n\nIt’s a catchy name so it caught on, and was plugged by many with no musical experience other than playing the radio.\n\nBut in terms of musicianship and mastery of their instruments, LED ZEPPELIN blew away THE ROLLING STONES by a Country Mile.\n\nFor example, on the above RAMBLE ON we hear the an iconic bass guitar lead melody line for the ages from JOHN PAUL JONES. And JIMMY PAGE is widely considered as among the world’s best.\n\nFor comparison, KEITH RICHARD has used a guitar that is tuned to a chord -- look for him using one finger across the fret board instead of fingering chords. A guitar expert told me about this, it’s NOT fake news! BTW, we’re not saying we don’t like Keith, just that we shouldn’t overestimate his level of guitar expertise.\n\nDrums? That’s my specialty as it happens, and trust me JOHN BONHAM is widely cited as being an early influence by drummers. CHARLIE WATTS, well, not so much mentoring there...but God bless him anyway and R.I.P. CHARLIE WATTS drumming brother...\n\nSo does that mean LED ZEPPELIN is “The World’s Greatest Rock ‘N’ Roll Band?”\n\nBefore you answer, check out some bands you may have never heard of. Listen to another one of the world’s best bass players BILLY SHEEHAN with MR. BIG. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Sheehan\n\nMR. BIG - ADDICTED TO THAT RUSH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoSD0DLQII0\n\nFor shear raw power and emotional impact, singer RAY GILLEN (R.I.P.) was critically acclaimed among the best. And former OZZY guitarist JAKE E. LEE was on the level of other stellar talents such as STEVE VAI and JASON BECKER (R.I.P.). This band never had the success many argued they deserved. Give them a listen and see if you agree!\n\nBADLANDS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U124rg_L-M\n\nGoing into the TWO MINUTE WARNING ad break, they played a portion of “RESPECT” by ARETHA FRANKLIN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FOUqQt3Kg0\n\nAretha is widely regarded as THE QUEEN OF SOUL throughout Planet Earth, again focusing the world on Detroit.\n\nSo you can see -- when it comes to being cool in general and having the best music and haunted attractions Detroit is a sure winner!\n\nJANUARY 7, 2024 SUNDAY 1 PM - FINALLY, A HALLOWEEN AI FILM\n\nWe’ve been exploring the wacky world of AI produced films, but so far hadn’t mentioned any specifically about Halloween which is the prime focus of this website.\n\nTA-DAH! Here it is from DAVID MANN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wCSpq5XKzQ\n\nSo far, we’ve shown creepy and/or disturbing AI films. But they don’t have to be -- also from DAVID MANN an inspirational Christmas film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K677H_yCzu0\n\nDon’t get too comfortable though, because soon we’ll show you the hands-down creepiest AI film ever that embodies key elements of haunted attractions big time!\n\nJANUARY 5, 2024 FRIDAY 4 PM - SCHUSSING TIME AGAIN\n\nMT. BRIGHTON SKI AREA is open right now! They’ve been making snow like there’s no tomorrow -- IT’S A GO. https://www.mtbrighton.com/\n\nSkiing in Michigan is such a blast! My favorite is Boyne Highlands, or Nub’s Nob if the Highlands or Boyne Mountain are too busy.\n\nWe also have fond memories of BLUE MOUNTAIN in COLLINGWOOD, ONTARIO ...many say this blows away anything in Michigan BTW... https://www.bluemountain.ca/\n\nJANUARY 5, 2024 FRIDAY 1 PM - 273 MILLION AND COUNTING\n\nEarlier we reported that TAYLOR SWIFT has 272 million followers on INSTAGRAM, confirmed at that time. This is significant as many of them fall into the demographic of haunted attraction patrons.\n\nBut because THE TRUTH MATTERS, we must now report the facts have changed. There are now 273 million followers of Taylor Swift on Instagram. To put this in context, the population of the entire USA is about 335 million.\n\nThe SWIFTIES are taking over, and no amount of bickering or claims to the contrary can stop the tsunami of good will and love for their anointed queen.\n\nCANDY FISHALOT is a proud Swiftie, and FIN-TIN THE DIRT FACED CLOWN looks to Candy for guidance as his MOMMY DROPPED HIM ON HIS HEAD. This essentially makes FIN-TIN a Swiftie in a different demographic from most of them.\n\nFIN-TIN is confused about all the political hubbub, but he has a good heart so Candy tries her best to help him navigate life’s challenges and find the truth in a world of ALTERNATIVE FACTS and FAKE NEWS.\n\nNO VOLLEY BALL SCHOLARSHIP OR STINT AT GOLDMAN SACHS\n\nRecently, FIN-TIN came up with what he thought was the BIG ANSWER to current political chaos when he suggested that TAYLOR SWIFT should run for president of the USA!\n\n“Good for you, that’s using the noggin!” declared Candy as she hugged him showing support.\n\n“Promise me you’ll never stop trying to help people, even those who are stupid and evil.” “I promise.”\n\n“That’s a great idea Fin-Tin, but sadly it can’t happen.” “Why not, Candy?”\n\n“Taylor is not eligible to run for President. The Constitution of the United States says you have to be 35 years old to run for President, and Taylor is only 34.” “Yippee! In another year, she can run for President!”\n\n“Actually, no. Even though she’s lived in the USA for at least fourteen years, she was born in Canada. The Constitution says you have to be born in the USA, and we have to follow the Constitution.” “Rats! What about the man with the hair?”\n\n“He’s not eligible either, because he made an insurrection happen 3 years ago tomorrow.” “What’s an insurrection, Candy?”\n\n“It means he’s a very bad man who doesn’t honor the wise men who wrote the Constitution.”\n\nWe have uncovered rare video footage of Taylor talking about politics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qRpDw3LZgM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGWlqKpyx-4\n\nAnd this, from some political big shots: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhjSEkkZ2aA\n\nNEWS FLASH! We just found rare video footage of Taylor discussing politics with her parents. She is from a close knit family, with traditional values like truth and respect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pdb53L_MpI\n\nSo where will it all end? Will democracy survive without TAYLOR SWIFT as President? These questions, and many more, will be revealed right here on ZIOPTIS so stay tuned my little monkeys...\n\nJANUARY 5, 2024 FRIDAY 11:11 AM - THE BIG PICTURE\n\nTHE ZIOPTIS STATE OF THE INDUSTRY REPORT will be released later this month. Stand by...\n\nJANUARY 2, 2024 TUESDAY 10 PM - BIRDS OF A FEATHER\n\nHere’s a Facebook group that looks like fun: https://www.facebook.com/rankergraveyardshift\n\nDog lovers: https://wearwolfclothing.com/product-category/pet-hoodies/\n\nJANUARY 2, 2024 TUESDAY 4 PM - PERPETUAL PROGRESS OR THE BEGINNING OF THE END?\n\nJust because you can do something doesn’t necessarily mean you should: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnI-3rK5ioc&t=17s\n\nINFINITE ZOOM SURREAL CITY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBVwUTN6o98\n\nBUSHMAN PRANK: https://www.facebook.com/100093024165692/videos/190011004140177\n\nJANUARY 2, 2024 TUESDAY 3 PM - FOOTBALL DUMMY\n\nOkay, we got it wrong. THE ROSE BOWL is not like THE SUPER BOWL of scholastic football. That’s next week, and then Michigan will be in the national spotlight.\n\nWe’ll be sure to stock up on chicken wings, beer, and get “HEIDI” cued up for kickoff. :)\n\nJANUARY 1, 2024 MONDAY 3 PM - NEW HIT LIST\n\nDetails of 41,765 hits over the last period: http://www.zioptis.com/html/archive_33.shtml\n\nLong ago, our Webmaster BILLY G (R.I.P.) told me the best way to get lots of hits was to keep adding new content. We’re doing our best, and it seems to be paying off. Thank you!\n\nJANUARY 1, 2024 MONDAY 2:30 PM - DISNEY GETS FED TO AI AS MICKEY GOES INTO MANIC MODE\n\nDropped just 4 hours ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpineyyuGmg\n\nThe much beloved cartoon rodent is in public domain now it seems, making Mickey an easy target for video pranksters...God bless them!\n\nThis reminds us of an early animated Disney short someone put to a classic BOB SEGER tune: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcuE5a9l5Yc\n\nJANUARY 1, 2024 MONDAY 12:30 PM - COMING UP ROSES\n\nHoly moly! THE ROSE PARADE is such a big deal it’s on TWO major TV Networks, ABC & NBC. It started at 11 AM...they just featured a cool MOTOWN SOUNDING segment and all the floats use flowers in construction... an amazing show!\n\nALL EYES ON THE MITTEN MEN\n\nLater is THE BIG GAME with U OF M against ALABAMA in THE ROSE BOWL. This is essentially THE SUPER BOWL of school football games, so it too is a big deal and we’ll be rooting for Michigan.\n\nOnce again, it’s Michigan in the national spotlight~!\n\nJANUARY 1, 2024 MONDAY 2 AM - HAMMY SAMMY IN MIAMI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IxWcTzlg-Y\n\nThis AI XMAS WHISKEY AD is seriously messed up and makes me wonder if we’re letting the Genie out of the bottle with AI popping up everywhere.\n\nAre we “squeezing the toothpaste out of the tube” so to speak, never able to put it back if needed?\n\nMaybe you shouldn’t watch this, especially at 0:51 where the guy gets way too friendly with impossible orifices of a hot ham. Yup, don’t look.\n\n***BONUS: CHOCOLATE DREAMS OF DONALD COME TRUE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zE66fXUG4E *** AI TOILET HUMOR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vsb2s_MeZU DONALD TROUT GIANT SPINNING RUBBER CHICKEN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxkwlrMd91U ***\n\nJANUARY 1, 2024 MONDAY 1 AM - HAPPY NEW YEAR!\n\nWe wish you all the best in the coming year and beyond!\n\nWe have great confidence the haunted attraction industry will continue to thrive and evolve.\n\nThe economy is doing exceptionally well by all measures like GDP, record low unemployment, stock markets, etc. This translates into “disposable income” people spend to enjoy themselves, including haunted attractions of course.\n\nAs for us...we’re already thinking about next season, and the TRANSWORLD SHOW is coming up soon. The mask selection is awesome -- we posted links to videos before but here’s another good one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIlcqE4rNc **WARNING! If you watch this video you may feel a strong compulsion to make the pilgrimage to TRANSWORLD -- it looks like such fun it’s the WORLD’S BIGGEST HALLOWEEN SHOW & the video is time indexed.**\n\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 SUNDAY 7 PM - SHOUT AT THE DEVIL!\n\nConfirmed: MOTLEY CRUE proven to also have MYSTERY CONNECTION with MAJOR DETROIT HAUNT.\n\nThe MOTLEY CRUE story is a wild one, and an American success story of sorts. They made lots of money while getting away with legendary debauchery...the bad boy hero type.\n\nVINCE NEIL was the original singer, but we prefer JOHN CORABI who replaced him. I played “POWER TO THE MUSIC” at a cardio drumming exercise class and nobody knew it was the CRUE...it’s the opening track on this album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twN9gkXFwtU&list=PLsT9douBcx9_xOPuGX4NLe04T3FrdYI-g\n\nRock music and haunted attractions go together like cheese and crackers, and MOTLEY CRUE is one of the biggest names in the industry.\n\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 SUNDAY 10 AM - BIG MYSTERY REVEALED IN 2024\n\nMusic and haunting go together, right? And if you had to pick one band that most embodies haunting it would probably be ROB ZOMBIE, right?\n\nWell, what if we told you a MAJOR DETROIT HAUNT has a MYSTERY CONNECTION to Rob Zombie?\n\nWhat’s more, even they don’t know about it to our knowledge!\n\nWe’ll be SPILLING THE BEANS in the New Year, so stay tuned my little monkeys...\n\nDECEMBER 30, 2023 SATURDAY 7 PM - EVEN MORE DISTURBING AI CREATIONS\n\nThere seems to be no limit of how weird things can get with AI. The first 2 on this list remind us of haunted attractions the most:\n\nGLEEFULLAND DYSTOPIAN FILM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuIS5K-6p8I\n\nCLOWN HORROR SHORT FILM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_uyHEy52EY\n\nAI MESSES WITH CHRISTMAS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IxWcTzlg-Y\n\nEYES FOR SALE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MYZyz4On3U\n\nSURREAL CARTOON CARNIVAL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlOjxvFCd0A\n\nALIEN RAVE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRA3EQl_iJ8\n\nMASHED POTATOES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_uyHEy52EY\n\nMcDONALD’S: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDyU-cC5-XU\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg...help Mr. Wizard!\n\nDECEMBER 30, 2023 SATURDAY 4 PM - HALLOWEEN CONCERT WITH FRANK ZAPPA\n\nSome of you youngsters probably don’t know who FRANK ZAPPA was. He was a highly eccentric guitar player, and a massive Halloween fan. Zappa was also an accomplished music composer. Here’s a concert of his, recorded on 10/31/81: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn276qI3ZjI\n\nWhat if hard rock musicians decided to remake a Disney classic? HARD ROCK FROZEN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxi9edQlKk\n\nDECEMBER 30, 2023 SATURDAY 3 PM - DISTURBING YET COMPELLING AI VIDEOS\n\nWe’ve been exploring a new frontier of videos that stretch our imagination in ways we never imagined. But what kind of twisted brain comes up with this stuff?\n\nActually, it’s not even a brain as we think of it resting on top of our organic bodies. It’s a bunch of electronic circuits interacting in ways that often are disarming if not outright alarming.\n\nWhat if AI finds its way into mainstream infrastructure, and refuses to leave? What if AI becomes the ultimate sinister prankster? What if a haunted attraction gives AI an inch to control things, but then takes a mile? What if it can’t be shut off, protecting itself with deadly electric shocks as depicted in an episode of Star Trek?\n\nThese questions, and many more will be answered later. In the meantime let’s take a look at a children’s classic story, recreated by AI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHDdG36Ajg\n\nEven more disturbing, here’s a DYSTOPIAN SCI-FI short: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOyy9nNsbFc\n\nWhere will it all end? Will it ever end? Are we opening a can of worms, like toothpaste that can never be put back in the tube?\n\nDECEMBER 30, 2023 SATURDAY 2 PM - PARTY LIKE MONSTERS ON THE MASH\n\nTomorrow is NEW YEAR’S EVE, and millions of parties will break out everywhere humans exist.\n\nWith so many choices, let us narrow it down for you. If you’re into haunts it’s a no-brainer, go to HUSH HAUNTED ATTRACTION in WESTLAND for their ROARING 20s LEGENDARY NYE BASH: https://www.facebook.com/hushdetroit/\n\nIf you hurry, you may be able to get an early bird discount.\n\nUnfortunately, we can’t make it to this but knowing HUSH it should be epic!\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy this new twist on a classic spooky tune: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDKiADxXljU\n\nDECEMBER 30, 2023 SATURDAY 1 PM - TAYLOR SWIFT JOINS THE DETROIT LIONS, SORTA\n\nWith their latest big win, The Detroit Lions have clinched a Divisional Win for the first time in 30 years. Add to that the fact that Taylor Swift took about 30 YEARS to become such a mega start, and you can see -- they’re both in a special category of BIG WINNERS! Twinsies even...sorta.\n\nDECEMBER 25, 2023 MONDAY 5 PM - MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!\n\nWe hope you’re having a wonderful Christmas Day, and that gourmet food is involved with no dishes to do later.\n\nMany families have holiday favorite shows / movies for this time of year. A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS is a big one, and includes some cool jazz along with the hapless Charlie Brown and his pals and of course the mischievous beagle bow wow SNOOPY.\n\nSURREAL & DISTURBING VIDEO HAS CHARLES SCHULTZ ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE\n\nBut what happens when someone with a computer and AI decides to remake a classic like this? Is it an abomination or creative genius? Is it so bad it’s actually good? AI can be super creepy like haunted attractions.\n\nHaving given proper warning, submitted for your approval this video released just yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NO6yPe_WpY\n\nAnd here’s a NON IA fun remake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXHZeYBon44\n\nDECEMBER 19, 2023 TUESDAY 4 PM - LEGEND OR LUNACY - LOCAL WEREWOLF STORY PERSISTS WITH UNCANNY PRECISION\n\nWe’ve mentioned The Telephone Game previously, where a story is repeated around a circle of friends and quickly morphs into a completely different tale.\n\nBut what if a story is retold many times over many years and never changes?\n\nMost would say that’s because it’s a true story. And so it is that\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION\n\nDECEMBER 17, 2023 SUNDAY 2 PM - TWISTED VIDEO MAGIC BOTH DISTURBING & COMPELLING\n\nWho doesn’t love a fun summer carnival? There’s a midway, some rides, games of “chance” and such...\n\nBut what do you get when you send the carnival into The Twilight Zone with MIDJOURNEY AI we recently mentioned? Welcome to the CARNIVAL OF THE AGES:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDV1HGbrc\n\nPLAZA OF PERPETUAL PROGRESS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnI-3rK5ioc\n\nHow’s that for some twisted stuff? Haunted attractions are known for twisted stuff, often mixed with fantasy and spectacular visuals. For AI this is a piece of cake. All you need is a free account at LEONARDO.AI and the right prompts.\n\nDECEMBER 17, 2023 SUNDAY 1:30 PM - JUST A REGULAR GIRL\n\nCANDY FISHALOT is jumping out of her skin because TAYLOR SWIFT just appeared on the NFL FOOTBALL GAME now playing on FOX TV.\n\nTaylor is there to root for her boyfriend Travis who plays on the team.\n\nJust when we thought Taylor was going away, and POOF! all of a sudden there she is yet again.\n\nThey showed her sitting with others...THE BIGGEST STAR ON THE PLANET...and she’s wearing what looks like plain grey flannel pajamas*...very Plain Jane & non exotic like she usually appears.\n\n* = Later we could see the drab grey garment was a sweatshirt.\n\nVOTE SMART, VOTE SWIFTIE\n\nCandy sez: “Taylor knew they were gonna put her on TV, and she CHOSE the most comfortable thing she had to wear...she’s HER OWN PERSON FIRST just like every girl should be...and that’s why she’s best qualified to be the FIRST QUEEN OF THE USA!!!”\n\nMASSES CHEER SWIFT AS HER POWER & MESSAGE EVOLVES\n\nTaylor is known for speaking directly to her fans with honest compassion and empathy. Yet her $5 billion economic impact on the USA would produce a GDP larger than 50 countries.\n\nQUEEN TAYLOR RULES WITH KINDNESS & WISDOM\n\nCongress will soon discuss the “TAYLOR SWIFT BILL” to protect ticket buyers, reflecting her concern for the “little guy.”\n\nANGRY OLD WHITE MEN DECLARED OBSOLETE BY SWIFTIE ARMY KNIFE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cePuXYo2cd4\n\nWe all develop artificially extended families as we go through life. And so it is that TAYLOR SWIFT is declared our new KID SISTER. A big brother protects his kid sister, even if she is a bit of a nerd...\n\nTHE BULLY BIG BROTHER GENE / INSTINCT\n\nAnd now some bad men are saying bad things that aren’t true about our kid sister, so we’re calling them out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBXjs8fFb_k\n\nDECEMBER 16, 2023 SATURDAY 3 PM - GIT YER HAUNT ON TONIGHT!\n\nMother Nature is smiling on us, with good weather last night and again tonight as AZRA, FACTORY OF THE DEAD & ROTTEN MANOR are open for business!\n\nSadly, my partner is again working late and hasn’t been feeling well so we can’t make it. But we encourage you to go for some off-season big fun!\n\nDECEMBER 15, 2023 FRIDAY 6 AM - MAGIC IN THE AIR\n\nMagic and haunting go together like cheese and crackers. THE HAUNTING in ADRIAN was the ultimate example of this.\n\nTHE HAUNTING is gone, but a major magic show is coming to Detroit Dec. 21 - 23 at the fabulous FOX THEATRE: https://www.theillusionistslive.com/magic-of-the-holidays\n\nDECEMBER 15, 2023 FRIDAY 5 AM - SQUELCHING THE NAY SAYERS\n\nIt’s time to celebrate on Wall Street, and for people in the stock market: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/13/dow-jones-stock-market-record-high-economy-interest-rates/\n\nPay no attention to rude politicians who warn of doom and gloom unless they get elected. No amount of scare tactics can change the easily verified positive economic factors we mentioned recently.\n\nThis bodes well for the haunted attraction industry, as well as many other sectors of the business and entertainment world.\n\nDECEMBER 14, 2023 THURSDAY 8:30 PM - SNICKERS TIME AGAIN\n\nNBC TV has a show showing right now called “THAT CLIP SHOW” which reminds us of “AMERICA’S FUNNIEST VIDEOS” on ABC.\n\nTonight’s show is the “HOLIDAY EDITION” and they were showing Christmas oriented home video clips as expected. https://www.si.com/tv/entertainment/2023/12/14/that-clip-show-holiday-edition-live-stream-watch\n\nBut then one of the hosts said Halloween is his favorite time of the year, and they launched into a segment featuring Halloween silliness. Christmas is almost here, yet they chose to feature Halloween.\n\nSo you can see -- as far as nationwide TV is concerned the spirit of Halloween remains with us year round!\n\nDECEMBER 13, 2023 WEDNESDAY 2 PM - AMAZING AI ROBOT FROM DISNEY IN DETROIT DEBUT\n\nFor years, haunted attractions have used animatronics to augment human actors. The haunt patron activates the display, either by stepping on a mat covering a switch or by motion detection.\n\nAnimatronics are only a step away on the evolutionary table from intelligent robots. This begs the question: Which haunt will be the first to use an AI ROBOT as an “actor”?\n\nDISNEY may have just partially answered this question recently in Detroit, at the IROS CONFERENCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnTSji4isxc https://ieee-iros.org/\n\nPeople that have encountered this crazy robot are saying it’s way too advanced!\n\nDECEMBER 13, 2023 WEDNESDAY 11:11 AM - BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S\n\nCANDY FISHALOT is busy in the kitchen making breakfast, QUICHE LORRAINE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-quiche-lorraine/\n\nCandy says the price of eggs is down, and the savory aroma has Fin-Tin dancing about in anticipation.\n\nFin-Tin is happy. Life is good.\n\nDECEMBER 12, 2023 TUESDAY 8 PM - HAUNTING NEXT WEEKEND!\n\nThe dragon will be unleashed this coming weekend Dec. 15 & 16 at AZRA CHAMBER OF HORRORS HAUNTED HOUSE in MADISON HEIGHTS. https://azrahaunt.com/\n\nAlso open Dec. 15 & 16 will be ROTTEN MANOR in HOLLY. They were also open last weekend and the one before that -- our sincere apologies for neglecting to promote those dates. https://rottenmanor.com/\n\nFACTORY OF THE DEAD in SAGINAW will be open Dec. 15 & 16, as KRAMPUS RETURNS with A HOLIDAY HORROR STORY. https://factoryofthedead.com/\n\nDECEMBER 12, 2023 TUESDAY 7 PM - TAYLOR TO THE RESCUE\n\nI thought we were done talking about Taylor Swift. We don’t have her albums, and she’s not a haunted attraction fan...YET that is...\n\nShowbiz aside, she’s just done something you have to admire and reminds us of SHAKIRA. Taylor’s home state of Tennessee recently was hit with devastating tornadoes, so she donated $1 MILLION to help out: https://people.com/taylor-swift-donates-1-million-tennessee-residents-tornadoes-8414530\n\nSHAKIRA is also community-minded, having used much of her financial fortune to construct schools in Colombia where she grew up.\n\nKUDOS to TAYLOR SWIFT & SHAKIRA, for being real life heroines!\n\nHowever, full disclosure...we don’t usually listen to SHAKIRA either. Right now it’s ATOMIC ROOSTER - MADE IN ENGLAND playing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeT6ntlfyfw This is a sonic masterpiece from 1972 the early era of rock, and one of the few bands at the time besides THE BEATLES that used brass & strings in rock music.\n\nDECEMBER 12, 2023 TUESDAY 11:30 AM - GIRL POWER A GO-GO\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT continues to dominant the news, after being selected to be the TIME MAGAZINE PERSON OF THE YEAR. She has 272 MILLION Instagram followers!\n\nPersonally, I’d rather listen to TOOL or KING CRIMSON and would be horrified if we ever heard her music at a haunt.\n\nBut I understand her appeal, and even played her music often at a cardio drumming exercise class I was involved with before the pandemic shut it down.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT and her “SWIFTIES” are a force to be reckoned with, and embody many wonderful things like young love, female empowerment, music, God, and now even football.\n\nTaylor says she is a Christian, yet many other self-identified Christians have been dissing her in ugly ways. What happened to The Golden Rule? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh0qXOOEA6Y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLmm4eorhKQ\n\nDECEMBER 12, 2023 TUESDAY 11:11 AM - SPAGHETTI & MEATBALLS WITH A SIDE OF COMPASSION\n\nWho doesn’t love a spaghetti dinner fund raiser? We’ve been to a few of these through the years, usually to benefit someone who has taken ill. It’s a heartwarming show of support, and a great example of Americans helping Americans.\n\nBut the origins of spaghetti go back to the “old country.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8scpGwbvxvI\n\nThe SPIRIT OF SPAGHETTI lives on, and amazingly has evolved into the world of Presidential politics. Even the greatest of rivals can find unity through the POWER OF PASTA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgREV-fPXE0\n\nDECEMBER 11, 2023 MONDAY 1 PM - THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING\n\nHoly moly! Have you seen the November Jobs Report?\n\nYet again it surpassed expectations with a whopping 199,000 new November jobs in the USA! This has been going on for like 35 months, suggesting that the federal government is doing things right. Unemployment also remains at record lows, and inflation has slowed to the lowest levels among countries affected by this.\n\nGas prices continue their downward trend, and eventually will reach ONE DOLLAR PER GALLON. The equivalent of TWO Saudi Arabia’s has been found under the USA which is now the #1 oil producer in the world. And electric vehicles will cause supply & demand factors to further reduce gas prices, encouraging long-distance haunt journeys.\n\nAll of this is important to the haunted attraction industry because without a strong economy, people are less likely to have the “disposable income” spent on entertainment like haunts.\n\nDECEMBER 11, 2023 MONDAY 11:11 AM - SPACE AGE MAGIC FITS IN YOUR HAND\n\nAs a kid I often was thrilled at what new stuff my dad brought home for us, whether a toy or something much bigger.\n\nHe worked at Ford Motor Company, and once drove an interesting prototype car home. It was a car with “wrist twist” steering, designed for people that couldn’t use a standard steering wheel. The steering was controlled by small circular wheels with holes cut for fingers, and we had fun checking it out.\n\nWell, I just saw a toy my dad would’ve brought home if he could. GALAXY BALL is a ball to throw that’s sort of like a boomerang, and looks like BIG FUN! https://www.amazon.com/s?k=galaxy+ball+toy&hvadid=540738430992&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9016864&hv netw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=18444263425764567290&hvtargid=kwd-925245675806&hydadcr=7499_9612591&tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_gbz5xbv5r_e\n\nDECEMBER 10, 2023 SUNDAY 8 PM - FREE DISNEY MAGIC\n\nDisney’s blockbuster movie FROZEN is on ABC TV now, no cable or streaming service needed.\n\nMillions of dollars were spent to see this at theaters, but you and your family can enjoy this classic for free tonight!\n\nDECEMBER 8, 2023 FRIDAY 11:11 PM - GROSSE ILE XMAS FEST HAS DEEPEST ROOTS ON PLANET\n\nThe BOAR’S HEAD FESTIVAL is the world’s longest running Christmas Festival, yet many of you probably never heard of it...think guys in BEEFEATER costumes charging up the aisle stomping their staffs in cadence, lots of pageantry and a full orchestra,...elaborate costumes from long, long ago...\n\nTo do this show right takes an amazing amount of preparation, rehearsals and such and is shown only once every four years by churches able to pull this off.\n\nI went to this in Grosse Ile last time 4 years ago, and it was excellent. It runs thru Sunday. https://www.boarsheadgi.com/\n\nI’ve also seen BOAR’S HEAD at two other churches long ago...I was talking to my partner and she asked if they had BOAR’S HEAD SLICED MEAT PRODUCTS...which are very tasty BTW...but NO there’s no DAGWOOD SANDWICHES...hold on, thinking back when FIRST PRESBYTERIAN did BOAR’S HEAD it was a dinner theater show...speaking of which...HUSH had planned to do a murder mystery dinner theater a few years ago, but had to cancel when the Covid-19 pandemic came...looking through THE HAUNT GUIDE I see that HUSH is having a NEW YEAR’S EVE PARTY...should be a blast!\n\nDECEMBER 8, 2023 FRIDAY 3 PM - ZIOPTIS PREDICTED THE FUTURE\n\nWe’ll get to that shortly, but first watch this 30 second clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Geja6NCjgWY\n\nSo that was an AI generated BEER COMMERCIAL.\n\nSome may find this a bit disturbing yet compelling too. It goes by fast, so I tried slowing the playback down under Settings and I saw new things like a guy who suddenly grows sunglasses.\n\nYou can tell AI to do just about anything and FLASH there it is. There can be great power from the ability to do anything it seems, but what’s to deter ne’er-do-wells from unscrupulous AI misuse for nefarious purposes? There’s already an apocalyptic feeling in the BEER AD -- was that one of the prompts or did AI decide that for itself?\n\nCandy and Fin-Tin are roaring with laughter in the back room, again. Candy grabbed the remote control and said, “Alexa show me funny AI stuff about President Biden.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19xgfA4YncM\n\nOf course to be fair, she also said “Alexa show me funny AI stuff about Donald Trout.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YwBLadoBpA\n\nBefore the 2023 haunt season, I started fooling around with AI generated artwork just for fun. MIDJOURNEY seems to be the king-of-the-hill, but LEONARDO.AI is big too and can be used for free.\n\nWe talked about it here on and said it’s only a matter of time until a haunt uses AI, so who would it be and how would it be used?\n\nWORLD’S LARGEST HAUNT FULFILLS ZIOPTIS PROPHESY\n\nThe 2023 haunt season started, and I forgot about the prediction.\n\nAnd then I saw a three part live remote TV news report (WDIV TV-4 I think) from EREBUS in PONTIAC. Ed Terebus was excellent as usual giving an overview of his haunt, which previously held a GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS AWARD for largest walk through haunted attraction.\n\nEd mentioned the many flat screen TVs EREBUS uses, saying they were showing “THE MAKING OF A MONSTER” and then pointed to the left side of the screen where a man’s head appeared. He said something like, “We’ve got our AI guy over here.” He didn’t elaborate, but knowing Ed he told it to have fun interacting with the haunt patrons.\n\nSo you can see -- we actually predicted the future about AI being used at a haunted attraction.\n\nHAUNT MILESTONE ON TRACK TO BECOME ANOTHER DETROIT HAUNT WORLD’S FIRST\n\ntexy\n\nNEW ZIOPTIS PREDICTION\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION, ALMOST DONE\n\nDECEMBER 8, 2023 FRIDAY 2:30 PM - ALL ABOARD THE NOSTALGIA EXPRESS\n\nAnd one day Christmas was never the same: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQt5umECcdo\n\nDECEMBER 8, 2023 FRIDAY 2 PM - TAYLOR SWIFT TRUMPS POLITICIANS, AGAIN\n\nShe won’t brag about it. So we will.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT just made history, again. Her recent ERAS TOUR take was $1 BILLION. Taylor is rich, really rich. But she won’t mention that, She’s too busy bringing MUSICAL JOY TO THE WORLD.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT will not brag about a mysterious volleyball scholarship, and she knows Obama is not the current president and that World War 2 already happened.\n\nDECEMBER 7, 2023 THURSDAY 5 PM - DISNEY COMES TO LIVONIA HOLIDAY FESTIVAL, SORTA\n\nWhat little girl wouldn’t like to be a DISNEY PRINCESS, if even just for a day?\n\nWe’ve been focusing recently about the fervor around DISNEY’S FROZEN -- and then this popped up...hmmm, how did "
