        "text": "7 more great quotes from local bands\n\nLocal musicians make fascinating interviews. Each week, I chat with a number of area bands and artists and always step away learning something new.\n\nLast week, I featured a collection of memorable quotes from local musicians. This week, I’m finishing up the series with seven more recent quotes from local bands and musicians. Read on, and get inspired!\n\n• Wade Royale of Eight Ball Grifter on the band’s reunion at Mac’s last year:\n\n“One of the coolest things is the response from everyone, as far as them still having an interest in coming out and seeing Eight Ball Grifter play. It’s an excuse to get together for a lot of people, and people are flying in from all over to go to the gigs. It’s going to be a good time.”\n\n• Todd E. Karinen of the Jackpine Snag on the band’s sound:\n\n“We came up with the title of ‘grungy doom blues’ because when we set out at the start of the band, we wanted to play some bluesy music, but it was also aimed to be a little heavier. We really like mixing those aspects together. We wanted this to be heavier. More doom. The grunge got added, because some of our friends said we almost had that element to us. I’ve always liked grunge, even though that was a made-up term by the media, but it came out when I was an impressionable kid and didn’t know any better.”\n\n• Isaac Vander Schuur of Lansing indie rock group the Hat Madder on how to book a proper tour:\n\n“Basically, step one is to wake up and call or email everyone you know. Step two is to repeat step one. The West Coast has been on the list for awhile. We have friends out there, and we just want to strengthen the West Coast and Midwest connection.”\n\n• Tom Taylor of Lansing rock band the dt’s on the band’s history:\n\n“We had more ups than downs. We had great times on the road. We played all the legendary clubs, like The Whiskey, The Roxy and CBGB’s (R.I.P.) and theaters on both coasts. We did a video on the roof of WDIV in Detroit. That was odd, having a helicopter right above you as your music is being cranked, and the guitar player has a fresh mohawk and is kicking amps over.”\n\n• Johnny Aimcrier of Grand Ledge-based Americana band the Aimcriers on loving vinyl:\n\n“One reason why we wanted to release ‘Solid State World’ on vinyl was because vinyl is how we discovered music growing up. Sure, the radio played a big part, but spending your own money on a record was a big deal in hearing songs over and over, where multi-layered instruments could really be appreciated.”\n\n• Pete Mowry of East Lansing alternative Americana duo Westrin & Mowry:\n\n“Ten years is a long time to develop as an artist. We used to play in coffee houses and bars around the country, so we’ve always liked to incorporate a live feeling into our music. Traveling helps you pick up little things here and there. We released our first album when I was 22, and that’s very young. When I listen to that album I can hear the youth in my playing. This album, I think, we wanted to get to the deeper stuff that has been floating around in our writing. When we first started talking about how we wanted to record it I remember always saying “I want people to be able to put it on and immediately feel what we were feeling.” It’s a tough thing to do because production can go so many ways, but here I think the most important aspect we wanted to shoot for was to tell the truth, both in lyrics and in the instrumentation.”\n\n• Lansing Christian hip-hop performer Shanell Henry, formerly known as Mizz Reality, on her new album, “By Design”:\n\n“A lot of the content deals with the realities of and some of the struggles we face with identity and purpose. The designer of a product is the one who knows a product best. A manufacturer knows why and how it’s made, how to put it together and how it’s supposed to work. The same principles apply to our lives as mankind. Our Creator knows us best. We were all created by the greatest designer in life. His plan for our being is full of peace and hope. There is so much power in just being who and what He created.”"
