        "text": "Biography\n\nTerry Connors is a trial lawyer. His awards, honors and verdicts prove it. Whether it is a catastrophic personal injury case that merits a multi-million dollar award, (Terry has several record verdicts and settlements for the Western New York Region) or a high profile criminal case that needs his touch, (his last three Federal trials — all highly publicized — resulted in exoneration of his clients), Terry is up to the challenge. It might even be a “bet the company” litigation that pits him against famed lawyers like Johnnie Cochrane, Terry more than holds his own. These are just some of the reasons Terry was ranked by Super Lawyers® as the top lawyer in Upstate New York for seven straight years. City & State Magazine named Terry to the Top 50 Lawyers in the entire State of New York. He has been named to the Western New York Power 100, the Buffalo Business First Power 250, and the NY Daily Record Power 50. Terry has also been selected to receive the American Inns of Court Award for Professionalism for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nInvitation only, pre-eminent trial lawyer organizations have elected Terry to Fellowship in both the American College of Trial Lawyers and the International Academy of Trial Lawyers. The Best Lawyers in America® has designated him in nine separate categories and selected him as Lawyer of the Year seven times: Personal Injury, twice in White Collar and Non-White Collar, twice in Bet-the-Company litigation and twice in Legal Malpractice. That is why lawyers, law firms and even Judges regularly seek his representation, making Terry a true “lawyer’s lawyer.”\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTerry was an All-City high school basketball player while growing up in New York, even competing against Lew Alcindor, more famously known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar during his Hall of Fame career with the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angels Lakers. Terry went on to co-captain the Canisius College Golden Griffins alongside, eventual three-term Buffalo Mayor, Anthony M.
