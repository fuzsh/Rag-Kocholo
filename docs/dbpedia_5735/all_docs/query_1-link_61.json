        "text": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\nThis analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\n\nResults of Operations Â­ 1998 Compared to 1997\n\nNet income in 1998 was $417.3 million, an increase of 48 percent over net income of $281.6 million in 1997. Basic and diluted earnings per share both rose 57 percent to $41.27 and $41.10, respectively, in 1998. The Company's 1998 net income includes $194.4 million from the disposition of the Company's 28 percent interest in Cowles Media Company, the sale of 14 small cable systems and the disposition of the Company's investment interest in Junglee, a facilitator of Internet commerce. The Company's 1997 net income includes $44.5 million from the sale of the Company's investment in Bear Island Paper Company, L.P., and Bear Island Timberlands Company, L.P., and the sale of the assets of its PASS regional cable sports network. Excluding these non-recurring gains, net income decreased 6 percent in 1998 and basic and diluted earnings per share remained essentially unchanged with fewer average shares outstanding.\n\nRevenues for 1998 totaled $2,110.4 million, an increase of 8 percent from $1,956.3 million in 1997. Advertising revenues increased 5 percent in 1998, and circulation and subscriber revenues increased 5 percent. Other revenues increased 33 percent over 1997. The newspaper and broadcast divisions generated most of the increase in advertising revenues. The increase in circulation and subscriber revenues is primarily due to a 15 percent increase in subscriber revenues at the cable division (arising mostly from cable system acquisitions in 1998 and 1997). Revenue growth at Kaplan Educational Centers (about two-thirds of which was from acquisitions) accounted for the increase in other revenues.\n\nOperating costs and expenses for the year increased 10 percent to $1,731.5 million, from $1,574.9 million in 1997. The cost and expense increase is primarily due to companies acquired in 1998 and 1997, increased spending for new media activities, a 10 percent increase in newsprint expense, and expenses arising from the expansion of the printing facilities of The Washington Post. These expense increases were partially offset by an increase in the Company's pension credit.\n\nOperating income decreased 1 percent to $378.9 million in 1998, from $381.4 million in 1997.\n\nDivision Results. In December 1998, the Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, \"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,\" which requires companies to report certain information about their operating segments. Upon implementing this new accounting standard, the Company changed the manner in which it reports operating segment results to reflect its corporate office expenses in the \"other businesses and corporate office\" segment. Previously, the Company had allocated its corporate office expenses to each of its operating segments. Prior period operating segment results have been adjusted to reflect this reporting change.\n\nNewspaper Division. At the newspaper division, 1998 included 53 weeks as compared to 52 weeks in 1997. Newspaper division revenues increased 4 percent to $846.8 million, from $812.9 million in 1997. Advertising revenues at the newspaper division rose 5 percent over the previous year. At The Washington Post, advertising revenues increased 4 percent as a result of higher rates and a slight increase in volume. Classified advertising revenues at The Washington Post increased 5 percent primarily due to higher rates and higher recruitment volume. Retail advertising revenues at The Post declined 3 percent primarily as a result of a 7.5 percent decline in inches. Other advertising revenues (including general and preprint) at The Post increased 11 percent; general advertising volume was essentially unchanged for 1998; however, preprint volume increased 6 percent.\n\nCirculation revenues for the newspaper division remained essentially unchanged from 1997, with the extra week in 1998 offsetting the effects of a 1.3 percent decline in daily and Sunday circulation at The Washington Post.\n\nNewspaper division operating margin in 1998 decreased to 19 percent, from 21 percent in 1997. The decrease in 1998 operating margin is primarily attributable to increased costs arising from the expansion of the printing facilities of The Washington Post and a 10 percent increase in newsprint costs. The 10 percent increase in newsprint costs is comprised of a 4 percent increase in newsprint consumed (driven primarily by expanded suburban community coverage at The Washington Post) and a 6 percent increase in newsprint prices.\n\nBroadcast Division. Revenues at the broadcast division rose 6 percent to $357.6 million in 1998, compared to $338.4 million in 1997. The increase in revenues is primarily attributable to 1998 political advertising and increased local advertising revenues.\n\nCompetitive market position remained strong for the Company's television stations. In the November 1998 Nielsen ratings book, WDIV (NBC affiliate in Detroit), WJXT (CBS affiliate in Jacksonville) and KSAT (ABC affiliate in San Antonio) continued to rank number one in audience share sign-on to sign-off, while WPLG (ABC affiliate in Miami) tied for first place among English-language stations in the Miami market. KPRC (NBC affiliate in Houston), although still ranked third in the market, has narrowed the gap significantly and now challenges its closest competitors by as little as two audience share points. WKMG (CBS affiliate in Orlando), which the broadcast division took over in September 1997, has remained in third place in Orlando while moving aggressively to build a strong news franchise.\n\nThe operating margin at the broadcast division was 48 percent in 1998 and 1997. Excluding amortization of goodwill and intangibles, the operating margin was 52 percent in 1998 and 1997.\n\nMagazine Division. Magazine division revenues, which beginning in 1997 also included the Company's business information unit, rose 2 percent to $399.5 million, from $389.9 million in 1997. The increase in revenue is attributable to revenue contributed by the business information trade periodicals acquired in December 1997, offset partially by a decline in revenue at Newsweek. Advertising revenues at Newsweek declined 7 percent primarily as the result of two fewer Newsweek domestic special issues in 1998 versus 1997 and softness in advertising at the international editions of Newsweek (particularly the Asian and Latin American editions). Total circulation revenue for the magazine division decreased 6 percent in 1998 due predominantly to the newsstand sales of two Newsweek domestic edition special issues in 1997, which were not recurring in 1998, as well as currency deflation at most of the international editions of Newsweek.\n\nOperating margin at the magazine division was 11 percent in both 1998 and 1997. The 2 percent increase in 1998 revenues combined with an increase in the pension credit at Newsweek were offset by normal expense growth and the amortization expense arising from the December 1997 acquisition of the business unit trade periodicals.\n\nCable Division. Revenues at the cable division increased 16 percent to $298.0 million in 1998, from $257.7 million in 1997. Basic, tier, pay and advertising revenue categories showed improvement over 1997. Increased subscribers in 1998, primarily from acquisitions, and higher rates accounted for most of the 15 percent increase in subscriber revenues. The number of basic subscribers at the end of the year increased to 733,000, from 637,300 at the end of 1997. During 1998, the cable division acquired cable systems serving approximately 115,400 subscribers and sold cable systems serving approximately 29,000 subscribers.\n\nOperating margin at the cable division was 22 percent in 1998, compared to 21 percent in 1997. Cable operating cash flow increased 21 percent to $126.5 million, from $104.7 million in 1997. Approximately 40 percent of the 1998 improvement in operating cash flow is attributable to the results of cable systems acquired in 1998 and 1997.\n\nOther Businesses and Corporate Office. In 1998, revenues from other businesses, including Kaplan Educational Centers, Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive, MLJ (sold in July 1998), Legi-Slate and PASS Sports (nine months of 1997), increased 32 percent to $208.4 million, from $157.4 million in 1997. The majority of the increase is attributable to continued growth at Kaplan Educational Centers. Kaplan's revenues increased 66 percent in 1998 (with acquisitions accounting for approximately two-thirds of the increase).\n\nOther businesses and the corporate office recorded an operating loss in 1998 of $66.9 million, compared to a loss of $52.3 million in 1997. The increase in operating loss is principally attributable to the Company's electronic media initiatives and, to a lesser extent, the start up costs associated with Kaplan's expansion of its Score elementary education business. Offsetting these losses were improved and continued profitability from Kaplan's core test preparation business, as well as operating income contributed by the various businesses acquired by Kaplan in 1998 and 1997.\n\nEquity in (Losses) Earnings of Affiliates. The Company's equity in losses of affiliates in 1998 was $5.1 million, compared with income of $10.0 million in 1997. The $15.1 million decline in affiliate earnings resulted from increased spending at new media joint ventures (principally Classified Ventures and CareerPath.com) and the absence of affiliate earnings that were provided in the prior year from the Company's investment interest in the Bear Island Partnerships (sold in November 1997) and Cowles Media Company (disposed of in March 1998).\n\nNon-Operating Items. In 1998, the Company incurred net interest expense of $10.4 million, compared to $2.2 million of net interest income in 1997. The average short-term borrowings outstanding in 1998 was $231.8 million, as compared to $10.7 million in average borrowings outstanding in 1997.\n\nOther income (expense), net, in 1998 was $304.7 million, compared to $69.5 million in 1997. For 1998, other income (expense), net, includes $309.7 million arising from the disposition of the Company's 28 percent interest in Cowles Media Company, the sale of 14 small cable systems and the disposition of the Company's interest in Junglee, a facilitator of Internet commerce. For 1997, other income (expense), net, includes $74.8 million in gains arising from the sale of the Bear Island partnerships and the sale of the assets of the Company's PASS regional cable sports network.\n\nIncome Taxes. The effective tax rate in 1998 was 37.5 percent, as compared to 39 percent in 1997. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is principally the result of the disposition of Cowles Media Company being subject to state income tax in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, and to a lesser extent, from a favorable IRS-approved income tax change in the fourth quarter of 1998.\n\nResults of Operations--1997 compared to 1996\n\nNet income in 1997 was $281.6 million, an increase of 28 percent over net income of $220.8 million in 1996. Basic and diluted earnings per share rose 31 and 30 percent to $26.23 and $26.15, respectively, in 1997. The Company's 1997 net income includes $28.5 million from the sale of the Company's investment in Bear Island Paper Company, L.P., and Bear Island Timberlands Company, L.P., as well as $16.0 million relating to the sale of the assets of its PASS regional cable sports network. Excluding these non-recurring gains, net income increased 7 percent in 1997 and basic and diluted earnings per share each increased 10 percent.\n\nRevenues for 1997 totaled $1,956.3 million, an increase of 6 percent from $1,853.4 million in 1996. Advertising revenues increased 5 percent in 1997, and circulation and subscriber revenues increased 6 percent. Other revenues increased 5 percent. Substantially all of the increase in advertising revenues was generated by the newspaper and magazine divisions. The increase in circulation and subscriber revenues is due to growth at the cable division and the increase in other revenues is attributable to higher tuition revenues at Kaplan partially offset by reduced fees for engineering services at MLJ.\n\nCosts and expenses for the year increased 4 percent to $1,574.9 million, from $1,516.3 million in 1996. In addition to the normal growth in the costs of operations, the cost and expense increase is attributable to companies acquired in 1997, expansion of Kaplan's business offerings, increased spending for new media activities offset partially by decreased newsprint and magazine paper costs, and other favorable cost experience at Newsweek.\n\nOperating income increased 13 percent to $381.4 million in 1997.\n\nNewspaper Division. Newspaper division revenues increased 6 percent to $812.9 million, from $763.9 million in 1996. Advertising revenues at the newspaper division rose 8 percent over the previous year. At The Washington Post, advertising revenues increased 8 percent as a result of strong volume increases and, to a lesser extent, higher rates. Classified revenues at The Washington Post increased 12 percent due to higher recruitment volume and associated rates. The Washington Post's retail revenues rose 4 percent due to higher rates and a 1 percent increase in volume. Other advertising revenues (including general and preprint) at The Washington Post increased 8 percent. General advertising and preprint volume each increased 8 percent over 1996.\n\nCirculation revenues for the newspaper division increased 1 percent in 1997 resulting mostly from rate increases enacted in the beginning of 1997 at The Washington Post. Average daily circulation at The Washington Post fell 1.5 percent, while Sunday circulation declined 1.3 percent.\n\nNewspaper division operating margin in 1997 increased to 21 percent from 16 percent in 1996. The increase in 1997 operating margin is primarily attributable to increased advertising revenues and lower newsprint expense (down 9 percent). Average newsprint prices paid by the newspaper division in 1997 declined about 14 percent from 1996, the positive effects of which were partially offset by a 4 percent increase in newsprint consumed.\n\nBroadcast Division. Revenues at the broadcast division rose 1 percent to $338.4 million over last year. An increase in advertising from a number of industry categories, including restaurants, utilities, banks and finance, as well as an overall revenue share increase, allowed the broadcast division to offset the approximate $30.0 million in non-recurring advertising revenues generated in 1996 from political and Olympics-related advertising. Network revenues were down slightly from 1996.\n\nCompetitive market position remained strong for the television stations. Four stations were ranked number one in the latest ratings period, sign-on to sign-off, in their markets; one station was ranked a strong number two; one station was ranked number three.\n\nThe operating margin at the broadcast division increased to 48 percent, from 47 percent in 1996. Excluding amortization of goodwill and intangibles, operating margins for 1997 and 1996 were 52 percent and 51 percent, respectively. The improvement in the 1997 operating margin is due to increased advertising revenues and benefits derived from 1997 expense control initiatives which, in total, outpaced higher expenses associated with the new station, WCPX (renamed WKMG).\n\nMagazine Division. Magazine division revenues, which beginning in 1997 also included the Company's business information unit, rose 3 percent to $389.9 million due primarily to increased advertising revenues at the Newsweek domestic edition. The Newsweek domestic advertising revenues increase over the prior year resulted from a 6 percent increase in domestic advertising pages sold in 1997 versus 1996. Total circulation revenues for the magazine division increased 1 percent in 1997.\n\nOperating margin of the magazine division increased to 11 percent in 1997, from 7 percent in 1996. The increase in operating margin is primarily attributable to the operating results of Newsweek, including the higher sales of domestic advertising pages, reduced magazine paper costs, realized savings from prior year outsourcing initiatives, and other favorable cost experience.\n\nCable Division. Revenues at the cable division increased 12 percent to $257.7 million in 1997. Basic and tier, pay, and advertising revenue categories showed improvement over 1996. Increased subscribers in 1997 accounted for the majority of the total increase in revenues. The number of basic subscribers increased 7 percent to 637,300. About 37,000 subscribers were added in 1997 as a result of cable system acquisitions and exchanges and the remainder by internal growth.\n\nCable operating cash flow increased 4 percent to $104.7 million, from $100.2 million in 1996. Operating margin at the cable division was 21 percent in 1997 compared to 25 percent in 1996, reflecting the effects of increased depreciation and amortization in 1997 from recent cable system acquisitions and capital improvements.\n\nOther Businesses and Corporate Office. In 1997, revenues from other businesses, including Kaplan, MLJ, Legi-Slate, Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive, and PASS Sports (nine months of 1997), increased 7 percent over the prior year to $157.4 million. The majority of the increase in other businesses revenues is attributable to Kaplan, where revenues increased 21 percent. Student enrollments at Kaplan increased 3 percent in 1997. Partially offsetting the revenue increase generated by Kaplan was a decrease in engineering consulting revenues at MLJ.\n\nOther businesses and the corporate office recorded an operating loss in 1997 of $52.3 million, compared to a loss of $30.6 million in 1996. The 1997 operating loss increase is directly attributable to the Company's spending on electronic media initiatives, the 1997 decline in MLJ's revenues, and, to a lesser extent, the start-up costs associated with Kaplan's significant expansion of its Score elementary education business. Offsetting these losses was improved and continued profitability from Kaplan's core test preparation business.\n\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliates. The Company's equity in earnings of affiliates for 1997 declined to $10.0 million, from $19.7 million in 1996, reflecting the effect of lower earnings at the Company's affiliated newsprint mills for the majority of 1997 compared to 1996. The decline in earnings at the affiliated newsprint mills is due to lower average newsprint prices charged by the mills in 1997 versus 1996.\n\nNon-Operating Items. Interest income, net of interest expense, was $2.2 million, compared to $3.8 million in 1996. Increased spending in 1997 for acquisitions, capital expenditures, and stock repurchases resulted in less invested cash in 1997 versus 1996, causing a decline in interest income. Other income (expense), net in 1997 was $69.5 million, compared with an expense of $0.5 million in 1996. The increase in other income is attributable to the 1997 gains arising from the Company's sale of its investment in Bear Island Paper Company, L.P., and Bear Island Timberlands Company, L.P., as well as the sale of the assets of the Company's PASS regional cable sports network.\n\nIncome Taxes. The effective tax rate in both 1997 and 1996 was approximately 39 percent.\n\nFinancial Condition:\n\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n\nAcquisitions. During 1998, the Company acquired various businesses for about $320.6 million, which included, among others, $209.0 million for cable systems serving approximately 115,400 subscribers and $100.4 million for various educational, training and career services companies to expand Kaplan's business offerings.\n\nDuring 1997, the Company acquired various businesses for about $118.9 million. These acquisitions included, among others, $23.9 million for cable systems serving approximately 16,000 subscribers and $84.5 million for the publishing rights to two computer services industry periodicals and the rights to conduct two computer industry trade shows.\n\nIn 1996, the Company spent approximately $147.5 million on business acquisitions. The 1996 acquisitions included, among others, $129.0 million (including $11.9 million of the Company's Series A redeemable preferred stock) for cable systems serving about 66,000 subscribers.\n\nExchanges. During 1997, the Company exchanged the assets of certain cable systems with Tele-Communications, Inc., resulting in an increase of about 21,000 subscribers for the Company. The Company also completed, in 1997, a transaction with Meredith Corporation whereby the Company exchanged the assets of WFSB-TV, the CBS affiliate in Hartford, Connecticut, and $60.0 million in cash for the assets of WCPX-TV (renamed WKMG), the CBS affiliate in Orlando, Florida.\n\nDispositions. In March 1998, the Company received $330.5 million in cash and 730,525 shares of McClatchy Newspapers, Inc. Class A common stock as a result of the merger of Cowles and McClatchy. The market value of the McClatchy stock received was $21.6 million, based upon publicly quoted market prices. During the last three quarters of 1998, the Company sold 464,700 shares of the McClatchy stock (64 percent of the total shares received) for $15.4 million.\n\nIn July 1998, the Company completed the sale of 14 small cable systems in Texas, Missouri and Kansas serving approximately 29,000 subscribers for $41.9 million. In August 1998, the Company received 202,961 shares of Amazon.com common stock as a result of the merger of Amazon.com and Junglee Corporation. At the time of the merger transaction, the Company owned a minority investment interest in Junglee Corporation, a facilitator of Internet commerce. The market value of the Amazon.com stock received was $25.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company sold 178,459 shares of the Amazon.com common stock (88 percent of the total shares received) for $22.8 million.\n\nIn November 1997, the Company sold its 35 percent interest in Bear Island Paper Company, L.P., and Bear Island Timberlands Company, L.P., for approximately $92.8 million. In September 1997, the Company sold the assets of its PASS regional cable sports network for $27.4 million.\n\nCapital Expenditures. During 1998, the Company's capital expenditures totaled $244.2 million, the majority of which related to the replacement of the printing facilities at The Washington Post and plant upgrades at the Company's cable subsidiary. The Company estimates that in 1999 it will spend approximately $150.0 million for property and equipment, primarily for various projects at the newspaper and cable divisions.\n\nInvestments in Marketable Equity Securities. During the third and fourth quarters of 1998, the Company acquired 747,100 shares of General Re Corporation (\"General Re\") common stock and 20 shares of Class A Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (\"Berkshire\") common stock from the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $165.0 million. On January 26, 1999, the 747,100 shares of General Re common stock converted to 2,614 and 25 shares of Berkshire Class A and Class B common stock, respectively, pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement between Berkshire and General Re. It is the Company's present intention to hold the Berkshire common stock long-term.\n\nThe Company's investment in marketable equity securities at January 3, 1999 also includes common stock investments in various publicly traded companies, including shares of Amazon.com, America Online, and Ticketmaster-Citysearch Online. The Company obtained its ownership of these common stock investments as a result of merger or acquisition transactions in which these companies merged or acquired various small Internet related companies in which the Company held minor investments.\n\nAt January 3, 1999, the fair value of the Company's investments in marketable equity securities was $256.1 million, of which $184.4 million consists of the Company's Berkshire/General Re common stock investment.\n\nCommon Stock Repurchases and Dividend Rate. During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company repurchased 41,033, 846,290 and 103,642 shares, respectively, of its Class B common stock at a cost of $20.5 million, $368.6 million and $32.3 million, respectively. The annual dividend rate for 1999 was increased to $5.20 per share, from $5.00 per share in 1998, $4.80 per share in 1997 and $4.60 per share in 1996.\n\nLiquidity. At January 3, 1999, the Company had $15.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. In March 1998, the Company replaced its $300.0 million revolving credit facility with a $500.0 million revolving credit facility to provide for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper. At January 3, 1999, the Company had $453.4 million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.4 percent. On February 15, 1999, the Company issued $400.0 million of 5.5 percent, 10-year notes, netting approximately $395.0 million in proceeds after discount and fees. The Company intends to utilize the $395.0 million in proceeds to repay an equal amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\n\nThe Company expects to fund its estimated capital needs primarily through internally generated funds, and, to a lesser extent, commercial paper borrowings. In management's opinion, the Company will have ample liquidity to meet its various cash needs in 1999.\n\nYear 2000. The Company's assessment, remediation, testing and contingency planning efforts surrounding Year 2000 readiness are proceeding as planned with completion of all project phases projected for late Fall of 1999. To date, the assessment of internal systems and equipment has been completed and the Company has made substantial progress in completing the remediation, testing and contingency planning phases of its Year 2000 readiness project.\n\nMost of the Company's significant internal systems and equipment, including equipment with embedded controls, have been determined to be Year 2000 compliant. Certain critical internal systems, however, have been identified as incapable of processing transactions beyond the Year 2000 the most significant of which include some of the revenue related business systems at The Washington Post and Newsweek. At Newsweek, the non-compliant systems have since been repaired and testing of such remediation is currently underway. For the non-compliant systems at The Washington Post, which principally include the advertising and circulation billing systems, the remediation efforts are continuing and are presently expected to be completed and tested by late Fall of 1999. The Company believes it has the ability to perform these functions manually should the remediation efforts not be completed according to plan. The majority of the non-compliant internal systems currently being replaced were scheduled to be replaced prior to Year 2000 for operating efficiency reasons.\n\nFor critical internal systems and equipment determined to be compliant during the assessment phase of the project, and for non-compliant equipment that has been repaired or replaced, the Company has devised and commenced a testing plan to provide additional compliance assurance. To date, the results of the Company's Year 2000 compliance testing program have not revealed any new problems, or ineffective remediation. The Year 2000 testing phase for internal systems and equipment is believed to be approximately 60 percent complete as of the end of January 1999.\n\nThe Company's Year 2000 readiness project also includes procedures designed to identify and assess Year 2000 business interruption which may occur as a result of the Company's dependency on third parties. Vendors, suppliers, service providers, customers and governmental entities that are believed to be critical to the Company's business operations after January 1, 2000 (\"key business partners\") have been identified and significant progress has been made in ascertaining their stage of Year 2000 readiness. These efforts include, among others, circularization of Year 2000 compliance confirmations and conducting interviews and on-site reviews.\n\nThe Company could potentially experience disruptions as a result of non-compliant systems utilized by some of its key business partners or unrelated third party governmental and business entities. Contingency plans are under development to mitigate these potential disruptions to business operations. These contingency plans include, but are not limited to, identification of alternative suppliers, vendors and service providers and planned accumulation of inventory to ensure production capability. The Company is also developing contingency plans for its internal critical business systems. These contingency planning activities are intended to reduce risk, but cannot eliminate the potential for business disruption caused by third party failures.\n\nThe Company estimates that its total Year 2000 compliance costs will approximate $25 million. Approximately $15 million of the estimated costs are attributable to assessment, repair and testing activities and will be expensed as incurred (approximately $7 million expensed in 1998 and $8 million expected to be expensed in 1999). The remaining $10 million represents the estimated cost to replace non-compliant systems and will be capitalized and amortized over a period ranging between five and ten years. The Company anticipates that the funds needed to complete the Year 2000 compliance efforts and referenced system replacements will be provided primarily from the Company's operating cash flows.\n\nBased upon the activities described above, the Company does not believe that the Year 2000 problem is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or results of operations.\n\nThe above discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future results and events. These statements are made pursuant to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements contained in the Year 2000 discussion should be read in conjunction with the following disclosures of the Company.\n\nCautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nForward-looking statements, which the Company believes to be reasonable and are made in good faith, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of, the Company.\n\nTaking into account the foregoing, the following are identified as important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of, the Company:\n\nThe dates on which the Company believes its Year 2000 readiness project will be completed are based on management's best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events, including the continued availability of certain resources, third-party modification plans and other factors. Unanticipated failures by critical vendors, as well as a failure by the Company to execute successfully its own remediation efforts, however, could have a material adverse effect on the costs associated with the Year 2000 readiness project and on its completion. Some important factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include, but are not limited to, the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas, the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code, the timely and accurate responses to and correction by third-parties and suppliers, the ability to implement interfaces between new systems and the systems not being replaced and similar uncertainties. Due to the general uncertainty inherent in the Year 2000 problem, the Company cannot ensure its ability to timely and cost-effectively resolve problems associated with the Year 2000 issue that may affect its operations and business or expose it to third-party liability."
