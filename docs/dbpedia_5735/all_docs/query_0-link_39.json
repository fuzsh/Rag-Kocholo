They have written engaging and diverse essays that I anticipate will have a significant impact on the study of Buffalo specifically and American urbanism generally. This project began when I was hired as the curatorial consultant at the Buffalo Architecture Center (now the Lipsey Architecture Center Buffalo), housed in the former Buffalo Psychiatric Center, a building designed as a collaboration between Henry Hobson Richardson and Frederick Law Olmsted. Despite my living in nearby Rochester, a city that came to its own florescence at the same time as Buffalo, Buffalo's clear and outsized importance as a laboratory for architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning quickly drew me into its history. In my initial year of consulting work I enlisted the help of two of this book's authors—Marta Cieślak and Annie Schentag—as well as Eitan Freedenberg as curatorial assistants. All of them brought a distinct passion and commitment to their research that has helped to shape both the content and conception of the book. Friends and colleagues including Brian Carter, Frank Kowsky, Toshiko Mori, and Mary Roberts engaged me in fruitful discussions about the city and its cultural landscape. Elizabeth Demers at Johns Hopkins University Press took an initial interest in the project, and when it was considered to be too far out of their geographical purview, she laid the groundwork for its successful enlisting with Michael McGandy at Cornell University Press. Michael and his team, including Bethany Wasik, Jennifer Savran Kelly, Brock Edward Schnoke, and the copy editor Glenn Novak have insured the careful and thoughtful navigation from manuscript to finished product. I am also grateful to the two anonymous readers for their excellent criticisms, which certainly made this book stronger. Finally, I am grateful to two sources that helped fund this publication: the New York State Council on the Arts and the dean's office of the College of Arts, Sciences and Engineering at the University of Rochester. As funding in the humanities decreases and books become more expensive to produce, institutions like these are essential to the continued success of scholarly publishing. vii\n\nMap 1 Buffalo.

Christensen\n\nOn September 5, 1901, Buffalo, relishing its new moniker as “The City of Light,” emblematized the ascendant and prosperous American city. The city had risen to the status of America’s eighth largest city, its peak, behind New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Boston, Baltimore, and Cleveland.1 Its prosperity, stemming dually from several decades of trade as the terminus of the Erie Canal and the home of a spate of new hydroelectric power stations harnessing the power of Niagara Falls and the Niagara River, had transformed a small trading outpost in the heart of the Wenro Nation into America’s great threshold between the Eastern Seaboard and the Midwest. Its importance was not merely national—it was intercontinental, playing host to the elaborate Pan-American Exposition of that same year, a world’s fair sitting on 350 acres of what is today Buffalo’s Delaware Park and attracting a total of eight million visitors.2 Unlike the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago nearly a decade earlier, famous for its monolithic all-white Beaux-Arts architecture, the Pan-American Exposition was designed to celebrate color and illumination, with its buildings festooned with color increasingly as they reached the exhibition’s center of gravity, the Electric Tower. Walter Hines Page, editor of the Atlantic Monthly (a publication established by Frederick Law Olmsted), exclaimed of the tower: “Out of the city of beauty rises a massive pillar, like an overlooking flower in a gorgeous garden, a centerpiece in a cluster of gems, a venerable 1\n\n2 I n t r o d u c t i o n\n\nfabric of jeweled lace. There it stands, glowing with the lights of many thousand bulbs flashing its image in the basin at its feet, showing the gleaming dome to the people in neighboring cities. Its beauty is transcendent.”3 One of the gems flanking the tower was the so-called Temple of Music, a concert hall and auditorium designed by the architects August Esenwein and James Johnson that served as the exposition’s main staging ground for all its large public performances and speeches.4 The ornate, if stylistically confused, building was also draped amply in lights, gleaming at night for all to see and boasting, like the Electric Tower, of Buffalo’s ample supply of electric power at a time when electrification was both exciting and synonymous with modernity. On that early fall day, William McKinley, a popular US president credited with bringing the American economy back from crisis several years earlier and into its second gilded age (replete with new colonial holdings like Puerto Rico and the Philippines), delivered a speech on tariffs and foreign trade. In it, McKinley, responding to the fair’s hemispheric purview, outlined a vision of a United States that would lead not only its own people but its neighbors in the Americas into a new century of power and prosperity. Like the Electric Tower, the country was to act as a beautiful beacon. His vision, projected out from Buffalo to the rest of the world at the dawn of the twentieth century, is one that would come true, at least for the United States. Buffalo, at the geographic crossroads of America’s agricultural, financial, and political power, marked also the United States’ chronological crossing from an upstart nation with growing pains into a country that confidently assumed the role of the world’s greatest political power. Amid the throngs of visitors, however, not all was bathed in light and economic optimism. One visitor, Leon Czolgosz, the child of first-wave Polish immigrants, himself a devout Catholic and a steelworker from Michigan, had lost his job from the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company in the economic crash of 1893. Czolgosz was unable to find sufficient support in the church and developed an interest in radical socialism and ultimately anarchism.5 On September 6, the day after McKinley’s speech, Czolgosz traveled to the exhibition grounds with a.32-caliber revolver to find McKinley on a greeting line at the Hall of Music. At 4:07 p.m., McKinley extended his hand to Czolgosz, which Czolgosz slapped aside before shooting the president in the abdomen twice at point-blank range. McKinley would die eight days later in a Buffalo hospital, to be succeeded as president by Theodore Roosevelt. On October 29 Czolgosz was electrocuted by three eighteen-hundred-volt jolts at nearby Auburn prison. It was hoped that this spectacle of electricity, seen by far fewer people but followed by many in the news, would bring cold comfort to a grieving nation.\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n 3\n\nCity of Light / City of Angst In Buffalo, the horrible event cast a dark pall over the City of Light. Margaret Creighton has noted that the city’s newspapers and various voices from the Buffalo community had considered the assassination to be an assault on the city, as much as it was on the president.6 This sentiment seemed to bear itself out in the facts. Buffalo has since been unable to seize the outsize attention that it enjoyed in 1901. The city would be quickly outpaced by the growth of other American cities to its south and to its west and would drop out of the top ten most populous cities by World War I.7 The growing American railway network and the rapid growth of Chicago, in particular, displaced much of the original economic power of the city. For the following decades good jobs in Buffalo went from being plentiful to being scarce. The quality and quantity of new construction and urban development declined, with some very important exceptions featured in this book. Buffalo, once at the crossroads of America’s geography and prosperity, was now at the intersection of the woes wrought by both deindustrialization and the growth of the suburbs. One could say that those, too, paralyzed Buffalo. This book is a story about a representative city, not a delimited one. To this end, a fuller portrait of Buffalo must move beyond its relatively small city limits to tell the full story that the Erie Canal, hydroelectric power, international trade (particularly with Canada), and suburbanization play in the\n\nFigure 0.1 View of an abandoned home at Love Canal, 1976.

As such, this book is centered on both Erie and Niagara Counties from the eighteenth century to the present. Indeed, looking to the city’s periphery provides useful insights into the full scope of how the grand City of Light, powered by Niagara’s heaving currents and celebrated at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901, had its own undercurrents and afterlives. Furthermore, it is important to remember that history does not begin and end with great white men and politics alone. A fuller portrait is not only about geography but also about polyvalent voices. One must also tend to the stories of the underrepresented and the underheard, too, a task this book takes very seriously. Let us fast forward three-quarters of a century to March 28, 1979. On this day, a couple from Niagara Falls, Anne Hillis and Jim Clark, presented testimony to the Joint Senate Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution and Hazardous Waste, detailing their prolonged struggle to get answers as to why their lives had been recently turned upside down. Why had a defunct canal, constructed in a utopian industrial scheme in 1894, been allowed to be the dumping ground for a company’s toxic chemical waste? Why, after that, at the height of white flight from Buffalo, had officials allowed the site to be developed as a residential enclave and school? Why were government officials hiding information and mishandling a disastrous environmental situation, making the residents feel all but abandoned? Hillis and Clark ended their testimony, the first of several residents of the area known as Love Canal to testify that spring, by holding up a picture of a young girl, her face covered in a horrible rash. The couple revealed that that girl had been hospitalized just days earlier and that she was, in fact, their daughter.8 “Why, if we can send billions of dollars to Egypt and Iran, can’t we [get] help in Love Canal?” they asked. Why had America turned its back on the city that had once been tasked to represent it? Just as Hillis and Clark were sharing on Capitol Hill their account of a nightmarish life in a Buffalo suburb, a nuclear accident was unfolding ninety miles north on Three Mile Island, an accident whose shadow cast itself widely over the remainder of the hearings.9 At that moment, the anxiety of two private Buffalo-area citizens over their environmental welfare transmuted into the nation’s anxiety over its own environmental welfare, and the broader picture of its environmental future. The human reality at Love Canal was bleak, but the site also reflected a Zeitgeist that spring, sowed by the work of environmentalists like Rachel Carson and foregrounded by the Three Mile Island incident and the hit film The China Syndrome, released the same day Hillis and Clark’s daughter was hospitalized.10 It would be easy to chalk up to chance such a chronological coincidence, but for the student of Buffalo’s history, it is hard not to interpret it as something more. The history of Love Canal, which one might see as\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n 5\n\nthe historiographic inversion of the spectacle that was the Pan-American Exposition, is itself a sort of bellwether of patterns in American culture and urbanism. At first, it represented both unbridled faith in American industrialization and optimism for the City Beautiful movement. Conceived of by the railroad entrepreneur William Love in 1890 as a waterway that could bypass Niagara Falls and bring supplies to a utopian model city on the shores of Lake Ontario, Love Canal attracted a great deal of interest from industrialists who saw opportunities to develop the canal’s banks in tandem with the harvesting of hydroelectric power that was taking hold nearby. A serious economic depression, compounded by technological advancements in the nation’s electricity grid, thwarted Love’s plan and left only one mile of the canal, just north of the Niagara River, complete.11 Later, Love Canal bore witness to the often violent confrontation in American culture between industry and rapid suburbanization. The Hooker Chemical Company purchased the canal site in 1947, using Love’s failed nineteenth-century canal as receptacle for caustics, alkalines, fatty acids, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, all within a stone’s throw of new middle-income ranch-style developments whose front lawns would reveal the slow upward bubbling of these chemicals in the decades to come.12 Finally, while the Senate hearing on Capitol Hill represented a crossroads for a national environmental awareness, echoing back the historical legacies of industrialization and deurbanization, it also represented Buffalo’s pivotal role in getting something done: the expansion of the role of the Environmental Protection Agency and the establishment of the Superfund program in 1980.13 Neither McKinley’s assassination nor Love Canal, in other words, can be viewed as anomalous events. Rather, the history of Buffalo is, in so many ways, prescient of American culture and occasionally even global culture writ large. This leitmotif, one where Buffalo stands for the currents of history, urban life, architecture, landscape, art, and infrastructure, and where it represents a crossroads of historical legacy and contemporary development, is this volume’s common thread. In representing currents that are perceived as both good and bad and, more commonly, somewhere in between, this volume showcases the outsize importance of Buffalo’s history by focusing on its environments, like the Hall of Music or Love Canal, and their transmutable meanings.\n\nBuffalo: Muse of History As a collection of works by scholars from a variety of disciplines and with a variety of methods, this volume juxtaposes different interpretations of both history and the present moment, all of which resist the reductive,\n\n6 I n t r o d u c t i o n\n\nboosterist narratives around Buffalo’s so-called heyday and current supposed renaissance, as well as the hopeless, even nihilist depictions of its profound struggles as a desolated, abjectly poor, and peripheral American city. While the volume features architectural history most prominently, it also features essays by cultural historians, an environmental historian, an architect, and a theorist. Rather than partitioning the disciplines, it is the aim of this volume to stress the breadth of audiences that multidisciplinarity affords and that this book will hopefully enjoy. The McKinley and Love Canal moments are two cases in point, testifying to the benefits of taking in multiple vantage points. Indeed while, circa 1980, the residents of Love Canal were suffering through an environmental catastrophe and the population of Buffalo itself experienced its single largest population decrease over the course of a decade, nearly 25 percent, the city was also experiencing one of its greatest cultural florescences: the pathbreaking exhibitions of then little-known artists Cindy Sherman, Gordon Matta-Clark, and Robert Longo, among others, at the Hallwalls gallery, the arrival of the iconoclastic British architectural historian Peter Reyner Banham at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the emergence of a dynamic LGBTQ scene.14 The same dialectics can be located in the historical moment surrounding the Pan-American Exposition. While the city welcomed visitors from around the globe to its glitzy exposition touting Buffalo’s water-born modernity, newly arrived residents in the city, particularly Poles, Irish, and African Americans, were living in squalid tenements and flophouses that matched the level of dereliction of those documented by Jacob Riis in New York City. The problem was Buffalo did not have a Jacob Riis and would not, until decades later, enjoy the same housing reforms that Riis ultimately afforded to New York City. Nineteenth-century world’s fairs are well known for their less than tasteful depictions of race, but the Pan-American Exposition proffered a particularly nasty array of “ethnographic” encounters amid the colorful, electrified architecture. The Apache Geronimo was brought all the way from an Oklahoma prison to be ogled. Plains Indians came from the Midwest and Rockies merely to reenact the battles they lost as European settlers moved west. And Filipino warriors performed a number of “native” acts in the Native Village that celebrated America’s recent annexation of the Philippines, even as American soldiers were still fighting Filipinos in parts of the country that were still trying to assert their sovereignty from US imperialism.15 In Buffalo, there was always a human tragedy not far away from something touted as an unalloyed success, a fact that remains just as true today.\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n 7\n\nIt is not novel to point out the dialectic of optimism and pessimism, of death and vitality in any place and time in history. Jane Jacobs made that dialectic famous in the Death and Life of Great American Cities.16 But in Buffalo, this dialectic seems almost to be conscious, as if it is designed to be the very fuel of the city, and one of its defining traits, rather than the result of the chronicler’s work. The city functions this way not because the historian says so but because it has been designed as such. One would be hard pressed to find another American city that exhibited such high-minded architecture and planning, just as one would be startled to see how little of the wealth that fueled those visions is left to support it. To this end, let us consider Reyner Banham a bit more, a figure explored in some detail in this volume, that brought a fresh set of foreign eyes to the city’s uncanny importance. Buffalo is particularly indebted to his architectural scholarship and passion for the city, and for cultivating a global interest and local reinvestment in its urban fabric that persists into the present. In the introduction to his now-classic 1981 book, Buffalo Architecture: A Guide, which included contributions from Frank Kowsky and Jack Quinan, both who have contributed to this volume, Banham opens with the pronouncement: “This book is intended to make it impossible, ever again, for anyone who cares about architecture to say, ‘We drove by Buffalo on the Thruway, but decided not to stop because there’s nothing there to look at—is there?’ ” With these words, written during the city’s deepest postindustrial struggles, Banham not only inspired readers to visit and understand the city on its own terms; he also illustrated how the city’s influence is legible beyond its borders, anywhere that industrial and modernist architecture is found. Almost forty years later, it would be hard to find anyone curious about architecture who would not get off the Thruway to see the treasures that Banham and his collaborators dutifully celebrated in a time when it seemed to many that there was very little to actually celebrate: Daniel Burnham’s Ellicott Square Building, Louis Sullivan’s Guaranty Building, Eero and Eliel Saarinen’s Kleinhans Music Hall, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Darwin Martin House, and Henry Hobson Richardson and Frederick Law Olmsted’s Buffalo Psychiatric Center, among the most prominent examples. Banham’s contribution is key in that it forcibly inserted historical consciousness into Buffalo’s dialectic of optimism and pessimism, death and vitality, and forced the city and those who study it to reckon with the fact that a city like this had, and could continue to have, the ability to design its own fate despite any number of odds against it, ranging from military battles to harsh weather to the tumultuous politics of New York State, all themes that are examined in this volume.\n\n8 I n t r o d u c t i o n\n\nSince 1981, in addition to gaining the attention of architectural scholars and tourists, Buffalo has emerged as a linchpin in discourses of urban revitalization. Indeed, Buffalo’s trajectory in the years since the Guide’s publication is best understood in the context of the city’s ever-evolving relationship with architecture and landscape. The city has historically been a laboratory for new design practices and ideas, from “form follows function” to sustainability, as a home to “SolarCity” and a Tesla production plant. Now, after decades of industrial decline and disastrous urban renewal policies, these same practices and ideas are central to the attempts to revive the city culturally and economically, some of which are successful and some of which are not. From adaptive reuse of factories to the conservation of Olmsted’s parks, urbanists, architects, and planners are wrestling with how best to design the city’s fabric in a way that suits the needs of its twenty-first-century populace, a populace whose demographics and spending power are in constant flux. Architectural heritage is valued not only as raw material but also as inspiration: pioneering skyscrapers such as the Guaranty Building and daylight factories such as Trico Plant No. 1, which once inspired architects globally, have been reclaimed as symbols of local vitality and resilience. But is this enough? In other words, is a distinguished architectural legacy a powerful enough agent of political and economic change? What can Buffalo teach us about how architecture that fights above its weight is—or is not—able to function as an economic engine in any number of cities across the globe? In addition to these questions about its inherent value in politics and economics, architecture, with its ties to landscape and urban history, is also a particularly useful means for grappling with some of the key social and cultural issues facing the American city: racial and ethnic inequality and the constancy of political corruption. This volume includes one chapter explicitly about ethnicity, specifically Polish immigration, but also presents several additional reflections on the perpetuation of inequality in one of the most racially segregated (sixth in the white-black index and twenty-first in the white-Hispanic index) metropolitan regions in the United States, an inequality made abundantly clear by the red line running along the city’s Main Street.17 Segregation continues to impose a wide range of costs on people of color, hindering everything from their access to health care and education to good jobs and public transportation. Rather than consider this purely as a demographic issue, this volume looks at the historical and spatial mechanisms that have produced this serious problem, from the inequitable planning of parks and transport thoroughfares to the uneven development that characterizes Buffalo’s south side and strategies of refugee resettlement that both counteract and entrench patterns of\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n 9\n\ninequality. Yet just as Buffalo is famous as the terminus of the Erie Canal, it was also a terminus of the Underground Railroad, playing an important role in the liberation of thousands of slaves.18 Buffalo’s woes have also included a legacy of crime and corruption, particularly as it relates to the city’s development. This was most recently highlighted in a spate of fraud and corruption charges brought against top deputies of New York State’s governor and the city’s biggest developer in conjunction with the so-called “Buffalo Billion,” a widely touted investment package supposedly intended to invigorate business and development in Buffalo, pledged by the governor in 2013.19 Why exactly such a legacy of corruption became established in this particular city is not entirely clear, but various actors, from politicians to developers to landlords, have laundered money, smuggled illegal substances, and rigged the appropriation of public monies in Buffalo for decades at a rate and scale far outpacing cities of its size. One way that we may consider this is through Buffalo’s status as a border city, something I explore in my own essay. Another way to explore the culture of distrust is through examining the upstate-downstate divide that has increasingly pitted a wealthy New York City against an upstate in a slow economic decline since the 1970s, a dynamic explored in two different essays about Buffalo in that decade. Buffalo is New York State’s second city, and in many ways must bear the burden of representing the vast territory of “upstate” to all those whose primary orbit is metropolitan New York City. Ironically, the historical record also reveals Buffalo’s status as the cradle of the anticorruption movement. When President McKinley passed away and Theodore Roosevelt ascended to the White House, the former Rough Rider and New York City police commissioner made it one of his central missions to root out the corruption in civic life that had thrived in the state since Tammany Hall and William “Boss” Tweed.20 Bringing his hard-charging police sensibility to the national stage, Roosevelt pursued numerous indictments of individuals involved in corruption in government and designed a multitude of new laws and structural systems that would form the basis for twentiethcentury anticorruption law nationwide. Buffalo prides itself as the birthplace of Roosevelt’s Progressive legacy, most vividly in a house museum dedicated to the site of his impromptu inauguration following McKinley’s assassination. Here too we might underscore the consistent divide in Buffalo between rhetoric—for example the unilateral boosterist narratives of a contemporary “renaissance”—and the messier reality on the ground. The contributors in this volume likewise see Buffalo’s status as a city of contradictions not as an impediment or nuisance, but rather as key to understanding the city’s past, present, and future. Their essays concern the local\n\n10 I n t r o d u c t i o n\n\nand global and high and low contexts of Buffalo’s architectural heritage: the Second Industrial Revolution; the City Beautiful; world’s fairs; the grain, railroad, and shipping industries; urban renewal and white flight; and the larger networks of labor and economic output to which the city has been attached—to Canada, the Great Lakes, New York City, Europe, and beyond. Bringing the past to bear on the present and vice versa, the contributors pay significant attention to currents that connect contemporary Buffalo to the legacy established by Richardson, Olmsted, Adler, Sullivan, Bethune, Wright, Saarinen, and others. Interweaving familiar histories and figures with new research on everyday environments and critical interventions, they offer twelve modern, topically diverse, and provocative additions to Buffalo’s historiography. This book is organized in four clusters. The four clusters— Buffalo as Territory, Buffalo as Utopia, Buffalo as Experiment, and Buffalo as Palimpsest—all stress Buffalo’s multivalency, jettisoning the idea that the city has an exceptional status as an epicenter or is, like Detroit or Cleveland, American architectural history’s tragic muse.\n\nBuffalo at the Crossroads: An Overview The opening section, Buffalo as Territory, refers to the ways in which the city functions as a sprawling topography, connecting (or not) social, environmental, and geopolitical concerns, and features essays by Stewart Weaver, myself, and Julia Tulke. Stewart Weaver’s essay, “ ‘The Olmsted City’: Heritage Landscapes and Civic Identity in Twentieth-Century Buffalo,” examines Frederick Law Olmsted’s environmental legacy in Buffalo and the central, and often troubled, role it played in the city’s identity in the century following its completion. Weaver shows that for all of the depredations of Olmsted’s work over the years (a new expressway being the most obvious example), much of Olmsted’s work in Buffalo survives both psychologically and physically. In my own essay, “The Peace Bridge and the Rhetoric of Hospitality at the US-Canada Border,” I explore Buffalo’s role as a border city and a hub of transnational infrastructures, with the Peace Bridge as centerpiece. I explore the ways in which Western notions and traditions of hospitality can be seen as a lens for understanding how the built environment was tasked with manifesting transnational hospitality in concrete and steel. In her essay “Of Silo Dreams and Deviant Houses: Uneven Geographies of Abandonment in Buffalo, New York,” Julia Tulke explores the disused industrial sites, vacant lots, and boarded-up houses of Buffalo that mark its decay and abandonment, a material condition that has come to be understood as a hallmark of rust belt urbanism. Tulke shows a struggling city in a\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n 11\n\nregion marked by decline and the debris and ruins of its industrial past, and marred by the residential abandonment left behind as the city lost more than half its population. The second section, Buffalo as Utopia, examines Buffalo’s appeal as a place for grand visions in corporate, religious, and industrial architecture and their philosophical implications, and features essays by Jack Quinan, Francis Kowsky, Annie Schentag, and Claire Zimmerman. Quinan’s essay, “ ‘In the Thought of the World’: Frank Lloyd Wright’s Larkin Administration Building,” probes the question of why Buffalo was the site of one of the most esteemed buildings in the modernist canon, the Larkin Administration Building. Quinan first considers the circumstances of the commission: a once-flourishing industrial city, a team of progressive clients, and a unique opportunity for the architect to extend his practice beyond the domestic realm, expand his practice eastward, and comment on the work of the Chicago School. Francis Kowsky’s essay, “Max Abramovitz’s Temple Beth Zion: ‘An Airport for the Spirit, Where the Soul Takes Off for Heaven,’ ” documents Abramovitz’s Temple Beth Zion in Buffalo, a significant but lesser-known example of mid-twentieth-century modernism. An in-depth portrait of this building, almost lost in the shadows of the works of more famous architects in the city, elucidates the historical and cultural significance of this four-part complex, comprising a synagogue, school, and other facilities. Annie Schentag’s essay, “Putting the Rust in Rust Belt: Architectural Tourism and Industrial Heritage,” demonstrates that while Buffalo is currently lauded as a destination for viewing the commercial and residential architecture by the triumvirate of Sullivan, Wright, and Richardson, it also boasts a lesser-known, long-standing tradition of architectural tourism in the industrial sector as well. Claire Zimmerman’s essay, “Anticipating Images: Buffalo Industry under Construction, 1906–1943,” explores Albert Kahn’s work in the city, beginning with the Pierce-Arrow Motor Company plant (1906), cited by some as a predecessor to the assembly line invented at Highland Park in Detroit several years later. This essay considers all of Kahn’s works in Buffalo over the first three decades of the twentieth century. Photographs of these projects while under construction capture the image of assembly-line manufacture as it came into being on these sites, and Zimmermann considers this image in relation to Buffalo’s history and also to factory architecture as a crucible of modernism. The third section, Buffalo as Experiment, focuses on the city’s economic and geographic capacity to offer a haven for new artistic and social experiments\n\n12 I n t r o d u c t i o n\n\ndiffering from those in other associated centers like New York City and features essays by Marta Cieślak, Mary Woods, and A. Joan Saab. Cieślak’s essay, “In the Buffalo Community, but Not of It: Polish Migrants, Urban Poverty, and the American Nation in Buffalo at the Turn of the Twentieth Century,” probes questions concerning immigration and the experience of Polish migrants in Buffalo. Similar to other predominantly rural workingclass Europeans in American cities, Poles established what one expert called a city within a city: neighborhoods in which migrants found their own space to face the challenges of urban industrial life and which many Americans perceived as a threat to the development of not only the great cities but also the American nation. An essay by Mary Woods, “Upstate and Downstate Avant-Gardes: Artists and Artist Communities in Postindustrial Buffalo and New York City in the 1970s,” explores how Buffalo, like New York City, battered by white flight to the suburbs, misguided urban renewal programs, and widespread deindustrialization, struggled with economic decline, depopulated neighborhoods, and social and political unrest during the 1960s and 1970s. “Lake Effect: Art and Childhood in 1970s Buffalo,” by A. Joan Saab, explores the overlapping environmental conditions of weather, everyday life, and industrial pollution in Buffalo through the prism of personal narrative. Saab employs the city’s watery sites—the Niagara River, Lake Erie, and the Erie Canal, as points of her analysis, and major weather events such as the blizzard of ’77 as defining moments in the 1970s and ’80s, a time when many of the locations that used to mark Buffalo’s prosperity, and events that used to define Buffalo’s hardiness and resilience, came to expose many of its sorrows and challenges, framed here through the lens of both art and the built environment. Finally, Buffalo as Palimpsest refers to the writing and rewriting of the city by a range of authors and features essays by Erkin Özay and Hadas Steiner. Özay’s essay, “Rust Belt Cosmopolitanism: Resettlement Urbanism in Buffalo, New York,” explores how resettlement embodies a viable force in the transformation of America’s weak market cities. Like Buffalo’s peers in the rust belt, the city offers affordable environments, cooperative city governments, and welcoming publics seeking to impede population decline and foster urban revitalization. By focusing on Buffalo, known as a “preferred resettlement community,” Özay provides insights into the workings of this resettlement urbanism, conditioned by a loosely coordinated network of institutions. In “Cropping the View: Reyner Banham and the Image of Buffalo,” Hadas Steiner employs the city of Buffalo as a tool to study the history of\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n 13\n\narchitecture itself. Steiner makes the provocative argument that the deployment of architectural history in Buffalo demonstrates how scholarship can be misused to justify policies that reify segregation. She notes the commonplace co-option of cultural capital by politicians and developers while prognostically exploring how disciplinary resources might be directed elsewhere, stemming the growing tide of what she describes as spatial injustice in Buffalo and beyond. Seen together, these essays proffer a dual register for understanding Buffalo’s myriad guises as at once an exceptional and a prototypical American city. The first of these registers is that of historical exegesis. The authors of this volume employ varied and innovative methodologies to unearth new facts and new stories that deepen our understanding of this important American city. The second of these registers is that of interconnectedness—be it diasporic, bi-urban, transnational, or stylistic—one that shows how the themes often at the core of biographic and national architectural and landscape history can be configured and perceived anew. This is Buffalo, at the crossroads of the physical and scholarly environment.\n\nCh a p ter 1\n\n“The Olmsted City” Heritage Landscapes and Civic Identity in Twentieth-Century Buffalo Stewart Weaver\n\nApproaching downtown Buffalo from the east on Interstate 190—the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway— one hurtles thoughtlessly through the sprawling “geography of nowhere.”1 Strip malls, office parks, housing tracts, cell towers, high tension lines—all the dreary detritus of American exurbia slides past the windows at dizzying speed, and absent any obviously identifying features one might think oneself anywhere in that vast intermediate territory where the East gradually elides with the Midwest. Unless, that is, when crossing the city line one happens to catch a passing glimpse of a weathered, weed-choked, soot-begrimed sign that says “Welcome to Buffalo: Home of the Olmsted Parks System.” It stands stranded in the grassy verge of the South Ogden Street entrance ramp—as incongruous a tribute to the great apostle of the American pastoral as can possibly be imagined. And it hardly lessens the irony to know, as a few passersby might, that just ten miles ahead, Interstate 190 will completely overwhelm Front Park, an Olmsted-designed esplanade that once peacefully overlooked Lake Erie; or that twelve miles ahead, it will merge with the Scajaquada Expressway, a crosstown “arterial” that since the 1960s has brutally bisected Delaware Park, once Olmsted’s pride and joy; or that fourteen miles ahead the Scajaquada in turn will merge with the Kensington Expressway, a six-lane asphalt monstrosity that in 1958 obliterated one of\n\n17\n\n18 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nthe most beautiful and distinctive streets in America, namely, Frederick Law Olmsted’s Humboldt Parkway. Welcome to Buffalo indeed, one might think, former home of the Olmsted Parks System. But that would be unfair. For all the depredations and degradations of the years—and the expressways are only the most obvious of these—much of Olmsted’s work in Buffalo survives, both physically and psychologically, and even in its mangled form it remains one of the most original and distinctive park ensembles in the United States.2 Moreover, it is slowly returning from the brink of extinction and beginning to resume something like the prominent place in the social and topographical life of the city for which it was first designed. The same could be said, of course, of Central Park or Prospect Park or Franklin Park or any number of other Olmsted-designed landscapes across the country. They have all come back from the brink since the 1970s, when the word “park” scarcely applied to the dilapidated and dangerous places they had become. But Buffalo’s case is nevertheless distinctive in two crucial respects. First, no other city of comparable size fell so far or so fast in the postwar period. Buffalo lost half its people and almost all its manufacturing industry between 1950 and 2000. Even for the rust belt, such decline was dizzying, and it left Buffalo in especially dire need of a reason for being. And second, no\n\nFigure 1.1 “Welcome to Buffalo”: the sign that has greeted northbound motorists on the Niagara Thruway at the Buffalo city line since June 2000.

New York has its Central Park, Boston its Emerald Necklace, Montreal its Mont Royal, but Buffalo, Francis Kowsky argues, was the client for whom Olmsted exercised “the fullest measure of his genius,” and in that circumstance (insofar as it is true) lay a unique claim on his legacy and the basis of a new urban identity for a postindustrial age.3 The Queen City; the Nickel City; the City of Light; the City of Good Neighbors—Buffalo has had many a moniker over the years. But it was only in 2003 that then-mayor Anthony Masiello officially proclaimed it “the Olmsted City” in a somewhat backhanded tribute to a park system that his predecessors had very nearly destroyed. No other American mayor has done this; no other urban territory asserts so direct and forceful a claim on the Olmsted heritage; nowhere else than in Buffalo, that is to say, do we see so clearly how a once-prized cultural landscape came first to be forgotten and abused and then suddenly remembered, reclaimed, and (partially) restored to its place at the center of American civic consciousness.\n\n“The Best Planned City” Frederick Law Olmsted’s brief but consequential acquaintance with “the Queen City of the Lakes” began on August 16, 1868, when, en route to Chicago, he stopped off in Buffalo at the invitation of William Dorsheimer, the US district attorney for northern New York and the leading figure of a group of civic-minded citizens seeking to lend a sylvan aspect to their fastgrowing but otherwise unremarkable hometown. Already renowned as the co-architect (along with his partner Calvert Vaux) of New York’s Central Park, Olmsted was at that time busily engaged in the making of Prospect Park, Brooklyn, and the residential subdivision of Riverside, Illinois, but what he saw in the course of a one-day tour of Buffalo intrigued him, and a week later he interrupted his return trip to New York for a closer look. Thus far in his young career as a landscape architect, he had been involved in the design and construction of individual parks, but in Buffalo he for the first time perceived a different possibility: not a single central park of the sort that Dorsheimer and his fellow worthies had in mind—that is, something to rival the great new parks of New York and Brooklyn—but a park system, a comprehensive ensemble of interconnected parks and parkways that would extend its salubrious influence throughout the far-flung territory of the city. Despite its obvious wealth and energy, and despite the elegance of Joseph\n\n20 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nEllicott’s radial street design, Buffalo and its “immediate environs” struck Olmsted as “not generally at all attractive.” The relation of the town to its canals, railroads, and rivers was such “as to make an escape from it in several directions, to anything like rural quiet, difficult and disagreeable if not impossible,” he wrote, especially during that “considerable part of the year” when the “portion of the environs” that was “otherwise least repellent to rural exercise” was swept by “harsh, damp winds.” In light of all this and more, any landscape scheme for Buffalo had to be “comprehensively conceived.” A single large park, however desirable and necessary, “should not be the sole object in view,” Olmsted argued, “but should be regarded simply as the more important member of a general, largely provident, forehanded comprehensive arrangement for securing refreshment, recreation and health to the people.”4 Under the authority of the newly established Buffalo Parks Commission (1869), the main elements of the Buffalo park system went in more or less according to Olmsted and Vaux’s original conception between 1871 and 1876. Foremost among these was the 350-acre expanse that Olmsted called simply “the Park.” Here among the gently rolling meadows and forest stands north of Forest Lawn Cemetery, Olmsted indulged more fully than almost anywhere else the pastoral impulse for which he is most known. The heart of the Park was a greensward meadow twice the size of the famous Long Meadow in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park. Here was room enough indeed for that “sense of enlarged freedom” that was, Olmsted believed, the very essence of the park experience. Southwest of the meadow, where Scajaquada Creek flowed gently out of Forest Lawn Cemetery, Olmsted placed a picturesque “water park” around a forty-six-acre artificial lake. Together with the happily adjacent gothic cemetery, the pastoral meadow (complete with sheep and deer paddock) and the picturesque “water park” made for a remarkable landscape ensemble and the most notable addition thus far to Olmsted’s oeuvre outside of New York and Brooklyn.5 And still “the Park” was only the offset centerpiece of a remarkable landscape triptych that also featured “the Front,” a thirty-five-acre esplanade and playground overlooking Lake Erie and the Niagara River, and “the Parade,” a fifty-six-acre drill and picnic ground on the city’s East Side. Both of these smaller, satellite spaces Olmsted envisioned as active recreational complements to the larger contemplative sanctuary of the Park, and in placing them closer to the heart of downtown, he purposefully meant to integrate them more fully into the swirling life of the city. But they were still places apart, still places of quasi-rural refuge from the noisome influences of the commercial and industrial districts, and as if to emphasize their significance to\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 21\n\nFigure 1.2 “The Park & Approaches.” Olmsted, Vaux, and Company’s plan for the Park (now Delaware Park) and the four parkway approaches to it, circa 1870. Courtesy of the National Park Service, Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site.\n\nthe overall scheme of things, Olmsted and Vaux designed a series of wide, shaded, grassy avenues to join them to the Park, to downtown, and to each other. These “park ways,” as the partners called them, were in some respects the most distinctive and original feature of the entire Buffalo system. Two hundred feet wide and planted with rows of overarching elms, they extended the parklike atmosphere throughout the city and served themselves as parks, in fact, arterial parks “suitable for a short stroll,” Olmsted wrote, “for a playground for children, and an airing ground for invalids, and a route of access to the large common park of the whole city of such a character that most of the steps on the way to it would be taken in the midst of a scene of sylvan beauty, and with the sounds and sites of the ordinary town business, if not wholly shut out, removed to some distance and placed in obscurity.”6 The Park, the Front, the Parade, and their interconnecting parkways were the four original elements of Buffalo’s Olmsted-designed park system. There were more elements to come. But in the meantime, even as the parks\n\n22 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nwere under construction, Olmsted was at work on two other projects that adjoined “the Park” and together with Forest Lawn Cemetery made for a unique green space aggregation. First, in 1871, he and Vaux accepted a commission to design the grounds of what was then known as the Buffalo State Hospital for the Insane. Here, on land immediately to the west of his “Gala Water,” and in friendly collaboration with the young architect H. H. Richardson, Olmsted made fully explicit the psychic purpose that lay behind his entire theory of landscape design. The whole point of a park, as he understood it, was to provide mental relief from the strains and anxieties of urban\n\nFigure 1.3 Olmsted’s plan of Buffalo highlighting the new park and parkway system for display at the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Courtesy of the National Park Service, Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site.\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 23\n\nlife. A park was above all recuperative; it was restorative. If well designed it allowed for the “unbending,” as Olmsted put it, of overtired and overtaxed faculties. As did, ideally, a well-designed residential community of the sort that the private investors behind the Parkside Land Improvement Company had in mind when they asked Olmsted to design a “detached suburb” on land wrapping around the Park to the north. Neither the asylum grounds nor “Parkside” (the name a deliberate nod toward Olmsted’s recently completed “Riverside”) was part of the Buffalo park system. But in Olmsted’s mind they were all of a single therapeutic piece, and he prominently featured them both, along with Forest Lawn Cemetery, when in 1876 he proudly displayed his Buffalo designs at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Eight years earlier he had thought Buffalo “not generally at all attractive,” but now he famously proclaimed it “the best planned city, as to its streets, public places and grounds, in the United States if not the world.”7\n\nThe Period of Significance And still he was not done with it. In 1888, recognizing as he always had that the Park, the Front, and the Parade did little to meet the recreational needs of the working-class districts south of the Buffalo River, Olmsted drew up a visionary plan for a 240-acre pleasure ground along the shores of Lake Erie that many believe might have been his masterpiece. With its stunning combination of beach, meadow, lagoon, and sports ground, “South Park,” as Olmsted called it, promised to retain a pastoral aura even while allowing for that “slight spirit of adventure” that those condemned to “monotonous occupations” amid “somber surroundings” required.8 Sadly, the Buffalo Board of Parks Commissioners did not trust his cost estimates in this case, and the park was never built. In its place, Olmsted somewhat begrudgingly drew up designs for two smaller inland sites that he, for one, found “too large for local grounds, too narrow and cut up for parks.”9 In one of these, the 155-acre South Park, he combined classic pastoral greensward with a picturesque lake and an extensive arboretum that still survives. In the other, the 76-acre Cazenovia Park, he provided for the more robust recreations of boating, skating, riding, and the like. To connect the two southern parks, Olmsted again designed a beautiful pair of wooded parkways, though his hopes of someday extending these to the three northern parks were never realized. After his retirement in 1895, the successor firm of Olmsted Brothers then designed a sixth park for the Buffalo system that overlooked the Niagara River from the north-side community of Black Rock—Riverside Park—and they stayed\n\n24 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\non as consultants to the Board of Parks Commissioners until its dissolution 1915, twelve years after Olmsted’s death and almost half a century after he had first stopped off in Buffalo en route to Chicago. Taken inclusively, the four decades from the building of the first Olmsted parks in Buffalo in the 1870s to the parting of the ways with Olmsted Brothers in 1915 constitute what the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy calls “the period of significance,” that is, “the period of time in which the Olmsted parks made their historic mark on the City of Buffalo,” or “the time period during which [they] attained historical prominence.” Critics of the heritage industry often deride the whole idea of a “period of significance” as ossified and originalist, and the phrase does rather suggest that anything that happened after some idealized founding moment is corrupt and insignificant. But four decades is a long moment, and in this case, at least, the case of Buffalo’s Olmsted parks system, the “period of significance” accommodates considerable redesign and modification of Olmsted’s original intent. Almost immediately, for instance, flower beds and formal gardens began to intrude everywhere on his naturalist lawns and groves. Over his own strenuous objections, the romantic deer paddock in the Park evolved quickly into a bustling, workaday zoo. The bicycling craze of the 1890s forced even the devout William McMillan (Olmsted’s personally anointed Buffalo parks superintendent) to allow the construction of dedicated cycle paths in the Park. And already by 1915, the end of the “period of significance,” the largest open meadow that Olmsted ever designed had given way to an eighteen-hole golf course—an early instance of the profusion of single-use sports facilities that would soon mark the history of Olmsted parks everywhere. Golf courses and soccer fields and even (to a lesser extent) baseball diamonds are at least quasi-pastoral in aspect and thus somewhat assimilable to Olmsted’s aesthetic vision. Not so the large public buildings and institutes that began to encroach on the parks at the turn of the century. The earliest and most egregious instances of this in Buffalo were George Cary’s Buffalo and Erie Country Historical Society (1900) overlooking North Bay in the Park (officially, from 1896, Delaware Park) and Green & Wicks’s Albright Art Gallery, which in 1905 replaced Prospect Concourse, an elegant carriage drive overlooking Gala Water. Apart from simply being too large, conspicuous, and greedy of parkland, both were built in an imposing neoclassical style befitting Chicago’s (and Olmsted’s) White City, perhaps, but wholly at odds with the Romantic pastoral of Olmsted’s Buffalo parks. Not that Buffalo’s were the only Olmsted parks to suffer such institutional indignities. Far from it. But the case of the Albright Art Gallery was, in the estimation of Olmsted’s stepson and successor John C. Olmsted, “one of the worst\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 25\n\nones from the point of view of landscape park design.” The building “completely dominates a considerable part of the park landscape,” he complained, “changing its character from that of a refreshing naturalistic landscape to a mere attachment and decoration of the Art Museum.” An art museum was perfectly desirable, even admirable in itself, he allowed. But “the whole idea of those who favor the placing of such museums in landscape parks is an utterly mistaken one,” he insisted, “and is due to their apparent failure to properly appreciate the purposes and art character of such parks, and to the idea that such parks are merely vacant land awaiting decoration.”10 Of all the existential threats to Olmsted’s parks, the idea that they were “merely vacant land” would in time prove the most destructive, and it derived, ironically, from Olmsted’s own inspired achievement. So natural were his designs, so carefully in keeping were they with the given spirit of a place, that people soon forgot they were engineered at all; they began to think of them as remnant open land available for any use. Happily, Olmsted himself seems to have anticipated this paradoxical response. He knew that cities would grow, that times would change, that civic and recreational needs would evolve, and he built a certain measure of resilience and flexibility into his naturalistic designs. An Olmsted park is artificial, but it is not fragile, and for the forty years following its conception, up to the end of the “period of\n\nFigure 1.4 Green and Wick’s Albright Art Gallery, which much to the dismay of John C. Olmsted replaced his stepfather’s carriage concourse in Delaware Park in 1905. Source: University of Rochester Libraries.\n\n26 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nsignificance,” the Buffalo park system absorbed what came its way without too much distress. Despite the encroachments of golf courses and museums, it was still in 1915 the lush, spacious, sylvan retreat from the city that Olmsted had imagined when he first visited Buffalo in 1868. And then came the automobile.\n\n“The Modern Moloch” The first intimation of the automotive assault on Buffalo’s Olmsted landscape came in 1899, when the newly founded National Motor Transit Company began to operate a half-hourly service from Lincoln Parkway eastward through Delaware Park to Humboldt Parkway and thence to Main Street. Olmsted had designed his parkways for horses, horse-drawn carriages, and pedestrians, of course, but with their level grade and wide expanse they proved to be eminently suited to automobiles and were soon the frequent scene of (at first) recreational motoring. The Olmsted firm seems not to have objected when in 1894 New York State ceded the northern perimeter of the Buffalo State Hospital grounds for the building of a parkway along the meandering course of Scajaquada Creek. Though it mildly compromised the integrity of the working farm that Olmsted had laid out for the benefit of the mental patients, it was after all a respectful extension of his parkway system, one designed eventually to link Delaware Park to Riverside Park, then under construction just to the north in Black Rock. Once occupied by clattering automobiles, however, Scajaquada Parkway emphatically intruded on the outdoor calm that Olmsted believed essential to a therapeutic regimen. And in conjunction with the transit service operating on South Meadow Drive in Delaware Park, it portended far worse things to come.11 Meanwhile, the last park in downtown Buffalo effectively vanished in 1912, when the Common Council authorized the extension of Broadway and Main Street right through Lafayette Square, thus turning Joseph Ellicott’s once-elegant civic centerpiece (and its Olmsted-designed landscape) into a traffic circle. It was this desecration that led the Buffalo Socialist to lament the “continual sacrifice of park space to the needs of traffic,” but theirs was a lonely, antimodernist voice.12 Automobiles were by now all the rage, and no one seems to have minded when in 1926 the whole eastern edge of the Front, Olmsted’s distinctive promenade and park overlooking the Niagara River, became an asphalt approach to the Peace Bridge, then under construction from the adjacent Fort Porter across the river to Canada. That same year, the Civic Planning Association (a coalition of commercial and downtown business interests formed in 1919) called for an end to “the\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 27\n\nmeanderings of Delaware Avenue through the Park.”13 Such meanderings were absolutely essential elements of Olmsted’s pastoral design, but to a quickly growing number of suburban commuters using Delaware Avenue as their way to and from work they were simply a decelerating annoyance, and in 1936 they went, along with Calvert Vaux’s rustic, single-span viaduct that up to now had gracefully carried the park’s carriage drive over the road below. Once a two-lane city street, Delaware Avenue had become a four-lane divided highway bisecting the park on a rigid north-south axis. Bisecting, but still not destroying. Walter Curt Behrendt, a Bauhaus architect and urban planner who had fled Hitler’s Germany in 1934, did not find much to admire in Buffalo when he arrived to take up the directorship of the city’s newly established “Planning Research Station” in 1937. Most of the city struck him as sordid, disordered, and ugly. But he liked Joseph Ellicott’s radial street plan. And he loved Olmsted’s parks. Olmsted’s urban pastoral struck him, in fact, as America’s “first distinct contribution” to the art and science of town planning, and it was nowhere better shown than in Buffalo’s Delaware Park, where Behrendt often strolled of a morning, “enjoying the spaciousness of its landscape—the large perspectives opening up on wide water planes, the beautiful vistas framed by large, old trees.” The recent widening and straightening of Delaware Avenue alarmed him, however. Such a thing would never have happened in Europe, he said, where even the most urgent needs of automotive traffic routinely deferred to the built inheritance of cathedrals, castles, city halls, and the like. The roads went around them, refusing to conform to the crude principle, as Behrendt described it, “that the shortest connection between two points is the straight line.” Buffalo had no cathedrals and castles, of course, no real built inheritance. But it had Olmsted’s parks. These were the equivalent of its civic monuments, and Behrendt pointedly cautioned against sacrificing them to what he called “the modern moloch of speed.” In one of many addresses to Buffalo’s civic leaders, he called for “a strong and never-ceasing vigilance, assuring that this most valuable inheritance will never be impaired or destroyed.”14 But the high-minded, high modernist Behrendt was not a good fit for the (as he saw it) frontier town of Buffalo. He left in 1939, unloved and unlamented, and the modern Moloch of speed ran rampant, here as everywhere in America, as the restraining hand of the Depression lifted and the suburbs far outpaced the city in population growth. The Second World War gave Olmsted’s parks a reprieve in Buffalo, as road construction yielded to the urgent requirements of military production. But even before the war had ended, New York State declared as a matter of policy that “the modernization and construction of arterial highways” both through and around cities\n\n28 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nwould “contribute greatly to post-war reemployment and to the stimulation of industrial recovery,” and with that, the destructive die was cast. The entire premise of the state’s postwar “Report on New York State Thruway and Arterial Routes [in the] Buffalo Urban Area” was that the city’s survival depended on the unimpeded flow of private automobiles to and from the fast-growing suburbs and the downtown business district. Traffic congestion, the report assumed, was strangling the city to death, spreading “blight and economic dry rot” and “seriously menacing city property and tax values.” To alleviate it, the report recommended (with no sense of irony, it seems) the building of “a virtual cordon” around the city, that is, a system of interlinked, limited-access highways that would intercept traffic from the surrounding suburbs and deliver it quickly to the city center. The first piece of this “virtual cordon,” the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway, intensified the assault on Olmsted’s Front that the Peace Bridge had tentatively begun in 1926. Apart from the lost acreage—by 1957 successive takings had reduced the park’s original fifty acres to a remnant twenty—the Thruway destroyed the Front’s very raison d’être by severing it utterly and irremediably from the water. The “broad prospect over the lake” that Olmsted had meant to secure forever to the public, the “interesting view of the Niagara River and the Canadian Frontier” that he had so admired, was now a noisome tangle of traffic lanes, access ramps, tollbooths, and parking lots.15 “The Front is now but a shell of the park it used to be,” the Buffalo Evening News lamented in 1957, and they might have said the same of Riverside Park a few years later, when the Niagara Thruway tore through it also and made a dismal mockery of its very name.16 “Thruwayside Park” would henceforth have been more apt. On its completion in 1959, the Niagara Thruway joined Buffalo to Niagara Falls and so (for a little while, anyway) eased the burden of traffic congestion north to south along the Niagara River. But it did nothing to help the frustrated commuters of the fast-growing eastern suburbs, and in 1953, before the Thruway even opened, the City Planning Commission called for the construction of five “circumferential” and crosstown arteries to complete the cordon and overlay it at critical choke points from east to west. It was one of these arteries that finally spelled doom for Delaware Park, where as far as the commissioners could tell, the right of way was “predominantly vacant.”17 Strung violently together, the Scajaquada Parkway and the North Meadow carriage drive in the park became, in 1954, the Scajaquada Expressway, a four-lane divided highway complete with cloverleaf entrance and exit ramps on what had once been the quiet meeting point of the Meadow Park and Gala Water. Already bisected north to south by Delaware Avenue, the\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 29\n\nFigure 1.5 Olmsted’s Front, now Front Park, as mangled by the Niagara Thruway and the tollbooth approaches to the Peace Bridge, circa 1969.

Butler Library, SUNY Buffalo State.\n\npark was now fully drawn and quartered, cut into pieces by asphalt and concrete, its pastoral tranquillity permanently lost to the roar of modern traffic. But of the many insults that Olmsted’s art was to suffer in the twentieth century, the destruction of Humboldt Parkway, the exquisite tree-lined avenue that he and Vaux had designed to link the Park to the Parade, was, in the authoritative view of Francis Kowsky, “the most egregious.”18 With its six stately rows of linden and tulip trees, its wide strips of green turf, and its elegant carriageways, Humboldt Parkway had come to be admired as one of the most beautiful streets in America. “Many a European city would envy Buffalo for her wide, spacious avenues bordered by such beautiful trees,” Walter Behrendt had noted in 1937, and Humboldt Parkway in particular impressed him as reminiscent of the Bois de Boulogne.19 But where Behrendt saw Parisian elegance the City Planning Commission, again, saw only vacancy—vacancy and an opportunity to build an eastside equivalent of the Niagara Thruway and connect downtown to the eastern vicinities of the Buffalo Municipal Airport. The bulldozers arrived in 1958, and Olmsted’s finest\n\n30 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nparkway fell victim to progress in the form of the Kensington Expressway, a monstrous, six-lane, concrete canyon designed simply to carry thirty-five thousand automobiles a day at unimpeded high speed to and from downtown and the northeastern suburbs. Not that the city planners and urban renewalists who perpetrated this “heinous act of urbicide,” as the biographer of Buffalo Mark Goldman describes it, would have thought of it as such.20 In all their plans and promotional brochures, they carefully render the Kensington Expressway as just another form of greenway, more sleek and modern than the Humboldt Parkway, perhaps, but consistent with its contours and still somehow pastoral, even idyllic in aspect. When the city expressed some concern over the possible effect of the Kensington on nearby property values, the district state engineers assured them that with its “gently-sloping, landscaped grades seeded and shrubbed,” the expressway, far from having a deleterious effect, would be an aesthetic improvement on the woodsy mess that had been there before.21 Whether they actually believed that or not is hard to say, but if they did, they could not possibly have been more misguided. As Goldman puts it: “No one\n\nFigure 1.6 Olmsted’s Humboldt Parkway in the late 1950s—still elegant on the eve of its destruction.

Courtesy of the Buffalo History Museum, used by permission.\n\nwho remembers the serene beauty of Fredrick [sic] Law Olmsted’s parkway can understand how public officials charged with protecting the public trust could have conceived and then executed a plan so devastating in scale.”22 The truth is, though, that when the bulldozers arrived in the winter of 1958, few people thought of the Humboldt as “Frederick Law Olmsted’s parkway”—not the commissioners who condemned it, nor the engineers who destroyed it, nor even the few lonely neighborhood activists who tried\n\n32 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nvaliantly to save it. They thought of it as distinctive, perhaps, an unusually wide and woodsy thoroughfare through what had by then become a predominantly African American neighborhood. But in none of the letters to the editor expressing misgivings over this brutal act of “improvement” does anyone invoke the Olmsted name or legacy. Both had simply faded from civic memory, taking Humboldt Parkway along with them. The two parks it had linked, Humboldt Park and Delaware Park, were still there, of course, and even in their degraded and dilapidated state somewhat loved. But they were not thought of as “Olmsted” parks. The very naturalness of their appearance, together with “the persistent mental opposition of nature and city,” had, as Anne Whiston Spirn argues, “gradually eroded the memory of Olmsted’s contribution” and turned his parks into vacant spaces vulnerable to aggressive appropriation.23 To save what was left would require recalling the art and artist to mind and so turning the Buffalo parks into precious relics of “the Olmsted heritage.”\n\nThe Olmsted Renaissance The origins of what we might call the Olmsted heritage industry lie at the intersection of historic preservation and environmentalism, two related responses to the destructive tendencies of unrestrained economic growth that emerged in tandem in the United States from the mid-1960s. Both of course had roots reaching back to the Romantic era and beyond. But it took the wholesale demolitions of postwar urban renewal to turn the genteel inclination of civic nostalgia into the preservationist movement, just as it took the indiscriminate deployment of petrochemical pesticides to turn a conventional love of nature into the environmental movement. The nearsimultaneous publications of Jane Jacob’s Death and Life of Great American Cities in 1961 and Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962 may be taken as precursory of the conjoined concerns that were to culminate legislatively in the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 and the establishment of Earth Day in 1970. And Olmsted, as it happened, spoke to them both. In Olmsted, devotees of Jane Jacobs suddenly found an earlier prophet of urban vibrancy, even as those roused to indignation by Rachel Carson found something of an urban ecologist. In the context of the late 1960s, his was an eminently serviceable aesthetic that caught the progressive spirit of the time. The more direct stimulus to what came to be known as “Olmsted-mania” came from the sesquicentennial commemoration of his birth in 1972. Here, the decisive events were two major retrospectives of his work, one at the\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 33\n\nWhitney Museum in New York and one at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, both conceived by William Alex, an architectural historian who had stumbled on Olmsted unexpectedly while designing an exhibit on Back Bay for Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. Together with the accompanying catalogs, Alex’s retrospectives and what they represented “hit a responsive chord,” as David Grayson Allen has put it, and led to profiles of Olmsted and his parks in newspapers and magazines across the country.24 The same year saw the inception of the monumental (and still ongoing) Frederick Law Olmsted Papers Project under the general editorship of Charles McLaughlin, followed closely by the first definitive biography, Laura Wood Roper’s FLO.25 There would soon be several more. But already by 1972 one scholar was speaking in terms of “the Olmsted Renaissance” and describing this hitherto obscure reporter-turned-landscape architect as “a major figure in the American experience—comparable, on numerous levels, to such persons as William Penn, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin.”26 This was heady (if somewhat arbitrary) company, and it did not immediately convince. In an otherwise laudatory review of Roper’s biography, the eminent urban historian Sam Bass Warner queried its central claim that Olmsted spoke to our own time. His parks were antiquated, grandmotherly affairs, Warner argued, suitable for a genteel promenade or a decorous picnic, perhaps, but wholly unsuited to the boisterous place that America had become. “We are escaping a different city; we are in search of a different Mother Nature,” Warner concluded. But the true believers were not to be dissuaded. As recently as 1966, the curmudgeonly architectural critic Henry Hope Reed had fretted that Olmsted was “not a household word,” even in New York. Six years later, his name was inescapable, in educated households at least, and Olmsted was well on his way to inspiring a new movement for urban park reclamation.27 In Buffalo, an early intimation of the Olmsted revival came in 1963, when Robert Traynham Coles, a young disciple of Jane Jacobs who had studied urban planning and architecture at MIT, invoked his name in honoring “the great treed boulevards” that once formed “a cultural arc” from the Museum of Science north to Delaware Park and then south to Symphony Circle and Kleinhans Music Hall. “But parks and parkways are useless to people who are immersed in the automobile age,” he mourned, even as the bulldozers toppled the trees outside his home at 321 Humboldt Parkway.28 Earlier that same year, a group of concerned citizens in Parkside, the curvilinear suburb that Olmsted had designed for a private land company in 1874, formed the Parkside Community Association in hopes of slowing the pace of white flight from what had by then become a racially mixed neighborhood. How\n\n34 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\naware they were of Olmsted at the time is unclear. In their minds, Parkside was not a heritage landscape but their home, a robust, vibrant, living community that they meant to protect from unscrupulous, blockbusting real estate agents. Over time, however, as they became by necessity more alert to the distinctive design qualities of Parkside, the members of the association increasingly attached them to Olmsted’s name and deployed their pedigree against the threat of neighborhood disruption. At Parkside in Buffalo, the Olmsted heritage and grassroots community organizing found their first heartfelt but also mutually convenient union.29 Just south of Parkside, Delaware Park itself, once the pastoral pride of the Buffalo park system, the park that Olmsted had once expected to “take a more and more distinguished position among the parks of the world,” had by now fallen into a truly pitiable state.30 A 1958 proposal to drop yet one more arterial, the laughably named “Delaware Park Shortway,” down on the north side of the meadow happily foundered. But the Scajaquada Expressway went in as planned, and on its opening in 1962 left the park a\n\nFigure 1.8 Aerial view of Delaware Park Lake and the Scajaquada Expressway, 1961.

Butler Library, SUNY Buffalo State.\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 35\n\nmangled mess. Stormwater and sewage runoff into Scajaquada Creek had long since fouled Delaware Park Lake (Olmsted’s “Gala Water”), and in 1958 the Erie County Health Department declared it a health hazard and closed it to public use. Parking lots, garages, zoo extensions, and other so-called noncontributing structures continued to proliferate across the park and deny its visitors—the few that still ventured it—that “sense of enlarged freedom” that Olmsted had promised. Dirty, degraded, and dangerous, Delaware Park was by 1968 a broken and abandoned shell of its former self, a sad testament, as the Buffalo Courier-Express finally noted, to the price of automotive progress.31 Into this sorry shell stepped a group of citizen activists called the Delaware Park Steering Committee. Prodded by Delaware District Councilman William B. Hoyt, the Buffalo Department of Community Development released in July 1973, at the height of the Olmsted renaissance, a master plan that finally recognized the historical significance of Delaware Park and promised both to “improve [its] position as a significant recreational and cultural facility” and “restore [it] to its original conception as a facility of excellence and beauty.”32 The steering committee came together soon afterward so that this “framework for park restoration,” as they understood it, “would not join other city ‘master plans’ on a dusty shelf.”33 It included among its members city officials, legislators, and neighborhood activists, some of whom knew who Olmsted was and even gestured toward his philosophy. But the committee was not a heritage society. It was an advocacy group motivated above all by a sense that Buffalo’s parks were unmaintained and underfunded and thus failing to meet even the most basic civic need. By the early 1970s, the jogging craze had come to Buffalo, and some of the members of the Delaware Park Steering Committee simply wanted a safe and reasonably green space in which to run. The real stimulus to the Olmsted heritage industry in Buffalo came a little later, in 1977, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the newly elected US senator from New York and a self-professed “Olmsted nut,” proposed to established an Urban Federal Parks Commission that would pay particular attention to the country’s Olmsted inheritance.34 Moynihan had grown up in New York, knew Central Park well, and had taken a special interest in parks as chief of Richard Nixon’s Council of Urban Affairs in the late 1960s. In Buffalo, his talk of an Urban Federal Parks Commission got the attention of Joan Bozer, a preservation-minded Erie County legislator, and Francis Kowsky, an architectural historian at Buffalo State College, who with a few others came together in 1978 to form the Buffalo Friends of Olmsted Parks. The full unfolding that same year of the Love Canal disaster in nearby Niagara Falls\n\n36 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nwas a tragic coincidence. But insofar as it thrust the Buffalo-Niagara region to the national forefront of the environmental movement, it strengthened local interest in urban reclamation and, by association, the organized citizens’ defense of the Olmsted parks. The founding supposition of the Buffalo Friends was that while the city’s 1973 master plan had done well to identify the glaring deficiencies of Delaware Park, it had failed to address “the continuing erosion of the Olmsted design.” The Olmsted park system was, “without exaggeration,” the Friends believed, “the most important thing ever built in Buffalo, historically, artistically, and culturally,” and Delaware Park was its centerpiece. Any changes to the park, therefore, had to consider its “historic integrity,” the Friends insisted, had to consider “Olmsted’s original design and intention,” as well as the park’s significance to the larger city park system. “The Friends are committed to the preservation, restoration and enhancement of the system,” one of their memoranda said. “The quality of the Olmsted design, its subtle separation of uses, its beauty and breadth, and its enduring contribution to the quality of life of this city—is an unmatched and invaluable legacy,” they asserted, and it was in hopes of preserving that legacy that they began to work toward placing the entire Buffalo park system on the National Register of Historic Places.35 Over at city hall, Elizabeth Blum, chair of the Delaware Park Steering Committee, was immediately apprehensive. Though not insensitive to the Olmstedian origin of Delaware Park, she and her members were more present- than past-minded. They wanted the park restored and reclaimed for current use and worried that any sort of historic designation would be, toward that end, counterproductive. “ ‘You can’t think of this park as a museum,’ ” she wrote, borrowing from Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, the new Central Park administrator. “ ‘You would not like to rebuild it as a Victorian period piece. It has to be useful to a huge variety of constituencies.’ ”36 For their part, the Buffalo Friends of Olmsted conceded the point, and once satisfied that placement on the National Register would not impede badly needed repairs and renovations, the Delaware Park Steering Committee got behind it. But its membership remained somewhat wary of the Buffalo Friends and their tendency to worship uncritically at the altar of “Saint Olmsted.” And the truth is that the effect of “historic place” designation, in Buffalo as elsewhere, was to over-identify the parks with the great man. Parks are big things. They require a massive collaborative effort on the part of designers, architects, arborists, horticulturalists, hydrologists, engineers, and accountants, not to mention (in the case of Central Park, for instance), thousands of earth-moving laborers over a period of twenty years. But the heritage\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 37\n\nindustry does not easily accommodate such nebulous collaborations. It likes things tightly attributable. One criterion for listing a cultural landscape on the National Register of Historic Places requires that it either “embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction” or that it “represent the work of a master that possesses high artistic values, or that represents a distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction.”37 Olmsted is that requisite “master.” He is that “distinguishable entity” that makes the parks eligible for inclusion on the National Register. But he is also, to that extent, something of a romantic fiction, a cultural construction in his own right. As Bruce Kelly puts it, “Olmsted has become a generic term, symbolizing the teams of men whom he supervised and the work which he so ably administered.”38 In preparing its nomination of the Buffalo park system to the National Register of Historic Places, the Landmark Society of the Niagara Frontier was at least careful to acknowledge the essential contributions of Olmsted’s senior partner Calvert Vaux and several other “key people on the ground,” including George Kent Radford, the chief engineer, and William McMillan, the general superintendent of the parks from 1870 to 1897.39 But the nomination is on behalf of the “Olmsted Park and Parkway System,” and over time the key collaborators (with the partial exception of Vaux) faded into obscurity as the generic heritage took hold. The Buffalo Friends of the Olmsted Parks were a critical influence here. In June 1979, as the National Register nomination was under way, they sponsored a one-day conference featuring Moynihan himself and the idea of a “National Olmsted Historic Park System.” One might have expected such a thing to emanate out of New York or Boston, but in fact it was in Buffalo a year later that delegates from New York, Boston, Detroit, Hartford, Newark, Seattle, Washington, Chicago, and many other cities convened to establish the National Association of Olmsted Parks. Here, finally, was a point of pride for a city that, as Mark Goldman writes, had by 1980 become “almost morbidly obsessed with traumas of unemployment.” Buffalo was a “city in search of a function,” as Goldman puts it, so it was somehow both consoling and fitting when the Olmsted park system went on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, just in time for the celebration of the city’s sesquicentennial.40\n\nThe Olmsted City Anyone who imagined that placement on the National Register would prevent further encroachment on the local Olmsted legacy was soon disillusioned when the Buffalo Board of Education decided to build a $12 million\n\n38 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nmagnet school alongside the science museum in Martin Luther King Jr. Park. Never very big to begin with, “the Parade” (as it once was) had already been sorely compromised and to some did not seem any longer worth fighting for. But the Buffalo Friends saw sacred ground at stake and, with the support of private donors and a National Trust Preservation Services Grant, at once filed suit in the State Supreme Court seeking a permanent injunction against construction. Initially sympathetic, the New York State Historic Preservation Office ultimately withdrew support from the Friends in light of neighborhood support for the school. The case was one that awkwardly pitted historic preservation against school desegregation, and in April 1986 United States District Judge John Thomas Curtin ruled in favor of the school board. The Friends took the loss philosophically. True, a few more precious acres of Olmsted landscape had succumbed to bricks and mortar, but the prolonged lawsuit had brought them much-needed publicity and even in defeat represented their coming of age as a fighting organization.41 The close identification of Buffalo with its Olmsted heritage received encouragement in another quarter, meanwhile, when in 1986—the same year as the Friends’ defeat over the magnet school—the buildings and grounds of the former Buffalo State Insane Asylum won shared designation as a National Historic Landmark—the highest heritage classification that a site can receive. Both Richardson’s buildings and Olmsted’s and Vaux’s grounds were by then in a lamentable condition—the buildings either demolished or abandoned and the grounds cluttered with all manner of service roads and parking lots. More than half the original asylum grounds had long since been lost to the artlessly utilitarian campus of Buffalo State Teacher’s College (now SUNY College at Buffalo) and much of the rest built over with modern substitutes for Richardson’s monumental but antiquated asylum wards. Enough green scraps remained, though, to justify a case for historical integrity, especially in topographical association with nearby Delaware Park. Olmsted himself had always regarded the asylum grounds as part of an arcadian ensemble that included the Park and Forest Lawn Cemetery, and from the early 1980s this worked to the asylum’s advantage, strengthening its claim to historic significance and national landmark status. Neither made it immune to further encroachment. In 1988, in fact, just two years after the asylum’s landmark designation, the Buffalo Psychiatric Center built a twenty-four-bed inpatient facility called, ironically, “the Olmsted Residence,” that severely compromised the parklike character of the southwest corner of the grounds. But the worst of this sort of thing was over. As Kowsky observes, “by the mid-1980s the entire landscape of North Buffalo with which Olmsted and Vaux had been associated enjoyed national recognition of its significance and\n\n“ Th e Olm s t e d C i ty ” 39\n\npossessed some degree of state and federal protection from further erosion of its historic character.”42 Local recognition, though, still lagged behind. A public survey conducted in 1990 found that while 83 percent of Buffalo’s adults visited the city parks at least once a year, over half of them were unfamiliar with the name of Frederick Law Olmsted and unaware of the distinctive nature of the Buffalo park system.43 By now, city managers emphatically wanted to change this. “The system is cited nationally in historical accounts, is the subject of attention from scholars, planners, and park professionals, and, if treated properly, could re-define the city’s image away from one of steel mills and toward one more reflective of its present day reality and likely future,” the Buffalo Environmental Management Commission asserted hopefully in 1989.44 But such redefinition was beyond the meager resources of the city parks department, and in 1992, inspired by the success of the Central Park Conservancy in raising public awareness of and commitment to the Olmsted legacy in New York, the Buffalo Friends proposed to establish the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy, a nonprofit, independent, community organization dedicated to promoting, preserving, restoring, and enhancing the Olmsted parks and parkways in the greater Buffalo area. On their own, as an independent advocacy group, the Friends had had some success in protecting what was left of the parks. The idea now was to work in partnership with the city to manage and maintain them and to promote them nationally as an essential part of Buffalo’s civic identity. The dockyards and steel mills that had made Buffalo what it once was were gone. But in their place was a unique parks system that offered “vast potential for community revitalization, tourism development and economic expansion for the area.”45 In this forward-looking spirit, the Buffalo Friends in 1994 commissioned a “Tourism Market Opportunities” report that explicitly promoted the Olmsted parks as a commercial resource. “In terms of tourism product demand, there is an increased interest in traditional values, nostalgia and history,” the report somewhat cynically argued. “Heritage tourism” and “nature-based tourism” were both growing segments of the travel market, and Buffalo was well positioned in both respects if it could link its Olmsted parks to other historic and natural attractions in the area, especially Niagara Falls, where, as it happened, another Olmsted-and-Vaux-designed landscape served as a pastoral complement to the sublimity of the cataract and river gorge. The millions of annual visitors to Niagara Falls were just the sort of “nature and cultural tourism-based visitors” that Buffalo wanted to attract, but most lingered for only a day before moving on to Toronto. The hope now was to capture some of these tourists for Buffalo by promoting the Olmsted parks\n\n40 C ha pt e r\n\n1\n\nas a major “heritage asset” of the Greater Buffalo-Niagara Region.46 Thus the reasoning, just a few years later, behind that unlikely welcoming sign on the Niagara Thruway with which I began. The idea was to lure some of those hurtling on toward Niagara Falls to linger in Buffalo and take in an Olmsted park or two en route. It has not really worked. Despite its new moniker as “the Olmsted City,” Buffalo still brings rust and snow mostly to the outside mind, and it remains a second-tier tourist destination at best. But raised awareness locally of the Olmsted parks has undoubtedly played a part in the overall urban revival that has many speaking of Buffalo as the new Brooklyn.47 In 2004, in a landmark agreement with the city, the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy assumed primary management responsibility for the park and parkway system and set out to restore it to its once-prominent place at the heart of civic consciousness. The most ambitious elements of its comprehensive restoration plan remain largely visionary.48 But all over Buffalo, even small-scale restoration and the value of the Olmsted “brand” have proved their worth to adjacent neighborhoods and brought genteel park enthusiasts and radical community organizers together in a novel and potent way. Thus in 2015 (partly in response to the death of a child struck by a car traveling at high speed through\n\nFigure 1.9 Mayor Anthony M.

Source: Tony James and the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy.\n\nDelaware Park) the state Department of Transportation begrudgingly began to convert the Scajaquada Expressway into what they claim will eventually be a low-speed urban boulevard. And one year later, under pressure from an eastside citizens’ group called the Restore our Community Coalition, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced a $6 million feasibility study of the idea of covering the Kensington Expressway and restoring above at least a portion of the now fabled Humboldt Parkway.49 Neither Olmsted enthusiasts nor neighborhood activists are satisfied by such half measures. Both would like the see the offending expressways further downgraded or removed altogether. And increasingly they are not alone. According to the New York Times, the Scajaquada is “not just a local barrier” but also “a poster road” for a growing movement of progressive urban planners who want to replace downtown highways with pedestrianfriendly streets that actually connect neighborhoods and residents.50 How far they will ultimately succeed in redeeming Olmsted’s faith in “the best planned city in the world” remains very much to be seen. But at a time when environmentalists have suddenly rediscovered the American city, his is proving a broad appeal and the best claim Buffalo might yet have on the national imagination.\n\nCh a p ter 2\n\nThe Peace Bridge and the Rhetoric of Hospitality at the US-Canada Border Peter H. Christensen\n\nIn 1927 the Peace Bridge, traversing the Niagara River and connecting Buffalo, New York, and Fort Erie, Ontario, was inaugurated, celebrating one hundred years of peace between the United States and Canada.1 The official rhetoric around the bridge’s construction in both the United States and Canada was exalted and lofty, stressing the themes of neighborliness and hospitality that these two nations, today sharing a border of 5,525 miles—the longest international border in the world—had embraced for a century as friends, both politically and culturally.2 A poem by Elijah Holt, a local Buffalo lawyer and amateur poet,3 commissioned for the bridge’s inauguration, is representative of the occasion: Conceived and built by nations twain; Born of the will and brawn and brain Of both their peoples, looming high O’er common waters, one more tie ’Twixt those whose friendship ne’er shall cease; We christen Thee “The Bridge of Peace.” These peoples of a kindred race, Who met each other face to face Upon the free and lasting way Of Thy broad road, where naught shall stay 42\n\nTh e P e ace B r i d g e a n d t h e Rh e to r ic o f H o s p i tali ty 43\n\nThy welcome passage, they have seen Peace in its workings and its dream. Holt’s romantic portrayal of the bond of US-Canada relations nevertheless glossed over a more complicated geopolitical relationship between the two nations, one that while ostensibly peaceful for a century, bore witness to the emergence of a cultural juxtaposition that the Peace Bridge served to both thwart and emphasize at one and the same time, all within a rhetorical framework of hospitality. The Peace Bridge would become the largest single crossing between the United States and Canada, where the net value of goods cleared on both sides topped that of any international crossing in the world.4 The city of Buffalo, in particular, became the staging ground for the cultural component of this encounter. Hospitality, as a distinct political concept, has its origins in the Enlightenment, most notably in Immanuel Kant’s Perpetual Peace.5 In his text, Kant lays the foundation for democratic peace theory by advocating policies on war, the formation of a military, debt, treason, interference, and other topics, a theory that ultimately rests on a fundamental respect for state sovereignty, the ability to reconcile after a disagreement, and a cosmopolitan ethic of hospitality, in which neighbors respect one another and offer a generous reception when they visit one another. The nature of this hospitality was further explored by Jacques Derrida when he distinguished between an “absolute hospitality” and “the law of hospitality as right or duty.”6 The latter, as Gillian Roberts argues, “underscores the power of the host, meaning that the host does not genuinely ‘give place’ to the stranger who remains as a guest, bound by the conditions outlined by Kant.”7 Roberts makes the observation that “the casual phrase one might utter to one’s guest, ‘Make yourself at home,’ ” is rarely meant to be taken literally and thus is not an absolute hospitality but rather hospitality as a duty. The line between absolute hospitality and hospitality as duty is often thin, particularly if you genuinely like your guest. Whereas Buddhist and Hindu cultures have what may be conceived as a culture of “absolute hospitality,” Judeo-Christian culture has developed along the lines of hospitality as a right and a duty.8 This would mean that there is a legacy in the West of a rhetoric of hospitality that is not accompanied by a genuine giving of place. This does not mean that the rhetoric is empty; it merely signifies its function as a cue of the ethical respect for sovereignty, irrespective of personal feelings. The philosopher Lorraine Code has described the subtle nature of USCanadian cultural relations, noting how even a discussion of the differences between the two nations “invites an impatient insistence that the similarities\n\n44 C ha pt e r\n\n2\n\nFigure 2.1 H.
