Sammi Brie (she/her • t • c)\n\n@Sammi Brie: There are only 62 pages containing these links. But they are turning out out to be very hard to automate. They have bot detection, and require JavaScipt enabled to view the PDF, and that requires a headless browser for a bot. I'm going to recommend these be done manually will be more accurate. If it was thousands I would try to develop a custom system to automate around the blocks with a headless browser and VPN IP skipping, but for 62 pages I am going to pass on that level of work, easier done manually. Below is the list of pages. -- GreenC\n\n2100 articles reference astronautix.com which changed its whole website structure at some point (2016-2018). Now all old links redirect to a 404 page. The articles are still online but there is no fixed URL replacement pattern. The articles are generally archived at web.archive.org if the access is no later than March 2016, about 1000 articles already reference an archived version from there. Can a bot add archive links in the remaining articles? Basically this type of edit over 1000 times. Links that follow the pattern \"astronautix.com/[a-z]/\" were added after the restructuring and should still be available. If someone has a way to find the current page (example for the Moon landing) that's even better, but we still need an archived version as the website isn't maintained any more and might disappear any moment. --mfb (talk)"
