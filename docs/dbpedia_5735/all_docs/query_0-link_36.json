        "text": "http://celticartstudio.com/shop/leather_journals/\n\nA 5”x7” leather journal that is completely handmade, from the inside and out, being sold for a mere $38.00 online. It is a product sold by a company known as Poetic Earth, who has been partnered with a private group of journal crafters for almost 150 years. The journals are made from vegetable tanned leather, which is known to soften with age and use, while also laying completely flat for optimum writing capability thanks to the Coptic laced binding. Even the inside pages are praised for being handmade, acid free, high quality linen-cotton parchment paper. Poetic Earth claims, “Our journals contain premium quality handmade linen parchment that passes the most strict of PH – acidity marker test. The environmentally friendly paper is wonderful for all types of media such as water colors, fountain pens or any type of pencils and ball point pens,” which are all intriguing qualities and claims that any artist or writer would love to test. In addition, the cover design called In the Celtic Tree of Life was created by famous Welsh artist Jen Delyth, who describes the meaning of her artwork and the depth of the Celtic culture in various forms. In this instance, “the interlacing branches symbolize belief in the Continuity of Life; the cosmos in the form of a tree whose roots grow deep in the ground, branches reaching high into the heavens, expressing the inter-connection of all living things.” The whole design extends around the cover, from the front that dons the Tree of Life, to the various related symbols on the spin and flap, to the back that displays The World Tree.\n\nThe Tree of Life is a precious and well-known symbol that transcends time and culture, although still a major Celtic philosophy and spirituality, the meaning and mythology are known around the world today (thanks in large part to Jen Delyth). It is no secret that the, “Druids had their teaching centers in the midst of Oak groves, and the words for wood and wisdom are similar (Welsh gwydd and gwyddon). The Celtic Druids, priestesses and healer-women encoded their deep knowledge of trees and herbs into an ancient cryptic Tree alphabet – an Ogham cipher — Beth Luis-Nuin. The ‘Tree of Life’ is an esoteric philosophy common to many cultures and mythologies. The Ancients envisioned the entire cosmos in the form of a tree whose roots grow deep in the ground, branches reaching high into the heavens. Also known as the World Tree, the primal Mother Tree was regarded as all-nourishing, all-giving, involved in the creation of the universe and the origin of the first man and woman.”\n\nhttp://www.celticartstudio.com/index.php?page=symbol&category=SYMBOLS&from=84&display=64\n\nThe World Tree, also referred to as Yggdrasil in the Celtic language, is famous in Norse Mythology as, “the Giant Ash tree that links and connects all the known worlds, the earth below, and the heaven above.” The Yggdrasil is the center, or axis, where the Universe was created, surrounded by the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Fate and the Tree of the Universe. “Three roots connect the World Tree to the three wells that flow beneath. The Well of Mimir whose waters are the source of all wisdom, the Well of Fate – Urdarbrunnr, guarded by the Norns, the Well of Hvergelmir – Roaring Kettlle, the source of many rivers that nourish life. The World Tree is a symbol common to many societies. Within Celtic tradition, the Great Oak tree is most revered, and the Druids are said to have worshipped amongst the ancient groves.”\n\nJen Delyth also uses the Tree of Life symbol as her logo for her online website, where her other Celtic artworks and products are sold through an organization called Celtic Art Studios, which she helped establish with poet and spoken word performer Chris Chandler. She gains much of her inspiration from the folklore and nature that surrounds the Celt traditions and culture, “but woven through her experience and vision as a woman of the twenty-first century.” She was the first to put an image to the Tree of Life philosophy in 1989, when she came out with her “Celtic Tree of Life” illustration. Since then, she has made a vast contribution to spreading artwork and knowledge that emphasis and capture the essence of Celtic philosophy, tradition, and life.\n\nThe artist herself, born in the Welsh borderlands of the Wye valley in 1962, was taught most of what she knows through her parents and through her childhood endeavors in various towns and villages of Wales. In her own words, “I was fortunate that we explored many wonderful ancient places, full of history and resonance that inspired and formed me as I was growing up. It often seemed as though the land itself was haunted by the long-ago people, and I could sense the mythic quality of things even as a young child.” She recalls a lot of her influence coming from her parents, as well, crediting her mother Mair Jones for first exposing her to Celtic mythology through Welsh folk songs and traditions. In regard to her father, Fred Clough, he had a strong interest in rhetoric and often encouraged his daughter to write and travel, “to learn from experience in addition to developing craft and technique.”\n\nJen Delyth went on to Southampton University to major in philosophy and since then has become a self-taught artist, who is still exploring, traveling, and discovering. She began her personal studies on the island of Korcula, Croatia in 1984; beginning with experimentation in photography. Eventually, photography would take her to London, Egypt, Crete, and Jerusalem as a freelance worker until she settled in San Francisco, California. Around 1987, she would establish the Dryad Graphicsfirm, which was the first business to merge freeform Celtic artwork, symbols and patterns, with computer technology and bring the essence of the culture into the twenty-first century. In 1988, she met famous Welsh artist John Uzzell Edwards during an art show at Swansea University, which would launch her into a new area of study with paints. Her work with paint is impressive because unlike most artists, she works with natural pigments, like egg tempera, which was a medium once used by the ancient Egyptians, so is not often seen in use today. Now the artist continues to bring more Celtic designs alive through Ninth Wave Publishing LLC., which operates the Celtic Art Studios online store. She continues to paint and design, as well as write, while also appearing at shows and galleries to present her work whenever she can, but her focus remains the same.\n\nIn general, Jen Delyth has become quite successful, while also being known for her accomplishments in, “symmetry of form and symbol that expresses living archetypes. Her work is stylistically contemporary, iconographic, reflecting spiritual and philosophical roots which embody universal themes that reflect her love of nature and Celtic symbolism.” Additionally, her work has made a way onto and into books such as Celtic Way of Seeing by Frank MacEowen and Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend by Miranda Green, Celtic Crafts: The Living Tradition and New Visions in Celtic Art by David James, as well as her own hardcopy illustrations called Celtic Mandala that were published through Amber Lotus Publishing. Further still, she has other miscellaneous business endeavors that she works with to debut her handcrafts and continues to create digital and traditional artworks for future viewing, from DVD’s to art galleries to published books. Yet to the artist herself, “For me it is the creativity and rhythm, the power of the symbols beneath the work that are most important. Although I am not affiliated with any particular branch of Celtic spirituality, my work often focuses on an expression of my deep love and respect of nature and all its Mystery. The Celtic tradition expresses a wealth of wisdom and understanding of the natural world – of plants and animals, and also the inner world of active imagination and our psyche. Working with the patterns, sacred images and myths of the ancient Celts renews my connection between the past and the present, the inside and outside, the seen and the unseen. Life in all its Mystery and interconnectedness, through art and story.”\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Jen Delyth.” Celtic Art Studio. Ninth Wave Publishing LLC., July 2012.

The initial restaurant was called Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck and was first brought to Kent State University in Ohio by two young men, James Disbrow and Scott Lowery. It was a business venture that the two never thought would expand, but as their business became profitable, their corporate identity took on a transformation that is widely recognized today.\n\nIt began with James Disbrow in 1981, when he went to Kent State University in Ohio to judge a figure skating competition. In the meantime, his friend and younger brother, Scott Lowery, met with him for lunch. The two were in the mood for Buffalo-style chicken wings, but there were no restaurants around that served them. For Disbrow, this hatched the idea to open their own restaurant, which not only served chicken wings, but specialized in them. So, in 1982, the Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck restaurant debuted in Columbus, Ohio near the aforementioned college campus, where the menu was all about “barbecued chicken wings with a choice of a dozen sauces and beef sandwiches served on kimmelweck buns”. Interestingly enough, the ‘weck’ in the restaurant name comes from those kimmelweck buns, which are a German roll sprinkled in caraway seeds and kosher salt; another one of their former specialties.\n\nThe Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck restaurant would become a hit, especially with the college crowd, who began to dub the joint the title of BW3; an adopted abbreviation of their name after a time. A few months after their debut, the brothers would accept another member into their business named Mark Lutz, and their endeavor would continue. Whenever the trio had the funds, it went toward a new restaurant. Soon, the three would have six additional Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck that where located in Ohio, Indiana, and Colorado. Unfortunately, none of these guys were business men with a vast knowledge in funding because their finances were a mess from the beginning, although somehow the trio was doing well enough to transform their small town restaurants into a franchise.\n\nAround 1991, discussions of a franchise ensued with a law firm based in Chicago known as Francorp, and soon the business would double their amount of locations. Eventually, the name would also change from Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck to Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar, where their main theme directed towards more of a sports bar feel for their targeted college age audience and offered a bill around five or six dollars. As their name changed, so did their restaurant and logo. The menu still featured the chicken wings, but with a larger range of sauces from mild to extreme and another large section for beers as the specialties.\n\nIn 1995, James Disbrow would hire another member known as Sally Smith to their team, where her expertise was in financial matters. She took on the title of Chief Financial Officer and “undertook a complete overhaul” of their business funds, which were considered to be “in a state of chaos”. Thanks to her, Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar was able to maintain the franchise and further expansion, so she was honored the title of president and CEO of the company. Working with Disbrow, the chain grew to a little more than 75 restaurants in various locations, noticed a large increase in profits, and were now able to market the franchise and their products to the public. The special sauces were now available for the public to buy, so everyone could enjoy the restaurant cuisine in their own homes. On top of that, the advertising campaign established slogans like “Eat, drink, and be messy”, along with, “Be on a first-name basis with your dry cleaner” to promote their hands-on specialties while dismissing the name of BW3 entirely and shortening the name for a more permanent and memorable title: Buffalo Wild Wings. The name would become official in 1999.\n\nIn 2001 and 2002, advertising became essential, along with developing and selling new sauces in conjunction with other food brands such as Frito-Lay. Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar now had a new slogan, “Wings, Beer, Sports. All the essentials.” In addition to that, takeout became another huge asset to the company, accounting for a good chunk in sales. Unfortunately, James Disbrow passed away on October 16, 2002 from a brain tumor, so the business is now run by Sally Smith (who was already in control of the company) and Scott Lowery, who has become her vice-president.\n\nRecently, on July 11, 2012, the franchise announced another revamp of the restaurant and logo. The corporate identity of Buffalo Wild Wings has taken on quite a few changes, but these are the least extensive. Originally, before the company became a franchise, the atmosphere of the restaurant was a lot more casual and simple, while the logo looked more like a bottle cap with a clear outline of a bull and the renowned abbreviation BW3 on it. The colors were muted, except for some red lettering and the specialty was clear. Once the business became a franchise, the atmosphere became louder and more carefree, while the logo was modernized. The curves were softened and the edges sharpened; the colors popped out in black, white, and yellow; and the typography went hand in hand with their symbol.\n\nNow, the restaurant maintains that sports atmosphere with their waiters and waitresses dressed in state jerseys, wide range of alcohol and chicken wings on their menu, as well as the million television displays all set on sports inside the restaurant. On the other hand, the bill at the end of the night tends to be a little higher now, since the company has widened their target audience from college students to older. Fortunately, there are specials and deals for their beer and chicken wings.\n\nThe logo is also different, but only slightly. Instead of the symbol and typography being united, the symbol has been separated; donning a circle for itself. The colors remain the same, except for accents of gray, and the direction of the horn has been shifted, as well as some other curves. All in all, the change is minor for their symbol. In addition, the text has been simplified, developed, and stacked. The curve of the wing matches each curve of the letters, which are capitalized to be as bold as the bull, and although the name has been shortened to Buffalo Wild Wings, their name has included the tagline of “Wings. Beer. Sports.”\n\nThe company is still seeing more changes, but the story still remains the same. The franchise is doing well, which is obvious considering one of their restaurants has just opened here, near our college. I recommend checking Buffalo Wild Wings out, especially during their specials and deals, although be warned, the restaurant tends to get overwhelmingly busy. Fortunately, there is takeout and at the end of the meal, the bill has a link to one of their surveys online, which will provide a five dollar off coupon for another visit.\n\nVisit their website: http://www.buffalowildwings.com/\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Buffalo Wild Wings Gets New Logo, Restaurant Look.” ClickOnDetroit.

When people look at the iconic character, most probably do not realize how much work went into the design, as if the clay form was a ‘happy accident’ or a product of chance. The truth is Art Clokey had a lot more to think about, as well as a lot of trial and error, before he made the character that would become an international phenomenon to children around the world from the 1950s to the 1990s.\n\nIt would start with the creator himself. Art Clokey was born on October 12, 1921 in Detroit, Michigan where his work with clay would first begin to develop. At the time, he was more interested in making additional forts for his toy soldiers out of clay, so he and a friend could play together and destroy the forts. Unfortunately, when he was nine years old, his father would die in a car accident and he would be sent away to an orphanage before getting adopted by Joseph W. Clokey. His new father was a professor of music, who introduced Art Clokey to exploration, paint, and film through their travels to Canada, Alaska, Siberia, and the western half of America. In addition, the young boy would attend Webb School his eighth grade year, learning archeology and geology, until World War II. During the war, he would work on photo intelligence, travelling and gathering information in North Africa, Italy, and France; wherever the war took him. Afterward, Art Clokey would receive his liberal arts degree and marry Ruth Parkander, who would both meet at Hartford Seminary, where she was studying for her Masters Degree in Religious Education and he was (originally) going to become an Episcopal Priest.\n\nThe art of film for Art Clokey would become an ever more serious endeavor when he went to the University of Southern California, where he received tutelage from the head of the Cinema department, Slavko Vorkapich. The teacher could see his potential from the beginning and was a major contributor to his success in the end. In fact, Art Clokey would meet some of the greatest filmmakers of the time thanks to his instructor.\n\nShortly thereafter, his film career and work with clay animation would begin. The road Art Clokey would take toward his career would form under a contract with Budweiser beer. He was to make commercials for the business, and one of those commercials encompassed the beer next to a Swiss cheese sandwich that was “disappearing with bites”. It was the first time he used clay with kinesthetic film, for the cheese was actually clay, which helped him to exaggerate and capture the essence of the bitten sandwich, while shots were taken at intervals to create the final film. It was not much, but Art Clokey was hooked. Soon he would begin work on a video that would change the course of his career.\n\nThe video is known as Gumbasia, and the idea was to animate the clay into simple shapes to the beat of music, which in this case were jazz rhythms. It was technically the first music video. He, “purposefully avoided the use of any recognizable images to avoid potential distraction, and designed the film so that entire planes moved this way and that. Specific forms carried out complex, fluid, rolling, throwing and leaping movements that caused the viewer to feel the up-and-down motion of going over a hill at high speed or jumping over a log without using any of these traditional images”. In short, Gumbasia was the film that would open the path toward clay animation, and eventually Gumby, with the help of producer Sam Engel, who saw the film and encouraged a television show for children based around clay figures.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaZzRUc2C0A\n\nThat is when Art Clokey got to work developing a shape and name for the green little guy. It did not happen over night; he spent weeks molding clay into different shapes and colors, because he needed to make the figure, “functionally practical from the film-animating standpoint”. Basically, he required a form that was easy to replicate and reproduce, since the filming took place under hot lights and the constant manipulation made the clay dirty or misshapen after some time. After awhile, his wife suggested that he use the basic form of a gingerbread man as his starting point, all the while striving for a shape that was thin with geometric squares. The character was taking shape, with the same principles he used for Gumbasia, he made Gumby from simple, recognizable, geometric shapes that can all be drawn from real life.\n\nThe shape of his head was also something of concern at first, since no one wanted Gumby to turn into a phallic symbol. Art Clokey turned to his deceased father for inspiration on the problem, using a picture of him when he was eighteen, he mimicked the cowlick that his father had, which gave Gumby his little bump of wisdom on his head. On top of that, Gumby was tweaked and altered during his television career, but only slightly. He always kept his bump of wisdom; however, the formation would smooth out or curve more with time. In addition, his eye color switches between black and red; the situation with that was the original design called for red eyes, but the black and white televisions could not bring out the shade so well, so to resolve the problem Gumby got black eyes. Since then, his eye color has flip-flopped, even after color television came out. Over a short course of time, the Gumby shape also became more defined as Art Clokey went along with his filming. The handmade figure turned into a mold that hot clay was poured into, so the form was exactly the same every time, and was also made in less time.\n\nArt Clokey went above and beyond for his clay character, even contemplating every detail down to his color. The green color was not just for aesthetic appeal. He wanted to remind people that clay, like most other things, came from the earth and that the environment was important. The environmentalist that Art Clokey was, determined that Gumby would be the color of chlorophyll, “which turns light into life”. From there, he went on to influence children through Gumby about the significance of environmental care. Thanks to his children, he also had a knack for storytelling, and most of the adventures and lessons the clay character experienced, were derived from his head, including the episodes about the environment.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBIQRZrqdis\n\nSo, how did Gumby get his name? The name was derived from two things: a memory of his deceased father and his studies in the Latin language. It turns out that his father had a knack for calling the muddy clay earth “gumbo”, when the rain would make the dirt thick and wet. Art Clokey took that word into Latin, adding different endings onto the word, like “Gumba” and “Gumbino”. He worked with the latter version, which when shortened became “Gumby”, and Art Clokey got his name, along with the names for the mother and father characters.\n\nYears after the first aired season of Gumby, Art Clokey would found the Prema Toy Company- “prema is a Sanskrit word for heart”- so the heart of Gumby is essentially what the name meant. The company would start to create the Gumby toys for children and the show was so accepted and loved that sales were no problem for the company.\n\nThe toy company still exists and sells toys today, unfortunately without the influence of their founder Art Clokey, who passed away January 8, 2010. Yet his memory is kept alive through the Gumby television show, which is still aired today.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Art Clokey: Creator Extraordinaire.” Gumby. Prema Toy Inc. and Premavision Inc., 2012. Web. 20 Nov. 2012. http://www.gumbyworld.com/\n\nIntroduction:\n\nOn top of that, he learned the meaning of hard work early on at the age of five thanks to his father and his work as a florist, which he never took for granted. The ‘street kid’ ran with it, although he might not have realized at the time that he was or where this hard work would take him, he drew and drew whenever he could in public school. One of his teachers, Ida Engle, would collect his work into a portfolio, which would ultimately begin his path toward graphic design by getting him into the most praised high school in New York, the High School of Music and Art.\n\nIt would not be until after he chose a college that his future would be set. See, George Lois would not only graduate high school with a diploma, but a basketball scholarship to Syracuse, as well. He had a passion and a talent in both art and basketball; however, one had to be chosen over the other. So he chose an art career and started classes at the Pratt Institute. It would not be long before he would turn rogue, accepting a job at a design studio with Reba Sochis and eloping with his college love his sophomore year. Unfortunately, a short time after, George Lois would be drafted to fight in the Korean War for two years. Until his return in 1953, his career would be on hold, and then he would start working for a new company called CBS as though he had never left. He made a fantastic first impression the first day of work, which was also his first day advertising for the company. The idea was, “How food gets delivered to New York” and so, he called a photographer and told him to bring in a fish, “I wanted to have the fish saying, ‘How do I get to New York?’” The same day, a business memo was sent to the art directors asking to return props, “I know you guys are keeping the props. I don’t care what the props are, I want them delivered to my office.” The brilliant art director hangs onto the fish from the shoot and, “At ten o’ clock at night, I leave the fish in the guy’s office with a note that says, ‘As requested’ and sign my name: George Lois.” Despite his behavior, he would continue to work for CBS until he was hired for Doyle Dane Bernbach in 1959, launching a campaign about Big Idea Thinking.\n\nOne of his most famous endeavors known in the advertising business is his work with Esquire magazine, which was work that came to him via a chance interview. The editor Harold Hayes wanted to talk about work on the magazine covers and George Lois just so happened to fit the part Esquire was looking to fill. Therefore, he went on to create 92 new covers for the magazine that have since then been added to a gallery in the Museum of Modern Art for their valuable and controversial material. It was a time when George Lois was also in full control, since, “Sometimes Hayes didn’t even know what he was getting until the finished cover arrived.” A far cry from the ‘street kid’ that he was once referred to as a child growing up in the Bronx, New York, getting into fights on a regular basis. He has several awards to show his hard work, like his initiation into The Art Director’s Club Hall of Fame and The Creative Hall of Fame, as well as, receiving the AIGA Gold Medal, just to name a few. In addition, despite his older age, he continues to contribute to the advertising industry in any way he can, even giving interviews.\n\nGraphic Design Achievements:\n\nThe famous Jiffy Lube is that quick oil change company that looks like a bright red curly-Q, in other words, a full proof George Lois design. Notice that the symbol is actually the letter J, which crosses over into the letter L while also being an arrow to direct automotive customers to the nearest oil change station. The color choice was also a smart move, a vibrant unnatural red is sure to stand out on the natural colors of the road. In addition, the color is associated with other signs like that of a stop sign, encouraging people to stop at the next Jiffy Lube. Although, there was a small issue at first, as certain Jiffy Lube team members thought the symbol looked phallic, but George reassured them, “Well, sir, I don’t know what your peepee is shaped like, but my peepee don’t look like that.”\n\nThe H2OH! was a logo made for the Pepsi brand. It was a design for their new 100% pure bottled water, which included a hint of fruit juice, to add some OH! to that H2OH! The type logo is so effective that an image is unnecessary to add, the impact comes from the fantastic use of color. The blue reinforces the idea of cold or water while the purple is reminiscent of berries. In addition, the purple was expertly placed as the OH! to show there was more to the water than just the contents of the faucet. The bold typeface also helped the product to stand out on the shelves, adding to the idea of in-your-face advertising. Who could miss such an effective logo?\n\nGeorge Lois also did a fantastic job reviving the MTV logo, which was starting to lose luster in the 1980s. Although he did not invent the original logo, he did add to it. With a few simple words, “I want my MTV!” the music television channel was back on track! He kept the slogan simple, clean, and uninteresting so as not to take away from the logo itself, which was an excellent plan that caused little change and brought the company up to date instead of out of business.\n\nThe most elaborate assignment came with the Slomin alarm (security system) company, who were losing business thanks to competitors. Calling in George Lois was the best move the company could have made at that time. He created their logo based off their lawn shield sign and then went even further, creating a face for the name; he invented the superhero, Alarmo, for the job. Using bright red and yellow, George Lois gave consumers security and empowerment in human form, reassuring the public of the high security service of Slomin. George Lois had done it again!\n\nA humanoid form of the UniRoyal Naugahyde vinyl that mimicked leather material, George needed to give the company a gimmick that the knock-off companies could not meet, thus the Nauga was born. Made from the same material, he did an ad that was a side-by-side comparison of the monster and the chair, which basically said, why have something ugly and unnecessary in your home when you can have something beautiful and useful in your home. Inevitably, the monster became a hit and soon a 12 inch doll replica was on the market for children to also enjoy.\n\nAnother alcoholic beverage advertisement, but not like any other. In this campaign, you have taste with Wolfschmidt Vodka, because all the fruits and vegetables want to be with the alcoholic beverage. George Lois made a campaign out of sexual innuendos with inanimate objects. As a whole, the advertisement is also successful because of the great use and balance of white space. Simple and clean is the way to go with George Lois, as well as thinking outside the box.\n\nPhotography can have an impact. That is what the idea was behind the Kerid eardrops campaign, which was the first ad George did as a new art director at Doyle Dane Bernbach. After much research, he realized that most people clean their ears with paper clips, q-tips, and pencil ends. He used that to his advantage when he launched this ad; the message was clear: Kerid eardrops were the new safe way of cleaning your ears!\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt is for reasons like hard work, determination, and dedication that make him such a genuine art director. A lot of people lack those characteristics, but for George Lois, those words were ingrained into him as a child and ever since he has continued to be the definition of all three of those terms. When he wants something or when he strives for something, he goes for it. Even the challenges brought to him, from Irish neighbors asking for an altercation to an editor in need of revamped magazine covers; he reinforces the phrase, “Never back down from a fight.”\n\nOne of his most constructive characteristics that he can teach others through his own example is his behavior in the business world. For George Lois, the work is intense, but sometimes adding in a little humor does not hurt. As a matter of fact, it is vital to have fun and be a little insane with this kind of work because sometimes that behavior inspires the best ideas. Regardless of that, being a little bit unpredictable usually makes for a good story.\n\nAs if that was not enough, he has this wonderful ability to promote and sell his work as an art director. He was the first to jump over the barrier and attempt to invest clients in his work because, “Back then, they wouldn’t let the art director go sell the job.” Nevertheless, he was stubborn and took to selling on his own, “And then all the other art directors followed suit.”\n\nAside from that, George Lois could sell his work successfully because his ad designs were so simple and clear about what he was trying to sell, whereas, “Nowadays, the conventional wisdom is that you shouldn’t look like you’re selling.” To George Lois this concept does not make sense, “So everything’s oblique, nothing’s to the point, nothing knocks you out, nothing says ‘Buy me.’ I always said ‘Buy me,’ but I’d make a joke that made you remember.”\n\nYet, when push comes to shove, what is most invaluable about George Lois and his career is his ability to think and develop ideas. His approach is to always start with an idea and see how far the concept can be stretched and pulled before the idea falls apart, because to him, “Great ideas can’t be tested; only mediocre ideas can be tested.”\n\nSummary:\n\nEssentially, use of negative and positive space, fantastic typography, and bold photographic statements are one of the few main reasons George Lois was so successful.\n\nTo reach his status, think outside the box, but do not lose sight of the goal! If people do not know what you are selling then you lost sight of your goal!\n\nWhat other advise does George Lois have for you?
