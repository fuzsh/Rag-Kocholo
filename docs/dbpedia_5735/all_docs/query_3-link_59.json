        "text": "Hi , I'm a fan of a lot of music Genres. Reggae is one of them. So much music came out of that Jamaican island. I prefer the music of the 60s, 70s into the early 80s.\n\nI'm going with Bob Marley and the Wailers \" Natty Dread\" , it was the first reggae LP I heard back in the mid 70s. I still think it stands up very well.\n\nWould love to hear what your favorite Reggae record is.\n\nYes it is, the Lee Perry production is very strong.\n\nLove that Dillinger record too!\n\nI'll add this comp of Jah Stitch, one of my fave deejays\n\nSquillions of them... but if I was forced at machete point to choose it would have to be Third World's very accessible 96Â° In The Shade...\n\nIn particular this here piece of perfection...\n\nThis thread is the one:\n\nCrucial Reggae\n\nI saw them at a club called Skankland in Columbus Ohio sometime around 1990.\n\nSigning Off is a big one for me. They don't get enough credit for that. It's so classic. Actually the UB40 File is what was really a favorite of mine when I was young, but that is basically an expanded Signing Off. I used to listen to that a lot when I was 17-18.\n\nBut overall, I have to go with Bob Marley's Survival or maybe Exodus. Obvious picks maybe but one of those would be it.\n\ni love the king tubby meets the rockers uptown by augustus pablo one....its my forum picture too..\n\nthere is a yabby you cd on blood and fire mixed by or at king tubby's that i really like too... king tubby's prophesy of dub.. just amazing\n\nalso big youth's screaming target is fabulous\n\na good two cd compilation of toots 60s to 70s stuff can't be beat. .i have a trojan one... toots is criminally underappreciated... everyone focuses on bob bob bob all the time.... i love bob as much as the next guy but i'm honeslty bored of listening to bob's island stuff...\n\na good rule of thumb for me is anything aston barrett played on is bound to be good\n\nBi"
