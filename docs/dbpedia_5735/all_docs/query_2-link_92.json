        "text": "American singer, songwriter and guitarist (1950–2011)\n\nThis article is about the singer-songwriter. For other uses, see Phoebe Snow (disambiguation).\n\nMusical artist\n\nPhoebe Snow (born Phoebe Ann Laub;[4] July 17, 1950[1][2] – April 26, 2011)[1] was an American roots music singer-songwriter and guitarist, known for her hit 1974 and 1975 songs \"Poetry Man\" and \"Harpo's Blues\", and her credited guest vocals backing Paul Simon on \"Gone at Last\".[5] She was described by The New York Times as a \"contralto grounded in a bluesy growl and capable of sweeping over four octaves\".[6] Snow also sang numerous commercial jingles for many U.S. products during the 1980s and 1990s, including General Foods International Coffees, Salon Selectives, and Stouffer's. Snow experienced success in Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s with five top 100 albums in that territory.[7] In 1995 she recorded a gospel album with Sisters of Glory.\n\nEarly life, family and education\n\n[edit]\n\nPhoebe Ann Laub[4] was born in New York City in 1950,[1] and raised in a musical household in which Delta blues, Broadway show tunes, Dixieland jazz, classical music, and folk music recordings were played around the clock. Her father, Merrill Laub, an exterminator by trade, had an encyclopedic knowledge of American film and theater and was also an avid collector and restorer of antiques. Her mother, Lili Laub, was a dance teacher who had performed with the Martha Graham group.[8] She was Jewish.[9][10]\n\nSnow was raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, and graduated from Teaneck High School in 1968.[11] She subsequently attended Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois, but did not graduate.[12] As a student, she carried her prized Martin 000-18 acoustic guitar from club to club in Greenwich Village, playing and singing on amateur nights. Her stage name came from an early 1900s fictional character featured in Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad ads. In painted and later photographic print images, the young woman 'Phoebe Snow' was dressed all in white to emphasize the cleanliness of the line's passenger trains. (Lackawanna's locomotives at the time burned anthracite coal which created less soot than bituminous coal.)[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was at The Bitter End club in 1972 that Denny Cordell, co-owner (with Leon Russell) of Shelter Records, was so taken by the singer that he signed her to the label and produced her first recording, recording at The Church Studio.[citation needed] She released an eponymous album, Phoebe Snow, including \"San Francisco Bay Blues\" and \"Poetry Man\", in 1974, featuring guest performances by The Persuasions, Zoot Sims, Teddy Wilson, David Bromberg, and Dave Mason.\n\nThe album spawned a top five 1975 single on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Poetry Man\" and was itself a top-five album in Billboard, for which she received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.[13] The cover of Rolling Stone magazine followed, while she performed as the opening act for tours by Jackson Browne and Paul Simon. (She provided credited guest vocals backing Simon on the gospel-tinged hit single \"Gone at Last\" later in 1975—#23 on the Hot 100.) The same year, 1975, also brought the first of several appearances as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, on which Snow performed both solo and in duets with Simon and Linda Ronstadt. During the 1975 appearance, she was seven months pregnant with her daughter, Valerie. Her backup vocal is heard on Simon's hit song \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,\" along with Valerie Simpson and Patti Austin, from 1975. Both \"Gone at Last\" and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\" appear on Simon's Grammy-winning 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years.\n\nLegal battles took place between Snow and Shelter Records. Snow ended up signed to Columbia Records. Her second album, Second Childhood, appeared in 1976, produced by Phil Ramone. It was jazzier and more introspective, and was a RIAA Certified Gold Album for Snow, with the Gold Album awarded on July 9, 1976.[14] She moved to a more rock-oriented sound for It Looks Like Snow, released later in 1976 with David Rubinson producing. 1977 saw Never Letting Go, again with Ramone, while 1978's Against the Grain was helmed by Barry Beckett. After that, Snow parted ways with Columbia; she would later say that the stress of her parental obligations compromised her ability to make music effectively. In 1979, she toured extensively throughout the US and Canada with noted guitarist Arlen Roth as her lead guitarist and musical director. Her January 1979 cover of the Paul McCartney song \"Every Night\" reached No. 37 in the UK.[15] In 1981, Snow, then signed with Mirage Records, released the album Rock Away, but the album disappointed music critic Geoffrey Himes.[16]\n\nThe 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide summed up Snow's career to that point by saying: \"One of the most gifted voices of her generation, Phoebe Snow can do just about anything stylistically as well as technically. … The question that's still unanswered is how best to channel such talent.\"\n\nSnow spent long periods away from recording, often singing commercial jingles for AT&T, General Foods International Coffees, Salon Selectives, Stouffer's, Hampton Bay Ceiling Fans, and others to support herself and her daughter.[17] Snow recorded the theme song for the first season of the TV series 9 to 5. (Dolly Parton's vocals were used for the rest of the show's run.) Snow also sang the theme song for NBC's A Different World during the show's first season (1987–88).\n\nIn 1988, a duet with Dave Mason, called \"Dreams I Dream,\" reached No. 11 on the US adult contemporary charts. Snow returned to recording with Something Real in 1989 and gathered a few more hits on the Adult Contemporary charts. Also, Snow composed WDIV-TV (Detroit)'s \"Go 4 It!\" campaign in 1980. She sang \"Ancient Places, Sacred Lands\", composed by Steve Horelick, on Reading Rainbow's tenth episode, The Gift of the Sacred Dog. The episode was based on the book of the same name by Paul Goble and was narrated by actor Michael Ansara. It was shot in Crow Agency, Montana, in 1983.\n\nSnow performed in 1989 on stage at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City, as part of Our Common Future: a five-hour live television broadcast originating from several countries.[18] Also that year, Snow sang the jingle for \"Colon Blow\", a breakfast cereal commercial parody featured on Saturday Night Live.[19]\n\nIn 1990, she contributed a cover version of the Delaney & Bonnie song \"Get Ourselves Together\" to the Elektra compilation Rubáiyát, which included Earth Wind & Fire guitarist Dick Smith. In 1992, she toured with Donald Fagen's New York Rock and Soul Revue and was featured on the group's album recorded live at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. Throughout the 1990s, she made numerous appearances on the Howard Stern radio show. She sang live for specials and birthday shows. In 1997, she sang the Roseanne theme song a cappella during the closing moments of the final episode.[20]\n\nIn 1995, Snow participated in The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True at the Lincoln Center in New York City, singing a distinctive medley of \"If I Only Had a Brain; a Heart; the Nerve\". In addition, the concert featured performances by Jewel, Joel Grey, Roger Daltrey, and Jackson Browne, among others. An album of the concert was released on compact disc on Rhino Records as catalog number R2 72405.\n\nSnow joined with the pop group Zap Mama, who recorded its own version of Snow's \"Poetry Man\" in an impromptu duet on the PBS series Sessions at West 54th. Hawaiian girl group Nā Leo Pilimehana also had a hit on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1999 with its cover version of \"Poetry Man\".\n\nIn May 1998, Snow received the Cultural Achievement Award from New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.\n\nSnow performed for US President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and his cabinet at Camp David in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Snow released her album Natural Wonder on Eagle Records, containing 10 original tracks, her first original material in 14 years. Snow performed at Howard Stern's wedding in 2008, and made a special appearance in the film Noah's Arc: Jumping the Broom as herself. Some of her music was also featured on the soundtrack of the film. Her Live album (2008) featured many of her hits as well as a cover of \"Piece of My Heart\".[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978 Snow was married to Phil Kearns (who later came out as gay).[21] She had a daughter, Valerie Rose, who was born with severe brain damage.[9][10] Snow resolved not to institutionalize Valerie, and cared for her at home until Valerie died on March 19, 2007, at the age of 31. Snow's efforts to care for Valerie nearly ended her career.[22] She continued to take voice lessons, and she studied opera informally.[22]\n\nSnow resided in Bergen County, New Jersey, and in her later years she embraced Buddhism.[10]\n\nPhoebe Snow suffered a cerebral hemorrhage[10] on January 19, 2010, and slipped into a coma, enduring bouts of blood clots, pneumonia and congestive heart failure. She died on April 26, 2011, at age 60 in Edison, New Jersey.[23]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Peak chart positions Certifications Record label US\n\n[24] US R&B\n\n[25] US Jazz\n\n[26] AUS\n\n[7] 1974 Phoebe Snow 4 22 — 48\n\nUS: Gold[27]\n\nShelter Records 1976 Second Childhood 13 33 — 71\n\nUS: Gold[27]\n\nColumbia It Looks Like Snow 29 — — 64 1977 Never Letting Go 73 36 — — 1978 Against the Grain 100 — — — 1981 Rock Away 51 — — — Mirage 1989 Something Real 75 — — — Elektra 1991 The New York Rock and Soul Revue: Live at the Beacon — — — — Giant 1995 Good News in Hard Times (with the Sisters of Glory) — — — — Warner Bros. 1998 I Can't Complain — — — — House of Blues 2003 Natural Wonder — — — — Eagle Records 2008 Live — — 17 — Verve Records \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nCompilations\n\n[edit]\n\n1981: The Best of Phoebe Snow\n\n1995: P.S.\n\n2001: The Very Best of Phoebe Snow\n\n2012: Playlist: The Very Best of Phoebe Snow\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Song Peak chart positions US Adult\n\n[28][29] US R&B\n\n[28] US Pop\n\n[30][31] UK\n\n[28] AUS\n\n[32][33] CAN\n\n[34][35][36] NZL\n\n[37] 1974 \"Good Times (Let the Good Times Roll)\" ― ― — ― ― ― ― \"Poetry Man\" 1 ― 5 ― 60 4 28 \"Harpo's Blues\" 20 ― — ― ― ― ― 1975 \"Gone at Last\" (with Paul Simon) 9 ― 23 ― 95 29 ― 1976 \"Two-Fisted Love\" ― ― — ― ― ― ― \"All Over\" ― ― — ― ― ― ― \"Shakey Ground\" ― ― 70 ― ― ― 6 1977 \"Teach Me Tonight\" ― ― — ― ― ― ― \"Never Letting Go\" ― ― — ― ― ― ― \"Love Makes a Woman\" ― 87 ― ― ― ― ― 1978 \"In My Life\"\n\n(only released in the UK, Australia and New Zealand) ― ― — ― ― ― ― \"Every Night\" ― ― — 37 22 — 6 1981 \"Games\" ― ― 46 ― 95 ― ― \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\" ― ― 52 ― ― ― ― \"Baby Please\" ― ― ― ― ― ― ― 1988 \"Dreams I Dream\" (with Dave Mason) 11 ― — ― ― ― ― 1989 \"If I Can Just Get Through the Night\" 13 ― — — 85 63 ― \"Something Real\" 29 ― — ― ― ― ― \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that territory.\n\nWith other artists\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Single Album Other Artist Note 1975 \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\" Still Crazy After All These Years Paul Simon only backing vocals \"Gone at Last\" Still Crazy After All These Years Paul Simon \"Hymn\" Aftertones Janis Ian 1976 \"Smile\" David Sanborn David Sanborn 1977 \"Everybody Has a Dream\" The Stranger Billy Joel Only background vocals 1978 \"Reelin'\" One-Eyed Jack Garland Jeffreys 1980 \"Sometimes Love Forgets\" Hot Spot Steve Goodman 1982 \"You Really Got a Hold on Me\" Bobby McFerrin Bobby McFerrin \"Hammer & Nails\" Experiment in White Janis Siegel \"Whether or Not the World Gets Better\" Roll It Jimmy Salvemini 1984 \"Gravity's Angel\" Mister Heartbreak Laurie Anderson Only background vocals \"Eenie, Meenie, Minie, Moe\" You're Gettin' Even While I'm Gettin' Odd The J.
