The network currently has 15 owned-and-operated stations, and current affiliation agreements with 236 other television stations.[1][2][3]\n\nThis article is a listing of current CBS affiliates in the continental United States and United States possessions (including subchannel affiliates, satellite stations, low-power stations, and translators), arranged alphabetically by state, and based on the stations city of license and followed in parentheses by the Designated Market Area if it differs from the city of license. There are links to and articles on each of the stations, describing their histories, local programming and technical information, such as broadcast frequencies.\n\nThe station's advertised channel number follows the call letters. In most cases, this is their virtual channel (PSIP) number."
