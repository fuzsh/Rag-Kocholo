        "text": "History\n\nIt was started in 1984 by former cable service provider, Trillium Cable on Cable Channel 11 (where it remains today). When Shaw Cable arrived in 1995, the cable provider also started a separate community channel in Leamington, Ontario (also on their cable channel 11), to serve Leamington and Kingsville, Ontario. When Cogeco displaced Shaw as the main cable provider in 2000, they reunited and merged the two Local stations back together into one to simplify and streamline operations and programming.\n\nProgramming\n\nMost of YourTV's programming includes Windsor City Council and Essex County Council meetings, University of Windsor sports, local public affairs programming, and OHL Hockey, such as Windsor Spitfires games (either produced by the network, or simulcast from another community channel, such as Rogers TV or another YourTV outlet). YourTV also airs election coverage.\n\nWhen there is no programming, a community notice board with news/weather, community events, and a simulcast of CKLW or CIDR-FM is aired, with images occasionally from the cable company's tower camera (located on Dougall Avenue, in Windsor)."
