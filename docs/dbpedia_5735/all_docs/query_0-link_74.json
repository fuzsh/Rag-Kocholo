Timothy Jay Vafeades, 56, pieaded guilty to two counts of transportation for illegal sexually activity in an agreement with prosecutors. The government dropped two kidnapping charges as part of the deal. Vafeades previously admitted to transportation of child pornography. Prosecutors and Vafeades’ public defenders also agreed to a 20-year prison term, which U S. District Judge David Nuffer said he intends to impose. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Nov. 2. Vafeades is being held in the Davis County Jail. Assistant U.S. attorney Trina Higgins said prosecutors are happy to have a just resolution. She said the case is complicated and reaches all across the country, and she hopes the guilty plea brings some closure to the victims. The agreement spares the victims from having to testify at a trial. \"That's not something I can comment on, but if they wish to speak at sentencing, they'll be allowed to, and I hope that well hear some of their voices,\" Higgins said. Vafeades' attorneys declined to comment as they left the courthouse. Dubbed the \"vampire trucker,\" Vafeades held women captive in his truck, the \"Twilight Express,\" sexually and physically abused them and sharpened their teeth with a power tool, according to the charges. Judge says Utah trucker’s arrest was legal in sex slave case A federal judge has dismissed a challenge to the arrest of a Utah truck driver accused of keeping women as sex slaves in his semi-trailer as he drove across the country. The Murray man wore bracelets on his wrists that he called \"slave bracelets\" and would hit his victims with the bracelets if they didn’t follow his commands, court documents say. He owned a pair of dentures that were carved to make the two front teeth appear as fangs, prosecutors said. His alleged trail of abuse ended in November 2013 in Clay County, Minnesota, when a state trooper realized that the female passenger in Vafeades' semitrailer had a lifetime protection order issued against him in Florida. Vafeades' guilty plea involved two victims in 2012 and 2013. But court documents say there were at least six victims and the abuse goes back as far as 1994.

Federal charges have been filed against Vafeades, a Utah trucker accused of keeping sex slaves in his semitrailer for months at a time. {The Associated Press) () The woman toid investigators she met Timothy Jay Vafeades at the Sapp Brothers truck stop in Salt Lake City. It was April 2012, and she got into his tractor-trailer after agreeing to get dinner with him, according to court documents. But about 10 minutes into the drive, Vafeades told her that \"they were not going to dinner and that she was going on the road with him for a week or more,\" an FBI agent wrote in a criminal affidavit. \"She reported that she knew she could not do anything.\" For months after that, investigators allege, Vafeades forced the woman to live with him, work on the truck -- and have sex with him almost daily. Vafeades told the woman \"she was his 'slave' on the truck,\" and he beat her often, according to the affidavit. Vafeades was eventually charged with kidnapping the woman and one other and transporting them for illegal sexual activity aboard his truck, dubbed the \"Twilight Express.\" Prosecutors alleged that he also kidnapped and sexually assaulted four other women over a span of two decades, subjecting them to beatings and holding them captive as he drove his truck across the country. On Thursday (June 30), Vafeades, 56, agreed to a plea deal just days before his trial was to begin. He pleaded guilty to the illegal sexual activity charges. The kidnapping charges were dropped in exchange. The deal means Vafeades -- referred to by local media as the \"vampire\" truck driver because of the fangs on false teeth he once wore -- could face more than 20 years in prison.

Simon de Montfort senior originally came from a minor lordship close to Paris, but when his uncle Robert de Beaumont, the earl of Leicester, died in 1204 without any children, he went to England to claim the earldom. King John rebuffed him, but in 1210 some disaffected nobles elected him king. They had had enough of the devious John, and Simon by this time was the most famous warrior in Europe. He was the inspired leader of the Christian forces in the Albigensian Crusade and scored major victories against the odds. Contrary to popular belief, Simon de Montfort senior did not direct the sack of Beziers, where as many as 20,000 people are said to have perished, nor did he utter the likely fictitious command to “kill them all, God will know his own\". But he was loathed as an invader from the north who burned heretics and acquired their property in equal measure. His death in 1218 during the siege of Toulouse was both mourned and cheered. He was succeeded by his eldest son Amaury, whose status as a French peer barred him from claiming the earldom of Leicester. It was a different story for his younger son Simon, however... 2) Simon seduced the king’s sister Still in his early twenties, the younger Simon de Montfort (6th earl of Leicester] came to England in 1230 and persuaded John's son Henry III to give him the earldom. Henry was interested in reclaiming Normandy and other French provinces taken from his father by King Philip Augustus of France and saw Simon as a future supporter to this end against his increasingly isolationist barons. Eight years later the king found himself facing a rebellion at home when it was discovered that he had secretly married his sister Eleanor, the widow of William Marshal II, to Montfort, who by then was seen as a foreigner interloper with too much influence at court. Matters were made worse by the fact that Eleanor had taken a vow of chastity after the death of her first husband Henry bought off the rebels, but the next year he turned against Simon for pledging him as security for a loan. Montfort had to borrow heavily to acquire the earldom and his wife and figured his brother-in-law the king was good for the money. In front of the court, Henry let loose a tirade that accused him, among other things, of seducing his sister, thereby forcing his hand in the marriage. The Montforts’ first child was born less than a year after the wedding, but a decade later Simon was suffering pangs of conscience that suggest he had indeed seduced Eleanor before they were married.

The court abounded with foreigners at that time. Henry III was by nature cosmopolitan and pursued a continental policy to maintain English influence across the Channel. Simon was of the same mind and cultivated his family and contacts in France to firmly anchor England within Europe. The nobility, however, saw it all as a waste of time and money and grew resentful of these 'favourites 1 . After Flenry defeated the reformers in 1261, the barons and clerics aroused the English-speaking population against the king and foreigners. They chose as their leader Simon de Montfort because he was the only one with the talent and prestige to pull it off. So it was a distinctly English revolution: a foreigner toppling the king on a platform of getting rid of all foreigners. Of course, Simon by then had been the earl of Leicester for 25 years and had an English wife and children. But politics being what it is, he was eventually toppled himself in part because some of the men who brought him to power began to resent a foreigner telling them what to do. 4) Simon was not an anti-Semite Not any more than other Christians of that era. Apart from remembering that it was a time of crusades and religious fervour, medieval people lived by a completely different value system to our own. Judging them in terms of modern political correctness is therefore presumptuous and misconceived In Montfort : s case, he expelled the Jews that were living in Leicester following his arrival in 1232. Actually it was only half of Leicester. The other half belonged to his great-aunt Margaret, the sister of Robert de Beaumont, and the half-dozen Jewish families who were expelled moved across the border to her side. Religion aside, Montfort : s action reflected a crackdown on the Jews then going on in France over the debts owed to them by Christians. The inhabitants of Leicester expected their new lord to offer them a political gesture and this expulsion is what he gave them. The Jews would return overtime to his half of Leicester and even Montfort got into the business of borrowing money from them, but there’s no denying Jews suffered greatly during the revolution Montfort led against the king 30 years later. They were beaten, robbed, and in one horrific night in 1264 some 500 were massacred in London by supporters of Montforbs rebel army. The religious fanaticism behind it was mostly a sham. it was plunder and a sadistic free for all they were after. The Montfortian leaders of the city offered shelter to the survivors and Simon forced the perpetrators to turn over their loot, but then condemned himself in the eyes of posterity by using it for his cause. 5) Simon was nominated to be the governor of Jerusalem After falling out with Henry in 1239, Simon went on crusade in the Holy Land in 1240. Crusading was a family business and his brother Amaury preceded him there the year before, only to be captured in an ill-advised raid by the Egyptians. Since there was a truce at the time between the Christian and Muslim forces, there was little for Simon to do except get mixed up in the politics of the region. His cousin Philip de Montfort was one of the leaders of a faction opposed to imperial rule over Jerusalem. Simon was the emperor’s brother-in-law inasmuch as his wife Eleanor's sister Isabella was married to Frederick ill and got to know him well during his travels. Philip figured his cousin, whose possessed ambition and charisma, was the best compromise candidate to unite both factions at a time when the Egyptians were bent on re-conquering Jerusalem. Togetherthey asked the emperorto make Simon their governor, but nothing came of it [historians are unsure as to why] and Simon left the Holy Land It was his good fortune, for three years later the Egyptians directed an Asiatic people fleeing from the Mongols http: //www. hi storye Ktr a. com /a rti c I e/featur e/1 D-thi ngs- y ou- m i ghft- not- k now- about-simon-de-mo ntfo rt ? utm_s our c e= F a ceb ook +r efe r r al &utm _m e di um=F ace boo k.... 2/E 6/290016 10 Sim on de M ontfort facts | H istory Extra to sack Jerusalem and they did so with great carnage. Philip was one of the few lucky ones to escape and remained a lord of the crusader states until assassinated by an agent of the sultan while at worship in 1270.

(Photo by Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images) 6) Simon was not the founder of parliament per se As England grew in population and wealth, the royal inner council evolved from an intimate round table to a major assembly. By 1236 this assembly, which met only at the king’s invitation, was called parliament, meaning a discussion or debate. Revolution broke out in 1258 after one group of barons had enough of the king's brothers and forced him to exile them. Since they had long wanted to reform his government, they took a step further and enacted the Provisions of Oxford, which gave the barons unprecedented power. One of these provisions called for parliament to meet three times a year at fixed intervals, thereby taking it out of the king’s hands and making it an independent institution of state. When Henry sought to regain power in 1261 by having the pope annul his oath to the Provisions, his point of attack was to reassert control over parliament, and Simon moved to stop him. Although motivated as much by personal and political reasons as idealism, Simon shrewdly saw parliament as the main check on the king. When he took over the government after his success in the civil war of 1264-35, it was to parliament that he addressed his plan of government, which was in effect England's first constitution. He later enlarged the scope of representation outside the landed elite, namely by including the wealthy merchant class of the cities, and in doing so acted like a prime minister - the first one, we can say, in English history. 7) Simon was a great warrior like his father In 1248, Henry chose Simon to quell his mutinous province of Gascony because he had the reputation for being an outstanding soldier. This seems to have been based on his father's reputation, however, because Simon himself had no record of major engagements before coming to England. When he went to war against Henry in 1264, he was as much a novice as the rest of his forces Henry mastered the initial phases of the campaign and had Simon cornered in London He was ready to finish him off when Montfort made one of those bold strokes he would forever be remembered for: he marched on the king at Lewes with a numerically smaller army and won the battle. It came about when Henry’s son, the future King Edward I, left the battlefield to go on a killing spree. Simon exploited this and ended up taking both the king and prince captive. The next year Edward escaped his captors, raised an army, and was determined not to repeat his stupidity at Lewes. 8) Simon was hacked to pieces on the battlefield This is usually what most people know about Montfort. aside from his role in the birth of English parliament. Deserted by the conceited and xenophobic earl of Gloucester, Simon found himself trapped at Evesham in August 1265. Before the battle, Edward put together a death squad to find Montfort (his uncle), and kill him. Whether it was at their hand or not, Montfort was slain, stripped of armour and chopped up. The men who killed him were motivated by a fiendish bloodlust worked up on the battlefield. It used to be that the nobility were spared and captured for ransom, but not anymore. Edward ordered his men to ki I as many of the Montfortians as possible, the result being he forever changed the nature of warfare and politics in England. Unlike his father, who did not execute a single political opponent in his 56 years on the throne, Edward had men such as William Wallace and David of Wales dispatched in grisly fashion. He wanted http: //www. hi storye Ktr a. com /a rti c I e/featur e/1 Q-thi ngs- y ou- m i ght- not- k now- about-simon-de-mo ntfo rt? utm_s our c e= F a ceb ook +r efe r r al &utm _m e di um=F ace boo k.... 3/E 6/29 0016 10 Sim on de M ontfoit facts | H istory Extra everyone to know that what happened to Simon de Montfort could be their fate as well 9) Simon’s sons scandalised Europe After Henry resumed power in 1265, the five surviving Montfort children and their mother, Eleanor, left for exile on the continent. Two of them, Simon and Guy, found service in Italy and Sicily. Guy proved himself to be as sagacious a warrior as his father and quickly rose to become the military governor of Tuscany. In 1271 Guy and Simon arrived in Viterbo, where a papal election was in process. There they learned that their cousin Henry of Almain was in the city as well. He was at worship in a church when Guy burst in and slaughtered him at the altar. The hapless Henry was then dragged outside to be hacked up by Guy and his men in gruesome retribution forthe treatment of his father's body.

(Granger, NYO/Alamy Stock Photo) Henry was chosen as a target because of his close personal connection to Edward, his desertion of Simon during the civil war, and his marriage into the family of the Montforts 1 mortal enemy in France. The brothers were disowned, with the younger Simon dying later that year, but Guy got off with no more than house arrest. As brutal and shocking as the murderwas.therewasa feeling somebody had it coming because of the disgraceful treatment of Simon's body at Evesham. 10) Simon was the grandfather of the last Welsh Princess of Wales Simon's greatest enemies during his rule were the so-called marcher barons of the Welsh borderlands. To keep them in line, he made an alliance with Prince Llywelyn of Wales in 1264. The agreement called for Simon's daughter Eleanor to marry Llywelyn, but Henry's restoration put that on hold. After Simon's widow died in 1275, the younger Eleanor left for Wales to go through with the marriage. Accompanied by her brother Amaury, they were captured at sea on orders from Edward, now the king. He imprisoned Amaury, convinced he had something to do with the murder of Henry of Almain, but kept Eleanor in comfortable confinement at Windsor. Only after Llywelyn submitted in 1278 did he allow the marriage go forward. In 1282 Eleanor died giving birth to a daughter named Gwenllian. Llywelyn was up in arms against Edward later that year and killed in a prelude to the conquest of Wales. Fearing the infant's combined Welsh and English royal heritage (she was King John's great-granddaughter), Edward had her placed in a nunnery in Lincolnshire, where she died in 1337 ; perhaps unaware of her famous and fiery ancestry. Darren Baker is the author of With Alt For Ail: The Life of Simon de Montfort , (Amberley Publishing), a biography following Montfort T s life from his birth and upbringing in France until his defeat and death at the hands of the future Edward I. The book is currently avaiiable in hardback and will be released in paperback in February 2017.

SIS 6/160016 11-Foot Gator Found Rotting In Neighborhood Storm Drain Foul Odor Uncovers 11-Foot Gator Rotting In Neighborhood Storm Drain huffingtonpost com “This was an abnormally large gator, but removal is part of what we do.” 06/15/2016 11:04 am ET • Nina Golgowski Trends reporter, The Huffington Post Lee County Department of Transportation An 11-foot-iong gator is seen being removed from a southwest Florida neighborhood on Monday. Authorities say an “abnormally large gator” was pulled from a southwest Florida neighborhood’s storm drain Monday following calls to the sheriff’s department about a foul smell. In a statement, Lee County officials say they determined that the odor was consistent with a decaying alligator. What they found beneath the ground, however, was described as highly unusual. Inside the 4-foot-wide catch basin, Department of Transportation officials reported hooking an 11-foot-iong gator, one they were photographed hauling out of the Whiskey Creek neighborhood with an excavator. Lee County’s DOT says they typically handle one to two dead alligators in storm drains a year but rarely ones of this size. “DOT generally is alerted to such situations by reports of odor coming from a catch basin or when drainage is backed up for no obvious reason,’’ the county said in an emailed press release. Lee County DOT Director Randy Cerchie called it business as usual. “This was an abnormally large gator, but removal is part of what we do,’’ he said in a statement. County spokeswoman Betsy Clayton told the News-Press that the gator likely entered the storm drain through the pipes. The big question: How did it get in? The county describes the pipes leading to the drain as only about 14-inches by 24-inches. “We don’t usually see gators that big because our pipes are not that big,’’ Cerchie said. http: //www. huffi ngton post, c o m/entr y/m a ssi v e- gator- fou rid- i n- d r ai n_u s_5761558 eo4 b0df4 d58Gea4d4 ?utm_hp_r ef=w e i r d- new s 1/2 6/160016 11-Foot Gator Found Rotting In Neighborhood Storm Drain According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, female American alligators rarely grow larger than 10-feet in length. Mates can grow much larger, however. The largest gator ever found in the state was 14-feet, 3 1/2-inches in length, the FWC reported. The Lee County gator’s body was hauled away in a dump truck to a DOT site that’s designated for dead animals, and there it was buried, the county said.

WHAT IS A SINKEX? A SINKEX, or sink exercise, is a multinational maritime exercise that takes place in and around the Hawaiian Islands and off the coast of southern California every two years. This year's RIMPAC exercise, the 25th in the series that began in 1971, started with the sinking of the USS Thach on July 14, featuring hips, submarines and aircraft from the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. The exercise will continue this week. The USS Thach finally sank at 7:25 p.m. on July 14 in waters 15,000 feet deep. As per SINKEX procedures, each ship must go down in at least 6,000 feet of water and at least 50 nautical miles from land. This SINKEX was a tremendous event for all the units who participated. As you can imagine, the opportunity to fire live ordnances at a real target is incredibly rare and I know that these men and women learned so much today,' Royal Canadian Navy Rear Adm. Scott Bishop, deputy commander of the RIMPAC Combined Task Force, said. This kind of training is vital to strengthening our interoperability and increasing our readiness for operations in the future.' Damage: This shot from the scene video shows the damage done to the ship during the bombardments Explosive: The ship withstood a huge amount of damage, as seen here at the helicopter pad at the back The decommissioned USS Thach was the 34th ship of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided missile frigates. The ship was named for Naval aviator Adm. John S. Thatch, the developer of the Thach Weave', a dogfighting tactic in World War II and former Commander, U.S. The shop was built by the Todd Pacific Shipyards in San Pedro, California and launched in December 1982. In late 2006 while deployed to the Southern Pacific, Thach caught fire as she attempted to put out a fire on a drug smuggling ship. It was then decommissioned in San Diego on November 1,2013 http: //www. dai I ym a i I. co. uk/n ew s/arti cl e- 3698132/N av y- bl ow- r etired- m i I itary- ship- cc ast- H aw a i i- m i ss i I e- testi ng- e x e r ci se- j ust- w o n-t- si nk. htm I ?utm _so urce=far... 3/4 7/1972016 Navy blow up retired military ship off the coast of Hawaii during missile-testing exercise | Daily Mail Online Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group ©Associated Newspapers Ltd /* Copyright 2014 Eve mote Corporation.

Pacific. ' Scripps' Dr. -John D.

Neil Gordon Wilson. 49. was found dead dressed in a fish suit in a paddock near picturesque Toolon- do Reservoir about 390km west of Melbourne on November 29. It is believed Mr Wilson may have accidentally suf located as he returned from trying out his fish suit in the reservoir. ■‘Mr Wilson was wear¬ ing a heavy green plastic bodysuit which he had made of old waterbed material from the tip.” a police spokesman said. ’ He had sewn the suit together, He put a lot of work into it. \"It had round holes for eyes, but no holes for the nose or mouth and no other ventilation. -Both legs fitted into the one leg’. The suit zipped right up the back. \"The way the suit was designed would have made movement ex tremely restricted.\" How he ended up in the middle of the paddock is By HEATHER KENNEDY a mystery itself as he would not have been able to walk in the suit — he could only j ump. Mr Wilson's badly de¬ composed body was dis¬ covered four days after his father reported him missing. The Melbourne man whose family kept a hol¬ iday house at Toolondo. was well known to locals. A local resident, who declined to be named, claimed Mr Wilson used to wear the fish outfit in the lake and swing from a rope while he pre¬ tended to be a fish. \"He wanted to be a fish,\" the man said. A second fish outfit in yellow was found in the Wilson’s garage. However, police re¬ jected suggestions Mr Wilson made a habit of wearing fish suits. \"This was something new,’’ the spokesman said. The results of an autop¬ sy on Mr Wilson's remains will not be available until after an inquest.

If one is found guilty, he will be sentenced to life in prison. Or, a kind of prison at least: a zoo. The suspects are ail Asiatic lions. The species is endangered, and its population has dwindled as human settlements encroach on its remaining habitat. As that process speeds up, humans and lions are, of course, more likely to come into contact, leading to murders that go both ways. There are approximately 400 Asiatic lions left in the wild, and they are the only lion population outside of Africa. Wildlife officials in India say that Gir National Park, where almost all these lions live, can only accommodate 270 of them, leading some prides to venture outside its boundaries. India's Supreme Court recently ordered Gujarat to relocate some of its lions to other states, but the state is yet to comply. The 18 lions nowin custody will have their paw-prints and feces tested, which police believe could indicate which is the culprit. \"The officials are also studying the animals' behaviour. Man eating lions usually get aggressive at the sight of a human being,\" wildlife expert Ruchi Dave told the BBC. J.A. Khan, Gujarat's top forest official, said, \"We think we have pinpointed the guilty lion, but we are still awaiting the results of nine more animals.\" PHiL NOBLE If one lion Is found guilty , hew iff be sentenced to life in prison.

Pa. state police pay $195K to settle New York man jailed for bricks of soap. Pennsylvania State Police paid $195,000 to settle a New York man's claims he was wrongly jailed for nearly a month after troopers using a field drug test mistook soap for cocaine, a court document obtained by The Morning Call shows. Alexander Bernstein of Brooklyn also settled claims in his federal lawsuit against Safariland LLC, the company that produced the allegedly faulty drug test that troopers used during the November 2013 traffic stop in Lehigh County when Bernstein and a traveling companion were arrested, his lawyer said. Attorney Joshua Karoly of Allentown said he could not discuss the terms of either settlement, except that the parties had reached mutually agreeable resolutions and agreed not to discuss them. The Morning Call obtained a copy of the state police settlement by requesting it under Pennsylvania's Right-to- Know Law. Bernstein's settlement with Safariland is not subject to the public records law. State police and Safariland did not return calls seeking comment Thursday. While Bernstein was behind bars, he lost his job, his apartment and his possessions, rendering him homeless and destitute, the lawsuit claimed. Bernstein's lawsuit was cited in a ProPublica investigation published July 7 in The New York Times Magazine as one of several around the country attacking the reliability of roadside chemical tests to identify drugs. The investigation noted that tests produced by manufacturers including Safariland are not regulated, are subject to user error and misinterpretation, and can produce false positives from dozens of chemicals other than illegal drugs, including medications and household cleaners. ProPublica estimated that at least 100,000 people across the country plead guilty each year to drug possession charges that are based solely on field tests. \"At that volume, even the most modest of error rates could produce thousands of wrongful convictions,\" the investigation says. After being stopped by Pennsylvania troopers on Interstate 78 in South Whitehall Township, Bernstein and Anadel Cruz of New York were charged with possession with intent to deliver cocaine, possession of cocaine, conspiracy and possession of drug paraphernalia. A search of their rented Mercedes-Benz revealed two brick-size packages covered in clear plastic and red tape, according to the police report. Cruz, who was the driver, told the troopers they contained homemade soap for her sister, whom Cruz was traveling to visit in Florida, it says. But the troopers — Nicholas Goldsmith and Justin Julius — insisted the packages, which together weighed more than 5 pounds, contained \"a controlled substance of some kind,\" Bernstein's lawsuit claimed. The troopers said they also found a small amount of marijuana in Cruz's bra. Bernstein and Cruz were taken to a state police barracks where, Bernstein alleged, he overheard the troopers agree to a conspiracy in which they would falsely report negative field test results as positive The lawsuit also contains an alternative theory alleging that Safariland's field test kit was defective because it produced two separate false positive results. California-based Safariland makes and sells firearms accessories, forensic investigation tools and safety equipment for police. http://www.nncall.eom/news/breaking/m c-pa- state-police- roadside- drug-test- settlem ent-20160714- story.htm I ?utm_source=fark&Lrtm_medium= web site&LJtm_c... 1 72 m 60016 Pa. state police pay $195Kto settle claims over faulty roadside drug test - The Morning Call Bernstein, 33, was held for 29 days in Lehigh County Prison under $500,000 bail until it was reduced and he was able to post $25,000. After Bernstein and Cruz were released on bail, on the day a preliminary hearing was scheduled, police dropped the charges. Bernstein was required to pay more than $32,000 in bail and court costs, plus pay a defense attorney and fees associated with having the arrest expunged from his record, the suit claimed. \"And even then, the FBI, the internet and other media sources will still contain a permanent record of his arrest and the criminal charges upon which he was maliciously prosecuted,\" the suit claimed. After the charges were dismissed, Karoly and Allentown attorney Robert Goldman, who defended Cruz, called their arrests a clear case of racial profiling. They noted the troopers stopped a Hispanic woman driving a luxury car with out-of-state license plates late at night. The reasons troopers gave to justify the stop were specious, Goldman said. The affidavit of probable cause said Cruz was driving nearly 60 mph in a 55 mph zone and they saw hertires riding on a dividing line, he noted. \"Hopefully law enforcement learns something from this episode, and hopefully prosecutors, that it isn't always what it appears,\" Goldman said. pefer.half@mcaff.com Twitter @phaif215 610 - 820-6581 Copyright © 2016, The Morning Call Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Cali http: //www. m call.com/ne wsibreaking/m c-pa- state-police- roadside- drug- test- settlem ent-20160714- story.htm I ?utm_source=fark&Litm_medium= web site&LJtm_c... 2 (1 7/11/2016 22 girls held in Novita, Choco- Publimetro 22 girls held in Novita, Choco PUBLIMETRQ/EA Posted: Yesterday 14:13 h. publim etro .CO Monday July 11,2016 Panic in Getty Images Photo: Choco for Alleged diabolic possession of 22 girls publimetr® The children, Between 12 and 15 years, Were taken to a medical center Wovita ; after suffering the same symptoms in Their school.

Carolina megachurch ousts founder as senior pastor S. Carolina megachurch ousts founder as senior pastor ap.org Jul. 10,2016 4:42 PM EDT ANDERSON, S.C. (AP) —The founder of South Carolina’s massive NewSpring Church has been ousted as senior pastor over problems including alcohol use. The Independent Mail in Anderson reports (http://goo.gl/1yPf95 ) that another church leader, executive pastor Shane Duffey, announced at a Sunday service that the Christian church had removed the Rev. Perry Noble on July 1. Duffey cited Noble's \"unfortunate choices\" and said the church's board had confronted Noble multiple times about his drinking. A statement attributed to Noble and read during the service confirmed that he overused alcohol, and said \"No one is more disappointed in me than I am in myself.\" Noble didn't immediately respond to an email Sunday from The Associated Press. The church traces its roots to a Bible study that began in Noble’s apartment in 1998. It has grown to 17 locations around South Carolina, 30,000 people attend services each week, according to its website. The annual report posted there said the church took in about $64 million for 2015.
