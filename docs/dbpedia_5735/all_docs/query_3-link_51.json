        "text": "Rochester â€” Remnants remained Sunday of a Saturday night propane tank explosion downtown where multiple people were injured and the city's main street was closed for the rest of the night.\n\nThree people were seriously injured and others sustained minor injuries after a propane tank caught fire outside a downtown Rochester business and exploded, the Rochester Police Department said Saturday night.\n\nThe 423 Main Bar Grill & Rooftop and Good Company Realty both had visible damage Sunday.\n\nThe Good Company Realty sign was resting on the sidewalk, which appeared to be scorched, and the letters \"B\" and \"A\" in the 423 Main sign were damaged, but it could not be verified if the damage was caused by the explosion.\n\nMost businesses near where the explosion occurred were closed Sunday.\n\nAn employee at 423 Main told a Detroit News reporter the restaurant did not have a comment on the incident. The Rochester police and fire departments told The News on Sunday that no one was available to comment further on the incident.\n\nThe explosion occurred at about 8:45 p.m. outside an unidentified business on Main Street between University and Fourth, resulting in first responders going to the area and police and fire units closing off the scene along Main Street from Fourth to Universal for the rest of the evening, police officials said in a Saturday night Facebook post.\n\nThe explosion appeared to be accidental, the post said.\n\nRochester fire Chief John Cieslik told WDIV and Fox 2 Detroit that five patients were transported from the scene with injuries, including three children, while two others were treated at the scene and released. Police said they are still investigating.\n\nThree victims were hospitalized at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital; two with minor injuries and one with a moderate injury that is requiring surgery, according to an Ascension Rochester health worker who didn't give a name.\n\nThe more seriously injured victims were transported to other hospitals, the Ascension Providence worker said.\n\nkhall@detroitnews.com"
