        "text": "Shutdown Line 5\n\nLine 5 is a single, 30-in diameter pipe except for the section that crosses the Straits of Mackinac. That 4.5-mile section is two separate pipelines, each 20 inches in diameter, that lie on the lake bottom. The pipeline’s route through the Straits is within an easement issued in 1953 by the State of Michigan.\n\nLine 5 is maintained by Enbridge, the largest oil and gas transportation company in North America. A Canadian company, Enbridge, is headquartered in Calgary, Alberta and has been responsible for the two largest inland oil spills in the history of the United States.\n\nThere’s an endless amount of back-and-forth about this issue as I’m sure you’re well aware. There’s a great documentary produced by WDIV that I would recommend watching to get an understanding of what’s at stake.\n\nMoreover, if you’re interested in what some of Michigan’s finest engineers from the University of Michigan College of Engineering have to say, they’ve provided a great breakdown of their risk concerns, how they see the science of Enbridge’s proposed tunnel system, and the like.\n\nHere’s what it comes down to for me:\n\nAccelerate the Use of Community Solar Programs\n\nCommunity solar is defined as any solar project or purchasing program, within a geographic area, in which the benefits flow to multiple customers such as individuals, businesses, nonprofits, and other groups. In most cases, customers benefit from energy generated by solar panels at an off-site array.\n\nCommunity solar customers typically subscribe to—or in some cases own—a portion of the energy generated by a solar array, and receive an electric bill credit for electricity generated by their share of the community solar system. Community solar can be a great option for people who are unable to install solar panels on their roofs because they are renters, can’t afford solar, or because their roofs or electrical systems aren’t suited to solar.\n\nCommunity solar is rapidly growing across the country, and it’s time Michigan takes its place as the leader in community solar programs to ensure equitable access to clean energy for lower- and middle-income families.\n\nLong story short, it means supporting HB 4464 and 4465 to ensure lower energy costs for working families, drive greater investment in renewable energy for Michigan, and guarantee fairer access to our state’s green future.\n\nBan the Use of PFAS Chemicals\n\nPFAS are man-made chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products worldwide since the 1940s. They have been used to make nonstick cookware, water-repellent clothing, stain-resistant fabrics and carpets, some cosmetics, some firefighting foams, and products that resist grease, water, and oil.\n\nAccording to the federal government’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, PFAS chemicals are linked to:\n\nFertility issues and pregnancy-induced hypertension/preeclampsia\n\nIncreased cholesterol\n\nChanges in the immune system\n\nIncreased risk of certain cancers (e.g., testicular and kidney cancer)\n\nChanges in fetal and child development\n\nLiver damage\n\nIncreased risk of thyroid disease\n\nIncreased risk of asthma\n\nAnd now, researchers from the University of Indiana have confirmed that these toxic chemicals are building up in our Great Lakes. This is putting 95% of the country’s fresh water at risk and countless billions of dollars that the Great Lakes generate for Michigan annually."
