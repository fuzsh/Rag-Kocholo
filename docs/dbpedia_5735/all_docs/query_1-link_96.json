        "text": "I know this might be a weird question, but is Townes Van Zandt any good? I've seen his name appear on some lists as one of the best American songwriters of the 20th century, but I don't know any of his albums or what to listen to, I was hoping that some fans might be able to steer me into a good direction. I am aware that he is considered somewhat of a cult artist, so I figure that he probably doesn't have any great best of compilation. Any suggestions on where to start would be great.\n\nTownes is among the greatest American singer-songwriters ever, full stop. But you're right, he can be a bit tricky to kind of uncover. There are a bunch of reasons for that.\n\nSome essential songs. Go on YouTube and listen to the studio versions of these to start:\n\nSnow Don't Fall\n\nRex's Blues\n\nNo Lonesome Tune\n\nFor the Sake of the Song\n\nI'll Be Here in the Morning\n\nTower Song\n\nCome Tomorrow\n\nIf I Needed You\n\nYou Are Not Needed Now\n\nTo Live Is to Fly\n\nHigh, Low and In-Between\n\nNo Place to Fall\n\nWhen She Don't Need Me\n\nTecumseh Valley\n\nAt My Window\n\nWhy not start at the obvious and get an anthology...yes there are several\n\nLegend - Best of Townes Van Zandt\n\nBest of\n\nRead a review of Flyin' Shoes in 1978 (Rolling Stone?) and that was what got me hooked. One of the true greats, he hit emotional truths that scare most other artists away. I'd say the following are essential(sorrow I can't narrow it down better, but I think he's amazing):\n\nHigh, Low and In Between\n\nOur Mother The Mountain\n\nDelta Momma Blues\n\nLate Great Townes Van Zandt\n\nTownes Van Zandt\n\nFlyin' Shoes\n\nLive At The Old Quarter (agree this might be the best introduction, it's a terrific set)\n\nGot to see him once in the early 80's in a folk club in Greenwich Village (the name of which escapes me, maybe Folk City), he had a second guitar player and he was wonderful. Told some great stories.\n\nI’ve been a fan since the 90’s or so, when I started getting exploring music other than what top 40 radio was pushing on us.\n\nI found TVZ by looking at songwriting credits. Subsequently picked up all I could find on CD. To make a long story short, my CD’s were stolen, and stolen again after rebuilding my collection a second time.\n\nNow that I’m into vinyl, I’m buying some of my favorites on vinyl. The FIRST TVZ record I picked up was Live at The Old Quarter, the 2009 Fat Possum reissue. I believe that this album captures what he was about. There were a couple of “Overdone, overproduced” (IMO) albums where I think the record company was trying to push Townes more into the mainstream, but those just seemed a little, for lack of a better term, inauthentic to his songwriting and style.\n\nSo, my recommendation, “Live at The Old Quarter”.\n\nIf you wanted a compilation to hit the highlights, then there is an album called, I believe, “The essential Townes Van Zandt”.\n\nHe’s worth your time, IMO...\n\nDrama Falls Like Teardrops is another good 2-disc compilation.\n\nAnd then look for Rear View Mirror... there's something about the later-day, fragile live TVZ that is incredibly powerful."
