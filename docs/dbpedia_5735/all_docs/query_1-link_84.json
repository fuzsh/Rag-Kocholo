It was partly owned by actor Gene Autry (hence the callsign) through his company, Golden West Broadcasters (then-owners of KTLA in Los Angeles), and initially carried a format consisting of rolling local news programming (during the late morning and afternoon) and limited syndicated programming (in the late afternoon) on weekdays, as well as unedited movies and events from Golden West's VEU subscription service at night and on weekends.\n\n1981–1985[]\n\n1985–1992[]\n\nThis logo lasted for 13 years (until 1998), having survived a callsign change in 1992.\n\n1985–1990[]\n\nOn July 25, 1986, KAUT agreed to affiliate with the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Company as one of its original charter affiliates; it joined the network on October 9 of that year.\n\n1989–1990[]\n\n1990–1991[]\n\n1991–1992[]\n\nSVG NEEDED\n\nOn August 15, 1991, KAUT-TV was sold to the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority, becoming a secondary public television station for the Oklahoma City market for the next eight years and rebranded as \"The Literacy Channel 43\" (retaining the Fox-era circle and star \"43\" logo). The Fox affiliation meanwhile, moved to KOKH-TV.\n\nThe OETA had planned to develop a secondary PBS member station for the Oklahoma City market since 1988, when it was involved in an aborted plan in which Pappas Telecasting Companies attempted to acquire KOKH with the intent of consolidating the entertainment programming inventories of KOCB (channel 34) and KAUT — including the Fox affiliation — and migrating them onto KOKH's programming schedule. Whereas the Pappas proposal intended to make KOKH the market's lone \"independent\" station, the Heritage deal only eliminated KAUT as an independent competitor.\n\nKTLC[]\n\n1992–June 1998[]\n\nIn 1992, the station's call letters were changed to KTLC, which continued to use the logo above until 1998.\n\nKPSG[]\n\n1998–2001[]\n\nThe Paramount Stations Group subsidiary of Viacom (now Paramount) purchased KTLC from the OETA in January 1998, in order to regain UPN affiliate in the Oklahoma City market (then-affiliate KOCB switched to The WB that month, per a broader affiliation deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group, leaving UPN without a local affiliate for six months). The station became a UPN owned-and-operated station on June 20, 1998, under the new call letters KPSG (the \"PSG\" portion of the callsign refers to its then-owner, which also owned then-sister station WPSG in Philadelphia at the time).\n\nJune–November 1998[]\n\nKAUT-TV (second era)[]\n\nNovember 1998–2001[]\n\nIn November 1998, the KAUT call letters were reinstated shortly after the death of former owner Gene Autry, and the station continued to use the logo above until 2001.\n\n2001–2002[]\n\n2002–February 2006[]\n\nCoinciding with UPN unveiling a new logo, KAUT's logo was updated in September 2002, retaining the Futura \"43\" from the 1998 design (differing somewhat from the logo layouts of Paramount Stations Group's other UPN owned-and-operated stations during that time period).\n\nFebruary–September 2006[]\n\nFollowing CBS Corporation and Time Warner's joint announcement in January 2005 that UPN and The WB would be shut down and have much of their programming inventories combined into successor The CW, KAUT dropped all UPN references from its on-air branding and began temporarily identifying under the \"43\" branding, retaining the 1998 UPN-era Futura numerical logo in barebones form.\n\nSeptember 2006–2009[]\n\nOn September 15, 2005, The New York Times Company agreed to purchase KAUT from Viacom. This created a duopoly with KFOR-TV, the area's NBC affiliate. The deal was completed November of the same year. The NYT's broadcasting division, through a series of acquisitions, eventually became part of the Tribune Media Company's broadcasting division (reuniting it with KTLA under the same corporate umbrella, after Golden West Broadcasters sold both stations during the mid-1980s, with KAUT going to Rollins Broadcasting in 1984). In September 2006, when UPN and The WB were merged to form The CW, KAUT became an affiliate of MyNetworkTV (as WB affiliate KOCB picked up The CW) and changed its brand to \"OK43\", eschewing the network's standardized branding.\n\n2009–2011[]\n\nSVG NEEDED\n\n2011–2023[]\n\nSVG NEEDED\n\nIn September 2012, KSBI replaced KAUT as MyNetworkTV's Oklahoma City affiliate, resulting in the latter becoming an independent station by default.\n\n2023–2024[]\n\nDesigner: Unknown\n\nTypography: ITC Avant Garde (\"Oklahoma City\")\n\nLaunched: September 1, 2023\n\nOn September 1, 2023, KAUT became an owned-and-operated station of The CW, replacing KOCB as the network's Oklahoma City affiliate.\n\n2024–present[]\n\nDesigner: Unknown\n\nTypography: F37 Bolton (modified)\n\nLaunched: January 15,
