        "text": "Ahh gotcha, I don't remember those haha I started buying CD's with pocket money around '94-'95, by then in the UK had the small electronic tags on CDs but not the big blister packs!\n\nI love Ultramagnetic MCs! Damn if you're from NJ then you must had heard about Tame One from The Artifacts passing not so long ago\n\nYeah my friend groups were all metalheads & punkers in school and a few of them liked hip hop too, but none of us went to any shows besides rock/metal/punk either, unfortunately! Though I did go see Kris Kross live on their YO! MTV RAPS tour in like '92... If that counts Dr Dre & Ed Lover were there, I was pretty psyched bouddit\n\nThe one original longbox I wish I’d kept was ‘Tumbleweed Connection’… it was odd in that it had the proper album art on the cardboard longbox while using just the cream-coloured insert / booklet art for the jewel box inside. They were sort of incomplete without both parts… leaving the actual CD with the wrong cover.\n\nI found this photo below where someone (not me) has apparently cut down the front of the longbox (or maybe it’s an LP sleeve?) to make an insert for the jewel box… still not quite right but an improvement over the alternative.\n\nGreat album\n\nThe longboxes had fold-out cardboard supports inside that kept the jewel box from moving inside… the CD sat at the top / the lower half was empty.\n\nActually most of the time the CD sat at the bottom unless it was a budget priced, open window generic packaging release then it was more often at the top. This however excludes the original early cardboard longboxes that first came out that had the cut out windows in the bottom of the box that exposed the jewel case. Keith who used to be a member here maybe he still is (haven’t seen any posts by him in a while) has some more detail on longboxes on his website: Keith Hirsch's CD Resource » Sealed CDs\n\nI never got the point? Compact disc in a compact jewel case surrounded by a long box cover twice the size...but I guess it was good for theft protection...I had a bunch years ago...I no longer have any cardboard ones...BUT yes, I do have a clear long cover (I guess it's a box) of an original Rod Stewart Sing It Again Rod US CD West German 1st pressing...\n\nwell i have posted in two of these other ones,\n\nand i guess i'll move to over here.\n\nhave about 100 or so maybe.\n\nlater\n\n-1\n\nHave to admit I threw most of them away. I did keep one or two, including one that bears the following statement:\n\n\"You are holding a collector's item: a rare object; an endangered species. But this is one we can afford to lose - the environmentally hazardous, throwaway compact disc longbox. Only the first printing of this album will be released in a longbox - all future pressings will be shipped in a new environmentally-safer package. So you might not want to throw away this long box - in addition to keeping it out of a landfill, you'll possess one of the last of a dangerous breed\"\n\nThe artist? Who else but Sting....."
