        "text": "1019\n\nDangerous drivers thread\n\nSo I would like to start a thread where you can share your pictures, stories, descriptions of dangerous drivers. Tonight my husband and I were riding home on black street between Negley and Chislett in east liberty. A car approached us from behind as we were riding outside of the door zone and layed on his horn. He then passed us within a foot to get to the red light. My husband screamed at him that he almost hit us and the guy stopped short of the light in front of us like he was gonna start something. Some older lady sitting on her porch yelled at us to just let it go. I snapped a photo of the license. Then we continued on our way home.\n\nstefb\n\nI am convinced it is getting worse. I'm so sorry this happened.\n\njoanne\n\nColin practicing catch-and-release? Unbelievable....\n\nmarko82\n\nAt that same moment, this happened: https://twitter.com/bus15237/status/352979713955864577 Prior to the Versa, another pickup went screaming past me at half again the posted-25 limit on this part of North Ave, but at least gave me four feet of room, and did not honk. This early in the thread, I suppose I should explain my term \"fucking horn\". That's where the driver lays on the horn either right alongside or just behind you. Not a friendly \"JSYK I'm here\" toot, but an angry getthefuckouttatheway honk, hence the name.\n\nstuinmccandless\n\nI will follow up on this on Monday, but to recap--I had a conversation with Steve Patchan, the bike & ped coordinator for the city. I asked him about whether or not we could report this kind of event after the fact. The problem is, for me anyway, that a lot of the time I don't have time to call 9-1-1, sit and wait for an officer, fill out a report, and ultimately have the answer be \"Send me the video when you get it loaded.\" His initial reaction was \"call 9-1-1 when it happens\" but then he said that he was going to ask my question of one of the Zone commanders. Sorry this happened to you guys, and glad it did not escalate.\n\najbooth\n\nI know most of us have stories of calling the cops and have the mostly disregard it, but I recently had a friend call the police and the responding officer actually tracked down the driver, and got the process started for my friend file \"harassment\" charges against the driver. The downside: he is probably going to have to pay an attorney out of pocket to do so.\n\nndromb\n\nPossibly also worth mentioning, about a minute prior to this, I was first in line at the light at Grant and North in Millvale, patiently waiting out the red, which has a \"No turn on red\" sign. One person on the sidewalk mentioned to another, \"You see, some cyclists actually do it right.\"\n\nstuinmccandless\n\nBeing that it was the 4th, I am sure there were other issues viewed as more important than a cyclist getting buzzed and harassed. Didn't bother to call 911\n\nstefb\n\nThis is from Sunday: \"beware of dangerously-aggressive large black pickup ZDF 1623 & FOP tag. Several loud honks, close pass on Butler St.\" Driver pulled up behind me and gave me a big loud horn--while I was pulling up to a red light at 44th. Already a little wound up after finishing a 25-mile ride on Liberty and Butler, the horn actually made me jump. The light at 45th turns red almost as soon as the light at 44 turns green, so after pushing to get off the line I fairly well coasted half the block. Truck pulled up behind me and honked at me again, multiple times. At this point I turned around and looked at him, and he gave me a dismissive little 'get out of my way' wave. I simply turned back to the road. He honked at me again. There were several parked cars on the side, so there was no room to move over if I wanted to, and I could tell from how aggressive he was being that if I moved over even a little, he was going to blow right past me and probably hit me---there was too much traffic in the other lane for him to get close to giving me four feet. So I continued taking the lane. He started laying on the horn again as soon as started moving again, but 46th was my turn; I stopped firmly in the centre of the intersection to make a left, and he passed me with about 18 inches on the right before roaring off toward Upper LV. I thought about calling 911, but equally visible to the numbers on the plate was the FOP-donor roundel. Having experience trying to report aggressive close-passing motorists in zone 2 in the past, combined with the fact the driver apparently is a member or is associated with the police union, made me decide not to bother.\n\nepanastrophe\n\nPeople buy those roundels so they can speed. You can get them just by donating to the FOP. It's not necessarily someone who has any other association with them. So who knows, reporting the guy might work. Edit: also it might help to get one for your bike...\n\njonawebb\n\nFOP stickers are meaningless, most people who have one aren't even active donors. Even if, by chance it was a cop, he likely was out of his own jurisdiction. In other words, cops don't take those stickers seriously and neither should you. Just ask my friend who recently got a speeding ticket...\n\nheadloss\n\nCop story from NY http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/local/deputy-involved-in-bicycle-incident\n\nmarko82\n\nI did try to reach Stephen Patchan again, but he is on vacation until Monday. I'll try again then and let you know the results.\n\najbooth\n\nSpringville, NY? That's right down the road from where I grew up. I've been to bars a one-minute walk from here. The corner in question, in StreetView. Note the excellent sight lines in all directions, the street light right at the corner, and the four-way stop.\n\nstuinmccandless\n\nMarko82 wrote:Cop story from NY http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/local/deputy-involved-in-bicycle-incident\n\n\"To serve and protect\" indeed! Stu, if you know people in the area, you should forward the story to them. Sherriffs are typically elected, so it might behoove them to respond (I mean, like, honestly respond) to a situation like this.\n\nmick\n\nA bus driver complaint I just filed: http://www.portauthority.org/paac/CompanyInfoProjects/CustomerService/Feedback.aspx route 61A, inbound, bus 5310 2013/7/18 11:42 am I was bicycling westbound in the bike lane on Forbes near Dallas (before the entrance to Homewood Cemetery) and a westbound bus came up fast behind me and buzzed me about 2 feet to my left - I could have extended my arm and touched the back corner of the bus as it moved right into the lane I was biking in. This driver behaved dangerously and broke the PA 4 foot law that motorists are required to give cyclists. I suggest this driver be suspended for a week, as punishment. Please speak with the driver, ask them if they're aware of the 4 foot law, and ask them why they drove so close to me, and email me their response. Thanks.\n\npaulheckbert\n\n@paulheckbert I have buses buzz me inbound and outbound in the bike lanes on Forbes. My only thought is they don't know of the 4 foot rule or they don't think it applies when there is a bike lane. Most alarming to me is the frequency with which the buses cross into the bike lane. And Forbes between Squirrel Hill and Regent Square is so wide! What the...\n\nlizzimac\n\nThis is why I have my helmet cam facing backwards most of the time.\n\nstuinmccandless\n\nYeah, but a backwards-facing helmet cam will never catch a PA license plate. I guess it'll do fine for bus numbers though.\n\nmpm\n\nIt might not catch a plate, but it certainly would help establish the chain of events prior to an incident much better than a front-facing cam, which might not even catch that much if one is hit from behind. Really you need both, but in the year or so I've been using it, I get more interesting info from rearward. Even without a plate on camera, it would very much help identify a car if you were able to supply a partial plate number. \"Grey Nissan with a roof rack\" (from the camera) and BGZ on the plate (from what you could see of a car pulling away) would narrow it down pretty quickly.\n\nstuinmccandless\n\nHad a thought provoking incident yesterday- got buzzed very closely by a tan sedan, maybe a Camry, heading west on the Boulevard of the Allies. Caught him at a red light and tapped on the window: \"I guess you don't believe in the four foot law.\" \"You know what I believe in? I believe in RIGHTS! I pay $10,000 a year in insurance- do you pay insurance?\" \"Yes, I do pay for insurance\" Light turned green, he peeled out and buzzed a motorcycle that was turning right with about 1 foot clearance. At that point I realized his argument about insurance was crap, he was angry becuase his insurance premiums were so high, which was probably related to the fact that he is a lousy driver with anger management issues. There was no reason for me to take it personally.\n\nhelen-s\n\nWhich points to necessity of two cameras with synchronized time.\n\nmikhail\n\nIf he's paying $10k a year in insurance on a Camry, and based on the rest of the incident, I'll bet you're right on the money - he has a driving record that is \"driving\" his premiums, completely failing to connect his shitty driving to his premiums, avoiding any personal responsibility for his situation, and projecting his shittyness on others. Just supposing, of course. But, \"Rights!\".\n\nedmonds59\n\nedmonds59 wrote:If he’s paying $10k a year in insurance on a Camry, and based on the rest of the incident, I’ll bet you’re right on the money – he has a driving record that is “driving” his premiums, completely failing to connect his shitty driving to his premiums, avoiding any personal responsibility for his situation, and projecting his shittyness on others.

Female screamed at me three times - twice when I passed her and once as she passed me. Very close. Very scary.\n\ncallahan\n\nThis came across my feed today: Helmet cams antagonize drivers http://www.cyclelicio.us/2013/kha-chan-helmet-cams-antogonize-drivers/ The first comment says it all: \"also if you are female make sure to wear long skirts and long sleeves and a high neckline and ideally a veil, otherwise if you are attacked it is your fault.\"\n\nkordite\n\nPA / JBK5538 Overlook drive by the oval heading towards Greenfield Rd. (Schenley Park) Driver honks a few times then passes me with inches to spare. (The opposing lane was empty.) I filed a police report as that was not just badly behaved traffic but was assault. There are several issues here that really incense me. I should explain for anyone that doesn't know that overlook drive is a side road in the park. People park on both sides and frequently get in and out of cars making the door zone extra dangerous. The road there has also been recently paved and is on a slight downhill grade. This means I was probably cruising along about 15 mph anyway but considering that it's a park, I could have been riding at 2 mph and it should not be a problem. What really got me mad though was the guy walking nearby. After the car goes by, I ask the guy for a pen to write down the plate #. He says no and follows it up with \"Ha Ha Ha... He almost got you...\" It's REAL FUCKING FUNNY when someone almost hits you with a car on purpose! I did get a pen from a person up on the oval. After that I had so much adrenaline pumping that I think I was passing cars going up hills on my single speed. I'm also glad that I resisted my urge after the initial honk to give the finger - who knows what may have happened.\n\nandyc\n\nCallahan wrote:Plate: JBM2521 Millvale. Dumb white car.

The car color and license plate # seem familiar and the behavior is the same as the encounter I had with her. She yelled and told me the get off the road. The passed me super close at an accelerated speed. Then I passed her and she did the same thing again, the second time cutting me off at the next light so I was not able to filter ahead. Crazy lady. She did this to me around the Hardees.\n\nturboweasel\n\n@Callahan and @J.Str. I roll through Millvale a couple of times a week, and always have my backward pointed helmet cam running. I will memorize that plate and if I see her again, especially with a negative interaction, I will PM you with video and details. Other than white, do you have a more detailed description of the car? Or her? One asshat at a time.\n\nstuinmccandless\n\nLast week on the decaf ride there was a crappy white crapalier (I think) that passed a few of us going up Stanton ave. no close pass but she screamed something at me that I couldn't make out and then screamed at the guy ahead of me to get on the sidewalk. May be different people but her screaming was unnecessary.\n\nstefb\n\nWell, after a long time of successfully keeping my emotions in check, I nearly got into an altercation this morning after nearly being left-crossed on the way down Beechwood. Maybe it's lucky I was riding my new MTB because a few more mph may well have made the difference - but I was probably still doing close to 25 when I had to slam on the brakes to avoid getting clobbered. Since I was basically stopped anyways and realized he was turning onto a short dead-end street, I made the (likely ill-advised) decision to give chase. He pulled into a driveway, where I took a picture of him - honestly the driver wasn't nearly as big of a prick as the (younger) guy who came out of the house and proceeded to threaten me, calling me \"fag\", \"pussy\", \"you don't belong on this street\", \"you don't pay taxes\", etc. I managed to avoid getting into trading insults with him - I said I only wanted to get to work safely and cutting me off like that to save a couple seconds was extremely dangerous. The driver didn't even play the \"I didn't see you\" card - he said he saw me and I had \"plenty of time\" to avoid him, and he would have done the same if I were driving a car. Regardless, I felt like perhaps I could have had a reasonable conversation with the driver but the douchebag (son?) only continued with his threats and insults and telling me to \"get off his street\", so I just gave up and went to work. Shitty way to start the day - I was thinking what a gorgeous day it was, happily putting along enjoying my brand new bike (2nd ride!), on a quiet road near a park with actual bike lanes, and suddenly it's a big bowl of turds.\n\nsalty\n\nI'm wondering how their property taxes dropped $412 over the last year.\n\nquizbot\n\nhe sounds lonely. you should have offered him a hug.\n\ncburch\n\nAt one point he said, \"you don't know me\" - to which I obviously replied, \"so? you don't know me either\", and I considered extending my hand to introduce myself and try to salvage the whole stupid situation. But, since he was so f'n aggro, it was 2-v-1, and I was still astride the bike and thus pretty vulnerable, I thought better about getting that close. Well, I guess I just have to reset my \"days since losing my shit\" board to 0 and go on... and maybe think about firing up the gopro again. I went out for a nice ride this evening, mostly on the river trails to get away from cars - although for some reason I decided crossing the west end bridge and traversing the circle to carson would be fun... where of course I got buzzed a couple times - just enough to restore my faith in people being assholes. but otherwise it was therapeutic. I ingested some medication at OTB and rode the buses home.\n\nsalty\n\nHelmet cams are a good idea as long as you're not antagonizing drivers with them.\n\nquizbot\n\nI prefer to do my antagonizing the old fashioned way.\n\nsalty\n\nI'm thinking about sending them some pizza as a thank you. Maybe 2 or 3 months from now.\n\nquizbot\n\nQ - buy the pizza now. Deliver it in three months. Makes you wonder how someone could possibly be driven to beat someone's head in with a u lock. Not.\n\nedmonds59\n\n@salty, With bikefest just around the corner... one could put together a dead end street ride.

I knock on the window. He looks at me. I motion him to roll down the window a bit. No dice. Eventually he relents and turns down his radio. I point out to him that he passed me too close (he actually startled me, and I'm mostly used to this stuff). He rolls his eyes. I remind him of the 4' rule and ask him to drive like a \"normal\" person. (In retrospect the latter comment was uncalled for; it should have been \"drive safely\", with a smile.)

I was in East Liberty, riding north on Highland coming up to the ELB. I'm in the right lane which is clear, and the light is green; in any case I'd be turning right onto ELB. There is a row of cars in the left lane, presumably because the head car is trying to turn left. Suddenly a car pull out right in front of me. I have to stop very fast and end up tumbling. The driver pauses, looks back, then takes off. A couple of people at the bus shelter report the same and add that the driver was a woman. They are sympathetic and offer help, as does a biker who shows up shortly after (if you read this board, thanks! I really appreciated you stopping). The car was an older, squarish hatchback. Grey. With a Texas plate, the older kind that's all beige with black characters. I only managed to remember that the license has the sequence \"355\" in it. The plate is ~5 digits, divider, three letters. My impression is that the owner may live in Highland Park, or maybe travels through there on a regular basis. The time was ~6:30pm. Be careful around it. If you have information (like you spot the car and get the full plate number), please let me know by PM. After dinner and after the adrenaline starts to wear off, I have a chest pain (like maybe from a handle bar), a sore elbow and a bruised palm. I had a helmet, so even though I banged my head, it didn't get hurt. The chest hurt a lot when I sneezed. I'll wait until tomorrow morning to maybe worry about any of it. In the meanwhile, a couple of ibuprofens. The local police station is walking distance so I decide to go make a report. I'm not optimistic, but you may as well try. I learn the following: 1) If there's no hit, there's no hit and run. Officially your accident was caused by a \"phantom\" car. Nothing will be done. 2) Yes, it counts as dangerous driving, but only police witnessing the event can make that determination.\n\nahlir\n\n3) Helmet cam should override 2) in case of officer absence during the event\n\nquizbot\n\nLarge black Jeep SUV ESZ 2591 going east on Schenley Drive next to the Pitt Library on Thursday around 6:30 pm. Driver is around mid 30's, short reddish hair with short goatee and mustache, piercings on right ear. I caught up to him at the light and calmly said he was allowed to cross the double yellow to pass me (there was not other traffic when he buzzed by very close). He irritatedly said I needed to move over, at which point I stated I had a right to use the road also. His reply was \"fuck off-you can take down my plate.\" I did not, but fortunately there was another cyclist at the light also listening to the interchange- when the driver left he gave me the plate and make of car and said he had an interchange with the same driver which was much worse. I neglect to say thanks to the other cyclist- but am doing so now- thanks! I did have an exchange that morning on Frew Street with a driver who buzzed me coming down the hill in the golf course. When I pointed out he passed me very closely he gave me puppy dog eyes and said he would try to do better in the future. I was convinced he would until as I was leaving he said \"Hey, I didn't hit you, did I?\"\n\nhelen-s\n\nHere's a good one... I'm coming down Wilkins, to the left side of the left turn lane since I'm turning left on Beechwood, and slowing down since I've got a red light. As I approach the intersection, a SUV/Minivan makes a wide right turn from Beechwood and starts coming at me head-on, in my lane, beeping the horn. I had ample time to swerve right to avoid any trouble, and as I pass, I see the driver (still honking) is also making a \"what am I supposed to do\" kind of gesture. Then I realized the reason she was in my lane was because she essentially right hooked another cyclist - who was luckily also turning right but was now stuck between her vehicle and the curb. A two-fer! Yet apparently the driver is too ignorant to understand how the entire problem was 100% her fault. sigh.\n\nsalty\n\nIt's odd how some people all of a sudden can't imagine that they have to wait their turn and not run people over when it involves a bike.\n\nrsprake\n\nOh yeah, that reminds me.

At least it was better than running the red completely. So kudos to you, SUV driver! Know that your vague half-hearted stab at competent driving was much appreciated, as I trust I conveyed to you with my eye-rolling and head-shaking as I walked into the traffic lane to get around your crosswalk-blocking vehicle.\n\nsteven\n\nWife and I had our first legitimate near miss with a dangerous driver this afternoon while out on a mini practice run for part of the Pedal Pgh route. As we were approaching the T at the end of Mellon Terrace near Highland Park (an area of town that I'm not extremely familiar with), I yelled back to my wife, who was even less familiar with the area, that there was no stop sign, so we had the right of way. As we were turning left towards the park, a car came flying down Mellon Street from the park at an excessive rate of speed and forced us to slam on the brakes, which in turn startled the driver of the car behind us. I assumed that I had missed a partially hidden stop sign, and made more of a mental note of it being an unmarked hazard for next week's trip over this section. Before reporting it, I checked out streetview, looking for the sign I may have missed. Lo and behold, I DID have the right of way (no stop sign), and not only was the offending driver speeding, he also blew through a DO NOT ENTER/ALL TRAFFIC MUST TURN RIGHT sign combo in his direction of travel. Google shows Mellon Street to be One Way towards the park from at least Bryant Street to Mellon Terrace. Quite an experience on what was otherwise a great day for a ride.\n\nsmarchit\n\nI had two on Sunday. First I was biking home from work on Blvd of the Allies in downtown. I'm not on sidewalks because that's illegal. I stop at the intersection at Cherry Way and Blvd. Although there was no traffic AND they had blocked Cherry Way to my right(so I wouldn't be cutting across traffic if I went) I didn't go through the red light since that's illegal and drivers were behind me. Light turns green and the car behind me wants to pass but there is a car next to him for the turn lane at Grant and Blvd. Driver speeds up to at least 25 MPH within the lane and passes me with very, very little space. The part that pisses me off most is that the light at Grant and Blvd has been red the ENTIRE TIME. I get to the light and look at the driver with my arms outstretched and he yells \"You need to get the f*** over!\" I responded \"I am over did you even look at the f***ing light? It's red you don't need to do that.\" He just says \"fuck you\" and speeds off. Later, the same exact thing happened to me at 5th and Wilkins with a driver cutting me very closely in order to get to a red light. However, I didn't say anything because they had their kid in the car and I would've flipped out on them based on what happened earlier. It's infuriating because for one I was following the law and the drivers weren't. Two, I was being \"courteous\" by not taking the lane which would've perhaps prevented them from trying. Three, if I HAD broken the law by going through the light at Cherry Way, I would have cleared Blvd of the Allies before that car came anywhere near me.\n\nmjacobpgh\n\nmjacobPGH wrote:I was being “courteous” by not taking the lane which would’ve perhaps prevented them from trying\n\nStop doing that. I don't mean to criticize your riding, and it's just my opinion, but this almost always turns out bad for the cyclists. Taking the full lane forces the guy to either follow you in the lane or change lanes in order to get past you. Try it for awhile and see if it makes a difference for you. -I will share the road, but NOT my lane-\n\nmarko82\n\nYea, I know. I do, at times, take the lane. I don't think I was consciously making a decision to not take the lane in this instance but I should probably do it more often. I honestly didn't think it was necessary on Blvd of the Allies since traffic was moving so slowly but I often do take the lane while I am on Fifth(which I am only riding on briefly) and people still pass VERY close.\n\nmjacobpgh\n\n@mjacobPGH. Yeah taking the lane is no guarantee that a driver still won’t be a dick and pass you dangerously, but I think it gives the message that you are confident in what you are doing and that you belong on the road. (Which you also showed by stopping at the light! +1) Recent Bad Example: I was stopped at a red light a few weeks ago as the only vehicle/bike in the queue, bike positioned dead center of the travel lane – when a motorcycle stops behind me then passed me on my RIGHT in order to turn right on red. WTF!\n\nmarko82\n\nI'll name names here, as he's been mentioned both in this forum before as well as written anti-cyclist comments in the P-G. James Love. He does not own a car, but does have a license and rents a ZipCar every once in a while. We had it out on Facebook in a thread that went on for four days a few months ago; a few of you may have participated in it. Anyway, we got into yet another argument on Facebook yesterday. He firmly believes cyclists are breaking the law by taking the lane, and we should all be fined. No amount of quoting the actual law, or pointing out what would be blatantly obvious to any of us, makes any difference. Why I bring this up is that, since I know the guy so well, I can understand where at least this one is coming from. How well that can be applied to others is subjective, but the essence of it is this: They never learned how to think. They learned what to think, and further, learned never to question that. Yesterday's argument concerned this photo: ...to which he posted on Facebook: These bikers known as Bike Pittsburgh refuse to follow road rules. They refuse to allow traffic to pass them to keep up speeds of safety. Some on a two lane road take up whole lane which is permitted when safe to do. However they need to move to right when vehicles come behind them and they are refusing to let traffic pass them. One in a Bike Pittsburgh post in facebook main page has been caught for all of us to see driving in uncoming lane which is wrong. ... I refuse to involved with a bike group which refuses to follow road laws. If I see traffic behind me I have the brains to move to the right or stop to let traffic pass. And then, in the private conversation, this happened: Stuart Strickland In that photo, if you came up behind them, what would you do? (and those bikers are fully in the right, except for the guy in front who's a couple inches over the line) James Love blow my horn to have lane open to pass or call police to have you fined for un safe biking * * * So, there you have it, some insight into the sort of thinking of those behind the wheel giving us a hard time.\n\nstuinmccandless\n\nI basically always feel \"damned if I do, damned if I don't\" while commuting; you can't make everyone happy. You can either be a nice, courteous biker and let people take liberties with you(sounds like a metaphor for life) or be a proactive biker who makes it harder for people to risk your safety but pissing them off more at the same time. Engaging with internet trolls hardly seems worth it anymore(I have done enough on the PG commentary but can't stop responding to some of the idiocy). Most of them aren't representative of drivers. I do truly believe that most drivers don't endanger bikers out of any hostility or malice but mostly pure impatience and ignorance.\n\nmjacobpgh\n\nI've grown very familiar with my commute and act as I think appropriate on each individual road segment. E.g. approaching an intersection where I've gotten buzzed when drivers try to move around traffic in the left lane, I'll take the lane. But on a wide road where there's plenty of space to pass and drivers have never given me a problem I ride to the right. Since I'm familiar with the route and with what drivers are likely to do I'm happy to give them a little more freedom. But if I was riding an unfamiliar road I would be more assertive and take the lane more aggressively to prevent getting buzzed etc. The more used I get to this style of biking, the more I see myself as controlling the behavior of motorists and being responsible for my own safety, rather than simply being at motorist's mercy. You really don't have to just accept that you're going to get buzzed sometimes; you can do something about it. And you will find that the vast majority of drivers simply accept that you are taking the lane and will drive appropriately. Yes, you will get the occasional driver that lays on the horn and passes aggressively and illegally. But that is a lot more rare (and arguably less dangerous) than drivers who simply don't acknowledge your presence and pass far too closely, when you ride to the right.\n\njonawebb\n\nI find the courteous middle ground is to pull over and let people pass. In most places, there will be an opening to pass safely and normally soon enough but if that is not the case, I'd much rather help people to pass around me safely than be trailed by a queue of festering hatred. Regarding the photo above, I would probably be mad if I came across that group on a country road (though that looks more like a park) and they made no effort to let me pass safely. In a group that size I would think you need to have some plans beforehand on how to split into smaller packs such that people can get around you. Otherwise it's like apportioning a parade route if the pack is too big to get around.\n\nandyc\n\nOh, James Love. A stellar example of the Dunning-Kruger effect, to the extreme. So absolutely incompetent that he is absolutely convinced of his own correctness. For everyone else's info, I have met this person, and he is an odd, odd bird, his opinions should in no way be taken to represent the average thinking person's. How he is able to get the ear of any media is nothing more than an indication of the pathetic state of our media, just looking for sensationalism and ratings. @mjacobPGH - I use a mirror, which greatly reduces the element of surprise as to what drivers may be doing behind me. If I see a car coming up behind that appears to be on a line that will not give me adequate passing room, I will ease out further and leave them no option. If nothing else, that gives me more safe bailout space if they still decide to buzz close. For the 90%+ of the cars that pass, I just hold my line. Also fyi, I generally ride the right hand wheel-track of the auto tires, I find it to be the cleanest and safest line.\n\nedmonds59\n\nBlack 4-runner, P/D plate 3904F, definite contender for the \"just plan stupid\" award. On my way to/from work I climb over the short but steep hill on Negley between Fair Oaks and Wilkins. As I crest the hill, I take the lane, all the way to the yellow line, since I'm turning left at the bottom in either direction. My other reason for doing that is to dissuade people from doing exactly what this guy did which is try to pass me on a steep downhill where there's not enough room. And, in the AM direction there are often cars or contractor vehicles parked which is one more reason to take the lane. Yesterday at PP marko and I were talking about the importance of taking the lane to prevent unsafe passes, so that was also on my mind. Anyways, I heard the engine behind me and then got that little tingly feeling like \"OMG this guy is going to pass me\". The light was red and a line of cars were waiting so he especially didn't have room to do it, plus there was a car coming up the hill. I glanced over my shoulder to see him fully in the other lane. There were only two ways this was going to end, with a head-on crash (which the driver seemed pretty committed to) or with him swerving into me, so I hit the brakes. I think the guy coming up the hill must have done the same, but our hero just kept on going. The head-on had to be pretty close regardless. Then he had to slam on his brakes to keep from rear ending the cars in our lane. Keep in mind this is all in a few hundred feet of pavement, on a ~10% grade. I saw his window was down and all I could think to say was \"are you f'n stupid?\"... followed by \"get off the road until you learn to drive\". I didn't hear whatever he was saying back but I'm sure it was stupid.\n\nsalty\n\nGFB 2533, burnt-orange sedan (Chevy Cobalt? A smallish American car with spoiler, but 4-door), late-40s or early-50s white male. 2' pass on SB Neville between Centre and Bayard yelling \"move over\". As usual, light was red at Bayard--he then tries to tell me 4' law means I'm supposed to move over so he can give me 4'. (Neville, of course, is lined with parked cars. There was no 'over' to move to.) Trying to decide if the color of his car has infected his brain, or if he's so completely full of shit it's even turned his car the colour of diarrhea. Either way, watch out for him. (Other weekend fun: Harley rider who passed me @ ~18 inches on Arlington near 18th, then kept repositioning himself to block me from filtering past him and the pickup in front of him. I went around on the left to rejoin the other cyclists at the light. About two blocks later, he again passed me very close--I nearly let the inner mule take over.)\n\nepanastrophe\n\nsalty wrote:I saw his window was down and all I could think to say was “are you f’n stupid?”… followed by “get off the road until you learn to drive”.

He didn't lik...e this picture at all, rolled his window down, passed me at the light and said I needed to take the bike lane because I was holding up traffic. 1. The bike lane there isn't safe. Because of parking, side street traffic can't see you and pulls right out into the bike lane. You also have dooring possibilities but the former is why I don't take it. Plus it just ends. 2. I can go a fair speed here (20+) and rarely have confrontation. Anyone who thinks you should be in a bike lane because you're holding up traffic really thinks you shouldn't be on the road. Watch out for this guy. He seriously could have been safer had he passed me within the 1 or 2 feet on my right, but chose to swerve into me to yell at me. Adding to this: he got in the turning lane to cross Bloomfield bridge, the lady in the front had a green arrow but traffic was backed up and there was an ambulance coming with sirens going. I could hear the, I think, familiar horn going behind her. People who drive this way are overall aggressive drivers. They endanger me on a bike, sure, but absolutely endanger you in your car, in a crosswalk, on a motorcycle.\n\nkitaira\n\nYeah, that's the main point here. The same people who are buzzing bikes are almost clipping pedestrians, speeding, taking chances around other cars, etc. It's not really an issue only for us; we're just more aware of it because we're more vulnerable and we see what's going on on the road more readily.\n\njonawebb\n\nkitaira wrote:2.

I frankly wish that rather than 'refreshing' the bike lanes on Friendship Avenue, they'd been removed. The lanes along the park are too small, and put cyclists either in the door zone (inbound) or in the frequently debris-filled gutter (outbound); since the roadway isn't big enough for cars, let alone larger vehicles to pass safely, the only safe option is for cyclists to ride down the middle, where the sharrows should be. The bike lane on outbound Friendship between Cedarville and the park seems to be in use as a parking lane for the funeral home on that block about every third day. If they need it that badly, maybe we should just let them have it and eliminate this section as well. At the very least, sharrows should be added in the main lane beside every 'bike lane' marker---far too many still think that just because a bike lane exists, a cyclist is required to ride in it.

I came to a full stop while signaling my intentions to turn left. A pickup approaches from my left and starts to slow; as I enter the intersection he just keeps on going without stopping yelling for me to get off the road. If I hadnt of been paying attention he would have nailed me. (white male mid 40’s) • Sitting second in line at a stop light at 26th and Carson waiting to turn right. Light turns green and the car in front of me turns left. As I start to make my turn a small SUV from opposite me on 26th makes a left turn right into me. As I yell “hey!” as loud as I can she hits the brakes and puts her hand to her mouth in the classic “I didn’t see you” expression. I was wearing one of my neon green jerseys with my front blinky running. (white female mid 30’s with kids in back seat) • A few blocks up Carson near the Stop-n-go a piece of shit dark four door Chrysler with Jersey plates weaved off line so much that not only did he almost hit me in the bike lane, he almost hit a parked car. I yelled for him to put the phone away when he brake checked me and threatened to ‘get out and settle it’. As there were lots of people standing around he just took off. (black male early 30’s) • Going outbound on Carson towards Becks run. I usually ride in the right tire track here unless there are cars coming toward me in the opposite direction, then I signal and move over to take the full lane. When there is no more oncoming traffic I move to the right and wave the cars behind me to pass. I did that today and the guy immediately behind me was courteous and giving me some space. The dickweed behind him was laying on the horn. As I got to Paige’s Dairy I pulled into their lot, and the guy with the horn pulled in behind me. A very threatening situation ensued. Gold Toyota Camry HPK-3716. Police report filed. (two black men mid 20’s to mid 30’s) Edit: The officer was very professional & understanding while taking the report • Going up Beck’s run toward home. Two lanes southbound, I’m taking full lane with no other traffic in sight. Cream Toyota corolla passes me within two feet; although I must say she was probably the only car I saw going below the speed limit today. (white woman in 70’s or 80’s with two other silver hairs in the car with her) All this in under 30 miles & Hey it’s only 2 o’clock! I’m posting this because we always talk about profiling SUV drivers and such, but the only common thread is that each of these drivers was capable of causing me harm today. Different car types, ethnicities, ages, and temperaments. Be safe out there!\n\nmarko82\n\nWTF, Marko?!?! Are you okay?? I had a dangerous driver incident Thursday--white woman, 30s, white Chevy Aspen, license plate HGD-8808. I was in my car, so if this doesn't belong here, let me know and I'll edit the post--but I thought it was worth documenting this menace. She was behind me on Allegheny River Blvd, on the phone and eating, swerving all over the road, tailgating, running up on me and nearly hitting me multiple times. When I slowed down and motioned to her to back off the bumper of my little car with her big car, she positioned herself about a foot off my bumper, starting flashing her lights and laying on the horn. We drove that way all the way down ARB toward Washington Blvd, me going about 20 mph and her looming behind me, raging and trying to menace me with her vehicle. She finally passed me, very closely, and I ended up behind her at the light taking lots of pictures of her plate.\n\njoanne\n\ntotally should have called 911 and reported n erratic and possibly drunk driver. zone 5 could have set up a welcome party.\n\ncburch\n\n@ joanne, just another day in paradise.... Thankfully Page's has cameras and had a few witnesses to discourage gun play.\n\nmarko82\n\nThis is my first post on this forum. I am happy to see a place where one can vent frustrations with fellow urban bikers. My friends and family who don't cycle just don't understand. But anyways, I was a large cyclist through college in State College and then lived in Denver for a few years and cycled that city's extensive trail and bike lane system. I came back to Pittsburgh went on a few year hiatus from cycling till recently I became re-born with a vengeance. There are so many dangerous drivers, but some are more scary. There are ignorant dumbasses who drive in bike lanes, don't give 4 feet, etc, and then there are the dangerous short fused drivers who who want to deliberately attempt to cause an accident with cyclist. I noticed that Pittsburgh drivers are angry, hostile, and aggressive. I have so many stories of angry drivers from this summer that it isn't even funny. But I will rant about my one today. I was biking down Carson Street and got in the left turning lane to make a left onto the Birmingham street bridge bike lane. The light turned to a green arrow and I was behind two cars. I kept up at the same exact speed and was making a left in the lane in clear view of every car. A mid to late 20 something male driving a green SUV explorer was driving Carson St from the southside works making a right onto the Birmingham street bridge as my lane had the green arrow. He clearly had a yield sign, and had to wait for cars and bikes to come. (this would take 20 seconds). I was biking right behind a car and tried to get over to the lane, yet he just keeps going and nearly swipes me by less than a foot. Then he speeds around me barely missing me. As I yelled, he pulled down his window down and said, \"you got a problem!?\". Yeah, meathead, you almost took my life by driving illegally and then wind down your window to ask me that? He then slowed down on the bridge waiting for me. Cars behind him forced him to keep going. I did absolutely nothing illegal. It is one thing to dodge a driver who is ignorantly stupid, yet another to be pushed around by a tough guy in a suv pushing his gas pedal down, and yet this is just another typical day of biking the Burgh.\n\nshooflypie\n\n@SFP, welcome to the message board! Just try to remember that there are many very nice drivers out there too. People that will wait to give you twelve feet of clearance, not just four. I know I just put a whole list together myself above, but the truth is that most of these assholes are being dicks to other car drivers too. It's more personal for us since our margin of safety is so small compared to a two ton piece of steel, but that guy would have cut you off if you were driving a car too. And, he probably went home and kicked his cat.\n\nmarko82\n\n@ShooFlyPie - Welcome to the board. You'll find that there are quite a few of us who have similar stories. But we also have ... the Good News Thread ...in which you can share stories of cool & fun & uplifting interactions with fellow travelers, motorized and non-.\n\nstuinmccandless\n\nWhile biking in Cincinnati I came upon this sad sight: on this road: https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Lunken+Airport,+Cincinnati,+OH&hl=en&ll=39.111621,-84.419452&spn=0.001261,0.00192&sll=41.117935,-77.604698&sspn=5.015043,7.866211&oq=lunken&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=39.111708,-84.41939&panoid=rUK5bhChmO5hxGjc1OQvag&cbp=12,213.72,,0,1.76 east of downtown. A little googling turned up the story of Andrew Gast, a cyclist out for a pre-dawn bike ride to work, rear-ended by a car doing 50mph in a 40mph zone, and killed. Some reporting on the incident: http://www.ohiobikelawyer.com/bike-law-101/2012/09/andrew-gast-ohios-11th-cycling-death-of-2012-hits-close-to-home/ And how the sentencing turned out: \"[The driver,] White pleaded no contest to vehicular homicide... Judge William Mallory ordered Melvin White, 50, to serve two years of house arrest and suspended his driver's license for three years. Mallory also ordered White to pay $1,000 to a bicycle safety program called Queen City Blinkies and serve 100 hours of community service\". http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/melvin-white-charged-with-hitting-killing-bicyclist-to-appear-in-court-for-sentencing\n\npaulheckbert\n\nTwo years of house arrest? Wow, could be a real hardship... But I guess at least your friends (assuming you have any) can always come by and party with you. And you can always order in some pizza and most any other delectable; I bet Cincinnati has GrubHub! And of course he has the internets to keep him busy; what more do you need these days? The gift of otaku, it keeps on giving. That bicycle guy? Well, he's dead, so who cares. Sorry, it's all a bit frustrating. As a rule: always try to get the license number and call 911.\n\nahlir\n\nI dunno. I find the sentencing to be heartwarming compared with what happens with similar crashes in PA. (see, for example, Don Parker.)

I'd like to post video of the confusing intersection at 7th and Liberty but or some reason, I can't get Contour to upload anything. Anyhoo, I think this is one of those intersections that only Pittsburghers know how it works, as I had an altercation with a giant SUV with Colorado plates after I left the BikePGH! (Park)ing Spot yesterday. I dawned me afterwards that this intersection has no painted arrows or signs to indicate that drivers in either lane should proceed straight, left or right. I'm so used to drivers just *knowing* that the right lane is for those who are going straight or turning right and the left lane is for left-turners and it might be confusing for out-of-towners, yes? Here's screenshots of Mister Giant Colorado SUV's \"I'm going to cut in front of you.\" altercation: I pull up in the right hand lane with a red light: Mister Giant SUV pulls up next to me and turns his wheels like he's planning to cut in front on me: Then, I pull up further, make eye contact with him so he knows I'm there: When the light turns green, I proceed down 7th ave and he lays on the horn at me in the intersection and tries to cut me off. When we get down to Ft Duquesne Blvd, I stop on the side, next to where he's pulled up and give him the stink eye and gesture with some \"What's your beef?!\" arms. (ironically enough, right next to a \"Friend, Carpenter, Cut Her a Break\" bus shelter poster) The car *behind* Mister Giant SUV is beeping and the driver is screaming at Mister Giant SUV that he should yielded to me and that I had the right of way. Naturally, Mister can't hear what she's screaming from inside his Tank. She pulled up next to me and gave me words of encouragement. I don't know how you deal with shit on a regular basis. I don't think I have the intestinal fortitude. Should I have done anything differently?\n\nrustyred\n\nThat driver passing right when you're about to be in the bike lane is absurd not to mention you appear to be going pretty fast(probably close to 25MPH). In terms of doing anything differently, I'm not sure that there is much you can do. You could always try the most polite route and say \"I had the right of way back there\" and see what their response is and take it from there. I am helmet camera-less, so I try to limit my interactions with drivers as much as possible because there are some insane people out there.\n\nmjacobpgh\n\nHonestly, I think you were totally in the right. As for doing things differently, any time I'm stopped at a red light, I try to stop in the dead center of the lane in order to avoid being right hooked right off the green. Plus, if someone's showing the signs of doing something that gives me the choice of being 'right' but unsafe or 'wrong' but safe, I choose the latter. I'd have just let the guy do his thing and go on with my life, albeit shaking my head in disgust. For example, I said I alway stop in the dead center? Here's a motorcyclist who comes up to pass me on the right! I could either let him do it and go after him or try to cut him off by moving forward. I just let him do it (with bonus red light running by another cyclist even farther on the right!). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTtcTys4D3o\n\nczarofpittsburgh\n\n@czar, lame... we need a dangerous drivers segment on KDKA or something to show how stupid some people are. @rusty, it takes strength of character to stand up repeatedly to these jerks... if they didn't already have a self-righteous attitude to begin with, the interaction would have never occurred. Once in a blue moon, a driver will admit to a mistake and apologize. Perhaps kind words and facts one day (even if the message doesn't seem to sink in) will change a future outcome... hang in there.\n\nheadloss\n\nUgh, the bad attitude by dangerous drivers after they do something reckless and wrong bothers me more than the reckless and wrong action itself!

Driving like that, it's not far off. @rr, you could have backed down when he made it clear he was going to be an asshole. Being in front of a driver that's acting like can be dangerous. OTOH, it's not bad to stand up for yourself -- and in a situation like that, with an asshole behind me, I'd just take the lane. The whole time--so he's not pulling up beside me at the light, he's behind. If he leans on the horn, you know he sees you. Sometimes passive aggression is not only gratifying, it's also the safest way to go.\n\njonawebb\n\nI was biking the Beechwood bike lane in Squirrel Hill coming from Greenfield going to Shadyside. I met up with a pickup at the intersection at Beacon. I stopped completely (as I always do at the sign) and waited my turn and started heading up Beechwood parallel with him. When I came up to Beechwood I was approaching a red light. However, at the time of riding to the light I noticed the light for Forbes turned red while approaching the intersection. I looked both ways and did not stop peddling as when I started to go through the line of the intersection it turned green for me. I always stop at red lights and will only treat stop signs as yields in residential neighborhoods. However, I realized I would keep my momentum in this instance as the light for me was turning green in 2 seconds. I ride parallel with this truck down to the Wilkins ave intersection where the light is red. I stopped next to him. I am just minding my own business waiting for the light to turn back to green. He winds down his window and starts yelling at me for \"running the green light\" at Forbes. I responded by telling him that the light was red for both ways and by the time I entered the intersection it was green. I then proceeded to tell him that I didn't need his opinion. Then he and his wife were going on how bikers are a problem with this city, and I shouldn't be on the road. This of course sends my arrogant mouthy personality off as I take urban biking rights serious. I insult his obvious weight issue. He gets out of his truck and tells me \"Get off the Bike.\" I calmly said, \"Dude, you are like massively overweight and you really don't want to mess with a guy who runs and bikes everyday.\" while positioning my bike chain with lock on the end off my bag. I then go on more about being a fat ass who needed a large pick up truck to compensate for something. Ok, I looking back on it and realize I need to calm my mouth, but in certain instances I just let it go when I get really ticked. However, the light turned green and cars behind him are honking as he realizes he has to waddle back to his truck as he is blocking traffic by trying to act tough. This is when it gets bad. The guy gets back into his truck while I am back to peddling down Beechwood, speeds up and comes near me at a high rate of speed trying to intimidate me and force me out of the bike lane, and then gets in front of me in the bike lane and slams on his brakes forcing me to slam on my breaks and skidding. I bet his old larger wife in the passenger seat was really exited by how tough her husband was by using his truck as means of intimidation. Maybe making fun of his weight issues and need for compensation for a large Chevy truck made him mad. Maybe it wasn't right on my end. Even if I did fully run through a red light with no regard to traffic laws (which I didn't) nobody deserves to a close encounter of being severely hurt by a large pick up at a high rate of speed or having to almost ride into it. What I find really ironic is he is falsely accusing me of not obeying laws (at worst a small ticket) and then decides to try to attempt using his truck as a weapon (could be felony) in response. If you see a green Silverado with a large man with grey hair in the mirror, make sure you keep a good eye out. He is real tough behind that thing.\n\nshooflypie\n\nFirst off, thanks for the report, we need this. We need video too, get some of these buggers off the road. Shameless plug: http://localhost/mb/topic/anyone-with-a-smartphone-and-wire-hanger-can-record-their-rides Will say one thing though, It's poor form to break into insults if someone just says something that annoys you. Stay on point, don't escalate, or if you're too annoyed or weary, disengage. Now clearly, anyone try to use 2 1/2 tons of steel is it as a weapon in response to a verbal slight is clearly not deserving of the privilege to drive. Just saying, there's no need to push buttons on ignoramuses to see if they're also hotheads and plenty of good practical reasons not to when in traffic.\n\nbyogman\n\nI go buzzed in a right hook at 5th and Robinsons by vanity PA license \"Miss Jay.\" Apparently she can't wait (leterally) 2 seconds to make a safe turn.

The way the person was driving, it struck me as likely there would be other problems wtih them, though.\n\nmick\n\nI was buzzed very close last night after coming up through the golf course at Schenley. I had just come up from the stop sign joining Forbes and was close to cresting the top of the hill there next to some parked cars. The 61a was coming the other direction so I moved over some to make sure that no one could try and squeeze past. This guy still tried though and if I hadn't made a quick dive in to the right after the parked car I think he may have hit me. Green/turquoise BMW 3 Series, new looking, I didn't get the plate. Him: 6ft (ish) dark hair, pretty big build. So I followed him up Forbes where he parked near Little's Shoes so I stopped and calmly pointed out that he nearly killed me. He quickly turned (remained?) aggressive and told me that if I wanted to be on the road then I should follow the same rules as cars. I told him that I was doing just that when he broke the law. he continued to tell me that I should leave since he \"didn't want to go to jail today\" and after me attempting to get him to realize that since he got where he was going at the same time I did, he could have done it without endangering a life, all I got was \"I don't want to waste my breath on you, walk away\" So I did, I moved up traffic filtering along between the parked and stopped cars. He shouted something after me, so I got off the bike and walked back down on the sidewalk to find out what his deal was. I started telling him \"I'm not starting anything here, I'm trying to make it home safely and would like some space\", I was met with \"walk away, stop getting all up in my face\" (I wasn't even near him) \"You're lucky my kids are here\". A man that needs his children to be around to stop him from violence? I gave up, and walked away - no good can come from talking to someone like that who is incapable of having a reasonable conversation. Wish my camera was charged, wish I got his plate, wish this sort of thing was less common. Ride safe.\n\nalanowski\n\nI stopped taking the lane through Forest Hills while I await the outcome of my appeal next week. But I may reconsider. Two close passes yesterday.

It's really no way to live. Unrelated to being miserable but related to unsafe drivers, I had a front row seat to a car/car collision at 5th and Shady while waiting at the light. The sound of two cars hitting one another is entirely unnatural and unpleasant. It managed to shake me up a bit thinking about how exposed I am on two wheels. I'm finding that the more I ride my bike, the easier I take it when driving.\n\nandyc\n\nandyc - was that Monday night? I saw the aftermath, although I was on my scooter instead of my bicycle. IIRC some SUV was all jacked up and up on the sidewalk in front of the apartment building. That was immediately after I nearly got left hooked by someone turning left on Walnut - luckily they stopped and I didn't have to complete my panic braking exercise. The front light on my scooter is larger and brighter than pretty much any bicycle light. This morning on Wilkins someone in a volvo SUV did a similar thing to me as what alanowski described, although they realized they weren't going to make it and hit the brakes. We ended up side by side at the light at Wilkins & Shady, but I held my tongue for once and didn't even look in that direction. I also ended up right behind them at Beechwood & 5th, despite the fact they were easily doing 40 down the hill... but stupidity persists.\n\nsalty\n\nYes. Monday night - SUV vs car.\n\nandyc\n\nI’m finding that the more I ride my bike, the easier I take it when driving. So true. My car driving keeps getting closer and closer to my bicycle riding. I think it would be useful if motorists convicted of one or another traffic infraction were sentenced to riding a bike for the next n months. I can't think of a better way to refocus one's driving habits.\n\nahlir\n\nAh, imagine being forced to ride a bike. How awesome would that be?

Half a block later, he pulled into a parking space at some food place, so I pulled up behind him and an overweight, balding white guy with hair pulled back in a ponytail got out. I held up four fingers, and said \"4 feet please\" rather forcefully. He launched into an explanation of how that rule didn't apply if I wasn't riding on the far right of the road where I was supposed to be, so it was really my fault and that -I- needed to be more careful and to obey the law. Let's just say the interaction went poorly. I got pictures of the car and plate, and have seen him in the same spot multiple times a week, around 5:30p-6:00p on weekdays.

You have all the info you need.\n\njonawebb\n\n@reddan, Oh, I totally agree. I have had these conversations with people many times. Drivers(and bikers at times) generally break laws because they think they are doing so within reason. For instance, 2 Ft rather than 4 is viewed as acceptable. 35 MPH instead of 25 MPH is viewed as acceptable. A rolling stop is viewed as acceptable. No turn signal... ok we get it. I just think it is amazing that people acknowledge the 4 Ft Passing Law, which is relatively new, and yet claim that there are exceptions to the rule.\n\nmjacobpgh\n\njonawebb wrote:@mk71, why not file a police report?

I sent the video, but they said they could not do anything because I did not call right when it happened. http://youtu.be/OkktDXv7pGw\n\najbooth\n\nSince the nature of the evidence is video, and you're the only one to corroborate anyway, what the hell difference does it make whether you did it right then and there or later in the same day? It's not like other crimes, quite without video evidence, can't be reported after the fact. Lame, lame stinking excuse.\n\nbyogman\n\nI hear you Ben...especially since Mt Lebanon was willing to prosecute based on \"information received.\" I copied Stephen Patchan on my exchange with the Pittsburgh Police, and intend to follow up with him today.\n\najbooth\n\nWill they do anything without any information on who the driver was? I wasn't able to get the Monroeville cops to do anything more than promise to call the owner. But they said they wouldn't send a ticket without an id of the driver.\n\njonawebb\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but if a stationary radar detector records your speed and snaps your license plate, the ticket is sent in the mail to the person who registered the vehicle. Likewise for toll violators at unmanned stations whose license plates get snapped. It's just the right default assumption. If it's wrong, someone can contest in court. Anyways, I don't see why it shouldn't work that way if a few decision makers decide that the 4 foot law actually ought to be enforced on par with other traffic violations (admittedly, quite a low bar there, but still, would represent a big improvement).\n\nbyogman\n\nI never called 911 when I went after the guy harassing me. I just collected evidence and showed up to file a police report. That line smells bogus to me.\n\npinky\n\nFunny how they can ticket a car when it's parked in the wrong place despite the driver not being there.\n\nrsprake\n\nYesterday, Penn @ Main.

Is this a 4 foot violation? http://youtu.be/H6AGHjEorY8\n\nrustyred\n\nIf you freeze the video at 11 seconds you can see that you are in the middle of the lane and the truck has its wheels at least a foot or more in YOUR lane. I'm not sure how wide that lane is, but I'd guess he is clearly closer than 4 feet. The second car looks close too, but without lane markings its hard to tell because of lens distortion.\n\nmarko82\n\nI'd say that lane is 9-10 feet wide. (Interstates are normally 12, and the minimum seems to be 9.) It looks to me like you're a bit to the right of the center of the lane, though after he passes you move left a bit. (Look at the tire impressions in the road, which are offset perhaps a foot or two toward the right side of the lane. You start off right between them, but by the time the truck passes you're almost over the left-side one, and roughly in the middle of the lane.) My best guess is the truck is right at 4 feet. It's too close to call. But unless he was going at a \"careful and prudent reduced speed\" (and how ofter do passing cars do that?) he's still in violation of the 4 foot law.\n\nsteven\n\nYour arm is probably about 2 - 2.5 feet long (full arm span is typically height, and your torso is something like a foot wide). So if you could reach out and touch the vehicle is is DEFINITELY in your space -- it should be close to twice that distance away.\n\nneilmd\n\nI just moved to Lawrenceville and commute via Butler/Penn to get to downtown. Penn in the Strip has two lanes with the one on the right having a sharrow. At least 3 times a day I get passed closely by cars/trucks within the sharrow lane when there is an entire separate lane of traffic for them to go into(often without other cars). I gesture for them to do that, but it probably doesn't achieve anything. I'm new to this route so I'm not sure if there's a better way that I could go and avoid these interactions(even though I am biking in a perfectly law abiding fashion). I used to have a Contour to document this but it broke and they went out of business and I can't afford a camera at the moment.\n\nmjacobpgh\n\nif you're not taking the lane. try positioning yourself smack dab in the center or slightly to the left. if you are already taking the lane and are just sick of the crap try this (except just ride next to the tracks until Railroad starts where google sends you up to Smallman): http://goo.gl/maps/PlWkX\n\ncburch\n\nif you are already taking the lane and are just sick of the crap try this (except just ride next to the tracks until Railroad starts where google sends you up to Smallman): http://goo.gl/maps/PlWkX Just a minor note: the trail along the river from the convention center to 25th street is closed until February for some sewer work. I ride the opposite direction in the morning, as my office is at 25th and Railroad. Yes, I would call what the white truck did a violation. Let's say that lane is 10 feet wide. Your bike is probably 30-32\" across at the handlebars. If you were perfectly centered, then you are 44\" from the edge of the lane. So as soon as the edge of the car touches the line, he's too close.\n\najbooth\n\ncburch wrote:if you’re not taking the lane. try positioning yourself smack dab in the center or slightly to the left. if you are already taking the lane and are just sick of the crap try this (except just ride next to the tracks until Railroad starts where google sends you up to Smallman): http://goo.gl/maps/PlWkX\n\nYea, I am already taking the lane and cars pass me half in the lane and half in the other when, of course, the entire other lane is available.

Then run back roads for the most part. That pass wouldn't bother me much. I might not love it, but it was really close to okay.

If you ride along the curb, cars think they can pass you without changing lanes, so they do. And you get close calls for the entire ride. If you ride confidently in the center of the lane, be predictable, and be visible, cars will change lanes the vast majority of the time, without incident. I'd rather have one or two drivers per week buzz me closer than I'd like than have dozens of drivers try to squeeze past me in the same lane.\n\najbooth\n\ngg wrote:\n\nIf you aren’t comfortable with that, I think you might want to take a different route.

And as far as 'taking the lane' goes, on my very first day riding in traffic I had a \"OMG, cars are scary, I need to stay as far to the right as possible to stay away from them\" attitude. Bad Idea. A car came within a foot of me on a pass. This might have stopped me from ever riding on a road again... holy crap, that was scary. I'll take a hundred questionable/borderline passes that make me uncomfortable over one of those passes that make me almost crap my pants. I've only had questionable passes ever since I took the 'take the lane' advice.\n\nrustyred\n\nIf I use the line to my left as zero, and the line to my right as 100, I position myself at about 35 to 50 on a multi-lane road, maybe 55 to 70 on a one-lane-each-direction road. Definitely not ever > 75, unless I get off the road altogether and stop.\n\nstuinmccandless\n\najbooth wrote:Might be the worst possible advice.\n\nNo the worst advice is not having a mirror to see a pickup like that coming from behind, so you can adjust yourself to about the 60 mark, using Stu's example and moving back to about 70. That way that pickup wouldn't have been close at all. I do it ALL the time and it works great. I also am able to prevent motorists to buzz me and if they are going to do it anyway, I always have room to move over because I never ride as far right as I can. I think I will take my approach, thanks, but without a mirror you can't do what I do. Also, I have many years of practice and that isn't something you can learn overnight. Good luck trying to muscle up to vehicles. I find that is a good way to get hit by one.\n\ngg\n\nYou're so macho hcurtis.

Using Stu's example, you seem to be advocating riding somewhere between 60 and 70. I advocate riding with my wheels on 50. That is not \"trying to muscle up to vehicles\" but rather is being predictable and visible. My experience with moving from the right edge of the roadway to the center of the lane is that doing so causes significantly less close call passes. And frankly, the ones who do it now in an attempt to be intimidating would do it no matter where you are in the lane. By the way, your \"advice\" of moving to the 60 mark when you see someone in the mirror, then back to 70 when they pass, would actually have you moving closer to the passing vehicle. Ya' know, \"trying to muscle up.\"\n\najbooth\n\nI'm totally down with taking the lane. It's scary at first, but once you get used to it you'll find that motorists just behave a lot better. You get a few jerks who honk, but since they'll be behind you, unable to pass, they're much less of a threat than they would be making a close pass. And I ride in the middle or to the left of the middle, making it clear what I'm doing. Heavy traffic, approaching red lights, and multi-lane roads where the left lane may be occupied by someone turning left are all spots where it's important to take the lane. That said, I also look for opportunities to let motorists pass safely. If I'm in an area where there are wide lanes, I'll ride to the right, and the same applies when I see there's no oncoming traffic so the motorist can easily pass safely. In my experience, when I've been taking the lane, say at a stop light, and I move back to the right to create space to pass, motorists respond well, and give me a lot of space when they do pass.\n\njonawebb\n\nI find taking the lane to be the safest place to be. I take the lane almost everywhere. If I can move over to let a person or two pass, I will. That being said, most of my commute does not allow for such a gesture. I do not use a mirror. I find the best way to know what is going on around me is to keep my head on a swivel and eyes peeled. I did the same thing when I rode a motorcycle. I almost never used my mirrors. They seem to distort images, make things look better or worse than they are and give one a false sense of safety. IMO. Got buzzed yesterday and today by a PAT bus, same driver coming up Penn avenue toward Main.... and I mean BUZZED. He pulled into the turn lane with a foot or two and straight cut me off to get into the straight lane and let people on and off at that stop by the gas station. So, to keep him from doing it again, I got in front of him this time at the light and took the lane all the way to Friendship. This is what I call 'saving my own life'.\n\nfaunaviolet\n\ni ride that stretch of penn from about 29th to downtown a few times a week, and, yes, taking the lane is the only way to go. for one reason or other, this stretch of road is kind of awful for drivers not fully changing lanes, though. part of it is probably because of the left-side parking—in some places the left hand lane is considerably narrower than the right hand lane, and people seem quite averse to going all the way over. in those sections, i take the lane, but ride slightly right of center (and adjust based on right-side parking and strip district shoppers jumping out at me).\n\nhiddenvariable\n\najbooth wrote:By the way, your “advice” of moving to the 60 mark when you see someone in the mirror, then back to 70 when they pass, would actually have you moving closer to the passing vehicle.

All this is done when the vehicle is behind me by some distance. I call it \"flashing\" myself to the vehicle. Fully clothed of course. I also spit in their direction prior to them getting there, to let them know what they may be in for if they want to buzz me. Yep, there is a lot going on to never to be buzzed and I haven't been for months. Probably been buzzed once or twice in the past year of commuting. As I said, I am happy with my method and I don't feel the need to be predictable to motorist well behind me. I want them to be on their toes back there, not thinking oh this guy is riding straight, so I can come close to him. Nah, I will go with looking as though I am missing some glass on the road now and again, because I might want to as I am being passed. Whatever though. I spun my wheels long enough on this thread.

Taking the lane (and riding in the middle of lane is not exactly taking the lane -- in 12 foot lane it just making car drivers aware that they have to cross a line to pass me).
