        "text": "For related races, see 2024 United States House of Representatives elections.\n\nThe 2024 United States House of Representatives elections in New York will be held on November 5, 2024, to elect the 26 U.S. representatives from the State of New York, one from each of the state's 26 congressional districts. The elections will coincide with the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the House of Representatives, elections to the United States Senate, and various state and local elections. The primary elections were held on June 25, 2024.\n\n2024 United States House of Representatives elections in New York\n\n← 2022 November 5, 2024 2026 →\n\nAll 26 New York seats to the United States House of Representatives\n\nParty Democratic Republican Last election 15 11 Current seats 16 10\n\nResults by congressional district\n\n2020–2024 redistricting process\n\nedit\n\nFollowing the 2020 census, New York lost one congressional seat and its Independent Redistricting Commission (I.R.C.) attempted to draw a new map. However, they could not reach an agreement on the map, and the Democratic-dominated New York State Legislature drew their own new Congressional map. In April 2022, in the lead-up to the 2022 midterms, the New York State Court of Appeals struck down the map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that failed to follow the proper procedures.[1] The Court then appointed an Independent Special Master to create a new map.\n\nIn the 2022 House election in New York, under the new map, the Republican Party flipped 3 seats, bringing the new seat count of 15 for the Democrats and 11 held by Republicans.[2] In March 2023, New York Democrats challenged the new map, deeming it incorrect for the Court to draw the map, claiming that the job lies solely with the Legislature and I.R.C.[3] In July 2023, an intermediate appeals court ruled that the I.R.C. must create another new map for the 2024 House Elections.[4] The New York State Republicans challenged the ruling to the Court of Appeals, who ruled on December 12, 2023, that the maps must be redrawn by the legislature and I.R.C. for the 2024 elections.[5][6] On February 27, 2024, the New York State Legislature voted to reject the bipartisan map and instead favored redrawing the map for Democrats. On February 28, 2024, the state legislature passed a new map resulting in the 3rd, 18th, and 22nd congressional districts becoming more Democratic while the 1st becoming more Republican.[7] The map was signed by Governor Kathy Hochul on the same day.\n\nDistrict 1\n\nedit\n\n2024 New York's 1st congressional district election\n\n← 2022\n\n2026 →\n\nNominee Nick LaLota John Avlon Party Republican Democratic Alliance Conservative Common Sense\n\nIncumbent U.S. Representative\n\nNick LaLota\n\nRepublican\n\nThe 1st district is based on the eastern end and North Shore of Long Island, including the Hamptons, the North Fork, Riverhead, Port Jefferson, Smithtown, and Huntington, all in Suffolk County.[8] The incumbent is Republican Nick LaLota, who was elected with 55.51% of the vote in 2022.[9] George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in December 2023, announced a Republican primary challenge to LaLota in this seat, announcing his run as a Republican during Joe Biden's 2024 State of the Union Address.[10] On March 22, 2024, Santos announced that he was withdrawing from the Republican primary and would instead run as an Independent candidate.[11] On April 23, 2024, Santos withdrew from the race entirely.[12]\n\nRepublican primary\n\nedit\n\nNominee\n\nedit\n\nNick LaLota, incumbent U.S. Representative[13]\n\nWithdrawn\n\nedit\n\nGeorge Santos, former U.S. Representative from the 3rd district (2023) (ran as an independent)[10][11]\n\nEndorsements\n\nedit\n\nNick LaLota\n\nU.S. executive branch officials\n\nDonald J.
