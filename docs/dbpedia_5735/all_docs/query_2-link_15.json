        "text": "For The Bacon Brothers, music is all about exploration.\n\nThe siblings have spent the better part of three decades creating their own mix of folk, rock, soul, and country music. They call that diverse sound \"forosoco,\" and it's taken them around the world, from headlining gigs in Japan to American performances at iconic venues like Carnegie Hall, the Grand Ole Opry and Gruene Hall.\n\nThe exploration continues with the band's twelfth release,Â Ballad Of The BrothersÂ . It's a record that highlights not only the similarities between Kevin Bacon (known worldwide as an A-list Hollywood actor) and Michael Bacon (celebrated as an Emmy-winning composer), but the differences, too. The two siblings may be bound together by blood and a mutual love of American roots music, but they've grown into sharp songwriters and cinematic storytellers with their own distinct approaches.Â Ballad Of The BrothersÂ makes room for both of those approaches, offering a mix of edgy alt-rock (\"Take Off This Tattoo\"), Motown-inspired soul (\"Put Your Hand Up\"), fingerpicked folk (\"Let That Be Enough\"), and everything in between.\n\nWeâve been doing this for several decades if you go back to when we first had instruments in our hands. We were raised in a family that appreciated everything that was artistic. I was in a band with our sister when I was in high school. We were given art lessons and dance lessons and acting lessons. Thatâs just the kind of family we grew up in. It was just a natural thing for Kevin and I to do things together. I discovered early on that he had a natural gift for sharing sentiments that were personal to him, but in fact universal as far as most people were concerned. Thatâs really the essence of what our band has been all about and itâs been immensely satisfying to us.\n\nâ Michael Bacon\n\nOn July 18, 2020, the brothers released their tenth record entitled The Way We Love, which contains a series of songs that explore those intimate relationships with the people and ideals that become a source of both purpose and passion. The album contains ten tracks, seven of which were produced byÂ Michael & Kevin, two by Philadelphia producer/engineer Joe Nicolo, one produced by Saverio Principini. Two of the exceptional offerings were recorded live at Sony Hall in New York City. Itâs also one of their most emotionally charged collections to date, and one of their most dynamic and diverse as well."
