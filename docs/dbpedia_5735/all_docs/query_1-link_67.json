        "text": "Late last week, sources said although approximately 10 Minneapolis agencies received and responded to the preliminary questionnaire issued just before the end of the year, finalists were having second thoughts about participating in the review following ‘first look’ meetings. Many of the agencies were concerned that the account could end up being too labor-intensive for the money.\n\nThe finalists, all Minneapolis, are Carmichael Lynch, Kruskopf Olson, Peterson Pearson Milla, and the Edison Group/FAME divisions of Martin/Williams, Inc., according to a SuperValu spokesperson.\n\nThe review marks the division’s first relationship with an agency. Advertising for the division had been handled in part through the home office in Eden Prairie, Minn., and partially in-house at the Minneapolis division. Sources say the division, which until now advertised primarily in newspapers, is interested in changing its marketing focus to include in-store promotions, radio and print advertising.\n\nThe Minneapolis division represents 160 stores under three store names – SuperValu Shields, County Market and Newmarket. The company operates grocery stores in about a dozen states and owns a number of subsidiaries including Cub Foods, Stillwater, Minn.\n\nAgencies are scheduled to make formal presentations during the week of January 18 with a decision expected by the end of the month, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nCopyright Adweek L.P.
