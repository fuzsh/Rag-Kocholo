        "text": "The internet has become a new source for religious advice and a new channel for communication about Shariah-based normative guidelines. Opinions and judgments concerning a variety of religious topics are stored in this medium, provided by both religious scholars and laymen. This creates new spaces of religious contestation offering a wide public the possibility to challenge traditional religious authorities. The aim of this paper is to examine the processes of renegotiating Shariah-based normative guidelines in cyberspace by using a case study approach. Via search engines a random sample of websites were drawn where women’s ʿawra (parts that are not to be exposed) are (re)defined and discussed. The paper is divided into four parts: After an introduction about various forms of religious normative guidelines in cyberspace and a discussion of the medium’s impact on authorities, we show in part two that the term ʿawra and its impact on female behavior is disputed since early Islam. Since definitions of the term ʿawra are based not only on Qur’anic verses but also on examples of women’s behavior in early Islam transmitted in historiography and hadith, there are always processes of selection and hierarchisation involved. In part three, we outline these processes by looking at online-fatwas from independent ʿulamaʾ and from official state appointed muftis, furthermore at discussions about women’s ʿawra in forums and blogs. The examples show how religious scholars and laymen construct gender roles by relating in diverging ways to traditional concepts of legal teaching. Processes of (re)negotiations take place especially in informal websites where people criticize the iftāʾ of religious scholars and challenge their authority.\n\nBlack-box web vulnerability scanners are a popular choice for finding security vulnerabilities in web applications in an automated fashion. These tools operate in a point-and-shootmanner, testing any web application-- regardless of the server-side language--for common security vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, black-box tools suffer from a number of limitations, particularly when interacting with complex applications that have multiple actions that can change the application&#39;s state. If a vulnerability analysis tool does not take into account changes in the web application&#39;s state, it might overlook vulnerabilities or completely miss entire portions of the web application. We propose a novel way of inferring the web application&#39;s internal state machine from the outside--that is, by navigating through the web application, observing differences in output, and incrementally producing a model representing the web application&#39;s state. We utilize the inferred state machine t...\n\nThe study has to do with the explorations of a way to use the internet services to provide a platform for the use of individuals, groups of people and companies to interact with one another through the social media.

Abstract-The study has to do with the explorations of a way to use the internet services to provide a platform for the use of individuals, groups of people and companies to interact with one another through the social media. The social media has really assisted interaction and even bringing together business tycoons and their services together through social networking, forums, blogs, etc. Forums are now being used at length as tools/platforms to create avenues for discussions connecting people mostly of related interests and as bases of significant information. This study made use of the precise decisions about their excellent choice of career, and choice of environment, etc. Based on an in-depth review of some relevant literature, some important requirements were considered in the development of a suitable web application. Therefore we developed an online forum for students to interact and out ostensive care for one another in their needs and solve most if not all their pending and epoch problems as well as solve their choice of career problems, and the right choice of career study, with the availability of relevant information about an institution, etc. Our developed networking system is called \"ff followme.\" The networking as the pilot scheme was developed, tested, and launched at Obong University for students and staff to be engaged in social networking. The programme was fascinating, and a total of 300 students in various departments networked finding the package cost-effective with less manning."
