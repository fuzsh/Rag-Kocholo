By structured we mean the traditional mass communication media of broadcast television and radio and the cable networks. These services have long sent prepackaged programs to viewers and listeners in linear series organized by time and day. We focus on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS, and include CW, MyNetworkTV, Telemundo, TeleFutura and Univision and affiliated stations, the major cable networks, such as CNN, MTV, TNT, USA, HBO and so on, the satellite TV and telephone TV services, such as DirecTV and AT&T, and the radio and audio networks. Although these channels’ programs can be recorded and replayed, on a structured service, each program was originally selected to fit in a single channel to create an image and set of expectations about that channel. Of considerable importance is the fact that many programs get replayed on co-owned channels or are later sold in syndication. Of even more importance is that this structured industry is moving toward on-demand programming, thus becoming more like the unstructured industry. By unstructured we mean the parts of the huge online world that carry old and new television programs and radio shows, talk and music that come via the web to your laptop or tablet or cell phone— or perhaps your TV set. While we focus primarily on the unstructured services that provide television programs and movies, such as Netflix, Google and Hulu.com, we include the personal media of YouTube, Facebook and MySpace, as well as online\n\ngaming such as Farmville, Carville and Cityville, plus X-Box, Nintendo and their kin. We incorporate these in the unstructured group because they consist of giant masses of content from which users select however they prefer. Online media is inherently VOD (video on demand). Nonetheless, much of the online world is filled with non-programming and falls outside the purview of this book. But we do refer to blogs and podcasts, insofar as they are carriers of content that relates to the structured and unstructured programming media. The primary reason for including both structured media content and rivaling unstructured content is that they share an economic and marketing universe. They compete for the attention of the same viewers, listeners and users, and they compete for the same dollars, although the revenue streams operate in different ways. And they are coming closer together. Indeed, over the next decades, broadcasting and cable will fade as broadband distribution rises, but for now, all must coexist and share the audience’s attention. Change continues to be the media’s most enduring characteristic, and the contents of this book have most value when they not only describe and interpret the present but also predict the patterns of the future. The next media revolution is well begun, and the once-rigid barriers between methods of delivering programming are dissolving, as are barriers between domestic and foreign programming. The authors make educated assessments of likely changes in the near future, while science fiction imaginings ix\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nedge closer and closer. 3D television without glasses is certainly coming but hasn’t reached most living rooms yet.\n\n■\n\nNew media only partly subsume old media. Television has gone from black-and-white to color to digital to HD and is going to 3D (although most screens lag behind and don’t display HD signals, let alone 3D), while television is simultaneously going online. And only about three quarters of U.S. household have broadband access, not all of that high speed. LP records quite thoroughly replaced 78 RPM, but then CDs replaced records, and now online downloads to iPods and cell phones are replacing CDs. Radio has in part gone from analog to digital and from broadcast to satellite and to online, but HD radio has not yet been widely adopted in home, although it has become standard for new cars. In each big change, the strength and speed of the takeover has varied and in many cases, the old medium persists alongside the new.\n\n■\n\nAnalog is dead, and digital is becoming HD. The makers and distributors of media content now largely ignore the millions of analog receivers in homes (and cars) and presume they will inevitably join the digital age. Although cable, satellite and telephone distributors offer hundreds of channels as digital signals, the media companies expect to drop most plain digital in favor of high definition in the not-distant future. Households today may contain a mix of analog and digital media, but over-the-air television and radio consumers are getting left behind. While only about a third of digital subscribers now take high-definition service, the industry expects full conversion in a few years. While only half of households have highspeed internet access now, more than 90 percent will have it in a few years. Although the digital gap is shrinking, it persists between older and younger people and urban and rural households, despite sporadic regulatory efforts.\n\n■\n\nReducing, reusing and recycling are now the driving strategies behind programming decisions. While the traditional networks broadcast the classically defined the main program genres, new types of programs are emerging in spite of old terminology. Game shows and reality programs have merged and exploded across television.\n\nThe Changes Six major shifts in the industry guided the revision for this edition. They can be summarized as conclusions or operating principles: ■\n\n■\n\nMultiplatform strategies inform media decisions today. The conventional TV networks reacted to the newest media by trying limited multiplatform marketing, but changing economics and audience behaviors now make cable and the internet parallel to broadcasting, and if not yet equivalent, they are the future in programming and profits. Where once the broadcast networks viewed cable and the internet merely as vehicles for marketing their content, broadband and cable are now either full partners or full competitors to the broadcast media. Now every kind of receiver (computers, phones, tablets and TV sets) must be considered in every decision to buy, make or schedule programming. Cross-media have become enmeshed media. Diverse media outlets have been assimilated within giant media corporations. Broadcast network and stations, cable networks and systems and online video services now operate within single commercial conglomerates. This has led to conflicting goals within corporations in which programming decisions sometimes advantage some owned segments and disadvantage others to maximize overall profits. The full ramifications of Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal, for example, will not emerge for a decade. While crossfertilization and reuse of broadcast programs on both cable and online is old news, the three kinds of media are now more deeply embedded—to the point where some distinctions have been erased. Television companies no longer act without full consideration of online impacts. And now radio is becoming audio and no longer separate from online, iPods or the telephone.\n\nPreface\n\nMeanwhile, YouTube mushrooms with new program ideas, and Facebook illustrates the audience’s need for interaction. While program types are expanding, schedules everywhere fill with reused tried-and-true favorites. Because the networks strive to reduce the total number of expensive programs they need to fill their schedules, an essential part of current strategy has become replaying of episodes more often and recycling shows on co-owned cable channels and online. ■\n\nWirelessness and pay are the directions of the future. Although the traditional wired media of cable, satellite and telephone remain strong media businesses for now, wireless ways to receive television and audio are becoming commonplace. It is likely that virtually all entertainment media will become wireless (perhaps delivered via light rather than in the presently used parts of the spectrum!) and almost all media will require some sort of pay in your lifetime.\n\nChapter Organization The organization of this edition of Media Programming has been altered to catch up with changes in ownership patterns and technology distribution, as well as to give greater prominence to the unstructured media because of their current interest to readers. ■\n\nPart One introduces the strategies and principles guiding the structured and unstructured media and tells what programmers need to know.\n\n■\n\nPart Two looks at programming from the perspectives of prime-time broadcast—the gorilla on the block—as well as multichannel cable/satellite and online networks.\n\n■\n\nPart Three builds understanding of the processes and problems of ratings and syndication, and if you don’t understand them, you don’t understand anything.\n\n■\n\nPart Four focuses on the practices of specific kinds of programming situations.\n\n■\n\nxi\n\nPart Five addresses the rapidly morphing audio media of music and information.\n\nAlthough so much is changing right under our noses, this book largely preserves the classic media subdivisions as a convenience for chapters and because the process of amalgamation and reemergence remains ongoing … ongoing. Someday, as in science fiction, all kinds of media will merge into mega-conglomerate media businesses serving all the different kinds of receivers. TV sets, laptops, tablets and smart phones—and who knows what—will be just different sizes and shapes of wireless computers. But we aren’t there yet, not by a long shot. Two indexes appear at the book’s end, along with a brief bibliography and a long list of internet media sites. The authors also maintain a website at www.media-programming.com where updates and links are posted. The site can also be searched from www.wadsworth.com. Also at the book’s close you’ll find brief bios of the editors and authors. The word television now encompasses much more than it did a handful of years ago. The impacts of digitalization, internet penetration and media consolidation continue to work their ways into viewers’ homes and will remain the dominant forces operating to change programming strategies and practices in the coming decade. At the same time, the slow growth in the number of U.S. viewers and listeners is giving greater emphasis to serving the fast-growing Hispanic and Latino audiences and greater importance to providing programming for other countries. Concurrently, competition from foreign-made programs is attracting more U.S. viewers while rising local media industries in other countries are creating stiffer competition abroad for U.S. media companies. These will continue to be major pulls and pressures on overall programming strategy for the coming decade.\n\nOur Thanks and Appreciation We celebrate and appreciate our contributing authors and thank them warmly: William J.

I’m watching a movie on my iPod.” Or maybe it was an iPhone. Or an iPad. Americans use electronic screens of one sort or another for an average of at least eight hours a day. This book focuses on decisions affecting the content of those screens. The chapters look at the strategies of all kinds of television (broadcast, cable, online) and audio (radio, satellite, internet), as well as the daily practices of the electronic media industry. Although new technologies often capture our immediate attention, in the media world “content is king,” and we’ll show you why. This chapter introduces the kind of programming specific to the electronic media—not what computer programmers normally do—and outlines the complex media industry.\n\nWhat Is Programming? Programming can refer to an outcome or a process. It can describe either a group of programs on a radio station, a television network, or cell phone, as in “I really enjoy the programming on that new cable channel”—or the act of choosing and scheduling programs on a broadcast TV station, subscription channel, or online service, as in “My job is programming; I pick most of the shows my channel carries.” Like the programmer who handles many cable channels, the online programmer also has the job of choosing but for a video library rather than a single channel. The processes of selecting, scheduling, promoting and evaluating programs define the work of a programmer, and they are the subject of this book, whether the programmer is a paid employee or you, the viewer! The word programs refers to units of content—some as short as tweets and YouTube videos, others as long as TV series and Hollywood movies. As you choose which online sources to watch, load up your iPod, or subscribe to Netflix or Spotify, you are programming for yourself, but someone else placed that content where you could get at it. At a radio station or small cable channel, the person paid to handle the programming tasks\n\nmight be called a program director or general manager (or “hey, you”); at a television station or network, the decisions are made the very highest corporate levels (the people called “sir”) because so many tens of thousands of dollars, even millions, are involved in each decision. Regardless of the person’s position title, the job will be to choose content that targets the desired audience, design a schedule, make sure the content is effectively marketed, and monitor the outcome—a job description that applies to both the established media and the newest media. Of course, it’s highly likely that being talented at the job leads to more successes. If a channel has weakly pulling shows, it needs new programming, in the most tangible sense, because owners usually seek large audiences for their advertisers. Always remember: The main function of commercial media is to deliver an audience to advertisers. Even Facebook and YouTube are supported by advertising. The new shows a programmer chooses must appeal to more viewers (or listeners in the case of radio, users in the case of the web) than did the old shows. Somebody organizes the hour to hour display of new videos on YouTube, just as somebody chooses the hourly sequence of television channels. But day to day, once the big decisions are instituted and the shows running, evaluation of some kind of audience ratings takes the front seat for programmers.\n\nThe Big Changes The media world doesn’t hold still, which keeps it interesting. In case you failed to notice, three changes in society and the industry have dramatically affected programming and continue to do so: digitization, internet access and media competition.\n\nDigital Media Digitization has displaced analog television broadcasting and changed the equipment that consumers use to receive television. Anything can be a “television” now, or so it seems. Box 1.1 asks whether you are really at the cutting edge. Digitizing television\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n1.1\n\nA\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n5\n\nAre You Really Watching HDTV? lot of people think they are watching HD when they’re not. It takes three things to have an HD picture:\n\n1. A digital HD screen for your TV or computer set, duh. 2. A program shot by an HD camera: Older cameras were not in HD format, and even today, many local events, including regional sports, are commonly produced using older non-HD cameras—even if the screen looks like the right spread-out aspect ratio. So if you watch a lot of old movies, you probably aren’t getting them in real HD, even if they’ve been remastered. 3. A contract for HD service from your local cable, phone or satellite service. If you aren’t paying for HD service,\n\ngave rise to DVRs (digital video recorders), which in turn enormously increased time-shifting of traditional television programs, as described in 1.2. Having people watch a show on different days at different times and via different media has had a powerful and often confusing impact on ratings and program scheduling. Consumers’ desire for time-shifting led to such innovations as on-demand television, which in turn changed the meaning of a TV channel. Video-on-demand (VOD) is more like a library than a set of channels. Moreover, viewers now want HD (high definition) or even 3D reception on large screens in their homes as well as public places, leading to new production criteria for programs and much affecting what Hollywood does. Nonetheless, nearly 8 percent in the United States, mostly in big cities where signals are strong, still get along without cable or satellite television (or the telcos’ UVerse or FiOS) in their homes. (They have to go to bars to get the good stuff!) And only newer cars have HD radio. Smart phones and tablets now show some TV shows and other kinds of programming, another byproduct of digitization of television and the telephone. At the same time, smart TV sets let users switch between television and the internet. The new media only partly replace the old media, but they have generated new ways for audiences to use media.\n\nyou’re getting only a digital signal but not an HD signal. You have to pay extra for HD. Look at detail in the close-ups: Can you see the whiskers grow? Look for detail in the distant background: Can you see the faces and clothes of individual fans at a game? Look for figure/ground separation: Do the foreground figures stand well apart from the background? Get used to real HD because 3D is coming! And holography of some sort after that.\n\nInternet Access That the internet has given rise to enormous changes almost goes without saying. Although everyday use of the internet has been widespread for more than two decades, it has become faster (although not fast enough for most people), wireless, and easier to use (except for the 25 percent of Americans still lacking high-speed internet access in their homes). For media programmers, the internet provides four things: ■\n\nreplay of major movies and network television series and specials;\n\n■\n\noriginal programs made for the web by amateurs or professionals (user-generated content and web series);\n\n■\n\nwebsites that carry updates and background about television stars, program plots, and schedules (enhancements); and\n\n■\n\na gazillion places for program promotion and advertising.\n\nBoth program promotion and program replay matter: They influence the all-important ratings. Internet usage measures provide another kind of “rating.” As the whole world seems to know, the spread of the internet via wireless signals led to social media\n\n6\n\nPART ONE\n\n1.2\n\nD\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\nThe DVR Factor\n\nigital video recorders (DVRs) change viewing habits. Those who own them grow very fond of (and dependent upon) them. Those who have original or updated TiVos are often fiercely loyal to them—more so even than the owners of unbranded models from cable and satellite operators. Those who do not own them cannot understand all the fuss. They’ll find out, eventually. Some forecasters predict that DVRs will be in 80 percent of television homes by about 2015. To the uninitiated, DVRs appear to be glorified VCRs or recording DVDs, with video stored on a random-access hard drive. But DVRs can pause and instantly replay live TV, allowing more viewer control. DVRs play back while recording, allowing the viewer to time-shift more easily than ever before. The internal menu systems driven by daily downloaded program information make recording so very easy. DVRs beat VCRs hands down: no codes, no stop-start times, no clocks to set; just choose a program from the menu of upcoming options (or during a live promo or during the actual show) and hit record. Record a show once or every time it is shown, regardless of what time or day. There is no need to know what night a show is on because the DVR does all the thinking. It even can be told to ignore any show reruns during daily or weekly recordings. Viewers simply visit their DVR program menu and find what they want, when they want it. Dayparts are irrelevant. Channels are irrelevant. And commercials are meant to be skipped.\n\ncommunication. Once upon at time, AT&T and other phone companies were the social media. You called people on the telephone. Facebook, Twitter and the like have taken over as the vital parts of interpersonal communication, affecting daily personal life and even underpinning national uprisings in the Middle East and elsewhere. But time spent on social media takes away from time for consuming traditional broadcast and cable programs. Competition with the internet for precious audience time has forced drastic changes in television programming. For example, competition drove the\n\nEven more important to conventional viewing patterns is that DVRs usually come bundled alongside enormous packages of digital services, including VOD. Because the TV services commonly have informational bands that appear for a few seconds across the bottom of screens, they do two things: Besides distracting the viewer from immediate involvement in the upcoming program, they certainly make using the up/down channel changing buttons (old-style surfing) quite unappealing. Digital cable rapidly becomes menu-driven television, not channel-driven. Satellite services also come bundled with DVRs to make pay-per-view possible, and cable operators supply DVRs to digital, HD and 3D subscribers for a fee, with the goal of encouraging pay-per-view sales. Indeed, manufacturers of television receivers promise to build the DVR functions into the sets themselves. Many viewers don’t want an additional box connected to their TV sets. So what happens to programming strategies? Are the traditional practices of hammocking, tentpoling, bridging and leading-in (see Chapter 2) relevant in a DVR-enabled home? Some say not, but some say not so fast. Will the added expense keep most people away or will bundling of services make the price for adding a DVR insignificant? Guide listings are not universally popular. DVRs vastly improve them. How will widespread use of DVRs become? One for every TV in the house? A few viewers may remain content with the way things were before DVRs, but not many. Stay tuned in the coming years and find out.\n\nexplosion of such cheap-to-produce quasi-reality shows as Survivor and American Idol; it upped the number of reruns during prime time; and it changed audience measurement practices. To compete, the internet found success with elaborate online games such as Farmville, a guzzler of user time. (Have you tried puppy watching? It’s another time devourer.) Competition for audiences has motivated the adoption of “green” strategies (of a sort) for the big as well as small television corporations: Programs must now be reduced, reused and recycled (and whatever other R-words you can think of) more than ever before.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nMedia Competition Finally, Comcast bought NBC Universal (creating NBCUniversal, for some odd reason). This giant step reflected consolidation not just within an industry segment but across competitive boundaries. And it was a “buy up” rather than lateral or down: A cable operator bought a major broadcast network, along with its ownership in a dozen cable networks. A newcomer bought an old-old-timer. Since the 1980s, broadcasting and cable have been primary rivals, battling head to head for viewers, but it normally takes a large group of cable networks to match the ratings of a single broadcast network in prime time. So for several reasons, this merger shocked many industry insiders. Cross-media has now become enmeshed media. The number of cable networks exceeds 500, though many are co-owned by other networks or very small splinter services. The top 25 get by far the most viewing and have the most subscribers. No one can say how many program services there are online, but about a half-dozen are best known for providing web series, while YouTube, iTunes and their cohort supply virtually infinite and changing quantities of videos. In contrast, the number of broadcast networks seems to have stabilized at ten (or nine depending on who you count): The Big Four of ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC; plus CW, MyNetworkTV and PBS; plus Univision, Telemundo and TeleFutura, the three Spanish-language networks. (PBS often gets left out, leaving nine commercial networks.) But, around the edges, Google seeks to make YouTube into a broadcast network, and Netflix would like to join this exclusive group, so the number of networks could change. One significant point is the growth in audiences for Spanish-language networks: Univision is the fifth largest network, far bigger than CW or MNTV or any single cable network. A major point is that Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric, as well as AT&T’s, Google’s and Netflix’s aspirations, signal a major shift in the relationships among the controlling media entities, and these moves are the likely forerunners of more consolidation. And new relationships between the social media and the commercial media are in the wind.\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n7\n\nOwnership powerfully affects programming. In addition to political slant, such as with Fox cable and MSNBC, the financial clout of an owner and the size of its total audience influence the purchase price of programs: Money matters. And the number of co-owned outlets directly affects a program’s distribution: Audience size matters. The larger the financial risk, the more conservative big owners become. Consolidation leads to more reduce, reuse and recycle rather than to innovation.\n\nThe Themes The pressures arising from these three big changes are themes throughout this book. All chapters in this book examine how programs (units of content) are selected (or not selected), how content is arranged in schedules or menus of various kinds (or all over some screen), how the content is promoted to audiences or users and advertisers, and how content and audiences are evaluated (at least by the industry, even if that’s not how you see things). We are especially concerned with the limits arising from technology, financing, regulations, policies and marketing needs, and you should be too. ■\n\nOne central premise is that how content is paid for determines much of its structure and availability, and the long-term trend is to pay for use (whether you like it or not).\n\n■\n\nAnother thrust is how the mass orientation and traditionally rigidly linear structuring of the broadcast media is adapting to emergence of personal and mobile media. (How much difference do you see?)\n\n■\n\nWe focus on the methods and processes of consumption of digital video and audio media, which are dissolving fixed ideas about “channels” and “dayparts.”\n\n■\n\nStill other recurring themes arise from the ways the once-clear distinctions between networks, syndicators and cable companies are fading, and while some former competitors are becoming enmeshed through partnerships and mergers, certain pressures keep other competitors well apart.\n\n8\n\nPART ONE\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\n■\n\nAnother recurring topic is how programmers struggle frantically on a daily basis for bigger shares of the overall American audience and specific sub-audiences.\n\n■\n\nWe are always concerned with how the big media conglomerates are co-opting and commercializing online, mobile, social and noncommercial program content.\n\n■\n\nAt the same time, the persistent patterns of daily work and living continue to influence the availability and arrangement of most media entertainment content (and you don’t even notice).\n\n■\n\nFinally, the realities of economics always overshadow all aspects of media programming.\n\nLook for examples of how these themes emerge in the following chapters about specific media situations.\n\nThe Process of Programming Programming is both a skill and an art. The primary goal in programming advertiser-supported media is to maximize the size of an audience targeted by advertisers. The only way to accomplish this goal is to satisfy the needs and wants of that audience, whatever they are today and tomorrow and tomorrow. Present-day technology permits viewers themselves to choose programs from dozens of sources (such as broadcast stations, cable/satellite channels, SiriusXM, Netflix, YouTube), giving consumers more-or-less instant access to hundreds—even thousands—of programs. But oddly enough, most people prefer to let someone else do the programming chore. Viewers tend to choose channels and websites, but expect someone else to have filled those channels/sites in an expert way. Even YouTube viewers may choose a topic or known video to start with, but then they typically click on whatever follows (despite the commercials). In the case of mass-appeal channels, such as the major television networks and larger cable networks and internet services, programmers go after as many viewers as possible. Most advertisers assume that the demographic groups they want to reach will be well represented in the total audience, if it’s large.\n\nTo cover all bases, most big media companies have expanded their brands into groups of channels, such as the 5 channels of ESPN, the 11 channels of HBO/Cinemax HD, or the dozen or so channels owned all in or part by NBCUniversal and its owner Comcast. In the case of specialty cable and internet channels (called niche networks) such as the Military History Channel, Black Entertainment Television, Comedy Central and the Tennis Channel (or still smaller networks focusing on pets or cooking or cars or houses or shopping), the programmer may be more interested in pleasing a particular audience subgroup than in reaching an audience outside the targeted group. Of course, the larger the size of that target audience, the easier it is to make money. Very narrowly targeted channels cannot survive long, even on the internet, unless they carry advertising (but if audiences are small, few advertisers will buy) and/or charge subscription fees—if enough people are willing to pay to get the service. But audiences tend to expect most programs to come for free, so other means of generating money are essential. All programmers must deal with certain limitations, most of them economic. Program resources are scarce. Good shows cost a lot of money. Unfortunately, bad shows are also expensive (except on YouTube). Good or bad, the four largest broadcast networks combined (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC) spend more than $10 billion annually on programs and rights to major events. Their collective share of the total audience shrank for several years but has currently flattened at about one-third of viewers at any given time. Audiences are available to consume media for only so many hours per day, and less of that viewing went to the Big Four networks as cable networks and then games and social media captured more of the audience. At the same time, Univision’s TV audiences are swelling in size. In the case of television programming for which viewers pay a fee, there is a limit to how much they will spend before they start complaining to Congress about subscription fees. One byproduct of smaller network audiences in the United States has been greater efforts to market U.S. program content in other countries. CNN is a worldwide service; Disney runs Spanish-language channels in South America and other parts of the\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nworld. Although ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC are quintessentially American channels, and their U.S. popularity depends on them staying so, their parent corporations can be increasingly involved with cable and broadcast channels in other countries. Just as U.S. car makers pushed for years to get into the gigantic Chinese car market, media program producers yearn to follow in their footsteps. The following figure (see 1.3) illustrates the notalways-happy relationship between U.S. television viewers and television program services as a tug of war. The cartoon suggests that as audiences adopt new technologies, programmers must respond with new strategies for enticing and holding those audiences. Similarly, changing economic, regulatory, and social conditions usually result in acrimonious tensions between the sources of programs and their viewers, listeners and users.\n\nHow Programming Is Unique If Irving Berlin was correct when he wrote that there’s no business like show business, then what makes a programming product unique? How are programs different from other products that corporations make for the public? Certainly, ease of delivery is key for broadcasting. What other product can be simultaneously delivered to nearly every consumer? Who else can attract the biggest audiences? The very biggest sports and entertainment events still go to the broadcast networks, for now. In theory, anyone can conceive an idea and sell it to a cable channel or a broadcast network or put it online, but the big distributors (cable and broadcast networks through their systems and stations) continue to exert a large measure of control over which programs run. Barriers to entry still limit budding suppliers. Nonetheless, it is possible for some programmers to start small and build national audiences. Oprah Winfrey started at a small station doing a local talk show before achieving national television prominence and creating her own production company and then more recently her own cable television channel (see 8.9 for more on Oprah). Facebook was only begun in 2004 and now reaches more than\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n9\n\nthree quarters of U.S. homes and represents maybe (at least at unsettled times) half of all internet use worldwide. Beginning with a website is the likely path for many future entrepreneurs. Reaching a national audience is becoming less difficult. Internet cafes and Wi-Fi are proliferating, and a growing number of program suppliers are looking for nontraditional program providers. Netflix, Hulu and other online video rentals and sales services offer another potential avenue for program suppliers, and the internet’s ability to stream audio and video programming—looking and sounding both the same and different from traditional programs—improves continuously. On the other hand, to remain competitive, the broadcasters have long been first adopters of content production for new screen technologies—first color, then HD, and now 3D programs. Broadcast programming remains unique because there is no apparent direct cost to consumers for the most popular shows. Although cable and online programmers siphon away some desirable programs, the big broadcast networks are able to provide very popular drama, reality and comedy programs, along with top sporting events and live news coverage, seemingly absolutely free to the audience. Despite all the new media, television remains the most used medium (close to 6 hours daily), and advertisers know it. They pay for the programs in exchange for having their commercials presented to the audience. Although the high cost of advertising is passed along to consumers, the advertiser’s ability to market products to huge audiences actually decreases the per-item cost of many products because of economies of scale. It usually costs more for producers to market products to a small number of people. Why should radio or television programmers care how “free” the programs are to the receivers? In the case of broadcast programming, the low cost to viewers generates audiences large enough to sell to advertisers. Contrary to popular belief, broadcasters are not in the business of creating programs; they are in the business of creating audiences that advertisers want to reach. Even in the case of cable/satellite channels and online sites, advertiser support is critical\n\n10\n\nPART ONE\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\nTug of War\n\n1.3\n\nNews Corp\n\nAudience\n\nIndustry\n\nFox\n\nViacom\n\nGoogle\n\nPreference/Needs CBS\n\nTwitter\n\nAT&T ABC\n\nDisney\n\nProgram strategies Facebook\n\nDVR Viewing Verizon NBC\n\nPromotional strategies\n\nWeb\n\nComcast\n\nAdvertisers Pay Cable PBS\n\nYouTube\n\nCable TV\n\nAvailability\n\nUnivision Basic Cable\n\nTime Warner\n\nApple\n\nGamers\n\nReprinted by permission of Milton Hamburger.\n\nto programmers because costs are seldom borne entirely by subscriber or user fees. Programming is a unique product in that it is used to lure the attention of consumers so that advertisers can show those consumers commercial messages that help sell other products. Programmers work only indirectly for the audience; the primary customer is the advertiser, without whom there would be few programs to see or hear. Prime-time television might look like YouTube.\n\nWhat Does the Audience Want? The most important part of programming is understanding the audience. What appeals to viewers or listeners or online users? Quite simply, on the surface audiences want to be entertained, and they want to be informed. Speaking very generally, these two elements comprise the whole of programming content (see 1.4 and 1.5). But the devil is in the details, of course.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n1.4\n\nA\n\n11\n\nRecipe for Successful Production\n\nstep-by-step procedure for the process of programming would go something like this. First, choose programs that seem to meet the needs and wants of an audience. Second, organize those programs into a coherent schedule that flows from one program into the next. Third, market the programs to the appropriate audience. Finally, evaluate the results and make necessary adjustments. This is the basic recipe for cooking the perfect program schedule. 1. Target a demographically desirable audience. 2. Choose appropriate programs for that audience.\n\n1.5\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n3. Evaluate reasonable costs for program types and time slots. 4. Evaluate the competition to determine a scheduling strategy. 5. Make sure a program fits in with neighboring programs. 6. Employ talented performers whom the public likes. 7. Hire producers/directors/writers with a record of success. 8. Deal with currently popular subject matter. 9. Emulate comparable high-rated programs.\n\nWhat Is Quality?\n\nW\n\nhenever the word quality is attached to programming, viewers think they know what that means. Do they? Quality often connotes strong production values (lavish sets, famous performers, riveting scriptwriting, technical achievement) and critical acclaim. Those who fight to save quality programs often see some substantial social value in such shows. So why is quality lacking in most television shows? Is it money, or could it be that the masses want circuses instead of high culture? Perhaps quality signifies only that a group\n\nThe demand for entertainment encompasses a mixture of comedy and drama. Narrative stories represent the norm, and these stories have a beginning, a middle and an end occurring within each episode.1 Characters have goals resulting from a desire. Along the way, they encounter some form of conflict. In a comedy program, the conflict is a humorous situation resolved in a way that causes the audience to laugh. Sitcoms usually appear in half-hour episodes. In a drama, the conflict results from a counterforce, often “the bad guys.” Most dramas last an hour, occasionally longer. Nonnarrative reality programs are more like situation\n\nof viewers finds some subjective value that is independent of objective criteria. If we cannot agree on what constitutes quality, does it really exist? Maybe those who use the phrase “quality television” really mean to say “programs that we really like.” Programmers are well advised to be careful with the word quality as long as so little consensus exists about what it is. It might be better to strive toward shows that are popular (or critically acclaimed) by external standards, rather than programs that have intrinsic quality.\n\ncomedies with game show elements: they consist of a situation in which “people” compete to win. But the most successful of these shows also embody a narrative about participants carried over from week to week. By the turn of this century, the former reality format (Survivor and Fear Factor) had resurfaced on a wave of game shows (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?), which was soon overtaken by other types of blockbuster reality programs (Dancing with the Stars and American Idol) and two hit game shows (Deal or No Deal and Jeopardy). Many of these reality shows are competitions that generate a sense of\n\n12\n\nPART ONE\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\nurgency, like sporting events do, making them seem more important to watch than dramas or comedies. Comedies, which had real staying power for decades, were consistently taking a beating in the ratings in the first decades of the 2000s, leading some critics to wonder whether viewers find serial dramas and series reality shows especially addicting. By mid-decade, the biggest draws were Fox’s American Idol and such crime shows as NCIS: Los Angeles, CSI and The Mentalist. As has always been the case, however, such sporting events as the NFL games swamp all other shows in audience size. Comedies and dramas are composed of various ingredients that appeal to most audiences: engaging dialogue, attractive characters, romantic themes, nostalgia, suspense and high emotion, to name a few. The audiences for all entertainment genres are also interested in seeing or hearing something novel, even if it is an old idea with a new twist (see 1.6). Reality shows, on the other hand, create a “human spectacle” that is every bit as scripted, primarily through postproduction editing, as programs with a preproduction script.\n\n1.6\n\nInformation programming is also driven by novelty and entertainment value. Viewers want fresh stories that promise something new. Critics can complain about the trivialization of information, but network and syndicated news and information programming with an entertainment approach (infotainment) attracts big audiences. Consider, for example, the long-time success of 60 Minutes, 20/20 and The Today Show. These programs mix popular topics with more serious information. In their newscasts, local stations also necessarily pay close attention to the lighter side of community events, partly because there are fewer opportunities for hard news than on the national level and partly because “positive” stories appeal strongly to viewers. The trend has reached the point that younger audiences get much of their news from shows that actually mock the news, such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Looking at the types of programs demanded by audiences is one way to learn what people want, although it is not a perfect method. Some people say they want just comedy, for example, but some sitcoms have “serious” episodes that address social\n\nUncovering the Mystery\n\nM\n\nerely asking television audiences what they want is difficult. Many times viewers do not know what they want until they see it, and a short while later they tire of it and crave something new. Programmers must become accustomed to dealing with fickle audiences. The only refuge is to uncover the mystery of how the audience makes choices about what to watch. The process whereby audience members make choices is seldom clear, but researchers use three basic approaches to predict those choices. One way looks at the uses and gratifications of media consumption. This approach frequently substitutes the self-reported attitudes of viewers for more concrete information on their actual behaviors. A second way uses additional predictors of choice, such as market size, program length, awareness, cable/DVD/satellite penetration, and audience availability. Research findings in this area are equally unsatisfying or unusable\n\nbecause really strong predictors, such as when the audience is available, are not usually controlled by the programmers (or the viewers). The most promising way to predict choice seems to be to study the actual content of programs, but the industry has sponsored very little generalizable research. What element in a television or radio program is most important? Some say it is the likeability of the main characters. Others point to the compelling nature of the story or the format. Little research has been done in this area, perhaps because using structural predictors is easier than using content variables. In any case, studying programming as a serious topic is not easy. The networks and other program suppliers focus on the ratings and on testing ideas and pilots (see Chapter 2), but programming seems to remain one big gamble where instinct is more important than science.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nissues, while some dramas venture into comedy. Adding to the general misinformation about programming is the fact that viewers and listeners believe they are programming experts merely because they watch or listen. Most people who tune to a broadcast program feel that they could do a better job of choosing the shows and selecting the time slots. If that were really true, of course, there would be no need for a book on how to be a programmer. Programming skills can be learned, but the art is a bit more difficult than it seems to many people.\n\nThe Lure of Lore Everyone watches television, so nearly everyone professes to understand what programs ought to be like. Yet merely having preferences does not qualify a viewer—or a programmer—to make accurate decisions or judgments about program strategy. Because television viewing is so easy, the audience feels confident that putting shows on is really simple: Just make good programs and schedule them when they do not conflict with other good shows! Never make any bad shows. What could be easier? Because it’s too hard to explain, the professionals who work at the major broadcast and cable networks, along with their counterparts at the individual stations in each city, sometimes take a similarly simplistic stand. Always do this. Never do that. Give the people what they want (see 1.7). Or as Dick Block of the National Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE) preached, “Find out what works, what doesn’t work.” Out of this no-brainer philosophy has grown a garden of “rules” that the wisdom of experience has nurtured. Call it folklore or just lore; many programmers believe that achieving success in television programming is a matter of avoiding common mistakes. Unfortunately, programming is much more complicated. But it is useful to examine some of the lore that has grown up around programming. Certainly some of it may be good advice. Like most lore, however, the student of programming should be suspicious of universal truths.\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n13\n\nFirst, there is the matter of dead genres. A genre is a type of program, such as a western or a sitcom. At various times in the history of programming, common wisdom has declared each genre dead. Family sitcoms were dead in 1982, they said—until Cosby went on the air. Game shows were dead, they said—until Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? came along. Reality shows such as America’s Funniest Home Videos were very popular in the early 1990s, and then they were dead—until they came back a decade later in the form of Survivor. Second, program lore holds that there is a formula approach to building a successful show. For example, take a grizzled veteran in an action profession and pair that character with a young person to create dual appeal—something for both older and younger viewers. Or hire a big-name star from the world of movies, music or sports. The problem with such recipes is that they lead to bland television. Moreover, fans can name plenty of programs fitting these formulas that got quickly canceled—far more than shows that lasted on network television. Third, program lore preaches that certain formats always fail. Anything with chimps. Science-\n\n1.7\n\nT\n\nA Programming Myth\n\nhe late Sydney W. Head was a frequent contributor to earlier editions of this textbook, and he had this to say about programming:\n\nA popular fallacy holds that innumerable workable new program ideas and countless usable new scripts by embryonic writers await discovery and that only the perversity or shortsightedness of program executives keeps this treasure trove of new material off the air. But television executives hesitate to risk huge production costs on untried talents and untested ideas. Even when willing, the results rarely differ much because mass entertainment remains the goal. A national talent pool, even in a country the size of the United States (and even for superficial, imitative programming), is not infinitely large. It takes a certain unusual gift to create programs capable of holding the attention of millions of people hour by hour, day by day, week after week. Sydney W. Head\n\n14\n\nPART ONE\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\nfiction drama has never spawned a major network hit, not even Star Trek (although X-Files came close). Never bank on satire. The list goes on… The internet has become the home for thousands of experiments in program content—most of these amateur, short-lived and attracting few repeat viewers in many cases, but attracting millions to the big successes. A few commercial websites, such as those produced by Comedy Central and some other professional producers, generate huge audiences for a time, but not for the many daily hours that characterize conventional television viewing. So far, only a handful of experimental online programs have given rise to new types of television programs for large audiences, but more may lie ahead. The same problems face radio broadcasters who want to compete with the big guys. This chapter—indeed, the rest of this book— outlines what practitioners and scholars generally agree are the real fundamentals of programming. These are the building blocks that programmers construct with, whatever the medium, and they go well beyond the lore described above. It takes a gift to create programs capable of holding the attention of millions of people hour by hour, day by day, week after week. Competence in the field comes from understanding the sources of programs, the factors impacting audience size, and the influences of technology, economics, ownership and regulation on programming strategies and practices. Beyond them lies artistry—or magic.\n\nStructural Considerations Programming can be seen as largely a matter of choosing materials and building a schedule. These two processes—followed by promotion and evaluation—are the essence of what a programmer does on a day-to-day basis. Choosing programs depends on circumstances that are closely linked to the source of the programming, and depends even more on predicting what ratings each show will achieve. Similarly, scheduling is greatly influenced by whether the type of channel that will carry it is broadcast, cable, cell, tablet or online.\n\nSources of Programs Four basic program sources exist for television and radio: Network programs, syndicated programs, local programs and online programs. These compartments, however, are by no means watertight. Produced shows sometimes develop into hybrid blends of local production and syndication, with an online counterpart. Network entertainment programs “go into syndication” to cable channels or broadcast stations after their initial plays on the national network; then they may be stockpiled online for On Demand replay and aired on tablets. Networks also produce special short segments of programs suited to tablets or smart phone reception.\n\nNetwork Programs The national, full-service, interconnected network is broadcasting’s way of pooling resources to generate information programming. Newspapers shared news and features by means of news agencies and syndicates long before broadcasting began, but broadcasting introduced the elements of instantaneous national distribution and simultaneous programming. There are nine national commercial television networks: ABC, CBS, CW, FOX, MyNetworkTV (MNTV), NBC, and the three commercial Spanish-language networks (Telemundo—TEL, TeleFutura—TFA, and Univision—UNI), plus one public noncommercial television network (PBS). These ten supply broadcast programs by making or purchasing them. Aside from news, talk and news-related publicaffairs materials which they produce themselves, the six English-language broadcast networks buy most of their programs from the big Hollywood studios (all but one of which are owned by the parent corporation of one of the broadcast networks). Occasionally they buy from the very few remaining independent production firms. The tortuous route from program idea to finished, on-the-air network series is variously described in Chapters 2 and 7. Network programmers for public broadcasting face still another situation. Originally designed as an alternative to the commercial system, much PBS programming comes ready-made from the larger member stations specializing in production for the\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nnetwork and from small independent producers, but it still buys programs, notably the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which now has its own satellite channel carried on cable in the United States. While PBS selects, schedules and distributes its programming, no programs are produced by the network itself (although PBS now has its own satellite channels that compete with its affiliates, but it does not produce their content either). See Chapter 10 for more on public television’s processes. The Spanish-language networks draw much of their serial programming from Mexico’s Televisa, a producer of movies and telenovelas (popular soapopera-like serials with a definite ending after some months and usually with a moral or educational point). Some also comes from South America, particularly Brazil. Univision, the fifth-largest television network in the country, also produces several longrunning programs, including the blockbuster of blockbusters: Sabado Gigante. TeleFutura, owned by Univision, attracts the second-largest prime-time audiences among the Spanish-language services. Unlike Galavision, a competing cable network, all three broadcasters produce newscasts and carry live and taped sports, especially soccer and tennis matches originating outside the United States. About 200 cable program networks deliver the bulk of satellite and cable systems’ content. Cable networks (called subscription content networks in Chapter 9) differ in major respects from broadcast television networks. In technical delivery, they are similar: in both cases a central headquarters (the network) assembles programs and distributes them nationwide, using orbiting satellites to reach thousands of cable systems and some affiliated stations (CNN Headline News, for example, goes straight to some stations). But the financial and working relationships between broadcasting affiliates and their networks and between cable affiliates and their networks differ fundamentally. In addition to retransmitting broadcast stations, local cable systems supply hundreds of channels of satellite-distributed programming and must deal with hundreds of networks. The traditionally symbiotic relationship between each broadcast network and its 210 or so affiliated stations does not exist in the cable field. Most\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n15\n\nprogrammers who work for cable networks also have far less input into the creative aspects of programming than do their broadcast counterparts. The great bulk of cable network programming comes from the same sources as broadcast programming—distributors of feature films and syndicated programs—and, indeed, much of cable content has been old network programming, although this is rapidly changing as cable networks spend more for recent off-network hits and greatly increase their own production enterprises. Each cable network seeks for a single signature program that captures attention and gives definition to the whole network. At the same time, the multiplication of digital splinter channels (such as Encore Action, Encore Drama, Encore Love, etc., called virtual channels) has greatly increased the difficulty of the programmer’s task of attracting a large audience for any one channel. The internet has more varied program sources, drawing on both conventional television and radio content as well as on original commercial and amateur sources. The main sources for web series are Hulu.com, blip.tv and revver.com, although YouTube. com shows some web series, too. These series may have short or relatively long lives, but only a very few ever appear on over-the-air or cable television. The traditional radio networks once offered by ABC, CBS and NBC no longer qualify as full-service networks. Those that have not been sold now resemble syndicators, supplying features and program inserts such as newscasts. Conversely, some radio program syndicators supply stations via satellite with complete schedules of ready-to-air music in various established formats, much like the TV networks supply schedules of programs, except that the stations now pay the radio networks for the content. Formerly, the radio networks paid the stations to air the commercials (called compensation), but that system is disintegrating.\n\nSyndicated Programs Local broadcast programmers come into their own when they select syndicated programs for their individual stations. They draw upon the following sources:\n\n16\n\n■\n\nPART ONE\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\nOff-network series. Programs that have reverted to their copyright owners after the network that first aired them has used up its contractual number of plays (increasingly, the networks demand a share of ownership rights in many of their shows). These programs used to go directly to stations, but nowadays such cable networks as TNT, USA and A&E gobble up many of the best off-network dramas while TBS and the newer broadcast networks—CW and MNTV—take many of the popular sitcoms to rerun.\n\n■\n\nFirst-run syndicated series and specials. Programs packaged independently by producers and marketed directly to individual stations rather than being first seen as network shows (for example, Entertainment Tonight, Oprah and Wheel of Fortune).\n\n■\n\nFeature films. Movies made originally for theatrical exhibition, although this category has diminished because so many movies go to such premium cable networks as HBO, Showtime and pay HD channels. See 1.8.\n\n1.8\n\nO\n\nMovies, Movies, Movies\n\nf all the program types, the feature film is the most in demand because of its popularity on so many different delivery systems. The term window—borrowed from the world of space flight where it refers to the limited time-space openings when conditions are just right for launching rockets—has been applied to the release sequence by which feature films reach their various markets. First, of course, comes the traditional window of theatrical release—films are either simultaneously released in several thousand theaters throughout the country or put out in stages of “limited release.” Next in the usual order of priority come releases through the windows of DVD and pay-per-view cable, then regular pay cable, then broadcast networks, and finally general broadcast and cable syndication. Prices for licenses (and rentals) decrease at each stage of release as products age and lose their timeliness. However, studios sporadically experiment with different release cycles for specialized movies to see what makes more profit.\n\nLocal Production Local programs are those shows produced “inhouse,” usually by professionals on broadcast stations (such as the local newscasts), but sometimes homemade by amateurs who find distribution on public access cable and online channels. Local newscasts play an important role in television and radio station strategies (but even newscasts, though locally produced, often contain a great deal of syndicated material as inserts). Aside from news, however, locally produced material plays only a minor role as a program source. It is true that all-news, all-talk, and all-sports radio stations depend almost entirely on local production, but those formats cost so much to run and have such a specialized appeal that they remain relatively few in number, exist only in the larger markets, and do not have television counterparts. Stations simply find syndicated material cheaper to obtain and easier to sell to advertisers. Localism is more worshipped than practiced.\n\nThe Uniqueness of Scheduling Of all the programmer’s basic skills, perhaps scheduling comes closest to qualifying as a unique radio and television specialty. Scheduling a station, cable system, or network is a singularly difficult process, and little that is comparable occurs online as yet. Even with hundreds of competing channels, the availability of the web, and the proliferation of remote controls and digital video recorders, the audience for one show normally influences adjacent programs. The influence can be to build up adjacent program audiences or to drag them down. Effective scheduling requires understanding one’s own and one’s competitors’ coverage patterns, market and audience demographics. Most broadcast stations in a market compete directly for viewers and advertising dollars, but some viewers are more desirable than others, and programmers at stations without a network affiliation or with only a poor affiliation are disadvantaged compared with those programmers who deliver the most popular network programs.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nCable system programmers have different problems. They have to weigh the claims of competing services for specific channel locations. Being repositioned (moved to a higher channel number) used to be a very contentious issue between stations and cable until the FCC mandated that broadcasters get the same digital and analog cable channel numbers that they used for their over-the-air channels. This FCC decision, combined with widespread adoption of digital cable, has pretty much made channel positions a nonissue. Nonetheless, if positions are vacant, cable operators prefer to give the choicest positions—the lowest in a group because they are easiest to remember—to the most popular (or most lucrative) services, whether they are broadcast or cable-only. Cable operators especially favor the cable channels owned all or in part by their parent corporations.\n\nThe Need for Promotion The broadcast and cable networks forgo billions of dollars in advertising revenue in order to promote their programs on their own air, interrupting programs with clusters of promos and cluttering the bottom of the screen with animated program reminders. Such on-air marketing is essential for interesting viewers in new programs and new episodes of continuing series, and for retaining audiences by making them feel satisfied with the program array. In addition, millions are spent on paid program advertising appearing in other media, and on marketing endeavors in cooperation with such retailers as Kmart or McDonald’s. Stations also cosponsor concerts and sporting events to attract audiences to local television and radio programs. At the same time, having a presence in the online world has become a necessity for all ten broadcast networks. First PBS and then the five biggest commercial networks—ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and UNI—developed huge multimedia sites on the web, and the major studios and most cable networks followed suit. Television and radio enthusiasts can now point-and-click their way through myriad home pages designed by the networks, their affiliates, the studios, the major cable channels, the\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n17\n\nprograms, the fan clubs and even the program stars themselves. Unlike most blog and podcast sites, these are sophisticated promotional sites created to capture attention, generate buzz and feed the fans’ yearning for closer contact with programs and their stars. Commercial interests sponsor most of these sites. Not to be outdone, this textbook itself has a section within www.wadsworth.com! Fred Silverman, a giant in network programming history, understood that how programs were promoted was as important as how they were scheduled. The allocation of immensely valuable airtime to program promotion each year on every network and station is clear evidence that the industry is convinced of the truism that the best program without promotion has no audience. If the audience doesn’t know what day, what time and what channel a program is on, the old viewers who miss the show will have a profound impact on the ratings; if new viewers don’t see many exciting promos that convince them to watch a network’s shows, their absence will certainly also have a profound impact on ratings. It is crucial to understand that just a ratings point or two stands between the number one and number three broadcast network in most years (and maybe just a point more to number four). Promotion on and off the air is vital to maintaining and increasing standing in that elite group. The same situation occurs among cable networks and at the local level. Cable networks vie to be among the top 10 (or top 25), but most differ by only fractions of a ratings point. The slight advantage given by effective promotion can be the difference between making that top list and falling to some lower grouping, and advertisers typically buy by grouping. Local stations often vary only minutely in popularity, too, and a great deal of promotion of a newscast or radio format can boost one station above its competitors. Promotion of online programs takes a different form nowadays. It largely consists of gaining favored placement in Google lists and other created listings of favorites or types of sites. Virtually all top placement is purchased on Google, at least under generic terms. This revenue contributes to a large\n\n18\n\nPART ONE\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\npart of a search engine’s income. Placement is no longer luck of the draw or someone’s idiosyncratic whim except perhaps on individuals’ sites. Networks, stations, systems and sites are also concerned with their overall images. Increasingly, fostering positive images around the world has value in building audiences for exported programs and associated products (this is called branding). Google and Apple have world recognition as brand names at least as widely known as those of Disney, CBS, Fox, NBC and the biggest movie studios, and they allot enormous budgets to increasing and maintaining those brand names. Promotion, then, is one path through the labyrinth leading to high visibility, high ratings and thus high revenue.\n\nThe Elements of Programming The various strategies for selecting, scheduling, promoting and evaluating programs are derived from a set of assumptions about audience behavior. These broad assumptions, which are here organized into five groups, become the basis for strategies capitalizing on them, even in the changing media environment: ■\n\nCompatibility\n\n■\n\nHabit formation\n\n■\n\nControl of audience flow\n\n■\n\nConservation of program resources\n\n■\n\nBreadth of appeal\n\nCompatibility Scheduling strategies take advantage of the fact that programs can be timed to coincide with what people do throughout the daily cycle of their lives. The continuously unfolding nature of radio and television allows programmers to schedule different kinds of program material, or similar program materials in different ways, into various dayparts. Programmers strive to make their programming compatible with the day’s round of what most people do—getting up in the morning and preparing for the day; driving to work; doing the morning household chores;\n\nbreaking for lunch; enjoying an afternoon lull; engaging with children after they return from school; accelerating the tempo of home activities as the day draws to a close; relaxing during early prime time; and indulging in the more exclusively adult interests of later prime time, the late fringe hours and the small hours of the morning. And, of course, compatibility calls for adapting to the changed activity schedules of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Programmers speak of these strategies in terms of dayparting—scheduling different types of programs to match parts of the day known by such terms as early fringe, prime time and in the case of radio, drivetime. Cable television’s approach to compatibility has historically differed from broadcasting’s approach. Each broadcast station or network has traditionally had only a single channel at its disposal (even if it shows up on two or three places in the electronic guide with different numbers). In consequence, broadcast programmers must plan compatibility strategies for what they judge to be the “typical” lifestyles of audiences. Most cable networks target more narrowly. Like the internet, an entire cable or satellite system accommodates so many channels that it can devote some to every type of audience at all hours, ignoring dayparts. They can cater to the night-shift worker with sports at 6 A.M., to the single-person household with movies at 6 P.M., to the teenager with round-the-clock videos—by using a different channel to serve each interest. The daily share of viewing of the Big Four broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) fell below the combined viewing of cable channels several years ago. Broadcasters’ economics—and thus clout— have diminished dramatically because in such large metropolitan areas as New York City cable/satellite penetration has reached 91 percent. Even so, many cable channels effectively shut down their program services during low-viewing dayparts (for example, 3 to 7 A.M.) and let infomercials reign. The owners find it hard to resist the guaranteed advertising income from programlength commercials at a time of day when the audience size is both too small to attract mainstream advertisers and not large enough to generate viewer\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\ncomplaints that the usual shows are missing. By contrast, internet use climbs when television is weakest.\n\nHabit Formation Compatibility strategies acquire even greater power because audience members form habits of listening and watching. Scheduling programs for strict predictability (along with promotional efforts to make people aware of both the service as a whole and of individual programs) establishes tuning habits that eventually become automatic. Indeed, in spite of having DVRs, some people will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid missing the next episode in a favorite series the moment it is aired. Programmers discovered the basic principle in the early days of radio when the Amos ‘n’ Andy habit became so strong that movie theaters in the 1930s shut down their pictures temporarily and hooked radios into their sound systems at 7:15 P.M. when Amos ‘n’ Andy came on. At about that time the fanatic loyalty of soap opera fans to their favorite series also became apparent, a loyalty still cultivated by today’s televised serial dramas. Ideally, habit formation calls for stripping programs—scheduling them Monday through Friday at the same time each day, just as evening news is stripped daily on network-affiliated stations. To strip original prime-time programs, however, would require building up a backlog of these expensive shows, which would tie up far too much capital. Moreover, networks want maximum latitude for strategic maneuvers in the all-important prime-time schedule. If a broadcast network stripped its three prime-time hours with the same six half-hour shows each night, it would be left with only six pawns to move around in the scheduling chess game instead of the two dozen or so pawns that the weekly scheduling of programs of varying lengths makes possible. When weekly prime-time network shows go into syndication, however, stations and cable networks schedule them daily in strips (one episode daily at the same time), a strategy requiring a large number of episodes. A prime-time series has to have been on a network for four years (with the prospect of one\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n19\n\nmore year) to accumulate enough episodes for a year’s stripping in syndication (including a substantial number of reruns). Because few weekly shows survive five years of prime-time competition, the industry periodically faces a nagging shortage of quality offnetwork programs suitable for syndication. Syndicated game shows, such as the long-running Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, fill the gap. Necessarily, cable networks also pick up shows that had short runs, but for lower licensing prices. Cable has adopted different patterns. Especially when just starting out, networks such as FX and Oxygen stripped sitcoms not only day to day but across most of each evening until their revenues permitted more variety in programs. Networks such as A&E, USA and TNT also strip expensive hit dramas that are freshly off-network in early evenings and prime time. No one knows whether audiences find themselves more comfortable with the structured, compatible, predictable scheduling of traditional television than with a multitude of digital programming choices. Researchers investigating channel repertoire have often observed that, when scores of options are available to listeners and viewers, most tune in to only eight or so of the possible sources. For example, for many years, when Nielsen Media Research surveyed homes with access to 200 or more television channels, it used to find consistently that viewers watched only about 15 of them for more than one hour per week. Which 15 varies by household, of course. (Nielsen no longer tries to measure repertoire because the definition of “channel” has become so slippery.) The increased variety of program choices made possible by digital cable/satellite television and DVRs seems to have weakened viewing habits. Only about half of viewers (mostly women) choose in advance the programs they watch. The other half plays with the remote control. Even so, some people may sometimes prefer to have only a limited number of choices. They find it confusing and wearying to sift through scores of options before settling on a program. We’ve all run across the complaint about having hundreds of channels and nothing to watch! Broadcast scheduling, as a consequence of compatibility\n\n20\n\nPART ONE\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\nstrategies and a tendency toward habit formation, preselects a varied sequence of listening and viewing experiences skillfully adapted to the desires and needs of a target audience. People can then choose an entire service—an overall entertainment pattern (or “sound” in the case of radio)—rather than individual programs. New technologies like DVRs have increased time shifting but are not likely to eliminate the average viewer’s need to form patterns of behavior. Most people are creatures of habit, and television viewing is an activity that begs for routines. Indeed, DVRs may actually enhance habit formation because they make it easier to catch all the episodes of a favorite show, thus strengthening a habit. Grazing via remote controls diminishes for those who make use of their DVRs: Viewers can watch live TV and fill in the gaps when “nothing good is on” with saved favorites.\n\nControl of Audience Flow The assumption that audiences welcome, or at least tolerate, preselection of their programs most of the time accounts for strategies arising from the notion of audience flow. Even in a multichannel environment with dozens of choices, the next program in a sequence can capture the attention of the viewers of the previous program. At scheduling breaks, when one program comes to an end and another begins, programmers visualize the audience as flowing from one program to the next in any of three possible directions: They try to maximize the number of audience members that flow through to the next program on their own channel and the number that flow in from rival channels or home video, at the same time minimizing the number that flow away to competing channels or activities. Many scheduling practices hinge on this concept. Audience flow considerations have traditionally dominated the strategies of the commercial broadcast and cable networks and affiliates (see 1.9). Blocking several similar comedies in adjacent time slots, for example, takes advantage of audience flow. By contrast, counterprogramming (scheduling programs with differing appeals against each other)\n\n1.9\n\nC\n\nTelevision Versus Books, Newspapers, and Movies\n\nontrolling audience flow becomes problematic because listeners and viewers have freedom of choice. Unlike a consumer faced with the limited decision of whether to buy a book, subscribe to a newspaper, or attend a movie, electronic media consumers can choose instantaneously and repeatedly by switching back and forth among programs at will. Hence, programmers cannot count on even the slight self-restraint that keeps a book buyer reading a book or a ticket buyer watching a movie so as not to waste the immediate investment. And, obviously, the polite social restraint that keeps a bored lecture audience seated does not inhibit radio and television audiences. Programmers have the job of holding the attention of a very tenuously committed audience. Its members take flight at the smallest provocation. Boredom or unintelligibility act like a sudden shot into a flock of birds.\n\nis crucial to the strategies of small-audience channels that seek to direct the flow away from competing channels to themselves. Fortunately for programmers, when watching television on large home screens, many audience members remain afflicted by tuning inertia. Although hundreds of options often exist in a cable, satellite, online, and tablet environment, people tend to leave the channel selector alone unless stimulated into action by some forceful reason for change. Many times, viewers are engaged in simultaneous activities that preclude a focused attention to what programs might be available on other channels. Moreover, programmers believe that children can be used as a kind of stalking horse: Adults will tend to leave the set tuned to whatever channel the children chose for an earlier program. The greater number of program options provided by cable/satellite/telco and online services and the convenience of remote controls and DVRs have certainly lessened—but not eliminated—the effect of tuning inertia. Researchers recognize several ways the audience uses the remote control keypad to\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nmanipulate programming: grazing, hunting up and down the channels until one’s attention is captured; flipping, changing back and forth between two channels; zapping, changing the channel to avoid a commercial interruption; and zipping, fast-forwarding a recording to avoid commercials or to reach a more interesting point. While grazing has fallen off, jumping between two programs (such as two games) and zipping through recorded commercials are commonplace. Moreover, the home playback unit has undermined Saturday evening ratings for both broadcast and cable programmers: Huge numbers of viewers regularly rent DVDs on Saturday nights from Netflix. Thus, tuning inertia continues as only a modest factor to consider in broadcast programming strategies. Program flow is nearly irrelevant for some formats such as all-news radio, all-weather cable channels, and specialized subscription channels, which actually invite audience flow in and out. Some formats aim not at keeping audiences continuously tuned in but at getting them to constantly return. As a widely used all-news radio slogan goes, “Give us 22 minutes, and we’ll give you the world.” One cable news service used to promote itself in variations of “All the news in 30 minutes.” The Weather Channel doesn’t expect even weather buffs to watch for hours, just to return periodically. In any case, the overall strategic lesson taught by the freedom-of-choice factor is that programs must always please, entertain and be easily understood. Much elitist criticism of program quality arises simply because of the democratic nature of the medium. Critics point out that programs must descend to the lowest common denominator of the audience they strive to attract. This fact need not mean the absence of program quality. After all, some programs aim at elite audiences among whom the lowest common denominator can be very high indeed.\n\nConservation of Program Resources Radio and television notoriously burn up program materials at a high rate. This is an inevitable consequence of the continuousness attribute. That fact makes program conservation an essential strategy. See 1.10.\n\n1.10\n\nA\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n21\n\nReruns\n\nnyone who doubts the difficulty of appealing to mass audiences need only consider the experience of the older media. Of 25,000 to 28,000 new books printed in any one year, only less than 1 percent sell 100,000 or more copies; of 12,000 or so records copyrighted, fewer than 200 music recordings go gold; of 200 feature film releases, only 5 percent gross the amount of money reckoned as the minimum for breaking even. And yet audiences for these media are small compared with the nightly prime-time television audience. Sometimes audience demands and conservation happily coincide, as when the appetite for a new hit song demands endless replays and innumerable arrangements. Eventually, however, obsolescence sets in, and the song becomes old hat. Radio and television are perhaps the most obvious examples of our throwaway society. Even the most massively popular and brilliantly successful program series eventually loses its freshness and goes into the limbo of the umpteenth rerun circuit.\n\nA high percentage of the programming on cable networks and online consists of repeats of the same items. The broadcast networks also schedule plenty of reruns and now reuse their shows—repurposing—on their other owned broadcast and cable networks and online, as well as reformatting them for cells and tablets. Material related to the popular programs shows up in magazine articles, blogs and talk shows. The internet has stimulated production of new programs and program types, but on the whole, online and cable heighten program scarcity rather than alleviating it. One further complicating factor, at least for hit series, is their easy availability on DVD. If someone really loves a show, they can buy a whole season or entire multiyear runs as a boxed set and need not search for it in reruns. Frugality must be practiced at every level and in every aspect of programming. Consider how often audiences see or hear “the best of so-and-so,” a compilation of bits and pieces from previous programs; flashback sequences within programs (especially in soap operas); news actualities broken into many segments and parceled out over a period of several hours\n\n22\n\nPART ONE\n\nIntroduction to Programming\n\nor days; the annual return of past years’ specialoccasion programs; sports shows patched together out of stock footage; the weather report broken down into separate little packets labeled marine forecasts, shuttle-city weather, long-term forecast, weather update, aviation weather and so on. The enormous increase in demand for program materials created by the growth of cable television and the internet would be impossible to satisfy were it not that the multichannel media lend themselves to repeating programs much more liberally than does single-channel broadcasting. A pay-cable channel operates full time by scheduling fewer than 50 or so programs a month—mostly movies—and runs each film four to six times. Furthermore, movies first scheduled one month turn up again in the following months in still more reruns, which pay-cable programmers euphemistically call encores. Even the basic cable channels rotate the showing of their movies and series, based on the idea that the audience at 8 P.M. will be different from the audience at 1 A.M. For example, A&E double-runs (plays the same episode of) many of its prime-time series, and the internet makes available archives of thousands (even millions) of old programs—all of which makes frugality in sharing and repeating programs even more crucial. Beginning in the mid-2000s, several of the broadcast television networks began offering regularly scheduled repeats as part of their prime-time lineups. Borrowing a strategy from cable, the broadcast networks recognized that viewers were accustomed to having multiple opportunities to see first-run shows within the same week. “This is inevitable,” said Preston Beckman, the executive vice president of FOX Entertainment. “No network can program 22 hours any more, or in our case 15 hours.”2 Not surprisingly, the networks chose low-viewing nights for the repeats, conserving the cost of filler programming. Programmers can also make creative use of lowquality shows. The SyFy Channel features packages of old monster and ghost movies, and SOAPnet replays old daytime soap operas for new generations of fans, just as Nickelodeon reruns old cartoons over and over. Another reuse strategy is evident in programs such as Soap Opera Digest.\n\nA major aspect of the programmer’s job consists of devising ingenious ways to get the maximum mileage out of each program item. One strategy is to develop formats that require as little new material as possible for the next episode or program in the series; another is to invent clever excuses for repeating old programs over and over; a third, the newest, is to adopt multiplatform strategies for each program as it is conceived. For the best programs, viewers seek more and more experience with each show, its characters, its plot twists, even merchandise. Programmers respond to the viewers’ desire for more interactions by using extensions that may include websites and blogs, podcasts and other feedback. Nowadays, extensions spin off all hit programs. They show up in magazine articles and books while spreading across television in the form of program guests, guest hosts, and guest contestants. In the view of a programmer, there’s no end to a good idea. Before it ever airs, programmers plan versions of a show for broadcast television, for payper-view, for various internet locations, for tablets, for cell phones, for magazines, and so on, although such multiplatform approaches are usually only implemented when a show actually becomes a hit. The losers—without dedicated cult followings—just fade away. The point is that any beginner can design a winning schedule for a single week on a single channel; a professional has to plan simultaneously for all media as well as for the attrition that inevitably sets in as weeks stretch into the indefinite future. See 1.11.\n\nBreadth of Appeal Stations and cable systems recoup their high capital investment and operating costs only by appealing to a wide range of audience interests. This statement might seem self-evident, yet for many years, some public broadcasters made a virtue out of ignoring “the numbers game,” leaving the race for ratings to commercial broadcasters. But this fundamentally unrealistic viewpoint has given way to the strategy of aiming for a high cumulative number of viewers rather than for high ratings for each individual program. This strategy coincides\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n1.11\n\nT\n\nA Scaffold for Programmers\n\n23\n\nRipple Effect TV©\n\nruly successful TV programs are so compelling that they draw an audience that is not content to merely watch.
