        "text": "Printing Apprentice\n\nWhen Franklin was 12 years old he went to work as an apprentice in the print shop of his brother James Franklin. Benjamin Franklin studied every night after work, reading the great classic authors and the writers of his own time. He especially enjoyed The Spectator, a British periodical that used wit and humor to give fictionalized accounts of society in London, England. Franklin would study one of the Spectator essays and rewrite it in his own words. He then compared his essay with the original to find his mistakes. In this way he developed an accomplished style of writing.\n\nFranklin soon became an expert printer, but he wasn’t happy in his brother’s shop. An apprentice made little money and was forced to sign a contract agreeing to stay on the job for a long period of time. Franklin’s apprenticeship was to last until he was 21 years old. In addition, his brother was impatient and easily angered. Franklin began to resent his situation and wanted to be on his own.\n\nIn 1721 James Franklin started a weekly newspaper called The New-England Courant. The next year Benjamin Franklin secretly wrote a series of humorous letters and sent them to the newspaper to be published. He signed them “Silence Dogood.” In these letters Franklin pokes fun at Harvard College boys, at silly girls, and at bad poets. The letters amused many people in Boston, and everyone wondered who the clever author was.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nBenjamin Franklin wanted his work to be published in The New-England Courant, but he was afraid that his brother wouldn’t allow it. He therefore created the character of Silence Dogood, the widow of a minister, to sign his work. To remain unknown, Franklin disguised his handwriting and slipped the Dogood essays under the door of the newspaper office.\n\nMeanwhile, James Franklin had angered city officials by printing articles of which they disapproved. They forbade him from publishing the newspaper without approval from the government. To get around that, he canceled his brother’s apprenticeship contract and used his name as the publisher. The two brothers then secretly signed another contract keeping Benjamin Franklin in an apprenticeship position.\n\nJames Franklin soon discovered the truth about the author of the “Dogood” papers. He was furious to have been tricked into printing letters by his 16-year-old brother. Quarrels between the two became violent. Benjamin Franklin took advantage of the canceled contract to leave. He knew that his brother might lose the newspaper if he revealed the secret apprenticeship agreement they had made. Later in life Benjamin Franklin admitted that leaving wasn’t fair, but he believed there was nothing else he could have done.\n\nPostmaster\n\nIn the 1700s postage stamps weren’t used on mail. Instead, people had to collect their mail at a specific inn or tavern and pay for it. As postmaster of Philadelphia, Franklin came up with an idea to stop losing money on unclaimed mail. He did this by printing in his paper the names of people who had mail awaiting them. He also developed a simple, accurate way of keeping accounts.\n\nIn 1753 Franklin became deputy postmaster general for all the colonies. At the time he took office, weeks were required for mail to travel by wagon from one part of the colonies to another. Postage fees were set by weight and distance, and clerks and customers frequently argued about the distance between towns. Franklin ended these arguments. He invented a machine that, attached near the wheels of a wagon, measured distance.\n\nFranklin visited establishments handling mail throughout the colonies. Understanding that communication and the sharing of information was crucial, he increased mail deliveries to every week. Franklin, more than any person before him, drew the colonies together. In four years he made the postal service pay. For the first time the British government made a profit on the system.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1774 British authorities fired Benjamin Franklin from his postmaster job. They questioned his loyalty because of his support for the colonies. The next year the Continental Congress established a postal system separate from British control and named Franklin postmaster general of the colonies.\n\nPennsylvania Assembly\n\nQuarrels between Great Britain and France led to the French and Indian War in America in the 1750s. Both countries were fighting for control of North America. French hunters, trappers, and soldiers moving down from Canada had built forts along the Ohio River and had made allies with Indigenous peoples. The British government also claimed that land.\n\nTo counter any aggression from the French and their allies, the Pennsylvania Assembly sent Franklin into the frontier to direct the building of forts and to raise troops. When British troops landed in Virginia in 1755, Franklin hired wagons for them to carry supplies.\n\nIn order to pay for these defensive measures, the Pennsylvania Assembly was using some of the colony’s tax money. All taxpayers in Pennsylvania were helping to pay for the expenses of the war. However, the owners of the largest tracts of land weren’t paying taxes. These were the sons of William Penn, founder of the colony. They lived in London and cared little about the fate of the colony as long as they received their rent money.\n\nIn 1757 the Pennsylvania Assembly sent Franklin to London to persuade the Penns to pay their share of war expenses. He helped put through a bill taxing the Penn family for its lands. Overall, however, Franklin was unsuccessful in his mission to get money from the Penns. He returned to Pennsylvania in 1762 to fulfill his duties as postmaster.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nWhile in England Franklin met many people who were important in science and politics. He received honors from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland in 1759 and from the University of Oxford in England in 1762.\n\nGreat Britain eventually defeated France in 1763 and the French and Indian War ended. However, Pennsylvania authorities remained displeased with the Penns. Many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly believed that the king rather than the Penns should govern the colony. They asked Franklin to go back to England late in 1764 and present their petition to King George III. A royal government was never established in Pennsylvania. Instead, tensions increased between the colonies and Great Britain. Franklin soon became involved in other political discussions.\n\nAmerican Revolution\n\nFor the next 10 years Franklin was the most important American representative in England. He was the spokesperson for several American colonies. Through talks and in pamphlets and newspaper articles, he tried to show that if the colonists were granted rights equal to those of the English, peace could be made. Many Englishmen in power, however, refused to listen to Franklin’s advice. Open rebellion broke out in America.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nBenjamin Franklin became famous in Europe as a wit and a champion of liberty as well as a scientist.\n\nFranklin returned to Philadelphia in 1775, arriving just after the Battles of Lexington and Concord had been fought in Massachusetts. The American Revolution had officially begun. Franklin’s wife had died in 1774. Although Franklin was nearly 70 years old, he plunged into the work of the Revolution.\n\nAlmost immediately Franklin was elected to the Second Continental Congress. In the autumn of 1775 Congress appointed Franklin one of three men to go to George Washington’s headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts. There they discussed the problems of the Continental Army. Franklin helped draft the Declaration of Independence and later the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States.\n\nIn 1776 Congress sent Franklin on his most important diplomatic mission. He was asked to persuade France to help America in its fight for independence. Franklin reached Paris in December.\n\nFranklin worked hard while in France. First he had to secure formal recognition of America. Then he had to persuade the French that an alliance would be helpful to them. He was successful, and the Franco-American Alliance, or Treaty of Alliance, was signed on February 6, 1778. With this treaty, France agreed to supply critically needed military aid and loans to the American colonies. People around the world hailed Franklin as the champion of liberty."
