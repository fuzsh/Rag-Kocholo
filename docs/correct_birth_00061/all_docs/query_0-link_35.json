        "text": "Boston - Day Tripper Guide\n\n# 080-Ben's Boston Neighborhood, Day Tripper Self-Guided Tour\n\n1.4 mile walk:\n\nLet me start Ben’s Boston story by sharing his family history. His father, Josiah, was born in the village of Ecton, Northamptonshire, England. He was the ninth child of blacksmith Thomas Franklin. In 1682, Josiah, his wife Anne, and Ben's older siblings arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Unfortunately, Anne passed away in 1689 while giving birth. Josiah then remarried a girl from Nantucket named Abiah Folger Franklin, who later gave birth to Ben.​anklin. Josiah, his wife Anne, and the older siblings of Ben arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1682. Anne died in 1689 during childbirth. Josiah remarried a Nantucket girl named Abiah Folger Franklin, who gave birth to Ben. ​\n\nParking - Faneuil Hall is most convenient parking area, a short walk from the starting point at the Waterfront and just a few blocks from the last stop at Hanover and Union, Josiah Franklin's Candle Shop location.\n\nPhilly Town 76 has partnered with Spot Hero a digital parking reservation service that will connect you to available parking lots in the recommended parking area.

Click on the Spot Hero Parking Icon, schedule the day and time of your Day Trip, make your choice and Book your parking.\n\n​\n\n​Ben’s Birthplace, 1 Milk Street, is the presumed spot where Ben’s house was actually located. There’s a plaque above the door. This location and the official birthplace, 17 Milk Street, are across from Old South Meeting House. The number 17 bears a bust and the words “Birthplace of Franklin.” Benjamin Franklin was born on January 17, 1706, and lived here for six years with his father, Josiah, his mother, Abiah, and his 16 siblings. Benjamin was the 15th and youngest son. He lived with his family until 1723. The family later moved to Hanover and Union streets, where Josiah's soap and candle shop was located. Both of these buildings were destroyed in the 1800’s.\n\nMake a left on Washington, then a right on Bromfield.\n\n“Josiah Franklin and Abiah his wife lie here interred. They lived lovingly together in wedlock fifty-five years. Without any estate, or any gainful employment, by constant labor and industry, with God's blessing, they maintained a large family comfortably, and brought up thirteen children and seven grandchildren reputably. From this instance reader, be encouraged to diligence in thy calling and distrust not Providence. He was a pious and prudent man; she, a discreet and virtuous woman. Their youngest son, in filial regard to their memory places this stone.”\n\nHead north on Tremont and right on School Street. .02 mile\n\n​Old Corner Bookstore is 400 feet away at the corner of School and Washington Streets. Young Franklin loved reading; he would borrow books from friends and save every penny to buy books. He read voraciously, trying to improve his writing style, grammar, and eloquence. Don’t be fooled by the Chipotle’s on the first floor. This building is one of the oldest brick structures in Boston. Although Ben was known to have a great appetite, I doubt he ate there when he was book shopping. However, when he was 16, he became a vegetarian, partly because he did not like to eat anything that was killed and partly because he wanted to save money to buy books. Only a small plaque on the side of the building confirms that a bookstore once operated here. Look up at the gambrel roof and look for the bands of bricks marking each floor, and you're seeing the same building Ben saw as he walked down the street eating a vegetarian taco in 1718. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Alfred Tennyson, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and many others gathered here to discuss their works\n\nHotels in Ben’s Boston neighborhood\n\nKimpton Nine Zero Hotel 90 Tremont St\n\nThe Godfrey Hotel 505 Washington St\n\nOmni Parker House 60 School St\n\nXV Beacon Hotel 15 Beacon St\n\nHyatt Centric Faneuil Hall 54-68 Devonshire St\n\nThe Bostonian Boston 26 North St\n\nHarborside Inn 185 State St\n\nRestaurants in Ben’s Boston neighborhood:\n\nThere’s a ton of good places to eat around there.
