        "meta_description": "Midwood’s One Milk redevelopment joins two historic buildings: the former headquarters of the Boston Evening Transcript newspaper, and the site of Benjamin Franklin’s birthplace. By constructing an interstitial building between the two properties, Midwood was able to rationalize the buildings’ floorplans and mitigate the variance between their floor-to-floor heights. Modern infrastructure and building systems as well as a dramatically restored façade have significantly improved the value of the property and its desirability for tenants; retail leased to Shake Shack and Greco enable Midwood to capture the heavy foot traffic in Boston’s Downtown Crossing.",
