        "text": "BEMIS — Bob Hughes has portrayed Benjamin Franklin for school classes and civic organizations for about 18 years.\n\nAs the Bemis Historical Society met June 19 at the Bemis Mill Village Museum in South Jackson, Hughes again mirrored the esteemed author, printer, scientist and inventor.\n\nHughes is a member of the James Madison Chapter of the Tennessee Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He serves as historian for the James Madison Chapter in Jackson.\n\nFor more information on the Bemis Historical Society or the Bemis Mill Village Museum, visit the organization's website at: www.bemishistory.org\n\nAbout Benjamin Franklin\n\nHere are answers to some frequently asked questions about Benjamin Franklin, from The Franklin Institute:\n\nWhen was Benjamin Franklin born?\n\nBenjamin Franklin was born on Sunday, Jan. 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts, which was then a British colony. His birthplace is at 17 Milk Street.\n\nWho were his parents?\n\nBenjamin Franklin's parents were Josiah Franklin and Abiah Folger. Josiah Franklin was born in Northamptonshire, England, in 1657, and came to the Colonies in 1682. He worked as a candle and soap maker in Boston. Abiah Folger was from Nantucket, Massachusetts.\n\nDid he have any siblings?\n\nBenjamin Franklin had 16 siblings. His father, Josiah, had seven children with his first wife, Anne Child, and 10 more with Abiah Folger. Ben was Josiah's 15th child and his youngest son.\n\nWhat did Benjamin Franklin want to be?\n\nFrom his school days on, Benjamin Franklin wanted to be a sailor. His father did not approve, because an older son, Josiah, had gone to sea and never returned. Because reading was Ben's favorite pastime, his father decided on the trade of printing and sent Ben to learn in his older brother's printing shop. Ben continued this learning in Philadelphia and England and eventually set up his own printing business in Philadelphia.\n\nWas Benjamin Franklin a Quaker?\n\nBenjamin Franklin was not a Quaker. He was baptized on the day he was born at the Old South Church's Cedar Meeting House on downtown Washington Street, Boston. In Philadelphia, he occasionally worshiped at Christ Church, the Church of England parish established in colonial Philadelphia in 1695 and later reorganized into the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America.\n\nDid Benjamin Franklin get married?\n\nIn September 1730, Benjamin Franklin entered into a common-law marriage with Deborah Read Rogers. Her first husband had abandoned her and disappeared, so she was not able to get a divorce and officially remarry. Deborah ran a general store in the same Philadelphia building as Ben’s printing shop. She died of a stroke in 1774 and is buried next to Ben in the cemetery of Christ Church.\n\nDid Benjamin Franklin have children?\n\nBenjamin Franklin had three children. William, born around 1730, was his illegitimate son with an unknown woman. He was raised by Ben and his wife, Deborah. He remained loyal to the British crown and became royal governor of New Jersey. Ben's second son, Francis, was born in 1732. He died of smallpox at age four. Ben's daughter, Sarah, was born in 1743. She married and had seven children.\n\nWhat jobs did Benjamin Franklin hold?\n\nBefore becoming involved with politics, Benjamin Franklin owned a printing shop in Philadelphia. Though he retired from printing in 1747, he continued to receive profits from the shop. He also served as postmaster of Philadelphia and co-deputy postmaster of British North America. In 1775, he became the first postmaster general of the United States.\n\nWhat did Benjamin Franklin invent?\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s long list of inventions includes bifocals, the lightning rod, the glass armonica, a library chair, swim fins, a long-reach device, the Franklin stove, and the catheter.\n\nDid Benjamin Franklin really fly a kite in a thunderstorm?\n\nYes, according to Franklin himself. In 1752, he tied a key to a kite string and took it outside during a thunderstorm. His goal was to prove that lightning was a form of electricity.\n\nWhich documents did he sign?\n\nBenjamin Franklin stands alone as the only person to have signed all four of the documents that helped to create the United States: the Declaration of Independence (1776); the Treaty of Alliance, Amity, and Commerce with France (1778); the Treaty of Peace between England, France, and the United States (1782); and the Constitution (1787). In addition, he helped to write parts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\n\nWhen did Benjamin Franklin die?\n\nBenjamin Franklin died at age 84 on April 17, 1790, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was born an Englishman and died an American. The cause of death was complications from pleurisy. He is buried in the cemetery of Christ Church, Philadelphia, next to his wife, Deborah."
