COAs are 4\" x 6\" card stock with silver foil embossed COA seal.\n\nAll blanks are cut as they are ordered.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenjamin Franklin was born on January 17, 1706 in Boston, MA, in what was known as the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was born in a small house at 17 Milk Street, across the street from the Old Meeting House. Franklin was born in this house and lived there for six years with his father Josiah, mother Abiah, and his 16 siblings. Benjamin was the 15th child and youngest son.\n\nFranklin stated that he was born at the corner of Hanover and Union Street in Boston, but according to the Bostonian Society he was mistaken. Records show that Josiah Franklin was a tenant at 17 Milk Street from 1685 to 1712, where Benjamin was born in 1706. The family later moved to Hanover and Union Street, where his father's soap and candle shop was located. Benjamin lived there with his family until the age of 17, when he decided to leave for Philadelphia.\n\nThe current building that stands on 17 Milk Street is not the original where Franklin was born. The original building was destroyed by a fire in 1811, making room for the building that stands there today. There is a bust of Franklin commemorating his birthplace on the second floor facade of the building. The inscription on the wall reads “Birthplace of Franklinâ\".\n\nHardin Penworks, LLC, certifies that the wood supplied to the artisan of the accompanying item was sourced from the historic spruce wood beams of the building currently occupying the original home of Benjamin Franklin on Milk Street.\n\nben franklin"
