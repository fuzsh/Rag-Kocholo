        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1) and Chrissy Houlahan (PA-6) introduced the Benjamin Franklin Statue Placement Act. This bill aims to recognize Benjamin Franklin’s immeasurable impact on the founding of the nation by placing a statue of him along the U.S. Capitol Tour route. The legislation would place a statue of Franklin in the Capitol prior to 2026, which coincides with the 250th anniversary of the nation’s founding. Fitzpatrick and Houlahan are joined by an evenly bipartisan group of 22 of their colleagues at the time of introduction.\n\n“Benjamin Franklin is a figure of paramount importance to the history of Philadelphia and this nation,\" said Fitzpatrick. \"I am proud to join my fellow Pennsylvanian, Rep. Houlahan, on this bipartisan effort to ensure that Dr. Franklin has a prominent place of honor in the United States Capitol.\"\n\n“As a Pennsylvanian, I am proud of our Commonwealth's history and how pivotal it was and still is in shaping our nation's story,\" said Houlahan. \"Bringing a statue of Benjamin Franklin, a prominent Pennsylvanian and important founding father, to the U.S. Capitol will help to reflect this legacy. I am grateful to Rep. Fitzpatrick for co-leading this effort with me and many of our Pennsylvanian colleagues for supporting it.”\n\nBackground:\n\nAccording to the Benjamin Franklin Historical Society, Franklin was an important statesman and diplomat, in addition to his notable scientific contributions, such as discovering that lightning was electricity. Franklin played an essential role in the American Revolution and the founding of the nation. He negotiated the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War, and helped draft the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Franklin was the only founding father to sign all three of these documents, which formally separated America from Britain. He also served as the first Postmaster General of the United States, appointed in 1775.\n\nWhile Benjamin Franklin was born in Massachusetts, his roots in Pennsylvania and his impact on its founding are undeniable. He was instrumental in founding and shaping what became the University of Pennsylvania; he bought and published the Pennsylvania Gazette at age 23 and even served as President of Pennsylvania’s Supreme Executive Council, the present-day equivalent of the governor, from 1785 to 1788. Throughout his life and beyond, Franklin was known as a renowned author, philanthropist, inventor, and businessman. Learn more about Franklin here."
