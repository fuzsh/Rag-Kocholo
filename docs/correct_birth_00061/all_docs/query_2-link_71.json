        "text": "(1706-1790)\n\nYour browser does not support the audio tag.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was the oldest delegate to the Philadelphia Convention.\n\nWith the possible exception of George Washington, Franklin was the best-known man in America.\n\nBorn into a poor family, Franklin became an inventor, scientist, diplomat, and publisher.\n\nHis Poor Richardâ€™s Almanac was read nationwide.\n\nHis career in public service was a long and varied one, including service as an ambassador to England and France and as governor of Pennsylvania.\n\nAt the Philadelphia Convention, Franklin was a compromiser, using his wit to bring delegates together.\n\nHe played an important role in creating the Great Compromise.\n\nFranklin favored a strong national government and argued that the the Framers should trust the judgment of the people.\n\nAlthough he was in poor health in 1787, Franklin missed few sessions, being carried to and from the meeting place in a special chair.\n\nAlthough he did not agree with everything in the Constitution, he believed that no other convention would come up with a better document."
