Facts about Benjamin Franklin - The Revolutionary War

How he got involved in the independence effort?

One reason Ben Franklin became so determined to fight for liberty was a result of something that happened in his youth. Ben's older brother James, to whom he was apprenticed as a printer, was a tyrannical and unjust employer. In fact, in his autobiography, Franklin made the following statement, [James'] "harsh and tyrannical treatment of me might be a means of impressing me with that aversion to arbitrary power that has stuck to me through my whole life."

In 1757, Benjamin Franklin went to England to represent the citizens of Pennsylvania in their grievances against the Penn family, who were the Crown appointed governors of Pennsylvania since its inception. Franklin ended up staying in England for nearly twenty years, eventually becoming the representative of Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Jersey and Massachusetts to the Royal Crown. Over the years, Franklin thought the British government's treatment of the colonists was growing more and more tyrannical. In 1772, Franklin's patience finally came to an end. He anonymously received some letters that were written by Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts. In the letters, Hutchinson urged the British Crown to send troops to Boston to quell the increasingly agitated citizens. Franklin viewed this as a horrible violation of the rights of British citizens and he sent the letters back to America to have them published publicly. Franklin eventually confessed publicly that it was he who had exposed the letters and was publicly reprimanded by the British government. Later that year he left England for good and joined the independence effort back in Philadelphia.

Did he see military action during the war?

Franklin did not see military action during the war.

Accomplishments during the war

Ben Franklin was appointed by the Second Continental Congress to the "Committee of Five," which was given the task of drafting the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson wrote the original draft, but with strong input from the other members who also revised Jefferson's original draft when it was complete. The other three members of the committee were John Adams, Robert Livingston and Roger Sherman.

Franklin voted to accept the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, famously saying, "We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately." He signed the document along with the other members of Congress in August.

Ben Franklin served Congress in various important positions, including as Commissioner to Canada, Ambassador to France and as a member of the Committee of Secret Correspondence dealing with spying and foreign intelligence. While serving as Ambassador to France, Franklin was responsible for persuading the French to give large amounts of money, supplies and manpower, including ships, soldiers and experienced military leaders to the American war effort. This was probably Franklin's most significant contribution to the war effort.

Franklin was one of three commissioners appointed by Congress to negotiate the terms of peace with Britain at the end of the war. The Treaty of Paris, as the peace treaty was known, was signed on September 3, 1783. The other commissioners were John Jay and John Adams.

Though not during the period of the Revolutionary War, but still a significant moment in the founding of the United States, Ben Franklin was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and a signer of the United States Constitution in 1787.

Benjamin Franklin retired officially from business at the age of 42 in 1748 after 20 years in the printing and publishing trade. He set up an arrangement with his foreman David Hall to have David continue to run the printing shop while paying Ben a sum of 1,000 pounds from the proceeds every year. This arrangement continued for the next 18 years giving Franklin the ability to live a life of leisure and time to pursue his many other interests. He bought a 300 acre farm in New Jersey to which he intended to retire, but soon public affairs called him away from the farm for good. He lived another 42 years and became highly involved in civic affairs after this semi-official "retirement." Later in life, after many years of public service, Franklin retired from his final publicly held office as 6th President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania on December 1, 1788.
