        "text": "Dissertation available through ProQuest, Open-Access: This dissertation examines the experience of Freemasonry, as practiced in the United States, Colombia, and through Masonic literature, from an anthropological perspective. The Freemasons are a fraternal society with a global presence. In this work, the experience of Freemasonry, as both an individual/personal journey and a shared/collective activity is discussed. The work utilizes a number of methods and theoretical bases, including, but not limited to, a reliance on both primary and secondary textual sources which enhance both an understanding of Freemasonry from Masonic perspectives as well as presents anthropological and interdisciplinary context and analyses. Theoretical discussions include, but are not limited to, a reconsideration of what constitutes a field site, how scholarship on secrecy can enhance the study of a society which generally does not consider itself a true secret society, and how texts can act both as reference and as a set of participants. The core inquiries of this project discuss how philosophical systems of individualism can be sustained through specific forms of collaboration, and how the simultaneity of the shared and the individual experience of Masonry constitutes a culture in its own right. Contributing to work done within the anthropology of Freemasonry, along with a range and combination of disciplinary and interdisciplinary orientations, such as an “activity-based approach”, and including elements of variation and consensus, this project provides a dialogue on themes of belonging, individualism, knowledge production, access, “activity”, and experience.\n\nThis phenomenological study begins to fill a void in the research literature on what is perhaps the largest secret society (so called) in the world – Freemasonry. While there is a considerable body of research on Masonry, these studies view Freemasonry from exoteric viewpoints of its sociocultural role in the broader context of society. This study looks at the esoteric meaning of Freemasonry as experienced by Freemasons, themselves, through phenomenological inquiry. This study is unique in that I am a Freemason and view this research through the lens of a deep-insider. In order to make my thoughts about Freemasonry transparent, I practiced radical reflexivity throughout the study. The research found that Masons’ experiences of Freemasonry were grounded in the existential Other. Four themes and two subthemes became apparent in the data. These themes suggested that Freemasonry is a way of knowing. These themes also support pre-existing research on the benefits of participation in fraternal organizations, generally, and in African American Masonic lodges, specifically. Alfred Schutz’s (1932/1967) realms of social reality are also used in thematic interpretation. Keywords: Freemasonry, phenomenology, deep-insider, radical reflexivity\n\nThe work that I suggest here is the presentation of a painted triptych concerning the three degrees of the Blue Lodge. I was inspired by different rites : modern Belgian ritual, ancient and accepted Scottish ritual and French ritual. An important principle guided me in this work, namely that everything is perception and that perceptions are subjective. In addition to the study of rituals and theoretical research on the authors, this work aimed to capture the perceptions and mental representations concerning symbolic tools and elements among Freemasons, as well as my own perceptions and understanding of these elements and tools.\n\nIn the richest manuscript heritage of Russian freemasons, who lived two centuries ago, there are numerous descriptions of various mystical experiences. These are visions and mystical dreams in which beings from the other world appeared, as well as deliberately evoked mystical states by which an adept attempts to penetrate into the other world. For censorship reasons, this aspect of the activities of Russian brothers practically did not go beyond the narrow circle of initiates. The article will attempt to present the main types of mystical experience reflected in the manuscripts of Russian freemasons, mostly diaries and correspondence. The most valuable information of this kind is contained in the so-called Masonic dreams. These stories constitute a special genre of Masonic literature and have been preserved in a significant number of manuscripts. They were based on the idea of a special inner, spiritual vision, which an adept possesses and which allows him to achieve clairvoyance. Masonic dreams contain a significant number of details related both to the Masonic ritual and symbolic decoration of the premises of Masonic lodges, and to those practices of moral self-improvement that are important for the Masonic path. Russian freemasons paid considerable attention to the problem of evaluating such experience: is it a gift from the divine essences or a temptation sent by demonic forces? The question of the significance of such an experience was also important: is it an accidental consequence of Masonic work, a hindrance on the way, or, on the contrary, a kind of confirmation of progress in following the Masonic path? The Orthodox Church, to which the Russian freemasons belonged, is extremely negative about such forms of mysticism. Therefore, they were forced to seek explanations for such phenomena in Catholic and Protestant mysticism, as well as in the European esoteric tradition. The article attempts to deal with these issues and is based on the analysis of a wide range of Masonic manuscripts of the 18th — early 19th centuries, preserved in the families of Russian masons and now kept in Moscow archives.\n\nThe term cosmic consciousness has been used by authors such as Psychiatrist Dr Richard Maurice Bucke and Solicitor and esoteric Freemason Walter Leslie Wilmshurst to describe the experience of becoming one with the Divine. Indeed, Bucke described the term Cosmic Consciousness in his book of the same name, first published in 1901, as 'a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man.' Bucke had experienced cosmic consciousness himself, which he described as occurring after spending the evening with friends reading the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Browning and Walt Whitman. After leaving his friends for home, he suddenly found himself 'wrapped around… by a flame-coloured cloud', though it seemed 'the light was within himself'. Bucke immediately felt 'a sense of exultation, of immense joyousness accompanied, or immediately followed, by an intellectual illumination quite impossible to describe.' Bucke goes on to say that 'his brain streamed one momentary lightning-flash of the Brahmic Splendour which has ever since lightened his life.' The experience changed his life forever, and Bucke said that 'upon his heart fell one drop of Brahamic Bliss, leaving thenceforward for always an aftertaste of heaven... and [he] knew that the Cosmos is not dead matter but a living Presence, that the soul of man is immortal…' Indeed, Bucke mentioned that he had learned more in those few seconds when he had experienced cosmic consciousness, than he had done in years of study. Walter Leslie Wilmshurst, wrote a paper entitled 'Notes on Cosmic Consciousness', which was published in the Occult Review in March 1924, where he expressed his thoughts on cosmic consciousness, describing it in a similar fashion to that of Bucke. Indeed, Wilmshurst believed that Freemasonry could teach us the pathway to achieve such an experience. This short paper will explore the history of such experiences and will discuss Wilmshurst's ideas."
