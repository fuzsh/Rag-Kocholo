Managing and extracting reliable information from such large series of data sets require the use of dedicated software organized in a consistent pipeline to reduce, validate, exploit, and ultimately export data. The compilation of multiple mass-spectrometry-based identification and quantification results obtained in the context of a large-scale project represents a real challenge for developers of bioinformatics solutions. In response to this challenge, we developed a dedicated software suite called hEIDI to manage and combine both identifications and semiquantitative data related to multiple LC-MS/MS analyses. This paper describes how, through a user-friendly interface, hEIDI can be used to compile analyses and retrieve lists of nonredundant protein groups. Moreover, hEIDI allows direct comparison of series of analyses, on the basis of protein groups, while ensuring consistent protein inference and also computing spectral counts. hEIDI ensures that validated results are compliant with MIAPE guidelines as all information related to samples and results is stored in appropriate databases. Thanks to the database structure, validated results generated within hEIDI can be easily exported in the PRIDE XML format for subsequent publication. hEIDI can be downloaded from http://biodev.extra.cea.fr/docs/heidi .\n\nRuth's resolve: what Jesus' great-grandmother may teach about bioethics and care.\n\nPubMed\n\nHall, Amy Laura\n\n2005-04-01\n\nWhen thinking about the intersection of care and Christian bioethics, it is helpful to follow closely the account of Ruth, who turned away from security and walked alongside her grieving mother-in-law to Bethlehem. Remembering Ruth may help one to heed Professor Kaveny's summoning of Christians to remember \"the Order of Widows\" and the church's historic calling to bring \"the almanah into its center rather than pushing her to its margins.\" Disabled, elderly and terminally ill people often seem, at least implicitly, expendable. By hearing the scriptural account of Jesus' steadfast great-grandmother, readers may recall another way. One may read Ruth's care for Naomi as a performative, prophetic act of faith. Ruth's faithful resolve, when set next to Orpah's prudent way, challenges the notion that a bioethic of care is innately feminine, and may further call women and men corporately to participate in a kind of care that is strenuous work.\n\nReading Johanna Spyri's \"Heidi\" in the Beginning German Language Classroom\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBaumgartner, Karin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe article explores the benefits of extensive reading in the beginning German language classroom.

Three indexes were developed for greater Vancouver, Canada using a pool of 20 potentially predictive variables categorized to reflect social vulnerability, population density, temperature exposure, and urban form. One variable was chosen from each category: an existing deprivation index, senior population density, apparent temperature, and road density, respectively. The three indexes were constructed from these variables using (1) unweighted, (2) weighted, and (3) data-driven Heat Exposure Integrated Deprivation Index (HEIDI) approaches. The performance of each index was assessed using mortality data from 1998-2014, and the maps were compared with respect to spatial patterns identified. The population-weighted spatial correlation between the three indexes ranged from 0.68-0.89. The HEIDI approach produced a graduated map of vulnerability, whereas the other approaches primarily identified areas of highest risk. All indexes performed best under extreme temperatures, but HEIDI was more useful at lower thresholds. Each of the indexes in isolation provides valuable information for public health protection, but combining the HEIDI approach with unweighted and weighted methods provides richer information about areas most vulnerable to heat.

These particles could be produced in the Sun and detected by a conversion into soft X-ray photons inside a strong magnetic field. In order to increase the sensitivity for physics beyond the Standard Model, detectors with a threshold below 1 keV as well as efficient background rejection methods are required to compensate for low energies and weak couplings resulting in very low detection rates. Those criteria are fulfilled by a detector utilizing the combination of a pixelized readout chip with an integrated Micromegas stage. These InGrid (Integrated Grid) devices can be build by photolithographic postprocessing techniques, resulting in a close to perfect match of grid and pixels facilitating the detection of single electrons on the chip surface. The high spatial resolution allows for energy determination by simple electron counting as well as for an event-shape based analysis as background rejection method. Tests at an X-ray generator revealed the energy threshold of an InGrid based X-ray detector to be well below the carbon KÎ± line at 277 eV. After the successful demonstration of the detectors key features, the detector was mounted at one of CAST's four detector stations behind an X-ray telescope in 2014. After several months of successful operation without any detector related interruptions, the InGrid based X-ray detector continues data taking at CAST in 2015. During operation at the experiment, background rates in the order of 10-5 keV-1 cm-2 s-1 have been achieved by application of a likelihood based method discriminating the non-photon background originating mostly from cosmic rays. For continued operation in 2016, an upgraded InGrid based detector is to be installed among other improvements including decoupling and sampling of the signal induced on the grid as well as a veto scintillator to further lower the\n\nRestoration of the endangered Ruth's golden aster (Pityopsis ruthii)\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nPityopsis ruthii Small (Small), Ruthâs golden aster, is an endangered herbaceous perennial that is endemic to small sections of the Hiwassee and Ocoee Rivers in the Southeastern United States.

The mill processed gold-silver (Au-Ag) ores mined from the Ruth Au-Ag deposit, which is adjacent to the mill site. The Ruth Au-Ag deposit is hosted in Mesozoic intrusive rocks and is similar to other Au-Ag deposits in the western Mojave Desert that are associated with Miocene volcanic centers that formed on a basement of Mesozoic granitic rocks (Bateman, 1907; Gardner, 1954; Rytuba, 1996). The volcanic rocks consist of silicic domes and associated flows, pyroclastic rocks, and subvolcanic intrusions (fig. 2) that were emplaced into Mesozoic silicic intrusive rocks (Troxel and Morton, 1962). The Ruth Mine is on Federal land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Tailings from the mine have been eroded and transported downstream into Homewood Canyon and then into Searles Valley (figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6). The BLM provided recreational facilities at the mine site for day-use hikers and restored and maintained the original mine buildings in collaboration with local citizen groups for use by visitors (fig. 7). The BLM requested that the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with Chapman University, measure arsenic (As) and other geochemical constituents in soils and tailings at the mine site and in stream sediments downstream from the mine in Homewood Canyon and in Searles Valley (fig. 3). The request was made because initial sampling of the site by BLM staff indicated high concentrations of As in tailings and soils adjacent to the Ruth Mine. This report summarizes data obtained from field sampling of mine tailings and soils adjacent to the Ruth Mine and stream sediments downstream from the mine on June 7, 2009. Our results permit a preliminary assessment of the sources of As and associated chemical constituents that could potentially impact humans and biota.\n\nExtending ORAC-DR for Offline Processing of ESO, INGRID, and Classic Cam data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCurrie, M.

This study is one of the first to estimate gas emissions from coal fires using field measurements at gas vents. The Truman Shepherd fire emissions are nearly 1400t CO(2)/yr and 16kg Hg/yr resulting from a coal combustion rate of 450-550t/yr. The sum of CO(2) emissions from seven vents at the Ruth Mullins fire is 726+/-72t/yr, suggesting that the fire is consuming about 250-280t coal/yr. Total Ruth Mullins fire CO and Hg emissions are estimated at 21+/-1.8t/yr and >840+/-170g/yr, respectively. The CO(2) emissions are environmentally significant, but low compared to coal-fired power plants; for example, 3.9x10(6)t CO(2)/yr for a 514-MW boiler in Kentucky. Using simple calculations, CO(2) and Hg emissions from coal-fires in the U.S. are estimated at 1.4x10(7)-2.9x10(8)t/yr and 0.58-11.5t/yr, respectively. This initial work indicates that coal fires may be an important source of CO(2), CO, Hg and other atmospheric constituents.\n\n2015 Summer Series - Ruth Globus - Flying Through the Ages: Rodent Research for Human Health\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2015-06-16\n\nRodents are a model organism to study the short and long term effects of space travel.

Particularly in major urban areas of the EU, capillary use of electric vehicles are being encouraged, however, as these vehicles will be powered by the grid, there is always the risk that load peaks will occur. This work is just one of several being developed as part of the 23.9 MLN Euros INGRID European project started in July 2012, which combines solid-state high-density hydrogen storage systems with advanced ICT technologies for distribution grids. One possible solution which has been designed, is an off-grid utility to store renewable electricity captured from wind/solar sources and a re-charging point for full battery electric cars. This work shows the preliminary financial assessment of two business models for the Park-for-Recharging concept to promote green e-mobility as a more convenient and economical means of by-car transport.\n\nDYNA3D, INGRID, and TAURUS: an integrated, interactive software system for crashworthiness engineering\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBenson, D.J.; Hallquist, J.O.; Stillman, D.W.\n\n1985-04-01\n\nCrashworthiness engineering has always been a high priority at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory because of its role in the safe transport of radioactive material for the nuclear power industry and military. As a result, the authors have developed an integrated, interactive set of finite element programs for crashworthiness analysis. The heart of the system is DYNA3D, an explicit, fully vectorized, large deformation structural dynamics code. DYNA3D has the following four capabilities that are critical for the efficient and accurate analysis of crashes: (1) fully nonlinear solid, shell, and beam elements for representing a structure, (2) a broad range of constitutivemoreÂ Â» models for representing the materials, (3) sophisticated contact algorithms for the impact interactions, and (4) a rigid body capability to represent the bodies away from the impact zones at a greatly reduced cost without sacrificing any accuracy in the momentum calculations. To generate the large and complex data files for DYNA3D, INGRID, a general purpose mesh generator, is used. It runs on everything from IBM PCs to CRAYS, and can generate 1000 nodes/minute on a PC. With its efficient hidden line algorithms and many options for specifying geometry, INGRID also doubles as a geometric modeller. TAURUS, an interactive post processor, is used to display DYNA3D output. In addition to the standard monochrome hidden line display, time history plotting, and contouring, TAURUS generates interactive color displays on 8 color video screens by plotting color bands superimposed on the mesh which indicate the value of the state variables. For higher quality color output, graphic output files may be sent to the DICOMED film recorders. We have found that color is every bit as important as hidden line removal in aiding the analyst in understanding his results. In this paper the basic methodologies of the programs are presented along with several crashworthiness calculations.Â«Â less\n\nEffects of Bedrock Lithology and Subglacial Till on the Motion of Ruth Glacier, Alaska, Deduced from Five Pulses from 1973-2012\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTurrin, J.; Forster, R.; Sauber, Jeanne; Hall, Dorothy K.; Bruhn, R.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA pulse is a type of unstable glacier flow intermediate between normal flow and surging. Using Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM+ imagery and feature tracking software, a time-series of mostly annual velocity maps from 1973 to 2012 was produced that reveals five pulses of Ruth Glacier, Alaska. Peaks in ice velocity were found in the 1981, 1989, 1997, 2003, and 2010; approximately every 7 years. During these peak years the ice velocity increased 300%, from approximately 40 m/yr to 160 m/yr, and occurred in an area of the glacier underlain by sedimentary bedrock. Based on the spatio-temporal behavior of Ruth Glacier during the pulse cycles, we suggest the pulses are due to enhanced basal motion via deformation of a subglacial till. The cyclical nature of the pulses is theorized to be due to a thin till, with low permeability, that causes incomplete drainage of the till between the pulses, followed by eventual recharge and dilation of the till. These findings suggest care is needed when attempting to correlate changes in regional climate with decadal-scale changes in velocity, because in some instances basal conditions may have a greater influence on ice dynamics than climate.\n\nNegotiating international bioethics: a response to Tom Beauchamp and Ruth Macklin.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaker, Robert\n\n1998-12-01\n\nCan the bioethical theories that have served American bioethics so well, serve international bioethics as well? In two papers in the previous issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, I contend that the form of principlist fundamentalism endorsed by American bioethicists like Tom Beauchamp and Ruth Macklin will not play on an international stage. Deploying techniques of postmodern scholarship, I argue that principlist fundamentalism justifies neither the condemnation of the Nazi doctors at Nuremberg, nor, as the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) demonstrates, condemnation of Cold War radiation researchers. Principlist fundamentalism thus appears to be philosophy bankrupt. In this issue of the Journal, Beauchamp and Macklin reject this claim, arguing that I have misread the ACHRE report and misunderstood Nazism. They also argue that the form of post-postmodern negotiated human rights theory that I proffer is adequate only insofar as it is itself really fundamentalist; insofar as I take postmodernism seriously, however, I mire international bioethics in relativism. In this response, I reaffirm my anti-fundamentalism, provide further evidence in support of my reading of the ACHRE report, and defend my post-postmodern version of rights theory. I also develop criteria for a minimally adequate theoretical framework for international bioethics.\n\n\"The expectation gap\": a look at the Sybil Palmer Bellos lecture by Ruth B.

Results from an international study of postmenopausal women in the Raloxifene Use for the Heart (RUTH) Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaniels, Lori B; Grady, Deborah; Mosca, Lori; Collins, Peter; Mitlak, Bruce H; Amewou-Atisso, Messan G; Wenger, Nanette K; Barrett-Connor, Elizabeth\n\n2013-03-01\n\nSeveral studies have concluded that diabetes mellitus and heart disease carry similar risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most of these studies were too small to quantify independent risks specific to women. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diabetes mellitus is a coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalent for prediction of future CHD and CVD events in women. The Raloxifene Use for the Heart (RUTH) trial was an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of raloxifene and CVD outcomes in 10 101 postmenopausal women selected for high CHD risk. Of these, 3672 had a history of diabetes mellitus without known CHD, and 3265 had a history of CHD without known diabetes mellitus. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare cardiovascular outcomes in these 2 groups. Mean age at baseline was 67.5 years; median follow-up was 5.6 years. There were 725 deaths, including 450 cardiovascular deaths. In age-adjusted analyses, diabetic women had an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with women with CHD. Although the overall risk of CHD and CVD was lower in diabetic women compared with women with CHD, the risk of fatal CHD, fatal CVD, and all-cause mortality was similar (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.85 [0.65-1.12], 0.99 [0.78-1.25], and 1.18 [0.98-1.42], respectively, after adjusting for age, lifestyle factors, CHD risk factors, statin use, and treatment assignment).

Within the coastal ice-free and ice-covered region, marine elements (Na, Ca, Mg, K, Li, and Sr) revealed enhanced concentrations as compared with inland sites. Along with the sea-salt elements, the coastal ice-free sites were also characterized by enhanced concentrations of Al, Fe, Mn, V, Cr, and Zn. The crustal enrichment factors (Efc) confirm a dominant crustal source for Fe and Al and a significant source for Cr, V, Co, and Ba, which clearly reflects the influence of petrological characteristics of the Larsemann Hills on the trace elemental composition of surface snow. The Efc of elements revealed that Zn, Cu, Mo, Cd, As, Se, Sb, and Pb are highly enriched compared with the known natural sources, suggesting an anthropogenic origin for these elements. Evaluation of the contributions to surface snow from the different sources suggests that while contribution from natural sources is relatively significant, local contamination from the increasing research station and logistic activities within the proximity of study area cannot be ignored.\n\nEvaluation of the Dornier Gmbh interactive grid generation system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBrown, Robert L.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAn interactive grid generation program, INGRID, is investigated and evaluated. A description of the task and work performed, a description and evaluation of INGRID, and a discussion of the possibilities for bringing INGRID into the NASA and Numerical Aerodynamic Simulator (NAS) computing environments is included. The interactive grid generation program was found to be a viable approach for grid generation and determined that it could be converted to work in the NAS environment but that INGRID does not solve the fundamentally hard problems associated with grid generation, specifically, domain decomposition.\n\n77 FR 73031 - Change in Bank Control Notices; Acquisitions of Shares of a Bank or Bank Holding Company\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-12-07\n\n..., Judith Ann Guttau, and the Heidi Guttau-Fox and Joshua Guttau Irrevocable Living Trust, Treynor, Iowa, Heidi Ann Guttau-Fox, Minden, Iowa, and Joshua Michael Guttau, Treynor, Iowa, as Trustees, as group...\n\nHurricane Ingrid and Tropical Storm Hanna's effects on the salinity of the coastal aquifer, Quintana Roo, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKovacs, Shawn E.; Reinhardt, Eduard G.; Stastna, Marek; Coutino, Aaron; Werner, Christopher; Collins, Shawn V.; Devos, Fred; Le Maillot, Christophe\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThere is a lack of information on aquifer dynamics in anchialine systems, especially in the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula of Mexico. Most of our knowledge is based on ;spot; measurements of the aquifer with no long-term temporal monitoring. In this study spanning four years (2012-2016), sensors (water depth and conductivity (salinity)) were deployed and positioned (-9 and -10 m) in the meteoric Water Mass (WM) close to the transition with the marine WM (halocline) in 2 monitoring sites within the Yax Chen cave system to investigate precipitation effects on the salinity of the coastal aquifer. The results show variation in salinity (<1 ppt) of the freshwater over seasonal cycles of wet and dry (approx. 6.5-7.25 ppt), depending on the position of the halocline. The aquifer response to larger precipitation events (>95 mm) such as Hurricane Ingrid (2013) and Tropical Storm Hanna (2014) shows meteoric water mass salinity rapidly increasing (approx. 6.39 to >8.6 ppt), but these perturbations have a shorter duration (weeks and days). Wavelet analysis of the salinity record indicates seasonal mixing effects in agreement with the wet and dry periods, but also seasonal effects of tidal mixing (meteoric and marine water masses) occurring on shorter time scales (diurnal and semi-diurnal). These results demonstrate that the salinity of the freshwater lens is influenced by precipitation and turbulent mixing with the marine WM. The salinity response is scaled with precipitation; larger more intense rainfall events (>95 mm) create a larger response in terms of the magnitude and duration of the salinity perturbation (>1 ppt). The balance of precipitation and its intensity controls the temporal and spatial patterning of meteoric WM salinity.\n\n\"When Does It Stop Being Peanut Butter?\": FDA Food Standards of Identity, Ruth Desmond, and the Shifting Politics of Consumer Activism, 1960s-1970s.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoyce, Angie M\n\nThis article uses a historical controversy over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's standard of identity for peanut butter as a site for investigating three topics of high importance for historians of technology, consumption, and food activism: how new industrial food-processing technologies have become regulatory problems; how government, industry, and consumer actors negotiate standards development; and how laypeople try to shape technological artifacts in spaces dominated by experts. It examines the trajectory of consumer activist Ruth Desmond, co-founder of the organization the Federation of Homemakers. By following Desmond's evolving strategies, the article shows how the broader currents of the 1960s-70s consumer movement played out in a particular case. Initially Desmond used a traditional style that heavily emphasized her gendered identity, working within a grassroots organization to promote legislative and regulatory reforms. Later, she moved to a more modern advocacy approach, using adversarial legal methods to fight for consumer protections.\n\nObservations of Uranus and Neptune in Spanish Telescopes: Calar Alto/PlanetCam, WHT/Ingrid y GTC/Osiris\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHueso, R.; SÃ¡nchez-Lavega, A.; Ordonez-Etxeberria, I.; Rojas, J. F.; PÃ©rez-Hoyos, S.; Mendikoa, I.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe astronomical observation of the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune poses unique challenges. Both planets are relatively dimm objects (visual magnitude of +5.3 and +7.7) and have small angular sizes (3.7â and 2.4â at opposition). Both worlds have atmospheres that are very dynamic, specially Neptune. These atmospheres are dominated by intense zonal winds that reach 450 m/s and where seasonal evolution changes the band patterns present in these planets. Thanks to the atmospheric methane gas, when observing Uranus and Neptune in near infrared wavelengths their upper clouds become well contrasted and bright and observations at different methane absorption bands allow to sample the atmosphere at different vertical layers. Both worlds are subject to the development of bright cloud patterns, some times of convective origin and whose activity can extend over weeks to several months or years. In the last few years we have surveyed the atmospheric activity of Uranus and Neptune with instruments able to improve the spatial resolution of the images beyond the limits impose by the atmospheric seeing. We use the Lucky Imaging technique (fast observation of several short-exposure frames combined with automatic selection of best frames and coregistration for stacking). We present image observations of Uranus and Neptune obtained with the instruments: OSIRIS at Grantecan as well as the AstraLux and PlanetCam UPV/EHU cameras on the 2.2m telescope at Calar Alto observatory. These observations are compared with other observations acquired by amateur astronomers able to obtain resolve cloud features in Uranus and Neptune. We compare these observations with images acquired with Adaptive Optics instruments at the William Herschel with the NAOMI+Ingrid instruments and Keck II and with Hubble Space Telescope images. We show the importance of surveying the atmospheric activity of these planets with a variety of telescopes.

The detector consists of 14 modules in total, which are spread over a range of off-axis angles from 0Â° to 1.1Â°. The variation in the neutrino energy spectrum as a function of the off-axis angle, combined with event topology information, is used to calculate this cross section as a function of neutrino energy. The cross section is measured to be Ïc c(1.1 GeV )=1.10 Â±0.15 (1 0-38 cm2/nucleon) , Ïc c(2.0 GeV )=2.07 Â±0.27 (1 0-38 cm2/nucleon) , and Ïc c(3.3 GeV )=2.29 Â±0.45 (1 0-38 cm2/nucleon), at energies of 1.1, 2.0, and 3.3 GeV, respectively. These results are consistent with the cross section calculated by the neutrino interaction generators currently used by T2K. More importantly, the method described here opens up a new way to determine the energy dependence of neutrino-nucleus cross sections.\n\nHurricanes Ingrid and Manuel (2013) and their impact on the salinity of the Meteoric Water Mass, Quintana Roo, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCoutino, Aaron; Stastna, Marek; Kovacs, Shawn; Reinhardt, Eduard\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe report on measurements of the salinity and temperature in the Yax Chen cave system on the Yuacatan peninsula. This paper is submitted together with Kovacs et al. (2017). Kovacs et al. focuses on the salinity levels of the meteoric lens, while this paper uses the observed results to elucidate the hydrodynamics. The cave passages have water depths on the order of 10 m, with flow on the order of ten centimeters a second, and as such is a hydrodynamic, as opposed to a porous, system. The measurements reveal that episodes of significant mixing between the fresh meteoric lens and the underlying salty water are driven by meteorological events (e.g., Hurricane Rina in 2011, and the twin Hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel in 2013). We find evidence that after the hurricanes in 2013, the water column remains unstable for several months. Through wavelet analysis, we find that the marine Water Mass (WM) exhibits much less low period activity compared to the meteoric WM. We hypothesize that the open cenotes are locations of high mixing intensity, with turbulent fronts propagating away from the sites of direct mixing into the cave network. We perform laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to explore this phenomenon, and find that mixing preferentially occurs on the flanks of regions of strong, stable density stratification (i.e., on the periphery of pycnoclines), and leads to entrainment of fluid into the turbulent region. Using high resolution direct numerical simulation, we explore the detailed manner in which turbulent entrainment can drive flow toward the mixing region, and lead to mixing of passive tracers. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the mixing of passive tracers, such as suspended chemicals.\n\nStorm time plasma transport in a unified and inter-coupled global magnetosphere model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIlie, R.; Liemohn, M. W.; Toth, G.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nWe present results from the two-way self-consistent coupling between the kinetic Hot Electron and Ion Drift Integrator (HEIDI) model and the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF). HEIDI solves the time dependent, gyration and bounced averaged kinetic equation for the phase space density of different ring current species and computes full pitch angle distributions for all local times and radial distances. During geomagnetic times the dipole approximation becomes unsuitable even in the inner magnetosphere. Therefore the HEIDI model was generalized to accommodate an arbitrary magnetic field and through the coupling with SWMF it obtains a magnetic field description throughout the HEIDI domain along with a plasma distribution at the model outer boundary from the Block Adaptive Tree Solar Wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model within SWMF. Electric field self-consistency is assured by the passing of convection potentials from the Ridley Ionosphere Model (RIM) within SWMF. In this study we test the various levels of coupling between the 3 physics based models, highlighting the role that the magnetic field, plasma sheet conditions and the cross polar cap potential play in the formation and evolution of the ring current. We show that the dynamically changing geospace environment itself plays a key role in determining the geoeffectiveness of the driver. The results of the self-consistent coupling between HEIDI, BATS-R-US and RIM during disturbed conditions emphasize the importance of a kinetic self-consistent approach to the description of geospace.\n\nHeidi Pilath | NREL\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\n; Journal of Solar Energy Engineering-Transactions of the Asme 128(1): 54-57.

L. (Principal Investigator)\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe author has identified the following significant results. A significant and possible major economic example of the practical value of Skylab photographs was provided by locating on Skylab Camera Station Number 4, frame 010, SL-2, an area of exposures of limestone rocks which were thought to be completely covered by volcanic rocks based upon prior mapping. The area is located less than 12 miles north of the Ruth porphyry copper deposit, White Pine County, Nevada. This is a major copper producing open pit mine owned by Kennecott Copper Corporation. Geophysical maps consisting of gravity and aeromagnetic studies have been published indicating three large positive magnetic anomalies located at the Ruth ore deposits, the Ward Mountain, not a mineralized area, and in the area previously thought to be completely covered by post-ore volcanics. Skylab photos indicate, however, that erosion has removed volcanic cover in specific sites sufficient to expose the underlying older rocks suggesting, therefore, that the volcanic rocks may not be the cause of the aeromagnetic anomaly. Field studies have verified the initial interpretations made from the Skylab photos. The potential significance of this study is that the large positive aeromagnetic anomaly suggests the presence of cooled and solidified magma below the anomalies, in which ore-bearing solutions may have been derived forming possible large ore deposits.\n\nAnimal welfare: what has changed in the past 50 years?\n\nPubMed\n\n2014-07-12\n\nThe 3(rd) CABI symposium on animal welfare and behaviour was held on June 11, and featured a range of talks on 'animals as machines'.

The objective of the study was to quantify the differences in ICT use, attitudes, and reasons for nonuse among physically frail, prefrail, and nonfrail home-dwelling seniors. This was a population-based questionnaire study on people aged 65-98 years living in Northern Finland. A total of 794 eligible individuals responded out of a contacted random sample of 1500. In this study, 29.8% (237/794) of the respondents were classified as frail or prefrail. The ICT use of frail persons was lower than that of the nonfrail ones. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, age and education level were associated with both the use of Internet and advanced mobile ICT such as smartphones or tablets. Controlling for age and education, frailty or prefrailty was independently related to the nonuse of advanced mobile ICT (odds ratio, OR=0.61, P=.01), and frailty with use of the Internet (OR=0.45, P=.03). The frail or prefrail ICT nonusers also held the most negative opinions on the usefulness or usability of mobile ICT. When opinion variables were included in the model, frailty status remained a significant predictor of ICT use. Physical frailty status is associated with older peoples' ICT use independent of age, education, and opinions on ICT use. This should be taken into consideration when designing preventive and assistive technologies and interventions for older people at risk of health impairment.

It is analogous to the Haissinski equation, being derived from Vlasov-Fokker-Planck theory, but is quite different in form. We prove existence of a unique solution, thus the existence of a unique equilibrium state, for sufficiently small current. This is done for the Chao-Ruth model of the beam-beam interaction in one degree of freedom. We expect no difficulty in generalizing the argument to more realistic models.\n\n8.

This study examines the development of self-efficacy in upper-division physics majors within the Physics 310 - Analytic Mechanics course at California State University, Long Beach during the fall semester of 2015. The Sources of Self-Efficacy in Science Courses - Physics (SOSESC-P), as developed by Drs. Heidi Fencl and Karen Scheel in 2002, was administered to students enrolled in the class in a pre-test/post-test format to identify increases in self-efficacy during the course. Students demonstrated a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy on only one subscore of the SOSESC-P. The collaborative nature of the class is thought to have had an effect on the Social Persuasion (t (23) = 2.11, p = 0.023) aspect of self-efficacy development. Students also reported perceptions of departmental support and participation in department-sponsored activities.\n\n75 FR 4579 - Certificate of Alternative Compliance for the Offshore Supply Vessel INGRID\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-01-28\n\n...

After her employer refused to pay her, citing a provision of the German law that exempted employers from paying for sickness leave when a worker works fewer than 10 hours a week, she challenged the law as violating equal pay provisions of Article 119 of the European Communities Treaty. To support her challenge she pointed to statistics showing that a far greater percentage of workers working no more than 10 hours a week were women than men. Upon referral of the case by the German court hearing it, the European Court of Justice held that Article 119 precludes national legislation permitting employers to exclude from payment of sick pay employees who do not work more than 10 hours a week if that measure affects a far greater number of men than women, unless it is shown that the legislation is justified by objective facts unrelated to any discrimination based on sex. It also ruled that it was up to the German court to determine whether the legislation in question was so justified.\n\nResponsibilising managers and clinicians, neglecting system health?

Threlkel.\n\nPubMed\n\n1994-08-01\n\nThe Florida District Court of Appeal for the First District held that a physician has no duty to the children of a patient with a genetic disease to warn the patient that the disease is inherited so that the children can be tested and treated if need be. Dr. Threlkel had operated on the mother of Heidi Pate for medullary thyroid cancer three years before Pate's own medullary thyroid cancer was diagnosed and treated. Because Pate was not his patient and did not fit within any exception to the requirement that there be a physician patient relationship, the doctor owed no legal duty to her. The court distinguished this case from cases that involve the transmission of infectious or contagious disease through close contact, and from cases that involve the transmission of genetic disease due to the failure to diagnose it or to disclose the risk of it and thus prevent the birth of a genetically impaired child. In those cases a duty to warn does extend to family members.\n\nBruno Braunerde und die Bodentypen - Learning about soil diversity and soil functions with cartoon characters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHofmann, Anett\n\n2015-04-01\n\n\"Bruno Braunerde und die Bodentypen\" is a German-language learning material that fosters discovery of soil diversity and soil functions in kids, teens and adults who enjoy interactive learning activities.

One was a research component in the Foreign Morale Analysis Division (FMAD), a subunit of the Office of War Information. The principal FMAD figure who did most of the research on Japanese suicide and ways to prevent suicide among the Japanese military was the anthropologist Ruth Benedict, assisted by her Japanese-American aide Robert Hashima. The second facet was the suicide prevention program itself, which was put into effect toward the end of the war in the battles of Saipan and Okinawa. This program of action was undertaken by American GIs.

The structure of the SiB model is described, and its performance is evaluated in terms of its ability to realistically and accurately simulate biophysical processes over a number of test sites, including Ruthe (Germany), South Carolina (U.S.), and Central Wales (UK), for which point biophysical and micrometeorological data were available. The model produced simulations of the energy balances of barley, wheat, maize, and Norway Spruce sites over periods ranging from 1 to 40 days. Generally, it was found that the model reproduced time series of latent, sensible, and ground-heat fluxes and surface radiative temperature comparable with the available data.\n\nThe five elements and Chinese-American mortality.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, Gary\n\n2006-01-01\n\nD. P. Phillips, T. E. Ruth, and L. M.

For example, because fire is associated with the heart, a Chinese person born in a fire year (such as 1937) is more likely to die of heart disease than is a Chinese person born in a nonfire year. However, many diseases were excluded from this study, some diseases that were included have ambiguous links to birth years, and the statistical tests were indirect. A more complete statistical analysis and independent California mortality data for the years 1960-1968 and 1991-2002 did not replicate the original results.

The quantitative amino acid and amino sugar content of these walls is reported. The pleiotypes, which are identified culturally by their failure to elaborate coagulase, their resistance to bacteriophage, and their sensitivity to mannitol, have altered molar ratios of amino acids and amino sugars in their cell walls. In comparison with lysine content, the serine content of the mutant wall is elevated and the glycine content is reduced. The glucosamine content is reduced also. It is postulated that the pleiotropic mutants possess an altered cell wall biosynthetic pathway.

This study investigated the chain conformation of fucoidans from sea cucumber Acaudina molpadioides (Am-FUC), Isostichopus badionotus (Ib-FUC) and Apostichopus japonicus (Aj-FUC), of which primary structure has been recently clarified. Chain conformation parameters demonstrated that studied SC-FUCs adopted random coil conformation in 150mM NaCl solution (pH 7.4). Based on the worm-like cylinder model and atomic force microscopy, the chain stiffness of SC-FUCs was further evaluated as Am-FUCâIb-FUC>Aj-FUC. It was suggested that the existence of branch structure increased the chain flexibility, while sulfated pattern exerted limited influence. SC-FUCs demonstrated shear-thinning rheological behavior and negative charge. Am-FUC possessed a higher thermostability than Ib-FUC and Aj-FUC. These results have important implications for understanding the molecular characteristics of SC-FUCs, which could facilitate their further application. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Next to Bridges is Heidi Hollingsworth, with the Center for Independent Living, who uses American Sign Language for any hearing-impaired employees in the audience\n\nInformation Literacy Advocates: developing student skills through a peer support approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nCurtis, Ruth\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSince 2013/2014, an Information Literacy Advocates (ILA) scheme has been running at the University of Nottingham as an extracurricular module on the Nottingham Advantage Award programme. The Information Literacy Advocates scheme, which recruits medicine and health sciences students in their second year or above, aims to facilitate development of information literacy skills and confidence, as well as communication, organisation and teamwork, through the provision of peer support. Previous research indicates peer assistance effectively enhances such skills and is valued by fellow students who welcome the opportunity to approach more experienced students for help. This article, written by guest writer Ruth Curtis from the University of Nottingham, provides an overview of administering the ILA scheme and explores its impact on the Information Literacy Advocates, peers and librarians, and discusses future developments for taking the scheme forward.

It is analogous to the Haissinski equation, being derived from Vlasov-Fokker-Planck theory, but is quite different in form. The equation is analyzed for the case of the Chao-Ruth model of the beam-beam interaction in one degree of freedom, a so-called strong-strong model with nonlinear beam-beam force. We prove existence of a unique solution, for sufficiently small beam current, by an application of the implicit function theorem. We have not yet proved that this solution is positive, asmoreÂ Â» would be required to establish existence of an equilibrium. There is, however, numerical evidence of a positive solution. We expect that our analysis can be extended to more realistic models.Â«Â less\n\nDirect estimation of diffuse gaseous emissions from coal fires: current methods and future directions\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nEngle, Mark A.; Olea, Ricardo A.; O'Keefe, Jennifer M. K.; Hower, James C.; Geboy, Nicholas J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCoal fires occur in nature spontaneously, contribute to increases in greenhouse gases, and emit atmospheric toxicants. Increasing interest in quantifying coal fire emissions has resulted in the adaptation and development of specialized approaches and adoption of numerical modeling techniques. Overview of these methods for direct estimation of diffuse gas emissions from coal fires is presented in this paper. Here we take advantage of stochastic Gaussian simulation to interpolate CO2 fluxes measured using a dynamic closed chamber at the Ruth Mullins coal fire in Perry County, Kentucky. This approach allows for preparing a map of diffuse gas emissions, one of the two primary ways that gases emanate from coal fires, and establishing the reliability of the study both locally and for the entire fire. Future research directions include continuous and automated sampling to improve quantification of gaseous coal fire emissions.\n\nWomen of the Manhattan Project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarshall, Jill\n\n2009-10-01\n\nIn the book Their Day in the Sun, Ruth Howes and Caroline Herzenberg documented more than 1000 women who worked on the Manhattan Project, preserving their legacy for generations to come. At the 2009 Chicago meeting, the AAPT Committee on Women in Physics celebrated the accomplishments of these women and the men who worked beside them. Howes presented an overview of the contributions of women to the development of the first nuclear weapon, and the session was honored with talks from two Manhattan project veterans, Ellen Cleminshaw Weaver, who worked at Oak Ridge, and Dorothy Marcus Gans, who worked as a technician in the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. I will present a summary of the session, analyzing the effect of working on the project on the career trajectories of the women involved, and point listeners toward additional documentation of this history.\n\nMapping mass movement processes using terrestrial LIDAR: a swift mechanism for hazard and disaster risk assessment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarnica-PeÃ±a, Ricardo; Murillo-GarcÃ­a, Franny; AlcÃ¡ntara-Ayala, Irasema\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe impact of disasters associated with mass movement processes has increased in the past decades. Either triggered by earthquakes, volcanic activity or rainfall, mass movement processes have affected people, infrastructure, economic activities and the environment in different parts of the world. Extensive damage is particularly linked to rainfall induced landslides due to the occurrence of tropical storms, hurricanes, and the combination of different meteorological phenomenon on exposed vulnerable communities. Therefore, landslide susceptibility analysis, hazard and risk assessments are considered as significant mechanisms to lessen the impact of disasters. Ideally, these procedures ought to be carried out before disasters take place. However, under intense or persistent periods of rainfall, the evaluation of potentially unstable slopes becomes a critical issue. Such evaluations are constrained by the availability of resources, capabilities and scientific and technological tools. Among them, remote sensing has proved to be a valuable tool to evaluate areas affected by mass movement processes during the post-disaster stage. Nonetheless, the high cost of imagery acquisition inhibits their wide use. High resolution topography field surveys consequently, turn out to be an essential approach to address landslide evaluation needs. In this work, we present the evaluation and mapping of a series of mass movement processes induced by hurricane Ingrid in September, 2013, in TeziutlÃ¡n, Puebla, MÃ©xico, a municipality situated 265 km Northeast of Mexico City. Geologically, TeziutlÃ¡n is characterised by the presence, in the North, of siltstones and conglomerates of the Middle Jurassic, whereas the central and Southern sectors consist of volcanic deposits of various types: andesitic tuffs of Tertiary age, and basalts, rhyolitic tuffs and ignimbrites from the Quaternary. Major relief structures are formed by the accumulation of volcanic material; lava domes, partially buried\n\nOut of the Shadows\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nByers, Nina; Williams, Gary\n\n2006-08-01\n\nForeword Freeman J.
