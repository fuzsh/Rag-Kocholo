        "text": "Metro AG history, profile and corporate video\n\nMetro AG is a holding company, which engages in the retail and wholesale industry. It operates through the following segments: Metro Cash and Carry, Real, Media-Saturn, Galeria Kaufhof, and Real Estate. The Metro Cash and Carry segment operates the wholesale division through the Metro and Makro brands. The Real segment involves the operation of hypermarkets and online store which offer food products, clothing, shoes, electronics, books, sound storage devices, household goods, sports, toys, and leisure products. The Media-Saturn segment offers assortment of brand products in consumer electronics retailing. The Galeria Kaufhof segment includes the operation of department stores in Germany and Belgium. The Real Estate segment comprises all real estate assets and related services. The company was founded on July 18, 1996 and is headquartered in Dusseldorf, Germany.“\n\n“History of the METRO GROUP\n\nDevelopment of the METRO GROUP in an annual overview starting in 1996\n\n1996\n\nWithin a period of only ten months, METRO AG is formed through a merger of the retail companies Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus AG, Kaufhof Holding AG and Deutsche SB-Kauf AG. The group goes on the stock market in the same year. On July 25, 1996, METRO AG shares are listed for the first time on the DAX German Stock Index. With a market capitalization of 12.07 billion German marks, METRO AG ends the year 1996 as one of the 20 largest publicly listed companies in Germany. It also advances its internationalization process: the company expands into Romania and China.\n\n1997\n\nMETRO AG further advances its expansion outside of Germany: international moves include the opening of the first Makro Cash & Carry wholesale outlet in the Czech Republic and the entry of Real into the Polish market. Turnover abroad in 1997 accounts for 7.1 percent of total turnover. In addition, the group begins to concentrate more on its core business: peripheral activities and unprofitable sales divisions are relinquished. The group structures itself into 13 business areas – from wholesale to fashion retail.\n\n1998\n\nIn the most successful year in company history, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) grow 63.5 percent to 1.6 billion German marks. Metro shares outstrip all other DAX 30 stocks. The group streamlines its portfolio further: At year end, METRO AG has become a clearly structured corporation, with four business areas and several cross-divisional service companies, which operate on a group-wide basis. Progress is also made in internationalization: in 1998, business abroad already contributes 35.2 percent to total turnover. Media Markt expands into Poland.\n\n1999\n\nMETRO AG liquidates its retail properties. This gives the company leeway for key investments, which accelerate its growth in wholesale and retail. Following the reorientation of the group in 1998, its focus is now on optimizing its sales concepts. Real and Kaufhof join PAYBACK – the largest and most important customer loyalty program in Germany. In addition, METRO AG continues to consistently expand its international presence: 16 Metro Cash & Carry wholesale outlets, ten Real hypermarkets and 47 nonfood specialty centers open abroad. The share of turnover generated outside of Germany grows to 39.2 percent.\n\n2000\n\nMETRO AG has developed into an internationally oriented company with decentralized management teams. The share of its turnover generated outside of Germany grows to 42.2 percent. The group employs approximately 220,000 people in 22 countries. In order to support career development throughout its workforce, METRO AG expands its staff development programs and introduces new qualification, assessment and remuneration systems. The company is increasingly capital market-oriented. For the first time, the group releases its financial statement for the year 2000 in accordance to the International Accounting Standards (IAS), to achieve greater transparency in its accounting. In addition, the control and management system EVA (Economic Value Added) is introduced in order to strengthen entrepreneurial thinking throughout the group. In 2000, METRO AG ranks no. 18 among DAX 30 companies. The Metro share is one of the 20 most traded DAX stocks.\n\n2001\n\n2001 is a year of daunting entrepreneurial challenges. The reasons include continuing stagnation in German retail, as well as a generally unfavorable economic situation. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington have an unsettling effect on consumers. Despite this market trend, METRO AG finishes the year with positive business results. The company makes further progress in its international expansion course: 80 new locations are added in 2001, including the first Metro Cash & Carry wholesale outlets in Russia. An additional key component in the company’s success is the development of its sales divisions into retail brands – unmistakable entities in the marketplace.\n\n2002\n\nIn November 2002, Metro AG takes a further step in consolidating its position as a modern, international wholesale and retail company. From this point on, the company presents itself on a worldwide scale as the METRO GROUP. The move underscores the sense of belonging to a single, powerful alliance, shared by all of the retail brands and group companies. In addition, the METRO GROUP hones its profile as an international retail group and successful DAX 30-listed corporation. This positioning is supported by the brand message, “METRO GROUP – The Spirit of Commerce.” It expresses the key attributes of the corporate identity that has been developed over the past years: innovation, success-orientation and internationality. The METRO GROUP enters the Japanese and Vietnamese markets.\n\n2003\n\nThe METRO GROUP operates in 28 countries. Business in Eastern Europe and Asia makes an especially strong contribution to the positive development of its sales. Metro Cash & Carry opens its first stores in Ukraine and India. As one of the leading companies in its sector, the METRO GROUP launches the most far-reaching innovation initiative commerce has ever seen. In the context of the METRO GROUP Future Store Initiative, the company tests forward-looking technologies like Radio Frequency Identification – RFID for short. The innovative technology facilitates more efficient warehouse management, while rendering shopping faster, more individual and convenient. As of April 2003, consumers can experience the future of retail firsthand at the METRO GROUP Future Store in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Rheinberg.\n\n2004\n\nBy the end of the year, the METRO GROUP is active in 30 countries worldwide. It possesses a clear profile as a modern, high-performance retail and wholesale company. Three sales divisions celebrate jubilees in 2004: Media Markt and Saturn mark their 25th year in business, Metro Cash & Carry turns 40 and Galeria Kaufhof looks back on a 125-year company history. The METRO GROUP exhibition “Fascinating Worlds of Retail” attracts public attention with its exciting insights into the sector. The METRO GROUP further advances technological progress in commerce with the opening of its RFID Innovation Center in Neuss and the implementation of the forward-looking technology RFID.\n\n2005\n\nAs one of the world’s most internationally oriented wholesale and retail companies, the METRO GROUP continues its expansion course: the first Metro Cash & Carry wholesale outlet in Serbia and Montenegro opens its doors, Real enters the Russian market and Media Markt establishes a location in Greece, to name just of few of the company’s international activities. With the stock market listing of Praktiker in November, the METRO GROUP further concentrates its focus on its core business areas. The image of the METRO GROUP as an attractive employer is again confirmed in 2005. The proportion of trainees in its operations throughout Germany reaches an all-time high, at 8.3 percent. Even the very youngest are looked after: in September, the bilingual company kindergarten “Metro Sternchen” (Little Metro Stars) opens at the headquarters in Düsseldorf. With this daycare center, the METRO GROUP supports its staff in creating an ideal balance between family and career.\n\n2006\n\nIn its tenth anniversary year, METRO GROUP makes its first appearance at the CeBIT in Hanover. More than 120,000 trade fair visitors find out about the many possible uses of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) at the Future Store Initiative stand. To mark the anniversary, the METRO GROUP publishes the European Consumption Report – a Europe-wide study of consumer spending. In addition, the company runs the charity campaign “Koch mit” (Cook and help), to support the German charity “Die Tafel” (The Table) who provide food for those in need. The internationalization process also continues: MediaMarkt expands into Sweden and Russia, while Real enters the Romanian market. The takeovers of Wal-Mart Germany and the stores of French hypermarket chain Géant in Poland, also strengthen Real’s market position. In addition, the METRO GROUP further develops its purchasing strategy: the cross-national structure of MGBI (METRO GROUP Buying International), creates additional group-wide synergies in the area of goods procurement.\n\n2007\n\nThe METRO GROUP is continuing its international expansion. METRO Cash & Carryopened the first wholesale store in Pakistan and Media Markt entered the market in Turkey. The METRO GROUP is expanding its sales network in other countries as well. In Romania, Real will open its 14th Real hypermarket at the end of the year. With the comprehensive implementation of the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in Germany, the METRO GROUP ensures an even better supply chain efficiency. Deliveries are automatically registered at 180 locations ofMETRO Cash & Carry and Real as well as in the central warehouses of MGLMETRO GROUP Logistics. In order to help customers get a balanced diet, theMETRO GROUP is implementing nutrition facts for its own brands and is the first German retail company to do so. The company also sets an example regarding the balance between work and family. At the Düsseldorf location, the METRO GROUP opened its second bilingual company kindergarten called “METRO-Sternchen”. A personnel change took place at the top of the METRO GROUP. Dr Eckhard Cordes is the new CEO and replaces Dr Hans-Joachim Körber.\n\n2008\n\nMETRO GROUP continues to optimise its portfolio in 2008. After selling its 245 Extra supermarkets, the Group’s focus in food retail services will be on its Real hypermarkets. With its new real,- Future Store in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Toenisvorst, METRO GROUP lives up to its reputation as a driving force for the entire retail industry. Here, the Group tests state-of-the-art technologies and concepts that are set to shape the future of retail. The hypermarket of tomorrow proves a hit with consumers. Since its opening, sales have grown consistently.\n\nThe retailing company also continues to push forward with its expansion at an international level: Saturn opens its first consumer electronics stores in Greece and Luxembourg in 2008. This means that METRO GROUP is now present in 32 countries worldwide.\n\nMETRO GROUP is the first German retailing company to publish its carbon footprint and commit to reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases by 15 percent by 2015.METRO GROUP also takes its responsibility as an employer very seriously. Once again, more than 3,000 young people across Germany start their apprenticeships in the Group’s various companies. This makes METRO GROUP one of the largest training companies in Germany.\n\n2009\n\nMETRO GROUP kicks off 2009 with an efficiency and value enhancement programme. The aim of “Shape 2012” is to achieve maximum possible growth and customer orientation. The brand message that the company peresents in May hits the nail on the head: METRO GROUP is “Made to Trade.”\n\nOn the international stage, METRO GROUP continues its expansion programme.METRO Cash & Carry realises its market entry in Kazakhstan and Real opens its first hypermarket in the Ukraine.\n\nTwo sales brands have anniversaries in 2009. Galeria Kaufhof can look back on a 130-year history; Media Markt celebrates ist 30th birthday. In 2009, METRO GROUPgives more weight to the subject sustainability, making it an integral part of its corporate strategy by founding a Sustainability Committee.\n\nIn December the trading and retailing company announces its collaboration with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The joint programme aims to fight hunger in developing countries.\n\nThere are changes at the top at METRO GROUP. Thomas Unger is named vice-chairman of METRO AG. The Supervisory Board appoints Olaf Koch as CFO; he takes up his post on 14 September.\n\n2010\n\nIn March, the administrative functions of METRO AG and METRO Cash & Carry are pooled. The newly formed unit assumes key responsibilities for the whole Group. The Company’s remodelled public image and new logo underline the high importance of the cash & carry business.\n\nFrom May to October, the retail and wholesale group presents itself at the EXPO World’s Fair in Shanghai, which features the motto ‘Better City, Better Life’.METRO Cash & Carry and Media Markt form the centrepiece of the appearance.\n\nMETRO GROUP meets its customers’ expectations by introducing new sales formats.

Media Markt’s new online store offers customers in Germany even more flexibility when shopping: the online store.\n\n2013\n\nProf. Otto Beisheim, the founder of METRO Cash & Carry, dies at the age of 89.
