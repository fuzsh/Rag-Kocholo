News 3 During the first 7 months of the year, with shipments for 47,339 billion dollars, at a year-on-year average sales growth rate of 24%, around 14.000 Argentine exporting companies are leading our country towards a new record as regards exports. That effort must be consolidated by trade promotion organizations through a joint and collaborative work in accor- dance with productive development policies set forth by the National Government, with special focus on value chains and differentiated products of companies from each region of our country. Within this framework, it is highly important the trade promotion strategy designed by the Argentine Foreign Affairs Ministry, that along with the rest of the Ministries according to their specific sectoral competences, sets the referen- ce structure for actions, in a joint manner, that are carried out in order to position Argentine products and services worldwide. Right articulation between export promotion agents from diverse fields and regions, by universalizing commercial information and coordinating actions, is a fundamental stage for our work which resumes in a benefit not only for government actors but for local companies as well. In this sense, Fundación ExportAr works to carry out strategies agreed on with agencies and organizations aimed at fostering province and municipal exports, and also with the most representative chambers and institutions of the country, in order to become privileged partners within a federal framework, when it comes to bringing Argentine products and services worldwide. Just to mention a few examples that highlight the importance of organizing joint and coordinated actions, training activities stand out due to massive participation of Argentine companies in Expocruz Fair and the joint work that is being carried out towards the promotion of education services. • As regards training, and joint work with different regional agencies and institutions, through courses and semi- nars carried out along 14 Argentine provinces, 800 entrepreneurs have been trained, allowing coordination bet- ween organizers by combining the potential of selecting the best trainer according to a specific topic of interest for producers taking into account the profound knowledge of local organizations and the characteristics of the region. • In the case of Expocruz International Fair, held in Bolivia, a joint organization and a combination of finance sup- port from Fundación ExportAr, province and municipal organizations, binational and sectoral chambers, ProAr- gentina, Federal Investment Council, Improtur, and the Mining Secretariat of the nation, has allowed 228 Ar- gentine companies, coming from 11 provinces of the country, to participate in the most important multisectoral showroom of Latin America. • As regards actions developed to the positioning of education services abroad, 30 Argentine universities and edu- cation institutions have taken part in a dozen of sectoral actions worldwide. These activities, which could have not been possible to be organized without the support and cooperation from the Argentine diplomatic represen- tations abroad, are the result of a joint effort with the University Policies Secretariat of the Ministry of Education, and the synergy between different actors that allow to work on the one hand, with knowledge of the sectoral realities, and on the other, with regard to exports promotion and presence in foreign markets. In ExportAr we understand that the development of authentic synergies between government organizations, promo- tion agencies, institutions, chambers and companies, is fundamental when fostering the exporting performance of national SMEs and our commitment is to continue working in a joint and coordinated manner to unify efforts and increase the possibilities of Argentine companies.

It is a biennial Fair on its 31st edition and it is considered one of the biggest of the world for encompassing ten Fairs or specialized Pavilions under the same ceiling, dedicated to the world of beverages and food. Almost 300,000 square meters in the exhibition area and 150 pro- fessional visitors and over 6,500 exhibitors from around 100 coun- tries, make Anuga an interesting and attractive date for the pro- motion and commercialization of products at a professional level. Visitors will find monographic contests there. Anuga Fine Food, sector dedicated to gourmet and delicatessen products, Anuga Drinks, where all types of beverages will be exhibited, wines, non- alcoholic beverages, beers, spirituous drinks, liquors, etc. In Anuga Meat, attendants will find a big window dedicated to meat pro- ducts and by-products. In Anuga Frozen Food, the star foods will be frozen ones, Anuga Chilled & Fresh Food offers a wide space regarding last edition, dedicated exclusively to fresh products, such as vegetables, fruits, cold meat products, and fish, among others. The exhibiting area of Anuga Dairy is the sector for dairy and by- products, Anuga Bread & Bakery, Hot Beverages is the section dedicated to hot beverages and patisserie and bakery, in Anuga Organic the name speaks for itself, ecologic foods and products, this is one of the spaces that capture most attention of German professional visitors. In Anuga Retail Tec the technological equip- ment and services for retail sales will be exposed. The tenth Pavi- lion is Anuga Food Service, a place established for technological applications for the world of foods and beverages, this sector also encompasses services and products for catering and restoration. Likewise, during the exhibition, the last trends in markets that are becoming stronger will be exhibited, that’s why it’s not surprising to see an area for white brands (own brands). Also, Halal foods will be exhibited, the so-called functional foods, selected gourmet products, regional specialties and exclusive foods for vegetarians, among others. Anuga 2011 will have an international business platform, a space enabled to facilitate business transactions, tasting and presenta- tion of new products. Given the fact that 80% of exhibitors do not come from Germany, the Fair becomes very international. Together with the most im- portant European producing countries, during the last years, the number of participants coming from Latin America has increased continuously. According to the organizers themselves, Brazil, Ar- gentina and even Mexico are the Latin American countries with more presence. Anuga2011 A unique concept and a mandatory date for 150,000 visitors Colonia, Germany 8th-12th October Food and Beverages. 6 News\n\n7. News 7 The concept of business Fair and the program that supports it are designed in line with the products and needs of the sector of foods and beverages coinciding with those of the companies. The con- cept behind Anuga, introduced in 2003 and developed since then, is unique and is designed to harmonize the needs of exhibitors and visitors with those of the sector, producing a synergy that does not take place anywhere else. The event introduces the last trends of the sector. All products and relevant concepts are present and it is only open for professionals of the industry, where the purchasing power of visitors is the hig- hest to be expected at a Fair. Argentine Participation Fundación Exportar and the Argentine Ministry of Agriculture, Li- vestock and Fisheries, through the Promotion Project of Exports of Argentine Agrofoods (PROARGEX) organize the National Pavilion in the Fine sector, in Frozen Food and Bread and Bakery, in which around 60 exporting firms will participate. FINE FOOD: In this sector, companies show their most traditional products, such as dried fruits, wines, cereals, pulses (beans, peas, lentils, chickpeas), oils (olive, sunflower, soy), popcorn, peanut, to- matoes (tinned, paste) flours, pastas, powder milk, olives, prunes, raisins, tea, clear soups, stocks, instant mashed potatoes, candies and lemon juice. BREAD AND BAKERY: The products exhibited in this sector are ho- ney (liquid, solid, monofloral, polyfloral), honey mustard, confec- tioner sunflower, tea (herbs, fruits and flower flavors), coffee in all its presentations (ground, bags, instantaneous), sweetener, yerba mate in big bags or tea bags, spices, condiments, dulce de leche (caramel), cookies and crackers. FROZEN FOOD: The newest section, where products such as cooked beef, cakes, croissants, bread products, sweet corn, peas, spinach, mix of vegetables, potatoes, strawberries, all of them frozen. The magnitude and characteristics of Anuga generate an opportunity for companies to establish contacts that will be deve- loped in the medium and long term with an important sustaina- bility level. The participation of said companies in the previous edition left ex- cellent results and made entrepreneurs highlight the importance of being present due to the quantity and quality of international exhibitors and visitors. 7News\n\n8. 8 News Germany presents the economic structure of a highly developed country, where agriculture plays a small role in the GDP. The industrial sector is in comparison much more important than in other countries, but it is also losing importance compared to the services sector, both in occupation as well as generation of added value. The primary German sector (agriculture, livestock, fisheries) generates around 2.4% of the GDP. The national production can cover approximately 80% of the domestic consumption needs; the rest is covered with imports. The main crop is the cereal, highlighting wheat, rye and barley; right after, comes forage plants and oilseeds. The industrial sector, mining industry, construction and water supply and energy are grouped in the German statistics under the name of production sector (Produzieren des Gewerbe). Its main characteristics are high productivity, predominance of small and medium enterprise and the strong orientation towards external markets. By activity branches the main importance corresponds to the most classic industries like automobile, chemical sector, machinery, electronic and electrical technology. Among other industries at the peak, biotechnology can also be highlighted. It’s worth mentioning that the main virtue of the German industry lays probably in the capacity to apply most modern technologies to most classic products. The industrial sector in general and energy in particular has been determined in the last few years by saving needs and environmental standards. This can be translated in an ever- increasing taxation of fossil fuels and the limitation in the rights for emission of gas with greenhouse effect. On the other hand, the use of renewable energies is being fostered for which very cheap instruments have been created at the same time that the research of these energies is subsidized. Business exchange The international trade of Germany is one of the most outstanding ones in the world, only exceeded by United States and China. In 2010 its exports to all destinations reached records of 1, 27 billion dollars while its imports exceeded 1, 06 billions. Regarding sales, most part of them, 60% are sold to countries within the UE, this is common for member countries, although in most of them the percentage is 70%. Among third countries to which Germany sells, we can find United States and Eastern European countries. By products, the great concentration of industrial goods is at the center, among them, items of high added value. However, the German export is much diversified. The geographic distribution of international purchases is similar to that of exports. The progression of imports from old Eastern Countries calls the attention, as well as the progression registered in the commerce with China. On the contrary, purchases from Southeast Asia are comparatively less important. Regarding bilateral exchange with Argentina, it’s worth pointing out that Germany is currently the seventh destination of our sales in importance. Argentine exports towards that country reached amounts of 1,832 billion dollars in 2010, experiencing Anuga2011 8 News\n\n9. News 9 an outstanding performance in the last years, with increases of +31.7% during the period (2009-2010) and of +35.2% during the first semester of 2011. The main exported item is the mineral of copper, which in 2010 represented 24% of all sales to Germany. However, there are many food products that stand out among exports. The most important ones are Meats, with sales of 350 million dollars in the last year, Honey, Fresh Fruits and Wines. Marketing and Logistics There are numerous channels in the destination country, which vary according to the different sectors. However, in general it is possible to have agents or distributors, who act as retailers, wholesalers and importers. The mentioned agents usually resort to agency and distribution agreements and impose exclusivity and competition clauses. Other exporters prefer to avoid intermediaries and resort to options like joint venture, franchises or licenses, or simply establish their own offices in the target destination. In the same way, other links of the distribution chain are e-commerce and phone sales for most consumption products, widely spread among the German population. The available access network for logistics in Germany is very good; in fact, it has the 7th biggest airport in the world, Frankfurt, and a great range of sea and air services. It’s worth pointing out that its airports, in general, are connected to the rest of the cities by a wide network of highways and railroads that speed up the delivery of goods. In general, the offer Germanmarket of services allows for all types of loading transport, although there are some difficulties for bulk cargo transports. Due to its strategic location, Germany has a wide and modern port infrastructure, with over 60 ports and auxiliary subports, open to manage loads. At the same time, it has over 18 airports with customs facilities, and they have an infrastructure for the administration and storage of loads, including cold storage and protection of valuables. Keys for a successful negotiation The business culture in Germany stands out mainly because of its formality, therefore it is extremely important to wear proper clothing for a business meeting, be very formal in the treatment and careful not to interrupt the speaker. It is also advisable to have printed information available or brochures about the company and/or the products offered. Other aspects to keep in mind are punctuality and neatness, trying to organize meetings many weeks ahead of time and during them limit following the agenda agreed as well as strictly keeping the times scheduled for the meetings. 9News\n\n10. 10 News What are the main responsibilities of the Undersecretariat of Ameri- can Economic Integration and MERCOSUR? The Undersecretariat of American Economic Integration and MERCOSUR, is carrying out the insertion of Argentina in the global economic scene, through commercial exchanges and economic agreements with the countries that integrate the American continent, putting special emphasis on MERCOSUR. The main objective is to intensify the presence of Argentine products in existing economic markets, and of course work to create new opportunities. Therefore, it is very important to have a constant and direct contact with our businessmen. Regarding the region, how do you characterize the current economic and integration scenario? I think that since the Administration of Néstor Kirchner and Lula da Silva there was a strong momentum to integrate and develop in the region that went hand in hand with progressive governments, which makes Latin America to have a strategic opportunity and to have abandoned the submission to any other dominant power. At MERCOSUR level, our priority is to perfect the Customs Union and consolidate the Common Fo- reign Fee. We work assuming the asymmetries that exist within the region, the gaps to the interior of each one of the countries, to obtain clear standards for all the partners and generate the highest possible balances. Regarding Argentina in particular, our President has always defended balanced commerce and a better distribution of globalization benefits. It is paramount to keep building an inclusive MERCOSUR, with developed regio- nal economies, common social policies and putting emphasis on infrastructure, energetic integration and education. Interview | Ambassador José Vitar So keeping in mind what you are telling us, has this last period been one of the most productive ones as far as international relations for Argentina? We have a government that has a very clear concept of regio- nal and Latin American identity, and that has chosen an inser- tion model linked to MERCOSUR and the region, our country has never been more integrated to South America before. The relationship with Brazil is strategic and paramount; it is our main market and natural partner. We must jointly organize and execute business promotion actions and programs. But the re- lationship with other South American countries is also para- mount, for instance the relationship with Chile, with which we have a plan to develop bioceanic connectors that will connect the region horizontally. Today, Argentina has a relationship with the rest of the world that it had never imagined before: presidential visits, business missions, participation in internatio- nal organizations, presence in the G20 and the presidency of the country in the G77 show that high insertion degree of our country in the current international framework. In case of adding Venezuela, how can that fact change, for instance, the relationship with the United States? With Venezuela, the MERCOSUR for us will be a true food power, since our countries are among the main food expor- ters of the planet. But, the incorporation of Venezuela to the MERCOSUR will allow, above all, converting MERCOSUR in an energetic power, something requested constantly by the world. With the United States we want a mature and respect- ful relationship, but we don’t share the action approach of some countries of the region that sign Free Trade Agreement with the United States, which complicates the integration and keeps Latin American countries in a subordinated situation. The region currently has a new opportunity to reverse certain historic conditioning factors, and position ourselves as a bloc with great quality and quantity of natural resources, and we should take advantage of these. We must build an inclusiveMERCOSUR 10 News Fundación Exportar spoke with Ambassador José Vitar, Undersecretary of the American Economic Integration and MERCOSUR, and he explained the main responsibilities of his area.\n\n11. News 11 How can the consolidation of UNASUR modify MERCOSUR objec- tives? Latin American integration and development must be carried out taking advantage of all the organizations and tools that the situation offers us. The UNASUR has a previous version in the South American Community of Nations, and from its start it was clear that the idea was to work in line and in a comple- mentary manner with the existing organizations. In one of the first meetings to debate this great regional endeavor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, being a national Senator at that time, debated with her colleagues Marco Aurelio García, from Brazil and the former Chilean Ambassador Luis María, for instance, about the importance of working together in infrastructure, energy, social inclusion and education. There is also the ALADI (Latin American Association for Integra- tion), which had been somewhat negligent during the past but has been given strong momentum appointing Chacho Álvarez as General Secretary. This is a very important organization at a regional level since almost all Latin American countries are in it, and the incorporation of Panama and Nicaragua is currently being analyzed and approved. Therefore, these three organiza- tions shall jointly foster our region, open new negotiation and business opportunities, with balanced and inclusive standards for all member countries. Talking about national economy, last month, a Delegation led by you and other Ambassadors of the Chancellery, went to Tucuman, what were the objectives of said trip? The idea is that the Chancellery will not only act in the diplo- macy sphere but that will also bring tools to entrepreneurs, in this particular case the Undersecretary of American Economic Integration and MERCOSUR. Provinces and regional econo- mies must access the markets with increased productions. The idea was to carry out a working day with different speeches given by Ambassadors and Ministers. Then, each one of them, with the members of their teams, gathered in different wor- king tables to learn deeply about topics interesting for local businessmen and that could be included in the working agen- da of the Undersecretariat. Is the Undersecretariat planning on continuing these trips throug- hout the country under this same dynamic? We are planning on going to the Argentine Northwest and adding provinces like Entre Rios. From the Undersecretariat we believe that speaking with businessmen is not only possible but also necessary, a mechanism through which they tell us their problems and needs of their business models so that Chance- llery will be able to generate the necessary diplomatic relation- ships, under the presidential mandate that Argentine exports play an important role. As a conclusion which do you think is the international economic task that Argentina must work on? It’s paramount to keep strengthening MERCOSUR, favoring balances, assisting the industry and widening markets. In a multipolar world, Argentina must continue being an intelli- gent actor, reindustrializing and adding value to its exports, for which the bilateral relationship with Brazil should be stronger; but without setting aside social justice, equality and building fairer societies.

The company Owoko, of children’s clothing closed an important business: they will open a store in Bogota. The twenty-second edition of Colombia Moda took place in the Center of Conventions Plaza Mayor in Medellin, Colombia. This fair groups the international supply of the industry, being the most important event of Latin America for professionals of the sector. Colombia Moda takes places annually and is conceived as an international exhibition platform for all actors of the textile sec- tor: clothing industry, distribution channels and other relevant products for design and fashion. In this opportunity, the Fair reached a total of 1,415 international buyers, from 51 countries and a total of 9,428 visitors. Among those who visited the Fair stood out Portugal, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Arab Emirates, Italy, France, Spain, Great Britain, Japan, Australia, Germany, Canada, Morocco and Tunisia. Likewise, important groups of specialized buyers participated such as boutiques and showrooms. Fundación ExportAr, together with UPAEX and the Metropolitan Center of Design of the City of Buenos Aires, participated with a stand of 100 square meters, distributed in 4 sectored Argen- tine Pavilions, together with designers selected by the Director of Marketing, Clara Hernríquez.

Promotion of Services | Colombia Moda ArgentineDesigners make a difference inColombiaModa 12 News\n\n13. News 13 Colombia Moda turned out to be a good market for Argentine businessmen, who, were able to make a difference before their competitors due to the quality of their products and added value of the design. The general opinion of those who participated in the stand was that the Fair turned out to be a great opportunity to promote their products in the international fashion market, which has shown constant growth in the last few years. The in- sertion of new products is at the peak, contrary to what is hap- pening in the European market. Starting from a more democratic concept of what fashion is and from acknowledging the diversity in the sector, Inexmoda de- cided to renew and redesign the structure of Colombia Moda reinforcing its commercial aspect and adding the sector “New Business and Franchises”, where Owoko, Cheeky, Grisino, Narci- so Underwear, Mimo and Chibel, were able to offer their franchi- sing projects through meetings. There was a success story there since Owoko will be opening a store in the city of Bogota. Among the gathered data in the fair, it is worth pointing out that there were 3,759 national buyers and 3,786 national visitors. The total of visitors was 8,013 people, while there was a record of 709 independent buyers and 1,415 foreign people visited the fair. The total number of people that entered the fair was 9,428, according to what organizers registered. Regarding the business balance, according to organizers of the Fair, 92% of these buyers declared to be satisfied with Colombia Moda and did businesses. Likewise, for 35% of them it was their first experience in the Fair. One of the Argentine businessmen who participated in the fair, Enzo Lo Valvo, from Owoko, expressed the following: “The ex- perience in Colombia was interesting, in order to generate inter- national contacts and get to know the market. There are some specific aspects of each market that we can only learn by being present and doing fieldwork. In that sense the participation in the fair is very useful, since there are countless different brands and industries, and you can get a very good idea of what the local market is”. The businessman wanted to highlight “the management and permanent assistance of Fundación ExportAr and the Chance- llery, since they were with us at all time, solving whatever conflict arose”. Regarding the history of the company, Lo Valvo indicated: “Owoko was born as a brand in January of 2004, in an interna- tional children’s fashion fair in Spain (www.fimi.com.es). In Octo- ber of that year we opened our first store in Palermo. Nowadays we have presence in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay with fran- chises and in Chile, Italy, Spain and Slovenia in local multi-brands stores”. As an important piece of information regarding the participation of Owoko in the Colombian fair, it’s worth pointing out that this was an opportunity for them to close an important business: the opening of a franchised store in that country. Although the con- versations had started before the event, it was closed at the fair. 13News\n\n14. Narciso overcame a great challenge One of the Argentine companies that attended Colombia Moda and came back very satisfied due to their achievements in the event was Narciso Underwear, an innovating company that does lingerie. Although in the host country and in Venezuela there is great development of this industry, since the market is very demanding regarding quality and variety, Narciso trusted their product and went there with the intention of conquering new markets. The result was great, according to what Sabina Tolaba told us. “It was actually a very good experience from the commercial perspective and any other aspect. We were somewhat hesitant taking into account that our industry, lingerie, is very strong in Colombia. But being there and carrying out a market research, we were able to identify the advantages of our product compared to the more relevant products and brands known in that country, and that encouraged us more to continue with our participation”, indicated Sabina. Regarding the fair in particular, the representative of Narciso said: “We had good space to show our product. Our brand is particularly characterized by the variety of designs and colors, which we had to highlight when bringing our brand to other countries. In previous fairs, where, we had the chance to participate through Fundación ExportAr (for instance, in Panama) we have earned a lot of experience in order to have solid foundations. Therefore, we armed ourselves with tools such as banners, flyers, promotion material, dummies, decoration, and exhibitors, trying to obtain the same concept of our stores and take it into a stand. The result was naturally derived from all this: we had the presence of potential customers from different parts of the world, such as Costa Rica, Spain, Ecuador, Peru, among others. They showed great interest in the acquisition of our product, since upon seeing them they were able to identify what they were lacking in their own markets. We are talking about companies that have been around over ten years in the lingerie business, and who, upon seeing and analyzing Narciso’s products, focused on niche markets that they hadn’t considered before. Therefore, we put special emphasis on those aspects that the market has nowadays left aside and we were able to point out the ways to recover them, and take advantage of the benefit that this industry might represent to them”. “So we are working precisely on the database of potential customers, trying to generate results with the contacts that we have identified and creating business opportunities that might be carried out, depending on the need of each one of them”, added Tolaba, who also highlighted “the great work done by the Chancellery and the assistance of Fundación ExportAr”. “One of our advantages, that we cannot forget to mention, was being able to give product samples to potential customers. That guarantees, in the first place, that we’ll be able to take the second step with them. The fact that they have the end product in their hands and they can feel it and try it on is a tool that we also use to captivate our customer. We were able to give out a lot for that purpose in this fair”, Sabina concluded, and she did not hide her eagerness to keep participating in this and other International Fairs with the intention of enlarging the markets of Narciso. “We feel like we have more and more tools and a better preparation to attend these events”, she pointed out. They weren’t sure about participating because they thought it would be very difficult to sell lingerie in a market where the industry is very developed, but they did great and seduced buyers with their original and colorful designs.

Quality, innovation, originality… those are some of the attributes of Ruma, a company that was born in early 2003 to produce “hau- te-couture shoes”. María Giannone, designer, coordinator and owner of the company, has come back very excited after her par- ticipation in Colombia Moda, where she went with the assistan- ce of ExportAr. The “customized” shoes they make attracted the interest of buyers from the United States, Ecuador, Peru, Puerto Rico, among others. What do you mean by “personalized” shoes? María explains it like this: “A woman should have the proper hair and the proper shoes, my mom used to say and that’s the leitmotiv of my professional career. That’s why I grew up with customized shoes, ever since I was little”. How was the company born? Ruma shoes were created from the need of doing a different pro- duct for today’s women. It’s a brand that worried and took care of design from the very beginning, as well as the quality and dura- bility of their pieces, turning them into exclusive and personalized designs for each person who came to Ruma. Why did you get involved in this industry? I made incursions in the fashion world learning from the best social photographers, the publishing production and the artistic make up. The roots helped me learn deeply about this art. My grand- mother designed wedding dresses and my mother embroidered trousseaus. “A woman must have the proper hair and the proper shoes”, that was my mom’s motto and is the leitmotiv of my pro- fessional career. That is why I grew up with customized shoes, ever since I was little. It is cultural, it is tradition, and it is life. What characterizes Ruma? Ruma is characterized by designs that are extremely feminine, fancy and with their unique twist, using the seeding technique. Thanks to our craftsmen’s labor we manage to revalue craftwork, recreating true pieces of Haute Couture in shoes. That is why we are pioneers; nobody has done Haute couture in shoes before. Can you explain the seeding technique? Seeding is the technique that craftsmen use when making the shoes. The seed is a small lead nail to be clinched between the insole and the panel of the shoetree. What goals have you met up to now? During the past few years, we have met some very significant goals for us. We have been invited by haute couture designers to share the runway, as well as different places like: movies, theater and TV. Ruma shoes have been recently invited again to be the brand of BAAM 35 Argentina Fashion Week. Which TV show are you currently working with? We are pleased to be making shoes for the characters played by Leticia Brédice, Mónica Antonópulos, Paula Kohan, Calu Rivero and María Carámbula, among others, of the daily TV show “El Elegido” in Telefé channel. What are Ruma’s immediate projects? One of our projects is to expand Ruma in the interior of the coun- try and abroad. Here I want to share our experience in Colombia Moda 2011, since we were able to show what we do in Argentina in other country and to other places. Ruma is the first brand that was incorporated in the world of Swarosvki Elements Partners, achieving products of excellence. How was the experience in Colombia? It was great to see how people came to the stand of Argentine Leather Goods Design, where five brands with very different styles co- habitated. In Ruma we received potential buyers from countries such as the United States, Ecuador, Peru and Puerto Rico among others. I can tell you, in my case in particular, we had visits from haute couture designers, image consultants from Bogota and the head of sales from a well-known store chain from Guayaquil, among others. We hope to see this new experience reflected in the next months in new businesses. Ruma, customized shoes Due to design creativity and production perfection, Ruma shoes made an excellent impression in Colombia Moda and awakened the interest of buyers from the United States, Ecuador, Peru and Puerto Rico, among other countries. 15News\n\n16. 16 News Around twenty food companies from the province of Buenos Aires closed businesses with their Colombian counterparts in a commercial mission to Bogota. Companies had the support, both technically and economically, from the province, and the mission was organized together by the Ministry of Production, the Minis- try of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries of the country, through the Project for the Promotion of Exports of Agri Argentinos (PROARGEX) and Fundación ExporAr. According to what the Minister of the provincial Production ex- plained, “nowadays Buenos Aires has what it takes to be one of the main food suppliers in the world, with high quality and great added value and, in the case of this mission, many businessmen already contacted Colombian distributing chains and many have started certification processes to position their products”. Minister Martín Ferré explained “from our side we are developing a plan for services and activities for the production sector, fostering com- petitive insertion of the Province in international markets”. The commercial mission was led by the Undersecretary of Interna- tional Economic Relations of the provincial production portfolio, Bruno Tomaselli, and had the participation of around twenty food companies from Quilmes, Tandil, Coronel Dorrego, Tornquist, Es- cobar, San Isidro, Vicente Lopez, Bahia Blanca, Lomas de Zamora, La Matanza and La Plata, and took part in about 120 business meetings with their local counterparts. The Argentine Ambassador in Colombia, Martín Balza, greeted members of the mission. There was a breakfast event in which the Ambassador spoke about the economic, political and social situation of the country and he put special emphasis on every single sector involved in the business trip. Among the ones with most notable presence, we can mention Havanna, Oligra, Cagnoli, Biolive, Bodegas Sadungarav, Barba Successful multisectoral commercial mission to Colombia Over 20 companies from the province of Buenos Aires participated in the encounter organized together by the Ministry of Provincial Production, PROARGEX and ExportAr.

Among the products offered, there were beef, oils, alfajores, cookies, fruit preserves, tomatoes, legumes, sweets, marmalades, jams, dairy products, whey powder, tea, in- fusions and premium and gourmet products, even craft beer, high quality wines, and sausages. Tomaselli indicated, “one of our strategic goals is to increase the commercial flow of the Province with the Latin American country, that’s why we have given our businessmen concrete tools that accompany the expansion of the exporting sector such as techni- cal, logistic and economic assistance. We want businessmen from our Province to be able to position their products in this country and to be aware of the benefits of the Colombian market. The Province has exported almost 420 million dollars FOB in 2010 to Colombia and this value has been growing year after year”. Business negotiations Among the mission results, we can highlight those from Agroin- dustria Madero S.A from La Matanza, producer of vegetal pro- teins and extraction of oils that closed a long agenda of business meetings with big importers from Bogota, such as Carrefour Co- lombia, the National Federation of Colombian Poultry Farmers, Grupo Casino and others who were interested in grain corn, oils and premixes. The same happened with Bodegas Saldungaray from Tornquist. REDEPA S.A from Lavallol, producer of preserves and sweets, met with importers who talked about their intention to buy about 20 containers. Also with the intention to close a proposal to export in the short term, suggested by the Colombian company PROA LTDA, repre- sentatives of Cagnoli S.A, producer of cold meat and sausages from Tandil, visited the INVIMA (National Colombian Institution for the Control of Medicine and Foods) in order to start the ne- cessary process of certification to enter their goods. “I’m very sa- tisfied with the Business Mission and I came back to Buenos Aires very happy. The meetings actually exceeded my expectations”, pointed out Nicolás Bassi, the owner. On his part, the head of the International Network Havanna, Ma- nuel García Cuerva, said, “we participated in this Business Mission and it is the first time that we do it through the Undersecretariat of International Economic Relations of the Ministry of Production. We were very satisfied with the results. I consider that thanks to the Province we will be able to sell to the Colombian market an Argentine product produced 100% in Buenos Aires”. The Colombian Market Colombia is one of the natural partners of the Argentine Repu- blic. In 2010, Argentine sales towards Colombia reached 1269.7 dollars. From that total, the production from the province of Bue- nos Aires represented 33%, therefore, that country was positio- ned among the first 10 commercial partners of the Province. This market is the recipient of the most elaborated products, characteristic evidenced by seeing that 49.11% of the exported goods are composed of products of Industrial Manufactured Ori- gin. Between 2009 and 2010, there was growth in the exports of the Provinces to Colombia of 26%, resulting in accumulative increase 2005-2010 of 107%. 17News\n\n18. 18 News What tasks do you perform to improve food quality? The National Service of Agrifood Health and Quality (SENASA) is a decentralized agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries. Its mission is to implement policies regarding health and quality of animals and vegetables towards the agriculture sector for the production of safe food for human and animal consumption. It is also under its scope to maintain and improve animal and vegeta- ble health, control federal traffic, imports and exports of products, subproducts, and derivatives or animal and vegetable origin, agri- food, pharmaceutical-veterinary, agrochemicals, and fertilizers products. In this regard, it designs, organizes, and executes rules, programs and specific plans that regulate production towards safe foods for human and animal consumption. Our work is crucial to maximize the management of competitiveness of value chains that make up national production and agroindustry. What controls are being implemented? There are many and different controls according to different fields. SENASA controls federal traffic, imports and exports of products, subproducts, and derivatives or animal and vegetable origin, agri- food, pharmaceutical-veterinary, agrochemicals, and fertilizers products. Controls are applied by national directorates and regio- nal centers. Given the role of Argentina as one of the principal producers of safe and quality food in the world, SENASA works actively to satis- fy the demand of its functions adapting its institutional capacity by strengthening its vast technical network and support services for the national agriculture production, which is reflected on the near 5000 agents working in different areas throughout the country, the creation of the National Laboratory Network – integrated by more than 400 authorised public and private laboratories, own la- boratories and regional experimental fields, integrally coordinated by the General Directorate of Laboratories and Technical Control, digital connection of all regions by taking advantage of new com- munication and information technologies, provision of equipment and automobiles to perform the full exercise of its duties. What is the role SENASA performs when going to fairs with ExportAr? During 2011, SENASA participates in many international fairs and exhibitions worldwide with the purpose of giving assistance to ex- porters and importers on health food requirements imposed by the Argentine Republic. Likewise, the agency widens its regional vision while attending these international events and furthering its main goal that is to strengthen the role of the State as regards animal and vegetable health, food safety, and protection of the environment. Definite insertion of Argentina in the international food market and due attention to the domestic market applying similar requi- rements to those of foreign markets, depend on the adoption of modern trends in food quality and its institutional designs. This is what we disseminate in international fairs. How do you coordinate tasks with different sanitary control agenciesfromothercountriestofacilitatetheexportofourproducts to international markets? SENASA carries out, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, Li- vestock and Fisheries and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Interna- tional Trade and Worship, the steps to maintain the markets of agrifood products for our country and to further new destinations. Within this framework, we receive auditing missions to verify pro- duction systems in our country and the control SENASA exercises SENASA,sanitarycontrol istheorderoftheday SENASA is the national service of agrifood health and quality that permits our country to produce safe foods, fit for human and animal consumption, at local and international levels as well. In the last couple of years, it has undergone an important regionalization and operational decentralization process that turn to be key in order to efficiently accomplish its role. Dr. Jorge Amaya, President of the agency for around eight years, highlights the importance of said changes and makes a balance Interview | Jorge Amaya 18 News\n\n19. News 19 over them. Our agency is responsible for establishing, together with sanitary services from buyer countries, sanitary protocols that export products of animal and vegetable origin must meet. What are the different areas of SENASA? SENASA is organized under a Directive Board made up by the Pre- sident, Vice President and General Manager, and different perfor- ming units organized under national directorates, directorates and coordination divisions divided according to fields of competence such as animal and vegetable health, food safety, agrochemicals, veterinary products and foods for human and animal consump- tion, laboratory and technical control. Since 2003, SENASA started a transformation process which inclu- ded its institutional stabilization, regionalization and operational decentralization, computerizing its offices and permanent training of staff, thereby consolidating this new organization structure. Our agency has to be continuously under a training process. SENASA’s 14 regional centers, created since 2006, allow that the decision making process be adopted at regional and local levels, where sanitary events occur, information is produced and have operational capacity. Likewise, there are centralized tasks such as standardization, coor- dination and management control of regional and local units. On the other hand, the National Directorate of Regional Opera- tions (DNOR, in Spanish), coordinates the performance and execu- tion of programs, plans and activities of each one of the national directorates with competence in each field, in the framework of each one of the 14 regional centers distributed throughout the country. How do you implement controls for agrifood safety? It depends on the production, if its animal or vegetable there are established control systems that are audited by buyer countries many times a year making sure that said products are of quality and harmless to human and animal health. To that extent we rely on the work of national directorates and the 14 regional centers which are decentralized, and facilitate the work at the same loca- tion where agrifood is being produced. In addition, we perform controls on routes where we verify that the cargo loaded complies with the requirements and legislation in force and, in case of any irregular situation the merchandise is confiscated and destroyed. In the last years, what have been the rules that have allowed the access of our exports to new markets? Actually there is not a specific rule, however we work with sanitary protocols from the countries that demand our products and, in those cases in which there is not an established protocol, we de- sign it together with the country of destination. That is what has recently happened with China, for instance, with different animal and vegetable products we have started to export to that country. Argentina, for the time being, has more open markets than ever in its history. At world level, there is a guarantee that our control systems are good. This year in June a new National Reference Laboratory was opened, what does this accomplishment mean for SENASA? The laboratory demanded an investment of 20 million dollars from the ProSap, a program of the Ministry of Agriculture, and it has been a demand from the sector for over 30 years. It is located at the city of Martinez, in the province of Buenos Aires, and it is an example, at international level, since it is among the first five laboratories of the world. 19News\n\n20. 20 News In addition, it provides another level of prevalence throughout the country and, to accomplish this we have the support from the Na- tional Government and the Minister of Agriculture. Though the laboratory is managed by SENASA, it serves the enti- re country because we work jointly with the CEBASEV, INTA and CONICET. When we took over the politic leadership of SENASA, the same people of the agency demanded building this reality we are living today. And we are proud to say that having acted accordingly is the best thing we could have done. How do you feel the agency has evolved under your management? Currently, it is going to be eight years of management, and I think there has been a great support from the political system; our ac- tions have been strongly backed. Formerly, SENASA was managed only with the collection of fees (for its services); until the State decided that a sanitary control agency should have a strong con- tribution from the treasury. From a budget of 130 million pesos in 2004, we currently have a budget of more than 1,000 billion pesos. On the other hand, an agency such as ours that was regarded as the sanitary police used to have an Administration Board made up by the same corporations we were supposed to have control over. That has been a major contradiction. Nowadays, there is an Ad- visor Council, but it does participate neither in the administration nor in the definition of policies for SENASA. That was an important advance. Also it has been very significant the issue of training. On the other hand, there has been a new decree establishing the new organi- zation structure of SENASA and that created a new directorate: Operation Directorate that deals with regions. Thus, SENASA has been modified in a positive way. Regionalization started in 2006 and the last region created was a year and a half ago. It is also important to highlight the purpose of SENASA, its funda- mental role as a quality control agency of agrifood, not only for our people but for exporting as well. We believe that we have im- proved a lot, earlier each emergency was a chaotic situation, and today we have enough funds to cope with our duties. The problem is not that any disease enters the country, or any other sanitary problem, what everybody is looking at is our country’s capacity to respond before an emergency. Today we are in good conditions to do so. 20 News Interview | Jorge Amaya\n\n21.

Under the agreement between Fundación ExportAr and Senasa, a decentralized organization of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries of the nation, during 2011 Senasa will participate in different fairs and exhibitions at national and international levels, to give advice to agrifood exporters and importers about phytos- anitary requirements that the Argentine Republic and buyer countries demand of said products. It is very common for the Senasa to show its activities in different national fairs. With this agreement the au- thorities of this organization decided to widen the scope and participate in well known international exhibitions related to the agrifood industry and contribute to the development of the international trade for these products. The purpose of this agreement between the two organizations is to implement the necessary means and actions to reach a mutual technical complementation and carry out in a coordinated way projects in areas of mutual interest, working in cooperation through different activities. To this regard, the Senasa and Fundación ExportAr jointly assist to the small and medium agrifood exporter abroad, as well as boosting imports, in matters related to quality and health in agrifood. This joint work permits to collaborate in the design of the necessary conditions for the development of actions towards the fulfilment of the policies set forth by the national government as regards exports. Thus the Senasa widens its regional scope by participating at these international meetings, adapting and accom- panying its main goal that is to strengthen the role of the state on animal and vegetable health, food safety and environment care.\n\n22. 22 News What is the mission of the Association?

The Ministry of Industry works very well towards that end. Deficit cannot be fixed overnight, but if we increase 3 points every year it is very important. We want to accept the challenge the model proposes: bet towards a country with more added value in exports. That is a political decision of AIERA, based on a real situa- tion. As regards this, we are already thinking to propose a course so the provinces can be incorporated to added value exports. This is something we owe to the society: that provinces be at a same level. We believe that export with greater added value and a balan- ced production system and trade will make our country continue growing and that society improves more and more its level of life. We strongly believe that we can have a better country, with ba- lance and equity. What are the main activities of the Association? In AIERA we have a certain amount of partners and give advice to entrepreneurs of SMEs seeking markets, to do so we count with the support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Fundación ExportAr. We have a consulting department available for all entre- preneurs, whether members or not. As regards training, how do you work? Regarding training we have a division for training entrepreneurs. For more than 22 years we have been offering an intensive cour- se in international trade, that it is always updated. There are two modalities of the course: conventional classroom classes 4 times a year, and distance classes 8 times a year. We also have seminars about the latest regulations in force. What are other services you provide for entrepreneurs? We issue certificates of origin that state the product is made in Argentina and comes from Argentina. We are one of the 4 or 5 entities that issue certificates highly appreciated by companies. We also take on the defense of union actions for the sector. If there is a problem or there is something wrong we demand a modification. What is your opinion about the current economic model? We really agree with the model which has been implemented in recent years and believe that added value to exports generates a better distribution of income and a wider demand of highly skilled workforce. So employment increases and makes the country grow. We think when there is greater added value the society’s level of life improves. This makes the country richer, in the broadest sense of the term. What is your analysis about the current moment of the economy? I think SMEs are having a great moment. For many years I have not sensed a moment like this. Exports are growing steadily. We have to be aware of the crisis going on in those countries we traditio- nally export to. We are suggesting entrepreneurs to start focusing on emerging markets, where 80 percent of the growth has taken place in the last four years, such as BRIC and Eastern countries. Do you think the European and American crisis will have an impact in our country? I do not think it will affect us profoundly because the current eco- nomic model is aimed at developing the domestic market. We strongly support this model. I think we are well prepared with re- serves and trade surplus and fiscal surplus as well. We are neither indebted at the figures we were before nor are we dependent on international lending bodies, all which is very good. And I think we have a good defense. Now is up to entrepreneurs to react and start seeking other non-traditional markets. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that delegations and commercial missions are departing to BRICs and Eastern countries. If there is support, entrepreneurs wishing to grow and have more profits, will take advantage of this support. There are some unshakeable figures from the real life: for instan- ce, in 2002 we had half the production apparatus without any demand. Nowadays 85 percent of the production is working. Of course, we have to take provisions to continue growing. Inves- tment is also necessary too. We have to go out and seek new markets without neglecting the old ones. The support from the State is there and entrepreneurs are taking advantage of it. They should also take some risks in investments. Do you think that the current regional economic situation makes us more competitive? The exchange rate is pretty good. Our neighbors are appreciating their currencies. We are in a mix that makes us become competi- tive. Small devaluations allow us to be better. We do believe it is necessary to introduce some modifications related to the financial system, since the old regulation is not prepared for SMEs to enjoy affordable and cost-effective loans. They prefer to extend loans to credit card holders, because it is less risky and has a higher interest rate. There is a bill at the Congress that should be pursued. This is a special year for you, isn’t it? Yes, it is because we turn 45 and we have initiated a call for uni- versities and institutions, and we will give three awards between those who present the best project related to the promotion of added value exports. A total of twenty companies and 68 uni- versities from all over the country submitted their projects, so we are very happy about the great interest displayed. I would like to highlight the support we have received from Banco Nación Argen- tina, SEPYME, Federal Council of Investment and the Argentine Foreign Affairs Ministry, through ExportAr. This is an opportunity we are very proud of and makes us feel very optimistic towards the future. AIERA is a business union organization made up by small and medium national companies, as well as regional and sectoral Chambers. The companies that are members of the entity are mainly SMEs of national capital that carry out activities related to imports and/or exports. They be- long to a variety of fields including manufacturers and services providers in foreign trade. In this opportunity we interviewed their president, Daniel Solda. 23News\n\n25.

Maybe a wine distributor can develop the oil bu- siness, but it’s not a linear thing. We have some structures in common for both businesses as regards production, administra- tion, logistics, etc. -After a bad season in the 70s, it wasn’t until the 90s that olive oil recovered its status as “healthy.” Do you think that increased demand for olive oil over recent years has anything to do with cul- tural factors? What do you attribute the growth to? The growth of olive oil in the world has to do with quality and the fact that it’s a healthy natural food. Although it is one of the “oils” group, it’s in a category that doesn’t compete with sunflower or corn oil. In a market such as ours they can function as substitute products but the uses are different. I mean, eating pasta with good olive oil, pouring it on a piece of bread or cheese are things that can’t be done with other oils. Besides, they’re to- tally different products in everything from flavours to nutritional properties. There’s room for olive oil in any diet, I think. Not everyone can buy it but the person who does begin to consume it, especially the better quality oils, finds it easy to adapt since good olive oil doesn’t need a very elaborate dish. In countries with the highest olive oil consumption in recent years, like the USA or Brazil, de- mand has grown. In Argentina we’ve incorporated certain elements of the Medi- In 1968, you started out in the wine industry with the construction of the Zuccardi wine cellar, and have had good sustained growth. What led you to bring olive oil production into the business? Mendoza is the most traditional olive-growing region in Argen- tina. There have been olive trees here for over a century, planted by the immigrants who arrive den masse. It was a strong cultural element for the immigrant in the area. Then, in the 1940s a law was passed to foster the planting of olive trees, and this was one of the regions where the greatest number was planted. Today we’re talking of 20,000 hectares of olive trees in the province. We became interested in the crop and began to learn about it. Until then, vine yards and wine production had been the main activity. Then we noticed that although there were olive trees and conditions were right to obtain certain varieties and quality in the area, there was no transmission of the concept of quality to the consumer. It’s a product with a very interesting diversity, with a world of possibilities in terms of production, just like wine. We liked that and it was the basic starting point for the business. We became really enthusiastic about the activity and the product saw a good opportunity and so began to produce oil. Has any sort of synergy been created between both businesses? For instance, have you used locations or international contacts made from exporting wines? Commercially speaking, they’re different products. In the foreign market, the players that import wine are different to those who import oil. Of course wine opens doors and creates a network of relationships.

Our challenge is to boost consumption of olive oil, but high quality oil. Was the increase in the local production of olive oil supported by any tax incentives? In the 1990s a series of tax incentives in certain provinces like San Juan, La Rioja and Catamarca were introduced to support the development of new olive-growing areas. It became one of the most commonly planted crops at that time. Today the activity is in a difficult position due to the agricultural subsidies paid in the European Community. There are unreal prices in the market; countries like Spain, for example, sell the product at prices ap- proaching cost. When it comes to exporting, this makes things difficult for producers in Argentina or any other country in South America. The fall in values has been constant since November 2008; it’s a macro problem that is hard for the producer to ma- nage. It’s a complicated moment but we should use to build insti- tutionality. For Argentina olive oil’s a very interesting product be- cause it can be easily differentiated when marketing, so adding great value throughout the chain. You’ve been producing extra virgin varietal olive oil since 2004. What changes have you observed in national and international demand for the product? Have many varieties been incorporated? Have taste buds become more sophisticated? Today’s consumer looks for quality and diversity in all products; demand for Argentine wines wouldn’t be growing as it is otherwise. But olive oil is a product with a long history in the Me- diterranean. Countries like Italy have been present in the market for many years. Argentine olive oil is new for the consumer but today we’re proud to say that we’re producing oil in this country, as with wine 20 years ago. At present, market conditions with such low prices for oils from the Mediterranean mean it’s not so easy to carry out this mission. When you enter a market you do so with competitive prices. For example, Argentine wine started out with a strategy of offering a very high quality product at very reasonable prices. That’s an unavoidable door for any product. Why are you going to pay more for Argentine oil when you can buy an Italian or Spanish one? These are the two necessary con- ditions for growth: on one hand, to work on constructing the “Argentine oil” category, and on the other, to be more competi- tive on a more massive scale. People are slowly getting to know varietal wines. We work the FAMILIA ZUCCARDI line of varietal wines that have limited volu- me. Regardless of whether oil is single-varietal or not, our aim is to help the consumer distinguish a good oil from a low quality one. Although it’s still difficult today, there are preferences for certain qualities over others. The consumer needs to take certain steps prior to buying a varietal oil, like knowing which is extra virgin, which is a good or bad oil, how to use it, etc. Varietal oil targets a more demanding consumer, one who is looking for something different, who identifies with this type of product. Although this process of producing single-varietal oils identified 27News\n\n28. 28 News by label has grown in the world market over the last 10 years, it is also a recent process. Which technological changes have accompanied the development of the sector? Today Argentina boasts top-of-the-range technology. In agricul- ture, it has made great strides in the technology it uses. We need to bear in mind that modern large-scale activity in olive oil is new, and innovative technologies posing new challenges are continua- lly being introduced. In Mendoza, the situation varies since we have many hectares of traditional olive trees planted between 1930 and 1950. It’s a little more difficult for us to mechanize aspects like harvesting. The agricultural aspects of the activity have changed a great deal over the last 15 years and, for traditional areas like Mendoza or certain regions of Italy and Spain with small-scale operations, it’s not so easy to take such a step. The producer needs help to adapt and become competitive in the long term. Do the varieties consumed in the local market differ from those that are exported? There’s still no varietal differentiation between domestic con- sumption and what is exported. Some of the most commonly planted varieties in Argentina are the Arbequina Catalana and the Coratina, but there are also more modern varieties. Regions such as Mendoza have older varieties like Farga, Arauco, Neva- dillo. The more modern types are the same as those planted in many other places around the world, and they’ve arrived in Ar- gentina in the last 15 years. In varietal oil we still have a lot to do in our country, namely discovering the best varieties for the different regions. This process occurs naturally as a result of the experiences of each producer. What quality policies have been implemented by the company? As a company, Zuccardi has certified its quality management system with DNV (Det Norske Veritas) under ISO 9001:2008, its environmental management system under ISO 1400:2004 and its food safety system under ISO 22000:2005.We have not yet certified oil. In 2009 we began to produce oils at our own establishment and we are still developing the activity. The installations are appro- priate and we’ll have no real difficulty certifying. Today we’re trying to apply the concepts we’ve learnt from the processes we have certified in wine production and the idea is to certify soon. At Familia Zuccardi we have great respect for our quality philoso- phy because it’s part of our identity. What are the benefits of olive oil? Which qualities make it a healthy product recommendable for consumption? The most important quality of oil is the completely natural se- paration it undergoes. It’s a process in which the oil is separated by means of centrifugation or pressure (this takes an hour). El- sewhere in the world, most seed oils are separated by solvents. The other very important point is that, according to studies made, this oil boosts good cholesterol (HDL) levels thanks to its high oleic acid content. It also has a high antioxidant content, A succes story | Familia Zuccardi 28 News\n\n29. News 29 and many properties and health benefits. But not all consumers are aware of this, there’s still no general culture on the importan- ce of olive oil in the diet. Per capita consumption in Argentina is less than 170 cubic centimetres per year. The country produces 25 million litres approximately and domestic consumption is bet- ween 5 and 7 million, the difference is exported. I reckon that consumption in the domestic market still has a long way to go. You’ve won several international awards. Do you think the quality of Argentine oils is comparable to that of producers with long ex- perience in other countries like Spain or Italy? There’s great potential in Argentina. What happens in the Medi- terranean countries is that they generally have much more expe- rience, and the commercial brands produce very acceptable oils. But not all olive oil producing regions are the same, and certain varieties will work better in some than in others. As a region Mendoza is a quality producer. What growth has the brand experienced over the years? At the moment we’re a small business that is still at the product development stage, offering new brands. We’re slowly growing and our strategy is to be able to differentiate ourselves through product quality. We’re building our distribution, our products and brands. Perhaps we’re not yet a strong olive oil brand but we feel we’re in a position to make a mark in the category. We’re also working on the entire production process: planting the olive trees, harvesting and producing at our own plant and selling. This is major differentiation if we look at other competitors in the area. We’re present throughout the chain and this makes quali- ty our differential. It’s a recent process in which we are gaining ground. We’re working very hard in the domestic market (85%) and we’re gradually learning about the foreign market. Today we export a little to Canada, Peru, Brazil and Colombia. Our country ranks as the sixth largest exporter of olive oil, with Portugal and Turkey as fourth and fifth. Do you think Argentina is in a position to improve that position? Conditions for obtaining high-yielding crops, achieving suitable varieties and having access to better technologies to separate the oil will come because the scenario in many regions is very positive. But we need to keep an eye on what’s going on in the international market and with European subsidies. Is Argentina’s counter-seasonal production an advantage in the oil business? It’s a fundamental advantage that will become more important in the long term because we still have to develop the consumer, and this will require time, work and education. You’ve been participating in the activities organised by Fundación ExportAr since 2006.Do you feel they’ve helped you promote your brand in the world? We’ve been present at international fairs like Prowein (2008 & 2009 - Germany) or Fancy Food Show (2008 & 2010 –United States); at international business rounds such as Vinos y Bode- gas(2008 – Argentina), 9thInternational Business Round in Food and Drink (2010 - Argentina); in product insertion programmes such as Harrods(2006 – United Kingdom), Saboreá Argentina in Super ABC (2009 – Brazil); or in the promotion of services like Ar- About Zuccardi oils Bodega Familia Zuccardi has been producing extra virgin varie- tal olive oils since 2004. The quality of the olives and the careful handling they receive give colours, aromas and flavours that are an authentic expression of the characteristics of each of the three varieties: Arauco, Manzanilla and Frantoio. Familia Zuccardi Arauco: yellow oil with intense green tones. It has a fruity flavour, with as light bitter spiciness that gives it a very expressive, rather wild characteristic. It is ideal to accom- pany green salads or game meat, or to sprinkle on strong cheeses. Familia Zuccardi Manzanilla: Variety originating in Andalusia, Spain, which was introduced into Argentina around 1940. It is ye- llow with a slight greenish tone and a fruity flavour reminiscent of apple peel. It has a pleasant bitterness, with a fresh slightly spicy after taste. It is recommended as a seasoning for grilled fish, well- seasoned soups and grilled vegetables. Familia Zuccardi Frantoio: A variety originating in central Italy, which was introduced into Argentina at the start of the 20th cen- tury. It is yellow with green reflections and tastes of fresh olives, accompanied by a sweet, rather spicy after taste. It is recommen- ded as a basic dressing for bread and raw vegetables, and for pas- ta sauces. 29News\n\n30. 30 News gentine Menu on the TGV (2009 – France), Argen- tine Menu at the Ritz Carlton (2010 – Chile), Des- sert Palm Polo Club-Cartier Dubai Cup (United Arab Emirates - 2011); at some with wines and at others with olive oil. These activities are an excellent tool that needs to be developed, to encourage travel to understand other markets. Of course the company then has to do its part. It’s been good for us and very useful to be in contact with potential foreign clients. Then comes what we as entrepreneurs in the sector can do to adapt our needs to this type of tool. How did the idea of creating the Casa del Visitante Restaurant come about? In 2000, the number of tourists was slowly growing and we thought we needed somewhere to recei- ve them with specialized staff, so we decided to open this space. So we converted a space in the cellar where we stored the barrels into a small tas- ting room and a wine shop. It opened in November 2001. Today instead of just one person to look af- ter it we have over 30, all of them wine specialists, which makes the visits more professional. One year later we had to extend the space and the different programmes on wine to allow the visitor to take part in the various stages of production. The following step was the opening of the restaurant at the Mai- pú site in 2001, located where the cellar and the oil plant are. At first Dolli Irigoyen helped us fine-tune the project. The restaurant only opens at midday and the focus is on the regional cuisine of Mendoza. A success story | Familia Zuccardi 30 News\n\n31.

Washington Convention Center. Considered the first event of the sector in the United States, one of the most important ones of its type, it had the participation of 2400 exhibitors coming from over 80 countries, reaching a total of 180,000 products. Over 24,000 professionals visited it. Fancy Foods is characterized by the important presence of North American companies, both importers as well as producers, and by their influences in the Canadian, Mexican and Caribbean markets. It’s a Fair organized since 1995 by NASFT, National Association for the Speciality Food Trade’s Fancy Food Show and it takes place twice a year (Winter Fancy Food and Summer Fancy Food). This event offers a program of technical and professional training, which allows, among other things, to evaluate the sector trends. The American agrifood market assists the demands of more than 300 million consumers and generates a business volume around 1.3 billion de dollars. Consumers’ diversity and the quick pace of evolution and change in habits are constantly opening niches for differentiated products and giving room for new competitors. Having a privileged geography, climate and phytosanitary condi- tions, in addition to very proactive business culture, Argentina has consolidated a supply of high quality food and beverage products with added value, which have gained the recognition and trust of the American market. The sector presents some specific characteristics that make it dis- tinct from others. These products have at least one of these cha- racteristics: unique or Premium character, differentiated quality, exotic or remote origin, high price, packaging quality, differentia- ted distribution channel. Therefore, within said industry, one can SummerFancyFood Show2011 find from meats and smoked fish, to exotic varieties of tea, going through a wide range of products. The companies of the sector have significant dynamism in terms of employment. In fact, the average number of workers increased over 50% in the last few years. Likewise, the good performance of the sector and the perspectives of exports developments have in- creased the number of investing companies. In that regard, among the industries receiving investments, the ones that stand out are: development of external markets, development of packaging and advertising and purchase of new machinery. This last thing ac- counts for the growing significance of sales (internal and external) that have made most companies operate with high levels of use of the installed capacity, which generates the constant need to obtain new equipment in order to increase production volumes. Generally, those who make incursions into this sector, do it from small-sized projects, guided by a business vision of detecting po- tentially attractive niches. Innovation and technological change are key aspects to foster development in sectors like gourmet, where quality and distinctive characteristics of the products are the main axes of the production. Most companies have performed some type of technological innovation in the last few years, which has allowed them to offer new products or modify the existing ones. Fundación ExportAr accompanies this sector participating in sec- tor fairs or food and beverages fairs where they can exhibit their products; an example of this is the presence in events in the Uni- ted Sates, such as: Winter Fancy Food, Expo West, Summer Fancy Food, PMA, America Food & Beverage which took place and will take place this year. Likewise, moving forward in a Plan for Promotion and Strategic Positioning of the sector, Fundación ExportAr together with the Standard Bank Foundation, work for the development of gour- met exporting consortiums in order to increase their exports: these With a varied exportable offer, Argentina participated in the main event of the sector in the United States and one of the most important ones of its type.

Argentine Participation Among the Latin American participants, besides Chile and Mexico, other present countries were Peru, Brazil, Ecuador and Caribbean countries. Argentina had a National Pavilion of 182 m2 and 20 exhibiting companies. Within the exportable supply that Argentine companies offered, the following products stood out: olives, extra virgin olive oil, herb teas, wines, honey, balsamic vinegar, prunes, and raisins, among others. Many of the companies that already have connections with the American market look to strengthen them by being present in this type of exhibitions or entering new unexplored niches of the mar- ket or those not easy to penetrate, trying to enlarge their client list. The companies that went for the first time had the objective of approaching the United States market through the search of distributors and representatives. Results Regarding the joint assessment of results, exhibitors said they have obtained 396 business contacts. Out of the total number of com- panies, 3 of them closed export transactions during the event, and as a result from attending it companies expect to perform sales in the medium and long term worth USD 3.850.000. The next edition of the event will take place between 17th and 19th of June 2012 in the city of Washington DC.

The North American economy is highly dynamic based on high participation of services that represent 77% of the Gross Domestic Product. Regarding exports, United States was the third world exporter in 2010, right after China and Germany, with shipments to other countries worth 1.289 million dollars. Their main exported products are capital goods such as, telecommunication equipment, airplanes, vehicles and computers. However, since it is a highly diversified economy, the United States also is an important exporter of agricultural and industrial products. The main destinations of North American exports are their business partners from NAFTA (Canada reaches a share of 19.4% and Mexico 12.2%), followed by China (6.6%), Japan (4.8%), United Kingdom (4.3%) and Germany with 4.1%. Regarding imports, United States consolidated as the main world importer of purchases worth 1,936 billion dollars. The main acquisitions from abroad were consumer goods, mainly clothes, furniture, toys and medicines. Their main providers are: China (with a share of 19.3%), Canada (14.2%) Mexico (11.1%), Japan (6.1%) and Germany (4.5%). Regarding bilateral commerce between Argentina and the United States, exports to that market reached 3,485 million dollars in 2010. Among the main products exported to the North American market, we find crude oil exports worth 863 million dollars and a share of 24.7%, followed by metals and its manufacturers (509 million dollars and a share of 14.6%) beverages and alcoholic drinks (249 million dollars and a share of 7.1%), chemical products (178 million dollars and a share of 5.1%), fuels (159 million dollars and a share of 4.6%) and at the end of the list, it is important to mention prepared shipments of legumes, preparations of vegetables and fruits (154 million dollars and a share of 4.4%).

In highly sophisticated markets such as that of the United States, the main challenge lies in the quality of the product. In this context, it is estimated that almost a fifth of the food consumption of the population of developed countries such as the United States, belong to high added value foods. In the last years, Argentina has been able to develop and export a great amount of products with added value, which, despite some customs difficulties, have had good reception in the North American country. The main products are shipments of beverages and alcoholic drinks, prepared legumes, preparations of vegetables and fruits, honey, fish, elaborated seafood, dried fruits and dairy products. Within the United States, the main markets for foods with added value are concentrated in the main cities of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, San Francisco, Houston and Atlanta.
