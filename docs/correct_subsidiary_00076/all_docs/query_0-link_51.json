FITZMYER THE GOSPEL ACCORDING 'ID LUKE X-XXIV\n\nis Volume 28A in the Anchor Bible series of new, book-by-book translations of the Old and New Testaments and Apocrypha. This is the conclusion of Joseph A. Fitzmyer's two-volume study of Luke. Included here is Fitzmyer's work on chapter 10, in which Jesus continues his journey to Jerusalem, through chapter 24, his Resurrection and appearances. The translation relies on the commentator's familiarity with the Greek and Semitic languages, while the exegesis commands a thorough knowledge of the vast cultural, technical, and linguistic information he has gathered from an international selection of Lucan literature. Each of the fifteen chapters here is studied and discussed in respect to the Gospel as a whole, Acts, and the Old Testament. The two indices refer to both volumes on Luke. In \"joining the spirit to the letter\" and scholarship to faith, Joseph A. Fitz(continued on back flap)\n\n(continued from front flap)\n\nmyer has produced a worthy successor to his The Gospel According to Luke I IX, which Theowgical Studies described as \"extraordinarily learned and rich ... a benchmark in Lucan studies.\" Joseph A.

I have sought to write a new, modem commentary on the Gospel according to Luke in the \"classic\" mode. In it I have tried to restore the esteem that Luke once enjoyed in the past among the evangelists. In recent decades a very pejorative view of this writer had emerged (see pp. 4-5), and it has been my aim to show that there is another way ofreading \"the Rev. Mr. Luke,\" one which still has something to say to a twentieth-century Christian. I only hope that these two volumes measure up to that goal in some way. The reader of the second volume will in time note some differences from the first volume. Some of them are owing to the publication of more recent works that influenced my study of the Gospel. For instance, my translation of the Gospel was initially based on the 25th ed. of Nestle-Aland, but once the 26th ed. of that critical text appeared, I began to make more and more use of it, even though I never followed its text slavishly. Similarly, I have consulted the newer commentaries (e.g. that of I. H. Marshall, which only came into my hands as I was completing the manuscript of vol. 28, and that of E. Schweizer) and the study of Lucan language by J. Jeremias. Had I had such excellent studies from the beginning, my work would have been greatly reduced. Secondary literature on the Lucan Gospel is enormous. I have tried to cull from it the best that I could-Qr at least the best that would fit into the way I should prefer a twentieth-century Christian to read this Gospel. I have not been able to incorporate every view that differs from mine. I have been trying to write my own commentary on the Lucan Gospel in dialogue, to be sure, with other commentators; but sometimes views, based on quite different approaches, have had to be left without comment. In referring to the secondary literature, I have often used an author's name and a short title. If the reader is interested in pursuing a topic further, he/she should refer first to the bibliography which follows the passage under discussion. In those sectional bibliographies one will usually find books and articles that bear on the passage as a whole. If the book or article indicated by a short title is not found in such sectional bibliographies, then one should consult the list of General Works Frequently Quoted with Short Titles (pp. xxx-xxxvi). Often enough, the names of commentators are merely listed, especially when various interpretations are being set forth; in these cases short titles are not\n\nx\n\nPREFACE\n\nused, and the reader is expected to consult the list of commentaries and monographs in vol. 28, pp. 271-283. Secondary literature dealing with specific verses is usually cited in full in the notes on the verses concerned. In the sectional bibliographies divisions are sometimes found; in such cases the more generic bibliographical material precedes the specific. The reader will best use this commentary not only with a good modern English translation of the Bible, but also with a synopsis of the first three canonical Gospels. Gospel Parallels: A Synopsis of the First Three Gospels (ed. B. H. Throckmorton, Jr.; 4th ed.; London/Toronto/Camden, NJ: Nelson, 1979) is readily available. For those who read Greek, there is K. Aland, ed., Synopsis of the Four Gospels: Greek-English Edition of the Synopsis Quattuor Evangeliorum with the Text of the Revised Standard Version (3d ed.; New York: United Bible Societies, 1979) or, better still, K. Aland, ed., Synopsis quattuor evange/iorum: Locis para/le/is evange/iorum apocryphorum et patrum adhibitis (10th ed.; Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelstiftung, 1978). Also useful is the more recent Greek synopsis with German and English titles, A. Huck and H. Greeven, Synopse der drei ersten Evange/ien mit Beigabe der johanneischen Parallelstellen (13th ed.; Tiibingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1981). In using the last mentioned, the reader should be aware that the Greek text differs at times from N-A 26 and UBSGNT3, which I have in great part followed (at least in the latter part of this commentary). A recently published commentary on the Lucan Gospel by C. H. Talbert (Reading Luke: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the Third Gospel [New York: Crossroad, 1982]) sets out with the premise that a \"widespread loss of confidence in the two-source theory . . . has occurred during the past fifteen years\" (p. I). Anyone who uses this commentary of mine will realize that I do not share that alleged \"loss of confidence.\" It is characteristic of a small group of students of the Synoptic relationships, mostly American, a few British, and still fewer Continental scholars. I have preferred to line myself up with what is still the majority opinion in this matter, espoused by many German, Belgian, French, Scandinavian, and American scholars, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Fortunately, there is much good in Talbert's commentary, which saves it from the fate that it might otherwise encounter. Moreover, two recent successful books about controversial NT topics, published in this country, made profitable use of the modified form of the TwoSource Theory, Peter in the New Testament (eds. R. E. Brown et al.) and Mary in the New Testament (eds. R. E. Brown et al.). In the initial session of discussions on each of these topics the question of Synoptic relationships was broached; surprisingly, all present voted unanimously for the modified form of the Two-Source Theory. On pp. 82-85 of vol. 28 I spoke of the problem one has in trying to decide whether a given passage that has not been derived from \"Mk\" or \"Q\" comes from \"L\" or has been freely composed by the evangelist. When I composed\n\nPREFACE\n\nxi\n\nthe list of \"L\" passages that appears on. pp. 83-84, I did so on the basis of studies made of the Gospel up to that time of writing. Having pursued my research and analysis still further, I see today that that list needs some adjustment. The vast majority of the passages assigned to \"L\" at first still remains in that category, but there are some slight corrections to be made. They will be found on p. 1600, along with other corrigenda in vol. 28. At the end of this volume the reader will also find additional bibliography for some parts of vol. 28. The reader should recall the two important points incorporated into the preface of vol. 28 (pp. viii-ix) about the stages of the gospel tradition and the mode of referring to the OT, especially to the Psalter. It is again my pleasant task to express my thanks to various persons who helped me in many ways to finish this commentary on the Lucan Gospel. Once again I must thank Henry J. Bertels, S.J. and William J. Sheehan, C.S.B. of the Woodstock Theological Center Library, for much assistance; Raymond E. Brown, S.S., who has read and corrected part of my manuscript on the passion narrative; David Noel Freedman, the general editor of the Anchor Bible series, for many critical comments and suggestions which have improved the text of the commentary; Estelle Laurence, the copy editor; and Eve F. Roshevsky and her staff at Doubleday & Company, who have seen this volume to the end of its publication. When Jerome was writing .his commentary on Matthew's Gospel, he included the remark, \"In the words of the Gospels the Spirit has been joined to the letter; and whatever at first sight seems to be cold, if you touch it, grows hot.\"* So Jerome wrote about Matthew. But that can also be said about the Gospel of Luke and its portrait of Jesus of Nazareth. At least with such a conviction have I composed this commentary. May hearts of readers still be set on fire by reading about the risen Christ in the Gospel of Luke who begs them to touch the text of his words. A. FITZMYER, S.J.

Joiion, \"Notes philologiques,\" 353 (c.-a-d., \"comme un\n\n862\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§IVA\n\n&:lair qui vient [ou: sort] du ciel\"; cf. Luke 11: 16); F. W. Lewis, \"'I Beheld,'\" 233. The other (preferred) translation alludes to the OT description of Satan as \"the adversary,'' a functionary of the heavenly court of Yahweh prosecuting humanity; it would refer to his being deposed from his role. His fall would be the end of his accusation of humanity before God. Just when this fall takes place is not stated. Cf. Luke 22:3,3132. Luke, though he had spoken of \"the devil\" (diabolos, \"accuser\") in 4:2-13; 8:12, now uses for the first time the name Satanas, a grecized form of Hebrew saran or Aramaic safana' (as a common n., saran occurs in 4QTLevi ar\" 1:17 [MPAT § 21], \"adversary\"), a specific name for the arch-devil, \"Satan.\" His heavenly role is best seen in Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7, where God is depicted allowing him to test the blamelessness, uprightness, and fidelity of his servant Job. In Zech 3:1-2 he also appears in a vision at the right of \"the angel of the Lord\" as an accuser. Cp. 1 Chr 21:1; there he is said to have incited David to sin in taking up Israel's numerical census, whereas the parallel in 2 Sam 24: 1 ascribes the same sin to \"the anger of the Lord.\" In the parallel of 1 Chronicles postexilic theology has been at work, removing God from any causality of human sin and ascribing its origin to a personification of evil. Another form of the mythical origin of sin is found in a more primitive expression in 1 Kgs 21: 19-23 (\"a lying spirit\"). The name Satan occurs in intertestamental writings also as MaJremah, a fem. maqtal n. type, with the nun of the root assimilated to the initial m. It is an abstraction, \"Opposition, Prosecution.\" See lQM 13:4,11; CD 16:5; lQS 3:23; Jub. 10:8. See NOTE on 4:2. \"Satan\" will appear again in Luke 11:18; 13:16; 22:3,31; Acts 5:3; 26:18. The vb. etheoroun is in the impf. tense and is taken by many commentators as expressive of continuous action, \"I was watching,'' or \"I watched repeatedly.\" E.g. J. M. Creed, The Gospel, 147. I have preferred it myself, though I recognize that this Greek vb. is used only in the pres. and impf. and that theasthai is used for other forms. See BDF § 101. Creed would interpret the vb. as referring to some \"ecstatic vision\" (ibid.; similarly E. E. Ellis, Gospel of Luke, 151; HST 161). Certainly to be excluded is the meaning of it as a vision of the preexistent Jesus, since his preexistence is not something that Luke reckons with in his Gospel; so too W. Foerster, TDNT 1. 157. Likewise to be excluded is that of a proleptic vision of something to take place at the last judgment; the Lucan Jesus is not an apocalyptist of the sort responsible for Rev 12:9-12. The ptc. pesonta is aor., expressing punctiliar action. See ZBG § 269 for a good discussion of the relation of this ptc. to the main vb. The fall has nothing to do with Gen 6:1-4, even though later rabbinic tradition often thought of the fall of Satan as connected with that passage, probably in an effort to explain the strange Nephi/Fm. \"fallen ones\" (?), which appear there. See Str-B 2. 167-168. Because there is a reference to Isa 14:15 in v. 15 (see NOTE), some commentators think that Jesus alludes to Isa 14: 12 (\"How you are fallen from heaven, 0 Day Star, son of dawn\"). E.g. see I. H. Marshall, Luke, 428-429. However, in that taunt addressed to the king of Babylon he has exalted himself to the sky like astral deities; there is no mention of Satan in that text-a later tradition prone to identify Satan and Lucifer notwithstanding. 19. See. Lit. \"behold\"; Luke uses idou, which introduces something new (see BAGD 371), revealing the original independence or isolation of this verse.\n\n10:17-20\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n863\n\nI have given. The preferred reading here is the pf. indic. dedoka, found in mss. P 75 , !IC, B, c•, L, W, etc. But some mss. (P 4s, A, C3, D, 0, and the Koine text-tradition) have the pres. didomi, \"I am giving.\" This pres. tense would rather refer to a promise being made by Jesus to Christian missionaries of the future. It is better, however, to understand it of the \"power and authority\" implied in the mission-charge already given to the \"seventy(-two) others.\" authority. This is probably an allusion to the authority mentioned in 9: 1 (addressed to the Twelve; cf. Mark 6:7); it is now stated as implied in the mission-charge to the others (vv. 2-12). Then. exousian governs two unequal objs., an infinitival cl. and a prepositional phrase. to tread upon serpents and scorpions. Though many commentators think that the first three words of this saying (patein epano opheon) are modeled on or allude to Ps 91:13 (\"you will trample upon the lion and the dragon\" [MT: tirmos Mpir wetanntm; LXX: katapateseis leonta kai drakonta]), it is a farfetched allusion, pace P. Grelot, \"Etude critique de Luc 10,19,\" 90. Greek ophis, \"serpent, snake,\" never renders Hebrew tannfm, \"dragon,\" in the LXX. The animals mentioned here were neither \"half demonic\" nor symbols of demons (so E. E. Ellis, Gospel of Luke, 157), as G. Foerster rightly notes (TDNT 5. 579). The serpent and the scorpion were not only well-known sources of physical evil in Palestinian life, but were OT symbols of all kinds of evil. The seductive serpent of Gen 3:1-14, used to explain the \"origin\" of evil in human life, appears in the LXX as ho ophis. See further Num 21:6-9; Sir 21:2, cf. Pss 58:4; 140:3. For the scorpion as a means of divine chastisement, see 1 Kgs 12: 11, 14; 2 Chr 10:11,14; Sir 39:30. The combination of serpents and scorpions is already found in Deut 8:15. Cf. Luke 11:11-12. For the juxtaposition of them and Satan in the later targumic tradition, see P. Grelot, \"Etude critique,\" 92-96. Cf. A. Alon, Natural History, 182-187, 203-209. over all the power of the Enemy. A different phrase, introduced by epi, expresses the same idea in parallelism; it too depends on exousia. See NOTE on \"authority\" above. \"The Enemy\" (ho echthros) is a synonym for \"Satan,\" the prosecuting adversary. Cf. Rev 9: 10-11. For the expected subjection, see NOTE on 4:34. nothing shall harm you at all. Or possibly, \"he (i.e. the Enemy) shall harm you in nothing,\" understanding the negative ouden, placed emphatically at the head of the cl., as an adv. acc. In the preferred translation ouden acts as the subj. of the cl. Either translation is possible, and both suit the context. 20. So. The verse is introduced by the conj. plen (see NOTE on 10: 11), and this is indicative of the verse's original independent status. I have used \"rather\" at the beginning of the second cl. of this verse, which it logically introduces. spirits. See NOTE on \"even the demons\" (v. 17). your names stand written in heaven! Lit. \"your names have been written (and remain so [pf.]) in the heavens.\" Cf. lQS 7:2. Jesus' words allude to the OT idea of the heavenly book of the living or of life, the registry of those who belong to God's upright people. The image is drawn from the ancient records of cities or kingdoms, which listed the citizens who belonged to them. For the OT background, see Exod 32:32-33; Pss 69:28; 56:9; 87:6; Isa 4:3; 34:16; Dan 12:1; Mal 3:16-17. The idea is further reflected in several NT passages: Phil 4:3; Heb 12:23; Rev 3:5; 13:8. Cf. the use of it in intertestamental literature: Jub. 30:19-23; 1 Enoch 47:3; 104:1,7; 108:3,7; lQM 12:2;\n\n864\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§IVA\n\n4Ql80 1:3 (see the photo: whw' J,rwt 'I lhwt[ ]; cf. J.

Baillet, \"Un recueil liturgique de QumrAn, Grotte 4: 'Les paroles des luminaires,'\" RB 68 [1961] 195-250, esp. 232). The idea itself is rooted in ancient Sumerian and Akkadian literature. See S. M.

JESUS' PRAISE OF THE FATHER; THE BLESSEDNESS OF THE DISCIPLES (10:21-24) 10 21 At that moment Jesus found delight in the holy Spirit and said, \"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent, yet have revealed them to small children. Indeed, Father, this has been your good pleasure. 22 All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is but the Father, or who the Father is but the Son or the one to whom the Son Chooses to reveal him.\" 23 Turning to the\n\n10:21-24\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n865\n\ndisciples, Jesus said to them privately, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! 24 I tell you, many prophets and kings have wanted to see what you now see and have not seen it, to hear what you hear and have not heard it.\" COMMENT\n\nLuke now appends to Jesus' comments on the success of the disciples' mission a double-episode, in which he records Jesus' praise of God as his Father (10:21-22) and his declaration of the favored status of his disciples as eyewitnesses of his ministry and teaching (10:23-24). The double-episode acts as further commentary on the disciples' relationship to him. They have not only been his representatives (v. 16), with their names inscribed in heaven (v. 20), but they are \"children\" favored with a revelation about him and his heavenly Father; in this status their real beatitude is found (vv. 21-24). Luke has derived these sayings from two different parts of \"Q\" and joined them as a fitting further comment of Jesus on the status of the disciples, to whom he had shortly before addressed his instructions. The Matthean counterparts of these sayings are found in different contexts (11:25-27 and 13:1617). Jesus' praise of the Father is a sequel in Matthew to the woes on the Galilean cities, which, as does the connection in Luke 10:13-15 and 21-22, shows that the woes and the praise of the Father were once closely related in \"Q.\" Luke separated the woes to make them part of the mission-charge; now he picks up their sequel and appends it to Jesus' comments on the missionsuccess of the seventy(-two), adding it to a beatitude about their eyewitnessstatus. The latter saying forms part of the parable-discourse in Matthew 13, where it is inserted into a Marean setting. Luke may have preserved the original order of these sayings in \"Q,'' and possibly Matthew has moved the beatitude to another context, but it is really impossible to say. I prefer to think that they were not originally joined in \"Q.\" This Lucan double-episode has a threefold grouping of sayings of Jesus: his praise of the Father, a revelatory utterance, and a beatitude pronounced over the disciples. In this it has a certain similarity to Matt 11 :25-30 (see also p. 76), where a slightly different threefold group of sayings is found: Jesus' praise of the Father, a revelatory utterance, and a consolation for the heavily burdened. E. Norden (Agnostos theos, 279-280, 301) regarded Matt 11:25-30 as a unit derived from \"Q.\" He has been followed at times by others (e.g. K. Stendahl, \"Matthew,'' PCB 784; T. Arvedsen, Das Mysterium Christi, 5-9). The third saying in vv. 28-30, however, is found exclusively in that Gospel and has been derived from \"M\" (a possibility that Norden did not deny). Bultmann (HST 159) was certainly right in recognizing its independence\n\n866\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§IVA\n\nfrom vv. 25-27; and he has been followed by many others (e.g. H. D. Betz, \"The Logion of the Easy Yoke and of Rest (Matt 11 :28-30),\" JBL 86 [ 1967] 17-18; M. J. Suggs, Wisdom, 79-81; cf. W. Bousset, Kyrios Christos, 84). It has no counterpart in the Lucan Gospel. Though this may seem like an argument from silence, Luke would hardly have suppressed such a part of \"Q,\" since it would have suited so well the immediate context about the success of the disciples and their return had it been there. Moreover, a form of Matt 11 :2830 is found in Gos. of Thom. § 90: \"Jesus said, 'Come to me, for convenient is my yoke, and my lordship is gentle, and you will find repose for yourselves.' \" Were the sayings in vv. 21-22 originally a unit? That to which tauta, \"these things\" (v. 21), originally referred is not only obscure, but it is not certain that panta, \"all things\" (v. 22), refers to the same. Jesus' praise of the Father in v. 2lb speaks of the Father's revelation and says nothing about himself, whereas v. 22 is concerned with the Son's revelation. For this reason some commentators have suggested that vv. 21-22 were not initially a unit. So R. Bultmann (HST 159-160), who characterized v. 21b-c as a \"Hellenistic revelation saying,\" but v. 22 as a saying derived from a lost Jewish (Aramaic) writing, which Jesus may have used. Yet even though there are differences in vv. 21-22, the contrast of the Father and the Son, made explicit in v. 22, is already implicit in v. 21b; this seems to provide enough indication that the two revelatory sayings, one from the Father, and one from the Son, were a unit. This unit (vv. 21-22) is the only saying in the Synoptic Gospels in which Jesus is made to speak as he often does in the Johannine Gospel. It has been called \"a meteorite fallen from the Johannine sky\" (K. A. von Hase, Geschichte Jesu [2d ed.; Leipzig: Breitkopf und Hartel, 1891] 422). Here alone the Synoptic Jesus speaks of a mutual knowledge in a way akin to what has been called Hellenistic mysticism, and in addition he designates himself absolutely \"the Son\" (three times in one verse; recall, however, Mark 13:32, which is omitted by Luke). It thus raises the question whether the Synoptic tradition here meets the Johannine in some way. Two passages of the Fourth Gospel, in particular, are often compared with these verses: \"As the Father knows me, so I too know the Father\" (10:15); and\" . . . as you have granted him [your Son, the Son of v. 1] authority over all mankind [lit. flesh], that he might give eternal life to all those whom you have given him\" (17:2). Similar echoes, not as closely parallel, could be found in John 3:35; 6:65; 7:29; 13:3; 14:7,9-11; 17:25. One explanation of the resemblances might be that the Johannine tradition has borrowed from the Synoptic; but I am reluctant to adopt such an explanation. It seems more likely that the Synoptic tradition has preserved a form of saying which was more at home in the developing Johannine tradition which has affected it, even though we cannot be more specific about the manner of the contact.\n\n10:21-24\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n867\n\nLucan composition in this episode is evident in the introductory temporal phrase (\"at that moment\") and in the mention of Jesus' delight in the holy Spirit. In vv. 23-24 he has fashioned the introductory participial cl., making the beatitude refer expressly to the disciples (Matt 13:16 is less clear). He has also redactionally modified v. 21 in the use of the compound vb. apekrypsas, \"you have hidden,\" to make it parallel apekalypsas (whereas Matthew has retained the simple vb. ekrypsas from \"Q\"). Moreover, Luke has sharpened the form of the revelatory utterance and of the beatitude. In the former, the \"Q\"-form (retained by Matthew) expressed merely the fact of the revealed knowledge of the Father and the Son, but Luke's reformulation centers the reader's attention on the nature of the Father and the Son by the use of the indirect questions, \"Who the Son is\" and \"Who the Father is.\" The reformulation serves not merely to make known God as Father, but to manifest the relationship of Jesus to him precisely as Son. Similarly, in the beatitude, in emphasizing \"what you see,\" he lauds the disciples not just for the fact of seeing, but for what they have seen and heard. However, Luke has probably retained the original formulation of \"Q\" in the phrase \"prophets and kings,\" whereas Matthew has changed it to \"prophets and righteous ones\" (13: 17; cf. Matt 10:41 [\"M\"]; 23:29). (Cf. J. Jeremias, Die Sprache, 189.) Ever since E. Norden's discussion of Matt 11 :25-30, parallels to Jesus' revelatory utterance (esp. v. 22) have been sought in Hellenistic and other ancient literature. Norden set forth the six Matthean verses in cola and strophes, stressed the threefold form (address of praise to the Father, content of the revelation [couched in the third sg.], and appeal for acceptance of it by worthy listeners), and sought for parallels to it in Hellenistic or Hellenistic Jewish literature (Agnostos theos, 280). He appealed to Sir 5!:1-30 (dividing it into three parts: 1-12, 13-22, 23-30) and to the Hermetic tractate I (Poimandres 32). For the latter, see A. D. Nock and A.-J. Festugiere, Corpus hermeticum (4 vols.; Collection Bude; Paris: \"Les belles-Lettres,\" 1945-1954), 1. 19; W. Scott, Hermetica (4 vols.; Oxford: Clarendon, 1924-1936), 1. 132133 (neither edition gives the full text that Norden cites on p. 293; nor does he himself on p. 110, to which he refers!). Norden found further traces of the same revelatory tradition in form or content in Sir 24: 1-2,5-6, 18-19 (part of this text is now found in Hebrew in 1lQPs• 21:11-17; for its pertinence to the discussion of Matthew, see M. J. Suggs, Wisdom, 80-81); Odes Sol. 33:6-11; and various Pauline passages. Norden has at times trimmed the evidence to suit his needs and wrenched some Pauline material from its contexts; he also insinuated all too early dates for the tradition that he was using, calling it \"a very ancient motif of oriental, and also Jewish, literature which certainly goes back to Egypt\" (Agnostos theos, 290). Whereas his sole \"Egyptian\" source was the Greek Hermetic tractate, which is not to be dated without further ado earlier than A.O. 125 (see C. H. Dodd, The Fourth Gospel [Cambridge: University Press, 1953) 11-12; cf. E. Haenchen, ZTK 53 [1956) 191), his\n\n868\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§IVA\n\noldest material was really the Greek text of Sirach (dated ca. 132 B.c.); the Odes of Solomon are certainly not older than the Hermetic literature, whatever their provenience may be. R. Bultmann (HST 160) added to the discussion a more ancient Egyptian text, drawn from Akhenaton's Hymn to the Aton (ad fin.):\" ... and there is no other that knows thee/Save thy Son Nefer-kheperu-Re Wa-en-Re [ = Akhenaton],/For thou hast made him well-versed in thy plans and in thy strength\" (J. A. Wilson, ANET 371). In more recent discussions much has been made of the OT and Jewish background of these sayings. M. J. Suggs (Wisdom, 89-95), while rightly stressing with H. Koester the Hellenization of Palestinian Judaism in the late pre-Christian centuries, invokes \"the most illuminating parallels\" for these sayings in Wis 2:17-18; 4:10,13-15, with an emphasis on election, eschatological knowledge, the intimate relation of Father and Son, and the failure of people to recognize the Son or the Father. W. D. Davies also sought to show the pertinence of some Qumran literature to the understanding of such sayings of Jesus(\" 'Knowledge' in the Dead Sea Scrolls,\" 133-139), appealing to such texts as lQS 4:2-5,18-25; 11:2-4,6; lQpHab 2:7-10 (are all of them cogent?). J. M. Robinson (\"Die Hodajot-Formel in Gebet und Hymnus des Friihchristentums,\" Apophoreta: Festschrift fiir Ernst Haenchen . . . [BZNW 30; Berlin: Topelmann, 1964] 194-235) further compared the introductory formula (10:2lb) with that in the Qumran Thanksgiving Psalms, as well as the thanksgiving tradition in early Christianity. All of these parallels provide a background for Jesus' praise of his Father and his revelatory utterance; they shed light not only on the genre of the sayings, but also raise a question about their authenticity (to which I shall return below). Form-critically considered, vv. 21-24 are to be classed as sayings of Jesus; those in vv. 21-22 have been classed as \"I\"-Sayings by R. Bultmann (HST 159-160); but they could also be understood as wisdom-sayings, even though the word sophia does not occur in them. They have been so regarded by a number of modem writers (e.g. M. J. Suggs, A. Feuillet, F. Christ). Verses 2324 are rather to be classed as prophetic sayings, with v. 23b more specifically as a beatitude. In both parts of the unit of sayings, one should note the heavy OT influence, both in form and in content. (See NOTES for details.) In this Lucan double-episode, Jesus is depicted as one who finds delight in his relation to the Spirit of God and to God himself, whom he acknowledges as Father. His Spirit-inspired prayer recognizes this Father as the Lord or Sovereign of heaven and earth, of that realm from which Satan has been seen falling and in which his disciples' names have been inscribed. But God is also Lord of the realm in which Jesus' own ministry and teaching have been manifested. He extols this Lord and Father, who has seen fit to reveal eschatological secrets, not to the wise and intelligent of this world, but to his\n\n10:21-24\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n869\n\nchosen disciples, the \"small children\" or the in-fantes, so characterized because they stand in the tradition of the genuine recipients of Israel's wisdom of old. What they have seen and heard ~as been a revelation from the Father himself. It has come to the disciples because it is a manifestation of the Father's bounteous providence for his people, a manifestation of his \"good pleasure\" (recall NOTE on 2:14). Verse 22 explains that what has been revealed to the disciples is not only the relation of Jesus to his heavenly Father, but also of them to him. He alone it is who reveals all \"these things\" (v. 21) as the Son; he is the revealer of the Father and of all that pertains to him. The Lord of heaven and earth has entrusted \"all things\" to Jesus precisely as \"the Son.\" If the sense of \"these things\" in its original setting escapes us, in this Lucan context it refers to the hidden meaning of what the disciples have seen and heard in the ministry and teaching of Jesus and to their relation to him. Again, if the sense of \"all things\" is obscure in its original setting, in the Lucan context it refers primarily to the knowledge of the Son about the Father and the knowledge that only he can transmit to his followers. \"Who the Son is\" and \"who the Father is\" are the important content of the Son's revelation-and their relation is not to be understood in an ontological sense, but in their joint concern for people with receptive ears. In the long run, this is the reason for the association of the beatitude uttered over the disciples in v. 23b. If Jesus' words in v. 2lb have, in effect, contrasted the disciples with their contemporaries, \"the wise and the intelligent,\" for whom \"these things\" lie still hidden, his words in vv. 23b-24 further contrast them with people who lived long before them. They have been eyewitnesses of the Son's unique revelation: his preaching, his activity, his personal impact on human beings, and now of his relation to the Father. Of old, prophets and kings longed to see the inbreaking of God's salvific work in human history through a promised messianic agent; now the \"small children\" of this age have witnessed it. In its own way the final saying of Jesus fits in with the Lucan fulfillment theme (see pp. 292-293). Verse 22c expresses the sheer gratuity of the definitive revelation that has now been made to human beings: \"to whom the Son chooses to reveal him\" (i.e. the Father). That revelation is made to \"small children,'' to the disciples of Jesus, the Christian community, and not to the wise and the intelligent of this world. Jesus as the Son and the revealer of the Father thus appears in the Synoptic tradition playing a role so familiar to the Johannine Jesus. The eschatological secrets revealed to the \"small children\" eventually become a secret even about the godhead itself (v. 22). Without using the title \"Son of God\" or making that the obj. of a revelation explicitly, these sayings assert a unique relation of Jesus to the Father, precisely as \"the Son,\" who alone through this mutual relationship (of fatherhood and sonship) is able to reveal. The later Christian tradition of the first century eventually gave Jesus the title \"God\"\n\n870\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§IVA\n\n(theos, in John 1:1; 20:28; Heb 1:8), a confessional title indeed. But Paul, in writing to the Corinthians ca. A.D. 57, could already speak of him as \"the Son\" (1 Cor 15:28), in the same absolute way as this title appears here in the Synoptic tradition. (See also M. Hengel, The Son of God: The Origin of Christology and the History of Jewish-Hellenistic Religion [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1976) 9). Thus the title used here brings a corrective to the later confessional title (theos), in that Jesus is seen as ho huios, \"the Son\"; he is not ho pater, he is not 'abbii~ This title, \"the Son,\" now appears in a saying found in Stage III of the gospel tradition. To what extent can the sayings, especially those in vv. 21-22, be traced back to Stage I, i.e. to the historical Jesus himself? There is probably no more disputed saying in the Synoptic tradition than this one, when the question of its authenticity is raised. Norden was reluctant to consider any of the six verses in the Matthean parallel as Jesus' autophonia (Agnostos Theos, 303-308). A. von Harnack was skeptical in the extreme (The Sayings of Jesus: The Second Source of St. Matthew and St. Luke [New York: Putnam; London: Williams & Norgate, 1908) 272-301). This approach has not gone without an assessment (see J. Chapman, \"Dr Harnack on Luke X 22: No Man Knoweth the Son,\" JTS 10 [1908-1909] 552-566). R. Bultmann, following M. Dibelius, considered vv. 21-22 as a \"Hellenistic revelation saying\" similar to Matt 28:18, and hence as a transmitted saying of the risen Lord. For him vv. 23-24 came from \"a possible Christian origin\" (HST 128, 160). In more recent times, commentators have been less sure about such negative assessments (see A. M. Hunter, \"Crux criticorum,'' 241-242, 245; M. J. Suggs, Wisdom, 72-77). When one considers the parallels to the sayings in other ancient literature, the relation of the sayings to the Johannine tradition, the redaction of the evangelists, and the specific content of the utterances, one realizes the problem. Yet even when one takes these factors into account, there is no firm basis for denying all connection of these Stage-III sayings with the historical Jesus. He must have said or insinuated something similar to what is recorded here to give rise to the rapid conclusion, which emerged not long after his death, that he was indeed the Son of God (albeit not yet understood in the sense of Nicaea). Although I am inclined to regard the substance of these sayings as authentic, that substance should more likely be traced to an implicit christology expressed in Jesus' words and deeds in his earthly ministry. Lastly, let it be recalled that, as Jesus prays to God here, addressing him simply as Father, so he will soon teach his disciples to pray (11:2-4).\n\n10:21-24\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n871\n\nNOTES\n\n10 21. At that moment. Lit. \"in/at that hour,\" an alleged Aramaism. Seep. 117. This is the Lucan introductory formula (see 2:38); the Matthean (11:25) is en ekeino to kairo, \"at that time.\" Whereas Matthew's phrase relates these sayings of Jesus to his moving about in Galilee with disciples (e.g. when the Baptist sent messengers to him, 11:2,7), Luke's formula relates the sayings to the return of the seventy(-two) and Jesus' comment on the report about their mission (10:17-21). Jesus. The best Greek mss. of the Lucan Gospel (P 4S, p1s, M, B, D, E, etc.) and ancient versions omit this name; it is found, however, in mss. A, C, W, 'I'. It is used in my translation not because it is the preferred Greek reading, but because the English version calls for a name-subject, as the Koine text-tradition also recognized. found delight. The vb. agalliasthai plays upon a Lucan motif, the first chords of which were struck in the infancy narrative (1:47; cf. 1:14,44; Acts 2:46). It gives expression to Jesus' joy in the presence of the Spirit to his own ministry. The connection of it with chairete, \"rejoice\" (v. 20), is purely coincidental. in. Whether one reads the prep. en with mss. M, D, L, E, 33 or omits it with mss. P 75 , A, B, C, K, W, ®,the sense is little affected. The English translation demands it in either case. The omission may be affected by the following phrase. In the LXX aga/liasthai is used both with the simple dat. and with preps. (en or epi). the holy Spirit. The def. art. to and the adj. hagio have been omitted in a number of mss. (P45 , A, W, t:i.., 'I') and various ancient versions; at times the prep. en is involved in this omission. See preceding NOTE. To omit it might seem to mean that Jesus found delight in (his own) spirit, i.e. internally. The omission would be supported by the fact that nowhere else in the Bible does one read of someone (even Jesus) finding delight or exulting in the holy Spirit. Yet that is also a reason for preferring \"the holy Spirit\" as the more difficult textual reading-which is actually better attested. See further TCGNT 152. Cf. 2:25,27; 4:1. The holy Spirit is to be understood as the source and inspiration of Jesus' joy and praise of the Father. See pp. 227-231. I praise you. I.e. I acknowledge you for what you are and extol you. Another possible translation is, \"I thank you.\" With the acc., the vb. exomologeisthai means \"admit, confess, acknowledge\" (someone or something); but with the dat., as here, the sense is \"praise, extol\" (as in 2 Sam 22:50; Pss 6:5; 9:1; 35:18; 45:17; 86:12; 118:28). In all these instances from the LXX, however, it translates the Hebrew hOdiih (hiphil of ydy), which often carries the further nuance of \"thank.\" Many of the Qumran Thanksgiving Psalms begin thus, 'wdkh 'dwny ky(~ . . . \"I praise/thank you, Lord, because ... \" (lQH 2:20,31; 3:19,37; 4:5; 7:26, etc.), using an OT formula. See Pss 18:50; 30:13; 35:18; 71:22-even with the conj. hoti ( = Hebrew ky), Pss 52:11; 57:10; 86:12; 108:5; 118:21. This sort oflaudatory formula, used of God, was well established in Palestinian Jewish tradition, from which it was borrowed by early Christians. See J. M. Robinson, \"Die Hodajot-Formel.\" Cf. 1 Cor 1:4-7, for an earlier Christian use of it. Whether the formula was \"cultic\" (T. Arvedsen), \"baptismal\" (M. Rist, \"ls Matt. 11:25-30 a Primitive Baptismal Hymn,\" JR 15 [1935) 63-77), or \"eucharistic\" (J.M.\n\n872\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§ IVA\n\nRobinson) need not detain us. The most striking Qumran parallel to the present text is found in lQH 7:26-27: \"I [give you thanks, 0 Lord], because you have given me insight into your truth and made known to me your marvellous mysteries and (given knowledge of) your kindnesses to a man [of wickedness, and of] the multitude of your mercies to one perverse in heart.\" Not only the wisdom-content of the saying but the form itself, coming from a pre-Christian Palestinian Jewish tradition, is revealing. Jesus' praise so expressed is a form of his prayer to God. See p. 245. Father. God has already been referred to as ho pater in sayings of Jesus: 6:36 (the disciples' Father) and 9:26 (Jesus probably referring to himself as the Son of Man, but not further explaining his relation to \"the Father\"). In this first saying, Jesus now addresses God as Father, using the voe. pater. as in 11:2. See NOTE there. At the beginning of the next sentence, the def. art. with the nom. case ho pater is substituted for the Greek voe. pater. The substitution is a literary variant, since the use of the def. art. with the nom. case for the voe. is known elsewhere in Greek. See BDF § 147.3; cf. Luke 8:54; 11:39; 18:11,13; John 13:13; Eph 5:14; Rev 6:10 within the NT. In addressing God as Father, Jesus moves with this formula beyond the Qumran acclamation of similar thrust, in which the title 'dwny, \"Lord,\" is normally used. See preceding NOTE. Though the sense of \"Father\" is not further explained, the mutuality of relationship implied in the terms \"son\" and \"father\" becomes clear in v. 22. On God as \"Father,\" see COMMENT on 11:1-4. Lord of heaven and earth. Though kai tes ges, \"and of earth,\" was omitted in ms. P 45 and in Marcion's version, it is to be retained, being found in the best Greek mss. and being a venerable Jewish formula. See also Acts 17:24. In Aramaic, it is found in lQapGen 22:16,21, miireh semayyii' we'ar'a: where it translates the Hebrew of Gen 14:19,22, q6neh siimayim wii'iire~. \"creator/maker of heaven and earth.\" Cf. Jdt 9: 12 (despota ton ouran6n kai tes ges); Tob 7:17 (ho kyrios tou ouranou kai tes ges [mss. B, A; ms. S reads simply ho kyrios tou ouranou-unfortunately the verse is not preserved in the Tobit frgs. of Qumran Cave 4; see J. T. Milik, \"La patrie de Tobie,\" RB 73 (1966) 522)). In later rabbinic writings it is found in further developed forms. See Str-B 2. 176. these things. To what tauta referred in the original saying is impossible to say. See W. Bousset, Kyrios Christos, 84-85 for a discussion of the matter. To leave it simply as \"the knowledge of God's will\" (J. M. Creed, The Gospel, 148) is too vague; similarly for \"the presence of the Kingdom\" (A. M. Hunter, \"Crux,\" 243). Because of the relation of this saying to the woes against the Galilean towns (10:13-15) in \"Q\" (see CoMMENT), Arvedsen maintained that \"these things\" were to be understood as part of an initiation formula of inclusion and exclusion in a mystery-liturgy which used ancient cultic blessings and curses such as one finds in Deut 27-28 or 11:13-21 (Das Mysterium, 77-104); but that explanation is too farfetched. The same context of a relation to the woes more rightly made W. D. Davies think that \"these things\" in Luke should be related to \"events of eschatological significance\" (the fate of the Galilean towns, the fall of Satan, and the inscribing of the disciples' names in heaven); see \"'Knowledge' in the Dead Sea Scrolls,\" 137-138. This also finds support in the beatitude of vv. 23-24. That tauta should have an eschatological connotation is not impossible here, but its eschatological significance must also include something about the relationship of the disciples to Jesus and of his relationship to God. This is the\n\n10:21-24\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n873\n\nburden of the immediately preceding context in the Lucan Gospel (e.g. 10:16), and it receives further clarification in the next verse, as well as in the beatitude of vv. 23-24. you have hidden . . . from the wise and intelligent. I.e. the learned ones of this world. Jesus' praise of the Father acknowledges that he has actually hidden \"these things\" from the wise. It ascribes to God an activity similar to the hardening of Pharaoh's heart (Exod 7:3). The vb. apekrypsas is the aor. indic. and cannot be interpreted as if it were a concessive ptc., \"although you have hidden,\" pace I. H. Marshall, Luke, 434. Further, it goes too far to equate the \"wise and the intelligent\" with \"the arrogant\" (so A. Oepke, TDNT 3. 973); that is too strong a nuance and is scarcely called for in the context. The last phrase in this lemma makes one think of Paul's strictures in l Cor l: 19-25 against the \"wise man\" and the \"scribe\" and of his appeal to Isa (29:14 [LXX]), where the adjs. sophos and synetos, used in Luke, are found in parallelism. The pair is often found in the OT wisdom-literature (Job 34:34; Prov 16:21; Qoh 9:11; Sir 3:29; 9:14-15; Hos 14:10). As used in this verse, it suggests that the wise and the intelligent, with all their learning, cannot fathom God's salvific activity, even when it is directed at them. For another attempt to explain this phrase, see G. Schwarz, \"Hoti ekrypsas tauta apo ... syneton,\" BN 9 (1979) 22-25. revealed them to small children. I.e. to infants (nepioi, persons incapable of proper human speech), the opposite of the wise and the intelligent in human society. Paul uses nepioi of immature Christians (1Cor3:1), but that is hardly the meaning in Luke. The word is rather to be understood in the LXX sense, where nepios sometimes translates Hebrew petf, \"simple\" (Pss 19:8; 116:6; 119:130), the childlike persons to whom the law would give understanding and enable them to open themselves to God. The same sense of peti/petii'im is found in Qumran literature. See lQH 2:9; frg. 15:4; llQPs• 18:2,4. See further J. Dupont, \"Les 'simples' (petdyim) dans la Bible et a Qumran: A propos des nepioi de Mt. 11,25; Le. 10,21,\" Studi sull'oriente e la Bibbia ojferti al P. Giovanni Rinaldi ... (Genoa: Studio e vita, 1967) 329-336. In the Lucan context the \"small children\" are the disciples, contrasted with the scribes and others of Jesus' ministry who do not listen to him (5:30: 15:2; 19:47). Though the idea of gods \"revealing\" things to human beings is not foreign to Greek religion, it is noteworthy that the vb. apokalyptein used in this verse and elsewhere (e.g. 12:2; 17:30) is not normally found in Greek literature for such activity; instead vbs. like epideiknynai, hypodeiknynai, or semainein are employed. See further A. Oepke, TDNT 3. 566. Jesus' words about the revelation of the Father stand in the OT tradition, in which the LXX uses apokalyptein to translate Hebrew giiliih, \"reveal.\" E.g. 1 Sam 3:7,21; Dan 2:19; 10:1 (Theodotion). Indeed. On the good Greek particle nai, see NOTE on 11:28. this has been your good pleasure. Lit. \"in this way good pleasure has taken shape (or has come into being) before you,\" a reverential way of speaking about God-what happens takes place in his presence. See BAGD 257. The cl. describes God's gracious and condescending action in regard to the elect in the matter of revelation. It has not been his good pleasure to reveal these things to everyone. The prepositional phrase emprosthen sou, \"before you\" (in a spatial sense), has its counterpart in the LXX, where it is used frequently with vbs. of motion (to place, lead, send, go [in, out], etc.), translating either Hebrew lipne and its compounds or Aramaic qodiim and its compounds. It occurs also in the LXX with ginesthai, \"to be, become,\" which is used here,\n\n874\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§IVA\n\nbut rather in a temporal sense. See 1 Kgs 3:12; 22:54; 2 Kgs 18:5. The closest one comes to the Lucan phraseology is 2 Chr 13:13, but there the sense of ginesthai in the LXX is different. Cf. 2 Chr 15:8. Luke uses the prep. emprosthen in 5:19; 7:27; 12:8; 14:2; 19:4,27,28; 21:36; Acts 10:4; 18:17. 22. All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. I.e. in my ministry and for the good of human beings. Again, to what pan ta referred in the original saying is difficult to say. It might be thought to refer to the totality of cosmic power and sovereignty implied in the title \"Lord of heaven and earth,\" with which Jesus has just hailed the Father, but it more likely refers to the knowledge of the mutual relation of himself and God, the content of the revelation gratuitously to be given. If this cognitive sense of panta is preferred, it is not to be forthwith understood of the eternal relations of the Trinity, such as would emerge in later Christian theology. The Lucan formulation, \"who the Son is\" and \"who the Father is\" already represents a later development beyond the Matthean form of the saying. Jesus is depicted as one who has received from the Father, and what he has received he passes on; and since only he does, this implies that his sonship is unique. The vb. is paradidonai, often used of passing on a traditional teaching. See 1 Cor 11:23; 15:3; cf. B. Gerhardsson, Memory and Manuscript (ASNU 22; Lund: Gleerup, 1961) 288-302. At the beginning of this verse in some mss. (A, C, K, W, X, tl, 0, l{I, etc.) one finds the phrase \"and turning to the disciples, he said.\" But it is omitted by better mss. (P45 , P75 , M, B, D, L, E, etc.). It is almost certainly derived secondarily from the beginning of v. 23. An echo of Jesus' words is found in Gos. of Thom.§ 6lb: \"To me were given some of the things of my Father.\" Seep. 86. No one knows who the Son is but the Father. The intimate relationship of Father and Son is known only to those involved-and to those to whom it is eventually revealed by one who is involved in that relationship. This relationship stresses the uniqueness of the sonship enjoyed by Jesus. Even if the NT elsewhere refers to Christians as \"sons of God\" (Gal 3:26; Rom 8: 19), what is stated here about Jesus' own sonship implies a difference. Note that in this one verse Jesus refers to himself three times absolutely as \"the Son.\" Seep. 205. Cf. Mark 13:32; Matt 24:36; 28:19; John 3:35,36; 5:19-26; 6:40; 8:36; 14:13; 17:1. For the negative expression, \"no one . . . but\"(= \"any\"), see 4:26-27; 18:19. Cf. ZBG § 469-470. who the Father is but the Son. Antithetic parallelism exists between this cl. and the preceding. The uniqueness of the knowledge of the relationship implies the uniqueness of the relationship itself. or the one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. The pronominal obj. of the vb. is lacking in the Greek text; it has to be supplied and is to be understood as referring to the Father, not to \"himself,\" pace P. Winter, \"Mt XI 27,\" 131. If the vb. were middle, the revelation of Jesus himself might be possible, but it is act. 23. Turning to the disciples. Luke uses the aor. pass. ptc. strapheis (in an intrans. sense) with pros and the acc., as in 7:44; 23:28. privately. See NOTE on 9:10. Blessed are the eyes that see what you s_ee/ For a beatitude pronounced over a part of\n\n10:21-24\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n875\n\nthe body, see NOTE on 6:20. The beatitude expresses the privileged role of the disciples as eyewitnesses; they are the ones who will be called upon to be witnesses to him after his ascension. See R. J. Dillon, Eye-witnesses, 270, 291. Seep. 243. 24. 1 tell you. Most Greek mss. read /ego gar hymin, \"for I tell you,\" but the conj. gar is omitted by ms. p 7 s and a few others. Its force is not causal or inferential, but merely transitional. In the Matthean counterpart (13:17) the original reading of \"Q\" is retained, amen gar /ego hymin-one of the instances in which Luke has omitted amen. many prophets and kings have wanted to see what you now see. The eschatological secrets that the disciples as \"little children\" now see and hear were perceived neither by earthly kings nor even by the prophets of old who longed to see them. The Lucan Jesus thus plays on the theme of fulfillment; it will appear again in 24:25,44. Cf. 1 Pet 1:10-12. The Johannine Jesus speaks in a different vein of Abraham (8:56) and of Isaiah (12:41). to hear what you hear. I.e. that the age of God's new mode of salvation has been proclaimed. This is why the disciples' ears are \"blessed.\" Cf. J. Horst, TDNT6. 553.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n(10:21-24)\n\nArvedsen, T.

THE COMMANDMENT FOR ETERNAL LIFE (10:25-28)\n\n10 25 Once a lawyer stood up, trying to test Jesus with a question, \"Teacher, what am I to do to inherit eternal life?\" 26 Jesus said to him, \"What is written in the Law? How do you read it?\" 27 He said in reply, \"You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your might, 8 and with all your mind; and you must love your neighbor as yourself.\"b 28 Jesus then said to him, \"You have answered correctly; do this and you shall live.\" a\n\nDeut 6:5\n\nb\n\nLev 19:18\n\n10:25-28\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n877\n\nCOMMENT\n\nJesus has just contrasted the disciples as \"small children\" with \"the wise and intelligent\" (10:21). Now Luke's continuing narrative (10:25-28) in the travel account introduces one of the latter to question Jesus and test his teaching. The beatitude pronounced over the disciples who have seen and heard is now followed with a parenetic counsel about eternal life, a counsel about the practical love of God and of one's neighbor. At first, the episode (vv. 25-28) seems to resemble Mark 12:28-31 ( = Matt 22:34-40) in that in both Mark/Matthew and Luke someone questions Jesus and two verses from the OT (Deut 6:5 and Lev 19: 18) are joined in an answer. Moreover, Luke has omitted the counterpart of Mark 12:28-34 at 20:40 (avoiding a doublet? [see p. 81]). In the Marean episode a Scribe asks Jesus which commandment is the first of all; the Matthean setting is similar, but the scene is more elaborate and the questioner is a \"lawyer.\" In both Mark and Matthew Jesus answers, making Deut 6:5 the first and Lev 19:18 the second commandment. In Mark the Scribe further comments on Jesus' answer. Luke, however, depicts a \"lawyer\" asking Jesus about eternal life and Jesus countering with a question which draws forth from the lawyer the double quotation ofDeut 6:5 and Lev 19:18, to which Jesus answers with a confirmation. A further question (v. 29) from the lawyer closely connects this episode with the following (vv. 30-37). Moreover, the lawyer's initial question is found echoed in Luke 18:18, posed by a \"magistrate,\" which introduces a different story about commandments of the Decalogue. Thus the initial, seeming similarity of the Marean and Lucan episodes soon gives way to the impression that one may be dealing with different traditions or perhaps different incidents in the life of Jesus. Some commentators think that Luke may have reworked the Marean episode to make it the introduction to his story about the good Samaritan (so G. Schneider, Evangelium nach Lukas, 247; J. Schmid, Evangelium nach Lukas, 190-191; E. Klostermann, Lukasevangelium, 118). Others, because of a number of small agreements in the Lucan story with those of Matthew (e.g. \"lawyer,\" \"teacher,\" \"in the law,\" the omission of Deut 6:4 [see T. Schramm, Markus-Stoff, 47 n. 4]), think that Luke has substituted here a form of the episode that existed in \"Q,\" and which Matthew used in his reworking of the Marean form (so HST 22-23; F. W. Beare, The Earliest Records of Jesus [Oxford: Blackwell, 1962] 159). But the whole form of this episode in the Lucan Gospel is so different from the Marean story that it should rather be ascribed to \"L.\" The use of \"lawyer\" instead of \"one of the Scribes\" and the omission of the first part of the Sberna' (Deut 6:4; cf. Mark 12:29b) could easily be explained by Luke's re-\n\n878\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§IVA\n\ndactional concern for the predominantly Gentile audience for whom he was writing, if these elements were really part of his inherited story. Luke may, however, be influenced by \"Mk\" (see T. Schramm, Markus-Stoff, 49). Whether the Marean and the Lucan forms of the story go back to the same incident in the ministry of Jesus is hard to say. There is no need to appeal to Jesus' \"repeating\" of the same teaching in various ways, pace T. W. Manson Sayings, 260; cf. I. H. Marshall, Luke, 441. It is more likely that the different forms of the one questioning of Jesus about important commandments of the Law which exist in the gospel tradition emerged in the post-Easter transmission of what he did and said (cf. J. Jeremias, Die Sprache, 190). As the episode stands in the Lucan Gospel, it is to be form-critically regarded as a pronouncement-story. R. Bultmann (HST 51) notes that whereas the Marean story (12:28-34) takes the form of a school debate, in which the answerer is praised at the end, the Lucan story has become a controversy dialogue, in which Jesus' first answer is really a counter-question and his final comment merely confirms the lawyer's response. Jesus' final comment, \"Do this and you shall live,\" is actually a weak pronouncement, and the cutting edge in the episode is rather the lawyer's answer. That, of course, becomes Jesus' pronouncement too, by virtue of his confirmation. Jesus' counter-question elicits from the lawyer two commands from the Mosaic Law, the first taken from the expanded Shema' (Deut 6:4-9), which the faithful Jew was to recite twice a day (see Deut 6:7; cf. m. Ber. 1:1-4), and the second from Lev 19: 18. The first command insisted on the absolute love of Yahweh in a total personal response; the three (or four) faculties (heart, soul, might, [and mind]) were meant to sum up the totality of undivided dedication to him. The second command, which is quite distinct in the OT, being derived from the so-called Holiness Code of Leviticus (chaps. 17-26), enjoins the Israelite to love his \"neighbor,\" i.e. his fellow Israelite. In effect, it demands of the Israelite the same attitude toward one's neighbor as toward Yahweh himself. The love of Yahweh was commended particularly in the deuteronomic writings (see Deut 11:13,22; 19:9; 30:16; cf. Josh 22:5; 23:11; W. L. Moran,\"The Ancient Near Eastern Background of the Love of God in Deuteronomy,\" CBQ 25 (1963] 77-87; G. Wallis, TDOT 1. 101-118). Jesus' confirmation of the lawyer's double response makes the double commandment of love into a norm for the conduct of the Christian disciple. No love of God is complete without that of one's neighbor. Jesus' parenetic counsel is given, then, in OT terminology, and the following episode will attempt to define who the \"neighbor\" is. But it must be recalled that the Lucan Jesus, in his sermon on the plain, has already insisted on the love of one's enemies (6:27-35). Elsewhere in the NT, Christians are enjoined to love their neighbors by writers who also appeal to Lev 19:18 (see Gal 5:14; Rom 13:9; Jas 2:8-where the love of the neighbor is regard~ as the summation of the Mosaic Law). In\n\n10:25-28\n\nIV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n879\n\nthis Lucan episode, however, it is joined to the counsel of the total personal love of God himself, as it is also in the Marean and Matthean episodes. Because the joining of the two commands is found on Jesus' lips in the Marean and Matthean stories and on a lawyer's lips in this Lucan episode, the question has been raised about the occurrence of the joint command in pre-Christian Judaism. Was the double commandment a teaching of the rabbis already in Jesus' day? A form of the double command is found in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs: In the T. lssachar 5:2, \"Love the Lord and the neighbor\"; in T. Dan 5:3, \"Love the Lord with all your life and each other with a true heart\"; cf. T. lssachar 7:6. Though it is now known that some parts of this writing, preserved in its entirety only in Greek, did exist in Semitic form in pre-Christian Palestinian Judaism (e.g. 4QTLevi, 4QTNaph, 4QTBenj [as yet in great part unpublished]), nothing is known about the T. Dan or T. lssachar in this period. Moreover, the Greek form of the Testaments has usually been suspected of Christian interpolations. Hence appeal cannot be made to such writings without further ado. However, a form of it may be couched by Philo of Alexandria in terms of Greek virtues in the following comment: \"Among the great number of particular propositions and principles [studied in Sabbath schools], two, as it were, stand as preeminent topics: one of duty toward God in piety and holiness (eusebeia kai hosiotes), one of duty toward human beings in generosity and justice (phi/anthropia kai dikaiosyne)\" (De spec. leg. 2.15 § 63). But whether this is a reflection of the uniting of Deut 6:5 and Lev 19: 18 is another matter. The double form is, however, attested later in Christian writings, which is not surprising (see Did. 1:2; Barn. 19:2,5; Justin, Dial. 93:2-3; Mart. Pol. 3:3). (See further G. Bornkamm, \"Das Doppelgebot\"; C. Burchard, \"Das doppelte Liebesgebot.\") Whether one can establish the preexistence of the double command in prior Jewish tradition or not, it stands here so formulated, and what is significant is that it is presented as a \"reading\" of the \"Law.\" In effect, the Lucan Jesus finds the basic counsel of Christian life in the words of Scripture itself, \"Do this and you shall live,'' or in this you shall find life eternal. The different forms which the love-command takes in the gospel tradition suggest finally that Jesus himself was the catalyst for the development of the double command in the Christian tradition.\n\nNOTES\n\n10 25.

The phrase reveals a hostile attitude. Contrast Mark 12:28. Teacher. The address and the question echo that put to John the Baptist in 3:10,12. See NOTES there. to inherit eternal life? The question appears again in Luke 18:18. See NoTE there. It is sparked in a Jewish mind by Dan 12:2: \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to life eternal, some to shame and eternal disgrace.\" Both the LXX and Theodotion's Greek read zoen aionion. Cf. 4 Mace 15:3. The question put to Jesus makes its own contribution to the Lucan treatment of an important effect of the . Christ-event in his writings. See p. 222. In Mark 12:28 the concern is with the Mosaic Law; here in Luke the question is phrased more generally to suit readers not concerned with the Law. Cf. Acts 16:30. 26. Jesus. The name is supplied in my translation; the Greek text has simply, \"and he said.\" What is written in the Law? See Luke 2:23. \"Law\" is a reference to the Tarah of Moses; the lawyer's answer draws two passages from the Pentateuch. How do you read it? See 4: 16; 6:3; Acts 8:28,30,32; 13:27; 15:21 for the Lucan use of anaginoskein for \"reading\" of the Scriptures (or Moses). 27. He said in reply. Luke uses the Septuagintal formula apokritheis eipen. See p. 114. You must love the Lord your God . . . The lawyer at first quotes Deut 6:5; the Lucan text of which agrees with the LXX, save for the addition of \"and with all your mind\" (in the fourth place), the substitution of ischys for dynamis (in the third prepositional phrase), and the substitution of the prep. en ( + dat.) for ex ( + gen.) in the last three phrases. The LXX actually has the prep. ex in all phrases. Some mss. of Luke (A, C, W, 8, 'I', and the Koine text-tradition) have ex in all instances; but that is probably the result of a copyist's harmonization with the LXX. The original Hebrew of Deut 6:5 has only three phrases (heart, soul, might). A corrector of ms. B of the LXX has introduced dianoia, \"mind,\" for kardia, \"heart.\" Mark 12:30 also has four phrases, but in a different order ( = Lucan l, 2, 4, 3); Matt 22:37 has only three ( = Lucan l, 2, 4). Where the fourth phrase comes from is not clear. See further K. J. Thomas, \"Liturgical Citations.\" The aspects of the human person so expressed have to be understood in the OT sense: kardia, \"heart,\" as denoting the more responsive and emotional reactions of a human being; psyche, \"soul,\" the vitality and consciousness of a person; ischys, \"might,\" the powerful and instinctive drive; and dianoia, \"mind,\" the intelligent and planning qualities. As a group, they sum up the totality of personal life. In the OT quotation kyrios refers here to Yahweh. Seep. 201. your neighbor as yourself. The lawyer's second response joins Lev 19: 18b to the first, but as a unit. It is quoted verbatim according to the LXX, which agrees with the Hebrew (my translation has repeated the vb., \"you must love,\" which is not in the Lucan Greek text). One is to have the same esteem and care for a neighbor that one would have for oneself. In Leviticua \"neighbor\" stands in parallelism with \"the chi!-\n\n10:25-28\n\nJV. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n881\n\ndren of your own people,\" i.e. fellow Israelites. The love is eventually extended in Lev 19:34 to the \"sojourner\" (ger) in the land (cf. Deut 10:19), but not to others, e.g. g6yfm. See Str-B 1. 353-354. The Essenes ofQumran were \"to love all the sons oflight . . . and hate all the sons of darkness\"; lQS 1:9-10; also 2:24; 5:25; lQM 1:1. Cf. Josephus, J. W. 2.8,7 § 139. The \"sons of light\" were members of their own community. 28. JVu have answered co\"ectly. See Luke 7:43. Jesus can only agree with the Law and the lawyer's quoting of it. do this and you shall live. I.e. find eternal life. See v. 25. Only the person who puts the command of love into practice will find life. The vb. zese may allude to Lev 18:5, which promises life to the person who obeys Yahweh's statutes and ordinances. Cf. Gal 3:12. Jesus' words thus add a counsel of practice to the theoretic recognition of the love-commands in the Torah. Addressed to the Christian reader, they form part of Lucan parenesis.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n(10:25-28)\n\nBornkamm, G. \"Das Doppelgebot der Liebe,\" Neutestamentliche Studien (ed. W. Eltester) 85-93.

They stripped him, beat him, and went off leaving him half-dead. 31 Now by coincidence a priest was going down that same road; when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32 Similarly, a levite also came upon that place, saw him, and passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan who was on a journey came upon him. When he saw him, he was moved to pity. 34 He went up and bandaged his wounds, pouring olive oil and wine over them. He set him on his own mount, led him to a public inn, and made provision for him there. 35 The next day he took out two pieces of silver, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, 'Provide for him, and on my way back I shall reimburse you for whatever you spend over and above this.' 36 Which of these three seems to you to have been neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?\" 37 He answered, \"The one who showed him kindness.\" So Jesus said to him, \"Go and do the same yourself.\"\n\nCOMMENT\n\nThis episode in the Lucan travel account (10:29-37) is intimately connected with the preceding one by the introductory question put by the lawyer to Jesus, \"But who is my neighbor?\" Jesus' answer to it is provided in the story of the good Samaritan. The story is recorded only in the Lucan Gospel and, apart from the introductory verse, which is most likely of Lucan composition and fashioned by him to join this story to the prec.eding episode, it comes to the evangelist from\n\n10:29-37\n\nIV.\n\nTHE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\n\n883\n\nhis private source \"L.\" Only secondarily has it been joined to the preceding, since it does not really answer the lawyer's second question. It is one of the parables of mercy (see p. 258) which give this Gospel a distinctive tone and help to create a distinctive Lucan picture of Jesus. The concluding remark of Jesus in v. 37 may be a Lucan redactional addition. (Cf. J. Jeremias, Die Sprache, 190-193.) From a form-critical point of view, it has often been called a parable. But the text lacks this customary appellation (contrast 12:16; 18:9) and would be so understood only in a generic sense of parabole (see NOTE on 5:36). The concluding words of Jesus (v. 37) use homoi6s, \"likewise, in the same way,'' and suggest a comparison of the lawyer and the Samaritan; they thus make of this story indirectly a parable or an extended simile. The point of the story, however, is made without the concluding remark of Jesus. Like a few other distinctive Lucan stories (12:16-21; 16:19-31; 18:9-14), it is better understood as an \"example\" (in rhetoric, exemplum). It supplies a practical model for Christian conduct with radical demands and the approval/rejection of certain modes of action. The point of the story is not conveyed by some analogy to a spiritual truth, but by the narrative thrust of the \"example\" itself. The storytelling devices are to be noted in the episode: the threesome in the dramatis personae (the priest, the levite, and the Samaritan [like the Englishman, the Irishman, the Scotsman]); the Palestinian details (olive oil, wine, animal, and inn); the answer of the Jewish lawyer, which studiously avoids saying \"the Samaritan\" and uses only \"the one who showed him kindness\"; and a certain in-built improbability (would a Jew normally regard a Samaritan as a model of kindness, picture him traveling in Judea, or think that a Judean innkeeper would trust him?-to query in this way, however, is to miss the point of the story). To argue that \"the narrative is not fiction, but history,\" because Jesus would not speak against priests or levites (so A. Plummer, The Gospel, 285-286) is to miss the thrust of the narrative. Crucial to the understanding of the story which Jesus tells (vv. 30-35) are certain noteworthy details: (1) The privileged status of the priest and the levite in Palestinian Jewish society-their levitical and/or Aaronic heritage, which associated them intimately with the Temple cult and the heart of Jewish life as worship of Yahweh. New light has been shed on this in the Temple Scroll from Qumran Cave 11 (see NOTE on 10:32). (2) The defilement considered to be derived from contact with a dead (or apparently dead) body (see NOTE on 10:31); this affected those of the priestly and levitical status more seriously than other Jews. (3) The attitude shared by Palestinian Jews concerning the Samaritans, summed up so well in the Johannine comment, \"Jews, remember, use nothing in common with Samaritans\" (John 4:9; see CoMMENT and NOTES on 9:52-53). Their history made them schismatics in the eyes of the Jews, and relations with them have been exemplified in the lack of welcome accorded Jesus and his disciples in 9:52-54 as they tried to\n\n884\n\nLUKE X-XXIV\n\n§ IVA\n\npass through Samaritan territory. These details underlie the story's basic contrast: the pity and kindness shown by a schismatic Samaritan to an unfortunate, mistre"
