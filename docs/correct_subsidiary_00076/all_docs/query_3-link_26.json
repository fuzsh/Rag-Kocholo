The particles in each category differ in size, this is called the Particle Size Distribution. Sophisticated electronic laboratory equipment (Laser diffraction technology)measures the PSD of bridging materials in drilling fluids, and the concentrations of these materials can then be adjusted to suit the formation being drilled in order to produce a low permeability filter cake. Common particle size ranges for CARB Bridging Material grades are as follows: - Fine: 5 to 400 microns - Medium: 100 to 1000 microns - Coarse: 60 to 2500 microns - Ground Marble Grade E: 1 - 160 micron Most Barite particles range from 2 to 44 microns and will therefore provide effective bridging for pore throat sizes ranging up to 132 microns, so pore sizes above this will require LCM bridging materials. Based on the relationship between pore size and permeability, A 2-micron Barite particles will theoretically bridge 6-micron pore throats, which equate to a 36 milli-Darcy permeability. Similarly, 44-micron Barite particles will theoretically bridge 132-micron pore throats, which equate to a 17,424 milli-Darcy (i.e. 17 Darcy) permeability. The PSD for Barite includes particles that are larger than 44 microns, so Barite is therefore effective for bridging high permeability sands before whole mud starts to be lost to the formation. As a general guideline, whole mud losses do not occur in formations with permeabilities below 50 Darcies when Barite is used as a weighting agent. #drilling #drillingfluids #particlesize #LCM #mudengineer\n\nKhutbah is an Arabic word that means sermon and is commonly used to refer to the Friday khutbah, which is done before the Jumu'ah prayer (Friday noon prayer). It is a key component of Jumu'ah, and is considered a replacement for the two rak'ahs that are usually read for Zuhur (noon prayer).
