The original conference that inspired this volume met in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford in March 2005, under the title “The Religion of ‘The Rest’: Heresy, Apathy and Popular Piety in Late Antiquity”. The conference was organised jointly by Luke Lavan, Bryan Ward-Perkins and Susanne Bangert, and our sincere thanks go to them and to the audiences who attended, as well of course to the contributors who have made this volume possible. Our thanks also go out to the many people with whom we have discussed different aspects of this project for their advice and encouragement, and to the referees who must remain anonymous but who gave of their time to read the articles contained here and offer many helpful comments. The British Academy, the Craven Fund and the History Faculty of the University of Oxford generously supported the original conference. Finally, Marcella Mulder and Brill have continued to support Late Antique Archaeology across the years, and in what has at times been a slow editorial process we are grateful for their patience and assistance in seeing this volume into the light.\n\nLIST OF CONTRIBUTORS Susanne Bangert is Museum Inspector, Naestved Museum, Denmark.

Gwynn and Susanne Bangert The place of religion in the world of Late Antiquity, no less than in our modern world, has been the subject of great debate in recent years. Late Antiquity was a period of diversity and change. The 3rd to the 7th c. A.D. witnessed the transformation of the classical Mediterranean, the emergence of a Christian Roman Empire, the collapse of Roman imperial power in the west, and the rise of new and evolving social, political and religious concepts and structures. Archaeology has been at the forefront of many recent advances in our knowledge of this complex age of transition. In this volume recent research by archaeologists and religious and literary historians is drawn together in an inter-disciplinary approach that sheds new light on the remarkable religious diversity of Late Antiquity and its significance for our understanding of this period and of the place of religion in the evolution of the ancient and medieval worlds. Late antique religion embraced a vast spectrum of faiths, cults and practices. Graeco-Roman pagans, Christians, Jews, Samaritans, Zoroastrians, Manichaeans, and more co-existed and both helped to shape and were shaped by these centuries of change. In this age of religious interaction and conflict, identity and self-definition attained a new importance and religions underwent a process of codification and canonisation, a process perhaps best attested by, but by no means limited to, the Christian Church and rabbinic Judaism. Yet this very emphasis upon definition itself created ever-increasing diversity, both between religions and also within religions, for no single interpretation would ever receive universal acceptance from all those who claimed to belong to a given faith or cult. ‘Orthodoxy’ and ‘heresy’ are above all Christian concepts, but divisions existed within all late antique religions, while the same diversity characterised religious practices common to all, including pilgrimage, asceticism and magic. Only through the integration of archaeological and textual sources can that diversity be fully revealed and explored. A comprehensive survey of late antique religion is beyond the scope of this book, and the nature of D. Gwynn, S. Bangert (edd.) Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity (Late Antique Archaeology 6 – 2008) (Leiden 2010), pp. 1–12\n\n2\n\ndavid m. gwynn and susanne bangert\n\nLate Roman paganism will be the focus of the companion volume Late Antique Archaeology 7: The Archaeology of Late Antique ‘Paganism’, while for further research the reader is also directed to the bibliographic essay that follows this introduction. The articles presented here instead offer a demonstration of what can be achieved through the exploitation of material and literary evidence in concert to reveal the religious diversity of this fundamental period in history, diversity which must in turn be set within the wider social, economic and political world of Late Antiquity. Archaeology and Religion The relationship between archaeology and the study of religion has not always been smooth. Archaeologists have at times placed religion and religious belief on the fringes of their research, preferring to focus on economic and social structures, production and settlement. Religious scholars have on occasion been equally guilty of ignoring or underestimating the significance of material evidence in comparison to texts which inevitably suffer from their own biases and limitations. Such judgements are of course easy to generalise, and archaeology and religion have always existed in close proximity. In certain fields the role of archaeology has long been recognised as fundamental, including the quest for biblical history and the origins of Christianity and Judaism, and the excavation and study of great sites and monuments of all religions and denominations. However, the methodological problems raised by the archaeology of religion have still not received sufficient analysis, particularly within the field of late antique scholarship. If we are to bring archaeology and religious studies fully into the scholarly mainstream where they belong, then ongoing cooperation between academics of different backgrounds is essential. This is reflected in the articles in this volume, and further consideration must be given to how archaeological and literary evidence may best work together to illuminate religious belief and practice in a world as diverse as Late Antiquity. The need to integrate the varied and at times conflicting evidence of material culture and texts is obviously not restricted to the archaeology of religion. Yet the unique pressures that impact upon the study of religion raise this problem in a particularly acute form and no simple answer will suffice. To speak of the ‘superiority’ or ‘priority’ of one\n\nreligious diversity in late antiquity: an introduction\n\n3\n\nform of evidence over another rests on common but often misguided assumptions, and the strengths and weaknesses of different types of evidence must always be held in mind and applied to the specific context and subject under discussion. This may appear to be (and is) stating the obvious, but such elementary principles are all too easily ignored or forgotten. It does not seem out of place in the introduction to this volume to provide a brief overview of those respective strengths and weaknesses and their significance for the study of religious diversity. In the western world, the privileged form of evidence for the history of religion has traditionally been the text. This is in part a reflection of the Judaeo-Christian background of most western scholarly traditions, a background which rests on the authority of Scripture and the written word and within which some denominations at least have questioned the role of religious art and monumental architecture. Christianity in particular also privileges religious belief over precise ritual and it is our literary sources that provide our greatest insight into personal belief in earlier periods of history. It is thus not difficult to understand why archaeology has at times been marginalised by religious historians for whom what an individual believed takes precedence over the physical setting in which that individual lived and worshipped. In this tradition the role of archaeology is to provide material to support our authoritative texts, and the interpretation of that material is approached through the lens of the textual sources. This dependence upon literary evidence for the interpretation of archaeology inevitably raises certain problems for the study of religion as for other fields of history. Literary sources of course have their own marked limitations, and while these limitations are widely recognised their implications are not always fully appreciated. At a very basic level, texts normally reveal the attitudes and beliefs only of those who are literate, which in Late Antiquity is not a large proportion of society. They are also open to the biases of individual authors, who often wrote in times of controversy and in highly polemical terms. Most significantly for our present purposes, however, the religious writings that survive primarily represent the voices of those whose authority was upheld by what would become established as the accepted tradition within a given religion. The process of definition and codification that characterised both Christianity and Judaism in Late Antiquity also sought to exclude those who fell outside the lines that were being drawn. Whether through the deliberate destruction of their works, or through the more passive neglect of writings not selected to be\n\n4\n\ndavid m. gwynn and susanne bangert\n\npreserved and copied for later generations, little now survives in our literary record from those denounced as Christian ‘heretics’ or from Jewish groups whose practices differed from rabbinic principles. The loss of so much evidence significantly exaggerates the uniformity and dominance of Christian orthodoxy and rabbinic Judaism in the late antique world in which those traditions only gradually emerged, and so in turn distorts our understanding of that world when viewed through the selective texts that now survive. The strengths and weaknesses of archaeology for a historian of religion are no less marked but are in many respects very different, and so the need for cooperation becomes self-evident. Whereas religious texts are individual and tied to contexts and controversies that can usually be identified, archaeological evidence extends far more widely socially, geographically and chronologically. It is true that archaeology is in general inadequate to reveal personal religious belief, and is severely limited in its application to specific religious debates and controversies (see for example the articles of Gwynn and Ward-Perkins in this volume on the archaeology of the ‘Arian’ heresy). Yet archaeology reveals a broader vision of society than does the literary evidence, and as has been rightly emphasised in recent years the older prioritisation of religious belief over physical setting rests on a serious misconception. The physical environment in which religion takes place is never merely a reflection of belief or practice, but itself directly impacts upon beliefs and practices and how they are understood and expressed. The study of architecture, artefacts and topography and their role in the development of Jewish and Christian liturgy in Late Antiquity has borne this out. Here as elsewhere, the physical and textual evidence must be approached in dialogue, without pre-assumed priority of one category over the other. Archaeology also retains the capacity to surprise. New excavations and surveys continue across the late antique world, and new discoveries are constantly adding to our knowledge and forcing us to revise previous theories. The discovery of the decorated church and synagogue of Dura Europus on the Euphrates in the 1920s and 1930s rewrote the history of Jewish and Christian art and architecture, and in more recent years no less remarkable finds both inside and beyond the frontiers of the Later Roman Empire have transformed our awareness of a number of religious groups marginalised in our literary record. The important sect of the Samaritans has received increasing attention from archaeologists in Israel (for a survey of current research see\n\nreligious diversity in late antiquity: an introduction\n\n5\n\nthe article of Dar). The Church of the East (once wrongly known as the ‘Nestorian’ Church) has been traced as far as China, as have the Manichaeans whose settlements in Central Asia lasted into medieval times. These recent discoveries have also revealed new textual sources, both epigraphic and literary, and underline again the need for scholarly approaches to continue to evolve to integrate the new evidence and not become bound by assumptions and models that cannot adapt to our ever-changing understanding of the past. Above all in the context of this volume, archaeological evidence, through its breadth and through its very independence from the traditions that dominate our literary sources, reveals the true diversity of religion in Late Antiquity. Of course, this is not to suggest that archaeology too has not been coloured by those dominant traditions, which have influenced both the sites selected for excavation and survey and the interpretation of the data recovered from those sites. The emphasis upon Christianity and on church and monastic sites in much western archaeology reflects this bias, as does the history of Jewish archaeology in Israel. Nevertheless, archaeologists have increasingly recognised the limitations of such approaches and the need to set religious material culture within its wider historical and social context. The breadth of archaeological material now coming to light must be viewed not through the lens of our texts but as an essential primary source in its own right, which through comparison and contrast to the literary evidence opens new directions for research and a new appreciation for the complexity of the late antique world. Diversity, Identity and ‘Orthodoxy’ Archaeological discovery and the ongoing reassessment of older literary and material evidence continue to reinforce the diversity of late antique religion. Graeco-Roman paganism was always by nature diverse, for paganism as a religious ‘system’ is primarily a Christian construct, uniting all the widely varied classical cults and practices which Christianity rejected within a single polemical collective. The Roman state cults came under increasing pressure from Christian emperors following the conversion of Constantine (306–37), but at a local and rural level paganism continued in many different forms for centuries (see further the articles presented in Late Antique Archaeology 7). Judaism and Christianity both imposed a stronger sense of religious\n\n6\n\ndavid m. gwynn and susanne bangert\n\nidentity upon their adherents, not least through their efforts to separate themselves from the surrounding pagan environment, although pagan practices and material culture nevertheless exerted a strong influence on them. Yet here too diversity is never hard to find. Ancient Judaism incorporated a variety of sects and teachings, including the Pharisees and Sadducees of the time of Christ, while further differences inevitably emerged between the Jews in Israel and the Jews of the wider Diaspora. Christian divisions similarly existed from the very origins of the Christ movement, and local and regional differences played a major role in Christian controversies from the second century rift between Rome and Asia Minor over the date of Easter to the great theological debates of the 4th and 5th c., which ultimately saw many of the Christians of Syria and Egypt separate from those of Constantinople and Rome. Even smaller religious followings such as the Manichaeans likewise exhibit such differences, perhaps unsurprising in a sect that extended from Roman North Africa to the Chinese Empire. For the historian of Late Antiquity, terms such as paganism, Judaism and Christianity must therefore be used with a certain degree of care. Individual pagans, Jews and Christians could hold widely varying interpretations of their proclaimed religion, and collective labels can easily conceal these deep differences. The same diversity can also be traced in a variety of practices common to all late antique religions, practices which invariably had roots in earlier times but whose prominence and significance increased dramatically in this period. Asceticism, so often studied in a Christian context, also exerted a strong influence on pagans, Jews and Manichaeans and took many forms, from the urban philosopher or desert hermit to collective monasticism (for the extreme example of the Christian stylite or pillar-saint see the article by Schachner). The cult of the holy man is another late antique phenomenon traditionally associated with Christianity whose diversity across and within different religions has increasingly been recognised. The same holds true for pilgrimage, which also had pagan and Jewish roots but which gained far greater significance with the rise of Christianity from the 4th c. onwards, and yet varied widely by region and by location, as Bangert demonstrates elsewhere in this volume. Alongside these practices, all of which gained a degree of acceptance within Jewish and Christian tradition, other customs continued which again extended across religious divisions in different forms but which were condemned by many authorities as ‘magic’ rather than correct religion. The separation of magic and religion is far from being as\n\nreligious diversity in late antiquity: an introduction\n\n7\n\nstraightforward as our official sources would like to imply, and magic held an important place in late antique hearts and minds, as is discussed further here in the articles of Karivieri and Sfameni. The existence of such diversity of religious belief and practice was a source of potential tension for those religions which upheld unity and uniformity as their ideal. This was not the case for the majority of pagans, although some did seek an over-arching structure for their many cults and deities, an aim visible in the unsuccessful religious reforms of Julian ‘the Apostate’, the last pagan Roman emperor (361–63). The challenge facing Jews and Christians, however, was more urgent, and Late Antiquity was to prove a period of fundamental importance to the identity and self-definition of both religions. The destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in A.D. 70 and the defeat of the Bar-Kochba revolt in A.D. 135 forced Judaism to redefine itself, a need made ever-greater by the rise of Christianity. This set the background for the emergence of rabbinic Judaism, as the teachings of the rabbis gradually became recognised as the authoritative voice of Jewish religion. Like the Jews, Christians too had always possessed a sense of collective identity, but with the conversion of Constantine and the growing relationship between the imperial state and the Church from the 4th c. onwards that identity became a matter of still greater importance. The Christian Empire offered imperial patronage to those who accepted the approved orthodoxy in belief and practice and the threat of persecution (albeit with limited practical effect) to those who did not, together with the structures required to define that orthodoxy at an empire-wide level through the ecumenical council (of which the first met at Nicaea under Constantine in 325) and imperial law. It was a shift that was to have major consequences, both positive and negative, for the history of Christianity and Christendom. The construction and expression of religious identity was thus a characteristic feature of the late antique period and is visible in every area of religious life. The Jewish and Christian Scriptures were codified and their meaning expounded through rabbinic exegesis and Christian creeds and doctrinal debates. The status of those who had the right to interpret Scripture and conduct worship was more clearly marked, although tensions continued to exist as between the authority of the clergy and the charismatic influence of monks or holy men. The Christian basilica and the Jewish synagogue took on recognised forms and the liturgical ceremonies within those buildings and in wider urban and rural contexts were more structured and formulaic.\n\n8\n\ndavid m. gwynn and susanne bangert\n\nYet even within imperial Christianity this process of religious definition could never universally be achieved, and the biases of our sources greatly exaggerate the uniformity of both rabbinic Judaism and the Christian Church in Late Antiquity. As we have already seen, this is an area in which archaeology must play a crucial role, highlighting the diversity that texts can so easily conceal. In older scholarship, late antique Judaism is often defined purely as rabbinic Judaism, for it is this conception of Judaism which almost entirely dominates the surviving literary sources, most notably the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. Yet such an approach requires one to assume that the diversity that characterised Judaism into the first century A.D. ceased after A.D. 70, and this assumption has been rightly challenged. Not all late antique Jews were rabbinic Jews, and it is by no means clear to what extent the rabbis sought to impose their own view of Judaism as the only correct path, or what authority they held. By the end of the 8th c. the rabbinic movement was genuinely dominant in Jewish society, but in Late Antiquity itself the rabbis were only one among a number of possible Jewish power groups. Archaeology has proved essential in overturning the older scholarly consensus (see for example the contribution of Magness in this volume) and in examining the interaction of Jews with the culture of their pagan and Christian neighbours (as Weiss demonstrates here for the Jews of Sepphoris). The material evidence of buildings, tombs, artefacts and inscriptions offers scholars a broader vision of Jewish society than our rabbinic texts can allow. The history of Christianity in Late Antiquity has long been structured around the great councils and fathers of the Church. Their creeds and teachings comprise the ‘Patristic’ tradition of Christian orthodoxy, a tradition passed on in an unbroken line from Christ and the apostles to future generations. Those whose doctrines or practices came to be excluded from that tradition were condemned as heretics or schismatics (for a further discussion of this ‘heresiological ethos’, see the article of Perrin). Yet the dividing line between ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘heresy’ in Christian history was never as rigid nor as self-evident as the textual evidence, written almost invariably from the perspective of the eventual victors, would like to suggest. During the great doctrinal controversies in the 4th and 5th c. over the Persons of the Trinity and the nature of Christ it was by no means apparent which positions would come to be accepted as ‘orthodox’. We cannot thus approach these periods in the black-and-white terms favoured by our\n\nreligious diversity in late antiquity: an introduction\n\n9\n\nliterary sources, which denounce (often with hindsight) all those whose teachings would fall outside later orthodoxy under collective polemical labels such as ‘Arian’ or ‘Nestorian’. Rather, we must recognise the broad spectrums of Christian belief and worship that existed during such controversies, and avoid the imposition of polarised models of interpretation that cannot do justice to the complexity of the debates or the issues at stake. It is against this background that over recent decades scholars have begun to reassess the controversies of the 4th and 5th c. and to reconsider traditional interpretations of ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘heresy’ as they are applied to those debates. Archaeology has the potential to make a significant contribution to this ongoing process of re-evaluation, but this potential as yet has not been fully exploited. Many archaeologists unfortunately continue to rely on older theological scholarship which accepted the polemical assertions of our sources too much at face value, and so seek material evidence for the clear separation of ‘orthodox’ and ‘heretical’ churches and congregations which those sources construct. The identification of such sites is on occasion possible and can be valuable, but the criteria used are often inadequate and derive more from the biased textual evidence than from the evidence on the ground. This is particularly true for much of the archaeology of the ‘Arian’ controversy, for which see again the articles of Gwynn and Ward-Perkins. The so-called ‘Nestorian’ controversy that provoked the third ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431 and the division between Chalcedonians and ‘Monophysites’ (or more accurately ‘Miaphysites’) after the fourth ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 pose a further challenge, for these debates led to the creation of distinct churches which have remained separate in communion and organisation down to the present day. Recent research has done much to illuminate the history of the Church of the East (often still inaccurately described as the ‘Nestorian’ Church) in Persia and China and of the Miaphysite churches of Egypt, Ethiopia, Syria and Armenia in regions that after the Islamic Conquests would fall outside the borders of the Byzantine Empire. But there remains a need for archaeologists and theologians to work more closely together to integrate their methodological approaches and to draw out the archaeological evidence which potentially offers a crucial glimpse of the diverse reality that lies behind the black-and-white vision of our texts. The ongoing formation of Jewish and Christian identity that continued throughout Late Antiquity was to have vast implications for\n\n10\n\ndavid m. gwynn and susanne bangert\n\nthe future history of those religions and of the European and Near Eastern world. The construction and imposition of a more defined and restrictive sense of religious identity came at a considerable cost. Pagans, Jews and Manicheans as well as numerous heretics and schismatics were to suffer under the vain efforts of Christian emperors to achieve true religious unity, while the narrowing of acceptable parameters placed new restrictions on the breadth of beliefs and practices that had characterised Judaism and Christianity in earlier times. In the modern world we feel keenly this loss of freedom, and the appearance of this volume is itself testimony to the diversity that refused to be bound by the limits of ‘approved’ religion, as well as a reflection of a contemporary emphasis upon religious pluralism. Yet neither Jewish nor Christian tradition ever sought to deny all difference or rights of expression, and the strength of the collective identities which emerged in Late Antiquity played a crucial role in the survival of both religions in the traumatic years of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West and the rise of Islam. Religion in the Late Antique World The importance of religion within the history of Late Antiquity is almost impossible to exaggerate, and the diversity of late antique religion is itself a reflection of the diversity of the wider late antique world. Yet while few would contest the significance of religion to our understanding of Late Antiquity, it is a cause for concern that, at a time when the distinctions between traditional scholarly disciplines are increasingly being broken down, the study of religion remains to a large degree apart from the mainstream of historical scholarship. The separation of history and religion is a contemporary phenomenon which corresponds to the status of religion in much of the modern West, where religion no longer exerts a major influence on the daily life of the majority of the population. No one would suggest that such a model could be imposed upon Late Antiquity, for the modern separation of ‘sacred’ and ‘secular’ has no place in this world (as is discussed at the level of literary culture by Lepelley, Humphries and Gwynn, and Jeffreys in this volume). But the intellectual isolation of religion and history in many western universities does nevertheless have a direct and often negative impact on how we approach this earlier period. Major\n\nreligious diversity in late antiquity: an introduction\n\n11\n\nadvances have been made in patristic and Jewish studies in particular in recent decades that have only gradually filtered into the wider scholarly consciousness. Late antique history and archaeology likewise have much to teach students of religion who still on occasion approach Christian theology and Jewish exegesis without sufficient awareness of the significance of historical context. Yet opportunities for dialogue remain limited, and more collaborative projects are needed (like the conference that inspired this volume) to draw these important scholarly fields of research into closer cooperation. So why is religion so fundamental to the study of Late Antiquity? At a very basic level, religion exerts a colossal influence upon the evidence on which we depend for our knowledge of the past. Religious writings dominate our textual record, often preserved in religious institutions which had few motives for gathering material from divergent traditions, and religious buildings have survived and remained in use when other structures have disappeared without trace. Even for historians with no direct interest in religious affairs, some knowledge is thus essential. Only if we are aware of the controversial status and role of the rabbis within late antique Judaism can the priceless material contained within rabbinic exegesis and teachings be fully exploited. And some grasp of the major controversies of early Christianity is a requirement for any student of Late Antiquity. Scripture and theology underlie the social and political activity of the Church and of the hugely influential ascetic movement, and divisions over correct belief and practice impact upon all forms of Christian writing, from sermons and letters to historiography and hagiography. At a slightly deeper level, although no less straightforward, religion is also fundamental to our knowledge of the late antique world because late antique religion is of course itself a product of that world. Whatever their ultimate source of inspiration, religions like all human movements that exist within human time must inevitably influence and be influenced by the environment in which they exist. Religious leaders in Late Antiquity were also social and political leaders, and their social and political functions in turn impacted upon their religious status. Temples, churches and synagogues were not solely religious structures, and the rise of the Christian church over the pagan temple played a major role in the ongoing transformation of late antique urban and rural life. Religion indeed penetrates every aspect of late antique life, and like social, economic and political history, religious history must\n\n12\n\ndavid m. gwynn and susanne bangert\n\nbe placed within this wider background. Here again archaeology has a crucial role to play, offering insights into material culture and popular piety at social levels which our literary sources usually ignore. ‘Popular religion’ has always been a difficult concept to study. Partly this reflects the nature of our literary evidence, which inevitably derives primarily from the upper levels of society and which within Christianity and Judaism at least is often composed by those who held positions as clergy or teachers rather than by their congregations and students (see Sandwell’s article here on the preaching of John Chrysostom). Yet the idea of ‘popular religion’ itself implies a visible distinction between ‘official’ or ‘elite’ religion and the ‘popular’ religion of the masses, a distinction that was by no means always apparent in Late Antiquity. Pilgrimage, belief in magic and the cult of the saints and veneration of relics have all been described as in some sense ‘popular’, but such practices were common across every social class and among priests and laity alike. Even the Christian doctrinal debates of the 4th and 5th c., which often seem so trivial to modern western audiences, involved far more than just the theologians and bishops who compose our literary sources. The sheer intensity of conflict and interaction within and between the many different faiths of Late Antiquity underlines once again the importance of religion in this period of history and the need for scholars to continue to draw together the literary and archaeological work, to which this volume is a contribution, if we are to engage with the true diversity of the late antique religious world.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC ESSAY\n\nRELIGIOUS DIVERSITY IN LATE ANTIQUITY: A BIBLIOGRAPHIC ESSAY David M. Gwynn The last few decades have seen an ever-increasing flow of scholarly works dedicated to the study of Late Antiquity. The spheres of archaeology and religion have been at the forefront of that scholarship, and for academics and students alike it has become more and more difficult to keep pace with new publications and shifting interpretations. This bibliographic essay cannot provide a comprehensive record of late antique archaeological and religious scholarship, for such an ‘essay’ would require a vast tome in its own right. The aims of this essay are more limited but it is hoped more practical and more accessible. The following pages offer a reference guide that highlights the diversity of the religious world of Late Antiquity both within and between different religions and across the broad spectrum of spiritual and physical experiences revealed through the study of asceticism, holy persons, relics, pilgrimage and magic. The bibliography provided is intended to aid both scholars desiring further knowledge and students seeking initial guidance on subjects of personal interest. Each section is prefaced by a brief introduction highlighting particular themes and debates and identifying important reading, and the general works at the beginning of each entry can be consulted for further bibliographic assistance. The organisation of this essay follows closely the organisation of the volume as a whole. Several important subjects have therefore been omitted, in particular the ongoing presence and evolution of paganism in Late Antiquity and the impact of Christianisation, for, as has been explained in the introduction, these subjects will be covered in the companion volume Late Antique Archaeology 7: The Archaeology of Late Antique ‘Paganism’. Christianity and Judaism, however, receive extensive attention, including literary and archaeological sources, regional surveys, ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘heresy’, and liturgy. Additional sections cover the Samaritans and the Manichees, two religious groups whose literature and archaeological remains have attracted significant expert analysis but which have only relatively recently begun to receive the attention they deserve from a wider scholarly audience. Asceticism D. Gwynn, S. Bangert (edd.) Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity (Late Antique Archaeology 6 – 2008) (Leiden 2010), pp. 15–132\n\n16\n\ndavid m. gwynn\n\nand Monasticism receive their own section for reasons that are I hope self-evident, as too do Martyrs, Holy Men and Women; Relics and Icons; and Pilgrimage. The inclusion of Magic may at first sight seem out of place, yet as recent scholarship has demonstrated the modern separation between magic and religion cannot be imposed uncritically on the past and concepts of magical and divine forces, prophecy and theurgy were central to the late antique religious world. The final section covers the limited evidence for popular religion and piety and the engagement of the wider population in religious controversy. In all these sections the bibliographic entries cover both literary and archaeological studies, although in keeping with the purpose of the Late Antique Archaeology series there is a particular emphasis on material evidence and its interpretation. The limits of space and the need for clarity have led me to keep details to a minimum, and I have also preferred to reference larger volumes which contain their own bibliographies rather than record every article published on a given theme, although important articles are regularly cited. The greater proportion of the books cited are in English, reflecting both my own background and to a degree the relative scale of book and journal publication in the United Kingdom and the United States. Nevertheless, works in all major continental languages have naturally been referenced, and the contrasting approaches of different scholarly and linguistic fields have played a crucial role in bringing the diversity of late antique religion to light. I am deeply grateful to all those who have assisted me in compiling this essay and who have given of their time to fill gaps in my own reading and to improve the quality and range of the entries that follow. The responsibility for any remaining errors or omissions is of course my own. Introduction The study of religion and religious history has never lacked attention, and the fundamental role of religion in the complex transitional period of Late Antiquity has always been recognised. Yet here, as in other spheres of late antique scholarship, recent decades have seen significant change. The traditional Western focus on Christianity remains highly influential but has been tempered by an increasing emphasis upon the value and importance of non-Christian religious studies, and there is far greater scholarly awareness of the vast diversity that exists\n\nreligious diversity: a bibliographic essay\n\n17\n\nboth between and within religions and religious experiences in the ancient and late antique worlds (perhaps best reflected in the works of J. Z. Smith (1978, 1990)). The nature of religious identity has been the focus of a number of recent studies (see for example the papers collected in Frakes and Digeser (2006)), and the problematic nature of concepts like ‘orthodox’ Christianity or ‘rabbinic’ Judaism is now widely accepted. As a number of the articles in this volume attest, this diversity can be traced throughout the religious environment of Late Antiquity, not only among Christians and Jews but among the Samaritans, the Manichees and other religious communities. Diversity is equally visible in modern studies of late antique asceticism, the ‘holy man’, pilgrimage and magic, all of which take different forms between and within the different religions covered in this essay. In this evolving understanding of the late antique religious world, archaeology has played a central role (for a valuable introduction to the strengths and weaknesses of religious archaeology see the articles edited by Insoll (2001)). The material evidence of archaeology, not only through specific artefacts or architectural remains but through study of topography and the use of space for ceremony and liturgy, offers insights that texts omit and allows us to see the diversity that our often polemical and ideological literary sources may conceal. Yet it is equally true that there are many aspects of religious experience that archaeology cannot adequately reveal, and the study of religious belief in Late Antiquity will always require knowledge of texts. It is the relationship between the evidence of text and archaeology that still awaits closer and more refined analysis, and this must be achieved through discussion between historians, archaeologists, theologians and religious historians, not through polemical assertions of the superiority of different categories of evidence. Literary and material sources have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the greatest breakthroughs have been achieved by drawing their respective strengths together into a greater whole. This entire volume represents a call for this work to continue, for it is here that great possibilities lie for further advances in our understanding of the role of religion in the wider social and political history of Late Antiquity.

There are numerous excellent introductions to the early Church, including the classic works of Chadwick (1993, 2001) and the edited volumes of Esler (2000) and of L. Pietri (2000) in Histoire du christianisme des origines à nos jours. A variety of valuable articles can similarly be found in the works edited by Hazlett (1991) and Kreider (2001), and particularly in the first volume of the new series A People’s History of Christianity, edited by Horsley (2005), and in the Oxford Handbook of Early Christian Studies, edited by Harvey and Hunter (2008). Also to be recommended is Rousseau’s The Early Christian Centuries (2002), which contains further suggestions for bibliographic guidance. For the late antique and Byzantine periods there are again an array of fundamental studies, including Maraval (1997), Brenk (2003) and Brown (2003), and the edited volumes of C. Pietri (1995) and L. Pietri (1998) and of Burrus (2005) and Krueger (2006). Given the enormous quantity of scholarship on Christian subjects and the equally intimidating number of primary texts upon which a scholar of Christianity is able to draw, the assistance of reference works and bibliographical aids has long been essential. Dictionaries, encyclopaedias, lexicons and prosopographies have all been compiled, providing a source of reference on all aspects of Christian history and thought. An ever-growing proportion of Christian writings have been edited, from the Patrologia Latina (1844–1864) and Patrologia Graeca (1857–1866) of Migne to the ongoing work of the Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller (1897–) and Sources Chrétiennes (1941–), all series which contain texts relevant not only to Christianity but to the religious and cultural world of Late Antiquity more broadly. Major series of translations are likewise accessible, most commonly into English but also into other languages, and such translations are increasingly becoming\n\nreligious diversity: a bibliographic essay\n\n21\n\navailable online. The appearance of anthologies and source collections has also greatly benefitted students in particular, with the New Eusebius and Creeds, Councils and Controversies of Stevenson (1987, 1989) perhaps the most valuable as an introduction to the breadth and diversity of early Christian writings. Both the primary texts upon which the history of Christianity has traditionally been based and the scholarship that has exploited those texts are inevitably influenced by the context and biases of individual authors and by their conceptions of Christianity and of the Church. From the very first Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius of Caesarea (ca. 260–ca. 339) each Christian generation has sought to reinterpret the Christian past to serve the needs of their own present, a process equally visible in the rival historical polemics of Catholics and Protestants after the Reformation and in the more irenic debates that have accompanied the modern ecumenical dialogues for Christian unity. In recent decades the older model of Late Antiquity as an age of Christian ‘triumph’ has come under increasing attack, although it still exerts its influence, and has been succeeded by a greater awareness of the complexity of Christianity (or Christianities) in the late antique period. The conversion of Constantine, the first Christian Roman Emperor, not only transformed the social and political status of Christianity but also led to a transformation in Christian material culture and Church organisation. Christian architecture and art, liturgical and ceremonial practice and concepts of ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘heresy’ all received greater definition with imperial patronage of the Church. Yet this process of definition was gradual and incomplete, and wide regional and local variations always remained. Archaeology has played a crucial role both in refining our understanding of how Christianity developed in the late antique period and in highlighting the ongoing Christian diversity that our literary sources at times appear to conceal. The history of ‘Christian archaeology’ is long and controversial, and is well brought out in the studies of Bovini (1968), Deichmann (1983), Frend (1996) and Lane (2001), while the evolution of scholarly interests and ideas can also be traced through the many volumes of the Atti del congresso internazionale di archeologia cristiana. As all these works demonstrate, archaeology has radically advanced our knowledge of Christian architecture and art, topography, epigraphy, liturgy and ceremonial, and in recent decades has expanded beyond the traditional horizons of the Later Roman empire into more distant areas, with considerable effect (see regional surveys below). Yet\n\n22\n\ndavid m. gwynn\n\nChristian archaeology, no less than textual scholarship, is open to the influence of personal and denominational bias, and the interaction of archaeologists and literary theologians and liturgical scholars has previously suffered from disinterest from both sides to the detriment of the subject as a whole.

(1985) Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life before Constantine (Mâcon 1985).\n\nArchitecture and Art The architecture and art of the Christian Church offers a priceless resource for our understanding of the early Christians and the world in which they lived, yet has also been the focus for considerable con-\n\nreligious diversity: a bibliographic essay\n\n27\n\ntroversy both in modern times and in previous centuries. The legitimacy of Christian art in light of the Second Commandment and fears of idolatry came under attack particularly during the Byzantine Iconoclasm and the Reformation, while the latter also challenged the appropriateness of monumental ornamented churches which might detract from pure devotion to God. These controversies caused the destruction of a number of now lost churches and works of art, notably in Byzantium, and led to the imposition of later standards upon earlier Christian generations, with recurring assertions in the Protestant West of a puritan and aniconic early Church. It is essential to set aside such later preconceptions if we are to examine the extant evidence in its own context and to better assess the relationship of early Christian architecture and art with contemporary classical models and the transformation of Christian material culture from the reign of Constantine onwards. Studies of early Christian architecture have focused heavily on the development and evolution of churches, although increasing attention is now being paid to the wider architectural environment within which Christianity evolved (the standard work remains that of Krautheimer (1986), to which should be added the books of White (1990, 1996–97), with further bibliography available from Kleinbauer (1992)). Little trace remains of the buildings in which the first Christians may have gathered, whether Jewish synagogues or converted house churches, which cannot easily be identified in the archaeological record. Only gradually did purpose-built churches emerge and only in the 4th c. did certain forms become increasingly standardised, particularly the basilica which would become the most common church design in the West from Constantine onwards (see Ward-Perkins (1954), Krautheimer (1967)), the tetraconch churches in Syria and elsewhere (Kleinbauer (1972, 1987)), and the domed churches of which the most famous is Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Even within the Christian empire, however, this process of standardisation was never complete and late antique church planning continued to experiment and to advance by trial and error (Krautheimer (1980)), another reflection of the diversity of late antique Christianity. On all these subjects, see further the regional surveys in the following section of this essay. The study of early Christian art shares many of the limitations of the architectural evidence and has aroused far greater controversy. The impact of Byzantine and particularly Protestant Iconoclasm on Western scholarship and the fragmentary survival of evidence for\n\n28\n\ndavid m. gwynn\n\nChristian iconography before Constantine led a number of scholars to see the emergence of Christian art as a product of the Christian empire rather than the original Church. The only notable exceptions were the catacombs of Rome and the 3rd c. church discovered at Dura Europus on the Euphrates, on which again see the regional surveys below. Yet the argument that the early Church was originally aniconic rests on very weak foundations, as Sister Charles Murray demonstrated in a famous article in 1977. The older classics of Strzygowski (1901), Volbach and Hirmer (1958), Klauser (1958, 1959) and Grabar (1966, 1968) have now largely been superseded by the works of Elsner (1995, 1998) and Jensen (2000). Nevertheless, the attitudes of early Christians towards iconography still divide scholarly opinion (compare for example Finney (1994), Bigham (2004) and Cameron (2005), and see the bibliography on icons and iconoclasm later in this essay) and impact upon modern interpretations of the Church in the period before Constantine. The emergence of Christian art on a large scale in the 4th c. also raises further questions regarding the concept of Christian art itself and the impact upon that art of Jewish and classical traditions. The influence of Jewish art has been traced by Brenk (1977), Gutmann (1984), and Weitzmann and Kessler (1990) among others, the latter work focusing on the rare instance of an early synagogue and church with preserved decoration in close proximity at Dura Europus. The relationship of Christian and classical art has received more widespread attention, as in the works of Elsner (1995, 1998), Mathews (1999) and numerous studies too extensive to list. Scholars have looked beyond church art to assess other early Christian artistic forms, including the development of Christian mosaics, sarcophagi and ivory carving. In all these media, the ongoing interaction of classical, Jewish and Christian iconography and symbolism can hinder the precise identification of artefacts or their owners, as can be seen in the work of Daniélou (1961) and the edited volume of Ries (1985). Here once more the divisions between religions and their means of material expression are never as clear or as fixed as we might assume. Architecture: General Works: Addyman P. and Morris R.
