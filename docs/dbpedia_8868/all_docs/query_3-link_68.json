Please visit a DMV hub office as soon as you receive your renewal notice. If you can provide a valid U.S. passport, you will not need to be verified through USCIS.\n\n** Individuals arriving in the U.S. with an I-94 stamp in your passport must visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website to obtain a hard copy of your I-94 document.\n\nOther Requirements:\n\nAll immigration documents must be valid at the time of Issuance.\n\nImmigration checks are only valid for one year (unless you were verified with a Certificate of Naturalization or Certificate of Citizenship).\n\nPeople with a B1/B2, waiver-tourist (WT), or waiver-business (WB) visitor status are NOT eligible to obtain a Connecticut credential.\n\nForeign students with an F1 Visa status are required to show their passport, along with USCIS document I-20.\n\nJ1 Visa holders are required to show their passport, along with USCIS document DS2019.\n\nDependents of principal, child, or spouse may have to provide principal’s documents.\n\nGetting a driver’s license for the first time if you’re 18 years of age or older\n\nAdults 18 years of age and older who want to get a Connecticut driver's license are required to first get an adult learner's permit.
