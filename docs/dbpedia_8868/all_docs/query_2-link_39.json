        "text": "Description\n\nGerman currency used during World War II. The Reichsmark (ℛℳ) was the currency used in Germany and its colonies from 1924 to 1948. This bill was likely used by Sergeant John B. Hancock (1913-1944), an American soldier.\n\nSgt. Hancock was born in Thomasville, Georgia, in 1913, but later migrated to Auburndale, Florida. Hancock managed a Great Atlantic &amp\n\nPacific Tea Company (A&amp\n\nP) store in Haines City until he enlisted in the 45th Infantry Division's 179th Infantry Regiment. Sgt. Hancock served initially in Africa in 1943, until the 45th Infantry Division's participation in Operation Husky for the Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. The division then went on to participate in the Allied invasion of Italy, where Sgt. Hancock was injured. He was returned to duty in February of 1944 to tour southern France. On November 1, 1944, Sgt. Hancock went Missing in Action (MIA) after serving in the Allied invasion of Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon. He was eventually buried in Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial in Dinozé, France."
