        "text": "In October 1945, 30 Poles broke into the home of Theodor E in Heimbuchtal, murdered him and his war-disabled son, committed violence against his daughter and a farm laborer, and robbed the house. The population reacted to these murders with “great embitterment” and “paralyzing fear.” Inhabitants of remote farms were particularly at risk of becoming a target of such attack and thus reported as being in particular fear.\n\nA variety of factors drove DP violence against ordinary Germans. In many cases, escaped or bombed-out slave workers committed lootings and robberies simply to survive. They mostly stole food and were only violent with those Germans who refused them. Yet in other cases, former slave laborers sought explicit revenge. They were in a better position than Jewish Holocaust victims because they often knew the identity of their tormenters. In Pullach, a former employee of the electric power station on the Isar was reportedly killed by “his slave workers,” because he had “treated them badly.” Former superiors of DPs—“master foremen, camp commanders or plant security guards”—also frequently became targets of acts of DP violence.\n\nA woman noted in November 1945 that, as a part of a series of “horrific murder, attacks and robberies,” “the Poles” had shot one farmer and were threatening to kill another unless he paid “back pay” for their five years of slave labor.” Former foreign workers made use of their local knowledge and targeted those individuals who had mistreated and tortured them during the war. DPs took indirect revenge as well. Reporting a robbery and plundering by 10-15 people of a farm in Mehring in the Altöttingen district, a German official cited a frequent justification, “especially by Poles,” that the “German SS has done the same thing.”\n\nStoked by persistent stereotypes of Eastern Europeans as “criminals,” panicked Germans clearly exaggerated the extent of actual DP violence. DP criminality remained equal or slightly below general German crime rates in the immediate post-war period and was only slightly higher than German crime rates by 1947. Reports of DP violence were inflated in German sources due to a variety of factors. German farmers occasionally invented alleged DP robberies in order to conceal the selling of their livestock on the black market.\n\nPolice reports also consistently inflated DP criminality in order to lobby the occupation authorities for the expansion and rearming of German security forces. Germans blamed DPs for their own sense of helplessness and constructed DPs as the “active, aggressive, and criminal counterpart of German society.” DPs themselves protested against the press campaign that portrayed them as “criminals” and “fascists.” Indeed, it is important to emphasize that the overwhelming majority of DPs never resorted to violence.\n\nStill, individual acts of DP violence assumed a disproportionate symbolic significance. Stories of DP violence tended to confirm and intensify preexisting German fears of the consequences of defeat. And fears of retribution from DPs were at least partly grounded in actual events. While the German imagination of DP violence exceeded its actual reality, these occurrences lent at least some credibility to post-war fears of retribution. Rumors of widespread DP violence were contagious, and fears of retribution thus also affected those individuals who never experienced any violence from DPs.\n\nPreexisting and lingering racist stereotypes about “Poles” and “Russians” as well as widespread knowledge of actual Nazi atrocities fueled popular fears of retribution. As such, the threat and the imagination of DP violence intensified the general climate of uncertainty and insecurity of the immediate post-war period. “We have never had such [terrible] conditions in Bavaria as we are experiencing now, not even during the war,” as one official reported.\n\nOne hope, therefore, that Germans associated with the arrival of the occupation authorities, was the restoration of order and a new sense of personal security. Yet many were shocked when they realized that, far from mitigating these anxieties, post-war occupation confronted them with new threats and challenges.\n\nGermans had not experienced the complete foreign occupation of their country since the Napoleonic wars in the early nineteenth century. Post-war Germans were now completely dependent on Allied victors and lacked the coveted self-determination that assumed new global significance after 1945 with the onset of decolonization. Time and again, German testimonies from the spring of 1945 invoked the specter of “slavery.” Lore N. from Saxony, for example, wrote to her friend Fritz E. in Silesia in March 1945 that she did not “ want to work as slave for another people, then we would have no joy in life whatsoever.” For many Germans, foreign occupation constituted an unprecedented leap in the dark.\n\nFears of Allied revenge centered especially on the “Russians.” Soviet atrocities during the conquest of Germany, especially the mass rape of up to 2 million German women by soldiers of the Red Army, further confirmed these fears, which were often based on a thoroughly racist imaginary. Commenting on the entry of the Red Army into Leipzig, Thea D. (born in 1928) described the “animal like faces of the Asiatics” who represented to her “uncultivated humanity.”\n\nOut of this fear, German soldiers and civilians alike made desperate efforts to reach British and American lines in order to escape the Red Army. Some Germans also articulated great relief, even joy and happiness to be under American rather than Soviet occupation.\n\nYet, despite such widespread preference for the Western allies, many Germans perceived occupation in general as a massive threat to their personal lives and imagined futures. Rumors of Soviet atrocities also enhanced German anxieties about Allied retribution in general. On May 6, 1945, the 20 year old Renate P. noted in her diary:\n\n“our darkest fears have become reality over the last few days. Germany has experienced the most dishonorable and miserable defeat in centuries and has been completely defeated and thrown to the ground by the three powerful enemy powers Russia, America, and England – Germany is occupied, eradicated, it is and will be looked down upon in the whole world, the country and its people will be shunned and despised.”\n\nAmerican soldiers also did not see themselves as liberators of Germans, but rather as victors and occupiers. The main directive of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for General Eisenhower, JCS 1067, demanded a punitive and harsh treatment of defeated Germans. Instructions to individual American soldiers in the Pocket Guide to GermanyITALICS stated unambiguously: “You are in enemy territory. These people are not our allies or friends.”\n\nGuidelines for troop behavior warned that “the majority of Germans supported the Nazis” and that German civilians would “try to make friends with us – to get information, to get favors, to create sympathy for the ‘poor down-trodden’ German people, to make us disagree among ourselves, or just to get a good chance to slip a knife into Allied soldiers.”\n\nAn opinion survey among US soldiers in April 1945 indicated that 76 percent “hated” or had “negative feelings” toward German civilians, while 71 percent of soldiers felt that “all or most Germans” were responsible for the war. The discovery and liberation of the concentration camps in the following month most likely intensified these negative feelings. Whatever hopes individual Germans had associated with the arrival of American occupation troops in 1945, these positive feelings were not reciprocal.\n\nIt is true that the relationship between Germans and American GIs improved progressively and eventually prepared the ground for the later integration of the Federal Republic into the Western alliance during the Cold War. But Germans living at the time could not anticipate this later development. They instead experienced US occupation as a massive intervention into their personal, even intimate lives. Three areas, in particular, emerged as sources of popular fear and anxiety: violent transgressions of American occupation soldiers, housing requisitions, and the onset of denazification.\n\nOne source of post-war fear were American acts of violence toward German civilians. Such violent transgressions were not surprising in light of the ferocity of the fighting during the final stage of the war. Serious crimes such as “homicide, rape, robbery, larceny, black market offenses etc” reportedly increased from 3.7 per 10,000 troops in August 1945 to 11.1 per 10,000 troops in January 1946. GI violence against German civilians assumed a multiplicity of forms. Some transgressions took place in broad daylight and served the purpose of publicly humiliating individual Germans for their complicity with Nazism.\n\nIn July 1945, American soldiers invaded the house of ex-soldier Georg W, struck him in the face, and forced him to stand naked at his window in broad daylight. Other cases, however, occurred at night and lacked such public dimensions. GIs approached and stopped German civilians seemingly at random, asked them for cigarettes, liquor, money, or perhaps a ride, and then beat them up, often leading to severe injuries.\n\nIn several cases reported from Amberg in the fall of 1946, drunk GIs also invaded German homes, asked for liquor or girls, or asserted their superiority by brandishing their pistols. A rapid increase in automobile accidents involving American GIs—7,800 between June and November 1945 according to one source—signaled a lack of discipline among occupation troops. A resident from the Hessian town of Marburg spoke for many when he complained in March 1946 of random and violent assaults by American occupation forces against German civilians, including several university professors.\n\n“These assaults,” he added, “have become notorious among the civilian population of Marburg; nobody risks going out in the evenings, and people feel as if they were exposed to acts of indiscriminate brutality with no means of protection.”\n\nSexual assault, including rape, constituted a permanent feature of the relationship between American GIs and German civilians as well. US court martial records documented 552 cases of rape of German women by American soldiers. This was much lower than the comparable figures in the Soviet zone, though other estimates also cite higher numbers of up to 1,500 rapes between January and December 1945. A similar script governed rapes in both zones: they often resulted from soldiers’ frustration over excessive violence and German persistence during the final stages of the war; soldiers considered German women as part of a defeated and subjugated people; sexual violence served the purpose of meting out revenge by humiliating German men.\n\nThe involvement of African American soldiers in sexual relations with German women represented a particular issue of German concern. Such relationships activated preexisting racist dispositions among German civilians. “There are rumors that soon negroes will arrive as occupation troops,” wrote Edeltraut G in her diary in April 1945. “That will be horrible, then one will no longer be able to be in the street as a girl.” Undoubtedly due to their own racist dispositions in a still-segregated army, (White) American occupation officials tended to agree with German officials and citizens.\n\nAfrican-American GIs became a ready scapegoat for tensions between American troops over such sentiments. Official US army statistics suggested a much higher rate of “serious incidents” among “colored” troops than among White troops, which almost certainly reflected racist selectivity. Germans, for their part, quickly learned that certain forms of racism were quite compatible with American military rule. Yet, even the curtailed authority of African American GIs as occupiers confirmed German perceptions of the occupation period as a world turned upside down.\n\nHousing requisitions were another source of post-war German fears. Housing was an extremely scarce resource in occupied Germany. In cities such as Würzburg, three quarters of the housing stock had been destroyed due to Allied bombing; the average for all four occupation zones was about 30 percent. Millions of refugees and expellees from the former German territories in the East and the gradual return of German POWs further stoked demand for housing.Therefore, it is not surprising that Germans perceived housing requisitions by the occupation army as a severe burden.\n\nIn Munich, mayor Karl Scharnagel reported to the city council in December 1946 that “in every part of the city, popular concerns are growing that the same fate [of requisitioning, F.B.] could affect every street, every house.” Rumors and news of further requisitions caused great “concern, fear, and embitterment” among the population; and Munich residents publicly proclaimed their fear of the “specter of requisitioning houses and farms.” Even those Germans who had initially welcomed the American occupation feared the loss of their home.\n\nIn April 1945, Evamaria Küchling-Marsdem noted in her diary:\n\nThe fact that the American military requisitioned houses for Jews, DPs, and other Nazi victims worsened German resentment. When the American military government ordered the requisitioning of 240 small houses in the Kaltherberge settlement for 2,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors in December 1945, widespread public protest ensued. Germans charged that the new inhabitants were not Nazi victims but “illegally immigrated and work-shy elements” who engaged in Black Market and other criminal activities. Outrage about requisitions also turned into violence against Jews. A former SS leader, for example, broke into his apartment, which had been given to a Polish couple. American occupation officials sought to elicit Germans’ empathy for Jewish Holocaust survivors, but German civilians and officials displayed little understanding for these arguments.\n\nThe only official program that concerned individual Germans more than housing requisitions was denazification, a process designed to eliminate Nazi influence from the defeated country. Historians have long viewed American led-denazification as an abysmal failure. Although well-intended, it eventually had the effect of whitewashing former Nazis.\n\nOf the 900,000 denazification proceedings in the US zone, the process only rated 1,654 persons (0.17 percent) “major offenders,” 22,122 (2.33 percent) “offenders,” and 106,422 “minor offenders.” Therefore, denazification did not significantly disrupt the continuity of personnel in the civil service, the police, the educational sector, and especially the legal profession..\n\nYet, its long-term failure to accomplish a comprehensive purge of former Nazis reveals little about the subjective experience of denazification at the time. For many Germans, the onset of denazification confirmed some of their worst fears of Allied retribution. “How the Nazis are afraid now,” a woman from Hamburg wrote in a letter on May 7, and quickly added “hopefully, they will catch the right ones now.”\n\nInitial denazification measures in the American zone undermined such hopes in the Allied ability to identify “real Nazis.” The occupation directive JCS 1067 stipulated the dismissal of all Nazi party members from public office as well as the “automatic arrest” of war criminals and Nazi party functionaries down to the local level. Military Government Law Nr. 8 of March 1946 increased the range of affected individuals to require the dismissal of anybody who had been a member of the Nazi party before 1937 and its affiliated organizations.\n\nGiven the mass support for National Socialism, these stipulations had a significant impact on post-war German society. By the end of 1945, some 100,000 persons had been arrested and were interned in the American zone, while another 340,000 persons had lost their jobs by March 1946, more than half of them civil servants. As a result, local administrations virtually collapsed. In Munich, denazification affected a quarter of all city employees, in the city of Würzburg, up to 70 percent, including, by August 1945, 92 percent of all teachers. Local German communities found it difficult to maintain public services as a result of denazification. Indiscriminate arrests fueled strong German popular resistance and undermined initial support for denazification.\n\nAs early as August 1945, the Regierungspräsident from Würzburg reported that the “measures against the NSDAP and its members lacks moral support among the people.” Christian churches mobilized against denazification as well, and church officials became the main spokespersons of popular opposition. In October 1945, for example, the South German Protestant Bishop Wurm denounced denazification as an expression of Allied “revenge and retribution,” particularly objecting—in a language deliberately reflecting the Nazi persecution of Jews —to the “undifferentiated extinction of all Nazi civil servants.”\n\nSince the denazification of the economy proceeded on the same criteria of formal party membership, many individual Germans reportedly worried about their “possessions” and feared becoming part of “the outlaws and the dispossessed.” A report from Würzburg claimed in January 1946 that denazification affected 50 percent of all people in the city and called on occupiers “to take away the fear from people.”\n\nPopular attitudes toward denazification did not significantly change with the transition of denazification into German hands in March 1946. Local denazification courts (Spruchkammern) comprised of former German anti-Nazis took charge of processing individual cases. The “Law for the Liberation from National Socialism and Militarism” required all inhabitants 18 years or older to account for their political pasts.\n\nMore than 13,000,000 Germans filled out the questionnaire on denazification, more than one fourth or 3,441,800 persons needed to undergo formal denazification because they had been members of the Nazi party or of one of its organizations. A completed denazification procedure was necessary to assume anything else than a manual labor position. Because denazification targeted overwhelmingly middle-class men, this clause implied the temporary suspension from influential positions of a large segment of the male educated middle class.\n\nNot surprisingly, those affected by denazification reacted furiously and defiantly to these sanctions. In his novel The Questionnaire, the well-known right-wing activist of the interwar period, Ernst von Salomon, mocked the entire denazification procedure. The fact that this book became the most successful bestseller of the early post-war period indicates the depth of the resentment regarding denazification among Germans at that time.\n\nIn her “Report from Germany” in 1950, the German-Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt observed that postwar Germans displayed a “genuine inability to feel” and a “general lack of emotion.” The intense fears of retribution that Germans articulated during the immediate post-war period contradict this statement. Fears of revenge and anxiety about an uncertain individual and collective future constituted a foundational experience for post-war Germans in the aftermath of the “Third Reich.”\n\nFears of retribution defined postwar Germans’ experience of defeat and shaped their anticipation of the future. The emotional function of these fears of retribution was complex and contradictory: fear served both as a veiled expression of guilt and as a defense mechanism against it. On the one hand, the extensive knowledge of Nazi crimes and hence a clear sense of guilt were among the causes of fear.\n\nYet, on the other hand, private and public articulations of fear and anxiety blocked a more extensive self-reflection and admission of guilt. The real and imagined consequences of this guilt appeared as too severe to many Germans. In this way, fears of retribution delayed a more extensive confrontation with the actual catastrophe that Germans had brought about for the millions of victims of Nazism.\n\nMeet the Author\n\nFrank Biess is Professor of History at the University of California San Diego.
