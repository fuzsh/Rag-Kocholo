        "meta_description": "Actions Taken in Coordination with G7 Metals and Mining Determination Enables Targeting of Putin Revenue Source Wide Array of Evasion-Related Targets Exposed WASHINGTON – Today, one year after the Russian Federation launched its unprovoked war against Ukraine, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is taking significant action to diminish Russia’s ability to continue its brutal war and to procure the resources used to support it. In one of its most significant sanctions actions to date, Treasury is announcing a new determination targeting the metals and mining sector of the Russian Federation economy under Executive Order 14024 and is also imposing sanctions on 22 individuals and 83 entities. Today’s action, together with additional measures taken by the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, in coordination with allies and G7 partners, further isolates Russia from the international economy and hinders Russia’s ability to obtain the capital, materials, technology, and support that sustain its war against Ukraine, which has killed thousands and displaced millions of people. Additionally, as Russia searches for ways to evade sanctions and export controls, the U.S. government is ramping up efforts to counter such evasion around the world. Today’s action includes designations of over 30 third-country individuals and companies connected to Russia’s sanctions evasion efforts, including those related to arms trafficking and illicit finance. While Russian banks representing over 80 percent of total Russian banking sector assets are already subject to U.S and international sanctions, OFAC today is designating over a dozen financial institutions in Russia, including one of the top-ten largest banks by asset value. Sanctioned actors have been known to turn to smaller banks as well as wealth-management firms in an attempt to evade sanctions as Russia seeks new ways to access the international financial system. “As the Ukrainian people continue to valiantly defend their homeland and their freedom, the United States is proud to support Ukraine through economic, security, and humanitarian assistance,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Over the past year, we have taken actions with a historic coalition of international partners to degrade Russia’s military-industrial complex and reduce the revenues that it uses to fund its war. Our sanctions have had both short-term and long-term impact, seen acutely in Russia’s struggle to replenish its weapons and in its isolated economy. Our actions today with our G7 partners show that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.” Dozens of entities and individuals being sanctioned today operate in industries that ultimately support Russia’s war against Ukraine. This includes firms that produce or import specialized, high-technology equipment used by Russian defense entities and companies that make advanced materials used in Russian weapons systems. The United States and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions, export controls, and other measures following the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Since February 2022, Treasury has implemented more than 2,500 sanctions in response to Russia’s war of choice. The unprecedented costs imposed on Russia have been closely coordinated with allies and partners, with more than 30 countries having imposed sanctions or similar measures against Russia following the launch of its war. Russia’s aggressive and unprovoked war will have significant and long-lasting consequences for Russia’s economy and defense base. Sanctions and export controls have caused Russia’s financial sector losses of hundreds of billions of dollars and created major setbacks for Russia’s technological advancement. The United States will continue to impose costs on Russia for as long as this war continues. FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR SANCTIONS Imposing further sanctions against Russia’s financial services sector impedes the ability of President Vladimir Putin’s regime to raise capital in support of the war against Ukraine and further isolates Russia from the global financial system. Today, Treasury is imposing sanctions on numerous Russian banks and is also targeting wealth management-related entities and individuals that play key roles in Russia’s financial services sector. Sanctions evasion and other illicit financial activity often involves support from accountants, investment advisors, wealth management and private equity firms, lawyers, and other financial services providers. According to an alert issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in March 2022, sanctioned actors may seek to evade sanctions by using corporate vehicles to obscure ownership or sources of funds, such as shell companies or third-party proxies. FinCEN issued another alert in March 2022 underscoring sanctioned persons’ use of real estate, luxury goods, and other high-value assets, such as precious metals, stones, and jewelry (PMSJ), to store value and evade economic restrictions. In June 2022, FinCEN and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry issued an alert urging increased vigilance for export control evasion attempts. Designation of Multiple Russian Financial Institutions OFAC today designated the following Russian banks pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy: Credit Bank of Moscow Public Joint Stock Company, one of Russia’s ten largest banks by asset value and located in Moscow, is Russia’s largest non-state public bank. The European Union removed Credit Bank of Moscow from the SWIFT international payment system in June 2022 and fully blocked the bank in December 2022. OFAC previously placed Credit Bank of Moscow on the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List; it is now also subject to full-blocking sanctions. Joint Stock Company Commercial Bank Lanta Bank, a bank located in Moscow, Russia. Public Joint Stock Company Commercial Bank Metallurgical Investment Bank (Metallinvestbank), a bank located in Moscow, Russia. Metallinvestbank has used alternative payment routes to facilitate the receipt of payments for Russian exports.

TARGETING RUSSIAN SANCTIONS EVASION Due to the impact of sanctions and export controls, Russian intelligence services have been directed to find channels for evasion and backfilling. Treasury will continue to impose sanctions on actors inside and outside of Russia that circumvent sanctions and enable Russia to procure resources critical to enabling Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Treasury is imposing sanctions on the following entities and individuals for their roles in sanctions evasion efforts.

SANCTIONS TARGETING RUSSIA’S MILITARY SUPPLY CHAINS Treasury is taking additional steps to impose costs on and further restrict key entities that support Russia’s military capabilities. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale war, Treasury has targeted Russia’s defense industries. Treasury will continue to designate Russian Federation persons connected to Russia’s defense industries to degrade Putin’s ability to wage war against Ukraine or against any other country in the future.

        "text": "Actions Taken in Coordination with G7\n\nMetals and Mining Determination Enables Targeting of Putin Revenue Source\n\nWide Array of Evasion-Related Targets Exposed\n\nWASHINGTON – Today, one year after the Russian Federation launched its unprovoked war against Ukraine, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is taking significant action to diminish Russia’s ability to continue its brutal war and to procure the resources used to support it.\n\nIn one of its most significant sanctions actions to date, Treasury is announcing a new determination targeting the metals and mining sector of the Russian Federation economy under Executive Order 14024 and is also imposing sanctions on 22 individuals and 83 entities. Today’s action, together with additional measures taken by the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, in coordination with allies and G7 partners, further isolates Russia from the international economy and hinders Russia’s ability to obtain the capital, materials, technology, and support that sustain its war against Ukraine, which has killed thousands and displaced millions of people.\n\nAdditionally, as Russia searches for ways to evade sanctions and export controls, the U.S. government is ramping up efforts to counter such evasion around the world. Today’s action includes designations of over 30 third-country individuals and companies connected to Russia’s sanctions evasion efforts, including those related to arms trafficking and illicit finance. While Russian banks representing over 80 percent of total Russian banking sector assets are already subject to U.S and international sanctions, OFAC today is designating over a dozen financial institutions in Russia, including one of the top-ten largest banks by asset value. Sanctioned actors have been known to turn to smaller banks as well as wealth-management firms in an attempt to evade sanctions as Russia seeks new ways to access the international financial system.\n\n“As the Ukrainian people continue to valiantly defend their homeland and their freedom, the United States is proud to support Ukraine through economic, security, and humanitarian assistance,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

Our sanctions have had both short-term and long-term impact, seen acutely in Russia’s struggle to replenish its weapons and in its isolated economy. Our actions today with our G7 partners show that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\n\nDozens of entities and individuals being sanctioned today operate in industries that ultimately support Russia’s war against Ukraine. This includes firms that produce or import specialized, high-technology equipment used by Russian defense entities and companies that make advanced materials used in Russian weapons systems.\n\nThe United States and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions, export controls, and other measures following the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Since February 2022, Treasury has implemented more than 2,500 sanctions in response to Russia’s war of choice. The unprecedented costs imposed on Russia have been closely coordinated with allies and partners, with more than 30 countries having imposed sanctions or similar measures against Russia following the launch of its war.\n\nRussia’s aggressive and unprovoked war will have significant and long-lasting consequences for Russia’s economy and defense base. Sanctions and export controls have caused Russia’s financial sector losses of hundreds of billions of dollars and created major setbacks for Russia’s technological advancement. The United States will continue to impose costs on Russia for as long as this war continues.\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR SANCTIONS\n\nImposing further sanctions against Russia’s financial services sector impedes the ability of President Vladimir Putin’s regime to raise capital in support of the war against Ukraine and further isolates Russia from the global financial system. Today, Treasury is imposing sanctions on numerous Russian banks and is also targeting wealth management-related entities and individuals that play key roles in Russia’s financial services sector.\n\nSanctions evasion and other illicit financial activity often involves support from accountants, investment advisors, wealth management and private equity firms, lawyers, and other financial services providers. According to an alert issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in March 2022, sanctioned actors may seek to evade sanctions by using corporate vehicles to obscure ownership or sources of funds, such as shell companies or third-party proxies. FinCEN issued another alert in March 2022 underscoring sanctioned persons’ use of real estate, luxury goods, and other high-value assets, such as precious metals, stones, and jewelry (PMSJ), to store value and evade economic restrictions. In June 2022, FinCEN and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry issued an alert urging increased vigilance for export control evasion attempts.\n\nDesignation of Multiple Russian Financial Institutions\n\nOFAC today designated the following Russian banks pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy:\n\nCredit Bank of Moscow Public Joint Stock Company, one of Russia’s ten largest banks by asset value and located in Moscow, is Russia’s largest non-state public bank.
