        "text": "Israel\n\nHamas’s elevation of the Oct. 7 attacks’ architect, Yahya Sinwar, as its leader cements the militant group’s strategic ties to Iran, signaling a united front between Tehran and its axis of militias in a conflict with Israel and the U.S. – Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Canadian government said on Wednesday it has decided to pull the children and guardians of its diplomats out of Israel, amid fears of a widened conflict in the Middle East, the Canadian Press reported. – Reuters\n\nIsraeli forces on Wednesday issued new evacuation orders to Palestinians in areas of north Gaza that were among the first to be hit at the start of the war with Hamas in October, after militants fired a fresh volley of rockets into Israel. – Reuters\n\nIsrael’s ambulance service has stocked blood supplies in a fortified underground centre, factories have moved out hazardous materials and municipal authorities are checking bomb shelters and water supplies as the country waits for a threatened attack from Iran and its proxies. – Reuters\n\nIsrael should fully investigate allegations of sexual abuse against Palestinian detainees by its soldiers, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Wednesday, calling for “zero tolerance” for perpetrators. – Reuters\n\nThe Biden administration on Wednesday led international condemnations of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s comments this week suggesting that starving the entire population of Gaza could be justified in order to secure the release of the Israeli hostages. – Agence France-Presse\n\nHamas politician Khalil al-Hayya is set to continue leading indirect negotiations with Israel for a Gaza ceasefire with guidance from the group’s newly appointed leader, Yahya Sinwar, who continues to run the war effort inside the enclave, three Palestinian sources including a Hamas official said. – Reuters\n\nIsraeli forces raided the Balata refugee camp near the city of Nablus on Wednesday and destroyed the local headquarters of the Fatah faction, Palestinian authorities said, as security forces continued sweeps in the occupied West Bank. – Reuters\n\nThe World Central Kitchen (WCK), a U.S.-based, non-governmental organisation, said a Palestinian staff member was killed in Gaza on Wednesday, four months after seven staffers were killed by Israeli strikes in an attack that drew widespread condemnation. – Reuters\n\nThe World Health Organisation is working on a polio vaccination campaign for Gaza after the virus was detected there, officials say, although the absence of a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas presents multiple roadblocks. – Reuters\n\nPro-Israel advocacy groups and dual U.S.-Israeli citizens have filed a lawsuit challenging President Joe Biden’s order subjecting individuals involved in settler violence in the West Bank to financial and immigration sanctions. – Reuters\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court considered a petition Wednesday to shutter a desert military prison where soldiers have been accused of abusing Palestinians, as a new video emerged purporting to show the sexual assault of a Palestinian detainee. – Associated Press\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the newly chosen Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has the power to ensure that a cease-fire deal is reached for the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Palestinian militant group on Tuesday chose Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, after political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed July 31 in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike. – Associated Press\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran and Hezbollah of preemptive attacks, while Tehran spoke of the Jewish state’s annihilation and the region braced for the possibility of a second direct confrontation between the two arch-foes. – Jerusalem Post\n\nMarc Champion writes: There’s no putting Sinwar in solitary confinement now that he’s the movement’s leader. Until killed or captured, he will hold the second of two keys required to unlock peace in Gaza and so de-escalate tensions at Israel’s border with Lebanon. That will remain the case even if Iran, Hezbollah and the US can succeed in calibrating their expected counterpunch to Israel’s assassinations in a way that avoids escalation, because Sinwar — like his fellow keyholder, Netanyahu — is an arsonist in a desert tinderbox. – Bloomberg\n\nIran\n\nAll government agencies and offices were closed Wednesday in Tehran, and in 13 provinces, including some along the western and eastern borders, hours for government offices were limited to 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. – New York Times\n\nBritain and Egypt asked their airlines on Wednesday to avoid Iranian and Lebanese airspace amid growing fears of a possible broader conflict in the region after the killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. – Reuters\n\nIran will not stay quiet over aggression, President Masoud Pezeshkian told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron according to state media on Wednesday, amid fears of more regional conflict after the killing in Tehran last week of Hamas’ leader. – Reuters\n\nLufthansa Group (LHAG.DE), opens new tab extended its avoidance of Iranian and Iraqi airspace on Wednesday as Middle East tensions rise, and now will bypass the area up to and including Aug. 13, it said. – Reuters\n\nShould it come to full-fledged war, one of Iran’s most valuable assets would be the network of allied foreign militias in addition to Hamas that it has supported and nurtured for decades. The militias have already stepped up actions against Israel since the start of its war with Hamas in October. – Bloomberg\n\nIran faced condemnation from human rights groups Wednesday over its execution of a man convicted of killing a Revolutionary Guard in 2022 protests, with activists saying his confession had been obtained by torture. – Agence France-Presse\n\nIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has reportedly asked the Islamic Republic’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to refrain from attacking Israel, according to a report by Iran International on Wednesday. – Jerusalem Post\n\nHillel Frisch writes: This is a difficult decision to make when attacking a distant country over 70 times the size of Israel, whose nuclear installations and other regime infrastructure are often hidden under mountainous terrain. But then again, Israel should not be at war with 85 million Iranians. The ayatollahs, the political hardliners in power, and the Revolutionary Guard are enough to handle. – Jerusalem Post\n\nErfan Fard writes: Just as Mossad never forgot Haniyeh’s prayer of blessing at a hotel in Turkey during the broadcast of Hamas’s brutality against Israel on October 7, 2023, it will never forget the command center of the IRGC thugs – Hossein Salami, Ali Baqeri, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and others – who ordered the launch of supersonic cruise missiles and kamikaze drones at Israel. Still, the Mossad’s operational prowess has compelled the Islamic Republic to consider replacing its main pieces and reorganizing the intelligence community’s chessboard with the naive notion that it might block the Mossad’s infiltration. However, the Mossad has already read the play of the game. – Jerusalem Post\n\nRussia & Ukraine\n\nUkraine launched an armored incursion into Russia’s lightly defended Kursk region in a surprise move early Tuesday that caused panic among civilians and forced Moscow to rush in additional troops. – Wall Street Journal\n\nThe prisoner swap last week that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich home didn’t free a pair of well-known Russian cybercriminals in U.S. prisons long rumored to be part of the negotiations between Washington and Moscow. – Wall Street Journal\n\nUkraine’s air force said on Thursday that it shot down two out of four missiles and all four drones launched by Russia during an overnight attack. – Reuters\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday described a Ukrainian incursion into the country’s southwestern Kursk region as a “large-scale provocation” as his officials asserted that they were fighting off cross-border raids for a second day. Ukrainian officials remained silent about the scope of the operation. – Associated Press\n\nIlan I. Berman writes: Whatever the political outcome in Washington, though, the reality for Russia will remain the same. Putin’s military misadventure has cost the country dearly, both strategically and in human terms. Officials in Moscow will paint this outcome in more rosy fashion. But for the Russians themselves, the Ukraine conflict shouldn’t be counted as a victory, no matter how hard Kremlin propagandists attempt to spin it. – Newsweek\n\nMick Ryan writes: Now Moscow’s window of maximum opportunity has almost passed. Over the coming months, as Russian momentum wanes, Ukraine will be preparing, reconstituting, and watching for chances. Success is never certain in war, but Ukraine will be better placed in 2025 than it has been this year to liberate territory and to convince Russia that the cost of the war is not worthwhile. But to prevail, Kyiv will have to rebuild its offensive capacity, carry out diplomatic efforts, influence operations, and come up with a new theory of how to win. – Foreign Affairs\n\nEurope\n\nTaylor Swift canceled three concerts in Vienna after Austrian authorities arrested two people, accusing them of planning attacks on large-scale gatherings — including the singer’s shows — in the European capital. The arrests come amid a string of similar terrorist threats targeting major events in Europe this summer. – Washington Post\n\nFaced with a week-long wave of widespread violence and rioting by people authorities describe as far-right “thugs,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the police have been struggling to end some of the worst civil unrest here in more than a decade. – Washington Post\n\nCatalan police have locked down Barcelona in a bid to capture separatist leader Carles Puigdemont, who on Thursday briefly reappeared to address supporters in the city before vanishing. – Politico\n\nElon Musk has been accused of exacerbating tensions after a week of far-right rioting in Britain, sparking calls for the government to speed up the rollout of laws policing harmful online content. – Reuters\n\nThousands of police and anti-racism protesters gathered on streets across Britain on Wednesday to challenge expected far-right groups that failed to materialise following more than a week of violent racist attacks targeting Muslims and migrants. – Reuters\n\nThe president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany and a prominent Christian Democratic Union (CDU) politician urged Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government to intervene militarily on the side of Israel in response to an Iranian regime attack on the Jewish state. – Jerusalem Post\n\nBritish Jews documented nearly 2,000 antisemitic incidents in the first half of 2024, the highest-ever tally for a six-month period that marked a 100 percent increase over the same time span last year. – Times of Israel\n\nUnited States\n\nBefore Vice President Kamala Harris confronted pro-Palestinian and anti-Gaza-war protesters on Wednesday at a campaign rally in Detroit, she faced demands from the leaders of a group that has mobilized voters to protest the U.S. government’s support for Israel […]In addition to an arms embargo on Israel, the Uncommitted leaders have asked for convention speaking roles for a representative of their group and a Palestinian pediatrician. – New York Times\n\nProsecutors in the U.S. criminal tax case against Hunter Biden accused him of accepting payments from a Romanian businessman who sought to “influence U.S. government agencies” in connection with a criminal probe in Romania. – Reuters\n\nRepublicans are trying to stir up the bitter divisions over the Israel-Hamas war to disrupt a rare moment of Democratic unity. As Democrats were celebrating Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, having only recently quieted a feud over the war, critics in the GOP were accusing their rivals of snubbing Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro because he is Jewish and supports Israel. – Politico\n\nEditorial: But truly concluding this era in our national life will require more: finally bringing these men to justice, and justice to these men. Plea deals like the one that collapsed last week are an orderly pathway to a procedurally legitimate outcome. Pursuing them is the correct course from a practical standpoint — just not a political one. The administration didn’t manage to do the right thing last week. But the president still has a chance to correct course after November’s vote, unencumbered by electoral considerations. In doing so, he would leave as his legacy the end, finally, of a grim time for his country. – Washington Post\n\nEditorial: Bell is plenty progressive: He ran on criminal justice reform, access to abortion, gun control and “environmental access.” But he offers clear-eyed support of Israel, praising it as “the only democracy and strongest American ally in the Middle East” and affirming (as do most Americans) its “right to defend itself and go after those who perpetrated” the Oct. 7 atrocities. – New York Post\n\nEditorial: These twin losses for the far-left are significant because they signal that, contrary to a perception that the anti-Israel wing of the party is in the ascendancy, extreme anti-Israel positions can be politically damaging. Bush’s defeat shows that the party is far from having fallen into the grips of the anti-Israel voices, something that provides solace, even while digesting the thought that a pro-Israel Jew right now has little chance of making it onto the Democratic Party’s national ticket. – Jerusalem Post\n\nCybersecurity\n\nThe faulty CrowdStrike Falcon update that caused millions of computers around the world to malfunction was “a useful exercise” for understanding what Chinese-linked cyber operations focused on sensitive U.S. networks could accomplish, a top U.S. cybersecurity official said Wednesday. – CyberScoop\n\nThe U.S. State Department identified at least six Iranian government hackers allegedly responsible for a string of attacks on U.S. water utilities last fall and offered a large reward for information on their whereabouts. – The Record\n\nLia Tsur writes: First of all, be aware of this type of attack. Understand that those responsible for these messages are the Iranians who want to scare us. Do not pay attention, and certainly do not spread the information any further. Sending and spreading the information helps the Iranian enemy achieve its goal. Check every pop-up window on the computer or mobile device carefully, as well as every email that arrives with an attachment. Only after we are sure that the email is genuine (verify the email address with the sender or compare with previous emails sent), and only if we were expecting such an email, can we open it. – Jerusalem Post\n\nDefense\n\nThis is hallowed ground for the U.S. space program, where NASA set the course for moon landings decades ago. But Florida’s Space Coast, as this stretch of palm trees, subdivisions and rocket pads is called, has never seen anything quite as otherworldly as Elon Musk. – Wall Street Journal\n\nPresident Joe Biden says the U.S. isn’t at war anywhere in the world. But one giant asterisk to that claim is what’s been happening for nearly a year in the skies over the Red Sea. – Politico\n\nThe U.S. Army is considering holding a competition in fiscal 2025 for a next-generation interceptor to take out threats from unmanned aerial systems, Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano, program executive officer for missiles and space, told an audience Aug. 6 at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium. – Defense News\n\nThe U.S. Army is planning to release a refreshed missile defense strategy focused on needs in the 2040 timeframe to counter a wide variety of complex threats, according to Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, the service’s Space and Missile Defense Command commander. – Defense News\n\nDov S. Zakheim writes: Congress should revisit Rangel’s initiative. Compulsory service could do more than help to eliminate the military’s recruiting shortfalls. It would expose young people to fellow citizens who are not like themselves — whether racially, religiously, ethnically or in terms of gender — and thereby potentially help to bridge the bitter divides that plague our nation. – The Hill\n\nTaren Sylvester writes: The all-volunteer force was always intended to be supported by a stand-by draft. That being said, it should be understood — by political leaders, military leaders, and, perhaps more importantly, by the American public — that conscription is and must necessarily be the option of last resort. The political will that would be necessary to move the needle on any issue involving conscription is nearly insurmountable. As such, it is likely that the only circumstance where the reintroduction of conscription would be even plausible is a crisis of the highest order — the very same motivation that is spurring Ukraine, Taiwan, and many others to reexamine their conscription systems. – War on the Rocks"
