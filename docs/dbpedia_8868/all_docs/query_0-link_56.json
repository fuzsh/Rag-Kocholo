Intelligence and Counterintelligence Cooperation\n\nThe Participants will continue and will strive to deepen their cooperation in the field of intelligence and counterintelligence in accordance with the framework based on bilateral agreements, without prejudice to their national interests and in compliance with the legislation of each Participant.\n\n6. Cooperation in the sphere of combating serious and organized crime\n\nThe Participants will take actions to counteract the activities of SOC, in particular individuals and groups that are trying to infiltrate across Ukrainian society, have criminal influence in certain regions, including the temporarily occupied ones, and are actively used as a tool of hybrid warfare to counteract the processes of recovery and reconciliation in Ukraine.\n\nIn order to counter the activities of SOC, the Participants will take measures to:\n\nconduct joint operations to detect and suppress SOC;\n\nanalyze the criminal situation in the countries and identify the main risks from SOC;\n\nidentify and trace the proceeds and instrumentalities of SOC in view of facilitating seizure and, where appropriate, confiscation;\n\ncreate joint working groups and joint investigation teams of prosecutors and other parties, based on identified needs;\n\nfacilitate the provision of training and sharing of best practice.\n\nThe above measures are not exhaustive, and the Participants may pursue other forms of cooperation to achieve their goals in combating SOC.\n\nIV. COOPERATION IN THE MILITARY AND DEFENCE INDUSTRY\n\n7. Defence and military cooperation\n\nThe Participants will work together and with other partners of Ukraine to ensure that the Ukrainian defence and security forces are able to fully restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders as of 1991, as well as to increase Ukraine’s resilience so that it is sufficient to deter and defend against future attacks. This will include, but is not limited to, working together so that Ukraine’s military and non-military security institutions are able to perform effectively to European and Euro-Atlantic standards and are fully accountable to the Ukrainian people, Parliament and Government.\n\nThe Participants will work together on ensuring a sustainable force capable of defending Ukraine now and deterring Russian aggression in the future, through the continued provision of security assistance and modern military equipment, across the land, air, sea, space and cyber domains – prioritizing, but not limited to: air defence, artillery, long-range firepower, armoured vehicles, air force capabilities and other key capabilities.\n\nThe French Participant will, alongside other international partners, help Ukraine to enhance its ability to deter and defend against external aggressors by developing modern Future Defence Forces that are increasingly interoperable with NATO and contribute to NATO forces. This includes the development of a modern defence sector in Ukraine, and a pathway to a future in NATO.\n\nThe French Participant will assist Ukraine with preservation of its qualitative defence and military capabilities amid rapid, uncertain and challenging regional political and security transformation.\n\nIn the military field, without prejudice to their position in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the Participants propose to establish cooperation enabling the Ukrainian Participant to develop comprehensive military capabilities in the following fields, which are not exhaustive:\n\na. Military equipment, including through industrial cooperation, and particularly in the fields of artillery and air defence, but also in the fields of armoured vehicles, maritime security, military medical support, information technologies and mine clearance;\n\nb. Training of the Ukrainian defence and security forces, in a national capacity and in the European framework, including train-the-trainers programme, specialized training in fields such as artillery, air defence, armoured vehicles, air forces and maritime security, new technologies and mine clearance;\n\nc. Initial support and support for the launch of maintenance by manufacturers, on the ground where necessary;\n\nd. Structural support for reform of the defence sector;\n\ne.

Support for border protection and defence, its engineering and fortification, surveillance, monitoring of enemy troop movements, post-war reconstruction of border infrastructure, demining and disposal of explosive ordnance;\n\nThe French Participant will support plans and governance structures for Capability Coalitions in the framework of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, by playing a leading role in the coalitions on Artillery and Air Defence, and by participating in the coalitions on Air Force and Maritime Security, and other coalitions, to which the French Participant may contribute, both to deliver the future force and to bring more coherence to the provision of capability in the current war.\n\nThe bilateral fund for security and defence assistance to Ukraine, in good coordination with the European Peace Facility, will help support these cooperation efforts in the relevant fields.\n\nFrance provided Ukraine with a total of 1.7 billion€ in military aid in 2022 and of 2.1 billion€ in 2023. In 2024, France will provide up to 3 billion euros in additional support.\n\nThe Participants will seek to ensure that Ukraine’s military capabilities are at such a level that, in the event of external military aggression against France, Ukraine is able to provide effective military assistance. The terms, format and scope of such assistance will be determined by the Participants.\n\nThe French Participant will continue its support to Ukraine for the ten-year duration of this Agreement.\n\n8. Defence industry cooperation\n\nThe Participants will strive to cooperate in the field of the defence and security industry, including with the objective of promoting cooperation between their defence industries and strengthening standardization and interoperability of their defence equipment. The Participants will seek, as far as possible, to develop an industrial partnership involving French and Ukrainian defence businesses and, as far as possible, free of restrictions from third parties.\n\nThe French Participant will contribute to the development of Ukraine’s defence industrial base, including through French investments, the localisation of production in Ukraine as well as joint production for manufacturing of priority weapons and ammunition.

The dialogue between the Direction Générale de l’Armement and the Defence Procurement Agency will also be enhanced, in line with the Letter of Intent signed between the two organizations during the visit of France’s Minister of Armed Forces in Kyiv in September 2023.\n\nThe French Participant will support Ukraine’s efforts to integrate its defence industry into NATO and EU defence and security frameworks.\n\nV. COOPERATION IN THE CIVIL FIELD\n\n9. Humanitarian assistance\n\nThe French Participant will continue its humanitarian assistance to fulfil the immediate needs of the Ukrainian population in the face of the armed aggression by the Russian Federation. It will also contribute, alongside its partners, to the economic recovery, reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine, in order to restore and strengthen its economic stability, reduce its dependencies and vulnerabilities and build a more solid, innovative, sustainable and resilient economic and industrial base, particularly in the context of negotiations for the accession of Ukraine to the European Union.\n\nThe French Participant will seek to continue over time the support underway for Ukraine, including in the transport, energy, agriculture, water, humanitarian mine clearance, critical infrastructure, digital, housing and health sectors.\n\nThe French Participant will use the economic and financial instruments at its disposal, in cooperation with all relevant international organizations and its partners.\n\n10. Support to Ukraine’s reform agenda\n\nThe French Participant welcomes the decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and commends the substantial progress that Ukraine has made towards meeting the objectives underpinning the accession process.\n\nThe Ukrainian Participant will strive to continue its ambitious reform path, particularly in the framework of its European Union accession process, to meet the obligations required for EU membership. The Ukrainian Participant will continue its systemic reforms in the defence and security sectors, including as regards civil control of the armed forces and the efficiency and transparency of the defence institutions and defence industry of Ukraine. It will strive to deepen the key reforms in the fields of justice and rule of law, the fight against corruption and money laundering, the modernization of its state apparatus, decentralization, the protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities, transparency and good governance in both the economic sector and the defence and security sector. The implementation of these reforms will contribute to strengthening democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the modernization and resilience of the Ukrainian economy.\n\nThe French Participant reaffirms its intention to fully support the objective of Ukraine’s accession to the European Union. With this in mind, the French Participant will provide technical support for the implementation of the necessary reforms, particularly as regards the rule of law, justice sector reform, the fight against corruption, the modernization of the state apparatus, decentralization, transparency and civil control in the defence sector, including demining. To this end, the French Participant will provide for the deployment of technical experts embedded in the Ukrainian administration.\n\n11. Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction\n\nThe French Participant will strive to continue fostering the involvement of private companies, local government bodies and non-governmental organizations in the reconstruction process, following on from the actions launched at the Conference for Ukraine’s Resilience and Reconstruction that was organized in Paris on 13 December 2022.\n\nThe Participants recognise the need to unite efforts aimed at protecting the population and territories of Ukraine from the negative consequences caused by mines and undetonated explosive ordnance.\n\nTo this end, the French Participant will make use of the appropriate bilateral tools, in good coordination and optimizing as far as possible the leverage effect with European and private sector funds, including in the framework of the European Union’s Ukraine Facility which aims at preparing Ukraine for future membership of the Union by supporting its accession process.\n\nThe Ukrainian Participant will continue the implementation of all the reforms required in the framework of its European Union accession process and the Ukraine Plan.\n\nThe French Participant will support Ukraine to plan for the reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, to contribute to the vital stabilisation and socio-economic renewal, particularly in liberated and frontline areas and areas bordering Russia, to promote an inclusive social recovery and to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, including through work to support women, social protection systems and veterans.\n\n12. Compensation for losses, injuries and damages caused by Russian aggression\n\nThe Participants reaffirm the Russian Federation must pay for the long-term reconstruction of Ukraine. Consistent with France’s legal system, Russian sovereign assets in France’s jurisdiction remain immobilised until the Russian Federation has paid for damage it has caused to Ukraine. The French Participant, working with its partners, will continue to explore all lawful routes consistent with applicable contractual obligations and in accordance with EU and international law through which Russian assets could be used to support Ukraine.\n\nAs a priority, the Participants will continue to work together, along with G7 states and others, towards the establishment of a compensation mechanism to provide compensation for damage, loss or injury caused by Russia’s aggression, as envisage by the Statute of the Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine adopted by the Resolution of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe CM/Res(2023)3. In this regard, the Participants will explore appropriate options for the financing of a compensation mechanism to provide prompt and adequate compensation to victims of aggression.\n\n13. Sanctions\n\nThe Participants recognise the value of sanctions in restricting the Russian Federation’s and other aggressor-states’ access to the finance, goods, technology and services it is utilising in its aggression, in bearing down on Russia’s revenue streams, and to deter future attacks. The Participants will continue to work to ensure that the costs to Russia of its aggression continue to rise, including through sanctions and export controls.\n\nWhile the Russian Federation’s aggression towards Ukraine continues, the French Participant will remain committed, in the European framework, to pursuing robust sanctions against sectors of the Russian economy and those in the Russian Federation and outside who are supporting or profiting from the war, or assisting in sanctions circumvention in third countries. The French Participant will also take determined action with partners to tackle all forms of sanctions circumvention as well as to reinforce its own domestic resilience against Russia-linked illicit finance and elites.\n\nThe Participants will provide each other up-to-date appropriate information on the grounds for sanctions and other relevant information, in compliance with relevant obligations and national laws.\n\n14. Accountability\n\nThe Participants reaffirm their commitment to holding the Russian Federation accountable for causing losses or damage to individuals and entities, as well as to the state of Ukraine, as a result of its internationally unlawful acts in Ukraine or against Ukraine, including its aggression in violation of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nThe Participants reaffirm that there must be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities and that the Russian Federation must bear the legal responsibility, including making reparation for any damage caused by such acts, which will also help deter future attacks and support Ukraine’s recovery.\n\nThe Participants will seek to hold to account those responsible for war crimes and other international crimes, committed in or against Ukraine in the context of Russia’s war of aggression, consistent with international law, including by supporting the work of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine and the International Criminal Court to ensure allegations of war crimes are fully and fairly investigated by independent, effective and robust legal mechanisms.\n\nThe Participants will continue their engagement in the “Core group on options for the establishment of a tribunal on the crime of aggression against Ukraine”."
