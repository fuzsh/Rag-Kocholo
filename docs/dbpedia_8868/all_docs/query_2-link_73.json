        "text": "You need to replace a card we issued to you because it contains incorrect information that is due to a USCIS error\n\nIf you believe USCIS has made an error on your EAD, two options are available:\n\nIf your request does not require you to submit evidence (for example, the error is a clear typographical error), you may submit aservice request via the USCIS website. Please explain the error and include the correct information. Please select the “EAD Replacement due to USCIS Error” option when submitting your request. You must also return the card containing the error to the address below. Note: You must use the United States Postal Service (USPS) when returning your card. The use of other carriers (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL) is not available for this address.\n\nUSCIS\n\nLee’s Summit Production Facility\n\nAttn: I-765 Replacement Cards\n\n7 Product Way\n\nLee’s Summit, MO 64002\n\nIt will take approximately 30 days from the date the card is received for USCIS to process your request and, if USCIS determines it was due to USCIS error, to issue you a new card. Please retain your tracking information to ensure your card was properly delivered. This processing time frame does not account for USPS mailing/processing.\n\nPlease note, if while processing your request we find that the error was not due to USCIS error, you will be notified that you must follow the procedure for when a correction is needed and not due to USCIS error.\n\nOR\n\nIf your request requires you to submit evidence to demonstrate the error and necessary correction (for example, the error relates to the EAD’s validity period), or if you would like to use the existing mail-in process, you may submit a letter explaining the error and corresponding evidence, along with the card containing the error, to the address below. Note: You must use the United States Postal Service (USPS) when returning your card. The use of other carriers (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL) is not available for this address.\n\nUSCIS\n\nLee’s Summit Production Facility\n\nAttn: I-765 Replacement Cards\n\n7 Product Way\n\nLee’s Summit, MO 64002\n\nPlease note, while the option to mail in your letter and supporting documentation is available, we encourage you to use existing online tools, such as the SRMT, when appropriate. For more information about the SRMT process please visit Chapter 4 – Service Request Management Tool in the USCIS Policy Manual. Utilizing the SRMT may minimize the need for additional correspondence to be sent via mail (aside from your original card) and may help streamline the way in which we process your request.\n\nPlease ensure you retain any copies of supporting documentation you send to USCIS."
