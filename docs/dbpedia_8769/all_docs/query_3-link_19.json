        "text": "1) Ohrid Main Square\n\nOhrid Main Square is known as Krusevska Republika Square. It is not named for Nikita Kruschev, former leader of the Soviet Union. It is named instead in memory of the short-lived uprising against Ottoman rule in the town of Krusevo, Macedonia in 1903. There are several such squares in Macedonia. The Ohrid Main Square is one of them.\n\nThe Main Square opens up at the northern end of the Old Bazaar that reaches up from the waterfront. This is the touchstone of Ohrid. There are well tailored flower gardens, and walking spaces paved with marble.\n\nHere is the home of the fabled Chinar tree, said to be 1,000 years old. Minarets and church steeples loom nearby.\n\nThe vibes in the square are friendly. Inviting shops and cafes line the edges. There are many comfortable vantage points from which to observe fascinating Ohrid.\n\n2) Ali Pasha Mosque\n\nWithin the Old Bazaar of Ohrid the Ali Pasha Mosque lies. It is nearly on the Main Square, close to the 1,000-year old Chinar tree. The fountain in the square sprays and gushes. Many, many years have gone by. The history of the mosque is shorter than that of the tree, but it is long.\n\nThe Mosque was built in 1573 by Sulejman Pasha. It was intended as a place of worship and as a secondary school. A reliquary of the bygone rule of the Ottomans, the Mosque is one of the first mosques to be built in Macedonia.\n\nThe mosque is constructed of stone and fired brick. There were two minarets. One located on the south side of the mosque was demolished in 1912. The mosque was built with a central dome and an entrance hall covered with three domes. There is a tall minaret on the side. At times, the Square reverberates to the Adzan call to prayer.\n\nIncluded within the mosque compound are a Turkish bath and a mausoleum. Renovations and restorations have been carried out in recent years by the Turkish Directorate General of Foundations.\n\n3) Old Bazaar Street\n\nThe Old Bazaar ain't what it used to be. Or perhaps it never was a world-class market place. Ohrid has always been a religious and cultural center more then anything else. It shines not as a center for trade. So the bazaar is simple. It is just one street extending up from the waterfront to the Main Square of town, not a great distance.\n\nThe bazaar extends from the Square downhill to the waterfront or it reaches the square from the shore of Lake Ohrid, whichever way one chooses. It is a walk, no cars. The street is variously paved with cobblestones in the narrow parts or with marble slates in the wider parts. In olden times, the street was covered with grape vines for shade.\n\nStarting from the Main Square, one passes through the food market (formerly an animal market). The few original stores of the bazaar are made of stone. The Ohrid market provides a very different experience than that of Greek or Serbian markets. The open market is not noisy. The merchants sell their foods with a calm not found elsewhere.\n\nAfter the food market is the Turkish bazaar. Here are kebabs, baklava, Turkish delights, and other foods in the Ottoman legacy. Shoemakers, barbers, leather shops, pearl makers and various other crafts may satisfy the pleasant needs of everyday.\n\n4) St. Clement Monument\n\nThe birth place of Saint Clement is not certain. He died in Ohrid, then part of the Bulgarian Empire, in 916. He was a scholar and writer and is credited with the creation of the Cyrillic alphabet. Under Boris I of Bulgaria he established Christian liturgy in Old Slavonic. Sofia University is also named \"Saint Kliment Ohridski.\"\n\nThe monumental statue of Saint Clement in Old Town Square is larger than life. He stands on a marble plinth cradling a model of the city of Ohrid with his left arm. He is studying the model while beckons the observer to come forward and take a look. \"Come here, look at this.\" He seems to be saying.\n\nSaint Clement was the founder of the Ohrid Literary School. He is properly regarded as a patron of Slavic language and education in the area of Ohrid and in Macedonia. He was the first archbishop of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and one of the Church's Seven Apostles. He is the Patron saint of North Macedonia and the city of Ohrid.\n\n5) National Workshop for Handmade Paper\n\nThe National Workshop for Handmade Paper in Ohrid stands as a remarkable cultural heritage site, maintaining the ancient art of papermaking, a technique dating back to the 2nd century BC China. This workshop is one of only seven globally that still practices this traditional method, providing a unique link to the past through its meticulous craftsmanship. The paper produced here is made entirely by hand, involving the pressing and drying of pulp without the use of modern technology, echoing the authentic processes used for centuries.\n\nA standout feature of the National Workshop is its replica of Johannes Gutenberg's 15th-century printing press, one of only two known replicas in the world. This press is not just a display piece but is actively used to print copies of historical documents, books, and artwork depicting local scenes, effectively bridging historical methods with contemporary appreciation.\n\nVisitors to the workshop have the opportunity to witness these traditional techniques in action. The skilled staff conducts live demonstrations of both papermaking and printing, offering an educational and immersive experience. This educational aspect is complemented by the workshop's small museum, where handmade paper products are available for purchase, allowing visitors to take home a piece of this enduring craft.\n\nLocated in a region with a history of papermaking that dates back to the late 16th century in the Monastery of Saint Naum, the National Workshop not only revives but also celebrates the rich historical lineage of Ohrid's papermaking tradition. This workshop offers a unique chance to experience and participate in the enduring legacy of one of humanity's most significant inventions â€” paper.\n\n6) Church of St. Sophia (must see)\n\nThe Cathedral of Saint Sophia was built in Ohrid in the 9th century by Boris II. It was rebuilt in the 11th century and provided with a domed basilica by Archbishop Leo of Ohrid. A Great Feast mural adorns the nave.\n\nIn the recess of the apse the Virgin Enthroned holds her son in a protective mandorla. Christ prepares bread and wine below. On the walls behind the altar platform (the \"bema\") is a sequence of scenes from the lives of Abraham, Saint Basil the Great and Saint John Chrysostum. Above the alcove where sacerdotales are kept are scenes of martyrdoms.\n\nThe church was dedicated to Holy Wisdom (\"Hagia Sofia\"). It was built on the foundation of an early Christian basilica of the 5th century. In the 15th century the church was converted to a mosque. The precious frescoes were white-washed. During their regime, the Ottomans caused a lot of damage to the church.\n\nAfter the Balkan Wars of 1912, Saint Sophia was returned to her role as an Orthodox Church and a conservation project was initiated. The frescoes were cleaned and rejuvenated and the church once again expressed the Byzantine world of the 11th century.\n\nEvery year the one-month Ohrid Summer Festival is opened by an operatic concert at Saint Sophia's. The first concert was in August, 1961. Inside the church, Macedonian opera star Ana Lipsha Tofovic and pianist Ladislav Peridic gave a bravura performance. It was a first for Ohrid and a first for the church.\n\n7) Ancient Theatre of Ohrid (must see)\n\nThe Ancient Theatre of Ohrid is a remarkable Hellenistic-period relic, dating back to 200 BC. It holds the distinction of being the only theater of its type in the country, contrasting with the Roman-era theaters found in Scupi, Stobi, and Heraklea Lynkestis. Originally designed to host a considerable audience, only the lower section of the theater survives today, making it difficult to ascertain its full capacity.\n\nStrategically nestled between two hills, the theater's location is ideal, providing natural wind protection which enhances its acoustics, a feature crucial for the live performances it was built to host. During the Roman era, the theaterâ€™s purpose expanded to include gladiator fights and it also served as a venue for executing Christians, which led to its growing unpopularity among the local populace. This disfavor ultimately resulted in the theater being buried by the locals following the fall of the Roman Empire, an act which inadvertently preserved much of its structure.\n\nThe theater remained hidden until the 1980s when it was accidentally uncovered during construction activities in the area. Discoveries of large stone blocks engraved with depictions of the Greek god Dionysus and the muses suggested the presence of a significant Greek cultural site, leading to its excavation.\n\nRevived in the late 1980s, the Ancient Theatre of Ohrid has been reintegrated into cultural life, hosting a variety of public performances including plays, concerts, operas, and ballet. It has also become a prestigious venue within the Ohrid Summer Festival, attracting international performances from renowned groups and artists like the Bolshoi and JosÃ© Carreras. This historical site not only serves as a testament to the architectural and cultural achievements of ancient times but also as a vibrant center of contemporary cultural expression.\n\n8) King Samoil Fortress (must see)\n\nOhrid fortress, popularly known as Tsar Samoil Fortress, is a restored medieval stronghold that occupies the top of Ohrid hill. The hill rises 328 feet above the waters of Lake Ohrid, giving the fort a commanding view over the lake, the city and surrounding countryside. The ramparts extend for two miles, varying in height from ten to 53 feet.\n\nThe fortress was built upon the ruins of an earlier fort built in the 4th century BC by none other than Philip II, King of Macedonia and father of Alexander the Great. King Samoil built his medieval style fortress on the remains of Philip's creation in the late 10th century AD.\n\nOhrid, known in ancient times as \"Lychnidos\", has been ruled by Romans, Byzantines, Slavs and Ottomans. They destroyed and rebuilt the fortress in turn several times. The fortress has served as a defensive asset and also as a residence. The citadel center is divided by a wall into two parts. The Emperor lived in one and soldiers in the other.\n\nThe wall surrounding this space has a row of towers. The main entrance is flanked by two semicircular keep-like defensive towers. The remaining part of the fort is wrapped by a defensive wall around a residential area for courtiers' families. In this second area is an ancient cemetery, the ruins of a donjon and a cistern.\n\nUntil the arrival of the Ottomans in 1395, the city was completely enclosed within the walls. Only the Upper and Lower Gates provided access to the town. After the Turkish involvement the town expanded beyond the walls. Christians were kept in the walled up hill section. The Ottoman quarter was outside on lower, more open ground.\n\nIn the year 2000 conservation and restoration efforts were started on the fort. The walls and towers of the citadel were repaired and preserved. From the archeological complex of Plaosnik there is a wooded path to the citadel. Admission is free.\n\n9) PlaoÅ¡nik Archaeological Site (must see)\n\nBarely 825 feet downhill from Samoil's Fortress on Ohrid hill is the Plaosnik Archeological Site, an ongoing excavation and research site of early Lychnidos, aka Ohrid. The main find on the site is the church built by Saint Clement in 893. The church was built on the foundation of an earlier Christian basilica.\n\nThe early basilica was dedicated to the legendary 4th century martyr, Saint Panteleimon, whose name means \"All-merciful.\" The Ohrid Literary School was founded on this site by Saint Clement in the 9th century. The school became the leading center of Slavic culture. Saint Clement was buried in this church in a tomb built by himself.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, Saint Clement's was converted into a mosque called the Imaret Mosque. The mosque was a memorial by Sinan Chelebi of the prestigious Turkish family of Ohrizade. The remains of the mosque were relocated in 2000. It had been covering the earlier Christian church and basilica.\n\nDiscoveries as of 2007 include the baptistery of the five aisled basilica. There are mosaic tiled mosaic floors dated from the 4th to 6th centuries. The mosaics show forms of fanciful animals, curvilinear geometrics, and swastikas as symbols of a nourishing sun. In 2007, 2,383 Venetian coins were discovered, linking Venice and Ohrid in trade."
