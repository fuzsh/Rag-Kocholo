        "text": "The study proposes a historiographic perspective on the image of women in the Middle Ages, as it is reflected in the historical literature of Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova. The material is designed not only to report the researches conducted in the field of gender studies, but also to illustrate the link between different historiographical approaches from the mentioned geographical area. To the theoretical and contextual nature of the studied thematic area is an added description of the impact of the Ottoman factor on the female daily, as it was caught in the impressions of foreign travellers who crossed South Eastern Europe. The emphasis on the details of the grouping results of research on women's history from the Middle Ages into three thematic cycles: general historical monographs, papers focused on privacy, thematic monographs specific to the gender studies.\n\nThe understanding of mutual help and social solidarity underlies the institution of the wakf, pious foundation.

The women of the palace and the women of the city and the nobles formed the consumer segment of the society. During the Tanzimat Period, discussions were started against the life of urban women in these conditions. These discussions gained speed during the Second Constituonal Era.
