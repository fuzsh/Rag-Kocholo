Pogradec alone occupies about 15 km². This city is surrounded by hills on the southern and western side. The lake is in the eastern and northern side of the city. The highway linking to Tirana, Elbasan and Korçë passes through the city. It is located SE of Elbasan, SW of Ohrid in the Republic of Macedonia, N of Korçë and NW of Florina in Greece. The name of the town is Slavic in origin: Pogradec = Po(d) (under) and Gradec (little town) and means literally “Under the little town”. This is a reference to the former Illyrian settlement, situated on a hill above Pogradec. It was known as İstarova or İstarye during Ottoman rule and was bounded to as kaza center in Görice Sanjak of Manastır Vilayet before Balkan Wars.\n\nCountry Albania\n\nCounty Korçë County\n\nDistrict Pogradec District\n\nElevation 697 m (2,287 ft)\n\nPopulation (2012)\n\n• Total 28,027\n\nTime zone Central European Time (UTC+1)\n\n• Summer (DST) CEST (UTC+2)\n\nPostal code 7301-7303\n\nArea code(s) 083\n\nWebsite http://www.bashkiapogradec.gov.al"
