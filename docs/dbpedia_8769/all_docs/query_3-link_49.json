        "text": "3 Days in Old Town Ohrid, Lake Ohrid\n\nTour of the Balkans\n\nOur tour of the Balkans continued to Ohrid in North Macedonia. Old Town Ohrid was a draw with its fairytale-like houses, cobblestone streets, and appealing location on Lake Ohrid.\n\nAs we headed south from Skopje and moved closer to the Adriatic Sea, we were hoping for a few more days with warm weather despite the fact that we were traveling in November.\n\nOur plan was to explore the Old Town, enjoy some local cuisine but also spend a day or two catching up on travel planning and the blog.\n\nBus From Skopje to Ohrid Bus\n\nWe gave ourselves plenty of time to catch a 10 am bus from Skopje to Ohrid and took a cab from our hotel to the bus station. We would normally pre-book our ticket but this time we took a chance.\n\nIt paid off nicely as the ticket attendant suggested we catch the 9 am bus, leaving 5 minutes later, instead of waiting for the 10 am bus. We quickly paid the 500 Macedonian denars each, $9.00, and darted out to the platform.\n\nWe boarded the full-size modern coach and settled in for the ride through the mountains. The scenery was phenomenal with a plethora of fall colors.\n\nA bit of sun, a bit of cloud, and a bit of rain. The journey is approximately 170 kilometers and about three hours in duration.\n\nWe made a 15 minutes coffee/bathroom stop at the summit on our way through the mountains. As we were getting closer to Ohrid we noticed a police presence along the highway. We later learned the President of North Macedonia was meeting his counterparts from Serbia and Albania.\n\nArriving in Ohrid we met the nicest older cab driver who knew our destination well. He told tales of Ohrid and pointed out what we should not miss on the short ride to Villa Jovan.\n\nVilla Jovan Guest House\n\nVilla Jovan is a quaint guest house and our choice for accommodation in Ohrid with a friendly host and a perfect location in the Old Town.\n\nOur room was not quite ready when we arrived so we left our bags and explored the area for half an hour before we were able to settle into a super cozy room. We had a view of the streets below but could not see the lake.\n\nWe enjoyed the atmosphere at Villa Jovan but be prepared for tight quarters, a narrow staircase, and a tiny bathroom, all part of the charm. Breakfast was included but at a nearby restaurant, owned by the same family.\n\nOn day three we ended up purchasing a small travel kettle for Turkish coffee and some Nescafe so we could start the day with a coffee in our room. Coffee/tea is key to us for a good start to a travel day. We booked three nights and paid $36.00 per night.\n\nGetting Acquainted With Ohrid\n\nThe first afternoon we strolled along the boardwalk in the Old Town and located our breakfast spot. As we approached the main pedestrian street, Boulevard Macedonia Educators, the sounds of a protest pierced the air.\n\nThe march was a response to the presidential visit. It was loud with fireworks and chants but disappeared as quickly as it appeared.\n\nA modern health food outlet along the main street, Fruit Box, quickly became one of our favorite stops. For those who know me well, I have been accused of having an oatmeal obsession. An oatmeal/fruit combo with almond milk for lunch, yes, please.\n\nA friendly young lady attended the store and we chatted for a while. She is headed to Toronto come spring where she will attend college. We were so thrilled with the food and service we frequented The Fruit Box three times during our short visit.\n\nDining in Ohrid\n\nFor our first dinner in Ohrid, we walked all of 100 meters down the street and picked an Italian Restaurant, Leonardo Pizza. We shared a salad and both enjoyed a pasta dish, had drinks and of course tiramisu for dessert. The service and atmosphere were great and the total came in at $16.00.\n\nOhrid Self-Guided Walking Tour\n\nWe were awake at the crack of dawn. Unfortunately, the internet was down and there was no coffee; great motivation to get you out of bed. Still, an hour before the breakfast restaurant opened, we found a downtown cafe and enjoyed coffee and free wifi under a heater while watching the city wake up slowly.\n\nThrilled by the promise of blue skies and fair weather we headed out for our self-guided walking tour. Armed with a map of the main attractions we set out on foot.\n\nSamuel’s Fortress\n\nWe zigzagged our way uphill in the direction of Samuel’s Fortress. Instantly charmed by the architecture, narrow streets, and quaint atmosphere of Old Town Ohrid.\n\nThe temperature had risen to the high teens and we could not believe our luck. Entrance fees to the fortress were 60 Macedonian denars each, $1.10.\n\nOhrid Fortress or Tsar Samuel’s Fortress is one of the largest fortification constructions in North Macedonia. Located on Ohrid Hill 100 meters above Lake Ohrid you get impressive views of the lake to the south and the town of Ohrid to the north.\n\nThe fortress has been destroyed and rebuilt many times throughout history and dates back to 209 BC.\n\nAncient Theatre of Ohrid\n\nWe had the pleasure of the company of a kind black labrador retriever on our walk from the fortress to the Ancient Theatre of Ohrid. Built in 200 BC the Ancient Theatre has a perfect location between the hills which equals great acoustics.\n\nAfter renovations, the outdoor theatre has been used for plays, concerts, operas, and ballet performances. During Roman times the theatre was used for gladiator fights.\n\nChurch of Saints Clement and Panteleimon\n\nAs we walked the grounds around the Church of Saints Clement and Panteleimon we were approached by a local man who appeared to be a tour guide. It took a split second to realize he was not an official guide and we declined his services.\n\nWhen we left the grounds he muttered in a disgruntled voice, “It is atrocious what happened here, you should hear the story.” Perhaps another time.\n\nChurch of St. John at Kaneo\n\nIf you have been researching North Macedonia you have probably stumbled upon a photo of the Church of St. John at Kaneo. The Instagram highlight of Ohrid.\n\nThe Church of St. John at Kaneo is located on the hill above Kaneo Beach with a magnificent view of Lake Ohrid. The construction date is unknown but likely the 13th century. We walked the grounds and had the site almost to ourselves.\n\nLunch Break at Kaneo\n\nOne of our most memorable highlights from Ohrid, and perhaps the best lunch during our 5050 travel project, was our lunch break at Kaneo Restaurant, located below the Church of St. John. It is an unassuming restaurant on the water’s edge.\n\nThe business was slow on this pristinely beautiful fall day. We ordered the Macedonia plate, which included tomato, marinated zucchini and eggplant, roasted paprika, sheep cheese, dill, ajvar, pindzur, garlic dip, prosciutto, and olives.\n\nAs we waited for our food, fresh supplies were delivered to the restaurant by a small motorboat. I was hanging out on the dock when a neighbor came for a visit and offered to help tie his boat to the dock.\n\nThe background music was soft jazz and after lunch, we leaned back in our chairs and soaked up the afternoon sun before ordering coffees and tiramisu to finish off.\n\nWe lingered much longer than we usually would for a lunch stop. The food and service were excellent. Stray kittens came to our table and we happily shared a few bites.\n\nThrough an online search, we found a physiotherapist who does sports massage and booked half-hour appointments for each of us.\n\nWe met at a hotel downtown and drove off to the clinic. She also works with the local handball team and was very good. My massage was run-of-the-mill back and neck but Di’s foot treatment was superb and gave her some much-appreciated relief.\n\nAfter our massage, we found a café near our guest house and pulled out our laptops to work for a couple of hours. The weather forecast had called for rain and sure enough, the skies opened up as expected. Such a contrast from the sunshine the day before.\n\nBack to the room for a short rest and then to finalize the details for our next move. Albania, it is. We booked accommodation in Tirana, Berat, and Gjirokaster. Another trip to the ATM proved necessary as we had to pay cash for our bus tickets from Ohrid to Tirana.\n\nDinner was at Viva Ksantika, another cozy place near our guest house. More North Macedonian specialties at a total cost of 625 MKD, or $12.00, including a tip.\n\nA final visit to the Fruit Box where we arranged breakfast to go as our bus was scheduled to leave at 7 am the following morning before the breakfast restaurant would open.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWe had a great time in Ohrid and we lucked out with amazing weather for our day of exploring in the area. Sometimes the weather forecast works in your favor. We struck a nice balance between work and pleasure and made good use of the rainy day to get some work and travel planning out of the way."
