        "text": "On August 1465, Ballaban Badera, a sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid who was an Albanian-born janissary launched his fourth but largest campaign against Skanderbeg. He was defeated in both battles of Ohrid and Vajkal the year before. Ballaban had previously inflicted severe casualties to Skanderbeg's forces and soon received high favor from Mehmet II. He soon appointed Ballaban and Jakup Arnauti—both Albanian peasants by birth—to lead a joint-campaign against Skanderbeg's forces. According to some scholars, this act of inclusion by the Sultan was a promotion of a social revolution within Albania to wean forces away from Skanderbeg. Whatever the motives, the Ottoman army marched forth with two separate forces: one from the south under Arnauti and the other, under Ballaban's personal command, from the east. Applying a pincer movement the goal of this action was to meet in central Albania in full force, storming what was supposed to be a hesitant Albanian defense. Skanderbeg, however, defeated both armies thoroughly by marching against Ballaban's column first, defeating it and engaging Arnauti's column afterwards with the same result.\n\nThe Battle of Bileća was fought on 27 August 1388 between Bosnian forces led by Duke Vlatko Vuković and the Ottomans under the leadership of Lala Shahin Pasha. Vlatkos army numbered 7,000 fighters from Bosnia, and Shahin Pashas army numbered 18,000 fighters. It was the first facing of Turks at Rudine, the Bosnians, although fewer, finally fought near the town of Bileća and gave them a defeat, which delayed the Ottomans' advances into Bosnia. Shahin Pasha escaped by fleeing, while the losses in the victorious ranks were insignificant. The Battle has left a great impression on the people of that era who engraved at the tomb of Duke Vlatko in Boljuni near Stolac the following inscription: Ase leži dobri čoek Vlatko Vuković. Vojvoda Vlatko je prvi pobijedio Turke kod Bileće 27. avgusta 1388.\n\nThe Battle of Dubravnica was fought in the summer of 1380 or December 1381, on the Dubravnica River near Paraćin in today's central Serbia, between the Serbian forces of Prince Lazar of Serbia led by commanders Vitomir and Crep and the invading Ottoman Turks of Sultan Murad I. The battle was the first historical mention of any Ottoman movements into Prince Lazar's territory. After this battle there is no record of any hostility between Lazar and the Turks until 1386. The Serbian army emerged victorious, although details of the battle itself are scarce. The victory temporarily slowed the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans. Here the Turks got a taste of what was to come.After being defeated two more times before the bloody Battle of Kosovo, Murad was all but ready to give up his Balkan Campaign altogether. But after the defeat of 1388 he decided to wait a full year before challenging the Serbs again to see if their coalition would survive the initial rush of the previous victory.\n\nThe Battle of Gallipoli was fought in 1312, between the Byzantine Empire, Serbian Kingdom and Republic of Genoa against Turcopoles led by Halil Pasha. For two years, Thrace was occupied by Halil Pasha. The Byzantine emperor, Michael IX, raised an army and confined the Turcopoles to the Gallipoli peninsula. He was aided by troops sent by Serbian King Stefan Uroš II Milutin numbering some 2000 Cumans or Serbs, while the Genoese prevented the Turcopoles from escaping by sea. Halil himself and the Turcopoles were massacred. Few of the Turcopoles returned to Byzantine service."
