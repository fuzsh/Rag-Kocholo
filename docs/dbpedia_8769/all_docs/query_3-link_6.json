        "text": "By bus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe easiest way to get to Ohrid is from Skopje, where buses run about once an hour. A bus from Skopje takes about 3½ hours and costs at least 830 denars one way or 1,180 denars round-trip. Timetable: Ohrid - Skopje: 05:00**, 05:30, 07:15**, 07:30, 10:45, 12:45, 15:00, 17:45, 19:00*, 20:30**.\n\nAnd for coming back: Skopje – (Kičevo) – Ohrid: 05:30, 06:00, 06:55*, 07:00*, 08:00, 08:30*, 09:00*, 10:00, 11:00, 14:00, 14:45, 15:30, 16:00, 16:30, 17:30, 18:30, 19:30* (*Jun-Aug only). In the summer, travellers to Skopje might want to buy a ticket a day or two in advance.\n\nThere are also several buses a day from Bitola, and a few direct buses from several other major Macedonian cities. Frequent local buses (40 denars) and shared taxis (100 denars) to Struga.\n\nFrom Albania, there is a bus line from Vlore (passing Durres and Tirana). Departure time from Ohrid to Albania: 04:30 and 05:40. From Tirana's international bus station, the bus to Ohrid leaves at 13:00; the fare, as of 2017, is €20. It is also possible to travel from Tirana or Elbasan to Struga on one of several daily Tirana-Skopje buses, and to take a local bus from Struga to Ohrid.\n\nIt's a little bit trickier to get to Ohrid from Greece. From Thessaloniki, the easiest way is to take a train to Skopje and then hop on a bus to Ohrid.\n\nIf you want to reach Ohrid and North Macedonia from Montenegro there is an overnight bus (operates only on Sundays) from Herceg Novi to Skopje via Albania, passing through Kotor, Budva, Bar and Ulcinj. Ticket price vary from place in Montenegro and most expensive is from Herceg Novi and cost around €25.\n\nThere is no railway in Ohrid. The closest passenger stations are in Kichevo (which, as of 2017, only has 1 train a day from Skopje) and Bitola (with 5 trains to Skopje). On the Albanian side, the railway to the nearby Pogradec was closed in 2012; the closest operating station is in Librazhd.\n\nFortifications\n\n[edit]\n\nThe old town is circled with walls, which are crowned with Tsar Samuel fortress. The first fortifications were built in the 5th century BC, but the oldest remains preserved are from 3rd century BC. The fortifications were reinforced various times throughout history and what stands today is largely from the 10th century. There used to be four gates to the city: the Lower Gate - you'll reach it soon after you walk from the main square inside the old part of the town on “Car Samoil” street. It used to be the gate through which regular visitors entered the city in the ancient and medieval times, just one tower of it still stands; the Upper Gate - in ancient times it used to be connected with the ancient theatre by portico. It is well preserved due to the reinforcements made in the 16th century; the Front Gate - near St Mary's Celnica Church. It is the main entrance gate but just stands in traces today; and the Water Gate - the entrance in the city from the lake, the place where it used to stand is not known.\n\nTraditional residential architecture\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen the Turks came they settled on the flat land along the lake and that became the Muslim part of town and the part on the hills inside the walls was always the Christian part, with the bazaar as a meeting place. As the city grew and the Christians were not allowed to build outside the walls, Ohrid developed very specific architecture with tight narrow streets and tunnels (houses built over the streets). The houses had tiny yards usually enclosed in the ground floor, and the houses grew over the streets on the upper floors since the locations were small. The steep terrain enabled everybody to have a good view of the lake and because of the strong sun the houses were painted white, so they would reflect the sun. Because of the winds from the lake, the houses in Ohrid don't have the open spaces that traditional houses in other towns in North Macedonia have.\n\nInteresting houses can be seen all over the old town, but the best examples are along Car Samoil and Ilindenska streets. Robevci & Uranija houses are the two best examples of traditional architecture. They are houses of very rich families (normally the houses were not this big). Especially rich in terms of architecture is Uranija house, with entrances on different levels and inside galleries. They have been turned into museums today. If you don’t have time, visit just Uranija, which is free, though the top level of Robevci has great views, nice wood carvings, and some furniture (100 denars entrance). The house next to St. Gerakomija church is one of the few traditional houses that has been nicely and carefully preserved. It has been turned into a hotel now; Kanevce House On the right from the main façade of St. Sophia church, is the small house that belonged to Kanevce family. It has beautiful proportions and it is a good example of how they built on small locations.\n\nA couple of these historic homes were the birthplaces of notable Macedonians and are preserved as museums:\n\nOther historic neighborhoods in the old town include:\n\nBooks\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks from Ohrid to read on the beach or take home.\n\nSome of the modern buys in this birthplace of Cyrillic literacy, include books from Happy Something Press, Ohrid's book publisher in English, founded by Macedonian born author and Oxford University student Evangelina Cifliganec known for her contemporary novel \"Happy Something\". Its 2nd edition was published by the publisher's Ohrid branch, HappySomething.com, as the author was said to be inspired by Ohrid. You might find it easier online as the price of the English version there is higher and not always in stock.\n\nA Passage through the Fog is a book that has been written in Ohrid by the Ohrid born writer and photographer Misho Yuzmeski. Dr. Michael Seraphinoff, in his Translator`s note on the book has written: \"Misho Yuzmeski's novel invites the reader to join his young narrator on a journey of discovery through the heart of modern Europe. While this journey offers certain narrow insights into modern day city life in England and a few of the continent's major cities, it is the internal journey of the young traveler that is at the heart of this novel. Readers are liable to find parallels to some youthful search for meaning of their own in Michele's journey. He reminds us of a critical time in many of our lives, when childhood is finally behind us, but the road ahead is quite uncertain.\" A copy of the book can be found in all Ohrid's bookstores and there is no difference in price between different stores. Bulgarian translation of the same book is available, as well.\n\nShort History of the Macedonian People by Risto Stefov was published in Ohrid in 2011. This book is a chronological outline of historical events involving Macedonia and the Macedonian people from ancient times to the present.\n\nNumerous book stalls can be found (at least in good weather during the tourist season) in the square near Ohrid harbour. They sell a variety of maps useful for tourists as well."
