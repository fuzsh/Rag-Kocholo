        "text": "Nestled along the shores of Lake Ohrid, the city of Ohrid, North Macedonia is a lovely Balkan destination known for its stunning natural beauty, ancient churches, and quaint old town. While Ohrid might not be the first place that comes to people’s minds for a European Holiday, it is a wonderful under-the-radar destination, perfect for those who want to experience a place with rich culture, delicious food, and lovely lakeside beaches – without the crowds or high prices of some of Europe’s more popular destinations.\n\nOhrid was one of my favorite cities I visited during my 4-month trip around the Balkans. Not only is there plenty to see and do in the area, but the locals are warm, the food is delicious, and the town is truly beautiful.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about visiting Ohrid, North Macedonia!\n\n**This post contains affiliate links, which means I earn a small commission on purchases made through these links. All opinions are my own.\n\nWhat to Know Before Going to Ohrid\n\nHow Many Days Do You Need in Ohrid?\n\nYou could easily spend a week or more in Ohrid and not run out of things to do! Ohrid is a great base for exploring the surrounding region, and there are lots of incredible day trips and excursions you can take from the city.\n\nI would recommend staying at least 3 nights in Ohrid. If you have the time and really want to soak in the essence of the city and explore the surrounding areas, I would suggest staying 5-7 nights to enjoy the region at a relaxed pace.\n\nBest Times to Visit Ohrid\n\nWhile Ohrid is still a relatively undiscovered destination for international travelers, it is a popular vacation spot for Macedonians and Albanians. Summer is peak season, so it will be the most crowded. I suggest visiting in shoulder season, either April-May or September-October, for nicer weather and fewer crowds.\n\nCurrency Used in Ohrid\n\nThe local currency is the Macedonian Denar (MKD). Credit cards are widely accepted, but I highly suggest carrying cash on you to purchase from small shops and handcrafted items. Make sure to look up the current exchange rates online so you don’t overpay when exchanging for Denars.\n\nOhrid’s Primary Language\n\nThe Language spoken in Ohrid is Macedonian, which uses the Cyrillic alphabet. English is generally spoken in the tourist areas of Ohrid, so you won’t have to worry too much about the language barrier.\n\nHow to Get to Ohrid\n\nBy Car:\n\nSince you likely won’t be flying into the local Ohrid airport, the easiest way to get to Ohrid will likely be via car. If you don’t want to hire a car rental, I suggest booking a transfer from GetTransfer, where you can expect to pay between $90-$150 for a transfer from either Skopje International or Tirana International.\n\nIf you want the flexibility to explore more of the surrounding areas of this region, I suggest looking at your rental car options at Get Rental Car. Hiring a rental car in the Balkans is a great option, as it is difficult to take public transport to many places outside of towns and cities.\n\nIf you do decide to rent a car, just make sure to research if your hotel in Ohrid has parking, or if there are public parking lots close to your accommodation.\n\nBy Bus:\n\nUnless you fly into Ohrid’s airport, there are no buses that run directly from the airport to Ohrid. If you decide to travel to Ohrid by bus, you will need to take a bus or taxi to the Tirana or Skopje city center, and then catch the bus transfer from there. For this reason, if you decide you want to use public transport, I suggest spending a couple of nights in Tirana or Skopje before bussing to Ohrid (they are both great cities that are definitely worth visiting too)!\n\nIf you are already in the Balkans and plan to bus to Ohrid, here is a list of cities with buses that go directly to Ohrid:\n\n🚌From Macedonia: Skopje, Bitola, Kičevo, Struga, Prilep, Veles, Tetovo\n\n🚌From Albania: Tirana, Durres, Elbasan\n\n🚌From Greece: Thessaloniki\n\n🚌From Kosovo: Pristina\n\nIf you will be coming from a different location in the surrounding area, you will likely have to first travel to one of the above cities and then transfer to a direct bus to Ohrid.\n\nBest things to do in Ohrid North Macedonia\n\nShop Along the Old Bazaar Street\n\nThe Old Bazarr Street is one of the most iconic spots in Ohrid, filled with shops selling traditional crafts, souvenirs, and local goods. It’s a great place to experience the local culture and pick up unique handmade items. If you or someone you care about loves jewelry, make sure to purchase authentic Lake Ohrid pearls, which are made through a unique process using fish scales.\n\nYou should also keep an eye out for traditional filigree, which is delicate and intricate jewelry made using traditional silver filigree techniques. Also make sure not to miss the local markets, where you can buy fresh produce and traditional snacks!\n\nRelax at the Ohrid City Square\n\nThe Ohrid City Square is the central hub of Ohrid and is a great starting point for exploring the city. The Square is home to several notable buildings, including the City Hall and St. Clement of Ohrid statue. The city square is also the meeting point for many local tours and excursions you might take while in Ohrid.\n\nTake a Boat Tour of Lake Ohrid\n\nOne of the best ways to experience Lake Ohrid is by taking a boat tour! Not only will you get beautiful views of the city from a different perspective, but many of Ohrid’s boat tours will also take you on excursions to nearby attractions. I personally went on this boat tour on Viator, which takes you to the Bay of Bones Museum and Saint Naum Monastery. For just over $20 for a 7-hour excursion, it is absolutely worth booking and in my opinion, is a “must-do” when visiting Ohrid.\n\nTake in the views at Ohrid’s Fortress\n\nOhrid’s Fortress – also known as Samuel’s Fortress, offers some of the best panoramic views of Ohrid city and Lake Ohrid. The fortress dates back to the 4th century BCE and holds a deep historical significance to the city of Ohrid. I suggest walking the full 3km length of the fortress walls so you can really take in the beautiful surrounding views.\n\nTake a Tour of the National Workshop for Handmade Paper\n\nThe National Workshop for Handmade Paper is a local workshop that continues the ancient tradition of handmade papermaking and printing, which has been passed down through generations. Live demonstrations are performed for visitors, and you may even get the chance to make your own handmade paper using their paper press! The workshop is also home to a replica of a Gutenberg printing press (one of two in the world!), which is used to print text and imagery on handmade paper.\n\nThe shop also sells beautiful handmade paper products, which make for a wonderful and unique souvenir to bring home from Ohrid.\n\nVisit the Robevci Family House\n\nThe Robevci Family house is a beautifully preserved traditional 19th-century house that has been converted into a museum. It provides a glimpse into the life of the wealthy Robevci family from that era and is a great way to learn about the city’s cultural heritage.\n\nTake a Stroll Down the Ohrid Boardwalk\n\nOhrid’s boardwalk is a scenic boardwalk that runs along the edge of Lake Ohrid, offering stunning views of the water and surrounding mountains. It’s the perfect place to take a relaxing walk, go cycling, or enjoy a meal or drink at one of the many waterfront restaurants.\n\nVisit Ohrid’s Most Iconic Churches\n\nIt has been rumored that Ohrid once was home to 365 churches – one for every day of the year. There are still many churches sprinkled throughout the city with great historical significance that are so worth visiting!\n\nChurch of Saint Sophia\n\nThe Church of Saint Sophia is one of the most important medieval monuments in North Macedonia, dating back to the 11th century. Inside you will find colorful and beautifully preserved frescos, as well as art and architecture preserved from the middle ages.\n\nChurch of Saint John the Theologian\n\nThe church of Saint John at Kaneo is one of Ohrid’s most iconic landmarks. Dating back to the 13th century, the church is perched on a cliff overlooking Lake Ohrid, offering THE BEST views and arguably the best sunset spot in the city! This church is actually one of the most photographed sites in Macedonia because of these views (and I’m sure you’ll want to take a few yourself too)!\n\nChurch of Saints Clement and Panteleimon\n\nChurch of Saint Clement and Panteleimon is situated on Plaošnik Hill and is Ohrid’s most sacred church. It was built in the 9th century by Saint Clement, on top of the ruins of an even earlier church. It’s said that this church was also the site of the first Slavic university, so needless to say, it holds a great historical significance to the region! Plaošnik Hill is also just a beautiful area to walk around and take in the views of the surrounding areas.\n\nRelax at Ohrid’s Beaches\n\nOhrid is home to many beautiful lakeside beaches. Here are 3 of Ohrid’s best beaches that I suggest visiting:\n\nGradiste Beach: Known for its clear waters and lively atmosphere.\n\nLabino Beach: A quieter, more secluded spot, perfect for relaxation.\n\nKaneo Beach: Offers stunning views and is close to the Church of Saint John The Theologian.\n\nTake a Cooking Class\n\nBelieve me when I say you will fall in love with Macedonian food after dining at Ohrid’s traditional restaurants and are going to miss it once you’re home. The solution? Learn how to make some of the best traditional Macedonian dishes by attending a cooking class! I suggest booking this traditional cooking class on Viator, where you will learn how to make komat with cheese & spinach, tavče gravče, pindzur, and sutlijash (all amazingly delicious dishes).\n\nParaglide above Lake Ohrid\n\nFor the adventurous traveler who wants to take in the incredible scenery of Lake Ohrid from above, paragliding is a thrilling excursion guaranteed to create a memory that will last a lifetime! In many countries, paragliding is an expensive excursion that can cost several hundred dollars for one flight, but not in North Macedonia! You can book this top-rated paragliding excursion for just $88, which is a total steal, in my opinion.\n\nEnjoy Traditional Macedonian Cuisine\n\nMacedonian food is absolutely delicious and I promise you will fall in love with the country’s traditional cuisine! There are lots of different types of dishes you should try. Here are some of the most traditional (and delicious) dishes you’ll find throughout Ohrid:\n\nTavče Gravče: Hearty dish of baked beans, often cooked in a traditional clay pot. It’s flavored with onions, peppers, and various spices, and is the definition of “comfort food”! This is one of North Macedonia’s most famous dishes and is a must-try when in the country.\n\nSarma: Cabbage leaves stuffed with a mixture of minced meat, rice, and spices. Sarma is common throughout the Balkans and the Macedonian spin on this dish is absolutely delicious.\n\nSirenje vo Furna: Baked cheese, often prepared with white-brined cheese (similar to feta) mixed with tomatoes, peppers, and herbs, then baked until melted and bubbly. As a cheese lover, this was my favorite Macedonian dish that I had! I am drooling just thinking about it!\n\nPastrmajlija: Traditional Macedonian pizza-like dish made with dough topped with pork or chicken, garlic, butter, and eggs. So yummy!\n\nPolneti Piperki: Peppers stuffed with ground meat, rice, and spices, then baked or simmered in a tomato sauce. This is one of the dishes that always felt hit the spot for me – seriously so nourishing and delicious!\n\nBanitsa (Burek): Burek is always my go-to snack in the Balkans, and Macedonian burek did not disappoint!! Burek is a flaky pastry made with filo dough and is filled with various ingredients such as cheese, spinach, or minced meat. My personal favorite is the cheese burek, which is perfect to eat at any time of the day.\n\nĆevapi: Grilled, mildly spicy sausages, usually served with chopped onions, fresh bread, and ajvar or sour cream. They are a staple of Balkan cuisine and are perfect for a cheap, quick bite to eat.\n\nOhrid Trout (Ohridska Pastrmka): Local Ohrid delicacy, made from a type of trout that is native to Lake Ohrid and is typically grilled or baked. It’s known for its delicate flavor and is typically served with lemon and herbs.\n\nPindzur: Traditional spread / condiment made from roasted peppers, garlic, and eggplants. This yummy treat can be served on top of food or eaten by itself as a delicious snack (fresh bread dipped in this is seriously soooo good)!\n\nSutlijash: Traditional dessert, which is a creamy rice pudding flavored with vanilla and cinnamon. A perfect sweet treat after a delicious meal!\n\nBest Day Trips to Take from Ohrid\n\nBay of Bones Museum\n\nThe Bay of Bones Museum is an open-air recreation of a prehistoric settlement that existed along Lake Ohrid during the Bronze and Iron Ages. It’s easily accessible by car, bus, or scenic boat tour.\n\nThe museum itself is really interesting and offers a glimpse into the daily lives of the inhabitants of the settlement. Walking through the reconstructed houses on stilts above the lake, you can almost imagine what life was like thousands of years ago.\n\nThe surrounding area is also stunning, with crystal clear turquoise water that almost resembles a tropical paradise. The lake’s pristine beauty provides a perfect backdrop for this historical site, making it not only fascinating but also incredibly picturesque!\n\nSaint Naum Monastery\n\nThe Saint Naum Monastery is a famous Monastery located along southern Lake Ohrid. It was founded in 905 AD by Saint Naum, who is also buried within the church. Over the centuries, it has been a popular pilgrimage destination and has attracted Orthodox visitors from all over the Balkans.\n\nThe location of the monastery is stunning, situated high on top of a cliff overlooking Lake Ohrid. The views of the lake from here are breathtaking, making it a perfect spot for reflection and relaxation. There is also a really nice walking path that takes you around the crystal-clear springs that surround the monastery. You can also take a boat ride along the springs, which are believed to have healing properties.\n\nInside of the monastery, you’ll find stunning frescoes and intricate wood carvings that tell the story of Saint Naum and various biblical scenes. Outside you will find the beautiful resident peacocks, which have called the monastery home for many years, roaming freely across the grounds of the property – such a unique and cool sight!\n\nGalicica National Park\n\nGalicica National Park is located about an hour south of Ohrid, situated between Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa. The park offers a beautiful mountainous landscape with breathtaking panoramic views of Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa. There are lots of hiking trails, making it the perfect natural getaway for the outdoorsy traveler. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can book an ATV tour of Galicica National Park that leaves from Ohrid. There is a shorter 2.5-hour ATV tour available, as well as a full-day ATV tour available, which you can choose from based on your budget and the amount of time you’d like to spend in the park.\n\nStruga\n\nStruga is a charming town located just 15 minutes from Ohrid. It’s a super easy bus or car ride away and is the perfect day trip if you love quaint towns with local artisan shops and traditional restaurants. Struga also has the river that flows out of Lake Ohrid running right through it! Walking along the river and seeing where it emerges from the lake is such a cool experience!\n\nWhere to Eat & Drink in Ohrid\n\nBest Restaurants in Ohrid\n\nFisherman’s House Kaneo\n\nIt doesn’t get much more local than this! Fisherman’s House is a cozy family-owned restaurant serving seafood and traditional dishes. The owner goes out on the lake every morning to catch fresh fish that is served later the same day, so it literally could not be more fresh! I highly recommend dining at this restaurant for an authentic taste and experience of Ohrid.\n\nKaneo Restaurant & Letna Bavcha\n\nA popular restaurant located right on the water, Kaneo Restaurant is the perfect spot for a meal with a nice view and good vibes. Delicious local dishes and fresh seafood are served here, and there is beautiful lake views to savor while you eat!\n\nSu Rooftop Restaurant\n\nThis is a rooftop restaurant located in Su Hotel, known for its international fusion dishes and spectacular views of the lake and city. Definitely a great option for a relaxing and delicious bite to eat.\n\nBest Cafes in Ohrid\n\nFort Cafe\n\nCozy cafe just steps away from Ohrid’s fortress. Not only does Fort Cafe offer delicious food and drinks, but also stunning views of the city and Lake Ohrid.\n\nLiquid Cafe\n\nLiquid Cafe is a trendy cafe located on the water, in the heart of Ohrid. It’s atmosphere makes it the perfect place to grab a morning coffee or a drink while watching the sunset.\n\nShilla Coffee & Bar\n\nModern cafe in the city center offering delicious drinks and small bites. Shilla also offers a great variety of healthy smoothies, which are perfectly refreshing for a hot summer day along the lake.\n\nWhere to Stay in Ohrid\n\nOhrid offers many lovely accommodation options and is in general quite affordable. I suggest booking accommodation by the lake or in the old town for the most convenience. If you have a rental car, make sure to research if there is parking available or if there is a public parking space you can park your car at nearby overnight.\n\nHere are some of the best places to stay in and near Ohrid, for every budget:\n\nLuxury:\n\nVilla Bella Ohrid\n\nBeautiful and fully equipped rooms, an indoor pool, breakfast, mountain and lake views, and a lovely garden are just some of the amenities offered here. An all around wonderful stay that’s perfect for couples!\n\nHotel & Spa Tino Sveti Stefan\n\nWith luxurious rooms, beautiful lake views, and an on-site spa and Turkish bath, Hotel & Spa Tino Sveti Stefan is the perfect place for relaxation and restoration.\n\nVilla Sophija\n\nVilla Sophija offers luxurious rooms with a beachfront location in Ohrid.
