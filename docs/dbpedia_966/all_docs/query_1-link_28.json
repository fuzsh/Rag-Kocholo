        "text": "On December 1, MISIA will release her new album, “HELLO LOVE.” This album comes almost exactly three years after her last one, “Life is going on and on.”\n\n“HELLO LOVE” will come in a 2CD limited edition and a CD only regular edition. The second CD that comes with the limited edition will contain remixes.\n\nOne of the new songs on MISIA’s upcoming album is “Higher Love”, a collaboration with Fujii Kaze. He composed the song, and participated in its recording, where he was in charge of the organ, piano, and chorus. This is the first time that Kaze has provided music for another artist. “Higher Love” was arranged by trumpeter Kuroda Taku, and features the Harlem Gospel Choir on the chorus.\n\nThe collaboration between MISIA and Kaze came about after he attended her 2019 concert in New York. MISIA couldn’t wait to work with him. When thinking of his collaboration with MISIA, “gospel” was the keyword that came to Kaze’s mind.\n\n“Higher Love” was released digitally today. Check out the music video for it below!\n\nCD\n\nWelcome One\n\nHello Love\n\nHigher Love\n\n想いはらはらと (Omoi Hara Hara to)\n\nずっとあなたと (Zutto Anata to)\n\n君の背中にはいつも愛がある (Kimi no Senaka ni wa Itsumo Ai ga Aru)\n\n愛にまだ揺れている (Ai ni Mada Yurete Iru)\n\nさよならも言わないままで (Sayonara mo Iwanai Mama de)\n\n木洩陽の記憶 (Komorebi no Kioku)\n\n好いとっと (Suitotto)\n\n歌を歌おう (Uta wo Utaou)\n\nLimited Edition CD2 (DJ EMMA HOUSE MIX)\n\n木洩陽の記憶 (DJ EMMA CLUB MIX) (Komorebi no Kioku (DJ EMMA CLUB MIX))\n\nsweetness (SATOSHI TOMIIE SWETTER 12″ REMIX)\n\nINTO THE LIGHT (15th ver.)\n\n好いとっと (DJ EMMA Remix) (Suitotto (DJ EMMA Remix))\n\nTHE GLORY DAY (DJ EMMA NEW REMIX)\n\nSHININ’ ~虹色のリズム~ (Club Love NY Vocal Radio Mix) (SHININ’ ~Nijiiro no Rhythm~ (Club Love NY Vocal Radio Mix))\n\nRe-Brain\n\n時をとめて (MALAWI ROCKS Sunshine Mix) (Toki wo Tomete (MALAWI ROCKS Sunshine Mix))"
