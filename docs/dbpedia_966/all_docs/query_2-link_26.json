        "text": "There‚Äôs nothing quite so compelling, heart-wrenching or soul-shaking as a really top notch love song. The best can conjure up a euphoric urge for you to belt along, or reduce you to a sad, quivering, emotional wreck.\n\nBut the genre is, as we know, an incredibly saturated market, and we‚Äôve been writing love songs since the Dark Ages after all. Don‚Äôt stress your little heart out too much, though, as we‚Äôve put in the legwork to bring you this roundup of the very best lovey-dovey tunes, from a 1950s hit by The Flamingos to the dulcet tones of Beyonc√©.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nüçÜThe sexiest songs of all time\n\nüíãThe best R&B love songs\n\nüíîThe best breakup songs\n\nüé∫The best soul songs\n\nThis guide was recently updated by NYC-based arts and culture journalist Alessandra Schade. Entries are by Time Out Editors. For more about how we curate, have a look at our editorial guidelines.\n\n1. ‚ÄòAt Last‚Äô by Etta James\n\nThe most unapologetically romantic slow-dance‚Äìwedding‚Äìlove-scene song in history, Etta James‚Äôs 1960 cover of ‚ÄòAt Last‚Äô may seem a bit clich√©. But from the first note, we all know what‚Äôs coming (love! finally!), and James‚Äôs soulful crooning induces a shiver every time, whether we expect it to or not. Case in point, pretty much everyone lost it during Beyonc√©‚Äôs rendition at the 2009 presidential inauguration ball for Obama including the First Lady and President himself. Cuuute.\n\n2. ‚ÄòAll of Me‚Äô by John Legend\n\nFor a decade now, ‚ÄòAll of Me‚Äô has been the veritable go-to wedding song across the globe. And for good reason. ‚ÄòAll of Me‚Äô is a dedication to Legend‚Äôs then fiancee, now wife, Chrissy Teigen, and serves as a love letter to significant other‚Äôs everywhere. The earnest piano ballad, boasting the moving lyrics, ‚ÄòLove your curves and all your edges/ all your perfect imperfections‚Äô has made this love song one of the greatest of our generation. And the stats come to support that. According to Spotify, ‚ÄòAll of Me‚Äô is the most-added song in user‚Äôs ‚Äòlove‚Äô themed playlists for lovers of the streaming generation.\n\nAlessandra Schade\n\nContributing Writer, Music\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Stay Together‚Äô by Al Green\n\nThe lyrics to the Reverend‚Äôs landmark 1971 love song, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Stay Together‚Äô articulate the solemn vows of marriage: ‚ÄòWhether times are good or bad, happy or sad.‚Äô But sung by Green, these promises are given wings. Covered multiple times since its release, Green‚Äôs gorgeous original was given a new lease on life in ‚Äô94, when Quentin Tarantino featured it in Pulp Fiction. But our favorite boost for the song has to be when it was sung by Barack Obama at a fund-raising event in 2012.\n\n4. ‚ÄòAll Night‚Äô by Beyonc√©\n\nWhen Beyonc√©‚Äôs hour-long visual album Lemonade hit the internet in 2016, the entire nation explored the intense range of emotions of marital infidelity: betrayal, jealousy, rage, and revenge. ‚ÄòAll Night,‚Äô which wraps up the 12-track masterpiece (and is reportedly Beyonc√©‚Äôs favorite song from the record), brought something different to the table. Perhaps less sexy than the hell-hath-no-fury revenge tracks on the project, the powerful love ballad gave us a tender and compassionate ode to healing heartbreak and moving on. And what is more moving than selfless love? ‚ÄòAll Night,‚Äô with its soulful vocals and haunting guitar, will forever encapsulate the seldom-explored topic of reconciliation and preservation in long-term commitments.\n\nAlessandra Schade\n\nContributing Writer, Music\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. ‚ÄòNothing Compares 2 U‚Äô by Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor\n\nWhile originally penned by Prince, ‚ÄòNothing Compares 2 U‚Äô became Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs most iconic song, with its haunting sound remaining as an enduring symbol of the ‚Äò90s. As is the case with other seminal love songs, it's often the delivery of a song‚Äôs lyrics that make the track timeless. The Irish singer‚Äôs ethereal vocals and raw intensity ignite the song with heartbreak. O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs rendition of Prince‚Äôs song is a stirring moment of emotional catharsis, a performance that draws from trauma and vulnerability, and portrays a type of pain that will tremble even the stiffest of upper lips.\n\nAlessandra Schade\n\nContributing Writer, Music\n\n6. ‚ÄòSomething‚Äô by the Beatles\n\n‚ÄòSomething‚Äô was the first George Harrison-written song to occupy the A-side of a Beatles single (though it did share the accolade, appearing as a double A-side with unifying call ‚ÄòCome Together‚Äô in 1969). Capturing the swirling triumph of infatuation, the tune would become the second-most-covered song of the Beatles‚Äô canon (‚ÄòYesterday‚Äô is the first). More than 150 artists have tried the dreamy, swooning ode on for size, including James Brown, Elvis Presley, Phish, Isaac Hayes and Frank Sinatra, who famously christened it the ‚Äògreatest love song ever written.‚Äô\n\nAdvertising\n\n7. ‚ÄòGod Only Knows‚Äô by the Beach Boys\n\nIn 1963, Brian Wilson was so obsessed with Phil Spector‚Äôs orchestral vision for the Ronettes‚Äô ‚ÄòBe My Baby‚Äô that he reportedly took to listening to it 100 times a day. Three years later, Wilson and the Boys would surpass the master with a song that lifted the notion of the sophisticated love song clean into the heavens. The uncertainty of the first line (‚ÄòI may not always love you‚Äô) is a classic pop curveball, which works with the swooping transition from intro to verse. Once that miasmic mix of harpsichords and celestial brass clears, and that opening caveat is laid bare, we‚Äôre left with a heartbreakingly tender song of yearning, of devotion and of fidelity. The song‚Äôs universality has turned it into an almost nondenominational and humanist hymn, blessed with an equivocal outlook that can magically give succor to all forms of love.\n\n8. ‚ÄòI Will Always Love You‚Äô by Dolly Parton\n\nDolly Parton‚Äôs farewell to her long-time partner and mentor, country legend Porter Wagoner, when she decided to pursue a solo career, became quite the sensation in 1974. It‚Äôs hard to think of a better song in pop culture that captures the ‚Äòif you love something, set it free‚Äô sentiment. While few of us‚Äîsave Whitney Houston‚Äîcan belt those high notes like Parton, that doesn‚Äôt stop us from wanting to sing along with the chorus, with all the same pent up passion.\n\nAdvertising\n\n9. ‚ÄòMy Girl‚Äô by the Temptations\n\nThis sugary ‚Äô64 chart-topper (the Temptations‚Äô first) might be the best puppy-love song ever. Penned by fellow Motown signees the Miracles, its instantly recognizable guitar riff (right up there with the one from ‚ÄòSatisfaction‚Äô), peppy finger snaps, unabashed optimism and comforting-as-a-much-needed-hug harmonies can make even the most jaded downer feel all warm inside.\n\n10. ‚ÄòSomeone Like You‚Äô by Adele\n\nWritten from the perspective of a woman who shows up at her ex‚Äôs front door only to discover that he‚Äôs married and has moved on, ‚ÄòSomeone Like You‚Äô is the ultimate ode to former lovers. The heartbreaking chorus‚Äô confused sentiment resonates with anyone who has ever tried to move on from their old flame, but is struggling. Adele‚Äôs passionate vocals and ambivalence to moving on gives color to the fantasy of going back to the one who got away and telling them: ‚ÄòBabe, it ain‚Äôt over for me, I haven‚Äôt moved on, I never will.‚Äô What is more powerful than unrequited love? Adele will answer this question for you.\n\nAlessandra Schade\n\nContributing Writer, Music\n\nAdvertising\n\n11. ‚ÄòHello‚Äô by Lionel Richie\n\nBanish from your mind‚Äôs eye the meltingly cheesy and vaguely creepy video for Lionel Richie‚Äôs 1984 No. 1 hit, with its plot about a teacher, a blind girl and the clay bust she molds of him. But give yourself over to the softer kitsch of the love song itself‚Äîthe slow build of anticipation, the rise and fall of the guitar solo, Richie‚Äôs tender vocals as he imagines spilling his heart out‚Äîand you may be surprised to find how well it has held up in the years since that rather unfortunate introduction.\n\n12. ‚ÄòWonderful World‚Äô by Sam Cooke\n\nIf there‚Äôs anyone out there whose heart doesn‚Äôt melt just a little bit when they hear the drum flutter that opens this 1960 swoon of a song, we‚Äôll eat our hat. ‚ÄòWonderful World‚Äô is lullaby-simple in its structure‚Äîof course one and one is two! Of course this one should be with you!‚Äîechoing the way that when love feels right, it‚Äôs somewhere between a no-brainer and a miracle. And no, we still don‚Äôt know what a slide rule is for.\n\nAdvertising\n\n13. ‚ÄòMaps‚Äô by Yeah Yeah Yeahs\n\nWhile the lyrics to this early aughts classic are fairly repetitive, they become almost like a mantra. ‚ÄòWait, they don‚Äôt love you like I do‚Äô is a thought perhaps way too many of us have had, whether spoken or not, as things start to fall apart in a relationship.\n\n14. ‚ÄòWhen a Man Loves a Woman‚Äô by Percy Sledge\n\nPercy Sledge‚Äôs R&B (and wedding-soundtrack) staple might be one of the most romantic-sounding songs of all time, but the 1966 hit‚Äôs lyrics basically boil down to this: Love fucks everything up‚Äîyour judgment, your pride, your friendships, your bank account, the roof over your head. It can be a powerful, fickle jerk, in other words. Oh, also: When you‚Äôre under its spell, it‚Äôs the absolute greatest thing in the world.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. ‚ÄòNothing Even Matters‚Äô by Lauryn Hill\n\n‚ÄòNothing Even Matters‚Äô might not have received as much recognition on Hill‚Äôs critically acclaimed The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill as other singles, but, looking back, it was a near perfect showcase for two of the ‚Äô90s foremost neo-soul artists. For two singers who reached the peaks of musical achievement through astounding ambition and innovation, this restrained and simple love song shows just how talented each was beneath it all. Hill and D‚ÄôAngelo trade sensual verses with a smooth, tenderness in a stripped down ballad that might just make you want to strip down as well.\n\n16. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs How Strong My Love Is‚Äô by Otis Redding\n\nOtis, you slay us. We‚Äôre hard-pressed to think of an artist who croons the good, bad and ugly of love as heartbreakingly well, and this 1965 cover (of O.V. Wright‚Äôs ‚Äô64 original) is no exception. The lyrics are so comforting, so reassuring‚Äîespecially when sung with Redding‚Äôs signature soul‚Äîthat it makes us feel adored just to hear them on the stereo.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. ‚ÄòI Say a Little Prayer‚Äô by Aretha Franklin\n\nSet in F minor, the song hits like a breakup. Burt Bacharach, you clever devil. Aretha belts it like tragedy, too. That‚Äôs what puts it in the upper league, what separates it from the puppy-dog bullshit. Love is devastating. She turns her mundane morning ritual‚Äîhair, makeup, dressing‚Äîinto opera.\n\n18. ‚ÄòRunning Up That Hill‚Äô by Kate Bush\n\nNot every love song has to be sexy! There are far friskier songs in Kate Bush‚Äôs later work, but her 1985 smash remains one of the greatest and strangest love songs of all time. Over that unmistakable electronic drum figure, synths that swoop like alien birds and Bush‚Äôs keening vocals work so harmoniously together that the song works more impressionistically than literally. But the ‚Äòdeal‚Äô she describes is love, an annihilation of the self as she dreams of literally becoming the object of her affections so that she can better understand them.\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. ‚ÄòEverywhere‚Äô by Fleetwood Mac\n\nOh, you thought chillwave was some blogger invention of 2009? Take a dip in Fleetwood Mac‚Äôs ‚ÄòTango in the Night‚Äô album, on which Buckingham, Nicks and McVie invented‚Äîno, perfected‚Äîthe sound in 1987. On standout track ‚ÄòEverywhere‚Äô, McVie stacks and stacks her blissful sighs atop darting, shimmering Buckingham arpeggios and a breezy drum gallop. Eat your heart out, Beach House.\n\n20. ‚ÄòVision of Love‚Äô by Mariah Carey\n\nAny number of Mariah Carey songs could claim a place on this list, but her stunning debut single remains irresistibly romantic. Released in 1990, it‚Äôs a gorgeous, gospel-tinged pop-soul ballad that builds towards a thrilling climax featuring Mimi‚Äôs signature whistle notes. Carey would go on to write and perform more sophisticated love songs, but ‚ÄòVision of Love‚Äô captures that butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling with a giddy sense of bliss.\n\nAdvertising\n\n21. ‚ÄòUnchained Melody‚Äô by the Righteous Brothers\n\nIt‚Äôs the mushy definition of a love song that becomes all the more powerful for it. ‚ÄòUnchained Melody‚Äô has all the corny trappings of a by-the-numbers ballad: the swooning, arpeggiated opening, the crescendo to an epic orchestral finale, lyrics whose blatant emotional manipulation ought to fall right apart under scrutiny. But there‚Äôs real, undeniable hunger in Bobby Hatfield's luminous and raw vocal, the push and pull of the instrumentation is subtler than expected, and the words reveal layers where true fidelity fights to overcome lingering doubt. The world seems to agree: The Righteous Brothers‚Äô version of the song remains the most popular and well-loved out of hundreds of recordings from around the globe.\n\n22. ‚ÄòThinkin Bout You‚Äô by Frank Ocean\n\n‚ÄòThinkin Bout You,‚Äô the iconic song about an all-consuming crush, is more than just a potent love song that flexes gorgeous vocals and soaring instrumentalism. By using elements of various queer canonical events and allusions, the cheeky R&B track opened a conversation on Black queer artistry in the music industry, particularly in the hip-hip genre, which was still struggling with homophobia and toxic masculinity. The entire song represents the curiosity and uncertainty of sexual exploration and self-discovery, showing a generation of kids that listened to Channel Orange on repeat in their bedrooms, that love is for everyone.\n\nAlessandra Schade\n\nContributing Writer, Music\n\nAdvertising\n\n23. ‚ÄòMy Baby Just Cares for Me‚Äô by Nina Simone\n\nThough Nina Simone recorded her definitive version of this standard in 1958, it became an unlikely chart hit in the U.K. nearly 30 years later, when it was used in a popular ad for perfume. The irony of this commercial connection is keen, since the song itself represents a rejection of material and cultural distractions. Simone‚Äôs account, though relatively lighthearted by her standards, nonetheless strips the ditty of much of its surface frivolity; in performance, her rendition could seem positively dour. With matter-of-fact majesty, she restores the love song, in a sense, to its own values.\n\n24. ‚ÄòI'm On Fire‚Äô by Bruce Springsteen\n\nBruce Springsteen‚Äôs vast repertoire of poetic, politicised blue collar anthems leaves surprisingly little room for romance. But there is, of course, one great romantic jam in Broooce‚Äôs ouvre. Over sultry layers of synth and a heartbeat drum machine, the narrator of ‚ÄòI‚Äôm On Fire‚Äô is consumed with an almost unbearable desire. ‚ÄòHey little girl is your daddy home, did he go and leave you all alone?‚Äô he coos and there‚Äôs an ambivalence to it: are his lyrics simply in the idiom of ‚Äò50s rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll? Or is there something forbidden about the character‚Äôs desires? The video strongly suggests the former, but there‚Äôs an undeniable element of danger to his love ‚Äì nay, obsession.\n\nAdvertising\n\n25. ‚ÄòI Want to Break Free‚Äô by Queen\n\nThough more often recognized as a song about breaking free from oppression‚Äîand for its amazing music video starring members of the band in drag‚Äîthere‚Äôs an undeniable love story also included here. The narrator has ‚Äòfallen in love for the first time‚Äô and they know ‚Äòthis time it‚Äôs for real.‚Äô How that love will blossom as that person finds their freedom to make it on their own is unclear, but hey, it‚Äôs a start.\n\n26. ‚ÄòFriday I‚Äôm In Love‚Äô by the Cure\n\nWhile we actually enjoy getting super-sentimental to Robert Smith‚Äôs voice‚Äîand typically can‚Äôt stand to listen to so-called ‚Äòhappy music‚Äô‚Äîthis love song‚Äôs catchy-as-hell hook and upbeat tempo serve as a good counterpoint to all those other straight-up tear-inducing Cure tunes. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love Friday?\n\nAdvertising\n\n27. ‚ÄòSea of Love‚Äô by Cat Power\n\nJust how many times did this song appear on mix CDs made for dorm-room crushes in the aughts? We‚Äôre too busy to do the math, but we‚Äôre guessing‚Ä¶a lot. Cat Power‚Äôs bare bones take on Phil Phillips‚Äôs classic, like many of the tracks on her 2000 LP ‚ÄòThe Covers Record‚Äô, imbues the much-loved song with a dose of longing and vulnerability.\n\n28. ‚ÄòAin‚Äôt Nobody‚Äô by Rufus & Chaka Khan\n\nQuincy Jones almost nabbed this slice of loved-up electrofunk for Michael Jackson, but it ended up becoming a signature tune for R&B diva Khan when she sang it with her old band Rufus in 1983. When Frankie Knuckles gave it a piano house remix in 1989, a new generation went crazy for the song: now artists ranging from Mary J. Blige to KT Tunstall have recorded versions, but none of them reach the thrilling heights of Chaka as she hits the final chorus.\n\nAdvertising\n\n29. ‚ÄòThis Magic Moment‚Äô by the Drifters\n\nOf course, number one has to be an old school tune. They knew romance back in the day, didn‚Äôt they? And the 50s? Oh, that era was romantic. And this absolute tune by The Drifters, with the sweet sounds of Ben. E King on lead vocals, is a seriously romantic song. Gentle swirling strings carry you through the lyrics, ‚ÄòSweeter than wine / Softer than the summer night / Everything I want I have / Whenever I hold you tight.‚Äô We‚Äôre not crying, you‚Äôre crying. Unashamedly soppy, this is a masterpiece of the lurrrve genre.\n\n30. ‚ÄòSigned, Sealed, Delivered I‚Äôm Yours‚Äô by Stevie Wonder\n\nStevie Wonder was a mere 20 years old when he released his apologetic anthem ‚ÄòSigned, Sealed, Delivered I‚Äôm Yours.‚Äô Even at that tender age, the Detroit prodigy had done a lot of foolish things that he really didn‚Äôt mean, but making that record wasn‚Äôt one of them: It spent six weeks atop the U.S. R&B chart and garnered Wonder his first Grammy nomination.\n\nAdvertising\n\n31. ‚ÄòBound 2‚Äô by Kanye West\n\nDon‚Äôt be turned off by the over-stylized video or the lyric ‚ÄòStep back, can‚Äôt get spunk on the mink‚Äô‚Äîin our opinion, Kanye‚Äôs tribute to Kim Kardashian is one of the most heartwarming love songs of the past decade. Brilliantly honest and plainspoken (‚ÄòOkay, I don‚Äôt remember where we first met‚Äô), it rejects romantic clich√©s to paint an intimate picture of Ye and Kim‚Äôs relationship. It may be over now, but hey, we‚Äôll always have the memories.\n\n32. ‚ÄòYou Got Me‚Äô by the Roots\n\nFidelity is the name of the game in this 1999 Grammy-winning track from Philly‚Äôs favorite hip-hop sons, the Roots. A globe-trotting musician and a film student meet cute, but what happens when he goes back on tour and she starts drawing the attention of famous athletes? The dreaded long-distance relationship has been known to decimate many a couple, but not this time. Our steadfast heroine‚Äîwhose rhymes are courtesy of Ruff Ryders First Lady Eve and singing is by Erykah Badu‚Äîassures her boo that his paranoia is unfounded and, no matter what, ‚ÄòYou got me.‚Äô Sounds like a keeper!\n\nAdvertising\n\n33. ‚ÄòBe My Baby‚Äô by the Ronettes\n\nLennon covered it, Scorsese used it to announce his directorial arrival in Mean Streets, and, as discussed, Brian Wilson was so in awe of its orchestral drive, he famously listened to it 100 times a day. With 1963‚Äôs ‚ÄòBe My Baby‚Äô, Phil Spector put a bowtie on the bubblegum love song‚Äîconveying love‚Äôs urgency and sweaty-palmed excitement.\n\n34. ‚ÄòThe Way You Make Me Feel‚Äô by Michael Jackson\n\nMJ‚Äôs chart-topping Bad single finds the King of Pop in full-on cupid‚Äôs-arrow love-struck mode (contrast with the seedy depictions of romance in the equally compelling ‚ÄòBillie Jean‚Äô or ‚ÄòDirty Diana‚Äô). It‚Äôs a plea, in a sense, for love unattained‚Äîbut the body-moving, carefree approach leaves little doubt to the singer‚Äôs sincerity.\n\nAdvertising\n\n35. ‚ÄòHome‚Äô by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros\n\nMagnetic Zeros frontpeople Alex Ebert and Jade Castrinos had a whirlwind romance that sparked a band, so it‚Äôs only fitting that the Magnetic Zeros‚Äô 2009 breakout hit was this sweet duet. They sing to each other like Johnny Cash and June Carter, with a whole crowd (and a horn section) behind them. What makes this tune‚Äôs aw-shucks, neohippie earnestness work so well is that you can just tell that Ebert and Castrinos mean it. ‚ÄòWe laugh until we think we‚Äôll die / Barefoot on a summer night / Never could be sweeter than with you.‚Äô This is your soundtrack for cartwheeling through a field of daisies.\n\n36. ‚ÄòSlow Show‚Äô by the National\n\nThe National is a band best known for its alternately stately and ravaged examinations of existential dread and anxiety‚Äîin short, they're far from lovey-dovey. But this track from their breakout album, 2007's ‚ÄòBoxer‚Äô proves that they're aware of love's curative powers. Frontman Matt Berninger finds himself stranded at a party without his companion and self-deprecatingly details his panic and isolation before identifying the exhilarating recognition of a soulmate with simple precision: ‚ÄòYou know I dreamed about you for 29 years before I saw you.‚Äô\n\nAdvertising\n\n37. ‚ÄòCheek to Cheek‚Äô by Ella Fitzgerald\n\nUntroubled by the darker themes that complicate so many love songs, Irving Berlin‚Äôs 1935 classic‚Äîwritten for Fred Astaire to woo Ginger Rogers with, as they dance in the movie Top Hat‚Äîis a pure expression of romantic bliss. ‚ÄòHeaven, I‚Äôm in heaven / And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak‚Äô: When Ella Fitzgerald sings these lines on her 1958 album of Berlin standards, with a confident and good-natured swing of total contentment, you can‚Äôt help joining her in the clouds.\n\n38. ‚ÄòBe My Wife‚Äô by David Bowie\n\nAlthough his ultra-melodic Motown thumper ‚ÄòModern Love‚Äô is big at weddings, you don‚Äôt really go to David Bowie for sincere feelings. But there are exceptions, foremost this astonishing song. Taken from his pioneering electronic opus ‚ÄòLow‚Äô, it‚Äôs paradoxically one of Bowie simplest songs: a furiously hammered, almost oompah piano over which he plaintively begs ‚Äòplease be mine, share my life, stay with me, be my wife‚Äô. It is absolutely not a sexy song, but the desperate sound of a man clinging on to a lover like they‚Äôre the last refuge from the storm is itself intensely romantic. Also great if you‚Äôre looking for a very literal proposal song.\n\nAdvertising\n\n39. ‚ÄòThis Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)‚Äô by Talking Heads\n\nThis 1983 hit was David Byrne‚Äôs attempt to write a love song ‚Äòthat wasn‚Äôt corny, that didn‚Äôt sound stupid or lame the way many do.‚Äô Though he‚Äôs often avoided the topic (due to it being ‚Äòkinda big,‚Äô as he eloquently puts it), Byrne hit the target here with a sweet, sincere tune about home being wherever your lover is.\n\n40. ‚ÄòHallelujah I Love Her So‚Äô by Ray Charles\n\nEver had a neighbor you can‚Äôt stop flirting with? Ray Charles knows the feeling. Of course, the next-door neighbors in his debut single, ‚ÄòHallelujah I Love Her So,‚Äô certainly go beyond being cordial and friendly. Between Don Wilkerson‚Äôs tenor sax solo and the sweet lyrics about the quiet kindnesses of romance (bringing coffee to each other, coming at a moment‚Äôs phone call) the song captures in its entirety a love that comes from a perfect understanding. When Charles sings that he knows she‚Äôll be there for him, despite people‚Äôs doubts, because ‚Äòshe told me so,‚Äô it becomes crystal clear that this is the kind of connection that‚Äôs meant to be.\n\nAdvertising\n\n41. ‚ÄòThe Very Thought of You‚Äô by Billie Holiday\n\nOriginally recorded by Al Bowlly and then Bing Crosby in 1934, Ray Noble‚Äôs jazz standard has been covered time and again this past 80 years‚Äîbut its defining version comes from Lady Day. This 1938 reverie swings like a lazy daydream, Holiday‚Äôs voice sweet and languid. ‚ÄòI see your face in every flower,‚Äô she coos, reminding you of each time you got lost in fantasy when you were washing the dishes, or watching a movie, or listening to someone explain something to you.‚Ä¶ Sorry, what was that?\n\n42. ‚ÄòTeenage Dream‚Äô by Katy Perry\n\nLove is rarely as carefree or thrilling as when you‚Äôre a teenager, which is why Perry‚Äôs 2010 pop stomper never loses its appeal. Whether you‚Äôre 25 or 85, there‚Äôs something about the pay-off line ‚Äòyou make me feel like I‚Äôm living a teenage dream‚Äô that hits hard every single time. When you find that person, don‚Äôt let them go.\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. ‚ÄòCherish‚Äô by Madonna\n\nBecause we tend to think of her as pop‚Äôs ultimate envelope-pushing chameleon ‚Äì something she definitely is ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy to forget that Madonna can also be sweet and tender. This infectious love song from her classic ‚ÄòLike a Prayer‚Äô album is a case in point: ‚ÄòCherish‚Äô is a charming and heartfelt update of the ‚Äò60s girl-group sound right down to the perfect loved-up couplet: ‚ÄòRomeo and Juliet / They never felt this way, I bet.‚Äô\n\n44. ‚ÄòI Wanna Be Your Boyfriend‚Äô by the Ramones\n\nSimply stated, plainly sung‚Äîno one can accuse Joey Ramone & Co. of overdoing it. It was drummer Tommy who wrote this ditty, which appeared on the group‚Äôs 1976 debut, and, as far as proposals go, it‚Äôd serve as a fine love letter to anyone you‚Äôd like to attach yourself to, as long as they aren‚Äôt too keen on extended verbiage. This song gets the job done in something like eight lines, a quarter of which are also the title. Short and sweet.\n\nAdvertising\n\n45. ‚ÄòI Only Have Eyes for You‚Äô by The Flamingos\n\nThe Flamingos‚Äô 1959 doo-wop classic is a perfect slow-dance standard, with super-literal lyrics about that moment when everything and everyone else fades away. The group‚Äîone in a slew of the ‚Äòbird groups‚Äô of the ‚Äô40s and ‚Äô50s, including the Orioles, the Penguins and the Larks‚Äîset a high bar for elegant ballads such as this one, and played their own instruments to boot. Swoon.\n\n46. ‚ÄòEternal Flame‚Äô by the Bangles\n\nThe Bangles started out as a Beatles-influenced garage-rock band before gradually becoming glossier and poppier as the ‚Äô80s barrelled on. Co-written and sung by group member Susanna Hoffs, this treacly power ballad topped off with a shameless key change was controversial even within the group. Still, it topped the charts worldwide in 1989 and remains pretty much impossible to resist, thanks largely to Hoffs‚Äô genuinely lovely vocal.\n\nAdvertising\n\n47. ‚ÄòDay Dreaming‚Äô by Aretha Franklin\n\nFranklin‚Äôs near-flawless 1972 album, ‚ÄòYoung, Gifted and Black‚Äô, shifts into this love song with a dreamy jazz flourish before cutting to the legendary singer‚Äôs soulful this-is-how-it-is voice. The refrain of ‚ÄòDay Dreaming‚Äô might be all about fantasizing about getting away with your man, but the verses are about trying to change and do everything to be the right woman for him. Though this might seem submissive for a powerful woman, she does say that he ‚ÄòTurns me right on when I hear him say / Hey, baby, let's get away,‚Äô so maybe that fantasy is worth it.\n\n48. ‚ÄòAt Your Most Beautiful‚Äô by R.E.M.\n\nSince it was released in 1987, many have taken R.E.M.‚Äôs breakthrough single ‚ÄòThe One I Love‚Äô to be a love song, completely wrongly: it‚Äôs actually a brutal dismissal of a former lover. A decade later, though, they penned this absolutely radiant Beach Boys homage, that brims with the uncomplicated magic of being purely in love. Over melodious piano and a lush bed of ‚Äòdoo doo‚Äô backing vocals, Michael Stipe‚Äôs breathy, wholesome declaration to his lover that ‚ÄòI found a way to make you smile‚Äô sounds like the most swoonsome thing on earth.\n\nAdvertising\n\n49. ‚ÄòLove Hangover‚Äô by Diana Ross\n\nBefore she was coming out and wanting the world to know, Diana first staked a claim on disco by virtue of this supreme 1975 Motown cut. Thanks to a mellow-into-groovin‚Äô tempo change, she lays down the love song law in style by sending away any doctors boasting a cure for her sweet hangover.\n\n50. ‚ÄòBartender‚Äô by Lana del Rey\n\nLana del Rey‚Äôs world is, for the most part, one of cynical sex and jaded desires. Which is what makes ‚ÄòBartender‚Äô so affecting: it‚Äôs a wild but also very touching fantasy of running away from her fame and baggage, buying a vehicle the paps don‚Äôt recognise, and starting a simple, pure relationship with a man who appreciates her for who she is. ‚ÄòI bought me a truck in the middle of the night, it‚Äôll buy me a year if I play my cards right‚Äô she keens. Is the bartender a real guy? Who knows! But it‚Äôs her shining, radiant love of freedom that really shines through.\n\nAdvertising\n\n51. ‚ÄòYou Make My Dreams‚Äô by Hall & Oates\n\nYou don‚Äôt even need to listen to the songs lyrics‚Äîjust that upbeat melody‚Äîto understand that this one is all about that love that makes you want to twirl as soon as you step outside under the sun and skip down a city street. While most of the duo‚Äôs soft rock and smooth-jazz-esque ethos lended itself to diddies about a more stained and complicated romance, ‚ÄòYou Make My Dreams‚Äô is pure optimism.\n\n52. ‚ÄòCountdown‚Äô by Beyonc√©\n\nThere was some debate over the merits of this 2011 track versus those of Queen B‚Äôs first chart topper, ‚ÄòCrazy in Love.‚Äô But it‚Äôs a no-brainer. ‚ÄòCrazy‚Äô is not love, it‚Äôs the first blush. It‚Äôs a crush, and the music, accordingly, is giddy and one-dimensional. But ‚ÄòCountdown‚Äô? That‚Äôs some real shit. It‚Äôs crazy in love years later, after the domesticity, after you stop bothering to close the bathroom door. And the tune, the arrangement, is complex, mercurial, fluttering and diving, able to create a rush from routine. This is the one that will make Senator Blue Ivy weep ages from now.\n\nAdvertising\n\n53. ‚ÄòLove Me Like You Do‚Äô by Ellie Goulding\n\nCo-written by pop genius Max Martin and ace Swedish singer-songwriter Tove Lo, this electro power ballad became a huge global hit in 2015. Topped off by Goulding‚Äôs distinctive fluttery vocals and a properly loved-up climax, it‚Äôs so irresistible that it‚Äôs even possible to block out, just about, that it featured on the Fifty Shades of Grey movie soundtrack. Promise we won‚Äôt bring it up if you won‚Äôt?\n\n54. ‚ÄòNever Tear Us Apart‚Äô by INXS\n\nWe all have those moments when our lives play out like the last five minutes of a CW season finale (before the shocking cliff-hanger, natch). You‚Äôre in a plaza or maybe a caf√©, and the object of your affections enters the frame. Time slows down, all other noises fade. You exchange glances. Your heart flutters. The synthesized strings kick in (it was 1988, after all). And Michael Hutchence, Australia‚Äôs answer to Jim Morrison, starts to sing: ‚ÄòI was standing.‚Ä¶ You were there.‚Ä¶ Two worlds collided.‚Ä¶ And they could never, ever, tear us apart.‚Äô And then‚Äîthat pause.\n\nAdvertising\n\n55. ‚ÄòThe Ship Song‚Äô by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\n\nSure, Nick Cave has written a large number of extremely violent songs that would probably get the police called on you if incorrectly deployed in the process of wooing. But it‚Äôs clear to anybody who has spent a lot of time with his work that the Prince of Darkness is an old romantic at heart. And ‚ÄòShip Song‚Äô is the most overwhelming expression of this, a full-throated, unabashedly melodic piano ballad in which he describes trying to rationalise his feelings for a lover before abandoning the attempt in glorious surrender: ‚Äòwe make a little history, baby, every time you come around‚Äô he roars, framing what might just be a fling like some epic poem of old.\n\n56. ‚ÄòIt Had to Be You‚Äô by Harry Connick Jr.\n\nFlirtatiously wry in its acceptance of the singer‚Äôs perfectly imperfect match (‚ÄòFor all your faults I love you still‚Äô), this 1924 Tin Pan Alley ditty has been a Hollywood staple for generations, in films ranging from Casablanca to Annie Hall. For many modern listeners, though, ‚ÄúIt Had to Be You‚Äù is indelibly linked to the 1989 rom-com When Harry Met Sally‚Ä¶, a movie that perfectly captures its sense of romantic inevitability. Harry Connick Jr. recorded the soundtrack when he was just 21, with a mix of youthful freshness and retro finesse that deservedly made him an instant star.\n\nAdvertising\n\n57. ‚ÄòThe Book of Love‚Äô by the Magnetic Fields\n\nStephin Merritt once said of his group‚Äôs 1999 lo-fi concept masterpiece: ‚Äò69 Love Songs is not remotely an album about love. It‚Äôs an album about love songs, which are very far away from anything to do with love.‚Äô We‚Äôd argue otherwise about ‚ÄúThe Book of Love,‚Äù a monkishly unadorned ode to amour in all its mystery and banality. The track‚Äôs status as a hipster-wedding staple hasn‚Äôt dulled its poetic beauty, or the simple truth it conveys about matters of the heart: ‚ÄòSome of it is just transcendental / Some of it is just really dumb.‚Äô\n\n58. ‚ÄòLove is All Around‚Äô by the Troggs\n\nTo anyone British over the age of about 40, ‚ÄòLove Is All Around‚Äô will be forever synonymous with the Wet Wet Wet cover from 1994, which was‚Ä¶ basically fine, but so ludicrously ubiquitous for a period of months that the band themselves deleted the song because even they were sick of it. It‚Äôs worth stressing that the song they were covering, by rock primitivists The Troggs, is far superior and almost unspeakably magical, an utterly charming and heartfelt lovesong with a lullaby-like simplicity and a violin accompaniment that sounds like a flight of lo-fi angels.\n\nAdvertising\n\n59. ‚ÄòTemptation‚Äô by New Order\n\nKelly Macdonald sits on Ewan McGregor‚Äôs bed, cooing, ‚ÄòOh, you‚Äôve got green eyes, oh, you‚Äôve got blue eyes, oh, you‚Äôve got gray eyes,‚Äô as he writhes and sweats through cold-turkey hallucinations. Can‚Äôt hear that refrain without thinking of that scene in Trainspotting. Bernard Sumner‚Äôs daffy lyrical abstraction often stumbled upon genius, as he does here. ‚ÄòTemptation‚Äô encapsulates being too pissed to notice or remember anything but some lovely person‚Äôs irises. It is the inarticulate poetry of clubbing adolescents. Or, it could be an ode to David Bowie. Either way, nailed it.\n\n60. ‚ÄòStay Together‚Äô by The London Suede\n\nBy some measure the most romantic of the Britpop bands ‚Äì indeed, arguably the only romantic Britpop band ‚Äì Suede‚Äôs tales of doomed love aren‚Äôt for all, but if you get it then ‚ÄòStay Together‚Äô is the absolute apotheosis of their work. Eight minutes of murky grandeur, frontman Brett Anderson paints a picture of gaspingly intense love in a ruined world ‚Äì ‚Äòwe will dance in the poisoned air‚Äô ‚Äì while soon-to-depart instrumentalist Bernard Butler conjures up an astonishing sonic world that builds from the faintest twinkling of guitar to a roaring barrage of horns. Romance at its most overwhelming."
