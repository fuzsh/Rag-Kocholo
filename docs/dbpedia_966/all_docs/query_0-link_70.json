        "text": "We watch a lot of TV and movies! And we listed a lot of music, podcast, audiobooks…so yeah, we’re fangirling over a lot of things! So we come together to highlight all the feels they give us throughout the week. On these Fangirlish Feels of the Week, there are five categories and many thoughts! Ready?\n\nHere we go!\n\nWhat You’re Fangirling Over This Week\n\nShana: Yeah, so…”hi, Bob.” If you don’t know what that means, you’re sleeping on For All Mankind. And if you do know, you probably also got hella emotional. Dani and Ed (and our dearly-departed Gordo) forever.\n\nRachel: Other cast members from Friends paid tribute to Matthew Perry this week. I knew Courteney’s would gut me but Jennifer Aniston’s brought tears to my eyes as well. This cast was just so perfect together.\n\nErin: It’s that time of year again – Countdown to Christmas. It’s all I am fangirling over. Though I haven’t like all of the movies (i’m shocked too), I have been enjoying watching them all. I am so excited to watch more this week!\n\nAshley T.: I am still fangirling extra hard over The Marvels. I’m now up to 4 viewings and I get more out of the film with each watch. I also just recorded an episode of my Marvel podcast (Podcast-616) about The Marvels where I got to have a good and proper geek out about it with my co-host, Hugh McStay, and film critic Kelechi Ehenulo. Listening back to our recording during the editing process made me geek out even harder. I’ll definitely be heading back for a fifth viewing this week.\n\nChristabel: Netflix’s The Invitation was such a surprising gem I’m glad I got to watch as a vampire film fanatic!!! Evie (Natalie Emmanuel) is great but De Ville (Thomas Doherty) is mesmerizing throughout the movie. I loved it even if it felt like watching a Wattpad movie adaptation.\n\nWTF Moment of the Week\n\nRachel: David Zaslav’s comments about “overpaying” now that the strikes in Hollywood have been resolved. Writers and actors make your business possible, dude, NO YOU DIDN’T OVERPAY.\n\nErin: Look, I know that shows get canceled all of the time and we all need to accept it. However, knowing that Shadow & Bone got canceled, my heart breaks. I loved the show so much and knowing we won’t get more of the story hurts. WTF Netflix.\n\nRaquel: What Erin said. Shadow and Bone cancelation and no Six of Crows spin off it’s heartbreaking. The cast deserved more. The fandom deserved more.\n\nAshley T.: This whole business with Warner Brothers shelving completed films for tax purposes is absurd. I’m glad they got a visit from the Feds, but seriously, can studios stop doing this nonsense? It’s asinine and truly should be an illegal practice. It’s akin to committing arson for the insurance money.\n\nWhat We’re Listening to This Week\n\nShana: They announced this week that the 2024 When We Were Young Festival would feature full-album play-throughs, so I’ve been listening to a lot of those albums and dreaming of Vegas.\n\nChristabel: Janelle Monae’s album, The Age of Pleasure has been nominated for two Grammy Awards and I couldn’t be happier because she deserves it!!! I recommend everyone give it a listen at least once.\n\nAmanda: Until Friday at midnight ET, I was still listening to the Wicked cast recording on repeat. But Friday was a great music day for me with new music from Tate McRae, Sabrina Carpenter, and Reneé Rapp, who are three of my absolute favorite artists.\n\nI’ve already got “exes” by Tate McRae stuck in my head on a loop. Sabrina’s fruitcake EP is going to be my go-to this holiday season, and I’ve simply never listened to a Reneé Rapp song I didn’t like. So the new additions in the deluxe angel of Snow Angel? Phenomenal!\n\nRachel: I listened to Dua Lipa’s new song “Houdini” this week and it’s a good pop bop.\n\nAshley W.: Dermot Kennedy released a new song, “Two Hearts” on Monday. So I absolutely have been spending the entire week listening to it—as well as his other new single “Sunday.” His music continues to be among those with the most heartfelt and authentic narratives, and I simply cannot get enough of it. I’m sure my Spotify Wrapped will reflect that when the time comes.\n\nWhat We Rewatched This Week\n\nShana: Turned on my weekend SVU marathon last weekend just in time to see “Fault.” Insert “this is fine” gif here.\n\nAmanda: To prepare for The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, I rewatched all of The Hunger Games movies. Despite THG being one of my favorite fantasy/sci-fi/dystopia movie series, I don’t think I’ve really rewatched them after their initial theatrical releases. I will say, though, it’s eerily scary and heartbreaking how some of the things going on in the movies are applicable to the world right now.\n\nRachel: Classic movie lover here, so I rewatched the classic Italian 1948 drama Bicycle Thieves. Brief but haunting.\n\nAshley W.: I definitely needed a refresher on The Hunger Games before watching The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and it was great to revisit the series and refamiliarize myself with that world. Yelling at my TV during certain scenes and at certain characters while watching the films was somewhat cathartic as well and made for an entertaining and (of course) emotional experience.\n\nAshley T.: Like I said, I’ve watched The Marvels 4 times and counting this week. On the fourth viewing it was even more fun because I took 5 of my best gals with me. There was screaming, riotous laughter, and all around fangirling in the theater. Pure joy. I can’t wait to see it again.\n\nI also rewatched Ms. Marvel and WandaVision this week after seeing The Marvels and I got much more out of them than I did upon my original viewing. It was awesome to revisit in the context of The Marvels and it made me appreciate the attention to detail that Nia DaCosta, Megan McDonnell, and Elissa Karasik gave to that script. Well done, ladies.\n\nBadass Character of the Week\n\nShana: Danielle Poole. From now until the end of this season of For All Mankind, it’s Danielle Poole, regardless of whether or not I decide at some point to be charitable and say it’s someone else. Even if there are not new FAM episodes, it is always Danielle Poole.\n\nAmanda: I can’t really explain why without spoiling anything, but I’ve got to go with Lucy Gray Baird from The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Lucy Gray walked so Katniss could run. She also deserves so much better.\n\nRachel: Whoever the filmmakers were who canceled meetings with Warner Bros. after they shelved Coyote VS Acme should take a bow. Now, the film has a chance to find a new home. Those people really showed solidarity to their colleagues. Applause to them.\n\nAshley W.: What Amanda said. Beyond what she goes through and overcomes regarding The Hunger Games, Lucy Gray Baird also really redefines the power of song. I don’t want to say too much to not spoil anything for those who haven’t read the book/seen the movie, but what she does is astonishing, and she is amazing."
