        "text": "Walker Reynolds this presentation is amazing, accurate and long over due for the Life-science sector to wake up. Thank you for this. To all in my network especially in Life-science who are still catching splitters on the fence, you know who you are, it's time to move from the IND 3.0 to IND 4.0 your out of time. The projects your are deploying now in the IND 3.0 model are already out of date before you have finished, this is no surprise because I have told you over and over again. What if the regulator demands that all smart things in the business are to be connect to a single source of truth, we will see a mass panic and rush for knowhow and skills. This is the usual pattern of the Life-science sector. However, there are those in the sector that have vision and commitment and who we are proud of to call our partner customers, they are the ones who are going to excel as they have real time data and are committed to digital transformation strategy through the UNS digital architecture and all of the technologies that this allows us to apply turning data into information and making intelligent decisions based on same. https://lnkd.in/eZc_K2_e\n\nWe are proud to be one of the Polish institutions that has a long-standing scientific cooperation with the UK, holding a strategic partnership with University's College London UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, and collaborating with Moorfields Eye Hospital, London to advance Eye Health. The interdisciplinary partnership between UCL, the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, and ICTER (International Centre for Translational Eye Research) is a testament to the growing momentum and bilateral opportunities, including startup options, identified in the \"PUSH - Polish-UK Science Horizons\" report by the British Embassy Warsaw, Polonium Foundation and Science & Innovation network (SIN): \"Polish-UK relations in terms of collaboration on science and technology evolved over the years. While at the beginning, the UK was seen more as a mentor and adviser to the Polish emerging markets, now Poland is seen as a partner in some strategic areas. (...) Poland distinguishes itself by presenting not only a highly skilled and economically robust workforce but also a dynamic startup ecosystem. It stands as a frontrunner in the field of IT and is increasingly recognised as an emerging market in cutting-edge biotech sectors, including bioinformatics and advanced therapies. These domains serve to enrich and foster collaborations between Poland and the UK.\" #ICTER_PL #IPC_PAS #STEM #StrategicPartnership #Poland #UK\n\nHappy November! Here in New York, the days shorten and cool, and there's more time for after-hours reading. I'm actively re-balancing my reading diet. That means re-training my brain away to focus on long-form reads that aren't necessarily for work or doomscrolling. It also means actively working to explore new subjects and new authors, to diversify away from the same old voices I default to in my light reading. Here's what's on my list today: 1. The Time Regulation Institute by Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar. A bureaucrat complains to his friend and ad hoc therapist about the absurd machinations of getting people to modernize their clocks. 2. Noor by Nnedi Okorafor. An Afrofuturist take on discrimination and corporate capture seen through the eyes of a cybernetic woman, AO. 3. Unmasking AI by Dr. Joy Buolamwini. Ok this is one work-related, but at least it's not a research paper or report. Thank you for the generous giveaway at yesterday's All Tech Is Human event at the Ford Foundation!! Joy's research on algorithmic bias needs no introduction, and I look forward to reading her poems. What's on your reading list?\n\nMorning Everyone! I just wanted to say thank you to those who have responded to me directly in private messages in relation to my previous post concerning what has now become Quantum Works TNT! Thanks for reaching out, everyone's individual thoughts and participation, I very much appreciate your interest and your connecting. I understand a persons deepest thoughts are also their most private of thoughts that ever can be, everyone, for you's, I wish to assure that for your private thoughts and private insights are among my private thoughts and insights! Speaking of private thoughts and insights and their pertaining to my quantum ongoing private (SR&ED) research / project development, has started to harden here with tentacles tracing off into many things such as energy in all its states from generative to production, storage and transfer not in any particular order being a main thick branching out, also a tentacle of compression of everything and I have compression here now after only a very few days at it and where you have compression you also have work, heat, energy, for certainly propulsion. Additionally something somewhat very new I don't know exactly what it is and I don't know at all what to even call it but I know it's important I've just a feel of it, it is coming together of many things multi axis. My second round of things in 2009 concerning the old larger physics took shape when it also reached multi axis thought levels. The thing that's very different now with things and all things physics no matter what realm of physics is that back in 1995 thought things were pretty cool and slick for having computer processing and storage, in 2009 thought things even cooler and slicker for having more advanced software capacities and increased coding and programming capabilities. This dawning morning here this morning with this now gone quantum and things emerging on as fast a rate as they are here, like the squeezing of pimples using (SR&ED) as a gentle squeezing vice over what is yet only days of work not even weeks, months or years which Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) is to natural phenomenons using theoretical physics the work holding piece, nature and Natural Reality the work piece. So extremely different, massively now important this morning and should also be to anyone still sleeping yet not in the west and terrible to comprehend its level of difficult importance is, I have artificial intelligence here in my fingertips now. When it comes to leveling I have years of study and serious work experience when it comes to leveling of things both small, like theodolites and big such as entire giant industrial paper mill industrial complexes. Here I see artificial intelligence the new theodolite leveling instrumentation of global playing fields when it comes to everything that happens tomorrow. Results equal level theodolites! Wake up people Rise and Shine, time to Rise and Shine! Kindest Always Tom\n\nðŸ“š Thank you to all the students and colleagues in this journey called: Skills for Information Age: Society ðŸ–¥ ðŸ–² Leveraging work in Digital Innovation in Quality, Governance, and Standards I'd like to bring the significance of utilising international collaboration ðŸ‘¯ , the importance of building trust through evidence-based practice, and establishing clear indicators for social impact and measurement of digital interventions within the domains of education, health, and justice. ðŸŒ¸ 1. International Collaboration with Scientists & Artists ðŸŽ¨ : Engaging with experts from different countries can provide diverse perspectives and solutions to complex problems. ðŸŒ¹ 2. Building Trust through Evidence-Based Practice: Trust is the foundation upon which successful collaborations and professional relationships are built. To foster trust in our work and ideas, prioritize evidence-based practice. When sharing information or insights on with supporting/credible sources and research. Be transparent about your methodologies and ensure that your content is rooted in empirical evidence. Trust is earned through consistency, credibility, and the quality of your contributions. ðŸŒ· 3. Clear Indicators for Social Impact: As scholars and future leaders in your respective fields, it's crucial to assess the social impact of our work rigorously. Identify clear indicators that can measure the effectiveness and reach of your digital interventions. ðŸŒ¼ 4. Measurement of Digital Interventions: Digital interventions have the potential to drive positive change in various domains, including education, health, and justice using AI. However, their success must be measured effectively with governance and management processes . Our network ðŸŒº is a powerful tool to connect, communicate, and make a positive impact in our fields around the world . By focusing on evidence-based practice, establishing trust through credible content, and measuring the social impact of your digital interventions, we are well-equipped to contribute significantly to quality, governance, and standards in education, health, and justice. Looking forward for a rest until next year as an university staff and cybersecuirty practicioner at RMIT ðŸŒ» .\n\nYet another meaningful session from metamorphosis . Thank you Sonal Kumar Jhajj for the unique experience. Every topic you choose takes us to a journey of learning, sharing and growing. I shared my views on Artificial Intelligence - a reality check. How Education can integrate Artificial Intelligence and Emotional Intelligence. The goal of Education is overall growth. Overall growth progresses along the 5 pillars of growth - Nurturing Self, Family, Community, Society, and Nature. Artificial Intelligence as the name suggests is artificial, it's derived from human intelligence. It has its pros and cons. It can help humanity but it's not a substitute for human intelligence. Emotions and relations can bring out the innate humanness and sense of belongingness. Mother's touch, Father's hug, laughing and playing with friends, an appreciative compliment from teacher.....this is the real world. The new generation see the world through the lens of technology. The responsibility of Parents and Educators lie in clearly defining the line between Virtual and Real world. Children should be encouraged to spend more time in the real world along with the virtual world. Click on the link to watch the interactive session from Metamorphosis. https://lnkd.in/dqxasDRr"
