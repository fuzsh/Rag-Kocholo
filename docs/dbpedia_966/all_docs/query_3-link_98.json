        "text": "as this old art form started to regain momentum among Italian actors. After studying all of these art forms in school, he was finally putting them into practice. He started realizing that this style was finally reaching the audience. This comedic genre developed characters and events that were over exaggerated to create a He then used the structure of farce that included a run of stock characters (masters, servants, fools, braggarts, cuckolds, mistresses, young wives) and an array of…\n\nHow to Live Life In E. B. White’s “Once More to the Lake”, White describes the tale of his trip to a familiar lake he went to with his son. Since White also grew up at that lake, he experiences moments of déjà vu. The theme of “Once More to the Lake” is written through the author’s tone, his literary devices, and the similarity to “What are Homosexuals For?” Throughout “Once More to the Lake” White’s tone is consistently anxious (Tone Vocab…). Although, at the beginning White seems nonchalant…\n\nMore traditionally poetry is used to share details of a poet’s thoughts, emotions and views on different things that he or she has experienced. The author of the poem “Sixteen”, Chelsea Rathburn, seems be using it to share experiences she has had facing motherhood as a single parent but Chelsea then explains that it is a persona, kind of like a fictional narrative. Chelsea is a creative writing professor at Young Harris Collage and is marred to James Davis May. Together the couple had…\n\nChallenges of growing up The two poems “Identity” by Julio Noboa Polanco and “Hard On Gas” by Janet S. Wong both use symbols to explain how growing up is like. In “Identity” the author uses weed and flowers as different types of people. In “Hard On Gas” it uses a rough car drive to show that life is hard. In “Identity” the symbol the author uses are flowers. The flowers are people who get everything and that everyone loves them. While the weed, which the author wants to be, is looked down by…\n\nMartina Navratilova once said, “Labels are for clothing. Labels are not for people” (Navratilova). Stereotypes can be encountered everywhere, and every person is guilty of doing it. Stereotypes can lead to people thinking and acting differently, this is often done without realization. Stereotyping can be found everywhere, it can be found in books, movies, and the places people go. Stereotypes can generally be defined as fixed images or a set of characteristics that a person might attach to a…\n\nModern Renditions of “Duck and Cover” Films Many modern day science fiction movies reflect much of the same “sensuous elaboration” as the films Sontag examined from the 1950’s and 1960’s. Similar to their predecessors, contemporary SF films such as Interstellar, Elysium, and Mad Max all convey a common theme regarding the downfall of the Earth, as we know it. All three of these films represent the possibility of an “earth shattering end to life as we know it,” as described in Imagination of…\n\nbegan on August 28, 1954. Dove was the second of four children in her family. Her father was a research chemist, and both her parents thought education was very important. At age ten Rita Dove began to play cello, playing music inspired her to write poetry.”(Rita Dove 2) “I think music was one of those first experiences I had of epiphany, of something beyond, deeper than rational sense”, Rita Dove explains (Rita Dove Biography). Rita Dove’s…\n\nDespite its flaws, CBS’s television show Big Brother had me hooked instantly when I first found it. I like the strategic gameplay that appears on the show. I like having someone to root for and someone to root against. The personalities that appear on the show are fun and exciting. Watching how people live for three months while simultaneously evicting people each week intrigues me. Through an online search, I found a fan run Big Brother simulation game hosted online. Played primarily on…\n\nWalter Lippmann defined stereotypes as “for the most part we do not first see, and then define, we define first and then see” (Lippmann p. 54-55). Lippmann expressed stereotypes as a characteristic element of human perception which makes it hard for humans to experience the world first hand. Lippmann stated stereotypes as someone else’s experience that becomes another person’s imagination. Our opinions come from other people’s perceptions. Lippmann writes that unfamiliarity and foreignness…\n\nPoetry is a powerful medley of rhythmical turns and vibrant imageries that stroke and shake the soul. It is no surprise that the best poets attract masses of followers who hang onto every word they say. When Socrates attempts to construct an ideal city in Plato’s Republic, he looks beyond the beauty of poetry to consider its potentially destructive impact on society. Poets like Homer have false knowledge and false authority to teach city values. Socrates wishes to exclude poets from his city…"
