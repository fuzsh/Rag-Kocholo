        "text": "Misia's song 'It's just love' delves into the complexities and raw emotions of love, capturing the essence of longing, vulnerability, and the struggle for authenticity. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a person who is deeply affected by love, to the point where even casual remarks can cause emotional wounds. This love is so profound that it can no longer be hidden behind a smile, indicating its overwhelming nature.\n\nThe chorus, 'It's just love,' repeated throughout the song, emphasizes the simplicity yet profound impact of love. The protagonist grapples with their feelings, often lying to themselves and being swept away by tears. This internal conflict is a common theme in love songs, but Misia's delivery adds a layer of sincerity and depth. The desire to see the loved one is palpable, yet there's a struggle to be honest and open, leading to a sense of isolation and time standing still.\n\nThe song also touches on the theme of memory and the past. The protagonist clings to memories, symbolized by the act of tracing phone numbers and reminiscing about past moments. This nostalgia is bittersweet, as it brings both comfort and pain. The rain imagery and the act of putting down the umbrella signify a willingness to face the emotional storm head-on, embracing the vulnerability that comes with love. Ultimately, the song is about finding one's true self through the experience of love, with all its highs and lows, and the unbreakable connection to the loved one, even in their absence."
