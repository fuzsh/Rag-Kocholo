        "text": "In my previous article about the group — Into the Fun and Thrilling Wonderland of LIL LEAGUE — I mentioned that it was 30% self-indulgent. But a collection of trivia just has to be for helping out new fans to learn more about these boys, no? Yeah, the answer really is a big no. If that one was partially self-indulgent, this time it goes straight up to 100%!\n\nMy interest in LIL LEAGUE has got me gobbling up their interviews, TV appearances and even their pre-debut activities. It feels like Easter egg hunting, exclaiming “Found you!” every time I identify one of those familiar faces. For someone with the memory of a goldfish, God knows why I foolishly believed that my sheer love for them would grant my brain the ability to retain all the information I’ve been learning. You can already imagine how it went; noting them down would clearly be my best option. Except I had absolutely zero desire to make this post due to certain reasons, if anything. Unfortunately for me, none of my go-to social media and note apps suit my requirements, what with their layouts and various limitations. At last, I’ve resorted to this blog post, albeit reluctantly, with some adjustments. Oh well, might as well share it with others while I’m at it.\n\nBefore getting into the actual trivia part, here are some things you may want to be aware of:\n\nAs I was originally writing down these trivia for myself, I didn’t bother with citing the sources. What it means is that while I do have my sources, for you it’s “trust me bro!”\n\nAgain, because I’m doing this mainly for myself, there’ll only be information I find interesting, mostly about my favorite members. Guess who they are?\n\nNo matter how interesting, funny or whatever certain trivia are, some of them will be omitted on purpose since all the members are still teenagers, along with the fact that they’ve their own lives to live. Regardless of their public availability, I refuse to present and thus highlight pieces of information that may give people the opportunity to be obnoxious or cross the line.\n\nTake the trivia regarding the members’ pre-debut activities with a grain of salt, since it’s difficult to determine the correct timeline with information collected from all over the place.\n\nTo make it easier to skim for group and/or member-specific trivia, their designated/official emoji are put before each relevant information.\n\nGroup: 🧡\n\nIwaki Sena: 🌹\n\nNakamura Tatsuhiro: 🎙️\n\nYamada Kodai: 🤖\n\nOkao Matora: 🐯\n\nMomoda Haima: 🍑\n\nNanba Sora: 🐨\n\nEnough babbling. Let’s get started!\n\nLIL Trivia\n\n🧡 After returning home from every live performance, the group gathers around in the living room to review and discuss how their performance went that day.\n\n🧡🍑 All the members decided to keep their debut date a secret from their families for a month until it was made public, which obviously proved difficult. The official announcement came out on Haima’s mother’s birthday, and when he finally got to reveal the good news to her, she cried tears of joy.\n\n🐨🍑 The families of the members got together during D.LEAGUE in 2022. Haima and Sora’s fathers exchanged contact information at the time.\n\n🍑🐯 Haima and Matora actually met for the first time in a dance competition 7 years prior to iCON Z audition. Matora was the one who won.\n\n🧡 All the members have a strong desire to become a global artist. Sena said instead of singing songs in English just to become an international hit, LIL LEAGUE would like to value their identity as a Japanese group. They want to sing their usual songs like Rollah Coaster, and be recognized for who they are.\n\n🤖 Kodai’s beloved grandmother, who always supported his dream, passed away after the second screening of iCON Z audition. He’d always wear the necklace that she bought him. However, during the final at Nippon Budokan, it got broken after his performance ended. Once he got off the stage, he cried as he hugged Sena while clutching onto his precious memento. The incident made him wonder if his grandma was watching over him.\n\n🎙️🤖 Tatsuhiro and Kodai belonged to EXPG STUDIO FUKUOKA’s TikTok team Moxie Tight Clan, or MTC for short.\n\n🐯 Matora and his older brother, Kohaku from KID PHENOMENON, belonged to EXPG STUDIO KYOTO’s TikTok team 4OXY (pronounced as FOXY).\n\n🍑 Haima has an older brother named Laimu and a younger brother named Yuito. Laimu participated in iCON Z audition but unfortunately did not pass. His brothers also attend EXPG STUDIO OSAKA, and the three of them made up the TikTok team Hormone 3 Brothers.\n\n🌹 Sena was a part of EXPG STUDIO OSAKA’s TikTok team Billi-Kane along with KID PHENOMENON’s Sorematsu Kensuke and Yamamoto Kota.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro spent his first year of elementary school climbing trees, playing in the river and dancing while living a rural life.\n\n🎙️ As an elementary school student, Tatsuhiro was lively and found himself at the center of conversations.\n\n🎙️ Aside from his dream of becoming an artist, Tatsuhiro also dreamed of becoming an elementary school teacher when he was in elementary school himself.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro used to attend avex artist academy’s Fukuoka branch since his third year in elementary school. He received scholarship there in 2016, placing 4th in their scholarship students-only interregional event the next year and becoming an ace of Fukuoka school.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro was a member of 5-6 different official training units during his time in avex artist academy: JASTARS (possibly February 2015-March 2017), Spead up (JASTARS as a dance unit), SPiKE (April 2017-May 2018), diVa; and the duos FirKin (2015-?) and Resonance (possibly June 2016-June 2018)\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro was the leader of both JASTARS (6th generation) and SPiKE.\n\n🎙️ Before hitting puberty, Tatsuhiro used to sing only the songs from female artists like MISIA and Koda Kumi. He went through a tough time once he became unable to reach the high notes like before as his voice began to change around age 11, leading to the depressive thought that there was no longer any song left for him to sing. That was when he tried singing a song from a male artist for the first time, which was ATSUSHI’s Michishirube. The song gave him mental strength and support. Thus, he came to admire ATSUSHI and hopes to become as big an artist as him someday.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro was a class representative in his junior high school. He also ran for the student council election, which he ended up winning. As the student council president, he made proposals to the town mayor for a hot spring and Costco to be built in the rural town of Chikuzen, his birthplace. Unfortunately, his requests got rejected.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro accumulated a lot of experience performing at public events and in the streets both as a part of his training units as well as solo. He’d frequently travel to other regions like Kanto and Kansai all by himself just to sing 2-3 songs ever since he was in junior high school. There’d even be limited edition goods of him sold at the venues. It granted him the opportunity to establish a fanbase long before his debut, having well-wishers who supported his journey to become an artist throughout the years.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro performed in the opening act of FAKY’s live show on 18th February 2018 as a member of SPiKE.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro also performed at a-nation on 4th May 2018 as a member of SPiKE. It was the last live performance of the unit before they disbanded.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro is a former group-mate of Nizi Project participant Ikematsu Riria and PRODUCE 101 JAPAN THE GIRLS participant Sudo Sakura, who were members of JASTARS and SPiKE, respectively.\n\n🎙️ Following the announcement of DEEP VOCALIST AUDITION, Tatsuhiro took it as a cue to graduate from avex artist academy and join EXPG STUDIO FUKUOKA in most likely April 2019. He got added to EXPG Lab around December 2022.\n\n🎙️🌹 Tatsuhiro and Sena both participated in DEEP VOCALIST AUDITION in 2019. The two apparently first met at the venue of the second screening, EXPG STUDIO OSAKA. Tatsuhiro first heard that Sena was a great dancer, which he really admired as someone who was bad at dancing. He was further amazed when he heard him sing in the audition. On the other side, Sena was also impressed by Tatsuhiro’s singing. At the very least, the name Nakamura Tatsuhiro was stuck in the back of his mind.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro used to do live streaming on the Japanese online platform SHOWROOM both on his own and also as a part of his training units JASTARS and SPiKE. He’d take song requests or sing songs of his choice, read comments and chat with the viewers. He’d go live as early as 7 or even 6:30 although he wasn’t a morning person, and stream at night at other times. To keep up with his Event streaks, he’d stream while eating in his room, and even traveling to other places. He held his last live there on 27th August 2019, after which he deleted his account along with his Twitter and Instagram profiles, abiding the rules of EXPG STUDIO.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro used to have his own personal website, which is no longer accessible.\n\n🎙️🤖 Tatsuhiro and Kodai met for the first time about 3 years prior to iCON Z audition. They went to a distant location by bus to perform at an event. Although everyone was having fun in the back, Tatsuhiro sat alone in the front. It gave Kodai the impression that he was a quiet person. They talked to each other after getting on the train. But it was awkward since they didn’t have anything to talk about.\n\n🎙️ Not only did Tatsuhiro sing together with BE:FIRST’s MANATO during their days in EXPG, but MANATO was also a member of JASTARS. Except the two belonged to different generations of the unit, and Manato likely already left by the time Tatsuhiro joined.\n\n🌹 Sena describes his relationship with his mother as a bond that’s more like that of siblings or friends rather than a parent and a child. As a single mother, she dedicated her all to raise her only child. She shares the same birthday as Sena, and considers him to have been the best birthday present for her.\n\n🤖🐯 Kodai and Matora created the choreography for Monster together.\n\n🧡 YADA was the first song that got its original line distribution from the demo version modified after the members discussed which lines would actually better suit whose vocals.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro is a very outgoing person. He always prefers going outside and hanging out unless it’s raining. Hence he used to get tanned a lot. He really enjoys visiting a certain traditional restaurant in his hometown and talking to the old lady there.\n\n🎙️🌹 During the final of iCON Z at Nippon Budokan, as they were waiting under the stage before their MY PRAYER performance, Tatsuhiro muttered to Sena’s ear that he was glad to have him as his partner. Sena replied, “Don’t say it now!” as he almost cried.\n\n🧡 Practically all the members are into the game Smash Bros. After returning to the dormitory from their practice, they each take a turn for about an hour to play it.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro’s father adjusted his schedule to come to Tokyo for his 18th birthday. He attended the Musha Shugyo that was held on that day, 27th November. The next day, the father and son went out to eat together, and had curry at Shimokitazawa.\n\n🎙️ On that same birthday, Tatsuhiro also received a surprise present from EXILE HIRO, which so happened to be a pair of sneakers he actually wanted.\n\n🧡 LIL LEAGUE’s first album, TRICKSTER, has its track list in the same order as the set list of LIL LEAGUE’s first live tour, LIL GATEWAY, so that those who attended it can reminisce about the event, and those who couldn’t attend can still get a feel of it.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro experienced getting surgery in the past. It was music that gave him strength at the time.\n\n🧡 The members got into playing Mario Kart together. They compete against each other, something they take seriously because the loser has to buy juice for everyone.\n\n🧡 Borrowing and lending clothes are a common practice among the members, so much so that they sometimes find their own clothes missing or the others wearing them. The younger group often receive clothes from Sena, but they’re so flashy that they end up unable to wear them, and have to either return them or pass them off to other members.\n\n🐯 Matora loves LIL LEAGUE so much that when he was asked to describe himself as an “otaku” of something, his response was LIL LEAGUE otaku. He also adores the fans to the point that one of the hashtags he’d use to describe himself would be #I♡LILFriends\n\n🍑 At Haima’s parents’ home, they’ve two Toy Poodles named Tsubomi and Kuromi. They’re small, fluffy and soft to the touch.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro’s family also owns a Toy Poodle named Kurumi.\n\n🌹 Sena, the leader, considers KID PHENOMENON’s leader Sorematsu Kensuke his rival, as they both attended EXPG STUDIO OSAKA and chased their dreams together for many years.\n\n🍑 A few days before Valentine’s Day 2024, Haima made strawberry candies and gave them to the members. They all liked it, which motivated him to become a better cook.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro likes to draw pictures at his own pace while relaxing in his free time.\n\n🤖 Kodai likes to visit cafes and read during his free time.\n\n🧡 The members attempted changing outfits quickly in-between performances for the first time during the rehearsal right before the first day of LIL GATEWAY live tour. No one was actually successful in doing so, and they had no idea if they’d be able to pull it off for the real deal.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro wants to improve not only his performance skills, but also his humanity; to become someone who wouldn’t feel embarrassed even if his personal life got peeked into.\n\n🎙️ Some of Tatsuhiro’s favorite manga are ONE PIECE, Blue Lock and Chainsaw Man.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro likes all sorts of sports involving balls; such as soccer, volleyball, baseball and basketball.\n\n🐯 Matora is the only one in the group who says he’s good at cleaning up.\n\n🤖 Kodai wants to achieve his dream of going on a world tour with the group.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro used to be called “hare otoko” (晴れ男) by his surroundings a lot. Literally meaning sunny boy, it refers to boys who seem to bring along sunshine, clear weather and a bright day wherever they go, which also implies being a bringer of good luck.\n\n🧡🤖🍑 Aside from the eldest duo, Sena and Tatsuhiro, the younger members are afraid of scary things. Kodai is the biggest scaredy cat of them all. According to Haima, if they’ve to watch horror movies, they do it together as a group while clinging to Sena.\n\n🧡🤖🍑🐨🐯 Bath time horror incident: in early January of 2023 (or possibly late December 2022), one day while Matora, Haima and Sora were taking a bath together, Kodai played creepy sounds in the direction of the bathroom with a loud speaker. The three got really spooked. So when Kodai went to take a bath next, they attempted to do the same to him as a payback. However, they couldn’t find the speaker’s cord. As it turned out, Kodai actually hid the cord beforehand because he figured they’d get back at him.\n\n🧡 The members played around the house with water guns at night.\n\n🌹 Sena didn’t have any experience of performing on stage prior to participating in iCON Z audition.\n\n🎙️ One thing Tatsuhiro is particular about as an artist is having something to convey in his own way, whether it’s expressing a message with a song or a theme with a dance. He believes that without substance, a performance just wouldn’t be interesting no matter how good the technique is. To that end, he thinks rather than forcing oneself to express something they don’t understand — a love song for example — it’s better to associate it with a familiar experience instead.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro is the type of person who’s shy, a crybaby, spoiled, easily gets lonely and his emotions show on his face.\n\n🎙️ According to the members, Tatsuhiro uses “Kamacho” — in other words, give-me-attention moves on a daily basis.\n\n🧡 All the members describe themselves as having a dog personality as opposed to cat personality.\n\n🎙️ Tatsuhiro’s nickname wasn’t given to him only after joining LIL LEAGUE. Rather, he has always been called Tacchan since his childhood. It could be the reason why he likes it when others use it instead of his actual name.\n\n🤖 Kodai got a strong feeling that he was singing as a “performer” since he’s usually given directions and simply follows them during recordings. It was when he actively offered ideas and tried them out while recording Lollipop that for the first time he felt like he was expressing himself with words that came from within.\n\n🐨 iCON Z Girl Group Audition participant, former CDL∞ member and current CDL academy trainee Tsunoda Sora’s father used to be Sora’s dance teacher, TSUN.\n\nLast updated: 11th June 2024"
