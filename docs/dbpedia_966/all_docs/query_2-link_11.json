Her. Alone.\n\nPumbaa: What's wrong with that?\n\n—Timon and Pumbaa on Simba and Nala's burgeoning romance[src]\n\n”\n\n\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" is a song composed by Elton John for The Lion King. It was released on May 31, 1994, as part of the film's soundtrack. It was re-released on September 30, 2003, as part of the film's Special Edition soundtrack.\n\nConception and development[]\n\n\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was the first song written by composer Elton John for The Lion King. Lyricist Tim Rice wrote fifteen different drafts of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\", as the film's story continued to undergo significant changes during production. First, Simba and Nala sang the song as adults after having fallen in love as adolescents in the Pride Lands. Later, after the story changed so that Simba fled the Pride Lands as a cub, the lyrics changed to reflect how Simba and Nala remembered each other but were discovering love for the first time. Several other versions of the song were considered, including a version sung by Simba only, a version sung by Nala only, and a version sung by a heavenly choir. After being moved around to various places in the film, the song was eventually removed altogether.\n\nFinally, Rice wrote a comical version of the song that was sung by Timon and Pumbaa. However, when the story reel was screened for John, he was \"horrified to hear his beautiful love song warbled by a warthog.\" He argued that the film fell flat emotionally because its most tender moment was being played as a joke, and as a result, Rice wrote another draft of the song in which Timon and Pumbaa opened, while Simba, Nala, and the choir sang in the middle. Though this version of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" ended up being the finalized version, John remained partial to the original lyrics.[1]\n\nReleases and alternative versions[]\n\n\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was released on May 31, 1994, as part of the soundtrack of The Lion King. Also included on the soundtrack was a pop cover of the song performed by Elton John.[2][3]\n\nThe stage musical version of the song was released in 1997 as part of the original cast recording.[4][5]\n\nAlso in 1997, Disney released an album titled Jungle Boogie, which consisted of songs from both The Lion King and The Jungle Book franchises. The original version of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was included on this album.[6]\n\n\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was re-released on September 30, 2003, as part of the film's Special Edition soundtrack. Also included on the soundtrack was the Elton John version of the song as well as a remix of John's cover.[7][8]\n\nAlso on September 30, 2003, the karaoke version of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was released as part of Disney's Karaoke Series: The Lion King.[9][10]\n\nBest of The Lion King, an album comprised of songs from different installments in The Lion King franchise, was released on September 6, 2011. The original version of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was included on this album.[11][12]\n\nOn October 3, 2011, \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was released as part of The Lion King Collection (Deluxe Edition). Also included on the album was the Elton John version of the song.[13][14]\n\nThe song was re-released as part of The Legacy Collection: The Lion King on June 24, 2014, as was the Elton John version of the song.[15][16]\n\n\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" was reimagined for the 2019 remake of The Lion King. It was released on July 11, 2019, as part of the film's soundtrack.[17][18]\n\nUse[]\n\nIn the canon[]\n\n\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" is the last song heard in The Lion King. It begins shortly after Simba and Nala reunite as adults and find that their friendship has blossomed into love. As the two stride off into the jungle, Timon laments to Pumbaa that Simba will no longer be a part of their friend trio. Meanwhile, Simba and Nala spend a romantic evening together in the jungle, which culminates in Nala licking Simba's cheek and the two embracing. Timon and Pumbaa then sob over the loss of their \"carefree days\" with Simba.[19]\n\nThe Lion King 1½ shows the \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" sequence from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective, revealing that the duo tried to sabotage Simba and Nala's romantic night together. Though Timon and Pumbaa try multiple times to ruin Simba and Nala's evening, their plans continually backfire until at last they give up and sob over their friend's fate.[20]\n\nIn other media[]\n\nA reimagined version of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" is heard in the 2019 remake of The Lion King. It plays during the same sequence of events as its 1994 counterpart.[21]\n\nThe stage musical version of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" is much the same as the original, occurring during the same sequence of events. However, its closing lyrics are sung by Simba and Nala rather than Timon and Pumbaa.[4]\n\nAn instrumental version of Elton John's \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" is heard in the 1994 video game The Lion King. There are two slightly different versions of the song: one for Genesis and one for SNES.[22]\n\nLyrics[]\n\nTimon:\n\nI can see what's happening\n\nPumbaa: (spoken)\n\nWhat?\n\nTimon:\n\nAnd they don't have a clue\n\nPumbaa: (spoken)\n\nWho?\n\nTimon:\n\nThey'll fall in love, and here's the bottom line\n\nOur trio's down to two\n\nPumbaa: (spoken)\n\nOh.\n\nTimon:\n\nZe sweet caress of twilight\n\nThere's magic everywhere\n\nAnd with all this romantic atmosphere\n\nDisaster's in the air\n\nChorus:\n\nCan you feel the love tonight?\n\n(Lalela thuli) (Listen to this quiet person.)\n\nThe peace the evening brings\n\n(Lalela thuli) (Listen to this quiet person.)\n\nThe world, for once, in perfect harmony\n\n(Lalela thuli) (Listen to this quiet person.)\n\nWith all its living things\n\n(Lalela lelando/lelandu we) (Hey, listen to this history!)\n\nSimba:\n\nSo many things to tell her\n\nBut how to make her see\n\nThe truth about my past?

'Can you feel the love tonight?' I know all about that mushy stuff!\"[24]\n\n\"Of the Same Pride\", a song from The Lion Guard, makes several nods to \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\". For example, Kion pulls Rani into the water just as Simba pulled Nala into the water in The Lion King.[25]\n\nAdventures in Typing with Timon & Pumbaa references \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" when the player must type the sentence \"Our trio's down to two,\" for practice.[26]\n\nIn the original soundtrack version of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\", Timon and Pumbaa's sobbing at the end is prolonged.[2]\n\nMedia[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nThe Lion King (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Circle of Life • I Just Can't Wait to Be King • Be Prepared • Hakuna Matata • Can You Feel the Love Tonight • This Land • ...To Die For • Under the Stars • King of Pride Rock • Circle of Life • I Just Can't Wait to Be King • Can You Feel the Love Tonight\n\nThe Lion King: Special Edition Circle of Life • I Just Can't Wait to Be King • Be Prepared • Hakuna Matata • Can You Feel the Love Tonight • The Morning Report • This Land • ...To Die For • Under the Stars • King of Pride Rock • Circle of Life • I Just Can't Wait to Be King • Can You Feel the Love Tonight (End Title) • Can You Feel the Love Tonight (Remix) • The Hyenas\n\nBest of The Lion King Circle of Life • I Just Can't Wait to Be King • Can You Feel the Love Tonight • Warthog Rhapsody • Lea Halalela • Hakuna Matata • Digga Tunnah Dance • Upendi • One of Us • The Lion Sleeps Tonight • Be Prepared • They Live In You\n\nThe Lion King Collection (Deluxe Edition) He Lives in You • Circle of Life • Lea Halalela • Upendi • Busa • One of Us • Love Will Find a Way • Can You Feel the Love Tonight • We Are One • One By One • It's Time • Noyana • In Youpendi • Be Prepared • He Lives In You • My Lullaby • Hakuna Matata • I Just Can't Wait to Be King • The Lion Sleeps Tonight • Circle of Life • Grazing in the Grass • Can You Feel the Love Tonight • Warthog Rhapsody • Kube • This Land • Digga Tunnah Dance • The Morning Report • Love Will Find a Way (End Title) • The Lion Sleeps Tonight • Be Prepared • They Live In You"
