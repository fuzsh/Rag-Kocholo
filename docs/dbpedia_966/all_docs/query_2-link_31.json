        "text": "Let’s be honest: Love songs always hit right in the feels. A ballad can transform from a regular song into the soundtrack of your relationship—whether you’re celebrating your 25th anniversary or just uttering “I love you” for the first time on Valentine's Day.\n\nBut what makes a great love song? The top-secret recipe starts with the lyrics. You can go from a jazzy number that spells out letters (like “L-O-V-E” by Nat King Cole) to a rock hit that breaks down the true meaning of love (like “I Want to Know What Love Is” by Foreigner) or even a nostalgic track that makes you reflect on past relationships (like “Teenage Dream” by Katy Perry). Simply put: Love songs have stood the test of time through so many decades.\n\nSeriously, the ’60s and ’70s were all about soul and funk, while the ’80s ushered in pop and rock. And then the ’90s and early ’00s gave us some of the greatest R&B hits of all time. (Hello, Boys II Men, Whitney Houston and Alicia Keys, to name a few)."
