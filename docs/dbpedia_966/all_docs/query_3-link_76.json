        "text": "It’s Friday, you know what that means! It’s been a while but it’s time for another Question of the Week.\n\nYou know, one of the most wonderful things about music is that it’s so varied and diverse. You can find almost anything out there. And while mainstream music is alright and all that, I find that more often there are exciting things to find in the corners of the obscure. So here’s my question to you this week – what are some more obscure and less known musical styles that we should know about? Tell us what it is and send us your jams!\n\nI would like to start with one that is near and dear to my heart – Balkan folk punk. This style is fairly well known and is quite popular in its native Eastern Europe, but not much outside of it. The biggest band has to be Dubioza Kolektiv with others like Kultur Shock and Russkaja being some that have achieved more significant international success. The genre is generally fast punk/metal music with typical Balkan instruments like violins, accordions, trumpets, trombones and bagpipes thrown in. It definitely also takes influence from the likes of ska, reggae and celtic punk acts like the Dropkick Murphys. Lyrics are either satirically political, channeling the frustrations of the post-Iron curtain nations or comedic about drinking, lovemaking and partying. Also, Balkan folk punk bands have the best concerts, fact.\n\nspotify:track:34aLH6QmtMnxT5xTdeWD7R:small\n\nspotify:track:3BetQeCxrw3yQHyYG6TrKi:small\n\nspotify:track:5ZjvFmOkyURoX10OF74YiF:small\n\nNext up, I would like to talk about the recent emergence known as dungeon synth. Now, despite the name, this isn’t some dark or evil sounding genre. It’s an almost entirely instrumental electronic style that aims to create a medieval fantasy sound. The names of the tracks, album covers and general artistry are all heavily inspired by 80s pulp fantasy literature and 90s fantasy adventure RPG video games. The albums definitely sound like the soundtracks to games that sadly don’t exist. Artists use stereotypically medieval instruments – fiddles, flutes, lutes, mandolins, pan pipes, etc. - albeit they are all synthesized rather than played for real and complimented with programmed drums and 80s style keyboards for that computer game sound. They also often feature ambient sounds such as rustling leaves, flowing rivers, birds, frogs, galloping horses, clashing swords and more to elevate the atmosphere. This style is one of my favourite recent discoveries and I highly recommend it. Jam these jams during your next Dungeons & Dragons session for a truly magical experience.\n\nspotify:track:12J7V6ljPmANGT3Vc2pUbY:small\n\nspotify:track:38iL0nLaukIp5WUhfIG5wT:small\n\nspotify:track:1knBZR07M7QpOuiYeSHLGh:small\n\nAnd finally, a very close and dear friend of mine recently introduced me to maidcore. This is a weird stylistic movement, one of those obscure things that originate among internet culture. All the artists follow a typical maid aesthetic with the dresses, aprons, feather dusters and all that, as influenced by anime and Japanese maid cafes. You’ll notice a lot of them use “[blank] the Maid” as their name. The movement is very clearly an offspring of the anime fandom and is heavily influenced by that subculture. The genre is quite diverse and difficult to pinpoint it’s sound as it varies greatly from artist to artist. In general it’s some amalgamation of alternative rock, electronica, downtempo, trip-hop, synthpop, chiptune, nu metal, etc. and it also sounds very similar to a lot of early 2000s anime openings. It’s often compared to glitchbreak (which is another subgenre rabbit hole to go down, feel free to explore some on your own ). The connecting theme is of course the anime maid aesthetic and that all the music has a very distinct “vibe” to it, I don’t know what else to call it. The songs are mostly instrumental, tend to be slow and are very melancholic and quietly emotional. You’d expect a genre called maidcore to be some bubbly Japanese pop that would befit a maid cafe but no, it’s more like the music the maids vibe to while trying to deal with the stress of everyday life. Imagine if the lo-fi girl listened to a lot of My Chemical Romance and Deftones when growing up. Whatever it is though, the style is very engaging to listen to and offers a great mood and atmosphere.\n\nspotify:track:0zyHrHxbJvaIBybhbhnyP9:small\n\nspotify:track:7GBgID6qTofgUGo569m7pS:small\n\nspotify:track:1EtHPSucaEZeI9KEqYv7JC:small\n\nJoanModerator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a Like.\n\nAre you new to the Community? Take a moment to introduce yourself!\n\nGreat question, @Joan!\n\nOne genre of music that I listen to sometimes, and which I’d consider to be somewhat obscure, is the Palm Desert Scene.\n\nThe Palm Desert Scene is perhaps best known for pioneering the genre of music known as “stoner rock,” and it began to take form with \"generator parties\" during the late 1980s and early 1990s in Palm Desert, southern California (which is why the term \"desert rock\" is sometimes used to refer to stoner rock music).\n\nBands from the Palm Desert Scene were rooted in such disparate styles as punk, psychedelic rock, hard rock, and heavy metal. From reading a “Rock History” article on the Monster Riff website, I also gather that one motivation for these bands to play out in the desert was to avoid cops breaking up house parties where the bands could alternatively play.\n\nSoon, Palm Desert Scene artists such as Yawning Man and Kyuss were bringing their instruments and equipment—along with gasoline-powered generators for electricity—into the desert, where they drew crowds of fans and could play without needing to worry as much about their music being shut down.\n\nAlthough most of the original Palm Desert Scene bands aren’t currently active, this term is still used to refer to projects with original members from the scene, such as Brant Bjork and Josh Homme.\n\nHere are some examples of songs that I think sound great, representing the Palm Desert Scene:\n\nspotify:track:0EAwKFwPX0JMI5QxuKxteG:small\n\nspotify:track:3HzOTfm6FVu4qXRDDdT3t0:small\n\nspotify:track:32TyHtUK3ug4wnQolN12Er:small\n\nCheers!\n\nAdamDamSpotify Star\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nNote: I'm not a Spotify employee.\n\nNot sure if it’s a genre or a combination of multiple genres with a similar theme, but lately I’ve been listening a lot to Alt Z:\n\nspotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1EIh64NM6OwM8k\n\nIt has elements of alternative-, indie-, and punk rock. Usually the lyrics are kinda dark or even sad while the music is very powerful and can feel aggressive sometimes. Don’t know if the genre originated in the gaming scene, but it’s well represented there and I’ve discovered some of my favorite tracks through video games.\n\nspotify:track:2QPW157Ms76KiW8rByD73h\n\nspotify:track:1HhKB5bR5r0zCpcYQ8N6Dt\n\nspotify:track:2yBtRSO2j14bDmJFH146AE\n\nAnother obscure genre (in fact it’s so obscure it most likely doesn’t exist at all ) that I sometimes listen to is what I’d like to call Theme Park Waiting in Line Music (but in general it's probably Trance or some other genre that goes well with the theme of the ride...)\n\nWhile mostly it’s just about the worst experience you have to suffer through when standing in line for up to an hour or more to get on a ride, there are some exceptions:\n\nspotify:track:4hYAHUwkIW2QLgF9RiKDKL\n\nI love this track so much, I can just listen to it with my eyes closed imagining I’m sitting in the coaster car. The ride itself isn't particularly thrilling and there are newer, more exciting ones but the music arrangement for the Euro Mir is just perfect, especially the part starting at 1:22 which is playing while you slowly spiral upwards inside the dark towers towards the drop off at the top\n\nXeniaModerator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nAre you new to the Community?
