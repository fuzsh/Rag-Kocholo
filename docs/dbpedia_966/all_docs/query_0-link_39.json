I don't really remember the album's title, but the one I got is the one with the song \"Flowers\". Nicely recorded and she got such a soothing voice.\n\nMay 17, 2006 at 12:53 PM Post #3 of 23\n\npezzy\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nAug 21, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n139\n\nLikes\n\n11\n\na little bit different but you can try and find an album of this orchestra (i forgot the name of them but i think they were from ukraine?) doing jpop covers with the majority of it being hamasaki ayumi's songs.\n\nGood luck trying to find it though, ive been looking for months .\n\nI used to like ayumi's voice but it annoys the hell out of me now.\n\nMay 17, 2006 at 1:23 PM Post #4 of 23\n\ndj_mocok\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nDec 26, 2003\n\nPosts\n\n5,635\n\nLikes\n\n15\n\nWell, the fact is, for professional's standard, I don't think Ayumi Hamasaki can really sing. Her vocal range is very limited and sometimes she makes this distorted shriek, I don't know why.\n\nI'm not trashing her, but I think just like Madonna or Spears, she's more of a performer than a singer and relies more on image.\n\nI like her earlier stuffs though (Boys and Girls, Maria, etc), but her current ones are craps IMO.\n\nMay 17, 2006 at 1:56 PM Post #5 of 23\n\nspyder187\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nNov 29, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n189\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by dj_mocok\n\nI like her earlier stuffs though (Boys and Girls, Maria, etc), but her current ones are craps IMO.\n\nI agree about her earlier stuff. They have this rhythm and tune mixed with her voice for really good J-pop. (Fly High, M, July 1st..)\n\nI have had a sample of her later stuff and didn't get too much into it.\n\nMay 17, 2006 at 2:31 PM Post #6 of 23\n\nAlu\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 8, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n1,723\n\nLikes\n\n223\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by dj_mocok\n\nWell, the fact is, for professional's standard, I don't think Ayumi Hamasaki can really sing.

I think you should try some Maaya Sakamoto and hear some really decent JPOP.\n\nMay 18, 2006 at 5:26 AM Post #7 of 23\n\ndj_mocok\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nDec 26, 2003\n\nPosts\n\n5,635\n\nLikes\n\n15\n\nUnfortunatelly current JPOP are mostly crap IMO. It's either some headache-inducing rap wannabes or too-much-westernised type of pop. Gone are the days of authentic Japanese pop (they had this Japanese style that you can easily pick up).\n\nAlthough there are some exceptions, some Japanese R&B influenced singers do belt a few quality R&B tunes. I can't remember the names...\n\nAnd it's hard to find consistent singers; lots of them make a decent album (or song!) or two, and then after that, all the newer albums are crap crap crap.\n\n\"Newer\" artists that I used to like some of the earlier songs but not sure about the recent ones are:\n\n- Minmi : \"The Perfect Vision\" and \"T.T.T.\" (Minmi is too \"fat\" for Japanese singers, I don't think she has the look, but she really got a powerful voice)\n\n- Double: \"Who's That Girl\", \"Shake\" (Shake is a very old song, this was before one of the sisters died).\n\nNow most of the Japan top 20 songs are unlistenable to me. It's like you don't need talent or good songs; all you need is a cutie cutie face, body like a stick figure, slap a few funky apparels here and there and voila!, you got yourself a recording artist.\n\nAnyway, I have some Maaya Sakamoto songs, but can't really remember which one.\n\nMay 18, 2006 at 6:19 AM Post #8 of 23\n\nMezevenf\n\nHead-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nApr 25, 2006\n\nPosts\n\n59\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by dj_mocok\n\nIt's like you don't need talent or good songs; all you need is a cutie cutie face, body like a stick figure, slap a few funky apparels here and there and voila!, you got yourself a recording artist.\n\nIsnt this true for most of the world though?\n\nFor the life of me (and I'm a big rap fan) I cannot see what anyone finds good about 50-cent. Why, oh why is he so popular?\n\nAnyhoo, I used to listen to Ayumi ages ago, but not anymore. Sort of died of the Jpop scene, and stick with my Initial D soundtracks\n\nMay 18, 2006 at 6:54 AM Post #9 of 23\n\ndj_mocok\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nDec 26, 2003\n\nPosts\n\n5,635\n\nLikes\n\n15\n\nUnfortunately, yes.\n\nBut to me, the phenomenon in Japanese music is even greater IMO.\n\nMay 18, 2006 at 7:07 AM Post #10 of 23\n\nElephas\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 19, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n3,259\n\nLikes\n\n15\n\nI like the songs in the \"A Best\" compilation album.\n\nI think (Miss) Understood is OK, but not as good as \"My Story\" or \"Rainbow.\"\n\nThe remixes are not bad.\n\nNo matter what, don't get \"Ayu's Music Box.\" I made the mistake of thinking some instrumental versions of the songs might be good, but it's made to sound like a music box.\n\nMay 18, 2006 at 7:44 AM Post #11 of 23\n\nDachink\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nJun 23, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n230\n\nLikes\n\n10\n\nI Am is her best album IMO I have her whole discography and thats the only album I really like\n\nTry these new and old jpop artists (listing just non-group/band artists):\n\nFayray ( try her new album Hikari to kage )\n\nMika Nakashima\n\nMISIA\n\nOLIVIA (Olivia Lufkin of D&D)\n\nAyaka Hirahara\n\nCocco\n\nAkino Arai\n\nUA\n\nShiina Ringo\n\nyea..I mainly listen to women artists :/\n\nMay 18, 2006 at 8:01 AM Post #12 of 23\n\nmika\n\nNew Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nJul 6, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n40\n\nLikes\n\n10\n\nI like her album - Best.\n\nI think the season is the best song from her.\n\nBut Misia is still the best for me.\n\nMay 18, 2006 at 8:01 AM Post #13 of 23\n\npezzy\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nAug 21, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n139\n\nLikes\n\n11\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by dj_mocok\n\nUnfortunatelly current JPOP are mostly crap IMO.
