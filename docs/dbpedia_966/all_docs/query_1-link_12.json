Excerpt: \"Aitakute Ima,\" lit. \"Missing You Now\") is the twenty-third single by Japanese recording artist Misia. It was released on November 18, 2009 as the fourth single from Misia's ninth studio album Just Ballade. \"Aitakute Ima\" was written by Misia, while the composition and production were handled by Jun Sasaki. It served as theme song for the first season of the TBS drama Jin, starring Takao Osawa, Haruka Ayase and Miki Nakatani. \"Aitakute Ima\" is Misia's first song in five years to be used in a TV drama. The first pressing of the single came housed in a sleeve case with a see-through cutout. The single includes two B-sides: \"Kuchibiru to Kuchibiru,\" also featured on Just Ballade, which Misia describes as the mature version of the song \"Kiss Shite Dakishimete,\" from her first album Mother Father Brother Sister, and \"Love Truly,\" which was written by essayist Mayumi Sat and first performed during The Tour of Misia Discotheque Asia. \"Aitakute Ima\" was made at the request of producer Akihiko Ishimaru, who was keen on having Misia sing the theme song for the drama. In a press release, he commented: When I imagined the music that would match the epic story and visuals of the drama, Misia's overwhelmingly powerful and bittersweet voice was all that came to mind. I wanted it to be touching and nostalgic and for it to bring to life the earnestness of the people from the Edo period and the feeling of a love that transcends time, so I asked Misia to write an epic ballad like only she can. Once I heard the song, I became even more confident in the drama and am certain it will liven up the production I want the viewers to focus on the lyrics, as they may be hinting at the climax of the drama. In an interview with Excite Music, Misia explained that one of Ishimaru's directives was to not read the original manga series, in order to avoid giving away potential spoilers in the song. The lyrics of the song were therefore influenced by the story's theme of longing and nostalgia. CDJour undefined Books",
