        "text": "State Song\n\n\"Old Folks at Home\"\n\nStephen C. Foster wrote \"The Swanee River (Old Folks at Home)\" in 1851. After Foster wrote the song, he sold it to E. P. Christy, a businessman who operated a series of minstrel shows.\n\nFoster is reported to have chosen the term \"Swanee\" because its two-syllable cadence fit nicely into the music he had composed. The composer was not familiar with the Florida section of the Suwannee River, because he never visited the state. A memorial center at White Springs, Florida, honors Foster, who authored about 200 popular songs during his prolific career.\n\nRepresentative S. P. Robineau of Miami introduced House Concurrent Resolution No. 22 in 1935, designating \"Swanee River\" as the official state song. It replaced \"Florida, My Florida,\" which had been adopted as the state song in 1913. In 2008, the Legislature designated that a revised version of the lyrics be the official version.\n\nThe Suwannee River flows in a southerly direction from the Okeefenokee Swamp in Georgia to the Gulf of Mexico in Florida. The river separates the Florida panhandle from the rest of the state.\n\n\"Old Folks at Home\"\n\nWay down upon the Suwannee River,\n\nFar, far away,\n\nThere’s where my heart is turning ever,\n\nThere’s where the old folks stay.\n\nAll up and down the whole creation,\n\nSadly I roam,\n\nStill longing for my childhood station,\n\nAnd for the old folks at home.\n\nChorus\n\nAll the world is sad and dreary\n\nEverywhere I roam.\n\nO dear ones, how my heart grows weary,\n\nFar from the old folks at home.\n\n2nd verse\n\nAll ‘round the little farm I wander’d,\n\nWhen I was young;\n\nThen many happy days I squander’d,\n\nMany the songs I sung.\n\nWhen I was playing with my brother,\n\nHappy was I.\n\nOh, take me to my kind old mother,\n\nThere let me live and die.\n\n3rd verse\n\nOne little hut among the bushes,\n\nOne that I love.\n\nStill sadly to my memory rushes,\n\nNo matter where I rove.\n\nWhen will I see the bees a humming,\n\nAll ‘round the comb?\n\nWhen shall I hear the banjo strumming,\n\nDown in my good old home.\n\nRevised lyrics, adopted by the Center for American Music, Stephen Foster Memorial, at the University of Pittsburgh."
