Let's be fashionable and cool!\n\nSong Production Information\n\nbeatmania IIDX\n\nMegumi Oka ('Megumi upper-slope' Kumichou)\n\nThis song started from the phrases \"I want to sing these~ kinds~ of songs~\", \"I want to dance~\", and \"Mirrorball~!!←perfect for the DISCO generation (sweats;)\", and the KONAMI Studio sound creator Tsucchini often selfishly said he created a \"loveable fighting spirit song\". Thank you for the lovely song! Also, a long-time close friend RYO performed the chorus (who's also active as a tour member for artists such as Eikichi Yazawa and Toko Furuchi), and the dancer 'MICO' groovily danced in this IIDX movie (who's also active as a choreographer for DANCE☆MAN and MINMI, and as a backup dancer for artists such as Misia), and fur, fur, furthermore! 'Togo-chef', who has helped me since \"Hunting For you\" from the original beatmania series, appeared as a friend in this movie (but only briefly (laughs)).\n\nWhat should I do with this lineup! I'm really happy... thanks to the KONAMI staff and my close friends, I'm still inexperienced, but I was able to achieve what I wanted (congratulations).\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to thank you!\n\nThere's no exaggeration that I was born and raised in Tokyo, but is Mother Nature in me?\n\n\"LOVE BOX\" was born from the image of \"THE TOKYO\". I also took part in the costumes, womens' hair and makeup, and staging. Sorry for the silly lyrics. Please forgive that atmosphere. Also, I'm grateful to TERA and TAKA for creating this Tokyo-like video.\n\nI look forward to your continued support of UPPER-SLOPE. See☆You\n\n\"UPPER-SLOPE\" is...\n\nAn expression describing an ocean area inhabited by fish such as tropical fish. It means an upper-slope, such as shoals. I named it from the concept that colorful fish freely gather and swim in shoals which are filled with sunlight. If you're a musician, you can freely enter and exit♪\n\nTsucchini\n\nHello & nice to meet you.\n\nFrom this unexpected situation that my own song is included in this IIDX series, I'd like to first warmly and passionately thank all the artists, staff, and players who have impatiently supported IIDX!\n\nThis is a 90's J-PopSoul song which feels nostalgic now. I had an image of that moment when acoustic 16beat was slightly shining with brilliance in Japan.\n\nThe word \"trance\" is now established as a genre, but the simple groove created by each drum, bass, and guitar cutting back then, sent audiences in a somewhat different trance than recent techno/dance and band music.\n\npop'n music\n\nMegumi Oka ('Megumi upper-slope' Kumichou)\n\nHow's everyone doing?\n\nThis time, Tsucchini created this song while saying many nonsense phrases such as \"well, the guitar is kuwachaka-styled... (he continued for a while, so I'll omit it)\"♪ Thankfully, I really love it, yes (I'm happy), I can't get enough of how he somberly plays the keyboard~ (I'm satisfied), although it's a hidden song... ha~... I, I can't play--- it. I'm not really a gamer... I was looking forward to the character.... I still haven't seen her (I'm sad).\n\n\"Megumi upper-slope\" started with two of my close friends as guests, with RYO performing the chorus (who performs the backing chorus for artists such as Eikichi Yazawa and Toko Furuchi), and the dancer MICO performing a cool dance in the IIDX home version movie (who's a Misia tour member, and a choreographer for artists such as MINMI and DANCE☆MAN), and I hope to show a completely side of Megumi Oka in pop'n than before. See☆You\n\n\"UPPER-SLOPE\" is...\n\nAn expression describing an ocean area inhabited by fish such as tropical fish. It means an upper-slope, such as shoals. I named it from the concept that colorful fish freely gather and swim in shoals which are filled with sunlight. If you're a musician, you can freely enter and exit♪\n\nThis time, we swam together with fish♪ Tsucchini as a splendid alfonsino + RYO as a harlequin sandsmelt + MICO as a yaksha wrasse, & MEGU as a bitterling ghostfish + box jellyfish.\n\nTsucchini\n\nHey, I can play the guitar. But when I walk around while playing my guitar, people suddenly tell me to stop. I haven't appeared here recently.\n\nFolk somehow sounds nice, but not the electric guitar's Yohhh!! Perhaps the Yohhhhhhhhh sounds irritating to those inside the bus!!!! Old women think that everyone who plays the electric guitar in school uniform are rockers, but unfortunately, the \"teketententten\" playing in enka songs is from that electric guitar.\n\nThat's too bad!!\n\nSo, I stole this joke in the end, and these comments are horrible. Well, I've written about various details on other pages. It's sometimes nice and fun to get wild!!\n\nBut I'm not really great at playing the guitar recently. I don't have talent, but I hope to become better by practicing.\n\nVideo Production Information\n\n\"ZION\" TERADA (artico inc.)\n\nThe \"LOVE BOX\" project started from MEGU's wish to create a loud groovy disco CLIP. When I listened to this song many times, images of \"spaciousness\" and a \"sense of speed\" somehow gently came to mind, so I created it with cool JAH convertibles and fashionable club footage.\n\nThe dancer MICO introduced me to the Roppongi club \"R\", and I borrowed my friend's favorite convertible. During the filming day, MEGU's charm was in full-force! My camera was also in great condition, so I think it went well.\n\nAfter all, it's enjoyable to work with a beautiful woman.\n\nONE LOVE.\n\nCharacter Information\n\nBirthplace: N.Y., U.S.A.\n\nHobbies: Collecting vintage cameras\n\nLikes: Espresso coffee\n\nDislikes: ... War. Isn't it obvious?\n\nNina from the arcade version of pop'n music came to visit us.\n\nThank you, Nina!\n\nDifficulty & Notecounts\n\nbeatmania IIDX difficulty rated from 1 to 7+ in beatmania IIDX 8th style CS.\n\npop'n music difficulty rated from 1 to 43 through pop'n music 20 fantasia.
