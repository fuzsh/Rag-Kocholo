        "text": "Removed\n\n[x] BoA - POWER (Masters of Funk Remix)\n\nTo be removed tomorrow\n\n[x] Day After Tomorrow - faraway\n\n[JPop] MISIA - Over Bit\n\nThis is track 2 off of MISIA's new album Kiss in the sky. The CD itself requires a good listen-over twice or so to really enjoy it. However, this track is the one that really made me like it the first time through. It's a midtempo, relaxed R&B song that's got almost a happy almost jazzy/swing-ish feel to it laced with R&B beats -- in fact, certain parts remind me of Orange Pekoe's single, \"Honeysuckle.\" This song has a mellow feel to it without being draggy or slow. I'd rather have MISIA sing these midtempo or uptempo songs -- her ballads are great, but her upbeat songs are my favorites. Very nice stuff from MISIA.\n\nQuick artist bio: MISIA is probably The Power Singer of Japan. She can really belt her vocals; the other famous one being Koyanagi Yuki. MISIA trained with an African-American vocal coach, which is how she learned several vocal techniques. She never does live performances, but really hit it off with the public with her debut single \"Tsutsumikomu Youni...\" She has released some very memorable songs such as \"Everything,\" \"Hatenaku Tsuzuku Story,\" and her great duet with Dreams Come True in \"Toki wo Koete ~ I Miss You.\" Very talented singer.\n\nOh, and some recently downloaded mp3s...\n\nRecently downloaded MP3s\n\n[x] Do As Infinity - Shinjitsu no Uta (PV Version)\n\n[x] Kuwata Keisuke - Yozora no Mukou\n\n[x] Morning Musume - Hajimete no Rock Concert\n\n[x] Morning Musume - Koko ni Iruzee! (Radio Version)\n\n[x] Morning Musume - Mr. Moonlight ~Ai no Big Band~ (Long Version)\n\n[x] Morning Musume - Mr. Moonlight ~Ai no Big Band~ (Hawaiian Version)\n\n[x] Nakazawa Yuko - Kurakushon\n\n[x] Skoop On Somebody - Two of A Kind (SOS meets CHEMISTRY)\n\n[x] SMAP [Kimura Takuya] - Ha\n\n[x] SMAP [Kimura Takuya] - Zutto Zutto\n\n[x] Tanpopo - BE HAPPY Koi no Yajirobe\n\n[x] Tanpopo - Yarutokya Yaranakya Onna no Ko\n\n[x] Uehara Takako - AIR (Popjam 2002.10.05 live)\n\nThe long version of \"Mr. Moonlight\" includes a cute vocal skit in the beginning. Actually very amusing if you understand Japanese. [Plus you hear a cool saxaphone jazzy version of \"Mr. Moonlight\" in the background.] *g* Yoshizawa Hitomi sounds very amusing as a guy [not to mention she plays the part well in the original song anyway]. You can also read an English translation of the vocal drama. [Er, actually, just kidding -- they only have romaji. But if anyone is actually interested, I'll translate the dialogue... XD [Makoto's voice is so cute.]\n\nRecommendations are SOS, Kimutaku, Kuwata, Tanpopo, and Takako..."
