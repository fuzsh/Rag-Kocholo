However she is diagnosed with liver cancer, and Mishima shows up again and tells her, \"I came here to save your life\".\n\nMISIA commented, \"I feel that the love experience, which is remembered and has a influence on life, will never disappear even you become separated from each other. After reading the script, I created this song with the theme 'never ending love',\" and added, \"I sing the song with the hope that it will sympathize with the drama and love.\"\n\n'Hatsukoi' will start airing on May 22nd, every Tuesday at 10:00pm, for a total of eight episodes.\n\nAdditionally, MISIA will release a live DVD/Blu-ray on the same day \"Koi wa Owaranai Zutto\" for the nationwide tour 'THE TOUR OF MISIA JAPAN SOUL QUEST', which started in February 2011 and wrapped up in February 2012 at the Yokohama arena.
