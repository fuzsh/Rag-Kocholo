Happy birthday to MISIA, a Japanese singer who turns 31 today!!

MISIA is one of my favorite Japanese singers. She's said to have a five octave voice, which, if you think about it is really impressive. Her voice is strong and powerful, and full of feeling. I love it!

MISIA comes from a music family; her parents studied vocal music and her older brother and sister helped her learn piano at the age of four. She started singing in a chorus when she was nine, and won a singing contest shortly afterwards. She also attended a musical academy during high school.

She achieved her musical debut in 1998 after she auditioned for and was accepted to BMG Japan. Immediately her debut single achieved considerable commercial success, ranking #11 on the Oricon Charts, and at the end of the year she achieved two notable awards at the Japan Golden Disk Awards.

Interestingly enough, MISIA has never appeared on a musical variety show, although her popularity continued to climb years after her debut. She became the first female artist to perform in all five major domes of Japan. She has an impressive 8 albums in her repertoire, in addition to 1 mini-album, 1 live album, 4 remix albums, and 3 compilation albums, as well as 24 singles. All 24 singles made it to the top 10 on the Oricon Charts.

Her most recent release is Ginga / Itsumademo (which is available for download at

oriconcharts, and she is expecting to release her 9th album sometime in 2009.
