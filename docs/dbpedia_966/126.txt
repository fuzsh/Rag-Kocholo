Misia's song 'To be in Love' is a poignant exploration of love, longing, and the passage of time, set against the backdrop of a serene winter landscape. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a love that is both tender and melancholic, capturing the essence of a relationship that has left a deep imprint on the narrator's heart. The imagery of winter, with its cold and quiet beauty, serves as a metaphor for the stillness and purity of the narrator's feelings, as well as the sense of isolation and yearning that comes with being separated from a loved one.

The song begins with the narrator recalling a moment of shared joy, reflected in the eyes of their beloved. This memory is juxtaposed with the present, where the narrator is left alone, watching the snow fall silently. The snow, a recurring motif in the song, symbolizes both the passage of time and the enduring nature of the narrator's love. Despite the cold and the distance, the narrator's feelings remain warm and vibrant, as expressed in the repeated desire to see their beloved once more, to hold them, and to relive the happiness they once shared.

Misia's soulful delivery and the song's gentle melody enhance the emotional depth of the lyrics, making 'To be in Love' a heartfelt ode to the power of love and memory. The song captures the bittersweet reality of holding onto love in the face of separation, and the hope that, despite the passage of time and the changes it brings, the connection between two people can remain strong and true. The repeated references to 'Holy Night' suggest a sense of sacredness and reverence for the love shared, elevating it to something timeless and unbreakable.
