Songstress Misia's eighth full-length album since her debut in 1998 is chock-full of smooth dance and soul-edged melodies. Born in Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's four main islands, Misia grew up listening mostly to rock music.

However, the singer's own music displays a heavy gospel and R&B influence. Misia has a smooth, sultry voice that flows like molten chocolate, and she's known for her five-octave vocal range.

The album includes her two recent singles, Royal Chocolate Flush and Any Love. Her songs are loved by the media: Taiyo no Chizu is the theme song for the Fuji-Mezamashi TV series of the same name, and Soba ni Ite is used in the Kose beauty product commercials starring actress Matsushima Nanako.

Missing Autumn has a jazzy soul feel that's reminiscent of soul legend Barry White. It will get you on the dance floor, grooving to the bass beats.

Dance Dance is a moderately-paced dance track with funky harmonies and a fun melody that make you swing your hips and move your feet.

The album is a good mix of ballads and dance tracks. It won't disappoint established Misia fans and is a good way for R&B fans to get to know this talented star.
