        "text": "JERRY SIEGEL, Superman creator:\n\n“John Carter was able to leap great distances because the planet Mars was smaller than the planet Earth, and so he had great strength. I visualized the planet Krypton as a huge planet, much larger than Earth, so that whoever came to Earth from that planet would be able to leap great distances and lift great weights.” – (regarding how John Carter inspired Superman) (1983)\n\nPRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:\n\n“I am amazed at how few people I meet today know that Burroughs also provided an introduction to science fiction with John Carter of Mars and the other books he wrote about John Carter and his frequent trips to the strange kingdoms to be found on the planet Mars.”— (1981 letter).\n\nREVEREND BILLY GRAHAM\n\n“I read them all.” (regarding Tarzan novels) (November 1974 interview, San Angelo Standard-Times)\n\nTERRENCE WILCUTT, four-time shuttle astronaut, now a NASA administrator\n\n“I really liked John Carter . . . Characters such as Tarzan . . . helped me be honest and morally strong. They were good examples to emulate when you are growing up. The same can be said for John Carter . . . I would never have gone into space had it not been for someone in the past who wondered one day if space travel was possible.”\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG\n\n“I’ve always wanted to bring a serial to life that blends . . . elements from Edgar Rice Burroughs.” (regarding “Raiders of the Lost Ark”)\n\nGEORGE LUCAS:\n\n“Originally, I wanted to make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn’t obtain all the rights. So I began researching and found where (Flash Gordon creator) Alex Raymond got his idea: The works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, especially his John Carter series of books.” ( Science Fiction Review 24, December 1977)\n\n“In the grand tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ ‘John Carter of Mars'” – (Lucas’s May 1, 1975 synopsis of “Star Wars”)\n\nLEIGH BRACKETT, (novelist, writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “The Big Sleep”):\n\n“I was introduced to Edgar Rice Burroughs at a very young age . . . That changed the course of my life . . . My fascination for Mars came from the fascination for his Mars.” (interview, April 16-18, 1976)\n\n“My entire world changed when I was given the Warlord of Mars at the age of 8. I got onto Edgar Rice Burroughs . . . and the curtain went up. . . There was the universe and stars and comets and what-not, and I was never the same afterwards.” (interview, July 1975)"
