        "text": "These days, some Dungeon & Dragons players strongly oppose mixing science fiction and fantasy in the game, but the walls between two weren’t always so high, or so well-patrolled. The original version of D&D, published in 1974, refers to “robots” and “androids” (Book II: Monsters & Treasure, p. 22), and specifically invokes Edgar Rice Burroughs’ “Barsoom” stories in mentioning “the optionally useable ‘Martian’ animals, such as Apts, Banths, Thoats, etc.” (Book II, p. 20).\n\nThe 1981 Dungeons & Dragons Basic Rulebook, edited by Tom Moldvay, omits these references, but introduces its own possibly Barsoom-inspired creature: the white ape. I say “possibly” because the monster’s description differs from Burroughs’ portrayal, and because pulp literature, with which Moldvay was quite familiar, includes at least two other “white ape” antecedents. Of these three possible sources, however, only Burroughs’ A Princess of Mars is mentioned by name in the “Inspirational Source Material” section of the Basic Rules. Its inclusion, along with others of Burroughs’ works, sufficiently establishes the influence of this science fantasy novel, and its author, on the development of B/X.\n\nSynopsis\n\nCaptain John Carter of Virginia, a former soldier on the losing side in the American Civil War, is prospecting in Arizona when an encounter with Apaches finds him trapped him in a mountain cave, paralyzed by a strange vapor. Refusing to make the same mistake as their quarry, the Apaches leave Carter to his fate.\n\nFollowing their departure, and while making a desperate effort to rise, Carter suddenly finds himself standing naked in the cavern, separated from his body, which remains lying on the ground.\n\nExiting the cave in wonder at his new condition, Carter looks to the night sky, and finds himself captivated by the sight of the red planet Mars, which draws him inexorably through the darkness of space, where he wakes upon the world’s surface.\n\nThus begins a series of fantastic adventures among the denizens of Mars (which they call Barsoom). Carter learns of the dead sea bottoms, ruined cities, and flying ships of the red planet, variously fighting, befriending, commanding, or loving green and red Martians, savage white apes, his loyal calot Woola, and his incomparable princess, Dejah Thoris.\n\nBut Mars is a dying world. Carter finds he must risk everything to save the woman he loves, her people, and all of Barsoom. Will he be in time?\n\nInfluence on D&D\n\nWhite Apes\n\nAs mentioned above, Moldvay’s Basic Rules include the white ape as a monster—the first D&D rules set to do so. Barsoomian white apes, however, differ from Basic white apes. While Burroughs describes his white apes as 15 foot tall, six-limbed monstrosities, nothing in the Basic description, or Erol Otus’ illustration, indicates Moldvay’s apes are anything other than white gorillas.\n\nMoldvay does give his apes a role in some Neanderthal tribes similar to a niche Barsoomian apes fill among a type of Martian introduced later in the series, but the influence on Basic D&D remains more flavorful than concrete.\n\nThe Feel of the World\n\nThe Barsoom stories appear to have had a more significant impact on B/X through their setting and structure. Reading A Princess of Mars with D&D in mind, one can see obvious parallels with a B/X campaign. The main character drops into the story, knowing very little about this new world. In a sequence of discrete adventures, exploring ancient ruins filled with monsters and secrets, he prevails through wit, guile, luck, and force of arms, acquiring loyal retainers along the way. Eventually, he rescues a princess, earning the undying gratitude of her grandfather, the king of a mighty realm. The hero marries his princess, becoming a prince. Following this, however, his adventures are not over. A great danger threatens the realm—indeed, the entire world! Once again, he is called upon to sacrifice for princess, king, and country. That’s just the first book.\n\nCharacters\n\nAlong with a D&D-type storyline, A Princess of Mars gives us D&D-type characters:\n\nJohn Carter: A fighting man from a far away land, with a mysterious past.\n\nTars Tarkus: Lower chieftain of a barbarian horde, bent on revenge against his warlord for a wrong done long ago to the woman he loves.\n\nKantos Kan: A lieutenant in his king’s navy, seeking to aid his city against its greatest rival.\n\nDejah Thoris: Princess of the realm, and the most beautiful woman on Barsoom, who commands all around her with the dignity of her presence—especially her champion, John Carter.\n\nWoola: John Carter’s loyal animal companion, who would willingly follow him anywhere, even into the jaws of death.\n\nInspiration for your games\n\nBarsoom is such a rich vein of material for D&D, two separate B/X-compatible rules sets exist —one of them a complete setting—for playing out adventures on a Burroughsesque Mars. Here are some ideas for incorporating Barsoom-type elements into your campaign.\n\nThe Red Planet Beckons\n\nThe player characters discover the fourth planet from their sun is home to an incredibly ancient, decaying civilization. Somehow (astral projection, a flying ship, a magical portal) the party must travel to this dying world and find an artifact/stop an ancient evil/secure a powerful alliance to save their own.\n\nInvaders From Beyond\n\nThe skies over the kingdom are suddenly filled with strange, flying ships. The people of the dying fourth planet have come to seize the PCs’ world for their own. The party must forge alliances with old friends and old enemies alike, mount a resistance effort against the invaders, then secretly board the flagship of the armada, and find a way to stop the war. The fate of everything they know hangs in the balance!\n\nWeird Wizard In the Wilderness\n\nThe party hears odd rumors from the frontiers of the realm. Travelers tell of encountering bizarre creatures, and incomprehensible machines, beyond the borders. They pass along stories of strange disappearances (and even stranger reappearances) among those who live on the edge of the wilderness. Investigation leads the PCs to an unusual tower, inhabited by an even more unusual individual—an esoteric researcher from the fourth planet, exiled by his people because of his unorthodox experiments. He has traveled to the PCs’ world to continue his work, and he has no intention of letting them stand in his way…\n\nComing Soon\n\nThe Gods of Mars, by Edgar Rice Burroughs"
