        "text": "This paper investigates if and how colonialist tropes and Victorian values represented in Victorian children’s literature have survived to the present day in Italian translations through revisions, abridgements and illustrations in a text by one of the most representative Victorian authors, Rudyard Kipling, a paragon of the Empire-building period. The paper examines his celebrated The Jungle Books published in 1894 and 1895. The Jungle Books were printed in two volumes containing not only the celebrated Mowgli stories, but also other short stories such as “The White Seal” and “Rikki-Tikki-Tavi”. This paper will be looking exclusively at the series of stories in which Mowgli is the protagonist, and only in the volumes catalogued in the children’s section of libraries, examining how interpersonal relations among the characters, deeply embedded in Kipling’s Victorian convictions, are portrayed. These aspects relate particularly to hierarchy, authority, ‘the Law of the Jungle’, hunting ...\n\nThis paper deals with Rudyard Kipling’s (1865-1936) Kim (1901) based on Edward Said (1935-2003) and Homi K. Bhabha’s (1949) postcolonial theories, regarding ‘the Other’ and ‘hybrid identity’. Moreover, this paper shows how Kipling is in favor of imperialism in order to support the British Empire in India. The whole novel depicts the British administrators’ desire for power in order to provide their supremacy politically, economically and culturally. Based on Bhabha’s theories, the present paper investigates how concepts like ‘liminality,’‘ambivalence,’ and ‘hybrid identity’ of the colonial subject are constructed in a space that is called ‘Third Space of enunciation’. By considering the conditions of hybrid characters like Kim and Babu, the British imperial power attempts to educate and reform them as agents for its own desire. Through the process of reformation, although the hybrid characters endeavor to adapt the British habits, behaviors, values, language and culture, they are in...\n\nThe research paper aims to give an accurate account of how Kirpal Singh/Kip in The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje copies the socio-cultural and linguistic norms of the Europeans (colonizers) unlike Kipling’s Kim who emulates the Eastern people (colonized) and their culture. They are examples of going through a long drawn process of growing up, looking into the mirror of mimicry. Kip joins the English army as a grown up, learns the need to show affinity to the new culture by way of imitation, adopting their ways to weave a comfort zone. Being different could be an assaulting fact for both sides, Kip is quick to realize that. But his childish view of looking down upon his native culture is the irony of mimicry. It wipes out the original being to rewrite a new identity. Kip leaves the small community sprouted accidentally in the Italian monastery, showing traces of a stricken conscience. Kim, by the virtue of living in close company of Indians, adopts their habits and manners with...\n\nThis dissertation discusses the intertextual relationship that exists between Heart of Darkness (1899) and Tarzan of the Apes (1912), through a comparative study. In terms of a range of critical theories, it sheds light on the similarities and differences that exist between the two pieces of writing. Thus, Edgar Rice Burroughs’s novel is seen as an explanation for the ambiguity that exists in Conrad’s novella. The point here is not just to show how the latter echoes Conrad’s novella, but the way that these pieces of arts intervene within each other, because even with the binary that exists between the two in terms of high and low culture, they still transmit the same message by narrating two stories that follow the same events. Hence, the main focus is to draw the similarities and differences between the two texts and to explain how both novels tackle the issue of imperialism and racism. The two novels are examined and made to interact with each other in terms of dialogical and intertextual principles. In other words, they ‘dialogise’ with each other by adopting the same discourse, through which both authors show the way they see the other world ‘Africa’. This relationship between the two novels is examined from a number of perspectives: comparative, intertextual and postcolonial theory."
