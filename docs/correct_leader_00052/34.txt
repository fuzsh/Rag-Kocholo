Biography: Yitzhak Shamir was a Israeli politician who served as the seventh Prime Minister of Israel, in two terms, from 1983 to 1984 and from 1986 to 1992.

Born in 1915, Shamir moved with his family to British Mandate Palestine in 1922. He joined the underground Zionist group Stern Gang in 1940, and participated in a number of terrorist attacks against British targets in Palestine. In 1944 he was arrested by British authorities and sentenced to life in prison, but he escaped to Europe in 1946.

Returning to Palestine, Shamir became a leading member of the right-wing Zionist party Herut, and was elected to the Knesset in 1955. He held a number of ministerial posts in successive governments, including Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

As Prime Minister, Shamir oversaw the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the First Intifada in 1987. Under Shamir's leadership, Israel made little progress in peace negotiations with its Arab neighbours. In 1992, after failing to win re-election, Shamir retired from politics.
