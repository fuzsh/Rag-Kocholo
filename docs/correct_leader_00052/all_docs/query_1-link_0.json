        "text": "Yitzḥak Shamir (born October 15, 1915, Ruzinoy, Poland, Russian Empire [now Ruzhany, Belarus]—died June 30, 2012, Tel Aviv–Yafo, Israel) was a Polish-born Zionist leader and prime minister of Israel in 1983–84 and 1986–90 (in alliance with Shimon Peres of the Labour Party) and in 1990–92.\n\nShamir joined the Beitar Zionist youth movement as a young man and studied law in Warsaw. He immigrated to Palestine in 1935 and enrolled at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. There he joined the Irgun Zvai Leumi (IZL) underground movement; and in 1940, following a policy split in the IZL, he joined the Israel Freedom Fighters (IFF), a terrorist group later known as the Stern Gang (after its founder, Abraham Stern).\n\nFollowing the death of Stern, Shamir played a central part in reorganizing the Sternist Central Committee. Shamir was arrested by the British-mandate authorities in 1941 and 1946. After his second escape from internment, he made his way to France, where he was granted asylum. He returned to Israel in May 1948 and then served as a Mossad secret-service operative in Europe until 1965. After engaging in private commerce for a time, he joined Menachem Begin’s Herut movement, which in 1973 joined with other smaller parties to form the Likud. In March 1975 Shamir was elected chairman of the party executive of Herut. First elected to the Knesset (Israeli parliament) in 1973, he became speaker of the Knesset after the Likud’s electoral victory in 1977."
