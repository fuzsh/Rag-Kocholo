        "text": "Yitzhak Shamir, who has died aged 96, was the Zionist militant of the 1940s who became a hard-line prime minister of Israel in the 1980s.\n\nHe was born Yitzhak Jazernicki in Poland but changed his name to Shamir. He studied law at Warsaw University.\n\nBut in 1935, when he was 20, he came under the influence of a militant Zionist, gave up his studies and emigrated to Palestine, then under the British mandate.\n\nHis father, mother and sisters were killed during the Nazi occupation of Poland.\n\nIn Palestine, he joined an underground organisation, Irgun Zvai Leumi, led by another future Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin, and dedicated to fighting for an independent Jewish state.\n\nBut Irgun was not militant enough for Shamir, who believed that violence was the way to get results, and in 1940 he joined - and later led - the more extreme Stern Gang.\n\nThe British Foreign Office in the 1940s described him as \"among the most fanatical terrorist leaders\".\n\nIt was they who in 1946 blew up the King David Hotel, the British headquarters in Jerusalem, with the loss of 88 lives (15 of them Jewish), and killed the United Nations mediator, Count Bernadotte.\n\nShamir was twice arrested by the British and twice escaped, finally returning after the 1948 declaration of the state of Israel.\n\nFor the next seven years he worked in law and business, but in 1955 he joined Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, leaving after 10 years to campaign on behalf of Soviet Jewry.\n\nIn 1970 he joined the Herut Party, led by Begin, and three years later was elected to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset.\n\nHe was speaker from 1977-80, then foreign minister, and became prime minister in 1983, when Begin retired.\n\nHe soon showed that he was more decisive and resolute than many had expected.\n\nAfter the indecisive election of 1984 he formed a coalition with Shimon Peres of the Labour Party. It was agreed that Peres should be prime minister for the first two years, then Shamir took over again.\n\nHe disagreed with many of the things Peres had done. He was against the sort of international conference on the Middle East favoured by Peres. He did not want Moscow involved.\n\nAnd Peres was more conciliatory towards the Arabs than he was. Shamir was determined that there should never be a Palestinian state, and he was not prepared to hand back land. Though he wanted peace, he was not afraid of war."
