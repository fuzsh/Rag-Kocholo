Serving an economically and socially diverse community, we are proud to be the medical \"home base\" of Israel's cultural mosaic, caring for Jews, Muslims and Christians, religious and secular communities, low- and moderate-income families and veterans, as well as immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union. Our approach is based on the individual care we provide to all our patients and their families and an unwavering commitment to the community we serve.\n\nTreatment in Israel"
