Shamir began studying in Hebrew University, but left early in order to join the Jewish underground organization, the Etzel (Irgun), and later the Lehi (Stern Group).\nAfter the leader of the Lehi, Yair Stern, was murdered by the British, Shamir assumed command of Lehi operations, making him one of the organization's three leaders. In 1946 he was caught by the British and exiled to Africa, where he succeeded in digging a 200 foot tunnel and escaping to France. Shamir managed to return to Israel in 1948 and reassumed his position, leading the group during the War of Independence. \nIn 1955 Shamir joined the newly formed Mossad and became a senior member of the organization. He soon became involved in the struggle to free Soviet Jewry, an issue that launched him into politics. \nIn 1973 Shamir was elected into the Knesset as a member of Menachem Begin's party, and in 1983, was elected Prime Minister as the head of the Likud.\nOne of the most notable events in Shamir's tenure as Prime Minister was Operation Solomon â€“ the covert operation that airlifted over 14,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel. On June 30, 2012, Yitzhak Shamir passed away.\".",
