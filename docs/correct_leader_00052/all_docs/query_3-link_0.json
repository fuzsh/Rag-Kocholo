        "text": "Hospital in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel\n\nShamir Medical Center, formerly Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, is a teaching hospital in Be'er Ya'akov, 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, Israel.[2]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe Medical Center was named after Asaph the Jew, author of the Oath of Asaph and an early medical text.[3][4] The facility was established in 1918 as a military hospital of the British Army in the closing days of the First World War.[3] It was located adjacent to the sprawling British military base in Tzrifin (Sarafand). After the creation of the State of Israel, it was converted to an Israeli hospital.[3]\n\nThe hospital was renamed after the former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir in April 2017.\n\nServices[edit]\n\nIt is one of Israel's largest hospitals, with over 800 beds.[5][6] It serves over 370,000 people in Israel's Central District.[5][6] As a teaching facility, the hospital is part of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine of Tel Aviv University.[5] On its grounds are the first and largest Israeli academic nursing school and the oldest Israeli school of physiotherapy.[5]"
