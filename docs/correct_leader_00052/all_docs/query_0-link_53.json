Mr. Shamir devoted his life to the Jewish State from its founding through to modern times.\n\nMany major events in Israel’s short history include the participation of Mr. Shamir.\n\nB’nai B’rith leaders worked with Mr. Shamir and his close advisors during his years as prime minister, and later as an elder statesman, on issues related to the security of Israel.\n\nMay his memory be a blessing."
