        "text": "(1915–2012). Polish-born Israeli political leader Yitzhak Shamir was a fierce advocate for Jewish rights and for a homeland in Israel (see Zionism). He eventually served as prime minister of Israel from 1983 to 1984 and from 1986 to 1990, both times in alliance with Shimon Peres of the Labor Party, and then from 1990 to 1992 under his own coalition party. His hard-line approach to the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and his unwillingness to compromise with the Palestinians often set him in opposition to the U.S. government.\n\nShamir was born Yitzhak Jazernicki (also spelled Yezernitzky, Yizernitsky, or Ysernitzky) on October 15, 1915, in Ruzinoy, Poland, Russian Empire (now Ruzhany, Belarus). He joined a Zionist youth movement as a young man and studied law in Warsaw. In 1935 he immigrated to Palestine (then under British control) and changed his name to Shamir. (His family remaining in Poland perished during the Holocaust.) Shamir enrolled at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he joined the Irgun Zvai Leumi (IZL) underground movement. In 1940, following a policy split in the IZL, he joined the Israel Freedom Fighters (IFF), a terrorist group later known as the Stern Gang (after its founder, Abraham Stern).\n\nFollowing the death of Stern, Shamir played a central part in reorganizing the group’s leadership. Connected through the Stern Gang to political assassinations and general unrest, Shamir was arrested by the British-mandate authorities in 1941 and 1946. He escaped both times, eventually making his way to France, where he was granted asylum. After the State of Israel was proclaimed in May 1948, Shamir returned and served as a Mossad secret-service operative in Europe until 1965. After becoming a businessman for a time, he joined Menachem Begin’s Herut (“Freedom”) movement, which in 1973 joined with other smaller parties to form the Likud (“Unity”) Party. In March 1975 Shamir was elected chairman of the party executive of Herut. First elected to the Knesset (Israeli parliament) in 1973, he became speaker of the Knesset after the Likud’s electoral victory in 1977."
