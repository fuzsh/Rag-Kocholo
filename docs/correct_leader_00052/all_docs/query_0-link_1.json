Some authors (including political scientist Clive A. Jones and historians Avi Shlaim and Benny Morris[2]) later asserted that the 24th government of Israel was the most right-wing government in the country's history. Tehiya, Tzomet and Moledet all left the coalition in late 1991 and early 1992 in protest at Shamir's participation in the Madrid Conference, but the government remained in office until Yitzhak Rabin formed the twenty-fifth government, following the Labor Party's victory in the 1992 elections.\n\nIsraeli government formation, 1990\n\n← 1988 11 June 1990 1992 →\n\nNominee Yitzhak Shamir Shimon Peres Party Likud Labor Electoral vote 62 58 Percentage 51.6% 48.3%\n\nPrime Minister before election\n\nYitzhak Shamir\n\nLikud\n\nElected Prime Minister\n\nYitzhak Shamir\n\nLikud\n\nPosition Person Party Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir Likud Deputy Prime Minister David Levy Likud Moshe Nissim Likud Minister of Agriculture Rafael Eitan (until 31 December 1991) Tzomet Minister of Communications Rafael Pinhasi Shas Minister of Defense Moshe Arens Likud Minister of Economics and Planning David Magen Likud Minister of Education and Culture Zevulun Hammer National Religious Party Minister of Energy and Infrastructure Yuval Ne'eman (until 21 January 1992) Not an MK 1 Minister of the Environment Yitzhak Shamir Likud Minister of Finance Yitzhak Moda'i Likud Minister of Foreign Affairs David Levy Likud Minister of Health Ehud Olmert Likud Minister of Housing and Construction Ariel Sharon Likud Minister of Immigrant Absorption Yitzhak Peretz Shas Minister of Industry and Trade Moshe Nissim Likud Minister of Internal Affairs Aryeh Deri Not an MK 2 Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Yitzhak Shamir (from 27 November 1990) Likud Minister of Justice Dan Meridor Likud Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Yitzhak Shamir Likud Minister of Police Roni Milo Likud Minister of Religious Affairs Avner Shaki National Religious Party Minister of Science and Development Yuval Ne'eman (until 21 January 1990) Not an MK 1 Minister of Tourism Gideon Patt Likud Minister of Transportation Moshe Katsav Likud Minister without Portfolio Rehavam Ze'evi (5 February 1991 - 12 January 1992) Moledet Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Yigal Bibi (2 August - 20 November 1990) National Religious Party Shmuel Halpert (19 November 1990 - 8 June 1991) Agudat Yisrael Binyamin Netanyahu (from 11 November 1991) Likud Deputy Minister of Communications Efraim Gur (2 July - 20 November 1990) Unity for Peace and Immigration Deputy Minister of Defense Ovadia Eli Likud Deputy Minister of Education and Culture Pinchas Goldstein (from 20 November 1990) New Liberal Party Deputy Minister of the Environment Yigal Bibi (from 20 November 1990) National Religious Party Deputy Minister of Finance Yosef Azran (from 2 July 1990) Alignment Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Binyamin Netanyahu (until 11 November 1991) Likud Deputy Minister of Health Eliezer Mizrahi Agudat Yisrael, Geulat Yisrael Deputy Minister of Housing and Construction Avraham Ravitz Agudat Yisrael Deputy Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Avraham Verdiger (from 27 November 1990) Agudat Yisrael Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Menachem Porush (from 19 November 1990) Agudat Yisrael Shmuel Halpert (from 8 June 1991) Agudat Yisrael Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs Moshe Gafni (from 23 July 1990) Degel HaTorah Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Geula Cohen (until 31 October 1991) Tehiya Deputy Minister of Transportation Pinchas Goldstein (2 July - 20 November 1990) New Liberal Party\n\n1 Although Ne'eman was not a Knesset member at the time, he was a member of Tehiya.\n\n2 Although Deri was not a Knesset member at the time, he was a member of Shas."
