        "text": "Yitzhak Shamir (born Icchak Jaziernicky; 15 October 1915 - 30 June 2012) was a Polish born Israeli politician and the seventh Prime Minister of Israel, serving two terms, 1983–84 and 1986–92.\n\nHe was born in Ruzhinoy (nowadays in Belarus), in the Russian Empire in 1915. In 1935, Shamir went to Palestine, where he worked in an accountant’s office.[1] Before the establishment of the State of Israel, Shamir in the 1930s and 1940s was a member of the Zionist paramilitary organization Irgun, and then a commander of the more militant Lehi.\n\nAfter the establishment of the State of Israel, Yitzhak Shamir worked for Israel's security service, the Mossad from 1955 to 1965. He joined the Herut political party in 1969. He was elected to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, in 1973 as a member of political party Likud. He was the Prime Minister of Israel from 1983 to 1984 and from 1986 to 1992. He was the country’s second longest-serving prime minister after David Ben-Gurion.[1]\n\nHe died of Alzheimer's disease in Tel Aviv, Israel in 2012 and was buried in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.[1]\n\nReferences[change | change source]"
