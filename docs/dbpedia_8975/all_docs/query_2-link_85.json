        "text": "ISTANBUL\n\nUkraine on Sunday said three people were killed and 12 injured in the country’s eastern Donetsk region amid overnight Russian missile strikes.\n\nDonetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said in a Telegram statement that rescuers in the city of Dobropillia retrieved the bodies of two people from the rubble of a house hit by mortar fire.\n\nFilashkin further said a 66-year-old man died in the city of Chasiv Yar following an artillery strike on the city in the morning.\n\nHe also said the number of people injured in an overnight missile strike on the city of Myrnohrad rose to 12, adding that all those injured received the necessary medical assistance.\n\nThe governor had specified in an earlier statement that Russian forces fired three S-300 missiles at Myrnohrad.\n\nFilashkin’s comments came as the Ukrainian Air Force claimed that Russia hit the country’s eastern Kharkiv and Donetsk regions by launching four S-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles and 39 attack drones.\n\nThe statement said 35 of the drones launched were shot down over the Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Odesa, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, and Zhytomyr regions.\n\nKharkiv Governor Oleh Synyehubov said a recreation camp was shelled in the city of Bohodukhiv overnight, causing a minibus to catch fire and damaging a farm building.\n\nIn the Kyiv region, no hits were recorded on residential or critical infrastructure, Governor Ruslan Kravchenko said, while adding that windows in one private house were damaged.\n\nOdesa Governor Oleh Kiper said a drone hit an industrial facility, damaging the building and causing a fire that was later extinguished.\n\nRussian authorities have yet to comment on the reports."
