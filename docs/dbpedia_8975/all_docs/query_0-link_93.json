        "text": "The term \"Novorossia\" was officially enshrined in the legal acts of the Russian Empire in the spring of 1764. Considering the project of Nikita and Peter Panin on the further development of the province of New Serbia, located in the Zaporozhye lands (between the Dnieper and Sinyukha rivers), the young Empress Catherine II personally changed the name of the newly created province from Catherine to Novorossiysk.\n\nCatherine the Great\n\nWhat guided the ruler of Russia, choosing this name, is not yet known for certain. Perhaps this is a tribute to the administrative fashion of that era, when such provinces of the European metropolises as New England, New Holland and New Spain were known. It is possible that the Novorossiysk Territory was considered Catherine II as an \"alter ego\" of the Russian Empire - a territory that, being connected with the rest of the country, will simultaneously become a platform for working out socio-political and economic transformations. In any case, this majestic name obliged a lot. A province with such a name simply did not have the right to remain a sparsely populated and economically backward backwater of the empire.\n\nBefore joining Russia, the region of the Northern Black Sea region - the future New Russia - was often called the Wild Field. Even at the beginning XVIII century land from the southern suburbs of Poltava and Kharkov to Perekop itself was one continuous steppe. It was untouched virgin soil with black soil more than one meter deep. The rare population of the region consisted mainly of Crimean Tatars and Cossacks. Tatar hordes roamed with their herds and herds along the Black Sea coast, regularly raiding the lands of Russia and Poland.\n\nAn important source of income for the Crimean Khanate was the trade in slaves captured during the raids. The Cossacks settled along the banks of the rivers, engaged in hunting, fishing, farming and various crafts. They were at enmity with the nomads, attacked the Tatar detachments, stole herds. Often the Cossacks undertook expeditions to the Crimean coast, ruining the Tatar villages and freeing Christian slaves there.\n\nThe permanent steppe war went on for centuries. Serious changes in the appearance of the Black Sea region began to occur only in the middle. XVIII century, when by decision of the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna in the Russian part of the Black Sea steppes, the Novoserbian and Slavic-Serbian colonies were established. The Russian authorities tried to organize a mass resettlement of immigrants from the Balkan Peninsula to the created provinces: Serbs, Bulgarians, Moldavians, Volokhovs and others. The colonists were attracted by the generous distribution of land, the payment of \"lifting\" allowances, compensation for the cost of moving, benefits for taxes and duties. The main duty of the settlers was to carry out military service to protect the border of the Russian state.\n\nRussian settlers from Poland (especially the Old Believers) were attracted to New Serbia. In the newly built fortress of St. Elizabeth (near which the city of Elisavetgrad later arose, now Kirovograd), a large community of Old Believer merchants was formed, who were allowed to freely hold worship services and conduct very profitable domestic trade. By a special decree, local authorities were forbidden to forcibly shave their beards, to prevent the wearing of traditional clothes of the Old Believers.\n\nThe resettlement campaign of the 50s of the 18th century contributed to the formation of a multinational composition of the population of the Novorossiysk Territory. The control of the Russian authorities over the Zaporizhzhya Sich increased, and the economic development of the region received a tangible impetus. The Balkan colonists developed animal husbandry, horticulture, viticulture. Over 200 new villages, strongholds and fortresses grew up among the desert steppes in a short time, strengthening the defense of the southwestern borders of the Russian Empire.\n\nAt the same time, this stage of the development of the Northern Black Sea region showed that it is impossible to solve the problem of settling and economic development of a vast region only at the expense of immigrants. Attracting foreign settlers was too expensive (an astronomical amount of almost 700 thousand rubles was spent on the arrangement of the provinces over 13 years). Many immigrants from the Balkan Peninsula were not ready for the hardships of life in a poorly developed region and returned to their homeland.\n\nCatherine II noticeably intensified the process of development of the Black Sea steppes. According to the apt expression of one of the first researchers of the history of the Novorossiysk Territory Apollo Skalkovsky, \"34 years of Catherine's reign - the essence of 34 years of the History of Novorossiysk.\"\n\nThe fragmentation and lack of control over the actions of local civilian and military authorities was eliminated. For this, the post of Novorossiysk governor (chief commander) was introduced. In the summer of 1764, in addition to the Novoserbian province, which had lost its autonomous status, Slavic-Serbia (a region on the southern bank of the Northern Donets), the Ukrainian fortified line and the Bakhmut Cossack regiment were subordinated to it. To ensure better manageability of the province, it was divided into 3 provinces: Elisabeth, Catherine and Bakhmut. In September 1764, at the request of local residents, the Little Russian town of Kremenchug was included within the boundaries of Novorossia. Later, the provincial office moved here.\n\nLieutenant-General became the first governor of Novorossiya Alexander Melgunov. It was under his leadership that land management work began in the province. The entire land of the former New Serbia (1421 thousand acres) was divided into plots of 26 acres (forested land) and 30 acres (forestless land). “People of all ranks” could receive land in hereditary possession, provided that they entered the military service or were recorded in the peasant class. Land plots were assigned to eight local regiments: the Black and Yellow Hussars, the Elisavetgrad pikemen (on the right bank of the Dnieper), the Bakhmut and Samara hussars, as well as the Dnieper, Lugansk, Donetsk pikemen regiments (on the left bank of the Dnieper). Later, on the basis of this regimental division, a district device was introduced.\n\nIn the 60s of the XVIII century, the settlement of the Novorossiysk province began at the expense of internal Russian settlers. This was greatly helped by the permission to move within the new province for the inhabitants of Little Russia (earlier, the resettlement of Little Russians to New Serbia was not welcome). The migration of peasants from the central provinces of Russia was facilitated by the distribution of land to military and civil officials - the nobility. To equip their new possessions, they began to transport their serfs to the south.\n\nIn 1763-1764, special laws were issued to regulate the situation of foreign settlers. They received permission to settle in cities or rural areas, individually or in colonies. They were allowed to start manufactories, factories and plants, for which they could buy serfs. The colonists had the right to open auctions and fairs without imposing duties. To all this, various loans, benefits and other incentives were added. An office for the guardianship of foreigners was specially established.\n\nApproved in 1764, the \"Plan on the distribution of state lands in the Novorossiysk province for their settlement\" solemnly announced that the settlers, regardless of where they came from, would enjoy all the rights of \"ancient Russian subjects.\"\n\nNevertheless, during this period, conditions were formed for the predominantly Great Russian-Little Russian colonization of Novorossia. The result of this policy was the rapid growth of the population in the southern limits of European Russia. Already in 1768, excluding regular troops stationed in the region on a temporary basis, about 100 thousand people lived in the Novorossiysk Territory (at the time the province was formed, the population of Novorossia was up to 38 thousand people).\n\nThe conclusion of the Kyuchuk-Kainarji peace treaty in 1774 led to a significant expansion of the Novorossiysk Territory. Its territory grew into the Bug-Dnieper interfluve, Azov and the Azov lands, as well as the fortresses of Kerch, Yenikale and Kinburn in the Crimea.\n\nGrigory Potemkin\n\nShortly before the conclusion of peace (by decree of March 31, 1774), the governor of Novorossia was appointed Grigory Potemkin. In the beginning. In 1775, the staff of Potemkin's office was equal in number to the staff of the Little Russian governor. This indicated an increase in the status of the young province.\n\nIn February 1775, the Azov province stood out from it, which included in its composition part of the Novorossiysk province (Bakhmut district), new acquisitions under the Kyuchuk-Kaynardzhiysky treaty and \"all the dwellings\" of the Don army, which actually retained its autonomy. However, this administrative division of the region was mitigated by the appointment of Grigory Potemkin as the governor-general of the formed administrative units. At the same time, he became the commander of all troops settled in the Novorossiysk, Azov and Astrakhan provinces.\n\nThe advance of Russia along the Black Sea coast led to the fact that the Zaporizhzhya Sich was not on the external borders, but inside the Russian territory. Together with the weakening of the Crimean Khanate, this made it possible to abolish the restless Cossack freemen. On June 4, 1775, the Sich was surrounded by troops under the command of Lieutenant General Petra Tekeli, and she surrendered without resistance.\n\nAfter that, a census of the Sich was carried out in the settlements, for those wishing to settle in the Dnieper province (as the Zaporizhzhya Sich began to be called), places were assigned for further residence. The funds left after the liquidation of the Sich (120,000 rubles) went to the arrangement of the Black Sea provinces.\n\nIn 1778, Grigory Alexandrovich presented Catherine II with the \"Institution for the Novorossiysk and Azov provinces.\" It consisted of seventeen chapters with an appendix of exemplary states of provincial institutions.\n\nIn the Novorossiysk province, it was planned to rebuild the cities of Kherson, Olga, Nikopol, Vladimir; fortresses Novopavlovskaya, Novogrigoryevskaya along the Bug. In addition to those named, there remained the provincial city of Slavyansk (Kremenchug), Novye Sanzhary, Poltava, Dneprograd; fortress of St. Elizabeth, Ovidiopolskaya. In the Azov province, cities were to appear: Yekaterinoslav, Pavlograd and Mariupol. Among the old fortresses Aleksandrovskaya, Belevskaya are mentioned; the cities of Tor, Bakhmut and others.\n\nThe resettlement policy in the 70-80s of the 18th century is often called the landowner colonization of Novorossiya. The state at that time not only generously distributed land for estates, but also stimulated the landowners in every possible way to populate their possessions with tax-paying population.\n\nOn July 25, 1781, a decree was issued that ordered the transfer of economic (state) peasants to Novorossia \"voluntarily and at their own request.\" Settlers in their new places received \"a benefit from taxes for a year and a half, so that during this time taxes would be paid for by the inhabitants of their former village,\" who received the land of those leaving for this. Soon, the period of benefits from paying taxes for land was significantly extended. According to this decree, it was ordered to transfer up to 24 thousand economic peasants. This measure encouraged the migration, first of all, of middle and prosperous peasants, who were able to organize strong farms on the settled lands.\n\nLong-term Governor-General of Novorossia Count Mikhail Vorontsov\n\nAlong with the legal resettlement sanctioned by the authorities, there was an active popular unauthorized resettlement movement from the central provinces and Little Russia. B about Most of the unauthorized settlers settled in the landowners' estates. However, in the conditions of Novorossia, serf relations took the form of so-called allegiance, when the peasants living on the landowner's land retained personal freedom, and their obligations to the owners were limited.\n\nIn August 1778, the transfer of Christians (Greeks and Armenians) from the Crimean Khanate to the Azov province began. Settlers were exempted for 10 years from all state taxes and duties; all their property was transported at the expense of the treasury; each new settler received 30 acres of land in a new place; the state built houses for the poor \"settlers\" and supplied them with food, seeds for sowing and draft animals; all settlers were forever freed \"from military posts\" and \"summer cottages in the army recruit.\" According to the decree of 1783, in \"villages of Greek, Armenian and Roman laws\" it was allowed to have \"courts of Greek and Roman law, an Armenian magistrate.\"\n\nAfter Crimea was annexed to the empire in 1783, the military threat to the Black Sea provinces was significantly weakened. This made it possible to abandon the military-settlement principle of the administrative structure and extend the action of the Institution on the provinces of 1775 to Novorossia.\n\nSince the Novorossiysk and Azov provinces did not have the required population, they were united into the Yekaterinoslav governorate. Grigory Potemkin was appointed its governor-general, and the immediate ruler of the region - Timofey Tutolmin, soon replaced Ivan Sinelnikov. The territory of the governorship was divided into 15 counties. In 1783, 370 thousand people lived within its borders.\n\nAdministrative transformations contributed to the development of the region's economy. Agriculture spread. In a review of the state of the Azov province in 1782, the beginning of agricultural work was noted on \"a vast expanse of fertile and fat lands, which were previously neglected by the former Cossacks.\" Lands and state money were allocated for the creation of manufactories, the creation of enterprises that produced products that were in demand by the army and navy: cloth, leather, morocco, candle, rope, silk, dye and others were especially encouraged. Potemkin initiated the transfer of many factories from the central regions of Russia to Yekaterinoslav and other cities of New Russia. In 1787, he personally reported to Catherine II about the need to transfer part of the state-owned porcelain factory from St. Petersburg to the south, and always with the masters.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 18th century, active searches for coal and ores began in the Northern Black Sea region (especially in the Donets basin). In 1790 the landowner Alexey Shterich and mining engineer Carl Gascoigne instructed to search for coal along the rivers Northern Donets and Lugan, where in 1795 the construction of the Lugansk foundry began. A village of the same name arose around the plant. To provide this plant with fuel, the first mine in Russia was laid, in which coal was mined on an industrial scale. At the mine, the first mining village in the empire was built, which laid the foundation for the city of Lisichansk. In 1800, the first blast furnace was launched at the plant, where pig iron was produced using coke for the first time in the Russian Empire.\n\nThe construction of the Lugansk foundry was the starting point for the development of South Russian metallurgy, the creation of hard coal mines and mines in the Donbass. Subsequently, this region will become one of the most important centers of Russia's economic development.\n\nEconomic development strengthened trade ties between individual parts of the Northern Black Sea region, as well as between Novorossia and the central regions of the country. Even before the annexation of Crimea, the possibilities of transporting goods across the Black Sea were intensively studied. It was assumed that one of the main export items would be bread, which would be grown in large quantities in Ukraine and the Black Sea region.\n\nIn order to stimulate the development of trade, in 1817 the Russian government introduced a \"porto-franco\" (free trade) regime in the port of Odessa, which at that time was the new administrative center of the Novorossiysk General Government.\n\nOdessa allowed free and duty-free importation of foreign goods, including those prohibited for import into Russia. The export of foreign goods from Odessa into the country was allowed only through the outposts according to the rules of the Russian customs tariff with the payment of duties on a general basis. The export of Russian goods through Odessa was carried out in accordance with the existing customs rules. At the same time, the duty was levied at the port when loading onto merchant ships. Russian goods imported only to Odessa were not subject to duty.\n\nThe city itself received huge opportunities for its development from such a system. Buying raw materials without duty, entrepreneurs opened factories within the free port area that processed these raw materials. Since the finished products produced at such factories were considered to be manufactured in Russia, they were sold without duties within the country. Often, products made from imported raw materials within the Odessa free port did not go beyond customs posts at all, but were immediately sent abroad.\n\nQuite quickly, the port of Odessa turned into one of the main transshipment points of the Mediterranean and Black Sea trade. Odessa grew rich and grew. By the end of the expiration of the free port, the capital of the Novorossiysk Governor-General became the fourth largest city in the Russian Empire after St. Petersburg, Moscow and Warsaw.\n\nThe initiator of the experiment on the introduction of free port was one of the most famous governor-generals of Novorossia - Emmanuil Osipovich de Richelieu. He was the great-great-great-great-nephew of the French Cardinal Richelieu. It was this official who made the decisive contribution to the mass settlement of the Black Sea Territory. In 1812, through the efforts of Richelieu, the conditions for the resettlement of foreign colonists and internal migrants to the region were finally equalized. Local authorities received the right to issue cash loans to needy migrants from other provinces of the empire “from the sums for the wine farming” and bread for crops and food from bread shops.\n\nAt first, food was prepared for the settlers in new places, part of the fields were sown, tools and draft animals were prepared. For the construction of dwellings, peasants received building materials from new places. In addition, they were given 25 rubles for each family free of charge.\n\nThis approach to resettlement stimulated the migration of economically active and enterprising peasants to Novorossia, who formed a favorable environment for the spread of free labor and capitalist relations in agriculture.\n\nThe Novorossiysk General Government lasted until 1874. During this time, it absorbed the Ochakov region, Tauris and even Bessarabia. Nevertheless, the unique historical path, combined with a number of other factors, continues to determine the general mentality of the inhabitants of the Northern Black Sea region. It is based on the synthesis of various national cultures (primarily Russian and Ukrainian), love of freedom, selfless work, economic enterprise, rich military traditions, and the perception of the Russian state as a natural defender of its interests.\n\nIgor IVANENKO\n\nNovorossiya(Novorossiysk Territory, New Russia, New Russia) - a synonym for the Novorossiysk province and the Novorossiysk Governorate-General, in a broad sense - the historical territories of the Northern Black Sea region, annexed to the Russian Empire as a result of Russian-Turkish wars in the second half of the 18th century. They included Kherson, Yekaterinoslav, Tauride, Bessarabia provinces, as well as the Kuban region. The term was used at the beginning of the 20th century, but after the revolution it was practically banned, while a significant part of the lands of Novorossia was included by the Bolsheviks in the Ukrainian SSR. The term received a new distribution in 2013-2014, as a result of the events that took place in Ukraine, which led to protests in the South-East of Ukraine.\n\nHistory of development\n\nThe Russian Empire gradually annexed this territory during the wars with the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire. Before the inclusion of these lands into Russia, the Crimean Khanate was located here, in the west - Moldavia, in the northern part - the lands of the Zaporizhzhya Cossacks, who had a special status in the Commonwealth. After the Pereyaslav Rada and the entry of the Zaporizhian Army into the Russian kingdom, the latter intensified the process of colonization of the territory. The settlement of the region began with the creation of small settlements founded by Zaporozhye Cossacks and Russian settlers. In the first half of the 18th century, the border between Russia and Turkey was clearly defined here for the first time.\n\nIn 1752, the first military-agricultural settlement of Serbs and Hungarians from Austria-Hungary was formed, called New Serbia, later followed by the Bulgarians and Volokhi. Later, the region was divided into New Serbia (from the Polish lands to the Dnieper) and Slavic Serbia (to the east of the Dnieper along the Ukrainian border line).\n\nIn 1764, the territory of deployment of the hussar regiments of the Novoserbian military corps, which consisted of the entire local male population, was transformed into the Novorossiysk province, which included Slavic Serbia and the Ukrainian line. Initially, Novorossia covered the territory of the Bakhmut district (formerly part of the Voronezh province), Mirgorodsky and Poltava regiments (from the Hetmanate). Since 1765, the center of the province was Kremenchug (Poltava region).\n\nThe development of Novorossia became widespread from the end of the 18th century under the leadership of Prince Potemkin, who was given almost unlimited powers for this. Under him, Zaporozhye (Dnepropetrovsk region) was annexed to Novorossia, and a new center Yekaterinoslav was built (1776). In 1778, Kherson became the most southwestern city of Novorossia. In 1783 Novorossiya was joined by the Crimea.\n\nAdministratively, the Novorossiysk province existed during the time of Catherine II, from 1764 to 1775, and during the time of Paul I, from 1796 to 1802, when it was divided into Nikolaev, Yekaterinoslav and Tauride provinces. The center was located initially in the city of Kremenchug, then from 1783 in the city of Yekaterinoslav. In 1803, the Nikolaev province was renamed Kherson. The Novorossiysk-Bessarabian General Government lasted until 1873.\n\nIn the Russian Empire, Novorossia was distinguished by the high level of European culture of the first governors and mayors, who had great organizational skills and state initiative (G. A. Potemkin, I. N. Inzov and others).\n\nAccording to Professor Dergachev, Novorossia, and in particular the territory of the Ukrainian Black Sea region, can be considered as an example of the most successful European regional integration in the Russian Empire. In Novorossia, lands were distributed to Russians, Germans, Serbs, Bulgarians, Armenians, Greeks, and others. An attempt was also made to settle Jewish colonists on the land. European liberalism, traditions of economic freedom and multi-ethnicity provided its inhabitants with a high quality of life.\n\nOn the site or near small Cossack and Tatar settlements, many new cities were founded, such as Yekaterinoslav (now Dnepropetrovsk), Nikolaev, Kherson, Elisavetgrad, Odessa, Tiraspol, Sevastopol, Simferopol, Mariupol.\n\nAs a result, the population here acquired a mixed composition: Ukrainians - especially in the rural areas of the western part of Novorossiya, Russians (everywhere in the cities and eastern part of Novorossiya, as well as in many rural areas of western Novorossiya) and Jews (mainly in the cities). The Bulgarians made up a significant percentage of the population in the Berdyansk district and in the south of Bessarabia, the Greeks - in the villages of the Mariupol district (descendants of immigrants from the Crimea), the Germans made up almost a quarter of the population of the Perekop district.\n\nNovorossiya after 1872\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Novorossiysk-Bessarabian General Government, the term ceased to correspond to any specific territorial unit. On January 22, 1918, the Ukrainian Central Rada laid claim to Novorossiya. However, the region resisted the transition to Ukrainian possession. Under the Soviet slogans in 1918, the Odessa Soviet Republic, the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic appeared, which were then merged into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. However, these ephemeral Soviet republics of Novorossiya were liquidated as a result of the German offensive. During the return of these lands to Russia in 1919-1920. the Novorossiysk region was again recreated with the center in Odessa. In 1919, detachments of the Makhnovists operated on the territory of Novorossia.\n\nWhen the Ukrainian SSR was created, most of Novorossia was included in it.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the urban population of Novorossia was mainly on the side of the whites, and the prosperous peasantry supported the local rebel groups. For this reason, after the establishment of Soviet power in Novorossia, mass repressions swept across the region, especially in the Crimea and Odessa, and the name of the region was taken out of use.\n\nIn the territories of Novorossia with a predominantly non-Russian population in the 1920s-1930s. a policy of indigenization was carried out, during which elements of the language and culture of the nationalities living on these lands (Ukrainians, Germans, Greeks, Bulgarians, etc.) were promoted and introduced. In the late 1930s, indigenization was curtailed, and Russification came in its place. During the Great Patriotic War and after its end, German settlers and Crimean Tatars in full force were evicted to Siberia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, Greek and others - partially.\n\nIn 1932, during the industrialization, the first Dneproges unit was put into operation.\n\nModern usage of the term\n\nStarting from March-April 2014, the term \"Novorossiya\" has been actively used by supporters of the federalization of Ukraine and the secession of the eastern regions from its composition.\n\nIn March, a street \"people's referendum\" was held on the entry of the Nikolaev region into the federal district of Novorossiya. In April, a massive pro-Russian rally was held in Odessa, the participants of which voted for the creation of the Odessa People's Republic of Novorossiya (ONRN).\n\nOn April 17, Russian President V.V. Putin, during the traditional “straight line”, called the South-East of Ukraine Novorossia:\n\nThe southeast of Ukraine is Novorossia: Kharkiv, Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Nikolaev, Odessa were not part of Ukraine in tsarist times, these are all territories that were transferred to Ukraine in the 20s by the Soviet government.\n\nCounting on a repetition of the precedent of Crimea and Sevastopol joining Russia, after the referendums on May 11 and the declaration of sovereignties on May 12, the self-proclaimed authorities of the Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" expressed their desire to join Russia and unite into Novorossia.\n\nNovorossiya owes its birth to Catherine II the Great.\n\n250 years ago, first in legal acts, then on geographical maps, the name \"Novorossiya\" first appeared. This name was given to the new Russian province, which was created on the former lands of the Zaporizhian army by transforming the military settlement region of New Serbia. New Serbia is an administrative-territorial unit in the Russian Empire (located on the territory of modern Ukraine), created by the government in the northwestern part of Zaporozhye (the territory of the Kodatskaya and Bugogardovskaya palanoks of the Zaporizhzhya Army), where immigrants from Serbia, Montenegro were resettled in 1751-1764, Wallachia, Macedonia and other Balkan regions. Proposals for the creation and arrangement of the Novorossiysk province were approved by Catherine II on April 2 (according to the old style - March 22), 1764.\n\nIt is curious that the initiators of the reforms proposed to name the new administrative unit Catherine's province (in honor of Catherine II), but the empress opposed. Her resolution on the corresponding document read: \"to call the province Novorossiysk.\"\n\nIt is important to note that Catherine the Great paid great attention to security and the development of the southern borders of the Russian Empire. According to the apt expression of one of the first researchers of the history of the Novorossiysk Territory, A. A. Skalkovskiy, “34 years of the reign of Catherine is the essence of 34 years of the History of Novorossiysk”.\n\nShortly after gaining autocratic power, Catherine II took a number of steps that had a huge impact on the fate of the Novorossiysk Territory. The empress introduced significant benefits for immigrants: the provision of land, exemption from taxes and all sorts of duties, interest-free loans for housing and farming, to cover the costs of moving, buying food before the first harvest, livestock, agricultural implements or tools for artisans. Foreign settlers who created their own production were allowed to trade and even export goods abroad duty-free. New subjects received the right to freedom of religion and the opportunity to build their places of worship.\n\nThe activities of the authorities of the Novoserbsk province became the subject of special attention of the Russian government. This attention was caused by insufficiently rapid colonization of the area with huge government appropriations for this project. In addition, one after another, complaints were received in St. Petersburg about abuses and arbitrariness that were happening in the provinces. Under these conditions, the Empress was forced to remove Ivan Horvat, the founder of the New Serbia colony, from his post.\n\nThe Croat was extremely unscrupulous in spending the money he received on the initial acquisition of new aliens; for the most part, he took this money for himself, and the settlers suffered all sorts of hardships. All management of the affairs of the region was concentrated in the chancellery established by the decision of the Senate in the city of Mirgorod, which was arranged by Horvat and served as his residence. But in this office sat all the relatives of Horvath, including his two young sons who were considered in the service.\n\nThe situation of ordinary migrant soldiers was especially difficult; one day a crowd of them, driven to despair by hunger, came to ask for bread right at Horvath's house; he gave the case such a look as if it were a riot, dispersed the crowd with buckshot and put the body of one of the dead on a wheel outside the city. It is not surprising that the settlers, forced by hunger, sometimes indulged in robbery; and Horvath himself organized raids on the Polish borders.\n\nTo determine the best device for the region, 2 special committees were established (on the affairs of New Serbia, as well as Slavic-Serbia and the Ukrainian Fortified Line).\n\nLieutenant-General Alexander Petrovich Melgunov, one of the most influential courtiers under the former Emperor Peter III, took part in the work of both committees, but fell into disgrace after his overthrow. It was A.P. Melgunov who was to become the first governor of Novorossiya. However, this was preceded by a very revealing story, demonstrating the mores of the high-ranking bureaucracy of that time.\n\nWhen clouds began to gather over I. O. Horvat, he went to the capital and tried to bribe the most influential people at court, including A. P. Melgunov. The latter honestly told the emperor about the received offering. Peter III praised his favorite, took half the amount for himself and ordered the Senate to decide the case in favor of I. O. Horvat. However, after the change of autocrat, A.P. Melgunov had to more impartially investigate the sins of the former donor.\n\nCatherine II approved the conclusions of the above committees. The fragmentation and lack of control over the actions of the heads of local administrations and military authorities were recognized as the main obstacle to the effective development of the region. In the spring of 1764, the Novoserbsk settlement and the military corps of the same name were transformed into the Novorossiysk province under the unified authority of the governor (chief commander). In the summer of the same year, the Slavic-Serbian province, the Ukrainian fortified line and the Bakhmut Cossack regiment were subordinated to the province.\n\nTo ensure better manageability of the province, it was divided into 3 provinces: Elisavetinskaya (with its center in the fortress of St. Elizabeth), Catherine's (with its center in the Belevskaya fortress) and Bakhmutskaya. In September 1764, at the request of local residents, the Little Russian town of Kremenchug was included within the boundaries of Novorossia. The provincial office was later transferred here.\n\nThese steps served as the beginning of the implementation of a large-scale plan for the development of the Novorossiysk province, developed by the first governor of the region. In May - June 1764, new trading cities and customs were identified. Outside the former Novoserbia, they were the fortress of St. Elizabeth, the port on the Khortitsky island and the town of Orlik (Olviopol) on the Southern Bug.\n\nThe most important measures for the development of the province consisted in streamlining land use. The entire land of the former Novoserbia, which amounted to 1421 thousand acres, was divided into 36400 plots assigned to local regiments. The territory of the province was divided between 8 regiments. On the right bank of the Dnieper (Elisavetinskaya province) there were the Black and Yellow Hussars, the Elisavetgrad pike regiments. On the left bank - the Bakhmut and Samara (former Moldavian) hussar regiments, as well as the Dnieper, Lugansk, Donetsk pikemen regiments. Later, on the basis of the regimental administrative-territorial division, a county structure was introduced.\n\nThree types of settlements were established: state, landlord and military. Those wishing to settle down were given as much land as they could inhabit, but no more than 48 dachas. A lieutenant, an ensign, a regimental auditor, a quartermaster, a commissar, a doctor received 4 yards (plots), that is, 104-120 acres of land, in rank possession; captain, captain - 6 sections each (156‑180 acres); second major - 7 plots (182‑210 acres); colonel - 16 plots (416‑480 acres) of land. Having populated it, the owner of the rank dacha became its owner, if he did not think to populate it within the established time frame, he lost this right.\n\nAlong with land plots, military and civil officials received permits (“open lists”) for the withdrawal from abroad of free “people of all ranks and nations, to be assigned to regiments or settled on their own or state lands.” With the successful completion of this task, officials were entitled to substantial incentives. For the withdrawal of 300 people, the rank of major was assigned, 150 - captain, 80 - lieutenant, 60 - warrant officer, 30 - sergeant major.\n\nThe rapid settlement of Novorossia was facilitated by the permission to move within the new province for the inhabitants of Little Russia (previously, the resettlement of Little Russians to New Serbia was not welcome). This permission was also actively used by the Old Believers who lived in Little Russian towns. They actively moved to Elisavetograd, where a large community of Old Believers already existed. In the previously lifeless steppes, large villages arose: Zlynka, Klintsy, Nikolskoye, and others. Old Believer churches and even a printing house were erected in these villages (in the village of Nikolskoye). The resettlement of the Old Believers became so massive that in 1767 the government was forced to impose restrictions on this process.\n\nAnother important resource for replenishing the population of the Novorossiysk Territory was the resettlement by the nobles, who acquired land in the south, of their own serfs from the central provinces of Russia.\n\nThus, the necessary conditions were created for a multinational, but predominantly Great Russian-Little Russian colonization of Novorossia. The result of this policy was the rapid growth of the population in the southern limits of European Russia. Already in 1768, excluding regular troops stationed in the region on a temporary basis, about 100 thousand people lived in the Novorossiysk Territory (at the time of the formation of the province, the population of Novorossia was up to 38 thousand). The Russian Empire literally before our eyes acquired the most important stronghold for the struggle for dominance in the Black Sea - Novorossia.\n\nFollowing the Russian Empire, the name Novorossiya has sunk into history for a long time. Now this name is again on everyone's lips, it is now known not only in Russia and neighboring countries, but all over the world. We will try to plunge into history and consider what this land was like, how it was mastered, what names are associated with it.\n\nOf course, these places were inhabited many centuries ago, but they began to actively develop after the time of Peter the Great. Here, after all, access to the Black and Azov Seas, and hence the development of trade with European, and maybe other countries. Once, in the 13th-16th centuries, the Crimean Tatars ruled here. In the steppe for many miles there was not a single tree or village. Only robbers were enough - from among the Tatars.\n\nThere were few infertile soils and they were located closer to the sea. The most full-flowing rivers were the Dnieper, Dniester and Bug, the rest of the small rivers disappeared during frequent droughts. There was an abundance of fish in the rivers, on land - deer, fallow deer, saigas, wild boars and horses, foxes, badgers, many species of birds. “Wild horses were found here in herds of 50-60 heads, and it was extremely difficult to tame them; they were hunted, and horse meat was sold on a par with beef. The climate of the region is warmer than in many other areas of Russia. All together, this created favorable conditions for attracting Russian settlers.\n\nHowever, the paths of history are not simple. Life in the steppe was associated with many inconveniences, and for a person of the 17th century. was extremely difficult. So, because of the dry continental climate, winters were severe, with winds and blizzards, and droughts often occurred in summer. The steppes were open on all sides to the action of the winds, the north wind brought cold with it, and the east wind brought terrible dryness and heat. The insufficient amount of river water and the rapid absorption of evaporation by the atmosphere due to dry winds led to the fact that in summer all the rich vegetation dried up.\n\nSprings and wells in the southeastern part of the Novorossiysk Territory were located only along the banks of the rivers, and there was not a single one on the mountain in the steppe, so roads were laid near the rivers. In addition to drought, swarms of locusts, as well as clouds of midges and mosquitoes, were a real misfortune. All this was a serious obstacle to the full-fledged occupation of cattle breeding and agriculture, not to mention the constant danger of an attack by the Tatars. Thus, the first colonists were forced to fight both with nature and with the Crimean Tatars, performing a defensive function.\n\nThe beginning of the settlement of the Novorossiysk steppes in the first half. 18th century\n\nThe first settlers of the Novorossiysk steppes were the Zaporozhye Cossacks, who founded their Sich behind the Dnieper rapids on the island of Khortitsa in the second half of the 16th century. Since that time, the places of the Sich have changed - either on the island of Tomakovka, then on Mikitin Rog, then on Chertomlytsky Rechishche, then on the river. Kamenka, then in the tract Oleshki, then over the Podpolnaya river. Resettlement from one place to another was due to many reasons, natural conditions played a big role.\n\nAt the first time of its historical existence in the XVI - early. 17th century The Zaporizhzhya Sich was a military brotherhood hiding from the Tatars on the Dnieper Islands, renouncing by necessity many forms of proper civilian life - family, personal property, agriculture, etc. The second goal of the brotherhood was the colonization of the steppe. Over time, the limits of Zaporozhye extended more and more to the account of the Wild Field, the Tatar steppe. In the XVIII century. Zaporizhzhya Sich was a small “enclosed city, containing one church, 38 so-called kurens and up to 500 smoking Cossack, trading and artisan houses”.\n\nIt was the capital of the army, destroyed in 1775. The Zaporozhye lands occupied the territory on which the Yekaterinoslav and Kherson provinces were subsequently formed, with the exception of the Ochakov region, that is, the area lying between the Bug and the Dniester. They stretched mainly along the river. Dnieper.\n\nZaporizhzhya settlements were scattered over a vast area, the population was engaged in cattle breeding, agriculture, and other peaceful crafts. Exact data on the number of inhabitants is unknown. “According to the official statement compiled by Tevelius at the time of the destruction of the Zaporizhzhya Sich, there were (except for the Sich in the strict sense of the word) 45 villages and 1601 winter quarters, all the inhabitants were 59637 hours of both sexes.” The historian of the Novorossiysk Territory, Skalkovsky, counted 12,250 people on the basis of original documents from the Sich archive. The land of the Zaporizhian Army, which constituted most of Novorossiya, became part of Russia in 1686 under the \"eternal peace\" with Poland.\n\nRussian state colonization of Novorossia in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nAtlas of the Russian Empire. 1800 year. Sheet 38. Novorossiysk province of 12 counties\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of Catherine II, in 1770, the so-called Dnieper line was built, which was the result of victories in the Turkish war (the capture of Azov and Taganrog) This line was supposed to separate the entire Novorossiysk province, together with the Zaporizhzhya lands, from the Tatar possessions; from the Dnieper it went to the Sea of ​​Azov, passing along the rivers Berda and Horse Waters, and crossed the entire Crimean steppe. Her last fortress, St. Petra was located near the sea near modern Berdyansk. In total, there were 8 fortresses in this line.\n\nIn 1774, Prince Potemkin was appointed Governor-General of the Novorossiysk Territory, who remained in this position until his death in 1791. He dreamed of turning wild steppes into fertile fields, building cities, factories, factories, and creating a fleet on the Black and Azov Seas. The full implementation of the plans was hindered by the Zaporozhian Sich. After the Russian-Turkish wars, she found herself inside Russian possessions, and the Cossacks no longer had anyone to fight with. However, they owned a vast territory and were unfriendly to the new settlers.\n\nThen Potemkin decided to destroy the Sich. In 1775, General Tekeli was ordered to occupy the Sich and destroy the Zaporozhye army. When the general approached the Zaporozhye capital, at the insistence of the archimandrite, the ataman surrendered, and the Russian troops occupied the Sich without a fight. Most of the Cossacks went to Turkey, others dispersed to the cities of Little Russia and New Russia. Thus ended the history of one city and began the history of many.\n\nThe lands of the Cossacks began to be distributed to private individuals who assumed the obligation to populate them with freemen or serfs. These lands could be received by officials, headquarters and chief officers and foreigners; only single-dvortsy, peasants and landowners were excluded. Thus, large-scale landownership was artificially created in that region, which until now had almost no landowner and serf element. The minimum plot was 1,500 acres of convenient land. The conditions for obtaining land were very favorable: for 10 years, a privilege was given from all duties; during this time, the owners had to populate their plots in such a way that for every 1,500 acres there were 13 households. The size of the plots ranged from 1,500 to 12,000 acres, but there were individuals who managed to get several tens of thousands of acres.\n\nThese lands, after 10 years, could become the property of these persons. After the destruction of the Sich, its entire military and senior treasury was confiscated and the so-called city capital (more than 120 thousand rubles) was formed from it for issuing loans to residents of the Novorossiysk province.\n\nThe accession of the Crimea in 1783 had a huge impact on the successful settlement of the Black Sea steppes. Together with the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas, Russia received access to the sea, and the value of the Novorossiysk Territory increased significantly. Thus, from the 2nd floor. 18th century active colonization of the region begins, which was divided into two types: state and foreign.\n\nOn the initiative of Potemkin, all military fortified lines were built, except for the last one, the Dniester. His main merit lies in the construction of new cities: Kherson, Yekaterinoslav and Nikolaev.\n\nConstruction of cities in the Novorossiysk Territory\n\nKherson. The first city built on the initiative of Prince Potemkin was Kherson. The decree of the empress on its construction dates back to 1778 and was caused by the desire to have a new harbor and shipyard closer to the Black Sea, since the former ones, for example Taganrog, presented significant inconvenience due to shallow water. In 1778, the Empress ordered to finally choose a place for a harbor and a shipyard on the Dnieper and call it Kherson. Potemkin chose the Alexander-Shanz tract.\n\nThe production of works was entrusted to the descendant of the famous Negro and godson of Peter V. Hannibal, 12 companies of craftsmen were given at his disposal. A rather large territory was allocated for the future city, and 220 guns were sent to the fortress. The leadership of this business was entrusted to Potemkin, who wanted to make the city as flourishing and famous as the ancient Tauric Chersonesus. He expected to arrange an admiralty, a warehouse in it - as Peter I did in St. Petersburg. Construction did not cause difficulties: the quarry was located practically in the city itself, timber, iron and all the necessary materials were brought along the Dnieper. Potemkin distributed the lands lying around the city for the construction of country houses, gardens, etc. Two years later, ships with cargo under the Russian flag were already arriving in Kherson.\n\nIndustrialists rushed here from all sides. Foreigners brought commercial houses and offices in Kherson: French trading firms (Baron Antoine and others), as well as Polish (Zablotsky), Austrian (Fabry), Russian (merchant Maslyannikov). Baron Antoine played a very important role in expanding trade relations between the city of Kherson and France. He sent Russian grain bread to Corsica, to various ports of Provence, to Nice, Genoa and Barcelona.\n\nBaron Antoine also compiled a historical outline of trade and maritime relations between the ports of the Black and Mediterranean Seas. Many Marseille and Kherson merchants began to compete with Baron Antoine in trade with southern Russia and Poland through the Black Sea: 20 ships arrived from Kherson to Marseille during the year. Trade was conducted with Smyrna, Livorno, Messina, Marseille and Alexandria.\n\nFaleev was an energetic collaborator of Potemkin. He offered the prince to clear the Dnieper channel at the rapids at his own expense in order to make the river route from the interior regions of the state to Kherson convenient. The goal was not achieved, but, according to Samoilov, already in 1783 barges with iron and cast iron passed directly to Kherson from Bryansk, and ships with provisions also passed safely. For this, Faleev received a gold medal and a diploma for nobility.\n\nMany soldiers worked in Kherson, and shipbuilding also attracted many free workers here, so that the city grew rapidly. Food supplies were brought from Polish and Sloboda Ukraine. At the same time foreign trade began in Kherson. In 1787, Empress Catherine II, together with the Austrian emperor and the Polish king, visited Kherson and was satisfied with the newly acquired land. They carefully prepared for her arrival: they laid new roads, built palaces and even entire villages.\n\nThe city was built very quickly, since Potemkin did not lack material resources. He was granted emergency powers, and the prince disposed of large sums almost uncontrollably. In 1784, by the highest command, an extraordinary amount for that time in the amount of 1,533,000 rubles was released for the Kherson Admiralty. in excess of the amount that was previously issued and released by the state annually.\n\nFor 9 years, Potemkin achieved a lot, but the hopes placed on the new city still did not materialize: with the capture of Ochakov and the construction of Nikolaev, the importance of Kherson as a fortress and admiralty fell, and meanwhile, huge sums were spent on the construction of its fortifications and shipyards . The former admiralty buildings, made of wood, were sold for demolition. The place turned out to be not very successful, trade developed poorly, and soon Kherson lost in this respect to Taganrog and Ochakov. The hope of making the Dnieper navigable at the rapids did not come true, and the plague that broke out at the beginning of the settlement of the city almost ruined the whole thing: the settlers from the central provinces of Russia were sick from the unusual climate and marsh air.\n\nYekaterinoslav(now Dnepropetrovsk). Initially, Yekaterinoslav was built in 1777 on the left bank of the Dnieper, but in 1786 Potemkin issued an order to move the city upstream, since it often suffered from floods in its former place. It was renamed Novomoskovsk, and the new provincial city of Yekaterinoslav was founded on the right bank of the Dnieper in the place of the Zaporozhye village of Polovitsy. According to the project of Potemkin, the new city was supposed to serve the glory of the empress, and its size was assumed to be significant. So, the prince decided to build a magnificent temple, similar to the church of St. Peter in Rome, and dedicate it to the Transfiguration of the Lord, as a sign of how this land was transformed from barren steppes into a favorable human abode.\n\nThe project also included state buildings, a university with a music academy and an academy of arts, a court, made in the Roman style. Large sums (340 thousand rubles) were allocated for the construction of a state-owned factory with cloth and hosiery departments. But of all these grandiose projects, very few came to fruition. The cathedral, university and academies were never built, the factory was soon closed.\n\nPaul I decreed July 20, 1797 ordered to rename Yekaterinoslav to Novorossiysk. In 1802 the former name was returned to the city.\n\nNikolaev. Back in 1784, it was ordered to build a fortress at the confluence of the Ingul with the Bug. In 1787, the Turks of the Ochakovo garrison, according to legend, ravaged the one located on the river. Bug near the confluence of the river. Ingul the dacha of the foreigner Fabry. He asked the treasury to reward him for his losses. In order to calculate the amount of losses, an officer was sent, who reported that there was a place near Fabry's dacha convenient for the shipyard. In 1788, on the orders of Potemkin, barracks and a hospital were built in the small village of Vitovka, and on the river. A shipyard was opened in Ingule.\n\nThe very foundation of the city of Nikolaev dates back to August 27, 1789, since it was on this date that Potemkin's order addressed to Faleev was dated. The city got its name from the name of the first ship of St. Nicholas, built at the shipyard. In 1790, the Supreme Order followed on the establishment of an admiralty and a shipyard in Nikolaev. The Kherson shipyard, despite its convenience, was shallow for ships of high rank, and gradually the control of the Black Sea Fleet was transferred to Nikolaev.\n\nOdessa. The decree of the empress on the construction of a military and merchant harbor and the city of Khadzhibey dates back to 1794, after the death of Potemkin. The construction was entrusted to de Ribas. Under the new city took more than 30 thousand. acres of land, about 2 million rubles were allocated for the construction of a port, admiralty, barracks, etc. An important moment in the original history of Odessa was the settlement of Greek immigrants both in the city itself and in its environs.\n\nIn 1796 there were 2349 inhabitants in Odessa. On September 1, 1798, the coat of arms was presented to the city. Foreign trade was encouraged in Odessa, and soon the city received the status of a free port - duty-free port. It did not last long and was destroyed by a decree of December 21, 1799. By a decree of December 26, 1796, Paul I ordered “The Commission for the construction of southern fortresses and the port of Odessa, located in the former Voznesenskaya province, we order to be abolished; stop the very same buildings. After this decree, at the beginning In 1797, the founder of Odessa and the main producer of the work of the southern fortresses, Vice Admiral de Ribas left the city, and handed over his command to Rear Admiral Pavel Pustoshkin, the former commander of the Nikolaev port.\n\nIn 1800, construction was allowed to continue. To rebuild the harbor, the monarch ordered a loan of 250 thousand rubles to Odessa, sent a special engineer, and presented the city with an exemption from duties and a drinking sale for 14 years. As a result, trade in Odessa greatly revived. In 1800, the turnover of trade barely amounted to 1 million rubles, and in 1802 - already 2,254,000 rubles. .\n\nWith the accession of Alexander I, the inhabitants of Odessa received many important privileges. By a decree of January 24, 1802, Odessa was granted a privilege from taxes for 25 years, freedom from camping troops, a large amount of land was allotted for distribution to residents for gardens and even agricultural dachas, and finally, to complete the harbor and other useful institutions, it was ceded to the city 10- I'm part of the customs fees of it. From now on, Odessa becomes an important trading market and the main port for selling the works of the southwestern part of the empire.\n\nIn 1802, there were already more than 9 thousand people in Odessa, 39 factories, plants and mills, 171 shops, 43 cellars. Further progress in the population and trade in Odessa is associated with the activities of de Richelieu, who took the post of mayor here in 1803. He arranged a port, quarantine, customs, a theater, a hospital, completed the construction of temples, established an educational institution, and increased the population of the city. up to 25 thousand people. Also, thanks to de Richelieu, trade has grown significantly. Being a passionate lover of gardening and tree cultivation in general, he patronized the owners of dachas and gardens in every possible way, and was the first to order from Italy the seeds of white acacia, which luxuriously took root on Odessa soil. Under Richelieu, Odessa became the center of trade relations between the Novorossiysk Territory and European coastal cities: its trade turnover in 1814 amounted to more than 20 million rubles. The main subject of the holiday trade was wheat.\n\nFurther settlement of Novorossiya\n\nIn addition to Kherson, Yekaterinoslav, Nikolaev and Odessa, several more important cities in the Novorossiysk Territory that also arose through colonization can be indicated: these are Mariupol (1780), Rostov, Taganrog, Dubossary. Taganrog (formerly the Trinity Fortress) was built during the reign of Peter I, but was abandoned for a long time and was resumed only in 1769. In the early 80s. it had a harbor, a customs house, an exchange, a fortress. Although its harbor was distinguished by many inconveniences, foreign trade still flourished in it. With the advent of Odessa, Taganrog lost its former importance as the most important trading point. An important role in the economic growth of the cities of the Novorossiysk Territory was played by benefits provided by the government to the population.\n\nIn addition to the construction of fortified lines and cities, the colonization activity of the Russian state and people was expressed even in the foundation of a number of different settlements - villages, villages, settlements, towns, farms. Their inhabitants belonged to the Little Russian and Russian people (not counting foreigners). In the Little Russian colonization, three elements are divided - Zaporizhzhya settlers, immigrants from the Zadneprovskaya (right-bank) Little Russia and immigrants from the left-bank and partly Sloboda Ukraine.\n\nRussian villages were mixed with Little Russian ones. All lands intended for settlement were also divided into state, or state, and private, or landlords. Therefore, the entire Russian population of the Novorossiysk Territory can be divided into two large groups - free settlers who lived on state lands, and owner-occupied, landlord peasants who settled on the lands of private individuals and became dependent on them. Many people from the Hetmanate came to the villages founded by the former Cossacks.\n\nAs for the Russian colonists, they were state and economic peasants, single-palace residents, Cossacks, retired soldiers, sailors, deacons, and schismatics. From the Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Vladimir provinces, state-owned peasants who knew any skill were called. At the beginning of the XIX century. the state settlements were already quite numerous and very crowded.\n\nBy decree of 1781, up to 20,000 economic peasants were ordered to be resettled in Novorossia and up to 24,000 voluntary settlers were selected from among them. However, the first place among Russian settlers was occupied by schismatics. They began to settle in Novorossia as early as the reign of Anna Ioannovna, and even earlier in the Kherson province, near Ananyev and Novomirgorod, which later arose, but their number was small. Much more dissenters appeared in the 50s of the XVIII century, when the government itself summoned them from Poland and Moldavia with manifestos. They were given land in the fortress of St. Elisaveta (Elisavetgrad) and its environs, where they founded a number of villages, distinguished by their population and prosperity.\n\nA special and extremely numerous group among the colonists were fugitives, both Russians and Little Russians. In order to quickly populate the Novorossiysk Territory, the government, one might say, sanctioned the right of asylum here. The local authorities did not disdain criminals either. Prisoners from the Moscow, Kazan, Voronezh and Nizhny Novgorod provinces were sent to Taganrog to settle.\n\nAfter the war with Turkey 1787-1791. Russia received the Ochakiv region between the Bug and the Dniester, which later became the Kherson province. It also needed to be protected by a line of border fortifications. In the Ochakov region, before joining Russia, there were 4 cities - Ochakov, Adzhider (later Ovidiopol), Khadzhibey (Odessa) and Dubossary, about 150 villages inhabited by Tatars and Moldavians and Khan's settlements inhabited by runaway Little Russians. According to a map drawn up around 1790, there were about 20,000 males there.\n\nThe first measures taken by the government to populate the newly acquired Ochakiv region from Turkey were as follows. First of all, Catherine II instructed the governor Kakhovsky to inspect the new territory, divide it into districts, appoint places for cities and present a plan about all this. Then he had to distribute the lands both for state-owned settlements and for landowners, with the obligation to populate these lands and ensure that state-owned settlements did not mix with landowners.\n\nArranging new fortresses in the Novorossiysk Territory, the government had to take care of contingents in case of hostilities. For this purpose, it used ethnographically diverse elements - Russians and foreigners; such were the Cossack regiments located along the fortresses of the Dnieper line, the descendants of the Cossacks - the Black Sea Cossack troops, the Serbs who formed the hussar regiments and other foreign colonists. In the middle of the XVIII century. significant measures were taken to defend the region, but gradually they lost their significance, especially after the annexation of the Crimea.\n\nForeign colonization in the XVIII-XIX centuries.\n\nA characteristic feature of the settlement of the Novorossiysk Territory was the use of foreign colonists, who played an extremely important role. Since in Russia itself at that time the population was not very large, it was decided to resort to the help of foreigners to populate the Novorossiysk Territory. This decision also included the expectation that among the foreigners there might be people with knowledge and skills that the Russian settlers did not have. Apparently, this is why the German holiday of BEER is so popular in the city of Odessa, and there are a lot of cities in Odessa in the world.\n\nThe resettlement began with a decree of December 24, 1751, then a number of decrees were issued on the placement of foreigners in the \"Zadneprsky places\" and on the creation of New Serbia there. On the territory of New Serbia, there were two regiments under the command of Horvath and Pandursky. In 1753, Slavic-Serbia was formed near this settlement, between the Bakhmut and Lugan rivers, where colonists under the command of Shevic and Preradovich settled. Among them were not only Serbs, but also Moldovans, Croats. By that time, the Tatar raids had almost ceased.\n\nAnna Ioannovna also built a number of fortresses on the northern borders of Novorossia, the so-called Ukrainian Line, where almost only soldiers and Cossacks lived since 1731. The central points of the new settlements were Novomirgorod and the fortress of St. Elizabeth in Novoserbia, Bakhmut and Belevskaya fortress in Slavic Serbia. The new settlers were assigned comfortable lands for perpetual and hereditary possession, were given monetary salaries, and were provided with duty-free crafts and trade. However, the Serbian settlements did not justify the hopes placed on them for the colonization of the region.\n\n“Over 10 years, about 2.5 million rubles of state money were spent on the Serbs, and for food they had to take everything they needed from other residents. Serbian settlements were poorly arranged, and between the Serbs themselves there were almost daily quarrels and fights, and knives were often used. The Serbs immediately fell into a bad relationship with their neighbors, the Cossacks.\n\nWith the beginning of the reign of Catherine II, a new era opens in the history of foreign colonization of the Novorossiysk Territory. In a manifesto of 1763, she urged foreigners to settle mainly for the development of our crafts and trade. The most important benefits granted to the new settlers were the following:\n\nthey could receive money for travel expenses from Russian residents abroad and then settle in Russia or in cities, or in separate colonies;\n\nthey were granted freedom of religion;\n\nthey were released for a certain number of years from all taxes and duties;\n\nthey were given free apartments for half a year;\n\nan interest-free loan was issued with its repayment in 10 years for 3 years;\n\nsettled colonies were given their own jurisdiction;\n\nall moths to import property duty-free and for 300 r. goods;\n\neveryone was exempted from military and civil service, and if someone wanted to become a soldier, then in addition to the usual salary, he had to receive 30 rubles;\n\nif someone started a factory that did not exist in Russia before, he could sell the goods he produced duty-free for 10 years;\n\nduty-free fairs and auctions could be opened in the colonies.\n\nLands for settlement were indicated in the Tobolsk, Astrakhan, Orenburg and Belgorod provinces. Although this decree does not say anything about Novorossia, but on its basis, foreigners settled there as well until the beginning of the reign of Emperor Alexander I.\n\nAfter the death of Catherine in 1796, Pavel Petrovich ascended the throne. This is an important era in the history of the Novorossiysk Territory, a time of important events in all parts of the administration. By decree of November 14, Emperor Paul I ordered the Novorossiysk province to be divided into 12 counties:\n\n1. The Yekaterinoslav uyezd was established from the former Yekaterinoslav uyezd and part of the Aleksandrovsky uyezd.\n\n2. Elisavetgradsky - from Elisavetgradsky and parts of Novomirgorodsky and Alexandria counties.\n\n3. Olviopolsky - from parts of Voznesensky, Novomirgorodsky and the region of Bogopolsky district, which was located on the Ochakov steppe.\n\n4. Tiraspol - from Tiraspol and part of Elen (located on the Ochakov steppe) counties.\n\n5. Kherson - from part of Kherson and Voznesensky.\n\n6. Perekop - from Perekop and Dnieper (i.e., the northern part of Crimea) counties.\n\n7. Simferopol - from Simferopol, Evpatoria and Feodosia.\n\n8. Mariupol - from parts of Mariupol, Pavlograd, Novomoskovsk and Melitopol counties.\n\n9. Rostov - from the Rostov district and the land of the Black Sea army.\n\n10. Pavlogradsky - from Pavlogradsky and parts of Novomoskovsky and Slavyansky.\n\n11. Constantinograd - from Constantinograd and parts of Aleksopol and Slavic.\n\n12. Bakhmutsky - from parts of Donetsk, Bakhmut and Pavlograd counties\n\nThe decree of October 8, 1802 put an end to the Novorossiysk province, again dividing it into three: Nikolaev, Yekaterinoslav and Tauride. Also in this decree it was said that the port cities of Odessa, Kherson, Feodosia and Taganrog would be provided with special advantages in favor of trade and, moreover, in each of them, for the patronage of traders, a special chief from the highest state officials would be appointed, who would depend only from the Supreme Power and the Ministers of Justice and the Interior.\n\nUnder Alexander I, foreign colonization within the Novorossiysk Territory begins to be conducted on different conditions. Decree of February 4, 1803: “For military officers who do not have a fortune and wish to start a farm in the empty lands of the Novorossiysk steppe, establish their own property, take it into eternal possession: for headquarters officers 1,000 acres, and chief officers 500 acres of land.” The seat of the main Novorossiysk chief was transferred from Nikolaev to Kherson, and the Nikolaev province itself was renamed Kherson.\n\nIn the manifesto of 20 Feb. 1804, it was said that only such foreigners should be accepted for resettlement who, by their occupations, can serve as a good example for the peasants. For them, it is necessary to allocate special lands - state-owned or bought from landowners; these should be family and wealthy owners engaged in agriculture, cultivation of grapes or silkworms, cattle breeding and rural crafts (shoemaking, blacksmithing, weaving, tailoring, etc.); do not accept other artisans.\n\nNatives were granted freedom of religion and exemption for 10 years from all taxes and duties; after this period, they will be obliged to bear the same obligations as Russian subjects, excluding regular service, military and civil service, from which they were exempted forever. All colonists are given 60 acres of land per family free of charge. On these grounds, it was proposed to settle foreigners in various places in New Russia and in the Crimea. First of all, it was decided to give them land near harbors and ports, so that they could sell their products abroad.\n\nFrom the beginning of 1804, they actively engaged in organizing the life of the nomadic hordes of the Nogai. By decree of April 16, 1804, Alexander I ordered the organization of the hordes and the establishment of a special administration between the Nogais, with the removal of Bayazet Bey. Soon a special administration was established, called the Expedition of the Nogai Hordes. In place of Bayazet Bey, Rosenberg appointed Colonel Trevogin as head of the Nogai hordes.\n\nBy decree of February 25, 1804, Sevastopol was appointed the main military port on the Black Sea and the main part of the fleet. For this, customs was withdrawn from the city and merchant ships could no longer trade in this port. To facilitate overland trade with Western Europe, especially with Austria and other German manufacturing states, transit trade was established in Odessa (decree of March 3, 1804).\n\nThanks to the strong support of the Russian government, the German colonies managed to gain a foothold on new and not always favorable ground for them. In 1845, there were 95,700 of all German settlers in Novorossiya. Romanesque colonization was quite insignificant: one village of Swiss, a few Italians and a few French merchants. Much more important were the Greek settlements. After the Crimea gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, in 1779 many Greek and Armenian families moved out of it (Greeks - 20 thousand).\n\nOn the basis of a letter of commendation, they were given land for settlement in the Azov province, along the coast of the Sea of ​​\\u200b\\u200bAzov. The letter of grant provided them with significant benefits - the exclusive right to fish, government houses, freedom from military service. Some of them died on the way from illness and deprivation, and the rest founded the city of Mariupol and 20 villages in its vicinity. In Odessa, the Greeks also enjoyed significant benefits and were in charge of local trade. Albanians settled in Taganrog, Krech and Yenikol, who were also well off.\n\nTogether with the Greeks, Armenians began to move to Novorossia, and in 1780 they founded the city of Nakhichevan. The beginning of the resettlement of Moldovans dates back to the reign of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna; they became part of Novoserbia in large numbers. Another batch of Moldovans in con. XVIII - early. 19th century founded cities and villages along the river. Dniester - Ovidiopol, New Dubossary, Tiraspol, etc. 75,092 rubles were spent on the transfer of Greeks and Armenians from Crimea. and, in addition, 100 thousand rubles. in the form of compensation \"for the loss of subjects\" received the Crimean Khan, his brothers, beys and murzas.\n\nDuring 1779 - 1780. 144 horses, 33 cows, 612 pairs of oxen, 483 wagons, 102 plows, 1570 quarters of bread were distributed to Greek and Armenian settlers and 5294 houses and barns were built. In total, 24,501 people were dependent on the state out of a total of 30,156 migrants.\n\nIn 1769, the resettlement of Jewish Talmudists from western Russia and Poland to the Novorossiysk Territory began on the basis of a formal permit with the following conditions: they had to build their own dwellings, schools, but had the right to keep distilleries; they were given a benefit from camping and other duties for only a year, they were allowed to hire Russian workers, freely practice their faith, etc. Despite minor benefits, their resettlement in the cities was successful.\n\nThe situation with the organization of Jewish agricultural colonies was quite different. Their beginning dates back only to 1807, when the first batch of Jewish settlers formed colonies in the Kherson district. The government spent huge sums on their arrangement, but the results were deplorable: the agriculture of the Jews developed very poorly, and they themselves aspired to the cities and wanted to engage in petty trade, crafts, and brokerage. From the unaccustomed climate and bad water, epidemic diseases spread among them. Finally, the Gypsies completed the picture of the population of New Russia. In 1768, the total number of inhabitants in Novorossia was 100 thousand people, and in 1823 - 1.5 million people.\n\nThus, in 1776-1782. observed exceptionally high rates of population growth in Novorossiya. For a short period (about 7 years), the population of the region (within the boundaries of the beginning of the 19th century) almost doubled (increased by 79.82%). The main role in this was played by immigrants from neighboring Left-Bank Ukraine. The influx of new settlers from the Right-Bank Ukraine and the Central Black Earth region of Russia was not great. Resettlements from abroad were important only for certain local territories (Aleksandrovsky, Rostov and Kherson districts).\n\nIn the 70s, the northern and central regions of Novorossia were still predominantly settled, and since 1777, the privately owned migration movement came to the fore. During this period, the tsarist authorities did not take effective measures to transfer large groups of migrants from abroad and other regions of the country to Novorossia. They handed out vast tracts of land into the hands of private owners, giving them the right to take care of their settlement themselves. This right was widely used by the landowners of Novorossiya. By hook or by crook, they lured peasants from neighboring Left-Bank and Right-Bank Ukraine to their lands.\n\nBy the Manifesto of June 24, 1811, 4 customs districts were created in the Novorossiysk Territory: Odessa, Dubossary, Feodosia and Taganrog. In 1812, the region consisted of the Kherson, Yekaterinoslav and Tauride provinces, Odessa, Feodosia and Taganrog city administrations. He also owned the Bug and Black Sea Cossack troops and the Odessa and Balaklava Greek battalions.\n\nThe settlement of the developed regions of the country in the 30s of the XIX century. was carried out on the basis of a decree of March 22, 1824. Only on April 8, 1843, new rules on resettlement were approved. Lack of land was recognized as a legitimate reason for the resettlement of peasants, when a peasant family had less than 5 acres of convenient land per revision soul. Gubernias and counties were appointed for settlement, where there were more than 8 acres per revision soul, and in the steppe zone - 15 acres per revision soul.\n\nThe rules somewhat facilitated, in comparison with the regulation of 1824, the conditions for the settlement of settlers. In new places, food was prepared for them for the first time, part of the fields were sown, hay was accumulated to feed the cattle in the first winter, tools and draft animals were prepared. For all these purposes, 20 rubles were allocated for each family. Settlers were exempted from paying money for transportation across rivers and from other similar fees.\n\nThey were supposed to be released from their old places of residence at a convenient time of the year. The rules forbade the return of settlers back from the route or the place of new settlement. For the construction of dwellings, the peasants received forest in new places (100 roots per yard). In addition, they were given 25 rubles for each family irrevocably, and in the absence of a forest - 35 rubles. New settlers received a number of benefits: 6-year-old - from military billeting, 8-year-old - from the payment of taxes and other duties (instead of the previous 3-year-old), and also 3-year - from recruitment duty.\n\nSimultaneously with these benefits, the regulation of 1843 abolished the right that existed until that year for the peasants themselves to choose for themselves suitable places for settlement. Based on these rules, the development of all regions of Russia was carried out in the 40s - 50s of the XIX century. The government, right up to the reform of 1861, tried to introduce Jews to agriculture and spent large sums of money on this.\n\nIn the second half of the 30-40s of the XIX century. Kherson province has lost its position as the leading populated region of Russia. The bulk of the settlers are foreign settlers, Jews and urban taxable estates. The role of the landowner resettlement movement is sharply reduced. Settled, as in earlier periods, mainly southern counties: Tiraspol (with Odessa separated from its composition) and Kherson.\n\nIn the second half of the 30s-40s of the XIX century. the pace of settlement of the Yekaterinoslav province is increasing (due to the sparsely populated Aleksandrovsky district) and it is significantly ahead of the Kherson province. Thus, the Yekaterinoslav province is temporarily turning into the leading populated region of Novorossia, although the value of the latter as the main populated territory of Russia is falling. The settlement of the province is carried out, as before, mainly by legal immigrants. Mainly state peasants and non-taxable categories of the population arrive in the province. The significance of the landlord resettlement of peasants is declining. The Alexandrovsky district is settled mainly, where in 1841-1845. more than 20,000 male souls arrived.\n\nOdessa remained the largest city in Russia, second only to St. Petersburg and Moscow in terms of the number of inhabitants. Among other cities in Russia, only Riga had approximately the same population (60 thousand inhabitants). Nikolaev was also a large city of the country. In addition to the cities mentioned above, in terms of population it was second only to Kiev, Saratov, Voronezh, Astrakhan, Kazan and Tula.\n\nIn the second half of the 30s-40s of the XIX century. the pace of economic development of Novorossia intensified, but the inhabitants of this region were under the influence of the forces of nature. Harvest years alternated with lean years, drought - with locust raids. The number of livestock either increased or decreased sharply as a result of starvation or an epidemic. The population of the region in these years was mainly engaged in cattle breeding.\n\nThus, in the 40s, both agriculture and animal husbandry in Novorossia were on the rise, but in 1848-1849. they were hit hard. The farmers were unable to collect even the sown seeds, and the livestock breeders suffered greatly from the extremely destructive deaths of livestock. Nevertheless, the economy of the region developed, overcoming the effects of climate. Industry in the 1830-1840s had not yet received development, so agriculture remained the main occupation of the region's population.\n\nIn the 50s of the XIX century. The resettlement of the peasantry was carried out on the basis of the provisions of April 8, 1843.\n\nIn 1850, an audit was carried out in Russia, which counted 916,353 souls in Novorossia (435,798 souls in Yekaterinoslav and 462,555 in Kherson province)."
