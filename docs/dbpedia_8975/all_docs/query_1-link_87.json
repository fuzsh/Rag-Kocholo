        "text": "In their memorials before the Grand Chamber in respect of the general situation in eastern Ukraine, the applicant Ukrainian Government pleaded an administrative practice contrary to Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention and Articles 1, 2, and 3 of Protocol No. 1 in the \"relevant parts of Donbass\", committed by the respondent State from March 2014. The purpose of the application was said to be to vindicate the human rights of the victims, to bring the administrative practices to an end and to prevent their recurrence. The complaints were summarised as follows:\n\n\"Article 2 There are numerous reports of unlawful military attacks by Russian forces and their armed proxies against civilians and civilian objects which caused many fatalities. These include the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 on 17 July 2014, and numerous instances where civilians were shot dead on the ground. There are also multiple instances of civilians and Ukrainian soldiers who were prisoners of war or hors de combat being summarily executed, or otherwise tortured or beaten to death.\n\nArticle 3 Reports of the torture of civilians and Ukrainian soldiers who were prisoners of war or otherwise hors de combat have been frequently documented and verified throughout the conflict. These include many instances of sexual violence and rape. There have also been consistent reports that prisoners (particularly civilians) were held by the armed groups in conditions amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment.\n\nArticle 4 There are numerous reports and the statements of the victims that the 'DPR' and 'LPR' Russian proxies use forced labour of the Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians for the digging of the tranches [sic] and other fortifications.\n\nArticle 5 Abductions, kidnapping for ransom, unlawful arrests and lengthy detentions became a key part of the armed groups' methods of conflict. OHCHR and the SMM (OSCE) have recorded countless cases of such detentions. At one point, one of the leaders of the armed groups admitted that his unit alone was detaining more than 600 people. The number and length of time of these unlawful detentions is almost unimaginable, and OHCHR has identified patterns and motivations which make it quite clear that there was a pattern or system in operation, almost from the outset.\n\nArticle 9 Chapter 3 [of the initial memorial] contains reports of a number of instances of deliberate attacks on, and intimidation of, various religious congregations not conforming to the Russian Orthodox tradition.\n\nArticle 10 Throughout the conflict, the armed groups have targeted independent journalists, both from the international and the Ukrainian media. Journalists have been prevented from reporting on 'elections', shot dead, arrested and detained. The armed groups also blocked Ukrainian broadcasters in the areas under their control.\n\nArticle 11 Membership of political organisations supporting Ukrainian territorial integrity was violently suppressed by the armed groups. Those involved in such organisations were targeted for assassination or arrest, and these groups were prevented from meeting or operating in territory under the control of the armed groups.\n\nArticle 1 of Protocol 1 The destruction of private property by Russian forces and their proxies in the local armed groups, including civilian homes and vehicles has been commonplace throughout the conflict. There have also been numerous reported instances of theft and looting of private and commercial property throughout the areas under their control. Large swathes of private property have been unlawfully appropriated without compensation.\n\nArticle 2 of Protocol 1 Numerous schools and educational facilities have been destroyed by the armed groups. Education in the Ukrainian language has been prohibited, and teachers have been harassed, arrested and in some instances killed.\n\nArticle 3 of Protocol 1 The right to free and fair elections in the territory under the control of Russia's paramilitary proxies has been comprehensively disrupted. Local citizens were prevented from voting in the Ukrainian Presidential elections, through acts of intimidation and violence.\n\nArticle 14 Virtually all of the violations alleged in this application were committed because of the ethnicity or perceived political affiliation of the victim. The armed groups systematically attacked civilians of Ukrainian ethnicity, or citizens who supported Ukrainian territorial integrity. That was the motivation behind nearly all of the violations alleged. Nationality and political opinion are relevant characteristics for the purpose of the article 14 analysis, and the relevant comparators are those of Russian ethnicity or pro-Russian political sympathies. It follows that nearly all of the violations of substantive Convention rights alleged in this case, also constitute violations of article 14 because the victims were singled out for attack by reason of a protected characteristic.\"\n\nIn its decision in Ukraine v. Russia (re Crimea) (cited above, § 271), the Court explained that in considering whether an application is lacking the requirements of a genuine allegation, it would take account of the nature of the issues raised before it by the applicant Government. It continued:\n\n\" ... Having regard to the scope of the case as defined above, the Court considers that those issues are indeed legal ones, since the Court is asked to rule on whether in Crimea the respondent State complied with any obligation it may have had under Article 1 to secure the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention (and the Protocols thereto) to everyone within its jurisdiction, provided that such jurisdiction is established. That preliminary issue of whether, at any relevant time, the respondent State exercised jurisdiction over Crimea within the meaning of Article 1 is closely linked to the object of the case as defined above and is likewise of a legal nature.\n\n272. The Court is mindful that these questions inevitably have political aspects. However, that fact alone does not suffice to deprive them of their character as legal questions. Indeed, the Court has never refused to decide a case brought before it merely because it had political implications. Any such implications in the present case cannot deprive the Court of the competence expressly conferred on it under Article 19 of the Convention. Judicial adjudication on those issues is entirely consonant with its competence under that Article to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the respondent State in the Convention and the Protocols thereto.\n\n273. Furthermore, the political nature of any motives which might have inspired the applicant Government to submit the application and the political implications that the Court's ruling might have are of no relevance in the establishment of its jurisdiction to adjudicate the legal issues submitted before it ...\"\n\nHowever, when approaching the question of Article 1x jurisdiction in its recent judgment in Georgia v. Russia (II) (cited above, § 83), the Court drew a distinction between the \"military operations carried out during the active phase of hostilities\" in that case, and the other events which it was required to consider in the context of the international armed conflict under examination. It explained that:\n\n\"125. In the present case the Court is required to examine whether the conditions applied by the Court in its case-law to determine the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by a State may be regarded as fulfilled in respect of military operations carried out during an international armed conflict.\n\n126. In that connection it can be considered from the outset that in the event of military operations – including, for example, armed attacks, bombing or shelling – carried out during an international armed conflict, one cannot generally speak of 'effective control' over an area. The very reality of armed confrontation and fighting between enemy military forces seeking to establish control over an area in a context of chaos means that there is no control over an area. This is also true in the present case, given that the majority of the fighting took place in areas which were previously under Georgian control ...\n\n127. It must therefore be determined in the present case whether there was 'State agent authority and control' over individuals (the direct victims of the alleged violations) in accordance with the Court's case-law, and what the precise scope of those terms is.\n\n...\n\n130. In most of the cases that it has examined since its decision in Banković and Others (cited above), the Court has found that the decisive factor in establishing 'State agent authority and control' over individuals outside the State's borders was the exercise of physical power and control over the persons in question ...\n\n131. Admittedly, in other cases concerning fire aimed by the armed forces/police of the States concerned, the Court has applied the concept of 'State agent authority and control' over individuals to scenarios going beyond physical power and control exercised in the context of arrest or detention ...\n\n132. However, those cases concerned isolated and specific acts involving an element of proximity.\n\n133. By contrast, the active phase of hostilities which the Court is required to examine in the present case in the context of an international armed conflict is very different, as it concerns bombing and artillery shelling by Russian armed forces seeking to put the Georgian army hors de combat and to establish control over areas forming part of Georgia.\n\n134. The Court observes that in Banković and Others (cited above) it found that the wording of Article 1 of the Convention did not accommodate the theory that 'anyone adversely affected by an act imputable to a Contracting State, wherever in the world that act may have been committed or its consequences felt, is thereby \"brought within\" the \"jurisdiction' of that State for the purpose of Article 1 of the Convention' (ibid., § 75). It added that interpreting the concept of jurisdiction in that way was tantamount 'to equat[ing] the determination of whether an individual falls within the jurisdiction of a Contracting State with the question of whether that person can be considered to be a victim of a violation of rights guaranteed by the Convention. These are separate and distinct admissibility conditions, each of which has to be satisfied in the aforementioned order, before an individual can invoke the Convention provisions against a Contracting State' (ibid., § 75 in fine).\n\n...\n\n136. The Court sees no reason to decide otherwise in the present case. The obligation which Article 1 imposes on the Contracting States to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is, as indicated above, closely linked to the notion of 'control', whether it be 'State agent authority and control' over individuals or 'effective control' by a State over a territory.\n\n137. In this connection, the Court attaches decisive weight to the fact that the very reality of armed confrontation and fighting between enemy military forces seeking to establish control over an area in a context of chaos not only means that there is no 'effective control' over an area as indicated above (see paragraph 126), but also excludes any form of 'State agent authority and control' over individuals.\n\n138. The Court therefore considers that the conditions it has applied in its case-law to determine whether there was an exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by a State have not been met in respect of the military operations that it is required to examine in the instant case during the active phase of hostilities in the context of an international armed conflict.\"\n\nThe respondent Government have provided no information as to the whereabouts at the relevant time of the soldiers and military units identified by Ukraine or in the NGO reports. They were quite clearly in a position to investigate at least a selection of the individuals identified and present detailed information to the Court on whether they did indeed fight with the separatists in eastern Ukraine or where they were in fact deployed at the time. The only direct submission on this issue was the assertion that soldiers arrested had crossed the border by mistake (see paragraph 579 above). This single assertion is inadequate to address the detailed allegations made. The respondent Government have not submitted any evidence to refute the applicant Ukrainian Government's account, such as deployment records in relation to the identified military formations, even though such evidence was within their exclusive control and they were specifically invited to provide it. The Court accepts that information about military matters might reasonably be considered sensitive and that its classification for national security purposes is not, in principle, unreasonable. Rule 33 § 2 of the Rules of Court caters for this consideration since it allows public access to a document or to any part of it to be restricted. It would, moreover, have been possible for the respondent Government to remove sensitive passages in documents or submit a summary of the relevant passages omitting sensitive information. Indeed, in Georgia v. Russia (II), cited above, §§ 345-46, the Grand Chamber concluded that the respondent Government had fallen short of their obligation to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court in its task of establishing the facts of the case, as required under Article 38 of the Convention, because they had refused to submit combat reports on the grounds that the documents in question constituted a \"State secret\", despite the practical arrangements proposed by the Court to submit non-confidential extracts. The Grand Chamber further observed that the respondent Government had not submitted any practical proposals of their own to the Court that would have allowed them to satisfy their obligation to cooperate while preserving the secret nature of certain items of information.\n\n1. Dismisses, unanimously, the respondent Government's objection that the applications lack the requirements of a genuine allegation under Article 33 of the Convention;\n\n2. Holds, unanimously, that the complaints by the applicant Ukrainian Government concerning events which took place in the territory under separatist control from 11 May 2014 fall within the jurisdiction ratione loci of the respondent State within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention and dismisses the respondent Government's objection in this respect;\n\n3. Joins to the merits, by a majority, the objection raised by the respondent Government as to whether the applicant Ukrainian Government's complaints of administrative practices of shelling in violation of Article 2 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, together with associated Article 14 complaints, fall within the Article 1 jurisdiction of the respondent State;\n\n4. Holds, by a majority, that the complaints by the applicant Dutch Government concerning the downing of flight MH17 fall within the jurisdiction ratione loci of the respondent State within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention and dismisses the respondent Government's objection in this respect;\n\n5. Holds, unanimously, that the complaints concerning armed conflict fall within the ratione materiae jurisdiction of the Court and dismisses the objection of the respondent Government in this respect;\n\n6. Declares, unanimously, inadmissible the complaint of the applicant Ukrainian Government under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as outside the ratione materiae jurisdiction of the Court;\n\n7. Declares, unanimously, that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is not applicable to the allegations of the existence of administrative practices and accordingly dismisses the respondent Government's objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of the complaints concerned;\n\n8.
