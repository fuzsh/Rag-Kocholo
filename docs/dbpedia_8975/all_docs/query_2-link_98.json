        "text": "A sovereign and independent Ukraine\n\nonly appeared on world and European maps fairly recently, after the\n\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union. No one in Europe had prepared\n\nthe event and no one was prepared for it. No one understood the\n\nnature of the Ukrainian nation either. The Europeans did not have\n\nany experts on Ukraine or even Ukrainian translators, although the\n\nsame is true for Kazakhstan, Belarus and Moldavia. The West only\n\nhad Sovietologists, Kremlinologists and Russia specialists.\n\nEuropeans could much better understand the independence of smaller\n\ncountries like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and even Armenia and\n\nGeorgia. Ukraine suddenly became the biggest European country in\n\nterms of territory. It had a smaller population than Germany,\n\nFrance, Britain and Italy, but larger than Spain or Poland. Yet it\n\nwas way behind Europe in terms of economic might, living standards\n\nand the maturity of national consciousness. As far back as in the\n\nmid 1990s, several European foundations sent researchers to Ukraine\n\nto produce a clearer picture of the past, present and future of the\n\nnew neighbor, which had sprung up so unexpectedly. The research\n\nproved to be immensely complicated as the results of polls differed\n\ntremendously in Kiev and Odessa, Kharkov and Sevastopol, Lvov in\n\nthe country’s west and Donetsk in the east. The problem was that\n\nthe differences affected basic values of national history and\n\nreligion, as well as Ukraine’s relations with Russia and Western\n\ncountries.\n\nYet the West did not have any special\n\ninterest in Ukraine: there was a general decline in attention\n\ntoward anything related to Russia and the former Soviet Union in\n\nthe 1990s. The number of university students studying Russian\n\ndropped by dozens of percent, and only a few showed interest in\n\nstudying Ukrainian, Georgian or Kazakh. Interest in Ukraine\n\nskyrocketed all of a sudden only during the ‘orange revolution’ in\n\nNovember and December 2004. That event propelled the names of Yulia\n\nTymoshenko and Victor Yushchenko to worldwide acclaim. When\n\nYushchenko addressed a joint session of both houses of the U.S.\n\nCongress as the newly elected Ukrainian president, U.S.\n\nrepresentatives and senators welcomed him as a hero, with more than\n\na hundred of them lining up to shake hands with him.\n\nHowever, later developments puzzled and\n\ndisappointed Western political analysts and policymakers. Over the\n\npast year, the Western mass media dropped virtually any comments on\n\nwhat was happening in Ukraine. Russian newspapers, too, drastically\n\ncut their Ukrainian coverage. The Ukrainian equation has proven to\n\nbe overly complex due to the presence of many unknown elements in\n\nit.\n\nThe authoritarian regimes of the former\n\nSoviet Union and the Russian Empire had many more drawbacks, apart\n\nfrom checks on openness, but while they shackled progressive\n\nprocesses, they also weeded out the seeds of discord scattered\n\naround the Imperial lands. As the Soviet Union disintegrated, those\n\nseeds sprouted out in the South Caucasus, North Caucasus, Central\n\nAsia, and Ukraine. The latter avoided an armed conflict, but the\n\nacute contradictions that surfaced in Ukrainian society continue to\n\nthreaten its stability and are slowing down the country’s\n\ndevelopment.\n\nTHE UKRAINIAN JIGSAW\n\nUkrainian President Victor Yushchenko\n\nmade a critical address to the nation when he called for unity\n\nbetween Left-Bank Ukraine and Right-Bank Ukraine. At the same time,\n\nPrime Minister Victor Yanukovich promised to build a policy taking\n\naccount of “Ukraine’s three cultural and economic spaces – the\n\nEuropean, Eurasian and Mediterranean.” Former President Leonid\n\nKuchma had claimed that Ukraine has twelve clearly shaped and\n\ndistinct historical regions – the Sloboda region, Polesia, the\n\nMiddle Sub-Dnieper region, the Dnieper Rapids region, the Donets\n\nBasin, Podolia, the Black Sea Littoral Area, the Crimea, Volyn,\n\nGalicia, Transcarpathia (known as Subcarpathia in the West – Ed.)\n\nand Bukovina (Leonid Kuchma. Ukraine Is Not Russia: A Return Into\n\nHistory, Moscow, 2003, p. 19. – Russ. Ed.).\n\nI personally see no grounds to disagree\n\nwith Kuchma on this classification, yet as a historian I would put\n\nthese regions in a different order and specify the different paths\n\nthat they followed over the past thousand years.\n\nThe historical destinies of Galicia, as\n\nwell as neighboring Transcarpathia and Bukovina, are very specific.\n\nThese parts of western Ukraine were the least affected by the\n\nTatar-Mongol invasion compared with the other principalities of\n\nKievan Rus. In later centuries, they were regions of the Grand\n\nDuchy of Lithuania, Rzeczpospolita, Hungary, and Austria-Hungary.\n\nThey were never subordinate to the Russian Empire and during World\n\nWar I conscripts were drafted there to fight in the\n\nAustro-Hungarian army, not the Russian army. The Treaty of\n\nVersailles split these lands among three countries – Poland,\n\nRomania and Czechoslovakia. They were incorporated into Soviet\n\nUkraine de facto only after 1945. The people in these regions have\n\nalways felt a strong influence from the Roman Catholic Church, but\n\nboth the Polish Kingdom and the Hapsburg monarchy regarded them as\n\nprovinces. People in Galicia did not know anything about Alexander\n\nPushkin, yet equally enough they knew nothing about Taras\n\nShevchenko, the prominent nineteenth-century Ukrainian poet. Thus,\n\nthe nationalist idea that budded there at the end of the 19th\n\ncentury was centered on obtaining autonomy for Ukraine within the\n\nAustro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nThe Sloboda region (whose name is\n\nderived from the Russian word ‘sloboda’ – a non-serf settlement of\n\npeasants and/or craftsmen) is historically a part of Russia. The\n\nborder separating the Russian state and Rzecz Pospolita at the\n\nbeginning of the 17th century was far to the west of the modern\n\ncities of Izyum, Kharkov, Sumy and Rylsk. This underdeveloped area\n\nattracted peasants from Rzeczpospolita, who were fleeing\n\noppression, as well as fugitive Russians. Russian servicemen\n\nsettled there, as well as Cossacks from Ukraine who had lost\n\nbattles to Polish troops. The Russian government would deploy the\n\nnew Cossack regiments there that would make up the Belgorod defense\n\nline protecting Moscow from incursions by the Crimean Tatar khans.\n\nKharkov, founded in 1656, developed as a Russian city. After the\n\nBolshevik revolution of 1917, it was the industrially advanced\n\nKharkov that became the first capital of Soviet Ukraine. It\n\nremained the capital until 1934. According to a census taken in\n\n1989, ethnic Russians accounted for up to 30 percent of the\n\npopulation in the Sloboda region of Ukraine. Ukrainians made up\n\nanother 65 percent, but most of them spoke Russian as their native\n\nlanguage.\n\nFrom the historical, ethnic and\n\ncultural point of view, Ukraine’s foundation was formed out of\n\nthree historical regions that were officially called Malorossia\n\n(Little Russia) in the Russian Empire. Today this area encompasses\n\nthe City of Kiev, the Zaporozhye, Zhitomir, Vinnitsa, Kiev and\n\nKirovograd regions on the right bank of the Dnieper, and also the\n\nChernigov and Poltava regions on the river’s left bank. The Russian\n\nclassical novelist Nikolai Gogol, the linguist and ethnographer\n\nVladimir Dahl, as well as numerous other Russian and Ukrainian\n\nwriters devoted their writings to Malorossia. The word was included\n\nin the full title of the Russian emperors.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, hetman Bogdan\n\nKhmelnitsky led a national revolt for the liberalization of the\n\nUkrainian people in this region. By 1650, the three districts had\n\nsingled themselves out of the whole territory and had formed a\n\nstate ruled according to the habits and traditions of Cossack life.\n\nIn 1654, when these lands joined Russia, their aggregate territory\n\nwas even smaller than it was originally. The areas that can be\n\ncalled Bogdan Khmelnitsky’s Ukraine went over to Russia only after\n\nthe Andrusov Treaty of 1667 and the so-called ‘treaty of eternal\n\npeace.’ As a nation and state, Ukraine took shape around this\n\ncentral territory. Only a part of Malorossia was integrated into\n\nthe Malorossian General Governorship. Soviet-era historiography\n\ndiscarded the term Malorossia as capitalist and nationalistic,\n\nwhile today’s nationalists condemn it as an asset of “Russian\n\nimperialism.” The common people did not reject it, however, and\n\neven Zaporozhye Cossacks mention “our Malorossian fatherland” in\n\ntheir documents. Ukrainian publicist Leonid Berest said: “Yes, we\n\nare Malorossians, Little Russians. The so-called national democrats\n\nhate the word bitterly. But what’s so bad about it? It was here in\n\nKiev, in Malorossia, that Rus, which was destined to become Great\n\nRussia, took its origins. Malorossia is called this way because it\n\nis the original Russia. Contrary to the fantasies of our\n\nnationalists tormented by the inferiority complex, the name does\n\nnot humiliate anyone.” (2000 weekly, October 6, 2006, p.\n\nF3).\n\nNovorossia, which incorporates the\n\nregions of the Black Sea northern littoral area, is another large\n\nand very special part of the country. Most of the territory lies\n\nwithin the so-called ‘Wild Field’ zone of southern steppes, from\n\nwhere the Crimean Tatars and Turks made incursions into Russia and\n\nRzeczpospolita. Russia acquired this area under peace agreements\n\nsigned with Turkey in 1739, 1774, 1791 and 1812. One of the first\n\ncities founded by Catherine II in the area was Yekaterinoslav\n\n(currently Dnepropetrovsk). It was meant to become the capital of\n\nthe entire new territory, but its actual development only began in\n\nthe 19th century when railways and industrial facilities were built\n\nthere. At the same time, the coastal cities of Kherson, Nikolayev\n\nand Odessa developed at a fair pace. The resettlement of people to\n\nNovorossia only began after its annexation to Russia, with a\n\npopulation made up of Ukrainians, Russians, Greeks, Jews,\n\nBulgarians and Germans. Nationalistic ideas have never been very\n\npopular in Novorossia. As journalist from Odessa said, his hometown\n\nis “a commercial center, where the majority of people consider\n\nmoney to be the matter of primary, secondary and tertiary\n\nimportance. This is the way it has always been there, even during\n\nthe Soviet era. Odessites may hold the Ukrainian state in\n\ndisrepute, but they will never be so desperate and irrational as to\n\ninstigate any sort of revolution against it.” (Russia and Ukraine,\n\nMoscow, 1997, p. 240).\n\nThe Donets Basin (Donbass) plays a huge\n\nrole in Ukraine’s current political and economic life. Development\n\nthere began much later than in other parts of the country. Coal\n\ndeposits were discovered there as early as at the beginning of the\n\n19th century, yet the production of coal only began after the\n\nCrimean War, when the first railway lines were built. The discovery\n\nof giant iron ore deposits in Krivoy Rog gave a huge impetus to the\n\nregion’s development. Coal production in Donbass stood at around 25\n\nmillion tons a year in 1913 and iron production was around 3\n\nmillion tons. The region turned into an “all-Union steamshop”\n\nduring the Soviet era. Ethnic Russians and native Russian speakers\n\ndominated its population. Even after the Soviet Union’s\n\ndisintegration, Miners’ Day is still a major holiday there. The\n\nDonetsk and Lugansk regions have a combined population of 8\n\nmillion, making them the most densely populated regions in Ukraine\n\nand they have the biggest concentration of the working class in the\n\npost-Soviet Union.\n\nThe Crimea stands apart from all other\n\nareas of the country. Its formal integration into the Russian\n\nEmpire took place in 1783 and the city of Sebastopol (Sevastopol)\n\nwas founded the same year. Soon after that the Crimea became part\n\nof the Tauride province, with its capital in Simferopol. Throughout\n\nthe 19th century, the authorities conducted a policy of pressuring\n\nthe indigenous Tatar population to leave for Turkey. Tatar\n\nemigration to the Ottoman Empire reached its peak during the\n\nCrimean War from 1853-1856 and afterwards. To replace the Tatars in\n\nthe Crimea, the czarist Russian authorities resettled Russian and\n\nUkrainian farmers, German and French colonists, Jews, Bulgarians\n\nand Greeks. The southern coast of the peninsula soon turned into a\n\nseaside resort for the Russian aristocracy and wealthy people. A\n\nterritory known as the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\n\nemerged as a region of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist\n\nRepublic (RSFSR) at the end of 1921. Its entire population was a\n\nmere 720,000 at the time, including about 144,000 Tatars. It is\n\nwell known that the Tatars were deported from the region in 1944.\n\nBy the end of the Soviet era, the Crimea had a population of 2\n\nmillion, 67 percent of which were Russians and 26 percent were\n\nUkrainians. The Tatars began to return to the peninsula after the\n\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union. Their number has now reached\n\n250,000, but they do not have a clear legal status. The Crimea has\n\nagain become an autonomy – this time inside Ukraine, to which it\n\nwas administratively subordinated in 1954.\n\nREGIONAL DIVERGENCES IN THE UKRAINIAN\n\nECONOMY\n\nThroughout the 19th and the 20th\n\ncenturies, the Ukrainian economy was built as an element of the\n\noverall Russian imperial or Soviet economic system, and that is why\n\nhorizontal links between Ukrainian regions were rather weak. The\n\nbulk of resources and heavy industries were located in the\n\ncountry’s east – in the Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye, Kharkov and\n\nDnepropetrovsk regions. As a whole, these regions make up the\n\nIndustrialized East. Ukrainian national capitalism, represented by\n\nthe Donetsk clan and the Dnepropetrovsk clan, took shape there\n\nafter the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The capital Kiev and\n\nthe central regions around it do not have a precise economic\n\nspecialization, boasting a variety of industries and a developed\n\nagricultural sector. The economy of the Black Sea littoral zone has\n\nalways been determined by its closeness to the sea. It is a very\n\ngood area for developing seaside resorts and international\n\ntourism.\n\nThe western zone is the most\n\neconomically backward part of the country. Even the agricultural\n\nsector there is less productive than in central or eastern Ukraine.\n\nSix western regions – Volyn, Lvov, Transcarpathia, Chernovtsy,\n\nTernopol and Rovno – only accounted for six percent of the nation’s\n\ntotal industrial output in the period from 2000-2005. Foreign\n\ninvestment has practically bypassed western Ukraine.\n\nHOW MANY ORTHODOX DENOMINATIONS DOES\n\nUKRAINE HAVE?\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine had only one canonical\n\ndenomination of Eastern Orthodoxy – the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\n\nwhich reported to the Moscow Patriarchate. A non-canonical\n\ndenomination, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church that was\n\nset up in 1927, but which was outlawed in the Soviet Union,\n\nre-emerged by its side in 1989-1990. It has parishes in western\n\nUkraine and in Belarus today. A new split in Ukrainian Orthodoxy\n\noccurred at the very end of 1991 under pressure from Leonid\n\nKravchuk, the first president of an independent Ukraine, and at the\n\ninitiative of Metropolitan Philaretos, as a non-canonical Ukrainian\n\nOrthodox Church reporting to the Kiev Patriarchate. It took away\n\nabout 30 percent of all Orthodox parishes. Philaretos was issued an\n\nanathema in Moscow and excommunicated from the Church, but he was\n\ndeclared a patriarch in Kiev.\n\nPresident Victor Yushchenko believes\n\nUkraine has one more denomination of Orthodoxy – the Greek Catholic\n\nChurch (its disciples are otherwise known as Catholics of the\n\nEastern Rite – Ed.) that has a vast presence in western regions.\n\nThis Church came into being in 1596 under strong pressure from\n\nRoman Catholics and the Polish authorities. It kept the Eastern\n\nOrthodox rites and the Old Church Slavonic language, customary for\n\nbelievers in Eastern Europe, but assimilated Catholic dogmas and\n\ndefected to the jurisdiction of the Holy See. Following the\n\nSoviet-era ban on its activity, it rose up in the early 1990s and\n\ndemanded a return of all the church buildings that had been taken\n\naway from it. Leonid Kuchma, then the newly-elected president,\n\nseemed lost and did not know what to do about it. “The summaries of\n\nincidents that I found on my desk every morning resembled\n\nbattlefield reports,” he wrote about it later. “This battle\n\ninvolved more than a thousand parishes. Priests’ houses were set\n\nablaze, and crowds assaulted and seized church buildings and even\n\nwhole villages. I got an impression at times that this was a war\n\nwhere everyone fought against everyone else, although each fighter\n\nknew perfectly well who his foes were. The continuing struggle for\n\nchurches and parishes turned into a big stumbling block in\n\nrelations between Kiev and Moscow.” (Leonid Kuchma. Ukraine Is Not\n\nRussia: A Return Into History, Moscow, 2003, p. 481. – Russ.\n\nEd.).\n\nThese splits, which have still not been\n\nfully eliminated, weakened the Orthodox Church and the Christian\n\nfaith in general to the degree that after the mayoral election of\n\n2006, businessman Leonid Chernovitsky, a member of the Embassy of\n\nGod sect, became Mayor of Kiev. The sect appeared in Nigeria and\n\nits father superior, senior pastor Sunday Adelaja, moved to Kiev\n\nafter that. The city’s Orthodox community was appalled by the fact\n\nthat a sect of some sort would have power in a city where the Grand\n\nDuke Vladimir baptized Great Rus in 988. A campaign is underway in\n\nKiev to replace Chernovitsky through a referendum.\n\nLANGUAGE WARS\n\nThe lands of Kievan Rus and,\n\nsubsequently, all principalities which were ruled by princes\n\ndescending from the Rurik dynasty and which had Orthodox churches,\n\nhad a common language. It was used in the first ballads and\n\nchronicles, and the first literary work of Kievan Rus, The Lay of\n\nIgor’s Campaign, was also written in it. The formation of the\n\nGolden Horde and Rzeczpospolita, and pressure from German orders\n\nand the Ottoman Empire, left dramatic imprints on the fate of the\n\nEastern Slavs. However, sometime in the 16th century they would\n\nperceive themselves – and would be perceived by others – as a\n\nsingle nation with a common faith, a common language and common\n\nliterature. Monasteries and churches were the centers of writing\n\nand knowledge at the time, and the authors of handwritten books,\n\ncopyists and readers identified them as Russian centers. The first\n\nRussian printer, Ivan Fyodorov, began working in Moscow in 1564 and\n\nthen continued in Lvov where he printed, apart from a new edition\n\nof the Acts of the Apostles, the first Russian ABC book. The\n\nMogilyansky Academy in Kiev, set up in 1631 by Metropolitan Peter\n\nMogila, played an important role in the promotion of Russian\n\nliterature and writing. It was the first institution of higher\n\nlearning in Malorossia and reported to Kiev’s Cave Monastery. In\n\nthe 17th and 18th centuries it was probably the largest education\n\ncenter in what is now Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.\n\nUndoubtedly, differences appeared in\n\nthe spoken and written language over time, yet these were\n\ndifferences between dialects of one language, not separate, fully\n\ndeveloped languages. The first attempts of writing literature in\n\nthe Ukrainian language were only made in the early 19th century,\n\nand all encyclopedias point out a play by the playwright Ivan\n\nKotlyarevsky called Natalka-Poltava, which was staged in 1819.\n\nVassily Gogol, the father of Russian writer Nikolai Gogol, also\n\nwrote vaudevilles and poetry in Ukrainian to attract audiences in\n\nthe town of Poltava. His son, who had much more expansive\n\nambitions, wrote on Ukrainian topics, but in the Imperial Russian\n\nlanguage from the very start. He dreamed of a literary career and\n\nof seeing his books become popular all over Russia. One of the\n\npillars of Ukrainian poetry, Taras Shevchenko, came from a serf\n\nfamily. He excelled as a painter and was bought out of serfdom by a\n\ngroup of Russian painters. He started writing poems and ballads in\n\nUkrainian, thus laying the foundations for the contemporary\n\nliterary Ukrainian language. However, he was still not able to\n\ncompletely break out of the realm of the Russian language and wrote\n\nhis diaries, novels and stories in Russian.\n\nAll public schools in Malorossia only\n\ntaught in the Russian language in the 19th century. The authorities\n\nof the Russian Empire would persistently turn down demands from\n\nUkrainian democrats to allow the use of their native tongue in the\n\neducation system. It was only in the early 20th century that the\n\nRussian Academy endorsed a decision to recognize Ukrainian\n\n(‘Malorossian’ as it was called then) as a separate language and\n\nnot a dialect of Russian, as had been officially declared before.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin’s government ignored the\n\ndecision.\n\nThe first schools to teach in Ukrainian\n\nappeared during the Russian Civil War (1918-1921). This innovation\n\nwas supported by nationalists and Bolsheviks alike. There was an\n\nintensive development of Ukrainian public schools and language in\n\nthe 1920s, and one of the would-be closest aides of Joseph Stalin,\n\nLazar Kaganovich, did much to bolster this process. In 1930,\n\nschools that used Ukrainian as the main language of instruction\n\naccounted for 85 percent of the school system. The waves of\n\n‘Russification’ and ‘Ukrainization’ alternated over the next\n\nseveral decades in parallel with the change of leaders. But Russian\n\nstill dominated on the streets of Ukrainian cities. In 1989, the\n\nSupreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic came up\n\nwith a constitutional amendment that declared Ukrainian the only\n\nstate language on the republic’s territory. The decision produced\n\nnumerous practical problems in the work of organizations of the\n\nthen ruling Soviet Communist Party and state agencies in the last\n\ntwo years of Soviet history.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union was gone, the\n\nlanguage conflict grew to a degree that prompted observers to speak\n\nof a linguistic war. The acuteness of the situation was aggravated\n\nby coercive measures on the part of the government. As an\n\nindependent Ukrainian state was formed, Ukrainization became a\n\nsegment of the official government policy conducted by the\n\ncountry’s first president Leonid Kravchuk. The same policy\n\ncontinued during the presidency of Leonid Kuchma, although he was\n\nless active in that sphere.\n\nThere is no need to recount the details\n\nof the hasty Ukrainization of the 1990s. The policy bumped into one\n\nmishap after another. The progress of openness, freedom of the\n\npress, a market economy, the general IT revolution, globalization,\n\nand freedom of travel created a booming use of Russian rather than\n\nUkrainian in a most paradoxical way. The Russian language was much\n\nmore convenient and instrumental in business, since 75 percent of\n\nUkraine’s population were fluent Russian speakers versus 60 percent\n\nwho were fluent speakers of Ukrainian. Most businessmen preferred\n\nto advertise in Russian. Nationalists pressured the authorities\n\ninto passing a law that banned advertising in unofficial languages.\n\nThis was an anti-market legal act, since a market economy with its\n\ncompetitive environment must squeeze out weak players. The problem\n\nis that newspapers, books, magazines, television series and other\n\nmass media products are also assets of a market economy. During the\n\nSoviet era, each town and district could publish newspapers in both\n\nRussian and Ukrainian and regulate their circulation. But as market\n\nrelations set in, the number of Ukrainian newspapers in circulation\n\nhad fallen 80 percent by 2000 from 1990, while the number of\n\nRussian-language magazines and newspapers had considerably grown.\n\nThe situation with the printing and sale of books was the same.\n\nThis situation on the free media market caused panic among radical\n\nnationalists. The poet Pavlo Movchan, a member of parliament\n\nrepresenting the nationalistic movement Rukh, told Voice of Russia\n\nradio that “the Russian language and Russian culture are more\n\npowerful than missiles.” “The situation in Ukraine demonstrates\n\nthat the Russians are victors even without a war. Nothing is being\n\ndone today to put Ukrainian into a dominant position, into the\n\nposition of an official language, which it is under the\n\nConstitution.”\n\nThe government forcibly reduced the\n\nnumber of schools that taught in Russian. Their number can be\n\ncounted on two hands today in western Ukraine. Only five such\n\nschools were left in Kiev by 2004. A huge number of schools were\n\neven closed in eastern Ukraine, where native speakers of Russian\n\nmake up most of the population. This policy has had a telling\n\nimpact on the overall literacy of the youth who do not know either\n\nRussian or Ukrainian properly. Attempts to change documents at\n\nindustrial facilities and research institutes into Ukrainian have\n\nalso been a disaster. And can anyone actually gain anything from\n\nmaking lecturers teach surgery in Odessa or space study in\n\nDnepropetrovsk in Ukrainian instead of Russian?\n\nThe ‘orange revolution’ pushed the\n\nlanguage conflict even deeper into the quagmire. A decision was\n\nmade in 2005 to impose Ukrainian on all agencies of law and order\n\nand the judiciary. It also prohibited students trying to enter\n\nuniversity to write their entrance exams in Russian even if they\n\nhad been educated in Russian. The government attempted to introduce\n\nquotas for imports of Russian books, thus running into a problem\n\nwith the European Charter for Minority and Regional Languages that\n\nhad been ratified by the very same parliament and had gone into\n\neffect on January 1, 2006. Regional and city councils in Donetsk,\n\nKharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, Sevastopol, Lugansk, Odessa and many other\n\nplaces used the Charter as a basis for adopting regional laws\n\ndeclaring Russian as an official language and giving it equal\n\nstatus on their territories with Ukrainian. Changes in the\n\ngovernment in August 2006 have scaled down the acuteness of the\n\nlanguage problem, but this conflict, which deals a blow to Ukraine\n\nas a country, is far from over.\n\nUKRAINE’S HISTORY REVISITED\n\nUkraine’s history intertwines with the\n\nhistory of other countries – Lithuania, Poland, Austria, Hungary\n\nand Russia, among others, – and this gives endless headaches to\n\nUkrainian historians. Unlike many neighboring nations, the\n\nUkrainians proved unable to establish their own state in the Middle\n\nAges or in later periods. The Ukrainian nation did not have its own\n\nkings or princes or patrimonial aristocracy. It never waged wars in\n\nEurope, minted its own coins, set up parliaments or wrote laws.\n\nDifferent parts of the nation lived through their history in\n\ntotally different ways, in different countries and amid differing\n\nsystems of values. So, can the situation call forth the creation of\n\na national history, “integral and transparent in everyone’s eyes” –\n\nsomething that President Yushchenko demands? To do this,\n\nmythologizing and even outright falsifications come in\n\nhandy.\n\nOne of the bluntest myths suggests that\n\nthe Ukrainian nation began to form in the 6th-7th centuries rather\n\nthan in the 16th-17th centuries. This leads to the conclusion that\n\nthe history of Kievan Rus belongs entirely to Ukraine and is its\n\n‘golden age,’ that Kiev is not a common cradle for the Ukrainian,\n\nRussian and Belarusian nations. The nationalistic movement Rukh was\n\nextremely displeased with the unveiling of a monument to Kievan\n\nduke Yaroslav the Wise in the Russian city of Yaroslavl on the\n\nVolga in 1993 and, in particular, by Boris Yeltsin’s presence at\n\nthe ceremony. The nationalists discerned an anti-Ukrainian intrigue\n\nin it. “He was our prince, not yours.”\n\nThe Ukrainian 5-hryvnia bill depicts\n\nthe portrait of hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky and the 10-hryvnia bill\n\nportrays hetman Ivan Mazepa. Official Ukrainian historiography\n\nproclaims both men as heroes. No doubt, Mazepa betrayed Russia and\n\nTsar Peter the Great who had supported his ascent to the hetmanate,\n\nbut historians allege he did not betray Ukraine. He presumably\n\nsought to create an independent Ukraine, which exonerates him of\n\nany guilt in the nation’s conscience. However, Russian historians\n\nhave not changed their views of Mazepa.\n\nNew ideas about Ukrainian history say\n\nnothing about the destiny of the Ukrainian people during their\n\nalmost 260-year-long association with the Russian Empire. Next in\n\nline in textbooks after hetman Mazepa is Simon Petlyura, who helped\n\nestablish the Directorate of Ukraine in 1918 and then presided over\n\nit. German troops pulled out of Kiev after Germany’s capitulation\n\nin World War I. Hetman P. Skoropadsky fled the city together with\n\nthe Germans. Petlyura entered Kiev with a small army on December\n\n14, 1918. The Directorate tried to pool together the hastily formed\n\nUkrainian People’s Republic and the West-Ukrainian People’s\n\nRepublic that arose out of the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian\n\nEmpire. An act on their unification and on creating a “free state”\n\nwas signed on January 22, 1919. Since 1990, Ukraine has celebrated\n\nthis date by a variety of gala events as “Community Day,” although\n\nno real Ukrainian national state was set up in 1919. The\n\nDirectorate held out for several months. Once it was driven out of\n\nKiev by the Red Army, it fell under the crushing blows of the army\n\nof pro-monarchist General Anton Denikin, who was fighting the\n\nBolsheviks. Petlyura fled to France, where he was killed on a\n\nstreet by a young Jewish watchmaker. The killer said that he had\n\ndone away with Petlyura in an act of revenge for all the Jews who\n\nhad fallen during pogroms in Ukraine. However, after examining the\n\nmaterials of the case, a French court found the young man not\n\nguilty.\n\nOne more horrifying page in history\n\nthat Ukraine’s neo-nationalists itch to bring up again is the\n\nfamine in the winter of 1932-1933 in which millions died. That\n\nfamine was the product of Stalin’s criminal policies, not any kind\n\nof drought, and it spread throughout all the grain regions of the\n\nSoviet Union, including Kazakhstan, the Volga area, the basins of\n\nthe Don and Kuban rivers, and Ukraine. But Ukrainian historians\n\nseek to magnify the impact of the famine in 1933, disastrous as it\n\nwas by itself. They pass it off as an act of genocide, as a\n\ncampaign targeted precisely at the Ukrainian nation. They also\n\ndescribe Stalin’s rule as “the regime of Russian Communism.”\n\nHowever, such interpretations of that calamitous event have\n\nabsolutely no grounds.\n\nProbably the most painful heritage that\n\nthe 20th century left to Ukrainian historians and politicians is\n\nthe activity and fate of Stepan Bandera and the Organization of\n\nUkrainian Nationalists (OUN) that was set up with his active aid\n\nand later turned into the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). OUN was\n\nhammered together by young Ukrainian émigré radicals in\n\n1929 and its headquarters opened in Berlin in 1934, which naturally\n\nmeans it cooperated with the National Socialist Party and the\n\nGestapo. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941,\n\nOUN combat units marched in the footsteps of the Nazi armies. OUN\n\nproclaimed on June 30, 1941 in Lvov that the Ukrainian People’s\n\nRepublic had been restored – “in cooperation with the National\n\nSocialist Great Germany” and its Fuehrer Adolph Hitler. The Germans\n\ndid not recognize that act, however, and arrested Bandera, who\n\nspent the rest of the war in jail on the Eastern front. His\n\nassociates set up the UPA in 1942 and gave command over it to Roman\n\nShukhevich. UPA units did not conduct any operations against the\n\nGerman occupation, though. The period of its combat action falls in\n\nthe years from 1944-1947 when it fought against units of the Soviet\n\nArmy and security services. Various Ukrainian military and police\n\nformations also took part in punitive actions against the Jews and\n\nPoles. Bandera was killed in West Germany by a KGB agent. The\n\nsecret services carried out the assassination.\n\nVictor Yushchenko submitted a bill to\n\nthe Verkhovna Rada on several occasions from 2004-2006 to recognize\n\nthe OUN/UPA as a party of war, which would automatically put the\n\nformer militants on a par with Soviet veterans of World War II. The\n\nbill was never endorsed, but in spite of this, the OUN/UPA is still\n\ntrying to organize parades, manifestations and “military patriotic\n\ngames.” It has a huge influence in western Ukraine.\n\nA GEOPOLITICAL IMPASSE\n\nUkraine only has two big neighbors\n\ntoday – the European Union in the west and the Russian Federation\n\nin the north and east. Russia is moving toward integration with\n\nBelarus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in the format of the Eurasian\n\nEconomic Community (Eurasec) and is expanding its ties within the\n\nShanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Even a large country like\n\nUkraine cannot develop successfully in today’s world if it does not\n\nmake a strategic integration choice. Ukraine has not made any such\n\nchoice however, and now it finds itself at a geopolitical\n\nimpasse.\n\nThe willingness of the majority of\n\nUkrainian politicians to move along the road toward European\n\nintegration is easy to understand, but after absorbing twelve new\n\ncountries over the past three years, the EU should take a long\n\nbreak now to carry out complicated and costly procedures of\n\nbridging the gap between Eastern and Western Europe. Turkey, a\n\ncountry with a population of 70 million, has been next in line to\n\njoin the EU since 1963. It has made great achievements toward\n\nintegration already, to say nothing of being an official candidate\n\nfor joining since 1987. It is believed that Turkey will eventually\n\nget EU membership in 15 years. Only after that will the EU be able\n\nto accept an application from Ukraine. At this time, it is neither\n\nan associated member nor a candidate country, and nobody has\n\npromised anything to it. Ukraine has not fully formed as a state\n\nentity or a nation yet. Its economy is not self-sufficient even in\n\nthe smallest degree. It has close economic relationship with Russia\n\nand other former Soviet republics, but not with the West. There are\n\nno obstacles to Ukraine’s development in the direction of the CIS,\n\nsince the transition mechanism of the Common Economic Space is\n\nalready in place. And yet Ukraine has stopped halfway, thus sinking\n\ndeeper and deeper into geopolitical isolation.\n\nThis geopolitical impasse has had\n\nserious repercussions for Ukraine’s economy. Projects slated for\n\nthe long term are being frustrated. There are problems with imports\n\nof Ukrainian products. Since Ukraine was not a Russian colony, the\n\ntwo economies developed as parts of an integral economic unit for\n\nover 300 years. One cannot simply take a scalpel and cut off the\n\nterritorial, economic, cultural, historical and religious life of\n\nUkraine from a common economic, cultural and information space that\n\nstill exists and then attach it to the European Union, the eastern\n\npart of which is still in formation. This kind of surgery might end\n\nup in death due to loss of blood.\n\nThe West would\n\nundoubtedly be unenthusiastic about a broadening of ties between\n\nRussia and Ukraine. The Western preferences were quite obvious\n\nduring the ‘orange revolution.’ But the West is not ready to pay\n\nfor all the excesses of Ukraine’s westward drift. As European\n\nCommission President Jose Manuel Barroso summarized the difficult\n\ntalks on Ukraine’s accession, he said in plain terms that the\n\naccession – so much desired by the Ukrainians – was not acceptable\n\nfor the EU. When asked about the reasons for such a position,\n\nBarroso said with a note of irritation it was because Ukraine was\n\nnot ready, in the first place, and the EU was not ready, in the\n\nsecond. German political expert and economist Conrad Schuller wrote\n\nin commenting on this situation in Die Frankfurter Allgemeine\n\nZeitung on October 31, 2006 that Ukraine urgently needs prospects\n\nin the West if it wants to continue developing in the same\n\ndirection and does not wish to feel Russia’s iron grip sooner or\n\nlater. Something should be done immediately so that the territory\n\nfrom Galicia to the Donets coal fields with its huge pipelines\n\npumping Russian and Central Asian oil and gas to Europe is not\n\nlost, Schuller claimed. He indicated that if Ukraine cannot aspire\n\nto a place in the Brussels condominium, it should at least be\n\nadmitted to a welcoming arrivals lounge where it could wait for ten\n\nto twenty years while the doors for it are kept open. The\n\nFinancial Times said on October 13, 2006: “We need only one\n\nthing… to know and to feel through written agreements that there\n\nare prospects for Ukraine in Europe, so that we can see the\n\nhorizon.” While Yushchenko is obviously ready to wait for fifteen\n\nor twenty years, Pyotr Talanchuk, the director of the Open\n\nInternational University of Human Development will wait for thirty\n\nor even fifty years. “We won’t get away from the EU anyhow,” he\n\nsaid. (Zerkalo Nedeli, Kiev, November 30, 2004). But do the people\n\nof Ukraine agree with a prospect like that?\n\nTHE UKRAINIAN EQUATION\n\nWhat we said above makes it clear that divisions\n\ninside Ukrainian society are deep, they are spreading in different\n\ndirections and intricately crossing one another. Ukrainian citizens\n\ndo not want to speak the same language, they go to churches of\n\ndifferent jurisdictions even within the same denomination, they\n\ndiverge in the assessment of their own historical events and differ\n\nin the estimation of current politicians and public figures, as\n\nwell as the politicians who lived fifty, one hundred, two hundred,\n\nfive hundred, or even one thousand years ago. People living in\n\ndifferent parts of the country do not have a feeling of being\n\nmembers of one nation with a single system of cultural and national\n\nvalues. Nonetheless, the vast majority of them would like Ukraine\n\nto keep its sovereignty and independence. None of the reciprocally\n\nbickering regions would like to join Poland, Romania, Hungary,\n\nTurkey or Russia again – the countries they used to be integrated\n\ninto seventy, one hundred or four hundred years ago. This situation\n\nis undermining Ukraine’s development, complicating peoples’ lives,\n\ngenerating risks, obstructing the normal functioning of political\n\ninstitutions, and bringing about frequent changes of the powers\n\nthat be and ruling elites. For an observer, the pace of affairs in\n\nUkraine is an equation that has many more known elements than\n\nunknown ones. But what is the way to solve the equation and can it\n\nbe solved at all?\n\nOne of the suggestions on how to do this shows up in\n\nthe mass media more often than others. It is to turn Ukraine into a\n\nfederation. There are many proponents of federalization. They cite\n\nnumerous arguments to substantiate their proposals. One of the most\n\npopular and sober politicians, Yevgeny Kushnaryov, who died fairly\n\nrecently, wrote that “federalism provides the only way out for\n\nUkraine now.” “If we don’t assimilate the principles that will\n\nunderlie the European philosophy of state administration in some\n\nthirty years’ time, we will lag behind others irreparably, in which\n\ncase the economic, social and political losses will really be\n\ngreat.” (2000, April 14, 2006, p. B2). Kushnaryov proposed\n\nbeginning the federalization process in three to five regions first\n\nand then spreading it to the entire country in fifteen to twenty\n\nyears from now.\n\nSelf-styled federalization is already in progress.\n\nThe weakness and instability of the government in Kiev simply\n\ncompels the local authorities to take charge of resolving the most\n\npressing problems. But formal federalization requires impressive\n\nchanges to the Constitution, and this does not seem possible given\n\nthe current alignment of political forces in Ukraine. Since world\n\npractice does not offer a common model for a federation, Ukraine\n\nmust design one on its own. There is no way to do it by commanding\n\nand administering. First, one must unite the country somehow and\n\nlook for ways of rational federalization only after that.\n\nEfforts to unite Ukraine around the ideology of\n\nUkrainian ethnic nationalism have proven futile. That the ethnic\n\nidea does not work was recognized during the presidency of Leonid\n\nKuchma. The complete fiasco of the ideas of Rukh was quite obvious\n\nway back in the 1990s. The phenomenon of Victor Yushchenko, who\n\ntried to give nationalism a new lease of life, rests on support\n\ngained from external forces, first and foremost, and also on\n\nsupport given to Yulia Tymoshenko’s populist movement that\n\nharvested votes in the cities and districts where an overt ethnic\n\nnationalism would not have had any chances otherwise. But today\n\nYushchenko’s star is fading, and odious personalities like Borys\n\nTarasyuk or Petro Lutsenko are dropping out of the political\n\nscene."
