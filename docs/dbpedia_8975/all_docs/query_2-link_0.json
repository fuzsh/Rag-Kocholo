        "text": "Oblast (region) of Ukraine\n\nOblast in Ukraine\n\nKirovohrad Oblast (Ukrainian: Кіровоградська область, romanized: Kirovohradska oblast), also known as Kirovohradshchyna (Ukrainian: Кіровоградщина), is an oblast (region) in central Ukraine. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Kropyvnytskyi. Its population is 903,712 (2022 estimate).[2] It is Ukraine's second least populated oblast, behind Chernivtsi.\n\nIn 2019, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine approved the change of the oblast's name to Kropyvnytskyi Oblast (Ukrainian: Кропивницька область, romanized: Kropyvnytska oblast, unofficially Kropyvnychchyna (Ukrainian: Кропивниччина)).[4] The change is not yet implemented. The largest cities of the region are Kropyvnytskyi, Oleksandriia, Znamianka and Svitlovodsk.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area of the province is 24,600 square kilometres (9,500 sq mi).\n\nThe city of Dobrovelychkivka is the geographical center of Ukraine.\n\nMost of the region is located within historic Right-bank Ukraine and Zaporizhzhia, and the western outskirts are part of historic Podolia.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Kherson Governorate\n\nThe lands of the modern Kirovohrad Oblast were first inhabited by Scythians.[5][6] In the Middle Ages, during the time of Kyivan Rus', the East Slavic tribe of Ulichis lived here.[7] After the liberation of the former Kyivan Rus' from the Tatars in the Battle of Blue Waters and the unification of the principalities of Kyiv, Pereyaslav, and Chernihiv with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,[8][9] there was a need to protect the southeastern borders from attacks by the Crimean Khanate and Moscovy - states that were formed after the collapse of the Golden Horde at the end of the 15th century. For this, Dmytro Vyshnevetsky founded the first Zaporozhian Sich on the island of Khortytsia, thus the Ukrainian Cossacs appeared.[10] On the territory of the modern Kirovohrad region the Zaporozhians founded many villages. From 1569, the territory formed of the Kingdom of Poland within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThese lands were under the rule of the Ukrainian Cossacks of Hetmanate and Zaporozhian Sich from XV to XVIII century.[11]\n\nAs a result of the destruction of Ukrainian Cossacks and the enslavement of Ukrainians by the Russian government at the end of the 18th century, these lands came under the direct power of Russia.[12][13] In 1752, the territory of New Serbia was founded with the capital in Novomyrhorod.\n\nIn the 1800s, majority of the landed was owned by the noble Skarżyński family.[14] They played a large role in the development of the region. An emphasis was placed on the development of its agriculture and the Skarzynskis opened a school in Migeya dedicated to this.[15]\n\nThe oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian SSR on January 10, 1939 out of the northern raions of Mykolaiv Oblast. Before establishment, its territory was part of Kherson Governorate (most of it) and Podolia Governorate (smaller portion) until 1925. Earlier before occupation of Ukraine in 1920s, in 1918 there were plans to introduce own Ukrainian administrative territorial division with territory of modern Kirovohrad Oblast being split between lands of Nyz (Lower land), Pobozhia (Boh land), and Cherkasy.\n\nDuring the Soviet repressions, over 40,000 residents of the region were killed.[16][17][18] [19]\n\nIn 1954, the oblast lost some raions to the newly created Cherkasy Oblast, but later that year received its western raions from the Odesa Oblast.\n\nBetween 1939 and 2016, the oblast administrative center, Kropyvnytskyi, was called Kirovohrad and was named after the First Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Sergei Kirov.[20] Due to decommunization laws (on 14 July 2016) the name of the city was changed to Kropyvnytskyi.[20] Kirovohrad Oblast was not renamed because as such it is mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine, and the Oblast can only be renamed by a constitutional amendment by the Verkhovna Rada.[21]\n\nOn 20 June 2018, the Committee on State Building, Regional Policy and Local Self-Government of the Ukrainian parliament backed the proposal to rename Kirovohrad Oblast to Kropyvnytskyi Oblast.[22] In February 2019, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine declared constitutional the bill on renaming Kirovohrad Oblast to Kropyvnytskyi Oblast.[23][24] The renaming was supported by the local Oblast Council in March 2021.[25][26] The process then stalled in the parliament, with the oblast council asking the Verkhovna Rada to speed up the process in September 2022.[27]\n\nPoints of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine:\n\nKhutir Nadiia, outskirts of Mykolaivka village\n\nThe oblast also has a number of archaeological sites, such as Nebelivka site and Melgunov Kurgan.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nKirovohrad Oblast As of January 1, 2022 Number of districts (райони) 4 Number of hromadas (громади) 49\n\nRaions No. Name Coat of arms Population,\n\n(2020).

Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix \"-shchyna\", as is the case with the Kirovohrad Oblast, Kirovohradshchyna.\n\nSee also: Romanization of Ukrainian\n\nFacts\n\n[edit]\n\nBerestuvate Lake in the Black Forest near the Znamianka is one of the top 7 mystical places of Ukraine [29]\n\nIt was in the territory of the modern Kirovohrad Oblast that Semen Klymovsky, the author of a famous folk song \"The Cossack Rode beyond the Danube\" died [30]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nHospital in Novomyrhorod\n\nFormer hospital in Nova Praha\n\nKhutir Nadiia museum\n\nCathedral of Nativity of Mary in Kropyvnytskyi\n\nTheater in Oleksandriia\n\nNear Inhul River\n\nPanski Hory landscape reserve\n\nConfluence of Berezivka and Inhul rivers\n\nBlack Forest\n\nMemorial to Semen Klymovsky in the village of Moshoryne\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAdministrative divisions of Ukraine\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
