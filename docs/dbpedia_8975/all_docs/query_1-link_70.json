Objective facts have been losing their key role in politics and decision-making, causing an overwhelming proliferation of fake news and public opinion manipulation. Western countries have only now realized how vulnerable they are to post-truth, but Ukraine first started feeling it in the spring of 2014, when, after the victory of the Euromaidan Revolution, the Kremlin launched its massive propaganda campaign. Seeking to undermine Ukrainian statehood, both on the domestic (Ukrainian) and international level, Russian agitprop has been targeting every potential audience, from housewives to key decision makers. After three years of war, against all odds, Ukrainian society has learned how to confront Russia’s propaganda aggression through numerous initiatives aimed against the policy of post-truth. We believe that Ukraine’s first-hand experience can be useful to other countries and communities that are just becoming aware of the new threats and challenges. Ukraine has been countering Russian hybrid aggression in the Donbas and Crimea for three years. Our research aims to offer an introductory lecture for journalists, analysts, diplomats and experts trying to comprehend the situation in the East of Ukraine, the region’s geographic and sociopolitical features, external and internal causes and stages of the war. We also want to steer you away from the models, stereotypes, and simplifications that often appear in the media. It is especially important for us to illustrate to our readers the hybrid nature of the military and propaganda aggression by the Kremlin, and outline the ways to counter it. We would like to thank the InformNapalm volunteer community for providing source material for this research. We are also deeply grateful to the experts and journalists, who helped us with valuable ideas and advice during our work. Foreword. When the Truth Is the Best Weapon\n\n6.

They have many common features and are often joined under the name “Donbas”. The word “Donbas” is an abbreviation of two words: “Donetsky Bassein” (“Donets coal basin”). This term was first introduced in the 1820s by Yevgraf Kovalevskyi, a mining engineer, to mark the coal deposits in the basin of the Siverskyi Donets river. The Donets coal basin is of a considerable length – over 500 kilometers from the Dnipro to the Don. The total area of the geological Donbas is approximately 60 thousand square kilometers, which is 13 times the area of the Ruhr coal basin. It spreads over parts of the current Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk Oblasts of Ukraine, as well as a part of Rostov Oblast of Russia. TheheavyindustryoftheDonbaswasthefactorthatdeterminedtheregion’sadministrativeboundaries. Donetsk Governorate established in 1920 combined most of the industrial cities of the region. For the purposes of improving food provision to the workers of the Donbas, the territories of Pryazovia (the Sea of Azov area) and Slobozhanshchyna (Sloboda Ukraine), which were then mostly agrarian, were included in Donetsk Governorate. Lengthy reorganizations in the territories belonging to Donetsk Governorate eventually resulted in the appearance of the current Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Industrial complexes of the coal basin are the core of these regions. Even the names of some cities speak about the mining industry: Shakhtarsk (City of Miners), Antratsyt (Anthracite), Vuglegirsk (Coal Mountain), Vugledar (Gift of Coal), Girnyk (Miner). For that reason, “Donbas” is used as a synonym for Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts combined. However, many find this generalization objectionable. First, the borders of the oblasts do not match the borders of the coal basin. Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast and Starobilsk in Luhansk Oblast do not belong to the Donbas, while Pavlograd in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Shakhty in Rostov Oblast do. Second, in view of the armed conflict in the East of Ukraine, many Ukrainians speak against assigning any political meaning to the term “Donbas”. Despite these considerations, we proceed from the Chapter 1. Donbas - the Panoramic Picture\n\n8. 8 Donbas In Flames established tradition and the practical convenience of calling the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts the Donbas. At the same time, we recognize the logic of alternative approaches. The east of Ukraine is mostly flat steppe country crisscrossed with river ravines, the largest being the Siverskyi Donets. In Luhansk Oblast, the Donets became the separation line between the troops of the Anti-Terrorist Operation and the militants. Another feature of the terrain in the region is the Donets Ridge – a series of hills rising up to 200-300 meters above sea level. The strategic height Savur-Mohyla also belongs to the Donets Ridge. The typical landscapes in the industrial areas include spoil banks.

The land border between these oblasts and Russia is 923.24 kilometers long, out of which 409.3 kilometers (44.3%) are currently under the control of the militants of the DPR and the LPR. Additionally, Donetsk Oblast has access to the Sea of Azov, where the sea border between Ukraine and Russia presents its own problems. One of the peculiarities of the land border between Ukraine and Russia is that it mostly lacks any natural barriers, such as large rivers or mountains. It stretches through mostly empty fields and grasslands. Until 2014, the eastern border was rather poorly equipped, because the Ukrainian-Russian border inherited not the outer border of the USSR (a state border with proper equipment) but its internal\n\n9. 9 Chapter 1. Donbas - the Panoramic Picture GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE (inter-republican) administrative border. Its demarcation began only in 2010. This factor facilitated illegal crossings into Ukraine from Russia. DonetskandLuhanskOblastsareconnectedtoeachotherandtotherestofUkraineaswellastoRussia with a network of highways and railways. The most important roads in the region are international highways М03, М04, М14, reaching the state border of Ukraine, as well as national roads, particularly, roads H20 and H21. Control over these roads (or parts of them) was essential for both sides of the armed standoff in 2014. ««The greatest dangers faced by a person in the Donbas are those associated with roads... Anastasia Bereza, journalist Population breakdown by the municipality type (source: State Statistics Service of Ukraine, 2013) Donetsk Oblast Luhansk Oblast cities with over 100,000 population cities with over 100,000 population 4 375 442 2 256 55145 553 047 Ukraine Donetsk Mariupol Makiivka Horlivka Kramatorsk Sloviansk Luhansk Alchevsk Sievierodonetsk Lysychansk 31,1% rural 68,9% towns 90,6% towns 13,2% rural 86,8% towns 9,4% rural\n\n10. 10 Donbas In Flames Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts hold an important place among the 27 regions of Ukraine. Together they cover approximately 9% of the territory of the country, at the same time being the most densely populated and urbanized area. Before the war, approximately 16% of the total population of Ukraine lived in these two oblasts. Donetsk Oblast is first in Ukraine in the number of cities – there are 52 of them. Luhansk Oblast is in third place with 37 cities (after Lviv Oblast). Together the two Donbas oblasts contain almost 20% of all the cities of Ukraine. Most of them are in the center of dense urban areas, which developed around heavy industry enterprises. The high level of urbanization in the central parts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts also had its influence on the pattern of the hostilities. At the early stages of the standoff, the militants managed to establish control over the large cities. Storming such cities would have required special training, which the Ukrainian army lacked. The Ukrainian command did not dare to directly attack the militants’ locations in densely populated residential areas, as it meant the risk of numerous casualties among the civilians and the troops. As the result, most of the urban areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts remained under the control of the DPR and the LPR. In 2015, the Ukrainian parliament passed the act entitled “On the condemnation of the Communist and National-Socialist (Nazi) regimes, and prohibition of propaganda of their symbols”. It required the cities, raions (subdivisions of oblasts), and oblasts that used communist symbols in their names to be renamed. Through 2016, in accordance with this law, 987 cities and 25 raions were renamed. Of those, 166 cities and 8 raions are in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, including 78 cities and 3 raions in the occupied territories of the Donbas. The self-proclaimed DPR and LPR do not accept these changes and continue using the old names. Further in this text, we will specify the names of the cities that have been renamed in the form “new name / old name”. The detailed list of the renamed cities and raions of the Donbas is provided in the appendix. As Seen by Analysts and Journalists The Donbas as a whole is a subject that is covered from different standpoints. Journalists planning their trips to the zone of the military conflict should be especially careful about the words they are using. The words, together with the accompanying videos or photos, set the perceptions of this standoff. In order to comprehend the Donbas conflict, one has to take into account its characteristics that have been used by unbiased analysts, experts and researchers. It is essential to be able to distinguish well- reasoned statements from propagandist clichés. The analysis below covers about 100 scientific texts by Ukrainian researchers in the social and humanitarian area that use the term “Donbas”. These texts fall under two categories: those created before the conflict and those prepared during its rise. The words frequently used in these texts are included in the Top 100 list. Together they form the basis of the content and, to a certain extent, help to understand the Donbas.\n\n11. 11 Chapter 1. Donbas - the Panoramic Picture GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE Top 100 words about the Donbas in Ukrainian publications before the war Top 100 words about the Donbas in Ukrainian publications after the beginning of the war\n\n12. 12 Donbas In Flames For example, from the Top 100 one can conclude that the region has been and still is regarded as a part of Ukraine. The regional specifics are often emphasized in the context of the difficult social and economic conditions as well as the strong attraction to the Soviet past. At the same time, if previously the Donbas was mostly described in relatively positive terms (formation, modernization, improvement, encouragement, investment, reconstruction, urbanization), since 2014 the region is mostly associated with problems of integration, safety, reclamation, overcoming, reconciliation, relocation, demarcation, and improvement of living conditions. Participants of the anti-government protests near the seized SBU building in Luhansk. One of the persons has “USSR” shaved on his head. April 9, 2014. Photo by Taras Shumeyko. Comprehensive studies of the Donbas could not predict the events happening today. Before the conflict, the region had been referred to as the center of labor, industry, life, education, market relations, traditions, creativity. These terms disappear from the Top 100 after 2014, while the analytical vocabulary acquires such new Donbas-related terms as “military conflict”, “(in)security”, “external aggression”, “casualties”, “uncontrolled territories”, “annexation”, “separatism”, “geopolitics”, “occupation”, “scenario”. In pre-war Ukraine, the Donbas was generally described as a relatively prosperous and influential region of Ukraine with marked social and economic tendencies. Since the beginning of the war, these impressions have changed sharply. Now the region is analyzed primarily as the territory of the Russian- Ukrainian conflict and geopolitical standoff, a serious challenge for the national sovereignty of Ukraine.\n\n13. 13 Chapter 1. Donbas - the Panoramic Picture GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE By 2014, the expert community identified “Donbas” as a distinct socio-cultural trend; however, now we see only traces of the related associations, a vague image quickly losing its past attractiveness. In the end, every person visiting the Donbas will most probably find their definition of this region of Ukraine. We gathered the region-related statements, which were suggested by Ukrainian and foreign experts, researchers, columnists, politicians, journalists, artists at various times and in various contexts. So, for our purposes, the Donbas is: ѠѠ its history embodies ... freedom, militancy, violence, terror, independence (Hiroaki Kuromiya) ѠѠ colonized steppe borderlands (Aleksandr Kaufman, Dmytro Bahaliy, et al) ѠѠ a land of “mass assimilation” and “intellectual genocide” (Oleksa Tykhyi) ѠѠ an integral part of Ukraine, “the land of the Ukrainian word” (Ivan Dziuba) ѠѠ russified mining towns and Ukrainian traditional villages (Vasyl Holoborodko) ѠѠ “feudal land” of “local lords”, oligarchs; a regional business clan (Ella Libanova, Denys Kazantsev, Roman Ofitsynskyi, et al) ѠѠ “lumpenized land” using blackmail as a weapon (Oles Honchar) ѠѠ social expanse of poverty (Liliya Lebid) ѠѠ an old industrial region with signs of “necro-industrialism” (Yevhen Shybalo) ѠѠ a part of the “rust belt” (Sergii Plokhiy, Anders Aslund, et al) ѠѠ a frontier region, a contact border, a borderland (Yaroslava Vermenych, Oleksandr Osipian et al) ѠѠ a pole of the Ukrainian regional system, one of the “two Ukraines” – the opposite of Galicia (Mykola Ryabchuk et al) ѠѠ the Donets Ridge is a territory inhabited by residents with “traumatized consciousness of a Soviet person” (Oksana Mikheyeva) ѠѠ a region of “strong industry, advanced technologies (here and there) and old idols (everywhere) (Yevhen Sytnyk) ѠѠ a region of mythologized history (Andrew Wilson) ѠѠ a region of “darkened places, anomalous time zones” (Serhiy Zhadan) ѠѠ a land of regional patriotism (Kostyantyn Paustovskyi) ѠѠ miners’ culture (Marta Studenna-Skrukva) ѠѠ “international frontline” (Vladimir Kornilov) ѠѠ “holy land”, part of the “single space of the Holy Russia” (Vladimir Gundyayev) ѠѠ cultural synthesis of Ukraine and Russia (Illya Kononov) ѠѠ a non-homogeneous region – active and expectant, creative and common, dreamy and nostalgic, aggressive and abused (Vira Dodonova) ѠѠ an unstable region of radicalized worker movements (Charles Wynn) ѠѠ “the land of dreams” (Viktor Marushchenko)\n\n14. 14 Donbas In Flames Donbas (Un)Known to the World Using the word “Donbas” and its spelling variations as the search terms in Google Trends, it is possible to make certain conclusions about the international interest towards the region. The infographics shows that in March, May, and August 2014 and February 2015, Google users’ interest towards the Donbas increased significantly, albeit with certain oscillations – up to its historical maximum of the period from 2004 to 2017. By the frequency of sources of the queries, Ukraine is followed by Poland, Italy, Germany, Russia, Spain, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and USA. However, starting from March, 2015, this interest gradually diminishes.

In general, it is easy to see that the first successful steps towards forming a positive international image of the Donbas were made with the development\n\n15. 15 Chapter 1. Donbas - the Panoramic Picture GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE of the sports infrastructure during the independency of Ukraine. Donetsk hosted matches of the UEFA Champions League in 2004/2005 and 2006/2007, the Euro-2009 (U-19) youth football championship, the Bannikov international football tournament, and the 2005 Davis Cup tournament, the 2013 World Youth Championships in Athletics, and other international sports events. The opening of the Donbas Arena – the first stadium in the Eastern Europe designed to the “five star” category standards, the best stadium of Euro-2012, the winner of the Safety & Security Award at the 2013 Stadium Business Awards – attracted, as anticipated, wide public attention. Now the stadium that on the day of its opening hosted almost 50,000 visitors from all over the world has been badly damaged.

Nowadays, Google search users are more likely to make Donbas-related queries on other issues: war in the east of Ukraine, Syria, Petro Poroshenko, Donbas militia, pro-Russian movement in Ukraine, the Crimean peninsula, Russia, Novorossia, Islamic State, Vladimir Putin, Debaltseve, war in Donbas, news Donbas, save Donbas, Ukraine war, Donbas map, Donbas people, Donbas facebook, battalion Donbas, Islamic state of Donbas, and others. At the same time, the following queries still maintain certain popularity: Donetsk territory, Donbas Arena stadium, Donbas hockey club, Shakhtar football club, Donbas Palace Hotel, European football championship of 2012, Industrial Union of Donbass, DonbassAero airlines, and others.\n\n16. 16 Donbas In Flames Donbas Arena, the stadium opened in the center of Donetsk in 2009 in preparation to Euro-2012.

The Donbas continued to depend on the old Soviet industry, which hadn’t been reformed, hadn’t been modernized, but had been privatized. And this state of affairs, of course, led to the increased role of clans and criminal gangs and to the rise of a completely unique mentality [...] It was absolutely clear that this area would be marginalized and it would be used by certain groups to establish their dominance. In these industrial areas a certain group of “lords” always appears, who keep the local population not just in subservience, but in ideological subservience, and people begin to believe that this is the model that is best suited to preserve “stability”. Vitaly Portnikov, political columnist\n\n17. 17 Chapter 2. Could the War Be Avoided? GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE Ukrainian land Up to the second half of the 18th century, what is now Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts remained sparsely populated. The steppes to the north of the Sea of ​​Azov were the stage of the frequent clashes between Zaporozhian, Sloboda, and Don Cossacks on the one side, and Turkic nomads of the Crimean Khanate on the other. Victorious campaigns of the Russian Empire ended the domination of the Ottoman Empire along the northern coast of the Black Sea. This area ceased to be a dangerous borderland, finally becoming a part of Russia. Streams of colonists flowed to the Donbas from Crimea, the Balkans, the Caucasus, central regions of Russia, and Western Europe. But the majority of the settlers were Ukrainians from neighboring territories. Ukrainians immediately became the dominant ethnic group in the region, which was evidenced by fiscal lists of the population in the 18th and 19th centuries, and later by the first general Census of the Russian Empire in 1897. In the 19th century, ethnographers also confirmed the Ukrainian character of the Donbas. Since there were no separate Ukrainian administrative structures in the Russian Empire similar to the Kingdom of Poland or the Grand Duchy of Finland, the only way to determine Ukraine’s borders was to identify the territories inhabited by the Ukrainian people. Metaphorically the Ukrainian territory was defined by Pavlo Chubynsky in a poem - now the national anthem of Ukraine – “Ukraine has not yet died”, written in 1862, as “From San to Don”. The suggestion of the Don River as the eastern national border implied the inclusion of the Donbas in the area settled by Ukrainians. The more detailed picture of eastern Ukrainian territories was offered by ethnographic maps of the 19th century. The pragmatic approach dictated the need to take into account the existing administrative boundaries of the provinces of Russia, where the majority of population was Ukrainian. This was the program that was presented by the Ukrainian national movement after the overthrow of the Russian monarchy in February 1917. The territories of the modern Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts mostly belonged to the eastern outskirts of the Ekaterinoslav and Kharkiv Governorates. Since they were mostly inhabited by Ukrainians, they were to be included in the Ukrainian autonomy. Chapter 2. Could the War Be Avoided?\n\n18. 18 Donbas In Flames On November 20, 1917, the Ukrainian Central Rada adopted the Third Universal which proclaimed the Ukrainian National Republic (UNR), consisting of nine governorates, including Ekaterinoslav and Kharkiv. In the future, the border territories, where Ukrainians were the majority population, were anticipated to join the UNR. For example, at the time, the south-eastern outskirts of the modern Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts were a part of Taganrog District of the Don Host. According to the 1897 census, Ukrainians accounted for 61.7% of its population. The Bolshevik leadership of Russia and its head Vladimir Lenin de facto recognized Ukraine within the Third Universal. However, the Bolsheviks immediately began an armed fight to seize power in the UNR. With the help of the Russian Red Army, the Soviet government was established in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (UkrSSR), proclaimed by the Bolsheviks, claimed the same territory as the UNR. Thus, the issue of the administrative Ukrainian-Russian border was to be resolved between the Ukrainian and Russian Soviet Republics.

Could the War Be Avoided? GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE Lenin’s administration in Moscow did not question that parts of the Donbas within Ekaterinoslav and Kharkiv Governorates belonged to Ukraine. On February 25, 1919, the leaders of Soviet Ukraine and Russia confirmed the appropriate border line in a joint decision. In reality, Russia and Ukraine were governed from the same center, so the issue of the border between the two Soviet republics was seen as an academic question. After the defeat of the troops of General Denikin, the Bolsheviks finally asserted their authority over the Donbas. On April 16, 1920, to accelerate the post-war reconstruction, they combined the whole industrial region within a newly formed Donetsk Governorate. It included the eastern parts of the Ekaterinoslav and Kharkiv Governorates, as well as the part of the Donbas that before the revolution belonged to the Don Host. The new governorate became a part of the UkrSSR, so the territory of Ukraine increased significantly taking in parts of the Don land. In August 1920, Stanytsia Luhanska was added to the Donetsk Governorate. These were the borders of UkrSSR as it joined the Soviet Union. In addition to industrial areas, territories settled by Ukrainians as early as the beginning of the 19th century (e.g. Taganrog District) were transferred to Ukraine. However, the administrative border between Ukraine and Russia significantly differed from the ethnographic one. The UkrSSR hoped to exchange the Russian populated eastern part of the Donbas for the territories of Voronezh and Kursk Governorates, where Ukrainians were in the majority. The issue of changing borders between the republics was considered for more than a year, but the decision accepted on October 16, 1925 was not in favor of Ukraine. Russia took back most of the areas of the Eastern Donbas and Taganrog, while Ukraine in return was given only small parts of Voronezh and Kursk Governorates. The UkrSSR’s attempts in 1926-1928 to initiate a review of the unfavorable decisions were unsuccessful. After 1928 and until the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Donbas remained unchanged. The boundary between Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts was finalized in 1938. The border of independent Ukraine is identical to the administrative border of the former Ukrainian SSR. This is consistent with the principles of international law and is enshrined in a number of multilateral and international agreements, including: ѠѠ Treaty between the Ukrainian SSR and the Russian SFSR (November 19, 1990); ѠѠ Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership between Ukraine and the Russian Federation (May 31, 1997); ѠѠ Treaty Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the Russian-Ukrainian State Border (January 28, 2003). Since Ukraine’s independence, the Russian Federation never officially put forward any territorial claims to the Ukrainian Donbas.\n\n20. 20 Donbas In Flames Rust Belt The economic development of the Donbas is mostly determined by mineral deposits, primarily coal. In this regard the Donetsk Basin is similar to other old industrial zones, such as the Rust Belt in the U.S., mining regions in Great Britain, the Ruhr and Saar regions of Germany, Silesia in Poland, Nord- Pas-de-Calais in France. These regions have a high level of urbanization. They used to develop at a rapid pace. But the decline of heavy industry in the economy and the inability to compete with newly industrialized countries (China, India, etc.) brought unemployment and social vulnerability. The first coal mines and steel mills in the Donbas appeared in the late 18th century. Then the workers were mainly Ukrainian-speaking peasants from nearby villages. The rise of coal mining, steel, and later machine-building industry, occurred in 1880-1890’s. The need for labor led to significant population growth in the region. Skilled workers from Russia and, more generally, people of different nationalities looking for better life, were coming to the Donbas. Foreign investments and companies from Belgium, France, Germany, and Great Britain boosted the local economy. The first name of Donetsk - Yuzivka - comes from the name of John Hughes, a native of Wales, the owner of a steelworks. The Donbas was one of the main industrial centers of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. The typical mindset of the Donbas population was formed in the Soviet period, and it has remained the same to this day. Because of the demographic devastation during the Holodomor - the famine of 1932- 1933 - the Ukrainian countryside was not a major donor of human resources for the growing industrial cities of the Donbas. The demand for labor was satisfied with people from all over the Soviet Union, creating an international, predominantly Russian-speaking environment in urban agglomerations. Soviet propaganda cultivated the image of the heroic working class. In the 1930s, the movement of champions in production was a signature sign of the Donbas. The most famous of them was Stakhanov movement named after Alexei Stakhanov. In 1935, he set a record for coal extraction and became an icon of Soviet miners. In 1978, the town of Kadiyivka in Luhansk Oblast was renamed Stakhanov. Another episode of Donbas heroic history was the Young Guard, an underground youth group that was active in Luhansk Oblast during the Nazi occupation in 1942-1943. The nostalgia for the former glory and the devotion to the memories of the anti-Nazi resistance were successfully used later by Russian propaganda in the politicization of the Donbas. Despite the constant glorification of the Donbas by Soviet propaganda, its population faced unresolved social and economic problems. Worker strikes began in the Donbas in the 1960’s, long before the Solidarity movement in Poland, peaking in 1989-1990. The strikers demanded better living and working conditions and reviews of company management. The great hope was that the independence of Ukraine would help resolve social problems. This created the precedent of a powerful political alliance between national democratic forces and the miners in the fight against the communist regime. Contrary to expectations, with independence, the economic problems of Ukraine only deepened. The collapse of the interconnected industrial complex of the USSR, the primary consumer of the Donbas production, and painful transition from a planned to a market economy led to the decline of factories and mines. Unemployment increased sharply. Social problems were compounded by rising crime and industrial pollution. In the years preceding the conflict, Donetsk Oblast was ranked last among all regions of Ukraine in terms of human development index. Luhansk Oblast was also at the bottom of the list.\n\n21. 21 Chapter 2. Could the War Be Avoided?

Anthracite coal is mined here, and it is used by all thermal power plants of the country. Coking coal went to steel production, which, along with agricultural products, is one of the main exports of Ukraine. Donbas business owners became the richest people in Ukraine. They converted their influence into political projects such as the Party of Regions. The importance of Donbas industrial enterprises for the economy of Ukraine has been a contentious subject. The opinion that the region “gives more than it receives” from the central government is popular, but it is not supported by any economic evidence. For example, in 2010 the share of Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine’s GDP was 12%, but the share of subsidies received by the oblast from the state budget was 20.9% of the total allocation for all oblasts. The industrial facilities are located in urban agglomerations. Many factories are located in Donetsk, including: 4 steel and 1 non-ferrous metal works, 25 coal mines, 26 machine building plants, and 8 chemical plants. There are 2 steel mills and 19 machine building plants in Mariupol. Luhansk has 9 large industrial complexes. These cities formed the basis of the industry in the region. Company towns, with a single factory being the foundation of the local economy and a major source of employment, are a typical feature of the Donbas. For example, Severodonetsk was built around a chemical plant, Vuhledar exists because of nearby coal mines. Similar and different The latest and, for the time being, only census of independent Ukraine was conducted in 2001. For reference, we will use the data obtained in the last USSR census of 1989. Both censuses show that the most numerous nationalities in Ukraine (including Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts) are Ukrainians and Russians, and the most spoken languages are Ukrainian and Russian. Most numerous nationalities 1989 2001 1989 2001 1989 2001100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Donetsk Oblast Luhansk Oblast Ukraine total 43,6% 50,7% 38,2% 56,9% 44,8% 51,9% 39,0% 58,0% 77,8% 17,3%22,1% 72,7% Ukrainians Russians Other nationalities Even though the share of ethnic Russians in the population of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts is significantly higher than in Ukraine as a whole, Ukrainians are still the majority here. According to the 2001 census, in the Donbas Russians were the majority nationality only in 2 districts of Luhansk Oblast (Stanytsia Luhanska district and Sorokine district), and in 7 cities of regional significance: Donetsk, Makiyivka, Yenakiieve (Donetsk Oblast), Sorokyne / Krasnodon, Dovzhansk / Sverdlovsk, Khrustalnyi / Krasnyi Luch, Kadiivka / Stakhanov (Luhansk Oblast).\n\n23. 23 Chapter 2. Could the War Be Avoided? GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE Between the 1989 and 2001 censuses, the share of Ukrainians in the population increased, while the share of Russians decreased. This was true for both Ukraine as a whole and Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in particular. To a certain extent, the decrease of the share of Russians can be attributed to their migration to the Russian Federation after 1991; however, the main reason is the change of the national identity of many citizens of the independent Ukraine. After the collapse of the USSR, being a Russian national, as claimed by many people of different ethnicities, including Ukrainians, was no longer “prestigious”. On the contrary, many citizens of Ukraine, regardless of their ethnic origin, started to identify themselves with the Ukrainian political nation, and that was the meaning they associated with the concept of “nationality” during the 2001 census. Most spoken languages 1989 2001 1989 2001 1989 2001100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Donetsk Oblast Luhansk Oblast Ukraine total Ukrainian Russian Other languages 67,66% 30,56% 74,9% 24,1% 63,9% 34,9% 68,8% 30,0% 67,53% 29,59%32,8% 64,7% While Ukrainian is the most common native language in Ukraine, and the share of all citizens claiming Ukrainian as their native language increased between the 1989 and 2001 censuses, the situation in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts is different. For most of the Donbas population Russian has been and still remains their native language. From the territorial perspective, Russian-speaking people are the majority in the urban communities of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Ukrainian-speaking areas are located mostly in the north and west of the region and are mainly rural. The census data shows that the share of Ukrainian-speaking population in these regions decreased as compared with the USSR period. This was due to the depressive trends in the rural areas and urbanization accompanied with Russification. The absolute majority of the population of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, just like in all of Ukraine, is fluent in both Ukrainian and Russian.\n\n24. 24 Donbas In Flames Composition of the population of Eastern Ukraine in the 2001 census by ethnicity and native language Nationality Ukrainians Russians Native language Ukrainian Russian The distribution of religious beliefs in the society can be to a certain extent evaluated on the basis of the data of the State Committee on Religions of Ukraine, containing the information on the number of registered religious organizations. As of 2013, religious communities in the region were represented in the following proportions: Religious communities Donetsk Oblast Luhansk Oblast Ukraine total Roman Catholic Protestant Other Ortodox Greek Catholic 6,2% 39,6%42,3% 6,3% 4,5% 28,5% 52%53,6% 48,8% 11,7% 3,3%2%0,7% The proportion of religious organizations in the region is similar to that in all of Ukraine: Orthodox Christians are the majority. None of the ethnic, language, or religious factors make Donetsk or Luhansk Oblasts significantly different from the rest of the country. There is no distinct political differentiation in the Ukrainian society\n\n25. 25 Chapter 2. Could the War Be Avoided? GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE based on cultural background. On the contrary, there is the tendency towards mutual assimilation and the possibility for each individual to choose their ethnic, language and religious identity. Therefore, the war in the Donbas is not an internal conflict based on ethno-political or religious differences, like those in Ulster, Karabakh, or Bosnia Voting Rights On December 1, 1991, the All-Ukraine referendum on the support of the Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine was held. At the national level, 90.32% of the citizens voted for independence. The level of support for independence in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts was almost the same and rather high: 83.9% and 83.86%, respectively. During the period of 1991-2015, Ukraine held 6 presidential elections and 7 parliamentary elections, which ensured sufficiently frequent transition of power among political groups at the national level. Donetsk Oblast holds the top spot in Ukraine by the number of registered voters with approximately 9% of the total. Together with Luhansk Oblast in the 7th place, the Donbas represents almost 14% of the total number of Ukrainian voters. Judging by the results of the presidential campaigns, the voters in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts mostly supported the winning candidates. Donetsk Oblast favorites won four electoral campaigns, those of Luhansk Oblast – three campaigns. During the 22 peaceful years, the Presidents of Ukraine that won the vote in Donetsk Oblast were in office for 17 years. Luhansk Oblast favorites held the President’s office for 12 years. These presidents were Leonid Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, and Viktor Yanukovych – that is, all presidents except Viktor Yushchenko. Describing the political engagement of the population of the region is not a simple task. Of the 352 political parties of Ukraine, only 12 were established in the densely populated Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. However, the voters consistently supported the national-level political forces established in Kyiv, rather than local parties. In parliamentary elections, the residents of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts mostly voted for the Communist Party of Ukraine or for the ruling political forces (for example, the “For United Ukraine” bloc). This remained true up to 2006, when the Party of Regions supporting Viktor Yanukovych became their main favorite. Both the parties supported by Donbas voters and the people from that region were always properly represented in the parliament of Ukraine. ««By the end of the 1980s through the beginning of the 1990s, a miner movement was quite strong in the Donbas, then later - in the 1990s – it was either bought or banned... Piotr Andrusieczko, journalist None of the political forces most strongly supported by the voters of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts presented itself as a single-region party. None of the local parties stated as its goal the independence of the Donbas or its unification with Russia. The mainstream of the political life of Ukraine had no tradition of Donbas separatism. Depending on the political situation, political representatives of the Donbas tried either to expand their influence to the entire country or to minimize their opponents’ influence through decentralization. The leaders of the Party of Regions were mostly concerned about strengthening their personal\n\n26. 26 Donbas In Flames administrative and economic influence, and were quite successful in that, too. However, they failed to dominate the culture and ideology on the national scale. To prevent his opponents’ “ideological expansion” into his main electoral regions, Yanukovych’s party raised the issue of the federalization of Ukraine, securing the status of regional languages, and generally the right of certain regions to live “side by side rather than together”. ThePartyofRegionswontheparliamentaryelectionsthreetimes(in2006,2007,and2012);Yanukovych was the Prime Minister in 2006-2007, and in 2010 he won the presidential elections. Therefore, before the war, the Donbas was always actively involved in the politics at the national level and was able to have its interests represented in Kyiv. Unsolicited patronage Officially, the Russian Federation never advanced any territorial claims to Ukraine. With the possible exception of Crimea, Moscow was interested in being able to influence the politics of the Ukrainian government, rather than claiming specific territories. Ever since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Russia has never stopped hoping to restore the political unity with most of the ex-Soviet republics. The European Union became a model of integration. Following the EU example, Moscow emphasized economic integration as the prerequisite for the political format. Membership of the post-Soviet republics in the Customs Union of the Eurasian Economic Union was to become the first step. For Ukraine, which stated its intentions to integrate into the European economic and political structures (the EU and NATO), the Customs Union with Russia was less attractive. Balancing between the East and the West, Ukrainian governments for quite some time kept to the principle of the so-called “multi-vector” foreign policy. In 2010-2013, Moscow increased its pressure on Kyiv. During that period Yanukovych was the President of Ukraine, and he had the reputation of a pro-Russian politician. He rejected the NATO integration policy and helped strengthen Russia’s standing in the economy, ideology, security, and other important areas. The Kremlin put great hopes on Yanukovych becoming the leader, who would bring Ukraine into the Customs Union. However, the President of Ukraine was also forced to take into account the pro-European popular opinion, and he also expected the West to provide financial aid. Therefore, the government initiated the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement and was preparing for its signing in November 2013. At the last moment, under the intense pressure from Moscow, Yanukovych refused to sign the Association Agreement, which triggered popular protests known as the Revolution of Dignity or the Euromaidan. When it became obvious that Yanukovych would not be able to hold the power and to bring Ukraine into the Customs Union, Moscow began its military aggression against Ukraine. The ghost of Russian separatism in Ukraine appeared whenever Moscow became unsure of its position in Kyiv. In fact, it was a tool used to blackmail the Ukrainian authorities in order to keep Ukraine within the circle of Russian influence. For a long time, Moscow had been demanding federalization of Ukraine to strengthen its position in the peripheral regions. Autonomous peripheral regions led by pro-Russian politicians could have:\n\n27. 27 Chapter 2. Could the War Be Avoided? GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE ѠѠ prevented the consolidation of the Ukrainian society ѠѠ blocked Kyiv’s resolutions unfavorable for Moscow ѠѠ prepared the base for Russian expansion. Moscow had been encouraging outward tendencies in Ukraine for years. And here the Donbas was getting special attention. It was in the focus of government and non-government organizations of the Russian Federation, their branches in Ukraine, and pro-Russian organizations of Ukraine – of regionalist, leftist, and Orthodox character. Russian interests in Ukraine were represented by the Institute of the CIS Countries (with its branches in Ukraine), the Coordination Council of the Organization of Russian Compatriots (with its branches in Ukraine), the All-Ukraine Social Movement “Ukrainian Choice”, the political party “Russian Bloc”, and others. ««At the History Department of the Donetsk University there was a group under the personal patronage of Aleksandr Dugin. Every year he arranged camps, offered ideological lessons to the delicate graduate youth and instilled neo-Eurasian ideas in them... Taras Shumeyko, journalist At the same time, several concepts of separating the Donbas from Kyiv were being developed. “South-East” Russian political strategists considered Crimea and the 8 oblasts in the South and East of Ukraine (Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk) as the most promising base for launching the federalization agenda. During the 2004 presidential elections, the team of the pro-Russian candidate Yanukovych was convincing their followers that the team of their opponent (Yushchenko) was allegedly scornful towards the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine; that they regarded them as “inferior”, when compared to the central and western regions. Although Yanukovych lost those elections, the south-eastern regions became the electoral base for him and his Party of Regions for many years. The contraposition of the different parts of Ukraine reached its peak on December 28, 2004, at the Congress of Deputies of All Levels in Severodonetsk (Luhansk Oblast). Yanukovych’s supporters then attempted to proclaim the South-Eastern Ukrainian Autonomous Republic. “Three ranks of Ukrainians”, the banner used by the Victor Yanukovych campaign during the presidential elections of 2004. On this map, the residents of the Western Ukraine are assigned the first rank, while the residents of the southern and eastern regions are assigned the third and worst rank. Yanukovych’s competitor, Viktor Yushchenko, was accused of having this vision of Ukraine. This false accusation was never properly refuted and took root in the views held by many residents of the Donbas.\n\n28. 28 Donbas In Flames ««At first, local oligarchs pushed this «for Russia» movement to keep their assets in the Donbas... Taras Shumeyko, journalist The Kremlin’s political strategists were actively spreading the message of the national and civilizational singularity of the south-eastern regions. It was accompanied by fabricated facts about their national identity and their history as a part of Ukraine. Moscow declared its readiness to protect the interests of the population of those territories from Kyiv. “Donetsk Republic” In order to legitimize the Donbas as a political entity, various historical and economical justifications were offered. The Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic, a short-lived (winter-spring of 1918) political formation created by the Bolsheviks, was presented as a historical tradition. The status and significance of this formation were exaggerated in every possible way. The Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic was set against the real republics of that time: the Ukrainian People’s Republic and the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. In 2011, the Director of the Ukrainian branch of the Institute of CIS Countries Vladimir Kornilov published a book titled “Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic: A dream shot dead”, where he tried to prove the allegation that the Donbas was a part not of Ukraine but of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic. Kornilov’s work was widely promoted in Ukraine. The cover of the book “Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic: A dream shot dead” by the Director of the Ukrainian branch of the Institute of CIS Countries Vladimir Kornilov. In this book, the author promotes the tradition of separate governance in the Donbas, contrasting it against the rest of Ukraine. The economic reasoning was compressed into a very short statement: “The Donbas feeds Ukraine”. The alleged “injustice” was that the foreign policy and ideological agenda were formed by the “subsidized regions”, while the Donbas was deprived of its political rights. Until 2013, the Kremlin actively supported the activities of pro-Russian organizations in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, in particular The Donetsk Republic, The Donbas for Eurasian Union, The United Donbas, and others. The propaganda of these organizations stated that the economy of the Donbas would benefit from Ukraine’s integration with the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan and not from the signing of the EU Association Agreement.\n\n29. 29 Chapter 2. Could the War Be Avoided? GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE “Novorossiya” The concept of Novorossiya offered a historical basis for the federative and separatist projects for the south-eastern regions of Ukraine. In the 18th century, Novorossiya Governorate was established in the Russian Empire. Its borders were always changing, but they never matched those of the current separatist “Novorossiya” project. For example, Kharkiv and the northern parts of Luhansk Oblast (Sloboda Ukraine) never belonged to the historical Novorossiya. On the other hand, the historical Novorossiya included, for example, Crimea and Taganrog. Support for the idea of the “restoration of Novorossiya” as a distinct territory, culturally and politically different from the rest of Ukraine, first emerged in the early 1990s. However, until 2014 its followers remained marginalized. The gist of their argument was that all credit for the colonization of the steppe lands, establishment and development of cities was to be given to the Russian Empire. Therefore, “by right” Novorossiya was to belong to Russia rather than Ukraine.

If the Russian army had come to a different region of Ukraine, it would have also found some supporters, let’s say in Kharkiv or Odesa, and then we would be trying to understand the characteristics of that phenomenon too. Of course, it was easier to do in the Donbas for several reasons: there are more people with the «Soviet mindset» there. However, in Kharkiv there were many more Kremlin agents, because that was the center of the Russian destabilization of Ukraine. Vitaly Portnikov, political columnist This political project was given a boost by Putin at his annual press conference on April 17, 2014, when he said that Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Odesa belonged to Novorossiya, which had never belonged in Ukraine. According to the President of Russia, Novorossiya was unlawfully included into Ukraine by the Bolsheviks. In the spring of 2014, the concept of Novorossiya Confederation was developed. It was to include 8 so-called “people’s republics”, created out of the eastern and southern oblasts of Ukraine. In reality, only the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics were formed in the particular districts of the corresponding oblasts.

The seizure of Slovyansk and other towns in the northern part of Donetsk Oblast by Girkin’s unit became the reason for the launch of the Anti-Terrorist Operation in the East of Ukraine (ATO).\n\n31. 31GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine began on February 20, 2014, when Russian military began to reposition its units at ​​the Strait of Kerch and on the Crimean peninsula in violation of the rules stipulated by Russian-Ukrainian treaties on Russian Black Sea Fleet status in Ukraine. This date is recognized by both the Ukrainian and Russian sides as the beginning of the standoff. It is engraved on the Russian Ministry of Defense medal “For the Return of Crimea” established on March 21, 2014. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in its statement released on April 21, 2015 and the Law of Ukraine “On amendments to some laws of Ukraine regarding the determination of the start date of the temporary occupation” of September 15, 2015 defined February 20, 2014 as the start of the Russian aggression. In February and March of 2014, Crimea was the major theater of the conflict. Russia was successful in combining the operations of paramilitary and regular military units. Starting in April, the epicenter of the confrontation shifted to Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Unlike in Crimea, in mainland Ukraine the Russian tactics did not work so well. The first stage of the war lasted until September 2014 and ended with the signing of the Minsk Protocol (Minsk I). The most intense fighting during the conflict occurred in July and August of 2014. The second stage of the war took place in December 2014 through February 2015 - up until “Package of measures to implement Minsk agreements” (Minsk II) came into effect. Since then the standoff took the form of a limited positional conflict. End of February 2014 After the mass shooting of Euromaidan protesters, the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych left Kyiv and escaped to Kharkiv, where on February 22 the congress of MPs and regional elected officials from the South-Eastern parts of mainland Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula took place. The situation echoed the congress of local government officials held on December 28, 2004 in Severodonetsk. Just like in 2004, the plans to establish an alternative power center in Kharkiv failed. Yanukovych did not show up at the congress, and its organizers fled to Russia shortly thereafter. Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine ousted Yanukovych and his cronies from the office in Kyiv. Chapter 3.

In Kharkiv, Donetsk, Simferopol, Odesa, and other large cities, the camps of supporters of the new government (participants of the Revolution of Dignity) and Yanukovych regime backers (so-called Antimaidan) coexisted. It were the civil activists from both camps who were in control of the situation and often took over governing from the paralyzed official apparatus. Meanwhile, Russia was making the last preparations for the invasion of Ukraine. The stationing of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and other locations in Crimea facilitated the task of infiltration and accumulation of disguised regular troops in the peninsula. Select local government officials were recruited by Moscow and received instructions from Russia. Russian hybrid forces were joined by local Antimaidan supporters, riot policemen from Berkut units, who had just recently cracked down on the protests in Kyiv, and fighters of paramilitary Cossack organizations, who had arrived from Russia. On February 23, the so-called National Will Rally was held in Sevastopol, where local pro-Russian activists announced that they would not recognize the new government in Kyiv and called on Russia to intervene. Right at the rally, the crowd “voted” for the new “people’s mayor” – a Russian citizen and businessman Alexei Chaly. The takeover tactics first tested in Sevastopol would later be used by Russia in the mainland cities of the South and East of Ukraine. During the night of February 23, Yanukovych with his family and closest supporters left Ukraine aboard one of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet warships. On the morning of February 27, Russian soldiers wearing unmarked military uniforms seized administrative buildings of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in Simferopol. In the following days mobile combat teams of the Russian Army spread from Russian Black Sea Fleet garrisons across Crimea. Acting in close cooperation, paramilitary groups and Russian military servicemen seized key facilities and communications of Crimea. Ukrainian servicemen barricaded themselves at their military bases and offered passive resistance. At the time of political uncertainty, none of the Ukrainian commanders was bold enough to take the responsibility for authorizing the use of weapons. The rise of anti-government groups in Southern and Eastern regions of Ukraine was branded by Russian propagandists “the Russian Spring”. This label covered the pro-Russian unrest in both mainland Ukraine and Crimea. March 2014 Within one month, all military bases and warships, along with the headquarters of the Ukrainian Naval Forces in Sevastopol, were captured by Russian hybrid forces. To seal the takeover of Crimea, a fake referendum on the status of the peninsula was held. The Russian government hastily signed a treaty with the self-proclaimed Crimean leaders for the “reunification” of Crimea with Russia. The treaty was signed into law by Russian President Putin on March 21, even before the military takeover operation in Crimea was over. The crew of the Ukrainian Navy minesweeper Cherkasy was the last one to surrender on March 25. While the occupation of Crimea was underway, several cities of the East and South of Ukraine witnessed the first attempts to seize administrative buildings. Political “tourists” were bussed to the sites of anti-government protests in Ukrainian cities from Belgorod and Rostov Oblasts of Russia and\n\n33. 33 Chapter 3. Chronicles of War GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE from Transnistria. Pro-Russian rally participants seized Regional Administration buildings in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Odesa and flew Russian flags on them. Following the example of Sevastopol, protesters appointed “people’s governors” and “people’s mayors”. At pro-Russian rallies speakers were demanding the federalization of Ukraine and making Russian an official state language. They also rejected the new interim government in Kyiv and appealed for support to the Russian leadership. Despite persistent attempts, pro-Russian protesters could not hold on to their success in mainland Ukraine in March 2014. Maidan activists and law enforcement officers loyal to the government stood against them. From time to time, street clashes between activists would turn into bloody fights. Some pro-Russian protesters and rally leaders were arrested, “people’s governors” Pavel Gubarev and Aleksandr Kharitonov among them. Step-by-step, the Ukrainian government started regaining control over the situation. On March 13, Interior Troops were reformed into the National Guard of Ukraine. Amid the revival of patriotic enthusiasm, participants of Euromaidan Revolution were readily joining its ranks Russian troops surround the base of the 36th Separate Coastal Defense Brigade of the Ukrainian Navy. Perevalne, Crimea, March 2, 2014. Photo by Taras Shumeyko. April 2014 The militants that helped Russia occupy Crimea were now redeploying to Southern and Eastern cities of mainland Ukraine. A major upsurge in pro-Russian unrest occurred on April 6-7. After a fight with the police, protesters seized Donetsk and Kharkiv Regional Administration buildings and proclaimed\n\n34. 34 Donbas In Flames the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DPR) and the “Kharkiv People’s Republic” (KhPR). In Luhansk, a mob seized the regional office of the Security Service of Ukraine with its firearms arsenal. On behalf of the “Joint Staff of the Army of the South-East”, the leaders of Luhansk militants released on Internet the ultimatum to government authorities. Militants from Igor Girkin’s team ride the captured BMP-2 in the center of Slovyansk. In the foreground is the militant nicknamed “Balu”, who had arrived from Crimea. April, 16, 2014. Photo by Taras Shumeyko. ««There was a really interesting moment in Slovyansk, when we went there with reporters from Polish TV stations. We were approached by a commander of all those fighters. Not Girkin, someone of a lower rank. And we asked him, “Who are you all?” And he said, “We are Donbas militia.” I ran to the senior fighter right then and asked, “I’m sorry, are you all locals?” And I was answered, “No, we all came from Crimea.” That was direct evidence of where they all really came from - though I had had no doubts whatsoever, who they were. Piotr Andrusieczko, journalist\n\n35. 35 Chapter 3. Chronicles of War GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE The Ukrainian government managed to reverse and stabilize the situation everywhere, with the exception of Donetsk and Luhansk. Police prevented the mob from seizing the building of the Mykolaiv Regional Administration. The Kharkiv Regional Administration building was retaken by special forces of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs. The leaders of the self-proclaimed KhPR and the most prominent separatists were arrested, though some of them fled to Russia, Transnistria, and occupied Crimea. Meanwhile, the leaders of the self-proclaimed DPR announced the formation of “armed self- defense groups”. The demands of Donbas militants were contradictory and confusing. Calls for the federalization of Ukraine, the independence of the Donbas, and the unification of the region with Russia were proclaimed all at the same time. It was obvious that Pushilin, Bolotov, and other leaders of the militants did not want to take the responsibility for further steps. They sat on their hands and waited for Moscow to repeat the Crimean scenario in the Donbas. ««...In April 2014, we were in Slovyansk ... Everything looked sort of surreal: people with Shock Worker of Socialist Labor badges were protesting against the Kyiv junta. Popular support was still weak at that time. Later, most of the indifferent masses sided with the separatists. The local narrative gradually persuaded them… Taras Shumeyko, journalist On April 12, 2014, government buildings of the city of Sloviansk in Donetsk Oblast were seized by the armed and well-equipped assault team led by Igor Girkin (a.k.a. Igor Strelkov), a Russian citizen with military intelligence background, who arrived from Russia. The militants also established control over a number of other towns in the northern part of Donetsk Oblast: Lyman / Krasnyi Lyman, Sviatohirsk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka. This laid the ground for the seizure of other towns in the region. Girkin’s militants engaged in a firefight with the reconnaissance group of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) near Sloviansk, during which SBU captain Gennady Bilichenko was killed. On April 14, acting President of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov signed a decree enacting the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine on the start of the anti-terrorist operation (ATO) in Eastern Ukraine. Subsequently the ATO zone was divided into sectors: A (northern part of Luhansk Oblast), C (northern part of Donetsk Oblast), B (western part of Donetsk Oblast), M (areas close to Mariupol) and D (along the state border with Russia). The 25th Separate Airborne Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stationed in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was the combat-ready formation closest to the ATO zone. Its units were the first to be sent to Kramatorsk Airport. Later on, other Army and National Guard units joined them there. In Sloviansk, Igor Girkin appointed himself the commander of all DPR militant troops. They called themselves “People’s Militia of the Donbas”. In April, Ukrainian troops were predominantly fighting against Girkin’s militant groups in the northern part of Donetsk Oblast. When fighting with Ukrainian forces, militants widely used human shield tactics. Armed clashes also occurred in Mariupol. Two assault operations aimed at regaining control of Sloviansk that were conducted by Ukrainian troops on April 13 and April 24 came to naught. Meanwhile, Ukrainian government officials continued the negotiations with the militants in Donetsk and Luhansk, respectively.\n\n36. 36 Donbas In Flames Locals incited by the Girkin’s militants are blocking the path of Ukrainian armored convoys. Suburbs of Slovyansk, April 2014. Photo by Taras Shumeyko. The Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) was proclaimed on April 27. By the end of the month the separatists managed to capture the entire city of Luhansk and some other cities of Luhansk Oblast, including Alchevsk, Stanytsia Luhanska, Dovzhansk / Sverdlovsk, and Khrustalny / Krasnyi Luch. Armed groups of LPR militants called themselves “United Army of the South-East”. May 2014 The beginning of May was marred by the bloody events in Odesa. On May 2, during provoked armed clashes between pro-Russian separatists and supporters of the united Ukraine, dozens of people were killed. Most of them were pro-Russian activists, who died in the fire that broke out in the Trade Unions Building. From that moment, overt activities of Russian supporters in the cities of Southern and Eastern Ukraine waned. However, the tragic events in Odesa were used by Russian propaganda as a recruiting tool for anti-Ukrainian militias participating in the armed conflict in the Donbas. In the beginning of the month, the fighting with Girkin’s militant groups continued around Kramatorsk. Ukrainian troops took Karachun, the dominant hill between Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Ukrainian anti-terrorist forces began using helicopters, but almost immediately suffered losses to MANPADS. Ukrainian Armed Forces lost 3 helicopters in May. Armed militants took control of Mariupol and some other cities of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts.\n\n37. 37 Chapter 3. Chronicles of War GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE Lack of equipment, training and motivation of Ukraine’s professional army were compensated by the astounding rise of Ukrainian civil society. Volunteers came to help the Army and the National Guard: Dnipro, Donbas, Aidar, Azov, and other volunteer battalions joined ATO forces. ««... In May 2014, Aleksey Mozgovoy confidentially told us, BBC journalists, that his Prizrak squad was armed by Vladimir Zhirinovsky’s Liberal Democratic Party… Taras Shumeyko, journalist In the meantime, militants were forming new combat units to fight with government forces in the Donbas. The Vostok battalion was created in Donetsk Oblast, with the Cossack National Guard of Great Host of Don Cossacks, Prizrak and Zarya battalions in Luhansk Oblast. Small special forces teams and trucks loaded with weapons started crossing the border from Russia. This was when first armed clashes at Ukraine-Russia border checkpoints occurred. Russian regular troops – in particular, the ones from Chechnya - were spotted in the Donbas in May. A Chechen Interior Ministry special forces soldier on the roof of Donetsk Airport. May 26, 2014. Photo retrieved from the phone of a militant killed on that date.\n\n38. 38 Donbas In Flames On May 11, 2014, militants’ appointees organized the so-called “referendum on the independence of the DPR and the LPR” in various towns and villages of the Donbas. The passivity of government authorities and law enforcement officers at the local level contributed to the swift territorial expansion by militants seeking to gain control over all the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Roads became the next target of the fighting. Checkpoints were erected by both sides of the conflict in cities and on highways. The Zello push-to-talk application was used by anti-government forces for communication. Militants sought to take control of Route H20 connecting Sloviansk, Donetsk, and Mariupol. One of the battles took place near the town of Volnovakha on the highway connecting Donetsk and Mariupol. Along highway M03, militants reached as far as Kharkiv Oblast and attacked Izium. Militants ambushed the Donbas volunteer battalion on Route M04 near Karlivka (one of the entry points to Donetsk). Armed clashes broke out around Luhansk as well. Expanding to the north, militants seized Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and Rubizhne. Deploying over Route H21, they attacked Novoaidar. Still, they failed capture the northern part of Luhansk Oblast and the western part of Donetsk Oblast. On May 24, the leaders of the DPR and the LPR announced their association into the so-called Confederate Alliance of People’s Republics of Novorossiya. This association was a formal declaration of territorial claims over other regions of Eastern and Southern Ukraine. The election of the President of Ukraine was held the next day. Polling stations opened for voting in the government-controlled part of the Donbas: in the western and northern parts of Donetsk Oblast and in the northern part of Luhansk Oblast. OnMay26,UkrainiantroopspushedVostokbattalionmilitantsandRussianmercenariesoutofDonetsk Airport. Ukrainian forces used several aircraft against the militants. At the end of the month, Ukrainian troops shot down their first Russian drone, which was flying over the ATO zone near Donetsk. June 2014 In June, both sides of conflict were busy with military buildup and entrenching. The Ukrainian Army liberated Lyman / Krasnyi Lyman, Mariupol, and Schastya and made attempts to secure a denser blockade of Sloviansk. ATO forces took hold of Luhansk and Donetsk airports. The ATO command continued to use aircraft, but still suffered losses. Militants shot down a helicopter and an An-30B reconnaissance airplane near Sloviansk. On June 14, an IL-76 transport aircraft was shot down by militants on approach to Luhansk Airport; all 49 troops onboard were killed. DPR militants consolidated in the urban areas along the Donets Ridge. They established control over Chystiakove / Torez and Shakhtarsk located along Route H21. After the liberation of Mariupol, ATO forces continued their advance along the state border with the intent to cut off the militants’ communication routes with Russia. This task was assigned to the sector D. Clashes at the border checkpoints - Dyakove, Marynivka, Voznesenivka / Chervonopartyzansk - intensified. Meanwhile, trucks and armored vehicles were coming into Ukraine from Russia through Izvaryne on a massive scale. On June 13, ATO forces captured a BM-21 “Grad” MLRS near Dobropillya; the accompanying documents indicated that the MLRS belonged to the 18th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 58th Army of Russia.\n\n39. 39 Chapter 3. Chronicles of War GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE BM-21 “Grad” MLRS of the 18th Brigade of the 58th Army of Russia, captured by ATO troops near Dobropillya, Donetsk Oblast. June 13, 2014. A short ceasefire lasted from June 20 to June 30; both sides used this time to continue their military buildup. In Donetsk, militants formed two new battalions: Oplot and Kalmius. Tanks and large caliber artillery appeared in the hands of the anti-government forces. Militants systematically violated the ceasefire. July 2014 In early July, the fighting intensified in the northern part of Donetsk Oblast. On July 5, militant troops commanded by Girkin left Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, Kostyantynivka, and Bakhmut / Artemivsk and retreated to Donetsk. The epicenter of fighting in Donetsk Oblast shifted there as well. Militants set up a heavily fortified area on the outskirts of the city. Protracted battles continued in Sector D. Attacking from the towns located on the Donets Ridge, militants were trying to secure access to the state border with Russia near Marynivka and Izvaryne. Ukrainian forces were squeezed into a narrow corridor between the militants’ strongholds in the Donets Ridge cities and the state border with Russia. On July 11, 2014, a Ukrainian forces’ camp near Zelenopillya was shelled with rocket launchers from the territory of Russia. 36 troops were killed. After that, Ukrainian territory was regularly shelled from Russian territory across the border. Supported by Russian artillery, DPR militants attacked Ukrainian forces from the area of Chystyakove / Torez in the direction of the state border near Marynivka and cut off some units of Sector D positioned to the east of Stepanivka.\n\n40. 40 Donbas In Flames DPR militants posing with the debris of Flight MH17. Late 2014. Photo posted on a social network. The fighting continued around Luhansk and Donetsk Airports controlled by ATO forces and on the outskirts of Luhansk and Donetsk. The Ukrainian Army virtually surrounded Horlivka and made attempts to cut the routes from Luhansk to Izvaryne and Alchevsk. Ukrainian aviation and artillery inflicted heavy losses on militants and military convoys coming from Russia by Route M04. However, the Ukrainian Air Force continued to suffer losses. Four Ukrainian military planes were shot down in July; two of them were hit with air-to-air missiles from the territory of Russia. On July 17, near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, militants shot down the Boeing 777 aircraft operated by Malaysian Airlines as Flight MH17. All 298 people onboard were killed. In the days before the incident, militant-controlled websites reported about a newly acquired Buk surface-to-air system. On July 20-24, Ukrainian Army drove the militants out of Lysychansk-Severodonetsk agglomeration in Luhansk Oblast. The militants retreated to the area around Kadiivka / Stakhanov. Subsequent sieges and assaults of large cities by Ukrainian Army produced no results. Under the circumstances, ATO headquarters shifted to the tactic of partitioning the area under militants’ control and blockading its individual parts. Ukrainian Sector C troops advanced on Debaltseve from the north with the aim to block M03, M04, and H21 routes and thus separate DPR and LPR forces. After the successful recapture of Debaltseve on July 29, fierce battles unfolded in Shakhtarsk, located on Route H21 connecting Donetsk with Luhansk. A raiding group of the 95th Brigade reached the\n\n41. 41 Chapter 3. Chronicles of War GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE northern outskirts of Shakhtarsk and continued moving to Marynivka and the strategic height Savur- Mohyla. The group’s task was to unblock the troops in Sector D that were encircled by enemy forces in the so-called Southern Kettle and suffered from constant shelling from the territory of Russia. In late July, Russian regular troops equipped with armored vehicles were repeatedly spotted crossing the border from Russia into Ukraine. August 2014 In early August, it became clear that Ukrainian troops in Sector D could not keep their positions along the border any more. On August 7, they broke out of the Southern Kettle moving west. Also, Ukrainian Army failed to hold Shakhtarsk and block Route H21. The ATO forces’ tactics were changed. Instead of a broad envelopment along the border, the Ukrainian Army launched an offensive on the stronghold cities along Donets Ridge from Ilovaisk to Khrustalny / Krasnyi Luch. ATO forces managed to gain control of Ilovaisk and Miusynsk. It was assumed that the offensive from Miusynsk towards Khrustalny / Krasnyi Luch would help cut Route H21 and connect with the ATO troops near Lutuhyne and Luhansk Airport. After a series of failed attacks, government forces finally managed to take and hold the Savur-Mohyla strategic height. In Sector A, the fighting continued for the control of the section of Route M04 between the border with Russia and Luhansk. In August, the Ukrainian side continued using military aircraft and lost 4 planes and 2 helicopters. August 3, 2014.

During that period Moscow put together the plan of a joint offensive of the Russian Army and militants to surround and defeat Ukrainian forces. There were some major leadership changes in the DPR and the LPR. Girkin and Borodai were recalled from Donetsk to Russia, and Zakharchenko was placed in the top position. In Luhansk, Bolotov was replaced by Plotnitsky. On August 15, during a meeting of the so-called DPR Council of Ministers, Zakharchenko announced the commitment of “Novorossiya” army reserves in the form of 30 tanks, 120 armored vehicles, and 1,200 troops that trained in Russia over the previous four months. Russian military convoys started coming in large numbers through the border abandoned by the Ukrainian Army and Border Guards. During the battles that took place in the last decade of August, about two dozen Russian Army servicemen were captured by ATO forces. The first so-called humanitarian convoy became a convenient cover for the deployment of Russian troops, weaponry, and ammunition to the Donbas. On August 24, after accumulating considerable forces, the Russian hybrid army launched a counteroffensive in the Donbas. Advancing towards Amvrosiivka and Starobesheve, Russian troops surrounded ATO forces near Savur-Mohyla and Ilovaisk. Sector D that had been essentially defeated ceased to exist. In the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, Russian hybrid troops captured Novoazovsk and approached Mariupol. The command of the Ukrainian units surrounded in Ilovaisk negotiated a peaceful withdrawal to the main ATO positions, planning to go over predefined routes in two columns. However, on August 29, Russian troops violated the agreement and destroyed the columns as they were moving out. Near Ilovaisk, Ukrainian forces suffered their heaviest losses of the war. Beginning of September 2014 In early September, the ATO command had to take into account the fact of the direct Russian military invasionintheDonbas.UkrainianunitsthatwereholdingLutuhyneandLuhanskAirportretreatednorth to Schastya. The heaviest fighting took place between Donetsk and the Sea of Azov. On September 2-5, the 95th and 79th Airborne Brigades conducted raids in the direction of Boikivske / Telmanove and Kalmiuske / Komsomolske, inflicting significant losses on the militants and Russian troops. On September 5, on Route H21 near Vesela Hora (between Luhansk and Schastya) a combat team of the Aidar volunteer battalion was ambushed. Several dozen Ukrainian soldiers were killed. The Minsk Protocol (Minsk I) on a bilateral ceasefire was signed on the same day. September 2014 - February 2015 During the fall of 2014, the contact line between the militants and the Ukrainian forces remained stable. Ceasefire violations occurred on a regular basis, but large-scale offensive combat operations no longer occurred. At that time, the advancement of the Russian hybrid army towards Mariupol was considered the most probable scenario. It was anticipated that Russian forces would attack Mariupol, then move along Route M14 to establish a land bridge to the occupied Crimea. This scenario was actively discussed by both parties of the conflict.\n\n43. 43 Chapter 3.

Heavy shelling resumed everywhere along the contact line. On January 13, Russian hybrid army shelled the checkpoint on Route H20 near Volnovakha and hit a passenger bus. As a result, 12 civilians were killed and 18 were wounded. The fighting for Donetsk Airport continued until January 21 and ended with the withdrawal of Ukrainian units from the airport. Once the battle for Donetsk Airport was over, Russian hybrid forces launched a large scale offensive against the Debaltseve bulge. On January 24, DPR artillery shelled a residential area of Mariupol, killing 30 and injuring 128 civilians. The leader of the self-proclaimed DPR Zakharchenko announced the official start of Mariupol offensive.\n\n44. 44 Donbas In Flames The Russian command planned to surround and destroy ATO forces near Debaltseve. On February 10, in order to divert enemy forces from the Debaltseve bulge, Ukrainian Sector M units carried out an attack towards Novoazovsk. Ukrainian advancement came to a halt near the village of Shyrokyne. On February 12, “Package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements” (commonly referred to as Minsk II) was signed. It provided for immediate ceasefire and outlined the plan for a political settlement of the conflict. Yet, Minsk II did not stop the Russian offensive. The fighting in Sector C ended only on February 18, 2015, after government forces withdrew from Debaltseve and consolidated at the so-called Svitlodarsk bulge. From February 2015 to this day Overthisperiod,theDPRandtheLPR,withtheparticipationoftheirRussianhandlers,havereorganized the disjointed militant groups into 1st Army Corps (DPR) and 2nd Army Corps (LPR). Some disobedient warlords have been removed to Russia or liquidated. The leadership of the Russian Federation sought to achieve their political goals in Ukraine by taking advantage of the Minsk Process. This plan involved the integration of DPR and LPR militants into the decision-making process of the Ukrainian state government. On May 18, 2015, the self-appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the DPR Alexander Kofman and Speaker of the Parliament of Novorossiya Oleg Tsaryov announced the freezing of the Novorossiya project for an indefinite period, since its existence was not envisaged by the Minsk Agreements. ««It didn’t become a large scale war, like it was in July or August, with heavy artillery, right from the start. The conflict escalated gradually, and we kept getting used to it. Piotr Andrusieczko, journalist Periodic outbreaks in fighting can be correlated with the moments when the Kremlin wants to pressure Ukrainian leadership into complying with its agenda. The Battle of Debaltseve was the last notable episode of the war. Large scale offensives no longer occur, but the ceasefire is regularly violated. Among the major clashes of this period can be mentioned the failed assault by the militants against Mariinka in June 2015, the spikes of hostilities at the Svitlodarsk bulge in June and December of 2016, and the fighting in the Avdiivka industrial zone that has been continuing since the end of January 2017.\n\n45. 45GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE Losses and dangers The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that from mid-April 2014 to December 1, 2016 on both sides of the conflict in the Donbas at least 9,758 people were killed, of whom more than 2,000 were civilians, and about 22,800 people were wounded. On February 8, 2017, the National Police of Ukraine reported 1,767 civilians killed and 2,871 wounded in the Donbas during the ATO. According to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, their combat losses as of February 17, 2017 were 2,197 dead and about 8,000 wounded. ««Before a trip to the Donbas, it is necessary to get training for working in dangerous places, most importantly in tactical medical aid, which should be refreshed once a year. One should be properly equipped and physically fit. Sergiy Karazy, journalist The report of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) from February 17, 2017 states that one million children in the east of Ukraine are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance; 200,000 children live within 15 kilometers on both sides of the line of contact, of which around 19,000 are exposed to the constant danger of landmines and other explosive devices. Every fifth school in the Donbas has been destroyed or damaged in the fighting. The entire region has experienced a sharp increase in the number of violent deaths, the deepening demographic crisis, desolation of some areas, significant reduction in industrial production, rising crime rate, deterioration of social standards, high level of migration (mostly due to internally displaced persons - IDPs), and a humanitarian crisis in general. The peace process in the Donbas is governed by the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements (Minsk II). This format gives no reason for optimism as to the political solution for the conflict, but it constrains Russian hybrid forces from an armed escalation. Since March 2014, the Special Monitoring Mission of the OSCE has been operating in Ukraine, its work is focused on monitoring the implementation of the ceasefire in the Donbas. Chapter 4. Life During Wartime\n\n46. 46 Donbas In Flames ATO zone The parts of the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, which experienced or continue to experience the armed conflict, are defined in Ukrainian legislation as «the territory of ​​the anti-terrorist operation» (ATO zone). This area covers about 40,000 sq. km, with its localities listed in a governmental decree. The ATO zone can be divided into three types of areas: ѠѠ the territory controlled by the Ukrainian authorities; ѠѠ temporarily occupied territory (the so-called DPR and LPR); ѠѠ contact line and the “gray” area. Ukraine controls most of the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. At the end of December 2016 it had about 2.6 million residents. Several localities (cities and towns of Kramatorsk and Lysychansk-Severodonetsk agglomerations, Mariupol, and others) were liberated by the ATO forces during the summer campaign of 2014. Since Donetsk and Luhansk remained occupied, the regional governments were temporarily relocated to other cities. From June to October 2014, the regional authorities of Donetsk Oblast were located in Mariupol,andthenweremovedtoKramatorsk.ThecenterofLuhanskOblasthasbeeninSeverodonetsk since September 2014. During 2014-2015, administrative boundaries were changed for Novoaidar and Popasna Raions of Luhansk Oblast and Bakhmut / Artemivsk and Volnovakha Raions of Donetsk Oblast. They absorbed parts of other raions, where administrative centers are under the control of militants. ««...Even if you go into some sort of “gray zone «, a place where there is no fighting, you must bear in mind that ambulances there might not have dressings. When you are brought to a hospital, it may be too late... So, what you are counting on is your individual first aid kit. Anastasia Bereza, a journalist Given the nature of the governing process in the conflict zone, the Parliament of Ukraine passed the Law «On civil-military administrations» (CMA). CMAs were created as temporary public administration bodies within the framework of the Antiterrorist Center of the Security Service of Ukraine. They perform a subset of local government functions. The CMAs, as a rule, operate in the areas adjacent to the contact line and are staffed by military personnel. As of November 2016, there were active Luhansk and Donetsk regional CMAs, four raion CMAs and 25 CMAs responsible for specific cities and towns. In the areas controlled by Ukraine, humanitarian aid is provided and distributed through the mission of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Red Cross Society of Ukraine, UNICEF, GIZ, KfW Development Bank, and Caritas. Ukraine receives the largest amount of aid from the European Union, administered through the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO). The area controlled by DPR and LPR militants measures more than 15,000 sq. km, a little larger than Montenegro. It is less than 30% of the total area of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts (which they lay claim to), and only about 2.5% of the territory of Ukraine. The militants hold 46 cities and towns. According to\n\n47. 47 Chapter 4. Life During Wartime GUIDE TO THE CONFLICT ZONE various sources, about 3.8 million people (over 8% of the population of Ukraine) remain in the occupied parts of the Donbas. Most likely, this number is exaggerated and does not take into account all IDPs. Minsk II defines the territory controlled by DPR and LPR militants as «Particular Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts» (PDDLO). Of the 36 raions of the two oblasts, the PDDLO completely cover the territory of only 10 raions and parts of a few others. ««There is still no clear power vertical in the DPR/LPR, so it can happen that military units do not obey commands from Donetsk / Luhansk. So, the more connections you have, the better are your chances of getting out of the basement even before the scandal around your detention receives international publicity. Taras Shumeyko, journalist The administrations of the DPR and the LPR claim the status of sovereign state governments. They imitate the activities of authorities and the legal procedures typical for democratic countries (elections, referenda etc.). However, neither the DPR nor the LPR has been diplomatically recognized by any of the UN member countries. The leaders of the administrations of these entities (Zakharchenko and Plotnitsky) are signatories under the Minsk I and Minsk II agreements, but without any reference to their posts. Thus, the participants in the peace process recognize these persons as holding authority over the PDDLO de facto. In the resolutions of the Ukrainian Parliament from 2014 and 2015, the PDDLO are considered temporarily occupied territories, the DPR and the LPR are considered terrorist organizations, and the Russian Federation is referred to as the aggressor state. However, these definitions have not been codified into the law of Ukraine. Law enforcement agencies of Ukraine have initiated terrorism criminal cases against the leaders of the DPR and the LPR. Most experts point to the critical dependence of the PDDLO administrations on the Russian Federation and its policymakers. Moscow controls and reshuffles as necessary the leaders of the DPR and the LPR, ensures operational capability of their military forces, and provides logistical support for the PDDLO administrations. Missions of international organizations have noted a total regimentation of social processes and private life of citizens in the occupied territories. Curfew as well as censorship have been imposed, the official propaganda follows the guidelines set by the Russian Federation. Intimidation, torture, hostage-taking, terror, restrictions on freedom of movement, and persecution of minorities are common practice. ««I was going to a meeting in Donetsk, took a photo of the Lenin monument in the downtown with my phone and suddenly saw that a car without license plates was following me. The car stopped on the sidewalk and two militants with guns came out and took me ... One was relatively polite. The second immediately began speaking very roughly ... I pulled the phone, but some officer just took it ... It lasted from 40 minutes to an hour. I stood there, and they kept asking me questions... Once I was released, the polite one told me, using obscenities: «You know, you just have a ‘bad’ passport. Piotr Andrusieczko, journalist"
