        "text": "Address: 39/63, Velyka Perspektyvna Street, Kropyvnytskyi City\n\nCountry: Ukraine\n\nSchool website\n\nProject: School Values Unite Us\n\nWorking language during the project:\n\nUkrainian\n\nThemes of the Council of Europe project “FREE to SPEAK, SAFE to LEARN - Democratic Schools for All” covered:\n\nMaking children’s and students’ voices heard\n\nCompetences from the Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic Culture (CDC) addressed and where / how they were integrated:\n\nResponsibility\n\nWhile taking part in the interactive exercise on choosing values “Game of Senses”, students had to choose the most important values for the whole school community and take the responsibility for their choice.\n\nCo-operation skills\n\nWhile taking part in the exercise “Game of Senses”, students had to choose 5 major values for our school out of 60. The work meant discussion, argumentation and mutual understanding in order to make a decision.\n\nCivic-mindedness\n\nThis was formed during the lessons, extra-curricular activities and through implementing projects on the civic competence.\n\nTarget group age range:\n\n11-15\n\n15-19\n\nLevel of education:\n\nLower secondary education\n\nUpper secondary education\n\nShort description of the project:\n\nDifferent views are held on the priorities of educating students’ at school. In addition, children of different nationalities and social strata study here. Thus, we faced the problem of choosing the most important values of our school community.\n\nWe carried out a survey asking in the form of an exercise “Game of Senses” to determine the opinion of our school community. A consensus building game was played to learn the values that are important to parents, teachers, staff and students.\n\nThe students of Grades 5-11, all students’ parents, teachers and other staff members were involved in the process of defining the school’s values.\n\nOur desire was to harmonise the parents’, teachers’, staff’s and students’ aspirations for the sake of the students’ well-being. We think that choosing and working to common values will benefit the future of our school and community. Each group (parents, students, school staff) defined 5 values which were then discussed at the meeting of the School Council. Using a method of rating by voting, the 5 major values of our school were defined: EDUCATION, RESPECT, HEALTH, RESPONSIBILITY and CULTURE.\n\nUS Peace Corps Volunteers were consultants and observers during the game. We used their advice on the democratic conduct of this procedure. After defining the values, we had some meetings and discussions to agree on a common understanding of them in our school community.\n\nWhile doing this activity such competences as responsibility, co-operation and civic mindedness were instilled among students and staff. We realised that the values chosen by our school community are part of the Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic Culture (CDC).\n\nAt the second stage of our project we had some meetings with the students and presented them the results of the choices made, worked on their critical understanding of those 5 major values and made plans for continuing to develop students’ civic competences.\n\nWe understood that it was necessary to include themes on the development of civic competences into curricular and extra-curricular activities.\n\nSince 2016 our school has taken part in the programme “Democratic School”. We have learnt how to implement interactive exercises and methods of formal assessment. Teachers developed students’ civic competences in different subjects and carried out STEM projects.\n\nWe will continue to work on this project in 2019/2020 school year.\n\nAims/objectives\n\n1. To involve the school community in the project.\n\n2. To get students involved in school activities.\n\n3. To identify priorities in the students’ education and development.\n\n4. To harmonise the aspirations of parents, teachers/staff and students for the benefit of students and the school.\n\nExpected results/outcomes\n\n59 groups comprising 418 students, 351 parents, 76 teachers and 12 school employees took part in the interactive exercise “Game of Senses” to choose the school’s major values.\n\nThe major school values and their common understanding were identified (21 class meetings and 36 parents’ meetings were held).\n\nThe teachers used interactive techniques in their work. 41 exercises for developing civic competences were created in different subjects for lower and upper secondary level students. 3 cross-curricular projects were carried out.\n\nA plan of action was developed for the ongoing development of students’ civic competences.\n\nThe major values of the school were set out in the form of a tag cloud and printed as calendars, which were displayed in each classroom and on the school’s notice boards and information resources.\n\nChanges\n\nSome students and their parents have changed their formal understanding of their role in the school community.\n\nStudents have become equal participants in the school decision-making process.\n\nSome teachers have changed their way of teaching and as a result, students have become more motivated to study. Teachers have shared their successful practices with the colleagues.\n\nOur parents and teachers have agreed on priorities for the students’ education.\n\nChallenges you faced\n\nIt was impossible to involve all the students in the interactive exercise “Game of Senses” (there are more than 900 students at our school).\n\nIt was impossible to conduct the exercise “Game of Senses” in grades 1 – 4, because the teaching method is too difficult for elementary students.\n\nSome of the teachers did not want to spend time during the lesson on developing students’ civic competences, preferring to develop curricular competences.\n\nNot all the teachers find it easy to implement interactive exercises.\n\nTime-frame of the project:\n\n2018-2020\n\nCouncil of Europe materials on citizenship and human rights education used while preparing or implementing your practice:"
