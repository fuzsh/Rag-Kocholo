        "text": "According to Ukrinform, this was reported by the SBU.\n\nThe enemy adjuster was a resident of Kropyvnytskyi. The man tried to install a webcam near one of the bridges to record the schedules of military echelons.\n\nIn case of detection of the rolling stock of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the defendant was to transmit their coordinates online to the aggressor to prepare a targeted attack on the railway line. The Russian invaders hoped to prevent the supply of Ukrainian weapons and ammunition to the frontline of the eastern and southern fronts.\n\nSBU officers were proactive and detained the Russian informant red-handed when he tried to install a webcam near the railway line.\n\nDuring the search, law enforcement officers found a mobile phone on the detainee's person, to which he planned to \"tie in\" a video device to monitor the movement of trains.\n\nThe offender was served a notice of suspicion under Part 3 of Article 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine - unauthorised dissemination of information on the sending, movement of weapons, armaments and ammunition to Ukraine, movement, movement or deployment of the Armed Forces or other military formations formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, committed under martial law. He faces up to 12 years in prison.\n\nThe suspect is in custody.\n\nAs Ukrinform reported, in Kyiv region, the SBU detained a local resident who remotely transmitted the geolocation of Armed Forces of Ukraine units to the Russians during the battles for the capital in March 2022."
