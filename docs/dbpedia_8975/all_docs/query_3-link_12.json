Learn more about the real pearls of the \"agrarian heart of Ukraine\" on the recommendation of YouTube bloggers Max Uzol and Olya Manko\n\nAt first glance, Kirovohrad region has nothing to do with tourism. But this is absolutely not true! Little-known places attract with their magic and tranquility. Here you can feel like real pioneers, enjoy the silence and find harmony with nature\n\nVisit Ukraine's editorial team watched YouTube videos by bloggers Max Uzol and Olya Manko and created a selection of the best places in Kirovohrad region for your travels.\n\nKeep reading and find out about:\n\n1. A unique lavender field that can wipe the nose of even French Provence;\n\n2. A real rough diamond of Kirovohrad region;\n\n3. The birthplace of the famous playwright who created a real oasis in the middle of the steppe.\n\nWe are sure that we will be able to change your idea of Kirovograd region!\n\nTernivka village\n\nTernivka is a village in the Novoarkhangelskyi district of Kirovohrad region that has great potential to become a tourist gem. There is a magnificent building of a water mill on the Syniusa River, which looks more like a castle than an outbuilding.\n\nThe picturesque valley of the Syniukha River with its rocky outcrops, often called a canyon, is fascinating in its beauty. The White Rock, which, despite its name, has a black hue, stands out. The wide steppe expanses with grasses on the high banks create a sense of the grandeur of nature and make people feel their smallness in front of its power.\n\nThe French admire the lavender blossoms, and Ukrainians have their own picturesque places! One of them is the Benchyky Mill, located on the banks of the Syniukha River. This bulky water mill building, which resembles a castle rather than an outbuilding, appeared in the early twentieth century and is still pleasing to the eye.\n\nNear the mill you can see the millstones that have been in use for over 100 years. In the old days, Benchyky Mill was an important economic center of the area, serving the surrounding villages and towns. Today, the mill is a cultural heritage that allows you to learn about history and see how things used to be.\n\nThere are a huge number of installations for photo shoots, a souvenir shop with a wide range of products, and a lovely swing.\n\nYou can stay here in a restored rustic hut that now functions as a hotel. This area will impress you with its color, it's like a real museum of Ukrainian culture and village traditions! Olya Manko's personal recommendation is to try the delicious lemonade!\n\nKropyvnytskyi\n\nYelisavetgrad, Kirovohrad, or Kropyvnytskyi - no matter what this city is called, it always remains beautiful and original. With its interesting history and outstanding people who created it, Kropyvnytskyi fascinates with its atmosphere and architecture. Do not hesitate to take a trip to Kropyvnytskyi if you have the opportunity - it is really worth it!\n\nIn Kropyvnytskyi, you can find many religious buildings of great spiritual and architectural value. Most of them were built in ancient times and bear witness to the city's historical past, its successes and trials.\n\nThe Kirovohrad Academic Ukrainian Music and Drama Theater named after Marko Kropyvnytskyi is one of the most interesting places to visit. This beautiful building, built in 1867, has a fascinating history. In 1882, the first professional realistic theater began operating here under the direction of actor and director Mark Kropyvnytskyi. His production of Natalka Poltavka announced to the world the professionalism and originality of the local theater and Ukrainian theater culture in general. A fountain monument dedicated to Natalka from Kotliarevsky's comedy was erected in front of the theater.\n\nAfter exploring the architectural and historical sights of Kropyvnytskyi, you can relax in the city's cozy parks. The Kropyvnytskyi Arboretum is especially popular, as it enchants with the blooming of thousands of colorful tulips in spring. There are also amusement rides, ice cream and cotton candy shops - everything you need for a great family vacation.\n\nVisit Ukraine on social media: Telegram | YouTube | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok\n\nZlynka village\n\nHere you can get acquainted with a unique location, a place of strength and power - the Kaskady tract.\n\nThe Kaskady tract is a unique location, full of strength and power, located on the Buka River. The Ukrainian crystalline shield, the main tectonic structure of the country, gives the area a special significance and beauty. Irises, Bug tulips and various succulents grow on the banks of the river. Researchers suggest that the caves located on the side of the pond and flooded with water could have been used as a Scythian sanctuary as early as a thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe territory of the Cascades is an example of flat Eastern European landscapes with river valleys in the forest-steppe zone. The tract is also one of the few centers of natural waterfalls in the Prydniprovska Upland and the plain part of Ukraine. The massive granite blocks and migmatites that come to the surface create the impression of a small mountainous country in the middle of the steppe.\n\nThe piles of granite rocks are very picturesque. The blocks resemble the silhouettes of fantastic beasts or giants, or the ruins of ancient fortifications. These ancient landscapes, created by granite rocks, water stretches and vegetation, look very harmonious and give a sense of peace. The Kaskady tract is an ideal place for those who want to experience the greatness of nature and find inner peace.\n\nNadiia Farm\n\nThe Nadiia Farm Reserve-Museum was created on the territory of the estate owned by the prominent playwright and theater figure Ivan Karpenko-Karom. It is located in the village of Mykolayivka, Sokolivska territorial community of Kropyvnytskyi district. It was here that Karpenko-Kary spent years creating a real oasis in the middle of the steppe.\n\nThe estate was founded in 1871 by the playwright's father, Karpo Tobilevych, and named in honor of his wife, Nadiia Tarkovska. It was here that Karpenko-Kary wrote 11 of his 18 plays, including One Hundred Thousand and The Host. The estate complex includes a parental house, a memorial house, a literary and memorial museum, an 11-hectare park-monument of landscape art, and a horseshoe-shaped pond.\n\nAn interesting fact is that Karpenko-Kary always dreamed of having his own park of century-old oaks. That's why he asked all his guests (poets, playwrights and other prominent personalities) to plant oaks. Now there is a whole alley of mighty trees named after Rylsky, Zankovetska, Saksahanskii, and others.\n\nWe remind you! Are you planning a summer trip? Zhytomyr region will definitely surprise you! Tereshchenko's palaces, incredible quarries, and other interesting sights await tourists here. Read more about the real pearls of Zhytomyr region on the recommendation of YouTube bloggers Max Uzol and Olya Manko."
