        "text": "Kropyvnytskyi (Ukrainian: Кропивницький; formerly: Yelisavetgrad, Kirovohrad) is the administrative center of Kirovohrad Oblast (province, also referred to as Kirovohradschyna) and Kirovohrad Rayon (district). It is an industrial and cultural center of Kirovohrad Oblast. Kropyvnytskyi is located on the Dnieper Upland, on the banks of river Inhul. It is a motorway junction. There is a train station (Znamyanka - Pomoshnaya line) and a civilian airport. Kropyvnytskyi is not famous for its places of interest, but the downtown still bears the remnants of old architecture. Some of the old buildings are renovated and some are still in the process of renovation. The city administration is doing a good job of making Kropyvnytskyi a better place both for locals and tourists. The locals like to call Kropyvnytskyi \"a little Paris\" due to its resemblance to Paris before the Soviet Union have destroyed the look of the city in the 20th century.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nKropyvnytskyi was founded in 1754 as Yelisavetgrad (usually spelled Elisavetgrad or Elizabethgrad in English language publications). From the middle of 19th century till the beginning of the 20th century, Kropyvnytskyi enjoyed its golden age. The industry was on the increase, the culture flourished. It was there where the first professional Ukrainian theater was opened.\n\nKropyvnytskyi became the center of Kirovohrad oblast in 1939. The city has a developed social infrastructure and a number of educational and cultural institutions.\n\nKropyvnytskyi's geographical position has an impact on language. The most commonly spoken language is Russian and \"surzhyk\" (a mix of Russian and Ukrainian languages). Everyone can speak and understand Ukrainian. The knowledge of English is low, but it won't be a problem in hotels or restaurants where most people can speak decent English.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Due to the state of war, Ukraine's airspace has been closed to civil aviation. (Information last updated 19 Sep 2023)\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nInternational buses: Chișinău (two daily)\n\nThere are lots of buses from other Ukrainian cities. It's easy to pay for a ticket online. For that purpose it is advised to use special website.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nM-13 and M-12 highways go through Kropyvnytskyi. M12 is a state international highway (M-highway) that connects Lviv Oblast to the Central Ukraine, where before crossing Dnieper it continues further as M04. M13 is a state international highway connecting Kropyvnytskyi to the border with Moldova, where before crossing Dniester it heads towards Chișinău as part of E584.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nBy public transport\n\n[edit]\n\nKropyvnytskyi has a convenient public transport system:\n\n11 bus routes\n\n8 trolleybus routes\n\n18 marshrutka routes\n\nSingle ride tickets in buses cost 7 грн, in trolleybuses — 6 грн, in marshrutkas — 10 грн.\n\nSchedules are available in the official Telegram channel (in Ukrainian), on the map (in Ukrainian), and on rozklad.in.ua (in Ukrainian).\n\nYou can also check information about public transport on EasyWay and Google Maps.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxi is the easiest way of getting around the city.

There is a big number of pizzerias - oddly, locals have more pizzerias than anything else, and any other cuisine is practically ignored. The food is usually tasty and fresh. It is strongly advised to taste the national cuisine. Most famous dishes are borshch, vareniki, draniki (also called deruny).\n\nIn the centre there are a lot of cafes with good prices.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]"
