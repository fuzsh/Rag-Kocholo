        "text": "The dynamics of the system of cities in Russia in 1989–2010 is analyzed based on the population census data in 1989, 2002, and 2010, as well as the current population register. The extent of the decline or less often of the increase of the population size are considered for cities of different sizes for each intercensal period (1989–2002 and 2002–2010) and factors contributing to this are noted. The change in the population size of cities is analyzed, depending on their size and geographical location, expressed in the distance to the center of the federal subject. It turned out that in the 1990s and in the 2000s, the population of cities of dif ferent sizes, but located at a distance of up to 50 km from the regional center increased, and at greater dis tances the dynamics were not so welldefined. The dependence of the growth/decline of the population of cities on their size is more variable: the population of cities of different sizes both grew and declined. The dynamics of the natural increase and migration increase of cities with different sizes of population show that the higher the population size the greater the importance of migration increase as a compensator of natural decrease.\n\nThe aim of the study is to present the changes in the population and its demographic structure in Ukraine compared to other European post-communist countries. Classic demographic indicators were applied. In comparison to other analyzed countries, Ukraine has an average pace of population decline, a low aging rate and a persistently clear advantage of the number of women over men. This is the result of all three factors: loss of part of the territory with the population inhabiting it, natural decrease and negative migration balance.\n\nThe period between the 1959 and 1970 Soviet censuses represents one of stability insofar as demographic processes have not been disturbed by external factors, in contrast to the upheavals during and after the 1939-1945 war. Nevertheless, basic population structures, in particular the varying levels of urbanization, have been modified by internal migration of people from the countryside to the industrial towns. Consequently in European Russia rural areas, while increasing their population in absolute terms, have suffered severe losses in favour of the expanding industrial zones, especially the Ukraine and the lower Volga region. Methods of calculating this change must involve careful scrutiny of the data and also an appreciation of settlement patterns as well as purely demographic features.\n\nA significant decline in Ukraine’s population is mainly due to its natural decrease, which began in the 1970s and 1980s in the rural areas and had been determined by the objective trends in demographic transition, the inertia effect of the demographic losses in the past and the social policy of the political regime at that time. Likewise, the social and economic crisis of the 1990s deepened the depopulation processes. In the present research, correlation analysis demonstrated a relationship between the current dimensions of natural population decline and a number of socio-demographic factors (proportion of the rural population, mean age of the population, divorce rate and the mean age at first marriage). In recent years, the effects of the demographic crisis have been particularly acute in North-eastern and Central Ukraine, due to the deepening disproportions in the age and sex structures of the population. However, in the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, and in some western regions, the n...\n\nThis paper is devoted to the generalization of the tendencies in demographic transition in Ukraine and the analysis of the consequences of economic and social development and its impact on the depopulation phenomenon. Different profiles of the mortality were revealed. Economic and political events of 2014 that took place in Ukraine dropped the minimum monthly wage to its historically minimum level, causing the migration and immigration of the labor force and depopulation aggravation.\n\nThe paper is devoted to the ethnic and linguistic composition of Ukrainian urban population of the Russian empire. It deals with the statistical data, including the results of both Imperial census of 1897 and the local censuses, which were held in some Ukrainian towns during the 1870s. This comparison is important for understanding the consequences of the cultural assimilation policy pursued by the Imperial authorities as well as the social and political causes of the urban population structure transformation. The author discusses reasons why the percent of Ukrainians in the total amount of the urban population decreased significantly by the end of the 19th century. Published in: Codrul Cosminului. 2016.
