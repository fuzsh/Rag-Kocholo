        "text": "Wed, Nov 25, 2015 08:10 CET Report this content\n\nWorld’s first Collective Creativity game that connects social players with an App. Play & discover new games, Together!\n\nA well-known book by the German-born Swiss writer Hermann Hesse ‘The Glass Bead Game’ has inspired the innovator Martins Jansons to come up with world’s first Collective Creativity game that connects social players with an App. The model is novel in the history of games and solves the problem of sophisticated game publishing for hobbyists. “Be inspired by The Glass Bead Game” can now be supported collectively on Kickstarter, starting 24 November 2015.\n\nAnalogue gaming environment is married with information technology to give players freedom of expression. The catalogue includes most of beloved board game classics such as checkers and tic-tac-toe to enjoy entertainment with friends and family. Playful learning games for kids support creative skill and memory training, containing arithmetic, music, storytelling, geography, flora & fauna and other subjects of fundamental knowledge. As a tool it can be used for psychological cognition and enterprise gamification — a new must-have office-game to engage teams and take better decisions while planning projects or analysing a business. Printed game sets work as extensions for each of the use cases.\n\n“A trained game-thinking is a useful skill in our everyday lives, perceiving situations or creating paths for our success. Game is a social playground to develop that skill and discovered the legend together! ” Says Martins Jansons.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the game is to inspire players to create. The beads on 6 x 6 grid game boards and two dice are perfect elements to stimulate imagination. Game is an open-ended solution that activates visual thinking and logics enabling players to discover endless combinations of rules and game mechanics. The game App allows players to connect with like-minded and join teams of game collaborators, invite others to play and co-create.\n\nWith the publishing of the game, Martins Jansons congratulates the great author on his 70th anniversary of receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nwww.theglassbeadgames.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7swBP0amiw\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/b-game/be-inspired-by-the-glass-bead-game\n\nTAGS: GAMES, BOARD GAMES, ENTERTAINMENT, LIFESTYLE, LEISURE, CREATIVITY, PLAYFUL LEARNING, FAMILY AND PARENTING, KIDS EDUCATION, PRODUCTIVITY TOOLS, ENTERPRISE GAMIFICATION, OFFICE GAMES, SERIOUS GAMES, CROWDFUNDING, COLLECTIVE CREATIVITY, THE GLASS BEAD GAME, HERMANN HESSE, LITERATURE, NOBEL PRIZE, INNOVATION, CREATORS LIFE\n\nADEPTS CREATIVE INDUSTRIES\n\n71-75 Shelton Street Covent Garden\n\nLondon WC2H 9JQ UNITED KINGDOM\n\n44 (0) 7497 188 117\n\nmartins@adepts.org\n\n71-75 Shelton Street Covent Garden\n\nLondon WC2H 9JQ UNITED KINGDOM\n\n44 (0) 7497 188 117\n\nmartins@adepts.org"
