        "text": "The Glass Bead Game, final novel by Hermann Hesse, published in two volumes in 1943 in German as Das Glasperlenspiel and sometimes translated as Magister Ludi. The book is an intricate bildungsroman about humanity’s eternal quest for enlightenment and for synthesis of the intellectual and the active life.\n\nSet in the 23rd century, the novel purports to be a biography of Josef Knecht, who has been reared in Castalia, the remote place his society has provided for the intellectual elite to grow and flourish. Since childhood, Knecht has been consumed with mastering the Glass Bead Game, which requires a synthesis of aesthetics and scientific arts, such as mathematics, music, logic, and philosophy. This he achieves in adulthood, becoming a Magister Ludi (Master of the Game)."
