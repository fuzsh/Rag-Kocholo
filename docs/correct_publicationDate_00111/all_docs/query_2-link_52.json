        "text": "Summary\n\nThe Glass Bead Game, for which Hesse won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946, is the authorâs last and crowning achievement, the most imaginative and prophetic of all his novels. Setting the story in the distant postapocalyptic future, Hesse tells of an elite cult of intellectuals who play an elaborate game that uses all the cultural and scientific knowledge of the Ages. The Glass Bead Game is a fascinating tale of the complexity of modern life as well as a classic of modern literature.\n\nThis edition features a Foreword by Theodore Ziolkowski that places the book in the full context of Hesseâs thought."
