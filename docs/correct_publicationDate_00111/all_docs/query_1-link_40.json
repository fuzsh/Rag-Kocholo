        "text": "The Glass Bead Game, for which Hesse won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946, is the authors last and crowning achievement, the most imaginative and prophetic of all his novels. Setting the story in the distant postapocalyptic future, Hesse tells of an elite cult of intellectuals who play an elaborate game that uses all the cultural and scientific knowledge of the Ages. The Glass Bead Game is a fascinating tale of the complexity of modern life as well as a classic of modern literature.\n\nThis edition features a Foreword by Theodore Ziolkowski that places the book in the full context of Hesses thought.\n\nHermann Hesse was born in Germany in 1877 and later became a citizen of Switzerland. As a Western man profoundly affected by the mysticism of Eastern thought, he wrote many novels, stories, and essays that bear a vital spiritual force that has captured the imagination and loyalty of many generations of readers. His works include Steppenwolf, Narcissus and Goldmund, and The Glass Bead Game. Hesse was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946. He died in 1962.\n\nThe final novel of Hermann Hesse, The Glass Bead Game, is a fascinating tale of the complexity of modern life as well as a classic of modern literature.\n\nSet in the twenty-third century, The Glass Bead Game is the story of Joseph Knecht, who has been raised in Castilla, the remote place his society has provided for the intellectual elite to grow and flourish. Since childhood, Knecht has been consumed with mastering the Glass Bead Game, which required a synthesis of aesthetics and philosophy, which he achieves in adulthood, becoming a Magister Ludi (Master of the Game)."
