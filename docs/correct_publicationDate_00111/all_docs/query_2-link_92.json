        "text": "Perspective Broadening Fiction\n\nI read in sequence - something for pure entertainment followed by something that might expand my horizons. This time about it was the latter and I chose The Glass Bead Game by Herman Hesse, a German writer who I had encountered many years before with Siddhartha, an account of a man seeking spiritual enlightenment during the time of the Buddha. The book possessed me, thrilled me and I always meant to read more Hesse but didn't until I came across The Glass Bead Game at a stall at the Cambridge Trash and Treasure market this winter gone. I looked it up on my phone and it said 'speculative fiction'. I like this genre so purchased it and recently settled in to read it.\n\nIt's an epic and episodic account of one man's journey through time (reincarnation) as he seeks to fulfil his inclinations. The novel explores eastern and western esoteric philosophy, rational intellectualism, all shades of human nature while addressing the rise of fascism in Europe (it was written between 1931 and 1942). On this last note Hesse offers some especially potent insights into the phenomenon that drives mass hysteria. Perhaps the best of which describes Trump. Basically: when people are confused they will mostly always choose the easy charms of the snake oil peddler over solutions with a more rational bent. Of course he explains why but there is no need for me to get any deeper into that here.\n\nNot the easiest book but I endured and am glad I did, I felt especially fulfilled by the experience, which probed at my psyche and asked me again and again to examine myself: my inclinations, faults and strengths.The Glass Bead Game provokes the reader to examine our individual 'truth' and to be honest about that examination.\n\nPerhaps the best way I can describe The Glass Bead Game is to say it is a compendium of esoteric wisdom aka The Upanishads, The Bhagavad Gita, The Tao Te Ching and their western equivalents, restructured for a 'modern'; audience. A novel that explores the art and value of emotional, intellectual and spiritual transformation and how to apply it in meaningful way, The Glass Bead Game is magnificent, bold, prescient, sagacious.......a genuine masterwork.\n\nUpon completion I could not help but think of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, another episodic and epic account of an individuals journey through time in search of meaning and fulfilment. This is one of my all-time favourite novels and the two books share enough to make me wonder if The Glass Bead Game inspired Mitchell?"
