        "text": "Dear Kiki,\n\nThe mark mentioned I believe to be a quasi-real one, as such distinctions are common, yet unspoken in reality. The little child that no one will play with, the outcast. Often, it is a mark of intelligence, as Demain reveals.\n\nPersonally, I have always seen Hesse writing himself into the part of Emil Sinclair. This is the only character that he goes to the trouble to build up over the course of the book; he doesn't bother to develop fully Frau Eva or Demain. He also makes all sorts of statements, very personal statements, that I believe corresponded to himself. \"Quite frequently I considered myself a genius, just as often, crazy.\"\n\nI don't think he was a pantheist, that is a literal interpretation of Abraxas. I think that he was actually Atheist, and that Abraxas was simply a metaphor for the realm of the world and reality. This is my interpretation of it, at least.\n\nI have found that Hesse's views change over the years, perhaps as he discovered new ideas and progressed further in his own self discovery. But one word of warning, do not read Siddhartha right after Demian, as I did, and I was sadly disappointed. But it is interesting to see the way Hesse shapes his novels upon his changing life, and the transition through them.\n\nI'd like to bring up a new point here: Do you think that Demain and Frau Eva were real or just figments of Sinclair's imagination? I have discussed this at length with a friend, and we are undecided so far. I would enjoy someone else's input.\n\nI too, think that Hesse deserves much more credit than he has been given, especially for Demian. It seems strange that my favorite of his works goes so ignored. This book literally changed my life. In a time where I needed it, it found me. I credit two things for my present day state of sanity, one is Demian, and the other is a friend who took on some strangely Demain-like characteristics in my life.\n\nIt's always nice to hear that other people enjoyed this book as much as I did. I look forward to any comments.\n\nEileen\n\nHi Eileen,\n\nDemian and The Glass Bead Game are two of my favorite novels, both from Hesse and overall. I wanted to respond specifically to your question whether \"Demian and Frau Eva were real\".\n\nThis is a question which has long engaged scholars and critics. One of Hesse's best known researchers, Ralph Freedman, wrote a book some time ago which defined a genre of fiction he called the \"lyrical novel.\" In such novels--and for his study he used the works of Hesse, Virginia Woolf, and Andre Gide--he argues that their authors extended some characteristics of the lyrical poem to fictional prose. In this type of fiction the central character is shown to reconcile his/her internal conflicts by projecting them outside of himself/herself. Characters in such novels are therefore really projections of corresponding aspects of the central character's self.\n\nIn this sense, then, Emil Sinclair is almost the only \"real\" character in the whole novel, or at least he is \"more real\" than any of the others. The others--Kromer, Pistorius, Max Demian, etc.--are simply different stages of Sinclair's maturation.\n\nHello Eileen,\n\nI should check this message board more frequently, thank you for your thoughtful post. It is of my opinion that Frau Eva is an idealistic vision and not a real woman. I agree that Sinclair very much resembles Hesse.\n\nAs much as he speaks of God, I think Hesse is probably Atheist also. This is further developed in Narcissus and Goldmund, which actually begins in a monastery, but takes on other directions in the course of the novel.\n\nI just finished Narcissus and Goldmund. It was published five years after Demian, and goes into the differences that make up the intellectual and the artist. It is a very romantic and passionate work, much more sexy than Demian, but also laced with philosophy and a quiet knowing that comes very close to being Buddhist without really being that at all. I don't have the need to pick Narcissus and Goldmund to pieces, like I did with Demian.\n\nI don't want to know the philosophy behind it so much anymore, the book is a work of art. I feel that I understand it on a level that I'm not going to mess up with words.\n\nIf you liked Demian, if you have ever had anything to do with the world of art, if you have ever had a tension between the physical and the spiritual realms, then you should treat yourself to Narcissus and Goldmund. It is the best book I've ever read. If however, I'd read this ten years ago, I don't think it would have had the impact on me that it now has. I doubt that a child could fully understand the richness of this lovely book."
