        "text": "Hardcover. Condition: Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. Alan Tunbridge (Jacket design) (illustrator). First UK Edition. First UK edition, translated from the German by Richard and Clara Winston. The book was originally published as \"Das Glasperlenspiel\" in Switzerland in 1943, and in English translation as \"Magister Ludi\" by Aldus Publications in 1949. With the striking dust-jacket illustration after the manner of medieval iconographers by Alan Tunbridge. ***Please note that this is an ex-library copy. ***A good only copy in blue paper over black cloth-covered boards with gilt titles to the spine. The gilt is still beautifully bright, having been protected by the dustwrapper. The boards have tape off-setting marks from where the dustwrapper had been taped to the boards by the library. There is also a closed tear to the thin blue paper covering on the front board caused by removal of the tape. The spine is slightly creased and curved from reading. Corners sharp. Top edge of page block stained mauve by the publisher - now faded. Internally the book has the following library marks: tears to the thin black paper on the front pastedown and endpaper where library sheets have been removed, Hammersmith Public Libraries punched stamp to the edge of the title page and p.21/22, ink stamps at the top of the printer's page, small round library stamps to the first and last pages of text. No other obvious marks. No foxing to interior pages. Pages clean. No creases or tears. ***In a very good illustrated dustwrapper, which has been corner price-clipped by the publisher, with a new £6.95 net price sticker affixed. The dustwrapper is complete, with just minor rubbing to the extremities. No chips or tears. No creases other than to the edges of the foldover flaps where they have been taped to the boards. No fading. Dustwrapper bright. ***224mm x 140mm. 558 pages. ***'Hermann Karl Hesse (2 Jul 1877 - 9 Aug 1962) was a German-born Swiss poet, novelist, and painter. His best-known works include Demian, Steppenwolf, Siddhartha, and The Glass Bead Game, each of which explores an individual's search for authenticity, self-knowledge and spirituality. In 1946, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature.' [Wiki] ***'A new translation by Richard and Clara Winston - Hermann Hesse's novel \"The Glass Bead Game\" was first published in 1946 - (this is incorrect - was 1943) - and shortly afterwards the great German émigré-writer was awarded the Nobel Prize. This book, which is considered his magnum opus, has never, until now, been available in an English translation which conveyed its power, profundities and wit.' (Quote taken from the front flap of the dustwrapper) ***'The Glass Bead Game - A tentative sketch of the life of Magister Ludi Joseph Knecht together with Knecht's posthumous writings edited by Hermann Hesse.' (Quote taken from preliminary pages) ***A fourth printing of the first UK edition, in its attractive illustrated dustwrapper, in ex-library condition. These Cape hardcover editions of Hermann Hesse's works are very hard to find now, and the dustwrappers are very prone to curling, tearing and chipping. Ironically, being a library copy, the dustwrapper has been well-preserved. The author's Utopian masterpiece; one of the outstanding works of 20th century European literature. All hardcover editions are uncommon. ***For all our books, postage is charged at cost, allowing for packaging: any shipping rates indicated on ABE are an average only: we will reduce the P & P charge where appropriate - please contact us for postal rates for heavier books and sets etc."
