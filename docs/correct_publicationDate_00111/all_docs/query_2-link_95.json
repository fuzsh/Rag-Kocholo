        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nCONCLUSION APOCALIPSIS CUM FIGURIS : THOMAS MANN AND THE BILDUNGSROMAN AT THE ENDS OF TIME On July 2, 1947, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung published a short essay celebrating the seventieth birthday of the novelist Hermann Hesse, written by his friend and colleague Thomas Mann. Mann spends most of his time discussing Hesse’s novel The Glass Bead Game, which had appeared in 1943 and to which Mann refers not only as a “work of old age” (Alterswerk), but also as a “late work of dangerously advanced spiritualization.”1 Such descriptions might appear cruelly inappropriate given the occasion, but it is important to remember that Mann ultimately always meant himself when he was talking about other writers. Indeed, seventieth birthdays formed a neuralgic point of sorts for the German author, who had once predicted that he himself would die at that age—and who almost seemed disappointed when the event came and went in 1945 without any attending fatal accident. It thus should have surprised no one when Mann, only a few months after his laudatory article, published his own “work of old age”: a “glass bead game played with black pearls,” as he inscribed his presentation copy to Hesse. The novel in question, of course, was Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkühn as Told by a Friend. If Mann’s use of the epithet Alterswerk can be justified by pointing to the mature age that both Hesse and his reviewer had reached at this point in their lives, his reference to a “dangerously advanced spiritualization,” operative not only in The Glass Bead Game, but also, one infers, in Doctor Faustus, seems to set up entirely different terms. Something larger is at stake here, something having to do with the spirit of the times, from which both of the modernist masters draw and which they, in turn, shape through their works. Thomas Mann’s exegetes were quick to pick up on this dimension. One of the earliest responses to his novel, Erich Kahler’s “The Secularization of the Devil” (1948), already refers to the “final chapter of a terminal oeuvre” and praises Mann for having brought the “representative symbol, not only of German but of Western culture, up to date.”2 Georg Lukács and Hans Mayer, writing from the Marxist tradition, speak of an “epilogue to the whole [bourgeois] development after 1848” and of a book “that dissolve[s] the form of the bourgeois novel.”3 These latter two formulations express a view of the modernist novel that already informed Walter Benjamin’s critique of Döblin, and that regards the increasingly digressive works of that period as a natural antithesis to the novels built around strong characters that were produced in the nineteenth century, the Bildungsroman in particular. On this view, a view that continues to inform standard genre surveys, the novels of Mann and Hesse form the logical endpoint of the Bildungsroman tradition as a whole. And yet one need not turn to grand arguments about the rise and fall of bourgeois culture to understand that there is a more immediate occasion for the artistic endgame presented in Doctor Faustus: 1945, the year of Mann’s seventieth birthday, may have come and gone without his death, but it did see the demise of the Third Reich, an event that the author actively hastened through his work as a political essayist and broadcaster for the BBC, even as he looked into the future with skepticism and anxiety. Doctor Faustus again and again announces itself as a work that deliberates on the consequences of an absolute annihilation—not only materially, but also culturally—and inquires into the role that literary narration might play in circumventing this crisis. Serenus Zeitblom, wondering whether any of his manuscript pages will survive the aerial bombardment of the Allies, is a transparent cipher for Thomas Mann, not at all convinced that future generations will still turn to his stories, just as Zeitblom’s resolve to tell Leverkühn’s story despite the fact that nobody performs his compositions mirrors Mann’s unwavering fealty to German culture even in the face of its perversion through Hitler. The basic dilemma that informed Mann’s thinking during this period—the realization that everything that presently existed in Germany would have to come to an end in order to allow Germany to once again live—finds expression in a powerful temporal metaphor in the novel: that of the apocalypse, alluded to again and again..."
