        "text": "The Glass Bead Game, for which Hesse won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946, was the author's last and crowning achievement, the most imaginative and prophetic of all his novels. It is the evolution - and resolution - of the terrors and dilemmas of Steppenwolf, Demian, and Siddhartha. Setting this story in some distant, post-World War III future, Hesse tells of an elite cult of intellectuals occupying themselves with an elaborate game that employs all of the cultural and scientific knowledge of the ages. Described by Thomas Mann as a \"treasure of purest thought,\" admired by Andr√© Gide and T.S. Eliot, this prophetic novel has striking contemporary application and is the key to a full understanding of Hesse's thought."
