        "text": "This research study consists on the validation of the physically and distributed hydrological model, throw the application of the ATHYS platform for hydrological modeling, for the case study of a catchment area situated in the left bank of the high valley of the Medjerda basin, the catchment area of the Raghay wadi having an area of approximately 322 km². This watershed is characterized by a very important morphological, climatic and physical variability in time and space, often presenting very important floods because of the not measured flow coming from the Algerian frontier part instead of the large difference of atitude from 165 to 1180 in the Tunisian part. The choice is fixed on six events distributed over three different seasons, recorded on the level of two pluviographic stations for an hour time-step and which control the flow in the discharge system of the catchment area. The parameters of entry of the GREEN and AMPT production function are maps having the variability of the physical parameters of the soil as well as the variation of altitude and of the directions of drainage. The advantage of this function is related on its physical base, and the theoretical possibility to estimate and optimize the parameters starting from data of grounds or “in situ” measurements. The evaluated criteria for optimization are the Nash criteria which is varying between 0.73 and 0.98 for the calibration phase, and between 0.62 and 0.75 for the validation for the three seasons, instead of the Arithmetic Mean Error for the volume and the peak flow giving very good errors for the Wintry season, good errors for the Autumnal season and medium errors for the Springer season. The results of simulations show that the selected model is well validated for the Raghay catchment than, its performance in the comprehension of the hydrological answer of a Mediterranean watershed, which provide important information for decision makers in order of protection against floods of the area\n\nThis study aims to compare the performance of two hydrological models, conceptual (HEC-HMS) and spatial (ATHYS) on the Aguibat Ezziar watershed. The comparative analysis is based on the performances of simulation in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe and RSR. The study requires the collection of a series of data as inputs models namely rainfall data, water quantity, soil occupation, DTM and requires also a calibration in order to evaluate these models in validation phase. The simulation results were obtained from the validation phase aiming to replicate the operation of watershed Aguibat Ezziar, and present a suitable adjustment perspective of the observed hydrograph. These results show that the objective is achieved and a model distributed like ATHYS plays an effective role to improve the efficiency and present a high advantage in anticipation of runoff volume comparing with other models.\n\nIn developing countries, the use of mathematical models in hydrological forecasting is increasing, making for optimal planning and management of water resources systems. Such application, however, faces different problems. One of these problems is that computers may not be available. Even if they are available, computer time is expensive. Hence, there is a need for simple models which can be run on pocket calculators or which are computer-time efficient, with high accuracy. This paper presents a rainfall-runoff model with a very simple structure. With simple algorithms, the model can be used with computers with small memory capacity. A method for estimating mean areal rainfall, representing the detailed distribution of rain over an area, is also put forward. The model has been applied to a small, mainly rural catchment in northern Tunisia for both single rainfall event simulation and continuous simulation for longer periods. The outcome was most encouraging. In the present paper the measured and calculated streamflows are presented and discussed.Dans les pays en voie de développement, l'emploi de modèles mathématiques pour la prévision hydrologique se généralise. Cette application, cependant, rencontre un bon nombre de problèmes différents. Les ordinateurs y sont rares, et s'ils sont disponibles, l'heure de calcul est coûteuse. Par conséquent, il y a besoin de modèles simples, qui peuvent être mis en oeuvre sur des calculatrices de poche ou qui exigent peu de temps de calcul, avec une grand exactitude. Un modèle pluie-écoulement qui remplit ces conditions est présenté dans cet article. Ayant des algorithmes simple, le modèle peut être utilisé sur les ordinateurs avec une faible capacité de stockage. Une méthode pour estimer la pluie moyenne spatiale, représentant la distribution détaillée de la pluie sur une surface, est aussi présentée. Le modèle a été appliqué â un petit bassin, principalement rural, dans le nord de la Tunisie pour la simulation des pluies isolés et pour des simulations continues pour des périodes longues. Les résultats ont été très encourageants. Dans cet article, les débits observés et calculés sont présentés et discutés."
