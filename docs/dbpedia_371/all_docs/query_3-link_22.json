It might be a case where Clive Davis did not deserve star billing. Or should he have been billed at all? The third paragraph of a press statement concerning the two year old grand jury investigation of the music industry mentions the name Clive J. Davis and later the fact that he will be indicted for failing to report taxable income, darkly hinting that he faces a possible 24 years imprisonment and a $45,000 fine. Elsewhere in the statement are charges of fraud, payola, perjury, conspiracy involving other individuals and record companies, and not Davis. But the grand jury makes Davis -—and this was followed up in the same way by the consumer media — the star. It may be that Davis is the most visible and newsworthy person indicted, and he himself has certainly made his presence felt during the two year investigation, but the plain fact remains that he is up before the grand jury for income tax evasion only. Davis issued a statement himself after Goldstein’s conference. It said in part: “For two years my family and I have suffered from malicious rumors and insinuations growing out of the investigation of the record industry.” Those rumors and insinuations over the past 24 months have linked the Davis name with everything from organized crime to drug peddling. Finally when the grand jury hands down the indictment, Davis, who maintains his innocence, is hit with the less dramatic charge of tax evasion. But individuals and companies accused of the conspiracy, the payola, the fraud charges all take second billing to Davis, because, obviously, the grand jury knows the publicity value of Davis’ name. Indeed it could be argued that Davis’ name, in view of the fact that he was not brought upon payola or any of the other charges involving fraud (and for which he was investigated), should not have been used for its obvious publicity value as an attraction for the public media. Or should it have been included at all within this context? However, if proven, all the charges laid down by the grand jury will pose a serious treat to the moral health of the music industry, particularly, as was stated this week, because the investigation is ongoing and nationwide. It is certainly not something to be taken lightly or covered up. Housecleaning within the industry, if it has to be done, should be.

The Capitol contract, which com- menced November 21, 1972, provides for the recording of two albums per year over a three-year term, with a total guarantee against royalties of $3,000,000.

Although the word \"drugola\" and talk of drug peddling for disk jockey favors was bandied about throughout the busi- ness as a result of numerous consumer press articles alluding to such goings on in the industry, the indictments made no mention of drugs whatsoever. It also was of great interest to the trade that there seemed to be almost two separate parts to the indictments, even though the grand juries issued them in one blanket statement. Clive Davis, who, during the past two years was torn apart with innuendoes in the consumer press as having been in- volved in drug deals, payola and every other conceivable evil, was indicted in the southern district of New York on charges of failing to report over $90,000 in taxable income on which over $45,000 in income taxes were due during the years 1970 thru 1972, and for filing false income tax returns for the same years. These charges appeared to be the same as the charges CBS brought against Davis in a civil suit charging misap- propriation of company funds when he was president of CBS Records . . . funds which Davis allegedly used to pay for the decoration of his apartment as well as for NEW YORK — \"This is just what the record industry needs . . summarizes the basic feelings of all record industry execs who read the accounts of the in- dictments handed down last week by the federal grand juries sitting in Newark. \"It's so difficult now to get anything played on radio but the giant hits by the superstars, imagine what it’s going to be like after the news hits the streets,” was the way a number of people felt about the effect of the indictments on the record business in general. The fact that United States attorneys Jonathan L. Goldstein (N.J.); Robert Cur- ran (eastern district of Pa.) and William D. Keller (central district of Calif.) who handed down the indictments in Newark at a press conference last week, said that their investigation will continue and be on-going in each of their districts, left most industry brass with the feeling that such news might put a continuing damper on the record industry and deter the breaking of new talent. It is no secret that during the past year, because of the difficulties the nation’s economy has been going through, record manufacturers have been hard- pressed to watch costs and overhead. Unemployment has been much higher than the national average among teenag- ers, college graduates and blacks. In inviting guests to a bar mitzvah banquet. Although many others were charged with many other forms of criminal wrong- doing the above were the only charges against Davis, leading many industry figures to state that his name was blanketed with all of the others under the general charges because he was the best known figure on the consumer level. And it resulted in one edition of a New York newspaper featuring Davis' photo on the front page of an early edi- tion announcing the indictments. An official response by Davis to the in- dictments was the following: \"For two years my family and I have suffered from malicious rumors and insinuations grow- ing out of the investigation of the record industry. The indictment against me to- day clearly establishes that all those rumors and insinuations were false. \"What is involved are tax charges. The issues are apparently the same as those raised in the CBS civil suit against me which was brought over two years ago. I am innocent of those charges, and I shall respond to those issues at the ap- propriate time and place.\" Alan Hirschfield, president of Colum- bia Pictures Corp., parent company of Arista Records of which Clive Davis is now president, issued a statement noting that Davis had not been charged with any alleged payola or \"other similar matters. \" He added: “Columbia fully intends to continue its relationship with Mr. Davis as president of its Arista Records sub- sidiary.” But the surprising lack of news in the indictment against Davis in no way offset the impact on the industry of the charges against other execs and companies. The federal grand jury sitting in Newark indicted Nat Tarnopol of Bruns- wick and Dakar Records on charges of many areas with a large black population, unemployment has been quoted in the 20% plus range. The volume of big hits, possibly because of the increased cost to the consumer of singles and LPs in com- bination with the unemployment factor, has been down considerably. During the past two years, since word was out that grand juries across the U.S. were investigating the record industry for criminal wrong-doings, bribery, etc., there has been a noticeable tightening of playlists at the radio level. Whether this was attributable to the threat of in- vestigation hanging over the heads of radio executives or just some reflection of the general economic slowdown is hard to define. One aspect of the revelations alleged by the grand jury has been the somewhat low key approach by the media, particularly in view of the relish that some of the more investigative reporters on newspapers attacked the story when it first broke two years ago. The grand jury proceedings were reported but the matter appears to have rested with that for now. Perhaps the influx of scandal from Watergate to the CIA that the public has had drummed into its consciousness over the past two years makes the troubles of the recording business — if any — seem like small potatoes. conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and evasion of personal and corporate taxes. Charged with Tarnopol on the con- spiracy, mail and wire fraud counts of the indictment are other officers and employees of Brunswick and Dakar: Pete Garris, Carl Davis, Irving Wiegan, Lee Shep and Melvin Moore. The indictment also names as a defendant Carmine DeNoia, also known as Doc Wassel, who sold various items of merchandise in- cluding Brunswick and Dakar records. All seven Brunswick personnel were charged by the grand jury with \"having devised and executed a scheme where- by Brunswick and Dakar Records would, continued on pg. 8 MCA, Legend Ink Long Term Deal HOLLYWOOD — MCA Records, Inc. and Legend Records, Ltd. have signed a long term production and distribution agree- ment announced Mike Maitland, presi- dent of MCA Records and Bruce Allen, managing director of Legend Records. The agreement calls for the exclusive services of Randy Bachman as producer of artists on the Legend label. The first product to be released, under this agreement will be an album by Trooper.

Sets Dylan ‘ Basement ’ LP NEW YORK — Columbia Records is re- leasing Bob. Dylan and The Band's \"Basement Tapes” LP at the beginning of July. The two-record set contains material recorded in sessions held between June and October in the Band's “Big Pink” upstate New York home, in- cluding among the 24 songs several tunes/performances which have been thus far unavailable, even on bootleg LPs. According to Columbia, all the tunes were cut live, and there has been no overdubbing. The album was re- mastered for the upcoming release. The recording sessions which resulted in the “Basement Tapes” took place following Dylan and The Band's 1 966 na- tional tour, and the personnel on the album are: Bob Dylan, Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm. According to Columbia vice president and general manager Bruce Lundvall, \"the material that appears on “The Basement Tapes” album is valid as much more than a mere retrospective of the very fruitful col- laboration of Bob Dylan and The Band in the mid-to-late sixties. In addition to fill- ing the gap that has been left open in the careers of these major artists, this music stands today as being as vital and impor- tant as it was the day it was recorded.” A major merchandise campaign is planned in support of “The Basement Tapes.” SRP Inks Pact With BBC: Phil. Affiliate Goes To #1 NEW YORK — Stereo Radio Production Ltd. (SRP) has reached an exclusive agreement with the British Broadcasting Corporation whereby \"beautiful music” program material of the BBC will be heard for the first time in the U.S. over SRP-affiliated stations.

WEBB Guilty* Of Radio Copyright Infringement NEW YORK — Radio station WEBB in Baltimore has been found guilty of copyright infringement by Judge Joseph H. Young of the U.S. District Court in that city. Following a trial which featured tape recordings of the station's broadcast, the judge found 31 unlawful and unlicensed performances of copyrighted musical works and ordered the station to pay $9,250 plus legal costs. Among the songs played without any payment to the writers or publishers were “Superstition\" by Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye’s “Trou- ble Man,” Buddy Miles’ \"Them Changes,” and “I Shall Be Released” by Bob Dylan, in addition to songs by Hal David & Burt Bacharach, Johnny Bristol & Marilyn McLeod, J. Kern & D. Fields, B. Comden & A. Green & J. Styne, and a number of others. In addition to the or- dered payments, Judge Young enjoined any future performances of these songs on WEBB, the station owned by J. B. Broadcasting — a corporation whose ma- jority stockholder is soul artist James Brown. Plaintiffs in the action were writer and publisher members of ASCAP. Accord- ing to the licensing organization, this ac- tion, which combined two separate suits launched in 1973, was initiated under the U.S. Copyright Act of 1909 which provides for damages of a minimum of $250 for each unlicensed performance of a copyrighted musical work. The statute requires that a public performance for profit of a copyrighted musical work must be licensed. ASCAP has been offering bulk musical licenses for the works of all its members since 1914. However, WEBB has not had a licence since J.B. Broadcasting bought control in 1970. The suit represents the sixth and seventh ASCAP legal actions in the past 5 years for unlicensed performances against the radio stations owned by James Brown. Another lawsuit against WEBB was filed on Feb. 26 which has not yet come to trial. “America’s songwriters and publishers have a clear and well established right to compensation for the use of their works,” noted ASCAP general counsel Bernard Korman, “and we will continue to sue users who refuse licenses, whether they are radio stations, taverns or others who perform music publicly for profit. One would expect a writer of Mr. Brown's standing to be among the first to want to comply with the copyright law.” NEW YORK — In three anti-piracy de- velopments last week, an injunction was issued against MVC Distributing Corp. and Sicom Electronics Corp., and al- legedly pirated tapes were seized in separate actions in New York City and Bakersfield, Calif. Judge Philip Pratt of the U.S. District Court for eastern Michigan issued a permanent injunction barring MVC Dis- tributing and Sicom Electronics, as well as the president of the companies, Donald D. Merry, from the unauthorized duplication of sound recordings pro- duced by A&M Records and CBS, Inc. The judge ordered the defendants to destroy their existing inventory of un- authorized record or tape duplications and also to file a sworn statement with the court verifying their compliance with the order. In addition, the two companies have been ordered to file verified ac- countings identifying the recordings and the numbers of each that had been duplicated, prior to the court’s decision on damages to be awarded. Pending such adjudication the two companies were enjoined from selling, transferring or disposition of any of their machinery, equipment or other capital assets. In a separate development, FBI agents seized more than 5800 allegedly pirated versions of copyrighted tapes in a raid on Glow Electronics Ltd. at 786 Sixth Ave. in New York City. Arrested was Roger M. Hoff, vice president of the firm, charged with violation of the federal copyright law. The tapes had an estimated retail value of $28,500, and artists featured in the recordings included Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond, Herbie Mann and Olivia Newton-John. In Bakersfield more than 160 law en- forcement officials conducted a raid on a swap meet at an automobile racetrack, seizing about 7500 pirated tapes. No ar- rests have been made as yet. This is the ninth such move in a series of raids being conducted on swap meets by the California Df pt. of Justice.

The Brunswick/Dakar defendants, as a result of this scheme, obtained over $334,000 in cash and $28,000 in mer- chandise and used portions of this to make illegal payments to radio station personnel, alleged the indictment. A federal grand jury sitting in Philadelphia handed down an 86 count indictment to the Gamble-Huff operation in that city, naming seven men and six companies and involving conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, interstate travel to commit bribery and violations of the payola statute. Named in the indictment are Kenneth Gamble, Leon Huff, Earl Shelton, Joe Medlin, Edward Richardson, Harry Coombs, and Benjamin Krass. Krass was a former partner in Gamble Records and now runs a men’s clothing store, Krass Brothers Clothiers, which features in the indictment. Companies named in the Philadelphia indictment are Assorted Music, Gamble Huff Records, North Bay Records, Gam- ble Records, Hugs Management and Cheyenne Productions. This indictment alleges that the defen- dants went to New York, Baltimore, Washington, Atlanta, Houston, St Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and other cities and paid “in excess of $25,000 cash to radio station personnel. Further, disc jockeys received over $6,000 worth of clothing from the Krass store when they visited Philadelphia. Via telegrams, another $3,200 was sent to radio station personnel, stated the Philadelphia grand jury. Airline tickets to the value of $2,300, plus other goods and services were pro- vided to radio station personnel. The single radio person named, by the Newark grand jury, was program director for WAOK-AM, Atlanta, Paul Burke Johnson who was charged with perjury, alleging that while under oath, he denied receiving money or clothing from record companies or their representatives. The indictment stated that Johnson received money orders from Gamble, paid for by Assorted Music, from Shelton paid for by Neptune Records and that he also re- ceived clothing from North Bay Records and Assorted. United States Attorney for Newark, Jonathan L. Goldstein, stated that disc jockeys and radio station personnel had “been very cooperative” throughout the investigation. The federal grand jury sitting in Los Angeles turned up record promoter Fred Rector, charged him with failing to file timely tax returns and receiving cash and records from record companies employ- ing him which he sold to record dis- tributors throughout the nation. The indictment alleges that Rector did not report a 1973 gross income of over $66,000, nor did he file a return in 1973 showing his income to be over $37,000. Along with Davis, the New York grand jury charged David Wynshaw, former director of artist relations for CBS Records, with income tax evasion cover- ing the years 1969 through 1971. For those years Wynshaw paid $30,731 tax on a reported income of $115,689 whereas the jury claims his true income was over $340,000 and tax due and ow- ing was $145,000. Wynshaw was also charged with Pas- quale Falconio of conspiring with each other and others not named in mail and wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property. The jury charged that Falconio set up five sham companies and arranged for fake invoices to be submitted to CBS. The sham companies were paid, through arrangements made by Wynshaw, over $75,000 by the label. Companies were Del Tone Trucking, Sutton Travel, R.F. Travel, D. Grosser and Falconio Limo- sine Service. Attorney Goldstein said that the in- vestigations were \"the first stage in a na- tionwide ongoing investigation,\" adding that the music industry in other cities would also be investigated. He also stat- ed that there was \"nothing connecting\" Gamble and Huff with CBS Records with regard to illegal activities. ROTH CcNTUKY RECORDS PRESENTS A (AIR OF WINNERS!

The song, Richard Supa’s \"Somethin' Bout You Baby I Like,” which was a mild suc- cess for Tom Jones two years ago, is shaping up to be Trini's biggest hit since \"If I Had A Hammer” which rose to the top of the charts in 16 countries in the summer of 1 963.

It preaches unity and self-survival, music which entertains and educates,” Holmes asserts. \"Isn't that what it’s supposed to be about?” Cecil Holmes refuses to stop, however, with a rhetorical question. In order to foster involvement with the record-buying public, he has initiated a series of \"Chocolate Ci- ty” contests on a nationwide scale. Under the auspices of local radio stations, listeners are invited to write an essay or create a visual representation of their personal perception of Chocolate City. The top three winners receive lavishly designed \"Chocolate City t-shirts and record buy- ing sprees from Casablanca Records. . .. The contest has already been run on Los Angeles soulful KGFJ, where the response was so tremendous there were two first place winners — James R. Howard, Jr. and Barbara A. Dashell.

The Purifys' single, \"All The Love I Got,” and Perry's single, “Come On Down ” are already receiving chart and sales action as well as airplay. Casablanca and Holmes haven't forgotten the burgeoning disco crowd either Although the label does not plan to release a single from the Parliament LP, 100,000 copies of \"Chocolate City” title tune have been pressed for jukebox and disco play only. The single, which features the full album version on one side and a tight three- minute edit on the other, is bound to become a collector's item in the near future. Holmes says he sees the true impact of his remarkable promotion embodied in the kinds of drawings entered in the initial KGFJ contest. \"It's been very successful so far,” he affirmed. \"The contestants' ideas of Chocolate City' have ranged from the fantasy-world of a town composed of Hershey Bars and Tootsie Rolls, to militant viewpoints and some very straight-ahead thinking. What we at Casablanca Records have achieved is total community participation, which after all, is what Chocolate City' is all about. ^ x ^ .. „ ..

Stephen peepies Rare Earth: Black Like Them “I don't think the sound's gotten blacker. If anything it's gotten whiter.\" Gil Bridges’ defense of the reconstituted Rare Earth’s new musical direction seems satisfactory until you listen to “Back To Earth.” No longer does the music of Motown’s blue-eyed brothers bring to light hard as nails bump and grinders such as “Get Ready” and “Hey Big Brother.” The Earth now conjures up polished visions of Philly and Motown; sounds decidedly a darker shade of black. So where does Bridges get off denying the obvious? A . ... \"It's not a matter of labeling the music as black or white. The new material is soulful as opposed to being black. The band's roots have always been in that area and, in that sense it hasn't changed. It’s just that the band is putting their roots to a different use. ’ The band, by Gil's own admittance, is a superior edition to the Rare Earth of years gone by. What with the likes of Jerry La Croix, Reggie McBride and Gabriel Katona merging with Earth veterans Ed Guzman and Ray Monette; the overall potential of the band is much stronger. , Stronger yes; but the Earth’s new sound harkens to a different drummer; the sound of subtlety and intricacy as opposed to the old kickout the jams approach. \"The music we did in the past was music we just played,” said Gil. \"We really didn’t work that hard on it. At a certain point we were more interested in kicking the songs out as hard as possible. We were very much into a physical thing at that time, which is pretty much how we came across on record. \" “It's not that the band is getting completely away from that physical kind of thing. The fact that the new album is more mellow and laidback was part of the feeling out process within the group. In the beginning nobody wanted to musically step on anybody’s toes. We were just respecting the way each member of the band played. The band is maintaining the power of the old group but is channeling it into new directions.” , „ _..... . An overriding theme in the projected new direction for Rare Earth is the vast ma- jority of original songs emanating from the group proper. It is even more surprising when you stop to consider that the band's \"top of the heap\" status has come largely on the strength of elaborate covers of other people's hits and that when the old band finally got their own creative juices flowing (i.e. “Willie Remembers”) the results were much less than hoped for. ^ ...... Bridges stated the kicking around of ideas within the group has had top priority with the new band's context. \"The fact that there was no preconceived idea of where the new album was going directionwise made it easier for the band to get their own music together. We all had common musical ground in that we all had our roots in black music. We searched for material that all the members of the band got off on. It was the fact that, for the first time, members of the band were getting behind their songwriting that made this album come together.” As has always been the case a percentage of songs came from outside sources but original compositions such as Katona's “Walking Schtick” and La Croix s riveting “Booqie With Me Children” point up the band's in-house writing maturity. The latest Earth ensemble draws upon a multitude of backgrounds with the count- less spheres of influence weaving a crazy quilt patchwork of sounds. Sounds that, qiven half a chance, might engulf the Rare Earth identity. Gil disagreed with this premise deferring to the enhancing of the original sound by these new influences. “If there was any danger of the band losing its identity I think we probably would have changed the name. I think the new material is staying pretty much in the context of the Rare Earth identity. Sure, the material is different but there s that definite Rare Earth sound and feel to it.” , , . .. As all conversations regarding a band's influences will, the topic returned to the band's universal acceptance by non-white audiences. Let s face it, you re not the i first white act signed to Motown for no good reason. Gil was at a loss to explain the band s 3P ^reai Ivdo nJ knowwhy we've had the rapport with black audiences that we've had. We never consciously went out to try and win over a black audience. The original band qrew up around that type of influence. It was the type of music we liked so when we started playing that’s the kind of music we played. Initially our music was a success in the rhythm and blues field so consequently black people were the first to pick up on us. White audiences picked up on it after that and so from the outset we were play- ina pretty much to a mixed audience.\" _ , The band’s interpretation of material has always been direct. Take a song, measure its strenqth and how the members of the band relate to it and go from there. But with \"Back To Earth” Rare Earth has ventured onto uncharted seas; a voyage that’s liable to leave adherents to the old Rare Earth shipwrecked. Gil seemed fully aware of the pitfalls that could await the band. \"I think our new sound will probably shock people familiar with the old Rare Earth sound. I think we ll probably lose some people but we'll also gain people from an area W GM^^markecf asTo how the band’s initial tour would be a combination of the old as well as the new so as to avoid open mouthed audiences hunting for identity but his closing remark served all the more his emphasis on the name being the only thing that’s the same about the band. “It just isn't the old Rare Earth anymore.\" marc snapiro July 5, 1975 i ash bow TBLP talent on stage Rolling Stones Elton John Beach Boys, Eagles, Rufus Joe Walsh, Stackridge WEMBLEY STADIUM, LONDON — The MADISON SQ. GARDEN, NYC — It was just one of those nights. One of those nights that even the Rolling Stones can have. One of those nights of bad timing and technical snafus which clouded the Stones' first appearance in the city in two years. It was one of those nights that left a good part of the au- dience dourly gaping at the \"World's Greatest Rock And Roll Band” going through the motions of a decidely un- spectacular performance. Perhaps the Stones were trying too hard to do something special for their week at the Garden. While promising a unique show for their N.Y. and L A. performances, it was only during their final twenty minute rock and roll onslaught that the crowd was on their feet. They weren't whipped into a frenzy, but at least everyone finally seemed to be on the same wavelength. The show which began nearly an hour and a half late finally got underway as the lotus petal stage designed by Broadway set designer Robin Wagner unfurled to reveal Jagger precariously grasping on- to one of the petal points. The group slid into a version of “Honky Tonk Woman” while roadies scurried behind them; yanking out plugs, adjusting amplifiers, and balancing microphone volumes. The opening segment of the show, consisting of some of the group's straightforward rock and roll numbers such as “All Down The Line,” “If You Don’t Love Me,” “Get Off My Cloud,” “Gimme Shelter,\" and “Ain't Too Proud To Beg” was strong material-wise, but never approached the onstage verve which usually transforms a Stones show into a historical event. While the post-Brian Jones Rolling Stones have been meticulous with their sound to the point of sounding clinical at PALOMINO, L A. — Jerry Jeff stands as an exception to the industry maxim that states an artist ostensibly can’t “make it” without a hit single and/or extensive radio airplay. His exposure to present has been by word of mouth and through lyric of song; at least half of the absolute- ly packed-in audience was familiar enough with his material to provide vocal con’t on pg. 20 times, the current line-up with “bor- rowed” musicians Ron Wood, Ollie Brown and Billy Preston generate a grit- tier approach which was compounded by opening night's sketchy sound mix. While Mick Taylor stood apart as a gen- tle, lyrical musician, Ron Wood and Keith Richard are bookends — playfully ar- rogant and infinitely capable of generat- ing a rock steady back beat. They're not subtle, and when playing through a PA which sounds like a six transistor radio, they'll pound a song into submission. As a result, the songs tended to wash into each other without retaining their distinct qualities. Jagger, whose sheer presence at a microphone can emit a menacing charisma, found it necessary to run through a series of calculated out- rages and limp wristed flapping to pro- vide a constant focal point. Musically, there were dead spots which interrupted the orgasmic flow; most notably during an abrasive “You Got To Move,\" a dis- jointed “You Can t Always Get What You Want,'' and a soporific \"Midnight Rambler,\" but they smugly set the con- trols for the hearts of the audience with a bedazzling finale of “Rip This Joint,\" \"Street Fighting Man,\" and “Jumping Jack Flash.” For an encore, “Sympathy For The Devil\" took on Cecil B. DeMille propor- tions as a 100-member strong steel band marched out to give an incessant rhythmic boost which completely drowned out the group. Eric Clapton joined them almost unnoticed and played a vicious solo through a curtain of feedback. It was just one of those nights, but it was a Rolling Stones concert and nobody was complaining. CONCERTS AT THE GROVE, L.A. — When two giants in the field of jazz are teamed together on the same bill one can expect many interesting things. Such was the case with Les McCann and Eddie Harris performing separately at the ail new Concerts At The Grove. The Grove is quite large with ample seating and a good sound system. Even with-its con’t. on pg. 20 mid-summer music festival at England’s Wembley Stadium featuring Elton John, The Beach Boys, Joe Walsh, Eagles, Rufus and Stackridge delighted a packed house of 72,000 people. Local favorites Stackridge warmed up the still drifting crowd with their own particular brand of rock and roll. Rufus, featuring lovely r&b soul lady Chaka Kahn, provided a distinct an- tithesis from the rest of the bill. Kevin Murphy, Tony Maiden, Bobby Watson and Andre Fischer infused a vibrant background for Ms. Kahn’s vocal offer- ings. Having appeared once before in England as a member of the James Gang in 1970, Joe Walsh’s appearance was eagerly awaited by all. Playing selections from his solo endeavors plus material from his James Gang days, Walsh earned Yes Ace HOLLYWOOD BOWL, L.A. — Having previously seen Yes on a number of oc- casions and as recently as December '74, it is very evident to me that this group refuses to rest on past laurels, but in fact faithfully performs each song with exuberant musical enthusiasm while maintaining an acute awareness of their audience’s desires, December may well have been a critical period in Yes's history. Patrick Moraz had just recently joined the group and assumed all keyboard respon- sibilities after Rick Wakeman’s exit. \"Relayer, ” Yes’s most recent LP for Atlantic, was also being showcased before the American public for the first time. Understandably, concern was in the air. Moraz' ability not only as a musician, but also as a complementary asset to fellow group members Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire, and Alan White, was yet untried. The introduction of \"Relayer, ” while coming off the heels of perhaps their least accepted work (“Tales From Topographic Oceans\"), also caused its share of anxious mo- ments. But critical changes were a part con’t on pg. 20 Jim McGuinn Band Jimmy Buffett Band BOTTOM LINE, NYC — The voice and twelve-string guitar of Columbia record- ing artist Jim McGuinn have been around since before the beginning of the progressive and country rock years, yet, to see him perform with the vitality and flash that he showed on stage here re- cently you could think that he was an am- bitious newcomer trying hard to get a foot in the door. His present band, especially Richard Bowden on six-string guitar, is skilled, tight and sings exceed- ingly well. When combined with some of the ex-Byrd's best new tunes, like “Lover Of The Bayou” and \"Bulldog,” and the best of his old tunes (“Chestnut Mare” got such an ovation that he sang the last choruses again) they pumped out a steady pulsating brand of rock that was clearly in a league with any of the music that the myriad variations of the McGuinn bands over the years have pro- duced. Opening the evenings festivities was the Jimmy Buffett Band. Playing in the same country rock vein that those that followed them typified, this ABC band sang songs about the road and the California coast, best summed up in the title of their new disk ”A1 A.\" r.i.p. the first encore of the day after an inspir- ing set. Late in 1972 the Eagles exploded into the music scene with a stunning debut album. Four LPs later, Glen Frey, Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and new member Don Felder presented their wares to an already enthusiastic au- dience. Their appearance featured a chronological presentation of their career. “Take It Easy,” \"Witchy Woman,” “Peaceful Easy Feelin’,” \"Desperado,\" and an unabashed rendition of “Already Gone,\" among their portion of the. show. The group returned to the stage to do their recent number one single, “The Best Of My Love.” Preceding Elton John were the Beach Boys making their first local perfor- mance in three years. The group touched all eras of their existence in the two hour set. Their Wembley ap- pearance hardly varied from their recent U S. concert tour. From the opening number “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” to the closer \"Fun Fun Fun,” sunshine music was created on stage. The Californians were called back for numerous returns and even more madness was gained when Dennis Wilson dedicated “You Are So Beautiful” to the people of England and sang the Joe Cocker tune accapella. In 1975 Brian Wilson’s musical brew still is tasting good. con’t. on pg. 20 ZZ Top Aerosmith THE FORUM, L.A. — If you delve deep enough into the backgrounds of most hardrock bands, a stint as the local bar favorite is sure to turn up. Four blaring sets a night where the music’s direct competition is alcohol consumption and dissatisfaction with said sound could mean instant mayhem from an inebriated customer. Based on ZZ Top’s performance at the Forum you kind of get the feeling that London’s “little old band from Texas\" learned their hammer and tongs ap- proach in just such boozey dives. The band’s hard attack relied on a little used concept in the world of metaloid riffs. Rather than trying for abstract dis- tortion of axe runs, the duo of Billy Gib- bons and Dusty Hill were as buzzsaws, peeling slab upon slab of sound from their instruments. These further ex- cursions into the gravel depths of rock and roll took on a bludgeoning effect as some loose blues strains went head on with less drastic musical rushes for a series of “grind them out a yard at a time” numbers. Frank Beard's stead backbeat, which anchored most professionally the band's aggressive tendencies, proved stalwart as the Top moved back to the boogie for an atomic-powered climax. con’f on pg. 20 Janis Ian John Shine THE BOARDING HOUSE, S.F. — Columbia Records’ Janis Ian made the transition between an invitational record business opening at L A ’s Roxy and the city by the Golden Gate seem almost ef- fortless, as she presented an array of material from her latest \"Between The Lines” LP. Janis steps on stage sur- rounded by a mystique that has gathered around her since the American pop es- tablishment proclaimed her \"star” subse- quent to the release of her “Society's Child” in the 1960s.

A panel of judges selected Larry Settle of the twelve to represent the greater L.A. area in the regional Opry finals which will be held in San Diego on June 28. Larry currently is a resident of Garden Grove, has been playing for 16 years and performing at local clubs and benefits for the last six, has done session work, and writes the vast majority of his material. Larry will be working with Granite Records' Cl iff ie Stone, who will produce a single for Larry to be released on the Stone's label. National finals for the Grand Ole Opry talent search will be held in October at Opryland U.S.A. in Nashville. Atlantic Records' college promotion department has published a list of brief resumes submitted to them by qualified 1975 college graduates with radio back- ground who are looking for positions in commercial broadcasting. The listings represent 200 aspirants from the U.S. and Canada and have been forwarded to over 2,000 stations by Atlantic's national pop promotion vice president Dick Kline. Many of the grads have had previous practical experience in different phases of radio. Gunter Hauer and Beth Rosengard from the college promotion department put the listings together, and they report that several grads have been placed in the few weeks the listings have circulated.

The Big Kahuna is back on the air in Miami on WIOD, spinning records between 6-9 p.m. Roby Yonge started his radio life as a weekend man on WQAM in Miami back in '67 while he attended Miami-Dade junior college. After several months he was behind the mike as a full-time jock in the prime early evening slot, which led to a move to WABC in New York City a couple of years later. While at ABC he developed a daily showcase of historic rock and roll (i.e. oldies), quite a new thing in the days of '68- 69. \"From there, it's the classic story of meteoric rise/meteoric plummet; WABC had wanted me to take over for the exiting Cousin Brucie, but Bruce (Morrow) decided to stay and renewed his contract: additionally, they didn't renew my contract,” Roby told me over the phone. \"From there I purchased a recording studio in New York City, poured quite a bit of money and time into it, lost my wife because my business left us no time for each other. Eventually I also had to sell the studio, barely breaking even.\" Roby headed back to Florida and was hired by a West Palm Beach station as a pro- gressive AM disk jockey, but the station turned out to be rather conservative. \"They called me a communist because I played 'Roundabout' by Yes and subsequently fired me,\" Roby explained. \"After that, I was a sailing instructor and worked on com- mercials; last year I really bottomed out. \"WIOD is a nice place to be; I'm really enjoying cueing up records again. The playlist here totals about 50 songs which allows us to expose a lot of new material.” Yonge's future looks a little brighter than it has in the last couple of years; his re- siliency lends credence to the faded and patched saying \"you can't keep a good man down.” George Klein (WHBQ-Memphis) is pictured above with his basketball team, which he calls his \"Q-ties.\" George reports that the young ladies were undefeated this year both on and off the court.

ARB Rates WMAQ #1 Country CHICAGO — The April-May 1975 ARB Radio Report for Chicago, the first to cover fully WMAQ radio's new country music format, shows the NBC-owned sta- tion with a weekly cume (the number of different people 12 years and older who listen to a station at any time during a week) of 1.9 million persons, this makes WMAQ radio the largest country music station in America, after going country only five months ago. The 1.9 million cume puts WMAQ in with a small if select group of radio sta- tions reaching huge audiences: among them are WABC, WCBS, WOR, WINS and WNBC in New York; WLS, WGN and WMAQ in Chicago. In the Chicago ARB report for April- May, based on adults 18 and over in the total survey area, WMAQ ranks second, third or fourth in every weekday time period in both cume and average quar- ter-hour audiences. In commenting on the progress made by WMAQ radio in such a short time, Jack Thayer, president of the NBC radio division, said, \"Two strong facts emerge from this dynamic advance by WMAQ. First, as our research and planning in- dicated, country music is the fastest- growing musical form among adults, particularly young adults. When it was combined with award-winning WMAQ radio and NBC news and service features, the audience response was quick and enormous. Secondly, the staff and on-air personalities at WMAQ radio, under the direction of general manager Charlie Warner, has made a tremendous effort in all areas to have that opportunity materialize.” Warner recalled his promise back in December that \"our goal is to make WMAQ radio one of the great country music stations in the United States\" with the deep satisfaction that this lofty goal was reached in the very first definitive Arbitron report. Stephen peeples Show Biz To Create New Video Syndie NASHVILLE — Show Biz, Inc. today un- veiled plans for production of a new half- hour syndicated television series titled \"Nashville On The Road.\" Set for a Sep- tember debut, the series co-stars Jerry Glower, who has broken all existing records with the sale of over six million comedy albums during the past two years, and Jim Ed Brown, one of Nashville's most popular singers. Both artists are represented by Top Billing, which is acting as talent packager for \"Nashville On The Road.” Now in pre-production, the series will begin ac- tual taping in July. A remote taping unit from Opryland Productions will follow Glower and Brown and their big name country music guests as they take their Nashville sound to locations throughout the United States. The first shows of the 52-week series will be produced before a live audience in Atlanta. In announcing plans for \"Nashville On The Road,” Reg Dunlap, executive vice president of Show Biz, pointed out that the deal with Top Billing marks the first time any talent booking agency has been used as a talent packager. \"We are en- thusiastic about top Billing's ability to de- liver a super star package each week. Tandy Rice, who was sales manager at Show Biz before purchasing Top Billing several years ago, understands our needs and he'll be furnishing the best of his own entertainers as well as major acts from other agencies.\" Echoing Dunlap's enthusiasm Rice said \"All of us at Top Billing are tremen- dously excited at the prospect of han- dling talent for a show headed by such great stars as Jim Ed Brown and Jerry Clower. This is going to be the first time a Show Biz TV production has gone on the road and it should be a fantastic syndie. \" Show Biz produces nine television programs each week including Ralph Emery's \"Pop!
