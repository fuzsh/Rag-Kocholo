The sales on this package have prob- ably exceeded any other spoken word record in the history of the record business. Because of the album’s success, Berman is one of the most sought-after acts in the country. He is currently set to open in the new Broadway musical comedy, “Boys Against Girls”, and his new Verve LP, “Outside Shelley Berman” is set for release in the near future. GREAT HEW TEEHAGE STAR!

Ever since the advent of Rock and Roll music as the music of the 1950 to 1960 decade, one of the toughest pills record company brass had to swallow was the “one-shot artist”. Prior to the Rock and Roll era, art- ists had what we refer to as “testability”. If a newcomer made it, so to speak, the record company was, more often than not, sure that the given artist would remain in the public limelight for a considerable length of time. Although it was too much to expect an artist to come up with a smash every time out, one could count on a fair share of hits from this personality. As a result one group of top artists domi- nated the best seller list regularly. When Rock and Roll debuted, with it came “one-shot-ism”. No matter how big an artist’s record hit, it became almost impossible to get the artist to repeat. Of course there are a chosen few performers born out of the R & R era who have weathered the storm and who today are selling records as strongly as ever. But such a performer came along once in several thousand. However, in the past year or so we have noticed a definite increase in the number of artists who have been able to follow-up their initial successes with not only one additional hit, but a chain of hits. Is the singles record buyer becoming less fickle? Is there a greater chance today for an artist with a smash single to “test”? A close look at the current best seller list would certainly lead one to believe this is true. Of course there are always numerous newcomers. But examine the Top 100 chart closely and notice how many newer names have re- peated with consistency of late. There is probably no single reason that can explain this phenomenon. But perhaps the fact that the singles record buyer is beginning to purchase hits at a younger age each year, gives him more time during his teen age disk buying career to follow one or more favorite artists. Whether this is the beginning of a trend or just one big coincidence only time will tell. But let’s hope it tests. Because a group of artists who can turn out hits with greater consistency than we’ve witnessed in the business during the past seven years is certainly a solid as- set to the record industry. Now com- panies can go hack (as already evi- denced in several cases) to spending time and money in building personal- ities who can show a return on invest- ments over a long time period. It looks like a healthy development. i The Cash Box TOP 100 Best Selling Tunes on Records COMPILED BY The Cash Box FROM LEADIN6 RETAIL OUTLETS October 10, 1959 1 — Mack The Knife 1 1 ★ AC-6147— BOBBY DARIN BT-1 1053— AUSTRALIAN JAZZ QT.

Superb Glenn Osser ork and choral backdrop. Also of chart importance is the very pretty ballad coupler, “Cherie.” Ralph Burns’ crew warmly backs up on this end. “HAPPY ANNIVERSARY” (2:47) [Korwin ASCAP — Stillman, Allen] “WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? (3:10) [Woodbine BMI — Sherman, Keller] FOUR LADS (Columbia 41497) • “Happy Anniversary” is the warm main-title of the flick translation of the B’way success, “Anniversary Waltz,” and both the Four Lads and Jane Morgan size it up with a fine sentimental touch. It looks like a big song. Flipsides on both decks also rate attention. The Lads are excellent on “Who Do You Think You Are?,” a light romantic number that offers much in melody and lyrics. Miss Morgan stays tender on the pretty oldie, “C’est La Vie, C’est L’Amour.” “THERE’S A GIRL” (2:10) [Hillary, Ultra BMI— Alpert, Adler] “MY HEART SINGS” (2:19) [Hillary, Ultra BMI— Alpert, Adler] JAN & DEAN (Dore 531) • Jan & Dean’s Dore newie sports a contagious “Baby Talk”-like novelty opener that’s gonna immediately catch the teenager’s fancy. Tagged “There’s A Girl,” it’s a romantic rock-a-cha cha that has that money-making sparkle. There’s more of the same teen-appealing sounds on the enticing “My Heart Sings” backer-upper. Two real cuties. “HAPPY ANNIVERSARY” (2:25) [Korwin ASCAP — Stillman, Allen] “C’EST LA VIE, C’EST L’AMOUR” (2:58) [Garland ASCAP— Coslow, Williams] JANE MORGAN (Kopp 305) “COOL WATER” (3:20) “SUNRISE SERENADE” (2:28) [American ASCAP — Nolan] [Jewel ASCAP — Lawrence, Carle] ROGER WILLIAMS (Kapp 301) • Take your pick of Roger Williams’ latest Kapp duo, “Cool Water” or “Sunrise Serenade”. Both sturdies are sprinkled with Williams’ magic chart dust and should easily find their ways onto the deejays’ turntables. They’re done up, easy-on-the-ear, fox trot style with Marty Gold’s outfit backing up on the former while Hal Kanner’s aggregation does likewise on the latter. “ALWAYS” (2:11) [Irving Berlin ASCAP— Berlin] CARMEN McRAE (Kopp 302) H ' \"THE MORE I SEE YOU” (2:25) S' » [Bregman, Vocco & Conn ASCAP — Gorden, Warren] A fine vocal ap- pearance for the pretty oldie. Stylist warmly caresses the opus, while the Dick Wolfe ork (plus chorus) lends a soft-beat hand. Can come-across. B “DON’T CRY JOE” (Let Her Go, Let Her Go, Let Her Go)” (2:47) [Harms ASCAP — ] Very similar try on another years-back number. PETE SEEGER (Folkwoys 202) B , “ONE DAY AS I RAMBLED (I S+Never Will Marry)” [Melody Trails BMI — Gladden] The noted folk singer-authority does a beautiful job on the haunting folk tune. Deck can be a “left-field” chart item. I “SKIP TO MY LOU” [Melody Trails BMI — Adapt, by Stanton, Cavanaugh] An appropriately spirited rendition (with chorus) of the folk favorite. JOHNNY LOVE (Mercury 71492) B“LEAD ME” (2:23) [Tee Pee ASCAP — Locke, James] Songster Love is commanding on the fervent ballad request. Backing is a lush ork- chorus soft beat affair. Stands a chance. B “BLESS YOUR HEART” (2:28) [Eden BMI — Benton, Stevenson] Love is strong again on the senti- mental. TONY OSBORNE (Roulette 4189) B“THE WINDOW OF PARIS” (2:11) [Kahl BMI — Osborne] A fine continental ork novelty. Founda- tion is a catchy melody, and the Osborne crew approach it with a con- tagious ork sparkle. A bright pro- gramming piece. LINA LYNNE (Toppa 1008) ® “LINA’S DOLL” (2:00) [Durf & Mixer BMI— Coe] Good-sounding instrumental (the Storms combo) with now-and-then cries of a doll and Miss Lynne asking the child to go to sleep. The percussive sounds are strong. Could move. B“FIVE GOLDEN CHARMS” (2:00) [Durf & Mixer BMI— Coe] The thrush is spotlighted on a pretty folk-like romantic. LOUIS ARMSTRONG (Verve 10182) B “NOBODY KNOWS THE * TROUBLE I’VE SEEN” (2:44) [P.D.] Armstrong touches upon the great spiritual with the singing- trumpet warmth he is so capable of. String ork is extremely soft. B“THAT OLD FEELING” (2:41) [Leo Feist ASCAP— Fain, Brown] The notable artist is affably loose on the fine standby. Both sides offer jocks choice programming. IVY’S (Coed 518) H “LOST WITHOUT YOU” (2:30) ^ DT [Winneton BMI— Luttig, Starce- vic, McCluske, Knowlan] A soft and inviting blend by the boy & girl on a pleasing 1940’s-type ballad. Nice legit sound here. B“ALL I WANT” (2:05) [George Paxton ASCAP— Bell] Same kind of appealing sentimentality on this end. GENE BUA (Warner Bros. 5098) B “BLUE-EYED DARLIN’” (2:16) [Coliseum BMI — Bua] Inviting soft rhythm outing. The throaty Bua delivery is backed by pro teen vocal- instrumental thoughts. Kids can take to side. “SYMPHONY” (2:31) [Chappell & Co. ASCAP — Alstone, Lawrence] SAMMY TURNER (Bigtop 3029) 0 Another Irving Berlin favorite steps back into the wax spotlight. This time it’s “Always” and it’s wonderfully brought up-to-date, beat- ballad style by Sammy Turner, who handed in a smash re-styling of “Lavender Blue”. Chalk up a first rate arrangement by Stan Apple- baum. Ditto for the soft cha-cha up-dating of “Symphony.” Very pretty offering that can also happen. B“THE MAN FROM MARSEIL- LES” (2:07) [Patricia BMI— Osborne] A soprano sax heads an- other merry ork making. B “DANNY” (2:20) [Rosarita AS- -0 CAP — Wise, Wiseman] Bua is effective in a minor key. Good tearful. A RUSS REGAN (Capitol 4280) JIMMY JONES (Epic 9339) J I “STARRY EYED” (2:25) “WITHOUT YOUR LOVE” (1:34) [Mansion ASCAP— [Pambill ASCAP— Shuman, Garson] Shuman, Garson] GARY STITES (Carlton 521) ® Chances are “Starry Eyed” will turn out to be Gary Stites’ initial top ten entry. Chanter, femme vocal crew and ork all blend in ear- arresting fashion on a most attractive cha cha beat love affair. Watch it zoom up the lists. The tearful, ballad-with-a-beat “Without Your Love” presents a fine companion piece. Splendid male combo support B “ADULTS ONLY” (2:06) [Beechwood BMI — Regan] Cute rhythmic about guy and gal teeners who can’t go to “adult only” French flick (presumably starring Brigitte Bardot) or a nitery (all they want there is soda pop). Good sound and clever theme could get deck around. B“JUST THE TWO OF US” (2:05) [Beechwood BMI — Regan] A rock-swinger that has an affable way about it. B “WHENEVER YOU NEED ME” (2:32) [Roosevelt BMI — Single- r ton, Evelyn] Vocalist is appealingly gentle on the touching ballad. Will do very well for “dreamy” teen pro- gramming. B“YOU FOR ME TO LOVE” ' (2:32) [Roosevelt BMI — Scott] Jones gives the melodic romantic an 1 effective soft “cry” and result will affect youngsters. Two fine ballad sessions. “Only those records best suited for commercial use are reviewed by THE CASH BOX ” ENCHANTED SEA” tha Qi .1 c “ENCHANTED SEA The Cash Box , Music Page 9 October 10, 1959 RECORD ISLANDERS Written and Produced by FRANK METIS and RANDY STARR ON THE CHARTS AND CLIMBING TO THE TOP THE BIGGEST INSTRUMENTAL OF THE YEAR RECORDS 632 Liberty Ave., Pittsburgh 22, Pa. • Atlantic 1-1704 ((lt’s What’s in THE CASH BOX That Counts—WTERNATIONALLY” Page 10 October 10 , 1959 The Cash Box, Music Record Reviews A PICK B+ EXCELLENT B VERY GOOD C+ GOOD C FAIR D MEDIOCRE “On/y those records best suited for commercial use are reviewed by THE CASH BOX” Hie Cosh Box Pick of the Week “TALK TO ME” (2:58) (Barton ASCAP— Snyder, Kahan, Vallee] “THEY CAME TO CORDURA” [Maraville ASCAP— Cahn, Van Huesen] FRANK SINATRA (Capitol 4284) # “Talk To Me” is a class ballad that Sinatra handles at his intimate best. Given enough exposure (and figure jocks to provide it), this ballad beaut can score big and become a sequel to the artists’ “High Hopes” click. Performer is highly expressive on the moving Spanish-type coupler, a flick main-title. “(Love Is A) CAREER\" (2:12) “I AIN’T GONNA LEAD THIS [Famous ASCAP— Cahn, Van LIFE NO MORE” (2:20) Heusen] [Court ASCAP — Drake] DEAN MARTIN (Capitol 4287) # Songster could produce a follow-up to his “An Evening In Roma” chart-maker with either portion. “(Love Is A) Career” is a fine romantic (from a pic of the same name) that lends itself to Martin’s easy swing way. Familiar folk-styled delight, “I Ain’t Gonna Lead This Life No More,” is read with a fine swing-novelty touch. ‘TENNESSEE WALTZ” [Acuff-Rose BMI— King, Stewart] “CHARLENE” [Jat Texical BMI — Spring, Summers] JERRY FULLER (Challenge 59057) # A wild version of “Tennessee Waltz” from the songster, who clicked awhile back with “Betty, My Love.” The furious instrumental things that go on behind the fast Fuller delivery are sure to delight the kids. A Bobby Comstock (Blaze) rock rendition of the opus is getting action and Fuller’s should soon be battling for honors. Fuller’s got an “action” deck, too. Though an easier track, “Charlene” has balled excitement. Could move, too. BOB & JOE (Columbia 41 487) » , “STOOD UP” (2:10) [Atlantic fl+BMI — Welch, Merlo] Boys are lively on the catchy beat theme about a fella who’s standing on the corner wondering whether he’ll be stood up by his gal. Has a sound that could score, for the comers. B“HAS SHE GOT A SISTER” (2:13) [Nancoz BMI— Welch, Merlo] Things stay on the upbeat and again the sound is teen-wise. TEAM MATES (Le Cam 706) B“IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN” (1:58) [LeBill BMI — Howard] Another plaintive pose. B “SOONER OR LATER” (2:15) [LeBill BMI — Smith] A smooth teen-romantic warble by the lead on an opus that’s a rock adaptation of the Stephan Foster favorite, “Beauti- ful Dreamer.” Wistful appeal here.

Chorus opens with a chant of “Taps.” Effec- tive teen ballad issue. BOB ELLIS (EK 100) B“TOOT, TOOT, TOOTSIE,” “YES SIR, THAT’S MY BABY,” “THE SHEIK,” “ROW, ROW ROW” (2:55) [ASCAP] Songster offers a lively ac- count of the four durables. May get good “looking back” programming. ft, “LA ROSITA” (3:00) [DuPont] |#+ The sentimental oldie gets a light swing from Ellis. CANNONBALL ADDERLEY’S FIVE STARS (Jazz) (Blue Note 1738) B “SOMETHIN’ ELSE, PART 1” j [Groove BMI — Davis] The alto saxist’s crew breezes nicely through the session, with Adderley and un- billed trumpeter doing the solo work. B “SOMETHIN’ ELSE, PART 2” [Groove BMI — Davis] Adderley does most of the solo talking here. * Sides are from an LP of the same name. JERRY LYNN (KRCo 102) #*, “POOR UNFORTUNATE ME” -4 I# •” (2:29) [Ken-Rick BMI — Geam] An OK country-flavored lament by Lynn, with a sax heading the combo beat display. “GOOD NEWS” [Shalimar BMI— Blackwell] “THAT WAS ME” [Jon-Ware BMI— Glover] THE FIESTAS (Old Town 1074) # “Good News” should travel round wax circles real fast. It’s the Fiestas’ newest and its taken for an attention-getting ride. “So Fine”- quick beat ride. Delightful dual-mart romancer. “That Was Me,” on the other half, is a catchy novelty rocker from the Coasters-school. There’s big pop-r&b coin in store here too. “THE CROSSROADS OF LOVE” (1:58) [Jack Gold ASCAP — Edwards, Wayne] “WHATEVER HAPPENS” (1:50) [Greta BMI— Mure, Wolf] TEMPOS (Climax 105) # The chart-hitting ingredients of “See You In September” are found in “The Crossroads Of Love” (cleffed by “September’s” writers) and put the boys in a good position to score again. It’s a date to keep close tabs on. “Whatever Happens” is solid material presented with a dynamic ballad touch. “WHY DON’T YOU BELIEVE ME” (1:57) [Brandom ASCAP— Rodde, Laney, Douglas] “THE MEANING OF THE BLUES” (2:10) [Sheldon BMI — Wolf, Raleigh] KALIN TWINS (Decca 30977) ® Twosome brings “Why Don’t You Believe Me” (the one-time Joni James’ smash) into a bright teen light, giving opus a go resembling their “When” winner. Lookout for this track. “The Meaning Of The Blues” is an interesting, upbeat essay. “IF YOU GO STEADY WITH W T ME” (2:09) [Admiration BMI — Catalano, Kulaga] Another heart-felt beat-ballad session. JOHNNY FALLIN (Capitol 4283) B“IF I COULD WRITE A LOVE SONG” (2:12) [Central BMI— Fallin, Rhodes] This ballad rhythmic contains fine-sounding beat things, in- cluding an over-all haunting quality.

WILL MERCER (Sun 329) U , “YOU’RE JUST MY KIND” B <■ (2:26) [Knox BMI — Smith, Bar- ton] Session has an upbeat sound that’s tried-and-true, but delivered in a pro style by Mercer and support.

B“DOWN, DOWN, DOWN (Where 4 The Wurzburger Flows)” (1:45) [Harvard BMI — Belmonte] The an- 4 cient waltz filter in a sunny appropri- ate ump-pah-pah setting. Side with good feeling. j A TOMMY DISHAW (D&C 500) < B “WE’RE GONNA ROCK” [Bry- den BMI — Dishaw] Songster Dishaw and combo-chorus setting sock out the convention ditty in pro style.

Flipside, Tony emotionally carves out an enticing fish-beat er ta,gged On y Your Heart”. Strong combo-chorus support on both these chart threats. “HIGH SCHOOL, U.S.A.” [Pete, Progressive BMI — Royster, Leader] “PLEA OF LOVE” [Progressive BMI— Facenda] TOMMY FACENDA (Atlantic 51 to 78) $ Reason for the 51 to 78 disk number is that 20 different veisions of the tune, “High School, U.S.A.”, are being shipped around the country. Gimmick is the mentioning of a host of local high schools tailored tor each of the areas. It’s a bright rocker, loaded with commercial vocal and instrumental sounds, that newcomer, Tommy Facenda and choius, drive out solid sales authority. Could step way out. Fetching rock-a- ballad completes the pairing. “TAKE ME ALONG” (2:35) [Valyr ASCAP— Merrill] “OH BABY DON’T CRY” (2:31) [Tri-Park BMI— Hammer] LONNIE SATTIN (Warner Brothers 512) ® The oft-recorded title tune from the Bob Merrill-scored, soon-due-on- Broadway musical, “Take Me Along”, could find Lonnie Sattin s ver- sion leading the pack into hitsville. Chorus and strings slickly back Sattin as he rocks along in a bright Jackie Wilson manner. Looks like a winner from this end. Thrilling, inspirational showcase on the ‘Oh Baby Don’t Cry”, the hard, middle beat romantic coupler. “ANYTHING YOU WANNA DO (I Wanna Do With You)” (2:17) [Kahl BMI — Medley, Passman] “LIKE WOW” (2:17) [Cree Cree BMI — Eckstine, Alfred] BILLY ECKSTINE (Roulette 4199) 9 Eckstine has his best teen-directed outing to date on the bright, “Ain’t That Love”-type handclapper, “Anything You Wanna Do (I Wanna Do With You).” Can do the chart trick.

Sides are prize teen attractions. “DREAM OF ME” (2:10) “OO DARLIN’” (2:30) [Winneton BMI— Keyes] [Winneton BMI— Donahue] BILLY DONAHUE (Coed 519) 19 Songster Donahue can rate with the teeners with both ballad stands here. Both “Dream Of Me” and “Oo Darlin’” are affectionate and tuneful romancers, with the latter date getting a harder beat. (Both | settings have a Latin-rock feel). Watch this boy and his work here. Could be that Carl Smith, Jimmy Newman and Wilma Lee & Stoney Cooper will kick up loads of pop-country excitement with their newest releases (see country reviews). ERNIE FELICE (RCA Victor 7606) m . “ ’CAUSE I LOVE YOU, THAT’S D+WHY” (2:45) [Chas. N.
