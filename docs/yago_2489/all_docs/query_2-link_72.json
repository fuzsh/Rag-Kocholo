        "text": "Extraordinary Women, Part 3\n\nMy mother, Helen Isabella Estes Seltzer, died Dec. 28, 2010, at the age of 90. She had a life-long interest in family history. In her memory, I compiled profiles of powerful and strong-willed women among her ancestors, thinking those women might inspire her descendants. These brief biographies are grouped according the lines of descent, which are shown afterwards, leading down to the present.\n\nDaughter of a Slavic prince, Ludmila married Borivoj I, Duke of Bohemia (in what is now the Czech Republic). The couple were converted to Christianity, probably by Saints Cyril and Methodius (best known as the inventors of the Russian, “cyrillic”, alphabet).\n\nLudmila and her husband worked hard to convert the people of Bohemia to Christiantiy, and as a result of their efforts they were driven from the country. Later they returned and ruled again.\n\nTheir son Sptihnev ruled as duke after them, and he was succeeded by his brother Vratislav I. When he died, he was succeeded by his eight-year-old son, Wenceslas — the “Good King Wenceslas” of the Christmas carol.\n\nWenceslaus’ mother Drahomíra became jealous of Ludmila’s influence over Wenceslaus and had two noblemen murder Ludmila. Legend says that she was strangled with her own veil.\n\nLater, Wenceslaus was murdered by his brother (our ancestor) Bolesaus I “the Cruel” who then became Duke. According to Wikipedia: “Despite the fraticide Boleslav is generally respected by Czech historians as an energetic ruler.”\n\nHer feast day is celebrated on September 16. She is the patron saint of Bohemia, converts, Czech Republic, duchesses, problems with in-laws, and widows.\n\n(NB — Russia was converted to Christianity by Saints Olga and Vladimir [our ancestors]; France was converted by Saint Clotilde and King Clovis [our ancestors]; and Bohemia was converted by Saint Ludmila [our ancestor]).\n\nLine of Descent\n\n1) Saint Ludmila (c. 860–921) (md.
