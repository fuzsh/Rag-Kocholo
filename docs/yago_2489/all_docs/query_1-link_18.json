Ladislas and Prisca-Irene and Kinship with Sts. Stephen, Emeric, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Cunigunde of Hungary\n\nOn my mother's side, we have traced a line of descent from James II, King of Scots (died 1460), whose wife Marie of Gueldres was a descendant of Jean II le Bon (John the Good), King of France (died 1364). Through King Jean II's wife Judith (Bonne), a lineage is traced by way of the ancient Premyslid Kings and Dukes of Bohemia to the Hungarian Royal House of Arpad. However, Marie of Gueldres' husband James II of Scotland himself had at least four lines of descent from the Arpad Dynasty, which took its name from ARPAD, Duke of the Magyars (or Hungars), who led his people from the steppes of the Dnieper River in A.D. 889 and conquered Pannonia and Transylvania in A.D. 895, lands that were thereafter known as \"Hungary.\" Medieval Hungarian legend claims the Magyars were descendants of the Huns, and that Arpad's grandson Taksony (called \"Toxus the Hun\" in the legend) was 14th in descent from Attila the Hun. Whether there is any basis to the legend, the Magyar people long believed it to be true, and the given name \"Attila\" consequently has been popular among them.\n\nAbout a century after the Magyar conquest of Hungary, most of the Magyars converted to Christianity, and their duke Istvan (STEPHEN) was raised to royal status in A.D. 1000 when the pope sent Stephen a crown and a crucifix, which is why the Hungarian kings have the privilege of bearing the title of \"Apostolic King.\" King Stephen I was both the founder of the Kingdom of Hungary and the person who was chiefly responsible for establishing Christianity in his land, being noted for his faithfulness and piety, and working throughout his reign to establish the Catholic Faith on a firm foundation. His son and heir, Prince Imre (EMERIC), embraced his father's faith and devotion, and it was expected that he would be a worthy and just king. Unfortunately he died before his father, being killed on a boar hunt on 2 Sept. 1031, which led to disputes and conflict among King Stephen's potential heirs. Stephen and Emeric were canonised together in A.D. 1083, and their feast day is Sept. 2 -- but in Hungary the date of Aug. 20 is celebrated as St. Stephen's Day because that is the anniversary of the day that St. Stephen of Hungary's relics were translated to Buda. The incorrupt right hand of St. Stephen is Hungary's most revered sacred relic.\n\nThe canonisation cause of Sts. Stephen and Emeric had been promoted by their royal cousin ST. LADISLAS I (\"Laszlo,\" the Hungarian form of Vladislav), King of Hungary (1077-1095), who in his life embodied the ideal of the Christian knight, being revered for his holiness, charity, justice and courage, especially in his promotion of public order and his suppression of rebellion and treason. St. Ladislas also sided with the Catholic Church against the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy. History and popular legend tell of numerous miracles that God worked through St. Ladislas and his intercession both during his earthly life and after his death. He died 29 July 1095, and most of his mortal remains are interred in Somogyvar Abbey, though his shrine is at Varad Cathedral and his head is preserved in a silver reliquary in Gyor Cathedral. He was canonised by Pope Celestine III on 27 June 1192, and his feast day is observed on 27 June, the date when he was canonised and his relics were translated, rather than on 29 July, anniversary of his death. Numerous royal and noble lines of descent can be traced from his daughter ST. PRISCA-IRENE, wife and empress of the Eastern Roman Emperor John II Comnenus, who as empress promoted the Christian religion through her hosting of Hungarian pilgrims, her foundation of hospitals, and her founding of the Pantocrator monastery. St. Prisca-Irene is honored by Eastern Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians with a feast day of 13 Aug. A mosaic likeness of St. Prisca-Irene adorns the interior of Hagia Sophia Church in Constantinople.\n\nAnother revered royal saint of the House of Arpad is ST. ELIZABETH OF HUNGARY (1207-1231), daughter of King Endre (Andrew) II of Hungary and sister of King Bela IV. St. Elizabeth was the wife of Ludwig (Louis) IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, with whom she had three children. However, she eschewed her wealth and status, devoting herself to the care of the sick and destitute, declaring that she could not wear a golden crown since Jesus her King wore a crown of thorns. After her pious husband's death, St. Elizabeth entered the Third Order of Penance of St. Francis, in which habit she died at the age of 24. The accounts of her miracles both in life and after her death were widespread. She was canonised by Pope Gregory IX on Pentecost in 1235. Her feast day is 19 Nov., two days after the date of her birth into heaven.\n\nThe niece of St. Elizabeth was ST. MARGARET OF HUNGARY (1242-1270), daughter of King Bela IV of Hungary. St. Margaret was raised in a Dominican convent in VeszprÃ©m, but at the age of 12 she moved to a new Dominican convent on the island in the Danube at Budapest that has been known ever since as \"Margaret Island\" (Margit-sziget). During her life Margaret was of notable holiness, charity, and prayerfulness, being endowed with the spiritual gift of prophecy. Carefully documented testimony of eyewitnesses tells of numerous miracles that she worked by God's power, including saving the convent's servant girl Agnes from drowning through her prayers. A cause for her canonisation was opened seven years after her death, which had occured on 18 Jan. 1270. She was beatified in 1789, at which time her feast was placed on 26 Jan., but after her canonisation in 1948 her feast was moved to 19 Jan., the day after her birthday into heaven.\n\nThe most recently canonised member of the House of Arpad is St. Margaret's older sister ST. CUNIGUNDE OF HUNGARY (Kinga), wife of Boleslav, Grand Duke of Poland. In her childhood, St. Cunigunde vowed her virginity to God. When she was older, however, she was married to the Grand Duke of Poland, but upon learning of her vow, Boleslav agreed to enter into a Josephite marriage with her. During her marriage, Cunigunde devoted her life to acts of charity, founding churches, monasteries, and hospitals in Poland. She is also remembered for her role in helping to save the Polish people from an invasion of the Central Asian Tatars. After her husband's death, she renounced the world and became a Poor Clare nun. Poland and Lithuania made her their patroness in 1695, and she was canonised in 1999, with her feast day on 25 July.\n\nThe following two tables show a line of descent from St. Ladislas of Hungary, from whom I am 32nd. in descent -- this line includes an additional descent from Yolande, sister of St. Elizabeth of Hungary -- as well as several of the Arpad lines briefly mentioned above. For the sake of simplicity, only one of the multiple overlapping lines that trace back to Vladislav I Herrman, King of Poland, through the royal families of France, Castile, and Leon is shown here. (See Our Kinship With Pope Calixtus II.) However, a descent from St. Leopold of Austria through his son-in-in-law Vladislav II, King of Poland, is shown below, as well as a line going back to St. Fernando the King. From the second chart, I am calculated to be a great-[x 26]-nephew of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, a great-[x 33]-nephew of St. Ladislas of Hungary, a great-[x 33]-nephew of St. Stephen of Hungary, a first cousin 34 times removed of St. Stephen, a first cousin 35 times removed of St. Stephen, a first cousin 36 times removed of St. Stephen, a first cousin 34 times removed of St. Emeric, a second cousin 33 times removed of St. Emeric, a second cousin 34 times removed of St. Emeric, and a second cousin 35 times removed of St. Emeric.\n\nDescent from Sts.
