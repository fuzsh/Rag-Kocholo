        "text": "Art as propaganda is traditionally thought to be used as a tool of monarchs in cementing their role. In addition to coins with the king's face and seals featuring the king in majesty, the king's face could also appear on public art such as statues, stained glass, and even frescoes. This essay seeks to understand four pieces of stonework visible to the medieval public which would have featured two fourteenth-century queens of Hungary: Elizabeth of Poland (d. 1380), wife of Charles I Robert, and Elizabeth of Bosnia (d. 1387), wife of Louis I 'the Great' (r. 1342-1382).\n\nThis article problematizes the question of how the household can be used as an analytical unit for interpreting past social dynamics of rural life in medieval Hungary. It focuses on issues of social hierarchy and the complexity of village communities, discussing both the material and nonmaterial aspects of peasant and lesser nobility households. Considering the current state of research in Hungary, investigations on household archaeology are yet to discover the paths to more nuanced interpretations of problems traditionally within the scope of this field of research. The socio-economic status of household owners is often reflected by the richness of material finds, particularly import objects, or specific types of finds, while we can also rely on historical documents in order to interpret archaeological evidence in this context. However, the lifestyles of peasantry and lesser nobility were not necessarily distinctive as reflected by archaeological materials, thus, the dichotomy of the wealthy and poor status of households is not a suitable indicator of legal/social statuses. Based on the archaeological evidences, usually it is possible to draw conclusions on the general living conditions of individual households in rural settlements, but, in most cases it is highly problematic to directly connect or interpret any type of find material as a sole indicator when defining the legal status of inhabitants. On the other hand, the structural organization of village space should be also considered, when approaching this problem: the size and position of the household tofts have been also studied in connection to their legal-social status. The paper attempts to look at broader socio-economic trends, exploring how they could have influenced the material dimensions of rural life, focusing on the aforementioned social groups.\n\nIn this essay, I examine the initial stages in the nineteenth century of the study of material finds from the Middle Ages in the Carpathian Basin. I offer a brief overview of the history of the scientific work that led to the identification of archaeological findings from the Avar era and the era of the Hungarian Conquest, and I also shed light on some of the reasons underlying the failure to identify properly findings from the Hun era (i.e. the fifth century) and the late Avar era (i.e. the eighth century). I examine the principal considerations that shaped the research endeavors of historians and archaeologists in the nineteenth century, and I present the primary methodological approaches according to which historians drew on archaeological findings in support of their conclusions. I focus in particular on the works of Miklós Jankovich, Flóris Rómer, Ferenc Pulszky, Géza Nagy, József Hampel, Géza Supka, and Zoltán Felvinczi Takács, though I also consider the writings of less influ...\n\nIn the 15th century Hungarian Kingdom it appears as a general trend that the significance of some old hilltop fortresses started to decline and the aristocracy began to turn their former manor houses into spectacular and comfortable castles. These residences were built in the centre of settlements, often next to a (parish) church. They functioned as the actual seat of the family and represented high architectural standards adequate for displaying power and wealth. The castles of Várpalota, Újlak (Ilok, Croatia) and Kisnána are important examples of this distinct group of noble castles and manor houses in the period. This paper is a detailed abstract of my PhD thesis submitted in 2019 on the subject. The first part provides a revision of the building history of the three residences. The second part examines the questions of architectural prestige representation, i.e., the architectural visualization of the builder’s power, wealth or social status. Beside discussing general issues of prestige representation I also analyse a few significant spaces and structures of the residences from the same point of view. Finally, I make an attempt to determine the place of the examined monuments in the long term processes and changes of aristocratic residence architecture of the late medieval Hungarian Kingdom.\n\nCourtyards were apparently at the physical centres of aristocratic castles. However, they were also centres of social interferences inasmuch as all members of a baronial household had to pass through it while heading for their destinations inside the residence. Although there were a number of places of restricted access in a late medieval castle (e.g. great halls, chapels, private apartments), yards generally were not characterized by a special, socially determined division of space. In this sense courtyards were meeting points of basically whole baronial households and of various groups from outside: illustrious visitors and their retainers and perhaps also craftsmen, merchants etc. Beside circulation courtyards also played role in social display which feature became particularly significant during the late medieval period. This trend is best attested by certain architectural characteristics that gradually got almost typical of contemporaneous Hungarian aristocratic castles: regularised layout of paved courtyards with imposing façades and embellished arcades or galleries around the inside, ornamental fountains in the middle etc. Thus castle courtyards seem to provide a good opportunity to detect architecturally realized social display, i.e. prestige representation. The aim of this paper is to present a few examples of the diverse interpretations of architectural prestige representation and the types of roles the internal courtyards may have played in it."
