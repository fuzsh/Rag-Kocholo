        "text": "Gábor Klaniczay is a professor of Medieval Studies at the CEU’s Department of Medieval Studies. He has published extensively on the historical anthropology of Christendom, on comparative religious history of Hungary and Central Europe, and on the uses of the Middle Ages in modern history. Professor Klaniczay is also the series editor of the Central European Medieval Texts, CEU Press’ series of critical editions in Latin and English translation, along with Patrick J. Geary, Gerhard Jaritz and Pavlína Rychterová.\n\nHis new edition, coedited with Ildikó Csepregi, is The Sanctity of the Leaders which contains the lives of saints canonized in the 11th-13th centuries in the newly Christianized countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nYour publishing history in the field of Medieval Studies is very impressive. Can you tell us a little bit about your academic background?\n\nAs it is stated in the introduction, I'm dealing with the history of medieval Christianity and have been doing that for several decades. I was teaching at the Eötvös Loránd University of Budapest when CEU was founded in the 1990s and I managed to convince the university that it needs a foundation in the classical subjects, classical disciplines. And the Department of Medieval Studies was created. Medieval studies are different from medieval history in the sense that medieval studies require an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research and students have to be trained to be able to use the methodologies of several disciplines; that is, besides history and historical source criticism, also art history, archaeology, palaeography, historical antropology, philosophy, literature. All these things are very important also, because CEU does not have all these disciplines. So, in a way, the Department of Medieval Studies was providing a combination of these disciplines and also putting CEU on the map of international cooperation in these fields. Now the department is celebrating its 30th anniversary. We have in the 30 years of our existence provided MA dissertations for 588 students and 132 PhD dissertations. The fascinating experience in this department was to have here first, above all, a selection of students from former socialist countries, Eastern European countries. That was also allowing us to have a combination of the hidden expertise of these countries. Because although Middle Ages was studied in the previous decades, the results of the scholarship in these various countries were secluded because of linguistic difficulties. Nobody could read for decades what was written in Polish, in Czech, in Hungarian, in Romanian, or in Bulgarian. Now, with our English language education, and with our international contacts, we could serve as a kind of mediation. I must mention that the department was founded in cooperation with János Bak, who served before for several decades as a professor in Vancouver at the University of British Columbia. The initial team consisted of the archaeologist József Laszlovszky, the Austrian expert of the culture of daily life, Gerhard Jaritz, the art historian Béla Zsolt Szakács, the medievalist Balázs Nagy, the historian of religion Marianne Sághy, and the historian of patristics and eastern Christianity István Perczel. I cannot enumerate now all the joining new participants because the department grew big, but the experience of this combination of disciplines was attractive, not only for the students coming from East-Central Europe, America, France, Germany, and Italy, but also for the global world. Now, in our third decade, we have a very broad program, we also offer Ottoman studies and Eastern Mediterranean studies, and so on.\n\nNext to the University’s commitment to Medieval Studies, obviously, the Press also has a big commitment to it. The series that we are talking about is the Central European Medieval Text series. It is one of CEU Press’ longest running series, we have been publishing it since the late 1990s. Could you describe what the series is about, what is its purpose and what prompted its creation?\n\nThere are such series in the international publication world. The model for us was the Oxford Medieval Texts. These bilingual editions are useful because the knowledge of Latin is declining, unfortunately. We tried to counteract; our students do learn Latin. We do have a thorough language education because the students of medieval times must have their source languages, Latin for Western Christianity, Greek for Byzantine studies, or Syriac for Near Eastern Christianity and others. But to republish these sources with an appropriate English translation, that’s now the purpose of scholarly publishers. We proposed the series to CEU Press in line with such western publications. We wanted to concentrate on the narrative sources in Latin language in Central European countries, which might have been published in older editions, but were inaccessible for the larger world. The Monumenta Poloniae Historica was published around the turn of the 19th and 20th century and the Hungarian series of Scriptores Rerum Hungaricarium was also from the 1930s. And even though some of them had been reprinted, these were not very well accessible, and they were, of course, only in Latin. Also, we thought that we have a good academic background to do this, because we proposed not only bilingual editions, but ones also provided with explanatory contextual historical footnotes, and with an introduction from one of the leading experts in the field. And for this, we had to mobilize our international network.\n\nYou have mentioned the present editorial board of the series, let me speak about the beginning team. CEMT was the initiative of János Bak, who had a practice in this type of source edition already. The board consisted of Giles Constable, who was the director of the School of History at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Urszula Borkowska, an excellent professor of medieval religious history from the Catholic University of Lublin, Ferdinand Seibt, a great expert of Czech history on the one hand, and also somebody representing German scholarship from Munich, and myself. So that was the first Editorial Board. The purpose was to publish the principal narrative sources, above all chronicles, as well as hagiographic sources, legends, and some other narrative accounts from the medieval period. Medieval meaning here the 10th to the 14th century, because this region was converted to Christianity around the first millennium.\n\nI wanted to pick up on the issue of Latin knowledge or the lack of Latin knowledge these days, because, obviously, the series is not only important for scholars of medieval history, but also for scholars of modern and contemporary history, as the Middle Ages are often used in modern historiography to bolster claims of historical legitimacy of the nation with many Central and Eastern European states taking their origins in this period. I was wondering, who is the intended audience for these texts? Are they accessible also for the non-specialist or for the modern contemporary historian?\n\nOf course, it’s also for the modern historians. These medieval sources are being read by all history students, and not only history students, but also art historians or archaeologists, or others. They are important for research, but they are also important for the larger public. And if we get to the individual pieces, I can give some examples why they are also important in modern public history or public debates on history. Thus, the intended audience is threefold. One is that they are essential precondition of university studies, and also research. Research libraries throughout the world must have these source editions. They are the building stones of the work of historical, art historical and literary research. They must be provided in an appropriate and also scholarly valid manner. There are a lot of translations which lack these scholarly standards. What we wanted is to have parallel texts and to help those who know some Latin, but not sufficiently well. Seeing the texts side by side, they can refresh their knowledge or even develop their knowledge by using these bilingual editions.\n\nCould you just say a few words about what has been published so far? And how were these texts chosen?\n\nWe concentrate on Central Europe. That’s in the title of the series. Central Europe is roughly the area in the Middle Ages between the Adriatic and the Baltic. In other words: the three big Central European kingdoms: Hungary, Czech Kingdom and Poland. We limited our attention only to Latin Christianity because it was with Latin sources that we have been working. Now how are the texts chosen? Each country has three or four such important works. Unfortunately, medieval production of chronicles was not so abundant. Theoretically, we would like to feature them all, but we need to find the appropriate translator, commentator, and also funding because this is not something which can be just done as a hobby. You asked about individual volumes, and I think it would be worthwhile to see some of the examples of that. So far, ten volumes have been published.\n\nThe first volume, published in 1999, was the chronicle of Simon of Kéza, a Hungarian chronicle writer from the 13th century, around the 1270s, titled Gesta Hungarorum, the deeds of the Hungarians. This chronicle was very famous in the Middle Ages because it was the first to describe the story of the origins of the Hungarians. Medieval nations all had an origin story. One must retain that Hungarians came to the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century, so four centuries later Kézai narrated that the Hungarians were descending from the Huns. The story goes that the Hungarians came to the Carpathian Basin to take back what had already been theirs in the time of Attila the Hun, the famous world empire, that almost defeated the Roman Empire. This was very much a central building stone of the Hungarian national consciousness. And after Simon of Kéza a lot of other histories, in more detail, with a literary fantasy, described these origin stories, these myths. This was leading in the modern history of the Hungarian national consciousness to a very big debate. In the 18th century, linguists pointed out that the Hungarian language is not of Turkic but of Finno-Ugrian origin. This caused a very big uproar among the Hungarians who were keen to have that type of consciousness of having been terrible horse-riding, arrow-shooting nomads, originating from Attila and becoming with him mighty conquerors of the world. They thought that this linguistic theory was just the Habsburgs’ conspiracy to destroy Hungarian national pride. This debate, believe it or not, is lasting since the 18th century to our days and considerable proportion of Hungarians still want to prove that the Hun-Hungarian kinship is the right explanation of the origin of the Hungarians.\n\nThe Kézai volume itself contains a study by the historian Jenő Szűcs, who in the 1970s pointed out that this Hun-Hungarian mythology was like the one believed by the medieval French. The Franks were saying that they descended from some fighters emigrating from Troy. The Troyan origin of the French was taken over by the English as well. There were many such myths in the Middle Ages, which modern people do not consider now the right historical explanation. This is not the case with the Hun-Hungarian kinship.\n\nThe second volume was the autobiography of the Holy Roman Emperor and Czech King, Charles IV, which is another genre. It’s not a chronicle, it’s an autobiography, but a very interesting one in the sense that one of the first autobiographies by a ruler who describes his youth, his dreams, his visions, his projects as a ruler, and also his veneration of the national symbols and national patrons. He even wrote a legend on Saint Wenceslas, the founder of medieval Bohemia. This one was preceded by a preface by Ferdinand Seibt, who was the greatest expert of 14th century Prague.\n\nThe third volume was Gesta principum Polonorum (The deeds of the princes of the Poles) with a preface by Thomas Bisson and the translation and comments by Paul Noble, an American scholar, an excellent expert of Polish history. We have a series editor, Frank Schaer, an Australian Latinist, who controlled all the texts and some of the translations were directly made by him.\n\nAnd the fourth volume, Historia Salonitana (The history of the bishops of Split), made a geographical balance. This has already been commented by a former PhD student of ours. This is something which I want to point out: the CEMT series relies on two networks. One is the that of our colleagues who participated in building up the international network of our department and the other consists of our PhDs who got acquainted with these texts during their studies. Damir Karbić, who is now a leading medievalist in Croatia was investing work into this Historia Salonitana.\n\nThe fifth volume in the series is a chronicle, called the Chronicle of the Anonymous. For Hungarian historians this is one of the biggest riddle of Hungarian history. We only know that this master is called P. dictus magister, Master said P., we have the initial of his name, and we know that he was a notary of a certain king Béla. But there were four Bélas in Hungarian Middle Ages. After a long, long debate, now there is more or less a consensus that it must have been Béla III, who lived in the 12th century, in the age of the crusades. This chronicle of Anonymous is describing the land taking of the Hungarians. The author is an educated cleric, his account is the first narration of medieval Hungarian history, but there is much uncertainty around the truthfulness of the events he narrates. This volume also includes another piece, because the chronicle of Anonymous is not very long. Master Roger, in the 13th century, described the terrible destruction of Hungary by the Mongolian attack. In 1241, the Mongols devastated Hungary, and this cleric gave a moving, detailed account of what he saw. It is called Carmen Miserable (A miserable song). an interesting reading for anybody who wants to know about medieval realities.\n\nThe sixth volume is on the Central Europen saints of the Christianization age. Actually, there are three volumes on medieval hagiography of this region, edited by myself. Volume six was the first one including the legends of the most important saints of the 9th and 10th centuries. Saint Adalbert was the Bishop of Prague, but then he got chased from Prague. He went to Rome and then finished his life by trying to convert in Poland the pagan Prussians, who killed him. He was a martyr. Later on, he became the most important saint of Central European countries. Beside the Poles the Czechs and also the Hungarians venerate him as one of their most important patrons. He had a great influence in founding Christianity in these countries. We also have in this volume one of the legends of Saint Wenceslas, the Bohemian duke, also a martyr, also killed. He was a model of Christian rulership. The volume also contains the legends hermits who promoted the conversion: the “Five martyr brethren” killed in Poland, Zoerard-Andrew and Benedict in Hungary, and the Croatian hermit called Gaudentius of Osor. The introduction to this volume was written by Ian Wood the English historian, who is maybe one of the greatest experts of the missionary period in European history. It is translated by two of our alumni, Cristian Gaşpar and Marina Miladinov.\n\nThe seventh volume is the one which is the latest that I published with the cooperation of Ildikó Csepregi. It includes the saints of the 11th, 12th and 13th century: Saint Stephen, Saint Ladislaus, Saint Emeric of Hungary, two martyr bishops: Saint Gerard and Saint Stanislaus, and a holy abbot, Saint Prokopius of Sázava. The production of this volume was a true team effort of our alumni, and we also had one special contributor, Petr Sommer, a longtime leader of the Czech Institute for medieval history, and and a great historian of all the monastic history of 11th and 12th century.\n\nThe eighth volume I published with the cooperation of Ildikó Csepregi and Bence Péterfi included the oldest legend and the acts of the thirteenth-century canonization process of Margaret of Hungary, the daughter of King Béla IV, who was dedicated to the service of God as a Dominican nun, in the royal monastery built for her on the island of the Danube near Buda. It also published the 15th century miracle accounts collected to promote her canonization, recently discovered by Bence Péterfi.\n\nThe ninth volume was edited by János Bak a few years ago. It was one of his last works and maybe the most cherished one. This 14th century chronicle composition was the most important medieval Hungarian chronicle, the Illuminated Chronicle. This book contains a CD with all the illustrations. The 14th century was the age when the chronicles were already illustrated by beautiful and very artfully executed miniatures. This was a chronicle composition which was started already in the 11th century and was enlarged and rewritten several times. Again, this is a great riddle for historians to know which part belongs where. It is co-edited by an excellent Hungarian scholar László Veszprémy, who is maybe the best expert now of medieval Hungarian chronicles, and Martin Rady who participated in several of these editions and translations and is also an English expert of Hungarian medieval history.\n\nVolume ten is again a Czech volume, which is the chronicle of Cosmas of Prague. It is the most important Czech medieval chronicle from the 12th century. This was edited by János Bak and Pavlína Rychterová. It was translated by a former PhD of ours, Petra Mutlová and also a team of Czech historians were working on making this volume as a basic source for medieval Czech history.\n\nThe way you describe it, this is very much a team effort. I am interested in the nitty gritty of how these texts are put together as critical source editions. You mentioned the various translators, that is quite a big challenge. Could you say a bit about how you find these sources and what is the challenge in publishing these?\n\nThe translators are mostly coming from the circles that we have trained ourselves. In the latest volume, there are six or seven former PhDs participating. For example, for the part about the Croatian bishop, John of Trogir, the translation was done by Marina Miladinov (Schumann) and Anna Marinković, another PhD of our department, wrote a very expert commentary. The legend of Saint Stanislaus, the martyr bishop of Cracow, was translated by Cristian Gaşpar, and Stanislava Kuzmová, who wrote her PhD dissertation on the sermons related to Saint Stanislaus, wrote the preface. I won’t go around all of these. The essential thing is that each individual source requires a person who has done research on that, who is able to put together a commentary, and who is also able to control the various historical notions, which are mentioned in the sources. The translator must be clear what are the historical denominations, what is the appropriate description of the ecclesiastical or secular offices which are mentioned in the text. And of course, it must be in an acceptable or even better, in a good, readable English. We must have a native English reader. CEU Press has very good quality control. Martin Rady was there, to control several of the texts, as well as Frank Schaer. Frequently we had to debate with the translators because the translation of an 11th-12th century text is a tricky one. The translators in this situation have to look at the work of other translators and check. whether there is a German, French or another language translation and must make their own decision how to translate the problematic points. Because these problematic points are used sometimes for historical justification of certain claims. One of the legends of Saint Steven has a passage which says that the Hungarian ruler has full power over the church because the pope granted them this privilege. This was already very much debated in the Middle Ages by the papacy. To give a precise translation of that sentence involves a huge responsibility.\n\nCould you say a few words about the new edition, the Sanctity of the Leaders and what’s included in it?\n\nThere were three types of leaders, who were also venerated as saints, not all, but some of them. One is constituted by the holy rulers. This is important because the rulers are normally not saints. But on the other hand, the rulers always desired to have a kind of sacred charisma. In the Antiquity, they wanted to be venerated as gods, but Christianity refused to recognize this for the Roman Emperor. This is why many Christians had to suffer martyrdom. Yet, in the Middle Ages kings were more and more willing to appropriate this title. Not only in Central Europe, but also elsewhere. But in Central Europe, especially in Hungary, it was very much the case. We can find this with Saint Steven, the founder of the Christian kingdom, who was a kind of apostle converting the Hungarians. There was also his son, Emeric, whose legend is in the volume, a youthful prince, educated to become a truly Christian ruler. Yet, he couldn’t succeed his father because he died early. There was Saint Ladislaus, who was an Athleta patriae, a chivalrous knightly saint, confronting the Cuman aggressors as a very brave fighter. The military virtue could also confer an important sacrality. If somebody could win the battle, he had that type of prestige.\n\nA second type of charismatic leader is the saintly bishop. We had holy bishops already in the first volume of the series, Saint Adalbert. In the present volume we have also Saint Gellért or Gerard, a bishop of Saint Steven who was one of the chief organizers of the Hungarian church and who was killed in a pagan uprising after the death of Steven. We have also here Saint Stanislaus, a bishop who dared to confront a tyrannic ruler. There were two types of powers in the Middle Ages, the ecclesiastical and the secular one, and they were frequently in conflict. The most famous case in this respect is that of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, killed by the partisans of King Henry II. This Becket-model was also relevant for Central Europe. Stanislaus was also killed by Boleslaus, King of Poland, because he confronted him, criticizing his tyrannic actions.\n\nFinally, we have the type of the holy abbot, the followers of Saint Benedict, Saint Columba and many others. The Czech Saint Procopius of Sázava is representing this type.\n\nAnd let me add here, in conclusion, that in the eighth volume, that I published with the cooperation of Ildikó Csepregi and Bence Péterfi, a new type appears. The holy rulers in the 13th century were succeeded by saintly princesses. The most famous saintly princess was St. Elizabeth of Hungary, daughter of King Andrew II, she was an all-European saint, not living in Hungary, but in Thuringia and becoming saint first in Germany, so we did not include her many legends in our series. But the niece of St. Elizabeth, the daughter of King Béla IV, St. Margaret of Hungary was living in Hungary, in Buda, on an island in a Dominican convent. Her hagiography is important, because in the 13th century there was a big investigation about her sainthood. In those times it became a bureaucratic, canonic affair because the popes reserved the right to declare somebody a saint, and before that they wanted to have an appropriate judicial examination with papal legates. There is a canonization process documentation, the acts of the canonization of Margaret, which collected the testimonies of 110 witnesses who were speaking about the life of Margaret and about the miracles they attributed to her. We can find here a most detailed account of the everyday life of medieval people. There are several hundreds who speak and what they tell is described by notaries, more or less precisely. We hear about family tragedies, we hear about captivities, we hear about illnesses, we hear about the life of the nuns. There are 38 nuns who give their testimonies. We hear about the life of the city. It is a fascinating reading. I could see that in international medieval circles several scholars were very happy and are already exploiting these data for giving an image of medieval cloister life or medieval miracles.\n\nThe interview is an edited version of the CEU Press podcast episode featuring Professor Klaniczay.
