        "text": "Stephen and Yhana is the official You Tube channel for this blog (The Lives of my Ancestors) and author (Stephen Robert Kuta), a shared adventure with his daughter.\n\nFeaturing: Days Out in the UK / History / Genealogy / Virtual Walks / Virtual Cycling / Travel and so much more. Feel free to visit, subscribe and watch out for all of our upcoming episodes.\n\nHow you can easily create beautiful art for your home or your loved ones by Peter Black, founder of – Charmaché Art and Craft\n\nSince I began writing my family history blog, I have published very little regarding my connections to The Royal Houses of Europe, possibly because so much of it is out in the public domain already and many of the names need little in a way of introduction.\n\nSome of these connections though are interesting for many reasons, like King István V of Hungary (1239 – 1272), (English; Stephen V), he appears in my ancestry as my 23rd great-grandfather, and 7th great-grandfather to the infamous Vlad Ţepeş III ‘the Impaler’ Dracula “Prince of Wallachia” DRÁCULESTI (1431 – 1476).\n\nIstván was the eldest son, and the sixth child of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla appointed his son Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258, he was crowned King of Hungary on or before 17th May 1270, his reign was short-lived and lasted only two years, his death is recorded on the 6th August 1272.\n\nThe family lived during a time of war with the powerful invading mongul armies that annihilated the lands of Hungary in 1241, and civil war and unrest tore the family apart.\n\nIstván married Erzsébet of the Cuman’s in 1253, his wife was aged just nine years of age, whilst he was fifteen, she bore him six children, all four of his daughter’s became queens, his eldest son, King and his youngest a Duke.\n\nMy Descent from King István of Hungary"
