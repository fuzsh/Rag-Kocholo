        "text": "Polovtsian warrior\n\nPolovtsy (self-name Kipchaks) is a complex ethnic group belonging to the Turkic tribal group and an integral component of the entire complex political stories pre-Mongolian Rus', in particular, the period of its fragmentation and the struggle of Russian princes for inheritances* and supremacy in the princely hierarchy. And even despite the familiar image of the Polovtsy in many Russian chronicles as an unconditional enemy, these steppe nomads can often be found as allies of the ancient Russian princes.\n\nPersecution of the fleeing Polovtsy by Russian troops to the Khorol River (1107). End of the XNUMXth century. The original chronicle is in the library of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg\n\nAt the Russian borders, the first appearance of the Polovtsians is attributed to 1055, when Pereyaslavl Prince Vsevolod Yaroslavich*, returning from a campaign, he met some hitherto unknown nomads in the steppe. The first meeting was peaceful - the parties even exchanged gifts and soon dispersed peacefully, each to their own limits. But later, being in close proximity to the borders of the Russian principalities, they still had a significant impact on the course of the history of all pre-Mongolian Rus'.\n\nThe territory of Kumania (Dasht-i-Kipchak) around 1200 AD is highlighted in yellow. e.\n\nBut just a few years later, these nomads had to enter the stage of history and play a significant role in the life of all of Eastern Europe, becoming cruel mercenaries for the ancient Russian princes in their internecine wars and turning into formidable enemies and unreliable allies for them. Staying in a short period of history of the steppe nomads, who so suddenly appeared and just as suddenly dissolved in the Hungarian kingdom in a relatively short period of time, did not go unnoticed by the chroniclers of those times, and the questions of who they were and where they came from are of concern to historians to this day.\n\nThe names of some Polovtsian leaders are often found in ancient Russian chronicles throughout the so-called. \"Polovtsian period\" - most often they were related to the Russian princes by family relations. But even kinship did not guarantee strong and good neighborly relations with the Polovtsy - these dynastic marriages for the Polovtsy, as a rule, meant nothing.\n\nPolovtsy fighting with Russia. From the Radziwill chronicle of the XNUMXth century\n\nHere is what Russian researcher Yu. V. Seleznev writes about dynastic marriages:\n\n“Russian princes willingly became related to the Polovtsians. Such prominent Russian rulers as Yuri Dolgoruky, Mstislav Udaloy, father of Alexander Nevsky Yaroslav Vsevolodovich were married to the Polovtsy.\n\nBut such a serious interaction and mutual influence between Russia and the Polovtsy took place not only at the level of rulers, but also among the common population. A similar mutual influence between settled Slavic farmers and nomadic Polovtsians can be traced in the presence of common burials and funeral rites - burials without a horse begin to appear among the nomads - just as the Slavs do.\n\nIn addition, apparently, the constant miscegenation of the border population also influenced the anthropological appearance of people, for example, the Soviet historian V.V. Mavrodin believes that part of the Slavic border population began to acquire Mongoloid features (provided that the Polovtsy were Mongoloids), and the Cumans were subjected to the process of Slavization.\n\nImage of the Polovtsians in the Radziwill Chronicle\n\nAn interesting assumption is made by the domestic historian, orientalist and ethnologist L. N. Gumilyov:\n\n“The mixing of the Russian and Polovtsian populations took place not at the population level, but at the organizational level, that is, children from mixed marriages did not give rise to a new ethnic group, but were included in the ethnic group in which they were brought up.”\n\nBut the peaceful coexistence of settled and nomads did not last long - the beginning of the “relationships” was laid by the Polovtsian raid in 1061, led by Khan Iskal, on the Principality of Pereyaslav, where Prince Vsevolod Yaroslavovich was defeated, the villages were plundered, and people were taken to full.\n\nThree years later, the Polovtsy made a new raid, but were defeated by Izyaslav Yaroslavich and suffered heavy losses, Khan Iskal was among those killed in the battle.\n\nThe attack of the Polovtsian troops of Prince Bonyak on Kyiv; arson of princely and monastic buildings (1096). Radzivilov Chronicle, late XNUMXth century. The original chronicle is in the library of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg\n\nBut such a kaleidoscope of attacks continued throughout the era of Rus''s neighborhood with the steppe nomads. If the opposing sides concluded some kind of peace between themselves, then it was always fragile - during such an unstable truce, the opponents always used a temporary respite solely to accumulate even more strength for a new war with each other.\n\nUltimately, the mutual struggle of Ancient Rus' and the nomadic Polovtsy exhausted the forces of the two peoples and made them easy prey for the Mongol invaders who invaded the territory of Rus' in the first third of the XNUMXth century.\n\nHere is how the historian L. N. Gumilyov describes Russian-Polovtsian relations:\n\n“When selecting information about Russian-Polovtsian clashes according to the Laurentian Chronicle, it turns out that over 180 years (1055–1236) the Polovtsy attacked Rus' 12 times, the Russians attacked the Polovtsy 12 times, and there were 30 joint Russian-Polovtsian operations in internecine wars \".\n\nBut there is also the view of A. Yu. Yakubovsky (1886–1953), a Russian and Soviet historian, who wrote in 1932:\n\n“Historiography, filled with stories about military clashes with the Polovtsians (Kumans), failed to notice the fact that for relations between the Russian principalities and the Polovtsian steppe, it is not wars and raids that are more characteristic and normal, but intensive commodity exchange.”\n\nIn historiography, stereotypes often still appear about the eternal confrontation between the forest and the steppe - sedentary farmers and nomadic pastoralists, where the latter are assigned a secondary and completely unattractive role of an external destructive force that disrupted the normal development of the Old Russian state with its constant interference, while the ancient chroniclers do not forget to reward Polovtsian nomads with such words as \"godless\", \"cursed\" and so on.\n\nPolovtsian archer\n\nBut there was an exception from this general series of Polovtsian leaders - this is the leader of the Dnieper Polovtsians, Khan Kotyan, who is, if not an absolute, but still an exception.\n\nKhan Kotyan Sutoevich\n\nHis name sounds like Ivan Vasilyevich, and very, very little is known about the life of this Polovtsian khan - his biography is mainly known from Russian and Hungarian sources, that is, in those countries where he was most remembered by his contemporaries.\n\nThe name of the Polovtsian Khan Kotyan was first mentioned in Russian chronicles in 1205, when he, along with his brother Samougr, during the unsuccessful campaign of Rurik Rostislavich on Galich, almost got captured. \"Rurik gathered a lot of Polovtsi and Rus' and came to Galich ...\"- tells the Galicia-Volyn Chronicle.\n\nBy the beginning of 1220, the Polish-Hungarian army invaded the territory of the Volyn principality, and Mstislav Udaloy, who was the father-in-law of the Polovtsian Khan Kotyan, came to the aid of Prince Daniel of Galicia with his Polovtsian detachments, which forced the invading troops to retreat. And after some time, the Polovtsy helped Mstislav to win back Galich, which had previously been captured by the Hungarians.\n\nBut in the 20s of the XIII century, nomadic Mongols appeared on the territory of the Polovtsian steppe (Dasht-i-Kipchak), one of the first victims of which was a large state in Central Asia - Khorezm.\n\nAfter the capture and plunder of Khorezm and the death of its ruler Ala ad-Din Muhammad II, Genghis Khan instructed his commanders Jebe and Subedei to continue further conquests and invade Eastern Europe through the Caucasus, where they encountered the combined forces of the Alans and Polovtsians.\n\nNot having achieved military victories, the Mongols by cunning, endowing the Polovtsy with gifts, persuaded them to leave the Alans, telling them that \"we and you are of the same clan\", after which they defeated the Alans, and then the Polovtsians who did not expect anything. After such an insidious attack by the Mongols, the Polovtsian Polovtsian khans died Yuri Konchakovich* and Danila Kobyakovich*, and the remnants of the Polovtsian army fled and joined the horde of the Dnieper Khan Kotyan.\n\nThe military campaigns of the Mongols, which went down in history as the \"invasion of the Tatar-Mongols into Rus'\" were very well organized, and most importantly, they were successful. All these events of grandiose significance, they determined the further historical path of Rus' and the Polovtsy neighboring them.\n\nThe threat of further expansion of the Mongols into the Polovtsian steppe forced the Polovtsy to seek help from their Russian neighbors...\n\nKotyan Sutoevich was at the head of the Polovtsy of the Dnieper region, therefore it is not at all accidental that he turned to his son-in-law Mstislav Mstislavich for help in Galich and asked him and all the Russian princes to support him against the Mongol threat.\n\n“Forget the old grievances! Then understand that if you don’t help us today, then tomorrow the Tatars will enslave both us and you one by one!”\n\nThe Russian princes and Polovtsian khans held a council in Kyiv, at which they decided to fight the Mongols, and one of the Polovtsian khans even converted to Christianity in order to express his complete inseparability from his Russian allies.\n\nAfter the joint Russian-Polovtsian council, Mstislav, who has great authority among the Russian princes, managed to attract the Kyiv, Chernigov, Novgorod-Seversky, Smolensk and other princes and gather a large army.\n\nBattle of Kalka\n\nIn May 1223, this united army set out on a campaign, crossed the left bank of the Dnieper and moved east to the Don, where they met the advance detachment of the Mongols. Wishing to divide the Russians and the Polovtsy, as they once separated the Polovtsy from the Alans, the Mongols sent ambassadors to meet the army.\n\n“We heard that you are going against us, having listened to the Polovtsy, but we did not touch your land, neither your cities, nor your villages; they did not come against you, but by the will of God they came against the serfs and grooms of their Polovtsians. You take the world with us; if they run to you, drive away from you and take away their property; we have heard that they have done much harm to you; we beat them for it.”\n\nThe Russian princes considered that the Mongol ambassadors had specially arrived in the Russian army to look out for the Russian forces and killed them. Then the Mongols sent a second embassy to the moving troops, with the following message:\n\n“You listened to the Polovtsy and killed our ambassadors; now go to us, well, go; we didn’t touch you: God is above all of us.”\n\nThese ambassadors were released in peace.\n\nSo, on May 31, 1223, a fatal battle for the Russian-Polovtsian army took place on the Kalka River in the Donetsk steppe, where the combined Russian-Polovtsian forces were utterly defeated, primarily due to the lack of elementary unity. Many Russian princes and most of the soldiers who opposed the common enemy fell in it.\n\nRussian chronicles claim that the defeat began with the flight of the Polovtsian cavalry, led by Khan Kotyan, who could not withstand the swift attack of the Mongols. When repulsing the Mongol aggression, the Russian princes and Polovtsian khans acted separately from each other, each side acted under its own banners and had its own military leaders.\n\nPainting \"Battle on the Kalka\". Author - Dmitry Zyabkin, 2007\n\nAnd what about the Mongols? Having defeated the combined Russian-Polovtsian forces, they returned back to Central Asia, and along the same route, but in the opposite direction, the Mongols, led by Batu, undertook their Western campaign ...\n\n\"Kalka\". Author: Pavel Ryzhenko. 1996\n\nIn Hungary\n\nDuring the Western campaign of the Mongols in 1238–1239, they reappeared in the Polovtsian steppe and defeated the largest tribal associations of the Polovtsians, and the remaining tribes, led by Khan Kotyan, turned to King Bela IV of Hungary with a request to grant them asylum, promising to accept Christianity and recognize laws and order of the Hungarian kingdom. He conveyed to King Bela IV through his messengers that:\n\n“He fought the Tatars for a long time with varying success, but was defeated by them and now asks for permission to move to Hungary and that he is ready to recognize the power of the king over himself and come to Hungary with all his relatives and friends, property and herds.”\n\nPolovtsians arrive in Hungary. medieval illustration\n\nBela IV favorably reacted to the conversion of the Polovtsy, presented the ambassadors of Kotyan with valuable gifts and sent Dominican monks to the Polovtsy to accompany them to Hungary, and in the fall of 1239, the Hungarian king personally met the 40th horde of Khan Kotyan on the border. As promised, the Polovtsy adopted the Catholic faith and formed an army reporting directly to the King of Hungary.\n\nAnd here is what A. B. Malyshev writes about this in his work “Polovtsy in Hungary and the Golden Horde in the middle - end of the XIII century”:\n\n“In 1237, after a difficult war with the Mongols and defeat from them, the largest resettlement of the Polovtsy to Hungary took place, numbering up to 40 people, headed by Khan Kotyan, known from Russian chronicles. Kotyan gave Bela IV a promise to convert to Catholicism. The Sejm of the Hungarian barons, in view of the danger of an attack by the Mongols, allowed them to settle on the eastern borders of the state. Among the newly arrived Polovtsians, the preaching of Catholicism immediately began.\n\nAn interesting fact is that in the 1220s. some Polovtsian families moved to Hungary, having already been baptized into Orthodoxy by Russian priests. Hungarian kings since the beginning of the XII century. used the Polovtsy as the most reliable support of the throne in the fight against their own aristocracy, which caused obvious discontent of the latter.\n\nThe Cumans, who arrived and were treated kindly by White IV, were settled on the borders of the Hungarian kingdom, where they created a “buffer zone” in front of the Mongol troops rapidly advancing towards the borders of Central Europe, which, however, did not save Hungary from the Mongol ruin in the future.\n\nNote. The history of the Polovtsy is not limited to only one Desht-i-Kypchak - they also showed themselves outside their steppe homeland, for example, in Hungary. The very first contacts of the Polovtsy in Hungary date back to 1091, when they, led by their Khan Kopulha, made a robbery raid on this kingdom, but were repelled by King Ladislaus I, and those captured by the Hungarians were soon released and settled in specially designated places for them. on the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe first page of the Chronicon Pictum (medieval illustrated chronicle of the Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the XNUMXth century. It represents the international artistic style of the royal courts at the court of Ladislaus I of Hungary) depicting the court of Ladislaus I. On the right, warriors in oriental dress, including one dressed in yellow Cuman\n\nIn the fight against their internal and external enemies, the Hungarian kings repeatedly entered into military alliances with the Polovtsy, and with the consent of the Hungarian rulers, many Polovtsy even remained here for permanent residence. Over time, the Polovtsian settlers had already settled down in a new place, and the Polovtsian nobility began to actively intervene in palace intrigues, which began to cause discontent among the Hungarian aristocracy.\n\nAnd in 1222, the Hungarian king Andrei II was even forced, under pressure from the Hungarian \"barons\", to limit the rights of the Polovtsian nobility at the Hungarian court. Thus, long before the Mongol invasion of the territory of Desht-i-Kypchak, the Polovtsy lived in Hungary and were in the service of the Hungarian kings.\n\nHungarian king Ladislaus I (left) fights a Polovtsian warrior (right). Fresco from the Szekelider Unitarian Church, Romania\n\nThe study of the conditions of stay of the Polovtsy in Hungary and the description of the processes and mechanisms of assimilation are very important for understanding their history in the middle of the XNUMXth century. The appearance and residence of the Polovtsians in Hungary, led by Khan Kotyan, are described in detail in the work \"The Sorrowful Song about the Devastation of the Hungarian Kingdom by the Tatars\"* a direct eyewitness of those events by Magister Rogerius, who at that time was in Hungary on church business.\n\nThe Hungarian king (left) pursues feigned retreating Polovtsian cavalry archers (right). Photo of Slovak painting of the XNUMXth century\n\nUnder the influence of circumstances, many Cumans accepted Christianity formally and continued to adhere to their traditional burial traditions. The Polovtsy differed from the Hungarians in their unusual hairstyles, clothing and steppe customs, and it was against these external manifestations of everyday life that the Catholic Church launched an offensive.\n\nLater, the Roman curia set a number of strict requirements for the Polovtsians, where they were ordered to abandon the worship of pagan idols, give up their hairstyles, which included one or three pigtails, switch to Hungarian clothes, adopt a sedentary lifestyle and live in houses. The Polovtsy were also forbidden to shave their heads and leave forelocks (a shaved head at that time was a punishment for criminals).\n\nLooking ahead, it must be said that already three decades after Kotyan's arrival in Hungary, Pope Urban IV wrote to the Hungarian archbishops, ordering them to evict from the kingdom those Polovtsians who still adhere to pagan rites.\n\nNote. The assimilation of the Polovtsians into Hungarian life accelerated in the XNUMXth century, when the traditional clan-tribal social structure disappeared from them, and the Polovtsian aristocracy had already begun to associate itself with the Hungarian aristocracy. And from that time on, becoming a Christian meant becoming a Hungarian. It should also be noted here that an important mechanism of assimilation was the inclusion of the Polovtsian nobility in the power structures of Hungary.\n\nAccusing the Polovtsy (probably justifiably) of robbing the local population, trampling down fields and gardens during the migration, the Hungarian aristocracy treated the Polovtsy with great distrust. According to the royal decree, the Polovtsians were not allowed to hold public office without the permission of the Council of State, in which representatives of the indigenous Hungarian aristocracy had a majority ...\n\nAnd how did the further fate of Kotyan and the Polovtsians who came with him in the Hungarian kingdom develop?\n\nMoving closer and closer to the borders of Hungary, Batu sent an angry letter to the Hungarian king, filled with a desire to quarrel the Hungarians with the arriving Polovtsy and threats to ruin Hungary in case of disobedience:\n\n“Besides, I learned that you keep the slaves of my Cumans under your protection, therefore, henceforth I order you not to keep them with you, so that because of them I would not turn against you. After all, it is easier for the Cumans to flee than for you, since they roam without houses in tents, they may be able to escape, but you, living in houses, have lands and cities, how can you escape my hand.\n\nLet us turn again to the work of A. B. Malyshev \"Polovtsy in Hungary and the Golden Horde in the middle - the end of the XIII century\":\n\n“The Khan offered Bela IV to submit and drive away the “Khan’s slaves” - the Polovtsians, otherwise Hungary would be attacked. It can be asserted with firm certainty that the Khan's demand to Bela IV to abandon the alliance with the Polovtsy is a typical example of one of the widespread principles of the Mongolian policy of \"divide and conquer\". Before the invasion, the Mongol command tried to split the Polovtsian-Hungarian alliance, which happened.\n\nThe Hungarian king did not want to obey such a cynical demand, and in the early forties of the XIII century, the Polovtsy, who had gathered in Hungary in large numbers, attacked the vanguard of the Mongol troops of one of Batu's commanders, but were defeated by the Mongols. Nevertheless, even after such a defeat, the Polovtsians continued to roam in the Hungarian steppes, and the Hungarian king Bela IV even concluded an agreement on military service with Khan Kotyan.\n\nBela IV's heir, his son Stephen (Istvan), the future King Stephen V of Hungary, married one of Kotyan's daughters, Seykhana, who took the name Elizabeth (Erzebet) after baptism, and Kotyan himself received from the king the proud title of \"Dominus Cumanorum\" - the ruler of the Cumans (as the Cumans were called in Europe), and the aforementioned master Rogerius called Kotyan the king of the Cumans (“Kuthen Cumanorum rex”).\n\nThis dynastic marriage between the heir of the Hungarian king Stephen and the daughter of Khan Kotyan Elizabeth was supposed to settle the friction between the Hungarians and the Cumans and became a guarantee that the Cumans in Hungary would be safe. But the Hungarian \"barons\" were greatly alarmed by the strengthening of the power of the king, who received into his hands such a significant force as the Polovtsians. In addition, there was another reason for dissatisfaction - this is the message of the Mongol Khan to King Bela IV.\n\nKing Bela IV of Hungary. \"Chronicle of Janos Turoczi\"\n\nShortly before the Mongol invasion of Hungary, the Polovtsy were accused by the Hungarian \"barons\" of dangerous ties with the Mongol invaders in that they brought the Mongols to Hungary, based on the fact that in the Mongol troops there was a significant percentage of Russians and Polovtsians who remained in their homeland and did not migrated to the West.\n\nMongol invasion of Hungary in \"Chronica Hungarorum\" by Johannes de Turoch\n\nImmediately after the invasion of the Mongols into the territory of Hungary, the \"barons\"-conspirators in Pest broke into Kotyan's housing and killed him and his entire family. According to another version, Kotyan himself killed his wives first, and then stabbed himself to death. Thus ended the life of one of the most iconic Polovtsian leaders.\n\nThis shameful murder of Kotyan for the Hungarian aristocracy, as mentioned above, took place in the year of the Mongol invasion of Hungary and bitterly backfired on this country - most of the Polovtsy rebelled and began to ravage the Hungarian villages and attack the Hungarian people's militia, which was just about to come out at that moment against the Mongols. King Bela IV somehow tried to cool and calm their ardor, but the Polovtsians, continuing their raids, answered: “This is for you for the Kitten».\n\nThe hilltop fortress is Sumeg Castle in western Hungary. King Bela IV built such fortifications to protect the Kingdom of Hungary from the Mongol invasion.\n\nAfter the villainous murder of Khan Kotyan, most of the Polovtsy renounced their recently adopted Catholicism and migrated to neighboring Bulgaria, to Tsar Koloman (Koloman I Asen), and the other part, including Elizabeth of Cuman, Kotyan's daughter and wife of the future Hungarian king Stephen V, remained in Hungary. After all these events, weakened by internal strife and completely losing its defense capability, Hungary was defeated, and its king Bela IV had to flee to Croatian Zagreb...\n\nFlight of King Bela IV of Hungary from the Tatars.

National Széchenyi Library in Budapest\n\nFinale\n\nUnable to withstand the onslaught of the Mongols, the Polovtsians, who did not become a single people, were divided into even smaller tribes, of which some dissolved in the territories occupied by the Mongols, another part ended up among the Egyptian Mamluks, and some part migrated to the Balkans, where, after participating in the Bolgaro -Byzantine wars dissolved in the motley mercenary forces of the Byzantine army.\n\nThe Cumans were world famous for their riding skills.

Sukhodolsky, 1836\n\nHaving traveled a historical path of almost 200 years, the Polovtsians have sunk into oblivion of history, leaving behind “stone women”, which were placed only in the places of their long stay, from the places of finds of which one can study the historical geography of the movement of the Polovtsy.\n\nPolovtsian \"stone woman\". Kursk region\n\nThe Polovtsy finally assimilated among the Hungarians in the XNUMXth century, when the language of the Hungarian Polovtsians practically ceased to exist, and the Turkish conquest and population migration eliminated the uniqueness of this region. During the Reformation in Hungary, the prayer of the Hungarian Calvinists was recorded in the Polovtsian language, and the last person to speak Polovtsian was Istvan Varro*.\n\nIstván Varro. The last person to speak Polovtsian\n\nWas there a household influence of the Polovtsy on the Hungarians?\n\nYes it was! It was expressed in the toponymy of Turkic origin in Hungary, where about 200 names were recorded that are associated with the Polovtsy, as well as in the borrowing of some Polovtsian words. The XNUMXth-century Polovtsian hat and some of the customs of Nagykunshag and Kiskunshag (historical regions of Hungary) do not really belong to the medieval steppe tradition.\n\nDescendants of Kotyan Sutoevich\n\nCatherine of Hungary (1256–1314).
