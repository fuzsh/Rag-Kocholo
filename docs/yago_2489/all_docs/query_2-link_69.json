        "text": "This paper re-addresses the nature of joint-family systems in historic Eastern Europe. It identifi es two “hotspot” areas of family complexity and uses census microdata to shed light on atributes of household organization and living arrangements of the elderly in a comparative perspective. A detailed examination of various demographic components of the joint-family systems under discussion reveals important inter-societal diferences and suggests that “de-essentialization” of the notion of the “joint-family system” might be necessary when discussing the geography of family paterns in this part of the continent.\n\n„…circa Danubium…” from the Late Avar Age until the Early Árpád Age. 8th-11th-Century Settlements in the Region of the Central Part of the Hungarian Little Plain and the Danube Bend.
