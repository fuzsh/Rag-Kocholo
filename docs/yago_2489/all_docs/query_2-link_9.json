        "text": "From the Emperor’s Desk: Eastern European Royalty is a weak era for me. So I’ve been working on rectifying this problem. So today I offer the life of King Béla IV of Hungary and Croatia.\n\nBéla IV (1206 – May 3, 1270) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1235 and 1270, and Duke of Styria from 1254 to 1258.\n\nBéla was the oldest son of King Andrew II of Hungary by his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. He was born in the second half of 1206, although the exact date is unknown. Upon King Andrew II’s initiative, Pope Innocent III had already appealed to the Hungarian prelates and barons on June 7 to swear an oath of loyalty to the King’s future son.\n\nAndrew II betrothed Béla to an unnamed daughter of King Boril of Bulgaria in 1213 or 1214, but their engagement was broken. In 1214, the King requested Pope Innocent III to excommunicate some unnamed lords who were planning to crown Béla king.\n\nEven so, the eight-year-old Béla was crowned in the same year, but his father did not grant him a province to rule. Furthermore, when leaving for a Crusade to the Holy Land in August 1217, King Andrew II appointed John, Archbishop of Esztergom, to represent him during his absence.\n\nDuring this period, Béla stayed with his maternal uncle Berthold of Merania in Steyr in the Holy Roman Empire. Andrew II returned from the Holy Land in late 1218. He had arranged the engagement of Béla and Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea. She accompanied King Andrew II to Hungary and Béla married her in 1220.\n\nFrom 1226, Béla governed Transylvania as duke. He supported Christian missions among the pagan Cumans who dwelled in the plains to the east of his province. Some Cuman chieftains acknowledged his suzerainty and he adopted the title of King of Cumania in 1233.\n\nKing Andrew II died on September 21, 1235 and Béla succeeded him as King Béla IV of Hungary and Croatia. He attempted to restore royal authority, which had diminished under his father. For this purpose, he revised his predecessors’ land grants and reclaimed former royal estates, causing discontent among the noblemen and the prelates.\n\nThe Mongols invaded Hungary and annihilated Béla’s army in the Battle of Mohi on April 11, 1241. He escaped from the battlefield, but a Mongol detachment chased him from town to town as far as Trogir on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Although he survived the invasion, the Mongols devastated the country before their unexpected withdrawal in March 1242.\n\nKing Béla IV introduced radical reforms in order to prepare his kingdom for a second Mongol invasion. He allowed the barons and the prelates to erect stone fortresses and to set up their private armed forces. He promoted the development of fortified towns.\n\nDuring his reign, thousands of colonists arrived from the Holy Roman Empire, Poland and other neighboring regions to settle in the depopulated lands. Béla’s efforts to rebuild his devastated country won him the epithet of “second founder of the state”\n\nKing Béla IV set up a defensive alliance against the Mongols, which included Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow and other Ruthenian and Polish princes. His allies supported him in occupying the Duchy of Styria in 1254, but it was lost to King Ottokar II of Bohemia six years later.\n\nDuring Béla IV’s reign, a wide buffer zone—which included Bosnia, Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) and other newly conquered regions—was established along the southern frontier of Hungary in the 1250s.\n\nBéla’s relationship with his oldest son and heir, Stephen, became tense in the early 1260s, because the elderly king favored his daughter Anna and his youngest child, Béla, Duke of Slavonia.\n\nHe was forced to cede the territories of the Kingdom of Hungary east of the river Danube to Stephen, which caused a civil war lasting until 1266. Nevertheless, Béla’s family was famed for his piety.\n\nKing Béla IV died on May 3, 1270 as a Franciscan tertiary, and the veneration of his three saintly daughters—Kunigunda, Yolanda, and Margaret—was confirmed by the Holy See.\n\nHis eldest son succeeded him as King Stephen V of Hungary and Croatia.\n\nLadislaus IV (August 5, 1262 – July 10, 1290) also known as Ladislas the Cuman, was king of Hungary and Croatia from 1272 to 1290.\n\nLadislaus was the elder son of Stephen V, son of Béla IV of Hungary, and Stephen’s wife Elizabeth the Cuman, (1244-1290) was the daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans who had settled in Hungary. She was born as a pagan and was baptized before her marriage to Stephen. She was regent of Hungary during the minority of her son from 1272 to 1277.\n\nThe Cumans were the western tribes of the Cuman-Kipchak confederation. Her people followed a shamanist religion and were considered pagans by contemporary Christians of Europe.\n\nIn 1238, Khan Köten, her father according to historians, led the Cumans and a number of other clans in invading the Kingdom of Hungary while fleeing from the advancing hordes of the Mongol Empire. In time, King Béla IV of Hungary negotiated an alliance with Köten and his people, granting them asylum in exchange for their conversion to Roman Catholicism and loyalty to the King. The agreement was sealed with the betrothal of Elizabeth.\n\nAt the age of seven, Ladislaus married Elisabeth (or Isabella) of Sicily, a daughter of King Charles I of Sicily his first wife Beatrice of Provence. Charles I (early 1226/1227 – 1285), commonly called Charles of Anjou, was youngest son of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile and was a member of the royal Capetian dynasty and the founder of the second House of Anjou. He was Count of Provence (1246–85) and Forcalquier in the Holy Roman Empire (1246–48, 1256–85), Count of Anjou and Maine (1246–85) in France. Charles of Anjou was also King of Sicily (1266–85) and Prince of Achaea (1278–85). In 1272, he was proclaimed King of Albania; and in 1277 he purchased a claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nConflicts between Ladislaus’s father (Stephen V) and grandfather (Béla IV) developed into a civil war in 1264. Béla IV’s troops, which were under the command of Ladislaus’s aunt, Anna, captured the castle of Sárospatak, where Ladislaus and his mother were staying and imprisoned him.\n\nBéla IV died on May 3, 1270, and Ladislaus’s father was crowned King Stephen V of Hungary and Croatia two weeks later; the new monarch, however, could not stabilize his rule. Béla IV’s closest advisors — Duchess Anna, and Béla IV’s former palatine, Henry Kőszegi — left Hungary and sought assistance from Anna’s son-in-law, King Ottokar II of Bohemia.\n\nThe newly appointed Ban of Slavonia, Joachim Gutkeled, also turned against Stephen V and kidnapped Ladislaus in the summer of 1272. Gutkeled held Ladislaus in captivity in the fortress of Koprivnica in Slavonia. Historian Pál Engel suggests that Joachim Gutkeled planned to force Stephen V to divide Hungary with Ladislaus. Stephen V besieged Koprivnica, but could not take it.\n\nLadislaus was still a prisoner when his father Stephen V fell seriously ill anddied on August 6, 1272. The young boy became King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and Croatia. Archbishop Philip of Esztergom crowned Ladislaus king in Székesfehérvár on about September 3. In theory, the 10-year-old Ladislaus ruled under his mother’s regency, but in fact, baronial parties administered the kingdom. In November of that year, Henry Kőszegi returned from Bohemia and assassinated Ladislaus’s cousin, Béla of Macsó. Duke Béla’s extensive domains, which were located along the southern borders, were divided among Henry Kőszegi and his supporters.\n\nDuring his minority, many groupings of barons — primarily the Abas, Csáks, Kőszegis, and Gutkeleds — fought against each other for supreme power. Ladislaus was declared to be of age at an assembly of the prelates, barons, noblemen, and Cumans in 1277. He allied himself with Rudolf I, King of Germany against King Ottokar II of Bohemia. His forces had a preeminent role in Rudolf’s victory over Ottokar in the Battle on the Marchfeld on August 26, 1278.\n\nHowever, Ladislaus could not restore royal power in Hungary. A papal legate, Philip, bishop of Fermo, came to Hungary to help Ladislaus consolidate his authority, but the prelate was shocked at the presence of thousands of pagan Cumans in Hungary.\n\nPhilip, bishop of Fermo, extracted a ceremonious promise from the Cuman chieftains of giving up their pagan customs, and persuaded the young King Ladislaus to swear an oath to enforce the keeping of the Cuman chieftains’ promise. An assembly held at Tétény passed laws which, in accordance with the legate’s demand, prescribed that the Cumans should leave their tents and live “in houses attached to the ground”.\n\nThe Cumans did not obey the laws, however, and Ladislaus, himself a half-Cuman, failed to force them. In retaliation, Bishop Philip excommunicated him and placed Hungary under interdict in October. Ladislaus joined the Cumans and appealed to the Holy See, but the Pope refused to absolve him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate’s partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans to submit to the legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary.\n\nLadislaus spent most of his marriage to Elisabeth chasing after the Cumans, encouraging them to come and live in Hungary. Ladislaus clearly preferred the society of the semi-heathen Cumans to that of the Christians; he wore, and made his court wear, Cuman dress; surrounded himself with Cuman concubines, and neglected and ill-used his ill-favoured Neapolitan consort.\n\nHungary also survived a Mongol invasion in 1285. Ladislaus had, by that time, become so unpopular that many of his subjects accused him of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary.\n\nIn September 1286, After the Mongol invasion, Ladislaus had his wife Elisabeth arrested in so that he could live openly with his Cuman mistress. Ladislaus granted her all of Elizabeth’s revenues and had Elizabeth imprisoned on Margaret Island, where she stayed for the next three years.\n\nThe barons captured Ladislaus in the Szepesség in January 1288. Although his partisans soon liberated him, he acquiesced in concluding an agreement with Archbishop Lodomer. The archbishop absolved Ladislaus on condition that the king would live in accordance with Christian morals.\n\nArchbishop Lodomer liberated Queen Elizabeth and Ladislaus was finally reconciled with Elisabeth in 1289. When he found he did not have enough power to rule over his barons, he rejoined the Cumans…and his mistress.\n\nThe archbishop summoned the prelates, the barons, and the noblemen to an assembly in Buda and excommunicated Ladislaus. In response, the infuriated king stated that “beginning with the archbishop of Esztergom and his suffragans, I shall exterminate the whole lot right up to Rome with the aid of Tartar swords”, according to Archbishop Lodomer.\n\nLadislaus abducted his sister, Elizabeth, prioress of the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits’ Island, and gave her in marriage to a Czech aristocrat, Zavis of Falkenstein. According to Archbishop Lodomer, Ladislaus even stated, “If I had 15 or more sisters in as many cloistered communities as you like, I would snatch them from there to marry them off licitly or illicitly; in order to procure through them a kin-group who will support me by all their power in the fulfillment of my will”.\n\nLadislaus spent the last years of his life wandering from place to place. Hungary’s central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of King Ladislaus who was merelya figurehead at that time. For example, Ivan Kőszegi and his brothers waged wars against Albert I, Duke of Austria, but Ladislaus did not intervene, although the Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses along the western borders.\n\nThe Kőszegis offered the crown to the Árpád prince, Andrew the Venetian, who arrived in Hungary in early 1290. One of their opponents, Arnold Hahót, captured the pretender, however, and surrendered him to Duke Albert. Ladislaus appointed Mizse, who had recently converted from Islam to Christianity, palatine.\n\nPope Nicholas IV was even planning to proclaim a crusade against Ladislaus. However, ironically, Ladislaus, who had always been partial towards his Cuman subjects as we have seen, was assassinated by three Cumans, named Árbóc, Törtel, and Kemence, at the castle of Körösszeg (now Cheresig in Romania) on July 10, 1290.\n\nMizse and the Cuman Nicholas, who was the brother of Ladislaus’s Cuman lover, took vengeance for Ladislaus’s death, slaughtering the murderers.\n\nUpon Pope Nicholas IV’s orders, an inquiry was carried out to find out “whether the king died as a Catholic Christian”. The results of the investigation are unknown, but the Chronicon Budense writes that Ladislaus was buried in the cathedral of Csanád (now Cenad in Romania). His successor, Andrew III the Venetian, and Pope Benedict VIII recalled Ladislaus as “of renowned memory”.\n\nHere is a little information about his successor, Andrew III the Venetian. Andrew was the son of Stephen the Posthumous, the self-styled Duke of Slavonia, and his second wife, Tomasina Morosini, the daughter of wealthy Venetian patrician Michele Morosini.\n\nAndrew’s father was born to Beatrice D’Este, the third wife of King Andrew II of Hungary, but after the king’s death. However, Andrew II’s two elder sons, King Béla IV of Hungary and Coloman of Halych, accused Beatrice D’Este of adultery and refused to acknowledge Stephen the Posthumous as their legitimate brother.\n\nBeing the last male member of the House of Árpád, Andrew was elected King of Hungary and Croatia after the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew’s maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.\n\nJust as during the reign of Ladislaus IV, Hungary was in a state of constant anarchy during Andrew III’s reign."
