St. Stephen I of Hungary (997-1038) was the first King of Hungary and worked to convert Hungary to Christianity. He established churches, schools, and monasteries throughout Hungary and strengthened the new Christian kingdom. After his death, Hungary experienced instability until his cousin Andrew I restored the Árpád dynasty in 1047. Samuel Aba ruled briefly from 1041-1044 after removing Peter Urseolo from the throne, while Peter ruled twice with interruptions from 1038-1046. Both Peter and Samuel faced opposition from the Hungarian nobility.",
