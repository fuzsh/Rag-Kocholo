        "text": "Hah, I didn't realize this was meant to be a request for evidence that the relation is already the case OTL. I thought it was asking how to arrange for this state of affairs.\n\nI'd think the Mongols could easily have established a Khanate in Poland or even farther west, in Germany or heck, taken all of continental Europe. Confining ourselves to a more modest scenario where it's just say Poland alone, after a while, a couple centuries or so, the Khanate might remain but the ruling family will in the interim have converted to Roman Catholicism (or conceivably Orthodoxy, which drags Poland's culture eastward to become part of Russia, but this would require reconverting the population, which I believe was Catholic by the time the Mongols showed). And started to form alliances including intermarriages in Western Europe.\n\nConceivably a Khanate-descended monarchy in Poland might be more durable than the OTL elective monarchy; it might assume the historical roles of both the Lithuanian house that swept down to the Black Sea and the Prussians--we might wind up with north Germany being subsumed into the Greater Polish Khanate!\n\nAnyway somewhere in there surely any or all of the various ruling houses of Europe including the British might have sealed an alliance with marriage and voila, Genghis Khan is ancestor of every crowned head of Europe.\n\nI think this scenario makes a lot of sense, especially if the Eastern European Khanate transforms into the Polish equivalent of Bulgaria or Hungary.\n\nThere are numerous attested or conjectured Turkic or Mongol descents into European nobility and royalty.\n\nIn Russia, we find most of the Mongol intermarriages. Prince Feodor Rostislavich of Yaroslavl married the daughter of Mengu-Timur, a grandson of Batu khan, and had children by her. Numerous other Rurikid princes married Kuman princesses.\n\nSuleiman the Magnificent's mother was possibly Hafsa Hatun, a daughter of Mengli I Giray, khan of the Crimea, and therefore a descendant of Genghis Khan.\n\nThe origins of the Bulgarian Asenid dynasty, founded by three brothers (Ivan Asen I, Teodor-Kalopeter, and Kaloyan) are much disputed, with Bulgarians preferring to think of them as Bulgars and Romanians preferring to think of them as Vlakhs, and so forth and so on. Ivan Asen had a Turkic name (Esen, healthy) and his contemporary Niketas Choniates says that Ivan Asen spoke the Vlakh language. Another contemporary source, a letter from Pope Innocent III to Kaloyan, mentions Kaloyan's \"Roman\" ancestry, but whether this means Italian or Byzantine Greek (romaioi), we don't know.\n\nI strongly suspect the three brothers were of mixed, probably Kuman-Vlakh-Bulgar, descent. Kaloyan's wife was a Kuman, and after his death (probably masterminded by herself and Boril), she remarried to his nephew and successor, Boril. Kaloyan's half-Kuman daughter, Marija, married Emperor Henry of Constantinople.\n\nI want to correct the oft-repeated factoid that Erszébet, wife of King Istvan V of Hungary, was the daughter of Köten (Kuthen) khan. Nora Berend in \"At the Gate of Christendom: Jews, Muslims, and \"pagans\" in Medieval Hungary (2001)\" rejects this entirely, citing evidence that Erszébet's parents were baptized in 1254. Zayhan khan was mentioned as King Bela IV's relative (\"cognatus noster\") and as chief of the Kumans (\"dux cumanorum\") in a 1255 charter. Erszébet's father must've been a great chief, as her seal described her as \"daughter of the emperor of the Kumans\".\n\nChronologically, it is unlikely Köten was Erszébet's father. He was a great Kuman chief with an adult son, Daniil, who was old enough to be a war leader himself in 1222 when the Kumans faced off against the Mongols. Köten was likely at least forty in 1222. He led the Kumans into Hungary in 1239, but when he was seized by the Hungarian nobles in 1241, Köten killed his wives and then himself. Afterward, Zayhan khan appears as the chief of the Kumans in Hungary after Köten's death. Possibly he was a son or another close relative of Köten. We know Köten had a son named Daniil and a brother named Yuri. Regardless, seeing as how Köten and all his wives died in 1241, they could not have been baptized in 1254, thirteen years later! Zayhan khan is more likely to be the father of Erszébet.\n\nThe wikipedia article on Köten khan lumps him together with Zayhan khan and Jonas, apparently taking the position that there was only one Kuman khan, ever. Many Kumans had flooded into the Latin Empire, fleeing the Mongols, in the late 1230s, and a Kuman chief named Sytzigan (Turkic: Sicgan, mouse) entered Byzantine service in 1241 or 1242. Saronius \"rex\" of the Kumans, probably identical to Sytzigan, had two daughters, one who married Guillaume, son of the constable Geoffroi de Meri, and the other who married Baudouin de Hainaut, a knight of Constantinople, according to Alberic de Trois-Fontaines. Another prominent lord of Latin Constantinople, Narjot (Narillaut) de Toucy, married the daughter of Jonas, another Kuman \"rex\".\n\nIn Georgia, Queen Rusudan married Orthul, son of the sultan of the neighboring Selcuk state of Erzurum. Orthul converted to Christianity on the orders of his father in order to marry Rusudan. It's actually a little mysterious as to why Rusudan married Orthul, as Erzurum was a weak state and already subservient to Georgia at the time. My suspicion is that the glamor of a legitimate Selcuk princeling appealed to her (and according to various chronicles, Rusudan was a big fan of good-looking men; it wouldn't surprise me if Orthul had possessed a handsome face). Rusudan's mother Tamar's first husband (but not Rusudan's father) was Yuri Bogolyubsky, who was a quarter-Kipchak (great-grandson of Aepa khan via one of the Russian/Turkic princely marriages) and spent a good part of his young life amongst the Kumans.\n\nBizarrely, in the 1190s, Orthul's uncle Rukneddin, the Selcuk sultan at the time, had tried to conquer Georgia during the reign of Rusudan's mother, Queen Tamar. This is one of my favorite \"he said, she said\" moments of history. According to the Georgian chroniclers, Rukneddin sent an insulting letter to Tamar, declaring his intention to make her his \"Christian concubine or his Muslim wife\". The Selcuk chronicler, Ibn Bibi, claimed that Queen Tamar was so inflamed with lust for Rukneddin that she tried to seduce him, and the sultan was forced to invade Georgia to defend his honor (!!!).\n\nRusudan and Orthul's children were Davit VI Narin of Georgia and Tamar, wife of her cousin Keyhüsrev II. The subsequent Georgian kings Konstantini I, Mikeli I, Vakhtang II, as well as kings Bagrat I, Aleksandri I, Georgi I, and Konstantini I of Imereti, were all male-line Selcuk descendants.\n\nSeveral Byzantine noble families were descended from Turks who converted to Christianity and pledged their service to the empire. One notable family was that of Axoukh, several members of which married into the Komnenoi Imperial Family."
