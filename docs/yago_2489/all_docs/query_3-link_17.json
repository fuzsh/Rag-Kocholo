It replaces the City-State of Budapest with Lviv.\n\nOverview[]\n\nHungary[]\n\nHungary was an important medieval kingdom settled by the Uralic Magyar people in the 9th century AD. During the Middle Ages, Hungary was a crucial piece of Christian Europe's defense against Ottoman incursion. The kingdom collapsed in the 16th century but Hungary persisted as an important battleground between Christian Europe and Muslim invaders. Hungary has remained relevant as a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire in the 1800s, the Soviet Bloc during the Cold War, and the European Union since.\n\nStephen I[]\n\nStephen I, also Saint Stephen, was the last Grand Prince of the Hungarians between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first King of Hungary from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038. He was born as Vajk in Esztergom. The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975. He was the only son of Grand Prince Géza and his wife, Sarolt, who was descended from the prominent family of the gyulas. Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of his family to become a devout Christian. He married Gisela of Bavaria, a scion of the imperial Ottonian dynasty.\n\nDawn of Man[]\n\nMost holy and apostolic King Stephen of Hungary, we are blessed with your audience. You ascended the throne of Hungary a Grand Prince, but in your wake would leave it a powerful and formidable kingdom; envied across Europe for its piety and devotion to God. Forged from the ideals of Charlemagne's enlightened empire, the Hungarian Kingdom would become a bastion of western and Christian virtue, waging countless defences against the Muslim Turks, and championing the divine right and sanctity of her apostolic Kings. As sovereign, you would force back the powers that sought to subjugate the lands of the Carpathian Mountains, and you would ensure stability for the Kingdom under the guide of your unyielding faith and devastating military prowess; earning Hungary her place as one of the foremost powers of medieval Europe.\n\nO blessed Stephen, who art adorned as the herald of a glorious age, your people call for a monarch to wield her ancient duties. Can you bear this sacred and holy crown? Can you fashion from barbarity a kingdom once more emblazoned with honour and devotion? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?\n\nIntroduction: Hah-hah! A venerable friend or foe has entered my court! I am Stephen, King of Hungary. Come! I have prepared a feast for your arrival.\n\nIntroduction: Bless you, friend. I am Stephen, King of Hungary. You have no doubt journeyed far to my court. Please; there are no evils here. This kingdom of mine is a kingdom of God, and by God it is a place of great virtue and piety unmatched in all the world.\n\nDefeat: Your soul is stained black with a great and unquenchable evil. Hungary will not forgive this treachery, and she shall have her vengeance.\n\nDefeat: I damn you and your empire in the sight of God. I will act swift and gather my forces, and I will rally the full might of Hungary - a might like that which you have never seen - and I will undo this wretched blasphemy.\n\nStrategy[]\n\nUnique Attributes[]\n\nMusic[]\n\nPeace Theme War Theme \"Order of the Temple\" by Andreas Waldetoft for the soundtrack of Crusader Kings II. \"?\" by Richard Vaughan.\n\nMod Support[]\n\nMod Support Yes\n\nCommunity Balance Patch\n\nUnknown Yes\n\nEthnic Units\n\nYes Yes Yes\n\nMap Labels\n\nYes Unknown Unknown Yes\n\nUnique Cultural Influence\n\nNo\n\nWish for the World\n\nYes\n\nYnAEMP\n\nYes\n\nEvents and Decisions[]\n\nEstablish an Archdiocese[]\n\nIn all the world there is no more faithful nation than that of the Hungarians.
