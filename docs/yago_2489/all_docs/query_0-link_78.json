        "text": "From the Pagan Hungarian Prince Árpád to British Queen Elizabeth II, thirty-nine generations follow each other through more than a thousand years of European history.\n\nDid you know? This is not fake news and just like most European monarchs today, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II also has the blood of the ancient Hungarian Árpád Dynasty in her veins — with Árpád the Conqueror, and kings András I, Béla III, and András II among her ancestors.\n\nJust recently, Great Britain and the Commonwealth of Nations are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the accession, that is, the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, of the House of Windsor (the House of Saxe–Coburg and Gotha, originally), whose ancestors include many different blue-blooded members of royal dynasties of Europe.\n\nSo, the blood of Árpád Dynasty is also part of the genetic makeup of the British royal family.\n\nElizabeth II is a descendant of the Hungarian conqueror Árpád — of the female branches. On her family tree going back 1100 years, her lineage can be precisely traced back through subsequent generations of Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Castilian, Aragonese, French, Scottish, and English kings, queens, and princesses.\n\nAs we read this long list of names of major personalities of European and world history, as well as forgotten princes and princesses, we get a glimpse of the rich and multi-layered history of our continent.\n\nFrom Árpád, thirty-nine generations (counting Prince Charles and Prince William, and the little Prince George, forty-two generations) succeeded from the Eastern European steppe in the 9th century to the 21st Century.\n\nThe Family Tree:\n\nÁrpád, the first prince of the Hungarian conquerors at the end of the 9th century\n\nZolta (Solt, Zsolt)\n\nTaksony\n\nMihály (Prince Géza’s younger brother, uncle of the first King of Hungary, Stephen I)\n\nVazul\n\nAndrás I (1015-1060), 4th king of Hungary\n\nAdelhaid (1040-1062); her husband was King Vratislav II of Bohemia\n\nJudit (1057-1086) of Bohemia; her husband was the Polish Prince Władysław I Herman\n\nBolesław III Krzywousty, Polish Prince (1085-1138)\n\nWładysław Wygnaniec, Polish Prince (1105-1159)\n\nRicheza of Poland (1140-1185); her husband was King Alfonso VII of León and Castile\n\nSancha of Castile (1154/5-1208); her husband was King Alfonso II of Aragon\n\nKing Peter II of Aragon (1174-1213); his sibling was Constance of Aragon who became the wife of King Imre of Hungary\n\nJames I of Aragon (1213-1276); his wife was Hungarian Princess Jolánta (András II’s daughter, granddaughter of Béla III, great-granddaughter of Géza II—a double Hungarian connection here)\n\nIsabella of Aragon (1247-1271); her husband was Philip III of France\n\nPhilip IV of France (Philip the Fair) (1268-1314), one of the most significant kings in the history of France\n\nIsabella of France (1295-1398); her husband was King Edward II of England\n\nKing Edward III of England (1312-1377)\n\nJohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (1340-1398/9)\n\nJohn Beaufort, Earl of Somerset (1373-1410), the illegitimate son of John of Gaunt\n\nJohn Beaufort, Duke of Somerset (1404-1444)\n\nLady Margaret Beaufort (1443-1509); her husband was Edmund Tudor\n\nKing Henry VII of England (1456/7-1509)\n\nMargaret Tudor (1489-1541), King Henry VIII’s sibling\n\nKing James V of Scotland (1512-1542)\n\nMary Stuart I, Queen of Scotland (1542-1587)\n\nKing James I of Scotland and England (1566-1625)\n\nElizabeth Stuart (1596- 1662); her husband was Frederick V of the Palatine, the Winter King\n\nPrincess Sophia (1630-1714); her husband was Elector Ernest Augustus of Hanover\n\nGeorge I of England (1660-1727)\n\nGeorge II of England (1683-1760)\n\nFrederick, Prince of Wales (1706/7-1751)\n\nGeorge III of England (1738-1820)\n\nPrince Edward, Duke of Kent (1767-1820)\n\nQueen Victoria (1819-1901); her husband was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nKing Edward VII of England (1841-1910)\n\nKing George V of England (1865-1936)\n\nKing George VI of England (1895-1952)\n\nQueen Elizabeth II (1926- )"
