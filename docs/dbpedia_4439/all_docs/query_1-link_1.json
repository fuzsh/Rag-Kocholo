        "text": "Philip Snowden\n\nWinston S. Churchill\n\n[Reprinted from the book, Great Contemporaries,\n\noriginally published by W.W. Norton & Company, 1932]\n\nWhat sort of picture does the average man and woman make of the political figures of the present day? How far is it removed from the truth? How far is it a caricature? Do the millions form their opinions from the cartoons and comments of the newspapers? Or have they some deep instinct which enables them to discern the real character and worth of their public men?\n\nUndoubtedly when politicians, or statesmen as they like to be called, have been long on the stage, their fellow-countrymen have a pretty shrewd idea of their quality and value. About new people suddenly lifted by the Press or the Caucus, or both, to national prominence, the average man or woman (we always have to say 'or woman' now they have the vote) may easily be misled and is rightly distrustful. That is why our vast electorate, like its smaller predecessors, likes to be governed by well-known personalities or even by well-known names. They like to act upon an impression of a man gathered, shall we say, across a quarter of a century. They feel that on such a survey, taking the rough with the smooth, they can form a clear like or dislike, a definite agreement or opposition.\n\nIt would be wrong to think of Mr Snowden as the spiteful, vindictive death's head of his caricatures, as a sworn tormentor who used the Rack, the Thumbscrew and the Little Ease of taxation with gusto upon his victims. He was really a tender-hearted man, who would not have hurt a gnat unless his party and the Treasury told him to do so, and then only with compunction. Philip Snowden was a remarkable figure of our time. He was among the chief architects of the Labour-Socialist Party. He was the first and so far the only Socialist Chancellor of the Exchequer. He played a decisive part in the political convulsion which hurled the Socialists from power in 1931 and inaugurated the National Government regime twice acclaimed by enormous majorities.\n\nFor nearly forty years Philip Snowden steadily and consistently built up the Socialist Party. He faced all its misfortunes, swallowed and reproduced most of its follies; and he held an indisputable right to share its years of prosperity. The first quality that the British nation approved in Philip Snowden was that they knew where he stood.\n\nHe was no more a doctrinaire Socialist than Ramsay MacDonald, but he revolted from Socialism at a different angle. MacDonald liked the Tory atmosphere and tradition; the glamour of old England appealed to him. Snowden viewed the Socialist creed with the blister ing intellectual contempt of the old Gladstonian Radical. To him Toryism was a physical annoyance, and militant Socialism a disease brought on by bad conditions or contagion, like rickets or mange. His heart was filled with an equal measure of disgust and pity when he contemplated the true-blue Conservative or the green-eyed Socialist.\n\nThere are few survivors now. Gladstonian Radicals are a very arrogant brood. To begin with they are quite sure they know all about everything. For them the world might have much to do, but it had nothing to know after the days of Queen Victoria. Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill wrote it all out quite plainly, Cobden, Bright, and with some backsliding due, as they opine, to his bad early environment, Mr Gladstone, expressed it with admirable eloquence. The solitary new teacher whom they will admit very suspiciously to their mental parlours is Mr Henry George -- (not Mr Lloyd George by any manner of means!). Henry George with his Land Taxation impinged roughly upon the Victorian Radicals, There was a leak, it seemed, in the diving-bell in which they dwelt. It was an undoubted leak. It might be deplored, but it had to be faced; otherwise not a chink, crack or crevice had been opened in their system of thought by half a century of shock and change.\n\nSnowden's rigidity of doctrine was otherwise impenetrable. Free imports, no matter what the foreigner may do to us; the Gold Standard, no matter how short we run of gold; austere repayment of debt, no matter how we have to borrow the money; high progressive direct taxation, even if it brings creative energies to a standstill; the 'Free breakfast-table,' even if it is entirely supplied from outside the British jurisdiction! Their one weakness, their one indulgence, their one relish - the exceptional taxation of the value of the land, which, as has been often mentioned, 'God gave to the people'. For the rest, resistance to all wars, even the most inevitable, and dour, cold aversion from all imperial possessions and assets, even those from which large numbers of cottage homes gain the employment which gives them their daily bread. As for those who cannot understand or will not believe these doctrines, it were better for them that a millstone were bound about their neck and that they were cast out into the Primrose League or into the Independent Labour Party.\n\nWe must imagine with what joy Mr Snowden was welcomed at the Treasury by the permanent officials. All British Chancellors of the Exchequer have yielded themselves, some spontaneously, some unconsciously, some reluctantly, to that compulsive intellectual atmosphere. But here was the High Priest entering the sanctuary. The Treasury mind and the Snowden mind embraced each other with the fervour of two long-separated kindred lizards and the reign of joy began. Unhappily, a lot of things cropped up which were very tiresome. First of all the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to go on pretending he was a Socialist, the wordy champion of the class war and so on. This was awkward when a 'statesmanlike' speech had to be made to the Bankers, of an appeal made to the public to buy Saving Certificates. Then the finances had been left in such a shocking state by that profligate Mr Churchill that the new Chancellor of the Exchequer in his difficulties had to adopt just the same kind of devices he had blamed so harshly in his predecessor. Economy, too, was very baffling when the Tories had kept the military services at the minimum, and all the Socialists put their trust in the Dole as the last hope of Party salvation. Upon these incongruities there is no need to dwell.\n\nI have, of course, no sympathy with the cause which Snowden championed. The destruction of Liberalism by the Labour movement and the ranging of the less contented and less prosperous millions of our countrymen under the foreign and fallacious standards of Socialism has been a disaster to the British people, the consequences of which are only gradually becoming apparent. It has been attended with a decline in the progress of democracy, with a marked discrediting of universal suffrage, and with the decay of the parliamentary institutions by which the liberties of England were won. A crudeness and dullness has been brought into the discussion of every question which can already be sharply contrasted with the tenseness of Victorian debates, and the strict control then exerted by the House of Commons over the Executive.\n\nThe promulgation by great organized parties of a programme of nationalizing all the means of production, distribution and exchange, coupled with the cosmopolitan, anti-patriotic mood, has produced in Europe violent reactions towards the extremes of nationalism and the tyrannies of dictatorship. If in our island these results have not yet become apparent, it is only because Socialists, when they become Ministers, largely abandon in practice the doctrines and principles by preaching which they have risen to power. It was undoubtedly a grave mischief and injury, not only to the working people but to the whole nation, to found a class party affianced to visionary principles which could only be translated into action by desperate civil commotion and the ruin of British freedom and greatness.\n\nAfter thirty years of faithful, tireless labour in building up this new party Philip Snowden found himself compelled by public duty to turn the whole of his vitriolic eloquence and propagandism against his own creation, and chose to end his political life as a Viscount in the hereditary Assembly which he had so long laboured to destroy. The apparent contradiction of spending a lifetime in creating the Socialist Party and then striking it with unconcealed relish its fatal blow does not, when all is considered, expose him to any charge of instability or inconsistency of purpose. All his life he sincerely hated Toryism, Jingoism, Vested Interests, and what are called 'The Upper Classes'. On the other hand, he never had the slightest intention of taking part in any revolutionary movement, nor would he in any circumstances have become responsible for a state of laxity and demoralization, financial or political, which would endanger the solid foundations of the established monarchical, parliamentary and capitalist system. On the contrary, confronted with the imminence of a breakdown in the existing order of things and national bankruptcy, he not only withstood his own friends and colleagues, but fell upon them with a wholehearted ferocity which astounded the public and delighted the greater part of it.\n\nA distinction must be drawn between his conduct and that of Mr Ramsay MacDonald. In the hour of national emergency Snowden quitted and at the same time almost destroyed the party he had made. But as soon as the crisis had passed he sought occasion to break with his new allies and become again the lively exponent of the ideas he had championed all his life. He did not dream of continuing in his office as a quasi-Conservative Minister. Whether, if he had been the head of the Government, he would have acted differently cannot be known. The pleasures and pomps of Ministerial life, such as they are, the amenities of elegant and opulent society, made no appeal to him. Nothing that could be offered by the ruling forces in our Commonwealth swayed his judgment or his action.\n\nThe crisis surmounted, he shook off his new friends with the same thorough-paced vigour as he had his old. The violence of his denunciations of the Socialists in 1931 was matched by the terms in which he upbraided the National Government in 1935. This apparent catholicity of animosities gave him the appearance of a kind of fierce dog who would bite anyone and everyone for biting's sake. Actually it arose from an extreme integrity of personal conviction from which only a supreme emergency justified a temporary departure. Such a man, had he been a Spaniard, might have saved Spain the horrors of civil war by upholding democratic and parliamentary government with an iron hand. Such a man was the German Socialist Noske who saved Germany from Communism in 1919. Snowden knew exactly how far he meant to go, and when pushed beyond that limit reacted with a violence at once salutary and astonishing.\n\nThe story which he has written of his early life\" makes us all not only respect his character, but also admire the free, tolerant Constitution of England under which he rose from a humble cottage in a Yorkshire village to be Chancellor of the Exchequer in the richest country in the world and, if that be promotion, a Viscount among its ancient aristocracy. The tale reveals to us the dignity and spaciousness of an English cottage home. He displays the riches of poverty when sustained by strict principles, by religious faith, and by a keen interest in social evolution. We hear discussions between his father and his uncle upon predestination, election, and hellfire, and the decisive summing-up of his mother:\n\nYou say that God loves us as we love our own children. Do you think I would put one of my children into hell-fire? No! not however bad he'd been.\n\nWe see this little row of cottagers, who drew their water from a well in the adjoining field, rising in physical revolt against the attempt of the landowner's agent to make a charge for its use. Who can wonder at the bent given to a child's mind by such a spectacle and such an experience? Philip was a clever boy and soon top of the village school. To those to whom his crippled figure was so familiar it is strange to learn that no one could beat him at running and jumping. He became a pupil teacher. He passed the prescribed examination for a lower grade of the Civil Service, and became a 'gauger and surveyor of Inland Revenue' in the Treasury, of which he was afterwards twice to be the Ministerial chief.\n\nBut it is the third phase of his life which most powerfully commands sympathy. Hopelessly crippled by an affection of the spine which followed a slight accident, he was forced to leave the Civil Service. His father had died. He returned with his mother to his native village of Ickornshaw, now noted in the Peerage. For ten years he traversed the length and breadth of the island, as a Socialist lecturer and agitator. To say that these were years of struggle against poverty would be altogether to misconceive their quality. Philip Snowden vanquished poverty from the outset by the simple process of reducing his own wants to so rigorous a compass that upon thirty shillings a week, which was all that he would take for his lectures, he was able to pursue a great world issue and lead a life of proud independence. He was a preaching friar with no Superior to obey but his intellect. In this latter day period, when riches count so much and the fear of poverty haunts so many, there are moral lessons of the highest value for all classes in this modest account.\n\nI first met him many years ago when I was a young Liberal Minister and he one of the small band of Independent Labour men who nevertheless found themselves forced to conform to the main policy of the Asquith Government. We travelled for four hours together to Lancashire. Then, for the first time, I saw beneath this apparently bitter and even spiteful spirit and regard something of the appeal and kindliness of his nature. His face, though in a way twisted by pain, ill-health and the mood of revolt, was lighted by a smile truly disarming, comprehending and delightful. Afterwards it fell to my lot for seven years to wrangle with him about finance as Chancellor of the Exchequer, or in opposition to his Chancellorship, and we hit each other as hard as we could within the wide rules of Order. But never have I had any feelings towards him which destroyed the impression that he was a generous, true-hearted man.\n\nThe Marxian aberration never obsessed his keen intelligence. One who knew him well said to me, 'No one will ever know what a Labour Government will be like till they see one without Snowden at the Exchequer.' Arrived at the post, he confronted his colleagues with a resistance to wild and sloppy extravagance, however popular, which staggered them. Although overborne on many points, he continued to fight for what he regarded as the essential principles of sound finance, and the friction of this conflict roused him to the fury and even hatred with which he eventually assailed his friends and colleagues.\n\nThe British democracy should be proud of Philip Snowden. He was a man capable of maintaining the structure of Society while at the same time championing the interests of the masses. His long life of effort, self-denial and physical affliction was crowned by honourable success. His fearlessness, his rectitude, his austerity, his sobriety of judgment, his deep love of Britain and his studiously concealed, but intense, pride in British greatness, distinguish him as one of the true worthies of our age. His life of privation, of affliction, of self-discipline, of wartime odium, had a grand culmination. The history of Parliament will not ignore the scene when the House of Commons rose to their feet in enthusiasm as he recited the famous lines:\n\nAll our past proclaims the future: Shakespeare's voice and Nelson's hand, Milton's faith and Wordsworth's trust in this our chosen and chainless land,\n\nBear us witness .. .\n\nCome the world against her, England yet shall stand!"
