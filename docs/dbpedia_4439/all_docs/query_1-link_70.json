        "text": "The debates and discussions around the different options facing the socialist movement in Britain took place against a background of change in capitalism. Capital accumulation was resumed on an extended scale, yet in a very different form than in earlier periods. The real nature of the crisis in Britain — a crisis of gradually declining profitability — was both disguised and offset by a massive export of capital overseas by British finance houses. Capital investment was expanding rapidly, but it was expanding outside Britain. The massive profits reaped by the financial houses increased the divisions between financial and industrial capital with important consequences for British politics, but from the point of view of capital as a whole, accumulation was able to take place on a far wider scale than before."
