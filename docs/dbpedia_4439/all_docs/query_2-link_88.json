        "text": "Budgets 1907 - 1945\n\n1907 Budget (HH Asquith)\n\nIntroduced differential taxation (ie between earned and unearned income).\n\n1908 Budget (HH Asquith)\n\n(Introduced by Asquith as Prime Minister following his recent elevation from the Chancellorship) A historic budget which introduced the first old age pensions. These were at a rate of 5 shillings (25p) per week for all those with an income of less than 10 shillings per week (apart from criminals, lunatics or those who had been paupers within the previous year). Married couples got 8 shillings and ninepence (44p).\n\n1909 Budget (David Lloyd George)\n\nThe 'People's Budget'. Introduced 'super-tax' at a rate of 6d (2.5p) in the pound on the amount by which incomes of £5,000 or more exceeded £3,000. The rejection by the House of Lords of these measures in the Finance Bill eventually led to the removal of the Lords' power of veto over 'money bills' under the Parliament Act of 1911. Lloyd George used these funds to pay for the new old age pensions and a naval re-armament programme.\n\nWinston Churchill, Chancellor 1924 - 1929\n\n1925 Budget (Winston Churchill)\n\nRestored the Gold Standard. This budget effectively revalued the pound and was blamed by many economists for Britain's relatively slow economic growth rate. The standard was abandoned again in 1931.\n\n1926 Budget - (Winston Churchill)\n\nIntroduced a tax on betting (which was widely evaded and abolished three years later).\n\n1931 (September) Budget (Philip Snowden)\n\nThe first budget of the new National Government. A drastic budget in which taxes were raised and unemployment benefits and the salaries of government employees were reduced. The latter measure led to the Invergordon Naval mutiny, and demonstrations by teachers and others. The formation of the National government and these measures were designed to end the financial crisis and keep the pound sterling on the gold standard; however a week or so later Britain left the gold standard.\n\n1934 Budget (Neville Chamberlain)\n\nBegan to restore the budget cuts made in 1931.\n\nNeville Chamberlain\n\nChancellor, 1931 - 1937\n\n1935 Budget (Neville Chamberlain)\n\nCompletes the process of restoring the cuts made in 1931.\n\n1936 Budget (Neville Chamberlain)\n\nChamberlain cut income tax by 3d. A Tribunal of Inquiry found the Dominions Secretary, JH ('Jimmy') Thomas, guilty of a budget leak. Thomas consequently resigned from the government and the House of Commons.\n\n1941 Budget (Sir Kingsley Wood)\n\nThe first budget to be framed on 'Keynesian' lines, ie planned for a deficit. It also raised income tax to 10 shillings (50p) in the pound and increased the numbers of working class people paying income tax.\n\nReturn to the top of this page\n\nBudget History Index\n\nBudgets 1733-1885, 1945-79, 1979-92, 1993-95, 1996"
