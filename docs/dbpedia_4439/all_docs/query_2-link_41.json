        "text": "It was the last general election not to be held on a Thursday, and 1931 is distinctive too as a warning of what can go wrong when sensible people get together to make sensible decisions with the best of intentions.\n\nIn August 1931 Britain's second Labour government collapsed under the weight of its own self-doubt. Unconvinced by either their own record in office or their ability to steer Britain out of accelerating economic decline, Labour's two leading ministers - the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, and the chancellor, Philip Snowden, - agreed to join a Conservative-led coalition, known as the National Government, that split the Labour party.\n\nThat ministry of all the talents shed some supporters before it was confirmed in office in the October 1931 election. More supporters left as the 1935 election approached - by which time its Conservative nature was clear and the Conservative leader, Stanley Baldwin, had taken over at Number 10. But in substance the National government created in 1931 lasted in power until Winston Churchill took office in 1940.\n\nIt lasted so long because it was popular - hugely so in the case of the 1931 election. In retrospect history has not been kind to the political classes of 1930s Britain. Winston Churchill, the great doubter who never warmed to the government his party dominated, set the tone from the backbenches and confirmed it in his post-war book The Gathering Storm. Others - Lloyd George, Clement Attlee, Oswald Moseley - shared his scepticism.\n\nThey believed that while Europe was falling sway to the age of the great dictators, Britain was drifting towards the fourth decade of the twentieth century in the hands of ageing centrists, scarred by their experience of the first world war and afraid to question their own sunny suburbanisation even as the political sky darkened over Europe.\n\nBut that was a minority view at the time. Voters welcomed what they saw as a route to stability, prosperity and peace. This was the age of Metroland and motoring - as well as of the Jarrow march.\n\nLabour's grip on power, never sure after it won the most seats, but no majority, in May 1929, began to falter in early 1931 as the economy weakened. The party had been secured in office with the backing of Lloyd George's Liberals but by August its parliamentary position was becoming less secure by the day amid calls for spending cuts and the growing cost of rapidly rising unemployment.\n\nThat put pressure not just on the budget but on the pound, expensively reattached to the gold standard by Churchill as chancellor in 1925.\n\nThe day before the summer recess began an \"economy committee\" under the leadership of a city businessman, Sir George May, reported Britain faced a Â£120m deficit: the country, his report implied, might not be able to pay its way.\n\nIn retrospect that was probably never the case - and Labour historians long blamed their government's collapse on a \"banker's ramp\", or swindle. But at the time, the May committee, established in February 1931 under cross-party pressure, was treated by almost everyone as an unquestionable authority. The reaction to the report brought down the government - and led to the election that followed.\n\nOn August 13 MacDonald met the leading Tories, Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain, to discuss the position. A week later leading politicians from all parties met again to hear MacDonald promise that Britain would balance the budget. Spending cuts would help bridge the gap, including salary cuts for teachers and the police.\n\nThat was what the opposition wanted to hear. But it was not what most Labour ministers, or MPs, believed they had been elected to carry out. On August 22, as the crisis worsened, the king returned to London from Scotland - broken summer holidays were a feature of political life that year.\n\nOn Sunday August 23 the cabinet met but balked at cutting unemployment benefit, as Snowden wanted. Later demonised by his former party as a dry, uncaring tecnocrat, Snowden was never a popular or personable politician - but he was determined to stand by his budget.\n\nEncouraged by the King, who liked Labour's leaders but not Labour - though the extent of royal pressure is debatable - MacDonald and Snowden agreed to the creation of an emergency National government the next day. Both men remained in their jobs: Baldwin joined as Lord President of the Council while other Tories and Liberals took lesser jobs.\n\nThe impact was immediate. All but 14 Labour MPs refused to stand by their prime minister and went into opposition. The Liberals, already split between Lloyd George's supporters and the rest, split again, into an opposition and a national faction.\n\nBritain prepared for an emergency budget and a likely election. At the creation of the National government it was far from clear whether it would last more than the few weeks needed to slash spending and secure the pound.\n\nWhen parliament returned on September 8, the new government had a majority of 59. On September 10 Snowden raised taxes and cut spending in the budget; 10 days later he took Britain off the gold standard.\n\nThough the markets remained volatile, the worst was over and the new government basked in media and public acclaim. The consequence was that on October 6 MacDonald asked the king for the dissolution of parliament, to allow an election on October 27.\n\n\"The present National government was formed in haste to meet a swiftly approaching crisis. It has stopped borrowing, imposed economy and balanced the budget,\" the government's joint manifesto claimed. \"The government is to be comprehensively national and not sectional\".\n\nNot everyone agreed. While National Labour, Conservative and National Liberal leaders began the tricky task of ensuring they did not run against each other in seats where not long before they had been direct enemies, Labour and the few other opposition MPs began to prepare their campaign.\n\nAt first, the opposition was upbeat. Labour, under the leadership of the former cabinet minister Arthur Henderson, positioned itself as the main challenger to government candidates - 409 seats were fought in straight contests while another 67 candidates (largely in places where Labour had no chance) were returned unopposed.\n\nAnother former Labour minister, Oswald Moseley, who had been moving to the right for most of his political career, prepared to fight the campaign for his New party. Calling for radical change in Britain, the New party managed to put forward 24 candidates, but 22 of them went on to lose their deposits and their failure helped drive Moseley towards fascism.\n\nAt the other extreme of the political spectrum 26 Communist candidates stood - but none went on to win and only two polled more than 10,000 votes. James Maxton's Independent Labour party, which argued for \"the speedy replacement of the anarchy of capitalism by a socialist commonwealth\" did little better - though years later Maxton became an early hero of today's chancellor, Gordon Brown.\n\nThat failure on the far left hides a fact that Labour was not prepared to admit to itself as the campaign began. Beating the united forces of the National government was an impossible task, but for Labour in 1931 winning against any form of opposition was not on the cards.\n\nHad the National government not been formed, the Conservatives under Baldwin would have formed the next government whenever the election came. Labour may have been let down by its leaders in 1931, but the party was not removed from power because of that. The public would have removed them anyway.\n\nThat did not deter Labour from fighting to win. Attacking all spending cuts, especially in unemployment benefit, the party now opposed even the ones the former Labour cabinet had actually agreed to. Labour's manifesto, drafted by Harold Laski, was long and forceful but also - to many voters - extreme. Capitalism, it claimed, \"had broken down\".\n\nThe result was that the party was criticised by its opponents and by the media for its dangerous agenda. Of the main national papers only the Manchester Guardian backed it.\n\n\"How do the parties stand?\" asked the Sunday Dispatch, a sister paper of the Daily Mail. \"On the one side there is the National government, led by Mr Ramsay MacDonald and consisting of the best elements of the Conservative, Liberal and Labour parties. On the other side, there is the Socialist party, led by Mr Arthur Henderson and the men who ran away from the country's crisis, taking their orders from the TUC.\"\n\nThat was one of the gentler attacks on Labour and it stung because to most voters it appeared to be true. Labour's outrage was limited, too, because its few allies responded in kind. The Daily Herald called MacDonald a \"pinchback Mussolini\" on polling day. It was not a clean campaign.\n\nBut it was a novel one. For one thing it was the first general election in which broadcasting played a major role: in 1931 4,330,735 radio licences had been issued. That did not help Labour: Sir John Reith, the BBC director general, limited election broadcasts to 10. Six of those went to National candidates and only four to the opposition.\n\nThat unfair balance was exaggerated by the fact that three Liberals - one for each of the fragmented party's different factions in parliament and only one in opposition - were given a broadcast.\n\nWorse for Labour, its speakers did not perform powerfully. The strongest campaign performance was from the chancellor, Snowden: he described his former party's programme as \"Bolshevism run mad,\" a soundbite that stuck in the public mind.\n\nIn the cinemas, newsreels were reluctant to give the election much space: Movietone, which reported the most politics, was heavily pro-government. Pathe refused to report Labour at all.\n\nBut the media did not swing the result much, if at all. By ensuring that only one government candidate stood in most seats, the government ensured that it won overwhelmingly almost everywhere. Conservatives - still commonly referred to as Unionists - gained 208 extra seats and did not lose one. Labour lost 213.\n\nThe new parliament made a mockery of the split between government and opposition benches in the Commons. On the National side sat 471 Unionists, 35 National Liberals, 33 other Liberals, 13 National Labour MPs (including the prime minister) and two others.\n\nThe opposition could only muster 52 Labour MPs (one of them Clement Attlee, who took over as leader when Henderson lost his seat), four independent Liberals and five other independents.\n\nThe nominal victor was MacDonald. But the real victor was Conservatism, led by Stanley Baldwin, a businessman from Bewdley in Worcestershire who had already been prime minister once and who came to personify the quiet complacency of 1930s Britain.\n\nBaldwin replaced MacDonald in No 10 in June 1935, ahead of an election in which MacDonald, who had already lost his reputation with Labour, also lost his seat. Baldwin's Britain was a long way from Labour's hopes of 1929. It was not until 1945 that the party was able to rule again alone and united - and by then the National government and the 1931 election which crowned it was a dark memory of a disastrous time."
