        "meta_description": "The trade union-Labour Party link has been contentious with the pre-1914 socialists and the post-1994 New Labour Blairites as well as with Labour’s political opponents, the Conservative and Liberal parties. Yet, for the Labour Party the trade unions have provided support in hard times, as in the face of National Labour in the 1930s and the break-away of the Social Democrat Party (SDP) in the 1980s. In 1945-51, the support of the trade union movement to what it saw as “its” government in the massive task of reconstruction exemplified the close Labour Party–trade union relationship. But in the “winter of discontent” of early 1979 the trade unions and strikes became a major liability for the Labour Party. The relationship seems to have deteriorated since then; however, nationally and locally, the trade unions have provided both finance and activists which have been a bedrock of support for the Labour Party.",

In 1899 the Trades Union Congress (TUC, established in 1868 as an annual conference of trade unions but with an executive which could take action in line with the conference’s decisions) voted ‘to invite the co-operation of all Co-operative, Socialistic, Trade Unions and other working class organisations’ in holding a conference ‘to devise ways and means for securing the return of an increased number of Labour members to the next Parliament’.\n\n7Yet, the impact of the ILP was disproportionate in the pre-1914 Parliamentary Labour Party to its membership, which ran at around 2 per cent of the trade union affiliates to the Labour Party (see Table 1B). Although seven of the 29 MPs were ILP sponsored, many more were also ILP members as well as trade unionists. This was notably so in the case of J.R. Clynes (1869-1949), who was to be Food Controller in 1918 in David Lloyd George’s wartime coalition government. In the final vote for the first chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party Keir Hardie beat David Shackleton by one vote. The post rotated and after Hardie, 1906-8, the next two chairmen were trade unionists, Arthur Henderson, 1909-10 and George Barnes (1859-1940), 1910-11, before James Ramsay MacDonald, 1911-14. While some trade unionist MPs were also ILP members, others were anti-socialist. In the case of Arthur Henderson, when, as Secretary of the Labour Party (1912-34), he was the UK link with the Second International and it was felt to be diplomatic for him to be a member of a socialist society, it was notable that in 1912 he joined not the ILP but the very moderate Fabian Society.\n\n12The political influence of the trade unions was enhanced in the industrially turbulent pre First World War years and even more so in the war and the postwar boom of 1919-20. Table 2 provides details of the considerable rise in trade union membership 1911-20. Over half the male labour force was in trade unions in 1919 and 1920, densities not achieved again until after the Second World War in 1946, while the 1920 female density was only surpassed from 1942. Trade union membership went up in the war years even though some 5.9 million men went into the Armed Forces. Although trade union affiliation fees to the Labour Party were lowered, the sheer greater number of trade unionists resulted in the Labour Party having bigger resources for fighting postwar elections. Trade union financial strength generally was greater not only because of increased income but also as there were reductions in some costs (few being unemployed and with strikes illegal, most strikes were unofficial).\n\nTable 2 – UK Trade Union Membership 1910-21 (in thousands)\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\nTotal\n\nMembership\n\nDensity\n\nMembership\n\nDensity\n\nMembership\n\nDensity\n\n1910\n\n2287\n\n18.6\n\n278\n\n5.3\n\n2564\n\n14.6\n\n1911\n\n2804\n\n22.6\n\n335\n\n6.3\n\n3139\n\n17.7\n\n1912\n\n3026\n\n24.3\n\n390\n\n7.2\n\n3416\n\n19.1\n\n1913\n\n3702\n\n29.6\n\n433\n\n8.0\n\n4135\n\n23.1\n\n1914\n\n3708\n\n29.5\n\n437\n\n8.0\n\n4145\n\n23.0\n\n1915\n\n3868\n\n30.7\n\n491\n\n9.0\n\n4359\n\n24.1\n\n1916\n\n4018\n\n31.8\n\n626\n\n11.4\n\n4644\n\n25.6\n\n1917\n\n4621\n\n36.4\n\n878\n\n15.9\n\n5499\n\n30.2\n\n1918\n\n5324\n\n41.8\n\n1209\n\n21.7\n\n6533\n\n35.7\n\n1919\n\n6600\n\n51.6\n\n1326\n\n23.7\n\n7926\n\n43.1\n\n1920\n\n7006\n\n54.5\n\n1342\n\n23.9\n\n8348\n\n45.2\n\n1921\n\n5628\n\n43.6\n\n1005\n\n17.8\n\n6633\n\n35.8\n\n13The huge wartime demand for manpower put labour in a strong position in the labour market in Britain as in other belligerent nations. The British government came to a voluntary agreement to suspend strikes and achieve labour flexibility with some major trade unions at the Treasury conference in February 1915. These changes became statutory requirements with the Munitions of War Act, 1915. As the state took control of more and more of British industry and settled wage rates nationally, the TUC and the key trade unions were increasingly consulted by government and brought into wartime committees. Similarly, when the first wartime coalition government was formed by H.H. Asquith (1852-1928), Arthur Henderson entered the Cabinet on behalf of the Labour Party. When Asquith was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Lloyd George (1863-1945) in 1916, Henderson became a member of the small War Cabinet (and on resigning in August 1917, he was succeeded by G.N. Barnes, another prominent former trade union leader). So during the First World War the trade unions had moved from the margins of government, often making their points by presenting petitions, to being consulted at the highest levels of government. The Labour Party had emerged from being dependent on an electoral pact with the Liberal Party.\n\n14While the British trade unions had been overwhelmingly moderate before the First World War, there had been some notably socialist trade unionists, ranging from Tom Mann, Ben Tillett, Will Thorne and other leading ‘New Unionists’ to militant miners in South Wales. The pressures of the First World War, with severe restrictions on labour yet with much profiteering in industry and retailing, led to the radicalisation of many workers. In metal working centres such as Sheffield and Glasgow, as in Berlin, St Petersburg, Milan and Turin, militant left wing trade unionism emerged.\n\n15Militant engineering workers provided many of the early leaders of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), with many others coming from coalmining or the railways. Tom Mann, who was the best known trade unionist in the early period of the CPGB, wrote in a pamphlet praising Soviet Russia:\n\n14 Tom Mann, Russia In 1921, London: British Bureau, Red International of Labour Unions, n.d. [1921]), (...)\n\nLet me suppose the reader is an unemployed member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union; has exhausted state unemployed benefit, is now receiving only a few shillings a week from the union, family life rapidly deteriorating… confronted with the employers’ present demand that those in work shall be subjected to ‘another 12½ per cent reduction in wages. Are you one who still fails to see the necessity for a change of system from Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie to Dictatorship of the Proletariat?\n\n16In Britain, however, there was no major split in the trade union movement, although the CPGB had some, although limited, success with a minority movement in the trade unions and with the National Unemployed Workers’ Movement (which gained some support beyond the CPGB). The great majority of British trade unionists remained moderate, though after 1918 more were likely to vote Labour than Liberal.\n\n22From the First World War until the General Strike the Labour Party’s opponents liked to claim there was a revolutionary threat, with the trade unionists as gullible people who could be exploited by the ruthless. Earlier, the young Winston Churchill in his only novel, Savrola (1900), had mixed together upper class British fears of bomb-throwing anarchists with concern over the rise in Germany of the SPD. After the Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917 right-wing authors such as John Buchan (1875-1940), who wrote some of his novels when Director of the Department of Information 1917-8, and ‘Sapper’ (Cyril NcNeile 1888-1937) depicted sinister figures manipulating trade unionists, leading them away from ‘patriotic’ views into socialism. Conservative politicians similarly warned of dangerous forces at work behind the moderate trade union figures. Lloyd George, the Liberal Prime Minister of a coalition government, observed in 1920 that:\n\n22 Lord Riddell’s diary, 10 January 1920. Riddell Papers, British Library, Add. Ms. 62985, f. 7-8.\n\nthe great danger of a Labour government was that they would allow themselves to be rushed and would lose control… If Henderson and his friends were in authority and there was a strike, say, in Manchester, they would not be prepared to use force to preserve law and order. They would send a man down to talk to the crowd. And they would share Kerensky’s fate.\n\nTable 3 – UK Trade Union Membership and the Labour Party’s vote in general elections, 1931-9\n\nTrade Unions (thousands)\n\nMale member-ship\n\nDensity\n\n( %)\n\nFemale member-ship\n\nDensity\n\n( %)\n\nTotal membership\n\nDensity\n\n( %)\n\nLabour Party vote\n\n1931\n\n3859\n\n29.1\n\n765\n\n12.8\n\n4624\n\n24\n\n6,62,561\n\n1933\n\n3661\n\n27.4\n\n731\n\n12.0\n\n4392\n\n22.6\n\n-\n\n1935\n\n4106\n\n30.6\n\n736\n\n12.4\n\n4590\n\n23.5\n\n8,325,491\n\n1939\n\n5288\n\n38.9\n\n1010\n\n16.0\n\n6298\n\n31.6\n\n-\n\n30So what went wrong in British politics for the trade unions in the 1950s and after? The first issue was that fears of mass unemployment, as in the 1930s, were not realised. The prosperity in the international economy from about 1950 to 1973 avoided this. In Britain the avoidance of high unemployment was also facilitated by both Labour and Conservative governments following Keynesian counter-cyclical policies, trying to maintain a steady level of aggregate demand in the economy. The period 1950 to the early 1960s saw low unemployment and buoyant demand for labour. As a result the trade unions were in a strong position to press wage and other demands. In the 1950s inflation, not unemployment, became the worry of the Conservative governments of 1951-64 and the trade unions were deemed to be a major cause of rising costs in British industry. The issue of rising prices was examined in the 1956 government White Paper, The Economic Implications of Full Employment (Cmd 9725) which urged ‘self-restraint in making wage claims and fixing profit margins’.\n\n32In early 1979 a series of strikes, many in the public sector, undermined confidence in the Labour government under James Callaghan (1912-2005), 1976-79. In previous industrial unrest, notably between the Conservative government of Edward Heath (1916-2005), 1970-74, and the miners, the Labour Party had an advantage in being deemed to be able to work with the unions. The link also at first proved valuable in Harold Wilson’s 1974-76 government, when the government and the unions made ‘The Social Contract’ whereby the unions supported incomes policy (which between 1975 and 1977 played a major part in cutting inflation from 24 to 8 per cent) and in return the government delivered social benefits (such as better pensions) and tax cuts. In the ‘Winter of Discontent’ of early 1979 the trade unions and strikes were a major liability for the Labour Party. In his diary on 16 January 1979, Bernard Donoughue (1934- ), Senior Policy Advisor to James Callaghan, noted of the strikes:\n\nThis is all creating a strong public reaction – against the unions, and against us. So this crisis is the worst for us in the past five years. The Tories have never been able to really hurt us. But our strongest card has been that we have seemed able best to deal with the unions. Now that card looks very weak.\n\n33It was in this period that Margaret Thatcher dropped her caution on the issue of the trade unions and made ‘taming the unions’ a major feature of her politics. The Thatcher governments, 1979-90, were marked by a strong belief in the effectiveness of free market forces in making a strong economy, and part of this belief was a conviction that trade unions damaged the economy and resulted in worse levels of unemployment. The Labour-trade union link became a standard part of Conservative electioneering in the general elections of 1979, 1983 and 1992, with lessening favourable responses from the British electorate.\n\n34Conservative criticism of the Labour Party trade union link became less effective as the trade unions became weaker in the 1990s. UK trade union membership peaked at 13,289,000 in 1979 but by 1995 had dropped to 8,089,000. Trade union density fell from 53 per cent in 1979 to under 30 per cent by 1998. It also became less effective because public opinion which had been hostile to the trade unions in the 1980s became more positive to them when many felt the Conservatives had gone too far with hostile trade union legislation in the late 1980s and 1993 and with the closure of much of the coal industry. Furthermore, Conservative criticisms of the trade unions as a source of Labour Party funds became less damaging as the Conservative reliance on hedge funds and other finances appeared less admirable with the financial crisis of 2008."
