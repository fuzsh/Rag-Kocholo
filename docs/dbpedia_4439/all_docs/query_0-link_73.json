The correspondence covers the period June 1917 - January 1919 and includes letters to Sassoon from Colonel H Jones-Williams, OC 3rd Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers to whom Sassoon would later send his protest letter; Captain E R Kearsley of the 3rd Battalion RWF who congratulates him on \"a magnificent bombing raid with the 2nd Battalion\"; H B Lees-Smith MP who raised Sassoon's case in Parliament; the novelist H G Wells; the pacifist Max Plowman (later author of A SUBALTERN ON THE SOMME under the nom de plume \"Mark VII\"); and the Labour MP (later Chancellor of the Exchequer) Philip Snowden. The album also contains the War Office letter of 18 February 1919 informing Sassoon of the Medical Board's decision to classify him as medically unfit for further service, placing him on the retired list with the rank of Captain, together with a photocopy of his declaration dated July 1917.\n\nContent description\n\nBound volume (104pp, of which 27pp hold cuttings and with 4 loose items) containing ms/ts letters and press cuttings compiled and in places hand-annotated by Siegfried Sassoon, mainly concerning public reaction to his declaration in July 1917 against the continuance of the war, but also his support of the political candidacy of Philip Snowden for the Blackburn seat during the General Election of December 1918.

What were the consequences of the First World War? When the First World War ended, Europe did not return to peace. In fact, by some estimates, the five years following 1918 were deadlier than the 4 years of war preceding it. In this week's episode of IWM Stories, Assistant Curator Geoffrey Spender takes a closer look at three of these conflicts; The Irish war of Independence, The Russian Revolution and The Greco-Turkish War.\n\n© OP-TELIC 03-010-17-145\n\nContemporary conflict\n\nTimeline of 20th and 21st Century Wars\n\nMilitary conflict took place during every year of the 20th Century. There were only short periods of time that the world was free of war. The total number of deaths caused by war during the 20th Century has been estimated at 187 million and is probably higher. Explore the timeline of 20th and 21st century wars using IWM's extensive online collection.\n\n© IWM (Q 110864)\n\nContinuing Conflict: Europe after the First World War\n\nContinuing Conflict: Europe after the First World War\n\nThe First World War ended - but it did not mean an end to fighting in Europe.\n\nShare this"
