        "text": "draws upon a book entitled. 'Philip\n\nSnowden. An Impartial Portrait,'\n\nfor his reminiscences.\n\nFor thirty-eight years, he writes.\n\nMr. Snowden has been speaking and\n\nwriting in a bitter, argumentative\n\nstyle. But a sympathetic idealist\n\nlurks beneath the bitter words.\n\nMr. Snowden's bitterness is due to\n\nthe rebellion of a sensitive nature\n\nagainst human suffering, and of a\n\nlogical .mind against the injustices of\n\nan illogical world. s\n\nWhen 27, he was badly crippled\n\nhy a bicycle accident. Since then he\n\nSxas been compelled to drag himself\n\nabout on two sticks. Only a man\n\nendowed with exceptional courage\n\nand a profound belief in his mission\n\ncould have faced the ordeal of public\n\nlife with such a handicap.\n\nHe looks a grim figure as he\n\nbattles his way to his seat in the\n\nHouse of Commons. Nevertheless\n\nhe has none of the personal bit\n\nterness against fate often dis\n\nplayed by the deformed.\n\nAs might be expected, being a\n\nstrong character, he suffers, 'badly\n\nfrom the defects of his qualities. The\n\nidealist is often at fault. His atti\n\ntude during the war is an example.\n\nIt may have been idealistic and log\n\nical, but it -was not practical. His\n\npredictions concerning the peace are\n\nanother instance. They proved hope\n\nlessly fallacious. He remarked -* —\n\nMake no mistake about' it. It\n\nwill be a 'people's peace!' This\n\nwar is not going to be settled as\n\nother wars have been by states\n\n. men whose incompetence or crim\n\ninality made the war. This war\n\n'is not going to be settled in the\n\nsecret chambers of diplomacy ;\n\nit is going to be settled by the\n\ndemocracies of the different coun\n\naries.\n\nThene is, however, this to be said.\n\nAge and .experience have made him\n\nless theoretical, and less inclined to\n\nrely on the powers of logic and senti\n\nment.\n\n'? SIGNIFIED CHANCELLOR.\n\ni On the whole, he has pnn-ed a\n\n. dignified, competent Chancellor of\n\n; the Exchequer. I refer to his tech\n\n: nique, not to liis 'policy, about which\n\n! I make no comment one way or the\n\n' other. His -acute mind has enabled\n\n; him to master the intricate details of\n\n» National finance, and his speeches\n\n; have been lucid and workmanlike.\n\nI ,He did well for England at The\n\n! , Hague in 1929, when, for once in his\n\n; , life, all fci? fellow-countrymen spoke\n\nI well of hirii. Now he has fallen from\n\n[ grace. Ul- Und tax has called fort*1\n\n; a. chorus of operation.\n\n- it is' sa?r; tiSSt he is favoring '\n\nthe profiteers and penalising\n\ns ihetr victims, most of whom haw '\n\nno increment in land' values, and ?"
