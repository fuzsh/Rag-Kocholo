Philip Snowden, Viscount Snowden (born July 18, 1864, Ickornshaw, Yorkshire, England—died May 15, 1937, Tilford, Surrey) was a socialist politician and propagandist and chancellor of the Exchequer in the first two Labour Party governments of Great Britain (1924; 1929–31).

The son of a weaver, Snowden worked for the government as a clerk until he became crippled by a spinal disease. In about 1893, after partially recovering, he became a lecturer and writer for the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and from 1903 to 1906 he was national chairman of ILP. In the House of Commons (1906–18, 1922–31) he excelled in debates on social and economic questions. In 1921 he repudiated the ILP because of its increasing militancy.

Snowden served as chancellor of the Exchequer in Ramsay MacDonald’s first Labour ministry (Jan. 22–Nov. 4, 1924). He returned to office in 1929 in MacDonald’s second government and faced a series of difficult government budgets owing to the deepening effects of the Great Depression. In 1931 he established Sir George May’s economy committee, which, by its recommendation that benefits for depression-induced unemployment be decreased, brought about the fall of the Labour ministry that year.

Continuing as chancellor of the Exchequer in MacDonald’s coalition National Government, Snowden carried through an emergency budget in September 1931 and secured Great Britain’s abandonment of the gold standard that same month. After leaving office in October, he was created a viscount and made lord privy seal, but he left that office in 1932. His two-volume Autobiography appeared in 1934.

Snowden had no children, and the viscountcy became extinct upon his death.
