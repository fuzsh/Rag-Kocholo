        "text": "Inception\n\nFrom the moment of its earliest inception, Colorado College was intended to be a coeducational institution, \"open to both sexes and all races.\"\n\nFirst Classes\n\nColorado College held its first classes on May 6, 1874. Twenty-five students were in attendance, among them 13 men and 12 women in the first class sessions.\n\nFirst White Female Faculty Member\n\nThe first known white female faculty member at Colorado College was Minna Knapp from Germany. She assisted with the teaching of German and music. Mary S. Mackenzie was also present in the early days of the college, assisting a male professor with his teaching duties. In the style of the time, Miss Mackenzie, who subsequently married, was identified by her married name, Mrs. Cornelius S. Gambrill.\n\nAfrican American Youth Leadership Conference\n\nColorado College hosted the 22nd annual African American Youth Leadership Conference.\n\nDiversity and Equity Advisory Board\n\nThe Diversity and Equity Advisory Board was established to promote and support diversity and equity among staff and faculty.\n\nFounding of The Butler Center\n\nThe Butler Center at Colorado College seeks to inspire and create an intellectual and social culture that is inclusive and respectful towards all. Serving as the college's hub for diversity, inclusion, and intercultural exchange, The Butler Center took over the duties of the Office of Minority and International Students (OMIS), established in 1990. Named for Ellis Ulysses Butler Jr. '40, one of Colorado College's earliest African American alumni, The Butler Center honors Ellis' legacy and generous gifts to his alma mater by working towards his vision of a more inclusive and welcoming future.\n\nPaul Buckley joins CC\n\nPaul Buckley joins CC as an assistant vice president and inaugural director of The Butler Center. Arriving from Dartmouth College, where he served as assistant dean of undergraduate students, Buckley holds a Ph.D. from Syracuse University, as well as a master's and bachelor's degree from the University of Albany. Leading the efforts of The Butler Center, Buckley works towards broadening diversity and inclusivity at CC.\n\nCourageous Conversations\n\nThe Colorado College Student Government Association (CCSGA) initiated Courageous Conversations, a discussion series aiming to engage the student body in fruitful, productive conversations on highly stigmatized topics submitted by CC students. Courageous Conversations topics have included immigration, the hookup culture, political differences, gender and sexuality, and the petition to diversify the curriculum.\n\nFerguson Protests\n\nStudents participated in protests as a response to the grand jury decision that police officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted in the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nDEI Leadership Team\n\nIn June of 2020, CC announced that a team of three leaders would be joining the college to form the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Leadership Team, with one member of the team focusing on the academic program; a second on students; and a third on employees and college business relations. Peony Fhagen joined the CC community as the new senior associate dean for equity, inclusion, and faculty development, Rosalie M. Rodriguez joined CC as the senior associate dean of students for equity and inclusion/director of the Butler Center, and Barbara J. Wilson was named to serve as the interim director of diversity, equity, and inclusion for staff.\n\n$1 million for Antiracism Commitment\n\nTo enhance and accelerate the work of the new DEI leadership team CC Board of Trustees Chair Susie Burghart '77 donated $1 million to further the college's Antiracism Commitment. \"I wanted to underscore how important this initiative is to all of us - as educators, parents, students, staff, and alumni,\" Burghart says. \"These experts will guide the college in long-needed work that is now even more crucial. This is a moment when CC can lead and make a difference.\"\n\nFirst Black Woman Named as Acting Provost\n\nClaire Oberon Garcia, professor of English, is the first Black woman named as Acting Provost at Colorado College. She will simultaneously continue her role as Dean of the Faculty.\n\nActing Co-Presidents Mike Edmonds and Robert G. Moore\n\nOn July 1, 2020, following the departure of former President Jill Tiefenthaler, Mike Edmonds, dean of students and vice president for Student Life, and Robert Moore, senior vice president for Finance and Administration, became acting co-presidents of Colorado College. Edmonds started at CC in 1991, working to improve the student experience, residential life, student opportunities, campus safety, and career planning. He is the first Black leader to serve as president. Moore joined the college in 2009 and manages the college's finances, Human Resources, Facilities, dining operations, purchasing, and the bookstore's operations.\n\nCC Receives $575,000 Grant Supporting Black Education Students\n\nIn October 2020, CC received a $575,000 grant from the Sachs Foundation to support Black students interested in pursuing careers in education. The grant will be used to support summer fellowships, academic-year internships, and scholarships, including two Master of Arts in Teaching scholarships. \"Such a mission necessitates the active recruitment, development, and support of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) teachers, but especially Black teachers whose presence in the classroom yields positive social, cognitive and academic outcomes for all students, regardless of race,\" said Associate Professor and Chair of the Education Department Manya Whitaker. \"We are extremely grateful to the Sachs Foundation for removing the economic barriers that prevent many Black students from considering a career in the classroom.\"\n\nCC Joins Liberal Arts Colleges Racial Equity Leadership Alliance\n\nIn the fall, Colorado College joined the University of Southern California Race and Equity Center's newly established Liberal Arts Colleges Racial Equity Leadership Alliance. The group works together to share strategies, seek advice, and identify ways to leverage collective impact towards racial equity in higher education.\n\nFirst Woman of Color Named as CC's 14th President\n\nOn December 9, 2020, Colorado College announced its incoming 14th President, L. Song Richardson. Richardson is a legal scholar, dedicated educator, lawyer, and expert on implicit racial and gender bias, and assumed the presidency on July 1, 2021. Richardson, who is Black and Korean, is the first woman of color to hold the presidency at Colorado College. Previously, Richardson was the dean and chancellor's professor of law at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. When she was appointed to that post in January 2018, she was the only woman of color to lead a top-30 law school.\n\n\"Everything about CC resonated with me,\" says Richardson. \"The more I learned, the more intrigued I was by this community of innovative changemakers and problem-solvers. I am honored to join CC and the Colorado Springs community, and look forward to building a bright future together.\"\n\nEmily Chan and Pedro de Araujo Named New CC Deans\n\nEmily Chan, professor of Psychology, and Pedro de Araujo, associate professor of Economics, were appointed by President Richardson to new positions as dean of the faculty and dean of the college, respectively. Chan will be responsible for supporting faculty and academic staff development. De Araujo will be responsible for the further development of the student academic experience.\n\nEd Robson Arena Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony\n\nThe ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Ed Robson Arena and the Mike and Barbara Yalich Student Services Center was held on September 18, 2021. The facility is part of the Colorado Springs’ City for Champions (C4C) initiative which aims to bring more tourism to the Pikes Peak area. The Ed Robson Arena, named after major donor Ed Robson ’54, P’79, G’11, serves as the first-ever home venue for CC’s men’s hockey team. The adjoining Yalich Student Services Center, named after community leader Barbara Neely Yalich ’53 and former CC hockey team captain Milo “Mike” Yalich ’50, provides a central location for CC’s health and wellness services, bookstore, mail center, and other communal spaces.\n\nStroud Dedication\n\nIn December 2021, Colorado College named the fourth-floor club level of the Ed Robson Arena for outstanding athlete and scholar Kelley Dolphus Stroud ’31, one of CC’s first Black graduates. The dedication ceremony brought together Stroud family members from across the country and members of the broader Colorado Springs community. “I hope the ones who came before us are able to see what their example has created, even under sometimes extreme conditions,” said Kelley Dolphus Stroud’s nephew Carl Bourgeois."
