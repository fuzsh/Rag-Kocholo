        "text": "EL PASO COUNTY, Colo. (KRDO) - The owners of the Return to Nature Funeral Home in Penrose, Jon and Carie Hallford, appeared in an El Paso County courtroom with a plea deal on the table.\n\nNearly 200 decomposing bodies were found improperly stored in the Return to Nature Funeral Home in October 2023.\n\nThe Hallfords have separate defense teams but, both sides asked for more time to contemplate a plea deal that was offered.\n\nThe plea would allow Jon Hallford to plead guilty to Counts 71-261, Abuse of a Corpse, in exchange for a sentence of 20 years in the Department of Corrections. Carie Hallford would be allowed to plead guilty to the same charges in exchange for 15-20 years in the Department of Corrections.\n\nThe judge decided that September 20, 2024, would be the final arraignment date where they either have to accept the plea or set trial dates.\n\nJon Hallford remains in federal custody so he did not appear and a bench warrant was issued."
