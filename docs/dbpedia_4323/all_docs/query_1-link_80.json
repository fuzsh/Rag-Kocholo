        "text": "In 1899 Irish suffragist Dorothea Roberts gave Bedford College a portrait of Millicent Fawcett (1847-1929) by the artist Theodore Blake Wirgman (Fig. 1). 1 That year Fawcett accepted an honorary LLD from the University of St Andrews, one of the first honorary degrees awarded to a woman, and Roberts's donation thus marked an important celebratory moment for the women's higher education movement. As a gift to one of the earliest women's colleges in the country, the portrait joined a growing collection of portraits of pioneering professional women at Bedford College. The art collections at the newly established women's colleges heralded a new kind of collector: collectives of educated women, staff, students, and alumnae. These women were not necessarily wealthy individuals, but as collectives they could commission artworks through the intricate networks that threaded between the different institutions promoting higher education for women. Some context is required to understand the circumstances by which these pioneering groups of university-educated women came to commemorate their history through their art collections. The movement for university\n\nThis paper explores the place of geology within science education and the part women have played in geological higher education through history. The context is set by firstly exploring the informal role women have played in education in general and secondly examining in detail the position they held after 1870 when female higher education was put on a more formal footing. To illustrate this, the evolution of two female colleges of higher education, Bedford College, London and Newnham College, Cambridge, both offering geological education within science are evaluated within a wider educational context .Finally the cases of Dr. Catherine Raisin based at Bedford College and Dr. Gertrude Elles at Newnham College Cambridge as role models are highlighted within this wider framework. Some other key figures both students and staff are also examined and an analysis of student destinations from both institutions during the late 19th Century and early 20th Century are tabulated. The place of women firstly within science education and then specifically within geological education forms the context of this paper. The conclusions develop a portrait of early geological role-model women.\n\nThe is the ACCEPTED VERSION. The published version can be downloaded for free before 1 April 2021 at: https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1cZ1v_6JtuTBwh The relationship between women, feminism, and UK art schools is usually told from an American perspective, grounded in the 1970s American women’s art movement connected with particular programmes. The 1970s UK experience was different: distinct educational structures – maintenance grants and single honours degrees – necessitated different feminist art pedagogies and practices. The discussion is grounded first in the post-WW2 history and context of UK HE. It then explores the situation today, and the HE system of fees, loans, debt, and institutional audit, drawing upon publicly available data of where women are placed institutionally and numerically as students and educators. It then outlines where women are professionally as practicing artists quoting data of exhibition numbers, grants, and auction sales. It explores the history of feminisms in UK art schools. Finally, it proposes some feminist pedagogical strategies. The author argues the need to think feminist, and not assimilationist, to effect deep change."
