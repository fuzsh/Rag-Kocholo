        "text": "By Amara Thornton\n\nI've have been occupying myself with (among other things) a digital bundle of old letters – one of my favourite things. These letters are rather more personal than my usual though; they are from my great-grandfather to his sister and were sent during the middle of the First World War, between May 1915 and July 1916. They are almost invariably signed off \"Your Bro, Alex\", which makes me smile.\n\nMy great-grandfather Alexander Palmer Kelly was from North Carolina. As a twenty-nine year old recently graduated doctor in early summer 1915 his first job was not on land at all but at sea. He signed on to his first ship Hydaspes (a British & South American Steam Navigation Co. vessel) in June as ship's surgeon, beginning what would be at least a year of near continual travel across the Atlantic and through the Mediterranean. The salary was good, and offered him the chance to pay off various medical school debts. Equally, I think, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity – an adventure with much more than a hint of danger. The sinking of the passenger ship Lusitania, targeted by German submarines en route to Liverpool from New York with the loss of over a thousand passengers, had occurred just over a month before he departed on his first voyage.\n\nI was helped in my quest to follow his footsteps abroad by the extremely handy 1915 Merchant Navy Records project, a searchable database of digitised Merchant Navy crew lists hosted by the National Archives and the National Maritime Museum in London. Using this database I was able to find him on four different ships – Hydaspes, followed by a very brief stint on Sachem, and then two consecutive trips on Turcoman (Dominion Line). On these he sailed through North Atlantic routes, calling at ports in Canada, Ireland and England.\n\nHe joined the S. S. Parisian in late December 1915. A Leyland Line vessel, Parisian was bound for Alexandria. This would be his first time going so far east, and he was very enthusiastic about it. It would also be his first Christmas outside the United States.\n\nParisian was carrying mules (bound, I assume, for war service) and the trip east it seems was uneventful. By Boxing Day he was in Alexandria harbour, soaking up the sun and the (to him) completely new culture of Egypt. Having gone \"from the farm to the sea\" (as my grandmother later put it) he thought Egypt was worth travelling through the war zone to get to. He thoroughly enjoyed shore time in Alexandria, abandoning his plan to visit Cairo in favour of staying put. He rang in the New Year with many others at a dinner at the Majestic Hotel (the very hotel where novelist EM Forster had established himself on arriving in Alexandria only a month earlier).* The city was thronging with soldiers and sailors, Egypt being a key staging post for campaigns in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nWhile he was in \"Alex\", disaster struck. S. S. Persia, a commercial passenger ship run by the Peninsular and Oriental (P&O) line, was torpedoed in the waters between Crete and Alexandria. Hundreds of people drowned; the ship sank quickly when the boiler exploded as a result of the hit. What survivors there were floated in lifeboats on the open water for over a day before rescue. They were brought to Alexandria, where my great-grandfather saw them land. They were mainly coatless and hatless he observed (and very probably cold).\n\nHe writes almost breezily about this tragedy, but reading between the lines I think the danger of his choice of sea over land rather haunted him. The Parisian had followed exactly the same route as the Persia, less than a week earlier, so what happened to its passengers could very well have happened to him. Enemy submarines, he wrote, \"don't bother us but wait for the women and children.\"\n\nBy the beginning of February 1916 he was back in the US, but not for long. He re-joined the Parisian for another trip to the Mediterranean via Gibraltar, expecting to stop again at Alexandria. Going by my great grandfather's letters, by this point in the war the Parisian was fitted with guns for ports east of Gibraltar (moving from SS to HMS), and was at the beck and call of the Royal Navy. Before heading out he was full of anticipation for the journey, writing \"This is a very fine trip and the submarines and sea raiders only add a little excitement to the thing.\" Planning ahead for his sojourn in Egypt, he anticipated buying \"curios\" (as many troops stationed in Egypt did) to bring back as presents.\n\nBut Egypt was not to be on this voyage. Parisian instead headed for Salonika (Thessaloniki) in Greece, another key port in the war's Mediterranean theatre. When he arrived, the Salonika campaign was ongoing. He wrote, \"I am in my glory now getting around where something is going on.\" Unfortunately I have no idea what he got up to at Salonika, but an article on his exploits published in a local newspaper on his return suggests that he spent some time walking around the city. (By the time he was in Salonika, a temporary museum for antiquities found during war trenching had been set up in the White Tower on the harbour, but it wasn't open to the public so it's highly unlikely that he saw it.)\n\nA short time back in the US and he was back at sea on board Parisian once more. The few letters I have from this period are very sketchy in detail. It seems clear the ship was on active service in mid-late May through July 1916, and my great-grandfather was wary of the censor. The last letter in my bundle is from July 1916, written en route back to the US. Frustratingly, in his last sentence he mentions going to Cairo and Algiers. He saw the Pyramids at Giza just outside of Cairo, which he observed were \"perfectly grand\".\n\nI don't know whether this was his last trip on the Parisian – I suspect not as he seems to have found a ship with a route he liked. At any rate, sometime after the United States entered the war in 1917 he joined the US Army Medical Corps and began a thirty-year career as an army medical man. It's been fascinating to dive into what remains of his correspondence from his first years as a qualified doctor during wartime. I only wish there were more.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nShapland, A.

At the time, I didn't know much about her, but the event programme noted that she provided a number of replica instruments used at the Hippodrome that afternoon from her own collection.\n\nSchlesinger is known in musical theory circles for her work on recreating ancient music, using instruments and tools that she had specially made based on ancient source materials. Nine years after the Hippodrome performance, she published a book, The Greek Aulos, describing her findings.\n\nFor decades Schlesinger also held a pioneering research fellowship at the University of Liverpool's Institute of Archaeology. This department was the earliest British-based training institution for archaeologists – being founded decades before the Institute of Archaeology at the University of London (now part of UCL). It instituted a Fellowship in the Archaeology of Music in 1914.\n\nKathleen Schlesinger was the first Fellow – in fact, Kate Bowen's investigation of the Institute of Archaeology's Annual Reports reveals that the Fellowship was designed for her, and her scholarship promoted by John Garstang, then Professor of the Methods and Practice of Archaeology at the Institute. The Fellowship enabled her to continue her research on the ancient history of musical instruments, in which she was already well-established.\n\nBy this stage, Schlesinger was also an experienced lecturer, working as an Extension lecturer for the University of London. She is to be added to the ranks of women I've written about in Archaeologists in Print who organised and delivered lectures and courses at the British Museum, incorporating collections on display into their curricula. Schlesinger also created and delivered a set of lectures on the history of musical instruments in the galleries of the Victoria and Albert Museum. In addition, she was featured as a lecturer at the 1914 Children's Welfare Exhibition at Kensington Olympia, discussing musical instruments to accompany a special display at the event.\n\nWhile she is now known for her work on ancient Greek music and instruments, she had a wide-ranging field of investigation, and her museum lectures sought to appeal to audiences interested in Biblical history (and by extension the archaeology of the Levant, Egypt/Sudan and Mesopotamia) as well. For these lectures she created models of instruments.\n\nKate Bowen's detailed research on Schlesinger and her musical collaborator Elsie Hamilton also highlights Schlesinger's role in innovative performances combining music and archaeology before her contributions to Julia Chatterton's 1930 Hippodrome programme. These include, intriguingly, the music for a drama called \"Sensa\" (the result of a collaboration between two other women, Maud Hoffman and Mabel Collins) which was set in ancient Egypt, and performed in theatres in London in 1914 and 1919.*\n\nIn the 1930s, an American musician came to visit an elderly Kathleen Schlesinger in her home in Highgate. He was Harry Partch, and his memory of tea with Schlesinger makes for fascinating reading. She told him about using a British Museum vase as model for her replica kithara, which was made to her specifications by a handy gas-meter man during the First World War out of wood from a crate that had once contained oranges.\n\nToday, researchers continue to work on replicating ancient music. Armand D'Angour's article published in The Conversation this summer promised that the mystery of ancient Greek music had now been solved. There is also a large-scale European Music Archaeology Project and there are YouTube videos of Stefan Hagel's performances on a replica kithara.\n\nBut it's important to remember this sort of research has a long history – and to ensure that the early pioneering music archaeology, performance and lectures of Kathleen Schlesinger are not forgotten.\n\nReferences/Further Reading\n\nBowen, K. 2012.

Collins was very interested in the occult, and spotting the Needle triggered visions of ancient Egyptian priests. Her interpretation of their presence - and through this the inspiration for Idyll and \"Sensa\" - drew on British Museum Curator Wallis Budge's book Egyptian Magic. For more on Collins, Hoffman, and the creation and performances of \"Sensa\", see Catherine Hindson's chapter referenced above.\n\nBy Amara Thornton\n\nLike many other people I suspect, I’ve been watching American Gods. I’m not familiar with the Neil Gaiman book on which the series is based, but I’m intrigued by the plot's mixture of different cultures’ mythologies.\n\nI grew up reading D’Aulaires Book of Greek Myths (first published in 1961), so much so that the family paperback copy literally fell to pieces. Last year I bought a new copy - flicking through the pages was like visiting old friends.\n\nHaving now spent years researching the history of archaeology, I’m familiar with some but by no means all of the ancient Egyptian pantheon. But my current focus on popular archaeology publishing has revealed a few books that were published in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to make the British reading public more familiar with ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses and the stories associated with them.\n\nOne of the early 20th century authors I’ve come across is James Baikie. This Scottish vicar wrote fairly regularly for the publishers Adam & Charles Black on various topics both archaeological and scientific (he was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society). His Wonder Tales of the Ancient World is a retelling in English of ancient Egyptian stories and legends recorded in papyri. It appeared in time for the Christmas in December 1915, priced at six shillings, and was marketed as the ideal gift for children.\n\nBaikie's aim in writing Wonder Tales was to animate Egypt for his readers. Otherwise, he declared, Egypt would be “mainly interesting for old stones and old bones.” His first chapter set out the source of the stories for readers; he explained the system of writing in hieroglyphic and hieratic, and the use of papyrus reed rolls, which thousands of years after they were created were recovered by archaeologists and looters.\n\nHe drew on the works of archaeologists for the text, referencing among others Flinders Petrie’s popular Egyptian Tales books, which Methuen had published in chronological volumes in the 1890s. Egyptian Tales featured illustrations by the artist Tristram Ellis, who had spent time in Egypt gathering material to inform his work.\n\nWonder Tales is divided into three parts: Tales of the Wizards, Tales of Travel and Adventure and Legends of the Gods. Each part begins with a short explanation giving a bit of context to the stories that follow. The introductory text to the Legends of the Gods section offers an explanation for the complexity of the ancient Egyptian pantheon. Following that are five legends, featuring a host of gods and goddesses: Ra, Nut, Hathor, Thoth, Isis, Horus, Khonsu. Some of the stories are linked back to archaeologists – after “How Isis Stole the Great Name of Ra”, for example, Baikie includes an anecdote from Flinders Petrie’s Sinai expedition.\n\nThere are twelve coloured illustrations in Wonder Tales – the work of Baikie’s wife Constance N. Baikie (nee Turner Smith). They are rather splendid - I wish there were more of them. I’d love to find out more about Constance Baikie as an artist but she is proving to be fairly elusive in the historical record (so far). However, as she provided the illustrations for many of James Baikie’s books she had quite a prolific output.\n\nIt would be great to see these Egyptian gods and goddesses more often in popular culture today.* Perhaps a revamp of Baikie’s Wonder Tales would be in order. Any takers?\n\nReferences/Further Reading\n\nBaikie, J. 1914. Wonder Tales of the Ancient World. London: A. & C. Black.\n\nPetrie, W. M. F. Egyptian Tales Translated from the Papyri. First Series.

The 2016 film Gods of Egypt, although introducing some of the ancient Egyptian pantheon, was justifiably criticised on many points.\n\nBy Amara Thornton\n\n​\n\nInspired by some childhood favourites I received for Christmas, lately I’ve been looking into non-fiction archaeology books aimed at younger readers. I grew up reading the Usborne Time Traveller series which includes titles such as Pyramids and Pharaohs and Rome and Romans. A well-thumbed copy of Knights and Castles was loo-side reading for years. The series is still available, and was revised and reissued in the 1990s.\n\nThe archaeologist and author Mary Chubb is known (in archaeological circles at least) for her memoirs Nefertiti Lived Here and City in the Sand, recounting her experiences on archaeological excavations. But between 1966 and 1973 she also published a series for children, the Alphabet books. In each book she explains facets of archaeology and ancient history through a single word or concept, in alphabetical order. As she put it\n\n​…an Alphabet makes a good, strong base to build on.”\n\n​She based the books in part on ancient sites where she’d worked. It comes as no surprise therefore that the first book was An Alphabet of Ancient Egypt, reflecting Chubb’s initial experience in archaeology as the secretary/accountant for the Egypt Exploration Society’s excavations at Tell el-Amarna in the early 1930s, the subject of Nefertiti Lived Here. And what better way to begin than with A for Archaeologists,\n\n...people who spend their lives finding out how men lived long ago.\"\n\nIn C for Cartouches Chubb explains how to read hieroglyphics. Opposite Chubb's text, Watts reproduces in large, visually accessible scale the cartouches of Pharaohs Akhenaten and Tutankhamun. Both were associated with Tell el-Amarna.\n\nMy personal favourite in An Alphabet of Ancient Egypt is X for X-Ray, in which Chubb describes the use of modern technology for understanding ancient lives. Watts's image of a radiographer x-raying a mummy accompanies the text. Its haunting caption:\n\nKnowledge from Shadows\"\n\nChubb's Alphabets for Assyria and Babylonia, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and the Holy Land followed. The Alphabet for Ancient Britain was advertised, but as far as I know never appeared. Her publisher, Geoffrey Bles, who produced all of her books, ironically was located on Doughty Street in London, just around the corner from the EES’s current offices today.\n\nMary Chubb died just over a decade ago in 2003. While Libri reissued Nefertiti and City as paperbacks in the 1990s, the Alphabets have never been republished. A shame, but perhaps potentially an opportunity for some enterprising publisher? Let’s hope so, the books are brilliant.*\n\nReferences/Further Reading\n\nAllen, T. with Henry V. 1990. The Time Traveller Book of Pharaohs and Pyramids.
