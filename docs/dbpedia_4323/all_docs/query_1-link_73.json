        "text": "Crispin Guest is a disgraced knight and former member of landed society, who must reinvent himself as “The Tracker” among the mean, gritty streets of London. An investigator who can find “anything or anyone,” he uses his wit and wiles to navigate danger and treachery lurking in every corner of the city and court. Self-styled as Medieval noir, this series mixes elements of hard boiled detective stories with Medieval life and history creating an entertaining and enthralling hybrid perfect for mystery and history lovers.\n\nStarting in 1270 along the contentious borders with Wales, young, inexperienced Prioress Eleanor has taken control of the small priory of Tyndale. A part of the Order of Fontrevraud, Prioress Eleanor rules over both monks and nuns and holds a place of respect within the neighboring communities and must contend with all grievances from the petty to the murderous. The arrival of the handsome and troubled Brother Thomas adds lust to her personal demons. I love an ecclesicastical mystery solver especially in Medieval times. See also the Brother Cadfael series and the Hawkenlye Abbey series.

When the man later turns up dead the wife is the prime suspect. Atlas reminds me of my beloved Julian Kestrel series. A man of honor, intellectually curious, impeccable style and a wide circle of friends who keeps running into murder victims which is very inconvienent for him. Atlas’s clear voice and pov make this one of my favorites newer series.\n\nRosalind Thorne is no stranger to scandal.

With quiet zeal and an intellectual observation bordering on the obsessive, he rarely misses anything or fails to get his man. A long running series, the author has also started a prequel series that explores Lenox’s beginning as a man in his twenties. The author always manages to include unexpected twists and turns in the mysteries and in the personal lives of his characters.\n\nKat Hollaway may be an excellent cook that any Mayfair London household would want to hire but she also happens to be cool in a crisis and very observant.

With an impeccable sense of justice and an arsenal of delicious recipes, Ashley writes entertaining mysteries with plenty of upstairs/ downstairs drama.

This series is rich in NYC history and society. In particular, the author focuses on how the Civil War and a new influx of immigrants changed and shaped the city. The slow build relationship between the two main characters also make this a standout.\n\nFiercely independent, determined and young, Emma Cross is both a Vanderbilt cousin and a born and raised Newporter.

Her plans to be a secretary for hire go awry when her first client turns up dead. Harriet is no nonsense and hard to spook which makes her great in a crisis. Chapters are also told by a British detective also new to Singapore. The mystery takes on the sins of colonialism and includes historical details. With only one entry so far, this series already has me eagerly anticipating the next volume!\n\nWorld War 1 is raging and young Chief Inspector Beech has discovered that there are crimes that even he is ill equipped to investigate—namely those against women in both the upper and lower classes. His idea is to recruit the highly educated high-born women in his life and some professional policemen to form a clandestine crime solving unit and their phone number is Mayfair 100. Book one explores the seedy underbelly of London life from drug use to prostitution and sex traffiking. With two volumes, the series is a highly entertaining and complex entry in the historical mystery genre.\n\nLouise Faulks arrives in 1912 New York with a secret-packed past and looking for a fresh start. Moving in bohemian circles with her actress roommate and her author aunt, her own ambitions come into focus when she comes across a murder and discovers a talent for criminal investigation.

She soon learns that not all is what it seems but luckily for Verity neither is she. Her war work was much more complicated and secretive than she can ever explain. Her spy skills and smarts are soon in need again in England and on the continent. Huber, who also writes the Lady Darby series set in 1830s Scotland, knows how to pace her novels so that they are unputdownable.\n\nIn 1923 Cambridge England, the newest member of the local police force is the young bachelor Inspector John Redfyre. A godsend to the Cambridge CID and the area’s husband hunters, he’s immediately put to work when after a Christmas concert a female musician has fallen from the balcony or was she pushed? With his intellectual style, broodiness, way with the ladies and little patience with the University denizens, Redfyre is reminiscent of indelible Inspector Morse, Cleverly is a skilled writer most known for the Inspector Joe Sandilands series set in 1920s India.\n\nPerveen Mistry is the only lawyer in 1920s India. Oxford educated, Perveen can go where no male lawyers or even the British government can go— behind the screens into the isolated realms of women living in purdah. However, while Perveen does solve murders and other crimes, she’s less an amateur detective and more a fixer of problems in Colonial India. The series is reminiscent of the Maisie Dobbs series which is often more about psychology and the law than your standard murder mystery. Great historical details and complex characters make this a fascinating new series.\n\nInspired by 1930s screwball comedies, Lady Georgianna Rannoch may be 34th in line to the throne of England but she has no money of her own. Cut off from her meager allowance by her Duke brother, she goes in search of a job—turns out her unflappable demeanor makes her a natural for crime solving. At times hilarious, Lady Geogianna’s adventures are always fun and reminiscent of P. G. Wodehouse. One of my all time favorite authors, Bowen also has the Molly Murphy series set in late 19th century NYC and centered around an intrepid Irish immigrant as well as other one off mysteries.\n\nMaggie Hope is an American in London when WW2 breaks out and finds herself with a job in Churchill’s office and the rest, as they say, is history. From secretary to spy to helping Scotland Yard, there’s not a mystery that Maggie’s analytical brain and American chutzpah can’t solve. The varied locations, adventures and interactions with real life people of the era make this a standout series. Be warned: they go by quick and you’ll be hungering for more—luckily there are plenty to keep you busy!\n\nIts 1942 and Poppy is the air raid warden for Little Buffenden, her tiny village outside London. Life changes drastically for the locals with the arrival of an American air base right outside of town and with it hundreds of American servicemen. Cultures clash and young, local women, seen on the arms of the newcomers, soon start turning up dead. This is a brand new series with only one volume but includes many of my favorite things and is well worth keeping up with. Arlen is also the author of the Edwardian era-set Lady Montfort series which is perfect for Downton Abbey fans.\n\nBilly Boyle is a young Irish American cop in Boston itching to be part of the action in Europe where he hopes to do his part to stop the Nazis. Wanting to keep him far from combat, his family helps get him assigned to ‘Uncle” Ike Eisenhower’s staff who ends up using him as an investigator for his deduction skills and discretion. Far from keeping him safe, each investigative assignment becomes successively more dangerous. Billy interacts with real life people and is often involved in historical operations and events. Thrilling and gripping this is a series that is hard to put down.\n\nInspector Troy starts off as police sergeant in 1940s London’s Metropolitan police force much to the disappointment of his upper class family who had higher hopes for his ambitions. But he slowly makes his way up to Chief Inspector. The series jumps around from 1940 thru the 1960s. It starts with a serial killer terrorizing London in 1944 in Black Out and then in book 2 goes to the 1950s. Reminiscent of the characters of Le Carre and Deighton, Troy is unfailingly thoughtful and thorough and always pushing against his family’s expectations and connections. Lawton also writes the Joe Wilderness series about an miscreant orphan and soldier recruited by MI6 in the aftermath of the war."
