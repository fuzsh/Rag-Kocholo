        "text": "I’m happy to share that I’ve been promoted to Rights Associate at Scholastic! I can’t thank the Scholastic team enough, especially my wonderful boss, Jennifer Powell, who has been such an advocate for me as well as a stellar mentor. Looking forward to continue working in Rights while expanding into new markets to make Scholastic’s books more accessible to all!\n\nHad a fantastic time at the 2023 Bologna Book Fair. It was a dream to represent Scholastic and meet my own overseas colleagues as well as other international publishers in person to talk all things children’s books! Thanks especially to Scholastic US’s foreign rights team for being such superb mentors and role models—I feel so lucky to be working as one of you!\n\nJust completed the Columbia Publishing Course at the University of Oxford! I loved learning about the book publishing industry alongside other students, lecturers, mentors, and seasoned experts. From meeting and learning from publishing professionals, to taking a title through every step of the publishing process, to living amongst fellow book nerds on the beautiful campus of Exeter, I can't wait to start my career in this industry.\n\nMy not-so-inner book nerd is very excited to intern at Ayesha Pande Literary this summer as an Agent Intern for Serene Hakim! Though I will be working remotely, APL is a Harlem, NYC-based literary agency with an impressive list of bestselling books they've helped usher out into the world. I am beyond proud to intern with a diverse, women-owned agency dedicated to uplifting underrepresented voices from genre fiction to graphic novels to non-fiction, and from children's to YA to adult audiences.\n\n\"The Power Within Her: Guide to Journaling\" is now available for preorder! \"Empowering Ambitious Women to Become the Ever-Changing Best Version of Themselves!\" I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to work for my fabulous former professor, Meghan Hurley Powell, PhD, as editor of her upcoming book. It was such a joy to see and contribute to this book's development over many months from its first drafts to the final, hard-earned product. To all the badass gals out there, this book is for you. Dr. Meghan Hurley Powell truly knows what's up when it comes to personal growth, self-love, empowerment for all women, and how to live your best life-- all through the transformative practice of journaling. Additionally, part of the proceeds funnel directly into a scholarship fund for high school senior women to apply to college. Meghan Hurley Powell, PhD, thank you for this opportunity to be your editor, and I can't wait for the world to hear your voice!\n\nMy first two weeks at MANICA Architecture as Marketing and Presentations Writer and Designer have been absolutely wonderful. I love the people, the company, the location, and the fascinating architecture industry. I'm so thankful that I get to be a part of this truly incredible team, and I'm especially grateful to Heather Wiley for recommending me for this job that I'm already learning so much and having a blast at. #MANICAarchitecture\n\nI have officially graduated Summa Cum Laude from Graceland University as both an Honors and Gold Medal (4.0 GPA every semester) student with a major in English and minors in Spanish and Creative Writing! I cannot fully express my gratitude to my brilliant professors, to my supportive and loving family, and to all the wonderful friends I have made during my time at Graceland. #GracelandGrad\n\nThrilled to have been accepted into the Columbia Publishing Course at Oxford University in the UK in September! Many thanks to Alicia Glekas Everett for her guidance toward the Columbia / Oxford program, to Todd Benson for the connection to Alicia, and to Brett Simpson (my dad) for the connection to Todd. I'm incredibly excited to go through this program!"
