        "text": "ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nOpen Access Report Shares Perspectives from Physics Researchers\n\nThe American Physical Society (APS), along with AIP Publishing, IOP Publishing (IOPP), and Optica Publishing Group (formerly OSA), surveyed over 3,000 physical science researchers between December 2021 and January 2022 in an effort to understand their perspective on Open Access (OA) publishing. Their responses have been compiled into a report, which will help APS and other publishers better meet the publishing needs of the research community.\n\nRead More\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\nAntonio Politi Retires from Physical Review E\n\nAfter almost 25 years Antonio Politi has stepped down as Associate Editor for Physical Review E. Antonio has handled papers in the section on Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos since it was created in 1998. We are very grateful for Antonio’s contributions as an editor and for his many years of dedication to the journal. We will miss his presence at our meetings, his expert advice, his thoughtfulness and deep insights.\n\nRead More\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\nPRX Energy Appoints Inaugural Lead Editor: David Scanlon\n\nThe American Physical Society (APS) is delighted to announce the appointment of David Scanlon, Professor of Computational Materials Design, University College London, United Kingdom, to the role of Lead Editor of PRX Energy, APS’s new, highly selective, open access journal covering energy science and technology. Professor Scanlon will serve as the inaugural Lead Editor of the journal, which will open for submissions December 7, 2021 and offer an introductory promotion in which all article publication charges (APCs) will be paid by APS through the end of 2022.\n\nRead More\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\n2021 Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nAPS congratulates the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics recipients Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann “for the physical modelling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming” and the other half to Giorgio Parisi “for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales.”\n\nRead more in APS News\n\nProfessor Parisi has authored several papers with Physical Review journals. A selection of relevant papers from Physical Review Letters and Reviews in Modern Physics have been made free-to-read.\n\nPatrick Charbonneau, Eric I.

The Lead Editor will provide intellectual leadership and vision for editorial standards and policies, direct the journal, and lead its editorial board and staff of editors. Physical Review Fluids (PRFluids) is dedicated to publishing innovative research that will significantly advance the fundamental understanding of fluid dynamics. PRFluids is strongly supported by APS’s Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD), and closely interacts with the DFD Executive Committee to expand its scope into emerging research areas of fluid dynamics.\n\nRead More\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\n2021 Irwin Oppenheim Award\n\nAPS congratulates Sumantra Sarkar and Jeremy England as the recipients of the 2021 Irwin Oppenheim award for best paper by early career scientists published in Physical Review E. Their article was selected for developing a theory of the emergence of self-replication in simple chemical models, and the definition of general design principles for constructing self-replicating objects.\n\nDesign of conditions for self-replication\n\nSumantra Sarkar and Jeremy L.

This information had always been available to those subscribing to the Physical Review journals, but now the citation data will be open to all.\n\nRead More\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\nAPS Congratulates the 2014 Nobel Prize Winners\n\nThe American Physical Society congratulates the 2014 Nobel Prize Winners in Physics and Chemistry.\n\nPhysics\n\nThe physics laureates Isamu Akasaki (Meijo University and Nagoya University), Hiroshi Amano (Nagoya University), and Shuji Nakamura (University of California, Santa Barbara) have been recognized for their work that led to the invention of the blue light-emitting diode, a fundamental stepping stone towards the realization of new environmentally friendly and energy efficient light sources.\n\nChemistry\n\nThe chemistry laureates Eric Bertzig (Howard Hughes Medical Institute), Stefan W. Hell (Max Planck Institute and German Cancer Research Center), and William E. Moerner (Stanford Univerisity) have been recognized for their work in improving the resolution of optical microscopy, in particular the development of a super-resolved fluorescence microscope.\n\n“It’s a great year for optics,” said Pierre Meystre (University of Arizona Regents’ Professor of Physics and Optical Sciences, Physical Review Letters Lead Editor), “with blue LEDs winning the Physics Nobel yesterday and fluorescence microscopy winning the Chemistry prize today. It shows that wonderful things are happening in optics from saving enormous amounts of energy with efficient lighting to helping with life-saving medical advances that rely on super-resolution imaging. They are completely different technologies, but both light-based, and next year is the International Year of Light, so the timing couldn’t be better.”\n\nMany remarkable papers from these scientists contributed to this development. These include Moerner’s seminal 1989 work on optical detection and spectroscopy of single molecules in a solid, which was published in Physical Review Letters. This paper is now freely available on our website.\n\nRead More from APS:\n\nPhysics APS News Update\n\nChemistry APS News Update\n\nAPS Press Release for Chemistry Prize\n\nW. E. Moerner and L.
