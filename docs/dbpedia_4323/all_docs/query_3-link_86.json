        "text": "RESULTS\n\nRodent cranial exoskeleton design and construction\n\nThe cranial exoskeleton consisted of a 3-armed parallel robot, called a delta robot, to generate translational motion in the x, y, and z axes, and a motorized goniometer mounted to the moving platform of the delta robot to generate rotational motion in the pitch, roll, and yaw axes (Supplementary Info. 1a–c). The distal end of the goniometer was coupled to the top of the headstage, and a slipring was placed around this coupling to provide electrical access to equipment on the headstage (Supplementary Info. 1d). Mice were docked to the bottom of the headstage using a kinematic clamping mechanism that attached to a chronically implanted titanium headpost (Supplementary Info. 1e). The mice controlled their velocity and acceleration by applying forces through this clamping mechanism. These forces were measured using a 6-axis, milli-Newton scale force sensor embedded within the headstage close to the mouse, and then passed onto a force feedback controller that used an admittance control law to compute the desired velocity and acceleration. We sought to design the exoskeleton to be capable of moving at up to 0.2 m/s velocity and 1 m/s2 acceleration in the linear axes, and 180 deg/s velocity and 540 deg/s2 acceleration in the rotational axes based on previous studies characterizing unrestrained mouse behavior using markerless tracking9 and head-borne inertial measurement units17,22. We set the desired range of motion to 80 × 80 cm in x and y to encompass an open field behavioral arena, with infinite rotation in yaw (Supplementary Info. 4a–c).\n\nThe primary consideration when designing the exoskeleton is that the linkage dimensions and motor torques must be capable of maneuvering the headstage at physiologically realistic velocities and accelerations across the full span of the behavioral arena. To evaluate this, we performed in silico simulations on kinematic and dynamic models of the exoskeleton. First, the kinematic model was used to perform a parameter sweep of the linkage dimensions to establish which combinations of dimensions could achieve the desired range of motion (Supplementary Info. 4d). Next, these combinations of dimensions were evaluated using the dynamic model to compute the motor torques and velocities that were required to achieve the desired pivot point (or mouse) velocities and accelerations (Supplementary Info. 4e–f). The optimal set of linkage dimensions were selected to produce low motor torque and velocity (Supplementary Info. 4g). Lastly, to return to ground truth, a time series of velocity and acceleration data obtained from marker-less tracking of freely behaving mice in an open field arena9 were input into the dynamic model using the optimal linkage dimensions. The resultant joint torques were parsed into gravitational, velocity, and acceleration components (Supplementary Info. 4h) and then these components were used to evaluate the linkage stiffness, mass, and material selection.\n\nThe admittance control law implemented in the force feedback controller instructs the exoskeleton to emulate user-programmable mass and damping values (the virtual admittance) that are orders of magnitude lower than its true values (the robot admittance). Because sensor sampling, computations, and feedback loops in the controller all introduce time delays, and motors have a finite torque limit, the accuracy of this emulation (the apparent admittance) degrades at higher frequencies, resulting in the mouse experiencing larger mass and damping values. To evaluate the limitations of the admittance control approach, we used a Laplace-space model of the exoskeleton and controller to identify the bandwidth of the system23 (Supplementary Info. 5). The bandwidth provides a measure of how quickly the exoskeleton can respond to force inputs from the mice before the apparent admittance degrades significantly. The bandwidth of the exoskeleton was estimated to be approximately 4 Hz, which was expected to produce a robot-rodent interface that was perceptible to mice but that would not hinder their volitional movement in navigation tasks.\n\nRodent behavior-in-the-loop controller tuning to achieve natural locomotion\n\nTo achieve natural locomotion when mice are maneuvering the exoskeleton, we first evaluated the velocity and acceleration profiles of freely behaving mice (n = 3) in an open field arena from our previous study9. For short periods of motion, profiles generally followed arching trajectories with acceleration peaking around 50 to 75% of the peak velocity attained for the period of motion, before crossing the velocity axis and decelerating in a similar arching trajectory back to the origin (mouse stationary) ( , Supplementary Video 1). For sustained periods of motion, the trajectory arched towards a peak velocity and then followed smaller circular trajectories centered on the mean velocity. Ideally, the velocity and acceleration profiles of mice maneuvering the exoskeleton needed to match those observed in freely behaving mice, and these profiles needed to be achieved with mice exerting minimal forces. We tuned the admittance controller by starting with large mass (m) and damping (c) values to ensure stability and then incrementally decreased the m and c values until the velocity and acceleration profiles of mice maneuvering the exoskeleton were comparable to those observed in freely behaving mice ( – ). For all experiments, the pitch angle (20 degrees) and snout height (6 to 8 mm) for the exoskeleton were configured within the range of physiologically realistic values for mice at walking velocities, which we determined using marker-less tracking24 of freely behaving mice (n = 4) ( ).\n\nWe tuned the mouse’s forwards direction (positive x axis) with a test cohort of mice (n = 4) maneuvering the exoskeleton around a linear oval track ( ). In total, 14 combinations of m and c values were evaluated across 20 sessions. Large m and c values resulted in large amplitude, positive spiking forces, and discontinuous periods of motion at velocities and accelerations significantly less than those observed in freely behaving mice ( – right). Decreasing the m and c values resulted in decreasing forces, increasing peak velocities and accelerations, and increasing periods of sustained motion. However, with the m and c values too low, motion became discontinuous again and the force became predominantly negative, indicating the exoskeleton was moving faster than the mouse intended ( – , left). With optimally tuned m and c values, low amplitude, positive and negative forces were observed, and sustained periods of motion were achieved with velocities and accelerations comparable to those observed in freely behaving mice ( – , middle, Supplementary Video 1). After training mice on the exoskeleton with optimally tuned m and c values, the mean peak forces decreased from 0.19 ± 0.06 N to 0.16 ± 0.03 N ( top). The range of velocities and accelerations became closer to those of freely behaving mice ( – ), with the top 20% of velocity peaks of 13 ± 2 cm/s and 13 ± 1 cm/s (p = 0.07) and top 20% of acceleration peaks of 35 ± 10 cm/s2 and 30 ± 5 cm/s2 (p = 0.8) for freely behaving mice and trained mice maneuvering the exoskeleton, respectively (1-way ANOVA, p-values for full range of velocity and accelerations in ).\n\nWith the controller tuned, we evaluated gait dynamics to establish whether natural locomotion was being conserved in mice maneuvering the exoskeleton. An infrared camera captured the side-view of mice (n = 3) as they locomoted along a 27 cm long straight section in the linear oval track in both conditions (Supplementary Video 2). Representative still images of the same mouse locomoting when freely behaving and when maneuvering the exoskeleton, overlaid with traces indicating the left forepaw (red) and hind paw (orange) location history are shown in . For all mice, the step length and cadence for both paws generally increased with their forwards velocity, in line with other studies25 ( ). No significant difference in step length was observed between freely behaving mice and mice maneuvering the exoskeleton, with mean forepaw and hind paw step lengths of 4.6 ± 1.1 and 4.7 ± 1.1 cm in freely behaving mice, and of 4.5 ± 1.3 and 4.7 ± 1.2 cm in mice maneuvering the exoskeleton ( ; 1-way ANOVA; forepaw: p = 0.28; hind paw: p = 0.63). However, the cadence did vary significantly, with mean forepaw and hind paw cadence of 3.9 ± 1.5 and 4.1 ± 1.5 Hz in freely behaving mice, and of 3.1 ± 1.0 and 3.0 ± 0.8 Hz in mice maneuvering the exoskeleton ( ; 1-way ANOVA; forepaw: p = 2×10−7; hind paw: p = 1×10−10). We suspect that the observed difference in cadence is partially caused by an upper velocity limit of 16 cm/s that was implemented on the exoskeleton controller, and partially caused by the bandwidth of the exoskeleton, the mass and damping values of the admittance controller, and the constant pitch and snout height.\n\nMice maneuvering the exoskeleton make turns and navigate 2D arenas\n\nHaving established that mice could locomote naturally in their forwards direction while maneuvering the exoskeleton, we next provided mice with control of their lateral (y axis) and turning (yaw axis) directions so that they could make turns. In an 8-maze arena, mice had control of their x, y, and yaw axes in a central zone and had motion in the two goal arms confined to their x axis along a circular trajectory ( – , ). We first used this arena to tune the y and yaw axes using the same methodology as the x axis, with a total of 7 combinations of m and c values in the y axis and 6 combinations in the yaw axis evaluated across 15 sessions in a test cohort of mice (n = 2) ( ). Once the y and yaw axes were tuned, we took a new cohort of mice (n = 5) with no experience on the exoskeleton and evaluated their turning proficiency across several training sessions in the 8-maze arena. We mapped the paths the mice took through the turning zone in the global x-y axes and the global y-yaw axes and then categorized the turn as an incorrect trial if the global x-y path deviated by more than 1 cm from the midline in the contralateral direction to the turn ( ). Using this scoring method, all mice achieved greater than 80% turning proficiency within 8 sessions, with 2 mice achieving the same proficiency after 3 sessions ( ). The corresponding tortuosity of the tracked paths within the turn zone in global x-y and global y-yaw paths both showed a decreasing trend across sessions as mice took more direct paths between the entry and exit points of the turning zone ( ). The magnitude of the difference between left and right turning forces increased across sessions ( , ). These trends in the tortuosity and forces suggest that once mice were familiar with the robot-rodent interface they could consistently and proficiently perform turning while maneuvering the exoskeleton.\n\nMice maneuvering the exoskeleton can perform a navigational decision-making task\n\nWe next asked whether mice that can turn proficiently in the 8-maze arena could also make navigational turning decisions. In these experiments, the door at the exit of the turning zone (training door) was removed so that mice were free to select either goal arm, and visual and auditory cues were introduced that were unique to the correct turn decision (left turn cues: light on left side of the turning zone and 1 long auditory tone 5 kHz, 4 s duration; right turn cue: light on the right side of the turning zone and 4 short auditory tones 5 kHz, 0.75 s ON / 0.25 s OFF) ( , Supplementary Info. 7). A cohort of mice (n = 8) were first trained while freely behaving to alternate between left and right turns, receiving a reward for each correct decision and an air puff for each wrong decision. Once trained, mice consistently achieved a mean success rate of 88 to 95% (1st session excluded), with 4 mice achieving 100% success rate in at least 1 session for a combined total of 10 of the 50 sessions ( ). These mice were then docked to the exoskeleton in the 8-maze arena, where they performed the same navigational task with a mean success rate of 85 to 95% (1st session excluded), and with all 8 mice achieving 100% success rate in at least 1 session for a combined total of 37 of the 60 sessions, ( , , Supplementary Video 3). There was no statistically significant difference in task performance between the exoskeleton maneuvering and freely behaving scenarios (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.16, 1st session excluded from both groups) ( , ), however the variability in performance was larger in mice maneuvering the exoskeleton than in freely behaving mice (Clopper-Pearson binomial: ±2% freely behaving, ±10% maneuvering exoskeleton). These results demonstrate that mice readily learn to navigate 2D physical spaces while maneuvering the exoskeleton and can perform learned cognitive tasks, such as sensory cue-guided decision-making, at the same performance level as when they are freely behaving.\n\nUltra-widefield cellular resolution imaging of the cortex during 2D navigation\n\nIn the first of two headstage designs that leverage the payload carrying capabilities of the exoskeleton, we incorporated a simple, custom built macroscope for widefield imaging ( ). The macroscope used a 1x zoom macro-lens coupled to a 5-megapixel, monochrome camera to image an 8.6 × 6.6 mm field of view at a design resolution of 3.45 × 3.45 μm (pixel size) (Supplementary Info. 2). In bench-top imaging of resolution test-targets, line widths in the range of 3.5 to 5.5 μm could be resolved across the field of view ( ). Double transgenic mice26 (Cux2-Cre-ERT227 X Ai16328, n = 4 mice) sparsely expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6f in layers II-III excitatory neurons were implanted with a planar glass window making 35 mm2 area of the dorsal cortex optically accessible for imaging ( , ). High resolution mesoscale imaging data was acquired in each session that mice navigated the 8-maze arena. The mesoscale imaging headstage allowed us to reliably record Ca2+ activities of 1000s of neurons from several regions distributed across the cortex ( , – , Supplementary Video 4). Example calcium fluorescence (ΔF/F) traces from 40 neurons recorded from 4 disparate brain regions in one mouse (mouse 1, session 9) completing 16 trials in the 8-maze arena while maneuvering the exoskeleton are shown in . After applying exclusion criteria on the region of interest (ROI) morphology and signal amplitude (see Methods), we identified 2383 cells that could be simultaneously recorded in this mouse.\n\nTo evaluate spatial encoding of the 8-maze arena, we performed a linear regression analysis on the inferred spiking activity and the mouse’s location within the arena. This generated a kernel matrix of Beta weights relating each cell’s firing rate to the location. Sorting the normalized Beta weights of each cell by the onset location of their maximum produced a clear diagonal trend indicating many of the cells preferentially fired at certain locations, as well as vertical bands in some locations indicating increased global activity ( , ). Examples of this preferential spatial firing are shown in for 3 cells in the retrosplenial cortex, where cell 1 fired at a tactile feature (Lego™ floor) in the left arm of the 8-maze ( top), cell 2 fired in both left and right arms over the same tactile feature ( middle), and cell 3 fired before and after left hand turns through the turning zone ( bottom). Selecting the cells with maximum Beta weights through the turning zone revealed distinct populations of neurons distributed across the whole cortex that preferentially fired as the mouse made left and right turns through the turning zone ( ).\n\nIn total, we recorded 5,765 cells distributed across the cortices of 4 mice ( – , ). Cell somas were on average 11 ± 2 pixels in diameter (38 ± 7 μm) and had an aspect ratio of 1.1 ± 0.1 ( ). Importantly, moving the imaging hardware along with mice did not cause significant motion artifacts. Lateral motion artifacts could be corrected for using the standard rigid body motion correction algorithm applied within the cell sorting package Suite2p29 with maxima of 18 pixels (62 μm) and 15 pixels (52 μm) motion correction applied in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions respectively. Variability in expression patterns were observed across mice, with increased sparsity in expression corresponding to much brighter GCaMP expression in individual cells ( – ). In two mice, 2383 and 2515 cells were identified with smaller average peak ΔF/F of 45 ± 18% and 60 ± 29% respectively, whereas in the other two mice 386 to 481 cells were identified with larger average peak ΔF/F of 112 ± 72% and 108 ± 68%, with cells across all 4 mice identified using the same thresholds29 (see Methods). This variation in expression patterns is likely due to differential expression of GCaMP6f unlocked via tamoxifen treatment. These experiments reveal the information-rich, large-scale neural activity datasets that can be reliably and uniquely acquired with the cranial exoskeleton as mice explore physical spaces.\n\nMulti-day, multi-site brain wide electrophysiology recordings during navigational decision-making task\n\nWe engineered a second headstage for the exoskeleton to perform multi-site electrophysiology ( ). The headstage incorporated stacks of 3-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) micro-manipulators for simultaneously aligning and inserting up to 4 neural probes, and a miniature behavioral camera with infrared-vision to acquire video of the mouse’s head and forepaws (Supplementary Info. 3). Mice (n = 4) were implanted with 3D printed, polymer, cranial implants, modified from our previous work8,9, which contained 6 probe-entry ports providing physical access for neural probes to the brain ( , Supplementary Info. 8). These mice were trained on the navigational decision-making task (sensory-cue guided alternating-choice) in the 8-maze arena until they reached a proficiency of >85% for at least 2 consecutive sessions ( ) before acquiring electrophysiology recordings in the task. Immediately prior to recordings, mice were docked to the exoskeleton in a staging area where they could run on a disk-treadmill as probes were aligned and inserted into the brain (Supplementary Video 5). Following probe insertion, mice began the task by entering the 8-maze arena along a linear trajectory into the start of the turning zone ( ).\n\nA total of 18 recordings were acquired across 10 recording sessions in the 4 mice performing the decision-making task, with example data and analysis from 3 sessions in 1 mouse (mouse 1) shown in – . Any motion artifacts that occurred, either due to relative motion of the kinematic clamp with respect to the fixed probes in the headstage or relative motion of the brain with respect to the cranial implant, were corrected using the standard motion correction algorithm applied within the spike sorting package Kilosort 2.030. Bandpass filtering and common-mode subtraction reduced the 3 standard deviation noise on the raw voltage traces to an average of 10 ± 5 μV ( ) indicating that any environmental noise introduced by the robotic elements of the exoskeleton can be removed using standard noise reduction techniques. Spiking signals were clearly visible in raw traces after noise reduction ( ), and manual curation of the spiking signal waveforms31 identified multiple well-isolated cells on each probe ( – , – ). The number of cells identified on each probe varied from 5 to 25 due to the depth of probe insertion and the electrode spacing (50 or 100 μm). Regular-, fast-, triphasic-, compound-, and positive-spiking waveforms were all present across the recordings, with amplitudes ranging from around 50 and 400 μV ( – ).\n\nIn addition to the decision-making, turning, and reward port-licking behaviors that were expected in the navigational decision-making task, mice also exhibited natural behaviors during recording sessions such as grooming their snout and gripping the tactile features on the Lego™ floor ( – , , Supplementary Video 5). A linear regression analysis, similar to that performed on the single-cell imaging data ( ), was performed on the 2 mice with full sets of recordings (6 probes across 3 sessions each) to evaluate spatial encoding of the 8-maze arena in the cell spike rates ( , – ). The resulting kernel matrices were normalized for each cell and were arranged in order of descending cortical depth for each recording site (top row of the kernel closest to cortical surface). Preferential spiking was observed in the kernel ( ) and in cell firing patterns ( ) for mouse 1 over the tactile floor features on both arms (cell 1, M1/SS), during right hand turns through the turning zone (cells 2 and 5, M1 and V1), at the start of the left and right goal arms (cell 3, Barrel), and after the reward port in the right arm (cells 4 and 6, RSp). We recorded from a total of 261 cells during the decision-making task, with the number of spike signals in each cell ranging from 150 to 60,000 spikes (average of 11,900 spikes) recorded across sessions lasting between 5 and 33 minutes (16 ± 9 minutes) ( ). Importantly, we saw no correlation between the signal noise amplitude and either increasing mouse velocity or increasing mouse force, indicating that moving the recording hardware along with mice did not cause significant motion artifacts ( ). These experiments demonstrate that highly sensitive electrophysiology recordings can be reliably acquired across multiple recording sessions using the cranial exoskeleton as mice perform behavioral tasks.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn summary, we report here a cranial exoskeleton that allows mice to navigate 2D physical environments while large payloads (1 to 1.5 kg) of equipment acquire brain-wide neural recordings. To accomplish this, we realized a robotic exoskeleton and robot-rodent control interface that supports stable control by a mouse 1000 times smaller in mass than the robot and payload. We validated our design by showing that mice maneuvering the exoskeleton locomote at physiologically realistic velocities and accelerations in their x, y, and yaw axes, conserve natural gait along straight trajectories, and perform a navigational decision-making task with high proficiency. We also realized two neural recording headstages capable of performing brain-wide recordings as mice navigate physical spaces; one headstage for wide-field, cellular resolution imaging of 1000s of neurons distributed across the cortex, and a second headstage for multi-site, multi-day electrophysiology using silicon probes. The hardware and techniques implemented on our wide-field imaging and multi-site electrophysiology headstages are already used in modern neuroscience11,32 but until now have been limited to studies in head-fixed subjects, often incorporating virtual reality to investigate navigational elements of behavior. The exoskeleton allows many of these head-fixed studies to be expanded to physical environments.\n\nPhysical environments produce a more natural, multi-sensory experience for mice by incorporating motion-vestibular input coupling, natural eye-head movement coupling, whisking of physical boundaries, and natural spatial representations of sensory information (for example varying sound, light, and odor intensities with proximity to source, or shadowing effects of objects). Consequently, the neural representations in actual physical environments should be more natural and multi-sensory, providing avenues for new exploration into how brain-wide neural activity mediates ethologically relevant and complex behaviors. Importantly, the ability of the exoskeleton to control aspects of the experiment design provides researchers with the capabilities to control elements of the mouse’s experience which can otherwise be difficult in freely behaving experiment designs. This retention of precise experimental control should provide researchers with the tools to unravel the neural representations of higher cognitive functions such as multi-sensory integration, decision-making, and 2D or 3D navigation.\n\nIn the current study, mice were restricted to either 1 (x) or 3 (x, y, yaw) DOF of control in the behavioral tasks as we built an understanding of robot-rodent interaction dynamics. Moreover, the mass and damping values that the mouse experienced in these axes were not imperceptible due to the relatively low bandwidth (4 Hz) of the robot-rodent interface. While these limitations did not affect decision-making performance in the navigational task that we studied, they were expected to have altered some behaviors, such as gait during turning, and possibly even suppressed other behaviors altogether, such as darting and rapid head turning17,33,34 which would require a faster response from the exoskeleton controller. Increasing the exoskeleton to full 6 DOF control and increasing the bandwidth to achieve a more imperceptible interface are expected to permit more natural representations of some of the behaviors that we observed, such as grooming and turning, as well as a broader range of behaviors overall.\n\nThe admittance controllers we used in this study were linear, which provided a predictable robot-rodent interface for mice to familiarize with. Non-linear control approaches, customization of control parameters for each mouse, and gradually varying the control parameters as mice are trained, are all avenues for exploration that may improve the overall robot-rodent interface. Sophisticated control laws such as model-predictive control have been successfully implemented on robotic exoskeletons for humans35,36 and may prove beneficial in rodent exoskeletons provided suitable models of mouse behavioral kinematics and dynamics can be defined. Within any control model, including linear admittance control, the location of the virtual pivot point about which the headstage is manipulated may not be constant across behaviors. Moreover, while the forces are measured through the chronically implanted headpost, they are often generated through the mouse’s legs and body and so interpretation of the mouse’s intentions will also be influenced by the mouse’s stance, body orientation, and pose. Therefore, realizing a more complete range of natural behaviors on mice maneuvering an exoskeleton may require monitoring of several body points in addition to the cranial forces, an approach known as sensor-fusion.\n\nThe electrophysiology headstage weighed 1 kg and the imaging headstage weighed 1.5 kg: both far below the 3kg design load carrying capability of the exoskeleton. An array of high-speed, multiple perspective, behavioral cameras mounted to the headstage, and suitably positioned infrared mirrors, would provide comprehensive tracking of body-wide behavioral metrics. Future headstage designs for simultaneously inserting up to 12 or more CMOS recording probes can be incorporated that will allow simultaneous recordings from 10s of 1000s of neurons at a time. Similarly, other modalities, such as multi-photon mesoscale imaging systems5,6,37, combined electrophysiology and optogenetics38, and patterned stimulation39, that would be impossible to implement in a miniaturized configuration40 can be implemented on an exoskeleton to allow for comprehensive mapping or modulation of brain-wide neural activity."
