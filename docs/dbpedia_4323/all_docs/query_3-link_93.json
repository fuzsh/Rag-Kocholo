        "text": "So, is there a good resource for statistical mechanics for the mathematically-minded?\n\nIf you are looking for a book, the real answer is \"not really\". As a mathematician masquerading as a physicist (more often than not of a statistical-physical flavor) I have looked long, hard, and often for such a thing. The books cited above are some of the best for what you want (I own or have read at least parts of many of them), but I would not say that any are really good for your purposes.\n\nMany bemoan the lack of The Great Statistical Physics text (and many cite Landau and Lifshitz, or Feynman, or a few other standard references while wishing there was something better), and when it comes to mathematical versions people naturally look to Ruelle. But I would agree that the Minlos book (which I own) is better for an introduction than Ruelle (which I have looked at, but never wanted to buy).\n\nOther useful books not mentioned above are Thompson's Mathematical Statistical Mechanics, Yeomans' Statistical Mechanics of Phase Transitions and Goldenfeld's Lectures On Phase Transitions And The Renormalization Group. None of them are really special, though if I had to recommend one book to you it would be one of these or maybe Minlos.\n\nYou might do better in relative terms with quantum statistical mechanics, where some operator algebraists have made some respectable stabs at mathematical treatments that still convey physics. But really that stuff is at a pretty high level (and deriving the KMS condition from the Gibbs postulate in the Heisenberg picture can be done in a few lines) so the benefit is probably marginal at best.\n\nIf the goal is to really learn statistical physics, I suspect Steve Huntsman's answer is probably correct.\n\nIt sounds like your goal is primarily to get a quick overview of how mathematicians use statistical physics, with lots of intuition, and lots of applications to nearby areas, but not necessarily much physics or any 'best possible' results. If that is the case, the Montanari/Mezard book `Information, Physics and Computation' is excellent. The emphasis is on teaching many different techniques, rather than on the statistical physics itself, and it is really written as a textbook rather than a reference book (i.e. the theorems are the easiest ones to understand, not the most powerful ones to use). In other words, it has exactly the mathematical underpinnings, but doesn't cover what many of the other books treat as central material.\n\nWell, how everyone said, there is not yet a didactic book for the entire subject but, there exists some texts and books about topics of the theory such that you can read rapidly than Ruelle.\n\nSome examples:(all are rigorous)\n\nThe classical: Gibbs Measures and Phase Transitions. De Gruyter Studies in Mathematics Vol. 9. Berlin: de Gruyter 1988. by H.-O. Georgii\n\nEntropy, Large Deviations and Statistical Mechanics. Springer-Verlag. by Richard S. Ellis.\n\nThe statistical mechanics of lattice gases, volume 1 by Barry Simon\n\nAnd, there are many surveys and currently appears new reviews about some topics, some examples(I included pages of mathematicians that work on the subject, in their pages you can get some introductory texts):\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1171\n\nThis topic is old, but I'll still add my 2Â¢. I usually don't really like statistical mechanics books aimed at physicists, as they are often much more focused on computational techniques than on concepts. There are however very good lecture notes by Yoshi Oono, available on his page:\n\nhttp://web.me.com/oono/Y_OONO_official_site/tutorial.html\n\nThe relevant file is SecondSMR.pdf . Notice that this is a password-protected pdf file, unfortunately. The password is given on the page, though.\n\nThis book is aimed at physicists, but contains a very unusual amount of mathematical content, esp. in footnotes, with many references to the math. phys. literature. This book assumes that the reader already has some knowledge of this field. There are other lecture notes, aimed at undergraduates, on his page as well (I haven't looked closely at those, so I cannot comment on their quality):\n\nhttp://web.me.com/oono/Y_OONO_official_site/tutorial_(undergrad).html\n\nYvan\n\nMaybe I didn't read the replies well enough, but apparently no one mentions A. Khinchin's book Mathematical Foundations of Statistical Mechanics. I just started reading this book. It's definitely mathematical and specifically says that it's written for a mathematician. The notation is a bit old, but the book is very readable, and far, far better than any book of physics I've seen lately.\n\nIt's only an introduction, so it doesn't contain the work done in recent decades, but a good one I would say. If there is anything really wrong with it, I would attribute it to the translator."
