        "text": "Somerville College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. Founded in 1879 as Somerville Hall, it was one of the first women's colleges in Oxford. Today, around 50% of students are male. The first male students were admitted to the college in 1994.[3] The college is located at the southern end of Woodstock Road, with Little Clarendon Street to the south and Walton Street to the west.\n\nAs of 2006, Somerville had an estimated financial endowment of £44.5 million.[4]\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn June 1878, the Association for the Higher Education of Women was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were Dr. G. G. Bradley, Master of University College, T. H. Green, a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of Balliol College, and Edward Stuart Talbot, Warden of Keble College. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall.\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\" This second committee included Dr. John Percival, Dr. G. W. Kitchin, A. H. D. Ackland, T. H. Green, Mary Ward, William Sidgwick, Henry Nettleship, and A. G. Vernon Harcourt. This new effort resulted in the founding of Somerville Hall, named for the then recently deceased Scottish Mathematician Mary Somerville. The hall was renamed Somerville College in 1894.\n\nDuring World War I the college was converted into a military hospital as Somerville Section of the 3rd Southern General Hospital. For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to Oriel College. Notable patients who stayed in Somerville include Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon, who opens Siegfried's Progress with a reference to the college.\n\nSomerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994[3] with an intake 50% male/female, a gender balance maintained to this day.\n\nStudent life[]\n\nIn 2011 student satisfaction was rated in some categories as the highest in the university>[5]\n\nFor the academic year 2011/12, the college came 27th out of 30 in the Norrington Table.[6]\n\nSomerville is well known for is regarded as being one of the more liberal colleges in the university. Despite its most famous alumna, Margaret Thatcher, being a Conservative, it is regarded as a left-wing college and has a socially diverse intake.\n\nCentral to the college is its large quad, which most accommodation blocks back on to; it is often filled with students in summer. It is also one of the only Oxbridge colleges, where students (as opposed to just fellows) can walk on the grass.\n\nThe college choir has released two CDs on the Stone Records label, \"Requiem Aeternam\" (2012)[7] and \"Advent Calendar\" (2013).[8]\n\nPrincipals of the college[]\n\nMadelaine Shaw-Lefèvre (Principal of Somerville Hall 1879–1889)\n\nAgnes Catherine Maitland (Principal of Somerville Hall 1889–1894, Principal of Somerville College 1894–1906)\n\nDame Emily Penrose (1906–1926) — classical scholar\n\nMargery Fry (1927–1930) — social reformer\n\nHelen Darbishire (1930–1945) — literary scholar\n\nDame Janet Vaughan (1945–1967) — haematologist and radiobiologist\n\nBarbara Craig (1967–1980)\n\nDaphne Park, Baroness Park of Monmouth (1980–1989)\n\nCatherine Pestell (1989–1991, as Catherine Hughes 1991–1996[9])\n\nDame Fiona Caldicott (1996–2010)\n\nAlice Prochaska (2010–)\n\nNotable alumni[]\n\nSomerville alumnae have achieved an impressive number of “firsts” - the most distinguishable being that of the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher.
