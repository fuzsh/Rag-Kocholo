        "text": "The Board of Women Visitors was created in 1875 when the Board of Managers for the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania appointed a Board of Lady Visitors to tend to the needs of the patients and assist with the various housekeeping chores. As the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania grew, so did the tasks undertaken by the Board of Women Visitors to include fund raising, social services, and operation of the Hospital shop. The Board of Women Visitor Records document the activities of the organization to provide services and funding to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania opened in 1875, the Dispensary for Nervous Diseases was one of seven dispensaries at the Hospital. The Dispensary Notebooks for Neurological Disorders consists of three sets of volumes arranged into three series; Dispensary Notebooks which contain the daily log of neurological cases treated; Case Study Notebooks which contain information based on patient treatment grouped by specific diagnosis; and William G. Spiller Reprints which include two compilations of papers authored by William G. Spiller and a publication of papers by physicians associated with the William Pepper Laboratory.\n\nThe Medico-Chirurgical College had its origins in 1848 as the Medico-Chirurgical Society which obtained a corporate charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania similar to that of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. The charter was amended in 1867 to transform the society into a medical college authorized to confer degrees. It would not be until 1881 that Dr. George P. Oliver, who had been a member of the old society and held title to the new charter, organized a faculty to hold classes. Space for the new school was secured in the second floor of a bank on the south west corner of Broad and Market Streets. About 1886 Medico-Chirurgical College absorbed the Philadelphia Dental College and the Philadelphia School of Anatomy and moved to new accommodations on the north side of Cherry Street between 17th and 18th Streets. In 1891 the College opened a hospital in the same location. In 1916 Medico-Chirurgical College merged with the University of Pennsylvania to form a new Graduate School of Medicine. The College’s buildings were demolished in 1918 to make way for the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The Medico-Chirurgical College and Hospital of Philadelphia records document the administrative activities of the facility from the late nineteenth century into the twentieth century.\n\nVital Signs, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Publication\n\nUPL 1010.918\n\n1976 – 1982, 1985, 1986\n\nHospital Annual Report.

University Trustees, a newly-formed Women’s Auxiliary of the Red Cross, and other benefactors donated more than thirty-six thousand dollars to train and equip the Base staff. The University granted the use of Weightman Hall, the White House, and Franklin Field for training purposes. In late November the War Department called Base Hospital No. 20 into active service in the Medical Corps of the United States Army. Arriving at Chatel Guyon, Puy de Dome, France on May 7, 1918, for the next eight months Base Hospital No. 20 operated out of hotels in this health resort, eventually reaching a capacity of 2,500 beds in thirty-three buildings. The Records contain information to the Hospitals activities in France and upon its return to the United States.\n\nIn 1940 the United States Surgeon-General called upon the University of Pennsylvania to organize an overseas military hospital along the lines of the successful civilian Base Hospital No. 20 organized by the University in France during World War I. As a result, a Penn medical faculty committee organized the 20th General Hospital, a World War II medical facility which would operate in the Assam jungle region of northeast India. In 1940 the United States Surgeon-General called upon the University of Pennsylvania to organize an overseas military hospital along the lines of the successful civilian Base Hospital No. 20 organized by the University in France during World War I. As a result, a Penn medical faculty committee organized the 20th General Hospital, a World War II medical facility which would operate in the Assam jungle region of northeast India. After training at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, the unit left for India in early 1943, arriving on March 21 at Ledo, where a huge military installation was being created. These records focus on the activities and medical research of the 20th General Hospital from the time of its deployment to Camp Claiborne in May of 1942 until the unit’s disbandment at the end of World War II.\n\nPublications\n\nUniversity Medical Magazine\n\nUPL 1010.91\n\n1888 – 1900\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Medical Bulletin\n\nUPL 1010.91\n\n1901 – 1904, 1908-1911, 1952 – 1957\n\nMedical Affairs\n\nUPL 1010.915\n\n1959 – 1975\n\nHealth Affairs\n\nUPL 1010.915\n\n1973 – 1985\n\nNews of the Graduate School of Medicine\n\nUPL 1010.92\n\n1950 – 1957\n\nReport on the Graduate School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania\n\nUPI 491.41\n\n1956-1963\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Medicine.

In 1950, the Philadelphia School for Occupational Therapy merged with the University Hospital’s Division of Physical Therapy to create the School of Auxiliary Medical Services at the University of Pennsylvania. It was renamed the School of Allied Medical Professions (SAMP) in 1960. SAMP graduated its last class in May 1981, and the school was closed on June 30, 1981. The collection consists of the General Records, Minutes, and Student Transcripts.\n\nAlthough the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania started a nurse training program as early as 1886, the University did not begin its nursing degree program on a collegiate basis until 1935 when, at the request of the Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania State Nurses Association, the Board of Trustees of the University authorized the establishment of a Department of Nursing Education in the School of Education. The records of the School of Nursing reflect the history of the school, its functions and programs, as well as its relationship with the University and other organizations. The collection consists of, among other things, annual reports, committee records, and committee records.\n\nOne of the oldest of its kind in North America, the School of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania is the only veterinary school in the United States that was a direct outgrowth of the University’s School of Medicine. It was founded in 1882 when University Trustee Joshua Bertram Lippincott donated $10,000 for the purpose of establishing veterinary school within the University. The Historical Material series records the school in its formative stage. It features minute books for the Board of Managers, 1889-1954, for the faculty, 1909-1963, and for alumni societies, 1901-1960. The Administration series constitutes the bulk of the collection. Included in it are a biographical data file of faculty members and prominent alumni.\n\nHerman Beerman received his B.A. in 1923, his M.D. in 1927, and his Sc.D. in 1935 all from the University of Pennsylvania. He served an internship at the Mt. Sinai Hospital and his residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Beerman continued his career at the University of Pennsylvania in the School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Medicine in the Departments of Dermatology. The papers of Herman Beerman consist of correspondence, 1923, 1965-1978; copies of his curriculum vitae; information on the dinner held in his honor by the History of Dermatology Society in 1981; clippings; photographic prints; and other miscellaneous papers.\n\nDavid Lion Drabkin began his career at the University of Pennsylvania as Instructor of Physiological Chemistry and of Biochemistry in the School of Medicine, 1926. He served as Assistant Professor, 1930-1942; Associate Professor, 1942-1946; Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, 1946-1968; and as Professor Emeritus at the School of Dental Medicine, 1968-1981. These papers include lecture notes while teaching for the Graduate School of Medicine, 1946-1968 and for the Walter Reed Medical Center, 1950. Also included are his research notes; correspondence with students, publishers, and friends; design plans for equipment; typescript drafts of manuscripts; and miscellaneous personal reference material. In addition, instrumentation manuals, operating instructions, and product literature may also be found among his papers.\n\nDr. William Benson Harer dedicated a lifetime to the practice and teaching of medicine in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, most of which was done while he served on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania. He was educated at the University of Pennsylvania where he received an undergraduate degree (1919) and a medical degree (1921). Dr. Harer served both his internship (1921-1923) and residency (1924-1927) at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). Dr. Harer was on the School of Medicine faculty as an instructor 1927-41 and later as Associate Professor (1941-1955) and Professor (1955-1963) of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology. He was honored as an Emeritus Professor of Medicine in 1965. The William Benson Harer Papers document his career as a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania, his involvement with the Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania, and his time as a student at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nFrom 1884 to 1888 William Osler was a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. While at Penn, he continued his clinical investigations, spending many hours in the postmortem rooms performing autopsies. He maintained his earlier emphasis on superior patient care, conducting famous ward walks in Old Blockley, a unit of Philadelphia Hospital. This collection consists primarily of published works by William Osler, many inscribed with the name “Alexander Randall” inside the front cover. The other item is a published memoir, by Arthur Ames Bliss, of his experience as a resident physician at Blockely Hospital (later Philadelphia General Hospital) in 1883 and 1884.\n\nGeorge Arthur Piersol earned his MD at the University of Pennsylvania in 1877. He served on the faculty of the Medical School from 1877 – 1884 and from 1890 – 1921. He was professor of anatomy, histology and embryology; his most notable contributions relate to the histology, pathology and development of the sense organs; author of two standard medical textbooks Histology (1st ed., 1893) and Human Anatomy (1st ed., 1907). The contents of the collection include the original drawings and photographs of drawings from Piersol’s portfolio used as illustrations for his published texts along with identifying manuscript notes; a calendar of lectures for his anatomy courses (1893-1903); medical lecture cards for his father, Jeremiah Morris Piersol, at Homeopathic Medical College (1855-1856) and for himself at U. of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine (1874-1877); copies of anatomy examinations (1908-[1917]); letters of introduction to European colleagues for Piersol from Joseph Leidy and Sir William Osler (1877); notes on medical works read by Piersol; his manuscript translation of Brain and Spinal Cord: a Manual for the Study of the Morphology and Fibre-tracts of the Central Nervous System by Emil Villigier prepared for publication (1912); a Copy of An Illustrated Synopsis of Normal Histology: Adapted to the Course of Practical Instruction in the University of Pennsylvania by Piersol (1885).\n\nI. S. Ravdin graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in 1918, and would spend the next fifty plus years of his career associated with Penn. During that period he rose to the posts of the John Rhea Barton Professor of Surgery, Director of the Harrison Department of Surgical Research, and Chief of Surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He also made significant contributions to medical research, particularly in cancer studies. During World War II Ravdin was Commander of the 20th General Hospital. The Papers of I. S. Ravdin reflect the entire range of his personal and professional interest, including his work as a surgeon, hospital administrator, military career, and private practice.\n\nJonathan Rhoads began his long career at the University of Pennsylvania with an internship at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in 1932. Upon the completion of the internship, he decided to continue at the University in a residency under I. S. Ravdin, the chief of surgery. In 1944 he was appointed an Assistant Professor of Surgical Research and, in 1945, as an Assistant Professor of Surgery. It was not long before Rhoads’ extraordinary skill and knowledge propelled him to upper levels of the Medical School and Hospital. He was appointed a full professor of surgery and the J. William White Professor of Surgical Research in 1949. His rise did not stop at the Medical School, but continued into the University proper when he was appointed Provost of the University in 1956, a position he held until 1959. Upon stepping down from the provostship, Rhoads returned to the Medical School and Hospital as the chair of the Department of Surgery and the John Rhea Barton Professor of Surgery. He held these posts until he retired from his administrative positions in 1972. This massive collection documents the life and work of Jonathan Evans Rhoads in multiple dimensions and through all major periods of his long career. The Jonathan E. Rhoads Papers have been organized in seven series: I. Personal (1802-2001), II. Professional (1880-2002), III. Civic Organizations (1884-2001), IV. Awards, Gifts, Etc. (1971-1998), V. Photographs, Audio-Visual Tapes, Books And Memorabilia (1969-2002), VI. Architectural Drawings (1968-1973), and VII. Theresa Rhoads Papers (1932-1987). Series I and II have been further organized into sub-series. The material within each series is arranged alphabetically.\n\nAlfred Newton Richards arrived at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in 1910 to be chair of Pharmacology, a position which he occupied until 1946, when he became Professor Emeritus. The University series consists of Richards’ class lectures, notes regarding his courses, and laboratory experiment work. The laboratory experiments include those carried out by colleagues and students and those carried out solely by Richards or in conjunction with colleagues and students. Kidney function is the general subject of most of the experiments, but many specific aspects of this subject are examined. Additional material related to Richards can be found in UPA 4, 1930 – 1950.\n\nBetween 1801 and 1803 Benjamin Woolsey Dwight studied medicine first at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia – where he also practiced at Pennsylvania Hospital, and next at Columbia College in New York. Francis E. Dwight was the grandson of Benjamin Woolsey Dwight. In 1882 he took medical instructions at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in New York, New York. The Benjamin Woolsey Dwight and Francis E. Dwight Papers contain material relate to their medical education – mainly notebooks for lectures attended, and admission cards for Benjamin Woolsey Dwight.\n\nIn the fall of 1913 John Hess Foster entered the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania and received his M.D. degree in 1917. The majority of the scrapbook is devoted to Foster’s time at the University of Pennsylvania as a medical student and details not only the various social activities, such as the fraternity, student association, and athletic events, that he attended but also his medical work at the University Settlement House of the Christian Association and the Southeastern Dispensary for Women. There is a collection of individual snapshots with autographs of faculty (primarily posed in the class room or laboratory) and fellow students at the School of Medicine. Many of these snapshots were used as illustrations in the 1917 medical school yearbook, The Scope, for which Foster was the photograph editor.\n\nFrank David Levy was the second oldest of five children of an immigrant family that came from Poland in the 1890s. He attended the College of the University of Pennsylvania for two years before entering the Medical School. At Penn he was a member of the Flexner Medical Society and the Phi Delta Upsilon social fraternity. After earning his M.D. in 1917, he had his internship at the Philadelphia General Hospital for one year from 1917 to 1918. These four items relate to Frank David Levy’s years as a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania and as an intern at Philadelphia General Hospital.\n\nDr. Cooper’s most notable contributions in the medical field include the discovery of the role of cytochrome P-450, which is a series of enzymes found in the body, and the introduction of mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration. The collection reflects his interest. It consists of Dr. Cooper’s professional papers from 1950 to the 1990s. There are six bound volumes of published papers from 1950 to 1985 and three unbound volumes of papers including letters, manuscripts and photographs from 1978 to 1990s. In addition to his personal papers, the collection consists of several books from his personal library.\n\nThe Federated Medical Resources was founded in 1966 as a non-profit corporate group by five universities and colleges in the Philadelphia area–the Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital, the Thomas Jefferson University, Temple University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania. The mission of the corporation was to provide its members with laboratory animals for use in their research and training programs. The collection documents the administration of the Federated Medical Resources throughout the twenty-three years of its existence. It consists of administrative files, financial records and animal health records.\n\nLong joined the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1932 as a professor of pathology and director of the Henry Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment, and Prevention of Tuberculosis. He devoted his life to the study of tuberculosis, after having contracted it as a young man, and became known as one of the foremost leaders in the control of the disease. During World War II he served in the Army as chief consultant on the disease. The papers largely consist of scrapbooks, certificates, and medals awarded during the war and after in recognition for his fight against tuberculosis.\n\nBenjamin F. Miller graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1928 and from Harvard Medical School, M.D., in 1933. After interning at the Cornell Medical Center and the New York Hospital, he started a three-year National Research Council Fellowship in Medicine at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in 1934. In 1937 he was appointed Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago and held that position until 1947. From 1947 to 1950, he was concurrently Research Associate in Medicine at the National Research Council and Clinical Professor of Medicine at the George Washington Medical School, and from 1950 to 1954, Senior Associate Physician at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Lecturer on Medicine at the Harvard Medical School (1952-1954). Miller spent the next ten years, 1954-1963, at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, serving as Director of the May Institute for Medical Research as well as Associate Professor of Experimental Medicine. He was appointed Associate Professor of Surgical Research at the University of Pennsylvania in 1963 and stayed in that position until his death in 1971. For many years Miller focused his research on two subjects, cardiovascular diseases and the transplantation of the kidney. The Correspondence and General Files document all major activities, academic or social, research or publishing, in which Benjamin F. Miller was engaged in various periods of his fruitful career.\n\nRichard Bunker Singer entered the University of Pennsylvania, where over the next eight and one half years he earned three degrees: the A.B. in 1934, an A.M. in Physics in 1935, and the M.D. in 1939. He followed his graduation from Medical School by serving a two-year rotating internship at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1941 the National Research Council awarded Singer one of its prestigious fellowships. He used it to conduct research at Harvard University in acid-base balance in human blood. At Harvard, Singer worked under the direction of Dr. A. Baird Hastings. His research was eventually interrupted by World War II. During World War II Singer served as a United States Navy flight surgeon in the Pacific Theater. In 1947 he completed his National Research Council Fellowship at Harvard University, and accepted a teaching position at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. Singer opted for a career change in 1952 when he accepted a position in life insurance underwriting at New England Mutual Life Insurance Company in Boston, MA. He remained with the firm until his retirement in 1979. It was at New England Mutual Life that Singer began his studies on the analysis of excess mortality follow-up studies – which he would continue after his retirement. The Richard Bunker Singer Papers document the family life and professional career of Dr. Singer. Dr. Singer’s career as an executive with the New England Life Insurance Company, his teaching material, and items related to his medical career are documented in the Professional Series.\n\nPublications of the Department of Surgery and the Harrison Department of Surgical Research, 1967\n\nUPL 1010.93 1967\n\nReport of the Harrison Department of Surgical Research\n\nUPI 491.3\n\n1937 – 1972 (with gaps)\n\nResearch Programs Department of Medicine School of Medicine.

In 1816 Horner began his career at the University of Pennsylvania when he was offered the position of dissector by Caspar Wistar, eventually rising to the position of Dean of the Medical School, and professor of anatomy. He traveled to Europe in 1821, where in France he was impressed by their advances in pathology, which influenced him to write a textbook on the subject and introduce the topic to American medical schools. The Journals detail William Edmonds Horner’s travels from the United States to Europe in 1821. Horner visited many of the usual sites of interest; he also visited many of the hospitals, physicians, and instrument makers – making notes on medical practices, anatomical collections, and other observations. He was particularly taken by the Hunterian Collection in London, and describes the method for making wax anatomical preparations which he learned from the curator.\n\nCrawford Williamson Long was a member of the Medical Class of 1839, and was the first surgeon in American to use ether as an anesthetic in a surgical operation in 1842. Long’s rural location and busy practice delayed his reporting of his findings until 1849. The Crawford Williamson Long Collection contains photographs of documents attesting to his use of ether as an anesthetic. The source of the letters is not indicated.\n\nDr. Nathan Francis Mossell serves as a pioneer among African American medical professionals in the late nineteenth century, paving an educational as well as professional path for both black men and women in Philadelphia as physicians and nurses. In 1879, Mossell became one of the first African Americans enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1882, Mossell was the first African American to receive a diploma from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. Roughly a decade late, in 1895, Dr. Mossell established the first private black hospital in the city and the second in the United States, the Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital and Nurse Training School at 1512 Lombard Street. The Nathan Mossell Papers document his medical career and social leadership from the 1890s to 1940s and they include professional and public writings by Dr. Mossell, specifically on the Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital and socio-political issues facing African Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\n\nJames Morton Boice received his of Bachelor of Arts degree in 1899 from the University of Pennsylvania. After studying abroad, Boice returned to Philadelphia and resumed his medical research, receiving an M.D. from the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia in 1904. Following graduation, he practiced medicine, specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, and assisted at many hospitals in Philadelphia. The James Morton Boice Scrapbook documents the social life of Boice and his involvement in a wide range of academic, professional, and social organizations. The scrapbook also contains items relating to Boice’s post-graduate travels abroad, his work at the Medico-Chirurgical College in Philadelphia, his involvement in local hospitals, and his active social life in Philadelphia.\n\nHelen Octavia Dickens was a 1934 graduate of the University of Illinois School of Medicine, the only African American woman in her graduating class. Later in her career she sought further training in obstetrics and gynecology, spending a year at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Medicine. Dickens passed the board examinations in 1945, becoming the first female African American board-certified OB/GYN in Philadelphia. That year, Dr. Dickens became Director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mercy Douglass Hospital in Philadelphia. In 1951, Dr. Dickens joined the courtesy staff of Women’s Hospital and would later be named chief of obstetrics and gynecology. When the University of Pennsylvania took over the Women’s Hospital in 1956, Dr. Dickens became a member of the staff and faculty in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the School of Medicine, becoming the first black woman to serve in this position. In addition to her medical practice, she was professor of obstetrics and gynecology. The Helen O. Dickens Papers document the latter half of Dickens’ career in the field of medicine, medical education and public health.
