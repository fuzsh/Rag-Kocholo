        "text": "Shocking murder in Mae Hong Son exposes Thailand’s domestic abuse crisis as husband uses ping pong bomb to kill wife. Arrest and intentional murder charges are to be brought. On the same day, a minister in Bangkok pledges legal reform to combat rising family violence in September.\n\nA shocking murder in the northern province of Mae Hong Son has again reminded the kingdom of its chronic domestic abuse problem. On an almost daily basis, heinous and inhuman acts appear across the kingdom’s media pages. The latest is a story of a man who placed a ping pong bomb in his wife’s mouth and exploded it on Monday night. On Tuesday, as police arrested the husband for questioning, a cabinet minister was promising an updated law to combat domestic violence within families and homes.\n\nJust hours after the Minister for Social Development Varawut Silpa-Archa outlined an updated law dealing with rising domestic violence, a truly shocking and horrific tale emerged from Mae Hong Son province.\n\nMok Champae Police Station in central Mae Hong Son was informed by a local village headman on Monday night.\n\nGruesome murder in Mae Hong Son shocks locals as husband kills wife with Ping Pong bomb in the mouth\n\nIn brief, a 54-year-old husband, addicted to alcohol and drugs, murdered his 53-year-old wife while she slept. Shockingly, he carried out the act by placing a ping-pong bomb in her mouth and exploding it.\n\nLater, the village headman at Village 4 in Mok Champae Subdistrict received notice of the incident from Mr. Yon, the woman’s husband.\n\nAfter that, the community leader and other locals rushed to the home.\n\nAt length, they were confronted by a terrifying sight. The woman’s face had been completely disfigured, her eyes bulging.\n\nAt the same time, her mouth had been blown wide open with teeth scattered on the bed. The woman was lying in a pool of blood.\n\nPolice open investigation into the shocking murder scene discovered in Mae Hong Son. Husband is the killer\n\nSubsequently, police were informed and arrived at the scene. The criminal investigation is being handled by Police Lieutenant Piyaphan Phiansa-ard, the Deputy Chief of Investigation.\n\nBy the time officers arrived at the scene, it was late at night. Consequently, the murder scene was sealed off and left under guard.\n\nAt 7 am on Tuesday, a forensics team arrived, and the criminal investigation got underway. The deceased woman was identified as 53-year-old Nang Luen.\n\nIn brief, she was reportedly much loved in the village. Certainly, she was a less-than-talkative figure who studied Dhamma.\n\nYoung husband arrested and confessed to the brutal murder of his wife on Sunday morning in Nonthaburi\n\nDark news as Swiss husband confesses to a brutal murder. Thai Wife found with a card in her mouth – Jack of Hearts\n\nInvestigating officers were told she was kind-hearted. Ms. Nang was a native of Shan State in North Eastern Burma across the border from Thailand.\n\nViolent history and an impossibly implausible account from the suspect in the case point to his guilt\n\nIn contrast, her husband Mr. Yon was noted to be argumentative and violent. Indeed, there was little doubt among villagers that Mr. Yon had committed the atrocity.\n\nHe was addicted to both alcohol and drugs. Nonetheless, he initially insisted to the village headman and later to the police that he was not involved.\n\nIn essence, he told police that he was asleep next to his wife.\n\nIn brief, he claimed to have awoken to find her dead in his bed. Furthermore, he heard no bang or explosion.\n\nOn Tuesday, police investigators found shrapnel from the exploded ping pong bomb among other items strewn on the floor of the bedroom.\n\nPing-pong bombs are powerful fireworks devices built into a ball-shaped format.\n\nIn particular, they are used to create disturbances. In addition, they are used to injure people. Notably, the devices are used in Bangkok among rival school gangs in street warfare.\n\nMr Yon, out of jealousy, forbade his wife to leave home before the vicious Murder. However, she defied him\n\nPolice Lieutenant Piyapan and his investigators learned that recently Mr. Yon had been arguing with his wife.\n\nShe was popular and recently had left home to sleep at a well-known temple with friends. Her husband, meanwhile, out of jealousy, had forbidden the excursion. At length, she had ignored him.\n\nOn Tuesday, as police forensic officers went about their work, he sat depressed on a bamboo mat in front of the home.\n\nSignificantly, it is understood that the property was owned by his wife. Afterwards, police arrested the 53-year-old and took him in for questioning.\n\nThe police are treating the case as intentional murder, and charges are expected to be pressed against Mr. Yon. At the same time, an autopsy was ordered and Ms. Luen’s body was taken to Si Sangwan Hospital.\n\nMinister pushes Domestic Violence law reform as abuse rises in Thailand linked to a very poor economy\n\nIn the meantime, also on Tuesday, Minister Varawut in Bangkok announced an update to the Victims of Domestic Violence Protection Act, 2007.\n\nAt length, this will be presented to the cabinet for final approval in September.\n\nThe new law has already been cleared by parliament and is now before an amendments committee.\n\nSpeaking after the revolting atrocity in Mae Hong Son, the minister admitted that domestic violence in Thailand is spiralling out of control. Murders in the most brutal and depraved fashion are an almost daily occurrence.\n\nNew Domestic Violence law to address underlying issues while extending government power and oversight\n\nIn particular, Minister Varawut referred to a Human Security Emergency Management Centre (HuSEC) report.\n\nIt blamed the problem on financial struggles, family feuds, and domestic abuse linked with alcohol and drugs. The new law will extend the power of government officials.\n\nIn addition, it will widen the scope and definition of families to be more inclusive.\n\nThe minister said that family stability is fundamental to the well-being of Thailand.\n\nIn short, without it, matters such as homelessness, violence, abuse of the vulnerable, and poverty will grow stronger.\n\nSignificantly, he said domestic violence is something that threatens all age groups from toddlers to the elderly. At the same time, all genders are exposed to this threat.\n\nThe law is expected to be published in the Royal Gazette directly after the cabinet approves the bill next month.\n\nJoin the Thai News forum, follow Thai Examiner on Facebook here\n\nReceive all our stories as they come out on Telegram here\n\nFollow Thai Examiner here\n\nFurther reading:\n\nYoung husband arrested and confesses to brutal murder of his wife on Sunday morning in Nonthaburi\n\nJack of Hearts – Swiss husband confesses to a brutal murder.
