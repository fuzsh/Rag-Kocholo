He is a creation of swirling anomalies, of so many different times, all over the world. He is the memory of a world that is lost, the premodern world, made manifest in a form of hatred for modernity, the new, the humanism and smiling coldness that marks our day to day existence. Forged from a perfect balance of irreconcilable anomalies and our breaking minds. He is an entity created by this overwhelming, unavoidable tension. Of the howl of the old world when faced with a cold, grey, purposeless new. He is the revenge of our fallen past. He is the idea of the ancient in a world which discards and fetishes it. „ ~ Dipesh Spivak on the Scarlet King in Tufto's Proposal.\n\nThe Scarlet King is the overarching antagonist in the SCP Foundation series. He is an ancient and evil god worshiped by groups such as the Children of the Scarlet King as a ruthless powerful monarch often tied to the destruction of the current world as we know it.\n\nHe serves as the overarching antagonist behind the articles SCP-231 and possibly SCP-2317, and the main antagonist of the \"Verse of an Endless Song\" series. He is one of the many anomalies proposed for the title of \"SCP-001\", an entry originally written for the 2018 Doomsday Contest.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat is the significance of the Scarlet King in the SCP Foundation mythos?\n\nThe Scarlet King, also known as SCP-001, holds a significant role in the SCP Foundation mythos. He is a living idea, created by human thought and the Foundation's interactions with the anomalous world. This interaction has led to the Scarlet King being retroactively placed in ancient times, rewriting history and gaining a number of unwilling followers. His presence has been known to create portals to a hellish dimension, manifest human blood in specific places, and even create fires that form imagery about him. However, the Foundation used SCP-6659 to destroy the idea of the Scarlet King, trapping him inside a sacrificial dagger and liberating humanity from his influence. Interestingly, it's revealed in SCP-5317 that the Scarlet King is a pawn of the anafabula known as SCP-2747, acting as a plot point that allows 2747 to manifest in the story.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWho are the Children of the Scarlet King and what is their relationship with him?\n\nThe Children of the Scarlet King are a group of individuals or subcultures that have come into contact with the Scarlet King, a character from the SCP universe. They venerate the King and his teachings, and believe in a philosophy of 'enlightenment through violation'. The King himself is a figure of violence and depravity, attracting psychopaths and deviants who attempt to summon him to the world. The Children's ultimate goal is to establish a hierarchy where the strong violently rule over the weak, and possibly enslave humanity. They seek to summon the King to turn the world into a post-apocalyptic wasteland, where they can rule supreme.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow is the Scarlet King related to SCP-231 and SCP-2317?\n\nThe relationship between the Scarlet King, SCP-231, and SCP-2317 is a complex one. SCP-231-7 is often referred to as the seventh human bride of the Scarlet King. SCP-2317, on the other hand, was originally not related to the Scarlet King. However, because many Foundation personnel believed they were the same, the concept of the Scarlet King absorbed SCP-2317-K, making them one entity. Some theories suggest that SCP-2317-K is a false decoy created in the King's image to hide the truth about his existence, while others propose that it might be one of his children. It's also theorized that the Scarlet King could be the final stage of SCP-2317-K. However, the creator of both entities personally believes they are separate. Ultimately, it's up to the reader's interpretation.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhy is the Scarlet King considered a candidate for the title of 'SCP-001'?\n\nThe Scarlet King is considered a candidate for the title of 'SCP-001' due to the immense power and mystery that surrounds this entity. In the SCP universe, there's no definitive canon, leading to various interpretations of the Scarlet King's existence and power. In some narratives, SCP-2317-K, another powerful entity, is absorbed by the Scarlet King due to the belief of Foundation personnel that they are the same. This fusion of entities further amplifies the Scarlet King's power, making him a formidable candidate for the SCP-001 title. However, it's important to note that the 'SCP-001' designation is often used for entities that have a significant impact on the SCP universe's lore and narrative, which the Scarlet King certainly does.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat role does the Scarlet King play in the 'Verse of an Endless Song' series?\n\nIn the 'Verse of an Endless Song' series, the Scarlet King, originally known as Khahrahk, plays a pivotal role as a god born from the Tree of Knowledge. Despite being the smallest of his siblings, he was the only one aware, which brought him immense pain. This led him to the conclusion that existence itself is painful, prompting his decision to destroy existence itself. He began this mission by consuming his siblings and growing stronger on their essence. His ultimate goal is to destroy the Tree, the Creator, and all of Creation. He is a multiversal threat, powerful enough to destroy entire worlds and civilizations, and even threaten the Tree of Knowledge itself. He also feeds on negative feelings, which has led to madness in some individuals, and is reportedly responsible for giving most reality-benders their powers.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nAppearance[]\n\nIn the tale \"Three Short Scenes About Death\" the Scarlet King is given a little description. His fist are described as massive and gnarled, holding the chains of his consorts and concubines. The same fists could effortlessly smash a man's throat. The King's voice is described as similar to \"the chittering of a billion infinitesimal insects\", and swirling and constantly moving. His voice also was neither \"high nor low nor cacophonous nor methodical\", simply just being. When the Scarlet King first appeared to the Serpent, he took the form of a girl in red clothes sitting on a rocking throne. On other occasions, the Scarlet King was depicted as a gigantic monstrous red whale that swam through the watery abyss, devoured everything in his path and dominated the food chain. In an Aztec codex, the Scarlet King was depicted as a giant with grey skin and a red headdress.\n\nAccording to Tufto's SCP-001 Proposal, the King is more akin to a living idea than an individual entity; in effect, he is the idea of nihilism, the people's dissatisfaction with the modern way of life, and can assimilate an entity thought to be him into an aspect of himself just as it did with SCP-2317-K. He is always depicted as figure with a crown-like ornament over his head showing royalty and associated with the color red, or in the cases of alien cultures lacking the perception of the color red the King would be associated with a color that would be synonymous or close with the color. In SCP-4989, Dr. Simon Kells described looking at the King \"like staring at a Pattern Screamer only more hollow\". When a group of Foundation agents confronted the physical form of the Scarlet King in his supposed throne room, he appeared as a young malnourished boy with hanging messy hair, crimson red eyes, wearing only a tunic and beaten sandals, and covered in blood, having taken the form of the first child who was sacrificed in his name. Drawn to the chaos caused during the Manhattan Crisis, the Scarlet King manifested himself as a false garden attempting to imitate nature.\n\nIn \"Dr. Wondertainment Goes Out With A Bang\", the Scarlet King was described as having an anorexic thin humanoid body, standing exactly seven feet tall and emitting blinding red light. His skin resembled that of a burnt corpse, his hands were gnarled claws, and possessed two great antlers behind his head and multiple eyes on his face. When confronting Cornelius Wondertainment he wore a military uniform covered in medals and rank markers.\n\nIn SCP-5641, the Scarlet King was described as ten trillion times Skanda's size, possessing seven mouths which spoke profanities, eyes that killed anyone who looked into them, and fourteen hands which he used to form all types of mudras. In SCP-6765, the King's body was described as a humanoid with a bleeding red maw surrounded by grasping arms and eyes while clouded by smoke and fire, and poured endless blood and released an endless inhumane scream.\n\nIn ROUNDERHOUSE's Jade Proposal, the Scarlet King was depicted as a gigantic androgynous red humanoid being with an obscured face and always accompanying his avatar who was depicted as a sleeping man with a long beard, an elaborate headdress and carrying long spears across his back. When approached by Greaves the Scarlet King took the form of a vast red sea, and when he took possession of the lieutenant, manifested at first as Greaves' nervous system glowing red before taking the appearance of a 3 meter tall skinless humanoid with a bare skull, large horns resting atop his head and inscribed with pulsating symbols and markings.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nThe Scarlet King as an old god from the Abyss was shown to be a cruel, manipulative, and nihilistic individual, though this was more of an image he held to his insecurity and cowardice. After learning about the true nature of existence, he thought that reality should not exist. He became hellbent on destroying everything, especially the tree of knowledge, by any means necessary, enslaving and devouring numerous gods and doing whatever pleased him. It is believed that if SCP-999 were to interact with the Scarlet King, then his heart would change and finally see the beauty of the world and abandon his quest of destruction. It was noted that the Scarlet King was always honest, instead having his subjects lie on his behalf.\n\nIn Tufto's Proposal, however, it is shown that the Scarlet King has no true personality of his own, instead his nature being shaped by the belief of humanity. Because the Indians became furious at the British colonizers for studying and categorizing their culture, taking away their traditions and \"civilizing\" them, this caused the idea of the Scarlet King to develop and form a deep-seated hatred against the current state of modern world. Because most people believed that the Scarlet King was an ancient demonic god determined to end all existence, it became so, although it can be interpreted that destroying the world means to only destroy the current state of the world and return humanity to ancient feudalism, which would also result in him completing his mission and ceasing to exist. According to URA-9521, a cephalopod-like monster born from the union of the King and a Daeva matriarch, the King was for the most part a mindless force that learned from the people believing in the ideology he represented, and even advised the Foundation that they should concentrate more on his followers rather than the King himself.\n\nIn ROUNDERHOUSE's Jade Proposal, not much is known about the Scarlet King's personality. The art representation of him portrayed the Scarlet King as a softer figure, appearing more magnanimously indifferent to the sacrifices offered by his Daeva rather than vengeful and demanding. He is also often depicted as dancing with his Maharaja, and the Daevas believe that the Scarlet King is their protector while he considered them his chosen people. He didn't take well to the arrival of the Foundation personnel in Korar, which disturbed his dreams that maintained the realm, but was willing to bond with Lt. Lucian Greaves in order to save the Daevas and get back at their common enemies.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nThe Scarlet King's true power is unknown, though he can impregnate various females in groups of seven with his Scarlet Spawn, whose birth caused great catastrophes around the world. Legends portray him as capable to conquer and destroy entire worlds and civilizations, and threaten other low elder gods. The Scarlet King is stated to be powerful enough to threaten all of Creation and the Tree of Knowledge itself, making him a multiversal threat. He also feeds on the negative feelings of people as he did with Dr. Clef which resulted in the latter's madness and is apparently responsible for giving most reality-benders their powers. Although he and his followers were able to defeat both Mekhane and Nahash, in another account he was described as being weaker than his aunt Yaldabaoth, the Brothers Death, Ama Kubeya and Sanna, having defeated the latter only through the help of Jeser. In SCP-6765, the King's corpse is shown to be capable of mass destruction and had power over blood and the memories stored in it, as shown when confronted by armed Foundation agents it simply removed their memories on how to operate a firearm. In SCP-8008's altered reality of Eluthertopia, the Scarlet King was the source of the Anti-Magic, a form of creation magic that was sent back in time to convert matter into pure energy, in a way destroying matter, which counteracted the Metegian creation magic of the three goddesses Inanna, Gaea and Mary, though they could be combined and used interchangeably.\n\nAs a living idea born from humanity's dissatisfaction with the lifeless modern world and the desire to return to the old ways of life, the Scarlet King was created and shaped by humanity, acting as premodernity's vengeance against modernity and as long as modernity exists in its current state the Scarlet King would also persist existing. As a result, the Scarlet King exists as an entity in the noosphere, the human collective consciousness, just like SCP-3125, WAN, SCP-6820-A and possibly the Neon God, and could both affect and be affected by humanity: the idea of the King would haunt those who learned about his true nature, inflicting dreams in them and corrupting them, while various incarnations of the King would be created from the belief of various legends, such as his origin as a god which would be retroactively written as somewhat being the case. When people began interacting with the idea of the Scarlet King, he would also affect reality by creating portals to a hellish dimension, create sounds of hymns sung about him, manifest human blood in specific places and fires that formed imagery about him. However, the Foundation would later use SCP-6659 to completely destroy the idea of the Scarlet King from the noosphere, trapping him inside a sacrificial dagger acting as his totem and liberating humanity from his influence.\n\nIn SCP-5317, it is revealed that the Scarlet King is a pawn of the anafabula designated as SCP-2747. Because the Scarlet King has the character tropes of a stereotypical Big Bad of a story, he acts as a plot point that allows 2747 to manifest in the story. SCP-2747 used the Scarlet King to drive stories to boring and unsatisfying endings which paved way for the antinarrative to manifest itself and devour the entirety of those realities. In SCP-6747, after Dr. King partially merged with SCP-2747, becoming a powerful antinarrative entity designated SCP-6747-C, he also became an iteration of the Scarlet King, suggesting that most if not all incarnations of the Scarlet King are manifestations of SCP-2747.\n\nIn ROUNDERHOUSE's Jade Proposal, the Scarlet King was a formless god representing the survival in the unforgiving nature. Although he was left in a weakened state his dreams of the Daeva and Korar became real, albeit in the astral plane which was likely connected to the Oneiroi dreamworld. As the Daevas were nature spirits, the Scarlet King held great power over plant life, or more broadly over nature. However, he alone was unable to maintain Korar and needed to possess an avatar, the Scarlet Maharaja, to reach his full potential. The Scarlet Maharaja was one of the most powerful sorcerers the world had ever seen, but was limited by the fact that he needed to be put asleep in order for the Daevas and Korar to exist. Only those with a strong mind could host the Scarlet as his being could easily annihilate the mind of a normal human. Lucian Greaves proved to be strong enough to be possessed by the Scarlet, causing them to manifest in a new body separate from the lieutenant's original one, and easily massacred an entire fleet of modified Mekhanites without even touching them.\n\nFollowers[]\n\nBrides[]\n\nThe Scarlet King is almost always seen accompanied by his seven brides which are known as the Scarlet Brides. The Brides have appeared in various forms which ranged from seven Daeva matriarchs, to the Scarlet King's own daughters conceived from a previous mate, and to a pod of seven female whales. However, the Brides are less than actual entities and more of a phenomenon as the Scarlet King is capable of impregnating organisms in group of seven through numerous means and would then give birth to creatures labeled as the Scarlet Spawn which portray the King as a fertility idol and vary greatly in appearance, behavior and function. Certain Neo-Daevites believe that the Brides have, all but one, been taken by the King and if the final Bride were to give birth then it would cause an apocalyptic event.\n\nThe Spawn include: the Scarlet Children which are identical to normal humans from both biology and personality and is impossible to tell them apart; the Holy Beasts, known to the public as the Humboldt squids, are cephalopodic monsters engineered by the Daevites for war; and the Scarlet Covenant, a group of humanoid monsters born from the union of the King and several Daeva matriarchs, which are capable of wearing the peeled skin of humans and perfectly impersonate them.\n\nThe Brides throughout history may have given birth to SCP-166, SCP-682, SCP-999, the whale encountered by the Foundation's Esoteric Warfare Unit, Jack of Spades/Hgan, SCP-4547-B4, the unborn child from SCP-5832, Chòndu'ang and the parent of Òdde. Although SCP-231-7 is once depicted as she herself being the seventh child, rebirthing herself as the Horseman of Conquest. It is also hinted that SCP-231-7 instead of being pregnant with the Scarlet King's child, she is pregnant with the Scarlet King himself, meaning that she serves to birth the physical form of the King into the world. Dr. Dylan King is also the son of either the Scarlet King, the Hanged King, or both.\n\nOther Followers[]\n\nThe Scarlet King has been worshipped by numerous radical groups, the most prominent being the Children of the Scarlet King and doubtfully the savage Daevite Empire. The Children are a series of cults which consist of countless individuals who believe in the establishment of a bloody hierarchy of strength around the world. They see the King as the representation of social darwinism and mostly fascism, a powerful oppressive monarch who sits above the weak and needs to be served and obeyed by those beneath him. As an idea of this ideology, the King is opposed to peaceful equality and freedom without violence as individuals should fight for power and conquer their enemies who are considered lesser than them. Because the Scarlet King is empowered by his followers, it should be considered that the followers could be more dangerous than the King as he is a living idea that affects like-minded people.\n\nThe Scarlet King was able to corrupt several disturbed individuals such as the Little Mister known as Mr. Redd, the time-traveling Turkmen tribe designated SCP-3838-8 and the reality-bender Lilly, pushing them into becoming cruel abusers and conquerors, acting as the King's messengers and spreading chaos and pain. Other cults worshiping the Scarlet King founded by non-humans include: the short-lived groups present in SCP-378's species and the SCP-1000 civilization, and the Reypay 'Eveng (Blood Children) which was formed on the planet designated SCP-4547 inhabited by the taronyu alien race.\n\nIn several depictions of his pantheon, the Scarlet King is depicted as having gathered many fellow gods as his subordinates, among them were The Factory, Jeser, Goran, Moloch, Kenkgor, and the Hanged King (though the latter is also depicted as opposing or being unaffiliated with the Scarlet King depending on canon). He, alongside the Hanged King and Bobble the Clown, formed a version of the Trinity which was known as the \"Trinity of the Red Court\". He was also associated with the King Worm, the Verdant Mage, and the Violet Queen, who were all worshipped alongside him by the Daevites. Other servants included: Rama-Vaduk, Amana-Kifenn, Karal-ba, Toth-ner, and three other demons which are all imprisoned with a set of seven spears collectively designated as KTE-2013-Kapala-Mendes capable of summoning various monsters of the Scarlet King's army.\n\nThe Ghul of Universe L453 \"Harald's Hole\" that resided at the center of SCP-7005, a multidimensional transport network known as Lampeter, also worshipped the Scarlet King. However, this universe's version of the King was far more benevolent, being described as a kind and merciful figure, and one of Ghul even believed that the King would help unite the populations of various universes and under his red beautiful sky people, poor and rich alike, would live in equality.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nOther Media[]\n\nIn Music[]\n\nThe Australian-based band known as the Atomic Beau Project released on March 23, 2019, a song based on the Scarlet King and SCP-2317 titled \"The King\".\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe concept of the Scarlet King was originally created by author DrClef in SCP-231, but the character was properly developed by other authors such as Djoric, Tufto and UraniumEmpire.\n\nDrClef when creating both SCP-231 and SCP-2317 was partially inspired by the now-deleted version of SCP-363 titled \"Tree-Like Horns\" which had been based on \"The Walkers\" painting by Justin Cherry.\n\nTufto has regretted several decisions he took when writing the SCP-001 Proposal, since it has been misinterpreted as being a criticism for modernity, similar to a postmodernist view, but in truth it was meant to be about the inability to let go of the flawed outdated past.\n\nThe Scarlet King has been influenced by numerous entities across religion, mythology and fiction, with some being: The Devil, Abaddon, the Leviathan, Typhon, Chernobog, Hastur, the Crimson King, Ahriman, Khorne and Z̤͂â̢ḷ͊g̹̓ȯ̘.\n\nGiven that the Scarlet King was revealed in Tufto's Proposal to be the embodiment of the conflict between premodernity and modernity created by human thought, this makes him similar to the Idea of Evil from Berserk. The Scarlet King's depiction in SCP-6462 and \"Omnigenesis and the Law of Blades\" was based off Jagganoth from Kill Six Billion Demons. The Scarlet King's portrayal in \"Tears and Bone\" was based on Edgar Allan Poe's story Hop-Frog. In ROUNDERHOUSE's Jade Proposal, the Scarlet shares similarities with Azathoth as both beings could create a world and life from their dreams alone, with the difference being that the Scarlet King is much weaker and willingly slumbered for his dreams to maintain Korar.\n\nThe Scarlet King is often theorized to possibly be the true or final stage of SCP-2317-K, an untold horror that even the SCP Foundation has difficulty containing and documenting. Since the wiki has no real canon, it is ultimately up to the reader to believe if SCP-2317 and the Scarlet King are one and the same. However, 2317's creator personally believes that it and the Scarlet King are completely separate entities.\n\nSCP-3806-A claims that Yaldabaoth and the Scarlet King are known to snatch human souls in the astral plane. She also suggests that Odin is also gathering honorable souls to form an army in order to fight either the Scarlet King or Yaldabaoth in the end of times.\n\nThe Scarlet King is often associated with whales. This is because the author Djoric joked about SCP-231-7's race being redacted and that since it was five letters long she could have been a whale instead of a human.\n\nIn the universe of SCP-6001 where the Compendium, a benevolent amalgam organization of different GoIs, took over the world and declared worldwide peace with all anomalies, it is mentioned that they were capable of vanquishing and probably even killing the Scarlet King and his pantheon.\n\nIn the joke tale \"Tim Wilson KILLS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE!!!\", the Scarlet King is one of the many notable beings killed off-screen by Tim Wilson of Wilson's Wildlife Solutions.\n\nIn the comedic tale \"Dust and Shopper's Rewards\", the Scarlet King goes shopping at Walmart in order to provide food for his daughter/wife, and there, he also meets O5-1 who informs the King on how 231-7 was doing. After he became annoyed with the service of the store, the Scarlet King tried to leave before realizing that he became trapped there in a similar manner to SCP-3008.\n\nIn the year 3870 A.D. in the universe of Earth-7M, the Scarlet King was able to manifest himself in that reality and proceeded to have intercourse with the universe's sun.\n\nIn Djoric's headcanon, SCP-682, SCP-879 and SCP-058 are the spawn of the Scarlet King, while SCP-999 is nothing more than the still-living placenta of one of the spawn.\n\nAccording to \"A Contingency, if this Wonderful World Doesn't Happen\", if \"What a Wonderful World\" were to be continued as planned it would have been revealed that the Scarlet King was using Isabel Wondertainment V as a vessel after the universe was recreated and he converted into the idea of progress as a result of representing the ever-present human ambition. Under the influence of the King Isabel would become a ruthless extremist leading a revolution against The Factory and later the Foundation and its allies, wanting to abolish the Veil of Secrecy and force humanity to progress even if it costs the lives of the non-notable and weaker individuals. This story would've been influenced by Animal Farm.\n\n[]\n\nScarlet King (Djoricverse only) on the Pure Evil Wiki\n\nScarlet King on the SCPOneCanonProject Wiki\n\nScarlet King on the Monsters Wiki\n\nScarlet King on the SCP Database Wiki\n\nTufto's Proposal on the SCP Explained\n\nNavigation[]"
