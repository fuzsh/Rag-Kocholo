        "text": "Another mass killing happened in the United States on Tuesday after authorities say one man killed six people and wounded three in a trail of attacks that stretched 80 miles (129 kilometers) between Austin and the San Antonio area.\n\nTexas authorities charged a man with capital murder Wednesday in the killings. For authorities in Austin, it began with the shooting of a school district officer about 10:45 a.m. Tuesday. The officer is expected to survive.\n\nA little over an hour later, police responding to calls about gunfire at an Austin home found two people with signs of trauma. One was dead and the other died at a hospital.\n\nJust before 5 p.m., a male cyclist was shot, but police say his injuries were not life-threatening. About two hours later, police responded to a call of a burglary in progress at another home and found two people dead. An Austin police officer who responded to the call saw a man in the back yard and the man shot him. The officer was taken to a hospital, where he was listed in stable condition.\n\nPolice said the man, who was not hit, drove away and police chased him. He crashed at about 7:15 p.m. and was taken into custody. The man had a gun.\n\nIn the San Antonio area, authorities said the bodies of two more people were found inside a home after deputies saw water coming out of the home, as though something was leaking inside. Authorities said the deaths appeared to have happened before the shootings in Austin, but the same man was suspected in all the killings.\n\nThe attacks were the country’s 42nd mass killing this year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. At least 217 people have died this year in those killings, which are defined as incidents in which four or more people have died within a 24-hour period, not including the killer — the same definition used by the FBI.\n\nHere’s what happened in the other U.S. mass killings this year.\n\nNEW YORK CITY: Dec. 3\n\nA 38-year-old man used a knife to kill four relatives, including two children, and stab another woman and two police officers before one of the officers fatally shot him. The man set fire to the home where the attack happened making it difficult for authorities to recover the bodies of a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman and a man in his 30s who had all been fatally stabbed. An 11-year-old girl who was found outside the house also died.\n\nVANCOUVER, WASHINGTON: Dec. 3\n\nA man fatally shot his wife, their two adult daughters and his brother before killing himself inside the home. Authorities were called to the house after the suspected shooter texted someone and indicated that he had “harmed others” there.\n\nDALLAS: Dec. 3\n\nAuthorities say a man killed four people including a 1-year-old boy and wounded a 15-year-old girl in a shooting at a Dallas home. The 21-year-old man then fatally shot himself while being pursued by officers 200 miles (322 kilometers) away in Austin. Three adults, including a woman the man had dated and been accused of assaulting in the past, died at the home. The young boy died at a hospital.\n\nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE: Dec. 2\n\nPolice believe a 52-year-old man killed four of his female relatives — three women and a teenage girl — and seriously injured a fifth teen girl in a series of shootings at three different locations. The man fled but then died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound the next day. Authorities found his body in his car.\n\nCLINTON, NORTH CAROLINA: Oct. 26\n\nFive people — ages 73, 58, 47, 39 and 33 — were found fatally shot in a home shortly before 1 a.m. Authorities said they received a 911 call from someone who spoke to a victim earlier that night and later found the bodies upon entering the home. The local sheriff did not immediately have information about a suspect but said his department was investigating some people of interest.\n\nLEWISTON, MAINE: Oct. 25\n\nA 40-year-old man opened fire at a bowling alley and a restaurant, killing at least 18 people and wounding at least 13. He was a U.S. Army reservist and firearms instructor. Police found him dead two days later from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a recycling facility where he had recently worked. Fellow service members had raised flags about his behavior, mental health state and potential for violence before the shootings.\n\nROMEOVILLE, ILLINOIS: Sept. 17\n\nA couple, their two children — ages 7 and 9 — and three dogs were found fatally shot in their suburban Chicago home. Police were asked to check on the family after one member did not show for work that morning and phone calls went unanswered, authorities said. A 32-year-old man was suspected in the deaths. He died days later after a fiery crash in Oklahoma, along with a passenger, and had a relationship with the victims, police said.\n\nLAKE TOWNSHIP, OHIO: Aug. 24\n\nFive members of a family, including three children, were found dead at a home in Lake Township, Ohio, by police officers performing a welfare check. Authorities say a husband and wife and their two daughters and son died from gunshot wounds and their deaths are being investigated as a domestic dispute that turned deadly. It’s unclear who fired the shots.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY: Aug. 16\n\nPolice in Oklahoma City said a 28-year-old man fatally shot three young children — ages 9, 5 and 2 — and his estranged wife before taking his own life. Officers visited the family home following a report of a domestic disturbance. Authorities described the couple as married but separated and said police had never been called to a domestic disturbance at the home before. They added that investigators have not yet determined a motive.\n\nHAMPTON, GEORGIA: July 15\n\nA 40-year-old man is accused of fatally shooting four people, all in their 60s, in a suburb south of Atlanta. Police said the man’s motive was not immediately clear. The killings set off a massive search that ended with a shootout that killed the man in another suburb about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away. The exchange of gunfire wounded a sheriff’s deputy and two police officers.\n\nSHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA: July 4\n\nMultiple males are believed to have exchanged gunfire at an annual Independence Day block party just before midnight, leaving at least four people dead and at least seven others injured, according to police. Suspects were not quickly identified, and arrests were not immediately made.\n\nPHILADELPHIA: July 3\n\nA 40-year-old man is accused of opening fire randomly with an AR-15-style rifle, killing four people and wounding four others, including a 2-year-old, in a southwest Philadelphia neighborhood. Authorities said the man fatally shot another person in a row house the day before.\n\nGREEN POND, SOUTH CAROLINA: July 2\n\nA 33-year-old man was charged with murder in the killings of his sister-in-law and 11-year-old daughter after authorities found six people dead and one person in critical condition at a home while responding to reports of a house fire and stabbings, officials said. They did not immediately identify a motive. The man was later charged in connection with the other four deaths, according to media reports.\n\nKELLOGG, IDAHO: June 18\n\nA 31-year-old man is accused of fatally shooting four members of a neighboring family in their apartment on Father’s Day. The man was upset that the neighbor’s 18-year-old son had reportedly exposed himself to the man’s children, a police document alleges.\n\nSEQUATCHIE, TENNESSEE: June 15\n\nA 48-year-old man is thought to be responsible for killing himself and five others — including three children and his estranged wife — in a home where police responded to a shooting and arrived to find the residence ablaze, authorities said.
