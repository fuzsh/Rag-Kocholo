        "text": "I’ve always been fascinated by serial killers. There’s something both creepy and scary about them. To me, they are symbols of the worst humans can do but proof that most of us aren’t THAT bad. And because this is 8Asians, I thought I’d do some research on Asian/Asian American serial killers.\n\nBut first, let’s define what a serial killer is. According to Wikipedia:\n\nA serial killer is typically defined as a person who murders three or more people over a period of more than 30 days, with a ‘cooling off” period between each murder, and whose motivation for killing is largely based on psychological gratification.\n\nTo be clear, people like Seung-Hui Cho (Virginia Tech massacre) are not serial killers. Instead, they should be considered mass murderers or a person who kills four or more people at one time.\n\nWhen most people think of serial killers, they imagine single white men. However, there have been serial killers of every race, gender, sexual orientation, and social economic status. Some have been smart and personable, others awkward and not very bright. Some have been single and others have been married. Some have even murdered with their spouses right there helping them!\n\nWith that being said, I found only two Asian American serial killers, Charles Ng and Andrew Cunanan. A detail of both Ng, Cunanan, and a bunch of killers from Asia, after the jump!\n\nOn the left, Chinese American Charles Ng is suspected of killing anywhere from 11 to 25 women in Northern California during the 1980s. He was unusual in that he worked with a partner (Leonard Lake). He is currently on death row at San Quentin State Prison.\n\nOn the right, hapa/Filipino American Andrew Cunanan is most well-known for murdering fashion designer Gianni Versace. What is less well-known is that he killed four other people in less than a year. Andrew shot himself before he could be caught and tried for any of the murders.\n\nI’m not too surprised that there are only two Asian American serial killers but I’m curious to see if there will be more as the API populations increases over the next few decades.\n\nWhat about outside of America; are there Asian serial killers? Of course there are! There are serial killers on every continent and in every country! The only reason there seems to be so many American serial killers is because we’ve spent a lot of time studying them and finding ways to catch them.\n\nThe most recent case of an Asian serial killer was in the Philippines. According to the Huffington Post, Mark Dizon “is accused of killing nine people – six Filipinos, an American, a Canadian and a Briton – in three different robberies at hotels and homes this month (January 2011) in Angeles city.”\n\nHere’s a picture I found of Mark on AP:\n\nHere is a list I cut and paste from Wikipedia of other serial killers from Asian countries:\n\nPeople’s Republic of China\n\nGong Runbo: found guilty of the murders of six children and teenagers aged between nine and 16 from 2005 to 2006\n\nHuang Yong: between September 2001 and 2003 killed at least 17 teenage boys; executed in 2003\n\nShen Changyin and Shen Changping: found guilty of the murders of 11 prostitutes\n\nYang Xinhai: confessed to killing 65 people between 2000 and 2003; executed in 2004\n\nHong Kong\n\nLam Kor-wan: sexual sadist who murdered and dismembered four women in the 1980s; sentenced to life imprisonment\n\nLam Kwok-wai: murdered three women\n\nCharles Sobhraj: killed at least 12 Western tourists in Southeast Asia during the 1970s\n\nIndia\n\nThug Behram: alleged to have killed over 900 people; executed in 1840\n\nSurender Koli: convicted of raping and murdering four children in Delhi in 2005 and 2006 with another 12 cases pending\n\nRaman Raghav: killed homeless people and others in their sleep\n\nAuto Shankar: murdered nine teenage girls in Thiruvanmiyur, Chennai during a six-month period in 1988; executed in 1995\n\nJoshi-Abhyankar Serial Murders: Quartet committed around 10 murders.\n\nIndonesia\n\nAhmad Suradji: admitted to killing 42 women; sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on July 10, 2008\n\nVerry Idham Henyansyah: convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of 11 people\n\nJapan\n\nSataro Fukiage: raped and killed at least seven girls in the early 20th century\n\nHiroaki Hidaka: killed four prostitutes in 1996; executed on December 25, 2006\n\nMiyuki Ishikawa: murdered an estimated 103, but could have been up to 169 infants in the 1940s\n\nKiyotaka Katsuta: firefighter who shot and strangled at least eight people, some during robberies, between 1972 and 1982\n\nYoshio Kodaira: rapist thought to have killed 11 people in Japan and Chinese people as a soldier\n\nGenzo Kurita: killed six women and two children and engaged in rape and necrophilia\n\nHiroshi Maeue: AKA “Suicide Website Murderer”; lured people from suicide clubs promising to kill himself with his victims\n\nFutoshi Matsunaga and Junko Ogata: AKA “House of Horror”; tortured and killed at least seven people between 1996 and 1998, including Ogata’s family\n\nTsutomu Miyazaki: AKA “The Otaku Murderer”, “The Little Girl Murderer” and “Dracula”; killed four preschool-age girls and ate the hand of a victim; executed in 2008\n\nSeisaku Nakamura: AKA “Hamamatsu Deaf Killer”, murdered at least nine people\n\nAkira Nishiguchi: killed five people and engaged in fraud\n\nKiyoshi Ōkubo: raped and murdered eight young women during 41 days in 1971\n\nPakistan\n\nJaved Iqbal: believed to have killed 100 boys\n\nSouth Korea\n\nYoo Young-chul: cannibal; killed 21 people from September 2003 to July 2004, mainly young women and rich men\n\nUnidentified serial killers\n\nThis is a list of unidentified serial killers.
