        "text": "August 26, 1987\n\n87-217 - Death Valley - Fire Involving Toxic Chemicals\n\nLocation: Not specified\n\nA fire was ignited in a small trailer by a welding torch. Although it was suppressed within 15 minutes, a number of chemicals which were stored within were affected. A one-gallon container of a household Ortho insecticide was consumed; a one-gallon container of Kuron (Silvex), one hundred gallons of Turdon and two one-gallon containers of Rotenone were heat- affected. Twenty-nine persons in three downwind buildings - a grade school, a pre-school, and a residence - were evacuated as a precaution. There were no injuries.\n\nToxic spill notifications have been made by the park, and they are awaiting instructions from authorities. For further information, contact Ranger Terry Harris at 619-786-2331.\n\nSeptember 15, 1987\n\n87-217A - Death Valley - Followup - Toxic Chemical Fire\n\nLocation: Unspecified\n\nAn EPA team responded to the park and all samples of the environment which they tested were negative of Tuordane. The remaining containers which had. not ruptured but had been affected by the heat of the fire were turned over to DOW Chemical for destruction. The other insecticides are being held for future clean up by EPA. The site is currently clean. The park has requested a board of review to be held, concerning the fire. They have requested individuals from Western Regional Office to serve on the board. Due the the wildland fire situation many of those persons currently are still out of the office on fire crews. The total report is still not complete on the incident and a board of review may be schedule in the next week.\n\nNovember 6, 1987\n\n87-259 - Death Valley - Flash Floods - Closing of Park Facilities\n\nLocation: Various\n\nA severe storm and accompanying heavy rains caused flooding which led to the closure of all park roads and isolated the Furnace Creek area overnight. Approximately 15,000 persons were affected, many of them participants in a Forty-Niner encampment in the park. All park roads were reopened on the morning of November 6th except for the road to Scotty's Castle. No information was available concerning the extent of flood damage in the park.\n\nNovember 9, 1987\n\n87-262 - Death Valley - Employee Spouse Fatality\n\nLocation: Outside of park\n\nS.W., the wife of Death Valley administrative officer R.W., was killed while driving back from a shopping trip to Las Vegas on Saturday night. Her car was hit head-on by another vehicle which had drifted into her lane, apparently because the driver of that vehicle fell asleep at the wheel. No further information is presently available.\n\nMarch 18, 1988\n\n88-39 - Death Valley - Body Recovery\n\nLocation: Salt Flats\n\nOn the morning of March 4th, a park visitor reported finding a grave within the park. The site, located near the salt flats on the valley floor, contained a shallow human burial which had been partially uncovered by coyotes. Subsequent investigation determined that the person had been killed, and Inyo County issued a first degree murder warrant on March 16th for the victim's son, who had fled to Oregon. The son has been arrested, a confession has been obtained, and extradition is being pursued. It's been determined that the murder was committed in Minnesota. The body was then transported to the park and buried there.\n\nMarch 21, 1988\n\n88-42 - Death Valley - Drug Arrests\n\nLocation: Furnace Creek Ranch\n\nPark rangers and Inyo County Sheriff's Office deputies concluded a 10-week- long Inyo County undercover operation with the arrest of 13 employees of Fred Harvey Company, the park concessioner, on a variety of drug-related charges. Ten of the 13, all of whom were temporary employees of the concessioner, were charged with felony sale and distribution of methamphetamines, LSD, cocaine and marijuana. The arrests took place at Furnace Creek Ranch, which is on private land inside the park. Investigation and undercover operations by the sheriff's office are continuing.\n\nMay 2, 1988\n\n88-68 - Death Valley - Search\n\nLocation: Wildrose Peak\n\nSix-year-old J.H. became lost around mid-day on April 30th during a father-son outing. He and his father were hiking Wildrose Peak when they became separated at the 8,000 foot level. A call for help was received at 1 pm, and the park immediately set up and took charge of an interagency incident command system to manage the search. The child was found just before 8 pm. Despite extreme weather conditions (winds of 60 mph, temperatures dropping below 30 degrees and snow flurries), he was found to be in excellent physical and mental condition when checked by a doctor on the scene.\n\nJune 14, 1988\n\n88-103 - Death Valley - Search and Rescue\n\nLocation: Valley Salt Pans\n\nA.G. began a solo hike from Bad Water to Telescope Peak on Friday. He was carrying three quarts of water, but drank two shortly after starting the hike and lost the third. Although A.G. then aborted his hike, he was already stressed physically. While out on patrol the following day, ranger Kent Meacham was surveying the salt pans with binoculars when he spotted the victim falling down. Meacham started an IV to get fluids into A.G., then called for a medevac flight. A.G. was transported to Las Vegas where he is being treated for dehydration and hypothermia. Doctors stated that the victim would probably have been dead within the hour if Meacham had not found him and promptly begun medical assistance.\n\nTuesday, January 3, 1989\n\n88-285 - Death Valley - Theft of Government Property\n\nBetween 7 p.m. on December 27th and 7 a.m. on the 28th, three campground vault safes were broken into and a total of $1,500 was stolen. Rangers and deputies from the Inyo County Sheriff's Office are investigating.\n\nThursday, January 5, 1989\n\n88-285 - Death Valley - Follow-up on Theft from Campground Safes\n\nThe three safes which were broken into and removed were honor system vaults from Furnace Creek and Sunset Campgrounds. Two vaults have since been recovered. There are no leads or suspects. The vault at Furnace Creek has been relocated to a point close to the campground host's trailer; collections are being made both in the morning and at night, and campers are complying with requests to make their deposits between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. and to report any nighttime activity around the vaults to rangers. The park will employ surveillance and improve lock designs to prevent further losses.\n\nWednesday, February 22, 1989\n\n89-24 - Death Valley - Serious Employee Illness\n\nOn the evening of February 16th, park ranger Nancy Blomquist, 31, became seriously ill. A park paramedic who came to her aid found that she was experiencing severe internal bleeding and placed her on advanced life support due to her weakened and deteriorating condition. She was transported by vehicle to the Furnace Creek Airport and then airlifted to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas. At the time of the report (yesterday morning), she was reported to be in serious but stable condition. (Clay Connor, RAD, WRO).\n\nTuesday, March 21, 1989\n\n89-53 - Death Valley - Search\n\nOn the afternoon of March 10th, an abandoned vehicle was discovered north of the Cow Creek residential area. A search was begun for the owner, R.H.; at its peak, the search involved eight Southern California SAR units and more than 40 searchers. No sign of R.H. was found, and the search was reduced to a limited effort by park rangers on March 15th. R.H.'s family concurred with the decision to scale back the search. (Dispatch, DEVA, via Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO).\n\nWednesday, December 13, 1989\n\n89-354 - Death Valley (California) - Structural Fire\n\nAt 8:30 p.m. on the 10th, the park's fire department responded to a structural fire at the Death Valley elementary school at Cow Creek, which is only a few hundred yards from the fire station. Due to the promptness of their response, the fire was contained to a utility room, and there was limited smoke and fire damage to the building. An investigation into the cause of the fire is underway. (Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe report from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO).\n\nWednesday, March 21, 1990\n\n90-42 - Death Valley (California) - Fatality\n\nOn March 17th, a motorcyclist was killed instantly when he hit a passenger sedan head-on near Mormon Point. The four occupants of the sedan were seriously injured in the collision. No further information is currently available on this incident. (Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 2:30 EST, 3/19/90).\n\nWednesday, April 25, 1990\n\n90-78 - Death Valley (California) - MVA Fatality\n\nOn the 22nd, J.C., 51, of Ridgecrest, California, was ejected from a van during a one-car accident at Wildrose Junction and died of multiple injuries. The California Highway Patrol is investigating the incident. (Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 4:30 p.m. EDT, 4/24/90).\n\nFriday, June 1, 1990\n\n90-117 - Death Valley (California) - Methamphetamine laboratory\n\nOn May 27th, a ranger following some off-road vehicle tracks came upon a working methamphetamine lab in the Saratoga Springs area of the park, and called for back up. Rangers park and BLM, deputies from the Inyo and San Bernadino Sheriffs' Offices, and officers in a California Highway Patrol helicopter responded. One suspect fled the area at high speed and made his getaway, but four others were arrested and booked in San Bernadino on charges of off-road travel, possession of firearms, destruction of natural features, and felony production and operation of a drug lab. On the following day, an NPS/San Bernadino County investigative team returned to the lab, which was hidden in a box canyon. The lab contained underground facilities and is considered to be one of the three largest labs ever found in the county. The team seized a number of shotguns, semi-automatic rifles and handguns, and ether weapons; they also confiscated four, four-wheel drive vehicles, four portable generators, camping gear, $80,000 worth of methamphetamines, and over worth of $10,000 of manufacturing equipment. Warrants have been issued for the suspect at large for conspiracy and manufacturing and distribution of methamphetamine. This operation appears to have been in its initial state of operation and had the potential for producing over $210,000 of methamphetamine immediately. Due to the remoteness of the area and the lack of patrols due to insufficient staffing (only one ranger patrols the 750,000 acres in which the lab was found), this operation was not detected until now. Toxic cleanup has been scheduled and the estimated cost will be in excess of $40,000. (Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 4 p.m. EDT, 5/31).\n\nMonday, June 4, 1990\n\n90-117 - Death Valley (California) - Follow-up on Methamphetamine Lab\n\nPark rangers have found an additional 15 pounds of methamphetamine hidden in an ammunition can 2 00 yards from the first lab's location. The new find has a street value of $320,000, bringing the total value of drugs found to over $500,000. Hazardous materials crews have cleaned the area at a cost of over $32,000, and the area has been inspected and cleared by county health authorities. (Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 6/1).\n\nTuesday, June 19, 1990\n\n90-117 - Death Valley (California) - Follow-up on Methamphetamine Lab\n\nThree park rangers returned to the lab site in the vicinity of Saratoga Springs to check for tracks after receiving information that other vehicles might have been in the area. They found one vehicle leaving the site and subsequently made two arrests for possession of weapons, methamphetamines and methamphetamine manufacturing equipment. A pickup truck has also been impounded. (Ed Rothfuss, Superintendent, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 6/18).\n\nWednesday, July 11, 1990\n\n90-189 - Death Valley (California) - Fatality\n\nV.L.C., 23, of Long Beach, California, was riding with a companion on an ATV near Ibex Dunes on July 4th when the vehicle broke down. Her companion walked out for help. V.L.C. eventually walked away from the ATV. Temperatures in the location at the time were around 118 degrees. Initial reports suggested that the incident had occurred on BLM land, so BLM rangers and San Bernadino deputies conducted a search and found V.L.C.'s body on the 5th. The cause of death was ruled to be exposure. Both V.L.C. and her companion had been drinking heavily before the incident took place. (Telephone report from Carl Christensen, RAD/WRO, 7/10).\n\nThursday, July 19, 1990\n\n90-199 - Death Valley (California) - Violent Storm\n\nA lightning storm on the 17th which was accompanied by extremely high winds deposited over one inch of rain on the south central area of Death Valley. This area includes the headquarters and housing area for the monument. The storm began around midnight and continued throughout the night, causing all road into the area to be closed except Highway 190 to Las Vegas. All commercial electrical power and most telephones were shut down. The entire roof was blown off the carpenter shop and two smaller out buildings as well as several heme windows and motor vehicle windows. Park rangers conducted a technical rescue of two German nationals and one Swiss national who became marooned on an extreme exposure during the height of the storm. Most of the park's roads were to be reopened by mid-afternoon on the 17th, but it is uncertain when electrical power will resume. (Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 7/17).\n\nTuesday, July 31, 1990\n\n90-207 - Death Valley (California) - Aircraft Accident with Fatalities\n\nTwo Air Force F-4 Phantoms collided in mid-air over the park on the morning of the 26th, then crashed in the park. Two airmen were confirmed dead, and two others sustained minor injuries. The aircraft, neither of which was armed, were operating out of George Air Force Ease. Park personnel secured the crash site for the Air Force. (Telephone report from Carl Christensen, RAD/WRO, 7/26).\n\nTuesday, August 21, 1990\n\n90-263 - Death Valley (California) - Severe Storms\n\nA severe afternoon thunderstorm on August 14th damaged public roads in the park and may have contributed to the crash of a military aircraft. Heavy rains accompanied by high winds hit locations throughout the area, and the park staff, Caltrans road crews and Inyo County sheriffs were kept busy responding to motor vehicle accidents, assessing storm damage and barricading roads. At the height of the storm, a military aircraft crashed at the 7,000-foot elevation on Hunter Mountain near the park's western boundary. Both crewmen ejected safely, but the crash started a 120-acre wildland fire which required the efforts of crews from several agencies to suppress. Maintenance crews found from four to five feet of debris over the road to Scotty's Castle. The thunderstorm was the third roaddamaging storm to hit the park in the past four weeks, and forced the park to make the following closures:\n\nClosed until September 1st: Park Route #1 leading south from Badwater parking area through Jubilee Pass to California State Highway 178 and Shoshone, California. Badwater parking area can still be reached by driving Park Route #1 south from Furnace Creek via State Highway 190.\n\nClosed until September 15th: Wildrose Road leading from Wildrose Ranger Station southwest to Panamint Valley Road (California State Highway 178). The park may still be entered from the west via State Highway 190 through Towne Pass.\n\nClosed until September 30th: Titus Canyon, Westside Road, Desolation Canyon, Natural Bridge, Salt Creek and Sand Dunes parking area.\n\nVisitors are advised to call ahead to park headquarters (619-786-2331) before coming to the park, at least until the monsoon season ends. (Ed Rothfuss, Superintendent, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 8/20).\n\nFriday, January 25, 1991\n\n90-117 - Death Valley (California) - Followup on Drug Lab Arrests\n\nThe trial of the eight defendants who were arrested after the discovery of a working methamphetamine laboratory at the south end of the park on May 27, 1991 concluded in December. Following a two-week trial and a day and a half of deliberation, the jury found six of the men R.B., D.S., C.R., F.P., M.H. and A.C. guilty on all charges contained in the five-part indictment, including conspiracy to manufacture and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. The United States is asking for minimum sentences of from 40 years to life without parole. Sentencing will occur sometime in February. The remaining two defendants, who served as key government witnesses, will be charged later in state court for lesser crimes stemming from this case. Assistant United States Attorney Melinda Haag of Los Angeles prosecuted the case. [Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 1/23]\n\nWednesday, April 3, 1991\n\n91-89 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nPark personnel traveling to a meeting on the morning of March 25th discovered a wrecked car which had gone off a curve at the bottom of a long grade in Daylight Pass and rolled over several times. The single occupant, C.N., 46, of Sacramento, California, had been partially ejected and killed. An investigation into the accident is being conducted by the California Highway Patrol and the county sheriff's office. [Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via telefax from Carl Christensen, RAD/WRO, 3/26]\n\nTuesday, April 16, 1991\n\n91-110 - Death Valley (California) - Structural Fire\n\nA fire broke out in the old cookhouse employed as an administrative building at Scotty's Castle some time between 3:30 and 4:30 a.m. on the morning of April 13th. An NPS employee who lives nearby first saw the fire around 5:00 a.m. The initial exterior attack was made ten minutes later by an NPS fire truck and crew from Grapevine, which is about four miles from Scotty's Castle. Firefighters employed two inch-and-a-half lines from a hydrant and a two-and-a-half inch line from the truck to knock down the flames; additional assistance was received about an hour later from the NPS and Fred Harvey fire trucks from Furnace Creek. Despite their efforts, the structure and its contents were almost totally destroyed. The estimated loss is placed in excess of $200,000. A complete investigation into the cause of the fire was conducted by an arson investigator from the state fire marshall's office, who concluded that the fire was started by an overheated computer in the maintenance office which had been left on to receive SEAdog messages. Although 30 mph winds caused the fire to threaten Scotty's Castle, there was no damage to that building. There were no injuries to any personnel. The 2,000-square-foot structure, which was built in 1930 and was considered to be an historic building, was used as an office and storage area for the interpretive, maintenance and protection divisions. Although portions are still standing, the structure is considered unsafe and will be demolished. Director Ridenour was in the area at the time, and was flown over the fire. The park had been notified on the 12th that $50,000 had just been approved to upgrade the building's fire and security alarm system, which was old and outdated. [Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Chris Cameron, FMO, RAD/WRO, 4/15]\n\nThursday, July 25, 1991\n\n91-323 - Death Valley (California) - Search in Progress\n\nA major search has been begun for P.H., 41, who is overdue from a roundtrip hike from Badwater Springs to Telescope Peak. P.H.'s car was found along the road by ranger patrols on Sunday, July 21st. The search got underway when investigators learned on the 24th that P.H. was to have arrived in Oregon on July 23rd. Daytime temperatures have approached 120 degrees, with ground temperatures above 180 degrees. Because of the high heat, it has not been possible to utilize dog teams. [Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 7/24]\n\nMonday, July 29, 1991\n\n91-323 - Death Valley (California) - Followup on Search\n\nOn the morning of July 26th, searchers found the body of P.H., 41, a half mile from the Badwater parking area. P.H. had attempted a 20mile hike to Telescope Peak and back. When he failed to return, a major, fiveday search for him had been undertaken in 120 degree weather. The cause of death is not yet known. [Dale Antonich, CR, DEVA, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 7/26]\n\nFriday, April 17, 1992\n\n92-124 - Death Valley (California) - Special Event\n\nThe park is sending four rangers to assist in crowd control at a special event to be held April 25th at Manzanar, the new NPS area recently created to commemorate the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. About 2,500 Japanese-Americans and other visitors are expected at the event. Former Director Bill Mott will be a special guest. Although the Service lacks jurisdiction there at this time, we are providing rangers to support local authorities. [Chris Ward, CR, DEWA, via SEAdog message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 4/16]\n\nMonday, April 27, 1992\n\n92-144 - Death Valley (California) - Drug Seizure\n\nA Special Forces unit working with rangers discovered a bundle of marijuana near a clandestine airstrip just outside the park boundary on April 19th. The bundle, which weighed 1,404 grams and was valued at about $8,000, was not there when the team passed through the area 48 hours earlier. There were fresh tracks on the airstrip and evidence that the plane intended to return in the near future. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, via telefax from Carl Christensen, RAD/WRO, 4/24]\n\nMonday, April 27, 1992\n\n92-145 - Death Valley (California) - Drug Arrest\n\nOn April 17th, R.M., 38, was arrested by rangers for possession of 88 grams of marijuana packaged and ready for sale. R.M. was also charged with transportation of a controlled substance across state lines. The arrest occurred as a result of a traffic stop and search of the vehicle based on information supplied by a confidential informant. R.M., who is from Death Valley, is currently being held on state felony charges in the Inyo County jail. The investigation was initiated by the park and is continuing in cooperation with the local drug task force. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, via telefax from Carl Christensen, RAD/WRO, 4/24]\n\nFriday, May 22, 1992\n\n92-211 - Death Valley (California) - Structural Fire\n\nOn the morning of May 13th, park and Furnace Creek volunteer fire brigades responded to a report of a storage shed fire in the Timbisha Indian village. The wood frame and galvanized metal shed was totally destroyed, but the fire did not extend to a nearby residence. It's believed that children playing with matches caused the fire. The NPS fire brigade has also responded to three vehicle fires in the last two weeks. [DEVA dispatch via cc:Mail message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 5/21]\n\nThursday, May 28, 1992\n\n92-224 - Death Valley (California) - Aircraft Accident\n\nAt 7:50 a.m. on the morning of May 26th, W.E., an incidental pilot from Devils Postpile, was bringing Alden Nash of Sequoia-Kings Canyon to Death Valley to pick up a vehicle when he reportedly attempted a down-wind landing, overshot the end of the runway, and travelled another 180 feet before nosing into the dirt. The plane's right wing was dented, the propeller was damaged, and the landing gear may have been damaged. There were no injuries. OAS and the FAA have been notified; at present, OAS is not investigating the incident. [Mark Maciha/Merna Winters, DEVA, via telefax from Phil Ward, RAD/WRO, 5/27]\n\nWednesday, June 10, 1992\n\n92-255 - Death Valley (California) - Search and Rescue\n\nAround 7:30 p.m. on the evening of June 4th, L.H., 85, a visitor from Germany, wandered away from her tour group near the park airport. A search was begun immediately, and she was found at 8:00 a.m. the following morning at a point about a mile from where she'd last been seen. Herniersdoff was severely dehydrated but otherwise in good condition, and was medevaced by a California Highway Patrol helicopter. The temperature at the time she was reported missing was 102 degrees, with a daily high of 121 degrees. Searchers believe that she would not have survived another day in these conditions. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, via cc:Mail report from Steve Martin, WRO, 6/9]\n\nTuesday, June 30, 1992\n\n92-310 - Death Valley (California) - Earthquake\n\nA quake which registered approximately 6.0 on the Richter scale struck Death Valley at 6:30 a.m. on the morning of June 28th. It is not clear whether this quake was related to the one which occurred beneath Joshua Tree at about the same time. Witnesses reported seeing a long stream of dust along the fault line near the Furnace Creek residential area. The quake caused a twelve-foot surge in Devil's Hole, which dislodged pumping equipment at the surface and knocked it into the hole. No other major damage occurred in the park. [Ed Rothfuss, SUPT, DEVA, 6/29]\n\nTuesday, July 14, 1992\n\n92-342 - Death Valley (California) - Poaching Arrest\n\nOn June 20th, a search and arrest warrant was executed by USFWS special agents on a suspect known to have collected a particular species of butterfly endemic to the park for sale. R.S., 36, of Redwood City, California, was arrested for collecting several hundred of the Papilio indra panamintensis caterpillar from the Wild Rose Canyon in the Panamint Mountains. He then raised them at his home until they grew into the butterfly stage and sold them for $500 per pair. R.S. faces a possible five year prison term and a $20,000 fine for this commercial operation. As a result of this cooperative investigation, which involved both Grand Canyon and Death Valley, other suspects have been identified in Golden Gate, Point Reyes and Yosemite. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, 7/13]\n\nThursday, August 6, 1992\n\n92-398 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nG.W., 66, of Beatty, Nevada, died of head injuries on August 2nd when his dune buggy rolled over near the Beatty Cutoff road and he was ejected from the vehicle. G.W. and his wife were returning from a visit to the park when the accident occurred. Although park medics applied advanced life support measures, G.W. died at the scene from severe head injuries. His wife, P.W., suffered a possible skull fracture and fractures of the left femur and both wrists. She was evacuated by a Flight For Life aircraft. It's not known whether either of the W.s was wearing a seatbelt. [Mark Maciha, DEVA, 8/3]\n\nThursday, September 3, 1992\n\n92-472 - Death Valley (California) - Search\n\nA vehicle registered to R.S., 38, of Spokane, Washington, was found by rangers along Mud Canyon Road between Beatty and Scotty's Castle on Sunday, August 30th. The vehicle's doors were unlocked, and rangers found $2,100 in travelers' checks and cash in the glove compartment. R.S. has a history of mental instability and reportedly attempted suicide a number of years ago. He'd worked for the Postal Service in the east and reportedly left because he feared violence from his fellow employees. R.S. had gone to Spokane to find work, but had been unsuccessful. The Inyo County sheriff's office is taking the lead in the search. It's currently too hot for search dogs (it was 104 on the 31st - the \"coolest\" it has been in a while), so aircraft and ground trackers are being employed. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, 9/1]\n\nFriday, September 4, 1992\n\n92-472 - Death Valley (California) - Follow-up on Search\n\nThe search for R.S. came to an end on September 2nd with the discovery of his body just off Mud Canyon Road. R.S. was within sight of the road, and appeared to have been dead at least several hours. The cause of death is presently unknown, but temperatures in the area had been over 107 degrees. Contacts with his family revealed additional recent evidence of mental instability. Local SAR teams had assisted in the search, which was coordinated by the Inyo County sheriff's office. [Phil Ward, RCR, RAD/WRO, 9/3]\n\nMonday, April 26, 1993\n\n93-207 - Death Valley (California) - Apparent Suicide\n\nOn April 21st, rangers found the body of B.C., 56, of Columbia, California, in her car. She had apparently committed suicide with a revolver which was found in her vehicle. B.C. had been reported missing by The Tuolumne County sheriff's office; the report also indicated that she was on medication and had suicidal tendencies. The vehicle had been observed in the area for three days, but the body was out of sight of patrolling rangers, who believed that the vehicle had been left there by someone on a hike. The Inyo County sheriff's office is conducting the investigation of the incident. [CRO, DEVA, 4/23]\n\nThursday, June 10, 1993\n\n93-343 - Death Valley (California) - Assist; Drug Seizures and Arrests\n\nOn May 25th, a Cessna 210 crossed the Mexican border and failed to land at Calexico, California, for a Customs inspection. A Customs radar aircraft picked up the plane on a low level course headed for Death Valley. The Inyo County sheriff's office was contacted; they in turn called rangers and asked them to intercept the aircraft once it landed just west of the park boundary to meet a load vehicle. Occupants spotted the Customs aircraft and attempted to flee, but responding sheriff's units stopped and arrested four persons and seized the aircraft and two ground vehicles. The plane was hauling 1,000 pounds of cocaine with an estimated value of $60 million. Two of the four suspects were Mexican nationals and two were from the Los Angeles area. [CRO, DEVA, 6/9]\n\nWednesday, August 18, 1993\n\n93-614 - Death Valley (California) - Fatality\n\nA concession employee reported finding a body in the vicinity of Breakfast Canyon on the morning of August 16th. The employee had gone hiking in the area the night before and had seen a man who was either sleeping or dead. He went back in the morning to confirm his suspicion and found that the man was in fact dead. Investigation determined that the man was P.S., between 50 and 60 years old, from Glendale, California. P.S. was last seen on August 10th, when he disappeared after having had an argument with his wife. P.S. did not appear to have suffered from any significant trauma. The incident is being investigated by the Inyo County sheriff's department. [Mark Maciha, DEVA, 8/16]\n\nThursday, September 2, 1993\n\n93-654 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nAt 7:30 a.m. on the morning of August 23rd, a park interpreter discovered the body of C.L., 28, in the middle of the roadway on the road to Scotty's Castle. C.L. had apparently been involved in a single car accident earlier in the morning and had been ejected from his vehicle. The car was found about 70 feet off the roadway. C.L. was visiting from England and was operating a rental vehicle. The exact cause of death was not known at the time of the report. [Mark Maciha, DEVA, 8/29]\n\nTuesday, October 5, 1993\n\n93-754 - Death Valley (California) - Assault with Deadly Weapon\n\nOn the evening of September 30th, rangers were dispatched to a mutual aid call at Furnace Creek Ranch, a resort on a private inholding, in which three people were injured in a knife fight. The first had a deep laceration to his right arm with arterial bleeding and had lost between a liter and a half and two liters of blood; the second had a puncture wound to the right upper back and a head laceration; the third had a laceration to his head. The first victim was immediately given advanced life support treatment and taken to Las Vegas by a Flight for Life helicopter; the remaining two were taken by ambulance to the hospital. As of October 1st, the first was still in intensive care and the other two were in jail for assault with a deadly weapon. Other arrests are possible. Inyo County is investigating. [CRO, DEVA, 10/4]\n\nWednesday, December 22, 1993\n\n92-342 - Death Valley (California) - Follow-up on Butterfly Poaching\n\nOn December 14th, three people were indicted in federal court in northern California for poaching federally protected butterflies between 1983 and 1992 in Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Death Valley, Point Reyes and Golden Gate. More than 2,200 butterflies, including 210 protected under the Endangered Species Act, were taken for commercial gain over the past nine years. The case was developed after U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents and Grand Canyon rangers and investigators began an investigation last year into poaching of a rare species of butterfly from the park. If convicted, each defendant faces five years federal imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and a term of supervised release. [Carl Christensen, RAD/WRO, 12/21]\n\nThursday, January 13, 1994\n\n94-12 - Death Valley (California) - Sewage Spill\n\nOn January 4th, a sewage treatment facility operated by Fred Harvey, the park concessioner, breached at Furnace Creek. About three acre-feet of effluent spilled out of the lagoon, flowed about a half mile through low vegetation, then spread out onto the salt pan at the bottom of the valley. The spill was stopped within two hours of discovery. A representative from the state water resources board immediately traveled to the site and is writing recommendations to the board which may stipulate both needed repairs and possible penalties. A similar spill occurred in early 1993. The spill was from the third cell of the percolation/evaporation lagoons. [RMO, DEVA, 1/12]\n\nMonday, February 7, 1994\n\n94-49 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nOn the morning of January 31st, H.W., 48, and her husband, Gary, were each driving their Harley-Davidson motorcycles through Jubilee Pass on Highway 178 when Herlinda lost control of her bike in the narrow curves, hit an embankment, was thrown about 20 feet, and landed on her head. Although she was wearing a helmet, she suffered severe injuries. Rangers provided advanced life support measures until a helicopter could transport her to Las Vegas. H.W. subsequently died of her injuries. (Dispatch, DEVA, 2/4]\n\nThursday, February 17, 1994\n\n94-74 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Concession Employee Fatality\n\nJ.M., 53, an employee of Fred Harvey concessions at Death Valley, was killed in a single-car accident on Route 6 some time between 3:00 and 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, February 16th. An investigation into the accident is underway; no further details are available. [David Sandbakken, DEVA, 2/16]\n\nWednesday, March 2, 1994\n\n94-96 - Death Valley (California) - EMS Incident; Life Saved\n\nOn January 13th, rangers responded to a call of a man having a heart attack in the Furnace Creek campground. When they arrived, the found T.B., 71, unconscious, unresponsive and gasping for breath; within seconds, he stopped breathing and arrested. CPR and advanced cardiac life support procedures were begun, including defibrillation, endotracheal intubation, and administration of ACLS drugs and an IV. T.B. heartbeat was restored after ten minutes, but he was still unconscious and not breathing on his own. He was taken by NPS ambulance to the Furnace Creek airport to meet an aircraft from a Las Vegas air medical service. During the hour-long wait, T.B. again went into full arrest, and rangers again restored his pulse. He was flown to a hospital in Las Vegas and was discharged in good condition a week later. An interesting side note is that there were no paramedics on call at the time. All advanced cardiac life support measures were performed by parkmedics and parkmedic-cardiacs who had been through NPS-sponsored training. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, 2/28]\n\nTuesday, April 19, 1994\n\n94-167 - Death Valley (California) - Rescue\n\nDuring the evening of April 1st, rangers received a report that E.G., an instructor for the Athenian School, had been injured in the roadless area of Cottonwood Canyon. They hiked in to E.G.'s location, arriving at 5 a.m. the following morning, and found that he had suffered a crushed ankle. A Flight for Life helicopter transported E.G. to a Las Vegas hospital for surgery on his ankle. [CRO, DEVA, 4/8]\n\nTuesday, April 19, 1994\n\n94-168 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nOn the afternoon of April 8th, two people were killed in a head-on collision on California Highway 190 about eight miles west of Furnace Creek. F.F., 53, and his wife R.F., 51, both of South Orange, New Jersey, were killed upon impact when their 1994 Ford Tempo struck a 1994 Cadillac being driven by M.S., 40, of Semmes, Alabama. M.S., who was the sole occupant of his vehicle, received only minor injuries. All persons involved wore seatbelts. M.S. probably survived because of the deployment of the airbag in his car and the disparity in the relative sizes of the two vehicles. [Ann Titus, PIO, DEVA, 4/11]\n\nTuesday, April 19, 1994\n\n94-169 - Death Valley (California) - Apparent Suicide\n\nA visitor reported finding a car containing a body parked in a side canyon off the Mud Canyon Road on the afternoon of April 8th. Investigating rangers found a vacuum cleaner hose leading from the exhaust pipe into the car's interior. A homemade \"tombstone\" was found on the dashboard bearing the inscription \"D.T., Oxnard, CA, 1950-1994.\" This tentative identification had not yet been confirmed at the time of the report. The victim had been there for some time. [Ann Titus, PIO, DEVA, 4/11]\n\nTuesday, April 26, 1994\n\n94-187 - Death Valley (California) - Fatality\n\nEarly on the morning of April 20th, rangers received a report of a body in the Texas Springs campground. They found the remains of 57-year-old B.C. in a sleeping bag at a camp site some distance from the group of mentally handicapped people with whom he was traveling. Inyo County investigators determined that B.C. had ingested four flowers from the datura plant, which is currently blooming in the park's higher elevations. The plant is toxic and can cause death if consumed in sufficient quantities. [CRO, DEVA, 4/25]\n\nFriday, April 29, 1994\n\n94-196 - Death Valley (California) - ARPA Arrests\n\nWhile conducting overflights of the park as part of Operation Alliance, rangers observed a vehicle parked in a remote area in such a manner that it led them to believe that the operator was attempting to hide it from view. Subsequent investigation on the ground led to contacts with R.B. and W.J., both of Bishop, California, who were engaged in the collection of Native American artifacts. Additional evidence which was found at the scene led to their arrest for ARPA violations. [Mike O'Neal, RLES, RAD/WRO, 4/28]\n\nThursday, June 30, 1994\n\n94-342 - Death Valley (California) - Vehicle Pursuit\n\nRangers attempted to stop a Ford Mustang speeding on the Daylight Pass Road near the Nevada border on the evening of June 24th, but the driver - subsequently identified as J.H., 35, of Trona, California - refused to stop and continued to speed westbound through the park. A license check indicated that the registration was for another vehicle. California Highway Patrol and Inyo and San Bernadino county officers joined the pursuit, which continued for 90 miles and ended up in Trona. Speeds during the pursuit reached 70 mph. When J.H. was taken into custody, he stated that he didn't stop for officers because he did not want his car impounded on the roadside and couldn't pay the towing bill. J.H. also said that he'd watched the pursuit of O.J. Simpson prior to the latter's arrest and that he knew the officers wouldn't run him off the road. J.H. was arrested on driving under the influence and several other federal and state charges related to this and previous driving incidents. [CRO, DEVA, 6/28]\n\nWednesday, August 10, 1994\n\n94-454 - Death Valley (California) - Body Found\n\nOn August 6th, rangers received word that a body had been found at the 10,000-foot elevation on the Telescope Peak trail. The victim, subsequently identified as B.P., 65, of Sherman Oaks, California, was listed as a missing person by Glendale police. He'd been dead about 12 hours. The Inyo County coroner is conducting an autopsy to determine cause of death. [CRO, DEVA, 8/8]\n\nMonday, December 19, 1994\n\n92-342 - California and Arizona Parks - Follow-up on Butterfly Poaching\n\nOn December 14th, R.J.S., of Redwood City and M.L.G. of Santa Rosa pleaded guilty in federal district court to charges of violating the Endangered Species Act and other international wildlife conventions. The two were arrested last year for poaching butterflies between 1983 and 1992 in Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Death Valley, Golden Gate, Point Reyes and a number of wildlife refuges. More than 2,200 butterflies, including 210 protected under the Endangered Species Act, were taken for commercial gain over the period. The case was developed after Fish and Wildlife agents and Grand Canyon rangers and investigators began an investigation two years ago into poaching of a rare species of butterfly from the park. Collectors have paid hundreds of dollars for some of the rarer butterfly species the two men collected, which included the San Bruno elfin, mission blue and Lange's metalmark. This is reportedly the first federal case ever made against butterfly poachers. R.J.S. and M.L.G. could receive fines of up to $250,000 and prison terms of up to five years. [San Francisco Chronicle, 12/16]\n\nFriday, May 5, 1995\n\n95-195 - Death Valley (California) - Pursuit; Drug Arrest\n\nThe Inyo narcotics enforcement team advised rangers on May 2nd that they'd received a tip that a drug shipment would be en route to Bishop, California, from Las Vegas, and would likely pass through the park. The suspect vehicle was spotted by a patrol ranger on the following morning; it was heading northbound at about 80 mph, but accelerated when the ranger turned and began following it. County and state units joined in and lead the pursuit at speeds in excess of 100 mph. The vehicle ran off the road about six miles outside of Beatty and drove cross-country for about 400 feet before coming to a stop. The drive, J.B., was wanted on a no-bail felony warrant for parole violations. A quantity of methamphetamine was seized from the vehicle. [Mark Maciha, Acting CR, DEVA, 5/4]\n\nFriday, May 5, 1995\n\n95-197 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nOn April 23rd, rangers were called to a motor vehicle accident with injuries near the park's east boundary. K.G. of Japan had been ejected from the vehicle and was dead upon arrival. K.O., also of Japan, was treated at the scene for a closed head injury; rangers provided life support until a helicopter could arrive to transport her to Las Vegas. The vehicle's estimated speed when it left the highway was between 70 and 80 mph. [Mark Maciha, Acting CR, DEVA, 5/4]\n\nMonday, May 8, 1995\n\n95-198 - Death Valley (California) - Illegal Special Event\n\nOn April 29th and 30th, participants in the Death Valley 400 Sport Motorcycle ride passed through the park despite lacking a permit for the event. Park staff had informed the promoter, Jerry Counts of Canoga Park, California, of permit requirements, but Counts ignored requests from the park for the application fee, a performance bond, and an accurate map of the event route. Counts contended that the park had neither the authority nor the need to issue a permit for a \"self-guided\" ride for 150 motorcyclists. Rangers developed a monitoring plan to protect sensitive resources and to provide for visitor safety along the route. One motorcyclist crashed, and it took rangers 45 minutes to locate the accident due to the lack of an event map. The rider was taken to a hospital in Lone Pine and treated for a fractured clavicle and multiple rib fractures. Legal action against Counts is pending. [Mark Maciha, DR, South District, DEVA, 4/3]\n\nThursday, July 6, 1995\n\n94-196 - Death Valley (California) - Follow-up on ARPA Arrests\n\nWhile conducting overflights of the park as part of Operation Alliance on April 27, 1994, rangers observed a vehicle parked in a remote area of Mesquite Flat in such a manner that it led them to believe that the operator was attempting to hide it from view. Subsequent investigation on the ground led to contacts with R.B. and W.J., both of Bishop, California, who were in the process of removing a winnowing tray and bowl from a sandy knoll. The two men were charged by the U.S. attorney with misdemeanor ARPA violations. On June 28th, they pleaded guilty to the charges, and were each sentenced to two years' probation, payment of a $2,745 criminal fine, restitution of $500 to the park, prohibition from the park during the probation period, and a small court assessment. [Eric Inman, DEVA]\n\nTuesday, August 1, 1995\n\n95-470 - Death Valley (California) - Structural Fire\n\nOn July 27th, rangers received a report of a mobile home in the Stovepipe Wells concession housing that was fully engulfed in flame. Park and volunteer fire crews at Stovepipe Wells contained the fire to the trailer, which was unoccupied at the time. The fire originated in one of the bedrooms. There had been past reports of electrical problems in the structure. [Mark Maciha, Acting CR, DEVA]\n\nTuesday, August 8, 1995\n\n95-496 - Death Valley (California) - Structural Fire\n\nA fire was reported in a residential trailer in the Furnace Creek Ranch employee housing area at 7:30 a.m. on August 4th. Park and volunteer firefighters were dispatched to the scene and were able to confine the fire to a rear bedroom. The trailer was unoccupied at the time. Since this was the second trailer fire in the park within the last two weeks, a state arson investigator was asked to look into the cause of the fire. He determined that it was started by a failure and short in an electrical outlet. Arson is still suspected in the fire that occurred on July 27th, however, and an investigation by the county sheriff's office is underway. [Mark Maciha, DR, South District, DEVA]\n\nThursday, August 10, 1995\n\n95-508 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Serious Injury\n\nLate on the evening of August 7th, 45-year-old F.T. lost control of his tractor trailer on a curve west of Panamint Springs Resort on CA 190, went off the road, and plunged 200 feet down a slope. A passenger in the cab crawled out and got a ride to Panamint Springs to report the incident. A local fire department responded and called for assistance. Six rangers responded with technical rescue gear and extrication tools. It took about three hours to extricate F.T. from the truck. Rangers started IV fluids and transported F.T. to a waiting helicopter, which took him to a hospital in Las Vegas. He is reported to be in a coma with a cervical spine fracture. [Mark Maciha, DR, South District, DEVA]\n\nThursday, August 10, 1995\n\n95-509 - Death Valley (California) - Heat Stroke; Possible Suicide Attempt\n\nN.A., 54, was found on his back about 50 yards from the Badwater Road near Furnace Creek on August 8th. N.A. was incoherent, but was moving his arms and legs. Rangers and a local deputy brought him to the road and began an IV. N.A. became combative and remained so throughout his transport to Death Valley Junction to meet a medevac helicopter. N.A. is now on a ventilator, and is reported to have a diminished level of consciousness. His vehicle was later found nearby; it contained evidence indicating that this may have been a suicide attempt. Despite the high heat in Death Valley at this time of the year (it reached 122 degrees on the day N.A. was found), there are very few heat stroke cases in the park. [Mark Maciha, DR, South District, DEVA]\n\nMonday, August 28, 1995\n\n92-342 - California and Arizona Parks - Follow-up on Butterfly Poaching\n\nOn August 1st, R.S. of Redwood City, California, and T.K., of Tucson, Arizona, pled guilty to felony violations of the Endangered Species Act before a federal district court judge. R.S. was sentenced to five months in a work-furlough facility, five months in a halfway house, and two years' probation. T.K., considered less culpable, was given three years' probation. Both were also fined $3,000 and their collections were confiscated. A third man, M.G. of Santa Rosa, California, pled guilty to similar charges at an earlier date and was sentenced to three years' probation. The charges against the three men stemmed from nine years of poaching rare butterflies from federal lands, including Golden Gate, Grand Canyon, Point Reyes, Death Valley, Yosemite, and other areas. The conspiracy was uncovered when a Stanford University biologist contacted the Fish and Wildlife Service and advised agents that an employee had been poaching rare butterflies from the Grand Canyon. A search of R.S.'s house revealed more butterflies, as well as correspondence linking the three men and other collectors around the country. FWS special agent John Mendoza was the case agent, and was assisted by numerous NPS criminal investigators and rangers. The investigation spanned a four-year period. While T.K. conceded to the judge that there was no excuse for such illegal activity, he said that the Endangered Species Act was sometimes ambiguous. The judge agreed and directed T.K. to help dispel the confusion by teaching other collectors about the law. [Rod Suarez, CI, GOGA]\n\nTuesday, November 21, 1995\n\n95-741 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Two Fatalities\n\nOn November 15th, a rental car went off the Badwater Road, rolled several times, and ejected the two occupants - both Italian nationals. The car then caught fire and burned. One of the visitors died instantly; the other was found alive by a passerby, but died five minutes later. Park and state highway patrol units arrived about 45 minutes after the accident occurred. The identification of the two occupants has not been confirmed, as neither carried any identification and the fire consumed the contents of the vehicle. [Mark Maciha, DR, South District, DEVA]\n\nWednesday, February 28, 1996\n\n96-83 - Death Valley (California) - Human Remains Found; Possible Suicide\n\nOn February 15th, park visitors reported discovering what appeared to be human remains east of Daylight Pass. Rangers assisted county deputies with recovery of the remains and a .22 caliber pistol. A positive identification has not yet been made, but it appears probably that the victim was a 53-year-old man last seen by his family in Portland, Oregon, in 1989. When the man left his family, he told them that he would not be back. No missing person report was ever filed, and he hasn't been heard from since that time. The man may have had a terminal illness. The Clark County crime lab in Las Vegas is handling the remains. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA]\n\nThursday, March 7, 1996\n\n96-92 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nThe park received a report of a single car, rollover accident on Mud Canyon Road on the evening of March 5th. B.C., 40, the driver and lone occupant, was killed in the accident. B.C. was the son of the park's campground host, who had just come on duty that day. Speed is believed to have been a contributing factor. [Ed Forner, DEVA]\n\nFriday, March 22, 1996\n\n96-111 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nW.B., 55, of Tucson, died of injuries sustained in a single-car rollover near Mud Canyon early on the morning of Friday, March 15th. Bentley was ejected from the vehicle. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA]\n\nFriday, March 29, 1996\n\n96-125 - Death Valley (California) - Search and Rescue\n\nG.V., 32, and her boyfriend, J.W., went on what was to be a day hike in the Desolation Canyon area of the park on March 25th. J.W. employed a 30-foot section of climbing rope to raise and lower G.V. in steep, hazardous, technical climbing areas. The pair climbed up about a thousand feet and covered several miles. They were unable to find a route back to their car, though, and spent the night out, clad only in shorts and t-shirts. They tried again the next day. G.V. made it as far as a steep canyon, then refused to go further. J.W. found his way out and reported the incident to rangers. A three-person park SAR team attempted to reach her at 9 p.m. that evening, but had to turn back due to very high winds, hazardous terrain, and total darkness. The crew of a rescue helicopter from China Lake Naval Weapon Station located G.V. at 7 a.m. on the 26th. She was dehydrated and hypothermic; once warmed and rehydrated, however, she declined to go to a hospital and was released. [Eric Inman, IC, DEVA]\n\nMonday, April 1, 1996\n\n96-128 - Death Valley (California) - Search and Rescue\n\nOn March 28th, F.M. and K.S., both 22-year-old Air Force Academy students, set out on a day hike in the Natural Bridges area. They employed free-climbing techniques to circumvent several dry falls, but an anchor pulled out at one of them and K.S. fell about 15 feet, dislocating his right shoulder and thumb. F.M. free descended to a second 20-foot dry fall, leaving K.S. at the top to return to the trailhead to summon help by cellular phone. Ten park employees assisted in the rescue. K.S. was belayed down the fall, then walked out - with assistance down three rock scrambles - to a waiting ambulance. He was taken to a hospital in Las Vegas. [Theresa Stoia, Acting DR, South District, DEVA]\n\nFriday, May 10, 1996\n\n96-198 - Death Valley (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nJ.C., 56, was killed in a single vehicle rollover accident on SR 190 in the park on May 8th. J.C., a French national, was traveling with her husband and grown son on a sightseeing trip of the United States. The rental vehicle drifted onto the shoulder of the highway; when the driver attempted to bring it back onto the pavement, he overcorrected and the car rolled over. J.C., who was in the back seat and was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected through the car's rear window. [Eric Inman, CI, DEVA]\n\nMonday, August 5, 1996\n\n96-434 - Death Valley (California) - Assault\n\nRangers received a report of an assault with a deadly weapon in a park housing area occupied primarily by Timbisha tribal members on the afternoon of July 27th. An argument had broken out between two individuals which resulted in the victim being struck in the face with a rifle and shot twice. The alleged assailant, R.K., chased the victim back to his residence, but had departed from the area by the time rangers arrived on scene. R.K. has a previous criminal history for assaulting law enforcement officers, and had recently threatened park law enforcement personnel. Information indicated that R.K. had returned to his residence after the assault and was armed. Park personnel established a perimeter and evacuated surrounding homes while waiting for Inyo County deputies to arrive. A tactical unit was requested, but the county advised that they wouldn't be available for six hours. When deputies arrived, the incident was turned over to them due to the nature of the park's jurisdiction. Due to limited resources, they opted to wait R.K. out. R.K. was still at large at the time of the report last Thursday afternoon. [CRO, DEVA]\n\nTuesday, October 8, 1996\n\n96-584 - Death Valley (California) - Bus Accident with Multiple Injuries\n\nRangers responded to a tour bus crash on Highway 190 west of Townes Pass on the afternoon of October 3rd. The initial report indicated that at least four passengers had been seriously hurt. A multi-victim incident response was begun, with the closest units 25 minutes away. Upon arrival, rangers found a 30-passenger tour bus off the road against the side of a mountain. The driver had lost control while descending a nine percent grade. Twenty- two people were injured, two seriously. The cause of the crash is under investigation. The bus has been impounded by the California Highway Patrol. [CRO, DEVA]\n\nFriday, October 25, 1996\n\n96-631 - Death Valley NP (California) - Significant Search in Progress\n\nOn October 21st, an abandoned vehicle was discovered in Anvil Springs Canyon, a remote location in the park. The vehicle had been reported stolen from a rental company in Los Angeles when it was not returned as scheduled on July 26th. At the same time, the four German national who'd rented the vehicle - E.R., 33, C.M., 28, G.W., 10 and M.M., 4 - had been reported as missing. Since their itinerary was unknown, the park had not been notified of their disappearance. A ground search is underway with mounted horse units and rescue teams and SAR groups from several state and federal agencies. Updates will follow as the search continues. [Ann Holeso, PIO, DEVA]\n\nWednesday, October 30, 1996\n\n96-631 - Death Valley NP (California) - Follow-up on Search\n\nDue to the lack of substantial clues, the search for the four missing German nationals which was begun in the park last week was called off on October 26th. The park utilized helicopters, horse and foot patrols in the search, and was assisted in its efforts by BLM, the Forest Service and state and local organizations. At this time, it appears that there's been no foul play. Still missing are E.R., 33, C.M, 28, G.W., 10 and M.M., 4. An investigation into there whereabouts is underway.

No trace of J.L. had been found. J.L. had been traveling with his mother when he left her for a short walk. The search was managed by members of the county sheriff's SAR squad with support from the park and the state. [Eric Inman, Acting CR, DEVA, 3/27]\n\nTuesday, April 22, 1997\n\n97-163 - Death Valley NP (California) - Suicide\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, April 11th, rangers were informed by local residents that they'd found some abandoned personal belongings on a peak in the Daylight Pass area on the west side of the park. Among the items found were an unused airline ticket, several empty blister packs of sleeping pills, partially burned college identification cards, and a watch. A fanny pack and a leather knapsack were also found in the area. Investigators determined that K.P., 24, of Skokie, Illinois, had failed to return from a trip to Las Vegas and had been missing since January 27th. Family members said that he'd been depressed due to a recent job loss. A search was begun on Corkscrew Peak on April 14th, but no sign of K.P. was found. Searchers discovered his body on a nearby unnamed peak the following day. A register entry indicated that K.P. had hiked to the peak on January 27th, the same day he was to fly home. He had taken a taxi from Las Vegas to Death Valley and had made no arrangements to return. Due to the difficulty of the terrain and the fact that the body was in a wilderness area, it took ten park employees over six hours to litter the body out. [Ann Holeso, PIO, DEVA, 4/21]\n\nWednesday, April 23, 1997\n\n97-165 - Death Valley NP (California) - Weapons Arrest\n\nR.L. was arrested in Sunset campground for multiple weapons violations on the evening of April 20th. R.L. had been seen during the day in the vicinity of the visitor center and within a private resort. When approached in the campground by a deputy and a highway patrol officer, he immediately tried to gain access to the cab of his pickup truck despite the officers' orders not to do so. He was arrested at gunpoint and taken into custody. A search of the truck led to the discovery and seizure of a loaded .45 caliber handgun, a loaded .45/.410 derringer wrapped in a towel on the front seat, a shortened 10 gauge double barrel shotgun, a bayonet and a throwing axe. Notes found in the vehicle referred to \"taking them all out.\" R.L. was booked into county jail on state charges, but released the following day. A park investigation is underway. [ACR, DEVA, 4/22]\n\nMonday, April 28, 1997\n\n97-168 - Death Valley NP (California) - Assist; MVA with Fatality\n\nA semi with a dump trailer carrying nine cubic yards of concrete aggregate missed a curve in the road and overturned 10 miles west of the park's boundary around 8 a.m. on April 24th. Rangers responded along with local and state officers and EMS and fire personnel. The driver was ejected from the cab and died at the scene. The cause of the accident is under investigation by state police. [ACR, DEVA, 4/25]\n\nThursday, June 26, 1997\n\n97-295 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Two Airplane Crashes\n\nOn June 20th, a California Air National Guard F-16 crashed into a remote section of the park. The pilot was able to eject before crashing and sustained only minor injuries. The aircraft was found in the park's wilderness. The wreckage will be removed by helicopter. On Sunday, June 22nd, a twin-engine Cessna experienced trouble with both engines over the Saline Valley. The pilot was forced to make an emergency landing on Saline Salt Flat. He then hiked ten miles out of the area. Temperatures exceeded 105 degrees that day. [Ann Holeso, PIO, DEVA]\n\nFriday, July 25, 1997\n\n97-354 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Plane Crash with Three Fatalities\n\nOn the afternoon of July 16th, a 1979 Cessna 182 which had been rented by E.K., a 46-year-old Swiss national, crashed as E.K. attempted to land it up hill on a dirt strip at the Panamint Springs Resort. E.K. was apparently having problems landing; when he attempted to pull up and come around again, the plane stalled and crashed on park property next to the resort. E.K. and his two sons - M., 17, and S., two - were killed. The plane burst into flames on impact, thus making any attempts at a rescue impossible. Shortly after the crash, E.K.'s wife and daughter arrived by car at the resort to meet them. The county sheriff and NTSB are investigating. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, 7/25]\n\nThursday, September 4, 1997\n\n97-531 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Search; Suicide\n\nOn the afternoon of August 26th, ranger Sarah Bondareff came upon an unoccupied vehicle parked along Highway 190 just inside the eastern entrance to the park. The air temperature at the time was approximately 115 degrees. A registration and warrant check revealed that the owner, D.H.B., 58, was under investigation for sexual misconduct with his granddaughter and had been listed as a missing person. He was also reported to be potentially armed. Bondareff secured the vehicle and located possible foot tracks associated with it nearby. A hasty search by an NPS aircraft was fruitless. The Inyo County sheriff's office assumed responsibility for the incident late that night and began a ground search. D.H.B.'s body was found in a ravine about a mile from his car the following evening. He had died from a single gunshot wound to his chest. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 9/3]\n\nWednesday, September 10, 1997\n\n97-545 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Mining Accident with Fatality\n\nOn August 28th, the park received a report that someone had been killed in a mining accident at the Bille mine, located on the east side of the park. Rangers Bondareff and Kodell responded and found that 35-year-old C.H. had been run over by a large mining vehicle known as a mucker, which is similar to a front-end loader. C.H. was evidently driving a dump truck and waiting for the mucker to return. He was in front of the truck and could not be seen by the driver when he returned with a load of borax. Alcohol consumption by C.H. is believed to have been a contributing factor. The investigation is being conducted jointly by the park and county sheriff's office. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, 9/5]\n\nWednesday, October 15, 1997\n\n97-629 - Death Valley NP (CA) - MVA with Fatality\n\nOff-duty California Highway Patrol officer J.S., 46, and his wife, Carolyn, were riding their motorcycle on Highway 190 inside the park on the afternoon of October 12th when winds estimated at 60 to 65 mph caught the small trailer behind the motorcycle and pushed it off the road, causing both S.'s to be thrown into the rocky desert area. J.S. was killed instantly, even though he was wearing a helmet; C.s. sustained a fractured ankle and lacerations to her face. She was released from a Las Vegas hospital the next day. [Chris Ward, CR, DEVA, 10/14]\n\nMonday, November 3, 1997\n\n97-683 - Death Valley NP (CA) - MVA with Fatality\n\nOn October 27th, park archeologist Caven Clark came upon a single vehicle accident on Highway 190 two miles north of Furnace Creek. Responding rangers Brenner, Bondareff and Kodele found that B.S., 53, a Canadian national, had been ejected from the vehicle when it rolled over and had sustained fatal cranial injuries. B.S.'s adult daughter survived and was transported to a hospital in Las Vegas where she was treated and released. An autopsy revealed that B.S.'s blood alcohol content at the time of the accident was .205. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 10/28]\n\nThursday, November 6, 1997\n\n97-687 - Death Valley NP (CA) - EMS Incident; Life Saved\n\nOn October 4th, a 14-year-old visitor from Switzerland went into cardiac arrest while wading in the swimming pool at Stovepipe Wells. CPR was initiated by other visitors. Responding park medic John Anderson and EMTs Sarah Bondareff, Jodi Rods, and Ron Rods continued CPR and were able to establish spontaneous pulse and respirations after approximately 10 minutes. At this time, the patient was found to be in ventricular tachycardia. She was given the appropriate medications and stabilized, then transported by helicopter to Las Vegas. Although the girl has an extensive history of cardiac problems, she fully recovered from this episode. Low blood potassium may have played a role in the episode's onset. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 11/5]\n\nThursday, January 8, 1998\n\n97-776 - Death Valley NP (CA/NV) - Search and Rescue\n\nS.B. of New York City began a 14-mile round trip day hike to Telescope Peak - the highest peak in the park at 11,049 feet - at 9:30 a.m. on the morning of January 4th. The park was notified when he failed to return to the trailhead for a scheduled pickup at 4:30 p.m. Ranger John Anderson began a hasty search for S.B. at 3:40 a.m. on January 5th. Representatives from the California Highway Patrol, Inyo County Sheriff's Office and California Army National Guard soon joined the search. S.B. was located in Jail Canyon below the mountain's snow line just after 10 p.m. that evening by a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) device. Ranger Dave Brenner was first to make voice contact with S.B., who was flown out by helicopter. At his debriefing, S.B. said that he'd attempted to take a shortcut back to the trailhead when he realized he couldn't make the full circuit and get back to the trailhead on time. He was in good medical condition despite being dressed in light clothing and carrying limited food and water. S.B. added that he thought the helicopter ride out was \"neat.\" Ranger Ed Derobertis was the incident commander. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 1/6]\n\nThursday, January 8, 1998\n\n98-08 - Death Valley NP (CA/NV) - MVA with Fatality\n\nG.M.C. of Weldon, California, was ejected from a Jeep Cherokee and killed in the early morning hours of January 1st when the driver, R.C., failed to negotiate a sharp turn. The Jeep went off the road and rolled at least five times. An ambulance crew responded and transported G.M.C. to a medevac helicopter, but she died from her injuries during the flight. Rangers David Brenneer and Beth Meyers collected and marked evidence at the scene for a later California Highway Patrol investigation. Speed and impairment from alcoholic beverages are thought to have been contributing factors. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 1/6]\n\nTuesday, January 13, 1998\n\n97-784 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Assist; Theft and Trespass\n\nOn December 24th, rangers Mark Thompson and Beth Meyers arrested D.B., 47, for theft of government property and trespassing on a government installation. D.B. had employed the park's four-wheel-drive roads to assess Fort Irwin bombing ranges to retrieve scrap metal. The park has worked with the military on the chronic problem of \"scrappers\" like D.B., as they leave litter and occasionally transport unexploded ordnance through the park. They can also cause cancellation of expensive practice bombing runs by the military. D.B. was turned over to the Department of Defense for prosecution. Thompson made a second case against scrappers Teven Taelour, 25, and Tina Adams, 27, on Christmas day. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 1/9]\n\nMonday, January 26, 1998\n\n98-34 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Fatality\n\nOn January 12th, a backpacker found a pack in the Mesquite Flat area which contained a birth certificate, a letter, and credit card receipts from January, 1997. He removed the information from the pack and contacted the park. On January 14th, ranger Ron Rods located the pack and found the partial skeletal remains of a single person nearby. The county coroner has tentatively identified the remains using the identification in the pack. The probable victim was very much a loner according to his daughter. She told rangers that it wasn't unusual to not hear from him for years at a time. The case has been turned over to the Inyo County Sheriff's Office for investigation. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 1/23]\n\nMonday, March 2, 1998\n\n98-56 - Parks Servicewide - Follow-up on El Nino Winter Storm Impacts\n\nReports have been received from two parks that have suffered serious impacts from the storms of the last two months:\n\nDeath Valley NP (CA) - The storms that struck Death Valley in February dropped a year-to-date total of 2.40 inches on the park - considerably more than the average annual rainfall of 1.85 inches. On February 24th, portions of a three-quarter mile section of park Route 8 were undercut and washed away in Emigrant Canyon. The route has been closed to vehicle traffic, and regional assistance has been requested. It's estimated that it may take up to six months to repair and reopen the road to the public. Access to Skidoo and Aguereberry Point will be possible by coming south through Wildrose, but through traffic will not be permitted. On the positive side, the above-average rainfall has produced the most impressive display of wildflowers the park has had since 1973.\n\nReports from other parks that have also been significantly affected by these storms would be appreciated. [Scot McElveen, Acting CR, DEVA, 2/26; Gary Candelaria, Superintendent, PINN, 2/27]\n\nWednesday, March 25, 1998\n\n98-115 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Fee Program Fraud Violations\n\nThe park developed and implemented a program to combat and track fee fraud violations in 1997. Over the course of the year, rangers seized a total of 54 Golden Eagle, five Golden Age and two Golden Access passports which had been fraudulently obtained or used and presented at visitor contact stations. A standard questionnaire and signature form were developed and utilized in each case. In most cases, the person presenting the passport was not cited, but the passport was seized and the visitor was required to either pay the park entrance fee or obtain an appropriate passport. Of the 61 passports seized, 35 were presented by visitors from Germany and 14 by visitors from other European countries. Ten were held by U.S. citizens and the remaining two by Canadians. [Eric Inman, CI/LES, DEVA, 3/23]\n\nMonday, June 1, 1998\n\n98-237 - Death Valley NP (CA/NV) - MVA with Fatality\n\nA Dodge Caravan with six occupants went off Big Pine Road and rolled over around noon on May 24th. D.G., 25, an Indian national working in Woodlands Hills, California, was ejected from the right front passenger seat and was killed. D.G. was the only one of the six occupants who was not wearing a seatbelt; the other five suffered only minor injuries. Speed is believed to have been an important contributory cause. Ranger Ed Derobertis and California Highway Patrol officers investigated the accident. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 5/28]\n\nMonday, June 1, 1998\n\n98-238 - Death Valley NP (CA/NV) - MVA with Fatality\n\nC.G., 49, of Alameda, California, was riding his Honda motorcycle on Highway 190 west of Towne Pass just before 2 p.m. on May 24th when he failed to negotiate a curve and ran off the road. C.G. was thrown off his motorcycle and killed. Rangers Beth Meyers and David Brenner investigated along with California Highway Patrol officers. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 5/28]\n\nTuesday, October 20, 1998\n\n98-677 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Assist; Methamphetamine Drug Lab\n\nThe park's criminal investigator assisted BLM staff in searching a discarded methamphetamine drug lab for evidence on September 11th. The complete lab was found bagged up in seven, 55-gallon plastic trash bags underneath an informational kiosk along Highway 127 near the park's southwestern boundary. This is the fourth dump site found near the park during the past two years. One of the main ingredients for the methamphetamine recipe in this lab was iodine crystals. The criminal investigator obtained important evidence that has proven useful to local agencies in other on-going cases in the area. [Eric Inman, LES/CI, DEVA, 10/19]\n\nWednesday, October 21, 1998\n\n98-682 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Search and Rescue\n\nD.A., 40, and B.G., 43, both of Ann Arbor, Michigan, began a cross-country hike from Dante's View to Telescope Peak at 8 a.m. on October 12th. This cross-country hike would cover a distance of approximately 25 miles if completed; it would begin at an elevation of 5,704 feet, descend down below sea level near Badwater, then ascend to an elevation of 11,049 feet. On the second day into their hike, the two became disoriented while attempting to hike down Dante's View and became stranded in one of the drainages. They advised rangers of their situation via cellular phone at 8:30 a.m. on the 13th. Due to their location, the park asked for assistance from China Lake Naval Air Station. A helicopter was dispatched, and the two men were located and rescued at approximately 2:30 p.m. that day. They were in good condition, but had run out of water. Ranger Ed Derobertis was IC. [Ed Derobertis, PR, and Scot McElveen, Acting CR, DEVA, 10/19]\n\nWednesday, December 2, 1998\n\n98-732 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Drug Lab Dump Site\n\nRangers discovered a significant methamphetamine drug lab dump site inside the park in Amargosa Valley on October 22nd. Numerous items had been buried at the site, including three 55-gallon drums containing liquid and sludge waste, several five-gallon pails containing some type of solvent, stained clothing, and miscellaneous trash. Cleanup costs are estimated at between $5,000 and $10,000. Evidence gathered at the site indicates that the lab \"cook\" occurred from six to nine months ago. A joint investigation is underway with the Inyo County Sheriff's Department. [Eric Inman, CI, DEVA, 11/27]\n\nMonday, January 4, 1999\n\n98-778 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Suicide\n\nOn December 1st, the park received a notice to be on the lookout for L.E. of San Bernadino, who had told his landlord's husband that he intended to kill himself at Mud Canyon inside the park. Attempts to find him proved fruitless. On the morning of December 5th, however, park maintenance worker Kit Oesterling spotted a car matching L.E.'s. Rangers Ron Rods and Bill Fitzpatrick investigated and found L.E.'s body near the park information wayside at Hell's Gate, about five miles east of Mud Canyon. It appears that he died from a single gunshot wound to the head from a .45 caliber handgun. The county sheriff's office and county coroner have assumed responsibility for the case. [Scot McElveen, Acting CR, DEVA, 12/29]\n\nTuesday, January 5, 1999\n\n98-780 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Airplane Crash\n\nA Beechcraft Musketeer piloted by H.U., 67, of Lancaster, California, crashed while taking off from the Furnace Creek airstrip just after 4 p.m. on December 30th. The plane crashed 500 feet off the runway. H.U. and his 29-year-old daughter sustained only minor injuries. They received on-scene care from park staff, then were transported by helicopter to Las Vegas for further treatment. The aircraft was totally destroyed. The FAA and NTSB are investigating, but it's already been determined that H.U. had failed to release the yoke lock before taking off. [Ed Derobertis, Acting ACR, DEVA, 1/4]\n\nFriday, January 15, 1999\n\n99-9 - Death Valley NP (CA) - ARPA Incident; Resource Recovery\n\nOn January 1st, a local newspaper ran an article describing the discovery of a trunk associated with a group of Forty-Niners which had been found in a remote area of the park by J.F., a resident of Pearblossom, California. According to the article, J.F. found the trunk last November while scouting routes for a planned backpacking trip which would retrace routes which might have been taken through the area by Forty-Niners on their way to the California gold fields. J.F. first found a knife and ox shoe, which led him to a more thorough search of the area. He found the trunk wedged into a rock shelter, held in place with rocks and a piece of wood. During this and subsequent trips, J.F. and associates reportedly opened, photographed and inventoried the contents of the trunk, then put it back in its original location. Park chief of resource management Linda Greene contacted J.F. by phone on January 4th. J.F. told her that he'd in fact removed the trunk from the park and taken it to his home. He said he'd done this because he was afraid that pot hunter might find it and take it for economic gain, and because he was concerned about the Park Service's ability to preserve the artifacts. Greene convinced J.F. that it was in his best interest and the best interest of the artifacts for him to turn the trunk and all its contents over to park staff. J.F. and his brother brought the trunk to the park the next day and gave them to Blair Davenport, curator at Furnace Creek. The trunk has been inventoried and placed in storage. Its contents included lace textiles, ceramic and brass containers, a handmade basket, a sighting glass, a pair of children's shoes, a doll, jewelry, books, correspondence, pictures, a canteen, a flintlock pistol with a holster, powder horns, a property manifest, and coins from the late 1700s through 1849. Park staff are currently in the process of making a determination on the authenticity of the trunk and its contents and assessing the accuracy of the location where it was reportedly found. If the trunk and contents are authentic, they evidently belonged to William Robinson of Illinois, a Jayhawker who traveled through Death Valley. Robinson was with a group of Forty-Niners who were seeking a short cut from the Spanish Trail. They began their ill-fated journey on November 11, 1849 at Mount Misery, Utah, separating into groups and eventually arriving in Death Valley in December, 1849. They then continued west in separate groups and arrived in various parts of the Panamint Mountains by January, 1850. According to diaries, folklore, and other accounts, thirst, starvation, and the death of their livestock forced many to leave behind portions of their personal belongings in order to survive the remainder of the trip. The trunk with its contents appear to be associated with Robinson. The handwritten manifest with instructions is dated January 2, 1850. Historical records indicate that Robinson survived his trek out of Death Valley, but that he apparently died from drinking too much cold water when near exhaustion upon reaching Barrel Springs (near present-day Palmdale, California) on January 28, 1850. Removal of the trunk and its contents meet all legal thresholds and definitions found within the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. A final decision on any potential charges against J.F. remains on hold pending the park's authenticity investigation of both the articles and the reported location of the find. [Blair Davenport, Curator, and Scot McElveen, Acting CR, DEVA, 1/12]\n\nTuesday, January 19, 1999\n\n98-786 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Explosives\n\nRanger Dave Brenner responded to a report of shots being fired in the Wildrose campground at 1:30 a.m. on November 18th. A camper told Brenner that two men had detonated some sort of an explosive device near his camp site. Brenner contacted E.M., 25, and S.P., 25, both of Ranchos Palos Verdes, California, and seized several pipe bomb pressure containers, oxidizer, flammable metals, a quantity of premixed explosive compound, and credit card receipts for the explosive materials. Both were required to appear in court, where the magistrate sentenced each of them to three years' probation and fines of $500. [Dave Brenner, PR, and Scot McElveen, Acting CR, DEVA, 1/14]\n\nTuesday, February 9, 1999\n\n99-9 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Follow-up: ARPA Incident\n\nOn January 3rd, park staff were notified that a trunk had been located and recovered from within the park, and that it might be associated with a group of Forty-Niners who had traveled through the region in 1849-50 in an attempt to reach the gold fields in California. Upon recovery of the trunk from the man who found it, park staff asked the Western Archeological and Conservation Center to help determine the authenticity of the trunk and its contents. Conservator Gretchen Voeks, curators from the Smithsonian Institution and other subject-matter specialists evaluated the artifacts and concluded that numerous items in the trunk and materials found on these items date to periods later than 1850, the year cited in a letter found in the trunk. Adhesive samples from three items were tested and found to contain polymers that were first available around 1930. Two photos in the trunk were tintypes, a photographic process that was not developed and patented until 1856. And a manufacturer's mark on one of the two ceramic bowls could not have occurred before 1914. Other inconsistencies in the condition and time frames of the artifacts were also noted. The investigation continues. Since the trunk was reportedly taken from the park, ARPA charges are possible.

L.B. and his passenger, Peter Machin, 53, were able to get out of the plane after it flipped and were not injured. L.B. said that the plane skidded off the runway after he applied the breaks; the plane flipped over when the landing gear hit the dirt at the end of the runway. The accident is being investigated by the NTSB and the FAA. [Scot McElveen, Acting CR, DEVA, 3/9]\n\nFriday, May 7, 1999\n\n99-164 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Truck Fire\n\nOn the evening of May 5th, a patrol ranger spotted a runaway truck and trailer (gross weight, 55,000 pounds) heading down highway 190 into the park. The truck had lost its brakes shortly after crossing a pass at 4,900 feet; as it went by the ranger, who was parked at Emigrant Station, its estimated speed was in excess of 80 mph and it was burning underneath and trailing smoke. Since Stovepipe Wells was nine miles ahead (all downhill) and the area contains campgrounds, a store, gas stations, a housing area, and a restaurant and motel, the ranger made a radio broadcast in the blind hoping to warn anyone close to a radio. He attempted to stay with the truck, but was left behind when the truck's speed passed 90 mph. The truck barely missed a loaded school bus on its downhill run. As the truck approached sea level and lost grade, the driver was able to regain power to his brakes and transmission, allowing him to bring his now flaming rig to a stop in the middle of the road a mile west of Stovepipe Wells. The two right rear tires and axle grease were on fire; although flames were lapping onto the trailer, which was loaded with railroad ties, they hadn't yet reached the truck's fuel tanks. The ranger was joined by another patrol ranger and a third ranger driving one of the park's wildland fire engines. The ranger with the engine put on his structural fire gear, charged his engine and line, and determined that he'd try one quick hit on the fire, then retreat if that didn't work. The other two rangers did not have turnout gear available, so were not able to help; the nearest structural fire engine was 40 miles away at Cow Creek and unable to respond when called due to staffing problems. The ranger successfully knocked the fire down. At the ranger's direction, the driver disconnected the trailer and pulled away - with the tires still on fire - so that the truck's fuel would not be added to the fire. The ranger ran out of water, drove the engine back to Stovepipe, loaded another 200 gallons of water, and returned to the scene to keep the fire from reigniting. Rangers then assisted California Highway Patrol officers in the investigation. No one was hurt or injured; an estimated $150,000 in property was saved. [CRO, DEVA, 5/6]\n\nWednesday, May 12, 1999\n\n99-169 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Aircraft Crash; Rescue\n\nA visitor reported seeing an aircraft crash about a mile and a half northeast of Stovepipe Wells on the afternoon of May 11th. Rangers confirmed the accident, and a multi-divisional rescue operation was put into effect. The injured pilot was trapped in the plane, which had flipped over. He was extricated and advanced life support measures were begun. A medevac helicopter subsequently flew him to an area hospital for treatment. [Bill Blake, CR, DEVA, 5/12]\n\nThursday, May 20, 1999\n\n99-192 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Runaway Trailer; Hazmat Spill\n\nA tractor-trailer rig traveling east bound on State Route 190 lost its brakes coming down a steep grade into the park at noon on May 18th. One of the two trailers being towed, which contained hazardous waste, disconnected from the rig and continued down the hill at a high rate of speed. Two German bicycle tourists were taking a break at the Emigrant rest station when they looked up and saw the trailer heading directly toward them. The trailer storage container separated from the chassis; the chassis raced by them to their left and the storage bin came to rest on their right. The wreckage narrowly missed the historic rock restroom facility. Meanwhile, the driver was able to coast into Stovepipe Wells, where he reported the accident. The California Highway Patrol, CalTrans and the NPS worked together to secure the scene, decontaminate people exposed to the waste, and oversee the cleanup operation. Nobody was injured in the accident. [John Anderson, PR, DEVA, 5/18]\n\nFriday, June 4, 1999\n\n99-231 - Death Valley NP (CA/NV) - Attempted Armed Robbery\n\nA visitor from Turkey reported that two men in dune buggies attempted to take his camera from him somewhere between Scotty's Castle and the town of Big Pine on the afternoon of June 1st. The report was made to county and state officers. The visitor also reported that the two men had aimed an M-16 rifle and a .45 caliber handgun at him as he fled. Rangers, California Highway Patrol officers, and Inyo County deputies responded by air and land. Rangers found vehicle tracks and footprints in the vicinity of Crankshaft Junction which may corroborate the report They followed the vehicle tracks to the point where they left the park, heading toward Fish Lake Valley. The county is leading the investigation. [Scot McElveen, ACR, DEVA, 6/2]\n\nThursday, June 24, 1999\n\n99-297 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Structural Fire; Arson Suspected\n\nA suspected arson fire destroyed the main ranch house at the historic Meyer Ranch, a 40-acre inholding within the park, sometime in early June. On June 13th, visitors to the ranch reported to park rangers that they had found the main structure burned down. Investigators found signs of recent footprints and tire tracks. Rangers and local law enforcement officials are continuing the investigation. The fire from the house burned up a spring drainage and extended approximately a quarter acre onto park lands. The stone cabin was built in the 1930's as part of a \"recreational ranching\" endeavor by the Meyers family, who inherited the property from the Lotus Mine claim. The area gained some notoriety in the late 1960's, as the adjacent Barker Ranch was the site where Charles Manson family members lived and were subsequently arrested. [Tim Stone, MA, DEVA, 6/22]\n\nThursday, August 12, 1999\n\n99-449 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Suicide\n\nOn the morning of August 2nd, California Highway Patrol officers advised that they'd discovered a suicide victim in the park near California Highway 190. A rental vehicle was found parked on the road shoulder at a scenic location overlooking Death Valley. The victim inside was identified as S.G., 24, of Austin, Texas. He had died from a self-inflicted 9mm gunshot wound to his head; a recently purchased 9mm Beretta was located nearby. The county sheriff's office is investigating. [Ed Derobertis, PR, DEVA, 8/3]\n\nMonday, August 16, 1999\n\n99-456 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Assault with Deadly Weapon\n\nOn the night of August 13th, dispatch received a 911 call reporting and assault with a deadly weapon that had occurred in Indian Village. The victim told investigating rangers that her brother had struck her on the head with a rock, and that she was carrying her 20-month-old child when the assault took place. The man, who was reported to be intoxicated, was known to rangers, as he'd been involved in another domestic violence case only two weeks previously. He also had a felony warrant out on him. The supervisor on scene accordingly requested backup from the resident California Highway Patrol officer. When that officer and an Inyo County deputy stationed 60 miles away arrived on scene, a search for the assailant was begun. Ranger John Anderson found and arrested him without incident. [CRO, DEVA, 8/15]\n\nWednesday, August 18, 1999\n\n99-467 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Search for Aircraft\n\nA California Highway Patrol helicopter was assisting the park's search and rescue team in a search for two lost/overdue hikers on the morning of August 13th. Around 10 a.m., the pilot reported via park radio that the aircraft was making an emergency landing 40 miles south of Furnace Creek, but the transmission broke off in mid-call. Repeated efforts to raise the helicopter proved fruitless. An air and ground search for the helicopter was begun. Ranger Hank Kodel found the helicopter and its three occupants a half-hour later. All were okay. The pilot reported that an engine malfunction light had come on, forcing him to land. Once on the ground, they were unable to hit the park repeater with the radio they had, hence the loss of contact. The engine was repaired and the helicopter flew out without further ado. [CRO, DEVA, 8/16]\n\nThursday, August 19, 1999\n\n99-477 - Death Valley NP (CA) - MVA with Four Fatalities, Three Injuries\n\nOn the evening of August 17th, rangers and emergency personnel were dispatched to a single car rollover accident west of Stove Pipe Wells with seven visitors reported to have been ejected from the vehicle. Additional reports indicated all seven visitors had major injuries. Park personnel responded with two ambulances, two structural fire engines, and the park's mass casualty trailer. Also responding was the resident California Highway Patrol (CHP) officer, three units from Lone Pine, California, an ambulance and a crash truck from Beaty, Nevada, and three medevac helicopters from Las Vegas. Rangers arriving on scene found that two of the visitors had died and that the remaining five were seriously injured. Additional rangers and a park medic soon arrived. The injured were treated and prepared for air evacuation. One went into cardiac arrest and required CPR; he subsequently died, as did a fourth person. The seven victims were college students from China. They had been in a small van that went out of control coming down a 14-mile-long grade and rolled several times before coming to rest upside down. CHP has dispatched an accident reconstruction team to the site. There have been two other major accidents in the same general area during the past three months. [CRO, DEVA, 8/18]\n\nFriday, August 20, 1999\n\n99-497 - Death Valley NP (CA) - MVA with Multiple Injuries\n\nOff-duty ranger Bill Archer was driving east from Stovepipe Wells on California Highway 190 on the evening of August 18th when he came upon a two- vehicle accident. Two vans in a six-van caravan had collided; one of the them was on fire and blocking the highway. Archer, an EMT, first checked the burning vehicle to assure there was nobody inside, then provided medical treatment to the injured. The temperature at the time approached 120 degrees in the shade, of which there was none. Two park fire engines, the park ambulance, and patrol rangers responded. The EMS situation was somewhat complex and confusing, as none of the injured spoke English. It first appeared that only three members of the group had been injured. Two were prepared for air evacuation to Las Vegas, the third for ambulance transport. After all EMS personnel had been committed and were on their way to hospitals, another nine visitors complained of neck and back pain and requested aid from a doctor. Since they were all mobile and since no additional EMS staff or ambulances were available, they were given a map with the location of the nearest hospital and advised that they could either drive there themselves or wait two hours and pay for transportation by a commercial ambulance. They elected to drive. The burned-out vehicle was loaded on a flatbed and removed. [CRO, DEVA, 8/19]\n\nWednesday, September 1, 1999\n\n99-524 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Military Aircraft Crash\n\nOn the afternoon of August 30th, China Lake Naval Air Station notified the park that a Marine Harrier jet had gone down in Saline Valley. The pilot ejected, but did not survive. The park employed GPS to determine that the crash site was well within the park's wilderness. The Navy asked for assistance in leading their crash site security team into the remote area. Ranger Bill Archard met and assisted the security details. No further information is currently available. [CRO, DEVA, 8/30-31]\n\nFriday, November 5, 1999\n\n99-657 - Systemwide - Special Event: Millennium 2000\n\nParks throughout the system are making preparations for millennium-related events which will take place on or around New Years Eve. The Morning Report will provide continuing updates on those preparations and on the activities themselves as they occur. Today's initial entry comes from Jerry McCarthy in Pacific West Region:\n\no Mojave NP/Death Valley NP/Joshua Tree NP/Lake Mead NRA (CA/NV) - Staff from the four parks will meet in December to prepare a desert contingency plan. All are expecting heavy visitation, particularly Lake Mead, which will receive spillover from Las Vegas. Plans presently call for having all law enforcement staff on duty for the event.\n\nParks making similar preparations are encouraged to submit short summaries to the Morning Report. [Editor]\n\nFriday, December 3, 1999\n\n99-717 - Death Valley NP (CA) - MVA with Multiple Injuries\n\nOn November 28th, rangers responded to a single-vehicle rollover accident in the Wildrose area. Injured were two children, both of their parents, and an adult friend of the family. The father had a concussion and laceration to the forehead; the mother multiple pelvic fractures, a fractured lumbar vertebra and sacrum; the five-year-old boy a pneumothorax and pulmonary contusion; the six-year-old girl a skull fracture with subdural hematoma, facial fractures and a fractured clavicle; and the friend a rib fracture and pneumothorax. Two Flight for Life helicopters were used to transport the five victims to a trauma center in Las Vegas. All are in stable condition. [John Anderson, EMS Coordinator, DEVA, 12/1]\n\nThursday, December 16, 1999\n\n99-732 - Death Valley NP (CA) - ARPA Case\n\nOn the afternoon of December 11th, rangers employed binoculars and a spotting scope to observe the activities of two men in a known park archeological area. The two men, ages 52 and 72, had numerous artifacts in their possession when they returned to their vehicle. An on-site investigation was conducted the following day by the park archeologist. It included GPS documentation and photographs of the disturbed area. Charges are pending. [Nancy Wizner, ACR, DEVA, 12/12]\n\nThursday, February 24, 2000\n\n00-063 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Multiple Incidents\n\nThe park had three significant incidents over President's Day weekend. On Saturday, the structural fire team responded to a kitchen grease fire in the concession at Scotty's Castle. The fire was suppressed and the damaged grill was removed. A two-car head-on collision on Sunday left five injured. A Flight for Life helicopter flew four people to an area hospital; the fifth was transported by ambulance. Rangers began searching for a lost father and son on Sunday. The two were not well-prepared for camping in the snow. The search effort continued until early Monday, during which another foot of snow fell on the area. The father and son were located with the assistance of a helicopter. Both were dehydrated, but otherwise in good condition. [Nancy Wizner, ACR, DEVA, 2/23]\n\nMonday, March 20, 2000\n\n00-099 - Death Valley NP (CA) - Armed Confrontation; Assault on Rangers/Officers\n\nAn NPS special events team (SET) led by Lake Mead chief ranger Dale Antonich confronted and safely arrested three heavily-armed men (names currently being withheld) just before midnight on March 17th. This action culminated a 16-hour manhunt that started in Nevada and ended in the park after a high-speed chase. During this period, the three men shot at law enforcement officers and rangers from six different agencies and shot down a California Highway Patrol (CHP) helicopter. The incident began when a Nevada Highway Patrol (NHP) officer stopped the trio on U.S. 95 south of Beatty. During the stop, the driver shot at the officer several times, then fled north on the highway. A Nye County deputy tried to stop them in Beatty; they shot at him, then continued west into the park, where they shot five times at a responding CHP officer. Rangers became involved as the suspects fled south toward the Furnace Creek development, where there were an estimated 3,000 visitors. The park aircraft also responded. The vehicle turned off the main highway onto a park tour road. Park, CHP, NHP and Nye County officers and rangers set up roadblocks at both ends of the road, while the park aircraft searched for the men and/or their vehicle. The car was found stuck in a nearby salt pan and the three occupants were seen walking west across Death Valley. They were carrying rifles slung over their shoulders and a large pack. A check of the vehicle led to the discovery of several handguns and rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, anti-government and anti-law enforcement literature, bomb-making manuals, and military operations manuals. One of the men was found to have a criminal history of violence and sex crimes. Since the men were walking west into a wilderness area and away from all roads and visitors, the strategy of confinement and observation was used while additional law enforcement resources were brought in. Some officers remained near the abandoned car and watched the trio with spotting scopes; the park plane continued circling overhead. An Army Black Hawk helicopter which was in the park on an anti-drug mission was employed to drop a group of five protection rangers and three officers, headed by park special agent Eric Inman, in front of fleeing felons. An incident command post was established at the park airport. A CHP helicopter soon arrived and joined the park plane in aerial surveillance. The three men, who by now realized that there were o"
