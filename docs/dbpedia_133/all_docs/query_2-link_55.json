        "text": "From the beginning, there was a basic contradiction in the strange case of Ted Bundy. The moment he stepped into the courtroom in Utah three years ago to answer a charge of kidnapping, those who saw him for the first time agreed with those who had known him for all of his 28 years: There must have been some terrible mistake. Here was a young man who represented the best in America, not its worst. Here was this terrific looking man with light brown Some say that Ted Bundy is the most prolific mass murderer in American history; Bundy claims he is the tragic victim of a tangling web of circumstances. hair and blue eyes, looking rather Kennedyesque, dressed in a beige turtleneck and dark blue blazer, a smile turning the corners of his lean allAmerican face, walking almost jauntily before the judge, but free of any extravagant motion that could lead one to think a swaggering — even dangerous — personality existed beneath that casual, cool exterior.\n\nHe seemed so relaxed in the courtroom, which some onlookers explained was natural for a young man with two years’ experience in law school. He joked with local newsmen that the eight weeks he had been held in jail in Salt Lake City before being released on bail had been a useful experience for one studying the law, that it had given him new insights for improving the criminal justice system. “We can start with the bail‐bond system,” he laughed, engaging in light banter that was warm, friendly and not the least bit defensive.\n\nJust two years earlier, Bundy had been known in his home town of Seattle as “Mr. Up‐and‐Coming Republican.”\n\nThe trial was welcome, the law student had told the reporters. “I want to clear my name. I want it all out in the open. I want it aired.”\n\nWhile the judge and defense attorney and prosecutor huddled in a conversation over a date for the trial, Ted Bundy sat in a chair behind the defense table, calmly concentrating on the open pages of a thick book held in his hand, Solzhenitzyn's “The Gulag Archipelago.”\n\nThat trial was three years ago, and it led to his conviction for the kidnapping of 17‐yearold Carol da Ronch. Now, two jail breaks later, Ted Bundy sits in a maximum‐security cell in Tallahassee, Fla., involved in another trial. In the old Leon County Courthouse, the prosecutor will accuse Ted Bundy of being the masked intruder who last winter slipped into the upstairs rooms of the Chi Omega sorority house on the Florida State University campus, and in a burst of madness used a tree limb to savagely smash the heads of four young women asleep in bed, raping and strangling the life out of two of them, then racing a few blocks to the apartment of an art student and beating her nearly to death before the murderous frenzy was spent.\n\nThe state's case against him in the Tallahassee murders apparently is based on one important piece of evidence of a kind rarely introduced in a court of law. The prosecution's star witness is a forensic odontologist, Dr. Richard R. Souviron of Miami, who has publically stated that he can prove that the bite marks inflicted on one of the dead students were made by the suspect. “No two grains of sand are alike,” the dentist said at a recent seminar of clinic pathologists, “and no two fingerprints are alike. The same is true about teeth.”\n\nA source close to the case claims that the prosecutor will also attempt to inform the jury that the intelligent, amiable defendant seated before them is also a suspect implicated in the sexual murders of at least 18 or perhaps as many as 36 young women across the country; if these accusations are true, he is one of the most prolific mass murderers in the history of the country. Eighteen murders is more than Richard Speck and Charles Manson combined. More than the victims of L.A.'s Hillside Strangler, more than Tampa's Red Light District Strangler, more than the senior‐citizen killer in Georgia, and more than those claimed by the Zebra Killer of San Francisco, the Pied Piper of Tucson, the Texas Tower Sniper, the Boston Strangler and New York's Son of Sam.\n\nThe stereototype of mass killers—with minds bedeviled by tumors or hallucinations is all too familiar to the American public. They were the drifters, the malcontents, the failures and the resenters. Ted Bundy, for all appearances, no way resembled any of them. He had all the personal resources that are prized in America, that guarantee success and respect. He loved children, read poetry, showed courage by chasing down and capturing a purse snatcher on the streets of Seattle, rescued a child from drowning, loved the outdoors, respected his parents, was a college honor student, worked with desperate people at a crisis center and, in the words of one admirer, “Ted could be with any woman he wanted — he was so magnetic!” He wanted to become an attorney or a politician, to do something with his life to help others.\n\n“For God's sake,” exclaimed a man who had known the young Ted Bundy before his world was turned upside down by that first criminal charge in Utah, “he was so well thought of that he was the assistant director of the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Commission the same year all the killings started!” In that office, he wrote a rape‐prevention pamphlet for women.\n\nThere used to be a lot of people, in Seattle and elsewhere, who believed that Theodore Robert Bundy himself was the victim, a bright young man drawn inexorably into a monstrous web of circumstances by a jealous fiancee, and then hounded by conniving police investigators, ambitious prosecutors and lazy journalists, all of whom loved his case and warmed to the idea of piling one charge on top of another, making it bigger and more sensational. Bundy, himself, in an exchange of correspondence with this writer after authorities in Tallahassee prevented a face‐to‐face interview at the jail, vented his anger at a system that he said convicted him in the press before he had the chance to face his accusers and their meager evidence in a courtroom. The man who three years earlier had professed confidence at the chance to clear his name, and lectured his supporters on the soundness of the crimnal justice system, wrote to The New York Times:\n\n“I am sick and tired of publicity, no matter now neat the format or prestigious the pub lication. The articles about me ... all tend to read remarkably alike. I can only marvel at the singular lack of originality among journalists. The didhe‐or‐didn't‐he articles have become tiresome, since there is invariably left the lingering inference: How‐could‐he‐nothave? With the relentlessness of a starfish set upon prying open a clam, The Times moves toward the publication of a story, and all this clam wants is a word or two before dinner time. I have never had the opportunity to address myself fully to all the accusations, inferences, innuendo, rumors and suspicion ad nauseum. What has irked me about the stories written on my case is that anyone with a budge or a bachelor of arts degree is considered an expert on Theodore Bundy and what makes him tick. Prosecutors, policemen, journalists, old girlfriends, friends and family of the ‘victims,’ psychologists, psychiatrists, ex‐roommates, former teachers and defense attorneys have all ventured opinions, observations and assorted drivel about this mysterious creature. I think it's my turn. tam, after all, the ultimate Bundy expert.”\n\nThe first to die was Lynda Ann Healy.\n\nOn the night of Jan. 31, 1974, the slender 21‐year‐old University of Washington student vanished from her rented room in the urban district surrounding the 37,000‐student Seattle campus. Thirteen months later, university forestry students walking near the base of Mount Taylor, in the rugged countryside east of the city, discovered a shallow grave. In it was the jawbone of Miss Healy, along with the bones of two other young women. This discovery had come a few months after two grouse hunters stumbled across the remains of three time‐ravaged corpses among the bright fall foliage of trees along Interstate 90, about 10 miles from the burial sight at Mount Taylor. The discoveries horrified Seattle and the state, where a growing number of women fitting the same general description of age and looks had mysteriously disappeared in the first six months of 1974.\n\nWashington, with a relatively homogeneous population, has a low crime rate, and Seattle is considered one of the nation's safest metropolises. Last year there was not a single report of rape on the U.W. campus and there are few rapes of women hitchhikers.\n\nThere was fear in 1974, how ever, caused by what the press In the city called the “Ted Murders” long before the name of Theodore Bundy ever entered the case. On July 14, 1974, a Sunday, two university students, Janice Ott and Denise Mashind, suddenly vanished about three hours apart while with friends at Lake Sammanish Park, where Frisbee throwers and beer drinkers from the summer session at the university spent weekends. Witnesses later recalled seeing a clean‐shaven young man, whose arm was in a cast held in a sling, approach several young women sunbathing beside the lake at the park, including Miss Maslund, and ask for a helping hand with his small sailing dinghy. According to those witnesses, this stranger spoke with a British or Canadian accent, drove a brown Volkswagen, and called himself “Ted.”\n\nInvestigators noted the resemblance to the disappearance that spring of young women from campuses at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Central Washington State in Ellensburg and Oregon State University, across the state line. There had been a description given of a young man whose brown hair and medium build had resembled that of the Lake Sammanish “Ted” ‐ he had been seen on campus, an arm in a sling having trouble carrying his books and asking for help.\n\nIdentification of six missing women was possible, but little else remained at the gravesite to supply clues to the cause of the deaths and the individual responsible. It was not known if the bodies had been dismembered or if wild animals had carried away the remains. There have never been formal charges of murder in these crimes, according to Capt. J. N. (Nick) Mackie, Seattle homicide investigator, nor is there ever likely to be. The trail was long‐cold by the time the name of Ted Bundy entered the case more than a year after the last of the Seattle murders.\n\nA woman that autumn had telephoned the King County police and said she thought that Ted Bundy might be the “Ted” suspect in the killings. The police added the name to a list of 2,877 suspects in the case. They also did one thing more. A telex message was sent to the police in Utah, saying that Theodore Robert Bundy, a possible suspect in the Seattle murders, was now believed to be residing in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Utah authorities were more than mildly interested in the information. While the Seattle crimes had ended abruptly in midsummer of 1974, by early fall young women were mysteriously disappearing in Salt Lake City and its suburbs. On Oct. 2, a 17year‐old waitress disappeared from her North Salt Lake home and was never found. Two weeks later, Melissa Smith, the 17‐year‐old daughter of the Midvale police chief, vanished while walking to a pizza parlor. Her nude and battered and sexually assaulted body was found nine days later. On Nov. 8, 17‐year‐old Debra Kent left a play at Bountiful High School to pick up a younger brother at a skating rink. She never reached her car in the school parking lot, and was never seen again. In the town of Salem, Laura Aimee, 17, vanished on Nov. 27, and a week later her nude body, with a nylon stocking tied around her neck in the same way one had been used to strangle Melissa Smith, was found dumped in the rough countryside.\n\nThe same night that Debra Kent disappeared from the school parking lot, Carol DaRonch was kidnapped from shopping mall several miles away, in the case that resulted in Bundy's only conviction so far. But it took a year to make the arrest.\n\nAccording to Miss DaRonch, a polite man approached her as she shopped, identified himself as a police officer, and asked her to accompany him to the parking lot on some official pretext. When they got outside, she got in his Volkswagen, and, after they had driven out of the lot, he suddenly slapped handcuffs on one of her wrists. She began screaming and the driver ordered her to keep quiet. Miss DaRonch, crying hysterically, managed to open the car door and leap out, hailing a passing auto as the driver of the Volkswagen sped off into the night.\n\nThe Utah police now seemed to have a living witness. The next day, Miss DaRonch was shown a photograph of Ted Bundy, taken from state driver‐license files. “No,” she said, shaking her head, “that's not the man.” That was one of three times in which witnesses failed to identify Bundy. Nearly a year later, however, she did identify Bundy in a police lineup as her abductor.\n\nHis arrest in Salt Lake City took place in August 1975, in a suburb southwest of the city. A state police officer later testified that he was returning home at 2 A.M. from his shift and noticed a tan Volkswagen parked on a dark side street, lights out, with a man seated behind the wheel. When the trooper pulled his cruiser behind the other car, and flicked his high beams on it, the Volkswagen's engine started and the car sped away. The trooper caught it after a short chase and pulled it over. Inside the car was Ted Bundy, who identified himself as a university law student. What was he doing on this street at this hour? He had been to a late movie, was driving home, felt drowsy, pulled off the highway and fell asleep. What was the name of the movie he saw that night? “The Towering Interno,” Bundy replied.\n\nThe trooper looked at the law student. He was dressed in a black turtleneck, Levis and sneakers. There was something funny about the car. The passenger seat had been removed and placed in the back. The trooper looked inside the glove compartment, stood back up and arrested Bundy on the spot. Inside the compartment were an ice pick, a ski mask, a nylon stocking with eye and mouth holes. And a pair of handcuffs.\n\nNo theater in Salt Lake that night was featuring “The Towering Inferno,” the trooper soon learned. The suspect changed his story. He had really been smoking marijuana in his car, was befuddled and panicked when a strange car suddenly pulled up behind him, and he sped away to ditch the incriminating evidence. The ski mask and nylon stocking were used for skiing, of course. One of the reasons he chose to study in Utah was the great ski areas, and the river‐rafting available on the other side of the massive Wasatch Range. And the handcuffs? Easy — he was a security officer at the university.\n\nTed Bundy that day was charged with fleeing from a police officer. Nothing more. But less than two months later, Oct. 2, 1975, he was picked up and charged with the kidnapping of Carole DaRonch.\n\nBundy's defense lawyer in the kidnapping case called psychologist considered expert in the field of “eyewitness” testimony who stated that such recollections cannot be trusted, especially if the event involves extreme stress and the identification takes place after a lengthy passage of time. Despite the defense testimony, he was sentenced to a prison term of one to 15 years on the charge of kidnapping in the second degree, which many peoplein the state considered uncharacteristically light in view of the case against Bundy they had been reading about in the newspa pers.\n\nCapt. Pete Hayward, coincidentally the brother of the arresting officer, was the man in charge of investigating the rash of murders in Utah. He was asked if Bundy was a suspect in those cases. Hayward said that there was no physical evidence to link Bundy with those crimes, but there was inferential evidence.\n\nThe Utah murders stopped In November, but by the beginning of 1975 young women in the neighboring state of Colorado began disappearing one a month, their sexually abused and beaten bodies later turning up in remote ravines and a mine shaft. As with the seven murders in Seattle, investigations into the four suspected homicides in Utah and the five in Colorado have not yet led to any arrests.\n\nIn November 1975, about 30 police investigators from five Western states met in a Holiday Inn in Aspen, Colo., to discuss the remarkable case of Theodore Bundy. In addition to the brutal sex slayings in Washington and Utah, the suspect was now being linked to the Colorado deaths. A check of his Chevron gasoline credit card showed him buying gas on the same days and in the same communities where three young women had vanished ‐ two of whom have never been seen since. Taking these cases, plus the murders of two other young Colorado women, the police compared the facts with the Utah and Washington slayings and came up with what the group in the motel believed was a convincing track of one killer.\n\nThe prosecutor told the grand jury that he had a witness who could place Theodore Bundy in the ski lodge on the night of the murder. That testimony, plus the Chevron charge record that placed Bundy in Aspen the day of the murder, and the hairs found In his car in Utah, produced a charge of murder in the first degree.\n\n“There are a lot of police egos on the line,” Bundy told a reporter from his cell in Utah. “The issue a long time ago was whether 1 was innocent or guilty. The issue is now: ‘Can we pin it on him?’ “\n\nHe was extradited to Colorado in January 1977. In contrast to his experience in Utah, Ted Bundy became, to some people, a kind of exciting personality in the hip and laidback resort communiuty of square‐foot ceiling panel, a feat made possible by the dramatic loss of weight that had been dismissed by the jailers as just another attempt by the prisoner to get special food privileges.\n\nThis time, he got beyond the mountains before the roadblocks were set up. He headed east by bus to Chicago, went on to Ann Arbor, Mich., where he tried to lose himself in the anonymity of the sprawling University of Michigan campus. For a reason that still remains a mystery, he did not stay there. He left Michigan on another bus, heading south to Atlanta. By the second week in January, he was in Tallahassee, taking a room in an offcampus structure that had been converted into a rooming house. Arriving in town at about the same time was a flyer from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, naming him to the list of its 10 most wanted fugitives, saying he was wanted for questioning “in connection with 36 similartype sexual slayings throughout several Western states.”\n\nHis room was two blocks from fraternity‐sorority row. One of the sorority houses belonged to the Chi Omega chapter, an impressive two‐story structure of glass and stone. Late on the night of Jan. 15, a shadowy figure wearing a ski mask slipped into the rear door of the sorority, carrying a stubby limb of an oak tree, and made his way up the stairs to the second floor, where most of the sorority sisters slept. Less than an hour later, a young woman who had just returned from a late date came screaming down the stairs. “Help! Help!” she screamed, waking up the others in the building and bringing lights winking on in the neighborhood. “For God's sake, help!” the young woman screamed again. “They're all dead.”\n\n“So eager is everyone, both friend and foe, to get a solid handle on my psyche that they will advance all manner of superstitious poppycock,” the prisoner wrote this summer. “The police, for example, have purchased a lot of stock in the theory that my being born out of wedlock holds the key to the mystery ‐ as if everyone who arrives in this world without benefit of married parents automatically qualifies as a psychopathic killer.”\n\nAlmost all studies of the sexual psychopath turn up evidence of an absent father figure during early childhood, or Aspen. He was seen by some skiers, already deeply imbued with less than a respect for local authority, as an attractive, intelligent man who possessed far more competence and dash than his jailers. Bundy insisted on acting as his own lawyer, and he spent the spring flooding the court with a series of motions, which the judge allowed, providing him with the resources to prepare his own defense. He got his own telephone credit card, issued and paid for by the state, to use ostensibly for gathering pertinent information from outside the state. He was provided with law books and had access to the law library. He was allowed to have special health foods when he objected to the routine jail fare. He Joked good‐naturedly with his jailers, who admitted they liked his humor and brightness. They began to take off his manacles and leg irons for court appearances.\n\nOne sunny May morning he escaped.\n\nHe had been led to the law library during a short break in a pretrial hearing. His guard stood at the library door. When the time came to return to the courtroom, the guard could not find his ward. Bundy had jumped 30 feet to the ground from an open window.\n\nThe sheriff was humiliated and the guard was suspended, and the town of Aspen reacted as if Bundy were some sort of modern Robin Hood instead of a suspected mass murderer. A folklore sprang up out of the thin Rocky Mountain air. Young people started wearing T‐shirts with inscriptions like “Ted Bundy is a One‐Night Stand.” A local restaurant offered a “Bundyburger” consisting of nothing more than a plain roll. “Open it and see the meat has fled,” a sign in the restaurant said. Late at night, the young people of Aspen shouted into the frosty air, “Bundy lives ... on a Rocky Mountain high!”\n\nJohn Brown, his defense attorney in Utah, described the escape as an impetuous act. “He was just a middle‐class citizen who went to law school and believed in the system,” he commented at the time. Now, he said, Ted Bundy believed the system was his implacable enemy.\n\nHe was captured after eight days, caught while trying to run a roadblock on a mountain pass. Haggard and hungry, he had hidden in abandoned shacks and chalets on Smuggler Mountain. His jailers were not amused, nor was the judge, embarrassed by the criticism that he had been manipulated by the wily defendant. Some of the privileges were dropped. Bundy was placed in a metal‐plated maximum‐security cell in the jail at Glenwood Springs.\n\nThe pretrial hearings proceeded, and the state failed to win approval to introduce the DaRonch kidnapping as evidence to be used against the defendant. Under the doctrine of similar transaction, a valid legal concept, a prosecutor can link a defendant in one case to another crime only it the second crime bears the “signature” of the first. The “signature” must be identical and not merely resemble it superficially. If, for example, a killer leaves an unmistakable clue at the scene of two crimes, or the same scrawled message, or mutilates the body in an unusual way, these can be considered “signatures.” Though there were similarities in the crimes against women that Bundy had been implicated in circumstantially, no one has yet produced a “signature,” a fact that has left hundreds of lawenforcement people frustrated, and has left Bundy wondering how far some investigators might go, because of their belief in his guilt, to manufacture evidence against him.\n\nAs the summer passed and the mountains filled up again with snow, Bundy filled up the court with new motions, even going to Federal court to complain that he was being kept under inhumane circumstances at the jail, held in isolation in a badly ventilated cell, and given meals so inadequate that he had lost 20 pounds. The mood of the court suggested the authorities would not be manipulated again. The motions were turned down.\n\nAnd on the defendant's request for a change of venue, saying that he could not get a fair trial in Aspen because of the pretrial publicity, the judge transferred the case to Colorado Springs, the home town of the special prosecutor brought into the case, a jurisdiction boasting of the highest number of men sentenced to die in the gas chamber.\n\nThe order came just before Christmas. “My Christmas present from the court,” Bundy told a friend by telephone, “a guaranteed death sentence.”\n\nThe transfer to Colorado Springs was to take place early in January. But on New Year's Eve, as the ski resorts in the area rang with the songs of revelers, Ted Bundy escaped for the second time. He had slipped out of a one a temper, but it is not a violent one. So many of his good qualities have now been turned into evil ones because people think he is guilty. He's very bright, so now that has been turned into ‘evil genius.’ His wit has been turned into an act of cynicism by people repelled at the thought of a so‐called ‘killer’ having a sense of humor. It someone accepts his guilt, then every extraneous piece of information developed about him takes on a negative cast. He's very conscious of not wanting to vegetate, finding himself altered by prison life. He has already undergone a pretty shocking transformation from a Dan Evans Republican to being a fugitive.”\n\nThe constant theme running throughout Bundy's psychiatric testing was a view of women as being more competent than men. According to his psychiatrist at the Utah State Prison: “There were indications of a fairly strong dependency on women, and yet he also has a strong need to be independent. I feel this creates a fairly strong conflict, in that he would like a close relationship with females but is fearful of being hurt by them. There were indications of general anger and, more particularly, well‐masked anger toward women.”\n\nBut this might describe thousands, perhaps millions of males in a society that has been subjected to enormous pressures as the family has disintegrated, and divorce, remarriage, working women, single heads of households and general rootlessness have changed the way children grow up. Just as obviously, these conditions do not predict the disturbed personalities; there are numerous other compensations that can come into play and offset the harmful effects, and for every disturbed child who fits into this category, there are thousands who survive the pressures and lead normal, happy lives. But given the seeds of a problem in a child, then expose him to the confusing mixture of violence and sexual aggression offered by the media, and is the result a growing pool of personalities capable of brutal acts? “The postwar baby‐boom generation is the first generation in the history of the world to grow up with television and the killing‐type shows that were prevalent in the ‘50s and the ‘60s,” Dr. Lunde observed. “Mix in the fact that we have more absent fathers, and the inevitable conclusion is that we have a greater number of a physically abusive parent. There are deeply felt feelings of personal failure and selfhate, though these might be hidden from the world, and strong and repeated fantasies of revenge and power. For reasons that are not easily explained, notions of virility are expresed through violence. “When a man commits a violent crime, it is invariably founded on his unconscious feeling that he must show his mother that he is not insignificant and is able to take revenge upon her for rejecting him,” writes David Abrahamsen, noted authority on murder. “In some way, usually in early childhood, the individual confuses sex with violence.” And in another letter: “My response to inquiries concerning my birth without benefit of married parents is not perfunctory. It's being alive and how I am treated by those close to me that counts, and not the single physical act that resulted in my conception. I have always had a curiosity as to the identity of my biological father, but have never had the time or inclination to indulge that idle curiosity. My parents loved me and raised me, that's what matters, and this reaction of mine is hardly perfunctory. Nor is it necessary to de fuse this issue, since it is not fusable in the first place. There is simply no correlation between persons who are labelled as ‘illegitimate’ and violent behavior. But even if there were, such an explanation would not apply to me, since I have never been a per son capable of violent behavior.”\n\nHe was born in a home for unwed mothers in Burlington, Vt., on Nov. 24, 1946. His mother was a young woman from a proper Philadelphia family who was left pregnant by a returning war veteran who deserted her. But she carried the baby home to her father's house, presumably having to undergo all of the humiliation that entailed. When the boy was 3 years old, she moved across the country to start a new life with him with the help of relatives in Tacoma. By the following year, she married John Bundy, a diminuitive and mild‐mannered North Carolinian who had settled in Washington after the war to work as a cook in an Army hospital. The marriage produced four half‐sisters and brother for Ted.\n\nLouise Bundy is an intelligent and strung woman. The anguish of the last three years has left its mark, however, and she visibly sags when she is asked the hated little ques Lions that she knows are designed to ferret out information that might explain her son to a world horrified by the acts for which he stands accused.\n\n“We had such a good life going for us here,” she said. “If anyone had ever hinted at anything like this happening to us, we'd all laugh. Now the only reason we're still holding our heads up is our faith, our faith in God and Jesus Christ sustains us and always will ; there's just no getting around it.”\n\nThirty miles to the north in Seattle, a handsome woman in her early 30's curls a lithe body in a hotel‐room chair. She, a sometime girlfriend, also loves Ted Bundy and has great faith in him. “I'm an agnostic and I don't belive blindly in causes or people,” she says in a direct fashion that comes from her experience in directing an office in state government. “I know Theodore well. I know how his mind works. His faults are not serious ones, but charming human qualities. He does have boys growing up with the possibility of this kind of disturbance. if we get enough of these elements coming together, does it make for some kind of critical mass? Are these the seeds of a terrible explosion?”\n\nGrowing up in Tacoma, never expressing more than cursory interest in “my biological father,” Ted Bundy in the view of family and friends had a completely normal childhood. But on closer study, it seems equally clear that he was a loner. When the psychiatrist doing the evaluation of him in the Utah prison inquired why he had not broadened his social activities at the junior‐high‐school level, as his friends were doing at that time, he answered that he felt “apprehension toward establishing new relationships,” and that he was “just as secure with the academic life.” He went to parties, engaged in some kissing and petting, but he did not date until his senior year at high school. “He indicated that while in the 12th grade, his 'social deficits were cured,’ he had ‘neutral feelings about girls,’ and he indicated he had no inhibitions or fears but just a lack of motivation toward dating,” the psychiatrist's report stated.\n\nIn college, he “had a longing for a beautiful coed but ‘I didn't have the skill or social acumen to cope with it.’ “ He studied China to “gain a position of authority to improve the relationships between the U.S. and China,” but later changed to urban studies to help change the plight of the poor, he told friends. He met a young woman from a wealthy San Francisco family who was his first “real involvement,” but felt quite insecure in the relationship and said they were “worlds apart.” He dropped out of school to ski, work and, in January 1969, go to live with his mother's sister in Philadelphia and attend Temple University for a semester. There were indica. lions he tried to trace his real father while he was there, but failed. He returned to Washington, worked in a lumber mill, re‐entered the University of Washington, and was gradu ated with honors and a degree in psychology in 1970.\n\nHe was stung by rejections at the law schools where he had applied, and was forced to enter the new School of Law at the University of Puget Sound in his home town, while continuing to live in the university district in Seattle. That winter the “Ted” murders began. He dropped out of school in the spring semester, losing his credits, and entered law school in Utah that fall, but had a difficult adjustment and attended only a few classes, managing to get fairly good grades nonetheless.\n\nThe man in the ski mask who entered the Chi Omega sorority house on the night of Jan. 15 was beside himself with hate, because what took place there that night cannot in any way be described as lust. The four women in upstairs bedrooms were attacked as they slept, a sadistic bludgeoning with an oak club that broke bones and left the two survivors with no memory of what had happened. The two women who died were strangled after being sexually mutilated. There were deep bite marks on the breast of one victim, on the buttocks of another.\n\n“You asked,” Ted Bundy wrote in a letter before breaking off the correspondence, “why 1 didn't get out of town immediately after learning of the Chi Omega murders. Nothing I do can possibly be interpreted innocently, can it? If, on the day after the murders, had picked up and fled Tallahassee, you and everyone else would be asking: Well, if you weren't guilty, why didn't you stick around, you didn't have anything to be afraid of, did you? I didn't have anything to fear. I was not responsible for what happened at Chi Omega, I didn't do it, I wasn't there, so there was no reason for me to suspect that my presence alone would be sufficient to indict me for something I was innocent of. I am discouraged by human nature, yours included, as it applies to my case, because no matter what I say or do at this point, I am damned if I do and damned if !don't.” Ted Bundy did leave town later in the month, and on the night of Feb. 9, using a stolen credit card, he stayed in a Holiday Inn in the small Florida town of Lake City, about 100 miles to the east, according to an indictment against him. The next morning, 12‐year‐old Kimberly Leach, a pretty school girl who looked older than her years, disappeared from school in Lake City. Her sexually abused body was found in a shallow grave near Live Oak in April. Death was caused by a blow to the head, and a grand jury indicted Bundy for murder. The police found the grave after Bundy was apprehended in Pensacola on a traffic violation in February, and samples of leaves and dirt taken from the stolen van he was driving at the time were analyzed and found to point to the location.\n\nBundy had been forced by the trial judge to submit to the making of his teeth impressions, and Dr. Souviron told the pathologists: “They line up perfectly, exactly ‐ it is convincing beyond any discussion whatsoever. I'm not saying that this set of teeth killed anybody. I'm saying that these teeth made those marks.” Whether the evidence will hold up in court will have to be seen. Bundy claims that his case has already been so prejudiced that he cannot possibly receive a fair trial. He elected to defend himself after the court refused his request to be represented by Millard Farmer, director of Team Defense Project Inc., a militant opponent of capital punishment. “Bundy has already been convicted of murder in Florida and sentenced to death,” Mr. Farmer stormed in a telephone interview. “The only reason for the trial is to let him try and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he isn't the murderer, which isn't possible. All the state needs to prove him guilty is to read the indictment in court.”\n\nThere are several questionable decisions made by the authorities in Tallahassee that may have worked to prejudice the case. For instance, the judge ordered that Bundy could not talk with newsmen on grounds that the pretrial publicity would be damaging to his own interests. And yet, Sheriff Ken Katsaris, Bundy's jailer, had Bundy removed from solitary confinement and paraded before television cameras while the sheriff read the formal murder indictment against him.\n\nPerhaps Ted Bundy explains it best himself in a letter to this reporter: “Let's leave the business of proving my innocence up to me, the courts, the juries, and my defense council; and the job of finding me guilty up to the guys with the 5o'clock shadows and the black hats. I have no illusion about convincing you or your readers that I am innocent. Let them think what they will, just as long as they don't creep onto my jury.” ■"
