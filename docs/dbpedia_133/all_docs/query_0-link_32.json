Initially Inspired By the 18th century Chinese novel 狄公案 (dí gōng àn) or Cases Of Judge Dee, which van Gulik translated during his war service.\n\nIt is the 7th century AD, and Tang dynasty China is the greatest power in Asia, if not the world. Peace and good order are maintained throughout the empire by a large, efficient bureaucracy of highly-educated gentleman-scholars. Dee Jen-Djieh begins his career as a District Magistrate, the lowest rung of the provincial government. Over the years, he confronts and solves mysteries ranging from conspiracies against the throne to domestic disputes, with the help of his small staff of assistants:\n\nHoong Liang - An old family retainer who the Judge appoints his sergeant of the tribunal. Most often referred to as \"Sergeant Hoong\".\n\nMa Joong - A former highwayman turned investigator. The uneducated son of a poor fisherman, in addition to his great size and strength he is a master martial artist, holding the \"highest rank in boxing\" (kung-fu, in modern terms). Admires strong-minded young women of common rank.\n\nChiao Tai - Ma Joong's best friend. Another ex-highwayman and fellow investigator, he is a rather mysterious fellow, obviously of gentle if not noble birth, with peculiarly fatal luck in love. He is an ex-soldier who turned outlaw to pursue revenge on a superior officer who betrayed him and his men. However, when he finally catches up with his man, as a recent murder victim, he decides he wasn't worth the killing anyway.\n\nTao Gan - con-man, swindler and gambler who, like his colleagues, turns over a new leaf as a member of Dee's staff.\n\nThe Judge's private life is a peaceful haven from his stressful public duties, shared with his three wives:\n\nThe First Lady is the daughter of Dee's father's best friend, and their marriage was arranged between the two families. The Judge values her for her sophistication, intelligence, and the tact with which she runs his household.\n\nThe Second Lady is not as highborn or well-educated as the First, but she is a handsome woman, at least in her husband's eyes, and possesses the kind of staunch, sensible character he admires.\n\nThe Third Lady is the highly-educated daughter of Dr. Tsao Ho-Hsien, an ambitious scholar, whom Dee met in the course of the investigation described in The Chinese Gold Murders. She was abducted and raped, and then her husband and father both disowned her because she refused to kill herself as dictated by custom. The Judge first hired her as a companion for his ladies, and later married her at the urging of the First Lady.\n\nThe four of them get along famously and while away their evenings with endless, hard-fought games of dominos.\n\nThe Judge himself is an unusually tall, powerfully built man with a long black beard, piercing eyes and considerable presence. Men, especially wrongdoers, find him intimidating, but women, sensing the sensitivity and empathy under the formidable surface, tend to trust and confide in him. Particularly attractive young women in trouble.\n\nJudge Dee believes in the spirit of justice, rather then the letter of the law. His aim is not just to punish the wrongdoer but to reward those who do right, and ameliorate the sufferings of the victims as far as is possible. He often goes out of his way to help somebody only tangentially connected with his cases.\n\nTitles (in reading order):\n\nThe Chinese Gold Murder (1959): Judge Dee sets out to take up his first post and finds a couple of juicy murders and a missing person case waiting for him.\n\nJudge Dee At Work (1967): a collection of short stories including a chronology of the series.
