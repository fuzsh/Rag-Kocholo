The superseding indictment replaces the previous indictment, which only charged him with making threats in interstate communications.\n\nIn addition to the interstate communications charge, the suspect is charged with intentionally attempting to obstruct persons in the enjoyment of their free exercise of religious beliefs through threats of force.\n\nAccording to the superseding indictment, he made numerous telephone calls to an employee of a synagogue in Owings Mills, Maryland, and threatened to kill members of the synagogue’s congregations with firearms, explosives, and by burning the synagogue down.\n\nIf convicted, the maximum sentence is 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to 250,000.\n\nPress Release: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/superseding-indictment-charges-man-making-threats-against-maryland-synagogue\n\nA federal grand jury has indicted a New York man with federal hate crimes including willfully causing bodily injury to five victims because of the victims’ religion and for obstructing the free exercise of religion by attempting to kill during Hanukkah observances at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, New York.\n\nThe indictment alleges that on December 28, 2019, the subject was armed with an 18-inch machete and entered a rabbi’s home—adjacent to the rabbi’s synagogue—where dozens had gathered for Hanukkah. There he slashed and stabbed several of the assembled congregants. At least five victims were hospitalized with severe injuries. It is alleged that he targeted and attacked the congregants because of their religion.\n\nFollowing the attack, he was stopped by members of the New York City Police Department. In the vehicle they saw a machete that appeared to have traces of dried blood on it. After securing warrants, law enforcement searched the subject’s residence and cellphone. The residence contained handwritten journals with several pages of anti-Semitic references, including references to “Adolf Hitler” and “Nazi Culture.” The cellphone contained internet searches for terms such as “Zionist Temples in Staten Island and New Jersey,” “why did Hitler hate the Jews,” and “prominent companies founded by Jews in America.” Also found was a webpage visit on the day of the attack to an article titled, “New York Increases Police Presence in Jewish Neighborhoods After Anti-Semitic Attacks. Here’s What to Know.”\n\nEach count carries a maximum prison term of life.\n\nPress Release: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/orange-county-man-charged-additional-federal-hate-crimes-december-28-2019-machete-attack\n\nTwo men have pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime and other charges in connection with their involvement in a scheme to single out men because of their sexual orientation. The defendants conspired with a third accomplice, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and kidnapping charges in connection with the case in March of 2019.\n\nThe defendants used Grindr, a social media platform, to lure gay men to areas around Dallas for robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, and violent hate crimes. The co-conspirators held the victims at gunpoint against their will, forced a victim to withdraw money from an ATM, sexually assaulted at least one of the victims, and wiped human feces on and urinated on another victim.\n\nDefendant Atkinson will be sentenced in February of 2020. Sentencing for defendant Ceniceros-Deleon is set for April 1, 2020, and the court has not scheduled a sentencing hearing for defendant Henry.\n\nHenry and Ceniceros-Deleon Guilty Plea: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-dallas-men-plead-guilty-hate-crimes-after-using-dating-app-target-gay-men-violent-crimes\n\nAtkinson Guilty Plea: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/dallas-man-pleads-guilty-kidnapping-and-conspiracy-charges-after-targeting-gay-men-violent\n\nGraham Williamson and Louie Revette, of Seminary, Mississippi, were sentenced for a racially motivated crossburning in a predominantly African-American residential area. Williamson was sentenced to 36 months in federal prison. Revette was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for recruiting Williamson, planning, and executing the crossburning.\n\nIn October 2017, the two men built a cross that they set up and lit on fire near the homes of African-American residents in the Keys Hill area of Seminary, Mississippi. Both men admitted to knowing that burning crosses have historically been used to threaten, frighten, and intimidate African-Americans, and that they wanted to make the community members in the neighborhood fearful. The crossburning was mostly directed at a young African-American victim and placed near the victim’s home.\n\nWilliamson Sentencing: https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdms/pr/mississippi-man-sentenced-36-months-crossburning\n\nRevette Sentencing: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/mississippi-man-sentenced-11-years-crossburning\n\nA Colorado man was charged with a federal hate crime for plotting to blow up the Temple Emanuel Synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, the defendant self-identifies as a skinhead and a white supremacist. After visiting Temple Emanuel and observing Jewish congregants, the subject allegedly told undercover FBI agents that he wanted to do something that would tell Jewish people in the community that they are not welcome in Pueblo, and they should leave or they will die. He repeatedly expressed his hatred of Jewish people and support for a racial holy war. He suggested using explosive devices to destroy the Synagogue to “get that place off the map.” He allegedly met with undercover FBI agents posing as fellow white supremacists to develop an attack plan and coordinate how to get explosives.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, Holzer allegedly met with undercover agents who provided him with inactive explosive devices created by the FBI. He planned to set off the explosives early Saturday, November 2.\n\nThe defendant is currently in federal custody and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison if found guilty.\n\nCriminal Complaint Charge: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/southern-colorado-man-charged-federal-hate-crime-plotting-blow-synagogue\n\nTerry Knope and Raylaine Knope have been sentenced to 336 months in federal prison for charges of conspiring to obtain forced labor and a Hate Crime involving a woman with cognitive disabilities.

Jody Lambert was sentenced to 120 months in federal prison in June 2019 for conspiring with family members to violate the federal housing rights of a woman with disabilities.\n\nThe family conspired to obtain unpaid household labor from a woman with a disability through force, threats of force, physical restraint, as well as physical, verbal, and psychological abuse. The victim was locked in a backyard cage and forced to perform housework in exchange for food and water. The family also routinely stole the victim’s federal disability benefits.\n\nTerry Knope Sentencing: https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/pr/louisiana-man-sentenced-violating-civil-rights-woman-disabilities\n\nRaylaine Knope and Bridget Lambert Sentencing: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/louisiana-mother-and-daughter-sentenced-violating-civil-rights-woman-disabilities\n\nJody Lambert Sentencing: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/louisiana-man-sentenced-conspiring-violate-federal-housing-rights-woman-disabilities\n\nWilliam Syring of Arlington, Virginia, has been sentenced to 60 months in federal prison for threatening employees of the Arab American Institute (AAI) because of their race and national origin. Syring also targeted AAI employees because of their efforts to encourage Arab Americans to participate in political and civic life in the United States.\n\nSyring sent over 700 emails to AAI employees from 2012 to 2017, including five death threats. Similarly, in 2008, Syring admitted to sending threatening emails to AAI employees and used language nearly identical to that in his 2017 emails. For over a decade, AAI employees lived in fear that he would follow through with his threats. The threatening messages took a toll on them, their families, and their loved ones.\n\nOn May 9, 2019, Syring was convicted on all 14 counts in the indictment, including seven hate crime charges and seven interstate threats charges.\n\nIndictment: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/virginia-man-indicted-hate-crime-and-threatening-employees-arab-american-institute\n\nConviction: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/virginia-man-convicted-threatening-employees-arab-american-institute\n\nBenjamin Daley, Michael Miselis, and Thomas Gillen, members of the white-supremacist group formerly known as the Rise Above Movement (RAM), were sentenced in court for violence they committed at political rallies as part of their conspiracy to riot.\n\nFrom March 2017 to August 2017, the three men traveled with other RAM members to multiple political rallies and organized demonstrations in Virginia and California where they engaged in planned acts of violence. They attended these rallies intending to provoke physical conflict with counter-protestors, which they believed would justify their use of force and protect them from prosecution. The defendants admitted that their acts of violence during the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally were not in self-defense.\n\nDaley was sentenced to 37 months in prison, Gillen was sentenced to 33 months in prison, and Miselis was sentenced to 27 months in prison. A fourth defendant, Cole Evan White, will be sentenced at a later date. All four defendants previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to riot.\n\nSentencing: https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva/pr/three-members-california-based-white-supremacist-group-sentenced-riots-charges-related\n\nJames Alex Fields, Jr., who participated in a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia, has been sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to hate crimes charges that resulted in the death of a victim, caused bodily injury, and involved an attempt to kill other people after he drove into a group of counter-protestors.\n\nAccording to facts signed by Fields, he attended the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where multiple groups and individuals chanted and expressed white supremacist and anti-Semitic views. After law enforcement told rally participants to leave, he admitted that he drove into downtown Charlottesville where a racially and ethnically diverse crowd had gathered. Fields proceeded to drive into a crowd of counter-protestors because of their actual and perceived race, color, national origin, and religion. He also admitted that prior to the rally he used social media to express and promote white supremacist views; the social and racial policies of Nazi-era Germany; and violence against groups that he perceived to be non-white.\n\nIndictment: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ohio-man-charged-federal-hate-crimes-related-august-2017-rally-charlottesville\n\nGuilty Plea: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ohio-man-pleads-guilty-29-federal-hate-crimes-august-2017-car-attack-rally-charlottesville\n\nSentencing: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ohio-man-sentenced-life-prison-federal-hate-crimes-related-august-2017-car-attack-rally\n\nBenjamin Hernandez, of Eugene, Oregon, was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison and three years’ supervised release for committing a hate crime targeting St. Mary Catholic Church in Eugene in September 2018 and illegally possessing ammunition.\n\nHernandez was escorted from St. Mary Church property on September 9, 2018, following an angry outburst during communion services. Over the following weeks, Hernandez was spotted around the property by security cameras and employees spraying door handles with pepper spray, making threatening gestures towards members of the congregation, and leaving a threatening note coupled with ammunition. As a result, staff and churchgoers were physically injured, frightened, and concerned about their safety.\n\nHernandez was arrested on September 21, 2018, and pleaded guilty on February 12, 2019, to obstruction or attempted obstruction of persons in the free exercise of their religious beliefs and unlawful possession of ammunition.\n\nGuilty Plea: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/oregon-man-pleads-guilty-federal-hate-crime-threatening-shooting-spree-eugene-church\n\nSentencing: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/oregon-man-sentenced-15-months-federal-prison-hate-crime-targeting-eugene-church\n\nA federal grand jury in the Northern District of Ohio charged an Ohio man with three federal charges in connection with his plan to attack a synagogue in the Toledo area.\n\nThe three-count indictment charges the defendant with attempting to provide material support to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), attempting to commit a hate crime, and possessing firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence.\n\nAccording to court documents, the defendant drew law enforcement’s attention in 2018 with social media posts of weapons and messages supportive of ISIS, as well as posting a photograph originally distributed by ISIS. That online activity led to multiple interactions between him and undercover FBI agents, during which the defendant stated his support for violent attacks and operations. For example, he communicated to the undercover agent his admiration for the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that occurred in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in October 2018. Additionally, the defendant discussed conducting a mass shooting at a synagogue with the undercover agent. He identified two synagogues as potential targets, discussed the types of weapons he believed would be able to inflict mass casualties, and stated he wanted to kill a rabbi. He wrote the name and address of the synagogue he selected and showed the undercover agent photos of the inside. He was arrested after he accepted two semi-automatic rifles the undercover agent told him he had purchased for the attack. The weapons were rendered inoperable by law enforcement officers, so they posed no danger to the public.\n\nIndictment: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ohio-man-indicted-attempting-provide-material-support-isis-and-attempting-commit-violent-hate\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright, and Patrick Stein were sentenced to 25, 26, and 30 years, respectively, for conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and to violate the housing rights of their intended victims. Both conspiracies stemmed from the defendants’ plot to blow up an apartment complex in an effort to kill the Somali Muslim immigrants who lived and worshipped there. Prior to the conviction, the FBI conducted an eight-month-long investigation during which they uncovered recordings of the defendants discussing their plan to attack the apartment complex. One undercover FBI agent posed as a black-market arms dealer and met with one of the defendants, who attempted to purchase a bomb from the undercover agent.\n\nSentencing: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-southwest-kansas-men-sentenced-prison-plotting-bomb-somali-immigrants-garden-city"
