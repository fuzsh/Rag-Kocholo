        "text": "Compassion for victim\n\nEditor,\n\nMy heart goes out to the teenager who was first brutally assaulted and is now also suffering reprisal from her peers in Palo Alto. It also makes me wonder if the Palo Alto police aren't up to their old investigative tricks, which wreak havoc with their victims' lives.\n\nI attended Cubberley High School in Palo Alto in the late 1970s. While a sophomore, I began dating a senior who had recently broken up with his girlfriend. The former girlfriend and a friend of hers \"jumped me\" in the parking lot and beat me up. I reported the incident immediately to the school principal. When I realized that the principal was not going to do anything about it, I insisted that he call the police. The girl was arrested for assault and I did press charges. The police then went to the young man in question, and told him (falsely) that I had turned against him and was going to testify against him for dealing drugs. I knew nothing about any drug dealing, nor had I agreed to anything of the kind with the police. Nonetheless, my social life was a living hell from that point on; having been cast in the role of a \"narc\" by reckless Palo Alto policemen. No amount of denial on my part could change this perception, as the police were so convincing. That the testimony never occurred was viewed as chickening out on my part by the teenagers rather than a non-event to begin with.\n\nMy parents urged me to change schools, but I felt that doing so would be an admission of wrongdoing on my part. My anxiety level about attending school because of this ordeal (which continued for years) caused me to cut classes more often than not, and ultimately I only graduated because I had a very compassionate, inventive school counselor who obtained approval for numerous credits to be waived.\n\nI hope this teenage girl's parents and other advocates look closely at what else might be motivating the reprisals from the other kids . . . the police may well be using this opportunity to accomplish their own goals. I would also urge this victim to get out of Palo Alto schools altogether.\n\nSusan Layne\n\nWalnut Circle North\n\nCupertino\n\nSupport Library Commission\n\nEditor,\n\nThe friends of the Palo Alto Library have no position on the solution of closing three libraries as proposed in the recently released Library Master Plan. The Friends were not involved with the plan, except to attend a forum meeting. We believe the plan confirms the need for a Library Commission to address such issues as closing libraries.\n\nThe problem delineated in the report agrees with what the Friends have been saying for many years to staff and council about our libraries and the reason we have urged the creators of a Library Commission to address the issue.\n\nThe council will hear the subject of a \"Library Group\" on May 26. Citizens, library supporters and book lovers will be there to support a \"Library Commission.\"\n\nMary Jean Place\n\nPresident, Friends of the Palo Alto Library\n\nPalo Alto\n\nNo blowers in Palo Alto\n\nEditor,\n\nAn open letter to the City of Palo Alto:\n\nI've had it. I understand that Palo Alto, following the lead of Menlo Park and Los Altos, is considering a ban on gas-powered leaf blowers. In contrast to years past, this year I've had to spend a lot of time at my house in downtown Palo Alto. I'm a tolerant person, but hearing the roaring buzz that begins at 9 a.m. every weekday is simply more than I can stand.\n\nThe type of buzzing noise--a high pitched whine accompanied by a roar--and the sheer decibel level are audible in my house even with all my windows and doors shut. I'm sure I'm not the only one. This is unacceptable noise pollution. I can't have a telephone conversation without people interrupting to say, \"What's that?\" I am woken every morning by the noise. I can't have my windows open to cool down my non-air conditioned house in the hot months. I can't enjoy my porch.\n\nI've done a little observation. Whenever I watch these leaf-blowing commandos, they seem to be aiming the blower at a leaf or two which tumble down a sidewalk. In comparison, we've all laughed at ourselves for the folly of reaching down and moving a piece of string so that the vacuum cleaner can better pick it up. But I've never heard my neighbor's vacuum cleaner. My point is that I don't want to tell lawn workers how to do their jobs, but their seemingly inefficient ways lengthen the amount time the neighborhood has to endure the noise pollution.\n\nFinally, everyone in downtown Palo Alto lives on a postage-stamp sized lawn, so there is a very high concentration of little lawns. This causes the tag-team buzzing effect that plagues our neighborhood all day. I'm not a senior citizen, but what ever happened to the rake? I grew up on an acre of land outside of Chicago, and we raked. I raked. The lawn people raked. Unlike the smattering of leaves here, there were ankle-deep leaves on our lawns that we raked weekly. It didn't take that long, it just took a little more elbow grease, but, hey, we weren't raking concrete, just leaves.\n\nThe gardener opposition to Menlo Park's proposed ban on gas-powered leaf blowers is without merit. This is no race issue. This is noise pollution.\n\nPlease ban gas-powered blowers in Palo Alto.\n\nAlexandra Mayer\n\nHawthorne Avenue\n\nPalo Alto\n\nControl of property\n\nEditor,\n\nElisabeth Traugott's fine article on the politics behind the development of a permanent historic ordinance (March 27) revealed exactly what the City of Palo Alto Planning Division has been attempting to hide from the voters of Palo Alto: the fact that they are writing the law without any input other than that received from the Palo Alto-Stanford Heritage group.\n\nThe dismissal of the historic consultants' input as \"inadequate\" is preposterous and should raise the ire of Palo Alto voters for two reasons. First, we taxpayers have paid dearly for the consultants' input, which was touted to be an important foundation for the permanent ordinance. If the problem with the report was \"misinterpretations . . . and divisive language\" then the consultants should have be ordered to rewrite the report. We should get our money's worth.\n\nThe second reason for voter concern is that the complete suppression of the report from the City Council and the public is a damning admission by the Planning Division that the content of the report was too far away from the Division's predetermined plan for historic regulation. The Planning Division staff appears to be filtering information from the City Council rather than acting as a conduit through which the opinions of the true majority of voters can flow to the council. Every Palo Alto homeowner who votes should be fearful that the control of their property is being handed over to the Planning Division without any real voter input or consent.\n\nMichael Campbell\n\nKingsley Avenue\n\nPalo Alto\n\nDifference of opinion\n\nEditor,\n\nI was interested to read Cheryl O'Connor's review of the Menlo Park restaurant Ariel. My husband and I had dinner there last Tuesday, and both of us considered our dinners the best we had ever had at a restaurant.\n\nI've lived in many different places, traveled and eaten in many fine restaurants, so that is not an idle comparison. The food was exquisitely delicious. First, we had the Ariel salad and it was wonderful--fresh greens, bean sprouts and a wonderful, unusual dressing that we loved. We ate every bite. Next, I had the duck breast, and I thought the combination of confit and potato pancakes was scrumptious. It looked beautiful, too. My husband had Cuban lamb, also delicious. The focaccia was just as described, fresh, light, airy! By the time we had finished all this, I didn't have room for dessert, but my husband opted for a delicious fig brownie with a special, crisp nut brittle--wonderful (I had a tiny bite)!! It's good to know there's a restaurant with such delicious food nearby, that we don't have to drive miles to get to it. It was a delightful experience, and I recommend Ariel highly.\n\nJoyce Sanders\n\nChurchill Avenue\n\nPalo Alto\n\nKeeping common sense\n\nEditor,\n\nI am concerned that this community is taking leave of its common sense regarding so-called historic preservation. Every house in town built before 1948 cannot be a \"landmark,\" and quite a few even in \"Professorville\" are already marginal as dwellings in their current state.\n\nThis morning I witnessed just part of one of many expensive and time consuming procedures imposed upon owners of a relatively modest \"Professorville\" home. Their house has long been classified a \"4\" (of little or no historic merit) and at 95-plus years of age is the victim of considerable functional obsolescence and much deferred maintenance. The owners have employed numerous qualified professionals to design their proposed improvements and given emphasis to preserving the historic exterior appearance of the property. Their proposals have the approval of their neighbors and impose hardship on no one, yet they face continuing official obstruction of their needed improvements based on subjective aesthetic opinions of \"staff\" and the inherently overlong and intrusive approval process we have allowed to develop. The notion of property \"ownership\" is greatly diminished by these constraints, which in essence require us to construct someone else's notion of the ideal rather than just comply with an objective building code.\n\nAfter witnessing the way this system works, I would never consider undertaking a project requiring such approvals myself. Life is much too short. Unfortunately one would suppose many other desirable improvements to local properties will be forgone by their owners as a result of the chilling effect this prospect has on them. The net impact will be a loss of worthwhile investment and property value to the community and some significant hardships for many individuals.\n\nI believe we would all be better served if (1) fewer experts and more property owners were involved in this process, (2) all involved had to live in those areas they issue rulings and opinions upon, and (3) the Historic Resources Board were returned to a purely advisory role.\n\nHall Palmer\n\nHamilton Avenue\n\nPalo Alto\n\nInvestigation needed\n\nEditor,\n\nThe local press has been covering the story of a young Palo Alto girl who was gang-raped at a party after being drugged with alcohol. One of the defendants was not arrested until recently because the father apparently hid him from the police. The families of other defendants have been charged with following and threatening the victim, even after she changed schools. The names of the juveniles involved have not been released, but it appears that Palo Alto is doing an outstanding job of prosecuting the offenders.\n\nNotwithstanding this local effort, this matter cries out for a federal investigation and possible prosecution. The efforts of these young men and their families to intimidate the victim of their crimes are so egregious that every effort must be made to put a stop to their actions, and to do so immediately. Their behavior is an affront to every American citizen who believes in the rule of law.\n\nRobert G. Huenemann, M.S.E.E.\n\nPortola State Park Road\n\nLa Honda\n\nWorking together\n\nEditor,\n\nForming a joint powers authority (JPA) for San Francisquito Creek has benefits beyond the immediate goals of overseeing the ongoing maintenance of the creek and determining long-term flood control and flood warning strategies, because many of the parties in the creek JPA would also need to work together to form a separate JPA for the environmental review of future development on Stanford lands that constitute the largest privately-owned lands in the creek watershed.\n\nDevelopment on Stanford's 8,180 acres is currently reviewed piecemeal by Santa Clara County, San Mateo County, Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Portola Valley, and Woodside, but a creek JPA would enable those jurisdictions to build the confidence needed to create a Stanford land development JPA, and to find the courage to treat Stanford as an applicant subject to the JPA's authority, rather than as a quasi-governmental entity that deserves to be part of the JPA or that has veto power over whether a development JPA is formed.\n\nHerb Borock\n\nByron Street\n\nPalo Alto\n\nUrban sprawl at Stanford\n\nEditor,\n\nStanford wants to expand again? We must carefully view this next step in converting the Farm to urban sprawl with an eye to the near future of the surrounding community. A quarter-of-a-million-square-foot ambulatory care center is labor intensive, requiring hundreds of employees. Thousands of patients per year, along with these workers, will be coming from all over the Bay Area. These two groups will add to the crush of cars as they try to make their way from Highway 101 to Stanford. Pressure to find a quicker route will build dramatically as Embarcadero Road becomes more gridlocked and side streets are filled.\n\nThe Willow Road Expressway will not be built, as Menlo Park has removed that issue from consideration. Widening Palo Alto Avenue has been mentioned but is probably too environmentally sensitive. University Avenue is already gridlocked. The logical choice is to turn Embarcadero Road into an expressway. The road can easily be widened by demolishing only a few houses. Everyone else will lose their front yards, but it will relieve the gridlock. At that point it won't be a choice. But it is a choice now. The Palo Alto community has to examine Stanford's assumption that bigger is better. Which way will we go?\n\nCindy Jacobson\n\nLa Para Avenue\n\nPalo Alto\n\nOrganic protection\n\nEditor,\n\nOnce again, \"silent spring\" has entered my awareness as I remember back to the 1960s when a chorus of birds greeted every new morning. Now, I hear one or two birds. That is all, and that awareness this spring has caused me to get down from the shelf Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and dust it off. (Copyright 1962)\n\nIt was she who set off the alarm that frightened almost everyone except the chemical manufacturers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and it is they who continue to encourage the use of pesticides in our soil and air.\n\nRight now is a crucial time at the USDA. Since organic farmers, consumers and products have become a competitive $3.5 billion threat to agribusiness, the USDA is being pressured to undermine the organic label we have come to depend on for our organic products.\n\nIf the USDA yields to this pressure the integrity of the organic label will be compromised and threatened. Three proposals are being considered as additions to acceptable organic standards:\n\nIrradiation of foods. (We won't know for 10 years the effect of this.)\n\nGenetically engineered organisms.\n\nThe use of municipal sewage sludge containing heavy metals and toxins.\n\nTo have to pay double and more to be assured of healthy foods is bad enough. To lose the dependable high standards of the organic label is intolerable. Under the proposed rule, the use of private seals based on standards higher than or in addition to the national requirements, such as \"pesticide free\" or \"no antibiotics or hormones\" would be prohibited.\n\nIf you want the organic protection from the poisons being placed upon our earth to continue, please write: Eileen Stommers, Rm. 4007-so, Ag Stop 0275, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 29090-6456, or FAX (202) 690-4632.\n\nThis must be done immediately. The deadline is April 30.\n\nLois Crozier-Hogle\n\nOld Page Mill Road\n\nPalo Alto\n\nIt's a simple problem\n\nEditor,\n\nIf you are wondering why you can not sleep between 4:30 a.m. and 6 a.m., blame United, Delta and Continental Airlines. Every day there are four flights that come into San Francisco International Airport from Hawaii during those early morning hours. The route they take is over our homes at very low altitudes. So low we hear the roar--the power the aircraft needs to keep its nose up.\n\nUnited, Delta and Continental Airlines could avoid waking us up. A graphic from the Noise Monitoring Center at the airport shows minimal air traffic in the Bay area during those early hours. They could take a Bay approach or fly at higher altitudes, thereby eliminating the noisy pass over our homes.\n\nUnited, Delta, Continental Airlines; John Martin, manager of San Francisco International Airport; FAA; local politicians: Why can't you correct this one very simple air traffic problem that disturbs so many people?\n\nElizabeth Boudart\n\nHarker Avenue\n\nPalo Alto\n\nAirports and community\n\nEditor,\n\nI stood beside the airplane and cried, out of sight from the little girl and her mother. She was 6 years old, weighed 30 pounds and had an orphan disease that caused her skin to fuse. She wore gauntlets on her hands to keep her fingers from growing together and had an internal feeding device that twice outweighed her. Wearing clothes was a chore and she could not touch anything without pain. There was help for her at Stanford Hospital, but she lived down by Hollister. The Government could pay for her treatment but not her transportation, which the family could not afford.\n\nBut thank God there's an airport there and one at Palo Alto. My friend Carol has an airplane at Oakland, and she flew down to pick us up to take mother and daughter home from the hospital. To help in the unique way we could to keep hope alive, for free. Angel Flight. Small airports all over California. Hundreds of pilots volunteering their time, their light aircraft, their fuel to help those not so fortunate.\n\nLarry, a Karuk Indian from Happy Camp up near the Oregon border was one of the early heart transplants. The transplant brought back his quality of life, but years later, blood wasn't feeding his legs quite right. I was fortunate enough to have a day free to fly up and collect him to bring back to Stanford, and he was fortunate enough to have a runway at Happy Camp I could land on.\n\nThe inner-city kids from Oakland could enjoy a few days in the mountains at Kern Valley last summer because a dozen Angel Flight pilots flew them to a small airport there by the lake and took them home again. The young man with AIDS was one of the few lucky enough to survive 10 years without symptoms as noted in Time Magazine. He, like many others, simply didn't know about AIDS in San Francisco back then. Now he was suffering and obviously couldn't work. He could receive treatment at Oakland, but lived near San Luis Obispo. How to get there? Angel Flight.\n\nAnd so it goes. The mother of the girl with the rare disease asked me how she could ever thank us. \"All we ask,\" I said, \"is that the next time someone complains and wants to close your little airport, stand up, say no, and say why.\"\n\nFor all of us Angel Flight volunteers at airports all over California, that will be thanks enough.\n\nWe encourage you and/or your agency to contact Angel Flight at (310) 390-2958, to receive or offer help. You do not have to be a pilot.\n\nMichal Anne Plume\n\nAngel Flight\n\nPalo Alto Airport"
