There’s a dog for that. Can’t see very well? There’s a dog for that. Searching for a lost hiker in the mountains or survivors in an earthquake, diagnosing illness, comforting the bereft — there are dogs for every need. They are even helping humans track down the causes of cancer. A new study led by Dr. Deborah Knapp, Distinguished Professor of Comparative Oncology, links cigarette smoke exposure to an exponentially higher rate of bladder cancer in Scottish terriers. By assessing individual dogs and studying their medical history, scientists are beginning to untangle the question of who gets cancer and why, and how best to detect, treat and prevent cancer.\n\nRecord Giving Advances College’s Mission and Vision\n\n- Fiscal year 2022-23 was another incredible showing of love and loyalty from alums, clients, and friends of the College of Veterinary Medicine! The third consecutive year of philanthropic support totaling over $20 million proves our mission to advance global animal and human health and well-being through excellence in learning, discovery, and engagement is a meaningful cause to join. We are grateful for our part to carry forth the work of your investment to move the world forward.\n\nIn Support of Inclusive Excellence in Veterinary Medicine\n\n- In another life, Joanne Troutner might have been a veterinarian. But in the early 1970s — when the national average of male enrollment in veterinary schools was 89% — a career in veterinary medicine didn’t seem accessible to her. Now, women in the profession outnumber men, and yet diversity remains an issue, as 90% of today’s veterinarians identify as white. In 2008, the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine established the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion with the purpose of intentionally creating a culture of excellence that supports a diverse and inclusive environment in the college. The creation of the new office reflected the vision of Dr. Willie Reed, who had just been appointed as the college’s new dean a year earlier. “The College of Veterinary Medicine has been engaged in this work for 15 years,” Joanne said. “The programming is phenomenal and it’s having a real impact. It’s necessary work and it needs to continue, which is why I’m proud to support the college’s DEI efforts with a designated gift, given in honor of Dean Reed.”\n\nHonoring Distinguished Alumni and Instructors\n\n- Outstanding faculty and alumni were honored by the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine during multiple ceremonies that featured annual awards and recognition.

That person is Dr. Willie Reed, dean of the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nWelcome New Faculty\n\n- The following faculty members joined the College of Veterinary Medicine’s academic departments in the past year. Please join us in welcoming our newest educators, researchers, and clinicians.\n\nDean’s Global Vision Leads to Expanded Global Engagement for Students\n\n- Of the numerous notable advancements Dean Willie Reed has pioneered for Purdue Veterinary Medicine during his tenure, perhaps the most far-reaching involves global engagement. The establishment of the college’s Global Engagement Office with a full-time director in 2015 was followed by a consequent, soaring increase in global engagement involving both DVM and veterinary nursing students.\n\n$3M Grant Renews Funding for Purdue Program Expanding Access to Veterinary Profession\n\n- The Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine is receiving vital new federal support for an innovative program addressing a national shortage of veterinarians in public health and rural/food animal practice in Indiana and beyond, and a significant lack of underrepresented individuals entering the veterinary profession. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has renewed a five-year, $3.2 million grant to further the success and impact of Vet Up!® The National Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP) Academy for Veterinary Medicine.\n\nDiscovery Points to New Approach to Treating Liver Cancer\n\n- A breakthrough in the understanding of the relationship between a naturally occurring enzyme and the liver cancer drug sorafenib could improve the effectiveness of the drug, which currently prolongs the life of liver cancer patients for only two to three months. A study of the relationship between the enzyme DDX5, liver cancer and sorafenib, published in the Nature journal Cell Death & Disease, points to the potential for a more effective therapy that combines existing anti-cancer drugs with treatments that spur production of this enzyme.\n\nMaking an Impact: Delivering on the Promise of Expanded Hospital Facilities\n\n- The Purdue University Veterinary Hospital has completed its first full year in its expanded facilities and the benefits are significant and far reaching. Here is a small window into the measurable accomplishments that have been achieved in the past year as a result of the capabilities of our advanced facilities, behind-the-scenes efforts, and the dedicated, expert clinicians and staff who work there. Empowered by this team of outstanding personnel, the Veterinary Hospital is contributing to a brighter future for animals and people through advanced, high-quality, compassionate patient care; comprehensive, real-world, hands-on veterinary education; and leading-edge medical discovery involving clinical trials. Together, we are working to achieve global solutions to animal and human health challenges.\n\nAnimal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory Joins Swine Disease Reporting System Network as State Funding Increases\n\n- Diagnostic data from the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine now is being included in the Swine Disease Reporting System (SDRS), which monitors and reports diagnostic data and trends from endemic diseases of the U.S. swine herd. The development comes on the heels of the College of Veterinary Medicine achieving a funding breakthrough for the ADDL during the State of Indiana’s biennial budget process.\n\nA Message from Dean Reed\n\n- Time. We know it’s a precious commodity and we seek to steward and redeem it wisely. Yet, the way time passes so steadily is daunting. I can remember as if it were yesterday my first day on the job as dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine in 2007 — the excitement, optimism, and sense of adventure that came with stepping into such an amazing opportunity. Today, it is hard to imagine that 17 years have passed since then. The emotions now involve a mix of enthusiasm and satisfaction over all our college’s outstanding faculty, staff, and students have accomplished in that time, and the feeling of anticipation related to challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Purdue Veterinary Medicine.\n\nA Lasting Legacy\n\n- It all started as a dream. That’s how the story begins — a story that Dr. Willie Reed, dean of the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine loves to share, especially with students. It’s the story of how he persistently pursued a goal that seemed almost unimaginable as he was growing up in Alabama in the early days of desegregation in the deep south. Years later, he achieved his dream of becoming a veterinarian at Tuskegee University, where he earned his DVM degree. Dr. Reed’s path then took him to Purdue University, initially for graduate study and later for multiple roles that led to his appointment as dean of the veterinary school effective in January 2007. Seventeen years later, the story continues to unfold after a tenure marked by a litany of accomplishments.\n\nPVM Faculty Among Researchers Honored with Purdue Seed for Success Acorn Awards\n\n- Purdue honored more than 100 researchers, including 13 from the College of Veterinary Medicine, with the university’s prestigious Seed for Success Acorn Awards at an awards event last month in the Purdue Memorial Union North Ballroom.
