        "text": "Iain Glen, who played the villain in last year's Tomb Raider, has separated from his actress wife, Susannah Harker, after eight years of marriage.\n\nThe couple, who have one son, decided to go their separate ways in what was described as an \"amicable separation\".\n\nThe future of their marriage became the subject of speculation last year, following rumours about Glen's friendship with Nicole Kidman, after appearing together on stage in the West End in The Blue Room.\n\nGlen, 40, and Harker, 36, first met in 1987 on the set of TV's The Fear and they married in 1992 in a small Presbyterian church in Edinburgh.\n\nParis celebrates director De Palma\n\nUS film director Brian De Palma is to be the guest of honour at a retrospective tribute of all his work in the Pompidou Centre in Paris.\n\nThe collection of 30 feature films and shorts will be shown from 6 February to 4 March, and will include the celebrated films Blow Out, Carrie, The Untouchables and Scarface.\n\nThe 61-year-old, who has been compared to the great director Alfred Hitchcock, will open the retrospective personally and will be present at some of the screenings.\n\nDe Palma's most recent film, Femme Noir - the dark tale of a woman whose past catches up with her - is set in Paris.\n\nBananarama 'plan to reform'\n\nThe 1980s girl group Bananarama plan to regroup, according to newspaper reports.\n\nFounder members Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward will reportedly be joined by Siobhan Fahey, who left the band in 1988 to form the successful band Shakespear's Sister.\n\nBananarama formed in 1981, and went on to have more than 20 hits, including Venus, Really Saying Something and Robert De Niro's Waiting.\n\nTheir singles Love in the First Degree and Cruel Summer were big hits in the US.\n\nEllen 'dropped' by US network\n\nComedian Ellen DeGeneres has seen her latest show axed by US TV network CBS, according to reports.\n\nThe Ellen Show failed to attract a big enough audience for her Friday evening show, Daily Variety reported.\n\nDeGeneres, who famously came out as a lesbian in her last TV incarnation, played a high-powered executive who returns to a quiet life in her home town.\n\nThe show also starred Oscar winner Cloris Leachman, who played DeGeneres' mother.\n\nClint raises cash for charity\n\nUS country singer Clint Black has helped raise $1.5m (£1m) to help victims of a devastating flood in Texas.\n\nHe organised a host of stars, including Lyle Lovett and The Beach Boys, for a telethon across Houston's main TV stations.\n\nA storm last June killed 22 people and caused an estimated $5bn- (£3.5bn) worth of damage.\n\nOrganiser Jacqueline Martin said: \"We're finding out that the people in Houston are incredibly generous.\"\n\nActor Taylor dies\n\nActor-singer Ron Taylor has died at the age of 49, from what is thought to have been a heart attack.\n\nHe created and starred in the hit Broadway musical It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues.\n\nTaylor appeared also on TV shows including Ally McBeal and Twin Peaks, and was the voice of saxophonist Bleeding Gums Murphy on The Simpsons.\n\nHe also appeared in more than 20 films, including Trading Places, A Rage in Harlem and Rush Hour II."
