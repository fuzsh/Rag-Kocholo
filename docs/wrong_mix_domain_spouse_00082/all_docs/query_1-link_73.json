        "text": "A grieving family is urging people to think twice before using their phones behind the wheel.\n\nTom Harker was waiting to turn his horsebox back in to his farm in Sadberge on April 26, 2019, when he was hit by a HGV.\n\nThe 68-year-old well-known traveller was thrown through the windscreen of his vehicle before he was crushed underneath it.\n\nThe driver of the HGV, Jordan Leonard, had been using his mobile banking app while driving on the A66 near Darlington.\n\nHe was so distracted he failed see Mr Harker’s vehicle, and ploughed into the back of him.\n\nTeesside Crown Court heard how he would have had to have gone through three separate authentication methods to access his banking information.\n\nThe 25-year-old, of Minerva Close, Newcastle, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to two years in prison and banned from driving for four years.\n\nMr Harker’s wife, Susan, said her husband’s death had left behind a huge void in her life.\n\nIn a heartbreaking personal victim statement, his wife of more than 40 years said their grandson was the first on the scene and realised that Mr Harker had lost his life.\n\nShe said: \"At that moment my whole world stopped, it literally felt like time had stood still.\n\n\"Tom was my life, we had been together more than 40 years, we lived together, we worked together and did everything together - to find out he had gone was unimaginable.\"\n\nFamily liaison officer, PC Jamie Patel, said: “This incident was devastating for both families and could have been avoided.\n\n“Mr Harker’s family not only lost their beloved husband, father and grandfather, but also their family business.”\n\nThe grieving family is supporting Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit which is taking part in a two-week national campaign.\n\nDrivers are four times more likely to be involved in a collision as you are less likely to notice and react to hazards if distracted.\n\nSmart phones can increase the temptation to make and answer calls but also to select music or respond to social media alerts.\n\nPC Patel added: “Be in no doubt, you can kill someone. Our message is simple – put the phone away while driving.\n\n“Don’t make that ‘quick’ glance the last thing you ever do.”"
