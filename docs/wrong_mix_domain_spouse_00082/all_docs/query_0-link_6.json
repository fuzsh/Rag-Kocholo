        "text": "Mike Leigh has often been accused of condescension towards his characters. Lindsay Posner's perceptive revival of this 1977 landmark reminds us that we are not being invited, unless we so choose, to mock the social aspirations of Leigh's Essex quintet: in reality, the play is a Strindbergian study of marital hell and of a joyless materialism that has since become the defining characteristic of British life.\n\nThere are no grotesques in Posner's production: simply a group of people whose lives are steeped in rancour and sadness. Beverly taunts and sexually humiliates her estate-agent husband, Laurence, while he patronises her for her impracticality and presumed lack of taste in liking Demis Roussos. Meanwhile Tony, the surly ex-footballer whom Beverly sets out to seduce, behaves with thuggish violence towards a wife whose mouth he threatens to seal with Sellotape. And Susan, the middle-class divorcee fleeing her punkish daughter's rumbustious party, suffers a wilting inertia that partly explains her isolation.\n\nWe may laugh at the blatancy of Beverly's vamping tactics, as the excellent Jill Halfpenny, in figure-hugging dress, sways and shimmies in front of Joe Absalom's attentive Tony. But the prevailing note is one of pain, as two marriages unravel before our eyes, and of social recognition, as the characters compare the supermarkets they shop at in the way virtually everyone does today. All the actors, including Andy Nyman as the implicitly racist Laurence, Natalie Casey as the browbeaten Angela and Susannah Harker as the deflated divorcee, avoid comic exaggeration in their search for truth. It's a fine production. Oddly, the play, first seen in 1977 and revived in 2002, always seems to coincide with royal jubilees. Maybe that's more than chance: Leigh's play isn't simply about marriage and Essex, but also about the unhappy state of the realm."
