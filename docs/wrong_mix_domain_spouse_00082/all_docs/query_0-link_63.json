        "text": "Operation Homefront Announces 2024 Semifinalists for Esteemed Military Child of the Year® Award\n\nSAN ANTONIO- Following the nomination of more than 700 outstanding military children from across the country, national nonprofit Operation Homefront is pleased to announce the 105 semifinalists for the 2024 Military Child of the Year® Award program.\n\nOperation Homefront works to build strong, stable, and secure military families and, for 16 years, has celebrated the remarkable achievements, character, and contribution of military children with this distinguished award.\n\nThis program is the nation’s premier tribute to the accomplishments of America’s military children, recognizing the positive influence they have on their families, schools, and communities, despite the unique challenges these young people often face as they serve our nation alongside their parents. The Military Child of the Year® Award serves as a lifelong source of pride for the recipients and offers them unparalleled opportunities to connect with senior military leaders, celebrities, and most importantly, peers who understand the obstacles of growing up within a military family.\n\nFinalists for the 2024 Military Child of the Year® Award will be selected in February by a panel of independent, volunteer judges. The final seven award recipients – one representing each branch of the military – will be announced in March and each will receive $10,000, a laptop computer, and other donated gifts at a gala held in their honor in Washington D.C. in April.\n\nVisit our Military Child of the Year® Awards page to learn more information.\n\nThe following are all the 2024 Military Child of the Year® Award semifinalists by service branch.\n\nAbout Operation Homefront\n\nOperation Homefront is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to build strong, stable, and secure military families so that they can thrive – not simply struggle to get by – in the communities they have worked so hard to protect. Recognized for superior performance by leading independent charity oversight groups, 88 percent of Operation Homefront expenditures go directly to programs that support tens of thousands of military families each year. Operation Homefront provides critical financial assistance, transitional and permanent housing, and family support services to prevent short-term needs from turning into chronic, long-term struggles. Thanks to the generosity of our donors and the support from thousands of volunteers, Operation Homefront proudly serves America’s military families.
