        "text": "Kimber Carl Webb, 84, peacefully passed away on Saturday, January 27, 2024, at his home in Sun City, AZ. He was born June 9, 1939, in Preston, ID, the son of O. Sherwin and Gertrude A. Johnson Webb. He attended school at Preston High School where he was active in athletics, student government, and band. He graduated in 1957. Following graduation, he joined the National Guard and served 6 months active duty at Fort Ord, CA and Fort Chafe, AR followed by 2 ½ years in the National Guard Reserve.\n\nHe attended Utah State University earning a Bachelor of Science degree as a composite major in economics and political science with minors in business and mathematics in 1964. He continued his education at USU by earning a Master of Science degree in econometrics in 1966 which included a master’s thesis on Water Allocation Systems in the Western United States. Following his education, he was employed by Exxon Corporation for the next 28 years with promotions culminating at executive management levels with assignments in New York, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and New Jersey. He retired from Exxon in 1994 and moved to Tucson, AZ.\n\nAs an athlete during his school years, Kimber continued to love sports for the rest of his life, especially tennis and golf. While living in NY, tennis was his main game, but later golf became the more important part of his life. He loved golf, sometimes playing as many as 6-7 rounds per week. He played well (7 handicap) but always wanted to be better. He especially enjoyed the association of his many golf friends and played golf up to the very end of his life.\n\nKimber was an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints serving in many leadership callings wherever he lived, in the US and internationally. In 1969 while living in Venezuela, he was called as a Young Men’s leader. At that time, there were only 8 branches of the Church in the Venezuelan District and there were no materials provided. After struggling for a time, they decided to put on a youth conference duplicating some of their own experiences as youth in the U.S. It was a first-time event for the Church in Venezuela, and afterwards, he learned that some of the youth that attended went on to be valiant Church leaders in Venezuela.\n\nKimber married Donna Lee Brooks on December 6, 1986, in the Washington DC Temple. After her unexpected death on April 8, 2020, he met and married Barbara Ellgen on November 30, 2021, in Sun City, AZ, and they later sealed their marriage in the Phoenix Temple on February 10, 2022. He served a church mission to Arkansas in 1959 – 1961 and served with his wife, Donna, as Senior Missionaries in the Fresno, California Mission from August 2000 to January 2002. Additionally, he served a Church Service Mission with his wife, Barbara, in the Church Employment Center in Glendale, AZ from August 2022 to August 2023.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Barbara Ellgen Webb, of Sun City, AZ; one son, Kevin (Gretchen) Webb, Atlanta, GA; two stepdaughters, six stepsons, 12 grandchildren; three brothers, Douglas S. (Sandra) Webb, Preston, ID; Curtis G. (Kristen) Webb, Elk Ridge, UT; and Bracken J. (Yvonne) Webb, Idaho Falls, ID. He was preceded in death by his wife, Donna Lee Brooks Webb, and his parents, O. Sherwin and Gertie Webb.\n\nFuneral services will be held Wednesday, February 7, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. at Webb Funeral Home in Preston, Idaho. A viewing will be held Wednesday from 9:30-10:30 a.m. also at the funeral home. Interment will be in the Richmond Utah Cemetery.
