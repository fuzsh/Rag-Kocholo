        "text": "\"After amazing feedback in March we were wondering if you might consider doing another session...\" Another lovely email recently - this was an audience that didn't know me at all but they'd heard of the work I do. I talked about Compassionate Leadership, from the perspective of \"Good grief, I'm already working as hard as I can (and close to burnout), please don't tell me that I need to learn about Compassion as well...\" We unpacked the challenge. I showed them how some simple skills to help themselves were actually the first, and most important step. We had a very engaging 90 minutes, of conversation and learning - this is not apple pie in the sky stuff, it's about the very real task of hanging onto your humanity whilst doing one of the toughest jobs in the world. I love working with audiences that are skeptical about compassion. Because I totally get it! And I'd love to show you how these skills can transform your relationship with yourself and your colleagues. Are you ready? #compassionateleadership #burnout #courageousleadership\n\nWhen I'm working with teams, we move towards the difficult stuff, not away from it. True change happens when we have the courageous conversations. Whether I'm coaching you as a leader, or bringing together your team to overcome conflicts, challenges or enhance productivity, you'll find that we get straight to the heart of it. You don't need platitudes. You need the right support to move forward courageously. Sometimes it's raw. Psychological safety is important. We're all humans who struggle, and fail at times. If you're ready, DM me for a conversation about how I can help you and your teams. #compassionateleadership #courageousleadership #leadershipcoach\n\nAn useful article from Harvard Business Review that was shared with me by one of my clients today. It's validating and empowering to realise that your burnout isn't a failure, but that actually you might thrive in a better workplace. It's not always about you! And it's equally important to take your time over these questions and to notice recurring patterns that might mean burnout follows you to another role. https://lnkd.in/gYfrfn2w #burnout #compassionateleadership #courageousleadership #leadershipcoach\n\nAs an entrepreneur do you find it hard to unplug and take a holiday. A real holiday I mean? Without scrolling your emails and feed several times a day? I'm asking because this will be contributing to your burnout. Structuring your business so that you can fully step away is essential. Many of us become entrepreneurs for a freedom lifestyle. But you're not free if you work comes with you everywhere you go. I will be walking the walk this summer, with several weeks completely unplugged. I will be dealing with the compulsion to check my emails, by putting my phone away and taking social apps off my phone. I haven't vanished. I'm just enjoying a fabulous break!! What's your summer strategy this year? ðŸ˜Š #burnout #womenentrepreneurs #courageousleadership\n\nYesterday there was an historic win that didn't make the headlines. And I can hardly believe we even had to campaign for this. But the Compassion in Politics team achieved a massive win in Wales, and I hope that with a new government forming, we will soon see England, Scotland and NI following suit. Telling the truth is a basic requirement in democratic government. We need to recognise where we have created a culture where it is difficult to admit the truth, or where telling lies seems okay. That responsibility lies with us all. I'm proud to support the work of Compassion in Politics - and I hope others will join too. #compassionateleadership #courageousleadership\n\n\"I got an interview!!!!\" \"A good days' work... X just emailed...Something I've been wanting to get going for some time.\" I love it when I get emails like this! Clients buzzing and taking courageous steps. Feeling stuck, feeling like everyone else is going to be promoted above and around you, is a painful place to be. Worrying that your business isn't going to fly or that you can't sustain it, and feeling burnout creep up - that's scary. Having the courage to do the deep work - so that there are NO obstacles - that's what I'm talking about! I'm here for the tough days when you're full of doubt, and for the celebrations when you feel your power. Another week of feeling immensely proud of my clients who are out there changing the world! (If you'd love that kind of support, strategy and freedom, message me. I only work with a few selected one-to-one clients.) #compassionateleadership #courageousleadership #womensupportingwomen #entrepreneur #leadershipcoach\n\nBurnout is a complex challenge. And complexity doesn't respond to a silver bullet. I've seen posts recently saying \"it's because you're working harder but not seeing results\". That's certainly one factor. But it's not the whole story. IMO burnout needs a deeper dive. It's not just about you. It's about your relationship with you, your relationship with others, your expectations, your focus, your workplace culture, your mindset, your boundaries. It's about how you sleep, what you eat, how you manage your body and your energy. It's about the stories you tell yourself, and the stories you were told growing up. It's about moral injury, feeling invisible, lack of clear purpose... and so much more. It would be easier to try to sell you a silver bullet. But I'm interested in Qualitative change, sustainable solutions, deep learning. I'm going to be sharing feedback from my current Beyond Burnout cohort soon, before we open the doors again. What's most challenging about burnout for you? #compassionateleadership #burnout #courageousleadership"
