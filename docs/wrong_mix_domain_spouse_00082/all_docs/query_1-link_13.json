        "text": "After many years of marriage, Iain Glen and Susannah Harker parted ways following rumors of an affair between him and Nicole Kidman. However, the actor found love again with his current spouse, Charlotte Emmerson, the mother of two of Iain Glen's children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlen has spent many years acting but rose to stardom after landing the role of Ser Jorah Mormont in the hit HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" Since then, he has joined the cast of other successful projects and the highly-anticipated Apple TV+ series, \"Silo.\"\n\nHis career has been littered with star-studded collaborations, including when he shared the stage with Nicole Kidman in the 1990s. However, their onstage romance reportedly led to Glen's real-life relationship ending in the early 2000s.\n\nIain Glen at the premiere of \"Gletschergrab\" on March 03, 2023, in Cologne, Germany. | Source: Getty Images\n\nRumors of Iain Glen's Affair With Nicole Kidman Allegedly Put a Strain on His First Marriage\n\nGlen and Harker met in the 1980s on the set of the series \"The Fear.\" He was not the only actor on the rise in the relationship, as Harker had snagged roles in \"A Dry White Season\" in 1989, \"House of Cards\" in 1990, and the mini-TV series \"Pride and Prejudice\" in 1996.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the two actors' ironic meet-cute on a set, Glen and Harker married in 1992. And while rubbing shoulders with other Hollywood stars, Glen and his first wife became friends with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise after they tied the knot. The famous couples also reportedly partied together on Cruise's yacht in Sydney.\n\nAccording to Harker, Glen and Kidman became close friends after starring in the play by Sam Mendes, \"The Blue Room,\" in the 1990s. In the risque play, Kidman and Glen had nude scenes, and their performance together led to speculations about the nature of Glen and his co-star's relationship.\n\nIain Glenn and Susannah Harker at the 1997 Laurence Olivier Awards. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAfter images of Glen and Kidman backstage on the opening night of \"The Blue Room\" surfaced, her \"Mission Impossible\" star ex-husband was reportedly \"crazed with jealousy.\" A body language expert shared that Kidman's face and body posture in the photos revealed she was being driven \"wild with desire\" and Glen was \"responding to her sexual signals.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the wake of the rumors about his relationship with Kidman and his highly-publicized separation, Glen revealed that he was aware that he was \"being misconstrued,\" but it did not bother him much. Despite leading a life in the public eye, Glen revealed that he never read anything about himself.\n\nSusannah Harker and Iain Glen at the Evening Standard Film Awards on February 3, 2002, in London, England. | Source: Getty Images\n\n\"There is a terrible sadness, but there are also all the reasons why we came together in the first place,\" Glen said about his divorce, which ended after eight years despite Harker coming to her husband's defense and stating that his relationship with Kidman was platonic.\n\nAlthough friends of the couple revealed Glen's alleged affair with Kidman following her divorce from Cruise had taken a toll on his marriage to Harker, one of Harker's spokespersons set the record straight when they shared:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are definitely no third parties involved.\"\n\nAmelia Fox, Susannah Harker and Iain Glen at the Evening Standard Film Awards on February 3, 2002, in London, England. | Source: Getty Images\n\nIain Glen Found Love Again With Actress Charlotte Emmerson, Whom He Almost Lost to a Brain Hemorrhage\n\nA year after his divorce from Harker, a romantic relationship blossomed between Glen and Emmerson while they were acting in different productions at the National Theatre. Their romance began in 2005, the same year Emmerson played Sarah Da Silva in the series, \"Vincent.\"\n\nHer acting career dates back to the late 1990s, and has seen her land roles in various well-known films and TV shows such as \"Law & Order: UK.\" However, Emmerson was inactive from acting from 2019 until 2021, around the same time she suffered a brain Hemorrhage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer famous husband was filming his final scene, the Battle of Winterfell, in episode three of season eight of \"Game of Thrones\" when he learned of his wife's medical state. Glen recalled:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"My wife was in a dress rehearsal for a play that night, and I rang her to say, 'Break a leg,' and there was no reply, so I left a message. And then I was called to set to rehearse the scene, and when I went back, I got a message from her saying she was in the hospital — she had suffered a brain hemorrhage.\"\n\nGlen revealed that Emilia Clarke, who has also dealt with her share of brain injuries, was the one who urged him to \"get on a flight\" back to his wife after he heard the news. The actor returned to the \"Game of Thrones\" set to film his final scene— which saw him die in Clarke's character's arms— two weeks later, following Emmerson's full recovery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Emmerson has shared glimpses of her happy marriage, including sharing a picture of her Glen on a trip to Egypt in April. In January, the actress posted a black-and-white throwback of the couple before taking another trip down memory lane.\n\nIn June 2022, she posted a snap of her and Glen gazing at each other in the summer of 2003 and took to Instagram in August 2022 to document their family trip to France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIain Glen Has Three Kids From His Two Marriages\n\nGlen welcomed his son, Finlay, during his first marriage. And unlike his \"teenager from hell,\" the actor father— who has a new series releasing in May— says Finlay is \"a mellow soul.\" The actor humorously revealed that the kid most like him with her \"manic ebullience\" is his daughter, Mary— his and Emmerson's first child together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlen and Emmerson are also parents to a second daughter, Juliet, who they revealed has neurodiverse conditions. In March, Emmerson celebrated Neurodiversity Week and shared in an Instagram post, \"She (Juliet) is dyslexic and has been challenged at school in many ways.\"\n\nThe couple often share pictures of their daughters, including a throwback of them in May 2022 visiting their father on set in 2014. Emmerson paid tribute to Juliet's 10th birthday in January, as well as Mary's 15th birthday in September 2022"
