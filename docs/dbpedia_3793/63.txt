Samuel Washington (1734–1781) [Son of Capt. Augustine Washington, Sr. and Mary (Ball) Washington] was a brother of United States President George Washington. He was born on November 27, 1734 [O.S. November 16, 1734], at Pope's Creek, Wakefield, Westmoreland County, Virginia.[1] He died at age 46 on September 26, 1781, a couple of days before the decisive Franco-American victory of Yorktown. His probable cause of death was from tuberculosis, or a similarly contagious and recurring respiratory disease.[2]

Samuel served in numerous posts in Stafford County, Virginia, including justice of the peace, county magistrate, county sheriff, militia officer, and parish vestryman. He resided at Mount Vernon from 1735 to 1738.
