        "meta_description": "Cedar Lawn was built in 1829 for John Thornton Augustine Washington, the great nephew of George Washington. Cedar Lawn was originally part of the nearby Harewood property inherited by Samuel Washington's son, Thornton Washington. Around 1780, he had a log house erected and named the property Berry Hill. After the original log house was destroyed by fire and Thornton's son, John T.A. Washington, inherited the property, he had Cedar Lawn constructed. Cedar Lawn was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.",

        "text": "Cedar Lawn was the home of John Thornton Augustine Washington (May 20, 1783-October 9, 1841), the great nephew of George Washington. It is a Federal style two story, white painted brick structure with a hipped roof and two central chimneys. The front porch faces east and boasts a one story Greek revival style with a pediment. South of the main house is a long, 1.5 story kitchen wing. To the north, there is a small, one story attachment added in the 20th century but in the 19th century style.\n\nThe Cedar Lawn property was originally part of the Harewood estate. The National Register of Historic Places reports that the property was left to Thornton Washington (born 1760- died 1787) and \"in 1780, Thornton built a large log and plank house, naming it Berry Hill in honor of the Miss Berry he had married.\" Unfortunately, this property and structure was destroyed by fire. When John Thornton Augustine inherited the property, he built the present day structure of Cedar Lawn 1825."
