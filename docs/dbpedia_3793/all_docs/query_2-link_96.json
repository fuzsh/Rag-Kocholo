Louisa Parke Costin\n\n​\n\nPublic claim of Michelle Obama, former 1st Lady of the White House, wife of Barack Obama, former President of the United States, is that she is a product descended of a union of Ann Dandridge d/o John Dandridge {husband of Bridget Dugdale, brother of William Dandridge II} and an Unknown African and Native American blood mother that has been stated as a slave; Martha Dandridge Washington a.k.a. Custis the daughter of John Dandridge and Bridget Dugdale is stated as a half-sister of Ann Dandridge.\n\nI've not seen any writing which states Unity West or another Pamunkey tribe member in this near relationship is Ann Dandridge's mother. Important to note, Unity West and William Dandridge II also have a daughter named Martha Dandridge.\n\nPossibly this unknown African or Native American blood mother was transported as a slave from Africa specifically Angola (Portuguese) or Ghana or was a Pamunkey Tribe member. This is the 'unknown mother' of Ann.\n\nIt is suggested, Michelle Obama descends through John Dandridge's daughter Martha, who was secondly married to George Washington, though firstly married to Daniel Parke Custis, it is through John Parke 'Jacky' Custis s/o Daniel Parke Custis 'Jacky', he had a union with 'a slave' of Martha's, where I've seen wording sway, stating she was her half-sister Ann. Together they produced a son called William (see link). Not sure about this association that would put the issue as Michelle being descended from Martha and Daniel Parke Custis son Jacky and a plantation slave possibly a half-sister of Martha, and of unknown origin\n\nIt is important to note, 'Jacky' was adopted by George Washington, so the product of this union is not of Washington descent. Certainly, the descent would be Dandridge, also Custis, unlikely through the West or Aylett's unless further back or forward.\n\nThis genealogist has not discovered characteristics of John Dandridge or the Custis through the path of ancestors or descendants of John Danridges, Sr. son William Dandridge II except the mother of John Dandridge, Sr. is Ann Bolling and I believe this is of English descent and is affiliated through to Edmund Crouchback son of King Edward III.\n\nAnn Dandridge, Martha's supposed half-sister, daughter of John Dandridge supposedly then married, Costin one of the plantation slaves Martha owned and together they had additional children. Four daughters.\n\nThis genealogist as of this writing 03/10/2021 is still defining relationships of many same name individuals and making clarifications based on progressive writings of many.\n\n​\n\nUnnamed daughter [Calvert] - b. 1775, d. 1775, shortly after birth\n\nElizabeth 'Eliza' Parke Custis Law [Received from Martha Washington as a wedding present in 1796, Philadelphia 'Delphy' Judge (dower slave), originally promised Oney Judge as a wedding gift, Oney, 'Delphy's' older sister fled to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she was a fugitive, then settled in Greenland, New Hampshire, married a free black sailor and had three children, Elizabeth \"INHERITED: 80 slaves upon her marriage from her late father's estate, after Martha Washington's death, 1802, Elizabeth; INHERITED: 35 dower slaves] from her grandfather Daniel Parke Custis's estate, at the death of Elizabeth's mother, 1811, her father's estate was liquidated and Elizabeth; INHERITED: approximately 40 more slaves] [Calvert] - b. 21 August 1776, d 31 December 1831.
