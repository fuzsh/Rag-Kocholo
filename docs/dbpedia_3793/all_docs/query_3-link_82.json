        "text": "1 This statement is slightly inaccurate, for Dr. Calef was not a member of the House which passed the resolution.\n\n1 “Variety stores” had long existed in Boston, but the earliest use of that particular term known to me—a term which, singularly enough, is not recognized in the Century Dictionary—occurs in an advertisement of William Jackson’s “Variety Store” in the Boston Evening Post of 21 November, 1768, No. 1730, p. 3/3.\n\n1 Suffolk Court Files, no. 514. See also nos. 817–826 for a full history of the case. In the last group there are thirty-three papers.\n\n1 The Cambridge records state that “ffrances Jackson daughter of Edward died” 5 October, 1648; but there is no record of such a daughter, and possibly “daughter” is the clerk’s error for “wife.”\n\n1 On 30 December, 1731, it was—\n\nOrdered, That William Sherley Esq; be desired to be of Council to Mr. Philip Bongarden, and assist him in seeking Relief for the Palantines (in whose behalf he appears) in the legal and customary Way in such Cases (Massachusetts House of Journals, p. 43).\n\nIt is interesting to note the name of Shirley. He is generally said to have come to this country in or about 1733. As a matter of fact, he reached Boston 27 October, 1731 (6 Massachusetts Historical Collections, vi. 21), and this was doubtless one of the first of his public employments. Philip Bongarden was one of the foreign Protestants naturalized 7 December, 1731 (Massachusetts Archives, Council Records, ix. 335)."
