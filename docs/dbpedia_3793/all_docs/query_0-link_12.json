Col. of the same, in that Station he was active in endeavoring to raise the said Regiments and continued his exertions in that line until the summer of 78 after which he was not called into service as the Regiment was never entirely completed and there was no Command for him; your Petitioner was nevertheless at all times ready to perform services when his country demanded them and as a manifestation of this disposition in the year 1781 when the State was invaded he very cheerfully took the command of a body of Militia, although he was by not compelled to do so. For these services your petitioner has received no Lands although other Officers whose terms of service have been much shorter and less arduous have found no difficulty in obtaining them. Very retired in his mode of life your petitioner has until very lately neglected to inquire into the means by which he may obtain his right, and being informed that the interposition of your Hon. body is necessary to do him justice, he request that his case may be taken into Consideration as your justice has been extended to General Stevens, Col. Parker, General Spotswood & other officers your Petitioner hopes & expects the same at your hands. Circumstanced as he is he prays your Hon. house to grant him a Lieut. Col.'s proportion of land was such other quantity as you may think his services & merits entitle him to – and he will pray as he is in duty bound.[2]\n\nIn 1830 the heirs of Colonel John Thornton again petitioned to receive the lands denied him. The following heirs of Colonel Thornton were determined by those proceedings.\n\nMary Thornton, m. Dr. Isaac Winston, son James Madison Thornton Winston d. 15 Oct 1831.\n\nJane W. Thornton m.

S., Caroline H. (m. Francis Thompson), George W. and Dr. Aylett H. Thornton.\n\nThe Honorable Secretary of War\n\nAt a Court held for Culpeper County on Monday the 16th day of January 1832. The Court doth order to be certified that Colonel John Thornton late of the Virginia Continental line, departed this life sometime since leaving as heirs at law, James Madison Thornton Winston, who departed this life on the 15th day of October 1831 in the 29th year of his age, only child and heir at law of his Daughter Mary Thornton, who was his Mother, and who intermarried with Doctor Isaac Winston, and departed this life before her Father, Frances G Thornton, Mary Francis and Elizabeth Thornton, only children and heirs at law of Jane W. Thornton who was a daughter of Colonel John Thornton, and who intermarried with Francis Thornton, but who departed this life before her said Father, and George W. S. Thornton, and they are the only heirs at law of said Colonel John Thornton at the time of his death, but that his daughter Frances G Thornton is since dead, leaving the following children, Alfred A Thornton, Matilda A. S. Thornton, Caroline H. Thornton, who has since intermarried with Francis Thompson, George W. Thornton and Aylatt H. Thornton. That his son George W. S. Thornton is likewise since dead leaving one child named Jane W. Thornton that she is his only heir at law, and that Isaac Thornton [should read Isaac Winston] is heir at law, distributee and devisee of said James Madison Thornton Winston.
