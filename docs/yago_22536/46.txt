Madonna will release her documentary “I’m Going To Tell You a Secret” as a CD/DVD package June 13 via Warner Bros. The film, directed by Jonas Akerlund, chronicles the diva’s 2004 Re-Invention Tour. The release will also boast a 14-song CD of music culled from the film and concert, including “Holiday,” “I Love New York,” “Like a Prayer” and a cover of John Lennon’s “Imagine.”

The DVD will include never-before-seen footage from the documentary as well as the director’s cut of Madonna’s controversial music video for 2003’s “American Life” single. The artist canceled the release of the original clip shortly before its U.S. premiere.

Before the bow of “Secret,” Madonna will hit the road with her Confessions Tour, beginning May 21 at the Forum in Los Angeles. First up is her first-ever festival appearance this weekend at Coachella in Indio, Calif.
