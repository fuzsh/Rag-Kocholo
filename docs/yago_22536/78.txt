Madonna's documentary I'm Going To Tell You a Secret is set for release as a CD/DVD package.

The film, which follows the queen of pop on her Reinvention Tour in 2004, features unseen footage of the singer and a director's cut of her controversial American Life music video.

It will also come with a 14-song CD of music from the tour featuring Madonna classics including Holiday and a cover of John Lennon's Imagine.

Directed by Jonas Akerlund, who made the Ray of Light video, the film will be released by Warner Brothers in June.
