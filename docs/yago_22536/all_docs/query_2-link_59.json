        "text": "Harlepolis\n\nMadonna's \"Truth Or Dare\" Movie - Yay/Nay?\n\nI'm thinking of buying these 2 films...\n\nAll I know about the former is it was directed by the same person who directed \"Sex & The City\", I'm however really intrested in the latter.\n\nI'm a REAL \"music documentary\" buff, so this will be right up my alley,,,beside I remember watching afew clips from it long time ago and I'm simply intrigued.\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nAnxiety\n\ni thought truth or dare was a lot of fun. it's the version of madonna i thought was most fun. even at her most obnoxious in that movie, it's still more enjoyable to make fun of her then than it is to make fun of her now...because at least back then, you got the idea that she was laughing at herself a little bit, too.\n\nernestsewell\n\nTruth or Dare, all the way.\n\nI have it on VHS and DVD. The VHS has two extra performances at the end. It has the FULL performances of \"Like A Prayer\" and \"Hanky Panky\". They are only clips in the film, and on the DVD. These full performances are NOT on the DVD.\n\nI love the audio over the closing credits.\n\nNikki: \"I think I got my period.\"\n\nMadonna: \"NIKKI!\"\n\nHarlepolis\n\nernestsewell said:\n\nTruth or Dare, all the way.\n\nI have it on VHS and DVD.

But, then again, I far prefer the older, wiser Madge.\n\ni like the beginning of \"i'm going to tell you a secret\" when she's all up in that matthew barney cremaster shit. other than that...meh.\n\nCalhounSq\n\nTruth or Dare is great, I still wish I had that version of \"Like A Virgin\" & \"Keep It Together\", they were just arranged nicely. Desperately Seeking Susan is fucking stupid. Unless you're a huge fan of both (b/c Madonna isn't in it that much from what I recall), don't bother...\n\nI never met you, but I LOVE you & I will forever!! Thank you for being YOU - my little Princey, the best to EVER do it\n\nSCNDLS\n\nOne of my favorite moments in Truth or Dare is when they go to the Spanish director's party and Madonna is sweating Antonio Banderas before anyone knew who he was, but his wife is there. And Madonna says that the director tells Madonna \"It's okay, all the men are married in Spain.\" And Nikki says \"I would be one fighting bitch.\"\n\nIstenSzek\n\nCalhounSq said:\n\nTruth or Dare is great, I still wish I had that version of \"Like A Virgin\" & \"Keep It Together\", they were just arranged nicely.

Unless you're a huge fan of both (b/c Madonna isn't in it that much from what I recall), don't bother...\n\nme too, did she ever release that on a single or something?\n\ni love that eastern tinged arrangement. it fits the song so\n\nwell.\n\nand true love lives on lollipops and crisps\n\nDaveT\n\nI think they are both interesting if you are a Madonna fan. Thing to remember is that alot of Truth Or Dare was staged, so to call it a documentary is a bit of a stretch. Still an incredible watch though, and perfectly captures the lady at that stage of her career.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Can I Tell You A Secret, purely because the lady comes off alot better in that one (not sure if any of that was staged to, but I would assume so)...and she looks gorgeous in that doc, so pretty!\n\nSusan is the sort of film you might not enjoy if you're not a Madge fan because of its slighly off-kilter, so-what plotline, but essential if you are a fan. Great little snap shot of New York at the time for those that are interested in the Big Apple.\n\nwww.filmsfilmsfilms.co.uk - The internet's best movie site!\n\nSoulAlive\n\nCalhounSq said:\n\nTruth or Dare is great, I still wish I had that version of \"Like A Virgin\" & \"Keep It Together\", they were just arranged nicely. Desperately Seeking Susan is fucking stupid. Unless you're a huge fan of both (b/c Madonna isn't in it that much from what I recall), don't bother...\n\nI agree with everything you said.I always thought that 'Desperarately Seeking Susan' is dumb.I never understood all the hype for that film\n\n'Truth Or Dare' is a must-see film.\n\nVinnyM27\n\nI don't think \"Truth Or Dare\" is easy to find on DVD, so buy that (where \"Desperately Seeking Susan\" is readily avialable and on TV often) so buy \"Truth or Dare\". Is an interesting behind the scenes look at Madonna 1990...much more interesting than the spiritual BS of Madonna 2004 on RIT (which as I recall barely had any musical performances unlike TOD which gave you some great highlights from \"Blonde Ambition\").\n\nSoulAlive\n\nHarlepolis said:\n\nOk, I'm abit lost here...\n\nWhats the difference between Truth Or Dare/Can I Tell You A Secret? Is it like a sequel and if so where can I find it?\n\n'Can I Tell You A Secret' is sorta like a sequel to 'Truth Or Dare'.It was filmed during Madonna's 2004 'Re-Invention Tour' and like the previous film,it contains alot of backstage footage.It gives us a look at the \"older,wiser\" Madonna.If you're a Madonna fan,it's a must-see but I don't think it's nearly as exciting as 'Truth Or Dare'.\n\nernestsewell\n\nSoulAlive said:\n\n'Can I Tell You A Secret' is sorta like a sequel to 'Truth Or Dare'.It was filmed during Madonna's 2004 'Re-Invention Tour' and like the previous film,it contains alot of backstage footage.It gives us a look at the \"older,wiser\" Madonna.If you're a Madonna fan,it's a must-see but I don't think it's nearly as exciting as 'Truth Or Dare'.\n\nIt's not a sequel. They're both documentaries, independent of each other. The first concentrates more on the tour itself. The second shows the tour, but also shows her relationship with then husband Guy Ritchie, as well as her Kaballah beliefs and a trip to Israel or Egypt or something. They're very different movies.."
