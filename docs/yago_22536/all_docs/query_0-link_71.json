        "text": "Madonna\n\n“Live to Tell”\n\n“With Madonna measuring the safety of silence against the urge to unburden herself, ‘Live to Tell’ captures the utter loneliness of those times during adolescence when the world crashes down on you with each new problem, but fears of rejection, punishment, condemnation, or inflicting pain—prevents you from confiding in your parents.”\n\n–Joyce Millman, quoted in Desperately Seeking Madonna (ed. Sexton, 1993), 57.\n\nMuch has been written about Madonna. Scholars have picked apart her videos more than any other MTV star, and since the 1980s, feminists have debated whether she represents cheap objectification or inspiring empowerment. Everyone knows she has a large gay fan base.\n\nI don’t have strong opinions about Madonna. I’ve never bought a Madonna album or gone to a concert, but I like her music and think she is a cool person overall. In this essay I want to pay homage to her overlooked Live to Tell video (1985), which I consider important for two reasons: it ushers in Madonna’s first major change in image, and it is a quintessential MTV soundtrack video, blending footage of Madonna with scenes from the low-key rural crime noir At Close Range starring Christopher Walken and Madonna’s new husband Sean Penn. The performance footage of Madonna and clips from the movie complement one another in interesting ways.\n\nLive to Tell represented Madonna’s first major change in image. She’s not a strident material girl here, decked out in tacky accessories and overstated urban style (the “Boy Toy” image), but rather a humble artist of substance and serious demeanor, resplendent in maturity and wisdom. She wears an elegant yet down-to-earth dress with a black and red pattern, something that looks like it might be from the 1930s or 1940s. Her make-up is subdued and emphasizes natural colors. Her hair is a single shade of blond in a conservative style. The video emphasizes Madonna’s face rather than her body, and her facial expressions enhance the song’s heavy, sad tone. Perhaps most notable is her stillness throughout the video. She is definitely not dancing like she usually does. All of her previous videos featured some dancing, whether elaborate and choreographed (Material Girl), burlesque (Like a Virgin), or romantic slow dancing (Crazy For You). Her subdued stillness complements the song’s haunting atmospheric keyboard chords and quiet, muted guitar riffs. She sings in a low, deep voice, at least one octave lower than the nasal high-registered voice of her early hits.\n\nMadonna’s remarkable career longevity can be credited to her periodic Bowie-like image makeovers. After this brief “serious” phase, for example, she went through a Spanish phase, a techno phase, a bondage phase, 70s retro phase, country phase, one after the other. I’m sure I missed a few. Madonna’s videos were instrumental in establishing these new personas because each reinvention involved a change in fashion and visual appearance as well as musical style. Her videos are very high quality. She has always invested a lot of money in them and hired the best talent. Has Madonna ever made a bad video? Some are better than others; some are masterpieces. All her videos have rich visual appeal even if you mute the sound.\n\nLive to Tell is a quintessential soundtrack video in its perfect blend of shots showing Madonna singing (so seriously) and its movie clip montages hinting at heavy, serious drama. Like an effective movie trailer, the music video shows fragments of At Close Range without giving away too much. It creates a sense of mood and atmosphere, and it introduces the film’s key characters. Penn and Walken’s incredible acting skills make them a pleasure to watch even though you can’t hear their dialogue. They look so intense.\n\nIf we take a cynical attitude towards Madonna, we might speculate that her image change here—and perhaps the whole marriage to Penn—was a carefully crafted ruse to crash Hollywood and become a movie star. Madonna has certainly tried hard to become a movie star, with mixed success. I liked her in Dick Tracy, and she was popular in A League of Their Own. I also liked A Dangerous Game, an early 1990s Method-fest with Harvey Keitel, but it wasn’t very popular. She’s done a lot of bad movies, like Who’s That Girl, and most notably, Shanghai Surprise, the failed culmination of her effort to ride hubby Sean’s coattails to Hollywood stardom. They split up soon after. Live to Tell came out many months earlier, during a brief moment when the idea of a Sean Penn-Madonna partnership seemed both feasible and cool. It was a quintessentially 1980s moment, Jeff Spicolli marrying Madonna. The unstated subtext of their relationship makes the video even more interesting to watch as a reminder of that whole sordid mid-80s tabloid drama. Penn and Madonna never appear together in the video, but through the magic of editing they still work as a team, cross-cut instead of side-by-side. Penn shows off his acting prowess amidst the film’s beautiful cinematography, while Madonna commands the camera with her new “serious” look, looking like both a beautiful singer and a faithful, dutiful wife.\n\nThe song’s open-fifth keyboard riffs immediately create a musical feeling of space, like an open landscape. This sense of space is visually reflected in the large dark spaces that surround Madonna in the video’s opening shot. She is filmed at a distance, only her blond hair is lit up. The camera sneaks up behind her, then spins around to capture her face as she starts singing. Her new image is carefully unveiled in this shot, with a hint of suspense as though to tease the audience with the question “What will the new Madonna look like?” then “ta-da!”\n\nAt first Madonna sings looking off into the distance, but during the second line her eyes turn sharply towards the camera, imploring us to appreciate the serious nature of her new song. It is a long, continuous shot approximately 30 seconds long, very long for a music video, and also undergirding the “serious” mood (because rapid editing at the time was often associated with superficiality and a lack of substance).\n\nThe song’s lyrics are vague: a secret haunts her, a dangerous secret that must “burn inside” her because she cannot reveal it. It’s deliberately ambiguous and could be interpreted any number of ways. It could certainly be an anthem for closeted gay people in the 1980s who felt the sting of a secret burning inside of them. The video however points us towards the visual landscape of At Close Range with its dark intrigue. After the long opening shot of Madonna, the video shows Penn in a car, then back to Madonna, creating a sense of interplay between them, the two tabloid lovers gazing at each other from one medium (music) into another (cinema) through the intermediary of music video.\n\nThis pattern of cutting back and forth between Madonna and the movie repeats throughout the video. It’s rather low budget compared to other Madonna videos, especially considering that half the video is recycled movie footage. The video’s subdued minimalist visuals, however, are consistent with basic principles of film noir, a genre that thrived on low budgets in the 1940s and 1950s. Madonna enters a noir realm in this video, not as a femme fatale as we might expect, but as a witness to and narrator of tragic events. Her presence is wholesome and innocent, yet also victimized because of her trauma bearing witness to her horrible secret.\n\nThe first chorus provides a sequence of movie clips showing Penn, looking young, blond, fabulous, and oh-so serious, interacting with Walken. We see them standing in a darkened living room, walking in the woods, then standing in a barn door. The scenes are artfully composed and contrast light and shadow to great effect. Walken holds up a wad of cash as Penn react with nervous unease.\n\nThe details of what’s going on are vague. It seems to be some scam involving tractors. Whatever it is, we know it has succeeded after seeing Penn, Walken, and two other men jump up in triumphant exultation in slow motion, followed by a shot of Walken and Penn laughing and smiling in a car.\n\nThe fact that we don’t get the whole story is consistent with the broader patterns of music videos, which tend depict fragments of stories instead of fully developed narratives. Similar to Billie Jean, we get the gist of the story but are left wondering about key details. The video makers, of course, want us to go buy a ticket to At Close Range to fill in these blanks, but the ambiguities can be enjoyed in their own right without knowing exactly what is happening. Since the movie was not especially popular and left theaters after a couple weeks, most people watching this video would not have known the story’s details. Indeed, the song (and video) proved far more popular than the film (poor Sean!).\n\nDuring the next verse and chorus, the criminal scheme starts to unravel. Walken, Penn and another man sit in a café with moody natural light streaming onto the tables in an otherwise dark and forboding interior. Walken, wearing an odd half-smile on his face, lays a gun down on a brightly-lit table. Penn, alarmed, looks around to see if anyone in the café noticed the gun. Then Penn stares deeply into Walken, now realizing of the danger of his situation (whatever that may be).\n\nThis sequence is followed by one of the video’s most memorable scenes: a series of shots of Penn, Walken, and other male characters diving into a lake, the camera pointing up at them as they fly effortlessly through the air in graceful slow motion. The blue-sky backdrop provides a visual sense of freedom that contrasts sharply with the claustrophobia of the previous scene, creating a feeling of tension release.\n\nWe go back to Madonna, then see a quick shot of a man getting shot to death in the middle of a field at night, followed by Walken making a “shhhh” gesture in front of a lake with its water shimmering ominously in the moonlight. Now we know the secret of which Madonna sings, and we have been warned by Walken not to tell.\n\nMadonna looks straight ahead into the camera in the next shot, right at us, her face a mix of fear and sadness. Several shots follow of Penn sitting in jail, his girlfriend looking concerned, and Walken losing control of himself.\n\nThey build to the video’s most climactic moment: as the music comes to a near-stop, we see Penn bearing down on Walken with a handgun. Walken protests fearfully, then submits. Up till now, the video implied that Walken was manipulating Penn and putting him in harm’s way. Now the tables have turned. The camera pans up Penn’s arm showing his glowering face. It is intense and perfectly synchronized to the song. We hold our breath along with the music.\n\nBack in the darkness of the studio, the chair is now empty. Madonna stands to sing the song’s bridge and chorus as a gentle breeze blows back her hair. She sings about running away, about searching for safety. Only her face is lit, everything else is dark. The video winds down with a few more clips from the film, hinting that Penn has escaped Walken’s grip but that he remains haunted by the secret he must carry inside of him.\n\nNo doubt this video subconsciously appealed to me when I was 12 because of my own dark secret; the sense of dread, paranoia, and death that is so palpable in this video captured my own anxieties about being attracted to men. In 1985, my secret was at least as bad as Madonna’s in this video, or so it seemed. AIDS added the element of death. My secret burned long and deep in me, and left permanent scars. The video’s narrative vagueness allows us as spectators to fill in blanks and imagine different ways of putting the clips together. The video provides a noir template and mood of heavy drama, but lets us do as we wish with them. We can plug the video into our lives and find points of connection. Queer people especially would find a resonance in this video in the dark heart of the Reagan era. Madonna shares our pain, and promises not to tell our secret. No matter how many times she changed her image, she has always been on our side."
