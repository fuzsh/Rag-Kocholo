        "text": "Thanks!\n\nIt looks like Madonna might be making another film...\n\nIt sounds like a good book, but I was hoping for less than 4 years until the next record.:(\n\nGranted, she may just produce.\n\nMadonna's no. 30 on Rolling Stone's greatest performers right now, list - which is too low. Too many folk-rockers ahead of her for my liking.\n\nALSO, , Debi Mazar was interviewed for her new film Lovelace and apparently Sean is still the greatest love of Madonna's life, despite all that history.\n\nThe book sounds interesting. I looked it up on amazon and the writer has list of songs from 1985 that inspired them. I wouldn't mind if she did another film but also recorded new songs for it. That way she could continue her love of directing yet also give her fans new music at the same time. Also, writing songs for a story might really inspire her to do some different things than she normally does since she won't be limited by what would work live in a big venue. Awhile back she was supposed to do a musical film for which she wrote songs some of which ended up on Confessions, so there's no reason why she couldn't do the same for this film.\n\nI agree she should be higher on the live list, but the write up about her is nice. It says she sings live, which a lot of people still don't realize.\n\n0\n\noh no, not another film.:yawn: anything, but that.:sleep: apart from her two golden globes her film career has been mostly fruitless and i have never really understood her passion for it really, baring her lack of recognition in mind. over the decades if one thing has truly tested me as a madonna loon, its been her countless doomed movie outings.:eek:\n\nsorry to be negative, but w.e. was probably the last straw for me and while it was beautifully shot, but the script was dreadful.:o what really annoyed me the most was the promotion which madonna really embraced and ultimately ran out of time to properly promote \"mdna\". which in turn landed her with two underachieving projects in a short space of time.:mad:\n\nof course, in this instance the book doesn't seem to be an issue, but the potential for things to go downhill from there is probable considering the sheer amount of film disasters from her over the years. the time aspect also worries me too, i really thought music would be her main focus once again following \"mdna\" and another movie could delay or comprise her inspiration for the next record. i hope this report is just an idea of hers at this stage and doesn't blur her vision in terms of a musical return.\n\nin terms of the recent speculation about her ongoing feelings for sean, i can well imagine her still harbouring feelings for him. that relationship was intense, toxic and no doubt exciting. i think ultimately, madonna`s success intimidated sean, which could have led to his abuse of her. whereas, guy was blasé about her popularity and saw himself as an equal in their marriage. i think she loved them both in very different ways and i would imagine she holds on to the more positive memories from both marriages.:)\n\n0\n\nIf I had to score her acting performances in films, it'd go like this;\n\nA Certain Sacrifice - I've never seen it\n\nVision Quest (cameo) - I've never seen it\n\nDesperately Seeking Susan - 7/10\n\nShanghai Surprise - 2/10\n\nWho's That Girl - 4/10\n\nBloodhounds of Broadway - I've never seen it\n\nDick Tracy - 6/10\n\nShadows & Fog (cameo) - 3/10\n\nA League of Their Own - 8/10\n\nBody of Evidence - 3/10\n\nDangerous Game - I've never seen it\n\nBlue in the Face (cameo) - I've never seen it\n\nFour Rooms - 2/10\n\nGirl 6 (cameo) - 5/10\n\nEvita - 7/10\n\nThe Next Best Thing - 5/10\n\nSwept Away - 1/10\n\nDie Another Day (cameo) - 6/10\n\nArthur & The Invisibles (voice) - 6/10\n\nThe number of films I haven't seen gives you a good indication of how well they did at the box office and hence the availability of them now.\n\nHer documentaries;\n\nTruth or Dare? - 10/10\n\nI'm Going To Tell You A Secret - 9/10\n\nHer directions;\n\nFilth & Wisdom - 4/10\n\nW.E. - 5/10\n\nOverall, she's done some good stuff, some alright stuff and some stuff she shouldn't have gone anywhere near (i.e. the two films with her husbands - worst idea ever). And that's just about all I can say, apart from the few awards she's gotten and the songs she has performed that have won Oscars.\n\n0\n\nA few months back I was cleaning out the basement and there was this box of Madonna merchandise from when I was a kid, in it was a 1993 issue of US magazine that I kept, my mom subscribe, they had an article on the big 12 A list Hollywood actresses and guess who was included?\n\nThat's right Madonna, the article said that Madonna is one of only about a dozen who could command multi million dollar salaries for every film she appearrd in\n\nIn mentions that she got paid $2 million for a supporting part inA League of Their Own and earned $3 million for the lead in Body of Evidence as well as a slew of perks including male co star approval, face on movie poster etc.\n\nAt the time the 2 highest paid actresses in Hollywood were Whoopi Goldberg and Julia Roberts and they were earning about $5 million a picture.\n\nThis article is interesting because it CONFIRMS that Madonna did have a period in the early 90s when she was considered an A list actress, I think Body of Evidence flopping and Dangerous Game barely being released(Madonna was excellent in that film, best performance of her career) really hurt her until Evita\n\n0\n\nAt the same time though her performance in Dangerous Game is incredible. Its just such a low key movie not many have seen it.\n\nShe is also really good in the minor roles like League Of Their Own and Bloodhounds of Broadway.\n\nThe roles where she tries to channel Monroe are terrible. Swept Away is the lowest point of the movie career if you ask me.\n\nnow see i didn't mind that film, but admittedly, the best thing about the movie was that it was beautifully shot.:o i can even enjoy \"who's that girl\" for its absurdity. its her serious roles bar \"evita\" which are her worst in my opinion, but i agree at least that her performance in \"dangerous game\" is better than her acting in \"body of evidence\".\n\nI personally do not like Madonna as an actress. Evita required no dialogue, which is why excelled and won the golden globe. Desperately seeking susan was Madonna playing herself really. But i admire her for giving it a go. I do think Madonna set a low standard for other female artists-turned actresses. Especially as the likes of Britney and Rihanna have all been publicly trashed for their acting and both won razzies.\n\ni agree, \"battleships\" and \"crossroads\" were both terrible. however, i was most disappointed with britney's performance, considering she had at least some sort of formal training in her youth.\n\n0\n\nI think Madonna is slightly underrated as an actress. OK shes not the best out there i grant you but still shes starred in some good roles. Evita, Desperately Seeking Susan, Dangerous Game &League Of Their Own. I'm not saying shes Nicole Kidman no but still all those worst actress awards really aren't true. Swept Away wasn't that bad it wasn't great but still i think she was OK. Body of Evidence given the time & nature people really only focused on the negatives maybe if the script was changed & the sex scenes toned down it might have done better.\n\nRihanna on Battleship yes i agree she wasn't very good imo too.\n\nBritney on Crossroads was actually quite good i think. There was that scene when her Mother rejected her & she goes back to the hotel & cries i think she was good.\n\nBritney also is good at comedy I'd love her to try a bit more acting. Maybe I'm alone with that one!\n\nMadonna too should have another go!\n\n0\n\nThe article listed Madonna as A list because she was coming off of 3 highly successful films in a row with Dick Tracy, Truth or Dare (one of the highest grossing documentaries ever) and A League of Their Own\n\nIt also mentioned that Madonna had founded Maverick, the previous year and there was a film division that would allow her to produce and star in films\n\nMadonna and Demi Moore even wrote a script for a female buddy cop film called Leda and Swan, they were both supposed to star in this big budget film, with Lethal Weapon producer Joel Silver producing and directing.\n\nGarry Marshall was signed to direct a film that was going by the working title 3000 with Madonna set to star in the lead, but at the last minute Madonna dropped out to do Dick Tracy\n\nThat film would be releasd as Pretty Woman with Julia Roberts taking over the role that Marshall wanted Madonna for (Marshall writes about this in his autobiography)\n\nWoody Allen also wrote a part just for Madonna in Shadows and Fog, which is considered \"prestige\" in Hollywood if Allen wants you in one of his films\n\nAfter Annette Benning got pregnant and dropped out of playing Catwoman in Batman Returns, Madonna was one of the names who was rumored to replace her. Supposedly Warner Brothers pushed for Madonna to do the film in hopes that she would do songs for a soundtrack tie in (like Prince did with the first Batman) Madonna reportedly turned it down because she didn't want to repear herself by doing another comic book movie so she did A League Of Their Own instead\n\n0\n\nI actually really loved Crossroads and never saw why people hated it. Her performance was average and it was a nice film about friendship and growing up really.\n\nOh and i must not forget Mariah. Glitter. That not only killed her acting career, but nearly her music career.\n\ni just expected more from britney as an actress, considering her background. whereas, rihanna and madonna had no acting experience when they first made movies.\n\nthe whole \"glitter\" project was a complete disaster and like you say, even the music didn't perform well. we also shouldn't forget janet jackson's film début \"poetic justice\". while it was no box office flop, her role did earn her a \"golden raspberry\" and the critics did dub it \"pathetic justice\".:o\n\nits true madonna did have some film successes, but the lows were more widely reported and her reputation as an actress has always been pretty poor unfortunately.\n\n0\n\nThe article listed Madonna as A list because she was coming off of 3 highly successful films in a row with Dick Tracy, Truth or Dare (one of the highest grossing documentaries ever) and A League of Their Own\n\nIt also mentioned that Madonna had founded Maverick, the previous year and there was a film division that would allow her to produce and star in films\n\nMadonna and Demi Moore even wrote a script for a female buddy cop film called Leda and Swan, they were both supposed to star in this big budget film, with Lethal Weapon producer Joel Silver producing and directing.\n\nGarry Marshall was signed to direct a film that was going by the working title 3000 with Madonna set to star in the lead, but at the last minute Madonna dropped out to do Dick Tracy\n\nThat film would be releasd as Pretty Woman with Julia Roberts taking over the role that Marshall wanted Madonna for (Marshall writes about this in his autobiography)\n\nWoody Allen also wrote a part just for Madonna in Shadows and Fog, which is considered \"prestige\" in Hollywood if Allen wants you in one of his films\n\nAfter Annette Benning got pregnant and dropped out of playing Catwoman in Batman Returns, Madonna was one of the names who was rumored to replace her.

Boxing Helena is as bad as Swept Away and Shanghai Surprise multiplied by each other.:eek:\n\nThe other major flop she turned down was Prince's Graffiti Bridge. And again, thank the sweet Lord.\n\n0\n\nNot true Ciccone Youth. Madonna has a lot of good friends who are big names in the movie industry, why do you think her after Oscar's party is the A list event with the biggest stars every year?\n\nMadonna herself vowed after Swept Away flopped to never act on film again\n\nShe did do voice acting with Arthur and the Invisibles, but that role was offered to her and she received second billing on the film\n\nAdam Shankman reportedly wanted Madonna for the bitchy role of Velma in Hairspray (which ironically Pfeiffer would take), but Madonna said no because she was done with acting, the films star John Travolta even talked to Madonna himself to get her to accept the role\n\nThey've been friends for years, with Travolta going to her post Oscar's bash this past year\n\nBack in 1998 they were also attached along with Goldie Hawn and Rosie O'Donnell to star in the film adaptation of Chicago\n\nAlso the filming of Hairspray would have conflicted with the Confessions tour dates\n\n0"
