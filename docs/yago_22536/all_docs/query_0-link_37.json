        "text": "I genuinely don't think she will have watched any of this since it was made. Including the old performances.\n\nShe probably inspired her fucking self sitting watching it.\n\nI would bet money she hasn't watched it. Maybe, MAYBE...ahead of I'm Going To Tell You A Secret...but unlikely.\n\nLove that she's looking back fondly. I really do. I wonder what all this means, though? I think Rebel Heart (and the tour) might have been the last traditional Madonna era as we know it. I wouldn't be surprised if she finally slows down, or somehow frames future work differently. I want her gyrating into her 80's of course, but...I guess this last era has been so successful (as fans) and positive that I wouldn't her slowing down as some kind of brand betrayal (as I might once have).\n\nI genuinely don't think she will have watched any of this since it was made. Including the old performances.\n\nShe probably inspired her fucking self sitting watching it.\n\nShe said last year she saw it several years ago. Interview with Andy Cohen:\n\nWhen was the last time you saw your 1991 doc Truth or Dare?\n\nJeez, I don’t know. Several years ago. I’ve seen bits and pieces from it. I sort of gag when I watch it, ‘cause I’m like, “Oh my God, I can’t.” It’s hard to watch myself do anything. I can’t even stand to watch myself in concert, like my last tour.\n\nReally? Why?\n\nI just don’t like to watch it. But I think maybe Truth or Dare, I could possibly revisit it right now.\n\nCan you call me when you do that, please?\n\nLet’s watch it together.\n\nI want to film you watching Truth or Dare and release that.\n\nMe just going, “I can’t believe I said that. Oh my God, I can’t believe I did that.” The arrogance…\n\nWell, the arrogance was brilliant. The shade, the arrogance…\n\nThe shade was thrown! I’m afraid to watch it. I just think I was a horrible brat, that’s what I’m afraid of.\n\nI want to film you watching Truth or Dare and release that.\n\nMe just going, “I can’t believe I said that. Oh my God, I can’t believe I did that.” The arrogance…\n\nWell, the arrogance was brilliant. The shade, the arrogance…\n\nThe shade was thrown! I’m afraid to watch it. I just think I was a horrible brat, that’s what I’m afraid of.\n\nI am not in here for Bitch Madonna really – unlike some people who are like \"oooh torture me kween\" – but Truth Or Dare was a fabulous display of \"I'm going to say whatever the fuck I want\". Unlike I'm Going To Tell You A Secret which was painful to watch.\n\nIt's really hard to compare them and both are masterpieces, but I do prefer I'm Going to Tell You a Secret over Truth or Dare. I feel like we get to know Madonna better and there's actually something other than deal with her. Personal taste, I guess.\n\nI think you're right in that there is no comparison. IGTTYAS is a nice little document I suppose but Truth or Dare was a monumental moment that couldn't have come at a more pivotal time and is, as a film, important. All the articles coming in the wake of the anniversary, the Strike A Pose movie which is a spin-off I suppose... all speak to it's impact. Just reading the comments under articles shared on Facebook today - adults all paying respects to the influence the film had on them as young LGBT men and women. And it's so rarely to do with her. She's ostensibly the point, and certainly the driver of the film, but it's everything else around that's the real concern. Her putting on such a bratty persona actually allowed everything else to shine, instead of getting to know her. While we see the real Madge in IGTTYAS, it's just that. A little document."
