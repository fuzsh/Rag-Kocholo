And that makes sense. It's the city where she became Madonna.\n\nhttp://gothamist.com/2016/08/23/madonna_nyc_movies.php\n\nReviewing the film in the May 14, 1991, issue of the Voice, J. Hoberman praised Truth or Dare as \"a remarkable portrait of a sacred monster in her prime.\" The description remains unassailable — and is now all the more poignant, considering Madonna's diminished stature today.\n\nhttp://www.villagevoice.com/film/ju...onna-doc-still-delights-and-confounds-9014703\n\nAlex Keshishian: The movie showed a woman very much in control of her life and career. I mean, I have to say, she is still unbelievable in that regard. She is so astute. She is so smart. Working with her is a joy because you're dealing with someone who is really professional and cares.\n\nhttp://www.papermag.com/madonna-documentary-truth-or-dare-1982808566.html\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/nyregion/new-york-today-madonna-in-new-york.html?_r=0\n\nwhile she never threatened to become the next Meryl Streep, Madonna’s acting might not actually be that bad.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/21/madonna-acting-career-metrograph-new-york-retrospective"
