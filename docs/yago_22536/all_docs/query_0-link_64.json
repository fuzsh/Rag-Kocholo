        "text": "Madonna is back at work on her biopic, as the iconic singer confirmed on social media.\n\nMadonna shared on Instagram that she is back writing the film’s screenplay, with the feature now titled “Who’s That Girl,” a classic reference in the annals of Madonna lore. “Who’s That Girl” is also the title of James Foley’s 1987 comedy feature (which marked one of Madonna’s first movie roles and co-starred Griffin Dunne), a soundtrack single for the film, and Madonna’s world tour that same year.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nCriterion Channel's August 2024 Lineup Includes Paul Thomas Anderson and Philip Seymour Hoffman Retrospectives\n\n'Crumb Catcher' Review: Debut Feature Director Chris Skotchdopole Serves a Painful, Promising Mess\n\n“I Need A-lot of Bandz to make this………..OKAY,” Madonna captioned, adding, “Story of my life.”\n\nIt literally is: The songwriter has been in development on her biopic for years, with Diablo Cody first co-writing the screenplay, then titled “Little Sparrow.” In 2021, Madonna collaborated with Erin Cressida Wilson, who is now credited on the rewritten version. Armed with a fresh script and a new title, Madonna also announced she will direct the feature.\n\nJulia Garner was announced to portray the Grammy winner before the original incarnation of the project was shelved. Julia Fox also confirmed to IndieWire that she was cast as Debi Mazar. However, Madonna opted instead to go on tour to promote her new album rather than shoot the film, which was said to culminate with Madonna’s 1990 Blonde Ambition tour. The feature was officially shelved by Universal in January 2023.\n\n“I know it was gonna be either tour or movie and then she went on tour,” Fox told IndieWire. “So I don’t know when the movie will be picking back up again or when they’re going to start working on it again. But I didn’t hear anything. I actually don’t know.”\n\nShe added, “I mean, I’d still love to but I genuinely don’t know. They are going back, you know, when, when they’re like 19 and they first meet. I feel like I might have already aged out of that casting, but we’ll see.”\n\nMadonna’s own filmography has been remembered recently, with Spike Lee telling Vulture that he “didn’t give a fuck” about Madonna’s reputation at the time of casting her in 1996 film “Girl 6” alongside Mazar. At the time, Madonna’s acting career was in a downward spiral after her two box office flops, “Body of Evidence” and “Dangerous Game.”\n\n“I didn’t give a fuck,” Lee said. “She’s who I had in mind, and she wanted to do it, so that was it. She’s a pro.”\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nGuillermo del Toro's Favorite Movies: 56 Films the Director Wants You to See\n\n'Song of the South': 14 Things to Know About Disney's Most Controversial Movie\n\nThe 55 Best LGBTQ Movies and TV Shows Streaming on Netflix Right Now"
