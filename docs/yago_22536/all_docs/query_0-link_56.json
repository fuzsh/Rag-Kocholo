        "text": "1984: “Like a Virgin”\n\nThe Queen of Pop's second album, Like a Virgin, scored global success. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number three and stayed within the top ten for the next month. She is performing it here in dramatic fashion at MTV's Video Music Awards in 1984.\n\n1990: Blonde Ambition Tour\n\nA very blonde and buff Madonna embarked on her Blonde Ambition Tour in 1990, always seeking new ways to shock her audiences. As one of the major style icons of the time, Madge pushed the fashion line forward, always dressing to impress.\n\n1998: Motherhood\n\nMadonna's look turned conservate when she became a mom, reintroducing her hippy-style blond locks. She gave birth to daughter Lourdes in 1996, fathered by her fitness trainer Carlos Leon. The couple ended their relationship in Dec. 1998. She gave birth to her son Rocco Ritchie in 2000 with her film producer husband, Guy Ritchie. In 2006, she filed adoption papers for David Banda, whom she adopted from an orphanage in Malawi. Three years later, the singer adopted Chifundo ‘Mery’ James, her fourth child.\n\n1992: Bondage Babe\n\nThe pop star became a \"bondage babe\" when releasing her Erotica album in 1992. The accompanying book, Sex, sold 1.5 million copies in a week.\n\nThe \"Erotica\" music video was deemed too provocative for MTV, which ultimately banned the clip.\n\n2000: The Next Big Thing\n\nMadonna starred in the film The Next Big Thing with Rupert Everett. Her character agrees to have a one night stand with her gay friend and raise the resulting baby together. She contributed two songs for the film’s soundtrack, “Time Stood Still” and the international hit “American Pie.”\n\n1999: Grammys\n\nThe pop sensation went brunette before winning her first Grammy after 16 years in the music industry. She took home four trophies that night, including Best Pop Album, Best Short Form Music Video and Best Dance Recording for Ray of Light.\n\n2004: Reinvention Tour\n\nThe 2004 Reinvention Tour was the performer’s sixth concert tour supporting her ninth album, American Life. The costumes revolved around the concept of re-invention. It was during this time that the singer became infatuated with Jewish mysticism and self-reflection.\n\nThe tour was chronicled in her documentary, I’m Going to Tell You a Secret, premiering on MTV the next year.\n\n2004: Children’s Books\n\nMadonna has written 16 children’s books since her first titled, The English Roses, in 2003. Here, she is reading from her fourth book to children from the St. Winifred's school in London during the book launch for The Adventures of Abdi in 2004.\n\n2008: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nThe Material Girl was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2008. Justin Timberlake, with whom she had recently collaborated with on the song “4 Minutes”, presented her with the award. Although she did not perform, Madonna asked fellow Hall of Fame inductees and fellow Michigan natives, The Stooges, to perform her songs “Burning Up” and “Ray of Light.”\n\n2007: Malawi, Africa\n\nHolding son David Banda in her arms and with daughter Lourdes by her side, Madonna is photographed at the Home of Hope orphanage in Mchinji, Malawi in April 2007.\n\n2005: Documentary Premiere\n\nMadonna hit the red carpet at the premiere of her documentary, I’m Going to Tell You a Secret, which was shown on MTV in Oct. 2005. The film chronicled her Reinvention World Tour."
