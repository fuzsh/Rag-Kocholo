        "text": "by Brady Walters (aka Bijou Clochard)\n\nA couple of birthdays ago, my good friend Audrey bought me a funky\n\ndeconstructed sweatshirt from some Lower East Side designer, the front of which reads:\n\nMADONNA IS MY MOTHER.. Normally, one would dub this piece of tongue-in-“chic”\n\napparel as ironic, but as my boyfriend pointed out last night on the way home\n\nfrom the world premiere screening of Madonna’s new documentary I’m Going To\n\nTell You A Secret, perhaps that sweatshirt is not all that far off the mark.\n\nOf course, I have a real mother, and she is amazing – one of my best friends\n\nactually. In recent years, it has become more and more apparent just how cool\n\nshe really is. Not only can we talk about almost anything, but I just found\n\nout last week that she watches both Reno 911 and Nip/Tuck, two rather risqué\n\ncable programs that have been among my favorites for the last few years.\n\nHowever, there is one topic in which we have rarely met on common ground – Madonna.\n\nI have been a relatively huge Madonna fan since I was 14 years old. These\n\nwere the days of the “Like A Prayer” video scandal, the conical bras and\n\ngyrations of the Blond Ambition Tour, and the pansexual 1-2-3 punch of “Justify My\n\nLove”, “Sex”, and “Erotica”.. My obsession with a woman who pushed the\n\nboundaries of societal decency further and further with each video, movie, and tour did\n\nnot sit well with my mother, and although I believe that she is now confident\n\nthat she has raised a well-adjusted son with a good heart and a certain level\n\nof intelligence, I think she has always been a little wary of the inspiration\n\nthat has been generated from my idolization of Madonna’s varied projects. I’ve tried countless times in the past to sway my mother’s opinion, especially\n\nsince most of the time she has based her judgment on material she hasn’t even\n\nseen. Aside from Madonna’s Golden Globe Award winning turn in Evita, I have\n\nhad no such luck, and that.s surprising considering my mother’s avid\n\nadmiration of the dance, dramatic, and visual arts aspects that have permeated Madonna’s work throughout the years.\n\nBut there is hope.\n\nLast night, flash bulbs popped, and Madonna fans young and old cheered\n\nvoraciously as the Queen Bee of Pop Culture herself hosted the one-and-only\n\ntheatrical screening of what could easily be renamed Truth Or Dare – The Sequel. But\n\nI do not want to confuse you. This is not the same Madonna. Truth Or Dare\n\nwas filmed in 1990 during the colorful, and controversial, Blond Ambition Tour.\n\nThat was before Lourdes and Rocco, before the wedding to Guy Ritchie, and\n\nperhaps most noticeably, before Madonna’s involvement with Kaballah. I’m Going\n\nTo Tell You A Secret was filmed just last year, as Madonna and camp performed\n\nthe wildly successful Re-Invention Tour to sold-out crowds around the planet.\n\nLucky me . I won tickets through MTV to attend Tuesday night’s premiere\n\nscreening right here in New York City. Yes, it was great to be just a few rows\n\naway from the superstar as she addressed the crowd, introduced her movie, and\n\nhumbly thanked us fans for sticking by her through “thick and thin”. I had\n\ntears in my eyes, no doubt.\n\nClick on the “full Article” option to read the full review.\n\nBut Madonna’s gracious appearance at the theater was\n\nreally just the warm up; the actual film was the real star of the night.\n\n(Before I go on, for those of you who were wondering, I have seen her this\n\nclose before. “Pit-passes” to a Re-Invention Tour show in New Jersey last year\n\nand the legendary Roseland performance in 2000 assured me of that. But, I\n\nhave never just seen her stand still in one place, just talking. Doug and I\n\nboth agreed that she looks radiantly more beautiful in person than she does on\n\nany television set. Unfortunately for me, out of fear of getting my camera\n\nconfiscated like at the Roseland gig, I left it at home and was not able to take\n\nmy own pictures. Hook me up, Jeannie!)\n\nDuring a recent TV appearance, Madonna stated that the impetus behind the new film was simply to provide an update of what she started back in 1991. At\n\nthe time, Madonna promoted Truth Or Dare as a “slice of life”, a movie that was\n\nto present not only the insane existence of a pop superstar, but also those\n\nof her dancers, family members, and friends. Madonna had said that anyone\n\ncould watch the film and relate to it on some level – that even though it was\n\ntouted as a “Madonna movie”, her involvement was inconsequential as it could have\n\nbeen about anyone dealing with the highly pressurized chaos involved in\n\ntaking a Broadway-caliber show on the road throughout the world. Truth Or Dare was\n\nmeant to expose and educate the masses on topics such as homophobia,\n\nalcoholism, and celebrity. It was also designed to provoke, and if the rumors are\n\ntrue, partially staged to outrage the masses of “middle America”. Madonna\n\nperforming her rendition of oral sex on an innocent Evian bottle during a round of\n\nthe game that gave the movie its title will forever go down in history as one of Madge’s most popular “shocking” moments. But it was this level of hype\n\nand controversy that eventually muddled Madonna’s supposed intentions with the\n\nmovie.\n\nInstead of concentrating on the various “slices of life” and personal\n\ninteractions represented within her tour crew, the media zeroed in on Madonna’s own outrageous antics and her “one-woman crusade to change the world” through provocation. In the end, it seemed as though Madonna was possibly just\n\nstoking the flames of her own ego.\n\nBut that was then, and this is now. Although both films share a similar look – full-color stage performances contrasted with black-and-white backstage\n\nfootage, I’m Going To Tell You A Secret succeeds where Truth Or Dare failed.\n\nBelieve it or not, while watching the film, I “even as a self-proclaimed\n\nMadonna-holic” was able to completely get past the fact that it was Madonna, the\n\nworld renown, and highly-successful “Pop Goddess” up there on the big screen.\n\nSure, there were moments that were pure “Diva“, but for the most part, the\n\nmovie could have easily been about any average person dealing with the daily\n\nstruggle over how to balance work and family, joy and sadness, love and loss.\n\nTruth Or Dare 2.0 is really about a surprisingly humble woman who is trying to grow and expand her learning of life, and those around her who give and receive\n\nelements of that sought after knowledge. The Madonna of 1991 was clearly not\n\nafraid to let the world see her underbelly, warts and all, whereas the Madonna\n\nof 2005 is not afraid to laugh at herself while unashamedly exposing her\n\nmeticulous journey from darkness to what she consistently refers to as “the light”..\n\nI was highly impressed simply as a former college film student. Director\n\nJonas Akerlund (who helmed Madge’s video clips for “Ray Of Light” and “Music”.)\n\nhas done a brilliant job of presenting all sides to the kinetic story. His\n\nediting (most likely somewhat supervised by Madonna herself) thankfully leaves\n\nin jokes and potentially hard-to-digest footage concerning Madonna.s\n\never-growing devotion to Kaballah, a mystical off-shoot of Judaism which Madonna\n\nrepeatedly says throughout the film is not about religion at all. I was pleased to\n\nsee that although the film uses high-octane performance footage, charming\n\nhumor, and exquisite globe-trotting cinematography to build towards what could easy\n\nbe described as a sermon about the importance of spirituality, Akerlund did\n\nnot back down with the fact that not everyone in the world agrees with the way\n\nMadonna lives her life, no matter how well Kaballah may work for her.\n\nSimilarly, it was refreshing that the comments that disappointed daughter Lourdes\n\nmakes about missing her mother while she works so feverishly on tour were not\n\nleft on the cutting room floor. (By the way, the eight year old speaks perfect\n\nFrench and even tutors her mother on the subject.)\n\nIt has been said that good movies are supposed to make you think, and great\n\nmovies should even elicit anger. Unexpectedly, somewhere in between the witty\n\nquips and shots of an impeccably glamorous Madonna taking her cast of dancers\n\nto an elegant piano recital in Paris, I became infuriated. You see, fourteen\n\nyears ago when Truth Or Dare was released, the hype and attention was\n\ndeafening. The film opened to great reviews and its per screen box office take was\n\ncertainly impressive. But in today’s polarized climate, will not even open in any sort of wide theatrical release. Those in\n\nthe know believe it just wouldn.t sell. They are probably right. Madonna’s\n\ncontroversial video for her 2003 single “American Life”, which was ultimately\n\npulled by the star herself due to its graphic portrayal of wartime violence,\n\nis featured bravely here. In fact, if memory serves, striking footage of\n\namputee soldiers that had been banished from all previous censored versions of the\n\nvideo finally make their debut here. Add to the mix a meaty dose of Michael\n\nMoore and Madonna supporting each other’s political courage and you have a\n\nfilm that probably wouldn’t go over too well with heartland audiences. And that\n\nis what is so frustrating – the hypocrisy of our society. When Madonna\n\nfellates a water bottle, the world flocks to watch – and then condemns her for doing\n\nso – but when Madonna has a poignantly positive message of peace, love, and\n\ngoodwill to share, there is doubt as to whether anybody will find it\n\ninteresting.\n\nThankfully, this is not the case. The film may a bit on the long side, but\n\nit is entirely engrossing throughout, even when Madonna and Akerlund hand over\n\nprecious screen time, both on and off stage, to the show.s talented dancers,\n\nall of which emerge as Madonna’s second string of children. In fact, one of\n\nthe more tender moments occurs when Madonna woefully apologizes on the last\n\nnight of the tour for trading party time with her dance troupe in favor of face\n\ntime with her actual family. (She’s clearly come along way since her first\n\ndocumentary in which she infamously invited each of her young dancers to undress\n\nin her bed!) The most delicate moments in Secret, however, came courtesy of\n\nMadonna’s father (also a Truth Or Dare alum), who is filmed working at his\n\nwinery in Michigan and talking candidly about the difficulty of raising his large\n\nfamily. Believe me, there was nary a dry eye in the house after watching\n\nscenes of Papa Ciccone attending his most famous daughter’s show in Chicago."
