Madonna's acting career has attracted largely mixed reviews and reception at best.[1][2][3]\n\nHer first foray documented into screen acting, is a one-minute student film called The Egg (filmed around 1974 or 1976).[4][5] In 1979, before her breakthrough, she made her acting debut in the low-budget feature A Certain Sacrifice; its release was delayed for several years until 1985 to capitalize on the popularity of her second studio album, Like a Virgin.[6] That same year, she made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the film Vision Quest; and garnered commercial and critical success for the title role in Susan Seidelman's Desperately Seeking Susan, which was her first major screen role.[7][8] The following year, she made her theatrical debut in David Rabe's Goose and Tom-Tom and her first commercial for Mitsubishi in Japan.[9][10] She also starred opposite her then-husband actor Sean Penn in the adventure drama Shanghai Surprise (1986), which was panned by critics and earned Madonna her first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.[11] Her follow-up films Who's That Girl (1987) and Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989) were also critical and commercial failures.[12][13] She teamed with Pepsi-Cola in 1989 for a commercial to launch the single \"Like a Prayer\", but the commercial was revoked and her contract with Pepsi cancelled due to controversy surrounding the song's music video.[14]\n\nIn 1990, Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy, an adaption of Chester Gould's comic strip starring the character of the same name.[15] Starring opposite Beatty and Al Pacino, Madonna received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress.[16] The following year, the documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare showcased Madonna behind the scenes of her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour and became the highest-grossing documentary of all time at that point.[17] She also received positive reviews for her role in the ensemble sports comedy-drama A League of Their Own (1992), which centered on a women's baseball team during World War II.[18] However, her performance in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence was widely panned, and the film was a commercial failure.[19] She cameoed in several films over the next few years, such as Blue in the Face (1995) and Spike Lee's Girl 6 (1996),[20] until starring in the 1996 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Evita. Her performance as Eva Perón was acclaimed by critics and won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.[21]\n\nFollowing a musical comeback in the late 1990s, Madonna again returned to acting with the romantic comedies The Next Best Thing (2000) and Swept Away (2002), the latter of which was a remake of Lina Wertmüller's Italian film of the same name directed by her then-husband director Guy Ritchie.[22][23] Both films were critical and commercial failures, with Swept Away earning Madonna another Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.[24][25] She also had a cameo appearance in and performed the theme song of the James Bond film Die Another Day (2002)[26] and guest starred on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace in April 2003.[27] In 2006, she made her final major acting appearance to date with a voice role in Arthur and the Invisibles.\n\nIn the 2000s, Madonna has largely moved away from acting to focus on roles behind the camera. She served as executive producer of the teen comedy action film Agent Cody Banks (2003), as well as its sequel the following year. She made her directorial debut with the comedy-drama Filth and Wisdom (2008),[28] and followed up with the biographical film W.E. (2011).[29][30] Madonna has also focused on projects focusing on artistic freedom and human rights, producing and writing the documentary I Am Because We Are[31] and co-directing the short film secretprojectrevolution (2013) with Steven Klein.[32]\n\nFeature films\n\n[edit]\n\nKey † Indicates a cameo appearance ‡ Indicates a documentary appearance\n\nMadonna film appearances Year Title Role Credit(s) Ref. 1985 Vision Quest Club singer † Actress [7]\n\n[33] Desperately Seeking Susan Susan Thomas [8]\n\n[34] A Certain Sacrifice Bruna [6] 1986 Shanghai Surprise Gloria Tatlock [35]\n\n[36] 1987 Who's That Girl Nikki Finn [12]\n\n[37] 1989 Bloodhounds of Broadway Hortense Hathaway [13]\n\n[38] 1990 Dick Tracy Breathless Mahoney [15]\n\n[39] 1991 Madonna: Truth or Dare Herself ‡\n\nAppearance\n\nexecutive producer\n\n[40]\n\n[41] Shadows and Fog Marie † Actress [42]\n\n[43] 1992 A League of Their Own Mae Mordabito [18]\n\n[44] 1993 Body of Evidence Rebecca Carlson [45]\n\n[19] Dangerous Game (aka Snake Eyes) Sarah Jennings [46]\n\n[47] 1995 Blue in the Face Singing telegram girl † [48]\n\n[49] Four Rooms (\"The Missing Ingredient\" segment) Elspeth [50]\n\n[51] 1996 Girl 6 Boss No. 3 † [52]\n\n[53] Evita [54]\n\n[55] 2000 The Next Best Thing Abbie Reynolds [22]\n\n[56] 2002 Swept Away Amber Leighton [23]\n\n[57] Die Another Day Verity † [26]\n\n[58] 2005 I'm Going to Tell You a Secret Herself ‡\n\nAppearance\n\nexecutive producer\n\n[59] 2006 Arthur and the Invisibles Princess Selenia Actress (voice) [60]\n\n[61] 2008 Filth and Wisdom —\n\nDirector\n\nexecutive producer\n\nscreenwriter\n\n[28]\n\n[62] I Am Because We Are Herself ‡\n\nAppearance\n\nnarrator\n\nscreenwriter\n\nproducer\n\n[31] 2011 W.E. —\n\nDirector\n\nproducer\n\nscreenwriter\n\n[29]\n\n[30] 2021 Madame X Herself ‡\n\nAppearance\n\nscreenwriter\n\nproducer\n\n[63] TBD Who's That Girl —\n\nDirector\n\nscreenwriter\n\n[64]\n\nShort films\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the music videos, see Madonna videography.\n\nMadonna short film work Year Title Role Medium Notes Ref. 1992 The Making of Sex Herself VHS\n\nAppearance\n\nexecutive producer\n\n[65] 2001 The Hire: Star Superstar Internet Actress [66] 2005 Confessions on a Promo Tour Herself AOL Appearance [67] 2006 Confessions Tour: Behind the Scenes DVD [68] 2010 Sticky & Sweet Tour: Behind the Scenes DVD [69] 2012 Inside the DNA of MDNA YouTube [70] 2013 secretprojectrevolution Un­known BitTorrent\n\nActress\n\ndirector\n\nproducer\n\nscreenwriter\n\n[32] 2016 Qandeel Baloch: A Very Short Story — YouTube Narrator [71] 2017 Her-Story Un­known Internet Actress [72] 2019 World of Madame X Herself Amazon Prime Appearance [73] 2023 The Enlightenment Un­known YouTube [74][75]\n\nTheatrical plays\n\n[edit]\n\nMadonna stage work Year Title Role Playwright Stage Ref. 1986 Goose and Tom-Tom Lorraine Lincoln Center Theater [9] 1988 Speed-the-Plow Karen Royale Theatre [76] 2002 Up for Grabs Loren Wyndham's Theatre [77]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the televised music performances, see List of Madonna live performances.\n\nMadonna television appearances Year Title Role Episode Notes Ref. 1985 Saturday Night Live\n\nHost (Herself)\n\nvarious sketches\n\n\"Madonna/Simple Minds\" (Season 11, Episode 1) Actress [78] 1986 Herself (opening intro) \"Sigourney Weaver/Buster Poindexter\" (Season 12, Episode 1) [79] 1991 Herself (\"Wayne's World\" sketch) \"Delta Burke/Chris Isaak\" (Season 16, Episode 19) [80] 1992 Liz Rosenberg (\"Coffee Talk\" sketch) \"Roseanne & Tom Arnold/Red Hot Chili Peppers\" (Season 17, Episode 14) [81] 1993\n\n(opening intro)\n\nMusical Guest (Herself)\n\n\"Harvey Keitel/Madonna\" (Season 18, Episode 11) [82] 2003 Will & Grace Liz \"Dolls and Dolls\" [27] 2004 30 Days Until I'm Famous — Television film Executive producer [83] 2008 Alyx — Executive producer [84] 2009 Saturday Night Live Herself (\"Deep House Dish\" sketch) \"Ryan Reynolds/Lady Gaga\" (Season 35, Episode 2) Actress [85] 2013 Saturday Night Live Herself (\"The Barry Gibb Talk Show\" sketch) \"Jimmy Fallon/Justin Timberlake\" (Season 39, Episode 10) Actress [86] 2023 Lil Nas X: Long Live Montero Herself (cameo) — [87] 2024 Gordon Ramsay's Food Stars Herself (voice on her personal chef's phone) — [88]\n\nCommercials\n\n[edit]\n\nMadonna in commercials Year(s).
