        "text": "Over the last two decades, Madonna has reinvented herself several times.\n\nShe's at it again, says The Early Show national correspondent Tracy Smith, with a new documentary offering some surprising insights into her world and her spritual evolution.\n\nThe film premiered Tuesday night, and Smith was there.\n\nMadonna speaks about her latest song, motherhood, her horseback riding accident, and more, in an exclusive interview with Tracy Smith.Click here to see what she said. \"Blink,\" says Smith, \"and you'd think it's the '90s: Madonna, a crowd of screaming fans, and a new documentary.\"\n\nThe pop icon joked during a chat with Smith at the premiere, \"I was gonna call this movie 'Truth or Dare, Part Two,' but I decided to be a little bit more creative.\"\n\nThe original \"Truth or Dare\" came out more than a decade ago, following Madonna on her \"Blonde Ambition\" tour.\n\nThe new film, called \"I'm Going To Tell You a Secret,\" offers a behind-the-scenes look at her 2004 \"Reinvention\" tour.\n\n\"Often, people in the entertainment business keep their truths to themselves; their secrets,\" Madonna observed, to Smith. \"So, hopefully, I've revealed some of those things in the movie.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, it has a few controversial moments, including one asserting most priests are gay.\n\nSome Catholics are already saying they're upset about it, Smith reports.\n\nWhat would Madonna say to them?\n\n\"They haven't seen the movie yet,\" she replied to Smith. \"They can have an opinion after they see the movie.\"\n\nBut, says Smith, if you're expecting the raunchiness of \"Truth or Dare,\" think again.\n\nIn one scene, a man tells Madonna, \"I don't really believe in God.\"\n\n\"That really hurts me to hear that,\" Madonna responds.\n\nThis Madonna, Smith says, is \"The Spiritual Girl,\" not \"The Material Girl.\"\n\n\"To me,\" Madonna remarks in the documentary, \"the beast is the modern world that we live in. The material world. The physical world. The world of illusion that we think is real. We live for it. We're enslaved by it. And it will ultimately be our undoing.\"\n\nMTV News correspondent John Norris tells The Early Show co-anchor Harry Smith he liked the new film \"a lot. In a different way than 'Truth or Dare.' Some of the hedonism that's there in 'Truth or Dare' is replaced by a more spiritual Madonna, a Madonna who's a wife and mother now, definitely a different view of her, but it's a pretty compelling movie.\"As for her apparent move away from her \"Material Girl\" image, \"(The Jewish spiritual movement of) Kaballah is a big part of it, I think. She's definitely evolved, as a person, and as an individual, and it's reflected in her work. And you can certainly see in this film that the things that were important to her once (aren't as important anymore).\n\n\"There's a great point in the movie where she says, 'You know, I had a lot of fun back then. I'm not going to say I didn't have fun. But fun can be overrated.' And I think she's discovered that other things matter.\"\n\nDoes that seeming evolution surprise Norris?\n\n\"You have to sort of wonder, what was the alternative, if there wasn't a family. She says she felt sort of like a spinning wheel 15 years ago. She had a good time, but some days she'd feel like, 'Hey, this is great.' Other times, she would feel like something is lacking. Obviously, she found her path.\"\n\nAsked whether there's any reflection in the movie on Madonna being a very strict mother, Norris says, \"You do see the kids. I think it's the first chance people have ever had to hear the kids speak. They're so great and charming and adorable and articulate. Whatever she's done, she seems to be doing it right. You get a good view of the kids.\"\n\nNorris describes Madonna's new album, \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" as \"wall-to-wall dance music; the most dance-oriented thing she's done, at 47. More power to her. It's gonna do well in the clubs. We'll see how it does on radio.\"\n\nIs Madonna as relevant or important as she was 20 years ago?\n\n\"I think,\" Norris says, \"to a lot of people, she is, and (she) even (has) a certain more relevance now.\""
