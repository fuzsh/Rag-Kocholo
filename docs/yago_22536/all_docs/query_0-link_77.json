        "text": "Madonna is working on her biopic once again.\n\nThe 65-year-old Queen of Pop's plans for a movie about her life were placed on hold last year but she's now revealed she is currently writing a new draft script for the project, which will be titled ‘Who’s That Girl’ in a nod to the singer’s 1987 movie and song of the same name.\n\nMadonna took to Instagram and posted a collection of photos of herself working on the script with the caption: “I Need A-lot of Bandz to make this ……….. OKAY. (Story of my life) (sic).”\n\nThe flick - which will be penned and directed by Madonna - was announced in 2020, and had actress Julia Garner in the starring role, with Deadline reporting the 'Ozark' star is still on board for the project.\n\nWriters Diablo Cody and Erin Cressida Wilson were also brought on to help the ‘Like A Virgin’ hitmaker with the script and screenplay.\n\nHowever, in January 2023, it was revealed the film had been paused indefinitely at Universal Pictures.\n\nAfter the movie was shelved, Madonna went on her ‘Celebration Tour’ in October 2023 to mark four decades in the music industry, but reportedly resumed work on the project once she got back home in June in the hopes she could finalise the script with Universal.\n\nAn industry insider previously told The Sun newspaper’s Bizarre column: “Madonna has only just finished her tour but in her mind it is on to the next project and fulfilling her dream of getting the biopic made.\n\n“Julia is still her lead actress and they have remained in touch for the past year, talking through ideas. They are committed to creating some magic.”\n\nThe ‘Vogue’ chart-topper had explained she wanted to both direct and write the movie because she wanted complete control over the project.\n\nShe told Variety: “I've had an extraordinary life, I must make an extraordinary film.\n\n“It was also a pre-emptive strike because a lot of people were trying to make movies about me. Mostly misogynistic men.\n\n“So I put my foot in the door and said, ‘No one's going to tell my story, but me.’”"
