Madonna attended the Harry Potter premiere with daughter Lourdes

Madonna has revealed that the shooting of the latest documentary about her has made her want to follow film director husband Guy Ritchie behind the camera.

"I would love to direct," she said. "I felt very inspired by making this movie and I learned a lot about film-making.

"I would like to do it on my own next time," continued the singer, whose film I'm Going to Tell You a Secret will be shown on Channel 4 on 1 December.

Her latest album, Confessions on a Dance Floor, is top of the UK charts.

Madonna's comments are part of an interview due to be screened on Channel 4.

'Incredible ballerina'

In the programme, conducted by TV presenter Dermot O'Leary, the mother of two speaks proudly about her nine-year-old daughter Lourdes and five-year-old son, Rocco.

Viewers will see her describe Lourdes as "very musical".

"She sings quite well and she's an incredible ballerina," she says.

Earlier this month Madonna attended the London premiere of the new Harry Potter film with Lourdes, also known as Lola.

There, she revealed, her daughter was left speechless after a chance encounter with one of its stars, Emma Watson.

"In the middle of the movie she had to go to the bathroom," she told O'Leary.

"Hermione was in there washing her hands and Lola's jaw hit the ground."

But Madonna refused to discuss her recent riding accident, which left her with a broken collarbone and three cracked ribs.

"I don't want to go there - I get flashbacks," she said.

"I'm just starting to feel better."
