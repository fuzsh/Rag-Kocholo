        "text": "Benny The Butcher has all the praise for the skills of his fellow New York MC, Lloyd Banks.\n\nIn a video that started making the internet rounds on Monday (June 10), the Griselda rapper gave Banks his flowers for his clever wordplay.\n\n“That n-gga Banks one of the top n-ggas ever with bars,” Benny said. “That’s one rap n-gga n-ggas don’t play with. It’s certain rap n-ggas n-ggas don’t play with. He got a million lines [where] you’ll be like, ‘How the fuck I didn’t think of that?’”\n\nYou can view the clip below.\n\nBenny The Butcher has worked with plenty of big names in his career, but there are still a few heavy-hitters on his wish list.\n\nIn a recent interview with Amazon Music, the Buffalo, New York native reflected on his journey from underground rapper to major label star with dozens of projects and mainstream recognition to his name.\n\nWhile discussing the topic of confidence, Benny praised Tyler, The Creator’s self-assuredness and creative versatility, saying: “He do what he want to do because he realize it’s him — it’s nothing else.”\n\nWhen asked about a potential collaboration with the Odd Future founder — who is no stranger to the Griselda camp, having previously worked with Westside Gunn, Daringer and Conductor Williams — Benny had only positive things to say.\n\n“I would love to work with him. I wonder how that would sound,” he said. “He can rap all type of ways.”\n\nLater on, Benny The Butcher highlighted other artists outside of his immediate circle he feels connected with, naming Kendrick Lamar and Killer Mike.\n\n“Man, definitely guys who I’ve been naming like [Lil] Wayne, Kendrick … Killer Mike. He’s been going crazy lately,” he said. “38 Spesh — me and him about to do a project. He’s crazy.”\n\nHe added: “Just the guys who going to keep me sharp.\n\nWhile Benny The Butcher has yet to work with Kendrick Lamar, he did borrow Lamar’s “We Cry Together” beat back in 2022 following the mass shooting in his native Buffalo that killed 10 African-Americans.\n\nRenaming the track “Welcome to the States,” the Griselda goon lamented the continued racism, discrimination and violence that plagues the U.S."
