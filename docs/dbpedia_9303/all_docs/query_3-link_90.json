        "text": "Lloyd Banks opens up on his relationship with 50 Cent.\n\nIt’s no secret that the G-Unit was a force to be reckon with during their time. The group split, 50 Cent had some choice words towards Banks. In his book, Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter, 50 Cent called Banks ‘lazy.’ During a recent interview with GQ, Banks said they are all good.\n\nWhen asked about their relationship, he explains, “It’s the same. We’re brothers,” Banks told the outlet. “We came into this together—we’re never all going to be doing the same thing at the same time at this point in our careers. You know what I mean? The last conversation I had with 50 was basically him telling me to get whatever I left out there. Because some hiatuses were planned and some weren’t.”"
