Things are looking better for Lloyd Banks with each new release, which Getting To It Mandatory has proven yet again. It's worthy addition to the impressive body of work Lloyd Banks has been developing over the years. We're looking forward to hearing what's next.\n\nQuotable Lyrics\n\n\"Ammo in the car still, diamonds out the window\n\nGiant, make a regular car look like a limo\n\nI'm hood, so everything ain't all good\n\nCaught in the middle I should\n\nHold down my city how could\n\nYou fuck around with me? Why would\n\nYou seek attention? I'm like a lion out the fence when\n\nI'm faced with tension, the audience is as suspensing\""
