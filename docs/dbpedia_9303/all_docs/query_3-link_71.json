        "text": "Benny The Butcher Has Worked With Banks Multiple Times\n\n\"They make these boxes with certain artists like me and Jadakiss,\" Banks told the outlet in 2022. \"We haven’t been pushed out of them boxes. I don’t know what you want to attribute that to, but I’m grateful we passed the test of time.\" The rapper also noted that he's going to continue to put distance between him and his peers as he gets older and refines his craft. \"Moving forward, I feel like my subject matter alone is gonna put me in a different stratosphere,\" he asserted. \"I care more about my sh*t than anybody else does.\" Hard to argue with him or Benny."
