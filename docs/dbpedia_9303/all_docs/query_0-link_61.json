        "text": "“I like 50 Cent, he reminds me of Spongebob, and Tony Yayo is Blue’s Clues, and Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer, they’re my friends, psyche”\n\nWho remembers that little girl saying those aforementioned words?\n\nIt seemed like when this beef started developing you had to choose a side: you were either with G-Unit or you were G-Unot. Being from the West Coast and California a lot of people felt their loyalty stood with Game, and they rode with him. That’s what I noticed occurred at my high school. A majority of the people was pro-Game. Maybe it was because he was looked at as the next big thing and the savior of West Coast hip-hop.\n\nOnce “300 Bars and Runnin’” and the accompanied mixtape dropped, it seemed everyone was listening to it. It spread rapidly throughout my city, so I could only imagine how it did in the rest of the state. I remember once it dropped, my brother would go around bumping the mixtape in his Nissan X-Terra. I was in the passenger seat and could feel the bass on that song through his subwoofer and speakers.\n\nHe soon flipped-flopped from a G-Unit fan that had one of those heavyweight hoodies to a full G-Unot stan. I remember one time he went to Las Vegas with his friends. He came back with shirts made with “G-Unot” on it. It was the exact same font as the G-Unit logo, the only difference was that the “not” was in red.\n\nWith every beat change, it was like an event. Each beat made you bob your head. I think that’s one of the things that made this song memorable and legendary was the genius idea to use different beats for different parts of the song. The beat selection complemented the lyrics Game was spitting. For example, in one of the Lloyd Banks’ disses, the beat switches to Banks’ “I’m So Fly.” Also, he’d pick a beat that went with the flow. When he decided to slow it down, during his slaughter of Young Buck, he used Easy E’s “Real Muthaphuckkin G’s.” It was too dope.\n\nThe mixtape wasn’t entirely focused on “300 Bars,” well maybe it was, but other songs were on the mixtape. The mixtape contained other G-Unit disses like “Down,” “Poison Bananas,” “Lay Low” and “Play The Game” to name a few. He didn’t spare any member from the Unit from his fire.\n\nThe other dope thing Game did with this breakthrough mixtape was introducing his new crew. First, he created a short-lived rap group with Long Beach rapper Techniec and Inglewood rapper Eastwood. They group was cool. I fucked with Techniec more than Eastwood to the point where I was hopping Tech success. His mixtape wasn’t too bad either. Unfortunately, he never caught on in the rap game.\n\nAlso, Game went to Philly and found his right hand man, Cyssero. He later changed his rap name to the generic Rock Star. Cyss was heavily featured on this mixtape appearing on a nice amount of the track list.\n\nThe mixtape wasn’t entirely about dissing his former crew. He did other tracks.\n\nHe appeared on R. Kelly’s attempted radio comeback on “Playa’s Only.” Also, he had the “Where I’m From (remix)” featuring a verse from Dr. Dre as both rappers spoke about their hometown of Compton.\n\nThe other was the Justo tribute.\n\nYou could tell by his voice and by the lyrics that it was heartfelt. He appreciated Justo’s contribution to the mixtape and rap game. In the song, Game starts reminiscing about his rap career from the early beginnings to the time of this song.\n\nHis early beginnings trace back to New York and the mixtape scene. He freeestyled and gave it to DJ Clue. Later, he met and hooked up with Kay Slay on a mixtape. He kept grinding and working, picking up beefs and buzz along the way. His buzz later made it’s way towards Dr. Dre, who outbid P Diddy.\n\nHe would go on to met Justo and formed a relationship with him. He eventually blessed Justo with “200 Bars and Runnin’.” Later, as Game was all over the mixtape scene, he was awarded the West Coast Mixtape Artist of the Year in 2005, shortly before Justo died. His buzz kept growing and he eventually dropped a dope debut album before finding himself engaged with this beef.\n\nLet’s just say that song was monumental. It single-handled helped Game’s career after some thought he would fail after being kicked out of G-Unit. Plus, this song can be the premise for arguing that Game actually got the better of the Unit in this beef. The summer of 2005 was an interesting time."
