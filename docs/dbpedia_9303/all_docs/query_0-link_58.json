        "text": "David Darnell Brown (born March 15, 1981), best known by his stage name Young Buck, is an American rapper. He heads his own record label, Cashville Records (formerly G-Unit South), and was a member of the former hip hop group G-Unit.\n\nEarly life\n\nBrown was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Around the age of 12, he began rapping. A few years later, he performed for Brian \"Baby\" Williams, co-founder of Cash Money.\n\nCareer\n\nYoung Buck joined Cash Money in 1997 but left for Juvenile's UTP in 2000. He released two albums with UTP, Born to Be a Thug and The Compilation, before leaving the label in 2003 to join 50 Cent's record label G-Unit.\n\nHis first recording with G-Unit Records was on the 2002 recorded song Blood Hound for 50 Cent's February 2003 debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin'. That same year, Young Buck became a member of G-Unit. He also appeared heavily on rap group G-Unit's 2003 album Beg for Mercy. He replaced G-Unit member Tony Yayo who had been jailed on gun possession charges after recording only two songs for the album.\n\nHis G-Unit Records debut album Straight Outta Cashville was released on August 24, 2004. The album's title alludes to the N.W.A album Straight Outta Compton and is a neologism for Nashville (his hometown). The album produced three singles: \"Let Me In\", \"Shorty Wanna Ride\", and \"Look at Me Now\". The album received little promotion after November. Young Buck was arrested for assault after the VIBE award incident and wasn't able to promote the album for four months until the case was dropped. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA. His second solo album Buck The World followed in 2007.\n\nHe joined the rest of the label's roster on the 2005 collaboration album Get Rich or Die Tryin'.\n\nIn April 2008 he was expelled from the rap group G Unit, remaining with G Unit Records as a solo artist. 50 Cent faulted him for making provocative public statements he would later retract in private and for missing recording sessions. Young Buck released a \"dis\" track insulting 50 Cent and G Unit, 50 Cent responded by releasing a taped phone call in which an emotional Buck was heard crying and asking 50 Cent for help and advice, Buck replied with another \"dis\" track.\n\nIn October he wished to leave G Unit Records but still owed the label two albums and his third album The Rehab was still unreleased. In 2009 he said he still owed one album, The Rehab was released independently in 2010.\n\nIn December 2011 he was still under contract to G-Unit Records and about to lose his assets including his stage name in bankruptcy court, having been unable to record since 2008. He claimed he was close to signing with Cash Money; The Tennessean confirmed a proposed deal that would release him from his G-Unit contract and leave him signed to Cash Money. Cash Money Records CEO Birdman though denied that any deal was in the works.\n\nIn August 2012, Buck stated in an interview with XXL he was no longer signed to G-Unit Records and he would be a free agent when he is released from prison.\n\nOn June 1, 2014, Young Buck was seen at the Summer Jam Concert with 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, and Tony Yayo. It was confirmed later that the group had reformed, adding Kidd Kidd as a new member. The group released their debut EP The Beauty of Independence on August 25, 2014. Young Buck is again making new music with G-Unit and released his mixtape Before The Beast which contains seven songs featuring Kidd Kidd, Lil Boosie, Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks and additional artists. After releasing the mixtape, he released G-unit's second EP The Beast Is G-Unit, which sold approximately 20,000 copies in its first week.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2000, Young Buck was shot multiple times during a home invasion at his home in Nashville. Buck required a blood transfusion at Vanderbilt hospital as a result of the life-threatening injuries.\n\nFinancial problems\n\nBrown filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August, 2010 shortly after an IRS raid on his home. His bankruptcy lawyer later told The City Paper that he was planning to sue Curtis Jackson (50 Cent) and other parties over the record contract dispute.\n\nThe IRS made plans to auction off Young Buck's seized property on October 28, 2010, but his legal counsel filed suit to halt the sale, while simultaneously re-filing a revised bankruptcy petition that no longer referenced a $5 million legal claim against 50 Cent and other parties associated with G Unit.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Young Buck said the studio equipment taken in the raid was \"directly tied to\" his \"ability to generate income in order to reorganize the estate.\" He stated that the seizure of property that belonged to his children had \"created great stress in the home\" and \"within the common law marriage of the debtor plaintiff.\" He told the court he needed to get back the property belonging to the family.\n\nYoung Buck's attorney was able to convince the court that he would be selling real estate worth $638,500 to begin paying the back taxes due. At a hearing on October 26, 2010, plans for the IRS auction were at least temporarily stopped. Young Buck announced the outcome with a tweet.\n\nYoung Buck was under Chapter 7, Young Buck's assets were to be sold and distributed among his creditors.\n\nOn July 25 and 26, a public auction was held at the estate that Young Buck owns. Property to be sold includes watches, a 50 Cent plaque, artwork, a soda machine, his studio equipment, and more.\n\nAlbums\n\nStraight Outta Cashville\n\nMain article: Straight Outta Cashville\n\nAfter being with G-Unit for a little over a year, Young Buck released his debut album, Straight Outta Cashville, a portmanteau reflecting the name of Young Buck's home city, Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nStraight Outta Cashville has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with over 2 million sales in the U.S. and 3.3 million Worldwide.\n\nBuck the World\n\nMain article: Buck the World\n\nYoung Buck's second album, Buck the World was released worldwide on March 27, 2007.\n\nBuck the World debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart with sales of 141,083 in the first week.\n\nThe Rehab\n\nMain article: The Rehab\n\nThe Rehab was released on September 7, 2010. It was Buck's third studio album, released independently by Real Talk Entertainment. Buck had made an earlier claim in which he said that The Rehab would sell a million copies in his first week, though he was still signed to G-Unit/Interscope Records at that time.\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Young Buck discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nStraight Outta Cashville (2004)\n\nBuck the World (2007)\n\nWith G-Unit\n\nBeg for Mercy (2003)\n\nTerminate on Sight (2008)\n\nThe Beauty of Independence (2014)\n\nThe Beast Is G-Unit (2015)\n\nAwards and nominations"
