        "text": "Thousands of young people in the UK were tricked into paying money for non-existent Premier League football tickets last season, according to an estimate by Lloyds Bank.\n\nIt said that football ticketing fraud against its customers was up by around a third compared with the previous season, and warned fans to be on their guard.\n\nBanking industry group UK Finance said that tickets sell out quickly, and criminals can take advantage of people looking for offers.\n\nIt urged social media firms to take more action to stop fraud, and asked customers to be vigilant.\n\nAbout 6,000 UK football fans fell victim to fraud last season, Lloyds Bank estimated.\n\nIt analysed its own fraud figures, and made the estimate about fraud suffered by customers of all banks based on Lloyd's market share - it has about a fifth of UK current accounts.\n\nThat means at least 1,200 Lloyd's customers were scammed last season.\n\nMore than half of the people getting scammed were between 18 and 34 years old.\n\nIts customers lost £177 on average, but for some people it was more than £1,000.\n\nCriminals were most likely to target fans of the biggest teams, and supporters of Arsenal and Liverpool fell victim most often.\n\nAbout 56% of the scams started on Facebook Marketplace, and a further 26% began on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nEarlier this year Lloyds Bank estimated that Taylor Swift fans lost more than £1m to ticket scammers ahead of her UK tour.\n\nHow did the scams work?\n\nCriminals create fake posts on social media or online marketplaces to advertise tickets that do not exist, often with pictures of real tickets to convince the buyer they're genuine.\n\nThe victim is then tricked into making a payment, usually by bank transfer.\n\nOnce the money has been transferred, the fraudster just disappears, and the victim gets nothing in return.\n\nThe problem with bank transfers is they are not designed for online transactions, so it is more difficult to get your money back once it has gone.\n\nThe banks can pay victims back, but the transactions don't have the same protections as buying something with a bank card, for example.\n\nWhat can fans do?\n\nLiz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds Bank, said \"missing out on the big match after falling victim to a ticket scam can be devastating\".\n\nShe advised fans to stick to official ticketing channels and to avoid deals that look too good to be true.\n\nUK Finance said fans should stop and think before parting with any money.\n\nIt said it was fine to refuse requests, and fraudsters will probably try to rush you or panic you into making a decision.\n\nYou get extra protection if you use a credit card to make a purchase between £100 and £30,000.\n\nPremier League advises fans to buy directly from clubs or authorised ticket partners."
