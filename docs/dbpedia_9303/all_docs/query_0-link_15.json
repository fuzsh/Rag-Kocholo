        "text": "The Punchline King is heading back on tour. Today (June 29), Lloyd Banks used his Instagram account to announce his “The Course of the Inevitable Tour,” a 12-city trek titled after his recently released album of the same name. The tour begins with a stop in Atlanta in August before reaching its conclusion in Los Angeles in early September.\n\nIn the caption for the post, which includes a poster for the tour dates, he writes: “Ok! It’s time!! ‘The Course Of The Inevitable Tour’!!! More shows to be added!! Leave the city I should come to in the comments!! Promoters..still [acce]pting offers!”\n\nThe new tour means fans will get the chance to see the Queens lyricist perform new material for the first time in a long time. The last new project Banks released was 2018’s Respect My Name. His last official album was 2010’s H.F.M. 2 (The Hunger for More 2).\n\nAfter he posted a cryptic tweet that seemed to hint toward him possibly retiring three years ago, many fans began to wonder if maybe Banks had lost his love of the game. A short while later, though, he dismissed claims that he was stepping away from the mic. Banks forecasted his comeback when he dropped “Element of Surprise,” a cut from Griselda Records’ Griselda & BSF: Conflicted (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), back in January. Filled with nimble rhyme schemes and deft wordplay, the song was a sign that Banks was still very much in his bag.\n\nThere was a long drought for the Punchline King, but The Course of The Inevitable is a reminder that Banks still has one of the most ferocious pen games in hip-hop, and it includes features from other formidable wordsmiths, including Freddie Gibbs, Benny The Butcher, Roc Marciano, Styles P and more."
