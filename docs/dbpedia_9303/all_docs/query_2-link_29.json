        "text": "(Vanguard)\n\nMindy Smith is a singer-songwriter who seems happy to keep Nashville at arm’s length. She moved there in 1998 and clearly loves country music, but her dazzling 2004 solo debut, “One Moment More,” proved she hadn’t quite gone native. Despite the occasional steel guitar or mandolin, the songs stayed clear of country embellishment. Her supernaturally pretty voice ached, but it didn’t twang.\n\nHer great new album, “Long Island Shores,” is named after the place she grew up (Smithtown, N.Y.), and it includes an unsentimental ode to her current home, “Tennessee.” In it she measures her words and her notes carefully; this is a love song, of sorts, but it’s the kind without promises:\n\nYou may not be what I will always need\n\nBut I call you home\n\nIf I can call you home\n\nYou’re good enough for me\n\nThis kind of precision is part of what makes Ms. Smith’s songs so engrossing. (She can’t even express hometown pride without acknowledging the uncertain future.) It’s there in the way she writes and in the way she sings too. Her voice carves melodies so sharp and fine you can almost see them: a graceful arc up to an airy falsetto, a short drop down to a half-whispered phrase. Sometimes she hits a note and holds it, as if she were staring someone in the eye, refusing to look away.\n\nSomehow the result of all this measuring and carving is another warm, gentle album, one that should attract Norah Jones fans and Trisha Yearwood fans alike. On this album, as on “One Moment More,” the songs are mainly about romantic love or Christian faith or both, and yet she always sounds slightly unsettled. She never stops calculating the distance between where she is and where she wants to be.\n\nThis album doesn’t quite match the quiet intensity of “One Moment More.” Perhaps that was the idea. Unlike that album, this one is full of songwriting collaborations, which means it’s a bit more playful. John Scott Sherrill helped her write “What If the World Stops Turning,” a duet with the country singer-songwriter Buddy Miller. “We’ll just stay here, fallin’ in love,” they harmonize. But then, that doesn’t quite sound like a promise either. KELEFA SANNEH\n\nGLADYS KNIGHT\n\n“Before Me” (Verve)\n\n“It’s up to you, brothers and sisters; you gotta make it better,” declares Gladys Knight in her improvised coda to “God Bless the Child,” arranged as a big-band blues shuffle on “Before Me,” her wonderful album of popular standards. Ms. Knight also appends a comforting tag to “The Man I Love” with her remark, “I think he’s here.” At the end of “Someone to Watch Over Me,” she offers her ideal protector “the key to me.” Such easygoing flourishes are Ms. Knight’s way of injecting a touch of Southern home cooking into a musical feast that’s often served as a catered formal banquet of reheated gourmet entrees. This one might be described as a savory pop-gospel brunch with a jazz dessert.\n\nSince she scored a hit more than 30 years ago with “The Way We Were,” it has been obvious that Ms. Knight possesses the vocal goods to deliver a first-rate album of standards, and in the liner notes she pays tribute to the usual forerunners: Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone and Mahalia Jackson.\n\nThe one Ms. Knight most closely resembles is Washington, whose 1960 hit, “This Bitter Earth,” she covers magnificently in a big throbbing voice filled with warmth and storytelling wisdom. Like Washington, Ms. Knight conveys hurt and healing, heartbreak and forgiveness all at once, all of it grounded in a sturdy maternal resilience.\n\nSeveral of the album’s robust pop-jazz arrangements (with strings) feature the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, the same ensemble that backs Diana Krall. Instrumental solos by Roy Hargrove (flugelhorn), David Fathead Newman (saxophone) and Chris Botti (trumpet) add jazz colors. Her light swinging version of “I’ll Be Seeing You” is one of the most upbeat interpretations of that World War II goodbye song ever recorded. Like everything else on this 12-song collection, it is entirely convincing. STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\nLLOYD BANKS\n\n“Rotten Apple”\n\n(G Unit/Interscope)\n\nIn 2004 Lloyd Banks was a slick-talking Queens rookie who also happened to be 50 Cent’s best-known protégé; success was all but guaranteed. Halfway through his debut, “The Hunger for More,” he stopped to mock his rivals: “Every now and then a new kid gotta win/Yeah, but unfortunately for you, I’m him.”\n\nTwo years later 50 Cent’s G Unit empire isn’t quite so invincible, whereas Southern hip-hop is more dominant than ever. So Lloyd Banks is back with “Rotten Apple,” a grim return to the basics: sturdy beats and half-growled threats. “That ain’t chinchilla, it’s plucked parrot/Part rabbit,” he sneers; even his nonsensical animal rhymes are serious.\n\nBut where “The Hunger for More” was sly and (almost despite itself) infectious, this rather workmanlike CD isn’t so memorable. 50 Cent adds rhymes to two of the best songs: the mixtape favorite “Cake” and the not-quite-hit single “Hands Up.” Lloyd Banks still has that wonderfully thick voice and the same charming fondness for bloody punch lines (“If you come on my property, I ain’t gon’ call/There’ll be a splatter on your shirt, and it ain’t paintball”), but he doesn’t seem to be having as much fun. And he doesn’t seem to have figured out what the alternative might be either. KELEFA SANNEH\n\nLLOYD COLE\n\n“Antidepressant”\n\n(One Little Indian)\n\nThe intimate scale and wry, self-effacing tone of “Antidepressant” are a comfortable fit for Lloyd Cole, a singer-songwriter still best known as the frontman for the Commotions, a 1980’s Brit-rock band. It’s a mostly homemade effort — he recorded himself on piano, guitar and drums, and then added some guests — with lyrics that muse intelligently on the changes and challenges of middle age. Mr. Cole garnishes each song with a sprig of bittersweet humor: in “The Young Idealists” he eulogizes the naïveté of a generation that went “raging through the coffee shops and bars” before they “bought into the neo-con economic dream.”\n\nAnd even as he paints psychologically detailed domestic portraits, he does a good job of undercutting his own narrative voice. “With my medication, I will be fine,” he sings breezily in the title track, and it’s anyone’s guess how reassuring that line is really meant to be. NATE CHINEN\n\nJIMMY BUFFETT\n\n“Take the Weather With You”\n\n(Mailboat/RCA)\n\nEven a good-time guy like Jimmy Buffett can feel the weight of the world. That’s the undercurrent on “Take the Weather With You,” which has him thinking, fleetingly, about “roadside bombers and tsunamis” and lingering over the sorrows of New Orleans. Mr. Buffett gives fans his usual swaying tunes that insist you can grow up, but still have fun: especially near a tropical beach, as signified by steel drum.\n\nThrough the album he parties from Tierra del Fuego to Hawaii, pausing for some Nashville barroom country. But he also chose darker alt-country material like Mary Gauthier’s song about New Orleans ghosts, “Wheel Inside the Wheel”; Mark Knopfler’s sullen breakup song, “Whoop de Doo”; and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings’s “Elvis Presley Blues.” His own “Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On,” which starts out as another go-with-the-flow song, pauses to envision New Orleans once again: “Pontchartrain buried the Ninth Ward to the second floor.” He’s still offering comfort and wistful acceptance, but escape is no longer so easy.
