        "text": "Lloyd Banks (Born Christopher Charles Lloyd, on April 30, 1982) , is an American rapper and member of the rap group G-Unit. Raised in South Jamaica, Queens, he dropped out of high school in 1998. With G-Unit, he released two albums, Beg for Mercy in 2003 and T.\n\nO.S. (Terminate on Sight) in 2008. Banks released his first solo album The Hunger for More in 2004 with the top ten hit single \"On Fire\". He followed with Rotten Apple in 2006 and left Interscope Records 2009.\n\nBanks was born in New Carrollton, Maryland and raised in Queens, New York. His mother named Rosa LLoyd of Puerto Rican descent and has a Haitian-American father. His father spent most of Lloyd's childhood in prison, leaving his mother to raise him and his two siblings.\n\nLloyd attended August Martin High School but dropped out at age 16. For his stage name, he took his great, great-grandfather's name Banks, which was passed on by his uncles who also shared it.G-Unit was founded when childhood friends Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent, and Tony Yayo decided to make a group with each other.\n\nThey met Young Buck when UTP group came to New York and 50 Cent heard Young Buck rapping. After 50 Cent signed his contract with Aftermath Entertainment they took Young Buck in the group and signed him.\n\nTony Yayo, being an older and more experienced rapper, joined 50 Cent on the Nas Promo Tour, the Cash Money Tour and the Ruff Ryders Tour. As Banks remained at home waiting for 50 and Yayo to return, he started rappin around the neighborhood to further increase his buzz on the streets.\n\nHe then hooked up with neighborhood producers and made tracks for local mixtapes. Lloyd Banks has a renowned reputation on the mixtape scene. While Banks was making Mixtapes,50 Cent was soon granted his own record label by Dr.\n\nDre and released the album Get Rich or Die Tryin'; Lloyd Banks was featured on the song \"Don't Push Me\", and the remixed version of \"P.I.M.P\". Soon after the group had established their own record label, G-Unit Records, G-Unit released their first official group album Beg for Mercy in November 2003, which went on to be certified double platinum.\n\nDuring August 2005, Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and their entourage were traveling in a van, when the vehicle was pulled over after passing through a red light in midtown Manhattan. Officers said they discovered a loaded handgun and another weapon in the van.\n\nProsecutors asked a judge to dismiss the charges after an investigation determined that neither Lloyd Banks nor Young Buck was in possession of the weapons. Felony gun charges against Lloyd Banks and Young Buck were dropped on November 8, 2006.\n\nIn the early morning hours of January 9, 2010, in a Kitchener, Ontario hotel, an alleged altercation took place between Banks and a concert promoter over performance fees. Banks, and three of his associates, were later charged with forcible confinement, aggravated assault and robbery, and released on $50,000 bail.\n\nIn late January 2010, it was announced that Banks would release a new song, \"Beamer, Benz, or Bentley\" featuring Juelz Santana, from his upcoming third studio album. \"Beamer, Benz, or Bentley\" charted at #49 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nLloyd Banks release info via his twitter announcing that the title for his third album has tentatively been called The Hunger for More 2' and will attempt to take him back to his best work. However, the G-Unit label later stated that the title is not set in concrete and still may be altered.\n\nThe title of the album was confirmed by 50 Cent as H.F.M. 2 (The Hunger for More 2) in a interview with MTV News. According to Banks, Interscope is trying to get him back due to the success of the single \"Beamer, Benz, or Bentley\"."
