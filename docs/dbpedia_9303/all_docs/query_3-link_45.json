        "text": "MISSOURI CITY, Texas (KTRK) -- Coach Lloyd Banks has been part of the Marshall Buffalos coaching staff for the last nine seasons.\n\nHis knowledge in speed has made the Buffs a team to fear with their blazing fast running back core.\n\n\"It's about the kids, it is all about their development athletically and socially. I'm just in love with the process and love being around these kids. I would not want to be doing anything else,\" Coach Banks says.\n\nBanks excels in track, where he has won numerous state titles with the Buffalos.\n\nDespite all the success in athletics, his biggest satisfaction is making a difference in his students' lives.\n\n\"I can ask him anything. I look up to him like a father figure,\" athlete Devon Achane said.\n\nDespite numerous job offers in recent years, Banks has stayed faithful to the Missouri City community.\n\n\"He comes with a fire every single day,\" said Fort Bend Marshall head coach James Williams. \"You know he challenges guys to be great and to be their best every game. He has been here as long as I have been here, and he has been a key part of both programs' success.\""
