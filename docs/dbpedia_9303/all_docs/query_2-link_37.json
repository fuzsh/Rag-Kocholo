        "text": "Rick Ross and 50 Cent have been going at each other for over a decade, and the Biggest Bawse has now proposed an acquisition of the solo catalogs of some former and current G-Unit members.\n\nOn Monday (December 11), Rozay took to his Instagram Stories with an offer for Fif, who he called the “diabolical genius” in reference to Charlamagne Tha God’s recent comments about the mogul.\n\n“I read yesterday that Young Buck’s catalog is worth 725K,” he began. “I can only assume that Lloyd Banks is worth about the same, so I say let’s keep it simple — throw Tony Yayo in there, I’ll give you 1.5 [million].\n\n“I don’t need the entire G-Unit catalog but Beg For Mercy — let’s keep it simple, I’ll give you another 500K for the masters of that. So that’s two million dollars. I’m makin’ a business offer to the ‘diabolical genius.'”\n\nJust last week, the Queens MC mocked Rick Ross and Meek Mill’s joint project for generating what he deemed meager album sales since its release in November. In a social media post recapping his Final Lap Tour performance in Adelaide, Australia, he took a moment to slip in a shot at his rivals.\n\n“When you sold 31,009 CDs, I shouldn’t talk to you,” he said, referring to the first-week sales of Too Good to Be True.\n\nRozay caught wind of the slight and subsequently took to Instagram with a response, mentioning 50 Cent’s fitness trainer girlfriend Jamira “Cuban Link” Haines.\n\n“I just got a DM that say, ‘Rozay, we believe 50 Cent just made a comment about you online.’ I seen it and I said, ‘Y’all don’t know 50 Cent like I do. He wouldn’t do that,'” he said. “For one, his bitch is Dream Chasers. She’s been a Dream Chasers bitch for many years — still is. That’s when she told me I was her favorite.”\n\nHe continued: “For two: n-gga, we been rich! We still getting money. Them n-ggas was laughing at my first-week sales. They was doing a million first week and I did 150, 180 [thousand] and they was laughing.”\n\n“But you smell that saltwater, right?” he asked, panning the camera to his lavish outdoor pool. “Don’t let them n-ggas trick you. Biggest!”"
