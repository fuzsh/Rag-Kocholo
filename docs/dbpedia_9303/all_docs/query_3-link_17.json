        "text": "Lloyd Banks remains one of the fiercest lyricists to emerge out of the East Coast. Though he never became a mainstream success in the same way as 50 Cent, he never held back whenever he stepped in the booth with his G-Unit peers. Unfortunately, his relationship with Fif deteriorated over time and it took a minute for him to return to the spotlight. In recent years, he’s dished out collaborations alongside members of Griselda and dropped off two of his own projects, firmly reminding the masses that he still holds the title of the Punch Line King.\n\nDespite his distance from 50 Cent, his relationship with other members of the G-Unit camp isn’t as fractured. Tony Yayo, for instance, recently tapped Banks for his latest project, The Loyal. Banks shows out on the project for the record, “Rocket Chamber,” which dropped as a single. The two clearly haven’t lost their chemistry in the booth and brought forth an excellent collab that hopefully leads to more music from the G-Unit rappers in the future.\n\nTony Yayo Compares Lloyd Banks To The GOATs\n\nLloyd Banks might not occupy the spotlight but he never disappoints when he steps in front of the mic. Tony Yayo recently sat down with DJ Vlad who, despite his differences with Banks, had nothing but praise for the Rotten Apple MC’s contributions to The Loyal. “Banks is a show-and-prove type of guy,” Yayo explained to Vlad. In terms of his reclusive nature, Yayo described his collaborator as an “anti-industry” individual who is far more focused on the music than the business-side of things.\n\nThough he might be quiet for the most part, Yayo explained that Banks has no shortage of music sitting in his vault. “I go to the studio, he’ll play me 100 records,” he explained before comparing Banks to both Biggie and ‘Pac. “It’s like his bars are something like Biggie but he writes like Tupac. I never met a guy like that besides [Eminem].” It seems as though there could be more music from Yayo and Banks soon as the former said he has another project coming out shortly."
