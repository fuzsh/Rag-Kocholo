The founder of the prize, Alfred Nobel, decreed in his will in 1895, which regulated the awarding of the prize, that the Nobel Prize in Physics should be awarded to \"the person who has made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics.\" The Nobel Prize is presented each year by the King of Sweden on the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, December 10.\n\nSince the first Nobel Prize was awarded, the prize has been awarded a total of 114 times. A total of 215 physicists were honored, including 211 men (98 percent) and 4 women (2 percent). John Bardeen was the only one to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics twice. From 1901 until the last time in 1992, the prize was awarded 47 times undivided to one person. Since 1902, it has been divided 32 times between two people and 35 times between three. Six times the prize was not awarded, the last time in 1942."
