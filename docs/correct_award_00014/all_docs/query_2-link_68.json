Established in accordance with the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, these prestigious awards are overseen by the Nobel Foundation.\n\nSince their inception, the Nobel Prizes have been conferred upon 789 individuals and 20 organizations, with an additional 62 recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. However, there have been instances where laureates were unable to accept their awards due to governmental restrictions. Notably, Adolf Hitler prohibited three German laureates—Richard Kuhn (Chemistry, 1938), Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry, 1939), and Gerhard Domagk (Physiology or Medicine, 1939)—from receiving their prizes. Similarly, the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak (Literature, 1958) to decline his award. Additionally, Jean-Paul Sartre (Literature, 1964) and Lê Đức Thọ (Peace, 1973) declined the honor for personal reasons; Sartre rejected all official accolades, while Lê cited the situation in Vietnam as his reason.\n\nAmong the laureates, six individuals have been recognized with multiple prizes. Notably, the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize on three occasions, the highest count for any recipient. Noteworthy too is the contribution of women to the laureate circle, with 35 female Nobel laureates to date. Marie Curie stands as the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, honored for her groundbreaking work in Physics in 1903.\n\nThere have been occasions when the Nobel Prize was not awarded due to external circumstances or insufficient nominations. During the tumult of World War II, for instance, the prize lay dormant from 1940 to 1942. In such instances, the allocated prize money is returned to the relevant funds.\n\nList Of Nobel Prize Laureates\n\nFor an updated list visit: Wikipedia\n\nRelated Pages:"
