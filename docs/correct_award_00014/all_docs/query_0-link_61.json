        "text": "the author presents the conference that van der waals delivered when he received the nobel prize for physics in 1910. this work is a contribution to the several commemorating activities that are be-ing organized around the world to celébrate the 100 years since van der waals was awarded the máximum prize. the conference summarizes some of the main achievements and in particular the equation of state, the principie of corresponding states and the theory of mixtures. these pioneering ideas of van der waals have influenced several áreas of physics and thermodynamics but in particular these three concepts, which motivated his merited nobel prize. the paper concludes that even after a hundred years since the nobel and more than 125 years since the doctoral thesis, and despite of many other extraordinary advances in physics and thermodynamics, the concepts of van der waals continué more valid than ever."
