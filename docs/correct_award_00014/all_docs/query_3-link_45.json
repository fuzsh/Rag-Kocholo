        "text": "\"I am honoured to be awarded this prize (and also still to be classified as a young person!). As I mentioned in my inaugural lecture not so long ago, I remember asking my high-school chemistry teacher for more information about \"van der Waals interactions\" after seeing the term in our chemistry textbook. Three years later, I saw my first x-ray crystal structure of a drug-protein complex on a work placement at AstraZeneca. Nine years after that, my first independent research grant was entitled \"How much do van der Waals interactions contribute to molecular recognition in solution?\", and shortly after that I published a paper an almost identical title in Nature Chemistry. Since then, we have learned even more about the nature and energetics molecular interactions using a combination of synthesis, experiment, and computational chemistry. Thank you to all the people who have worked in my group on projects probing the origins of molecular recognition!\""
