        "text": "Johannes Diderik van der Waals was born in Leyden (Netherlands) on November 23, 1837 and became a schoolteacher without ever acquiring any knowledge of the classical languages. This meant he could not sit for formal university examinations at Leyden. He could merely attend classes in his spare time (from 1862 to 1865) and obtain teaching certificates in mathematics and physics.\n\nWhen the classical languages requirements were finally lifted for students in Science, van der Waals could move on with an academic career and obtain a doctorate in 1873 (he was 36 years of age by then) His doctoral dissertation was entitled Over de Continu√Øteit van den Gas en Vloeistoftoestand (On the Continuity of the Gas and Liquid State). It was so remarkable that the great James Clerk Maxwell himself gave it one of the highest compliments ever paid by one scientist speaking about the work of another:\n\n\"It has certainly directed the attention of more than one inquirer to the study of the [Dutch] language in which it is written.\"\n\nIn that masterpiece of his, van der Waals introduced the famous equation of state, now named after him, which relates the pressure, volume and absolute temperature (p, V, T) of a mole of some fluid:\n\n( p + a / V2 ) ( V-b ) = RT\n\nIn this, a, b and R are constant for a given fluid. For an ideal gas, a and b would be zero and the above would reduce to the Ideal Gas Law for one mole (n = 1) of a \"perfect\" gas. However, for a \"true\" van der Waals fluid (for which a and b are nonzero) the constant R need not be equal to the perfect gas constant (of 8.31447 J/K). It's just another parameter which can be adjusted for a best fit of the van der Waals equation of state to actual measurements of a real fluid. In spite of what a few misguided comments may state, the van der Waals equation of state does feature three adjustable parameters (a, b and R). In fact, the three parameters of a perfect van der Waals fluid are best expressed in terms of the values of p, V and T at its critical point (the \"critical state\" of a fluid was first chracterized by Cagniard in 1822).\n\na = 3 pV 2 b = V / 3 R = 8 pV / 3T\n\nThe parameter b (called molar covolume) is the nonzero volume that the fluid would occupy under a very large pressure. Van der Waals argued that atoms and molecules had finite size (see Van der Waals radius) and that external pressure could not reduce the volume occupied by bouncing molecules when there are already almost \"touching\" each other."
