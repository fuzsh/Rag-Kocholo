In deriving his equation of state van der Waals assumed not only the existence of molecules (which in physics was disputed at the time), but also that they are of finite size and attract each other. Since he was one of the first to postulate an intermolecular force, however rudimentary, such a force is now sometimes called a van der Waals force. For his work he won the 1910 Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nLettered craters\n\nGraphic LAC No. 117. Excerpt from the USGS Digital Atlas of the Moon.\n\nLPOD Articles\n\nBibliography"
