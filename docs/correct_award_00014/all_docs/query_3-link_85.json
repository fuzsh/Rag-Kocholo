        "text": "~ Not a person, a family of Dutch scientists who made significant contributions to the understanding of intermolecular forces and the behavior of gases. The most well-known among them is Johannes Diderik van der Waals, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1910 for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids.\n\n~ Forces of attraction between polar molecules i.e. the attractive forces between the positive end of one polar molecules and the negative end of another molecule.\n\n~A polar molecule is a molecule with a positive end and a negative end\n\n~Weakest intermolecular force.\n\n-–>simultaneous attraction of an electron by the nuclei within a molecule and by a nuclei in adjascent molecule.\n\n~ Electrostatic force between protons and electrons .\n\n~A nucleus not only attracts its own electrons but those of neighbouring molecules\n\n~ the greater the number of electrons in a molecule, stronger the force."
