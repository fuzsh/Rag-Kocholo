Kossel's field of work was physiological chemistry, especially the chemistry of tissues and cells. He began his investigations into the constitution of the cell nucleus at the end of the seventies, and in the nineties he turned more and more to the study of the proteins.\n\n5 Earlier Researches Berzilius 100 years ago gave new direction to the branch of chemical research which was at that time called animal chemistry and which is now usually termed physiological chemistry. Professor Kossel spent more than 25 years to study on path he mapped out.\n\n6 Work done by Professor Kossel The cells – smallest independent units of living organism. The development of protein chemistry and specialized knowledge about protein bodies occurring in cell was the main research area of professor Kossel. He carried out extensive work on protein breakdown products.\n\n7 Work Done Contd... Kossel carried out extensive work on Protamines. Histones – Protein group that stands between protamines and normal proteins. He made extensive studies on protein compounds. He remarked the presence of nucleic acid in cells and their relationship with proteins."
