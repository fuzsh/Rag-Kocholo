        "text": "Johannes Diderik van der Waals (Dutch pronunciation: [joːˈɦɑnəz ˈdidərɪk fɑn dər ˈʋaːls] ( listen)[note 1]; 23 November 1837 – 8 March 1923) was a Dutch theoretical physicist and thermodynamicist. He became famous for his pioneering work on the equation of state for gases and liquids. Van der Waals started his career as a school teacher. In 1877, he became the first physics professor of the University of Amsterdam. Van der Waals won the 1910 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids.[1]\n\nThings named after Van der Waals\n\n[change | change source]\n\nHis name is primarily associated with the Van der Waals equation of state that describes the behavior of gases and their condensation to the liquid phase. His name is also associated with Van der Waals forces (forces between stable molecules),[2] with Van der Waals molecules (small molecular clusters bound by Van der Waals forces), and with Van der Waals radii (sizes of molecules). As James Clerk Maxwell said, \"there can be no doubt that the name of Van der Waals will soon be among the foremost in molecular science.\"[3]\n\n1873 thesis\n\n[change | change source]\n\nIn his 1873 thesis, Van der Waals noted that real gases were not ideal: He thought this was because there are intermolecular interactions. He introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.[4] Spearheaded by Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald, a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of molecules arose towards the end of the 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals's thesis was written (1873), the molecular structure of fluids had not been accepted by most physicists, and liquid and vapor were often considered as chemically distinct. But Van der Waals's work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and attractive strength. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state. By comparing his equation of state with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of their mutual attraction.[5]\n\nEffects to molecular physics\n\n[change | change source]"
