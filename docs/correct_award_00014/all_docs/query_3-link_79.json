        "text": "Jacqueline Elisabeth van der Waals was born in The Hague on 26 June, 1868. The daughter of Johannes Diderik van der Waals -- noted scientist and winner of the 1910 Nobel Prize for Physics -- Jacqueline Elisabeth grew up in a highly intellectual household and was well-versed in many subjects by the time she was a teenager. After earning degrees in History and Education, she became a history teacher and began publishing poetry under the pseudonym 'U.E.V.' (Una Ex Vocibus). She produced several volumes of poetry as well as numerous critical works and novels.\n\nvan der Waals dealt with a variety of themes in her poetry -- the most prevalent being death, nature and God -- and also wrote extensively on the role of women in European society at the turn of the 19th century. She became regarded as a somewhat progressive thinker because her work was of such a highly internalized and personal nature -- qualities that were thought of as unseemly for women to posses at the time.\n\nPicture Source: Digitale Bibliotheek Voor de Nederlandse Letteren (www.dbnl.nl)\n\nRead more â†’"
