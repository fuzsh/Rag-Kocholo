        "text": "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\n\nSince 1901, the Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 107 times to 195 different laureates. Among those Nobel laureates are such illustrious and distinguished scientists as:\n\n1901 – Wilhelm Röntgen, “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him”.\n\n1902 – Hendrik Lorentz, “in recognition of the extraordinary service they rendered by their researches into the influence of magnetism upon radiation phenomena”.\n\n1903 – Antoine Henri Becquerel, “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity”.\n\nAlso that year, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the very first time to a woman, the great lady of Physics: Marie Curie, née Sklodowska, and her husband Pierre Curie, “in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel”.\n\n1906 – J.J. Thompson, “in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases”.\n\n1907 – Albert Michelson, “for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid”.\n\n1910 – Johannes Diderik van der Waals, “for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids”.\n\n1911 – Wilhelm Wien, “for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat”.\n\n1918 – Max Planck, “in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta”.\n\n1921 – Albert Einstein, “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”.\n\n1922 – Niels Bohr, “for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them”.\n\n1923 – Robert Millikan, “for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect”.\n\n1925 – Gustav Hertz, “for his discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom”.\n\n1927 – Arthur Compton, “for his discovery of the effect named after him”.\n\n1929 – Louis de Broglie, “for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons”.\n\n1932 – Werner Heisenberg, “for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen”.\n\n1933 – Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac, “for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory”.\n\n1938 – Enrico Fermi, “for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons”.\n\n1945 – Wolfgang Pauli, “for the discovery of the Exclusion Principle, also called the Pauli Principle”.\n\nA Constellation of Eminent Minds\n\n1960 – Donald Glaser, “for the invention of the bubble chamber“.\n\n1963 – Maria Goeppert Mayer, the second woman to be awarded the Physics Nobel prize, “for discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure”.\n\n1965 – Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, “for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles”.\n\n1969 – Murray Gell-Mann, “for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions”.\n\n1978 – Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, “for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation”.\n\n1983 – Subramanyan Chandrasekhar, “for his theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars”.\n\n1997 – Steven Chu, “for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light”.\n\n2010 – Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, “for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene“.\n\n2011 – Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt and Adam G. Riess, “for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae.”"
