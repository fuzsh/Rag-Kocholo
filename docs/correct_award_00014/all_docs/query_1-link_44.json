        "text": "Next Tuesday, no earlier than 11:45 Stockholm time, journalists and scientists will tune in to hear the announcement of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics. As the one day of the year when it’s virtually guaranteed that there will be major media coverage of cutting-edge physics, this is kind of a big deal for a pop-physics writer, and it’s hard to resist the temptation to speculate about what area of physics the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences will decide to honor.\n\nAnd, really, this is the Internet, so why resist the temptation? So here are some suggestions of physics topics that might win, and arguments for and against them as potential nominees. These speculations are purely my own thoughts on the matter, with no inside knowledge of anything, based only on following the field of physics in general.\n\n1) Quantum Information/ Quantum Weirdness\n\nOne perennial favorite suggestion is a prize for fundamental work on quantum physics: things like tests of Bell’s inequality and entanglement, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing. The last prize in this area was in 2012, to Dave Wineland and Serge Haroche.\n\nPro: Quantum computing is a hot topic, maybe the biggest news-making area of physics in the last few years, thanks to big investments from traditional computing giants like Google, IBM, and Microsoft. It would provide a nice news hook, and the Nobel folks aren’t immune to the draw of extra topicality.\n\nThere are a couple of different directions you could go with this: one would be to reward the theory side, where there are a wealth of ideas that have proven fruitful (no-cloning, dense coding, quantum algorithms for various things); the other would be to recognize quantum experiments (the aforementioned Bell tests, which have been around for 40-ish years, and refined to high art in the last decade or two).\n\nCon: There are no formal public criteria, but there’s a vague sense that the prizes rotate through different subfields, and don’t repeat too frequently. Last year’s prize went to developments in laser technology, and there’s a chance that the people making decisions would see a quantum prize, particularly on the experimental side, as too laser-y, and thus put it off.\n\n2) Extrasolar Planets\n\nOver the last 30-ish years, astronomers have found planets around more than 3,000 other stars, by a couple of different methods. One approach uses the Doppler shift to detect the wobble of the star as it’s tugged on by the gravity of an orbiting planet. The other observes the faint dimming of the star as a planet passes in front of its star.\n\nPro: This is another contender for “most often in the news,” with new announcements of planets seeming to make headlines about once a week. This is now a reasonably mature field, and it’s arguably time for it to be recognized. It’s also an area splits neatly into half-prizes, allowing one for each technique.\n\nCon: Just two years ago, the 2017 prize went to LIGO, which might box out another astronomy-type prize for this year, on the same “informal rotation among subfields” grounds discussed above. Also, many of the exoplanet projects are large-ish collaborations, and it might be difficult to cut down to the maximum of three laureates allowed by Nobel tradition.\n\n3) Condensed Matter Experiment\n\nThe 2016 prize went to three theorists for work on topology in condensed matter physics, but the last experimental prize in condensed matter was in 2010, for graphene.\n\nPro: As the largest single area in physics, there’s a wealth of work here that might be honored on the experimental side. Just to throw some things out, there have been discoveries of new materials with relatively high superconducting transition temperatures (MgB2, the pnictides), important techniques for measuring what’s going on inside materials (ARPES or the like), various kinds of ultra-high-resolution imaging, any number of developments in biophysics (though some of those might sneak into the Medicine prize), and many more.\n\nCon: The whining of every science journalist facing the need to learn about some complicated and messy condensed-matter topic will shatter every window in the Royal Swedish Academy offices, which would take forever to clean up.\n\n4) Applied Technology\n\nWhile the sexiest prizes are the ones which go to cutting-edge experiments and theory, every now and then the Royal Swedish Academy throws us a curveball and honors something practical. The last one of these went to blue LED’s in 2014.\n\nPro: Maybe the best suggestion in this area that I’ve heard (I thought from Ash Jogalekar, but I don’t see it in a post, so maybe it was just on Twitter?) is a prize for lithium-ion batteries. That checks a lot of boxes: it’s enormously important to modern life, is in the general area of condensed matter, and has some “green” connotations which would make a very minor political statement.\n\nCon: They really don’t do these very often, so it’s always a bit of a long shot.\n\nSo, there’s a necessarily very incomplete list of potential topics for this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics. Note that I have carefully avoided trying to pick specific individual laureates, because that process is a giant pit of snakes that I prefer to stay out of.\n\nOut of these, what do I think will win? This genuinely does seem like a good moment for a practical-technology prize, and I do like the suggestion of lithium-ion batteries, possibly in combination with something else (photovoltaics?). After that, I’d say something in experimental condensed matter, then exoplanets, then quantum information. Which pains me a little, as quantum information is the area I’d most like to see win (as it’s the one most likely to include a laureate I’ve met), but I think it’s most likely seen as too close to last year’s laser prize (wrongly, but whatever...).\n\nBut that’s all just (slightly irresponsible) speculation. Which, thankfully, we don’t need to engage in for much longer, as the actual announcement is under a week away..."
