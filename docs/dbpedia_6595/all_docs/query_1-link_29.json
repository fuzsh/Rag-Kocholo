Kirkhill ablative insulation technology lines the inside of the rocket motor case installed on the Full Scale Booster (FSB-1) that protects both the structure, and in the future will protect the astronauts and payloads that will fly on the Artemis rocket to the Moon.\n\nThe Space Launch System (SLS) Rocket will carry the Orion Spacecraft. The Artemis missions will utilize the SLS rocket to send humans back to the moon for the first time since the Apollo missions. One of the goals of Artemis is to establish a long term human presence on the Moon’s surface in preparation to travel and colonize Mars. The SLS was designed and built by Northrup Grumman who Kirkhill has partnered with for decades. This remarkable technological achievement will produce 8.8 million pounds of thrust and stand 322 feet tall, which is taller than the Statue of Liberty. The SLS will be the most powerful rocket ever launched.\n\nAs a significant supplier of elastomeric products to the Defense and Space industry in the US and internationally, Kirkhill stands as proud contributors to past and present and future space programs.
