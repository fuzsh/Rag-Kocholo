        "text": "At a glance\n\nWord-of-mouth steers a lot of business through the drive-through \"cool in the summer – warm in the winter\" estimating bays at both locations, plus the father-son duo has a strong belief in the power of aggressive marketing.\n\nCable television spots are aired in a two-months-on and two-months-off pattern of advertising buys.\n\n\"We found that people think we are 'on' all of the time, but we are spending half the money,\" Trent Thompson says. \"We advertise on the radio during a specific popular morning drive program. \"We are trying to saturate specific times and media instead of spreading things out too thin,\" he adds\n\n\"We update our website and use as many keywords as possible to keep us at or near the top of the search engines at little or no cost,\" Trent Thompson says. \"When setting up your website you need to be mindful of everything from the colors, graphics, positioning of information and the wording you use. Your website is a very useful tool for you and your customers if it is set up correctly,\" he says. \"It is also your first impression with the existing and future generations of customers.\"\n\nIMAGE / LYNCH COLLISION CENTER\n\nNurturing relationships\n\n\"We are always looking for new opportunities to grow,\" says Jim Thompson, citing the two-and-a-half-year-old Lynch location in a new 10,000-square-foot building next to Lynch Ford-Chevy in Mt. Vernon, 25 miles away from the Cedar Rapids headquarters. \"We have a great relationship, which includes the use of their name to make it as seamless as possible for the customer.\"\n\nThe Lynch Collision Center \"was designed with the customer and the environment in mind,\" Trent Thompson says. \"One of the best compliments we get on the décor of the customer lobby is that it looks nothing like a body shop. It is inviting to all customers yet professional and functional.\"\n\nIt grosses $1 million per year.\n\n\"With the environment in mind we use high-efficiency lighting, recycle the cardboard and metal and even recycle the air from the compressor with a return air system on all of the air tools,\" Trent Thompson says. \"The return air system not only allows the compressor to run much less, but it also reduces the noise of the air tools to a whisper, which everyone in the shop appreciates.\"\n\nWaterborne paint is sprayed at Lynch with great success, he says, and waterborne is currently being introduced at the Bob Mickey site; air lines are being run and trainers from Sherwin Williams are on the scene. A Summit central management system allows the office manager to do her accounting for both locations from her desk in Cedar Rapids.\n\nBob Mickey is a 23,000-square-foot facility that does approximately $4 million in annual sales. An interstate highway and busy cross-street are nearby; two car rental outlets are within two blocks.\n\nOut on the shop floor, each collision repairer has a portable lift to further enhance the production flow.\n\n\"We have put many lean processes in place over the years, and most have worked extremely well,\" Jim Thompson says. Other proposed lean techniques have been duds, but that's OK because \"we feel lean is more about continued improvement.\" It's far better to consider \"what works in your shop, and more importantly, what your staff buys into. Then you make sure everyone follows though, especially the managers,\" he says.\n\nJim Thompson expresses appreciation of the benefits rendered by continuous analysis, especially when applied to the 40 percent of business brought in through three direct repair programs (DRPs).\n\n\"We track our KPIs, (key profit indicators), which allows us to be proactive with our DRPs instead of reactive. Maintaining constant communication is very important.\"\n\nMembership in a 20 Group \"has been a major reason for our continued growth,\" according to Jim Thompson. \"The time away from your business to learn, share and reenergize is one of the most important things you can do for yourself and your business,\" he says.\n\n\"Their support of our business has had a direct relationship to our success,\" Trent Thompson says. \"I am always amazed at the wealth of information and support they can give to a business and the people that make up that business.\"\n\nIndustry involvement\n\nThe company's beginnings go back to Jim Thompson setting up a collision repair element in a single stall at a car dealer's service department. The enterprise expanded and moved to several different locations until the late Bob Mickey and Jim Thompson constructed a 23,000-square-foot stand-alone facility down the street from Mickey's dealership.\n\nJim Thompson assumed sole ownership of the collision repair aspect upon Mickey's death in 2001. In 2009, the Thompsons became Iowa's first multi-shop owner when the father and son team opened the Lynch location.\n\nJim Thompson was the first chairman and one of the founders of the Iowa Collision Repair Association and is still involved with the group. He feels participation is a must for all of the shops in Iowa.\n\n\"It allows us a voice with the state government and the insurance industry,\" he says, \"and it also improves the image of our industry.\" Jim Thompson serves on the I-CAR local board and his shop has been named Sherwin William A-Plus Vision Group Collision Center of the year twice.\n\n\"My background is not in the industry,\" Trent Thompson says. He was a 5th grade teacher for 10 years, mentoring low socio-economic students in San Antonio, Texas; Las Vegas and Iowa.\n\n\"After many family discussions I decided to join the business about two-and-a-half years ago,\" he says. \"I have had to learn a tremendous amount about the industry, and I still have a lot to learn. But with my Dad and the people I work with, I have great resources to learn from.\""
