        "text": "Blake Watts Leads Teammates to Pro-Senior Victory\n\nLouisville, KY (May 15, 2023) – Blake Watts found his way back to success in Kentucky PGA competition. In one of the biggest KPGA Section events in recent history with 204 players, Watts got the victory this past Monday at Big Spring Country Club in the KPGA Pro-Senior.\n\nWatts and his teammates Joe Frederick, Bob Bender, and Gary Edlin won by a slim margin of one shot over 3 other teams. This competition contained teams of four people with one being a KPGA Member/Associate while the other three players were amateurs aged 50 or older. On each hole, one gross score (counted first) and one net score (with 80% of the amateurs’ handicap indexes factored in) were counted to determine results. Watt’s team got off to a slow start on the front nine but then used a back nine charge to fire an impressive 131 (-13).\n\nJohn Bachman, Logan Watts, and Jeremy Martin tied for the low professional honors for the day shooting 70 (-2). Bachman and Watts each used at least four birdies to claim their first individual low pro-honors of the season. Martin continues his impressive play on the season by making six birdies in route to getting his second low professional honors of the season.\n\nRalph Landrum kicked off his 2023 season by grabbing an impressive victory for the senior division shooting 70 (-2). Landrum played spectacular golf and was able to beat the next closest competitor Greg Basham by 3 shots.\n\nNOTES & STATS\n\nRyan McGinnis had the shot of the day when his 130-yard shot on hole 12 ended up in the cup. This led to the only eagle on the hole for the day. McGinnis also almost made an ace on hole 6 where he captured the closest to the hole prize with a shot that landed just 11 inches from the cup.\n\nThe par-four 11th ranked the most difficult hole of the day with a rate of +.85. Only 55 of 204 players made par or better.\n\nThe par-five 16th was the easiest at a rate of +018. Two thirds of the field made par or better.\n\nThe average score was 80.93 with the back nine playing slightly harder than the front side. Holes 10-18 averaged 40.6 with 1-9 averaging 40.33."
