        "text": "As part of the 40th anniversary of Indiana University's undefeated 1975-76 men's basketball team -- the last men's Division I team to finish a season unbeaten -- the IndyStar and RetroIndy are re-publishing every game story during the Hoosiers' historic season. You'll get to relive, or experience for the first time, IU's run to perfection as it happened.\n\nToday, 40 years ago, the Hoosiers improved to 2-0, crushing Florida State in Indianapolis.\n\nIndiana enveloped Florida State like a thousand-armed octopus and annihilated the Seminoles, 83-59, last night before an appreciative Market Square Arena turnout of 17,526.\n\nIt was no contest almost from the beginning as the No. 1-rated Hoosiers presented a pleasing encore to their destruction of defending NCAA champion UCLA back on Nov. 29.\n\nVery early, the Hoosiers couldn't hit – missing their first seven tries and being represented on the scoreboard only by Scotty May's two free tosses well into the third minute of play.\n\nBUT FLORIDA STATE, which had won twice without defeat, also was stone-cold and dead very quickly as the Hoosiers exploded for four baskets in a blast that consumed just 1:17 on the clock.\n\nIn the middle, Seminole guard Wayne Smalls meshed to snap a string of five straight misses. But the Hoosiers were rolling, snatching, stealing and scoring and completely intent on making life miserable for the visitors.\n\nThe fearsome trio of May, Kent Benson and Quinn Buckner was in complete charge. Only guard Larry Warren, notching eight first-half points, offered much in the way of resistance.\n\nIt was precious little compared to what went on at the other end of the court. Though in and out of action as Coach Bobby Knight substituted freely all evening. May rolled in 14 markers before the break, while both Benson and Buckner contributed 12 each.\n\nBUCKNER SET the trend-missing four shots including three layups then rifling six in a row through the cords. It was 47-20 at intermission with Indiana bracketing 19 of its last 27 pokes of the stanza, meanwhile limiting the flabbergasted Floridians to only 8-29.\n\nThe Seminoles went minutes between points – not just fielders – and their situation didn't improve until the Hoosiers let things slide a bit in the late going.\n\nMay, who topped all scorers with 24 points, and the burly Benson, who bagged 22, sparked the massive second-half assault which saw the Crimson lead by as much as 38 at 79-41.\n\nBuckner connected for that count with 5:26 showing and the Hoosiers didn't tally again for nearly four minutes as Knight sent all kids of combinations into the conflict.\n\nCAPITALIZING principally on a full-court press which was singularly ineffective against Indiana's regulars, the Seminoles ran off 12 straight points before freshman Bob Bender's two free ones made it 81-53. Freshman Scott Eells finished off the Hoosier scoring with a layup that theft them 35-70 from the field.\n\nFlorida State ended, 26-60, but its 19th basket, equalling Indiana's opening-half production – wasn't registered until less than five minutes remained.\n\nOnly in errors were the teams about even as Florida State committed 27 and Indiana 26. But there was one big difference – most of the Hoosiers' bobbles were their own mistakes while the Seminoles simply had the ball taken from them time and again.\n\nBuckner was third high with 15 points, nailing three more than Warren who topped the Seminoles with 12. Indiana also gained a 13-7 edge at the stripe and 43-37 advantage on the boards where May, Benson and (Tom) Abernethy combined for 29 grabs.\n\nBenson, who flipped 10-15 from the court as May notched 10-19 limited Seminole center Greg Grady to one basket and gave him only five shots in 36 minutes.\n\n\"In my mind,\" said Knight, \"Benson played the best defensive game he has played at Indiana. He backed things up... played extremely well from that standpoint.\"\n\nCome Thursday night, the Hoosiers will do their first bit of stoping of the season in Assembly Hall. The foe will be old rival Notre Dame which thrashed Kansas last night in its opening road test to remain unbeaten.\n\nINDIANA 83, FLORIDA STATE 59\n\nFLORIDA STATE (59) – Thompson 3 0-0 6, Perkins 1 0-0 2, Grady 1 0-1 2, Warren 4 4-6 12, Smalls 4 2-2 10, Smith 0 0-0 0, Davis 5 0-1 10, Harris 4 1-2 9, Allen 4 0-0 8.\n\nINDIANA (83) – May 10 4-5 24, Abernethy 1 1-2 3, Benson 10 2-3 22, Buckner 7 1-3 15, Wilkerson 3 0-1 6, Radford 0 0-0 0, Crews 2 2-2 6, Wisman 0 1-2 1, Valavicius 1 0-1 2, Bender 0 2-2 2, Roberson 0 0-0 0, Haymore 0 0-0 0, Eells 1 0-0 2.\n\nHalftime: Indiana 47, Florida State 20. Rebounds: Indiana 43, Florida State 37. Errors: Florida State 27, Indiana 26.\n\nAttendance: 17,526.\n\nRETROINDY | 1976 UNDEFEATED HOOSIERS: 40 YEARS LATER"
