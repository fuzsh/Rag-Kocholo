Anyway, it's still as slightly disappointing as it was 17 years ago, but this is my first time viewing it after recording 72 episodes of a Futurama podcast series, so my opinions are much more powerful and dangerous.

Not that it matters much, but modern cartoon viewers should at least have some approximation of what it was like to see this on a $19.99 MSRP Digital Versatile Disc.\n\nAnyway, it's still as slightly disappointing as it was 17 years ago, but this is my first time viewing it after recording 72 episodes of a Futurama podcast series, so my opinions are much more powerful and dangerous.\n\nBender's Big Score could have made for a killer TV two-parter, and when the mechanics of Keeler's convoluted time-travel storyline actually get a chance to surface, it nearly hits the highs of the first four seasons. But, in what will become a trend with these \"movies,\" the writing staff really doesn't know how to stretch a story out to 90ish minutes without including a whole lot of filler. Though a lot of these pacing issues stem from the fact that each \"movie\" must also serve as four episodes, each with a beginning, middle, and end.\n\nTo its credit, out of all the Futurama \"movies,\" (repeating my quotation marks to be passive-aggressive) this one feels the least engineered to be chopped up and sold for parts on Comedy Central. But when viewing Big Score as a whole, you still get the feeling something is off.\n\nIt's worth going back to this first Futurama reboot as a novelty, because there's a lot of stuff in here you probably don't remember—like the two songs, with one featuring a verse from Hannukah Zombie. But above all, I'm very thankful I didn't need to pay 20 George W. Bush dollars (roughly 32 Biden bucks) to watch it a second time."
