Elgas joined Henderson in April of 2015, becoming the 28th head coach in the 105-year history of the basketball program. In his eight seasons, Elgas has revitalized the program in Arkadelphia and has been named one of the 15 Up-And-Coming coaches in all of NCAA DII and NAIA basketball.\n\nHenderson State's offense produced some of the best team and individual numbers during Elgas' time in Arkadelphia during the 2023-24 season. Individually, Malek Davis scored the most points in a single game of any HSU player in the Elgas era with his 40 points in the season finale against Harding (Mar. 2). Earlier in the year, Patterson delivered what was at the time the most points ever by a Reddie under Elgas with 38.\n\nAs a team, HSU's offense averaged 78.6 points per game, which is its highest ppg average since the 2019-20 GAC Championship season. That 2023-24 offense also produced the Reddies' highest single-season scorer on a points-per-game basis since Kaylon Tappin (18.5) during the 2017-18 campaign in Zyon Patterson with 15.7 ppg.\n\nIn the 2022-23 season, Elgas led the Reddies to their fourth GAC Tournament Semifinal berth in the last five years - the only team in the conference with that many such appearances during that time span. Henderson won six of its final seven regular season games to get into the tournament before upsetting No. 3 seed Southeastern Oklahoma State Savage Storm in the Quarterfinals.\n\nDuring HSU's run to the semis that season, Elgas became the second winningest head coach in Henderson State history, surpassing Rand Chappell with 124 career victories.\n\nThe 2019-20 season saw the culmination of Elgas' five-year build of the program at the time, as Henderson finished 23-8 overall and captured the 2020 Great American Conference Tournament Championship with three wins in three days in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. The tournament title was the first conference championship of any kind in men's basketball since 2006-07 and earned HSU an automatic berth to the NCAA DII Tournament for the first time in more than a decade. Among the many accomplishments during the championship season were a 13-1 record in the Duke Wells Center, two wins over rival Ouachita Baptist, a contest against Southeastern Oklahoma that was featured as the NCAA DII Showcase Game of the Week, and a field goal percentage defense that was ranked inside the Top-10 in the country for the entire year. The Reddies also set a new record for GAC wins in a single season with 15, while their 23 total victories were the most for the program since 2006-07.\n\nAfter steady improvement in his first three seasons, the 2018-19 campaign marked a big step for Elgas' bunch and was the best season for the program in over a decade. Despite being picked 11th in the league's preseason poll, the Reddies won 19 games, including a new program record 13 GAC contests, to finish fifth in the conference and earn their second bid to the GAC Tournament in Elgas' tenure. In Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Henderson notched its first GAC Tournament victory since 2013 with a win over rival Southern Arkansas to advance to the GAC Semifinals.\n\nDuring his first season at Henderson (2015-16) the Reddies finished with a 9-19 record overall and a 7-15 mark in Great American Conference play. In 2016-17, his second year at the helm of Reddies basketball, Elgas helped the program take a big step forward, improving to 16-13 overall and 11-11 in Great American Conference play, good for fifth place in the final GAC standings. The 11 conference victories tied the most for Henderson since joining the GAC in 2011-12 and helped the Reddies clinch a berth in the GAC Tournament in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, for the first time since 2013-14.\n\nElgas carried an impressive resume before getting to Arkadelphia, which included stops at numerous successful NCAA Division I programs. From 2007-2015, Elgas served as the top assistant coach at the University of Evansville under former Head Coach and current Eastern Illinois Head Coach Marty Simmons. In Elgas' final year at Evansville, the Aces won 24 games and won the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament The 24 wins were the most since 1998-99 when Evansville finished with a 23-10 record. Overall, the Aces made six postseason appearances in Elgas' time on staff, including five of the last six seasons, while also recording 20-plus wins in two of his last three seasons. The Evansville men’s basketball program has graduated an impressive 78 consecutive student-athletes including 20 during Elgas’ tenure.\n\nPrior to his stint at Evansville, Elgas spent a year at the University of Utah, and the previous six years at Kansas State. As an assistant coach at Kansas State, Elgas recruited eight all-Big 12 Conference selections. With one of the youngest teams in the Big 12 Conference in 2004-05, Elgas helped head coach Jim Wooldridge guide the Wildcats to their first winning season in six years with a 17-12 overall record. In 2006, Elgas stepped in as Kansas State’s interim head coach for two games (Feb. 8 and 15), posting a 1-1 record with a win over Iowa State.\n\nElgas played a major role in recruiting for Kansas State. The program garnered three top-25 recruiting classes during his tenure, including the nation’s best class in 2002-03, according to Hoop Scoop magazine. The ‘02-03 class included one consensus Top 100 player in Cartier Martin, as well as junior college transfer Jeremiah Massey who was named the 2003-04 Big 12 Newcomer of the Year.\n\nAs director of basketball operations, Elgas oversaw coordination of all operations within the Wildcat basketball program, including assisting in the organization of recruiting activities, running the Jim Wooldridge Basketball Camp, organizing K-State coaching clinics, and overseeing the Wildcat Faculty/Staff Club. In addition, Elgas coordinated all team travel and led special projects for the basketball office.\n\nBefore his run with the Wildcats, Elgas was an assistant coach at Texas State (formerly Southwest Texas State) from 1995-2000. He was instrumental in the recruiting process of the Bobcat basketball program. As an assistant for current Washington Wizard's assistant coach Mike Miller’s squad, he served as the recruiting coordinator, monitoring academic progress and coordinating scheduling. He also assisted with on-the-floor coaching and the coordination of practice and workout schedules. During his tenure, the Bobcats were 75-62, won two Southland Conference championships, and advanced to the 1997 NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn 1998-99, Elgas helped guide the Bobcats to their first outright Southland Conference regular season title with a 19-9 overall record and a 13-5 league mark. It was the second championship in three years for the ‘Cats, who also captured the 1996-97 crown. The Bobcats were led by all-conference performer Jeff Foster, who became an NBA first round draft choice in 1999 and went 21st to the Indiana Pacers. In five years at Texas State, Elgas coached 10 all-Southland Conference selections.\n\nPrior to his days at Texas State, Elgas served a coaching stint at Lincoln (Ill.) College. During his two seasons as assistant coach, Elgas helped the Lynx to an overall record of 46-16. During the 1993-94 season, Lincoln was the second-best defensive team in the nation in terms of field-goal percentage. The Lynx went on to place in the nation’s top 20 the following season, limiting opponents to 70.4 points on average.\n\nElgas graduated from Illinois State in 1993. He worked with the Redbirds basketball team as a student assistant coach from 1991-93 under the direction of head coach Bob Bender. The Redbirds claimed the Missouri Valley Conference championship in each of Elgas’ two seasons on the Redbirds’ bench.\n\nA native of Crystal Lake, Ill., Elgas played high school basketball at Crystal Lake Central High. He was a two-year starter and served as team captain his senior season.\n\nElgas is married to the former Tamara Grier who played basketball at Texas Lutheran. They have three children – Kyla, James and Kamry.\n\nHERE’S WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT COACH ELGAS:\n\n“Any success that we’ve had in the last eight years here at Evansville has been a direct reflection of Jimmy’s dedication and hard work with our basketball program.
