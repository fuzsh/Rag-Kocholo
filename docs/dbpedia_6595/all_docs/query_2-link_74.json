        "text": "Neuroblastoma Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version\n\nGeneral Information About Neuroblastoma\n\nDramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.[1,2] Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[1-5] Between 1975 and 2017, the 5-year survival rate for patients with neuroblastoma increased, from 86% to 91% for children younger than 1 year and from 34% to 83% for children aged 1 to 14 years.[2,3]\n\nChildhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer.\n\nIncidence and Epidemiology\n\nNeuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. More than 650 cases are diagnosed each year in the United States.[2,6-8] The prevalence is about 1 case per 7,000 live births. The incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. The overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable.[9] About 37% of patients are diagnosed as infants, and 90% are younger than 5 years at diagnosis, with a median age at diagnosis of 17 months.[8,10] The data on age at diagnosis show that this is a disease of infancy, with the highest rate of diagnosis in the first month of life.[6,10,11]\n\nPopulation-based studies of screening for infants with neuroblastoma have demonstrated that spontaneous regression of neuroblastoma without clinical detection in the first year of life is at least as prevalent as clinically detected neuroblastoma.[12-14]\n\nThe United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database was used to describe epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019. Non-Hispanic White patients have a higher risk of developing neuroblastoma than all other race and ethnicity groups. Compared with non-Hispanic White patients, the relative risks were 0.54 for Hispanic patients, 0.64 for non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander patients, 0.69 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native patients, and 0.73 for non-Hispanic Black patients.[9] The 5-year relative survival rate was higher for non-Hispanic White patients (80.7%) or Hispanic patients (80.8%), compared with non-Hispanic Black patients (72.6%).[9]\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that environmental or other exposures have not been unequivocally associated with increased or decreased incidences of neuroblastoma.[15]\n\nAnatomy\n\nNeuroblastoma originates in the adrenal medulla and paraspinal or periaortic regions where sympathetic nervous system tissue is present (see Figure 1).\n\nNeuroblastoma Screening\n\nFamilial neuroblastoma and genetic predisposition\n\nStudies analyzing constitutional DNA in rare cohorts of patients with familial neuroblastoma have provided insight into the complex genetic basis for tumor initiation. About 1% to 2% of patients with neuroblastoma have a family history of the disease. These children are, on average, younger (9 months at diagnosis) than patients without a family history, and about 20% of these patients have multifocal primary neuroblastoma.\n\nGermline variants. Several germline variants have been associated with a genetic predisposition to neuroblastoma, including the following:\n\nALK gene variant. The primary cause of familial neuroblastoma (about 75% of familial cases) is aberrant activation of the germline ALK signaling pathway, which results from point variants in the tyrosine kinase domain of the ALK gene.[16] Somatic activating point variants in ALK are also seen in about 9% of sporadic neuroblastoma cases. In addition, in a small proportion of neuroblastoma cases with MYCN amplification, ALK is co-amplified (ALK is near MYCN on chromosome 2), which may also result in ALK activation. ALK is a tyrosine kinase receptor. For more information about ALK variants, see the Genomic and Biological Features of Neuroblastoma section.\n\nPHOX2B gene variant. Rarely, familial neuroblastoma may be associated with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (Ondine curse), which is caused by a germline variant of the PHOX2B gene.[17] Most PHOX2B variants causing Ondine curse or Hirschsprung disease are polyalanine repeats and are not associated with familial neuroblastoma. However, germline loss-of-function PHOX2B variants have been identified in rare patients with sporadic neuroblastoma and Ondine curse and/or Hirschsprung disease.[18] This aberration has not been seen in patients with sporadic neuroblastoma without associated Ondine curse or Hirschsprung disease. Additionally, somatic PHOX2B variants occur in about 2% of sporadic cases of neuroblastoma.[19,20]\n\nDeletion at the 1p36 or 11q14-23 locus. In case studies, germline deletion at the 1p36 or 11q14-23 locus has been associated with familial neuroblastoma. The same deletions are found somatically in some sporadic neuroblastoma cases.[21,22]\n\nOther cancer predisposition syndromes. Children with gene aberrations associated with other cancer predisposition syndromes may be at increased risk of developing neuroblastoma and other malignancies. The following syndromes primarily involve genes in the canonical RAS pathway:\n\nCostello syndrome.[23]\n\nNoonan syndrome.[24]\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 1.[25]\n\nIn addition, neuroblastoma has been described in patients with the following syndromes:\n\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome.\n\nHereditary pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma syndromes.[26]\n\nROHHAD syndrome (rapid-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysfunction).[27]\n\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.[28]\n\nWith increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4.[29] In another study of 786 patients with neuroblastoma, 13.9% had pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in cancer predisposition genes. BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls. Patients with these alterations had inferior survival, compared with patients without these alterations.[30]\n\nSporadic neuroblastoma may also have an increased incidence resulting from less potent germline predispositions. Genome-wide association studies have identified several common genomic variables (single nucleotide polymorphisms) with modest effect size that are associated with increased risk of developing neuroblastoma. Most of these genomic risk variables are significantly associated with distinct neuroblastoma phenotypes (i.e., high-risk vs. low-risk disease).[31]\n\nNeuroblastoma predisposition and surveillance\n\nScreening recommendations from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) emerged from the 2016 Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop. The AACR recommends that the following individuals undergo biochemical and radiographic surveillance for early detection of tumors in the first 10 years of life:[26]\n\nIndividuals with highly penetrant, heritable ALK or PHOX2B variants (45%–50% risk of developing one or more tumors).\n\nIndividuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and germline TP53 p.R337H variants.\n\nIndividuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and germline CDKN1C variants.\n\nIndividuals with Costello syndrome and HRAS variants.\n\nIndividuals with neuroblastoma and a strong family history of neuroblastoma or clearly bilateral/multifocal neuroblastoma.\n\nSurveillance consists of the following:[26]\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography.\n\nQuantitative, normalized assessment of urinary catecholamines,[32] such as urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (can be a random urine collection normalized for urine creatinine, because this approach appears to have similar sensitivity to a 24-hour collection).\n\nChest x-ray.\n\nSurveillance begins at birth or at diagnosis of neuroblastoma predisposition and continues every 3 months until age 6 years, then every 6 months until age 10 years. Patients with Costello syndrome may have elevated urinary catecholamines in the absence of a catecholamine-secreting tumor, so only high or significantly rising levels should prompt investigation beyond ultrasonography and chest x-ray.[33] Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome should not undergo chest x-rays.[26]\n\nAbout 5% of children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have variants that cause decreased activity of CDKN1C. A review of all large studies of genetically subtyped Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome found 70 children with the CDKN1C variant, 4.6% of whom developed neuroblastoma. There were no cases of Wilms tumor or hepatoblastoma. There is little experience with screening these children for neuroblastoma, so there are no generally accepted guidelines. However, the authors of the study suggest screening with urinary VMA/HVA every 4 to 6 months. Patients with other genetic subtypes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a prevalence of neuroblastoma of less than 1%. No neuroblastic tumors were found among 123 children with the genotype gain of methylation at imprinting control region 1.[34]\n\nGeneral population\n\nCurrent data do not support neuroblastoma screening in the general public. Screening at the ages of 3 weeks, 6 months, or 1 year did not lead to a reduced incidence of advanced-stage neuroblastoma with unfavorable biological characteristics in older children, nor did it reduce overall mortality from neuroblastoma.[13,14] No public health benefits have been shown from screening infants for neuroblastoma at these ages. For more information, see Neuroblastoma Screening.\n\nEvidence (against neuroblastoma screening):\n\nIn a large population-based North American study, most infants in Quebec, Canada, were screened at the ages of 3 weeks and 6 months.[12,13]\n\nScreening detected many neuroblastomas with favorable characteristics that would never have been detected clinically because of spontaneous regression of the tumors.\n\nAnother study of infants screened at the age of 1 year showed similar results.[14]\n\nClinical Presentation\n\nThe most frequent signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma in children are caused by tumor mass and metastases and include the following:\n\nAbdominal mass: The most common presentation of neuroblastoma.\n\nProptosis and periorbital ecchymosis: Common in high-risk patients; arise from retrobulbar metastasis.\n\nAbdominal distention: May occur with respiratory compromise in infants because of massive liver metastases.\n\nBone pain: Occurs in association with metastatic disease.\n\nPancytopenia: May result from extensive bone marrow metastasis.\n\nFever, hypertension, and anemia: Occasionally found in patients without metastasis.\n\nParalysis: Neuroblastoma originating in paraspinal ganglia may invade through neural foramina and compress the spinal cord extradurally. Immediate treatment is given for symptomatic spinal cord compression. For more information, see the Treatment of Spinal Cord Compression section.\n\nWatery diarrhea: On rare occasions, children may have severe, watery diarrhea caused by the secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide by the tumor, or they may have protein-losing enteropathy with intestinal lymphangiectasia.[35] Vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion may occur at presentation (with diarrhea being the first symptom of neuroblastoma), may appear with the initiation of chemotherapy, or occasionally may become evident later in the course of treatment. Tumor resection reduces vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion.[36]\n\nPresence of Horner syndrome: Characterized by miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis. It may be caused by neuroblastoma in the stellate ganglion. Children with Horner syndrome without other apparent causes are also examined for neuroblastoma and other tumors.[37]\n\nSubcutaneous skin nodules: Subcutaneous metastases of neuroblastoma often have bluish discoloration of the overlying skin; usually seen only in infants.\n\nThe clinical presentation of neuroblastoma in adolescents is similar to that in children. The only exception is that bone marrow involvement occurs less frequently in adolescents, and there is a greater frequency of metastases in unusual sites such as lung or brain.[38]\n\nOpsoclonus/myoclonus syndrome\n\nParaneoplastic neurological findings, including cerebellar ataxia or opsoclonus/myoclonus, occur rarely in children with neuroblastoma.[39] Of young children presenting with opsoclonus/myoclonus syndrome, about one-half are found to have neuroblastoma.[40,41] The incidence in the United Kingdom is estimated at 0.18 cases per 1 million children per year. The average age at diagnosis is 1.5 to 2 years.[42]\n\nThe usual presentation is the onset of progressive neurological dysfunction over a few days before a neuroblastoma is discovered. However, on occasion, neurological symptoms arise long after removal of the primary tumor.[40,43,44] Patients with neuroblastoma who present with opsoclonus/myoclonus syndrome often have neuroblastoma with favorable biological features and have excellent survival rates, although tumor-related deaths have been reported.[40]\n\nThe opsoclonus/myoclonus syndrome appears to be caused by an immunologic mechanism that is not yet fully characterized.[40] The primary tumor is typically diffusely infiltrated with lymphocytes.[45] Cerebrospinal fluid shows an increased number of B cells, and oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands are often seen. Steroid-responsive elevations of B-cell–related cytokines are also often seen.[46]\n\nGenomic copy number profiles were analyzed in 44 cases of neuroblastoma associated with opsoclonus/myoclonus syndrome. Because there were no tumor relapses or disease-related deaths, the overall genomic profile was not prognostically significant.[47]\n\nSome patients may rapidly respond neurologically to immune interventions or simply to removal of the neuroblastoma, but in many cases, improvement may be slow and partial. The improvement in acutely presenting motor deficits and ataxia seen with immunological therapy is not clearly associated with improvement in long-term neuropsychological disability, which primarily consists of cognitive and behavioral deficits. The long-term benefits of rapid improvement resulting from treatment, whether of symptoms or of the underlying neuroblastoma, are unclear, but rapid improvement appears to be worthwhile.[44,48]\n\nTreatment with adrenocorticotropic hormones or corticosteroids can be effective for acute symptoms, but some patients do not respond to corticosteroids.[43,49] Other therapy with various immunomodulatory drugs, plasmapheresis, intravenous gamma globulin, and rituximab have been reported to be effective in select cases.[43,50-53] Combination immunosuppressive therapy has been explored, with improved short-term results.[54] The short-term neurological outcomes may be superior in patients treated with chemotherapy, possibly because of its immunosuppressive effects.[39]\n\nThe Children’s Oncology Group (COG) has completed the first randomized, open-label, phase III study of patients with opsoclonus/myoclonus ataxia syndrome.[55] Patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma and opsoclonus/myoclonus ataxia syndrome who were younger than 8 years were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or no IVIG in addition to prednisone and risk-adapted treatment of the tumor.[55]\n\nOf the 53 patients who participated, 21 of 26 patients (81%) in the IVIG group had an opsoclonus/myoclonus ataxia syndrome response over a period of weeks to months, compared with 11 of 27 patients (41%) in the non-IVIG group (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; P = .0029).\n\nThis study demonstrated that short-term neurological response is improved in patients treated with chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin, compared with patients treated with chemotherapy and corticosteroids without immunoglobulin.\n\nAdditional follow-up is needed to assess long-term neurodevelopmental and learning problems in this population.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnostic evaluation of neuroblastoma includes the following:\n\nTumor imaging: Imaging of the primary tumor mass is generally accomplished by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast. Paraspinal tumors that might threaten spinal cord compression are imaged using MRI.\n\nMetaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning is a critical part of the standard diagnostic evaluation of neuroblastoma, for both the primary tumor and sites of metastases.[56,57] MIBG scanning is also critical to assess response to therapy.[57] About 90% of neuroblastoma cases are MIBG avid. Fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans are used to evaluate extent of disease in patients with tumors that are not MIBG avid.[58] For more information about imaging of neuroblastoma, see the Stage Information for Neuroblastoma section.\n\nUrine catecholamine metabolites: Urinary excretion of the catecholamine metabolites VMA and HVA per milligram of excreted creatinine is measured before therapy. Collection of urine for 24 hours is not needed. If they remain elevated, these markers can be used to suggest the persistence of disease.\n\nIn contrast to urine, serum catecholamines are not routinely used in the diagnosis of neuroblastoma except in unusual circumstances.\n\nBiopsy: Tumor tissue is often needed to obtain all the biological data required for risk-group assignment and subsequent treatment stratification in current COG clinical trials. There is an absolute requirement for tissue biopsy to determine the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC). Additionally, a significant number of tumor cells are needed to determine MYCN copy number, DNA index, and the presence of segmental chromosomal aberrations. Tissue from several core biopsies, or approximately 1 cm3 of tissue from an open biopsy, is needed for adequate biological staging.\n\nFor patients older than 18 months with stage 4 disease, bone marrow with extensive tumor involvement combined with elevated catecholamine metabolites may be adequate for diagnosis and assigning risk/treatment group. However, INPC cannot be determined from tumor metastatic to bone marrow. Testing for MYCN amplification may be successfully performed on involved bone marrow if there is at least 30% tumor involvement. However, every attempt should be made to obtain an adequate biopsy from the primary tumor.\n\nFor information about the use of biopsy in patients younger than 1 year, see the Observation and Spontaneous Regression of Fetal/Neonatal Neuroblastoma section.\n\nThe diagnosis of neuroblastoma requires the involvement of pathologists who are familiar with childhood tumors. Some neuroblastomas cannot be differentiated morphologically, via conventional light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin staining alone, from other small round blue cell tumors of childhood, such as lymphomas, Ewing sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcomas. In such cases, immunohistochemical and cytogenetic analysis may be needed to diagnose a specific small round blue cell tumor.\n\nThe minimum criterion for a diagnosis of neuroblastoma, as established by international agreement, is that diagnosis must be based on one of the following:\n\nAn unequivocal pathological diagnosis made from tumor tissue by light microscopy (with or without immunohistology or electron microscopy).[59]\n\nThe combination of bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy containing unequivocal tumor cells (e.g., syncytia or immunocytologically positive clumps of cells) and increased levels of urinary catecholamine metabolites.[59]\n\nObservation and Spontaneous Regression of Fetal/Neonatal Neuroblastoma\n\nThe phenomenon of spontaneous regression has been well described in infants with neuroblastoma, especially in infants with the INSS 4S/INRG MS pattern of metastatic spread.[60] In rare cases, neuroblastoma may be discovered prenatally by fetal ultrasonography.[61] Management recommendations are evolving regarding the need for immediate diagnostic biopsy in infants aged 6 months and younger with suspected neuroblastoma tumors that are likely to spontaneous regress. For more information about INSS 4S/INRG MS disease, see the Stage Information for Neuroblastoma section.\n\nSpontaneous regression generally occurs in tumors with the following features:[62-64]\n\nNear triploid number of chromosomes.\n\nNo MYCN amplification.\n\nNo loss of chromosome 1p.\n\nAdditional features associated with spontaneous regression include the lack of telomerase expression,[62,65] the expression of the H-Ras protein,[66] and the expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkA, a nerve growth factor receptor.[67]\n\nStudies have suggested that selected infants who appear to have asymptomatic, small, low-stage adrenal neuroblastoma detected by screening or during prenatal or incidental ultrasonography often have tumors that spontaneously regress. These patients may be observed safely without surgical intervention or tissue diagnosis.[68-70]\n\nEvidence (observation [spontaneous regression]):\n\nIn a COG study, 83 highly selected infants younger than 6 months with stage 1 small adrenal masses (3.1 cm or less), as defined by imaging studies, were observed without biopsy. Surgical intervention was reserved for those with growth or progression of the mass or increasing concentrations of urinary catecholamine metabolites.[71]\n\nEighty-one percent of patients did not undergo surgery, and all patients were alive after 2 years of follow-up. For more information, see the Surgery section.\n\nTherefore, prenatally identified adrenal masses approximately 3.1 cm or less can be safely observed if no metastatic disease is identified and there is no involvement of large vessels or organs.\n\nA German clinical trial reported on 340 infants with localized neuroblastoma without MYCN amplification. Of these patients, 190 underwent resection, 57 were treated with chemotherapy, and 93 were observed with gross residual tumor.[72]\n\nSpontaneous regression and/or lack of progression occurred in 44 of 93 asymptomatic infants aged 12 months or younger with stage 1, 2, or 3 tumors without MYCN amplification.\n\nAll patients were observed after biopsy and partial or no resection.\n\nIn some cases, regression did not occur until more than 1 year after diagnosis.\n\nIn neuroblastoma screening trials in Quebec, Canada, and Germany, the incidence of neuroblastoma was twice that reported without screening, suggesting that many neuroblastomas are never diagnosed clinically and spontaneously regress.[12-14]\n\nPrognostic Factors\n\nThe prognosis for patients with neuroblastoma is related to the following:\n\nSome of these prognostic factors have been combined to create risk groups to help define treatment. For more information, see the sections on International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS) and Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Neuroblastoma Risk Grouping.\n\nTreatment era\n\nBetween 1975 and 2017, the 5-year survival rate for neuroblastoma in the United States increased from 86% to 91% for children younger than 1 year and from 34% to 83% for children aged 1 to 14 years.[2,3] The 5-year relative survival rate for all infants and children with neuroblastoma increased from 46% when diagnosed between 1974 and 1989 to 71% when diagnosed between 1999 and 2005.[73] More recent estimates from 2011 to 2017 show an even higher survival rate of approximately 85% for infants and children younger than 15 years.[2] These statistics can be misleading because of the extremely heterogeneous prognosis based on the patient's age, stage, and biology. However, studies demonstrate a significant improvement in survival for high-risk patients diagnosed and treated between 2000 and 2010, compared with patients diagnosed from 1990 to 1999.[74] For more information, see Table 1. Similarly, the COG ANBL0531 (NCT00499616) study found equivalent outcomes for many subsets of intermediate-risk children who were treated with substantially reduced chemotherapy, compared with the earlier COG-A3961 (NCT00003093) study.[75]\n\nAge at diagnosis\n\nInfants and children\n\nThe effect of age at diagnosis on 5-year survival is profound. In the COG ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) study of 4,832 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma, those younger than 18 months had a 5-year EFS rate of 82% and an OS rate of 91%. In comparison, patients aged 18 months or older had a 5-year EFS rate of 64% and an OS rate of 74%.[76]\n\nAccording to the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR), the 5-year relative survival rates from 2011 to 2017 were as follows:[2]\n\nAged younger than 1 year: 91%.\n\nAged 1 to 4 years: 79%.\n\nAged 5 to 9 years: 79%.\n\nAged 10 to 14 years: 91%.\n\nThe effect of patient age on prognosis is strongly influenced by clinical and pathobiological factors, as evidenced by the following:\n\nSince 2000, nonrandomized studies of low-risk and intermediate-risk patients have demonstrated that patient age has no effect on outcome of INSS stage 1 or stage 2A disease. However, stage 2B patients younger than 18 months had a 5-year OS rate of 99% (± 1%) versus 90% (± 4%) for children aged 18 months and older.[77]\n\nIn the COG intermediate-risk study A3961 (NCT00003093) that included only MYCN-nonamplified tumors, infants with INSS stage 3 tumors were compared with children with INSS stage 3 favorable-histology tumors. When INSS stage 3 infants with any histology were compared with stage 3 children with favorable histology, only EFS rates, not OS rates, were significantly different (3-year EFS rate, 95% ± 2% vs. 87% ± 3%; OS rate, 98% ± 1% vs. 99% ± 1%).[78]\n\nInfants younger than 12 months with INSS stage 4 disease and MYCN amplification are categorized as high risk and have a 5-year EFS rate of 37% and an OS rate of 45%.[76] Toddlers aged 12 months to younger than 18 months with stage 4 disease and MYCN-amplified tumors had a 5-year EFS rate of 53% and an OS rate of 54%.[76]\n\nAdolescents and young adults\n\nAdolescents and adults rarely develop neuroblastoma, accounting for less than 5% of all cases. When neuroblastoma occurs in this age range, it shows a more indolent clinical course than neuroblastoma in younger patients, and it shows de novo chemotherapy resistance.[79] Neuroblastoma in adolescents and young adults may also exhibit unusual clinicopathological characteristics such as large tumors, bilateral adrenal disease, and pheochromocytoma-like features.[80][Level of evidence C1] Neuroblastoma has a worse long-term prognosis in adolescents older than 10 years or in adults, regardless of stage or site.\n\nAlthough adolescent and young adult patients have infrequent MYCN amplification (9% in patients aged 10–21 years), older children with advanced disease have a poor rate of survival. Tumors from the adolescent and young adult population commonly have segmental chromosomal aberrations, and ALK and ATRX variants are much more frequent.[81-83] In adolescents, approximately 40% of the tumors have loss-of-function variants in ATRX, compared with less than 20% in younger children and 0% in infants younger than 1 year.[79] Complex DNA microarray findings and novel variants have been reported in some patients.[80][Level of evidence C1]\n\nThe 5-year OS rate for adolescent and young adult patients (aged 15–39 years) is 38%.[84][Level of evidence C1] The 5-year EFS rate is 32% for patients between the ages of 10 years and 21 years, and the OS rate is 46%. For patients with stage 4 disease, the 10-year EFS rate is 3%, and the OS rate is 5%.[85] Aggressive chemotherapy and surgery have been shown to achieve a minimal disease state in more than 50% of these patients.[38,86] Other modalities, such as local radiation therapy, autologous stem cell transplant, and the use of agents with confirmed activity, may improve the poor prognosis for adolescents and adults.[85,86]\n\nAdults\n\nThe biology of adult-onset neuroblastoma appears to differ from the biology of pediatric or adolescent neuroblastoma based on a single-institution series of 44 patients (aged 18–71 years).[87]\n\nGenetic abnormalities in adult patients included somatic ATRX (58%) and ALK variants (42%) but no MYCN amplification.\n\nGermline testing was performed in four patients, two of whom had aberrations (one patient with a BRCA1 variant, the other patient with TP53 and NF1 variants).\n\nIn the 11 patients with locoregional disease, the 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 35%, and the OS rate was 61%.\n\nAmong 33 adults with stage 4 neuroblastoma, 7 patients (21%) achieved a complete response (CR) after induction chemotherapy and/or surgery. In patients with stage 4 disease at diagnosis, the 5-year PFS rate was 10%, and most patients who were alive with disease at 5 years died of neuroblastoma over the next 5 years. The 10-year OS rate was 19%. CR after induction was the only prognostic factor for PFS and OS.\n\nAnti-GD2 immunotherapy (m3F8 or hu3F8) was well tolerated in adults.\n\nAs noted above, adult-onset neuroblastoma is enriched for activating ALK variants. In a single-institution retrospective study, 13 adults (median age, 34 years; range, 16–71 years) with relapsed, ALK-altered neuroblastoma were treated with lorlatinib. Nine patients (69%) had a complete or partial response, five of whom were previously treated with other ALK inhibitors. Lorlatinib was associated with significant adverse events requiring dose reduction. However, responses were seen using doses below the recommended adult dose.[88]\n\nTumor histology\n\nNeuroblastoma tumor histology has a significant impact on prognosis and risk group assignment. For more information, see the Classification of Neuroblastic Tumors section and Table 3.\n\nIn the ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) study of 4,832 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma, 52% of patients were classified as favorable and 48% as unfavorable, according to the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC). For patients with tumors classified as favorable, the 5-year EFS rate was 88%, and the 5-year OS rate was 96%. For patients with tumors classified as unfavorable, the 5-year EFS rate was 55%, and the 5-year OS rate was 66% (P < .0001).[76]\n\nHistological characteristics considered prognostically favorable include the following:\n\nCellular differentiation/maturation. Higher degrees of neuroblastic maturation confer improved prognosis for stage 4 patients with segmental chromosome changes without MYCN amplification. Neuroblastoma tumors containing many differentiating cells, termed ganglioneuroblastoma, can have diffuse differentiation conferring a very favorable prognosis or can have nodules of undifferentiated cells, termed nodular ganglioneuroblastoma, whose histology, along with MYCN status, determine prognosis.[89,90]\n\nSchwannian stroma.\n\nCystic neuroblastoma. About 25% of reported neuroblastomas diagnosed in the fetus and neonate are cystic. Patients with cystic neuroblastomas have tumors with lower disease stages and a higher incidence of favorable biology.[91]\n\nHigh mitosis/karyorrhexis index and undifferentiated tumor cells are considered prognostically unfavorable histological characteristics, but the prognostic value is age dependent.[92,93]\n\nA COG study (P9641 [NCT00003119]) investigated the effect of histology, among other factors, on outcome. Of 915 children with stage 1 and stage 2 neuroblastoma without MYCN amplification, 87% were treated with initial surgery and observation. Patients (13%) who had or were at risk of developing symptomatic disease, or who had less than 50% tumor resection at diagnosis, or who had unresectable progressive disease after surgery alone, were treated with chemotherapy and surgery. Those with favorable histological features reported a 5-year EFS rate of 90% to 94% and an OS rate of 99% to 100%. Those with unfavorable histology had an EFS rate of 80% to 86% and an OS rate of 89% to 93%.[77]\n\nIn the COG ANBL0531 (NCT00499616) study for intermediate-risk patients with neuroblastoma, treatment was assigned using a biology-based and response-based algorithm, which included allelic status of 1p36 and 11q23. Patients with MYCN-amplified tumors were excluded.[75]\n\nEFS was statistically significantly better for infants with stage 4 disease with favorable tumor biology (n = 61) (3-year EFS rate, 86.9%; 95% CI, 78.3%–95.4%), compared with those with confirmed unfavorable tumor biology (n = 47) (3-year EFS rate, 66.8%; 95% CI, 53.1%–80.6%; P = .02).\n\nOS for infants with stage 4 disease and favorable tumor biology showed a trend toward OS advantage (3-year OS rate, 95.0%; 95% CI, 89.5%–100% vs. 86.7%; 95% CI, 76.6%–96.7%; P = .08).\n\nAmong the group 4 infants (n = 24) with stage 4 disease with confirmed diploid or unfavorable histology tumors, with or without 1p36/11q23 loss of heterozygosity, the 3-year EFS rate estimate was 63.9% (95% CI, 43.8%–84.0%), and the 3-year OS rate estimate was 77.3% (95% CI, 59.2%–95.3%).\n\nFor infants with stage 4 hyperdiploid favorable histology tumors assigned to group 4 because of 1p36/11q23 loss of heterozygosity or unknown allelic status (n = 32), the 3-year EFS and OS rate estimates were 68.6% (95% CI, 52.2%–85.1%) and 93.8% (95% CI, 85.2%–100%), respectively.\n\nThe EFS and OS rate estimates for the eight toddlers (aged 12–18 months) with stage 4 hyperdiploid favorable histology tumors were 62.5% (95% CI, 28.9%–96.1%) and 100%, respectively.\n\nPatients with favorable biology and localized disease had a 100% survival rate.\n\nA study using data from the INRG Data Commons evaluated the prognostic strength of the underlying INPC histological criteria. The independent prognostic ability of age, histological category, mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI), and grade was demonstrated. Four age-related, histological prognostic groups were identified (aged <18 months with low vs. high MKI, and aged ≥18 months with differentiated vs. undifferentiated/poorly differentiated tumors). Compared with survival trees generated with established COG risk criteria, an additional prognostic subgroup was identified and validated when individual histological features were analyzed in lieu of INPC. Thus, replacing INPC with individual histological features in the future COG risk classification may eliminate the duplication of the prognostic contribution of age, facilitate international harmonization of risk classification, and provide a schema for more precise prognostication and refined therapeutic approaches.[94] The INPC is described in the Classification of Neuroblastic Tumors section.\n\nBiological features\n\nFor more information, see the Genomic and Biological Features of Neuroblastoma section.\n\nSite of primary tumor\n\nClinical and biological features of neuroblastoma differ by primary tumor site. In a study of data on 8,389 patients in clinical trials and compiled by the International Risk Group Project, the following results were observed, confirming the results from much smaller, previous studies with less complete clinical and biological data:[95]\n\nAdrenal tumors. Adrenal primary tumors were more likely than tumors originating in other sites to be associated with unfavorable prognostic features, including MYCN amplification, even after researchers controlled for age, stage, and histological grade. Adrenal neuroblastomas were also associated with a higher incidence of stage 4 tumors, segmental chromosomal aberrations, diploidy, unfavorable INPC histology, age younger than 18 months, and elevated levels of LDH and ferritin. The relative risk of MYCN amplification compared with adrenal tumors was 0.7 in abdominal nonadrenal tumors and about 0.1 in nonabdominal paraspinal tumors.\n\nThoracic tumors. Thoracic tumors were compared with nonthoracic tumors. After researchers controlled for age, stage, and histological grade, results showed patients with thoracic tumors had fewer deaths and recurrences (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.92), and thoracic tumors had a lower incidence of MYCN amplification (adjusted OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.11–0.39).\n\nUsing the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effect Treatments (TARGET) and genome-wide association study data sets, a study compared the genomic and epigenomic data of primary diagnostic neuroblastomas originating in the adrenal gland (n = 646) with that of neuroblastomas originating in the thoracic sympathetic ganglia (n = 118). Neuroblastomas arising in the adrenal gland were more likely to harbor structural DNA aberrations such as MYCN amplification, whereas thoracic tumors showed defects in mitotic checkpoints resulting in hyperdiploidy. Thoracic tumors were more likely to harbor gain-of-function ALK aberrations than were adrenal tumors among all cases (OR, 1.89; P = .04), and among cases without MYCN amplification (OR, 2.86; P = .003). Because 16% of thoracic tumors harbor ALK variants, routine sequencing for these variants in this setting should be considered.[96]\n\nIn the TARGET cohort, 70% of patients with adrenal primary tumors and 51% of patients with thoracic primary tumors were stage 4. In the genome-wide association study without MYCN amplification, 43% of patients with adrenal primary tumors and 17% of patients with thoracic primary tumors were stage 4. By multivariate analysis, adrenal site was an independent predictor of worse outcome in the genome-wide association study cohort but not in the TARGET cohort after adjusting for MYCN amplification status, disease stage, and age of at least 18 months. Adrenal neuroblastoma was not an independent predictor of worse EFS by similar multivariable analysis for either the genome-wide association study or TARGET cohorts.[96]\n\nIt is not clear whether the effect of primary neuroblastoma tumor site on prognosis is entirely dependent on the differences in tumor biology associated with tumor site.\n\nMultifocal neuroblastoma occurs rarely, usually in infants, and generally has a good prognosis.[97] Familial neuroblastoma and germline ALK gene variant should be considered in patients with multiple primary neuroblastomas.\n\nStage of disease\n\nSeveral imaged-based and surgery-based systems were used for assigning disease stage before the 1990s. In an effort to compare results obtained throughout the world, a surgical pathological staging system, termed the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS), was developed.[59] The INSS predicted outcome on the basis of stage at diagnosis, although important interactions with biological variables were also found.[3,4,11,59,77,78,98-100] However, because surgical approaches differ from one institution to another, INSS stage for patients with locoregional disease may also vary considerably. To define extent of disease at diagnosis in a uniform manner, a presurgical International Neuroblastoma Risk Group staging system (INRGSS) was developed for the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Classification System.[101,102] The INRGSS is currently used in North American and European cooperative group studies. This staging system is not affected by locoregional lymph node involvement.\n\nFor the patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma enrolled in the ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) study, the 5-years EFS and OS rates, according to INRGSS stage, were the following:[76]\n\n90% and 98% for patients with stage L1 disease.\n\n84% and 95% for patients with stage L2 disease.\n\n52% and 64% for patients with stage M disease.\n\n86% and 92% for patients with stage MS disease.\n\nFor more information, see the following sections:\n\nResponse to treatment\n\nResponse to treatment has been associated with outcome. In patients with intermediate-risk disease who had a poor response to initial therapy in the COG ANBL0531 (NCT00499616) study, 6 of 20 patients subsequently developed progressive or recurrent disease, and one patient died.[75]\n\nIn patients with high-risk disease, the persistence of neuroblastoma cells in bone marrow after induction chemotherapy, for example, is associated with a poor prognosis. Sensitive techniques that detect minimal residual disease may be used to assess prognosis.[103-105] Similarly, the persistence of MIBG-avid tumor measured as Curie score greater than 2 after completion of induction therapy predicts a poor prognosis for patients with MYCN-nonamplified high-risk tumors. A Curie score greater than 0 after induction therapy is associated with a worse outcome for high-risk patients with MYCN-amplified disease.[106,107] An analysis of North American patients who went on to receive tandem transplants showed that patients with Curie scores greater than 0 at the end of induction therapy had inferior EFS rates.[108] For more information about Curie scoring, see the Curie and SIOPEN scoring methods section.\n\nIn an analysis of patients from four consecutive COG high-risk trials, an end-induction response of partial response (PR) or better, according to the 1993 International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria,[59] was significantly associated with higher EFS and OS. On multivariable analysis (n = 407), the absence of 11q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was the only factor that remained significantly associated with PR or better (OR, 1.962 vs. 11q LOH; 95% CI, 1.104–3.487; P = .0216).[109]\n\nA treatment-associated decrease in mitosis and an increase in histological differentiation of the primary tumor are also prognostic of response.[110]\n\nThe accuracy of prognostication based on decrease in primary tumor size is less clear. In a study conducted by seven large international centers, 229 high-risk patients were treated in a variety of ways. Treatment included chemotherapy, surgical removal of the primary tumor, radiation to the tumor bed, high-dose myeloablative therapy plus stem cell transplant, and, in most cases, isotretinoin and anti-GD2 antibody immunotherapy enhanced by cytokines. Primary tumor response was measured after induction chemotherapy in three ways: as 30% or greater reduction in the longest dimension, 50% or greater reduction in tumor volume, or 65% or greater reduction in tumor volume (calculated from three tumor dimensions, a conventional radiological technique). The measurements were performed at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy before primary tumor resection. None of the methods of measuring primary tumor response at end of induction chemotherapy predicted survival.[111]\n\nLevels of LDH and ferritin\n\nHigher serum LDH and ferritin values conferred worse 5-year EFS and OS rates in a large international cohort of patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma (n > 8,575) from 1990 to 2016. Higher serum values for LDH and ferritin also conferred worse 3-year EFS and OS rates in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma after 2009. In a multivariate analysis that adjusted for age at diagnosis, MYCN status, and INSS stage 4 disease, LDH and ferritin maintained independent prognostic ability (P < .0001).[112][Level of evidence C1]\n\nAlthough not critically evaluated in the original INRG classification system, subsequent analysis of the INRG Data Commons has clearly demonstrated independent statistical significance of the levels of serum ferritin and LDH on prognosis in all patients and in high-risk patients, including in the time period between 2010 and 2016. Therefore, it was suggested that these two easily obtainable lab values be incorporated into the prognostic classification system of the INRG.[112]\n\nReferences\n\nChildhood cancer by the ICCC.

[PUBMED Abstract]\n\nGenomic and Biological Features of Neuroblastoma\n\nMolecular features of neuroblastoma\n\nChildren with neuroblastoma can be divided into subsets with different predicted risks of relapse on the basis of clinical factors and biological markers at the time of diagnosis.\n\nLow-risk or intermediate-risk neuroblastoma patients. Patients classified as low risk or intermediate risk have a favorable prognosis, with survival rates exceeding 95%. Low-risk and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma usually occur in children younger than 18 months. These tumors commonly have gains of whole chromosomes and are hyperdiploid when examined by flow cytometry.[1,2]\n\nHigh-risk neuroblastoma patients. The prognosis is more guarded for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, with a long-term survival rate of less than 50%. High-risk neuroblastoma generally occurs in children older than 18 months and is often metastatic to bone and bone marrow. Segmental chromosome abnormalities (gains or losses) and/or MYCN gene amplification are usually detected in these tumors. They are near diploid or near tetraploid by flow cytometric measurement.[1-7] High-risk tumors may rarely harbor exonic variants, but most high-risk tumors lack such gene variants. For more information, see the Exonic Variants in Neuroblastoma section.\n\nKey genomic characteristics of high-risk neuroblastoma that are discussed below include the following:\n\nSegmental chromosomal aberrations.\n\nMYCN gene amplifications.\n\nFOXR2 activation.\n\nLow rates of exonic variants, with activating variants in ALK being the most common recurring alteration.\n\nGenomic alterations that promote telomere maintenance.\n\nSegmental chromosomal aberrations\n\nSegmental chromosomal aberrations, found most frequently in 1p, 2p, 1q, 3p, 11q, 14q, and 17p, are best detected by comparative genomic hybridization. These aberrations are seen in most high-risk and/or stage 4 neuroblastoma tumors.[3,4,6-8] Among all patients with neuroblastoma, a higher number of chromosome breakpoints (i.e., a higher number of segmental chromosome aberrations) correlated with the following:[3-7][Level of evidence C2]\n\nAdvanced age at diagnosis.\n\nAdvanced stage of disease.\n\nHigher risk of relapse.\n\nPoorer outcome.\n\nIn an analysis of localized, resectable, non-MYCN amplified neuroblastoma, cases from two consecutive European studies and a North American cohort (including INSS stages 1, 2A, and 2B) were analyzed for segmental chromosome aberrations (namely gain of 1q, 2p, and 17q and loss of 1p, 3p, 4p, and 11q). The study revealed a different prognostic impact of tumor genomics depending on patient age (<18 months or >18 months). Patients were treated with surgery alone regardless of a tumor residuum.[9][Level of evidence C1]\n\nThe presence of segmental chromosome aberrations, especially 11q loss, significantly reduced survival in patients older than 18 months with stage 2 neuroblastoma but not in the cohort of patients younger than 18 months.\n\nChromosome 1p loss is a risk factor for relapse but not for diminished overall survival (OS) in patients younger than 18 months. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 62% for patients with 1p loss and 87% for patients with no 1p loss (P = .019). The 5-year OS rate was 92% for patients with 1p loss and 97% for patients with no 1p loss.\n\nSegmental chromosome aberrations (especially 11q loss) are risk factors for reduced EFS and OS in patients older than 18 months. In patients younger than 18 months, only segmental chromosome aberrations led to relapse and death, with 11q loss as the strongest marker (11q loss: 5-year EFS rate, 48%; no 11q loss: 5-year EFS rate, 85%; P = .033; 11q loss: 5-year OS rate, 46%; no 11q loss: 5-year OS rate, 92%; P = .038).\n\nIn a study of children older than 12 months who had unresectable primary neuroblastomas without metastases, segmental chromosomal aberrations were found in most patients. Older children were more likely to have them and to have more of them per tumor cell. In children aged 12 to 18 months, the presence of segmental chromosomal aberrations had a significant effect on EFS but not on OS. However, in children older than 18 months, there was a significant difference in OS between children with segmental chromosomal aberrations (67%) and children without segmental chromosomal aberrations (100%), regardless of tumor histology.[7]\n\nSegmental chromosomal aberrations are also predictive of recurrence in infants with localized unresectable or metastatic neuroblastoma without MYCN gene amplification.[1,2] An analysis of 133 patients (aged ≥18 months) with INSS stage 3 tumors without MYCN amplification demonstrated that segmental chromosomal aberrations were associated with inferior EFS, and 11q loss was independently associated with worse OS.[10]\n\nIn an analysis of intermediate-risk patients in a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study, 11q loss, but not 1p loss, was associated with reduced EFS but not OS (11q loss and no 11q loss: 3-year EFS rates, 68% and 85%, respectively; P = .022; 3-year OS rates, 88% and 94%, respectively; P = .09).[11][Level of evidence B4]\n\nIn a multivariable analysis of 407 patients from four consecutive COG high-risk trials, 11q loss of heterozygosity was shown to be a significant predictor of progressive disease, and lack of 11q loss of heterozygosity was associated with both higher rates of end-induction complete response and end-induction partial response.[12][Level of evidence C1]\n\nAn international collaboration studied 556 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma and identified two types of segmental copy number aberrations that were associated with extremely poor outcome. Distal 6q losses were found in 6% of patients and were associated with a 10-year survival rate of only 3.4%. Amplifications of regions not encompassing the MYCN locus, in addition to MYCN amplification, were detected in 18% of the patients and were associated with a 10-year survival rate of 5.8%.[13]\n\nMYCN gene amplification\n\nMYCN amplification is detected in 16% to 25% of neuroblastoma tumors.[14] Among patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, 40% to 50% of cases show MYCN amplification.[15]\n\nIn all stages of disease, amplification of the MYCN gene strongly predicts a poorer prognosis, in both time to tumor progression and OS, in almost all multivariate regression analyses of prognostic factors.[1,2] In the ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) study of 4,832 newly diagnosed patients enrolled between 2007 to 2017, the 5-year EFS and OS rates were 77% and 87%, respectively, for patients whose tumors were MYCN nonamplified (n = 3,647; 81%). In comparison, the 5-year EFS and OS rates were 51% and 57%, respectively, for patients whose tumors were MYCN amplified (n = 827; 19%).[8]\n\nWithin the localized-tumor MYCN-amplified cohort, patients with hyperdiploid tumors have better outcomes than do patients with diploid tumors.[16] However, patients with hyperdiploid tumors with MYCN amplification or any segmental chromosomal aberrations do relatively poorly, compared with patients with hyperdiploid tumors without MYCN amplification.[3]\n\nMost unfavorable clinical and pathobiological features are associated, to some degree, with MYCN amplification. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis of 7,102 patients in the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) study, pooled segmental chromosomal aberrations and gains of 17q were poor prognostic features, even when not associated with MYCN amplification. However, another poor prognostic feature, segmental chromosomal aberrations at 11q, are almost entirely mutually exclusive of MYCN amplification.[17,18]\n\nIn a cohort of 6,223 patients from the INRG database with known MYCN status, the OS hazard ratio (HR) associated with MYCN amplification was 6.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–7.0; P < .001). The greatest adverse prognostic impact of MYCN amplification for OS was in the youngest patients (aged <18 months: HR, 19.6; aged ≥18 months: HR, 3.0). Patients whose outcome was most impacted by MYCN status were those with otherwise favorable features, including age younger than 18 months, high mitosis-karyorrhexis index, and low ferritin.[19][Level of evidence C1]\n\nIntratumoral heterogeneous MYCN amplification (hetMNA) refers to the coexistence of MYCN-amplified cells as a cluster or as single scattered cells and non-MYCN–amplified tumor cells. HetMNA has been reported infrequently. It can occur spatially within the tumor as well as between the tumor and the metastasis at the same time or temporally during the disease course. The International Society of Paediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) biology group investigated the prognostic significance of this neuroblastoma subtype. Tumor tissue from 99 patients identified as having hetMNA and diagnosed between 1991 and 2015 was analyzed to elucidate the prognostic significance of MYCN-amplified clones in otherwise non-MYCN–amplified neuroblastomas. Patients younger than 18 months showed a better outcome in all stages compared with older patients. The genomic background correlated significantly with relapse frequency and OS. No relapses occurred in cases of only numerical chromosomal aberrations. This study suggests that hetMNA tumors be evaluated in the context of the genomic tumor background in combination with the clinical pattern, including the patient's age and disease stage. Future studies are needed in patients younger than 18 months who have localized disease with hetMNA.[20]\n\nFOXR2 activation\n\nFOXR2 gene expression is observed in approximately 8% of neuroblastoma cases. FOXR2 gene expression is normally absent postnatally, with the exception of male reproductive tissues.[21] FOXR2 expression is also observed in a subset of central nervous system (CNS) primitive neuroectodermal tumors, termed CNS NB-FOXR2.[22] FOXR2 overexpression was virtually mutually exclusive in neuroblastoma tumors with both elevated MYC and MYCN expression. Although MYCN gene expression was not elevated in neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation, the gene expression profile for the FOXR2 expressing cases closely resembled that of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. FOXR2 binds MYCN and appears to stabilize the MYCN protein, leading to high levels of MYCN protein in neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation. This finding provides an explanation for the similar gene expression profiles for neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation and neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification.\n\nNeuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation is observed at comparable rates in high-risk and non–high-risk cases.[21] Among high-risk cases, outcomes for patients whose tumors showed FOXR2 activation were similar to those for cases with MYCN amplification. In a multivariable analysis, FOXR2 activation was significantly associated with inferior OS, along with INSS stage 4, age 18 months or older, and MYCN amplification.\n\nExonic variants in neuroblastoma (including ALK variants and amplification)\n\nCompared with adult cancers, pediatric neuroblastoma tumors show a low number of variants per genome that affect protein sequence (10–20 per genome).[23] The most common gene variant is ALK, which is altered in approximately 10% of patients (see below). Other genes with even lower frequencies of variants include ATRX, PTPN11, ARID1A, and ARID1B.[24-30] As shown in Figure 2, most neuroblastoma cases lack variants in genes that are altered in a recurrent manner.\n\nThe ALK gene provides instructions for making a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, expressed at significant levels only in developing embryonic and neonatal brains. ALK is the exonic variant found most commonly in neuroblastoma. Germline variants in ALK have been identified as the major cause of hereditary neuroblastoma. Somatically acquired ALK-activating exonic are also found as oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma.[29]\n\nTwo large cohort studies examined the clinical correlates and prognostic significance of ALK alterations. One study from the COG examined ALK status in 1,596 diagnostic neuroblastoma samples across all risk groups.[29] Another study from SIOPEN evaluated 1,092 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.[31]\n\nALK tyrosine kinase domain variants occurred primarily at three hot spots (F1174, R1275, and F1245 positions), with 10% to 15% of variants occurring at other kinase domain positions.\n\nIn the COG cohort, the frequency of ALK variants was 10% in the high-risk neuroblastoma group, 8% in the intermediate-risk neuroblastoma group, and 6% in the low-risk neuroblastoma group.\n\nIn the SIOPEN high-risk population, ALK variants were divided into clonal (>20% variant allele frequency [VAF]) and subclonal (0.1%–20% VAF). Clonal ALK variants were detected in 10% of cases, and subclonal variants were found in 3.9% of patients. A total of 13.9% of the cases had an ALK variant.\n\nALK variants were found at higher rates in patients with MYCN-amplified tumors compared with those without MYCN amplification: 10.9% versus 7.2%, respectively, for the COG cohort and 14% versus 6.5%, respectively, for the SIOPEN cohort (for clonal ALK variants).\n\nFor patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, the ALK amplification was observed in approximately 4% of cases in both the COG and the SIOPEN cohorts. ALK amplification occurred almost exclusively in cases that also had MYCN amplification.\n\nALK alterations were associated with inferior prognoses for high-risk neuroblastoma patients in both the COG and the SIOPEN studies:\n\nIn the SIOPEN cohort, a statistically significant difference in OS was observed between cases with ALK amplification (ALKa) or clonal ALK variant (ALKm) versus subclonal ALKm or no ALK alterations (5-year OS rate: ALKa, 26% [95% CI, 10%–47%]; clonal ALKm, 33% [95% CI, 21%–44%]; subclonal ALKm, 48% [95% CI, 26%–67%]; and no alteration, 51% [95% CI, 46%–55%], respectively; P = .001). In a multivariate model, ALK amplification (HR, 2.38; P = .004) and clonal ALK variant (HR, 1.77; P = .001) were independent predictors of poor outcome.\n\nIn the COG high-risk neuroblastoma population, inferior prognoses, similar to those seen in the SIOPEN cohort, were observed for cases with ALK variants and ALK amplifications.\n\nIn a study that compared the genomic data of primary diagnostic neuroblastomas originating in the adrenal gland (n = 646) with that of neuroblastomas originating in the thoracic sympathetic ganglia (n = 118), 16% of thoracic tumors harbored ALK variants.[32]\n\nSmall-molecule ALK kinase inhibitors such as lorlatinib (added to conventional therapy) are being tested in patients with recurrent ALK-altered neuroblastoma (NCT03107988) and in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma with activated ALK (COG ANBL1531).[29] For more information, see the sections on Treatment of High-Risk Neuroblastoma and Treatment of Recurrent Neuroblastoma in Neuroblastoma Treatment.\n\nGenomic evolution of exonic variants\n\nThere are limited data regarding the genomic evolution of exonic variants from diagnosis to relapse for neuroblastoma. Whole-genome sequencing was applied to 23 paired diagnostic and relapsed neuroblastoma tumor samples to define somatic genetic alterations associated with relapse,[33] while a second study evaluated 16 paired diagnostic and relapsed specimens.[34] Both studies identified an increased number of variants in the relapsed samples compared with the samples at diagnosis. This has been confirmed in a study of neuroblastoma tumor samples sent for next-generation sequencing.[35]\n\nIn the first study, an increased incidence of variants in genes associated with RAS-MAPK signaling was found in tumors at relapse compared with tumors from the same patient at diagnosis; 15 of 23 relapse samples contained somatic variants in genes involved in this pathway, and each variant was consistent with pathway activation.[33]\n\nIn addition, three relapse samples showed structural alterations involving MAPK pathway genes consistent with pathway activation, so aberrations in this pathway were detected in 18 of 23 (78%) relapse samples. Aberrations were found in ALK (n = 10), NF1 (n = 2), and one each in NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, PTPN11, and FGFR1. Even with deep sequencing, 7 of the 18 alterations were not detectable in the primary tumor, highlighting the evolution of variants presumably leading to relapse and the importance of genomic evaluations of tissues obtained at relapse.\n\nIn the second study, ALK variants were not observed in either diagnostic or relapse specimens, but relapse-specific recurrent single-nucleotide variants were observed in 11 genes, including the putative CHD5 neuroblastoma tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 1p36.[34]\n\nA third retrospective variant-sequencing study used data from Foundation Medicine to compare tumor samples from patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma with tumor samples from patients with refractory and relapsed neuroblastoma. The study found a higher percentage of variants that were targetable with current drugs in the relapsed and refractory group.[35]\n\nA fourth study evaluated the frequency of ALK alterations at diagnosis and relapse. There were significantly higher rates of ALK variants at relapse than at diagnosis (17.7% at relapse vs. 10.5% at diagnosis). The rate of ALK amplifications did not differ between diagnosis and relapse.[36]\n\nGiven the widespread metastatic nature of high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma, use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) technologies may reveal additional genomic alterations not found in conventional tumor biopsies. Moreover, these approaches have demonstrated the ability to detect resistant variants in patients with neuroblastoma who were treated with ALK inhibitors.[37][Level of evidence C1] In one analysis of serial ctDNA samples from patients treated with lorlatinib, ALK variant allele frequency tracked with disease burden in most but not all patients.[38] In subsets of patients who progressed while taking lorlatinib, second compound variants in ALK or variants in other genes, including RAS pathway genes, were reported.\n\nIn a deep-sequencing study, 276 neuroblastoma samples (comprised of all stages and from patients of all ages at diagnosis) underwent very deep (33,000X) sequencing of just two amplified ALK variant hot spots, which revealed 4.8% clonal variants and an additional 5% subclonal variants. This finding suggests that subclonal ALK gene variants are common.[39] Thus, deep sequencing can reveal the presence of variants in tiny subsets of neuroblastoma tumor cells that may be able to survive during treatment and grow to constitute a relapse.\n\nGenomic alterations promoting telomere maintenance\n\nLengthening of telomeres, the tips of chromosomes, promotes cell survival. Telomeres otherwise shorten with each cell replication, eventually resulting in the cell’s inability to replicate. Patients whose tumors lack telomere maintenance mechanisms have an excellent prognosis, while patients whose tumors harbored telomere maintenance mechanisms have a substantially worse prognosis.[40] Low-risk neuroblastoma tumors, as defined by clinical/biological features, have little telomere lengthening activity. Aberrant genetic mechanisms for telomere lengthening have been identified in high-risk neuroblastoma tumors.[24,25,40,41] Thus far, the following three mechanisms, which appear to be mutually exclusive, have been described:\n\nChromosomal rearrangements involving a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal to the TERT gene, which encodes the catalytic unit of telomerase, occur in approximately 20% to 25% of high-risk neuroblastoma cases and are mutually exclusive with MYCN amplifications and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) activation.[24,25,41] The rearrangements induce transcriptional upregulation of TERT by juxtaposing the TERT coding sequence with strong enhancer elements. Children whose tumors have TERT rearrangements have a poor prognosis, which is comparable to the prognosis of children whose tumors have MYCN amplification.[41] Next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify these alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors.[42]\n\nAnother mechanism promoting TERT overexpression is MYCN amplification,[43] which is associated with approximately 40% to 50% of high-risk neuroblastoma cases.\n\nALT is an additional mechanism of telomere maintenance that is used by neuroblastoma tumors. ALT activation is present in approximately 20% to 25% of newly diagnosed high-risk cases, compared with approximately 5% to 12% of low-risk and intermediate-risk cases.[41,44,45] Compared with newly diagnosed cases, the proportion of neuroblastoma cases with ALT-positive tumors was higher in a cohort of patients who relapsed (10% vs. 48%, respectively). This finding may reflect the relatively indolent course of tumors with ALT activation after relapse, compared with the clinical course of other tumors after relapse. Over time, the proportion of patients with relapsed ALT-positive neuroblastomas (out of patients with neuroblastoma) appears larger than that of patients with another tumor type who relapsed (out of patients diagnosed with that tumor).[44] Neuroblastoma cases with ALT activation have low TERT expression and can be identified by immunohistochemistry for the ALT-associated promyelocytic nuclear body, by FISH with a telomere probe to visualize telomere ultrabright spots, and by the C-circle assay.[44,45] Approximately 55% to 60% of ALT-positive cases are characterized by deleterious ATRX variants.[26,44,45] Cases lacking ATRX variants often show low ATRX protein expression.[44]\n\nALT-positive tumors in pediatric populations rarely present before the age of 18 months and occur almost exclusively in older children (median age at diagnosis, approximately 8 years).[41,44] The proportion of neuroblastoma cases with ATRX variants increases with age into the adolescent and young adult populations.[26]\n\nThe prognosis for high-risk patients with ALT activation is as poor as that for patients with MYCN amplification for EFS;[41,44] however, OS is more favorable for patients with ALT activation. The more favorable OS appears to result from a more protracted disease course after relapse, but with long-term survival at 10 to 15 years being as low as that for other high-risk neuroblastoma patients.[41,44] In one report, EFS and OS for low-risk and intermediate-risk patients with ALT activation were similar to those observed for ALT-positive patients with high-risk disease.[44]\n\nAdditional biological factors associated with prognosis\n\nMYC and MYCN expression\n\nImmunostaining for MYC and MYCN proteins on a restricted subset of 357 undifferentiated/poorly differentiated neuroblastoma tumors demonstrated that elevated MYC/MYCN protein expression is prognostically significant.[46] Sixty-eight tumors (19%) highly expressed the MYCN protein, and 81 were MYCN amplified. Thirty-nine tumors (10.9%) expressed MYC highly and were mutually exclusive of high MYCN expression. In the MYC-expressing tumors, MYC or MYCN gene amplification was not seen. Segmental chromosomal aberrations were not examined in this study.[46]\n\nPatients with favorable-histology tumors without high MYC/MYCN expression had favorable survival (3-year EFS rate, 89.7% ± 5.5%; 3-year OS rate, 97% ± 3.2%).\n\nPatients with undifferentiated or poorly differentiated histology tumors without MYC/MYCN expression had a 3-year EFS rate of 63.1% (± 13.6%) and a 3-year OS rate of 83.5% (± 9.4%).\n\nThree-year EFS rates in patients with MYCN amplification, high MYCN expression, and high MYC expression were 48.1% (± 11.5%), 46.2% (± 12%), and 43.4% (± 23.1%), respectively. OS rates were 65.8% (± 11.1%), 63.2% (± 12.1%), and 63.5% (± 19.2%), respectively.\n\nAdditionally, when high expression of MYC and MYCN proteins underwent multivariate analysis with other prognostic factors, including MYC/MYCN gene amplification, high MYC and MYCN protein expression was independent of other prognostic markers.\n\nNeurotrophin receptor kinases\n\nExpression of neurotrophin receptor kinases and their ligands vary between high-risk and low-risk tumors. TrkA is found on low-risk tumors, and absence of its ligand NGF is postulated to lead to spontaneous tumor regression. In contrast, TrkB is found in high-risk tumors that also express its ligand, BDNF, which promotes neuroblastoma cell growth and survival.[47]\n\nReferences\n\nCohn SL, Pearson AD, London WB, et al.: The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system: an INRG Task Force report.
