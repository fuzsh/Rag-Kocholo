You prove that Awareness truly Is Power. Yes!!!!\n\nOne last question in reflecting on today's Simmons Leadership Conference #SLC45 \"What does today mean to you?\" Mark Twain was quoted in today's conference: \"The two most important days are the day you are born and the day you find out why.\" Today is neither of those days, but just one along the journey in between the two. I reflect often on life's experiences and the winding road with detours I've taken to get where I'm at now, not only in my career, but as a person. For me, today meant I am being seen for who I was made to be. After some dormant years, the leadership potential that's been part of my personality since I was young has manifested itself once again through some amazing opportunities, proper coaching and leaders of my own who have nurtured that potential. A few questions I've been contemplating from today: What is your full circle? What is it you need to come back to? 2 final gems: üíé \"Where you begin doesn't define where you end.\" üíé \"Life has a way of teaching us until we get there.\"\n\nThe 'Are DEI Agendas Dying or Already Dead?' webinar was a smash hit, with a great discussion from our panellists overflowing with forward-thinking approaches to the DEI discipline. One of the key outcomes was the need to redefine the role of the DEI leader, moving beyond the current archetypes that exist within the industry to drive progress. In this article, we summarise the current archetypes, their impact on the progress of DEI initiatives, and the new face of DEI leadership as described by our panellists. #DEILeaders #DEILeadership #DEIStrategy #DEIProfessionals https://lnkd.in/eibABBHb\n\nCalling all Black professionals!

Statistics show that organizations led by ethical leaders are 12 times more likely to outperform their competitors. Moreover, employees in ethical workplaces are 87% less likely to leave their jobs. It's clear that ethical leadership isn't just a moral imperative; it's also a strategic advantage. We've curated 4 exemplary instances of ethical leadership for you to explore and learn from ‚Äì and we invite you to contribute your insights and thoughts to this important discussion.\n\nüåü **Make Recognition Public** üåü Leaders often hesitate to acknowledge achievements in public, concerned it might spark jealousy or resentment. However, recognizing someone privately doesn't set an example, and often, the awardee misses the chance to share their story due to not wanting to seem boastful. That's why it's crucial to commend your team members and peers openly as soon as you hear of their successes. Public recognition not only boosts the individual's self-esteem but also acts as a beacon for others, showing that commendable actions are noticed and rewarded. Public acknowledgment paints the recipient as a beacon for everyone, signaling, \"Here‚Äôs someone just like you. You too can achieve greatness.\" Let's embrace public recognition to inspire others and showcase the valuable contributions within our community. Let‚Äôs celebrate our achievements together and inspire each other to reach new heights! üöÄ --- Quoting from \"The Leadership Challenge\" by Kouzes and Posner, p. 339. #Leadership #Recognition #Teamwork #Inspiration\n\nNot doing so well with accountability?
