AMERICAN (FULL GAME NOTES PDF)\n\nFRANKIES TIDBITS IN A FLASH\n\n• After a thrilling 8-0 run in the final one minute and 44 seconds capped by three free throws by sophomore Cam Gregory to earn a 62-61 win at Lehigh on Wednesday, Saint Francis heads to American on Saturday looking to earn a Patriot League road sweep for the first time in program history.\n\n• The Red Flash has swept the two games against American and Lehigh in 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2019-20, but all three of those series were in Loretto.\n\n• Saint Francis defeated American on the road in 2016-17, but lost to Lehigh and in 2021-22 the opposite happened with the Frankies downing the Mountain Hawks and then losing at American.\n\n• Saturday's game between Saint Francis and American marks the 25th meeting in the all-time series dating back to the 1972-73 season.\n\n• The Eagles have won two straight in the matchup and holds a 10-1 advantage in the nation's capital.\n\n• The only win for the Red Flash against American on the road was a 69-62 decision in 2016-17.\n\n• In the last eight meetings, the series is tied at four games apiece with the home team winning three of the four contests on its home floor.\n\n• The Saint Francis win at Lehigh on Wednesday was head coach Rob Krimmel's 150th win as a head coach.\n\n• The milestone was almost four years to the day of his 100th career win after defeating Saint Joseph's 79-68 on November 30, 2018 in Philadelphia.\n\n• Krimmel became the 181st active head coach and second this season to win his 150th career game. He is also now one of 784 head coaches all-time to post 150 wins in his career.\n\n• Taking a look at win No. 150 for Krimmel there is some classic Krimmel trends that came into play. The Red Flash made more free throws, outrebounded the Mountain Hawks and held them under 70 points. In each of those stat categories Krimmel's team have been the most successful in his 12 season, holding a 104-66 record when making more free throws, 108-46 when the team outrebounds its opponent and 95-50 when holding the opponent under 70 points in a game.\n\n• Two things that buck a classic Krimmel games was trailing at halftime and winning on the road. The team is 23-157 when trailing at the break and the team has won only 31.0 percent of its games away from DeGol Arena compared to 60.0 percent of the games played in Loretto.\n\n• American and fellow Patriot League team Lehigh have been the only non-conference opponent to appear on the Frankies schedule every season but the 2020-21 COVID-19 season since Krimmel took the helm in 2012-13.\n\n• This is Patriot League week for the Red Flash with the squad playing Lehigh and American in a four-day span this week on the road.\n\n• It will be third time the Saint Francis will play Lehigh and American in consecutive games. The trick was also turned in 2013-14 when both Patriot League teams came to Loretto and in 2011-12 the Loretto teams traveled to Lehigh and then hosted American.\n\n• Saint Francis is 28-42 against the Patriot League and 8-24 away from Loretto against the conference.\n\n• The Red Flash went 0-3 against the league last season with losses to American, Bucknell and Lehigh.\n\n• Saint Francis will play three conferences multiple times this season. The team will play the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference three times (Niagara [L, 61-69), at Iona [December 10) and host Mount St. Mary's [December 15]). The Red Flash played two teams from the West Coast Conference (San Francisco [L, 52-84]] and Santa Clara [L, 59-82]) and is in the midst of two games against the Patriot League.\n\n• The Red Flash are 27-37 all-time against teams from Washington, D.C./Fairfax, Va., and 5-28 against those teams in the nation's capital.\n\n• Krimmel will bring his team to the nation's capital area for the eighth time in his tenure as head coach.\n\n• Three Red Flash players are from the DMV area: Gregory (Accokeek, Md.), sophomore Miles Webb (Arlington, Va.) and freshman Aidan Harris (Annapolis, Md.), who had a career-high 15 rebounds against Lehigh on Wednesday. All three players will be looking for their first collegiate action closest to their home cities.\n\nAN SFU WIN WOULD\n\n• Be the first time Saint Francis has won on the road against American and Lehigh in the same season (the Red Flash has swept the two teams at home three times since 2015-16)\n\n• Be the squad's second win at Bender Arena and first since the 2016-17 season\n\n• Be the team's second-straight win on the road\n\n• Be the team's first win in the nation's capital since defeating William & Mary 78-72 in the DC Holiday Hoop Fest on December 22, 2019\n\n• Be the fourth win in five games for the Red Flash\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\n• Sophomore Cam Gregory drained three free throws with 10.1 seconds left to lift Saint Francis past Lehigh 62-61 on Wednesday. Gregory finished with nine points.\n\n• Freshman Aaron \"Ace\" Talbert fueled the Red Flash with 12 points, while fellow freshmen Bobby Rosenberger III (11 points) and Eli Wilborn (10 points) also had double figures to help head coach Rob Krimmel to his 150th career win.\n\n• Freshman Aidan Harris hauled in a career-high 15 rebounds, the second most boards in a game by a freshman in Krimmel's tenure as head coach.\n\nABOUT THE EAGLES\n\n• American comes into the contest 4-4 after falling to Harvard 80-75 on Wednesday. The Eagles are 4-0 at home and 0-4 on the road this season.\n\n• Senior Matt Rogers paced American against Harvard with 20 points and nine rebounds, while junior Elijah Stephens (14 points), freshman Matt Mayock (14 points) and senior Lorenzo Donadio (10 points) also found double figures on Wednesday.\n\n• Rogers leads the team with 14.9 points per game and sophomore Geoff Sprouse is also averaging double figures with 12.3 points per game.\n\nTRENDING UP\n\n• Freshman Aidan Harris hauled in a career-high 15 rebounds against Lehigh on Wednesday. Harris became the first player not named Keith Braxton to register 13 or more rebounds in a game as a freshman under head coach Rob Krimmel and his 15 caroms are second to only Braxton's 19 boards against Stony Brook on December 16, 2017.\n\n• In addition, Harris rebound production was the most since Mark Flagg had 17 boards against George Washington on November 9, 2021. Harris is the third player this season to register a double-figure rebound game and has two contests with at least five rebounds.\n\n• Freshman Aaron \"Ace\" Talbert has scored double figures in three of his last four games, including all three wins. Talbert is averaging 15.3 points per game in the three victories and is shooting 72.0 percent from the floor (18-for-25), 62.5 percent from both behind the arc and the free throw line (5-for-8). The freshman is averaging 13.7 points per game in his last four games.\n\n• Similar to Talbert, fellow freshman Eli Wilborn has scored double figures in three of his last four games and in all three of the Frankies wins this season. He is averaging 11.3 points and 6.7 rebounds per game in the three wins. In his five starts, Wilborn is averaging 9.0 points and 4.4 rebounds per game.\n\n• Wilborn also has nine blocks this season, which rank as the fourth-most by a freshman in the last 12 years. With one block, he would move into third place for rejections by a freshman under Krimmel.\n\n• Freshman Bobby Rosenberger III has scored double figures in his last two road games after notching a career-high 19 points and eight rebounds at Penn State on November 14 and 11 points and five rebounds at Lehigh. Rosenberger, who returned to the Lehigh Valley after hailing from nearby Quakertown, is averaging 15.0 points and 7.0 rebounds per game in his last two games away from Loretto.\n\n• Sophomore Cam Gregory, who sank the game-winning three free throws with 10.1 seconds left on Wednesday, is averaging 14.3 points per game in his last four tilts. The sophomore leads the team with four 10+ point games this season, including a team and career-best 22 points against Niagara on November 26.\n\n• Saint Francis is now 8-3 in what Assistant Coach Eric Taylor calls \"a one-point blowout\" under Krimmel. This was the first time in his 12 seasons the Red Flash has played a none point non-conference regular season game. NOTE: The team has won two Northeast Conference Tournament games by one point, but those games count as non-conference games. It was also just the third time the squad has played a one-point game on the road and the first time since Braxton's buzzer beater at Wagner in the 2016-17 postseason."
