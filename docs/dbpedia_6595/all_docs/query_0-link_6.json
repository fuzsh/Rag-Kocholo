        "text": "Sixth-year Washington Coach Bob Bender has a 3-7 record against Cal.\n\nLast Meeting: California 84, Washington 67 (Feb. 21, 1998; Oakland, Calif.) -- Geno Carlisle and Thomas Kilgore combined for 41 points and limited Washington's guards defensively as California registered an 84-67 win at the New Arena in Oakland. Washington lost its fifth consecutive road game and fell to Cal for the ninth time in the last 11 meetings. The Huskies rallied from a 10-point first-half deficit, taking a 35-34 halftime advantage on the strength of a 20-7 surge. The UW had won all 11 previous games in 1998 when leading at halftime. Todd MacCulloch led Washington with 21 points and 10 rebounds. He gave the UW its final lead at 54-53 on a layup with 9:40 left in the game. Cal responded with a 16-2 run over the next five minutes to take control. Carlisle scored 14 of his 23 points in the second half. Kilgore finished with 18 points and Sean Marks added 15. Donald Watts, named Pac-10 Player of the Week the previous week, was limited to six points after scoring 28 in the first meeting with Cal. Watts missed all nine field goal tries. The Huskies shot only 2-of-15 from 3-point range and converted only 39 percent of their field goals (22-56).\n\nPoll Patter: Washington is not listed among the Top-25 in the two major polls. The Huskies were tied for the No. 25 spot in the Dec. 14 ESPN/USA Today coaches' ratings before falling out. Washington dropped out of the Associated Press poll after being ranked No. 22 on Dec. 7. The Huskies opened the season in the No. 14 spot of both the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today polls, their first preseason ranking in 14 years. The last time a Washington team received preseason mention in the AP media poll was a No. 8 ranking on Nov. 27, 1984. This was the first time the Huskies have been recognized by the AP at any juncture of the season since Dec. 30, 1984 when they were No. 15. That Marv Harshman-coached Washington team featured Detlef Schrempf and was coming off a Sweet 16 appearance in the 1984 NCAA Tournament. Washington plays five teams in the Top-25, including two of the top three. Top-ranked Connecticut defeated the UW 69-48 on Dec. 1 at the Great Eight Classic in Chicago. Stanford, a Final Four qualifier with all five starters returning, is No. 3 in the Associated Press rankings.\n\nSnake-Bit: The last-second 88-86 loss at Arizona on Jan. 9 was the latest in a recent string of heart-breaking, buzzer-beaters against the Huskies. Washington lost two games in the final seconds last week and suffered three last-second setbacks against Top-10 teams within the past year.\n\nDate Score Location Jan. 9, 1999 #8 Arizona 88, UW 86 Tucson, Ariz. Richard Jefferson puts back missed Jason Terry 3-pointer at the buzzer\n\nJan. 3, 1999 Washington State 72, UW 71 Pullman, Wash. Jan-Michael Thomas hits deep 3-pointer with 3.3 seconds remaining\n\nMarch 19, 1998 #6 Connecticut 75, UW 74 Greensboro, N.C. (NCAA Tournament) Richard Hamilton puts back his own miss at the buzzer in East Region semifinal\n\nJan. 24, 1998 #5 Stanford 74, UW 72 Seattle, Wash. Kris Weems weaves through UW defenders in backcourt and hits trey at buzzer\n\nCourt Report: Sixth-year Coach Bob Bender has a 77-78 record at Washington. He twice evened his Washington record this season, but followed with a three-game losing streak both times and never reached the winning mark. Bender, who opened his Husky coaching career with a 15-39 mark after two seasons, has a 62-39 record over his last four seasons . . . All three of Michael Johnson's double-digit scoring games have come in UW victories, including a 12-point performance in the 70-50 win over Oregon State on Jan. 14. . . . Washington is the second straight Pac-10 team to capture the Big Island Invitational (Hilo, Hi.) championship, following Stanford which parlayed a 1997 Invitational championship into a 1998 Final Four run . . . Washington limited opponents to a combined 40.9 percent from the field in nine victories (209-511) and 47.1 percent (163-346) in its six losses . . . The Huskies limited New Mexico to 61 points, over 30 points below the 92.4-point scoring average the Lobos brought into the game. Lobo forward Lamont Long, who entered the game ranked No. 7 nationally in scoring (24.1 ppg), played 40 minutes and was held scoreless by Washington's Greg Clark.\n\nDickau - OW!: Sophomore point guard Dan Dickau had surgery Friday (Jan. 15) to repair a fracture on his left heel (calcaneus bone) that was discovered by x-rays on Jan. 13. He is out for the season. Dickau broke the navicular bone on top of his left foot during the summer that sidelined him from July to October. A bone spur that developed in that location was removed during the Jan. 15 surgery. Dickau started 11 games this year, averaging 4.6 points and a then team-high 34 assists. A seven-point performance in a last-second, 88-86 loss at No. 8 Arizona on Jan. 9 appears to be Dickau's final appearance of the 1999 season. He averaged 3.6 points per game last year and was an honorable mention All-Pac-10 freshman selection. Dickau was the 1997 Washington Class AAA prep Player of the Year out of Prairie High School in Vancouver. \"I feel bad for Dan because no one has woked harder to help this team have success,\" said Coach Bob Bender.\n\nLast Game: Washington 86, Oregon 76 OT (Jan. 16, 1999; Seattle) --Deon Luton scored 10 of his 23 points during overtime, lifting Washington to an 86-76 victory over Oregon at Edmundson Pavilion. Todd MacCulloch led the Huskies (9-6, 2-3) with 27 points and 12 rebounds, but fouled out with 52.6 second left in regulation. Oregon's Mike Carson converted one of two free throws and tied the score at 65-65 with a dunk on an inbounds play with 48.8 seconds remaining. Luton opened the overtime with a 3-pointer and assisted on the go-ahead basket, a long pass for a Senque Carey layin that put the Huskies ahead 74-73 with 1:17 left in the extra session. Luton tallied the final seven points on two dunks and three free throws. Oregon (10-5, 2-4) led by as many as nine points in the first half before the Huskies staged a 20-4 run en route to a 41-38 halftime edge. Washington led the entire second half until Carson's dunk forced overtime. Terik Brown scored 15 points to lead five Duck double-figure scorers. Alex Scales added 13 points and Carson finished with 12. Donald Watts totalled 14 points and Carey added 13 for the Huskies.\n\nInstant Replay: The Huskies swept the home series from the Oregon schools for the third straight season, posting an 86-76 overtime decision over Oregon (Jan. 16) and a 70-50 triumph against Oregon State in its Pac-10 home opener (Jan. 14) that halted a three-game losing streak. They were beaten 88-86 on a last-second shot at No. 8 Arizona (Jan. 9), lost 96-72 at Arizona State (Jan. 7) and 72-71 at Washington State (Jan. 3). Washington capped its fourth consecutive seven-win non-conference season Dec. 30 with an 81-72 win over Portland. The Huskies upset 11th-ranked New Mexico 70-61 (Dec. 24), dealing the Lobos their fist loss of the season. Washington halted a three-game losing streak on Dec. 19 with a 73-53 victory over New Mexico State. That was the first UW home game since the season-opening 70-63 win over UNC Wilmington on Nov. 16. The Huskies lost 82-71 at Gonzaga (Dec. 8) after suffering a 69-61 setback at Boise State (Dec. 5) that gave BSU a school-record 17-game home winning streak. UW lost 69-48 to top-ranked Connecticut (Dec. 1) at the Great Eight Classic in Chicago. That loss halted a four-game season-opening winning streak that culminated with a 76-60 triumph over Georgia Tech in the title game of the Big Island Invitational in Hilo, Hawai'i. Washington posted a 20-10 record last season, earning its first NCAA Tournament berth since 1986. The Huskies advanced to the Sweet 16 with wins over Xavier (69-68) and Richmond (81-66).\n\nHigh-Ranking Foes: Washington has a 57-161 record in all-time meetings with ranked opponents, including a 13-46 mark during the 1990s. The Huskies are 1-2 this season against ranked foes, falling 69-48 to No. 1 Connecticut (Dec. 1) in Chicago and and 88-86 at No. 8 Arizona (Jan. 9). They defeated No. 11 New Mexico 70-61 (Dec. 24) at Seattle's KeyArena. Washington has a 23-94 all-time record against Top-10 foes and is 3-21 during the '90s. The last UW win over a Top-10 team was a 92-88 triumph over 10th-ranked Arizona on Feb. 2, 1997 in Seattle. The Huskies lost their last 10 meetings with Top-10 teams. The last UW win over a top-three team was a 69-68 win over No. 1 UCLA on Feb. 22, 1979.\n\nThe Stanford Series:\n\nSixth-year UW Coach Bob Bender has a 2-8 record against the Cardinal whom he has never defeated at Maples Pavilion.\n\nLast Meeting: #10 Stanford 93, Washington 70 (Feb. 19, 1998; Stanford, Calif.) -- Kris Weems was the only Stanford double-figure scorer, amassing 32 points in the 10th-ranked Cardinal's 93-70 victory over Washington at Maples Pavilion. Stanford completed a sweep of the season series. Weems converted 13-of-18 field goals, including 4-of-6 shots from 3-point range. After falling behind by as many as seven points early, the Huskies rallied to take two brief one-point leads. Washington claimed its final lead at 21-20 on a 16-foot jumper by Thalo Green with 8:39 left in the first half. The Cardinal responded with eight straight points. Weems tallied 10 points inside the final eight minutes of the half, helping Stanford to a 44-33 halftime advantage. The margin grew to as many as 27 points in the second half. Washington was led by the 19 points and eight rebounds of Todd MacCulloch, an improvement from his five-point, three-rebound effort during the first meeting with the Cardinal. Deon Luton scored 17 points and Donald Watts added 14 for the Huskies. Mark Madsen, who missed the game in Seattle, had 11 rebounds to lead a 46-30 Stanford advantage. Stanford shot 48 percent for the game (32-67), including an 8-for-18 effort beyond the arc. UW hit 2-of-12 shots from 3-point range.\n\nSonics & Sons: Four former Seattle SuperSonics have sons on the 1999 Washington basketball roster. The list of former NBA players (and sons) includes, Fred Brown (Bryan), Lonnie Shelton (Marlon), Slick Watts (Donald) and Paul Westphal (Michael). A graduate of Iowa, Fred Brown is the Sonics' all-time leading scorer with 14,018 points. Brown played his entire 13-year NBA career in Seattle and was a 1976 all-star. Lonnie Shelton was a 1975 All-Pac-8 Conference selection at Oregon State. He played 15 NBA seasons and was a 1982 all-star. Shelton played from 1979-83 in Seattle. Brown and Shelton were members of Seattle's 1979 NBA Championship squad. Slick Watts led the NBA in assists (8.1) and steals (3.2) in 1976, the first player in history to top both categories during the same season. The six-year NBA veteran played in Seattle from 1974-78. Paul Westphal was a two-time (1970 & '71) All-Pac-8 pick at USC. The five-time NBA all-star played during the 1980-81 season in Seattle and returned this summer as head coach of the Sonics.\n\nShootin' Luton: Junior Deon Luton holds every Washington school 3-point shooting record. He hit three 3-pointers at Washington State (Jan. 3) to break the Husky career record of 119 treys established by Eldridge Recasner (1987-90). Luton owns Washington records for a career (128), single-season (75 in 1998) and single-game (7). He hit seven treys at USC on Jan. 29, 1998. The Huskies have a 7-2 record this season and are 28-9 during his career when Luton hits more than one 3-point basket. Luton was voted the Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 30. He was the MVP of the Big Island Invitational after scoring 41 points on 55-percent shooting (16-29), including 46-percent 3-point accuracy (6-13). Luton was a 1998 honorable mention All-Pac-10 selection. Last year he accounted for over half (75-of-147) of Washington's 3-pointers. Luton converted 5-of-7 treys in the NCAA second-round win over Richmond. He had three 3-pointers and hit a 17-foot jumper with 11 seconds remaining that proved to be the game-winning basket in the first-round against Xavier. Luton has 27 treys this season, more than double that of any other Husky (Dan Dickau is second with 11).\n\nMistaken Identity: Todd MacCulloch worked as a volunteer at the Final Four in Seattle in April of 1995 and had autograph requests from spectators who mistook him for former 7-foot Oklahoma State center Bryant \"Big Country\" Reeves. \"I'd take it as a compliment if my game is ever compared to his,\" MacCulloch remarked during the 1995 Final Four.\n\nCentury Club: Todd MacCulloch became the 10th player in Husky history to reach the 1,400-point plateau with a 22-point outing at Arizona State on Jan. 7. His 27-point outing against Oregon vaulted him ahead of the 1,449-point total of Detlef Schrempf (1982-85) and into the No. 8 spot among Washington career scorers with 1,469 points. Seventh among all-time Husky scorers is Doug Smart (1957-59) with 1,478 points.\n\nAll-Time Washington Career Scoring Leaders\n\nNo. Player (Years) Points No. Player (Years) Points 1.

He needs nine more boards to become the eighth player in Husky history to reach the 800-rebound plateau. MacCulloch currently ranks ninth among all-time Washington rebounders and will overtake the 792-rebound total of James Edwards (1974-77) with two more caroms.\n\nAll-Time Washington Career Rebounding Leaders\n\nNo. Player (Years) Rebounds No. Player (Years) Points 1.

He was twice selected to the Playboy All-America team. MacCulloch and nine other players on the 1999 All-America squad along with Utah Coach Rick Majerus are featured in the January 1999 issue of Playboy. The other members of the 1999 All-America team are: Elton Brand (Duke), Mateen Cleeves (Michigan State), Khalid El-Amin (Connecticut), Evan Eschmeyer (Northwestern), A.J. Guyton (Indiana), Richard Hamilton (Connecticut), B.J. McKie (South Carolina), Andre Miller (Utah) and Wally Szczerbiak (Miami, Ohio). MacCulloch was selected as a 1998 Playboy All-American and joined nine other players and Coach Lute Olson in Chicago during a photo shoot for the December 1997 issue. The other 1998 Playboy All-Americans were: Mike Bibby (Arizona), Zendon Hamilton (St. John's), Drew Hansen (Utah, scholar/athlete), Raef LaFrentz (Kansas), B.J. McKie (South Carolina), Paul Pierce (Kansas), Miles Simon (Arizona), Kenny Thomas (New Mexico) and Robert Traylor (Michigan). \"It's kind of scary. You don't buy that magazine to look at someone like me,\" MacCulloch exclaimed of his apperance in Playboy. Featured on the December 1997 cover was another Canuck, the 1995 Miss Canada.\n\nWatts Shortage: Senior guard Donald Watts started the last five games after missing nearly a month with a sprained right ankle suffered in the first half at Boise State on Dec. 5. He missed four games. Prior to the injury Watts made 41 consecutive starts and missed only one outing in his four-year career, playing 91 of 92 possible games. He is the Huskies' third-leading scorer (10.5 ppg), and boasts a 13.8-point scoring average in Pac-10 games. Watts contributed 14 points, six rebounds and five assists at Washington State (Jan. 3) in his return from the near month-long absence. He tallied 18 points and 10 assists at Arizona (Jan. 9) and had eight points and eight assists against Oregon State (Jan. 14). Watts usually defends the opponent's top offensive threat. Boise State's Roberto Bergersen tallied 28 of his 32 points after Watts departed with 5:41 left in the first half.\n\nDynamic Starting Debut: Two years had passed since sophomore Greg Clark started his last game, as a senior at San Diego's Grossmont High School. He was sidelined with a dislocated left shoulder his freshman season at Long Beach State before sitting out last year at Washington as a red shirt. Clark made his collegiate starting debut on Dec. 24 against No. 11 New Mexico and helped the Huskies to a 70-61 win. The 6-6 swingman displayed the offensive prowess he was known for as a prep All-American, amassing nine points, seven rebounds and four assists. It was on the defensive end that Clark was most spectacular, making three steals while shutting down leading Lobo scorer Lamont Long. One of the nation's leading scorers, Long entered the game averaging 24.1 ponts and did not score while being limited to three shots in 40 minutes. \"We have enough scorers. I want to take the role as the leading defensive player,\" Clark remarked after the New Mexico game. Clark started the last six games, averaging 5.8 points and 4.5 rebounds.\n\nFrequent Flyers: The Huskies amassed over 8,000 miles during their first road trip this season. Washington flew to Hawai'i via Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 23. Following the three-game Big Island Invitational, the Huskies endured a 4,299-mile trip to Chicago via Los Angeles. Washington departed Hilo on Sunday evening at 12:10 a.m. Central Time and arrived in the Windy City on Monday, Nov. 30 at 12:52 p.m. Central Time. The Huskies returned to Seattle on Wednesday, Dec. 2 to complete the 10-day journey. On Friday, Dec. 4 they set out on a much shorter trip, a 399-mile flight to Boise, Idaho on Dec. 5 before their visit to Spokane to play Gonzaga. The Huskies returned to Seattle on Wednesday, Dec. 9 and remain home until Jan. 2. The game on Dec. 19 was UW's first at home in 32 days, dating to the home opener on Nov. 16.\n\nStrenuous Schedule: Washington's 1999 schedule is listed as the nation's sixth toughest in the current CBS SportsLine ratings. Five 1999 Husky opponents are ranked among the top-13 in the current Associated Press poll. The 1999 UW schedule features 14 games against 1998 postseason competitors, including qualifiers from the Final Four (Stanford), Elite Eight (Arizona, UConn) and Sweet 16 (UCLA) along with NCAA teams New Mexico and Saint Louis.\n\nHigh Hopes: The Huskies return four starters and nine letterman from a team that came within one second of the Elite Eight and was ranked No. 24 in the final ESPN/USA Today poll. Returning talent represents 85-percent of the points from the 1998 team that averaged 78.7 points per game, the highest figure since 1976. The high-scoring trio of seniors Todd MacCulloch (18.6) and Donald Watts (16.9) along with junior Deon Luton (15.4) returns after combining for 50.8 points per outing last season. MacCulloch, a first-team All-Pac-10 center, led the nation in field goal shooting the last two years (67.6% in 1997, 65.0% in 1998) and is a two-time Playboy All-American. Watts and Luton were both 1998 honorable mention All-Pac-10 selections. Numerous publications have included Washington in their preseason polls, some of them projecting the Huskies as a Top-10 team.\n\nSweet Season: \"Sweet.\" How better to describe a 1998 season during which Washington returned to the NCAA Tournament after a 12-year absence, advancing to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1984? The Huskies completed the campaign with a 20-10 record, their first 20-win season since 1987. They finished fourth in the Pac-10 with an 11-7 mark. Washington garnered its first NCAA Tournament invitation since 1986 and proceeded to defeat Xavier and Richmond before a last-second loss to Connecticut. The UW improved its record during each of Coach Bob Bender's first five seasons. His inaugural team in 1994 had a 5-22 record followed by a 10-17 mark in 1995, 16-12 in 1996, 17-11 in 1997 and 20-10 last year. The improvement has been difficult due to the parellel rise of the Pacific-10 Conference which produced two of the last four NCAA champions and advanced four teams to the Sweet 16 each of the last two seasons.\n\nReturning Talent: Four starters and nine lettermen from last year's NCAA Tournament team return. Joining that group is 6-6 sophomore forward Greg Clark who red-shirted his first year at Washington after transferring from Long Beach State. Clark was one of the West's most-recruited athletes as a player at Grossmont High School in San Diego, Calif. The Huskies boast a terrific trio of 7-foot senior center Todd MacCulloch, senior guard Donald Watts and junior guard Deon Luton. A two-time Playboy All-American, MacCulloch led the nation in field goal shooting each of the last two years (67.6% in 1997, 65.0% in 1998). He was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection while Watts and Luton received honorable mention conference acclaim. Last year's team was the highest scoring Husky outfit since 1976, averaging 78.7 points per contest. MacCulloch (18.6), Watts (16.9) and Luton (15.4) combined to average 50.8 points an outing, making them the second-highest scoring trio in Husky history behind only the 1972 group of Steve Hawes (21.7), Charles Dudley (16.5) and Louie Nelson (15.1) who averaged 53.3 points. Those three all eventually played in the NBA. Sophomore forward Thalo Green sparked a late-season surge after his insertion into the starting lineup. He replaced Patrick Femerling for the final three regular-season games and the Tournament. The Huskies responded with a 5-1 record in his starts, during which Green averaged 8.7 points and 2.7 assists. Junior Chris Walcott, a 6-8 forward, also emerged at the end of last season. He scored a career-high 14 points in the critical upset of No. 18 UCLA. Sophomore guards Dan Dickau, Michael Johnson and Bryan Brown return with a year of collegiate experience under their belts. Dickau assumed the starting point guard position vacated by Jan Wooten. Junior walk-on Andrew Moritz provides depth for the guard corps.\n\nDepartures: Only three players from last year's team did not return, including starting point guard Jan Wooten who averaged 5.7 points and 2.7 assists per game in 1998. Another point guard, Chris Thompson, has used up his eligibility and will join the Husky staff as a student assistant coach. Patrick Femerling, a 7-1 center averaged 5.7 points and ranked second on the team with 6.1 rebounds per game. He decided to forego his senior season and signed in July with a team from Berling of the professional league in his native Germany.\n\nNewcomers: The Washington roster is bolstered by the addition of three scholarship freshman recruits and two invited walk-ons. The Huskies signed one player at each position, inking 6-3 guard Senque Carey and 6-5 forward Grant Leep in the early period last November and 6-9 center Marlon Shelton during June. A native of East Palo Alto, Calif., Carey prepped at St. Francis High School. He averaged nearly 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists as a senior, helping the team to a 25-8 record and a runner-up finish in the Northern California championships. He was named the 1998 regional Player of the Year and was twice voted MVP of the West Catholic Athletic League. Carey was rated 15th in the Long Beach Press Best in the West poll. Leep hails from the same Mount Vernon (Wash.) High School that produced Mark Hendrickson, a two-time All-Pac-10 performer from Washington State. Leep averaged 17.3 points as a senior and earned all-state accolades. He led his team to the state semifinals each of his final two years. Shelton is the son of former NBA and Oregon State standout Lonnie Shelton. Marlon posted 12-point, 11-rebound and 4-blocked shot per game averages as a senior at Rochester (Mich.) High School. He has an 88-inch (7-4) wingspan and will fill the backup center role vacated by Patrick Femerling. Joining the team as an invited walk-on is freshman Michael Westphal, the son of current Seattle Sonic coach and former NBA all-star Paul Westphal. Michael totalled 15 points and six rebounds per game at Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Ariz. A field of 16 Husky hopefuls (15 legitimate contenders plus local KING TV sportscaster Gaard Swanson) participated in the sixth-annual Washington walk-on tryouts on Oct. 22 at Edmundson Pavilion. Two players earned roster spots with their performances during the open tryouts, sophomore Jajuan Winesbury, a 6-7 forward from Steilacoom (Wash.) High School and freshman Travis Duty, a 6-4 guard from Seattle's O'Dea High School.\n\n1999 UW Record When\n\nAhead at Halftime 9-1 Behind at Halftime 0-5 Overtime Games 1-0 Three-Point or less Final Margin 0-2 FG % is above 50 % 2-1 FG % is exactly 50 % 1-2 FG % is below 50 % 6-2 Opponent FG % is above 50% 0-2 Opponent FG % is below 50% 9-4 Outshooting Opponent 7-3 Outshot by Opponent 2-3 Outrebounding Opponent 6-1 Rebounding equals Opponent 1-0 Outrebounded by Opponent 2-5 Less Turnovers than Opponent 7-2 Turnovers equal Opponent 0-1 More Turnovers than Opponent 2-3 Bench outscores Opponent 5-3 Bench outscored by Opponent 4-3 UW Scores 40-49 Points 0-1 UW Scores 50-59 Points 0-0 UW Scores 60-69 Points 1-1 UW Scores 70-79 Points 5-3 UW Scores 80-89 Points 3-1 Opponent Scores 40-49 Points 1-0 Opponent Scores 50-59 Points 2-0 Opponent Scores 60-69 Points 4-2 Opponent Scores 70-79 Points 2-1 Opponent Scores 80-89 Points 0-2 Opponent Scores 90-99 Points 0-1\n\nSteady Improvement: Washington's overall and Pac-10 records have improved each year under sixth-year Coach Bob Bender, capped by last season's 20-10 record, 11-7 Pac-10 ledger and NCAA Tournament appearance.

The UW improved over four straight seasons from 1941 to 1944 and from 1950 to 1953.\n\nYear Overall Pac-10 Place Year Overall Pac-10 Place 1994 5-22 3-15 9th 1997 17-11 10-8 6th 1995 10-17 6-12 7th, tie 1998 20-10 11-7 4th 1996 16-12 9-9 5th, tie 1999 9-6 2-3\n\nBender Bio: Bob Bender, who made his first NCAA Tournament appearance as head coach at Washington in 1998, has participated in the NCAA Tournament at every school with which he has been affiliated. Bender, 41, has a six-year record of 77-78 at Washington, including a 20-10 record in 1998 that marked the school's finest winning percentage since 1985. Among the 1998 Husky highlights were their first 20-win season since 1987, their first NCAA berth since 1986 and their first Sweet 16 appearance since 1984. The 1997 UW team posted a 17-11 record, capped by the Huskies' second straight National Invitation Tournament appearance. Washington's record has improved each season under Bender, including a 16-12 mark in 1996 after which he was voted the Pac-10 Coach of the Year by his peers. The UW was 5-22 in 1994 and 10-17 in 1995. His 77 victories rank fourth among all-time Washington coaches. Bender, who began his career with a four-year stint at Illinois State (1990-93), has a 10-year career record of 137-135. His Illinois State squads were 60-57, earning two Missouri Valley Conference championships, one conference tournament title and an NCAA Tournament berth in 1990. Prior to his inaugural head coaching assignment at ISU, Bender served as an assistant on Mike Krzyzewski's Duke staff (1983-89). The Blue Devils qualified for the NCAA Tournament in each of Bender's six seasons on the staff, including four trips to the Final Four. Bender is the only individual to play on two different teams in the NCAA Championship game. He was a freshman on Bobby Knight's undefeated 1976 Indiana championship team and played point guard at Duke from 1977-80, including an appearance in the 1978 title game against Kentucky.\n\nWashington Player Briefs (As of Jan. 19, 1999):\n\nBryan Brown\n\n6-3, 225, Sophomore, Mercer Island, Wash.\n\nPoints: 5/5\n\nRebounds: 2/2"
