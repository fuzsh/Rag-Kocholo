The Chants have won 13 straight games after going 1-2 on opening weekend.\n\nCCU's Bryce Shaffer (1-0) pitched the final five innings, giving up three runs on four hits while striking out six Wolverines. Chanticleer starter Oliver Ellison did not factor in the decision and pitched 4.0 innings, giving up three runs on six hits. Michigan's Mitch Voit (1-2) gave up eight runs on 10 hits with four strikeouts while giving up all four blasts.\n\nAfter giving up a two-out home run to Michigan's Jonathan Kim in the top of the first and a Will Rogers homer to left field in the top of the second, Coastal responded with its first runs of the game as Corey Zientek hit the first of four Chanticleer bombs on the day to cut into the lead at 3-2 in the bottom of the second.\n\nCoastal (14-2) held the Wolverines (5-11) scoreless after a leadoff double by Voit in the third before CCU's Blake Barthol smacked his fifth homer of the series to tie the game at 3-3 in the home frame. After a Derek Bender single, Caden Bodine stepped to the plate and drove a 1-0 pitch to right field to make the score 5-3. Graham Brown reached on a throwing error by Michigan and scored on Jake Books home run to left to put Coastal in front 7-3 at the end of three innings.\n\nOver the next three innings, the Chanticleers padded their score as Bender drove in Ty Dooley to make the score 8-3 for CCU. In the bottom of the sixth, Coastal took advantage of a pair of walks to load the bases with no outs. Sam Antonacci scored as the Wolverines turned a double play. Barthol scored on a wild pitch before the Chants loaded the bases with three straight walks and Zack Beach scored on a fourth consecutive walk.\n\nThe Wolverines wrapped up the scoring in the seventh and ninth innings as Stephen Hrustich hit a triple to score Mack Timbrook to cut the CCU lead to 11-4. Rogers singled to right field before scoring on Voit's home run to left field.\n\nCoastal Carolina will return to action on Tuesday, March 12, as the Chanticleers will take on No. 1 Wake Forest at Springs Brooks Stadium with a 6 p.m. ET scheduled first pitch. The game will be streamed on ESPN+.\n\nFor complete coverage of CCU baseball, follow the Chants on social media @CoastalBaseball (Twitter), facebook.com/CCUChanticleers (Facebook), @GoCCUsports (Instagram), or visit the official home of Coastal Carolina Athletics at www.GoCCUsports.com."
