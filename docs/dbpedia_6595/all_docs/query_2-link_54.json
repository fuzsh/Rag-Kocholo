        "text": "By Bob Bender\n\nThis Sunday, nearly two dozen scientists and naturalists as well as scores of high-school and college students will converge on a section of Van Cortlandt Park for the first-ever bioblitz in the park. Co-sponsored by Community Board 8, the Friends of Van Cortlandt Park and the Van Cortlandt Park Conservancy, the bioblitz will study animal and plant life in wetland, woods and meadows from early morning until mid-afternoon. Amazingly, this diversity of habitat is located only a five-minute walk from the No. 1 train on Broadway.\n\nIn its standard form, a bioblitz examines a small natural area over a 24-hour period to understand how nature changes during the course of a day. Because Van Cortlandt Park, like all city parks, is closed at night, a 24-hour bioblitz isn’t possible. But even during this half-day bioblitz, scientists will be able to see how plants, insects, amphibians and other life respond to changes in light and temperature from early morning to late afternoon. Equally important, the bioblitz will give hands-on nature experience to local students and show them how scientists think and work in the field.\n\nMembers of the community who are curious about the event can go on a walk conducted by the Friends of Van Cortlandt Park starting at 1 p.m. at the park-side staircase of the No. 1 train at 242nd Street.\n\nBioblitzes have been conducted in Central Park and the New York Botanical Garden and have yielded valuable information about plant and animal diversity. The Van Cortlandt Park Bioblitz offers the same opportunity to learn more about this invaluable resource in our community. For more information, contact Community Board 8 at BX08@cb.nyc.gov.\n\nBob Bender is chairman of the Parks & Recreation Committee of Bronx Community Board 8."
