        "text": "Cancer Focus:\n\nCervical Cancer, Endometrial (Uterine) Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Vaginal Cancer, Vulvar Cancer\n\nDr. Robert Wenham is a gynecologic oncologist and Chair of the Gynecologic Oncology Program at Moffitt Cancer Center. Dr. Wenham has a strong interest in research and is a principal investigator for numerous clinical trials to improve cancer care for women. His research activities include the use of novel drugs for the treatment of gynecologic cancers. He has received the Molly Cade Ovarian Cancer Research Award from the Gynecologic Cancer Foundation. Dr. Wenham enjoys the challenge of helping women with complex issues and the opportunity to offer them cutting-edge therapies, from the latest chemotherapy approaches to biologically targeted therapies, minimally invasive surgery, and clinical trials. He is also an expert in pelvic exenteration surgery, a very complex operation that offers hope of a possible cure for certain patients with gynecologic cancer. Clinically, he prefers a more collaborative approach where the patient plays an active role in decisions as he guides them through the pros and cons of their options. The future of gynecologic oncology is exciting as the rapid pace of translational research is changing the outcome and quality of life for patients. Dr. Wenham points out that life expectancy for certain womenâ€™s cancers, such as ovarian cancer, has dramatically improved over the last 30 years and continues to improve at an encouraging rate. Recently, Dr. Wenham was voted by physician peers as one of the top gynecologic oncologists (Tampa Magazine, Dec/Jan 2017). Dr. Wenham also sees patients at Moffitt Cancer Center at International Plaza.\n\nEducation & Training\n\nFellowship:\n\nDuke University Medical Center - Gynecologic Oncology\n\nResidency:\n\nHarvard, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital - Combined Program of Obstetrics and Gynecology\n\nMedical School:"
