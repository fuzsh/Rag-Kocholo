Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?\"\n\n―Leela\n\n\"I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.\"\n\n―Fry\n\n\"The Lesser of Two Evils\" is the sixth episode of Season 2 of Futurama. It originally aired in North America on February 20, 2000.\n\nOpening Sequence[]\n\nFuturama logo with subtitle, Alienese and (often), cartoon.\n\nPlot[]\n\nAt a \"Past-O-Rama\" event, Fry accidentally runs over a robot that looks exactly like Bender. His name is Flexo and he immediately gets along well with Bender. Fry, however, believes that Flexo is evil, especially noting his tendency to constantly insult him and follow it up with half-hearted \"just kidding\", making Stripperbot give him a painful lap dance at Electric Ladyland, or when he blows chlorine in his face. Later, Professor Farnsworth hires Flexo to be extra help to guard a beautiful gigantic atom of \"jumbonium\", which goes on top of the Miss Universe Pageant winner's tiara. Fry falls asleep on his watch and when he wakes up, the atom is gone and so is Flexo. Bender, Fry, and Leela search the ship but Fry mistakes Bender for Flexo because Bender uses a map, turtleneck sweater and a scarf, which hides where Flexo's goatee would have been. When they go into the pageant they are pressured by Bob Barker's Head to find the atom before it's too late Bender, Fry and Leela run into Flexo. Bender and Flexo engage in combat. Not knowing who to shoot, Leela shoots an overhead chandelier, hitting them both. The chandelier ornaments knock Bender's door open, revealing that Bender was the one who stole the jumbonium. Flexo had actually run to tell Bob Barker. However, after Gladys Lennox win the pageant, the police apprehend Flexo instead and Bob Barker, saying that he \"looks like (the thief)\", had him taken away instead of Bender.\n\nAlienese[]\n\nAt 3:45 on a sign in the subway - \"Laser Tentacle Surgery.\"\n\nAt 16:30 on one of the alien beauty contestant's sash - \"Way to go, Dexter!\"\n\nProduction[]\n\nIn the audio commentary of the show, David X. Cohen states that this episode was the only one to which he gave his artistic input. Halfway through the episode when Fry, Bender, and Flexo are at a robot strip club, a robot stripper with a strange gear oriented design can be seen. Cohen claims that he drew the robot himself. [1]\n\nContinuity[]\n\nIn this episode, Bender mistakes a telephone booth for a suicide booth while at Past-o-Rama. In \"Space Pilot 3000\", Fry mistakes a suicide booth for a telephone booth.\n\nThe Crushinator, from \"The Series Has Landed\" is seen in this episode.\n\nHermes-isms[]\n\n\"Sweet llamas of the Bahamas!\"\n\nOngoing Themes[]\n\nFry still hasn't completely fallen in love with Leela. In this episode he makes out with a \"radiator woman from the radiator planet.\"\n\nList of Futurama Episodes in Broadcast Order\n\nSeason 1 Space Pilot 3000 - The Series Has Landed - I, Roommate - Love's Labours Lost in Space - Fear of a Bot Planet - A Fishful of Dollars - My Three Suns - A Big Piece of Garbage - Hell is Other Robots Season 2 A Flight to Remember - Mars University - When Aliens Attack - Fry & the Slurm Factory - I Second That Emotion - Brannigan Begin Again - A Head in the Polls - Xmas Story - Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love? - Put Your Head on My Shoulder - Lesser of Two Evils - Raging Bender - A Bicyclops Built for Two - How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back - A Clone of My Own - The Deep South - Bender Gets Made - The Problem with Popplers - Mother's Day - Anthology of Interest I Season 3 The Honking - War is the H-Word - The Cryonic Woman - Parasites Lost - Amazon Women in the Mood - Bendless Love - The Day the Earth Stood Stupid - That's Lobstertainment! - The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz - The Luck of the Fryrish - The Cyber House Rules - Insane in the Mainframe - Bendin' in the Wind - Time Keeps on Slippin' - I Dated a Robot Season 4 Roswell that Ends Well - A Tale of Two Santas - Anthology of Interest II - Love and Rocket - Leela's Homeworld - Where the Buggalo Roam - A Pharaoh to Remember - Godfellas - Future Stock - A Leela of Her Own - The 30% Iron Chef - Where No Fan Has Gone Before Season 5 Crimes of the Hot -Jurassic Bark - The Route of All Evil - A Taste of Freedom - Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch - Less than Hero - Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles - The Why of Fry - The Sting - The Farnsworth Parabox - Three Hundred Big Boys - Spanish Fry - Bend Her - Obsoletely Fabulous - Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television - The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings Season 6 Bender's Big Score - The Beast with a Billion Backs - Bender's Game - Into the Wild Green Yonder Season 7 Rebirth - In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela - Attack of the Killer App - Proposition Infinity - The Duh-Vinci Code - Lethal Inspection - The Late Philip J.
