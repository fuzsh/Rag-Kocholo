        "text": "NORMAL, Ill. -- The future of the Illinois State-Chicago State basketball series was put on indefinite hold Wednesday following the previous night's brawl between the two's basketball teams.\n\n'We will sit on that issue for the time being and evaluate what we want to do about the relationship with Chicago State,' ISU Athletic Director Ron Wellman said. 'It won't be decided right away.'\n\nTuesday night's game at Redbird Arena was stopped by the officiating crew with a second left in the first half after the bench-clearing brawl and ISU leading 39-23. The fight resulted in 11 of Chicago State's 13 players being ejected and one from Illinois State, forcing Chicago State to forfeit the game.\n\nDespite the initial report of no one being injured, ISU Coach Bob Bender sported a swollen nose Wednesday, broken by an errant punch thrown in the melee.\n\n'I'm proud of the fact that our players showed class in a tough situation,' Bender said. 'It's no secret that I got hit. They saw it, and I'm sure it made them mad, but they didn't retaliate. I stuck my nose into something, and, with a nose the size of mine, it was the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n'I know who it was, but that's not an issue,' he added. 'It was just something that happened.'\n\nThe fight occurred after a sloppy and foul-plagued first half and a play in which ISU's Scott Taylor and Chicago State's Derrick Van dived for a rebound out of bounds at the corner of the court near ISU's bench. Players from both teams converged on the two while officials and coaches tried to stop the fighting.\n\nAccording to an NCAA rule adopted this season, any player ejected for fighting receives an immediate one-game suspension. A two-time offender is suspended for the season.\n\nThe only ISU player ejected, Antoine Hicks, will be suspended for Saturday's home game against Drake. Of the 11 Chicago State players ejected, only two reportedly face suspension for fighting, but the university was seeking clarification on the matter. The Cougars play next on Saturday at Wright State.\n\nChicago State Coach Rick Pryor blamed 'lopsided' officiating for the incident.\n\n'The bottom line was the officials,' he said. 'I apologize to Illinois State University, but I will not apologize for the officiating. '\n\nAdded Bender: 'It wasn't so much the physical play as much as it was the talking and taunting on the court. There's a growing concern about that, and we coaches have to work to control that.'\n\nGary Johnson of the NCAA Statistics Service said a game must be played to 75 percent of completion for individual and team stats to count. Thereby, the final score officially was changed Wednesday to Illinois State 2, Chicago State 0.\n\nAll of the individual and team statistics from the first half will be voided, although the game will count in the won and lost records of the two teams. The Redbirds are now 5-18 and the Cougars 3-19."
