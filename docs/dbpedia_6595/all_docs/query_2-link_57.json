        "text": "Would you know what to do if you were involved in a fender bender?\n\nEven if the damage doesn’t seem significant, you might have a time-consuming and stressful process ahead of you and it’s important to proceed carefully.\n\nIf it’s a serious wreck, call 911. Otherwise, here’s what to keep in mind in the event of a minor accident.\n\nWhat should you do at the scene?\n\nIf you accidentally bump another car (or if they bump you), here are a few steps to take:\n\nFirst, make sure everyone is okay. Then, if it’s safe, move your vehicle out of the way of traffic.\n\nEven if the damage seems minimal, call the police.\n\nExchange information with the other driver, including full name, phone number and insurance details.\n\nTake photos of the vehicles involved and document the location, road conditions, the weather and any other relevant details about the scene.\n\nWere there any eyewitnesses? Try to take their names and contact information, as well.\n\nWhen the police arrive, be direct and polite. Make sure you gather their names, badge numbers and contact details and ask about obtaining a copy of the accident report.\n\nIt’s also important to contact your insurance company, so reach out as soon as you can to let us know what happened. We’ll walk you through the next steps, start the claim process and guide you through any necessary repairs that need to be made.\n\nWhat if the other driver leaves the scene?\n\nIf the other driver doesn’t cooperate, doesn’t share their information or refuses to stop altogether, you should still stop and call the police. Try to remember as many details as you can (the color, make and model of the car, details from the scene, etc.) and share them with the police."
