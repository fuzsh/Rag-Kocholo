        "text": "Robert Wade \"Bobby\" Nash is a main character on 9-1-1 who was the captain of Station 118 of the Los Angeles Fire Department until he suddenly resigned. He debuts in the first episode of the first season of 9-1-1 and is portrayed by Peter Krause.\n\nBobby was married to Marcy Nash and they had two children, Robert Nash Jr. and Brook Nash. He was a fire captain in the St. Paul Fire Department until he relocated to Los Angeles and started working as captain of LAFD station 118 after losing his family in the devastating fire that he inadvertently caused. He is now married to Athena Grant-Nash.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nBobby grew up in Minnesota, and is the youngest child of Tim and Ann Nash. He has an older brother named Charlie, with whom he used to play lawn darts when they were kids.[4][5]\n\nHis father, also a fire captain, was an alcoholic and had anger issues which were heightened by his drinking. Despite this, Bobby idolized him, viewing him as a hero because of his profession. At a party honoring his father Tim, Bobby gifted him a scrapbook he had made featuring all the people Tim had saved. During the event, Tim allowed Bobby to take a sip of alcohol, which he immediately threw up. Bobby's mother, Ann, was furious when she found out, but Tim brushed it off, not all that concerned of the consequences. One day, after a big fight with Tim, Ann decided to leave the house, and took Bobby's brother, Charlie, with her. Bobby refused to leave with them, even after Tim slapped Charlie. One night, Bobby accidentally started a fire while trying to make cookies and there was no fire extinguisher, prompting him to call 9-1-1. Tim was furious that Bobby called 9-1-1, as he could potentially get fired due to his alcoholism, not to mention he was also skipping work. In his anger, Tim tossed the scrapbook Bobby had made for him in the trash, which made Bobby hide in his room. Tim later drunkenly tried to apologize to Bobby, taking the scrapbook out of the trash, but he tripped over himself and hit his head on a side table, which killed him. Hours later, Bobby came out of his room and found his father unconscious on the floor. To cope with his father's death, he poured himself a glass of liquor, thus beginning his own struggle with alcoholism like his father.[5]\n\nWhile in school, he took up figure skating, and with his partner, Heidi Shatsky, became Twin Cities Junior Pairs Champions three years running.[6]\n\nLosing His Family[]\n\nAfter becoming a firefighter, Bobby married Marcy Nash and they had two children, Robert Nash Jr. and Brook Nash. He and his family were happy for many years until Bobby injured his back while on duty and as a result, had to rely on pain medications, alcohol, and drugs in order to cope with the lingering pain. He became addicted to them and his addiction continued for years to come with him returning to rehab every occasion when his wife found out. His addictions were so intense that he would attend work high or drunk. He even kept a separate \"drug den\" apartment five floors below the one he had with his wife and children, where he would go to drink. On one of his trips to his apartment, he accidentally fell asleep. When he woke up, he realized how late it was and, in his rush, he forgot to turn off the space heater. As his wife had enough of him for the night, he was then kicked out of their apartment. Since he forgot to take his keys, too, he resorted to sleeping on the roof of the complex. The active space heater sparked an ember and lit the nearby blanket in his drug den alight, which then consumed the entire building due to overlooked fire hazards. By the time Bobby was alerted by the Fire Department's arrival, most of the apartment building was set ablaze and he tried to go back to his apartment for his family. The ground collapsed soon after, where he was discovered by responding firefighters and removed from the building for his safety.[3] A total of 148 people died in the fire, including his kids. His wife was severely burned and died of her injuries at hospital, though not before sharing one last happy moment with him.[1]\n\nMoving to Los Angeles[]\n\nAn investigation was launched into him, though Bobby was exonerated from any wrong doing because the fire had been a freak accident but he still felt guilty for his indirect role.\n\nAs a result of all of the deaths, Bobby fell off the deep end until he eventually returned to rehab, and this time, he managed to get his habits under control. After six months of being sober, he asked the deputy fire chief Phil Evans to take him off desk duty and put him back in the field, as he can't atone for what he has done by riding a desk. While Phil believes Bobby is ready, he doesn't think other firefighters would trust Bobby anymore. Bobby then asked to transfer somewhere else, and he relocated to Los Angeles. His indirect involvement in the apartment building's destruction was also concealed to avoid any trouble, so he could join the LAFD.\n\nWorking as the Captain of Station 118[]\n\nOn his first day as the Captain of Station 118, he met Hen and Chimney and found them placing bets with the rest of the crew on how long Bobby would last as their captain, as they've had six captains in just two years. Bobby then put his money on the odds of him outlasting one or all of them and walked away. At one of the emergency calls he responded to on his first day, Bobby met his future wife Athena when dealing with an aggressive rooster.\n\nAt the end of his first day, Bobby went to a bar and had a drink because he had a good day and didn't feel deserving of it. The next day, he went to church and gave away his AA chip to the priest because he lost his sobriety, but the priest told him to keep it and do his best to earn it back.\n\nAfter Sal Deluca disobeyed his order at a fire, Bobby confronts and eventually fires him when Sal continues to show defiance. Later on, Bobby revealed to Hen that he originally was to merely reprimand Sal for misconduct, and when Sal refused to comply with his orders, he instead suspended Sal for 6 weeks, while advising the fire chief to reassign Sal at station 122. Hen was impressed with how Bobby handled the situation and invited him out for drinks with her, Chimney, and Tommy, with the latter two also agreeing on Bobby's stance.\n\nFiguring out the fire as an act of arson with Athena, he confronted the Costas family with police at the hospital, and Victor was arrested, while Bobby himself was accused by Freddie of deception. Bobby soon confessed to the priest that he didn't want his fellow firefighters to know about his past, but taking the priest's advice to him about showing who he is to the team, Bobby started a new firehouse tradition: the team eating meals together. Bobby quickly bonded with the team and set out to be a good captain who is tough but fair.[1]\n\nFalling off the Wagon[]\n\nFollowing a harrowing plane crash rescue where many people died, and he nearly drowned trying to save a passenger, Bobby had a breakdown and went on a bender, ending his 546 days of sobriety. When he didn't show up at work the following day, Hen and Buck went to his apartment to check on him, and they found him passed out on his bed. After they got him up, Bobby promised them that it was a \"one-time thing\" and apologized. They then proceeded to tell him that it is okay to ask for help sometimes, and Bobby admitted he needed help.\n\nKeeping his past a secret from the team at first because he did not want them doubting him as their leader, Bobby decided to open up to his team after his priest advised him to trust his friends and let them in if he cared about them.[3]\n\nBlood Donation[]\n\nWhen Chimney organized a blood drive at the station, Bobby refused to donate his blood, as he was terrified of needles. He only complied after some urging from Chimney, Buck, and Hen. Later on he received a call from the hospital asking to speak with him in person. Bobby assumed something was wrong, and later at church, he showed the priest his book in which he documented the names of everyone that he had been able to save on the job. The book had 148 spaces, one for each person he \"killed\" in the fire. He said the reason for his counting is so that he can end his life once he has saved enough people to balance out the lives he accidentally took in the fire. The priest reminded him that the Church is against suicide, but Bobby felt the need to make penance for his actions, and he was afraid he may now not live long enough to balance the book.\n\nHowever, Bobby later learned that he just had a rare type of blood that has the ability to cure pregnant women and their babies of rhesus disease. He viewed this as God's punishment because he was now obligated to stay alive and donate his blood for the rest of his life to save lives, but he couldn't save his own children. Chimney convinced him that it's not a curse, but rather a blessing that he is able to save thousands of babies and helped him realize that he may not have to keep his handbook anymore, as he will save a lot more than just 148 people.[7]\n\nRelationship with Athena[]\n\nBobby decided to start dating and set up an online dating profile after his sponsor suggested him that dating would help him get back out into the world again, which the crew react with disinterest and amusement due to his mundane description. Later on, he responded at a devastating accident where motorcycle enthusiast Kenny split himself during a high-speed frenzy. Bobby was traumatized by the sight of Kenny's death and left when the police took over to compose himself. Athena, who was also on the scene, came to comfort him and Bobby asked her to go to church with him after she asked him how she could help.\n\nAfterward, they went to church together. At church, they reflected on their lives and prayed together. Later on, Bobby disposes of his handbook and attends his date with Athena. After four months of keeping their relationship a secret from everyone else, Bobby wanted to go public with their relationship, but Athena refused out of embarrassment because she was ashamed of being happy after her divorce, sparking an argument. However, after hearing Michael's positive attitude on the matter, Athena came to the firehouse to apologize to Bobby and revealed their relationship to the 118 team by kissing him.[8]\n\nAccidental Relapse[]\n\nWhen a tray of brownies laced with LSD came up to the station, the unaware crew all took some and were intoxicated. Later, while out on a call, it became apparent that everyone, except Chimney, was high off those brownies. Bobby, who stayed behind at the station, was also high and started talking about his deceased daughter to Taylor Kelly, who was there making a report of the station. By the time Athena got to the station, Bobby was on the roof, hallucinating his daughter, Brook. Bobby said he could see Brook, \"a bright light floating in the sky\", and wanted to float away with her. However, Athena managed to talk him out of his hallucination.\n\nThe incident wrecked his sobriety, and Bobby struggled with it because he went from being sober for a while, to now only a few days. He admitted to Athena that he wanted to get high again because it felt good and made him feel free from all the pain he was carrying. Athena then reminded him that she was there for him and that he should stop trying to carry it all alone. After watching unreleased interview footage, Bobby and Athena managed to corner the culprit responsible for the incident.[9]\n\nProposing to Athena[]\n\nAfter a few months of dating, Athena asked Bobby to move in, as she was ready to take the next step in their relationship. Upon being asked, Bobby was taken aback, but after taking a moment, he later proposed to her instead and she happily accepted.[4]\n\nShortly after they got engaged, Athena's parents paid a visit to their daughter and Bobby met them for the first time. Athena's mother, Beatrice, was not supportive of their plans to get married. She was agitated at Bobby when he attempted to act like a stepdad to her grandchildren, bringing up his past and telling him that Athena's children are not his \"consolation prize\", despite Bobby not having such intentions. She reluctantly apologized to Bobby after Athena told her to, and then got angry at Athena for not telling her things including being engaged to Bobby and May's suicide attempt. She continued to accuse Athena of making decisions without considering the consequences, and Bobby stepped in to defend Athena after Beatrice said that it's a miracle her two kids are alive. Before leaving, Beatrice tried to smooth things over with Athena, but still insisted that she was making a \"terrible mistake\" by marrying Bobby.[10]\n\nSuspension and Reinstatement[]\n\nFollowing the bank heist, an investigation into Bobby's past opened up and he was temporarily suspended when records revealed the Minnesota fire's association with him. While he was under investigation, Chimney became the interim captain and Bobby spent this time planning his and Athena's wedding.\n\nAfter Athena was targeted by a serial bomber, she and Bobby investigate on their own. They linked all the victims together, tracing it back to the arson case at Guillermo's Eatery. They realized that Freddie Costas, son of Victor Costas, was vengeful against whoever that helped to imprison Victor for causing his father to die in confinement. They suspected that Bobby was the next one to receive a mail bomb, but when they checked his apartment, they found nothing. Before they could warn others at the fire station, the 118 was already out on a call and a bomb toppled the ladder truck, crushing Buck's leg. When Bobby arrived on the scene, he saw that Freddie had a bomb strapped to his chest, demanding to see him. With no other choice, Bobby personally confronts Freddie and stalls until Rick Romero brings Ellie to the scene. When Freddie got distracted by Ellie, Bobby ambushes him from behind and takes the detonator, allowing the SWAT to move in and disarm the threat. The rest of 118 and bystanders then proceeded to rescue Buck. The LAFD later reinstated Bobby out of public pressure due to his heroism. After things calmed down, Bobby and Athena decided to elope, and they got married at the courthouse with May and Harry present.\n\nBeing Sued by Buck[]\n\nAfter Buck passed his LAFD recertification test, a surprise party was thrown for him at Bobby and Athena's house to celebrate him going back to work. While thanking Bobby for being there for him during his recovery, Buck started coughing up blood due to blood clots and passed out in the middle of the party. Bobby later visited Buck at the hospital and told him that he was no longer cleared to be back at work due to the blood thinners he was now on. Bobby added that the department was concerned about liability issues and that the fire chief may clear Buck for light duty in a few weeks, but Buck got upset and told Bobby he quit because he didn't want to do only light duty.[11]\n\nAfter the tsunami, Buck changed his mind and embraced having light duty as a fire marshal. Bobby said he was proud of him for not giving up when things got hard. However, things took a turn for the worse when Buck learned that he had been temporarily replaced by Lena Bosko, and that Bobby was the one who told the higher-ups in the department that he wasn't ready to come back to work. Feeling hurt, Buck decided to sue the city, the fire department, and Bobby for wrongful termination. The lawsuit affected the relationship between them as Bobby felt betrayed by Buck's lawyer using extremely personal information about each team member to throw them under the bus during an arbitration hearing. Bobby later informed Buck that he was being reinstated to active duty by the chief since the fire department was afraid of the bad press and wanted to settle the lawsuit. Buck was thrilled to hear the news, but Bobby added that he might regret it. Still mad at Buck, Bobby put Buck on light duty and didn't allow to attend calls on his first shift back. However, after finding Buck in the ER due to him saving someone while off duty, Bobby saw that Buck was ready for the job again. Before they left the hospital, Buck offered to buy Bobby breakfast and they reconciled.[12]\n\nRadiation Exposure[]\n\nOne day, Bobby and his team were called to a scene where two trucks had collided in a tunnel and were on fire. The blaze turned out to be a magnesium fire, and one of the trucks was carrying cobalt-60. Bobby stayed behind to assist the driver and contain the fire while waiting for a liquid nitrogen truck from dispatch. As the fire gradually reached the cobalt, it started emitting gamma radiation. Due to his prolonged exposure to radioactive elements, Bobby was decontaminated in a chemical tent and then taken to the hospital. There, the doctor informed Bobby and Athena that the tests were mostly good, showing only trace amounts of cobalt in his urine. Though the doctor reassured them about Bobby's health, he recommended a series of tests once a week for the next six weeks to monitor his condition. After six weeks, Bobby got the results back saying he was in the clear.[13][14]\n\nAthena's Attack[]\n\nWhen Athena was attacked by Jeffery Hudson in a storage facility, dispatch alerted all police and fire units about an officer in distress. The 118 rushed to the scene, and on the way, Bobby heard Athena's struggles over the radio. At one point, a gunshot went off, leading him to fear for her life. Upon arriving, Bobby grabbed an axe and entered the facility. Inside, he found Athena badly injured and accompanied her to the hospital.[15]\n\nThe trauma from the attack created communication problems in their marriage, with Athena withdrawing and making decisions on her own due to her PTSD and both of them avoiding to talk about the attack entirely. The tension peaked when Athena discovered that Bobby had been helping and sponsoring someone without informing her. They had a heated argument, which was interrupted when Hen called Bobby to inform him that Eddie had been shot by a sniper.[16]\n\nLater that night, Bobby and Athena finally sat down for a serious conversation about how the attack had affected them both and apologized to each other. During their conversation, Bobby opened up about how it felt to nearly lose her, while Athena explained why she chose not to retire after the attack even though she was given the opportunity to. Athena said they are both survivors and they reconciled.[17]\n\nGetting Shot[]\n\nThe following day, Bobby and the 118 responded to a fire in a burning building caused by the sniper, who was targeting the members of LAFD. During the incident, Bobby was shot by the sniper. When Athena arrived at the scene and learned that Bobby was trapped inside with the sniper, she became deeply concerned for her husband. She enlisted Buck's help to get into the building to rescue Bobby. With the assistance of the 118, Athena suited up in firefighter gear and entered the burning building. She then confronted and shot the sniper, allowing Bobby to be safely taken to the hospital, where he recovered.[17]\n\nHarry's Kidnapping[]\n\nAfter Harry was kidnapped by Jeffery Hudson, Bobby helped Athena find her son amidst a citywide blackout triggered by a ransomware attack. With the help of 118, Athena chased Jeffrey down at a metro station, where she ultimately shot him multiple times in the chest after he pointed his gun at Bobby. With May's help, Athena and the team figured out where Jeffery hid Harry.[18]\n\nThe aftermath of the kidnapping left Athena deeply frustrated, as Harry blamed her for his ordeal. Still reeling from Harry's kidnapping, one day, Athena came home and scrubbed down every inch of the house as she didn't want any reminder of the guy who broke in and took her son. While confiding in Bobby about her unease, Athena broke down, and Bobby did his best to comfort her during such a challenging time.[19]\n\nSaving May from the Call Center Fire[]\n\nWhen a fire broke out at the call center, the 118 was one of the fire companies to respond to the emergency. Upon discovering that May was still trapped inside, Bobby immediately rushed into the burning building to rescue her. Bobby later reached the room where May and Claudette were trapped and managed to save them. However, as they were making their way out, the ceiling collapsed on them, and Bobby shielded May with his body, protecting her from the falling debris. After learning that their captain was trapped, the rest of the 118 crew rushed in to free him and May from the rubble, and they both made it out with minor injuries. Outside, May told an EMT that she wanted to ride to the hospital with her dad. Bobby told her that she didn't have to lie, but May insisted that she has two dads, and Bobby is one of them. Later, at the hospital, Bobby, being a stubborn patient, insisted he was fine and refused to get an MRI. However, after May expressed her concerns about his well-being, he agreed to the scan.[20]\n\nNear Relapse[]\n\nFollowing Claudette's sudden death after the call center fire, suspicions around Jonah grew. Together with Chimney, Hen began to investigate Jonah's past and uncovered that Claudette's death was indeed an act of sabotage by Jonah. They informed Bobby and Athena about their findings, which revealed Jonah's childhood heroics and a pattern of mysterious patient deaths on his watch. After Jonah discovered Hen had reported him, he kidnapped both her and Chimney and took them to a location. Noticing Hen and Chimney's absence, Maddie and Karen alerted emergency services and Athena and Bobby later arrived at the scene. Consumed with anger, Bobby punched Jonah again and again before Athena and the officers stopped him.[21]\n\nBobby felt a deep sense of responsibility and blamed himself for Jonah's actions, believing that his decision to bring Jonah onto the team had led to the tragic events. Struggling with his guilt, Bobby bought a bottle of scotch, teetering on the brink of relapse. Sensing Bobby's distress, Eddie came over to Bobby's house to talk to him. During their conversation, Eddie reassured Bobby that Jonah's actions were not his fault and that everyone missed the signs. He also reminded Bobby that he was still a good man. After Eddie left, Bobby poured the liquor down the sink, stopping himself from relapsing. Deciding not to dwell on the past anymore, Bobby bought cruise tickets for their belated honeymoon and surprised Athena with them at Hen and Karen's vow renewal ceremony.[22]\n\nSupporting Athena in Florida[]\n\nAfter finding out that Samuel had a stroke while they were FaceTiming with Athena's parents before leaving for their honeymoon, Bobby and Athena postponed their trip to go to Florida instead. When they arrived, they learned that Samuel was put in a medically induced coma after suffering from a stroke. To repair the Florida room that Samuel had crashed into with his car, Athena hired Junior, an old family friend who was a handyman. Overhearing Bobby and Athena consulting with Junior about renovating the house, Beatrice became upset, accusing Athena of planning changes and talking about Samuel as if he were already dead. Athena tried to explain to her mother that she just wanted to improve her father's quality of life, but Beatrice accused her again of trying to sell the house. Bobby then defended Athena, telling Beatrice to cool off. Bobby later apologized for it to Beatrice, but Beatrice told him never to apologize for standing up for her daughter.[23]\n\nThe next day, the police discovered a body under the house, identified as Tanya Kingston's, making Samuel a suspect. Fearing her father might be guilty, Athena was hesitant to uncover the truth at first, but Bobby was able to encourage her to discover the truth for herself. Bobby helped Athena with the investigation and they started at Tanya's house, but Tanya's sister, Joanne, confronted them with a gun, accusing Athena of being the daughter of a murderer. After Bobby disarmed her, Joanne took them to her and Tanya's old bedroom and revealed the details of the night her sister disappeared. The police later arrived, having been called by Joanne earlier due to Athena and Bobby trespassing. Joanne told the police she decided not to press charges, but Athena was arrested for interfering with an active investigation. After Athena's arrest, Bobby spoke with Joanne and continued to pursue leads. Bobby soon realized that Junior might be the real culprit and decided to warn Joanne. By then, Junior had already abducted Joanne and taken her to an orange grove, where he was about to shoot Joanne to tie up loose ends, but Bobby appeared and tackled him. While they were struggling, Joanne grabbed the gun and fired, but missed, allowing Junior to escape. Athena arrived at the scene shortly after and checked on Bobby, who told her to get Junior who fled. She eventually caught up to him and cuffed him. After handing Junior over to the detective, Bobby checked on Athena, who reassured him that she was okay now. After Samuel woke from his coma, Bobby returned to Los Angeles, while Athena stayed behind for a while to arrange care for her parents before leaving.[24]\n\n[]\n\nOne day, Bobby received a visit from his AA sponsor, Wendall, who was checking in to see how Bobby was doing during the fire season. Bobby assured him that he was doing fine and the two talked about how Bobby was almost five years sober now. Wendall informed Bobby that he was planning to visit his son's family in New Mexico and would be gone for a couple of weeks, and asked Bobby to fill in for him while he was away. Athena came home while they were talking and Wendall said he was glad he got to say goodbye to her before he left. Bobby sensed something was off with Wendall and asked if he was all right. However, Wendall just played it off and blamed the Santa Ana winds.\n\nLater that night, Bobby received an unsettling voicemail from Wendall. In the message, Wendall sounded high and mentioned that he had tried to be a good man but was feeling very tired. Concerned, Bobby tried calling him back, but it went straight to voicemail. The following morning, the 118 responded to a fire near a residential area. After the fire was extinguished, Eddie and Bobby discovered charred remains of a body. Bobby told Eddie he needed a moment when he recognized Wendall's watch on the remains. He also noticed a syringe near the body.[25]\n\nBobby later discovered that Wendall had lied about visiting his family and that he hadn't spoken to them in weeks. Athena informed Bobby that the area where Wendall was found was known for drug use and was near a rehab facility where Wendall had recently spent time before his death. Suspicious of the circumstances surrounding Wendall's death, Bobby decided to investigate further. To help him, Athena and May went undercover at the facility to investigate. They discovered that the facility allowed clients to continue using drugs, believing in controlled use and weaning users off rather than a cold turkey approach. This approach had led to overdoses and suspicious deaths.[26]\n\nBobby met with Tamara, a worker at the facility who knew Wendall, hoping she would open up about him. However, Tamara told Bobby to drop the investigation. One night, Tamara, sounding high, called Bobby to confess that Wendall died at the facility and was moved elsewhere after his death. Fearing for Tamara's safety, Bobby rushed to the rehab facility. Trey and Carrie Walsh, the owners of the facility, tried to keep Bobby out, but he punched Trey and forced his way in, searching for Tamara. Bobby later found Tamara in an office with a needle beside her. As he tried to help her out, the smoke alarm went off, and the building caught fire. Trey and Carrie attempted to frame Bobby for the fire by planting evidence in his truck and bringing up the Minnesota fire. Bobby was then brought in and interrogated until Athena became involved and corroborated Bobby's story. After Tamara admitted to everything that happened, the owners were arrested. To honor Wendall's 10th anniversary of sobriety, Bobby spoke at the AA meeting, celebrating Wendall and acknowledging how Wendall saved his life.[27]\n\nCruise Ship Accident[]\n\nMeeting Amir and Making Amends[]\n\nBobby informally met Amir Casey when he was returning a baby to its mother at the hospital. He encountered Amir again at one of his AA meetings, where Amir stood up and shared that he shouldn't be here after an apartment fire in Minnesota ten years ago should have killed him. Upon hearing Amir's story as a victim of the apartment fire, Bobby was left stunned and later that night, Bobby opened up to Athena about Amir and his need to make amends to him.\n\nQuitting His Job[]\n\nHouse Fire and Heart Attack[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nAfter losing his family, Bobby became closed off and withdrawn, but, over time, he bonded with his team and became more open and warmer. Bobby is shown as caring, decisive, calm, and levelheaded. He is usually quiet and keeps to himself, although in front of his friends and family, he is shown to be witty and a good sport. Despite his more introverted personality, he is seen as a fatherly figure within the firehouse and most of his crew have all come to him for advice at some point.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nMarcy Nash[]\n\nMain article: Bobby-Marcy (relationship)\n\nBobby and Marcy were married until her death. They lived in St. Paul, Minnesota, and had two children together. In 2014, Marcy and both their children died in a fire, which devastated Bobby. After losing his family, Bobby blamed himself for what happened the night of the fire and went on a bender. Eventually, he returned to rehab, and subsequently moved to Los Angeles to start over.\n\nAthena Grant-Nash[]\n\nMain article: Bobby-Athena (relationship)\n\nBobby first met Athena at one of the first emergency calls he responded to as captain of the 118 after moving to Los Angeles. At the call, he handed Athena a rooster named Maurice after she asked for the assailant who stabbed the victim. They met again when the 118 responded to a fire caused at a restaurant, and would later revisit the crime scene on separate occasions, teaming up to uncover its true cause as arson.[1]\n\nHaving to work together often because of their professions causing them to meet frequently at cases, they got acquainted and through Hen, they all became friends. However, they were not romantically involved until Athena decided to divorce Michael due his outing causing family drama and Bobby jumps into the dating game. Bobby initially asked Athena to go to church with him when Athena asked him what she could do to help him through the day after they both had just witnessed a severe motorcycle accident. They went to church together afterward and eventually went out on a date.[28]\n\nAfter four months of keeping their relationship a secret, Bobby wanted to go public with their relationship but Athena refused because she didn't want to be embarrassed if their relationship didn't work out. That caused a rift between them but after talking with Michael, Athena came to the firehouse to apologize to Bobby and revealed their relationship to the other members of the 118 by kissing him in front of them.[8]\n\nThe two continued dating and after some time, Athena asked Bobby to move in as an attempt to take the next step in their relationship. That took Bobby by surprise, and Athena thought that she scared him off. After taking a moment, Bobby came back to Athena on Christmas Eve and instead of agreeing to move in with her, he proposed to her; saying that he didn't want to take the next step but wanted to take every step with her for the rest of their lives. Athena happily accepted his proposal and they became engaged.[4]\n\nThey started to plan their wedding after Bobby got temporarily suspended from his duties at the 118 but after the events of the serial bomber, he realized, owning to their dangerous professions, they have no time to spare. They then went to a courthouse with May and Harry and got married.[29]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBoth Bobby and his actor Peter Krause are from Minnesota.\n\nBobby has physically appeared in every episode in the series so far except for \"Hen Begins\" and \"Chimney Begins\", where he was only shown in flashbacks.
