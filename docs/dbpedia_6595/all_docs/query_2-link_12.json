        "text": "Chagrined by his losing performance in the Mid-American Conference tournament final, Miami of Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak came into the Midwest Regional looking to get the sour taste out of his mouth. He did so by keeping the basketball in his own hands.\n\nThe senior forward from Long Island scored a career-high 43 points in the Red Hawks' 59-58 victory over Washington today in the Superdome.\n\nTenth-seeded Miami now faces No. 2 Utah on Sunday in a second-round game. The Utes (28-4) steamrolled Arkansas State, 80-53, for their 23d consecutive victory.\n\nSzczerbiak, who played with a dislocated kneecap during the conference final, may now be fighting arm soreness. He launched 33 of Miami's 55 shots, making 18 of them. He had 12 rebounds to lead both teams. He played all but 33 seconds in the game. He hit the game-winning shot. And he blocked what could have been the Huskies' game-winner in the final seconds.\n\nBut perhaps as surprising as Szczerbiak's dominance was how little special attention the seventh-seeded Huskies gave him throughout the game.\n\n''In the M.A.C., guys are always hedging on screens, chasing me up and down the floor and bodying me up,'' he said. ''I was more open than I've ever been today.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
