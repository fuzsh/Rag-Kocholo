Route is a loop swimming down- and then up-river, so the hardest part is at the end and can be challenging depending on flow rate. Water quality is as expected for a suburban river. Nice picnic after with burgers and beers. Perhaps the only downside is it's a bit of a schlep to the restrooms from the start/finish line.\""
