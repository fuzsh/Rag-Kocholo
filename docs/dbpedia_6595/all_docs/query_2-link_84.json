        "text": "EDITOR NOTE: AllSportsTucson.com is running a feature this basketball season highlighting what happened 25 years ago on that particular day commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Arizona Wildcats’ national championship. The next in the series is what occurred and what was written concerning the developments of March 2, 1997, when Arizona beat Washington 103-82 at McKale Center. The information gathered is through articles written by beat reporters Steve Rivera (Tucson Citizen) and Javier Morales (Arizona Daily Star), who now are writing for AllSportsTucson.com.\n\nYou can access previous stories in this series by clicking on this link.\n\nDATELINE: March 2, 1997, McKale Center\n\nMichael Dickerson stared at the stat sheet with a perplexed look tonight, similar to the appearance of whoever tried to guard him for Washington.\n\n“They have me down for only seven rebounds?” he said. “Man, I thought I had more than that.”\n\nThat is how far he has come, and obviously it has a positive impact on his teammates, who in their three-game winning streak have mirrored his determination.\n\nUntil recently, he would have been happy just to score 27 points, like he did in No. 15 Arizona’s 103-82 win over Washington in front of 14,421 fans in the season finale at McKale Center.\n\nAgain playing in sync with Miles Simon, Dickerson was all over the place, grabbing four offensive boards, running down loose balls and occasionally defending the Huskies’ point guard.\n\n“In the last couple of games, Michael has flat-out played like I’ve never seen him before,” Arizona assistant coach Jim Rosborough said. “He’s showing so much confidence, and it’s happening at the right time.”\n\nIf Dickerson and the Wildcats crash the boards at Stanford and Cal next week like they did tonight, the UA could end up on a nice upward trend coach Lute Olson has talked about.\n\nDickerson spearheaded an effort in which the Wildcats grabbed a season-high 28 offensive boards. Simon, who had 20 points, corralled three offensive boards.\n\n“The offensive rebounds by Miles and Michael is such a critical number for us,” Olson said. “It has not been a strength of theirs, but it has to be. They both have made good progress with their mindset of getting to the boards.”\n\nDickerson said his recent surge — 29 points at Oregon State, 32 points against Washington State and 27 tonight — is related to encouraging words his father, Willie, said last week.\n\nHis dad attended the UA’s games in Oregon and he saw his son struggling with his confidence against the Ducks on Feb. 20. Dickerson scored only 10 points on 3-for-8 shooting from the field and grabbed only one rebound in the Wildcats’ loss.\n\n“My dad kept telling me to step it up, not only for this year, but also going into next year,” said Dickerson, a Seattle native who scored 50 points in the two games against the Huskies this year. “I feel like in the last couple of games I have taken my game to a different level and it’s because of the confidence my dad gave me.”\n\n— Javier Morales\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe NCAA Tournament is still two weeks away, but already Arizona is getting into March Madness.\n\nOne game and two days into the season’s final month, Arizona rolled out the red carpet for the Washington Huskies and then rolled them over, 103-82, at McKale Center in this season’s home finale tonight.\n\nWith one weekend trip to the Bay area left, everyone seems to be pointing to the tournament.\n\n”They can be tough,” Washington coach Bob Bender said of Arizona in the tourney. ”With the quickness and the athleticism they attack you with, they can put put some people out.”\n\nArizona’s magic might have started tonight. UW’s lopsided loss might keep it out of the tourney when teams are picked Sunday.\n\nThe Wildcats put on a basketball clinic and showed the Huskies what it takes to get to the tournament.\n\nMike Bibby showed how to shoot with precision. Jason Terry showed how to pass. Michael Dickerson showed them everything. Then Arizona showed them the door in a pleasing-to-the-eye victory.\n\nWhen you look at Arizona’s box score and note the players in double digits, you’ll see there was a party of five – five Arizona players who had some sort of double, either points or assists.\n\n• Dickerson, on top of his game again, hit for 27 points.\n\n• A.J. Bramlett had 11 points.\n\n• Bibby and Miles Simon hit for 20 points each.\n\n• And Terry added a career-high 11 assists.\n\nThe team had a season-high 30 assists and 28 offensive rebounds.\n\nThe numbers capped a terrific week from the Wildcats as they scored more than 100 points in each game. UA beat Washington State, 101-77, in the previous game.\n\n”It just wasn’t a weekend thing,” Arizona assistant Jessie Evans said of the team’s good play. ”We wanted to start to pick up the level of our play. We told the players that the next one is always important.\n\n”Nothing will mean anything unless you win the next one. It’s a buildup, and what we’re doing is treating it like a tournament, because every team we play is trying to get into the tournament. We have to rise to the occasion.”\n\n— Steve Rivera\n\nArizona Wildcats 1996-97 Men's Basketball Schedule\n\nDateRankOpponentResultSite 11/22/96197 North Carolina\n\nHall of Fame Tipoff ClassicW 83–72Springfield (MA) 11/26/9611Northern ArizonaW 88–70McKale Center 11/30/961119 New MexicoL 84-77Albuquerque (NM) 12/7/96153 Utah\n\nJohn Wooden ClassicW 69–61Anaheim (CA) 12/9/961513 TexasW 83–78McKale Center 12/14/968Jackson StateW 111–83McKale Center 12/21/9664 MichiganL 73-71 OTAuburn Hills (MI) 12/28/969Robert Morris\n\nFiesta Bowl ClassicW 118–54McKale Center 12/30/969Penn\n\nFiesta Bowl ClassicW 93–51McKale Center 1/2/979CaliforniaW 81-80McKale Center 1/4/97921 StanfordW 76-75McKale Center 1/11/977Arizona StateW 92-84Tempe 1/16/976USCL 75-62Los Angeles 1/18/976UCLAL 84-78 OTLos Angeles 1/23/9711Oregon StateW 99-48McKale Center 1/25/9711OregonW 88-66McKale Center 1/30/9710Washington StateW 87-78Pullman (WA) 2/2/9710Washington L 92-88Seattle 2/5/9714Arizona StateW 87-71McKale Center 2/9/971421 Tulane\n\n7Up ShootoutW 81-62Phoenix 2/13/971124 UCLAL 66-64McKale Center 2/15/9711USCW 101-77McKale Center 2/20/9713OregonL 78-72Eugene (OR) 2/22/9713Oregon StateW 74-64Corvallis (OR) 2/27/9715Washington StateW 100-86McKale Center 3/2/9715WashingtonW 103-82McKale Center 3/6/971223 Stanford L 81-80Palo Alto (CA) 3/8/9712CaliforniaL 79-77San Francisco 3/13/97413 South Alabama\n\nNCAAT 1st RoundW 65-57Memphis 3/15/97412 College of Charleston\n\nNCAAT 2nd RoundW 73-69Memphis 3/21/9741 Kansas\n\nSweet SixteenW 85-82Birmingham (AL) 3/23/97410 Providence\n\nElite Eight W 96-92 OTBirmingham (AL) 3/29/9741 North Carolina\n\nFinal FourW 66-58Indianapolis 3/31/9741 Kentucky\n\nChampionshipW 84-79 OTIndianapolis\n\nFOLLOW @JAVIERJMORALES ON TWITTER!"
