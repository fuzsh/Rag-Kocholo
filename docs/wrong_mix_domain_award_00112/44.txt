Thus Spoke Bohr :

Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.

Your theory is crazy, but it’s not crazy enough to be true.

Einstein, stop telling God what to do!

It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we say about Nature.

An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made, in a narrow field.

We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct. My own feeling is that it is not crazy enough.

A physicist is just an atom’s way of looking at itself.

If quantum mechanics hasn’t profoundly shocked you, you haven’t understood it yet.

How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.

Never express yourself more clearly than you are able to think

Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.

Every great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution. It forces us to change our thinking in order to find it.

There are trivial truths and the great truths. The opposite of a trivial truth is plainly false. The opposite of a great truth is also true

When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.
