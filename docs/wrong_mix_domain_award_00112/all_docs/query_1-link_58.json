Learn about his fascinating life, and some of the science he created.\n\nNiels Bohr was one of the world’s greatest scientists when WWII began, but he had so much work yet to do. He had already created the standard model for atomic structure and won the Nobel Prize for it, sure, but then he worked to help scientists flee Hitler’s shadow. He worked in the resistance in Denmark. He dramatically fled arrest from the Nazis in September 1943 and negotiated asylum for Jewish refugees in Sweden when he arrived. Then, he spent the rest of the war years advising scientists in the Manhattan Project. Learn about his fascinating life, and some of the science he created. Targeted for grades 5–9."
