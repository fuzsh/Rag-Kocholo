        "text": "Important Facts\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr was a Danish physicist ​\n\nHe was the first to apply the quantum concept, which restricts the energy of a system to certain discrete values, to the problem of atomic and molecular structure.\n\nBohr's greatest contribution to modern physics was the atomic model. The Bohr model shows the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons.\n\nBest known for his substantial contributions to quantum theory and his Nobel Prize-winning research on the structure of atoms\n\nBohr was the first to discover that electrons travel in separate orbits around the nucleus and that the number of electrons in the outer orbit determines the properties of an element.\n\nAlready in his 1913 trilogy, Bohr had sought to apply his theory to the understanding of the periodic table of elements.\n\nLiquid droplet theory\n\n​According to his liquid droplet theory, a liquid drop provides an accurate representation of an atom's nucleus.​\n\nQuantum theory\n\nBohr's concept of complementarity, which he wrote about in a number of essays between 1933 and 1962, states that an electron can be viewed in two ways, either as a particle or as a wave, but never both at the same time.\n\n​​\n\n​created by Krupa Parmar"
