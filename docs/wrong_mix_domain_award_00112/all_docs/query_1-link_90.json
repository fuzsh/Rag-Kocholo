Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to quantum mechanics and atomic structure. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 for investigating the structure of atoms and the radiation they emit. Bohr mentored many of the top physicists of the 20th century at his institute in Copenhagen. During World War II, he escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden and later worked on the Manhattan Project in the United States, advocating for open international collaboration on nuclear weapons.",
