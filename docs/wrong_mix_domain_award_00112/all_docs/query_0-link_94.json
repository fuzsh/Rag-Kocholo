        "text": "Intro text\n\nThis memorial website was created in the memory of our beloved Neils Bohr who was born in Copenhagen, Denmark on 7th October 1885 and passed away on 18th November 1962, 77 years of age. As one of the most influential Scientists of his time, this website is a fraction of the rememberence that he deserves. Studying under another influential scientist, J.J. Thompson, who discouraged and disagreed with his work, it says a lot for Neil's dedication. He continued to pursue his ideas and working with Ernest Rutherford, Bohr's ideas were expanded and they together created a new theory on the structure of an atom in 1903.Bohr's atomic diagram held that the outer electron levels hold more electrons than inner electron levels, that atoms traveling from one orbit to another release tiny amounts of radiation. This theory was the basis for many other aspiring scientist work and eventually became the basis for the science of quantum mechanics.For his contribution to science, he was awarded with a plethora of awards such as the prestiges Nobel prize for physics, Hughes Medal, Matteucci medal,the Copley medal, and many others. He also wrote to books now published. Neils Henrick David Bohr can never be forgotten, and will always be revered in science as one of the most important and influential physicists of all time."
