        "text": "Please email or share this article!\n\nNiels Bohr Facts & Biography\n\nEarly Life\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1885.\n\nHe was the middle child of a University of Copenhagen physiology professor, but he knew that he wanted to be a physicist (scientist who studies physics) early on in his life.\n\nHe worked very hard in school as a child so that he could go to the same university as his father. He knew that he would have to do very well to understand physics if he wanted to do his own research.\n\nHe followed in his father’s footsteps and became a University of Copenhagen student at age 18, and earned a PhD in physics 8 years later.\n\nHis research focus during this time was the electron theory, which states that all matter is comprised of molecules, which in turn consist of protons, neutrons and electrons.\n\nRelated: Molecule Quiz\n\nScientific Discovery: The Atomic Model\n\nAfter earning his doctoral degree, Bohr continued his research at the University of Manchester, studying under Ernest Rutherford.\n\nThere, he focused on quantum physics, a new type of small particle physics at the time.\n\nThey showed that tiny particles called electrons were negative and orbited around the center of the atom.\n\nBohr contributed to this research by writing journal articles for The Philosophical magazine and explaining that electrons specifically orbit in preset patterns.\n\nAdditionally, he described how the orbiting electrons might release energy when they drop down to a lower orbit, and called this energy electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThis later became known as the Bohr Atomic Model.\n\nAfter becoming a professor of physics at Copenhagen, he established the Institute for Theoretical Physics, which opened in 1921.\n\nFor the next phase of his research, Bohr wanted to study the electron theory as it related to the periodic table of elements.\n\nUsing his atomic model, Bohr added electrons to the periodic table. This work helped show that his model was accurate, and it was used in the process of discovering a new element, called Hafnium.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Bohr Atomic Model earned Niels Bohr the 1922 Nobel Prize.\n\nScientific Discovery: Quantum Mechanics\n\nShortly after, scientists were able to bring Bohr’s research on electron theory and the new atomic model to their research in a new field of physics called quantum mechanics.\n\nWerner Heisenberg became Bohr’s assistant at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nHeisenberg and Bohr studied the Complementarity Principle, which is the idea that atoms must be studied both as small particles and as waves of energy.\n\nHowever, Albert Einstein did not agree with this idea, and they debated their views at conferences in the late 1920s.\n\nScientific Discovery: Nuclear Physics\n\nAfter the atomic model was applied to the upcoming research in quantum mechanics, many scientists in the field of physics shifted their research to the nucleus of the atom.\n\nBohr started working with a cyclotron, which accelerates atomic particles so they can be studied.\n\nIn 1938, German scientists discovered that neutrons could be used to split uranium atoms in half. Other scientists reasoned that this could be due to Bohr’s compound nucleus theory.\n\nThe next year, Bohr began working in the United States on a related project—nuclear fission.\n\nThe Atomic Bomb\n\nDespite the onset of World War II, Bohr was convinced that this project would not result in the development of an atomic bomb anytime in the near future.\n\nThus, he focused his efforts during the war on helping refugees by finding jobs outside of Germany for his Jewish colleagues.\n\nThen, several important things happened in 1943. First, James Chadwick, Bohr’s colleague, reached out to Bohr with an offer to work on a secret project in England.\n\nJames Chadwick Facts – Famous Scientists\n\nThen, the Danish government fell under full German occupation.\n\nBohr evacuated to Sweden, and then finally accepted the offered position with Chadwick to work on the development of an atomic bomb, if only to ensure that the Allied powers succeed before Germany did.\n\nThrough his work with Chadwick and the famous Robert Oppenheimer, the Allied powers did develop and utilize the atomic bomb, assisting in the end of the war.\n\nBohr returned to Denmark immediately after, to great praise.\n\nLater Years\n\nBohr spent the rest of his life meeting with politicians in attempt to promote peace in the wake of the atomic bomb development, establishing foundations that would carry on the legacy of scientific research and exploration.\n\nThese foundations include the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics.\n\nNiels Bohr passed away in 1962 with a large legacy of scientific discovery that is still in operation today."
