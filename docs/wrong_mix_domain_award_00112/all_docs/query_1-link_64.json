        "text": "Niels Bohr greatly contributed to the modern atomic model. He provided great knowledge on the atom and physics. He is considered to be one of the greatest physicists of all time because of his contributions to the atomic model. This required the help from a few of his fellow physicists, such as Ernest Rutherford and J.J. Thomson. Niels Bohr created the Bohr model in which he built his ideas from Rutherford and Thomson to create what he thought the atom looked like. Bohr believed that the middle of an atom is a positively charged nucleus with electrons surrounding it. He also discovered that the electrons were not in a specific orbit around the nucleus instead, they jumped around depending on the amount of energy they had.\n\nNiels Bohr was born on October 7, 1885, in Copenhagen, Denmark. His parents are Christian and Ellen Bohr. His father was a Professor of Physiology at Copenhagen University. He had two siblings, Harald and Jennifer Bohr. His brother became a professor of Mathematics. He was married to Margaret Norlund who he married and had six children with. Two of his siblings died early in their childhood, but the others went on to do great things. One of them even received a Nobel Prize in physics. Bohr died on November 18th, 1962 from a stroke. …show more content…"
