        "text": "Click here to watch the video\n\nGastronomy is at the heart of France and has evolved of the centuries into the envy of the world. France has always taken the best that it could find throughout the world to incorporate into its cuisine. This culinary exchange continues between our two continents, between our two countries, today. While U.S. foods, such as sweet potatoes and cranberries, were virtually unknown in France just ten years ago, today we find them everywhere. Our lobster, beef, wild salmon, king crab, pistachios, and almonds have long been a key ingredient in French cuisine. Of course, the history of grapes and wine is a long one of exchanges of vine grafting and wine making techniques.\n\nThe Office of Agricultural Affairs of the United States Embassy was eager to introduce French chefs and restaurateurs what was best from the U.S. on the French market. In this exercise, during a dinner held at the Hotel de Talleyrand in Paris, the talented chefs Jerôme Banctel and Jerôme Schilling staged wonderful recipes to highlight products such as king crab, North Pacific wild salmon, cod from Alaska, Maine lobster or beef angus. Marc Lecomte dazzled the guests with his pastry chef talents using California pistachios, almonds and cranberries. Finally, the head sommelier Romain Iltis delighted their palates with California and Washington State wine selection.\n\nHotel de Talleyrand, built in the seventeenth century, was home to Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. Count Talleyrand, who served many different regimes in the nineteenth century in France, was recognized as one of the most famous diplomats of his time, and was a devotee to the idea of using food in diplomacy. After World War II, the United States first rented and then bought the hotel Talleyrand from the Rothschild family to house the administration of the Marshall Plan, which was instrumental in rebuilding Europe.\n\nThe protagonists of the dinner:\n\nJerome Banctel, La Réserve ** - Paris\n\nTrained alongside the greatest - Alain Senderens and Bernard Pacaud at L'Ambroisie - Jerome Banctel was also inspired by his travels in Japan. In February 2016, the Michelin Guide awarded an extremely rare award, two stars at Gabriel.\n\nJerome Schilling, Executive Chef, Villa René Lalique ** - Wingen-sur-Moder\n\nJerome Schilling made his debut with major names in gastronomy: Joël Robuchon, Roger Verge or Thierry Marx. In 2009, he joined the house Lassausaie before returning to Alsace in 2015 and participated with Jean-Georges Klein at the opening of the restaurant of the Villa René Lalique - rewarded, just three months after opening, with two stars in the Guide Michelin.\n\nRomain Iltis, Head Sommelier, Villa René Lalique ** - Wingen-sur-Moder\n\nMeilleur Ouvrier de France 2015 and Best Sommelier of France 2012\n\nHe began his career with Alain Ducasse but the passion for wine catches up starting September 2015 officiating as Head Sommelier at Villa René Lalique, two-star restaurant in the Michelin Guide, where he watches over a cellar of 20,000 bottles.\n\nMarc Lecomte, pastry chef La Réserve **\n\nThe young confectioner brilliantly revisits the great French pastry in his creations.\n\nWe sincerely wish to thank our partners without whom this event would not have taken place:\n\nFor the produce: Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute for king crab, salmon and cod from the North Pacific; FoodExportUSA for Maine lobsters; United States Meat Export Federation for black angus; American Sweet Potato for sweet potatoes; Cranberry Marketing Committee for cranberries; Almond Board of California for California almonds; American Pistachio Growers for pistachios; AFIS for Florida orange juice.\n\nFor wines from California and Washington: Opus One, with Napa Valley Opus One 2012; Scharder's Cellars and Signature Selections, with Boar's View Sonoma Coast Chardonnay 2014 Napa Valley, Beckstoffer To Kalon \"Old Sparky\" Cabernet Sauvignon, Schrader Cellars 2011; Soif d’ailleurs with Yakima Valley, Blanc de Blanc Treveri and Napa Valley, Eisrebe Joseph Phelps 2014; South World Wines with Napa Valley, Newton Unfiltered Chardonnay Vineyard 2014 Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel, Director's Cut, Francis Ford Coppola, 2013; Vins du Monde Santa Barbara, Los Alamos Chardonnay Au Bon Climat 2013 and Lodi Country, Teldeschi, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, Rawenswood 2012."
