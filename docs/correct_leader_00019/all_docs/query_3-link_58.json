        "text": "Blanc and Tiran verify if it is possible to extend Jean-Baptiste Say’s (J.-B. Say) principle of utility to morality and to politics. They focus on documenting specific and little-known aspects of J.-B. Say’s political struggle (1793–1803). The chapter also draws attention to Say’s crucial intervention. In this chapter, Blanc and Tiran show that J.-B. Say is one of the founding fathers of French liberalism in terms of political theory and that his influence on the French liberal group under the Restoration was far greater than is generally thought. The whole of the liberal group is engaged in a consistent political struggle about all these issues. J.-B. Say conducted his struggle through his teaching at the Athenee, the publication of articles in magazines and above all his influence on Comte and Dunoyer. His obsession was the stabilization of the Republican political order.\n\n[Brackets] enclose editorial explanations. Small ·dots· enclose material that has been added, but can be read as though it were part of the original text. Occasional •bullets, and also indenting of passages that are not quotations, are meant as aids to grasping the structure of a sentence or a thought. Every four-point ellipsis. .. . indicates the omission of a brief passage that seems to present more difficulty than it is worth. Longer omissions are reported between brackets in normal-sized type.-The division into Parts is not in the original, and is purely for ease of management on this website.-The section-headings are not in the original. Each marks the start of a new topic but not necessarily the end of the preceding one.-This work was written in 1790, three years before the executions of the French king and queen and the 'reign of terror' that followed.-In the last paragraph of this work Burke says that his life has been mainly 'a struggle for the liberty of others'. So it was. His opposition to the French revolution was one of the four main political battles in his life, the other three being support for the American colonists, for the Irish, and for the people of India (see page 25)."
