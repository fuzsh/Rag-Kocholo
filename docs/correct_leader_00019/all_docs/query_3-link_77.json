        "text": "He plunged in the knife, not once but twice. The first cut helped kill Caesar; the second killed himself.\n\nEt tu, Stephane? The former Liberal leader has only suffered a lesser death, a political one and without the blood-tinged satisfaction of killing the king. He tried of course and failed, which is why he met his political fate.\n\nThe examples of Brutus, 2052 years ago, and Dion, just days back, illustrate the dangers of coups d'etat, both attempted and successful.\n\nBrutus, we know from Plutarch, was a plodding, honest opposition senator. He became concerned, then angry, at the arrogant ways and brazen usurping of power by Caesar. So he helped form a coalition of knife-wielders.\n\nThe coalition dispatched Caesar on the Ides of March. But Brutus was an honourable man, at least in Shakespeare's view, and, rather than bury the body in the dead of night, he allowed a public funeral and a funeral oration by Marc Antony.\n\nThe speech was a masterpiece of truth, half-lies and spin. Brutus and the coalition lost the PR war. There were riots, followed by civil war. Brutus chose the wrong side.\n\nHis army faced defeat, he faced capture. According to Plutarch, he said, \"we must fly, not with our feet but with our hands.\" His hands took a blade and pushed it into his chest.\n\nIt could be worse, consider France\n\nAs Dion discovered all those years later, honourable is a dangerous epithet. Not only must you kill your political enemy, you must slash his spin to ribbons. It also helps to have a cameraman who can focus properly when you are making your own pitch for power and the Governor General on your side.\n\nStill, his punishment is merely the purgatory of a place in the Liberal caucus and the pitying glances of former followers.\n\nIt could be worse; it could be France.\n\nDominique de Villepin was once the prime minister of France. Now he faces a list of charges and will undergo a criminal trial in the coming months. He, too, had wanted to plunge in the knife.\n\nHis intended victim was Nicolas Sarkozy, now the president of the country. At the time, Sarkozy was only a pretender, the president of the political party of the outgoing president, Jacques Chirac. Villepin was then the minister of the interior. They were political allies and, therefore, detested each other.\n\nStories surfaced that Sarkozy had a secret bank account in Luxembourg. If true, the stories would probably have sunk him. They weren't true and when police began investigating the plot, Villepin's meteoric career (he'd been appointed prime minister in the meantime by Chirac) ran into a wall.\n\nToday, he is accused of participating in the plot to sully Sarkozy and then of trying to cover it up. If convicted, he could face prison.\n\nMore blood\n\nVillepin is a literary man who has written books of poetry. His defiant response to the charges was to cry, \"no one will put me in parentheses.\" He should probably be more worried about other curved instruments.\n\nHe probably knows that he shouldn't expect any mercy from Sarkozy. Sarkozy is a hater. As one of his advisers put it, \"there was never any question of his dumping his rancour in the river.\"\n\nSarkozy himself stated his position more bluntly. Anyone caught in the plot would end up on a \"croc de boucher,\" a butcher's hook. More blood.\n\nThere is an art to plunging in the political knife and no one was more polished at it than another Frenchman, Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-PÃ©rigord: prince, priest, plotter, revolutionary deputy, foreign minister, prime minister and coldhearted charmer.\n\nIn the course of his long career he limped nimbly through at least six political regimes. This was the period of the French Revolution and after. Bloody times in which many lost their heads; Talleyrand kept his.\n\nAbove all, arrange the facts\n\nTalleyrand helped destroy two regimes himself, profiting mightily both times.\n\nHe was instrumental in bringing Napoleon to supreme power and, when the wind turned, plotted against him and was rewarded with the post of prime minister by the restored French king.\n\nThrough it all he understood the importance of spin. Indeed, he could be said to have defined it: \"since the masses are always eager to believe something, for their benefit nothing is so easy to arrange as facts.\"\n\nIn the coup d'etat in 1799 that officially ended the French Revolution and brought Napoleon to political power, Talleyrand was busy behind the scenes arranging the facts.\n\nIf the facts didn't fit, he lied. On the key day, many French deputies revolted. Napoleon panicked and almost fainted. Talleyrand did not. By the end of the day the general was a Consul. Soon he would be First Consul and then Emperor.\n\nOn another occasion Talleyrand outlined his political philosophy. \"There are no principles, only events.\" Fine words, but even Talleyrand had a principle. \"We must dine,\" he said in the evening with Napoleon now assured of power.\n\nIn France, a coup d'etat, successful or not, quickly conjures up thoughts of meat, butchers and dinner."
