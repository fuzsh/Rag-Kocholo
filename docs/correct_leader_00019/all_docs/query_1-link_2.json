        "text": "As France’s representative at the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), Talleyrand exhibited his diplomatic skill to the full, but it is doubtful whether it benefitted France. He managed to divide the Allies, urging Austria and England to conclude secret agreements with France to prevent Russia from annexing the whole of Poland and Prussia from annexing the whole of Saxony. This new triple alliance succeeded in reducing the territorial claims of the other great powers and led to the agreement by which France retained the frontiers of 1792 (which were pushed back to those of 1790 after the Hundred Days, the period during which Napoleon reigned in Paris after his escape from Elba). In accepting the cession to Prussia of the greater part of the left bank of the Rhine, however, Talleyrand created a serious danger for France that became especially clear in 1870, 1914, and 1939.\n\nTalleyrand remained in Vienna during the Hundred Days. On Louis XVIII’s return to Paris, he was appointed president of the council, while retaining the office of foreign minister. The ultraroyalists now in power were violently opposed to a ministry dominated by two former revolutionaries, Fouché and Talleyrand, and Talleyrand was forced to resign. He then lived in retirement, writing his memoirs, until 1829, when his scheming political sense led him to ally himself with the Liberals in order to remove Charles X, the brother and successor of Louis XVIII. He established contact with Louis-Philippe and helped to make him king during the July Monarchy of 1830. As ambassador to London, from 1830 to 1834, he played a vital part in the negotiations between France and Great Britain that resulted in the creation of a neutral kingdom of Belgium. His diplomatic career was crowned by the signing of an alliance between France, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal in April 1834.\n\nTalleyrand died in 1838 and received the last sacraments, having signed, a few hours before his death, a document in which he declared himself reconciled with the church. He was buried at his château of Valençay. He had separated from his wife in 1815 and left no legitimate descendants.\n\nJacques Godechot"
