        "text": "• By it, legislative power lay with the emperor and a two-chamber parliament, made up of:\n\nPeers: hereditary members appointed by the Emperor.\n\nRepresentatives: 629 citizens elected for 5-year terms by electoral colleges in the départements.\n\nMinisters to be responsible to Parliament, there were guarantees of rights.\n\nThis arrangement lasted only one month, until Napoleon overthrown and abdicated.\n\n• The degree of support Napoleon got in hundred days made allies rethink their formerly generous treatment of France.\n\n• Vienna congress hastily reconvened.\n\n• Victors more determined to ensure France would never again threaten European peace.\n\n• New Paris peace of November 1815 thus more punitive…\n\n1. French frontiers reduced to those of 1790, not 1792.\n\n2. Indemnity of 700 million francs, as well as costs of defensive fortifications in neighbouring countries.\n\n3. France had to return all looted artworks.\n\n4. Would have an army of occupation under the Duke of Wellington for five years, or until indemnity paid; costs of this met by French."
