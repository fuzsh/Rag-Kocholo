Dishes were displayed on decorated bases or socles, and ornate carvings and statuary in lard and in spun sugar was an essential, if inedible, part of any of Carême’s grand dinners.\n\nBeauvilliers, who summed up his own life’s work in L’Art du cuisinier in 1814, the year before Carême’s first books appeared, ridiculed Carême’s masterpieces of picturesque ruins made of lard and Greek temples in sugar and marzipan.\n\nCarême claimed that his art supplied food for mind and heart, and pleasurably filled the gastronome’s leisure. To which Beauvilliers retorted that the cook’s job was not to please the eye but the palate; not to fill one’s leisure but one’s belly pleasurably.”"
