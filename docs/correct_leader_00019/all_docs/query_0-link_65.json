        "text": "WELCOME TO CHATEAU DE VALENCAY\n\nThe Valençay estate is a major French heritage destination, with a rich and singular history that started during the Renaissance with the Estampes family, before becoming the home of the illustrious Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, an unparalleled diplomat and minister to Napoleon. The château features an abundance of historical furnishings, as well as a large park spanning some 50 hectares, alternating between gardens and forests. It also played an important role during World War II, as a storehouse for works of art from the Louvre.\n\nToday, the château is driven by a desire to share a unique experience with visitors who will appreciate every aspect of its way of life, along with the vibrations emanating from this living place.\n\nThe Château de Valençay is one of the major sites in the Loire Valley.\n\nOPENING HOURS\n\nThe domain of Valençay is currently closed. Reopening on Saturday March 19, 2022 at 10 a.m.\n\nHEALTH PASS\n\nIn application of government instructions, from July 21, 2021, presentation of the health pass is mandatory for visiting the castle and gardens.\n\nThis applies to persons aged 12 and over.\n\nThe health pass will be requested upon arrival at the ticket office. It can be presented in paper format with QR Code, in PDF format or with the “TousAntiCovid” application.\n\nVISIT\n\nREMARKABLE COLLECTIONS\n\nBeautiful collections of furniture sculptures, paintings and precious objects give the Château of Valençay a still inhabited look. Various coordinating styles contribute to this place’s charm and bear witness to the drastic changes in French government throughout Prince of Talleyrand’s lifetime. The Empire-style furniture is absolutely stunning in the light coming through the large windows with its power, strength and references to the Napoleonic era. Through its elegance and charm, the 18th century furniture reflects the light-hearted and worldly spirit of aristocratic society that defined the style and etiquette of the great lord that Talleyrand never ceased to be.\n\nRead more\n\nVISIT\n\nTHEATRE\n\nThe Château de Valençay contains a theater known for its extraordinary authenticity. Most of the period ornamentation and props have been preserved, particularly a remarkable series of sets. Designed at the request of Talleyrand, to entertain him and his guests, it was built between 1819 and 1820, as part of a large-scale construction project that brought in local artisans and other specialists, like the Parisian decorator Ciceri.\n\nThe château’s sporadic cultural seasons unfold in this setting, where talented actors and musicians make the building resonate with sensitivity and artistic fervor.\n\nVISIT\n\nFOR CHILDREN\n\nBetween a prince, a princess, a duchess, cooks and actors, all of the ingredients are there to inspire the daydreams of youngsters, as they gaze upon the château’s magnificent features with wonder.\n\nBooklets of games and trivia are available for free at the château’s entrance.\n\nIn the gardens, it goes without saying that the farm animals are favorites with our younger guests, who are fascinated by the (goat) kids leaping, the lambs bleating, the geese jeering, and the list goes on.\n\nIn the middle of the lovely, little herb-filled Antonin’s Garden, come and play the Game of Scents, as you try to identify the hidden plant species…\n\nThere is also a children’s playground near the château, with slides and a wooden play structure.\n\nVISIT\n\nGASTRONOMY\n\nCharles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, a sophisticated gourmet, made the Château de Valençay into a temple of culinary art. As an expert in politics and diplomacy, he knew that a well-stocked dining table can be an excellent weapon. Not to be outdone, his successors brilliantly carried on that tradition of fine cuisine. The history and atmosphere of the Château de Valençay are still imbued with that delicate and refined lifestyle today."
