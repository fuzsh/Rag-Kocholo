        "text": "Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand's family had aristocratic roots but lacked its befitting wealth. However, the Talleyrands were very proud of their family tree.\n\nOlder spellings of the name Talleyrand are Taleyrand, Taleyran, Talieran, or Tailleran.\n\nThe name Talleyrand is of unknown origin and goes back to the 12th century. Some think it stems from a feudal tenure, others think it started as a nickname for soldiers (taille rangs = mow down the ranks) and eventually developed into a surname.\n\nHere is the coat of arms of the Talleyrand-Périgords at their tomb at the cemetery of Auteuil — three rampant lions with crowns:\n\nTalleyrand Coat of Arms\n\nPhoto Mu/Wiki\n\nRe Que Diou = Rien Que Dieu, or Nothing but God, in other words Only God Above Us, a motto that reflects the proud mindset of the Talleyrands, especially in light of the fact that France was governed by an absolute monarch until 1792.\n\nTalleyrand's paternal grandfather, Daniel-Marie-Anne, Marquis de Talleyrand-Périgord, Comte (count) de Grignols, was killed at the Siege of Tournai.\n\nCharles' father was Charles-Daniel, Comte (count) de Talleyrand-Périgord, who lived from June 16, 1734 - November 4, 1788, and made it to lieutenant general in the royal army.\n\nCharles' mother was Alexandrine-Marie-Victoire-Eléonore de Damas d'Antigny, daughter of Joseph-François, Marquis d'Antigny, who died June 14, 1809.\n\nThe two married on January 12, 1751. Charles-Daniel was 16, Alexandrine was 22 years old at the time. They had four sons.\n\nTheir fist son was Alexandre-François-Jacques, born on January 18, 1752. Alex died at five years of age.\n\nTheir second son was Charles-Maurice.\n\nTheir third son was Archambauld-Joseph, born in 1762. Following his father's example, Archie became lieutenant general as well.\n\nTheir fourth son was Boson-Jacques, also lieutenant general, and later governor of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.\n\nCharles married Catherine Noël Grand, nee Worlée. Born November 21, 1762.\n\nIn 1815, they separated.\n\nTalleyrand had no legitimate children.\n\nPérigord is a region in southern France, located between the cities Bordeaux and Limoges.\n\nWay back when, the Petrocorii, or Petragorici, a Gallic tribe, dominated the area with headquarters at today's Perigueux. Then the Romans took over, followed by the Visigoths, after which the Merovingian kings moved in.\n\nGuillaume de Périgord, is the first on record with the added surname Talleyrand (or Talairan.) In 1115, Guillaume became the Count of Perigord.\n\nHere is the County of Périgord circled on a map showing France in 1328, just before the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nMap Location of Périgord, France 1328\n\nClick map to enlarge.\n\nSome of the Talleyrands made it to Seigneur (Lord) de Grignols and Seigneur de Chalais.\n\nFor more details on this family tree see also Comtes de La Marche & de Périgord.\n\nBénévent is the French name for the Italian city Benevento in southern Italy. Here is Benevento on a map, see red marker:\n\nMap Location of Bénévent, or Benevento, in Italy\n\nGoogle Map\n\nWhat connections did Talleyrand have with Benevento?\n\nIn 1806, Napoleon called Benevento part of his realm, established a principality, and gave it to Talleyrand. We read,\n\n\"Wishing to testify to our Grand Chamberlain and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Talleyrand, our gratitude for the services he has rendered to our crown, we have resolved to transfer to him, as in fact we do transfer to him by these presents, the principality of Benevento, with the title of Prince and Duke of Benevento, to hold and fully to possess the same in full property and sovereignty as the immediate fief of our crown.\"\n\nGiven at our palace of St. Cloud,\n\n5th of June, 1806\n\nNapoleon\n\nFormerly ruled by the Papacy, Pope Pius VII complained, of course. Here is Benevento's political situation on a map before it was annexed by Napoleon.\n\n1803 Germany and Italy\n\nWhile Benevento was under Napoleon and Talleyrand, the map looked like this:\n\n1810 Europe: Napoleon's Power\n\nIn 1815, after the Congress of Vienna, Benevento was returned to the Church. However, the Pope could enjoy Benevento only until 1860, when its citizens voted to become part of a united Italy. But that was long after Talleyrand's death.\n\nHere is a map of Italy after the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna in 1815:\n\n1815-1870 Italy\n\nThus, Talleyrand carried his title Prince de Bénévent, or Prince of Benevento, only from 1806 - 1815."
