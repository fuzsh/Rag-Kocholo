SCRC collects materials from different cultures and time periods to preserve and make available the historical record. These materials document the time period when they were created and the view of their creator. As a result, some may demonstrate racist and offensive views that do not reflect the values of UK Libraries.\n\nIf you find description with problematic language that you think SCRC should review, please contact us at SCRC@uky.edu."
