        "text": "Full Name: Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-PÃ©rigord\n\nProfession: Politician and Diplomat\n\nBiography: While Talleyrand's career began as a bishop, he quickly worked his way to the highest levels of the French government. Under Louis XVI, the French Revolution, Napoleon, Louis XVIII, and Louis-Philippe, he typically served as the foreign minister or in other diplomatic roles. He was Napoleon's chief diplomat during his conquest of Europe.\n\nEven those who saw him as a traitor couldn't deny the skill with which he carried out his office. Klemens von Metternich, the Austrian foreign minister and chancellor, once described him as a \"sharp edged instrument, with which it is dangerous to play\", and his name has since become a metaphor for a particularly resourceful and masterful statesman.\n\nBorn: February 2, 1754\n\nBirthplace: Paris, France\n\nStar Sign: Aquarius"
