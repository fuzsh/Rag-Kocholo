Talleyrand recognizes how revolutions are not sudden eruptions, but rather gradual transformations that germinate within the hearts and minds of people. These seeds of revolution hold the potential to bring about significant changes on a global level, yet their progress often appears slow and passive. Despite their apparent lack of immediate action, these seeds ultimately fulfill their promise, igniting the flames of change and reshaping the course of history. Talleyrand's wisdom serves as a reminder that revolution is a nuanced process, and the quiet determination found within the seeds of change can ultimately yield transformative and far-reaching results.",
