The first was a treaty of cession and the other two outlined the details of the financial transactions.\n\nThese photos, from the National Archives, show the primary financial agreement which stated the U.S. would pay $60 million francs ($11,250,000) to France. It was signed by Napoleon Bonaparte and the French foreign minister, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord.\n\nThe other financial agreement for 20 million francs ($3,750,000) was for claims and debts that France owed the people of the U.S., which were factored into the transaction."
