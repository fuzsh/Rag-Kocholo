Talleyrand and Valençay or “The cook, the diplomat, his wife and her lover”* * With apologies to Peter Greenaway \"Ce n'est pas de repos que je sens le besoin, mais c'est de liberté. Faire ce que l'on veut, penser à ce qu'il plaît, suivre sa pente au lieu de chercher son chemin : voilà le vrai repos dont j'ai besoin, et celui- là, je le trouve ici. \" \"It’s not rest I feel I need but liberty. Do what you like, think what you please, follow your inclination instead of looking for your way: that’s the real peace that I need, and this peace I find here (at Valençay ).\" Talleyrand (1817)\n\n3. Talleyrand and Valençay or “The cook, the diplomat, his wife and her lover” Part One (1754-1803) On a very wet day during a very wet summer last year, I visited Valençay, a Renaissance château located in the heart of France. It’s a beautiful building in its own right with a history going back some 600 years, but the reason for my visit was its association over just 35 of those years with one of the most complex, intriguing, and controversial figures in French history: Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. destined for a military career but for a club foot. (One of his many sobriquets in later life was “le diable boîteux”: “the limping devil”.) Instead it was decided he should follow his uncle into the church. Ordained at the age of 25, ten years later he was consecrated bishop of Autun, a town – true to character – that he only stayed in for a month, admittedly with good reason. We are in 1789 and the King, Louis XVI, whose control of the country was gradually slipping away, had recalled the States General for the first time since 1614. Talleyrand was to sit as a representative of the First Estate, the Catholic clergy (the other Estates being the Second representing the Nobility, and the Third representing the Commoners). This marked a turning point in Talleyrand’s Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. Talleyrand acquired the château in 1803 at the age of 49. France’s Minister for Foreign Relations at the time, he had already had an extraordinarily eventful life. As the firstborn of a noble family and son of a lieutenant-general, he would have been life, revealing his true talents as a politician and deal-maker. Symbolically, in June of that year, he quit the First Estate to join the Third (the “Commoners”) and, by voting the confiscation of church property, clearly marked his break from the church. As well as not feeling any particular calling, Talleyrand had other reasons for the break: four years earlier his mistress, Madame de Flahaut, had given birth to their son.\n\n4. While in London, incriminating letters from him to the King (whose deposition he had vocally supported) were discovered back in France. This was the first of several similar incidents throughout his lifetime when he was suspected, sometimes probably fairly, of duplicity. In the context of revolutionary France, such duplicity was considered treachery, and Talleyrand, of noble origin, was classed as an “émigré”, someone who had voluntarily exiled themselves and an enemy of the state. Unluckily for Talleyrand, the British authorities also suspected him and he was expelled in 1794, taking refuge in the much more congenial (for a Frenchman) United States. Here he began to indulge in an activity he would keep up for the rest of his life and which would considerably increase his personal wealth, speculative dealing in real estate. By 1796 the Terror had given way to the Directorate, allowing Talleyrand to return and in the same year Barras, the effective head of government, appointed him Minister of Foreign Relations. Within three years, he had resigned amid rumors of his receiving backhanders during negotiations for the sale of Louisiana to the United States. But meanwhile Talleyrand was, alongside Sieyès (another defrocked clergyman turned politician), plotting with Napoleon for the overthrow of the Directorate which came with the “coup d’état” of 18 Brumaire (9 November), 1799. Rumor has it that Talleyrand was charged with persuading Barras to step down from the Directorate and had a large bag of money to help the cause. To Talleyrand’s astonishment, Barras needed little persuading and so Talleyrand discreetly added the money to his growing personal fortune. Shortly afterwards, Talleyrand was reappointed Minister of Foreign Relations, the position he held when he purchased Valençay. Napoleon needed someone with Talleyrand’s experience and skills to negotiate the peace that would allow him to consolidate his power at home as well as launch his ambitious program of reforms. By 1802, Talleyrand had successfully negotiated no fewer than four peace treaties (Lunéville, Florence, Paris and Amiens) and France was at peace again for the first time in 10 years. Between 1789 and his acquisition of Valençay in 1803, Talleyrand’s life mirrored the turbulence of the times in France. In 1792 his negotiating skills were recognized when he was sent as an unofficial envoy to London to try to keep Britain neutral in the war that was then just beginning against Austria and Prussia. Madame de Flahaut: Mistress No. 1\n\n5. Meanwhile, his private life was proving no less eventful. When sent to London in 1792, he had taken with him his then mistress and the mother of his child, Madame de Flahaut. During 1793, he met the ravishing society beauty, herself also a French exile in London, Catherine Noël Worlée. Born and brought up in India, Catherine was married to a Swiss born Huguenot who had taken English nationality to join the East India Company. At some point between their meeting in London and her divorce from herhusband in 1798, she became Talleyrand’s mistress. In 1799 she gave birth to a daughter, Charlotte. The unknown father is assumed to be Talleyrand. As part of the negotiations with the Pope in 1801 that Catherine Noël Worlée: Mistress No. 2 eventually led to the Concordat, the Pope recognized that Talleyrand, who had been excommunicated, was no longer required to follow the rule of celibacy, thus allowing him to marry Catherine in 1802. Napoleon and Josephine were among the signatories to the marriage contract. (Some sources claim that Napoleon had persuaded Talleyrand into the marriage, considering it unacceptable to have a senior minister living with his concubine.) The year 1803 was a rare interlude of peace for the country and Napoleon wanted his Foreign Minister to have a country residence worthy of visits by foreign dignitaries. (“Je veux que vous ayez une belle terre, que vous y receviez brillamment le corps diplomatique, les étrangers marquants...”. “I want you to have a beautiful estate, where you can receive in dazzling fashion the diplomatic corps, foreign dignitaries …”) Knowing Talleyrand’s disposition towards wealth creation, Napoleon offered to help financially and Talleyrand, without ever having visited Valençay, completed the purchase in May 1803. With the house came an immense estate of 12,000 hectares. Talleyrand was to keep Valençay as his country home for the remaining 35 years of his life. As we shall see, the house itself played an important role in the dramatic events that were to follow. End of Part One\n\n6. Part Two (1803-1814) On acquiring Valençay, Talleyrand started a restoration program designed to make the château worthy of its new role as a place for receiving and entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries and diplomats. In this he was ably assisted by his new wife, Catherine, who immediately took to her role as “chatelaine”. The estate included another Renaissance château (Veuil) which they didn’t intend to use and was to serve as a quarry for the building work. The garden was completely remodeled in the fashion of the time to make a romantic “jardin anglais”, a hunting pavilion was built and the house fitted out with the best furniture and furnishings in true Empire style. Along with the furnishings, Talleyrand brought down from Paris the most talented chef of his generation, Marie-Antoine Carême, with the challenge to produce original and ever-changing menus in the spacious and magnificently appointed kitchens (which are in much the same state today and are part of the visit). The house was now ready to receive. The hunting pavilion Marie-Antoine Carême, chef extraordinaire! But by this stage Talleyrand was preoccupied elsewhere. In 1804, Napoleon declared himself Emperor and launched an aggressive policy of military conquest, pushing eastwards creating the French vassal Confederation of the Rhine (corresponding to most of modern Germany and which replaced the dissolved Holy Roman Empire), creating the vassal Grand Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, extending the Empire’s reach to the southern tip of Italy (Napoleon became King of Italy in 1805), and forcing the abdication of the Spanish Bourbon King and replacing him with his own brother, Joseph in 1808. Talleyrand was kept busy negotiating peace treaties (Schönbrunn and Pressburg in 1805, Tilsit in 1807), but his differences with Napoleon were .\n\n7. becoming impossible to hide. As a diplomat, Talleyrand recognized that the severe terms Napoleon was imposing on his defeated enemies would lead to the resumption of hostilities and leave France more vulnerable. He also opposed the Continental blockade against British trade introduced by Napoleon in 1806 and bitterly resented by the rest of Europe. Tsar Alexander I of Russia In 1807, Talleyrand resigned as Foreign Minister and took up the less contentious role of Vice Grand-Elector. However, given his experience and knowledge, the Emperor continued to rely on him for advice and in 1808 invited him to the important meeting in Erfurt with the Russian Tsar Alexander I. His meeting with the Tsar was significant on two counts, one political and the other personal. For the first time, Talleyrand made clear to a foreign power his differences with Napoleon, confiding to Alexander: “C’est à vous de sauver l’Europe et vous n’y parviendrez qu’en tenant tête à Napoléon. Le peuple français est civilisé, son souverain ne l’est pas.” “It’s up to you to save Europe and you’ll only do it by standing up to Napoleon. The French people are civilized, their sovereign isn’t.” Alexander didn’t pick up on this, but he did on the second, more personal, proposal Talleyrand put to him. Talleyrand wanted Alexander to intervene in securing the marriage of Talleyrand’s nephew (and heir), Edmond, to the daughter of the Duchess of Courland. Dorothea, the intended bride was only fifteen years old (Edmond was 21) but she was reputed to have a colossal fortune in her own right. Talleyrand had never met either mother or daughter, and if his motives were initially driven by his love of money, before long things were soon to take a very different turn. The young Dorothea reluctantly married Edmond in Frankfurt-am-Main in 1808. Talleyrand did not attend the marriage. Dorothea of Courland Meanwhile, the château of Valençay had dramatically changed function. Napoleon, who had partly financed the acquisition back in 1803, made a request that Talleyrand was not in a position to refuse. He needed a safe place for the sons of the Spanish King whose abdication he had just obtained. The King and his three sons were sworn enemies and, although the King was to take up residence at Fontainebleau, Napoleon needed a suitably comfortable and secure location for the sons and .\n\n8. The Duchess ofCourland had decided it was going to be Valençay. Talleyrand personally welcomed the princes and their Chamberlain to the château in May 1808 but subsequently left his wife Catherine in charge and was not to step foot there for six years. We can assume from Talleyrand’s behavior that relations between him and Catherine had cooled and within a short time of the arrival of the Spanish party, she had begun an affair with the strikingly handsome Chamberlain accompanying the princes, José Miguel de Carvajal-Vargas, Duke of San Carlos, at 37 nine years Catherine’s junior. Today you can still see the secret staircase that connected Catherine’s rooms on the ground floor with those of her lover on the floor directly above. The affair had plenty of time to blossom. The Spanish princes and their Chamberlain were to remain at Valençay for the next five and a half years, but in fact Catherine and San Carlos’s relationship was to continue until his death in 1828. Despite the secret staircase, just how secret the affair was kept can be judged by the exchange between Napoleon and Talleyrand as early as January 1809. Napoleon: “ Vous ne m’avez pas dit .que le duc de San Carlos était l’amant de votre femme!” “You didn’t tell me that the Duke of San Carlos was your wife’s lover!” Talleyrand: “En effet, sire, je n’avais pas pensé que ce rapport pût intéresser la gloire de votre Majesté, ni la mienne.” \"Indeed, Sire, I had not thought that this relationship could be of interest to Your Majesty's glory, nor to mine.\" The Duke of San Carlos But the explanation for Talleyrand’s indifference is not hard to find. Shortly after Dorethea’s marriage to Edmond, she and her mother had arrived in Paris where Talleyrand met them for the first time. The fifteen year old Dorothea made little impression on him; the same cannot be said for her 48 year old mother, the Duchess, who had the same impact on all the men present, her beauty and her worldliness earning her the sobriquet “la sultane” (sultana, in the sense of sultan’s wife or concubine).\n\n9. Talleyrand and the Duchess had an intimate and intense affair between 1808 and 1812 and one can only surmise that this is one explanation for Talleyrand’s prolonged absence from Valençay. The Duchess was actively interested in politics, having personal connections with several reigning monarchs as well as with the leading European politicians and thinkers of the day, and in 1808 was unusually – for a Baltic German – outspoken in her admiration for Napoleon. In the coming years she became increasingly disenchanted with him and supported Talleyrand as he progressively distanced himself from the Emperor. By 1812, of course, Talleyrand was not alone in this. The long series of victories had been followed by a string of defeats. First the retreat from Moscow and the decimation of the “Grande Armée” (only about 30,000 returned out of a total of approximately 450,000 French combatants; it is estimated that 200,000 of them died). Then the defeat at the Battle of the Nations near Leipzig in 1813, where the combined forces of Russia, Austria, Prussia and Sweden routed Napoleon’s army and began pushing it back towards France’s natural border of the Rhine. By this time, anticipating Napoleon’s downfall, Talleyrand had taken up a secret correspondence with the Bourbon pretender, the Comte de Provence, the younger brother of the guillotined Louis XVI. (In exile in England, he was already known to his supporters as Louis XVIII.) The correspondence began in 1812, a year which that marks a turning point in Talleyrand’s life for more personal reasons. In that year, his mistress, the Duchess of Courland, needed to return to her estates in Eastern Europe to secure her claim to them. Meanwhile, her daughter Dorethea had blossomed proving a worthy successor (and rival?) to her mother in her beauty. She had never The Count of Provence, who was to reign as Louis XVIII hidden her dislike for her husband, Edmond, Talleyrand’s nephew and by the time he returned from the Russian campaign in 1812 (one of the lucky survivors) their marriage was in effect over. Two years later when their infant daughter died, the only person able to console her was not Edmond but his uncle, Talleyrand, who by that time had won her affection and her confidence. Meanwhile, the château of Valençay was witness to its very own Treaty; paradoxically without Talleyrand. Needing to move troops from Spain to defend France’s threatened borders in the north, Napoleon decided to pacify Spain by reinstating the eldest of the Spanish princes as King Ferdinand VII. In December, the Treaty of Valençay was signed in the blue drawing-room of the château, which is today perfectly preserved and part .\n\n10. of the visit. It appears that Talleyrand was not involved in negotiating the treaty nor present at the signing. This is confirmed by the letter he sent Dorothea from Valençay the following March informing her that the Spanish party had finally departed and lamenting the deplorable state of the place after their six years of occupation. The blue drawing-room where the Valençay Treaty was signed In only a matter of months though Talleyrand would have his own treaties to draft as he resumed his deal-making at the highest level. He had for some time been preparing the ground for a restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, in the person of Louis XVIII. When Napoleon, facing defeat at the hands of the Sixth Coalition, was forced to abdicate in April 1814, Talleyrand’s groundwork paid off. Elected head of the provisional government, he quickly drew up a new Constitution. He then used his influence to overcome the reticence of some of the victorious allies towards a Bourbon restoration, in particular, that of Tsar Alexander I to whom he played host at his Paris home in the rue Saint Florentin. Once the new king was installed, Talleyrand again became Foreign Minister, drawing up the Treaty of Paris making peace with the Allied victors. Ferdinand VII of Spain Talleyrand was set to continue to be at the center of events when he was chosen to be the representative of France at the Congress of Vienna, where all the powers were to convene to decide on the shape of a post- Napoleonic Europe. His many admirers see this as the crowning moment of his career. It was expected that France, as the defeated power, would be relegated to observer status, but Talleyrand, partly through his existing network of contacts at the highest level with the other powers, was to make sure that didn’t happen. But in addition to his network, he had another secret weapon. He chose the young Dorothea, who had just turned 21 (nearly 40 years his junior) to accompany him and in August, together with their chef, Marie-Antoine Carême, (arguably Talleyrand’s other secret weapon) they headed for Vienna.
