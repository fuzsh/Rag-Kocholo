        "text": "After the fall, in July 1794, of Maximilien Robespierre, the chief instigator of the Reign of Terror, Talleyrand petitioned the National Convention to remove his name from the list of émigrés, as he had left France on an official passport. His request was granted and he reached Paris in September 1796, immediately taking the seat in the Institut National (a creation of the National Convention reestablishing, in a new form, the 18th-century academies, among them the Académie Française), to which he had been elected in his absence. The paper that he read there in July 1797, in which he concluded that France would be unable to reconquer its American colonies and should therefore attempt to establish colonies in Africa, showed that he again hoped to enter politics. A few days later, his paper, which raised him in public esteem, and his connections with a member of the ruling Directory gained him the post of foreign minister.\n\nTalleyrand confirmed Napoleon’s conclusion of the Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797) following his great victories against Austria and negotiated the agreements annexed to the treaty, which are said to have brought him more than a million francs in bribes. Jointly with Napoleon he urged on the Directory his idea of a military expedition to Egypt, which ultimately ended in failure. Talleyrand alone, however, was responsible for a breach between France and the United States, following the indignant withdrawal of three U.S. envoys from whom Talleyrand had demanded enormous bribes. Acknowledging the failure of his policies, Talleyrand resigned, but after two years as foreign minister he had amassed an “immense fortune” that he deposited abroad.\n\nDuring the Consulate and the empire\n\nFive months after Talleyrand’s resignation, Napoleon returned from Egypt, and, following his coup d’état of Nov. 9–10, 1799, established the Consulate, consisting of him as the actual ruler and two other consuls. Talleyrand supported him and returned to the foreign ministry on November 22. Talleyrand’s principal aim was the pacification of Europe, and he began negotiation with the belligerent countries. His negotiations with Austria and England resulted in the treaties. For the first time in six years, Europe was at peace. Talleyrand contributed to the realization of Napoleon’s ambitious plans to remodel Europe by helping him to establish French supremacy in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. Much to his own profit, he supervised the allocation of numerous secularized church lands. At home Talleyrand urged the signing of the concordat between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII (July 1801), which reestablished religious peace. Then, taking advantage of the concordat’s provisions, he married his mistress, Catherine Grand, the divorced French wife of an English employee of the British East India Company.\n\nTalleyrand’s policy would have been completely successful had he been able to prevent the renewal of war between France and England in May 1803. This time, however, he did not resign. He had helped Napoleon establish himself as “consul for life” in 1802, and he continued to support him when Napoleon wanted to show that he would never come to terms with the Bourbons; Talleyrand therefore participated in one of the most dreadful crimes. When Talleyrand and Joseph Fouché, the minister of police, learned that a Bourbon prince, whom they believed to be the Duc d’Enghien, was planning the assassination of the First Consul, they advised his abduction. Although the Duke was living in neutral territory, Talleyrand promised that he would smooth over any protests to the violation of international law. And so the Duc d’Enghien was kidnapped, arrested, and transferred to Paris, where he was tried, condemned, and executed. Later, Talleyrand tried to remove from the archives documents proving his involvement. It was this crime that consolidated Napoleon’s power, and when on May 18, 1804, he was proclaimed emperor, he appointed Talleyrand grand chamberlain, with an annual income of 500,000 francs.\n\nNevertheless, after 1805 Talleyrand’s influence diminished, and his advice was not always beneficial. Alarmed by Napoleon’s insatiable ambition, which, as he clearly saw, could lead only to disaster, he resigned his office in August 1807. It was not without pleasure that Napoleon accepted his resignation.\n\nBetween empire and restoration\n\nThough no longer a minister, Talleyrand was still consulted by Napoleon, and in September 1808 he accompanied Napoleon to a congress of European sovereigns at Erfurt, Prussia. There Talleyrand had secret talks with Tsar Alexander I, urging him to oppose Napoleon, and thereafter conducted a clandestine correspondence with both Russia and Austria. This treasonable activity did not, in fact, involve Talleyrand in great risk, since it was approved by Fouché, the minister of police, who shared Talleyrand’s opposition to Napoleon’s policies.\n\nAfter Napoleon had annulled his marriage to the empress Joséphine, Talleyrand played a part in arranging the Emperor’s marriage with Marie-Louise of Austria, in the hope that this union would modify Napoleon’s ambition. But nothing, apparently, could accomplish that. After the disastrous retreat from his invasion of Russia, Napoleon asked Talleyrand to return to the foreign ministry in order to negotiate with the allies, but Talleyrand, who was already planning to restore the Bourbons, refused, unmoved by the Emperor’s anger. When the allies entered Paris, on March 31, 1814, the Tsar took up residence at Talleyrand’s mansion and was eventually convinced by him that only the restoration of the Bourbons could guarantee peace in Europe. Talleyrand persuaded the Senate to establish a provisional government of five members, including himself, and to declare Napoleon deposed. The new government immediately recalled Louis XVIII, who on May 13, 1814, appointed Talleyrand his foreign minister."
