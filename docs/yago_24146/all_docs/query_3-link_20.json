        "text": "An old question, one that surely would be better placed in a discussion, now that we have them.\n\nHowever, as soon as someone decides they are bad at math and have no programming aptitude, they have lost the battle before they ever started. Accepting they are bad at something, that they have no aptitude, this becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. It insures they will never even try.\n\nAs far as a student who decides they cannot do their work, and then manages to convince friends to do it for him, do you see, the student has learned one thing very well over the years? By appearing to be hopeless, the student has learned to get others to do his/her work. Sadly, this battle was probably lost many years ago, by people, by parents, by teachers, by friends who enabled that student, allowing the student to get by without ever making an honest effort.\n\nIs it ok if a student fails a course? Well, yes, if by failing it convinces the student to look for courses that are a better fit for them.\n\nAnd by helping the student to earn a degree they could never have gained for themselves, you are actively doing the student a disservice. Worse, you are actively doing a disservice to any potential employer who sees a degree next to the name, and may then be deceived into hiring the person. That will never end well.\n\nOh well, I imagine I will get people who dislike, even hate this answer. Some who think it uncaring. In fact, I do care a great deal. But you cannot help a student by doing their work for them.\n\nYou might best convince the student to find something they are actively good at, something they enjoy doing. That will be far more beneficial in their life than helping them to get a degree and then possibly a job doing something they will hate. And the second best time to make a necessary change is now. The best time was yesterday.\n\nFinally, for the student who decides to stick it out, MATLAB is by far the easiest language I have learned over many years. Certainly some students learn in different ways. Some may benefit from the tutorials. Some from problem sites, like Cody here on MATLAB Central. So perhaps the trick may be simply to find a way to make learning MATLAB fun.\n\nOne Guru who I highly admire lives by the saying \"There is no teaching, there is only learning\". His philosophy is that the burden of responsibility for learning lies with the student.\n\nMany years ago, universities were places where self-taught individuals went to get assistance in their learning endeavors. Somewhere along the line, the burden of expectation has shifted from the student to the teacher. Is this appropriate? I don't know. But surely the student must be motivated and take responsibility for learning. And anyone who wishes to pursue a technical career must be capable of \"crunching the numbers\" (and get the correct answer goes without saying), after all, this is where the rubber meets the road - the objective evidence of competence in the field.\n\nThat said, I think that it is also fair to take a hard look at the university/college and ask if they have been lax in their responsibility and methods for helping the students. In my day (many years ago) at California Polytechnic University, Pomona, we had computer programming from day one (FORTRAN was the only option). And throughout the degree program, every class in my major department required a computer project. Even the engineering economics class required a computer project (programing financial tables and calculations). This way, numerical methods were part of every class. I wonder about a school that will allow an engineering student to get by with virtually no programming experience. Writing code to perform complex calculations is an excellent way to reinforce learning the mathematical concepts. Learn by doing. The graduates that I talk to these days coming from notable schools tell me that they are required to complete computer projects throughout their degree program, but they are free to choose the tool/language of choice.\n\nThe way I see it, a technical professional needs to be able to crunch numbers. Your friend needs to learn to love writing code, or, if writing code is that unpleasant for him, he should find another career path. Matlab is probably the easiest computer code to work with for many reasons, so it's a good choice. I would recommend diving into one of the many Matlab tutorials, either web-based or in print (book) and learning the basics. Participation in this forum is also very enlightening and educational."
