        "text": "MATLAB is a technical computing environment used to analyze and visualize data, develop algorithms, and create models and applications. Many different tools and products within the MATLAB environment are used extensively in engineering, and in scientific and academic research.\n\nAll Stanford students, faculty, and staff have free access to over 100 MATLAB and Simulink-based products.\n\nWhat can MATLAB do?\n\nMATLAB can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including:\n\nDesign and tune deep learning and machine learning algorithms\n\nApplication development, including building a graphical user interface\n\nDevelop embedded systems and control systems\n\nDigital signal processing\n\nComputational biology and computational finance\n\nThe MATLAB campus license includes:\n\nMATLAB Parallel Server: perform MATLAB and Simulink computations on clusters and clouds\n\nMATLAB Grader: create auto-graded coding assignments integrated with Canvas\n\nMATLAB Online: run MATLAB in a web browser\n\nMATLAB Drive: share and organize files with collaborators and students\n\nMATLAB Academy: a full library of online training\n\nWhat are some benefits?\n\nYou can help your students gain proficiency with MATLAB, which is a valuable skill for data analysis in many industries.\n\nOur campus license also includes MATLAB tools that can help you:\n\nEngage students by creating your own interactive live scripts that combine rich text, equations, graphics, and code in an executable notebook.\n\nReduce time spent manually grading coding assignments with auto-graded assignments using MATLAB Grader.\n\nHelp students master MATLAB coding by incorporating pre-made MATLAB tutorials into your instruction.\n\nHow can you access MATLAB?\n\nTo access the university licenses MATLAB tools:\n\nGo to the Stanford University MATLAB portal.\n\nScroll to Get MATLAB and Simulink, and click Sign in to get started.\n\nFollow the steps to create an account. Use your @stanford.edu email address.\n\nVerify your account via email.\n\nMore information\n\nFor individual licensing, go to UIT's MATLAB individual institution license page.\n\nFor network and cluster licensing, please submit a Help ticket to UIT's Vendor Management team.\n\nMathWorks (the company that created MATLAB) offers a wide variety of training resources and documentation:\n\nGetting Started with MATLAB introductory video\n\nOnline training suite for academic users:\n\nTeaching with MATLAB self-paced online course\n\nMATLAB Fundamentals self-paced online course\n\nMATLAB and Simulink Training resource site\n\nFor technical support, go to MathWorks' technical support site."
