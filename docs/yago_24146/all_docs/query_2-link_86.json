        "text": "What Is Matlab?\n\nMATLAB is an acronym for “ Matrix Laboratory”. This is because it was first created as a matrix programming language. Designed for engineers and scientists. But anyone who has an interest in this program or needs it can use it. Matlab is a well-known and fourth generation programming language, such as Java, C+. It is now used in advanced applications such as machine learning, deep learning and data science.\n\nWhy we need Matlab?\n\nMATLAB is a very important program that many engineering students and engineers must learn. It helps to perform mathematical calculation, design, analysis and optimization (structural and mathematical), as well as gives speed, accuracy and precision to results.\n\nHistory of MATLAB\n\nIt was first developed by Cleve Moler, chair of the Computer Science Department at the University of New Mexico. Moler’s students had difficulty performing calculations of linear algebra and numerical analysis. Realizing this, Moler wanted to find an alternative way to make these calculations without having to use Fortran. In late 1984, Cleve Molar formed MathWorks with Steve Bangart and Jack Little. MathWorks released the first official version of…"
