        "text": "Most of the plots and statistical analysis done for this report were created using Matlab software, created by Mathworks (www.mathworks.com ). Plots were converted to tagged PDF format using Adobe (www.adobe.com) Acrobat.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Matlab m-files provide partial documentation of the techniques used to create the analyses and plots in this report. The m-files are not turn-key programs and are not supported by their creator or by USGS.\n\nThis code was designed to run on Matlab 6.0 with NetCDF installed. Users are encouraged to look at http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/staffpages/cdenham/public_html/\n\nfor more information about the NetCDF format.\n\nadcp_contour: Creates the contour plots of the ADCP data from all depths. (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nadcp_deep: Creates a table of the depth of the deepest ADCP bin available for each deployment.\n\nadcp_ell_plots: Creates the plots of the principal axes data by month for the ADCP. (See\"Mean Flow\".)\n\nadcp_ell_tables: Creates tables of the principal axes data by month for the ADCP. (See\"Principal Axes\".)\n\nadcp_scat_plots: Creates scatter plots of the principal axes data for the ADCP. (See\"Scatter Plots\".)\n\nadcp_vpv: Program to convert the ADCP current data into .vel files for use with the USGS Velocity Profile Viewer. (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nadcp_whisk: Creates whisker plots of the ADCP data from select depths. (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nanglextocompass: Converts angles measured in degrees counterclockwise from east to degrees clockwise from north.\n\narchive_mblt: Scans the data directories and creates a matlab file containing information about the data files.\n\nattn: Creates plots of the beam attenuation data . (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nbinsort: Sorts information into specified bins, such as sorting current into speed and direction bins.\n\ncompare_sites: Creates plots comparing the monthly mean and variability of wind stress, surface current at sites A and B, and standard deviation of pressure. (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nattn: Creates plots of the data available at each site over time . (See \"Data Available\".)\n\nmaster_mblt: The primary m-file used to run other individual commands for creating this report.\n\nmblt_windstress: Calculates the wind stress from NOAA Buoy 44013 wind speed data.\n\nmixed_plot: Creates a plot of significant wave height, beam attenuation, sediment trapping rate, current speed, and bottom pressure from Site A. (see \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nmonthly_stats: Calculates the monthly statistics of meteorological and oceanographic observations. (See \"Statistics\".)\n\nmonthly_stats2: Continuation of \"monthly_stats.m\", which was getting to large and unwieldy. (See \"Statistics\".)\n\nmonthly_stats_rivers: Calculates the monthly statistics of river streamflow observations. (See \"Statistics\".)\n\npcm_ell_plots: Creates the plots of the principal axes data by month for the point current meters. (See \"Mean Flow\".)\n\npcm_ell_tables: Creates the tables of the principal axes data by month for the point current meters. (See \"Principal Axes\".)\n\npcm_scat_plots: Creates scatter plots of the principal axes data for the point current meters. (See \"Scatter Plots\".)\n\npcm_whisk: Creates whisker plots of the point current meter data. (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\npres_plot: Creates plots of the pressure data . (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nriver_ts: Creates plots of the salinity, temperature, and river discharge data. (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nsed_trap: Creates plots of the trapping rate from the tube sediment traps by year. (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nsed_trap_2: Creates plots of the trapping rate from the tube and time series sediment traps from all years. (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nsed_trap_month: Creates plots and tables of the time series sediment trap data, sorted by month and year. (See \"Monthly Statistics\".)\n\nshow_filters: Plots the filter weights for the PL33 low-pass filter and plots the filter in frequency space. (See \"Data Processing\".)\n\nsinglejd: Converts two component julian date measurements into one component julian date.\n\nsmart_interp: A data interpolation routine modified from the Mathworks \"interp1.m\" command. This code separates the data into chunks based on gaps in the original time series to prevent linear interpolation over large data gaps.\n\nsmart_interp_pres: Similar to the \"smart_interp.m\" command, but the mean of each data chunk is removed.\n\nsort_currents: Sorts currents into speed and direction using binsort.m. (See \"Currents Sorted By Speed and Direction\".)\n\ntides: Performs all of the tidal analysis. (See \"Tidal Analysis\".)\n\nuvtospdir: Converts U and V components of a vector in speed and direction measured counterclockwise from east.\n\nvalue2index: Determines the index of the point in a series numerically closest to a given target value.\n\nweath_plot: Creates plots of various meteorological data . (See \"Time Series Plots\".)\n\nwrite_vpv: A subcall of adcp_vpv."
