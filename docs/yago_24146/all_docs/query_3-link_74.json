        "text": "All disciplines of science and engineering use numerical methods for complex problem analysis, due to the highly mathematical nature of the field. Analytical methods alone are unable to solve many complex problems engineering students and professionals confront. Introduction to MATLAB® Programming for Engineers and Scientists examines the basic elements of code writing, and describes MATLAB® methods for solving common engineering problems and applications across the range of engineering disciplines. The text uses a class-tested learning approach and accessible two-color page design to guide students from basic programming to the skills needed for future coursework and engineering practice.\n\nBiography\n\nWilliam Bober, PhD, received his BS in civil engineering from the City College of New York (CCNY), his MS in Engineering Science from Pratt Institute, and his PhD in Engineering Science and Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University. After receiving his PhD, he worked as an associate engineering physicist in the Applied Mechanics Department at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York. After leaving Cornell Labs, he was employed as an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) for 12 years; since leaving RIT, he has been an associate professor at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and more recently, in the Department of Civil Engineering there. Dr. Bober has coauthored several textbooks on Analytical and Numerical Methods with MATLAB."
