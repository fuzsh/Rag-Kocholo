        "text": "My undergraduate degree is in Mech E. The first language I used way back when was BASIC but in college I learned FORTRAN and used it to do fluid dynamics assignments. I also learned a lot about machine tools, rapid prototyping, the design process, presentation skills and time/work management. Out of college, I started out in the MCAD world working on mechanical design software and then I gradually just moved into working on software all the time.\n\nAs an engineer you are going to be faced with new tools and techniques constantly as the technology and science advances. MATLAB is very popular in science and engineering fields, so it is highly likely that you'll be using MATLAB, Simulink or other toolboxes as your studies continue, and it's likely to find it at use in industry -- although it is entirely possible that you will choose a career path (or maybe the career path chooses you!) where MATLAB isn't a part of the skill set that's required.\n\nI would say that there is almost 100% chance that having learnt a language/framework for scientific computing will be useful to you, whichever it is, as long as it is \"standard enough\" and you put the effort into learning it well. So if you have the opportunity to learn MATLAB, go for it. You might not be the person who will be coding in MATLAB (or in any other language/tool) in the end, but if you are e.g. leading a team of engineers/researchers/developers among whom some work on scientific computing, having a solid MATLAB background will make the difference.\n\nHere is another point to think about: as an engineer, it is likely that you will have to implement pragmatic approaches for solving problems, which, in a world with limited resources (in particular time and money), means minimizing the \"time to solution\". I pretend that MATLAB is a really good tool for this purpose when the approach involves scientific computing. The reason is that the time to solution is not only the computation time but thecomputation time plus the development time (plus test, maintenance, etc), and in practice the development time is quite often significantly greater than the computation time. For this reason, using a consistent framework of intermediary complexity (for the user), which offers a large set of stable tools with fairly good efficiency in terms of computation time (and the possibility to include parts written in e.g. C when necessary), is likely to be your best option as an engineer (unless you have an extremely specific [and therefore quite rare] case where you crucially need computing efficiency and can afford spending a significant time developing in C/C++/Fortran).\n\nIt's used bya lot of people in industry, not just students. I program all day at work (well okay, about half once you figure in meetings, presentations, and stuff like that) and I use MATLAB for all the Image Analysis programming, and Visual Studio (VB.Net Programming) for a few things that could benefit from a slick, fancy user interface. Sometimes the Mathworks comes through my area with free seminars and I'd say like 90% of the attendees are professional people working for a living using MATLAB (i.e. 90% are not students). So there's a good chance you will continue to use it once you get a real engineering job.\n\nWhen you are a student today, you will need to use computers very likely for over 45 years. While there are a lot of important applications for Matlab today, there will be substantial changes over the decades. But with ability to use a computer language fluently will be a base for your work constantly.\n\nI've started programming when FORTRAN77 was a modern language. It felt strange, that characters after the 72th column were treated as comments, but this was an accepted relict from the way programs have been stored earlier. While the usability of FORTRAN77 is an anachronism today, the compiled programs are still really efficient because the compilers have grown out of their infancy already.\n\nThis is not the case for Matlab: The powerful JIT is subject to changes and there will be massive improvements in the next years - at least I hope this when I see the development of the JIT engines for JavaScript in modern browsers. While Matlab's interface (the GUI as well as the toolbox environment) beat old FORTRAN systems fundamentally, the basic knowledge obtained with FORTRAN is still valuable, e.g. \"avoid repeated computations\" is still useful for (nested) loops, and it will be useful in Matlab++ R2035b also.\n\nSo in my opinion, Matlab is modern today and helps to solve a lot of problems now, it will be outdated in 20 years (at least in its current style), and the skill you can get today with using Matlab will help you the rest of your life (even after retirement, when you try to program your smart toothbrush or driver-free car)."
