        "text": "In addition to Andreas' advice, I'd also add that you might what to broaden your search to include the job titles \"engineer\", \"scientist\" and \"reasearcher\". Depending on the employer it may not be considered a \"programming\" position.\n\nThere is also a section of the MathWorks website where \"User Stories\" are written. They can be reviewed by company, product, industry, application or academia. This might provide some useful data for where to look for open positions.\n\nOn a more personal note, I found the book \"What Color is Your Parachute\" to be amazingly helpful when I looked for my first job out of college years ago. It's updated annually by the author, so it's always up to date with relevant advice for people looking for a new position.\n\nYears ago, while in grad school I decided that it would be best to learn one programming language very well, instead of a lot of languages at a mediocre level. I settled on Matlab. In the early 90's it was not the behemoth that it has become, so I chose well. Since then, at every hiring I have requested a copy of Matlab. I have never been turned down, and usually they are impressed that I am so attached to a mathematical tool. While I have still needed to produce products that require software or firmware written in C, C++, Ada, Fortran, C#, Perl, etc., my Matlab coding skills have transferred over relatively well, and I usually can get the help I need for the other languages. And I get to use Matlab for all my design and analysis!\n\nIf a company didn't get it for me, and I felt I needed it, I would either change jobs, or buy it myself. Consider Matlab as a skill and tool that you can offer a company. Most companies hiring engineers will be glad to get such an asset, even if no one else there uses it.\n\nI am smart and I know Matlab so I gotmy job atthe companyI'm working for (thedetails do not matter here). My Matlab skills have been an important argument to hire me and I've programmed 2 lines of Matlab code for my job in the last year. And this doesnot mean that something went wrong. It means, that the staff department searched for someone, who is able to use computers to solve problems and especially Matlab, if this tool matches the specific problem. But most of the problems could be solved with much simpler tools also, e.g. Windows-batch files, Unix shell scripts, R, PhotoShop and Excel. In the last case,I would have preferred Matlab, but the team had an already working Excel sheet already, such that teaching them how to use Matlab would have been a waste of time. But I could decide against Matlab only because I know Matlab well.\n\nA company, which employes computer scientists, expect them to learn and use new features. I've done my first steps in Matlab 15 years ago with Matlab 4.2 and there are big differences to modern versions (except for the GUIs...). Keeping in touch with such changes consumes more time than learning how to use e.g. the Financial Instruments Toolbox, when you have an education in financial science. Therefore your question sounds like: \"I have a 32mm open-end wrench, who will need this?\". But the companies have problems like: \"We build bikes. Currently one of the steps requires a 32mm open-end wrench, but this will most likely change in the future and there are dozens of other problems to solve also\". Anyhow, this doesnot mean that a professional handling of this tool is a drawback. But it will be only a small piece of your work in the next 40 years."
