        "text": "With TwinCAT 3 Target for MATLABÂ®, it is possible to use the MATLABÂ® functions in TwinCAT 3. The functions are automatically transferred into the TwinCAT objects and used seamlessly in TwinCAT 3 Engineering. The modules that are automatically generated can be integrated both as a TcCOM object and as a PLC function module in the TwinCAT solution. The integrated modules are downplayed with the complete TwinCAT project in the TwinCAT 3 runtime and are executed there like all other objects within a real-time environment.\n\nPredictive maintenance, Machine Learning or Test and measurement technology â these MATLABÂ® key functions can be seamlessly integrated in the control with the TwinCAT 3 Target for MATLABÂ®.\n\nPredictive maintenance is one of the most important factors for increasing OEE. The Predictive Maintenance ToolboxTM from MathWorksÂ® is ideal for developing state indicators and perform predictions. The integration of algorithms in the PLC makes it possible to synchronously access all relevant machine data. The monitoring system is transparently integrated in the control and is not a separate black box solution.\n\nMachine Learning functions from MATLABÂ®, in combination with TwinCAT 3, present great advantages: classifiers perform product tests synchronously and directly in the control or detect system faults. Regression algorithms execute virtual sensors, parameterize a system depending on the situation or are embedded directly in a control loop for model-predictive regulation. The algorithms are trained outside TwinCAT real-time and can be changed on-the-fly during the machine runtime without stopping the machine.\n\nThe integration of Test and measurement technology in the machine control system reduces the complexity and costs of the testing systems, eases engineering and leads to faster testing procedures. The Beckhoff I/O portfolio provides the raw data to the control. There these can be both saved directly in databases for documentation and (pre-)processed in the real-time environment. The extensive MATLABÂ® signal processing algorithms, in combination with integrated simulation models for HiL testing, constitute an outstanding basis for the realization of integrated, modern and powerful test systems.\n\nWith TwinCAT 3 Target for SimulinkÂ®, it is possible for models developed in SimulinkÂ® to be used in TwinCAT 3. Various toolboxes, such as SimScapeTM or StateflowTM or DSP System ToolboxTM can be integrated in SimulinkÂ®. Embedded MATLABÂ® function modules can also be supported. The models are automatically translated into C/C++-Code using the Simulink CoderTM and converted in TwinCAT objects with TwinCAT 3 Target for SimulinkÂ®. TwinCAT objects created from SimulinkÂ® have the same interfaces and properties as all other TwinCAT objects. They can be used fully in TwinCAT 3 Engineering, e.g. expand to a complete project with a PLC source code, debug and link with fieldbus stations. The block diagram visualization from SimulinkÂ® is assumed in TwinCAT Engineering. The block diagram embedded in Engineering can, in addition to the SimulinkÂ® External Mode, be used as a control for parameters adjustment, debugging, signal and state monitoring. The modules that are automatically generated can be both integrated as a TcCOM object and as a PLC function module in the TwinCAT solution. The integrated modules are downplayed with the complete TwinCAT project in the TwinCAT 3 runtime and are executed there like all other objects within a real-time environment.\n\nTwinCAT objects can be assigned to different CPU cores in real-time environment. This means that even large projects can be easily scaled, e.g. for the simulation of an entire windfarm. If speed is required in individual objects, it is also possible to parallelize calculations on several cores. That way applications from simple controllers to complete machine controls and real-time simulations can be comprehensively supported with one tool.\n\nThe TwinCAT 3 Interface for MATLABÂ® and SimulinkÂ® enables the data exchange between MATLABÂ® and the TwinCAT Runtime as well as between SimulinkÂ® and the TwinCAT Runtime.\n\nData communication between SimulinkÂ® and TwinCAT: For SimulinkÂ®, ADS client blocks that can be simply integrated and configured in SimulinkÂ® projects are provided in the SimulinkÂ® library. It is thus possible, when working from the SimulinkÂ® environment, to write data to a TwinCAT Runtime or to read data from it. An application example of the use of ADS blocks in SimulinkÂ® is the software-in-the-loop simulation, in which a regulating or control algorithm executed in the TwinCAT Runtime is connected with a model executed in SimulinkÂ®. In this scenario, the TwinCAT Runtime can receive an external tick from SimulinkÂ® to calculate the next cycle, so that SimulinkÂ® and TwinCAT work synchronously.\n\nData communication between MATLABÂ® and TwinCAT: An ADS Port object that can be used in the script environment is provided for MATLABÂ®. The object offers various methods for data exchange between MATLABÂ® and the TwinCAT Runtime. In addition to an ADS client in MATLABÂ® â i.e. the MATLABÂ® environment initiates the data exchange â the use of an ADS server in MATLABÂ® is also possible. The latter offers the option of writing MATLABÂ® functions within the MATLABÂ® environment and calling them from TwinCAT via an ADS command. An application example for the use of the ADS client in MATLABÂ® is the creation of a graphical user and monitoring interface, e.g. based on a MATLABÂ® app. The ADS server can be used, for example, to execute non-real-time-relevant tasks, such as components of a predictive maintenance system or a parameter optimization. The MATLABÂ® CompilerTM can be used to execute the programs created as stand-alone applications in the field, e.g. on an edge device or directly on the industrial PC.\n\nDay after day, machines and systems produce more and more data. Connected machines and intelligent modules form the (Industrial) Internet of Things as the basis for smart industry. The promise of smart industry is to transform these vast amounts of data into valuable information and competitive and economic efficiency advantages. This can only succeed if the data is not only reduced to the essential information and analyzed, but also transferred between the different parties in a meaningful, timely and secure manner.\n\nTo enable the use of data for value-added services, ThingSpeakTM from MathWorksÂ® provides a secure data exchange platform in combination with the powerful data processing, analysis, and visualization capabilities of MATLABÂ® and its add-on toolboxes.\n\nTwinCAT 3 IoT Communication provides basic functions for sending and receiving data via the so-called MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol in the form of PLC libraries. The PLC library can be used to establish a bidirectional data connection between TwinCAT and the ThinkSpeakTM IoT platform. Anchoring the networking functionality directly in the machine controller, and thus to regard it an integral part of a machine, offers maximum flexibility in the data flow from the sensor to the cloud."
