Whether you are new to the interview process or are an experienced professional, learning these questions will help you increase your confidence and ace your upcoming interview.\n\nWhat is MATLAB?\n\nAns. MATLAB is an acronym for MATrix LABoratory. It is an open-source software/API which was initially developed for mathematical calculations, including matrix operations. The latest software version can perform various complex calculations such as data analysis and visualization, scientific and engineering graphics, etc. Its prime features also include simulation and modeling.\n\nCheck out MATLAB course for free.\n\nHow to install MATLAB?\n\nAns. For installing the latest version of MATLAB, i.e., MATLAB R2020b:\n\nPrerequisites (for Windows):\n\nA PC or desktop computer with Windows 10 or at-least Windows 7.\n\nAny Intel or AMD x86-64 processor (for the sake of your pc).\n\nA minimum of 4 GB RAM but 8 GB is recommended.\n\nSSD is recommended, but 3.5 GB HDD space for MATLAB only, 5-8 GB for a typical installation.\n\nA graphic card is not required.\n\nPrerequisites (for Mac):\n\nmacOS Big Sur (11) or macOS Catalina (10.15) or macOS Mojave (10.14).\n\nAny intel processor x86-64 processor.\n\nA minimum of 3.4 HDD space is required, but for a full installation space of 29 GB is required.\n\nA minimum of 4 GB RAM but 8 GB is recommended.\n\nA graphic card is not required.\n\nPrerequisites (for Linux):\n\nUbuntu versions after the one of 16.04 LTS, Debian 9 and newer versions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and newer, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 12 and newer, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and newer.\n\nAny Intel or AMD x86-64 processor.\n\n3.3 GB of HDD space for MATLAB only, 5-8 GB for a typical installation. But an SSD is recommended.\n\nA full installation of all MathWorks products may take up to 28 GB of disk space.\n\nA minimum of 4 GB RAM but 8 GB is recommended.\n\nA graphic card is not required.\n\nInstallation is the same for all operating systems. You can download the software from any safe website such as its source mathworks.com or sourceforge.net. Simply open the browser, navigate to the URL above, and download the software.\n\nBut be aware of the fact that MATLAB is such a huge software with its latest update of more than 20 GB. It will not be installed overnight or in a single attempt. So, it is recommended to use any internet download manager to install it on a multi-day attempt.\n\nHow to plot a graph in MATLAB?\n\nAns. For any two points, x and y, with some values given, a function called plot (x, y) are used to plot a graph in MATLAB.\n\nx : [value of array]; y : [value of array]; plot(x, y)\n\nHow to call a function in MATLAB?\n\nAns. A function in MATLAB can be called using the name you give to the function, but first, it needs to be written in the New Script tab under the File Tab. You can simply call the function by writing the function’s name in the code area.\n\n>> function_name (in the work area)\n\nWhat is MATLAB used for?\n\nAns. MATLAB language is a high-level matrix language. It has control structures, functions, data structures, input/ output, and OOP features. MATLAB API allows to the author of C and FORTRAN programs to interact with MATLAB. It is used for various industry-level designing processes and for running the control systems and automation of different types of machines by defining a particular set of codes for an object.\n\nHow to run MATLAB code?\n\nAns. NOTE: Before running any code, make sure you save the respective code so that your progress doesn’t fly away. Any code can run in MATLAB once it’s saved by using the Save and Run button in the home tab of MATLAB, or you can simply use the F5 key on your keyboard.\n\nHow to read images in MATLAB from a folder?\n\nAns. A syntax to read an image from any folder is given as:\n\nD = 'directory where the files are saved'; S = dir(fullfile(D,'name*.jpg')); % pattern to match filenames. for k = 1:numel(S) F = fullfile(D,S(k).name); I = imread(F); imshow(I) S(k).data = I; % optional, save data. end\n\nHow to write functions in MATLAB?\n\nAns. A function can be written in MATLAB using the New Script option under the File tab.\n\nSteps to write a function:\n\nClick on the file tab.\n\nClick on the New Script option.\n\nA new box will appear wherein you will get a syntax given as\n\nfunction [y1, ...,yN] = function_name(x1, ...,xM) end function [y1, ...,yN] = myfun(x1, ...,xM) declares a function named function_name that accepts inputs x1, ...,xM and returns outputs y1, ...,yN.\n\nHere you can write a function and save it in the folder.\n\nHow to use for loop in MATLAB?\n\nAns. A for loop is used to repeat a certain set of instructions a fixed number of times.\n\nThe syntax of for loop is:\n\nfor index = values statements end\n\nfor index = values, statements, end executes a group of statements in a loop for a specified number of times.\n\nHow to solve differential equations in MATLAB?\n\nAns. Any differential equation can be solved following a set of instructions and proper syntax. But for more accuracy, we use some solvers, casually known as ODE solvers in general, used for ordinary differential equations. Some of the commonly used ODE solvers are ode23, ode45, ode15s, and ode23s.\n\nSyntax to solve differential equations in MATLAB:\n\nCreate a function in an m-file to define the right-hand side of the equation to be solved.\n\nDetermine the interval length for the independent variable tspan.\n\nEnter the initial conditions as n0.\n\nCall the solver to obtain the solution by typing the following command:\n\n[t, y] = ode23(@function_name, tspan, n0)\n\nThe left-hand side of the command is the output argument containing two vectors. Other solvers, too, use a similar syntax.\n\nAfter saving this script, we can call the function by its name or as the saved script name with given some initial conditions to get the answers.\n\nHow to read CSV files in MATLAB?\n\nAns. CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values. A command called csvread is generally used to read the CSV files but is not actually preferred.\n\nSyntax:\n\nM = csvread(filename)\n\nThe newer version of MATLAB instead recommends readmatrix to read such types of files.\n\nSyntax:\n\nA = readmatrix(filename)\n\nWhat is MATLAB software?\n\nAns. MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. Computation, visualization, and programming are integrated with MATLAB in an easy-to-use environment. It helps the user in the development of algorithms, complex calculations, simulation, modeling, and prototyping of data.\n\nAns. Comments in MATLAB can be inserted in between the codes. The syntax for comment goes like this:\n\n“ % your comment goes here. ”\n\nHow to open SIMULINK in MATLAB?\n\nAns. SIMULINK can be easily accessed in MATLAB by the use of the Home tab. Simply go to the Home tab and click Simulink.\n\nHow to implement a neural network in MATLAB?\n\nAns. A neural network is an adaptive system that learns by using interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles a human brain. A neural network can learn from data, so it can be trained to recognize patterns, classify data, and forecast future events.\n\nIt breaks down the input into layers of abstraction. It can be trained using many examples to recognize patterns in speech or images, just as the human brain does. Its behavior is defined by how its individual elements are connected and by the strength or weights of those connections. MATLAB lets you develop neural networks with just a few lines of code.\n\nThe workflow for the general neural network design process has seven primary steps:\n\nCollect data\n\nCreate the network\n\nConfigure the network\n\nInitialize the weights and biases\n\nTrain the network\n\nValidate the network (post-training analysis)\n\nUse the network\n\nMATLAB and Deep Learning Toolbox provide command-line functions and apps for creating, training, and simulating shallow neural networks. The apps make it easy to develop neural networks for tasks such as classification, regression (including time-series regression), and clustering. After creating your networks in these tools, you can automatically generate MATLAB code to capture your work and automate tasks.\n\nHow to write for loop in MATLAB?\n\nAns. Here is presented an example of ‘for loop’ in MATLAB:\n\nA = [3 6 9 4 1]; for i = 1:length(A) disp(A(i)) end\n\nAs discussed earlier, a for loop is used is often used to assign to or access array elements iteratively.\n\nHow to create a matrix in MATLAB?\n\nAns.

'FontSize', 7, 'HorizontalAlignment', 'right' );\n\nWhere imread is the function to read the image named hestain.png.\n\nConvert the image from RGB color space to L*a*b*colour space\n\nThe L*a*b* color space is derived from the CIE XYZ tristimulus values. The L*a*b* space consists of a luminosity layer ‘ L* ‘, chromaticity-layer ‘ a* ‘ indicating where the color falls along the red-green axis, and chromaticity-layer ‘ b* ‘ indicating where the color falls along the blue-yellow axis. All of the color information is in the ‘ a* ‘ and ‘ b* ‘ layers.\n\nIt follows the syntax:\n\nlab he = rgb2lab(he);\n\nClassify the colors in the ‘a*b*’ Space Using K-Means Clustering.\n\nClustering is a way to separate groups of objects. K-means clustering treats each object as having a location in space. It finds partitions such that objects within each cluster are as close to each other as possible and as far from objects in other clusters as possible. K-means clustering requires that you specify the number of clusters to be partitioned and a distance metric to quantify how close two objects are to each other.\n\nab = lab_he(: , : , 2:3); ab = im2single(ab); nColors = 3; % repeat the clustering 3 times to avoid local minima pixel_labels = imsegkmeans( ab, nColors, 'NumAttempts', 3);\n\nFor every object in your input, imsegkmeans returns an index, or a label, corresponding to a cluster. Label every pixel in the image with its pixel label.\n\nHow to implement SVM in MATLAB?\n\nAns. A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for many classification and regression problems, including signal processing medical applications, natural language processing, and speech and image recognition. The main goal of the SVM algorithm is to separate data points of one class from those of another class to the best degree possible.\n\nSupport vectors refer to a subset of the training observations that identify the location of the separating hyperplane. The standard SVM algorithm is formulated for binary classification problems, and multiclass problems are typically reduced to a series of binary ones. You can use a support vector machine (SVM) when your data has exactly two classes.\n\nHow to add a toolbox in MATLAB?\n\nAns.

Packaging your toolbox generates a .mltbx file in your current MATLAB folder.\n\nHow to add the path in MATLAB?\n\nAns. A MATLAB function named addpath is used to add a path in MATLAB.\n\nThe syntax for addpath goes as:\n\naddpath( 'directory' ) or addpath( 'dir', 'dir2', 'dir3' ...)\n\nHere addpath( ‘directory’ ) prepends the specified directory to the current MATLAB search path; that is, it adds them to the top of the path. Use the full pathname for the directory.\n\naddpath( ‘dir’, ‘dir2’, ‘dir3’ …) prepends all the specified directories to the path. Use the full pathname for each dir.\n\nAs an alternative to the addpath function, use the Set Path dialog box. To open it, select Set Path from the File menu on the MATLAB desktop.\n\nWe use the Set Path dialog box for the following:\n\nViewing the Search Path\n\nAdding Directories to the Search Path\n\nMoving Directories Within the Search Path\n\nRemoving Directories from the Search Path\n\nRestoring the Default Search Path\n\nReverting to the Previous Path\n\nSaving Settings to the Path\n\nEditing pathdef.m\n\nHow to declare an array in MATLAB?\n\nAns.
