        "text": "What is MATLAB?\n\nMATLAB is short for âmatrix laboratory.â It is a high-level programming language and platform that works with matrices and arrays rather than individual numbers. Designed for scientists and engineers, MATLAB is often used in textbooks as an instructional tool for college-level mathematics, science, and engineering. It allows for the most direct and natural expression of matrix and array mathematics.Â\n\n5 components of MATLABÂ\n\nLanguage. MATLAB is an interpreted language that can be used to create applications of varying sizes and complexities. Itâs also multi-paradigm, meaning you can use it for functional, imperative, procedural, or object-oriented programming. Notable features of the MATLAB language include data visualization, rapid numeric calculations and analyses, and built-in tools for editing and debugging software.\n\nEnvironment. The MATLAB working environment is an interactive platform comprising various tools for statistical calculations and writing, running, and plotting code. The interface includes the following features: a command window for typing single or multiple lines; a script editor for accessing existing or creating new files; an address bar; a dedicated workspace window; and a folder tree.Â\n\nFunction Library. MATLAB has a large library of computational algorithms. It contains elementary mathematical functions such as sin, cos, and tan, and more complex expressions such as matrix eigenvalues.Â\n\nHandle graphics. Handle Graphics is a MATLAB concept and methodology. Nearly all plotting functions will return a handle to the graphics object. Users can use these handles to access, view, and modify all the objectâs properties.Â\n\nApplication Programming Interface (API). MATLAB includes an API to support external programs and interfaces despite being a self-contained environment. Its supported functions include data importation and exportation (to and from the MATLAB environment), facilitation of client/server relationships with external programs, and calling Fortran or C programs from MATLAB.Â\n\nWhat is MATLAB used for?\n\nThe MATLAB programming platform is used to design, develop, and analyze systems and products. Originally, it was created for accessing software developed by the LINPACK and EISPACK projects. The MATLAB we know today has numerous use cases thanks to many contributions from users over the years. Examples include:\n\nData analysis\n\nLarge-scale computations\n\nAlgorithm development\n\nApplication developmentÂ\n\nEmbedded system development\n\nControl systems engineering\n\nDeployment of Internet of Things (IoT) applications\n\nCreation of deep learning models\n\nWho uses MATLAB?\n\nMATLAB was designed with engineers and scientists in mind. These professions exist in a wide variety of industries. To better understand who uses MATLAB, check out the following chart. On the left, youâll find industries or fields of study commonly using MATLAB. On the right, youâll find examples of corresponding job titles.\n\nHow to learn MATLAB\n\nYou can get started on your own by accessing MATLAB through the organization you work for or the university you attend if youâre a student, faculty member, or researcher. MATLAB is a licensed product, so youâll have to pay to use it in most cases. If you want to try running some basic MATLAB code or get a feel for the environment without spending money, consider using the basic version of MATLAB Online.Â\n\nThose who want professional training or guided learning may enroll in an online course or specialization. Below are a few recommendations and resources for learners who wish to try self-instruction.Â\n\nIntroduction to Programming with MATLAB. This beginner-level online course can be completed in just 35 hours. It takes you through the basics of handling different data types in MATLAB and covers fundamental programming concepts like control structures and functions. By the end, youâll earn a career certificate to share on LinkedIn or add to your resume.Â\n\nExploratory Data Analysis with MATLAB. In this beginner-level online course that takes about 19 hours, youâll practice creating customized data visualizations, extracting subsets of data, and using interactive tools to analyze it. You can earn a career certificate for completing this course.Â\n\nPredictive Modeling and Machine Learning with MATLAB. This 22-hour online course is best suited for intermediate learners. Youâll use applications to train machine learning models and apply the entirety of a machine learning workflow, from data cleaning to model evaluation.Â\n\nResources\n\nMATLAB Central. You can read blogs and exchange code with this extensive online MATLAB code repository.Â\n\nMathWorks videos and webinars. With over 6,000 options, youâll be able to find many of the answers youâre looking for using this extensive MATLAB video library.Â\n\nMATLAB documentation. You can find release notes, installation help, books, and more in MATLABâs online documentation.Â\n\nStart working with MATLAB today on CourseraÂ"
