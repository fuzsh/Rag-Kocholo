        "text": "Cost\n\nFunded by several campus departments, MATLAB, Simulink, and 56 other products and toolboxes are provided at no cost for students, faculty, staff, and departmental computers.\n\nHow to get it\n\nUsers download MATLAB from personal accounts from the CU Boulder - Mathworks Portal using the instructions and codes posted specifically for students or for faculty/staff.\n\nOnce an account is created, it can be used for downloading, updating, and licensing MATLAB on the user's Mac and Windows and Linux workstations. And, through the same account, the user can use MATLAB Mobile (a free app) on an iPhone, iPad, or Android device.\n\nThe campus site license expires in December each year, so users renew their licenses annually around that time. Choose \"Licensing\" from MATLAB's Help menu and choose Update Current License. If not updated by the end of December, a user must reactivate the license by running the computer's Activate MATLAB utility, or take the opportunity to upgrade to the latest version by downloading it from the personal MathWorks account.\n\nDocumentation and training\n\nYour MATLAB access includes online, on-demand MATLAB courses. These interactive, self-paced classes provide progress reporting, certification of completion and cover topics such as:\n\nCore MATLAB\n\nMATLAB Fundamentals (20 hrs, 17 lessons)\n\nData Processing and Visualization (7 hrs, 10 lessons)\n\nProgramming Techniques (14 hrs, 9 lessons)\n\nFinancial Applications (14 lessons)\n\nData Science\n\nMachine Learning (14 hrs, 7 lessons)\n\nDeep Learning (14 hrs, 12 lessons)\n\nComputational Mathematics"
