        "text": "What is MATLAB?\n\nMATLAB is one of the most popular fourth-generation programming languages in the world. It is one of the best numerical analysis environment. MATLAB is also the most powerful and high-performance language that is used in technical computing. It is built to solve the problems which use mathematics notations.\n\nIt is used for matrix calculations and developing the algorithms; we also used it for creating UI and data visualization. It also allows you to run the programs that have been created in any other programming language. It means that you can utilize the strength of other programming languages in MATLAB.\n\nMATLAB is widely used for image processing, communications, control systems, signal processing as well as for robotics. MATLAB was founded in the year 1970 by Cleve Moler to help his students. He was a professor at the University of New Mexico.\n\nBut MATLAB was commercially available in the year 1983. To launch the MATLAB program commercially, Jack Little and Steve Bangart rewrote the MATLAB in C language. And then start distributing the software under their company license named Math Works in the year 1984.\n\nFeatures of MATLAB\n\nVariables\n\nVectors and matrices\n\nStructures\n\nFunctions\n\nFunction handles\n\nClasses and object-oriented programming\n\nUses of Matlab\n\nEngineering solutions\n\nThe majority of engineers in various fields are relying on the different kinds of math functions and calculations. It helps them to ensure that the results of any new theory. Creating the new always requires the use of mathematics because it helps the other understands the idea of the latest technology in engineering.\n\nImpact on education\n\nMATLAB is the best option to learn as statistics or Math software. It also has a high impact on education MATLAB is specially designed for the students. Therefore you can find some education-related materials at their official site. If you learn MATLAB more effectively to solve complex problems with its follow standards.\n\nThen you can also solve complex problems on other software too because its follow standards are equally applicable to other products. Mathworks offers a special discount for students to purchase Matlab. A variety of MATLAB versions are available for use to the students.\n\nGetting involved in science\n\nScientists use MATLAB more often than any other professionals. The reason is the scientist use it to explore new theories. Matlab offers the “what if” analysis, which helps you to confirm the viability of your new theory, which you have been evolved. MATLAB use in approximately almost every science. Medical science is using it daily.\n\nEmploying image processing\n\nImage processing is one of the significant techniques that are used with the help of MATLAB. It is the act of managing the pixels in an image by modifying the matrix values with the help of math techniques. Image processing usually involved adding two matrices together. You can also create and test the new image processing techniques\n\nWireless communications\n\nMATLAB also plays a crucial role in wireless communication technology. Basically, it refers to connecting two devices using a wireless signal.\n\nThe wireless team uses MATLAB to reduce development time. The use of MATLAB also eliminates the design problems in the early stages. Apart from that, it also provides the streamlined testing and verification of wireless devices..\n\nTest and Measurement\n\nMost of the companies and factories test the electronic product before making it commercially available for the users. In these electronic products, go through the range of tests. These starts start from physical tests that is used to identify any physical defects. Matlab is having lots of tools that you use to acquire and automate your testing tasks.\n\nRobotics\n\nRobotics is the fastest-growing field of science and engineering. It does not just depend on any particular type of engineering. Robotics is a combination of mechanical engineering, computer science, and electronic engineering.\n\nIt is quite easy for the robotics researchers and engineers to develop, design and tune the robotic algorithms with the help of MATLAB.\n\nData Analytics\n\nMATLAB playing a crucial role in data analytics. It is the process of studying data to gain useful insights. There are numerous amount of software and tools available for data analytics.\n\n,br> But Engineers and IT personnel are more likely to use MATLAB for data analytics. Apart from that, they build the Big Data Analytics Systems with the help of MATLAB.\n\nDeep Learning\n\nDeep learning also has its part in the uses of Matlab. It is part of machine learning. MATLAB is quite helpful in Deep learning; the reason is it is quite easy to build the deep learning model with the help of a few simple lines of code using MATLAB. You do not need to have expert to develop Deep learning using MATLAB.\n\nMotor and power control\n\nMotor and power control is also a part of the uses of MATLAB. It helps to regulate speed and other performance characteristics. Apart from that, MATLAB also has algorithms for precision control and system protection. It also reduces the cost of creating and developing the algorithms.\n\nPredictive Maintenance\n\nMATLAB is also playing its part in predictive maintenance. It is a technique that is used to figure out the condition of house equipment. It helps you to find out the maintenance date of the machine."
