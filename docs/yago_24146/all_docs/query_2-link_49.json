        "text": "MATLAB is a unique programming language which is mostly used by scientists and engineers. Hence, aspiring tech professionals wish to understand and learn this programming language.\n\nThere is a long list of programming languages if one needs to list them out. While some programming languages are quite popular, some arenâ€™t that or have lost their charm with the introduction of new programming languages. Every tech aspirant wishes to master some programming languages. One such programming language that tech aspirants are now wishing to gain knowledge of is MATLAB.\n\nAlso read: Microsoft to stop providing updates to .NET Core 3.1\n\nWhat is the MATLAB programming language?\n\nMATLAB is a programming language which was developed by the collaborative works of Cleve Moler and John Little in the mid-1980. This programming language was designed for engineers and scientists to help them analyse and design products and systems that would help in the transformation of the world. This is a matrix-based programming language which allows the most natural expressions of computational mathematics.\n\nWhat is the use of this programming language?\n\nThis programming language enables users to take ideas from research to production by deploying them in enterprise applications and embedded devices and integrating model-based design. The language is designed to let programmers think and work the way they want, making it accessible and usable by both beginners and experts alike. Millions of engineers, scientists, and students around the world use his MATLAB for a wide variety of industrial and academic applications.\n\nAlso read: Top 5 programming languages for gig workers\n\nWhy has MATLAB gained hype?\n\nMATLAB is a unique programming language which is mostly used by scientists and engineers. Hence, aspiring tech professionals wish to understand and learn this programming language to get good job roles easily. Also, since this programming language is generally used by scientists, researchers, or educational institutions, the job roles of this programming language are quite different from others.\n\nMATLAB experts are employed in scientific laboratories, educational institutions, and research centres. These candidates use this programming language to present an enhanced scientific graphical view with appropriate computational mathematics logic in the backend. There are several positions that MATLAB professionals may follow.\n\nAlso read: 5 Underrated programming languages worth checking out\n\nWhat are the necessary skills for becoming a MATLAB professional?\n\nAlthough MATLAB is a high-level programming language, building and running applications is a little different from other programming languages. Therefore, before using MATLAB, engineers and scientists should be familiar with other high-level or object-oriented programming languages such as C, C++, or Java. It is also recommended that they have a good knowledge of mathematical terms such as matrices, arrays, algebra, numbers, polynomials, and differential equations.\n\nhttps://techgig.com/generateHttpWebService-v2.php?tgtype=SAVE_NEWS_READ_LOGS&news_id=93322390&news_title=Why has the MATLAB programming language gained hype?&news_sec=Technology Guide&tags=matlab, MATLAB porfessionals, jobs in MATLAB programming, MATLAB programming language careers, MATLAB programming language, &news_url=https://content.techgig.com/technology-guide/why-has-the-matlab-programming-language-gained-hype/articleshow/93322390.cms&ppuserinfo="
