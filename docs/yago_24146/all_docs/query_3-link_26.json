        "text": "Overview\n\nMATLAB is a high-level language that includes mathematical functions for solving engineering and scientific problems. You can produce immediate results by interactively executing commands one at a time. However, MATLAB also provides features of traditional programming languages, including flow control, error handling, and object-oriented programming (OOP). Attend this webinar to learn more about programming capabilities in MATLAB and to learn how to be more productive working with MATLAB\n\nHighlights\n\nExploring the fundamentals of the language\n\nWriting programs to automate your workflow\n\nDeveloping robust, maintainable functions\n\nLeveraging tools for efficient program development\n\nAbout the Presenter\n\nRenee Qian holds an M.S. from the Northwestern University in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on Medical Imaging. She spent two years as a Research Assistant for the Radiology Department at Northwestern Memorial Hospital quantifying perfusion MR images for the purpose of identifying compromised vasculature in the brain, indicative of stroke risk. She joined The MathWorks in July 2012 as part of the Technical Support Team and transferred to Application Engineering in October of 2014."
