        "text": "This is the second article on Engineering for Physiotherapist. In the first article we have discussed hardware that is needed to develop devices/applications for physiotheraphy education and physiotherphy clicnics. Programming languages are needed to develop physiotherapy applications both on embedded systems, PC and web applications.\n\nThe programmes developed for embbeded systems are called firmware.\n\nMain differences between the promgrams run on PC and embedded sytems are real time. The operating systems like MS Windows do not perform taska at real time (non real time operating systems) [1]. In the other side micro controller units (MCU) perform task at real rime. In later articles this topic weill be discussed more details.\n\nThe popular scientific programming langues used in general purpose computers (PC) are Matlab, Phyton and Fortran. Fotran is an old scientifc programming language which may be still prefered when underlying math is important. NASA still uses older version (<1990) for calculations related to spaceflights.\n\nMatlab is a commercial program which was developed to simplify Fortran Programming Language.\n\nPhyton is a new fashion non commercial sceintific programmin language\n\nR is a special purpose programming enviroment for statistical calculations.\n\nC and its variations are the may be the most important conventional programming languge.\n\nFORTRAN\n\nThe formal name is \"The IBM Mathematical FORmula TRANslating System: Fortran\". It was developed in 1954 by John Backus. Most important advantage of FORTRAN is the speed. In those days high level programming languages may not be prefered due to compiling time and machine language is faster then high level programs. FORTRAN solved this problem [2].\n\nFORTRAN has historical importance but today there more advance and simple programming languages are avaliable for physiotherapy students for scientific calculations.\n\nMATLAB\n\nIn late 1970s, Cleve Moler started developing MATLAB. Cleve Moler's main idea was to decrease the need of his students for FORTRAN [3].\n\nMoler and Steve Bangert re-write MATLAB libraries in C for commerical purpose and they had founded MATWORKS in 1984 [4].\n\nMATLAB is fundamental scientific programming language for physiotheraphy students. MATLAB consist of lost of modules; digialt signal processing module can be used in sEMG, ECG and EEG calculations by physiotheraphy students. Image processing module can be used for posture analysis, gait analysis, fMRI calculations.\n\nUnfortunately MATLAB is a commerical program and generally it is licenced to engineering fcaulties in most of the universities. And addinitional licence is needed for physiotheraphy schools.\n\nPhyton\n\nPhyton is a non-commercial, open-source scientific programming languge. It was developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 [5, 6]. Phyton has lots of non commercial libraries for medical calculations from genetics to bibliometrics (PUBMED Modules). It can be downloded from offical web site [6].\n\nR\n\nR is a non commercial software environment for statistical computing and graphics [7]. It can be downloded fromm offical web site [7].\n\nC, ANSI C, XC8\n\nThe C language may be the most widely used languge with lost of variations / updated versions [8].\n\nThe C languge was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson in 1972 [9]. In 1978 Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of \"The C Programming Language\" (K&R C). This book was the first standard for C. In 1989 ANSI (American National Standards Institute) C become the new standard for C language. In laters new features are added and new standards for C language (C99, C99) was published. Current standard for C programming language is C-18. This version do not include new features but it is a tecnical improvement/proof of earlier versions.\n\nXC8 is the programming language for 8 bit MCU of Microchip company [8].\n\nFor physiotherapy students C is a fundamenta llanguage for developing applications in PC and embedded sytems. It has an important role where PC comminucate with devices like isokinetic. In embedded systems like CPM, eletrotherapy devices systems can be progammed by XC8.\n\nREFERENCES"
