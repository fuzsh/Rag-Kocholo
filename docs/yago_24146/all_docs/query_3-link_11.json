        "text": "Introduction\n\nMATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) is a proprietary software app developed by MathWorks. You might wonder what is MATLAB. Well, It is a multi-purpose programming language that contains its own set of libraries and IDE (Integrated Development Environment). It is used to handle complex tasks, like data manipulation matrix, data analysis, algorithm implementation, etc.\n\nNow, let’s see what is MATLAB used for by scientists, researchers, and engineers. Is it just complex mathematical computations or more? Let’s find out.\n\nWhat is Matlab?\n\nMatlab is a powerful computer program for math and data analysis. It’s great for creating and testing mathematical models, making it useful in various fields like engineering and science.\n\nWhat is the Use of MATLAB?\n\nDifferent sectors, such as AI, robotics, engineering, etc., use MATLAB to their full advantage. Let us dive deep into what MATLAB is used for:\n\nImage Processing with Algorithms\n\nMATLAB provides the environment to develop different algorithms and help process the raw images. Matrix values in image processing are crucial to managing the pixels of images. MATLAB helps with the complicated ML algorithms involved in analyzing and processing the images.\n\nData Analysis and Visualization\n\nData scientists and IT professionals use the MATLAB environment to visualize and analyze statistical data. Financial specialists use MATLAB for economic evaluation, such as loss, liquidity, profitability, etc.\n\nTest and Measurement of Products\n\nMATLAB has the sources and tools that help engineers perform various measurements and tests on electronic products. It can automate tasks and conduct tests to check the product’s quality.\n\nWireless Communication\n\nMATLAB provides unique resources and features like testing wireless devices, analyzing design flaws, and debugging errors, which can help save the time of engineers and professionals.\n\nWhat is this Matlab Software?\n\nMatlab is a software tool used for mathematical modeling, data analysis, and algorithm development. It provides a programming environment for tasks like numerical computations and simulation across various scientific and engineering disciplines.\n\nHere, you can get brief about Matlab\n\n5 Key Functions of MATLAB\n\nNow that we know what is MATLAB, you should know that a function is a set of instructions used to perform a specific task. In MATLAB, functions are specified in separate script files, and they contain function definitions and commands. The function and file name should be the same and should always be defined at the end of the file.\n\nThe five key functions of MATLAB are as follows:\n\n1. Primary functions\n\nThe primary function is the first defined function defined within a file. The primary function (main or script function) executes automatically when running the script. With the help of the command line/ additional functions, users can invoke the primary functions even outside the file.\n\n2. Sub-functions\n\nSub-functions are defined after the primary function and are only visible to the primary function. Sub-functions cannot be accessed or revoked from the command line or additional functions outside that file.\n\n3. Nested functions\n\nNested functions are defined within the primary or parent function. The nested function cannot be accessed outside the file and has access to the workspace of the primary function.\n\n4. Anonymous functions\n\nAn anonymous function can be defined and created within the command file or in the script/ function file and can contain multiple inputs and output parameters. The anonymous function cannot be accessed from outside.\n\n5. Private functions\n\nPrivate functions exist and are stored in the “private” subfolder. The parent and private functions can access and see the private functions and cannot be accessed or invoked from outside.\n\nPros and Cons of MATLAB\n\nNow that we have seen what is MATLAB and its uses, let’s explore the benefits of MATLAB:\n\nUsability: It can be used to create, debug, and modify applications using an integrated environment and MATLAB debugger. Tools like documentation, editor, workspace browser, etc., can make the prototyping of new apps easy.\n\nPlatform Independent Accessibility: MATLAB can be run and accessed on various devices, like Windows, Mac, LINUX, etc. MATLAB is flexible at switching to new platforms.`\n\nBuilt-in Functions: MATLAB provides a variety of predefined functions that can be used to perform mathematical calculations and data analysis.\n\nGUI (Graphical User Interface): Programmers can use MATLAB to create smooth and interactive GUIs and develop data analysis algorithms for enhanced user experience.\n\nNow, let’s look at some of the cons of MATLAB:\n\nComparatively Slow: As MATLAB is an interpreted language, it is not as fast as the compiled languages.\n\nLimited Applications: The language is built for scientific and mathematical calculations, making it incompatible with other applications.\n\nMATLAB Requirements\n\nNow, let’s explore the prerequisites for different operating systems before downloading the MATLAB:\n\nHow to Download MATLAB?\n\nAnyone can download the MATLAB environment for educational, organizational, or personal use. Although the versions are paid, you can take the 30-day free trial. You can download it using the step-by-step guide given below:\n\nStep 1: Go to the MathWorks official website and select the location and language asked by the website.\n\nStep 2: At the bottom of the page, click on the “Trial Software” link in the Try or Buy Section.\n\nStep 3: Now, the new webpage will open. Enter your email address in the given box.\n\nStep 4: Enter the mandatory details, check the boxes according to your preferences asked by MathWorks, and create your account. After clicking on the “Create” button, choose the “Continue with current email” option. Open your mail > click on the “Verify your email” button to continue.\n\nStep 5: Now fill in all the information asked by MathWorks, and click on “agree to terms” > “create”. It will now redirect you to the new page.\n\nStep 6: After that, you will be redirected to your account dashboard, where you can see the linked Gmail account and license number linked to the account. Remember and note this information down.\n\nStep 7: Click on the “install” button in your dashboard, and a pop-up window will appear, and the binary executable file will start downloading on your operating system.\n\nHow to Install MATLAB?\n\nWithin a few steps, your MATLAB installation is complete!\n\nMATLAB Environment (Introduction to the Workspace)\n\nAfter installation, when you open MATLAB, you will see the main window where all the user-written programs run and contain all smaller windows to use, like command prompt, workspace, etc.\n\nAlt text: Command window for MATLAB workspace\n\nEditor Window\n\nUse any text editor to create, write, and edit the program saved in m-files. While entering the command, add an exclamation character (!) as it gives temporary control to the local OS, which then executes the command. The control is transferred back to MATLAB after editing.\n\nFigure Window\n\nIt receives the command graphic output that we copied in the command panel. With enough space in the device, users can create unlimited figure windows.\n\nConclusion\n\nMATLAB is used for scientific analysis and computation of different algorithms. It can easily do complex mathematical calculations, create and plot graphs, data visualization, and make the lives of scientists and IT professionals easy. You can learn more about what is MATLAB and the real-world usage of its functions with consistency.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
