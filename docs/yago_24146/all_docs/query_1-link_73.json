Join us for this session where we will show how to use the high-level MATLAB language and interactive tools to solve an example problem.\n\nHighlights\n\nThrough product demonstrations, you will learn how to:\n\nImport data into MATLAB\n\nPreprocess, analyze, and visualize data\n\nCapture and document your work in a script\n\nCreate interactive scripts and applications to share with others\n\nAbout the Presenters\n\nKevin Cohan earned a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Clarkson University and an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. Since 2006, he has been a technical marketing manager at MathWorks and focuses on MATLAB and other technical computing products. His earlier career includes roles as a product marketing manager at Mentor Graphics and hardware design engineer at Raytheon's Missile Systems Division.\n\nHeather Gorr holds a Ph.D. in Materials Science Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and a Masters and Bachelors of Science in Physics from Penn State University. Since 2013, she has supported MATLAB users in the areas of mathematics, data science, deep learning, and application deployment. She currently acts as a Senior MATLAB Product Marketing Manager, specializing in data science, AI, and integrating MATLAB and Python code. Prior to joining MathWorks, she was a Research Fellow, focused on machine learning for prediction of fluid concentrations."
