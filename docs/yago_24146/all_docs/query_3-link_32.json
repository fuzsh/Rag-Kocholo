Furthermore, these filters are intended for implementing algorithms designed to compress and decompress digital audio data. The data is usually based on an audio file or the coding format for a streamed media file.\n\nImage processing\n\nDevelopers can process images by managing the pixels in any image. The matrix values in the image pixels can be modified using mathematical techniques. The process generally involves the addition of two matrices, where a constant value is typically added to the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values of each image pixel. The resultant image is the same size as the two combined images, with the addition of the pixels from each image. Every pixel’s intensity is represented by the pixel’s value stored in a matrix form in a computing system. For a more detailed exploration of image processing, including operations like Matlab Convolation for advanced pixel manipulation, MATLAB provides a powerful environment for developers to implement and experiment with such techniques.\n\nOnce the images are processed, they are generally taken in for being utilised in computer vision. Computer vision is a concept where the computer perceives any object, like the human eye. The technology is designed to comprehend and predict the visual output through applied algorithms. Algorithms are crucial for tasks like image processing and computer vision. Users can leverage the Advantages of MATLAB to analyse their images and build their algorithms.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\nThe MATLAB environment, with Simulink, can guide developers to design, prototype, and deploy their IoT (Internet of Things) applications. Developers can work with projects in operations optimisation, supervisory control, and predictive maintenance. Here are some key functionalities available to developers in the domain of IoT using the environment:\n\n1) Developers can access and pre-process streamed and archived data through interfaces built into the software. This data can be processed to the cloud and relational and non-relational databases. Developers can also leverage protocols for data transmission, such as Representational State Transfer (REST), MQTT, and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA).\n\n2) MATLAB lets its users rapidly design their custom IoT analytics and algorithms from a large collection of tested and pre-built functions. These functions are intended for many purposes, such as data cleaning, computer vision, machine, and Deep Learning and optimisation.
