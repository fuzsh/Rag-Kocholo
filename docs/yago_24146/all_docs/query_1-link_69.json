        "text": "The EEGLAB graphic interface is built on top of the powerful MATLAB scripting language. Enjoying the full capabilities of EEGLAB for building macro commands and performing custom and automated processing requires the ability to manipulate EEGLAB data structures in MATLAB.\n\nMATLAB Online Course\n\nMathWorks proposes some MATLAB self-paced online courses. We advise that you complete the “MATLAB Onramp,” a 1-2hour interactive introduction to the basics of MATLAB programming.\n\nAccessing MATLAB Onramp:\n\nFollow this link to MATLAB Academy\n\nOr from within MATLAB, select the “Learn MATLAB” menu\n\nNote that you will be asked to log in to your MathWorks account, which can be created for free here.\n\nMATLAB Documentation\n\nAlternatively you can also consult MATLAB’s help and documentation. We recommend running the following demos and reading the following help sections:\n\nIn the MATLAB help, you should perform the first four tutorials:\n\nGetting Started with MATLAB\n\nLanguage Fundamentals\n\nMathematics\n\nGraphics (first section 2-D plot only)\n\nEach section or demo should take you about 40 minutes, for a total of about 2 hours. We encourage you to read these sections over several days.\n\nIf you do not use MATLAB regularly, we encourage you to watch these demos, read these sections, and practice using the skills they introduce over several days.\n\nA Video tutorial for scripting with EEGLAB\n\nThis video tutorial by Mike Cohen uses EEGLAB."
