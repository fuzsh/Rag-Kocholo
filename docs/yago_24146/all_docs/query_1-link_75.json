        "text": "2.  The MATLAB stands for Matrix Laboratory. It is a tool to perform mathematical complex computations. In MATLAB, simplified C is used as the programming language. The MATLAB has various inbuilt toolboxes and these toolboxes are mathematical toolbox, drag and drop based GUI, Image processing, Neural networks etc. The MATLAB is generally used to implement algorithms, plotting graphs and design user interfaces. MATLAB is used to simulate networks due to availability of high graphics.\n\n3. Following are the main components of default MATLAB interface:  Command Window - The Command Window is the first important part of MATLAB which is used to show output of already saved code and to execute MATLAB codes temporarily.  Workspace - The workspace is the second part of MATLAB which is used to show allocation and reallocation of MATLAB variables.\n\n4.  Command History - The command history is the third part of MATLAB in which MATLAB commands are shown which are executed previously.  Current Folder Path - The current Folder path shows that path of the folder in which MATLAB codes are saved.  Current Folder Data - The Current Folder Data shows that data which is in the folders whose path is given in Current Folder Path.\n\n5. There are three commonly used commands in MATLAB:  CLC – This command is used to clear all input and output from display window.  Clear All – This command is used to clear all objects from workspace.  Close All – This command is used to close all the interfaces and return to the default interface.\n\n6. Here are the main features of MATLAB; o MATLAB is a high-level language used for complex numerical based computations, visualization, and for the development of different applications. o For exploration and solving problems, MATLAB provides an open-end environment. o MATLAB provides tools for to build applications using custom graphical interfaces.\n\n7.  MATLAB provides an extensive library of certain mathematical functions to perform operations on Linear Algebra, Fourier series, statistics, and for other mathematical computations.  For improving code quality, MATLAB provides certain development tools along with built-in graphics for data visualization.  MATLAB can be integrated with external applications and programming languages like C, Java.\n\n8.  For working with basics of MATLAB, firstly you have to setup the MATLAB environment on your system. After the MATLAB environment is set, you can execute commands after >> operator.  Example: Enter an expression like 10 + 10 and then press enter. MATLAB will execute this expression and return the result as: ans = 10\n\n9.  Semicolon in MATLAB - Semicolon is used as a terminating point of the statement. Example: x = 7; y = x + 8 MATLAB will return the answer as: y = 15  Comments in MATLAB - Comments can be added in MATLAB using symbol % Example: y = 5 % value 5 is assigned to y\n\n10. There are some special variables and constants used in MATLAB: Ans – For most recent answer Inf – To indicate infinity Eps – To depict accuracy of floating point precision NaN – For undefined numerical result I,j – Represent imaginary unit\n\n11. There are various commands used in MATLAB. Following are some of the commonly used commands in MATLAB: o cd – To change current directory o dir – To list all files in a current directory o what – To list all MATLAB files o format – To control format of the display screen o fsanf – To read formatted data from a file o fprintf – To perform formatted write to a file\n\n12.  lookfor – To search help for a keyword  cat – To concatenate arrays  prod – To find product of each column  eye – To create an identity matrix  num2cell – To convert numeric array to cell array\n\n13. There are two types of program files in MATLAB:  Scripts  Functions  Scripts - In these types of program files, series of commands are written which are required to be executed together.  Functions - Unlike script files, function files accept inputs to return output.\n\n14. Following are the different types of operators used in MATLAB:  Arithmetic Operators  Relational Operators  Logical Operators  Bitwise Operators  Set Operators\n\n15.  Arithmetic Operators - Arithmetic Operators include the operators used in linear algebra including +, -, *, /, ^. Arithmetic Operators also include Array and Matrix arithmetic operators.  Relational Operators - Following are the types of relational operators used: Less than – < Greater than – > Less than or equal to – <= Greater than or equal to – >= Equal to – == Not equal to – ~=\n\n16.  Logical Operators - There are two types of logical operators used in MATLAB: Element-wise – To perform operations on elements of logical arrays Short-Circuit wise – For operation on scalar and logical expressions  Bitwise Operators - These operators are used to perform bitwise operations on bits and work bit-by-bit using truth table for operations.  Set Operators - These operators perform functions like union, intersection, and testing.\n\n17. There are three types of loops used in MATLAB along with two loop control statements:  While loop  For loop  Nested loop Loop Control Statements:  Break  Continue\n\n18.  MATLAB is used to evaluate a large amount of data collected using computers and other such appliances.  MATLAB finds its application in signal processing and communication.  MATLAB is used to perform complex matrix operations which is useful in case of image and video processing.  Matlab provides certain graphical and statistical functions along with our such interesting features which makes it popular for a wide range of use.  Matlab is used in computational biology and computational finance.\n\n19.  Being an interpreted language, Matlab is easy to use.  Matlab provides built-in integrated development environment using which programs can be written easily.  Matlab is platform independent in the sense that it can run on different platforms.  Matlab has a vast library of predefined functions that provide solutions to various technical problems.\n\n20.  The main disadvantage of Matlab is that it is an interpreted language which means that it takes more time to execute than other compiled languages i.e. its execution speed is slow.  The second disadvantage is the cost. It is expensive than the regular C or Fortran compiler. Therefore, individuals find it expensive to purchase."
