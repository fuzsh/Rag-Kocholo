        "text": "Gerald Recktenwald's MATLAB Page\n\nMATLAB is a commercial program for interactive numerical analysis. I use it extensively in my research and teaching, and for many day-to-day tasks, including data reduction, curve fitting, and plotting of technical data.\n\nThis page provides a few links to the current and potential MATLAB users. It is not meant as an endorsement.\n\nContents:\n\nMy book, Numerical Methods with MATLAB, Â© 2000, Prentice Hall\n\nWhy Use MATLAB for Numerical Computation?\n\nThe Mathworks (creators and only vendor for MATLAB)\n\nCleve Moler talks about the origins of MATLAB\n\nAlternatives to MATLAB: Freeware and commercial software for numerical computation.\n\nMy MATLAB Hypertext Reference. It's dated, but still useful. Someday I might give it the major overhaul it deserves.\n\nME 352, Engineering Numerical Methods, my class for third year engineering undergraduates. This class uses MATLAB for programming and numerical analysis.\n\nWhy Use MATLAB for Numerical Computation?\n\nComputer users are susceptible to endless debates on the merits of various hardware manufacturers, operating systems, programming languages, productivity applications, etc. These discussions often devolve into highly emotional and hostile arguments akin to religious or ethnic conflict.\n\nWhile acknowledging the ultimate futility of arguing whether Bhudda is better than Jesus, or whether Ford is faster than Chevy, it is still useful for those not already familiar with MATLAB to answer the question, ``Why use MATLAB for numerical analysis?''. The answers provided here are not the answers to ``Why is MATLAB better than language X?'', or ``Why is MATLAB better than application Y?''.\n\nMATLAB is useful for numerical analysis for the following reasons.\n\nIt incorporates very high quality software libraries developed by numerical analysts and software developers throughout the world.\n\nThe source code for nearly all of the high level algorithms used by MATLAB is available. MATLAB consists of a highly optimized kernel which handles basic arithmetic and linear algebra operations (LU, Cholesky, QR, and SVD factorizations, eigenvalue computation, sparse matrix manipulation) as well as FFT and inverse FFT. Though the Mathworks customized source code for these functions is not available, the kernels are based on the LAPACK library. The Fortran source for these routines can be downloaded and inspected. The source code for higher level analysis (curve fitting, interpolation, quadrature) is available in the standard MATLAB distribution. This allows users to learn from the source code, and if necessary, to modify that code to meet their own needs\n\nIt is interactive. Substantial analysis can be performed by entering one command at a time and obtaining immediate results. This encourages experimentation, facilitates debugging, and eliminates the ``compile-link-execute'' cycle required by compiled languages.\n\nIt integrates plotting and analysis in one set of commands (one language). This makes it possible to instantly obtain graphical results without having to export data to another program.\n\nIt offers high level abstractions for linear algebra operations. Manipulation of vectors and matrices, including solving linear systems, is supported by intuitive extension of the basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators.\n\nIt dynamically manages memory for matrices and vectors. This makes it unnecessary to specify the size of matrix and vector variables, and it allows the size of these variables to be changed at will.\n\nIt performs operations on complex and real valued numerical quantities. For example, when the expression y = sqrt(x) is evaluated, MATLAB automatically produces a real or complex y depending on the sign of x.\n\nIt supports structured programming. Software libraries can be developed in MATLAB for sophisticated and highly customized analysis. Furthermore, MATLAB algorithms can be directly translated to C or Fortran, and there is a provision for linking C and Fortran codes to MATLAB.\n\nIt is widely used as a teaching and research tool.\n\nThe Mathworks\n\nMATLAB is sold by the Mathworks, a company in Natick, Massachussets. Their web site is a source of excellent information including reference books, technical notes, and lots of MATLAB source code.\n\nFor an ongoing source of information be sure to read the MATLAB newsgroup\n\nCleve Moler talks about the origins of MATLAB\n\nThe Mathworks created an eight minute movie about the origins of MATLAB. The movie features Cleve Moler, who wrote the first version of MATLAB and who founded the Mathworks with Jack Little. The movie shows photos of a handful of influential mathematicians who developed the first digital algorithms for matrix manipulations. If you have the bandwidth, this movie is definitely worth the time it takes to watch. On 15 Sept 2007 the movie was available as flash movie on this page. (confirmed on 2010-02-20).\n\nAlternatives to the Commerical Version of MATLAB\n\nThe full version of MATLAB is not cheap, although the student version is a good investment at approximately $100 (US). For a while in the early 2000s, it appeared that the Mathworks was concentrating its efforts on the Windows Operating system. In 2010 MATLAB is available on Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Solaris operating systems. Refer to http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/current_release/ for release notes.\n\nThe following list contains alternatives to MATLAB, including free software and similar commericial packages. I have not personally used all of these packages, but you should at least know they exist. Note that Free software means that not only is there no cost for downloading and using the software, but that the source code is available for downloading and inspection. Refer to the Wikipedia article on free software.\n\nR\n\nSoftware system for statistical analysis and plotting.\n\nFree\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, Wintel PCs and Macintosh.\n\nThe Rstudio project provides a MATLAB-like graphical user interface (GUI) for R\n\nIn Fall 2009 I began to use R for research that required rigorous statistical analysis. R is powerful and in many ways very satisfying to use. However, one needs to invest time in learning the syntax and idiom of the R language. If you do routine statistical analysis you should at least be aware of R. I learned to use R by consulting the excellent and free documentation and with the help of books by Adler, Teetor, Crawley, Dalgaard, Everitt and Hothorn and Maindonald and Braum. A more complete list of books is available on the web site for the R project.\n\nScilab\n\nInteractive system for matrix computations.\n\nFree\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, Wintel PCs and Macintosh.\n\nOCTAVE\n\nInteractive system for matrix computations, largely compatible with MATLAB m-files.\n\nFree\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, Wintel PCs and Macintosh.\n\nO-Matrix\n\nInteractive system for matrix computations, with MATLAB compatibility mode that supports MATLAB syntax.\n\nCommercial product with licencing similar to MATLAB\n\nAvailable for Wintel PCs only.\n\nPython\n\nA scripting language useful for text processing, file manipulation, GUI development, image processing and numeric computation.\n\nI use python (where I used to use perl) for manipulating text files and generating web pages. The Python language has significantly different suntax from MATLAB, and porting MATLAB code to Python requires a good understanding of both languages. Despite this hurdle, some MATLAB programmers are attracted to Python because of its broad capabilities, its ability to do interactive computing, its open source community, and its numeric library called NumPy. The SciPy library library is a relatively new and promising python library for scientific computing. The matplotlib package provides a library of MATLAB-like plotting commands for Python.\n\nOpen source with its own Python Software License.\n\nFree\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, Wintel PCs and Macintosh. Python is included in most Linux distributions. Mac OS X comes with the base python package preinstalled. Refer to the official python web site for additional advices. Free binary installers for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are available from ActiveState and Enthought.\n\nTeLa the Tesor Language\n\nInteractive system for matrix computations using Fortran-90 style array language.\n\nFree\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux.\n\nRLaB\n\nInteractive system for matrix computations. Some MATLAB-like syntax and MATLAB->Rlab converter is available.\n\nFree\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, Wintel PCs and Macintosh.\n\nYorick\n\nInteractive system for matrix computations.\n\nGPL Freeware and OS-specific binaries\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, Wintel PCs and Macintosh.\n\nEULER\n\nInteractive system for matrix computations.\n\nFree\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, Wintel PCs and Macintosh.\n\nGAUSS\n\nInteractive system for matrix computations.\n\nCommerical Product.\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, and Wintel PCs.\n\nIDL\n\nInteractive Data Language.\n\nCommerical Product available from Exelis\n\nOpen source implementation as Gnu Data Language\n\nAvailable for Unix/Linux, Wintel PCs and Macintosh.\n\nMATLAB Hypertext Reference\n\nSome years ago I put together an on-line guide to using MATLAB called the MATLAB Hypertext Reference. It hasn't been updated in a long time and there are still quite a few missing pieces. You might find it useful, especially if you are just getting started with MATLAB.\n\nME 352, Engineering Numerical Methods"
