Synced Technology did an exclusive interview with Dr. Chen Ye, who works in the education and technology market department of MathWorks in North America. Mr.Chen Ye introduced the functions of MATLAB and its products in details, especially in terms of artificial intelligence, and robots application. One of the main principles of MathWorks is to provide the machinery communication platform between people and robots, and bring the pleasant and benefits to more non-professional people. Marhwork believes that, along with these growing science and technology , human education, life and learning will be significant improved.\n\n1 . About MathWorks\n\nMathWorks has concentrated on school and education for a long time, and always be supportive to students’ competitions. This cannot be divided from the history and development of the company. In 1979, Professor Cleve Moler taught Numeric Calculation in the University of Stanford. In order to encourage students to spend more time on mathematic rather than programing language, a new programming language was applied by his own to replace FORTRAN. This language is MATLAB. MATLAB has spread among the students in Stanford very soon because most students liked it, and many unexpected application were found even Professor Moler had never thought before. One of the young man among these people is Jack Little. In 1984, Jack expanded the function of MATLAB based on its existing scale, and found the company MathWorks. Then, MIT bought its first software. That’s why MathWorks always puts its concentration on education even though its products have evolved into the standard platform for major computer science industry and model design. Students use MATLAB inside or outside classes, which is more than just learning programming. Instead, they transfer imagination into a reality by learning from this advanced language, even learning a new way to express theirselves.\n\n2 . MATLAB facilitates the combination of academy field and industry field.\n\nMATLAB, one of the main products of MathWorks, is not only just a programming language, but also a diversified platform. Another product family of MathWorks is Simulink, a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain dynamic systems. Apart from these two major tools, there are hundreds of tools that can fulfill the requirements from different industries. For instance, Simscape and SimMechanics, which focus on physical model. If users hope to simulate a human joint, they could quickly assemble movements and simulate system dynamics under the help of basic modules.\n\nMATLAB may realize the actualization of abstract concepts so that it can help students to get better understanding and learning. There are over 5000 universities around the world that are using MATLAB in the teaching and research processes. Meanwhile, MATLAB permeates are in all kinds of industries, including aerospace, automotive, pharmaceutical, electronics, energy, finance, artificial intelligence, and so on. The penetration of MathWorks in both education and industry fields gives MathWorks a special position: enhancing research collaboration and building the bridges between the university education and industrial demands. The combination of stimulation and practice, and automatic code generation are very common in industry, for instance, while the education methods in universities are maybe more traditional, resulting in the knowledge that students grasp is just from books, which is almost impossible to realize industrialization. MathWorks is committed to remedy this gap through the generality of product and the services of engineers.\n\n3 . The story of MathWorks and RoboCup (Robot World Cup)\n\nRoboCup is the largest, top level as well as the most internationally recognized robot event. Over 200 teams around the world participate in this event every year, aiming to defeat human World Cup champion by 2050.\n\nThis is really an exciting thought and ambitious goal considering there are just 35 years left. But if you think back 35 years before, we could not imagine the rapid advancement of information technology and robots, which makes me believe that this goal can be achieved eventually. Besides football as the main sports event of the RoboCup, there are also a lot of other events, such as rescue robots, logistics robots and workshop robotics applied in industries, and so on.\n\nThis event contains of several groups, including adult group (undergraduates) and youth group (junior and high school students). These robots can be divided into small group and medium group according to the size. Besides standard platform group, which means to exploit App based on the same robots, there are also humanoid group and simulation group (to make 2D and 3D stimulation instead of physical robots).\n\nWhat can we do for these participating teams and RoboCup? Basically, we can provide necessary software and technical support to help them solve problems and achieve their goals. During the competition, robots have to make judgments by themselves without the involvement of human being, so there are a lot of challenges related to early-stage algorithm design and implement, including image recognition, robot operation, motion balance, route optimization, strategy selection, team collaboration, and so on.\n\n4 . MATLAB makes programming languages easier to learn and bring more fun experience to programming\n\nHuman speaks human languages while machine speaks theirs. Mathworks creates a machine languages that is very similar to human languages so that it enables machine to understand our language and interact with human easier. We can interpret what Mathworks does as translating. It translates between human languages and machine languages as well as translates between high level machine languages and low level machine languages.\n\nThe concept of Programming Literacy addressed a lot of attention recently. It is not far from traditional literacy learning such as reading and writing, just with machine languages instead of human languages. Everybody learns programming, doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone is intend to become a software engineer. The idea is to understand how this electronics society works; as well as the basic logic reasoning that powers it. It becomes partial of literacy to understand the fundamental of how machine works when every individual owns a handful of electronics devices; When Internet of Things (IOT), Smart Machine appears in a normal household. Michael Bloomberg, former NYC Mayor, CEO of Bloomber L.P. sets learning coding as his New Year revolution. Why a Billionaire like him would want to learn programming? Because he understands the importance to understand the world from a new perspective.\n\nMathworks Toolboxes is very popular in academia and industry. Makers and amateur programmers uses it as well, as it is powerful while very easy to learn. They can easily use MATLAB, Simulink and other toolboxes to realize their imaginations and creativities. They made auto Rubik’s cube solver, smart wrist band, heart rate monitor; they created self-made family temperature control system, weather monitors, motion detectors, voice control lightings. Thanks to MATLAB and Simulink’s support with majority of low-cost hardware’s (such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Board etc.) and powerful image processing, data collection, signal processing and control toolboxes. A few lines of codes with several powerful modules, everyone can enjoy the fun making application with MATLAB without professional engineering or programming training.\n\n5 .
