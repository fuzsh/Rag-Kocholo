        "text": "Did you know that all University of Birmingham staff and students can use MATLAB for FREE? This numerical computation software allows you to create custom plots and models, develop algorithms, analyse data and visualise data sets. MATLAB can be particularly useful for analysing medical imaging data. Online training materials are available and there is a UoB MATLAB mailing list and user group.\n\nWhat is MATLAB?\n\nMATLAB® is an extremely comprehensive tool for numerical computation, visualisation and programming. It is the de facto standard for scientific analysis.\n\nWhat can it be used for?\n\nYou can use MATLAB in a wide range of applications, including computational biology, statistical analysis, image processing, communications, test and measurement. It is possible to evaluate large amounts of data that are acquired automatically from computers and other equipment such as scanners and microscopes. Other uses include:\n\nNumerical and scientific computing\n\nAlgorithm development\n\nData acquisition\n\nModelling, simulation, and prototyping\n\nData analysis, exploration, and visualisation\n\nScientific and engineering graphics\n\nApplication development, including graphical user interface building\n\nSignal processing and data analysis\n\nMachine Learning and artificial intelligence\n\nControl systems\n\nThe Medical context\n\nMATLAB has image and data processing capabilities, so can be used for analysis of medical imaging data, such as in nuclear medicine, CT, MRI and fluorescein angiogram images. UoB researchers have also used image analysis on microscope and other types of images to detect disease such as breast cancer. MATLAB has been used to model all of the interactions between chemistry and genetics in a bacterial cell infecting a lung. This was to identify essential chemical reactions that could potentially be targeted with drugs, thus stopping the reaction, killing the bacteria and curing the infection. MATLAB’s powerful visual modelling/simulation environment is called Simulink .\n\nMathWorks have produced a number of videos on uses of MATLAB in medicine :\n\nhttps://uk.mathworks.com/videos/medical-imaging-workflows-with-matlab-81850.html\n\nUser stories related to medical applications:\n\nLund University Develops an Artificial Neural Network for Matching Heart Transplant Donors with Recipients\n\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Improves MRI Accuracy\n\nCochlear Ltd. Streamlines Development of Cochlear Implant Sound Processing Algorithms\n\nHow to install MATLAB: Installation detail\n\nTraining and Support materials : Resources"
