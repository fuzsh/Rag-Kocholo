        "text": "The main difference between MATLAB and Python is that Python is a general-purpose programming language, while MATLAB is a computing platform that is used for engineering and scientific applications.\n\nWhat Is Python?\n\nPython is a general-purpose programming language with an extensive collection of libraries that are used for a wide range of applications, including web development, enterprise application development, and data science.\n\nWhat Is MATLAB?\n\nMATLAB is a computing platform that is used for engineering and scientific applications like data analysis, signal and image processing, control systems, wireless communications, and robotics. MATLAB includes a programming language, interactive apps, highly specialized libraries for engineering applications, and tools for automatically generating embedded code. MATLAB is also the foundation for Simulink, a block diagram environment for simulating complex multi-domain systems.\n\nLanguage Comparison\n\nThe language of Python and MATLAB can be used interactively (a single command at a time) or to develop large-scale applications. Both languages support scripting, procedural and object-oriented programming.\n\nPython has largely replaced Java as the first language for people who want to learn how to program because it is easy to learn and can be used for various programming tasks. MATLAB language is the first (and often only) programming language for many engineers and scientists because the matrix math and array orientation of the language makes it easy to learn and apply to engineering and scientific problem-solving. Apps and other interactive tools automatically generate MATLAB code, further reducing the barrier to entry.\n\nUser Base\n\nBoth Python and MATLAB have large user bases, though the user base for MATLAB is primarily comprised of engineers and scientists. As of May 2022, LinkedIn searches return about 7.6 million Python users and 4.1 million MATLAB users. People who do not work in engineering or science are often surprised to learn how widespread MATLAB is adopted, including:\n\nMillions of users in colleges and universities\n\nThousands of startups\n\nThousands of people at every major company and organization where engineers and scientists work, such as Apple, Google, Airbus, Tesla, and the International Monetary Fund\n\nSupport and Documentation\n\nStack Overflow and similar sites are the primary support mechanism for most Python users. With so many users worldwide, it is easy to find or start a discussion online that can help answer just about any question. Documentation is available via docstrings and individual websites for Python and most libraries."
