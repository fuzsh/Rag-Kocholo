        "text": "History of Programming\n\nThe first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.\n\nHowever, Charles Babbage had already written his first program for the Analytical Engine in 1837.\n\nAlgorithm for the Analytical Engine (1883)\n\nCreated by Ada Lovelace for charles Babbage's Analytical Engine to compute Bernouli numbers. It's considered to be the first computer progrmming language.\n\nAssembly Language (1949)\n\nFirst widely used in the Electronic Delay storage Automatic calculator, assembly language is a type of low-level computer programming langauge that simplifies the language of machine code, the specific instructions needed to tell the computer what to do.\n\nAutocad (1952)\n\nAutocad was a generic term for a family of early computer programming languages. The first was developed by Alick Glennie for the mark 1 computer at the university of Manchester in the U.K.\n\nSome consider autocad to be the first compiled computer programming language, meaning that it can be translated directly into machine code using a program called compiler.\n\nFortran (1957)\n\nA computer programming language created by John Backus for complicated scientific, mathematical and statistical work.\n\nFortran stands for Formula Translation. It is the one of the oldest computer programming languages still used today.\n\nAlgol (1958)\n\nCreated by a Commitee for scientific use. Algol stands for Algorithmic Language. Algol served as a starting point in the development of languages such as Pascal, c, C++ and JAVA.\n\nCOBOL (1959)\n\nCreated by Dr. Grace Murray Hopper as a computer programming language that could run on all brands and types of computers.\n\nCOBOL stands for Common Business Oriented Language. It is used in ATMs, credit card processing, telephone systems, hospital and government computers, automative systems and traffic signals.\n\nLISP (1959)\n\nCreated by John McCarthy of MIT, LISP is still in use.\n\nIt stands for LIST programming language. It was originally created for artificial intelligence research but today can be used in situation where Ruby or Python are used.\n\nBASIC (1964)\n\nDeveloped by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth college so that students who did not have a strong technical or mathematical understanding could still use computers.\n\nIt stands for Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.\n\nPASCAL (1970)\n\nDeveloped by Niklaus wirth. It is easy to learn and was originally created as a tool for teaching computer programming. Pascal was the main language used for software development in Apple's early years.\n\nSmalltalk (1972)\n\nDeveloped by Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and Dan Ingalls at Xerox Palo Alto Research center.\n\nSmalltalk allowed computer programmers to modify code on the fly and also introduced other apsects now present in common computer programming languages including Python, Java and Ruby.\n\nC programming (1972)\n\nDeveloped by Dennis Ritchie at Bell labs, C is considered by many to be the first high-level language.\n\nA high level computer programming language is closer to human language and more removed from the machine code.\n\nSQL (1972)\n\nSQL was developed by Donald D Chamberlin and Raymond F.Boyce at IBM.\n\nSQL stands for structured Query Language. It is used for viewing and changing information that is stored in databases.\n\nMATLAB (1978)\n\nDeveloped by Cleve Moler. MATLAB stands for Matrix Laboratory.\n\nIt is one of the best computer programming languages for writing mathematical programs and is mainly used in mathematics, research and education.\n\nObjective-c (1983)\n\nCreated by Brad COx and TOM LOVE, objective-c is the main computer programming language used when writing software for Mac OS and IOS. Apple operating system.\n\nC++ (1983)\n\nC++ is an extension of c language and was developed by BJarne Stroustrup. It is one of the most widely used languages in the world.\n\nC++ is used in game engines and high performance software like Adobe photoshop.\n\nPERL (1987)\n\nPerl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a scripting language designed for text editing. Its purpose was to make report processing easier.\n\nIt is now widely used for many purposes, including Linux system administration, web development, and network programming.\n\nHaskell (1990)\n\nNamed after Haskell Brooks Curry, an american logician and mathematician. Haskell is called a purely functional computer programming language, which basically means that it is mostly mathematical.\n\nIt is used by many industries, especially those that deal with complicated calculations records and number-crunching.\n\nPython (1991)\n\nDesigned by Guido Van Rassum, Python is easier to read and requires fewer lines of code than many other computer programming languages. It was named after the British comedy group Monty Python.\n\nPopular sites like Instagram use frameworks that are written in Python.\n\nVisual Basic (1991)\n\nDeveloped by Microsoft Visual Basic allows Programmers to choose and change pre-selected chunks of code in a drag and drop fashion through a graphical user interface (GUI)\n\nR (1993)\n\nDeveloped by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentlemanat the university of Aukland, New Zealand. R is named after the first names of the first two authors.\n\nIt is mostly used by statisticians and those performing different types of data analysis.\n\nJAVA (1995)\n\nOriginally called OAK, Java was devloped by sun microsystems. Java is everywhere, from computers to smartphones to parking meters.\n\nPHP (1995)\n\nCreated by Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP is used mostly for web development and is usually run on web servers.\n\nIt originally stood for Personal Home page, as it wsa used by Lerdord to manage his own online information.\n\nIt is now widely used to build websites and blogs.\n\nRuby (1995)\n\nRuby was created by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto, who combined parts of his favorite languages to form a new general-purpose computer programming language that can perform many programming tasks.\n\nIt is popular in web application development.\n\nJavascript (1995)\n\nCreated in just 10 days by Brendan Eich, this language is mostly used to enhance many web browsers interactions.\n\nAlmost every major website uses javascript.\n\nC# (2000)\n\nDeveloped by Microsoft with the goal of combing the computing ability of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic, C# is based on C++ and is similar to Java in many aspects.\n\nScala (2003)\n\nCreated by Martin Odersky. Scala is a computer programming language that combines functional programming langauge that combines functional programming, which is mathematical, with object- oriented programming, which is organized around data that controls access to code.\n\nIts compatibility with Java makes it helpful in Android Development.\n\nGROOVY (2003)\n\nDeveloped by James Strachan and Bob Mc-Whirter, Groovy is derived from Java and improves the productiviy of developers because it is easy to learn and concise.\n\nGO (2009)\n\nGo was developed by Google to address problems that can occur in large software systems.\n\nSWIFT (2014)"
