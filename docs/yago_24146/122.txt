MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a high-performance proprietary programming language, developed in order to carry out numerical calculations.

It was created by Cleve Moler in 1984, and written in C, C++, and Java. MATLAB allows users to manipulate matrices, implement algorithms, and plot functions and data. It can also create user interfaces, and interface with programs written in other languages. It integrates computation, visualisation and programming, modeling, simulation, and prototyping features.

Though MATLAB was primarily intended for numerical computing, it can also be used for symbolic computing.
