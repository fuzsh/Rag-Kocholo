1 INDEX OF THE TROELSTRA ARCHIVE Introduction This index was mainly prepared in 2000 <strong>and</strong> 2001. 1 <strong>The</strong> archive itself was stored at the Mathematical <strong>Institute</strong> of the University of Amsterdam, afterwards (2001) brought to the Rijksarchief in Noord-Holl<strong>and</strong>. <strong>The</strong> length of the archive is circa 2.5 meters. <strong>The</strong> material in the archive has been divided into a number of major categories, distinguished by capitals in the numbering of items, e.g. B (scientific correspondence), C (courses given by Troelstra, seminars <strong>and</strong> colloquia conducted by him), P (all materials relating to his publications) etc. Usually these major categories are again subdivided. <strong>The</strong> description of the contents is not carried out with the same amount of detail <strong>for</strong> each (sub-) category. A lot of material in this index was already set up by A.S. Troelstra himself (especially publications, lectures <strong>and</strong> congresses). P. van Ulsen, Amsterdam, 2001.

Harmsen, gave me the opportunity to complete this index. 2 Data from the postscript file of A.S. Troelstra ( http://turing.wins.uva.nl/~anne/) . See also A.S.
