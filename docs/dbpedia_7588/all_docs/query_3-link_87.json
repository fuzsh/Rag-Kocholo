Is it that they are stupid silly thinking volume and mass are the same. For AP needs to prove decisively, if Water is really H4O or H2O. And of course, this experiment would destroy the Standard Model-- that post-diction theory of physics that never gave a single prediction in all of its tenure.\n\nOr is it because they cannot admit the truth of math geometry that slant cut of cone is oval, not ellipse for you need the symmetry of slant cut of cylinder to yield a ellipse.\n\nTexas A&M physics dept\n\nArtem Abanov, Tom Adair, Girish Agarwal, Glenn Agnolet, Alexey Akimov, Roland Allen, Meigan Aronson, Bill Bassichis, Katrin Becker, Melanie Becker, Alexey Belyanin, Siu Ah Chin, Gregory Christian, Darren DePoy, Steven Dierker, Nelson Duller, Bhaskar Dutta, Ricardo Eusebi, Alexander Finkelstein, Lewis Ford, Rainer Fries, Ed Fry, Carl Gagliardi, John Hardy, Philip Hemmer, Dudley Herschbach, Jeremy Holt, Teruki Kamon, Helmut G.

And this means the start of the complete downfall and throwing out the sick Standard Model of Physics, for it is such an insane theory that it cannot get passed the idea of its subatomic particles as stick and ball, with no job, no function, no task. The Standard Model of Physics, is crazy insane physics for it is all postdiction, never prediction. The idea that the hydrogen atom is H2 not H, is because of the prediction of Atom Totality Theory where a atom is a proton torus with muon inside doing the Faraday law and all atoms require at least 1 capacitor. That means the one proton in H2 serves as a neutron to the other proton, storaging the electricity produced by the other proton.\n\n>\n\n> The true Hydrogen Atom is H2 for all atoms need at least one capacitor, and one of the protons in H2 serves as a neutron.\n\n>\n\n> Sad that chemistry and physics throughout the 20th century were too stupid to actually weigh the mass of hydrogen and oxygen in electrolysis, no, the ignorant fools stopped at looking when they saw the volume of hydrogen was twice that of oxygen.

So that when you have Hydrogen without a neutron, there is no way to collect the electricity produced by the Faraday law. Think of it as a automobile engine, you cannot have a engine if there is no crank shaft to collect the energy from the thrusting piston inside the crankcase.\n\n>\n\n> Same thing with an Atom, it needs 3 parts-- muon as bar magnet, proton as torus of coils, and a capacitor to storage the produced electricity. If one of those parts is missing, the entity is a Subatomic particle and not a atom.\n\n>\n\n> So, when we have Hydrogen as a proton with muon inside, it is not a Atom, until it has a neutron, or, has another proton of hydrogen H2, then it is a Atom.\n\n>\n\n> So that H2 is not a molecule but a Atom.

Both guns forcing the water a certain distance.\n\n>\n\n> If AP is correct that light water is really H4O and not H2O as we squirt both guns, where the water lands should be almost the same distance considering H4O is only 4MeV apart from D2O.\n\n>\n\n> If Old Physics and Old Chemistry is correct, then D2O water is 940 + 940 = 1880MeV apart from light water of H2O, and H4O is only 4MeV apart.\n\n>\n\n> So where the squirt gun lands the D2O is a very much shorter distance than a H2O land, but a H4 land distance is nearly the same as the D2O land.\n\n>\n\n> These two experiments are very exciting and would be a very nice confirming evidence to Water Electrolysis actual weighing the mass in atomic mass units.\n\n>\n\n> On Friday, September 1, 2023 at 5:07:13 AM UTC-5, Archimedes Plutonium wrote:\n\n> > Searching the literature today for where biology needs as essential deuterium water.

Heavy Water is not layered in the oceans or lakes or ponds or streams or rivers. Uniformity means that the difference between D2O and H4O is so slight of a difference (only 4MeV, compared to 1880MeV for H2O, that Brownian motion keeps the D2O and H4O in a Uniform Distribution in all bodies of water. I was going through the research literature today and find that scientists discover Uniformity of Distribution of deuterium water. This thus closes the case on Water, for uniformity of distribution of D2O implies that Water is itself H4O and not H2O.\n\n>\n\nMy 250th published book.\n\n>\n\n> TEACHING TRUE CHEMISTRY; H2 is the hydrogen Atom and water is H4O, not H2O// Chemistry\n\n>\n\n> by Archimedes Plutonium (Author) (Amazon's Kindle)\n\n>\n\n> Prologue: This textbook is 1/2 research history and 1/2 factual textbook combined as one textbook. For many of the experiments described here-in have not yet been performed, such as water is really H4O not H2O. Written in a style of history research with date-time markers, and fact telling. And there are no problem sets. This book is intended for 1st year college. Until I include problem sets and exercises, I leave it to the professor and instructor to provide such. And also, chemistry is hugely a laboratory science, even more so than physics, so a first year college student in the lab to test whether Water is really H4O and not H2O is mighty educational.\n\n>\n\n> Preface: This is my 250th book of science, and the first of my textbooks on Teaching True Chemistry. I have completed the Teaching True Physics and the Teaching True Mathematics textbook series. But had not yet started on a Teaching True Chemistry textbook series. What got me started on this project is the fact that no chemistry textbook had the correct formula for water which is actually H4O and not H2O. Leaving the true formula for hydroxyl groups as H2O and not OH. But none of this is possible in Old Chemistry, Old Physics where they had do-nothing subatomic particles that sit around and do nothing or go whizzing around the outside of balls in a nucleus, in a mindless circling. Once every subatomic particle has a job, task, function, then water cannot be H2O but rather H4O. And a hydrogen atom cannot be H alone but is actually H2. H2 is not a molecule of hydrogen but a full fledged Atom, a single atom of hydrogen.\n\n>\n\n> Cover Picture: Sorry for the crude sketch work but chemistry and physics students are going to have to learn to make such sketches in a minute or less. Just as they make Lewis diagrams or ball & stick diagrams. My 4-5 minute sketch-work of the Water molecule H4O plus the subatomic particle H, and the hydrogen atom H2. Showing how one H is a proton torus with muon inside (blue color) doing the Faraday law. Protons are toruses with many windings. Protons are the coils in Faraday law while muons are the bar magnets. Neutrons are the capacitors as parallel plates, the outer skin cover of atoms.\n\n>\n\n> Product details\n\n> • ASIN ‏ : ‎ B0CCLPTBDG\n\n> • Publication date ‏ : ‎ July 21, 2023\n\n> • Language ‏ : ‎ English\n\n> • File size ‏ : ‎ 788 KB\n\n> • Text-to-Speech ‏ : ‎ Enabled\n\n> • Screen Reader ‏ : ‎ Supported\n\n> • Enhanced typesetting ‏ : ‎ Enabled\n\n> • X-Ray ‏ : ‎ Not Enabled\n\n> • Word Wise ‏ : ‎ Enabled\n\n> • Sticky notes ‏ : ‎ On Kindle Scribe\n\n> • Print length ‏ : ‎ 168 pages\n\nTEACHING TRUE LOGIC--Howard Jerome Keisler, Julia F.

This is AP's 5th published book of science.\n\nPreface:\n\nFirst comes Logic-- think straight and clear which many logic and math professors are deaf dumb and blind to, and simply refuse to recognize and fix their errors.\n\nThe single biggest error of Old Logic of Boole and Jevons was their \"AND\" and \"OR\" connectors. They got them mixed up and turned around. For their logic ends up being that of 3 OR 2 = 5 with 3 AND 2 = either 3 or 2 but never 5, when even the local village idiot knows that 3 AND 2 = 5 (addition) with 3 OR 2 = either 3 or 2 (subtraction). The AND connector in Logic stems from the idea, the mechanism involved, that given a series of statements, if just one of those many statements has a true truth value, then the entire string of statements is overall true, and thus AND truth table is truly TTTF and never TFFF. And secondly, their error of the If->Then conditional. I need to make it clear enough to the reader why the true Truth Table of IF --> Then requires a U for unknown or uncertain with a probability outcome for F --> T = U and F --> F = U. Some smart readers would know that the reason for the U is because without the U, Logic has no means of division by 0 which is undefined in mathematics. You cannot have a Logic that is less than mathematics. A logic that is impoverished and cannot do a \"undefined for division by 0 in mathematics\". The true logic must be able to have the fact that division by 0 is undefined. True logic is larger than all of mathematics, and must be able to fetch any piece of mathematics from out of Logic itself. So another word for U is undefined. And this is the crux of why Reductio ad Absurdum cannot be a proof method of mathematics, for a starting falsehood in a mathematics proof can only lead to a probability end conclusion.\n\nMy corrections of Old Logic have a history that dates before 1993, sometime around 1991, I realized the Euclid proof of infinitude of primes was illogical, sadly sadly wrong, in that the newly formed number by \"multiply the lot and add 1\" was necessarily a new prime in the indirect proof method. So that my history of fixing Old Logic starts in 1991, but comes to a synthesis of correcting all four of the connectors of Equal/not, And, Or, If->Then, by 2015.\n\nCover picture: some may complain my covers are less in quality, but I have a good reason for those covers-- I would like covers of math or logic to show the teacher's own handwriting as if he were back in the classroom writing on the blackboard or an overhead projector.\n\nProduct details\n\nFile Size: 773 KB\n\nPrint Length: 72 pages\n\nPublication Date: March 12, 2019\n\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services LLC\n\nLanguage: English\n\nASIN: B07PMB69F5\n\nText-to-Speech: Enabled\n\nX-Ray: Not Enabled\n\nWord Wise: Not Enabled\n\nLending: Enabled\n\nScreen Reader: Supported\n\nEnhanced Typesetting: Enabled\n\nRemember the time the Dan Christensen could not tell the difference between distinct and nondistinct.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 25, 2017 at 10:08:09 AM UTC-6, Peter Percival wrote:\n\n> Dan Christensen wrote:\n\n> > On Wednesday, January 25, 2017 at 9:47:32 AM UTC-5, Archimedes Plutonium wrote:\n\n> >> On Wednesday, January 25, 2017 at 8:27:19 AM UTC-6, Dan Christensen wrote:\n\n> >>> On Wednesday, January 25, 2017 at 9:16:52 AM UTC-5, Archimedes Plutonium wrote:\n\n> >>>> PAGE58, 8-3, True Geometry / correcting axioms, 1by1 tool, angles of logarithmic spiral, conic sections unified regular polyhedra, Leaf-Triangle, Unit Basis Vector\n\n> >>>>\n\n> >>>> The axioms that are in need of fixing is the axiom that between any two points lies a third new point.\n\n> >>>\n\n> >>> The should be \"between and any two DISTINCT points.\"\n\n> >>>\n\n> >>\n\n> >> What a monsterous fool you are\n\n> >>\n\n> >\n\n> > OMG.

Hugh Woodin, John Woods\n\nNow I should include the authors of Logic textbooks for they, more than most, perpetuate and crank the error filled logic, the Horrible Error of 2 OR 1 = 3 with 2 AND 1 = 1, that is forced down the throats of young students, making them cripples of ever thinking straight and clearly.\n\nMany of these authors have passed away but their error filled books are a scourge to modern education\n\nGeorge Boole, William Jevons, Bertrand Russell, Kurt Godel, Rudolf Carnap,\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, Willard Quine, Alfred North Whitehead, Irving Copi, Michael Withey,\n\nPatrick Hurley, Harry J Gensler, David Kelley, Jesse Bollinger, Theodore Sider,\n\nDavid Barker-Plummer, I. C. Robledo, John Nolt, Peter Smith, Stan Baronett, Jim Holt,\n\nVirginia Klenk, David Agler, Susanne K. Langer, Gary M. Hardegree, Raymond M. Smullyan,\n\nJohn Venn, William Gustason, Richmond H. Thomason,\n\nAll of them are clowns of logic, although they have interest in logic, none are past a baby stage understanding of what Logic is. They are all worse than the fool George Boole. All of them are a disgrace to the subject we call Logic. All of them are in the same boat as George Boole-- catching pneumonia and then having his wife douse him in bed with cold freezing water and taking cold showers-- thinking that combatting pneumonia is done by getting colder.\n\nAll of the above listed should never be allowed to teach their nonsense and pollute the minds of youngsters with their crazy 9 OR 5 = 14 with 9 AND 5 = 4, all because a crazy Boole with Jevons in the 1800s thought that OR was TTTF and AND was TFFF. Boole and Jevons had them reversed and turned around backwards, making OR as add and AND as subtract. All because a true logician has more than a microgram brain of Logic in his head, and realizes that if you had a string of statements, say 10 statements and if just one single statement of those ten is true, makes the entire set of 10 to be true also, regardless of the truth value of the other 9 statements. Said in a different manner, if you have a truth of a single statement, and, no matter how you surround that single statement with 9 other statements, regardless of their truth value, because of the truth of the one statement makes the combined all 10 statements have a true value.\n\nThe stupid microgram brain of Boole and Jevons in the subject of Logic (witness their history with pneumonia) is not a Logic at all, for it leads to the incredibly stupid formulation that 3 AND 2 = 1 with 3 OR 2 = 5. Yes, those two logical idiots Boole and Jevons and every idiot of Logic since those two, have thought the truth table of AND was TFFF, when according to a real true logical person-- you need just 1 true statement to make a compound statements as a whole be true. So the true true truth table of AND was TTTF. And this makes sense in the above idiots of Logic with their OR, so confused were those idiots that they combined a \"or\" with an \"and\" and generated a \"inclusive or\" of TTTF. I mean what clowns are these? Who think that OR has to be compounded or a composite of \"and\", with \"or\" forming the idiot idea of an \"inclusive or\" and, not even realizing that you no longer have a primitive-connector. The true truth table of OR is exclusive and is FTTF, which is subtraction in mathematics.\n\nInclusive OR, INCLUSIVE OR, is the invention of an idiot of logic, pure slab of bonehead worthless bonehead of Logic, for the \"inclusive or\" is a village idiot mind that stacks together the OR and the AND all into one idiotic product of Either ,,Or,, Or Both. Not an accident waiting to happen in Logic, a multiple chain collision on the expressway is the Either Or Or Both. It is not a primitive logical Connector that the 4 primitive logic Connectors need to be, no, the Either Or Or Both is already a fool's built compound connector pretending to be primitive connector. A village idiot of the 1800s like George Boole and his compatriot Jevons would not have enough of a logical mind to see that Either Or Or Both is a compound piece of worthless nonsense. Even a 8 year old can see that Either Or Or Both is a compounded piece of crap and has no business of being in Logic primitive connectors.\n\nTo be in Logic, you need a Logical Mind to even do logic, and to come up with a SELF CONTRADICTION in terms like it is updown or it is overeasy-hard, is the same as Inclusive-Or, a term and idea that is a self-contradiction. Logic is about staying away from contradiction. And here, starting with Boole and Jevons, they built their logic on a Contradiction of the inclusive-or. It would be like at the Olympics in the 100 meter dash, at the sound of the gun, a runner, instead of going forwards, goes backwards in running step in the dash, not to the finish line but to oblivion running backwards.\n\nSo, please stop torturing the brains and minds of our young students just because you are a clown of microgram brain of logic. And throw out all the OLD LOGIC textbooks for they are not learning or teaching but brainwashing by polluting moneygrubs, more concerned over money flow than what is the truth of logic.\n\n#1 first comes Logic-- think straight and clear which many math professors are deaf dumb and blind to\n\nMy corrections of Old Logic have a history that dates before 1993, sometime around 1991, I realized the Euclid proof of infinitude of primes was illogical, sadly sadly wrong, in that the newly formed number by \"multiply the lot and add 1\" was necessarily a new prime in the indirect proof method. So that my history of fixing Old Logic starts in 1991, but comes to a synthesis of correcting all four of the connectors of Equal/not, And, Or, If->Then, by 2015.\n\nHistory of AP Logic starts with 1991 and culminates with New Logic that replaces Old Logic by 2015. Old Logic is like comparing a flat earth theory to a true round earth theory.\n\nBefore you do Mathematics, you need to be able to think correctly, straight and clear. Unfortunately schools across the world do not teach proper true Logic. They teach a mish mash gaggle of error filled garbage and call it Logic.\n\nThe 4 connectors of Logic are:\n\n1) Equal (equivalence) plus Not (negation) where the two are combined as one\n\n2) And (conjunction)\n\n3) Or (exclusive or) (disjunction)\n\n4) Implication\n\nNew Logic\n\nEQUAL/NOT table:\n\nT = T = T\n\nT = not F = T\n\nF = not T = T\n\nF = F = T\n\nEquality must start or begin logic because in the other connectors, we\n\ncannot say a result equals something if we do not have equality built\n\nalready. Now to build equality, it is unary in that T=T and F =F. So\n\nwe need another unary connector to make equality a binary. Negation is\n\nthat other connector and when we combine the two we have the above\n\ntable.\n\nEquality combined with Negation allows us to proceed to build the\n\nother three logic connectors.\n\nNow, unfortunately, Logic must start with equality allied with\n\nnegation and in math what this connector as binary connector ends up\n\nbeing-- is multiplication for math. One would think that the first\n\nconnector of Logic that must be covered is the connector that ends up\n\nbeing addition of math, not multiplication. But maybe we can find a\n\nphilosophy-logic answer as to why Logic starts with equal/not and is\n\nmultiplication rather than addition. That explanation is of course the Space in which the Logic operators govern, and the full space is area, so that is multiplication. And we see that in a geometry diagram\n\nT T\n\nT T where all four small squares are T valued making a 4 square\n\nWhile addition is and with a Space like this\n\nT T\n\nT F and we have just 3 of the 4 smaller squares covered by addition.\n\nHere you we have one truth table equal/not whose endresult is 4 trues and now we move on to AND as addition.\n\nNew Logic\n\nAND\n\nT & T = T\n\nT & F = T\n\nF & T = T\n\nF & F = F\n\nAND is ADD in New Logic, and that makes a whole lot of common sense.\n\nAND feels like addition, the joining of parts. And the truth table for\n\nAND should be such that if given one true statement in a series of\n\nstatements then the entire string of statements is true. So if I had P\n\nand Q and S and R, I need only one of those to be true to make the\n\nstring true P & Q & S & R = True if just one statement is true.\n\nThe truth table of AND results in 3 trues and 1 false.\n\nNew Logic\n\nOR(exclusive)\n\nT or T = F\n\nT or F = T\n\nF or T = T\n\nF or F = F\n\nOR is seen as a choice, a pick and choose. So if I had T or T, there\n\nis no choice and so it is False. If I had T or F there is a choice and\n\nso it is true. Again the same for F or T, but when I have F or F,\n\nthere is no choice and so it is false. OR in mathematics, because we\n\npick and discard what is not chosen, that OR is seen as subtraction.\n\nOR is a truth table whose endresult is 2 trues, 2 falses.\n\nNew Logic\n\nIMPLIES (Material Conditional)\n\nIF/THEN\n\nMOVES INTO\n\nT -> T = T\n\nT -> F = F\n\nF -> T = U probability outcome\n\nF -> F = U probability outcome\n\nA truth table that has a variable which is neither T or F, but U for\n\nunknown or a probability outcome. We need this U so that we can do\n\nmath where 0 divided into something is not defined.\n\nNow notice there are four truth tables where the endresult is 4 trues,\n\n3 trues with 1 false, 2 trues with 2 falses and finally a truth table\n\nwith a different variable other than T or F, with variable U. This is\n\nimportant in New Logic that the four primitive connectors, by\n\nprimitive I mean they are independent of one another so that one\n\ncannot be derived by the other three. The four are axioms,\n\nindependent. And the way you can spot that they are independent is\n\nthat if you reverse their values so that 4 trues become 4 falses. For\n\nAND, reversal would be FFFT instead of TTTF. For OR, a reversal would\n\nbe TFFT instead of FTTF.\n\nTo be independent and not derivable by the other three axioms you need\n\na condition of this:\n\nOne Table be 4 of the same\n\nOne Table be 3 of the same\n\nOne Table be 2 of the same\n\nAnd to get division by 0 in mathematics, one table with a unknown variable.\n\nSo, how did Old Logic get it all so wrong so bad? I think the problem\n\nwas that in the 1800s when Logic was being discovered, is that the\n\nbest minds of the time were involved in physics, chemistry, biology\n\nand looked upon philosophy and logic as second rate and that second\n\nrate minds would propose Old Logic. This history would be from Boole\n\n1854 The Laws of Thought, and Jevons textbook of Elementary Lessons on\n\nLogic, 1870. Boole started the Old Logic with the help of Jevons and\n\nfostered the wrong muddleheaded idea that OR was ADD, when it truly is\n\nAND.\n\nNow the way people actually live, is an indicator of how well they\n\nthought and how well any of their ideas should be taken seriously. In\n\nthe case of Boole, he went to class in a downpour rain, why without a\n\nraincoat? And reaching class, instead of changing into dry warm\n\nclothes, stood for hours in front of students, sopping wet and\n\nshivering. Of course he caught pneumonia, but instead of being\n\nsensible, common sense that even a fly would have, he insisted his\n\nwife give him cold showers and make the bed all wet and freezing. Of\n\ncourse, he would die from this. Now, does anyone today, think that a\n\nmind like that has anything to offer Logic or mathematics, is as crazy\n\nas what Boole was.\n\nBut once you have textbooks about Logic, it is difficult to correct a\n\nmistake because of the money making social network wants to make more\n\nmoney, not go around fixing mistakes. So this nightmarish mistakes of\n\nthe truth tables was not seen by Frege, by Russell, by Whitehead, by\n\nCarnap, by Godel, and by 1908 the symbols and terminology of the Old\n\nLogic truth tables were so deeply rooted into Logic, that only a\n\nLogical minded person could ever rescue Logic.\n\n1.1 The \"and\" truth table should be TTTF not what Boole thought TFFF.\n\nOnly an utter gutter mind of logic would think that in a series of\n\nstatements, that AND is true when all statements are true, but to the\n\nwise person-- he realizes that if just one statement is true, the\n\nentire series is true, where we toss aside all the irrelevant and\n\nfalse statements --(much what life itself is-- we pick out the true\n\nones and ignore all the false ones). In fact, in a proof in mathematics, the proof can be full of false and nonsense statements, so long as the proof itself is there and be seen as overall True. For example the proof of SAS in geometry, side angle side, can be packed with false statements and irrelevant statements and still be true.\n\n1.2 The error of \"if-then\" truth table should be TFUU, not that of TFTT\n\n1.3 The error of \"not\" and \"equal\", neither unary, but should be binary\n\n1.4 The error that Reductio Ad Absurdum is a proof method, when it is\n\nmerely probability-truth, not guaranteed\n\n1.5 The error, the \"or\" connector is truth table FTTF, never that of TTTF, for the idea of an inclusive \"or\", --- either A or B or both, is a self contradiction. And funny, how the fathers of Logic-- Boole and Jevons had a connector that was self contradictory, as if the fathers of logic had no logical mind to be doing logic in the first place.\n\n1.6 So that begs the question, what in mathematics has a truth table of TFFF. Well the simple answer is that it is a reverse of TTTF which is AND, and so the former can be got by that of a NOT function on AND. But in isolation, what is a table of TFFF in mathematics? My guess is it is Absolute Value, a form of Absolute Value in mathematics, but that is only a guess. In 2016 I gave a half hearted argument that TFFF was absolute value."
