He wrote one of the first texts on linear logic, and, with Helmut Schwichtenberg, he co-wrote an important book on proof theory.\n\nHe became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976.[2] Troelstra died on 7 March 2019.[3]\n\nNotes\n\nhttp://www.ozsl.uu.nl/MartinLob.html MARTIN LÖB (1921 - 2006)\n\nWeb site: Anne Troelstra. https://web.archive.org/web/20160214194705/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/4881.
