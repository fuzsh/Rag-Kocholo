Rotenburg District is a district (Landkreis) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Stade, Harburg, Heide, Verden, Osterholz and Cuxhaven.

History[]

In medieval times the region was part of the bishoprics of Bremen and Verden. After the Protestant Reformation the bishoprics became secular principalities, colloquially called Bremen-Verden, and finally parts of the Kingdom of Hanover.

The present district was established in 1977 by merging the former districts of Rotenburg and Bremervörde.

Geography[]

The Wümme River runs through the district from east to west. The marshy area to both sides of the river is called the Wümmeniederung (Wümme Depression).

Coat of arms[]

The coat of arms displays:

a lion carrying a cross; the lion was the heraldic animal of Hanover, the cross is symbolising the Prince-Bishopric of Verden

two criss-crossed keys from the arms of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen
