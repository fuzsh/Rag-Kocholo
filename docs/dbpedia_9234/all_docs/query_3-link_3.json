        "text": "Following the Battle of Fornost the army of Arthas Menathil would move northward gathering significant reinforcements from the casualties of the Fornost region and then increasingly more as they moved through the war torn regions of Arnor. The rapidly expanding army of Arthas Menathil carves its way through Arnor, and Priam secretly commands the forces of Austria to do there best to avoid conflict with his army and instead begs for assistance from Karl Franz of whom begins rallying forces with the nearby forces of Slovakia, and Ostmark of whom were already rallying troops.\n\nGalindus Vapnisson would despite his own strong desire to not remain be left behind as the regent of Kosice when his father Edgin Vapnisson and elder brother Volham Vapnisson rallied much of there forces to join the army of Slovakia in resisting the invasion of Arthas, and thus would be within the walls of Kosice when a small splinter force of Arthas Menathil put Kosice under siege.\n\nBattle of Nuln[]\n\nPushed back at great cost from the inner gatehouse leading to the main city, the forces of Arthas would retreat out of Nuln but he left a splinter force behind with commands to kill and burn as much of the taken portion of the city as possible while the majority of the army retreated northward.\n\nMassacre at Fratenjortz[]\n\nMain Article : Siege of Fratenjortz\n\nIt was Janus Frandsen who was still living at his estate when the forces of Arthas Menathil came to Austria and while the main forces marched towards the major cities small splinter forces moved against some of the smaller villages including the villages looked over by Janus Frandsen, and it was here where he would make his power known. While his families home of Fratenjortz was under siege nearby it was Janus that was attacked at his estate by Magnus Fargriever a Liche in the Scourge army, and Magnus attacked directly towards the estate seeing it as the only defensible position in the area and arriving at the walls it was Janus who came to meet him with his guard. At first attempting to force a surrender out of Janus it was Magnus who became overcome with pain and begin to lose control of his skeletal forces as Janus came near him and realizing it was his powers doing this Janus entered his dream world and was able to pull Magnus from the Fade obliterating his soul and leaving him a soulless husk back in reality. With the death of Magnus the force with Magnus collapsed around him and with victory at hand he traveled to the local villages and had them retreat into the forests while he gathered what men he could and traveled towards Fratenjortz. After defeating the Scourge force attacking his land he would travel with his personal forces to Fratenjortz where he would attack the Scourge siege forces while they were attacking the walls and with an attack so unexpected he was able to get into the command structure of the sieging Scourge army and using his pariah gene he would obliterate the entire command structure of the attacking army leaving the skeletons and the entire army to collapse around him and breaking the siege.\n\nRelief of Nuln[]\n\nFollowing his breaking of the siege of Fratenjortz it was Janus that was taken by his sister Aristea Frandsen of whom was now all but ruler of House Frandsen with their father Conrad a sickly old man and she took him alongside much of the army of Fratenjortz towards Nuln where she planned to break the siege there. Arriving at Nuln the main force of Arthas had already left for the north but the remaining Nuln forces were struggling to break the remaining attackers and the forces of Fratenjortz would smash into them and using Janus they targeted the Liches all across the field of battle and were able to shatter the remaining Scourge forces who begin surrendering as they realized the weapon that Janus was.\n\nInvasion of Slovakia[]\n\nMain Article : Arthas Invasion of Slovakia\n\nIt was Wolfram Hertwig III., and his son Wolfram Hertwig IV. that would lead the forces of Slovakia into the defense of the border of Slovakia when it was assailed by a dead army of Arthas moving into their province and the Slovakian forces would split their forces into two with one force led by Wolfram defending Castle Orava while a force led by Edgin Vapnisson would defend Orava Bridge. While these preperations were being made it was Galindus Vapnisson that would despite his own strong desire to not remain be left behind as the regent of Kosice when his father and elder brother rallied much of there forces to join the army of Slovakia in resisting the invasion of Arthas, and thus would be within the walls of Kosice when a small splinter force of Arthas Menathil put Kosice under siege. Gaining victory at the Battle of Castle Orava it was Wolfram who rallied his forces and moved towards Talabheim where the dead army fresh from victory at the Battle of Orava Bridge had put the city under siege, and joined by the forces of Galindus Vapnisson they prepared the army for the Battle of Talabheim. Following the defeat of the force besieging Talabheim it would be Galindus that rallied the broken forces of House Vapnisson following the defeat of his father and brother and led them north where they would fight at the Battle of Middenheim where he would be horrified to discover his brother and father had been reanimated and now fought for Arthas and although he was able to end his brother his father would escape the battle with Arthas.\n\nInvading the Lands of Ulric[]\n\nFollowing the Battle of Nuln and with the city nearly defenseless the movement of Arthas north would finally cause the forces of Middenland and the Ulric worshipers to make a move to truly enter the conflict. The army of Arthas would move directly through the center of Wissenland forcing the Elector Count there in the form of Alberich Anderssen to raise his armies, but not having enough forces ready that quickly he could not engage the skeletal army of Arthas and instead followed it as it moved through central Wissenland and north into Middenland.\n\nChaos Allies[]\n\nAs Arthas and the Scourge made there way into central Middenland it was the fallen titan Elric that met with the scourge leadership and attempted to make an arrangement with them which he hoped would lead to them helping him in releasing Daena from imprisonment. Helgi would travel into Germania at the command of her father following the movement of Arthas into the lands and having with her a group of Valkyrie and several dozen she would arrive in Middenland as Arthas entered the land, and once she had she sensed the summoning of a spell in the area and brought her forces to the location. Coming out of hiding in order to summon demons to the side of Arthas he would be set upon by several Titans who were in the area trying to work against Arthas and fighting a battle against them he realized they were going to beat him and thus he turned on his scourge allies using them as a shield and then escaped back into Drakwald Forest.\n\nBattle of Middenheim[]\n\nMain Article : Battle of Middenheim\n\nThe combined forces of Middenland, Wissenland, and a small force from the Kingdom of Galia would mass outside of the city of Middenheim for the defence of the Ulric capital of which the Arthas army finally seemed intent on a fight as it moved towards the army. Following the defeat of the force besieging Kosice it would be Galindus that rallied the broken forces of House Vapnisson following the defeat of his father and brother and led them north where they would fight at the Battle of Middenheim where he would be horrified to discover his brother and father had been reanimated and now fought for Arthas and although he was able to end his brother his father would escape the battle with Arthas.\n\nBattle of Nunenstein Castle[]\n\nMain Article : Battle of Nunenstein Castle\n\nBattle of Aldorf[]\n\nMain Article : Battle of Aldorf\n\nFollowing the forces of Arthas breaking through the fortress of Nunenstein Castle the army of Bavaria would be marshaled in its entirety and moved itself to Aldorf. While the Bavarians were mobilizing the long awaited reinforcements of Hannover moved into the province arriving west of Aldorf bolstering the defenders, but still paling in comparison to the forces they knew would be arrayed by Arthas Menathil.\n\nThe Aftermath[]\n\nVolham Vapnisson having been found dying on the field by his brother he would die in his brothers arms and then taken back to Kosice where unlike their father he was put to rest in the ground and not raised in undeath like their father Edgin had been by Arthas.\n\nBreaking out of Denmark[]"
