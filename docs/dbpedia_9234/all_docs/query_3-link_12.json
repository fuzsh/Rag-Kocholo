        "text": "The Rotenburg (Wümme) District includes the marshy moorlands of the plains around the Wümme River. Cycling the old mill route, touring the local museums, and experiencing the country lifestyle of dairies, gardens and farms are just a few of the ways to relax and enjoy your stay here.\n\nRotenburg District Map\n\nGiven its proximity to the Lüneburg Heath in the southeast, the resort town of Visselhövede is a perfect location for you to get outdoors. You can bicycle, canoe or ride horses in the vicinity, where heather in bloom paints an idyllic landscape.\n\nRotenburg (Wümme) is the capital of the district, established upon the ruins of a 12th-century castle that was built of red bricks, thus giving the town its “red castle” name. Stroll around the pedestrian zone and admire the local architecture while you are here. Annual festivals, such as the Potato Market in September, bring great crowds to the town, as do local concerts, sporting events and society balls."
