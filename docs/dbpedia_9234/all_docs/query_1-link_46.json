        "text": "Several states in Germany have recorded an increase in citizenship applications after the leftist government in Berlin revised citizenship laws.\n\nAccording to the National Pulse, the changes allow migrants who have lived in Germany for just five years to apply â shortening the old naturalization period that spanned eight years. A three-year option for citizenship can also be availed by those showing supposedly exceptional integration. Moreover, children born in Germany to foreign parents will automatically receive German citizenship if at least one parent has lived legally in Germany for over five years and has permanent residency.\n\nGiven these changes, the Pulse also shared several offices who reported surges in applications. The Berlin Immigration Office (LEA) reported receiving about 4,000 applications in June, averaging 133 per day. But by July 21, the LEA had already processed over 5,000 applications â with an average of around 200 per day.\n\nEven the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior (STMI) reported this surge. According to the STMI, monthly citizenship applications in Germany's Bavaria state surged from an average of over 5,600 from January to May, to over 8,400 in June.\n\nOther states saw similar increases â with Hesse seeing 3,300 naturalization applications in July, up from 2,600 the previous year. Hamburg showed a 76 percent increase, Bremen 41 percent and Schleswig-Holstein 38 percent.\n\n\"These increases come after at least 70,000 Syrians were granted citizenship in Germany last year, out of the total 200,100 people granted a German passport,\" the Pulse noted. Given these changes, it appears that Berlin seeks to change the country's electorate by replacing them with migrants.\n\nGermany has seen migrant crime soar to the point that migrants are suspects in 58.5 percent of violent crimes, despite comprising only 14.6 percent of the population. Aside from this, over 60 percent of welfare recipients have a migration background. (Related: Report: Almost half of welfare recipients in Germany are MIGRANTS.)\n\nOrban: MASS MIGRATION has transformed Germany for the worse\n\nFor Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Germany's issues are a lesson Hungarians could learn from. During an interview with Hungarian radio, he expressed his belief that mass migration has permanently transformed Germany for the worse.\n\nAccording to the Hungarian leader, Germany used to be a shining example in the European continent â but in recent times, that seems to no longer be the case. He pointed to the left-wing government in Berlin \"granting fast-track citizenship, arranging family reunification (chain migration) and whatever else.\"\n\n\"[This] has all kinds of repercussions because now a specific cultural milieu has emerged here in Germany,\" Orban continued. \"It's a colorful, transformed, multicultural world in which the migrants coming in are no longer guests of the country. This is now their country too, and it's increasingly becoming theirs.\"\n\nOrban also urged Hungarians to say \"no\" to a similar transformation of their country. He recounted that when hundreds of thousands of migrants began marching through Hungary in 2015, he decided that he would build a wall and stop them from coming.\n\n\"If you make a mistake in migration policy once, you cannot undo it later. Migration is one of the few areas in which, once you've made a mistake, you can never put it right again.\"\n\nHead over to Migrants.news for similar stories.\n\nWatch Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisting that \"there isn't enough money in the world\" to force his country to let migrants in.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nSen.
