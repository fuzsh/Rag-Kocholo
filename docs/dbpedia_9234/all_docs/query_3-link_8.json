Chaos must be sought and destroyed. Today we take the fight to their homes. Let this be the start of our first White Crusade.\n\n“Chaos must not simply be resisted when they attack us in our homes. Chaos must be sought and destroyed. Today we take the fight to their homes. Let this be the start of our first White Crusade.”\n\n— Roland Dollburg\n\nHaving become completely obsessed with the idea of taking control of the Chaos dominated island of Ostland following his journey there with his uncle it would be Roland Dollburg that would petition his father for control of a force to attack the island. Having secured his fathers support Roland would use his families wealth to gather a force to himself and created an alliance of which he would use to invade the Island of Ostland in a blitz assault which took control of the islands capital and lead to its formation as a principality of the the province of Middenland. After giving a speech to the men he would give command to the captain of the ship to Ernst Bradeul of whom would then signal the other seven ships to follow them as they left the harbor of the river town of Brockel heading north up the Delbe River moving toward the Baltic Sea and their destination of the Island of Ostland. The group of ships stops at the Prussian port of Fronsburg where they would stop only briefly to take on two more ships of whom were led by Roland's sister Ebba Dollburg of whom brought with her a ship full of Ulric Priests from the Brass Keep, while the second ship was led by his half brother Fredrik Url of whom brought another ship of Ulric volunteers and fighters numbering nearly two hundred. The fleet of ships makes its way further of the Delbe River finally passing the Prussian fortress port of Wolgast where upon passing they enter the Baltic Sea and their final days before arriving at Ostland. Sailing the final way to Ostland he talks with his best friend Ottmar Ufferburg and the two discuss how happy they are to be doing something this important, but both talk of their upcoming betrothal with Ottmar excited by his coming marriage, while Roland is saddened that he will have to marry someone he barely knows in the form of Sophia Trugnur instead of falling in love. Roland and his ships would land on the southern end of the island where he would have his men unload this ships into the dense forests making camp and then commanded the ships to be taken back to sea with a skeleton crew in order to further diminish the ability for anyone to see them coming. The Invading army of Roland Dollburg would wait on the island hidden in the southern forests for nearly three weeks waiting for the raiders to leave the island.\n\nBattle of Hesme[]\n\n“Chaos must not simply be resisted when they attack us in our homes. Chaos must be sought and destroyed. Today we take the fight to their homes. Let this be the start of our first White Crusade.”\n\n— Roland Dollburg\n\nMaking Alliances[]\n\n“You can't survive on this island without us.”\n\n— Urgen Nagelburg\n\nAmong these Chiefs he is shown the most support during the meeting by Urgen Nagelburg of whom speaks very harshly about Chaos, and in front of the entire group of Chiefs converts to Ulric leading to most of the other Chiefs converting as well including Drellin Urgenbrog of whom is also very vocal about his support of Roland's Ulric occupation. Following the meeting Urgen Nagelburg hosts a large feast where Roland is sat at Urgen's table sitting beside his daughter Ludwina of whom is very beautiful and the two spend the night talking with Roland forgetting his betrothed almost entirely.\n\nRemaining on Ostland[]\n\nFollowing the capture of Ostland Roland would remain on Ostland where he would become the governor of the region of which had become increasingly the point of much attention in the Imperium of Germania and now a very important and influential man he would found himself as the lord of House Dollburg of Ostland a cadet branch of the larger House Dollburg.\n\nArrival of Sophia[]\n\nSophia Trugnur would arrive in Ostland shortly following the capture of the island by the forces of her betrothed in Roland Dullburg and arriving with a hundred of her fathers men and her cousin Brighard she would have a nice first meeting with her soon to be husband of whom showed his kindness and they shared nice conversations before he assisted her in settling in to her new home.\n\nFamily Members[]"
