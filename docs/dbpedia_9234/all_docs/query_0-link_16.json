        "text": "Migration is a fundamental feature of human experience. This extraordinary collection of essays focuses on a particularly intriguing sequence of migrations: those of Scots during the period 1600-1800. The book first considers the \"near-abroad\" (Ireland), the \"middle-abroad\" (Poland and Lithuania), and the \"far-abroad\" (the Americas), and then details a number of acutely revealing case histories of Scottish communities in Bergen (Norway), Rotterdam and the Maas (the Netherlands), Gothenburg (Sweden), Kedainiai (Lithuania), and Hamburg (Germany). Then, concentrating on the Netherlands, the focus shifts to specific cultural/occupational milieux: exiles (usually for religious reasons), students, and soldiers or sailors. In conclusion, three leading scholars-Lex Heerma van Voss, Solvi Sogner, and Thomas O'Connor-offer wider contextual perspectives that compare the Scottish experience with that of other countries. As Professor T.C. Smout says in his Foreword, \"The present volume is a breakthrough, surely the biggest advance in the field for a hundred years.\"\n\nThis article discusses recent developments in the field of Scottish relations with Europe in the early modern period. It does so in two sections; firstly by pr√©cising some of the important scholarship conducted in this field over the last decade. This has revealed in greater depth the important military, diplomatic and commercial links one small Atlantic nation had with her European neighbours. The second section of the article flags up the biggest single omission in the field of Scottish migration by looking to Scotland's closest neighbour (and the only European country with which she shares a land border), England. It reflects on the few previous endeavours that have contemplated this field; postulates why the field remains largely untilled and concludes with an assessment of where England might fit in comparison to those locations that have benefited from sustained scholarly attention.\n\nThis volume deals with the development, implementation and maintenance of Scottish networks in Northern Europe from c.1600-1746. The book contains nine chapters divided into three parts of original and innovative archival reseach. After an introduction providing a theoretical overview of the subject, the first section focusses on the associations of kith and kin, place and nation and confessional loyalty tested in the numerous case studies throughout the book. Section two provides an analysis of Scottish networks in an economic context providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence to describe their success and failures in a variety of situations and locations. The final section provides three meticulously researched case studies of subversive networks including an espionage network operating in Poland on behalf of Sweden, the confessional network of the irenicist John Durie and rounded off with a review of the Jacobite network stretching across Russia, Sweden, Prussia and Rome.\n\nThe paper explores \"Scottish-Scandinavian relations through the almost entirely untapped medium of visual culture, particularly heraldry and alba amicorum [autograph albums]. [...] The article first examines the use of coat of arms by [northern] Scots abroad, demonstrating their flexible, self-fashioning nature, and then turns to alba amicorum of both Swedes and Scots, interrogating the social and intellectual interactions between the two nations. What emerges in both sections is the protean nature of national or cultural identity: Scots and Swedes shaped and reshaped themselves to respond to a wide variety of situations, sometimes grimly holding on to an ever-more distant foreign past, at other times seamlessly blending in amongst the inhabitants of another part of Europe. The article offers a valuable commentary on the dangers of making sweeping statements about the national or ethnic allegiances of immigrants, as well as opening up exciting new stretches of visual history which have until now remained largely untapped in Scottish-Scandinavian studies\". (This is taken from the introduction to the volume written by Kelsey Jackson Williams and Kathrin Zickermann)."
