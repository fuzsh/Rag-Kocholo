        "text": "Medieval Sourcebook:\n\nOtto I, Emperor: Grant of a Market at Bremen, 965\n\nThe market of Bremen carried with it a right to a mint, and the merchants who went there were under the special care of the king, though the archbishop had jurisdisction over the market.\n\nIn the name of the undivided Trinity. Otto, by divine favor, Emperor Augustus. If we accede to the requests of religious men and women, and of our liberality endow places dedicated to divine worship, we believe that it will undoubtedly bring us eternal reward. Therefore, be it known to all men that for the love of God we have granted the petition of Adaldagus, the reverend archbishop of Hamburg, permitting him to establish a market in the place called Bremen, and granting him jurisdiction, thelony, a mint, and all other rights which our fisc holds there. We also take under our special protection all the merchants who live in that place, granting them the same protection and rights as those who live in other cities under our patronage: and no one shall have any jurisdiction there except the said archbishop, and those to whom he may delegate it. Signed with our hand, and sealed with the impression of our seal. Done on August 10th in the year of the Incarnation 966, etc.\n\nSource.\n\nFrom: Th.
