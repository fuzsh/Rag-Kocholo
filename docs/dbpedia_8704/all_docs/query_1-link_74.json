        "text": "VJ Books Presents Author Mark Lawrence!\n\nMark Lawrence was born January 1, 1968 in Champagne-Urbanan, Illinois, to British parents and moved to the UK at the age of one. He went back to the US after taking a PhD in mathematics at Imperial College to work on a variety of research projects including the 'Star Wars' missile defense program.\n\nSince returning to the UK, he has worked mainly on image processing and decision/reasoning theory. He says he never had any ambition to be a writer so was very surprised when a half-hearted attempt to find an agent turned into a global publishing deal overnight\n\nHis first trilogy, The Broken Empire, has been universally acclaimed as a ground-breaking work of fantasy. The Broken Empire was followed by three more acclaimed trilogies: The Red Queen's War, The Book of the Ancestor, and The Book of the Ice. His newest work, The Book That Wouldn't Burn, begins The Library Trilogy.\n\nLawrence is married, with four children, and lives in Bristol.\n\nMark Lawrence Book List\n\nAuthor's website: www.marklawrence.buzz\n\nSimilar authors: Jim Butcher, Brian McClellan, Brandon Sanderson, Brent Weeks\n\nFollow him on Facebook\n\nFollow him on Twitter\n\nThe Book That Wouldn't Burn\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nThe Girl and the Moon\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nThe Girl and the Mountain\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nThe Girl and the Stars\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nHoly Sister\n\nSigned First UK Edition\n\nHoly Sister\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nMark Lawrence Bibliography\n\nThe Library Trilogy\n\nThe Book That Wouldn't Burn - 2023\n\nJorg Ancrath Trilogy\n\nPrince of Thorns - 2011\n\nThe King of Thorns - 2012\n\nThe Emperor of Thorns - 2013\n\nRed Queen's War Trilogy\n\nPrince of Fools - 2014\n\nThe Liar's Key - 2015\n\nThe Wheel of Osheim - 2016\n\nThe Book of the Ice\n\nThe Girl and the Stars - 2020\n\nThe Girl and the Mountain - 2021\n\nThe Girl and the Moon - 2022\n\nThe Book of the Ancestor Trilogy\n\nRed Sister - 2017\n\nGrey Sister - 2018\n\nHoly Sister - 2019\n\nOther Novels\n\nOne Word Kill - 2019\n\nLimited Wish - 2019\n\nDispel Illusion - 2019\n\nPoetry\n\nStumble\n\nShouting for the Echo\n\nHigh, Cold, Silent, Alone\n\nBlue\n\nSea Song\n\nShort Stories\n\nDuring the Dance\n\nLocked In\n\nDark Tide\n\nCollections\n\nThe Broken Empire - Limited Edition - 2016\n\nGo to top of page"
