        "text": "The writers of some of TVs biggest comedies and dramas,Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, will be at this years Felixstowe Book Festival in conversation with myself, Georgy Jamieson about their work and careers.\n\nMarks and Gran were set to go on a nationwide theatre tour, discussing their career in television, theatre, film, and radio and then Covid hit and the tour, as well as life, was cancelled.\n\nInstead they wrote a kind of memoir, taking six of their biggest hit television shows – Holding the Fort, Shine On Harvey Moon, The New Statesman, Birds of a Feather, Goodnight Sweetheart, Love Hurts – and published the pilot script of each. An essay about how each of these shows came to be accompanied the scripts and was published as the book, Shooting the Pilot.\n\nThe book had astounding reviews and was a great success.\n\nLaurence and Maurice will talk about, scriptwriting, comedy, drama, and a career that nearly wasn’t and only felt completed when they were endowed with the British Academy Writers’ Award for their diverse canon of work."
