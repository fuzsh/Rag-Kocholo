        "text": "“Blokes of a Feather.” Savilians and veteran comedy writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran will talk about some of their most successful – and most political – TV projects, including The New Statesman, which starred Rik Mayall as amoral MP Alan B’Stard, and Mosley, their serial about Britain’s would-be Fascist dictator, part of which was filmed at the Savile.\n\nLaurence Marks and Maurice Gran grew up near each other in North London, but didn’t really become friends until the mid 1960s, when they bumped into each other at Butlin’s -coincidentally they had booked the same week. A few years later, they started writing comedy together, but it wasn’t until Bringing On Back The Good Times that they revisited Butlins in fiction.\n\nThey sent off their early comedy efforts to various tv companies, who returned them with various rejection letters. Then one day they had an amazing stroke of luck. Laurence, a TV journalist at the time, found himself sitting on a train opposite Barry Took, a legendary comedy writer and producer. Eventually Laurence found the courage to strike up a conversation, and told Barry that he and his friend wanted to be comedy writers too. Barry, with characteristic kindness, offered to cast a professional eye over their scripts. He was impressed enough to recommend Laurence and Maurice to the producer of the BBC’s Frankie Howerd Radio Show. Before they knew it, Laurence and Maurice were writing the bulk of the six hour-long episodes.\n\nBut “the boys”, as they quickly became known, didn’t want to write gags and monologues, even for a star of the magnitude of Frankie Howerd. They were huge fans of classic situation comedies such as Porridge, Rising Damp, Dad’s Army and The Good Life, and wanted to try and create series like those.\n\nThey soon got their chance. The pitched a new comedy idea to London Weekend Television; Holding the Fort was about a man who stays at home to look after his baby daughter while his wife returns to her job as an army officer. That sort of role swap was novel in 1979, and the show, starring Patricia Hodge, Peter Davison and Matthew Kelly, was a hit. But it nearly didn’t happen; on the day the pilot was to be recorded, a three-month strike broke out, shutting down ITV. The boys thought their comedy career was over before it had begun. But when the strike ended, LWT’s head of programmes, Michael Grade, ordered six episodes. Lo and Mo (as they were called when they weren’t being called “the boys”) were on their way.\n\nThe pair took the plunge and gave up their day jobs, knowing Holding the Fort would pay the bills for six months. The question was, then what? The answer to that question was Shine On Harvey Moon, the saga of a soldier who returns from the War in 1945 to find his wife, home and job have all gone. The show was a comedy, if a bitter-sweet one. Ken Cranham was irreplaceable as Harvey, Maggie Steed was his sharp-tongued wife Rita, and his daughter was played by up-and-coming Linda Robson. Whatever happened to her?\n\nThe first episode of Harvey Moon was broadcast during a nationwide blizzard. Everyone was trapped indoors, and the programme reached an audience of nearly 17 million, establishing Lo and Mo as the hottest new comedy writing team in the country.\n\nHarvey Moon was followed by a run of hit shows, including The New Statesman, with Rik Mayall as Alan B’Stard; Birds of a Feather, starring Linda Robson, Pauline Quirke, and Lesley Joseph, and Goodnight Sweetheart with Nicholas Lyndhurst. These successes were acknowledged with several awards, including two Baftas and an International Emmy.\n\nBut Laurence and Maurice had always been fans of the theatre, and one day early in the new millennium, a chance meeting, yes, another one, found Laurence seated next to theatrical titan Sir Alan Ayckbourn at an awards dinner. Sir Alan asked whether Laurence and Maurice fancied trying their hand at a stage play? What an opportunity! A year or two later their first play, Playing God, premiered at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, where Sir Alan was artistic director.\n\nSeveral more stage productions followed. Then in 2009 Laurence and Maurice were asked if they’d be interested in writing the book for a new musical, Dreamboats and Petticoats, for Bill Kenwright Ltd. Would they?! Dreamboats and Petticoats was a huge hit and was nominated for an Olivier award. Several more musicals followed, culminating in tonight’s show, Bringing On Back The Good Times, set partly, as you will soon see, at Butlins.\n\nLaurence and Maurice are no longer “boys”, but they’re still working. This spring their two- man show, Blokes Of A Feather, will be touring the country while their new book, Shooting The Pilot, is available from all good book shops, and some bad ones."
