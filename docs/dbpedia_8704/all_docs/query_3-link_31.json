If youâre reading this on a smartphone or a tablet, youâll see the screen is much more responsive to the touch of your fingertips. If youâre reading this on a computer, youâll just leave smudges all over the monitor. Now please enjoy the imaginary conversation below.\n\nLO\n\nSo we're still here then?\n\nMO\n\nApparently.\n\nLO\n\nI thought we were going to take things easier, now that we're old age pensioners?\n\nMO\n\nSo did I.\n\nLO\n\nSo what went right?\n\nMO\n\nWell, for a start we stumbled into musical theatre.\n\nLO\n\nHow did that happen?\n\nMO\n\nYou know how that happened. You were there.\n\nLO\n\nBut the people who visit this site weren't there.\n\nMO\n\nBut it's all on this website, just above this dialogue; under \"credits\", under \"about us\"...\n\nLO\n\nAt least give the poor readers a hint.\n\nMO\n\nOkay. We were introduced to the producers of Dreamboats and Petticoats. Then they asked us to write Save The Last Dance For Me, then we went back to Dreamboats and wrote Dreamboats and Miniskirts.\n\nLO\n\nCurrently touring the nation.\n\nMO\n\nExactly.\n\nLO\n\nAnd what about TV?\n\nMO\n\nWhat about TV?\n\nLO\n\nHow did we suddenly find ourselves responsible for the biggest hit comedy on UK television?\n\nMO\n\nYou were there!\n\nLO\n\nBut the readers...\n\nMO\n\nAll right, all right! Following a successful stage tour with the original cast. Birds of a Feather returned to TV at the beginning of 2014, and the viewing figures surpassed everyone's expectations.\n\nLO\n\nNot mine.\n\nMO\n\nNot mine either.\n\nLO\n\nWe still haven't said anything about radio, non-musical theatre, stamp collecting...\n\nMO\n\nIf we put everything on the homepage, no one will visit the rest of this fantastically sophisticated website. Besides, you don't collect stamps.\n\nLO\n\nI was thinking of starting.\n\nMO\n\nWe haven't got the time, we're too busy.\n\nLO\n\nNot too busy to update this site a bit more frequently?\n\nMO\n\nNo, we've got to do that. Our eager fanbase expect it. Besides which, we're now on Twitter - @marksandgran - so people can expect a constant stream of titbits.\n\nMO\n\nYou have so much to learn."
