My role involves initiatives aimed at preparing our future quantum talent. This includes K-12 initiatives, collaboration with technical colleges to develop programs for technical quantum roles, assistance with universities on quantum research projects and curriculum development, and collaboration with industry partners to establish applicable opportunities for quantum research. Our goal is to ensure that all South Carolinians have opportunities to thrive in this emerging field. What is your motivation behind joining SC Quantum? I joined because of the opportunity to inspire the next generation and be a part of something beyond myself. Quantum is at the cutting edge of innovation. SC Quantum is a chance to ensure that all the residents of South Carolina have access and are not left behind. What is your vision of the future for SC Quantum, South Carolina (and the region)? SC Quantum has become a household name and the community can confidently rely on the team to assist with quantum science initiatives. We also inspire the State of South Carolina to dream of a futuristic future where students have opportunities for career development, entrepreneurship, and relevant education that allows them to have a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n\nüìö The positionality of technology: Intersectionality of Education and Class in Silicon Valley During the month of August, Menna Hendawy, Associate Researcher at the Chair of Urban Design, Technische Universit√§t Berlin, conducted a short-term scientific mission, funded by PWILL, at the University of California at Santa Cruz. She was hosted by Prof. Magy Seif El Nasr. üí° The main idea of the mission was to trace education and socioeconomic class, their intersectionality, and how they impact technology and technological outcomes. Taking an interdisciplinary social and technical approach, this STSM aimed to trace the socioeconomic and educational background of those who produce technological ideas to reveal the (mis)representation of vulnerable populations in engineering. This STSM examined the representation of diverse groups in steering (or not) the advancement of technology in Silicon Valley. üîé Dr. Hendawy investigated what she called the positionality of technology; the ways in which the backgrounds and worldview of technology experts influence their practice and affect the ideas that Silicon Valley produces for the market. To do this, Dr. Hendawy conducted a survey and a workshop with undergraduate students at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), hosted by Prof. Magy Seif El Nasr. With a particular focus on the educational background and socioeconomic class of students at one of the summer courses at the UCSC, the survey aimed to understand how students view their positionality and how it may relate to their future careers as professionals in the tech field. Moreover, input on positionality was provided to the students and afterwards, the students were asked to write down their positionality statements. Broadly, the STSM explored how the different diversity and inclusion efforts in the USA transform Silicon Valley and its disseminated ideas. As Dr. Hendawy notes, she ‚Äústill would like to trace which technology ideas are transferred to Europe and why‚Äù. She would also like to publish a paper illustrating the relevance of the vast literature on positionality to technology companies via incorporating an intersectional feminist approach and proposing a richer and inclusive definition of what can be called ‚Äòsocio-technical‚Äô positionalities. Currently, a report is being prepared to present the survey findings and examples of the shared positionality statements by the students. #pwill #platformeconomy #intersectionality #STSM #silliconvalley\n\nThe International Day of Women and Girls in Science üî¨, celebrated on 11 February, is an opportunity to promote the importance of full and equal access to and participation in science for women and girls. Although Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields are widely regarded as critical to national economies, so far most countries, no matter their level of development, have not achieved gender equality in STEM. Including Australia. Lack of gender equality in science is not just a problem that affects women. It also limits scientific progress and hamstrings a country‚Äôs development. The pursuit of gender equality in science, which includes breaking the glass ceiling in elevation to leadership positions, is not a distant aspiration; rather, it stands well within our reach. To attain it, concerted multistakeholder action in all sectors will be needed to: 1. Dismantle gender stereotypes and biases in science 2. Open educational pathways for girls in science 3. Create workplace environments that attract, retain and advance women scientists DISMANTLING GENDER STEREOTYPES STARTS AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL In Challenging Stereotypes: Cultivating STEM Futures for Girls, Australian Women in STEM Ambassador, Prof. Lisa Harvey Smith, speaks with distinguished psychologist, Dr. Allison Master, about the impact of stereotypes on young children's motivation for STEM. They also share some valuable insights and actionable strategies that we can take to accelerate progress towards equality in STEM and empower students to excel in these subjects. Definitely worth a watch!"
