        "text": "Hit ITV series Birds of a Feather will never return to TV, we can reveal.\n\nThe show’s writer Laurence Marks says he won’t pen any more episodes of the hit comedy.\n\nIt means the Christmas special that aired in 2016 was its last ever outing.\n\nHe told the Daily Star Sunday: “You move on. I can’t imagine what more we could say. Also, the girls are very much older.\n\n“When we created Sharon and Tracey, they were kids in their 20s. They had a whole sexual life in front of them and the show was all about sex. Now they’re women in their 60s, so it’s a different sort of series.”\n\nBirds of a Feather was a big hit with fans during almost three decades on the box.\n\nThey loved seeing the antics of Sharon (Pauline Quirke), Tracey (Linda Robson) and Dorien (Lesley Joseph) in Chigwell, Essex.\n\nLaurence has fond memories of making the show with co-writer Maurice Gran.\n\nHe said: “We couldn’t have imagined we were writing something that would last for 30 years.\n\nIt was a national treasure. People loved Sharon, Tracey and Dorien. And Dorien was a big hit with gay people.\n\n“She became a Judy Garland of television. That was brilliant. We had touched the hearts of people who feel they’re not catered for.\n\n“I have a great deal of affection for Sharon, Tracey and Dorien. They are like friends in my life. We shared a lot of happy memories together.”\n\nThe show aired on the BBC between 1989 and 1998 and was then revived by ITV in 2014.\n\nIt was always a ratings winner that pulled in big viewing figures.\n\nLaurence said: “When it moved to ITV, the first episode on there got 12million viewers. It was the biggest figure they’d had for about 10 years.\n\n“The controller thought there had been a mistake because they were so high. Audiences loved it.”\n\nLaurence’s latest project is book Marks and Gran — Shooting The Pilot."
