        "text": "CLUEDO 2\n\nAlexandra Theatre, Birmingham, Tuesday 23rd July, 2024\n\nA while back, the stage version of Cluedo (based on the film Clue) toured with considerable success. And so, in the spirit of cashing in/giving the audience what it wants, comes this sequel. This time there’s nothing but the board game to inspire it. Thankfully, the show boasts a quality script, written by veteran comedy geniuses, Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran.\n\nThis time we are in the swinging Sixties. It’s still a rambling mansion on a dark and stormy night, and all the colourful characters we expect from the board game are present and correct. It is the home of Rick Black (Liam Horrigan) a fading rock star whose next album could form a comeback. There’s his manager, Colonel Mustard (Jason Durr) – read: Colonel Parker – with a cowboy hat and strong accent. Miss Scarlett (Hannah Boyce) is Black’s interior designer, hired to give the old place a refurb; Mrs Peacock (Kara Alberts-Turner) as Black’s fortune-hunting wife; ‘Professor’ Plum (Edward Howells) is the friend-cum-hanger-on; Reverend Green (Gabriel Paul) a former band member; and Dawn Buckland’s Mrs White the housekeeper… No one is who they pretend to be… And that’s for starters. Add to the mix, Jack Bennett as Wadsworth an actor mistaken for a butler, and other characters: a film director, a police detective and a constable (Tiwai Muza) and the stage is set for secrets to come out, accusations to fly, and the body count to grow and grow…\n\nMarks and Gran pepper their script with lyrics from 60s hits and lashings of innuendo. Mark Bell directs with brio, bringing out the silliness of the entire enterprise. Each actor gives a heightened performance – the characters are even shallower than in an Agatha Christie mystery – but it’s when they act in unison that the show is at its daftest, with choreographed moves and exaggerated reactions. There are some montage action sequences where they all tear around the mansion, moving from room to room and along portrait-lined corridors, that are simply wonderful.\n\nDavid Farley’s set takes the Cluedo board as its starting point, with its ground plan of rooms and corridors. Items of scenery roll on and off, or are brought on by the characters, moved like pieces on a board game.\n\nThe ensemble is excellent, but it’s Dawn Buckland as Mrs White and Jack Bennet as Wadsworth (not a butler!) who give the stand-out performances. Just hilarious.\n\nA hugely entertaining evening of bonkers comedy. It’s a murder-mystery on speed with a touch of Weekend At Bernie’s thrown in.\n\nGet a clue and go and see it.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nThe cast pause for a game of billiards between murders"
