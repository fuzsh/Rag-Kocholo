        "text": "Kirsty Young's castaways this week are the comedy writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran.\n\nThey've been at the rock-face, mining for laughs, for over 40 years and they've given us plenty of gems ... amongst them monologues in the '70s for Frankie Howerd, the era-defining character Alan B'Stard MP, star of The New Statesman, and now the successful revival of their long running and much loved sitcom \"Birds of a Feather\".\n\nGrammar school boys from North London they first met as ten year olds at a youth club, growing up to have 'real jobs' in the civil service and journalism, before finally embarking on the precarious business of making a living from putting words into other people' mouths.\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor."
