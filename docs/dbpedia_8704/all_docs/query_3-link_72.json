He has worked with a wide range of programs, both FEA and CFD and is currently the MD of SSA, one of the world’s leading Simulia resellers. He writes for DEVELOP3D and his interests include biomechanics, motorsport, aviation and engineering in general. DEVELOP3D’s editor, Al Dean, recently tricked him into becoming much too interested in 3D printing, which he thought was impossible."
