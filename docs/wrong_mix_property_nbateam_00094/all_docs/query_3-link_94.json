        "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. , Nov. 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Hudson News, the nation's only national newsstand brand, announces that seven-time NBA All-Star Alonzo Mourning will be signing his new book, \"Resilience: Faith, Focus, Triumph\" at Hudson News, Concourse E, at Miami International Airport on Wednesday, November 26 , from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. This newsstand is Pre-Security.\n\n(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20060705/NYW034LOGO )\n\nThe 256-page hard cover book was published by Random House Publishing in September. It is a powerful and deeply personal account of the author's battle with kidney disease. In 2000, Mourning was on top of the world: He had a lucrative new contract, an Olympic gold medal, and a beautiful family -- all that plus the fame and wealth he had earned playing the game he loved.\n\nBut in September of that year, he was diagnosed with a rare and fatal kidney disease. After finding an organ donor in 2003, Mourning battled his way back to health and the NBA, winning a championship with the Miami Heat in 2006.\n\nYet Mourning believed that the most important and fulfilling part of his life still lay ahead, and he vowed to make his second chance count by dedicating his life to others. Basketball, it turned out, was just the vehicle that would allow him to devote his talents and energies to a greater cause. Mourning is a national spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation and operates Alonzo Mourning Charities, including Zo's Fund for Life.\n\nBeginning Dec. 1 , customers can log onto the Hudson Group website to vote for their favorite book titles of 2008.
