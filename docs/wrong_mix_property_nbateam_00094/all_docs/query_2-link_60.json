        "text": "It was time for a change.\n\nCavaliers coach David Blatt hinted at the move after practice Dec. 18. He finally pulled the plug on the Shawn Marion experiment and started Mike Miller at shooting guard against the Nets on Dec. 19.\n\nIt’s Miller’s first start of the season.\n\nThis is the first time he’s been active since he suffered a concussion in the New York game Dec. 4. He’s missed the previous seven games after going through the NBA’s concussion protocol.\n\n‘Sometimes you just want to shake things up a little bit,’ Blatt said.\n\nMiller, 34, said he’s going to do what the Cavaliers brought him here to do.\n\n‘It’s my job is to go out there and space the floor and make some shots,’ Miller said. ‘Hopefully, I’ll make the other guys’ job easier.’\n\nHe was held out of the Atlanta game Dec. 17 with stiffness in his neck. He’s not sure if it was related to his concussion.\n\n‘I’m sure it had something to do with it,’ Miller said. ‘All I know is I feel better now.’\n\nHe said there are no restrictions to his minutes.\n\nCavs power forward Kevin Love is glad to have Miller back in the lineup.\n\n‘We’re always better at full strength,’ he said. ‘He has size and can spread the floor. He gives us a whole different look and toughness to our team.’\n\nMarion, 36, had started the previous 21 games. His lack of scoring, however, was a detriment to the team. He was averaging just 5.4 points and 3.5 rebounds.\n\n‘We got a great contribution from Shawn,’ Blatt said. ‘Looking at our situation, we had some issues coming off the bench. We are looking for a way to fortify that.’\n\nBlatt said this is not necessarily a Band-aid situation.\n\nMarion will go back to his natural position at small forward and back up LeBron James.\n\nCross off Brewer\n\nThe Timberwolves reportedly dealt swingman Corey Brewer to Houston for two second-round picks and guard Troy Daniels.\n\nThere could be a third team involved, possibly Philadelphia, as Minnesota wants to include center Ronny Turiaf in the deal.\n\nThe Cavs had interest in the 6-9 Brewer, an athletic wing who can defend and run the floor.\n\nShort memory\n\nLike NFL cornerbacks, NBA players must have short-term memories. That’s especially true for those who lose at home by 29 points. The Cavaliers were throttled by the Hawks on Dec. 17.\n\nCornerbacks who get beat on long touchdown passes have to flush that out of their minds in a hurry and line up and play in the next series.\n\n‘In the NBA, you have to have a short-term memory,’ Love said. ‘We play every other day until after Christmas. You have to have an even keel.’\n\nLove said he hasn’t been 100 percent since suffering from flu-like symptoms Dec. 17.\n\n‘I feel OK,’ he said. ‘I’m getting over a little bit of a sickness, but nothing that will prohibit me from performing and playing.’\n\nNon-committal\n\nJames had no reaction when asked about Brooklyn’s slip this season.\n\n‘I have zero time to think about other teams,’ he said. ‘When we play those teams, that’s when I focus on them.’\n\nBack on the sked\n\nTwo of the Cavaliers’ upcoming games will now be nationally televised on NBA TV.\n\nTheir home game vs. Minnesota on Tuesday, Dec. 23, and their game at Atlanta on Tuesday, Dec. 30, were added to NBA TV’s schedule."
