        "text": "Hello slump… like they were saying in recent articles – maybe tonight’s game shouldn’t be so much about beating the Dallas Mavericks but more about getting their rhythmn back as a team. And okay beating the Mavericks.\n\nThis has happen before, or better yet all the time, when we lose a couple of games. The question of the Big 3 and how good they really are together rises. Erick Spoelstra’s coaching abilities and his lack of running effective rotations. Then we have our point guard issue with Mario Chalmers who has beenvery up and down lately. This means other players having to step up for him and his lacking of making shots. I do think we would have this cover if we are only focusing on three pointers – there is Mike Miller, James Jones and Udonis Haslem. Problem here is that Mike Miller is injured, James Jones has little value in the defensive side other than his ocassional charges and Udonis Haslem has been lacking on the jumpshots due to playing with an injured rib (explains a lot). Then we got Shane Battier who seems to be the all around player but this only means he has to be on top of it at all times from here on out – let’s face it that’s not always the case. There have been games where I seriously think Spoelstra should have sat his ass down and put someone in the rotation who COULD make those 3 pointers. Anyways back to the roster then we have the issue of our centers. While we just added Ronny Turiaf as the third string center, there is still a lot to be seen whether he can make a difference. As for me the jury is still out with him and what value he can bring to the team as a center. Center has always been one of our problems even with players like Dexter Pittman and Joel Anthony who just don’t cover all the bases.\n\nUltimately while we need the bench to be at their best, we also need our three star players to be at their best. I can’t stress enough how much we need Chris Bosh to maintain consistency. Not only in making shots and rebounding but on the defensive side – use that big body for something. Then we have Wade whose strides on the court tend to have a short duration – one minute he is on fire and the next his game is mediocre. Then Lebron James. I can’t deny and won’t that he has upped his game to the tenth by taking such a strong position to make things happen in the game when we need him to get us some points. But this is when we need our coach to also come to play, apparently Lebron has been hurt and yet we continue to drain him on the court at moments where we could have sat him down. We need to use him when we need it most or even so if we are on a good streak, we need to be able to utilize other players’ strength and let them fill in. I think we have a whole roster full of talent not just one or two guys – it’s all about good rotations and smart strategies to make the team gel and work effectively.\n\nI am not doubting our Miami Heat can pull it off. We got plenty of games to perfect our skills before the upcoming playoffs. It’s all about making a few minor yet necessary changes to the rotation and spreading the responsibility throughout the roster not just Lebron James. In the Heat we trust … for them to play better, for Spoelstra to coach wisely.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI would say the game against the Philadelphia 76ers was the ugly… in a game where we had a thirty point lead for almost the whole first half the game and then come within a five point lead, there’s a problem. While I love my team, I will say this is one of the moments that showed consistency is a big problem for us. We cannot let our guard down especially with a team like 76ers that despite the disgusting lead we had on them in their own home court they never stopped playing hard. Either that or we got complacent and literally dropped the ball.\n\nThe game against the Phoenix Suns I would say is the bad. Even though we did beat the very talented old timers Steve Nash and Grant Hill, the game showed that when some of our key players like Wade are quiet, it shows. He really has gained the title of the closer – we depend on him a lot to take control and bring the W. Another very noticeable problem we may have here and there is rebounding. Getting those rebounds on both sides is key. It means we get the ball. It means that’s another possessions for us and another chance to get some points on the scoreboard. This is not just the job of the Big 3… this include players on our bench like Haslem and Battier. We also got a chance to see Dexter Pittman be in the starting line up with Joel Anthony sitting down due to an injury. Without him and Mike Miller, the whole bench has some shoes to fill in when it comes to defending (Anthony) and making those 3 point shots (Miller). The obvious player this year who has been getting more rebounds and making more shots in my eyes is definitely Chris Bosh. The man said he knew he had to be more aggressive, that he had to get in the glass more and assume the position of being the center when need be and in my opinion he has. Maybe not to perfection but enough to save us in a couple of games (not speaking about the Bulls game). Again Lebron and Wade cannot do it alone. Like any player they will have off games too. Look at the Chicago Bulls, they annihilated us over there WITHOUT their star player. Still I must give credit where credit is due and that is that Lebron is learning to carry him team when it comes to the nitty gritty moments.\n\nGame against Orlando Magic … the good. Showed that even though this team has been one of the few to beat us twice this season, we can still come back with them. Now the question is, do we only have an advantage when we are at home court? I really hope not. It’s evident that ever since the All Star game we haven’t been playing the same. Is it that the Heat know they got the talent and are just pacing themselves? Ehhh wishful thinking. We got the Pistons tonight and then our biggest contenders from the West and noticeably one of the best teams right now… Oklahoma Thunder.\n\nLet’s hope our Miami Heat has their defense on point and our offense ready to go.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLet’s face it …. game against the Indiana Pacers wasn’t exactly their best performance. Yes they came back in overtime – who can forget Dwyane Wade’s signature pose.. “this is my motherf***king” house!” that had the home crowd going wild. Still it wasn’t an easy breezy win for the Heat. The Pacers have a young team filled with lots of energy and the will to beat the Heat if they hadn’t stepped up their game. With players like Granger and Collison, the Heat’s defense had lots to block. For a majority of the game, the Pacers actually had the lead. To top it off, we lost the injury prone Mike Miller to a sprained ankle. It wasn’t until the end where we manage to pull the rabbit out of the hat and actually get the win. It was definitely a day for the 3’s but that wasn’t exactly the winning recipe in today’s game against the Orlando Magic…\n\n(Ok it was a pretty epic shot…)\n\nThe game against the Orlando Magic was just plain frustrating. While they manage to get a lead halfway through the game they completely lost it during the fourth quarter and all the way into overtime. Wade tried to be the closer today but missed his 3 and it pretty much went downhill in overtime. I have no idea what Spoelstra was thinking in keeping Shane Battier in making hopeless attempts at shooting the ball when he clearly kept missing. At this point if that is the route you are letting your player take then why not put in the player who’s great at making those shots… James Jones?! Granted due to the rotation, it becomes hard to find him a spot but early on in the game he made two important 3 pointers that got the lead rolling for the Heat. At this point, the way we were playing there was no harm in putting him back in. The whole game was just frustrating to watch mainly because we got the ball back so many times but the offense decided they wanted to throw the ball to the net and pray it went in. Plenty of possessions but no game changer. What happen to taking it to the glass? We got the opportunity several times and still they went for the same hopeless shot. Even Lebron James was mediocre and at times unnoticeable. Wade while he tried to be the hero at the last minute in the fourth quarter, he failed. Pity because had he made that shot the game would have been over and we would have won. Chalmers had one of those up and downs game where his fouling just gave the ball back to the Magic who were not having a problem making their shots. We can’t deny that the Orlando Magic played an excellent game. Yes Dwight Howard was a beast with the rebounds and like never before even managed to make some of his free throws (just our luck) but Jameer Nelson was the show stopper. There was barely a time he got the ball and didn’t make the shot. It was a frustrating loss that in my opinion could have been prevented. Was it the rotation? Maybe. I don’t understand how keeping Battier in the game while he kept making some bad attempts at shooting the ball helped. All I know is tomorrow we play the Chicago Bulls and we need to get our game back on track if we want to get another win on the road… soon.\n\nBut hey we get a chance to take another stab at the Orlando Magic in our home court this weekend… Let’s hope Spoelstra has a better rotation up his sleeve this time.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n8 games in a row….\n\nFrom Wizards to Hawks to Bucks (finally) to Pacers to Cavaliers to Magic to Kings and last but not least… our latest “pretender” the Knicks. After that first loss on the road against the Orlando Magic, it’s almost as if the team did a 180 and became the kind of team who started to show off their true talents.\n\nNot only did we come back full force from that loss but we are starting to gain the kind of consistency that can take us a long way when it comes to the playoffs. We definitely got our payback against Dwight Howard and his Magic this past Sunday when our defense overcame their team by blocking any chance at a win. Our defense is just getting more and more aggressive on the court – and I know the following player does not get enough praise but HELLO CHRIS BOSH! I really believe his value has just gone up more and more this year with the improvement he has made on the defensive side, getting more rebounds and attacking the rim. While the big 3 are on the full force (Lebron is letting his MVP-ness come out), our bench is on a roll too. We cannot deny that players like Shane Battier(great player on both sides of the court), Udonis Haslem (ultimate rebounder), Norris Cole (Wade in the making), Joel Anthony (the blocker) and of course Mario Chalmers have all become great assets to the team. Running the plays better and knowing when to hand the ball over to one of the big guys, they are the guys who provide all the little details in the game that result in great wins. Yes Lebron James and Dwyane Wade have an amazing energy when they are both playing good, it was evident today during the New York Knicks game. Keeping the defense and offense all through the game, if one didn’t make the shot, the other was right behind him dunking the ball. While we have always had this ongoing rivalry with the Knicks, the Heat manage to crush them today in a very classy way – no talk, all walk. There was so much hype circling the Knicks rookie point guard Jeremy Lin – they thought Lin plus Melo plus Stoudemire and they’re set. Wrong. Granted I will say that Amare Stoudemire made a sick block during the game but other than a couple of good shots from Smith – the Knicks are still lacking in defense. I think they have a long way to go before opposing any kind of real threat to the Heat.\n\nDespite our great wins, the truth is – it’s all about the playoffs. Yet there is no doubt about it that the Heat’s game is getting better as the season is progressing by beating everyone of the last 8 teams with 12 points or more. We are number one on the East side and one of the few teams to have six players going to the All Star game in Orlando. I say we are doing pretty good and will continue our streak if we keep playing this way. It’s a good time to be a Heat fan – not to mention … great bragging rights.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTic Tac Toe … three in a row. The Heat got their fire back after that pitiful loss with Milwaukee Bucks by holding a team meeting and getting their head back in the game. Whatever strategy, pep talk or just a “wake the eff up” moment they had to go through might have just worked. It started with a second game against the Philadelphia 76ers where let’s face it was Wade’s playground. Of course he had his best friend, Lebron, right behind him scoring 19 points but it was an amazing game for the captain of the Heat from start to finish. The best part is that it was a great performance from both the defense and offensive side – players like Chris Bosh, Mike Miller, Mario Chalmers and Norris Cole were on their A game.\n\nStill and just because I do love my team … I think the game against the Toronto Raptors should have been a blow out. Okay better yet that game should have served as a practice for what’s to come. If anything it was a reminder that in this season there is no letting your guard down… there was a point where the Raptors had a nice little run going. As a Heat fan this was frustrating to watch up close and personal because we seriously have an amazing team with a bench that has been efficient this year. We should be able to maintain a lead especially against the low ranking teams. Fortunately we got our stride back towards the last few minutes of the games. Thank God we didn’t have to deal with the Canadians taunting us… sorry but Raptor fans but you can only “Blame Canada”.\n\nGame against Cavaliers… loved it. I mean that’s something we need to see more. Yes the first and second quarter was a little slow as far as the offense not putting enough points on the scoreboard but come second half it was like the Heat team erupted. The bench came alive and contributed to a great win. All the big 3 were showing why they are great together… Chris Bosh had a crazy “in your face” dunk, Lebron was taking it to the glass the whole time and I think Wade even had his like five thousand field goal. My favorite play had to be when Lebron fed an amazing alley-oop to none other than one of my favorite players, Udonis Haslem. UD is another one who has gotten a few critics on his back about missing his jumpshots but today he shut them up by showing he still has it. He was definitely on point the whole fourth quarter getting those rebounds and making those shots all while running on the court with his signature pose – chewing his mouthpiece (got to love our Miami boy). Best of all was that dunk by Wade, he went right through the three of the Cavaliers and went straight for the net. Seriously amazing.\n\nOn another note, seems like Harris is officially part of the Heat team being officially signed which I think will be an awesome addition to the defense (bye bye Gladness). It’s just a matter now of knowing which rotation to use. We have so many options… look at players like James Jones who is great with those jump shots and getting those charges but it has come to a point where I am sure Spoelstra just has no idea where to fit him in.\n\nWhatever the case may be… we are about to have some tough on the road games coming up starting against the Orlando Magic which is bound to be a good one to bite our nails to.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
