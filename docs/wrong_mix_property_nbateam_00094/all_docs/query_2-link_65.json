        "text": "Does Penny Hardaway have a team capable of returning to the NCAA Tournament and getting the program back on track? We asked five of the most reputable national college basketball analysts for their opinions on the matter.\n\nNow that it looks like the Memphis Tigers roster is set for 2024-25, John Martin ranks the best core lineups of the Penny Hardaway era.\n\nParth Upadhyaya and John Martin discuss Memphis basketball’s ongoing search for a wing, Caleb Mills’ pursuit of an eligibility waiver, the Tigers’ decision to hire Ed Scott as their new AD and more.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that Penny Hardaway is done adding to his roster, but it’s fair to wonder if there’s anyone he could bring in at this stage of the year that would make significant contributions next season.\n\nFour candidates are expected to interview for the Memphis Tigers vacant AD position. The winning candidate who’s hired could be announced as soon as the end of the month.\n\nFor the Tigers, there’s still one big void to fill, and that’s the one that David Jones left when he opted to keep his name in the NBA Draft. Who could that be, and what dominoes does Penny Hardaway need to fall for it to be a reality?\n\nIt’s a blow because of the timing, but the Tigers should have enough going for them to recover with what’s still left in the portal after the NBA Draft deadline.\n\nIt should be a redemption year for the Memphis sports scene as a whole in 2024. But if you’re asking which team is most likely to lead the way, the answer is Memphis football.\n\nRyan Silverfield took some time with The Daily Memphian to discuss his program’s momentum and the outlook for this season and beyond.\n\nSpring is in the air, and things are busy over at the University of Memphis. Penny Hardaway still has some pieces to add, and the Tigers need a new athletic director.\n\nMike Miller believes Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant will show the world he’s a top five NBA player, the former Grizz-turned-NBA agent said in the wake of Morant hiring Miller and his agency to represent him.\n\nRelated story:\n\nJa Morant names Mike Miller as his new agent\n\nPenny Hardaway has added two former AAC players in this portal transfer period and he has two more AAC players that may choose Memphis.\n\nRelated story:\n\nMemphis Tigers basketball: 2024 transfer portal tracker\n\nIf history is any guide, John Calipari will arrive in Fayetteville motivated to prove his detractors wrong and to win at an elite level.\n\nRelated story:\n\nReports: Kentucky coach John Calipari talking with Arkansas about open job\n\nPJ Haggerty’s commitment is a sensational start to what will amount to a second straight busy offseason for Hardaway.\n\n“If you’re wondering what Hardaway needs to get the program back on track, he could do worse than looking across campus at the football team.”\n\nMemphis beating Clemson in December doesn’t mean that the U of M belonged in the Elite Eight. That’s not the point. It’s that Clemson’s run in the NCAA Tournament highlights the importance for Penny Hardaway of just gaining entry into the thing.\n\nFormer conference rival Houston and its coach Kelvin Sampson were back in Memphis over the weekend displaying what it takes to have a successful college basketball program.\n\nRelated story:\n\nTigers Basketball Insider: Teams that danced at FedExForum provide reminder for Memphis\n\nAfter having covered every part of the Hardaway era, John Martin offers three suggestions to help Penny Hardaway get the Tigers back to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIt’s pretty simple. If Memphis wants to make the NCAA Tournament, the only path is winning four games in four days in the AAC Tournament. That, of course, is something they’ve never done.\n\nIn the midst of a season that went from shine to, well, you know what, in the span of a week, it is indeed time to start asking if the inverse is happening as we enter March.\n\nWouldn’t it be nice if the Tigers went into conference tournament week on a winning streak continuing Thursday at East Carolina? Wouldn’t it feel like all things are possible? This season can be salvaged."
