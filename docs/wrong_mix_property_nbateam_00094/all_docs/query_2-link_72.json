        "text": "ABOUT MIKE MILLER\n\nAND FLORIDA BACKROADS TRAVEL\n\nUpdated January 31, 2021\n\nI created Florida Back Roads Travel to give me a way to share my extensive knowledge of Florida, especially my travels in those less developed regions we call Old Florida.\n\nI have lived in Florida since 1960, moving down here to join the U.S. Navy after three years of college at the University of Wisconsin. While there I played on the basketball team and studied English literature.\n\nAfter my Navy hitch ended, I attended the University of Florida and graduated as a civil engineer. I spent my entire career working as an engineer on projects in Florida.\n\nProjects I've worked on include Walt Disney World, EPCOT, Universal Studios and hundreds of other major developments from Pensacola to Key West.\n\nDuring my engineering career I developed a love and understanding of Old Florida that is reflected in the pages of this website.\n\nFrom the very beginning I had the privilege of traveling all over the state on business and pleasure. My nature is to avoid the main highways and get from Point A to Point B on the less traveled paths.\n\nMy love for those places I discovered on the back roads led me to the idea of this website.\n\nIn addition to those back road jaunts, I have lived in Pensacola, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Tampa, Orlando, Winter Park, Melbourne, Merritt Island, Indialantic, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton, Jupiter, Key Biscayne, Naples and Mount Dora.\n\nI also became very interested in Florida history. I am a member of The Florida Historical Society, and have belonged to many of the local historical groups in places I've lived.\n\nThe website has information on several hundred towns and attractions, including a bit of their history. I look for interesting restaurants and lodging opportunities in the quieter areas of Florida.\n\nYou will also find dozens of maps describing day trips in all of the major regions of Florida. The website has hundreds of informative articles on wineries, museums, state parks and other attractions around the state.\n\nIt also has listings of major Florida annual events, art festivals and craft shows.\n\nRead my review of the system that helped me build this website:\n\nSolo Build It Review\n\nRead my resume as a professional engineer at:\n\nD Michael Miller, P.E.\n\nMY VIDEO INTERVIEW BY SBI! IN 2020."
