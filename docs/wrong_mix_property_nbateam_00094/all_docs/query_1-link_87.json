        "text": "In the latest episode of The OGs podcast, the ‘OG’ Miami Heat duo of Udonis Haslem and Mike Miller was joined by one of their favorite head coaches, Billy Donovan. The Chicago Bulls head coach was initially the coach of Haslem and Miller at the University of Florida, and this helped them to reminisce about the best moments back at college. Miller, who is one of the famous “white boys” in the NBA, did not have a very smooth start at his camp back in Florida with Haslem. Well, there was just one reason for it!\n\nHe broke one of Haslem’s ‘Old school pickup rules’, which would be “NO DUNKING”. Miller shared about Haslem, “I had no idea what he was about and I almost wanted to reconsider my options of going there after the first time we played. We played pick up.” Haslem chimed in, “He tried to dunk on me in practice”. Miller had just got on campus and he tried to dunk on the 3-time champion. Well, that got Haslem furious. Miller questioned, “What happened? You almost tried to kill me”.\n\nThe 43-year-old once again went, “No dunking! In old school, no dunking. You remember the old school pick-up rules, you don’t let nobody dunk on you, man.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThat was indeed a rough start for the two there. However, the above duo went on to create some historic moments later in their career.\n\nUdonis Haslem’s unique “white boy” appreciation for Mike Miller\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBefore playing for the Florida Gators, Haslem had met Miller in an AAU camp. The Miami Heat legend shared, “I saw this one white boy…I said, ‘What the hell?’. I have heard about these kind of white boys, I have never seen one”. He continued, “Man, he was bringing it up the court…He was rebounding, he was making plays, he was posting up, he was shooting 3s. I came back home, and I was like, ‘Man, that white boy out there was so cold, I ain’t seen nothing like this.‘\n\nThat sums up how good Miller was. Later in the NBA, the Florida duo shared the court again at the Heat, where they won two consecutive championships alongside LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in 2012 and 2013.\n\nRead more: Miami Heat President Details Why Udonis Haslem is Critical for Their Team\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThough there was a clash of egos between the two, it only turned sweet after they decided to wear the same jersey more than once in their careers.
