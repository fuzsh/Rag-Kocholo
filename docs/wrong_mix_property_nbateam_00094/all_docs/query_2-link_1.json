        "text": "Ja Morant has hired Mike Miller of Lift Sports Management as his new representation. Miller also represents Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr.\n\nSource: RealGM\n\nMore on this storyline\n\nClutchPoints: Paolo Banchero has just become the 2nd-youngest player (21 years-165 days) in NBA History to begin his playoff career with 3 straight 20+ point games üî• The only player he trails? LeBron James (21 years-119 days). pic.twitter.com/ljBzwoLJ8t -via Twitter @ClutchPointsApp / April 25, 2024\n\nHe nods and goes back to the line, sinking as many as he deems necessary before a slight satisfaction creeps across his face. I can see the contours of what he keeps hidden. The deep yearning and desire, the self-driven adherence to his chase for greatness. The moment he has craved his entire life is finally here, and he is determined for the world to remember his name. Basketball, Banchero says, is his singular motivation, his lone fascination that's won over his time and fed his mind. \"Obviously, this all comes with a lot of pressure,\" Banchero tells me on the practice court in late March. \"But, I don't look at it like it's all on me. ... I just look at it as I got the opportunity to help get the Magic back to where they want to be and I'm going to do whatever it takes to get us there.\" -via ESPN / April 25, 2024\n\n\"I just know how hard I work,\" he says. \"I wouldn't be acting like this, I wouldn't get upset or be a perfectionist if I didn't work as hard as I do, and spend as much time as I do just studying the game, watching the game, thinking about the game. \"At this point in the season, it's not worth it. We don't have time for it. In the position I'm in, I can't be the guy who's letting everything get to him.\" -via ESPN / April 25, 2024\n\nLIFT Sports: stay on dat side ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è @Ja Morant -via Twitter / April 25, 2024"
