        "text": "A new unauthorized biography alleges former Alaska governor Sarah Palin had a one-night-stand in 1987 with basketball star Glen Rice, who went on to play for the Miami Heat.\n\nJoe McGinniss' book \"The Rogue: Searching for the Real Sarah Palin\" claims Palin -- then Sarah Heath -- met Rice while he was participating in the Great Alaska Shootout tournament as a University of Michigan player and she was covering the event as a sports reporter for local station KTUU, according to a Washington Post blog that cites The National Enquirer.\n\n\"Mr. McGinniss did in 2011 make a phone call to the former N.B.A. basketball player Glen Rice...and prompted him to acknowledge having fond memories of Sarah Heath,\" wrote the New YorkTimes' Janet Maslin in a review of the book published Wednesday.\n\n\"While Mr. Rice avoids specifics and uses the words 'respectful' and 'a sweetheart,' Mr. McGinniss eggs him on with the kind of flagrantly leading question he seems to have habitually asked.\"\n\nIn 1987, Rice was a junior at Michigan and Palin was just out of college. She eloped with high school sweetheart and now-husband Todd a year later, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAfter being picked 4th in the 1989 NBA Draft by the Heat, Rice spent six seasons in Miami. He eventually married now-ex-wife Cristy Rice, who appeared last year on 'The Real Housewives of Miami.\n\nLocal\n\nGlen Rice, who lives in Coral Gables, has not returned requests for comment. Neither Palin nor McGinniss have so far commented on the story, which quickly became a sensation on political and sports blogs.\n\nMcGinniss previously wrote the New York Times bestseller \"The Selling of the President 1968\" as well as several crime novels. The new book is set for release Tuesday."
