        "text": "About the Book\n\nIn this beautiful memoir featuring more than 100 never-before-seen photos from Bob Metelus, who has been documenting Wade's career for more than a decade, the author takes readers inside his fascinating life.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nA long-awaited photographic memoir from basketball superstar Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat, beautifully designed with more than 200 all-new photos from Wade's life on and off the court.\n\nFor more than 15 years, Dwyane Wade has dazzled basketball fans with his on-court artistry and has built his personal brand into one of the most powerful ones in sports. In this beautiful 4-color memoir, featuring more than 200 never-before-seen photos from Bob Metelus, who has been documenting Wade's career for more than a decade, Wade takes readers inside his fascinating life and career.\n\nDwyane moves from Wade's challenging upbringing on the South Side of Chicago through his college career at Marquette, where he went from unheralded recruit to one of college basketball's greatest stars, to his extraordinary years with the Miami Heat, with whom he won three NBA championships and was named an All-Star 13 times. The book is centered on the essential principles that have guided Wade throughout his career: being an exceptional teammate and leader. As Wade details, while talent can make you a star, becoming a champion entails sacrifice: putting the broader team goals before your own ego. Wade has lived this credo, from his days playing alongside Shaq (with whom he won his first championship), to the \"Big 3\" with Lebron and Bosh, up through the 2018-19 season, when he mentored the Heat's promising yet young roster in his final year as a player. Off the court, too, these same values have shaped his private life, helping him be a supportive husband and partner to Gabrielle Union and an exemplary role model for his children.\n\nDwyane is a deep dive into the mind and heart of one of the most compelling basketball players of all time. Coinciding with a documentary about Wade's final NBA season, it is the definitive inside look at the life and career of one of the sport's biggest stars."
