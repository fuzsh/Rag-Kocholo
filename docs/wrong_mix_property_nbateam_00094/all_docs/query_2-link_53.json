        "text": "How one views Mike Miller’s season depends on what was expected.\n\nIf playing time was an expectation, it was always going to be a tough fit. When the Nuggets added Miller just after the start of training camp, the veteran said he’d been given no promises about what his role would be. But, as the season came to a close, Miller was as in-tune with what he wanted as much as ever: More playing time.\n\nDuring the regular season, Miller’s presence was arguably more of an off-court role as a veteran leader than an on-court role. Ask around the league to any of the dozens of teammates he’s had in a 17-year NBA career, and you’ll hear the same thing. He’s one of the best teammates any of them have ever had.\n\nAsk Nuggets coach Michael Malone, and he’ll tell you Miller is one of the most enjoyable players he’s ever coached.\n\n“I knew I’d get a guy with 16 years of experience, a great leader,” Malone said. “His work ethic is legendary.”\n\nMiller was part player, part confidant, part adviser, and part shooting coach. But he provided what the Nuggets needed, namely, a veteran to help younger players carry themselves as professionals.\n\n“I can’t say enough good things about him — on the court, off the court, locker room,” Malone said. “Things that he sees. I trust him. He could easily become a coach in the NBA. He could be a general manager. He could do whatever he wants to.”\n\nMiller played in 47 games and started two. He got only 373 minutes playing time, the least of any season in his career, and averaged 1.3 points and 1.1 rebounds. His 3-point touch was ever present.\n\n“He was one of our better shooters, he was one of our better ball movers,” Malone said. “He has a great IQ and feel for the game offensively and defensively.”\n\nOffense. Miller was involved in only 78 possessions on offense all season. To no one’s surprise, Miller was most used in spot up situations. That happened 48.1 percent of the time, and they were almost all 3-point shots. Also, to no one’s surprise, Miller shot a healthy 36 percent on those attempts. Fifty-two of the 62 shots he took were 3-pointers.\n\nMiller was also one of the Nuggets’ best passers, especially in inbounds situations. Sometimes Malone would put Miller in the game just to make sure the inbounds pass would be executed well out of a timeout.\n\nDefense. Miller was one of the team’s best communicators on defense, but he wasn’t always able to keep up with the action. That’s not unexpected for a 36 year old.\n\nMiller committed 17 turnovers, 11 coming on bad passes, usually forced when he was under pressure.\n\nMiller is a free agent this summer, and the Nuggets have expressed a desire to have him return. He’ll weigh his options.\n\n“My body feels great,” he said. “I still have a passion for basketball, so I’ll be on the court next year. … I’ve always said, if I feel I can help, whether it’s on the court, in the locker room, whatever it is, I’m going to continue to play. It’s the only thing I’ve ever known.”\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nViewing this on a mobile device?
