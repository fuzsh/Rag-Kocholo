        "text": "HELENA — Mike Miller couldn’t help but get choked up recounting decades-old memories from a 33-year coaching career, many made at the Northwest Park facility more than 100 people gathered at Saturday.\n\nMiller’s 30th season at the helm of Capital High softball, one that begins next week, will be his last, but a legacy that includes 388 victories and six state tournament trophies, is destined to remain.\n\nSaturday, in perfect softball weather, Miller and Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins cut a ribbon to dedicate the newly named Mike Miller Fields at Northwest Park.\n\n“You see all the girls and past players who are out here – that is something to behold and something that’s hard for me to even talk about,” Miller said.\n\n“It’s a great honor. I love Capital High softball.”\n\nMiller said he learned of his family’s efforts to rename the fields last August, on his wife’s birthday surrounded by family.\n\n“This has been such a large part of my life being at Capital High,” Miller said.\n\n“I’m sure it’ll mean more and more to me every day as my life goes on.”\n\nTwenty years ago, Miller and countless others turned a dusty parking lot into a proving ground for Capital City softball excellence.\n\nMiller estimates he handled 80 percent of the blocks constructing dugouts and ran down a long list of sponsors, supporters, and volunteers responsible for the fields’ construction in a 20-minute speech Saturday.\n\n“It’s an understatement to say how much work he did on these fields,” Shayla (Schmitz) Barraclough, who, as a player, threw the first pitch at Northwest Park in 2004, said.\n\n“We were here, sun up to sun down, every day picking rocks and digging. We knew these fields would be special and we had a special team that year.”\n\nDivine intervention or just great play, Miller said, produced Capital’s first-ever state trophy – a Class AA championship – in 2004, the first of four title game appearances in a six-year span.\n\nRoughly three dozen former and current players and coaches were in attendance Saturday supporting someone they consider more than a coach, because he thought of them more than just players.\n\n“He cares about every single one of us,” Schmitz said. “To this day, he knows everything that has happened to us as we grew up…\n\n“He keeps in touch with every one of us. We’re more than just players to him, we’re family.”\n\nMiller, a Helena High graduate, first coached Capital’s junior-varsity program in 1992.\n\nHe was elevated to varsity head coach in 1995 and guided every single team since to a state tournament qualification.\n\nMemories, of which Miller just scratched the surface of Saturday, are enough to last a lifetime and cover everything from Cinco de Mayo get-togethers, to softball heart-to-hearts with parents, and many hours hanging out at Buffalo Wild Wings.\n\nReactions of opposing pitcher and coach when Shanna Schmitz “tomahawked” a rise ball over the fence in the 2005 state tournament is another special, lasting memory for Miller.\n\n“When you all come here and I see you, I just think of the times that were so special,” Miller said. “Most important to me are the players. The fact you are here today is overwhelming to me…\n\n“I certainly remember the wins, and especially the championships, but many other times I remember very, very well.”\n\nMiller recalled his nine seniors from 1994 and how he framed their photos in his office.\n\nHow, some 25 years ago, he coached against his wife Lynn and daughter Ashley during crosstown, some of the only times he got to watch her play.\n\nLynn, for the last 20 years, has shared a dugout with Mike.\n\n“We’ve got great players, great kids, great parents,” Miller said. “It’s just time [to retire]. I’ve been here for 33 years. I think it’s time to move on a little bit…\n\n“There’s only been six years of softball in Montana that I wasn’t the coach here. You gotta go sometime. Who knows? Maybe I’ll be back.”\n\nSchmitz’s 20-year-old first pitch resides in Miller’s trophy case, a reminder of a special season and a new facility.\n\nNow, on the field named after who they’re playing for, the Bruins chase Miller’s 400th victory and, to an extent, first state championship since 2009.\n\nCan the ending be just as special as the beginning?\n\n“My time [speaking] today is up,” Miller said Saturday. “My time leading the Capital High softball team is coming to an end. I want to thank you all for making this a very, very special day for me…\n\n“My family – each of you have made the last 33 years a very lasting memory.
