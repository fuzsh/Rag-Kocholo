It will be the book you ll want to read time and time again!\n\nThroughout his basketball career, Chalmers has achieved a tremendous level of success. As a high-school phenom in Alaska, Chalmers was named one of the Top-12 players in the nation, which led to a scholarship at the University of Kansas. At KU, Chalmers hit the now-legendary three-point shot in the title game, which eventually resulted in the Jayhawks winning the 2008 NCAA National Championship. Chalmers moved on to the NBA, winning back-to-back titles with the Miami Heat, and playing for the Memphis Grizzlies.”\n\n-from the cover\n\nHardcover, 40 pages"
