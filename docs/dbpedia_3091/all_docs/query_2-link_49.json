The vessels are meant to replace the current Halifax-class frigate fleet and are to be built for the Royal Canadian Navy at Irving Shipbuilding on the east coast.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

That number could go even higher if the project is further delayed.\n\n“A one-year delay would increase that cost to $79.7 billion, and a two-year delay would see the cost rise to $82.1 billion,” the PBO said.\n\nA significant increase in the weight of the CSC warship was also cited as a factor driving up the cost.\n\nThe CSC program will be the largest single purchase in Canadian history.\n\nGiroux’s report also presented a cost analysis of two other ship designs: the FREMM European multi-mission frigate and the Type 31e, a class of general-purpose frigates planned for the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy. The cost of acquiring 15 FREMM ships is estimated at $71.1 billion, while the cost of a fleet of 15 ships based on the Type 31e design is estimated at $27.5 billion, the PBO said.\n\nThe report also considered the cost of a mixed fleet: three of the Type 26 ships and 12 ships of either of the alternate designs. Under this scenario, the costs increase to $71.9 billion for the mixed FREMM fleet, and $37.5 billion for the mixed Type 31e fleet.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe defence department, however, rejected the PBO’s figures, saying Wednesday that it stands by its claim that the price tag of the CSC project will be between $56 billion and $60 billion. “After reviewing the report, we find that the key differences in our cost estimates can be primarily attributed to the PBO including provincial sales tax and the additional emphasis PBO puts on weight-related costing,” the DND noted in its statement.\n\nCritics of the CSC project say it is out of control financially and there is a lack of proper oversight. There have been calls on the Liberal government to scuttle the project and start over with a less costly warship.\n\nThe Department of National Defence revealed Feb. 1 that the delivery of the first surface combatant ship would be delayed until 2030 or 2031. The first ship was to have been delivered in 2025, according to DND documents.\n\nBut defence officials recently acknowledged they couldn’t say when they found out the CSC project had fallen five years behind schedule. DND acknowledges that while there were indications in early 2020 the project schedule was slipping it doesn’t actually know when it determined that the Canadian Surface Combatant program was facing significant delays.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAlan Williams, the former assistant deputy minister in charge of procurement at DND, says that lack of insight by staff is dangerous. On major equipment procurements, every step should be documented as bureaucrats could be called on to justify future spending decisions and overall management of a project, he added.\n\nHe said the lack of critical information shows the federal government has little accountability or control over the CSC program.\n\nSo far, Canadian taxpayers have spent $739 million on CSC preparing for the eventual construction, according to figures tabled with parliament.\n\nAustralia and the United Kingdom also plan to purchase the Type 26. But the first ship, destined for the UK, has yet to be completed.\n\nBACKGROUND: Billions in trouble: How the crown jewel of Canada’s shipbuilding strategy became a possible financial disaster waiting in the wings\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
