This will create another year delay in completing the project.\n\n\"This is your place to meet with your family. This is a jewel of our community right here and Canada Place will be another jewel,\" said Madigan.\n\nResponsibility for the project will he turned over to the city... but the Heritage Gardeners will retain responsibility for walkway brick sale, purchase, and engraving."
