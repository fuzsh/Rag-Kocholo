        "meta_description": "BACKGROUND: The legalization of medical assistance in dying will affect health care spending in Canada. Our aim was to determine the potential costs and savings associated with the implementation of medical assistance in dying.\n\nMETHODS: Using published data from the Netherlands and Belgium, where medically assisted death is legal, we estimated that medical assistance in dying will account for 1%–4% of all deaths; 80% of patients will have cancer; 50% of patients will be aged 60–80 years; 55% will be men; 60% of patients will have their lives shortened by 1 month; and 40% of patients will have their lives shortened by 1 week. We combined current mortality data for the Canadian population with recent end-of-life cost data to calculate a predicted range of savings associated with the implementation of medical assistance in dying. We also estimated the direct costs associated with offering medically assisted death, including physician consultations and drug costs.\n\nRESULTS: Medical assistance in dying could reduce annual health care spending across Canada by between $34.7 million and $138.8 million, exceeding the $1.5–$14.8 million in direct costs associated with its implementation. In sensitivity analyses, we noted that even if the potential savings are overestimated and costs underestimated, the implementation of mdedical assistance in dying will likely remain at least cost neutral.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Providing medical assistance in dying in Canada should not result in any excess financial burden to the health care system, and could result in substantial savings. Additional data on patients who choose medical assistance in dying in Canada should be collected to enable more precise estimates of the impact of medically assisted death on health care spending and to enable further economic evaluation.",

        "text": "Proportion of deaths due to medical assistance in dying and patient demographics\n\nBetween 1990 and 2012, medical assistance in dying accounted for an estimated 1.8%–3.3% of total deaths in the Netherlands, with a trend for an increase in rates over the last 25 years.6,7 In Belgium, medical assistance in dying has accounted for between 0.3% and 4.6% of all deaths, with the highest rates documented in the most recent 2013 survey.8,9 Based on these numbers, we estimated that medical assistance in dying will eventually play a role in 1%–4% of all deaths in Canada.\n\nSeveral individual studies, in addition to a recent systematic review, have shown that medical assistance in dying is most commonly chosen by men, by patients in their 7th and 8th decade of life and by patients with cancer.6,10,11 Based on these previous data, we assumed that 55% of patients choosing the intervention will be male, that 50% of patients will be aged 60–79 years, 30% will be aged 18–59 years and 20% will be 80 years and older, and that 80% of patients will have cancer.\n\nCost of end-of-life care\n\nWith the collaboration of the authors (and after ethics approval), previously published costing data from the province of Ontario3 were reanalyzed into the relevant subgroups for our model. Briefly, total health care costs for all decedents in Ontario between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2013 (n = 264 755), were measured using administrative data. These costs were calculated at an individual patient level on a cumulative daily basis, which allowed for weekly and monthly costs preceding death to be determined. Costs included those associated with acute care (emergency department visits and hospital admissions), outpatient care (physician billing, outpatient clinics [including dialysis and cancer care], laboratory services and select drug or device expenses) and continuing care (long-term care, complex continuing care, rehabilitation and home care). Additional details are available in the original publication.3\n\nWe excluded deaths from “external causes” (accident, poisoning, assault, drowning, and complications of medical care, as defined by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision [ICD-10], codes). Patients were considered to have cancer if they had 1 hospital admission with a discharge diagnosis or 2 outpatient visits with an ICD-10 billing code of neoplasm in their final 2 years of life. We created subgroups according to sex and age, as defined previously, and calculated the average total cost of health care use in the final month and final week of life for each subgroup.\n\nEstimating potential savings associated with medical assistance in dying\n\nWe assumed 268 056 total deaths annually in Canada based on Statistics Canada figures for the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015.12 We ran 4 iterations of our model in which medical assistance in dying accounted for 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% of total deaths. We used the total number of cases to derive the number of patients in each subgroup using the assumptions described previously.\n\nWe then multiplied the number of cases in each subgroup by the mean total cost of either the final week or final month of life associated with that subgroup. We combined the total cost associated with each subgroup to estimate the potential cost savings in a given year associated with medical assistance in dying.\n\nEffect on costs with the assumption that patients selected palliative care\n\nOur base-case model uses mean costs for all decedent subgroups, which can be interpreted as the cost associated with standard end-of-life care across a variety of scenarios and patient wishes. It is possible that patients who request medical assistance in dying would choose a less aggressive palliative care approach. Because a previous review suggested that palliative care reduces end-of-life health care costs by 40%–70% compared with standard care,13 we conducted 2 additional analyses in which we reduced the cost of care preceding death by 40% and 70%.\n\nAdditional sensitivity analyses\n\nWe conducted additional sensitivity analyses using our base-case analysis (assuming 1% of decedents select medical assistance in dying) varying our assumptions regarding sex, age group, cancer status and effect on life expectancy. The variations we modelled included 30%–70% of cases involving male patients, 50%–100% of cases involving cancer patients, equal division of cases among the 3 age groups, and plausible variations in the proportion of patients who may have their life expectancy reduced by 1 month as opposed to 1 week.\n\nEstimating the costs associated with implementing medical assistance in dying\n\nThere is no standardized approach to medical assistance in dying yet in Canada, and each case will have unique patient and provider elements, which makes estimating the costs associated with this service difficult. Acknowledging this, we estimated the direct costs of offering medical assistance in dying within a fee-for-service setting, understanding that there will have to be 2 independent assessments for patient eligibility,14 and that medications chosen by the physician involved will be administered at a separate visit after being prepared by a pharmacy. Therefore, each case will include at least 2 physician claims for a consultation, 1 claim for a follow-up visit where the medication is administered, the cost of the drugs in addition to pharmacy preparation time and 1 claim for completion of the death certificate. To keep costs consistent and comparable with our end-of-life costing analysis, we used Ontario physician fees in our calculations.15 Although there is no standard drug regimen for medical assistance in dying across Canada, we had confidential access to the drug regimens suggested in Alberta (including an anxiolytic, local anesthetic, sedative and paralytic), as well as the associated costs. Costs for these alternate regimens varied between $25 and $326 per case. We assumed an additional $30 of pharmacist time (about 30 min of time to prepare and dispense the drugs based on a mean pharmacist wage of $60/h, including benefits16).\n\nWe created 2 base-case scenarios, a low-cost scenario in which the assessments are performed by primary care physicians and the least costly drug regimen is used, and a high-cost scenario in which the assessments are done by specialists and the most costly drug regimen is used (Table 1). In addition, there will be patients who request medical assistance in dying and incur the 2 assessment fees but do not complete the process, either being denied, retracting their request or dying from their disease. In the Netherlands, data from a single centre suggests 25% of requests for medical assistance in dying are ultimately granted,17 whereas this proportion is more than 75% in Belgium.18 We chose a conservative estimate that 33% of requests in Canada will be granted, meaning for every patient receiving medical assistance in dying, we added the cost of 2 additional patients who underwent assessment only.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nWe used comprehensive Canadian-specific cost data, provided a range of potential savings based on projected uptake of medical assistance in dying across the country, used more detailed subgroupings to create case estimates than in a previously published American model,5 and performed extensive sensitivity analyses. We provided a preliminary estimate of the direct costs of medical assistance in dying in Canada, including the costs of requests that are not ultimately granted.\n\nThe main limitation of our model was using data from the Netherlands and Belgium to build our case estimates. In Canada, only competent adults aged 18 years and older whose “natural death has become reasonably foreseeable” will be eligible for medical assistance in dying,14 whereas in the Netherlands and Belgium, there are provisions to allow medical assistance in dying for patients with nonterminal diseases, minors and patients with dementia.19,20 Therefore, we may have overestimated the proportion of total deaths due to medical assistance in dying by using statistics from countries with more liberal policies. We did, however, provide a range of estimates to account for this possibility.\n\nOur cost data were specific to the province of Ontario, and may not represent end-of-life spending in all Canadian provinces. 3 However, these are the most comprehensive data available on end-of-life health care costs in Canada, including costs across a broader range of services (such as outpatient visits and diagnostic investigations) than previous reports.2,4 In addition, these cost data are recent and therefore more likely to reflect current fee schedules and current standards of care at the end-of-life, including new treatments. Finally, the costs were calculated on a daily basis, allowing for the use of weekly and monthly subtotals, which were crucial to our model.\n\nIt should be noted that our estimates regarding the effect of medical assistance in dying on life expectancy were taken from a single physician survey.6 Because our sensitivity analyses found this variable to have a considerable effect on our results, determining how to accurately measure and report this information for Canadian cases will be important for future cost analyses.\n\nOur estimates of the costs associated with offering medical assistance in dying were based on a very simple model, which predominantly used Ontario-level costs for consistency. This analysis should be updated if and when unique billing codes for the consultations and delivery of medical assistance in dying are developed. We did not account for additional potential costs, such as coordination services. In Alberta, there is a medical assistance in dying coordination team with several full-time employees who respond to patient or provider inquiries and assist in liaising patients with willing providers. These are fixed costs, and do not necessarily vary with the number of cases, but could be substantial if every province adopts this approach. Administrative costs associated with creating an oversight body or reporting mechanism, as suggested by the Canadian Medical Association,21 were also not accounted for. Nevertheless, even if these costs were included, it is likely that the implementation of medical assistance in dying would be cost neutral or result in cost savings.\n\nFinally, our analysis is only a cost analysis and it does not consider the clinical effects of medical assistance in dying on patients at the end of life. Patient-level research that explores the reasons why Canadians choose medical assistance in dying, the value they assign to their suffering versus death and other aspects of their experience will need to be done before true economic evaluation of medical assistance in dying in terms of cost-effectiveness and utility can be done."
