        "text": "Food consumption data analysis\n\nData on food consumption in the Canadian population were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 2.2 (Nutrition) 2004, a cross-sectional national survey conducted by Statistics Canada and Health Canada from January 2004-January 2005 [40] which at the time this study was conducted was the most recent national survey of dietary intakes of Canadians available since the Nutrition Canada survey conducted in 1970–1972. Briefly, this survey encompasses a representative sample of individuals residing in private dwellings from the ten Canadian provinces. This survey represents about 98% of individuals living in these provinces and the response rate was 76.5%.\n\nThe 24-hour dietary recall was administered using an automated multi-pass method [41]. In total, 35,107 respondents completed a 24-hour dietary recall; of those respondents, 10,786 completed a second recall 3–10 days later. We eliminated the following records from all analyses: respondents <2 years, those marked as invalid, those where only breast milk was reported to be consumed, and records where no foods were recorded. In total, we included 44,325 24-hour dietary recall records that belonged to 33,932 respondents in our analyses. The Canadian Nutrient File (CNF 2001b) was used to determine the nutrient content of all reported foods.\n\nEating Well with Canada’s Food Guide (CFG) [42] was released in 2007 and outlines a dietary pattern for Canadians ≥2 years to help meet nutrient needs and prevent chronic diseases. Specific recommendations in terms of quantity and quality for four different food groups (Vegetables and Fruit, Grain Products, Milk and Alternatives, Meat and Alternatives) as well as other dietary factors (e.g., fats and oils, water) are outlined for nine different age and sex groups [42]. Because all foods included in our analyses except sugar-sweetened beverages are part of various CFG groups, we quantified the consumption of these foods using CFG servings.\n\nTo quantify the number of CFG servings from the 24-hour dietary recalls, we used the Canada Food Guide file which classifies all included foods in every 24-hour dietary recall according to Health Canada’s validated Canadian Nutrient File/Canada Food Guide (CNF/CFG) tool [43,44]. This tool classifies foods into the four CFG groups as well as into subgroups within those groups (e.g., Vegetables and Fruit subgroup examples: a) fruit other than juice, b) vegetables dark green). In addition, within those subgroups, foods are categorized into tiers based on quantities of fat, sodium, and sugar and adjustments based on other food guide guidance. Foods in Tiers 1–3 are considered to count towards CFG servings, and foods belonging in Tiers 4 are higher in fat, sugars, and/or sodium and are generally not counted towards CFG servings [43]. In addition, the CNF/CFG tool classifies some other foods (e.g., beverages).\n\nA list of all food groups and subgroups included in our analyses are presented in . We included all foods belonging to each of the relevant subgroups with a few exceptions. For red meat, we only included foods from the a) beef, game and organ meats, and b) other meats (pork, veal, lamb) subgroups that met the International Agency for Research on Cancer red meat definition (i.e., meat from the muscle of mammals (e.g., pork, beef, veal, lamb)) [45]. We also excluded fortified soy beverages from the fluid milk and fortified soy-based beverages subgroup, and potatoes and corn from relevant vegetable subgroups [46]. For healthful foods (fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds, milk), we only included foods belonging to Tiers 1–3. For harmful foods (processed meat, red meat), we included foods belonging to Tiers 1–4. For beverages part of the CNF/CFG beverage subgroups, we considered those with ≥50kcal/226.8g to be a SSB [46]. We assumed standard CFG serving sizes for each included food, and that one serving of SSB was 226.8g ( ).\n\nWe assumed that meeting food recommendations in Canada set by government and other reputable organizations were associated with the lowest chronic disease risk. Canada’s Food Guide recommendations were used for whole grains and milk. Because CFG does not contain separate vegetable and fruit recommendations (only a recommendation for vegetables and fruit combined), we estimated these recommendations using the GBD 2015 Theoretical Minimum Risk Exposure (TMRE). We first added the TMRE values for vegetables and fruit (~800g/day) [37] and determined the fraction of this total for vegetables (~0.63) and fruit (~0.38). For each of the nine CFG age and sex groups, we then multiplied the total number of CFG servings for vegetables and fruit by these fractions, and rounded to the nearest serving to estimate separate vegetable and fruit serving recommendations. Because CFG age groups do not exactly align with age groups used in the EBIC to estimate economic costs, we made the following assumptions. First, for the EBIC age category encompassing individuals ≤14 years, we used the CFG recommendations for children 4–8 years as these recommendations were in the middle of this age category. For adults, we used the CFG recommendation that applied to the majority of the relevant EBIC age and sex group. For nuts and seeds, processed meat, and red meat, we used recommendations set by reputable Canadian organizations because CFG does not provide specific recommendations for these foods. We used a recommendation of 30g/day of nuts and seeds (~1 CFG serving of nuts and seeds) based on the 2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in the Adult [47]. For processed meat and red meat, we used Canadian Cancer Society recommendations (processed meat: only for special occasions (assumed <0.05 servings/day based on the 2015 GBD TMRE); red meat: ≤3X85g cooked servings/week) [48]. We further assumed a recommendation of 5g/day of SSB based on the 2015 GBD TMRE. A summary of all recommendations we used is provided in .\n\nWe estimated usual intake distributions (distribution of long-term average daily intakes) for each age and sex group of interest using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method [49] MIXTRAN and DISTRIB macros executed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Inc. Cary, NC). The NCI method has the capability to estimate usual intake distributions of dietary factors consumed either non-episodically (i.e., by almost everyone), using a one-part amount model, and episodically (i.e., those not consumed daily by nearly everyone), using a two-part amount and probability model [49,50]. This method also allows for the adjustment of covariates. Similar to other studies using the NCI method to calculate usual intake distributions [51–53], we stratified the sample into three groups: children ≤14 years, women ≥15 years, and men ≥15 years. Also similar to previous studies [51–53], we used dummy variables for sex (child models only) and age groups (15–34 years; 35–54 years; 55–64 years; 65–74 years; 75+ years) (adult models only), weekend or weekday recall, and sequence (difference between first and second recall). We used the two-part model for all foods except vegetables (all models), and milk (child model only) where we used a one-part model. We used one-day intakes for nuts and seeds because so few respondents consumed this food.\n\nUsing the DISTRIB macro, we obtained information on the percentage of each EBIC age and sex group (males and females; ≤14 years, 15–34 years, 35–54 years, 55–64 years, 65–74 years, ≥75 years) consuming different levels of food intakes. For all foods except SSBs, we obtained information on proportions of the population consuming half CFG serving increments. For sugar-sweetened beverages, we obtained information on the proportion of the population consuming increments of 226.8g (one serving) with the exception of capturing information on half serving increments between one and two servings. For foods where the recommendation is near 0, we assumed that the proportion of the population consuming below the following cut-points was not associated with elevated risk: 0.25 servings/day of processed meat and 56.7g/day of SSB as accurate estimates below these values could not be obtained.\n\nPopulation attributable fraction calculations\n\nWe used the dose-response relative risks and food consumption data as inputs to calculate PAFs. The PAF uses both the relative risk of disease and the risk factor prevalence to estimate the fraction of disease that could theoretically be eliminated should the entire population follow healthy eating recommendations [6]. The standard PAF equation is as follows: P(RR-1)/[P(RR-1)+1] where P is the risk factor prevalence, and RR is the relative risk of disease. However, because food intakes are associated with different levels of disease risk depending on the degree to which recommendations are met, we used the method outlined by Krueger et al [6] to handle multiple risk exposure levels. The equation is as follows:\n\nPAF=∑i=1nPi(RRi−1)1+∑i=1nPi(RRi−1)\n\nWhere,\n\nPi is the proportion of individuals in interval i,\n\ni (interval) refers to the consumption of specific numbers of servings/day (e.g., <0.5, 0.5-<1, ≥1),\n\nRR is the relative risk for each incremental increase in food consumption,\n\nRRi = RR(Xi−L) is the relative risk for interval i relative to the recommended number of servings,\n\nXi is the mid value of interval i,\n\nL is the recommended number of servings, and\n\nn is the number of intervals above or below the recommended number of servings.\n\nWe calculated separate PAFs for each food for each chronic disease by sex for each of the following age groups: ≤14 years, 15–34 years, 35–54 years, 55–64 years, 65–74 years, and ≥75 years. The PAF values for each chronic disease were then combined for each sex and age group. Because some of the risk factors may be overlapping (i.e., several risk factors may be similar to one another and therefore redundant) and it is unclear what this overlap entails, it is important that we do not combine PAF values by adding them together as this would result in double counting. As suggested by Krueger et al [6], we used the following equation for this process: Combined PAF = 1-[(1-PAF1)(1-PAF2)(1-PAFn)]. This formula makes the assumption that the risk factors are independent (presence of one risk factor does not affect the probability of having another) and the joint effects of these risk factors are multiplicative (i.e. the presence of one factor does not affect the effect of another on a multiplicative scale). This approach has also been previously used to combine dietary risk factors for other outcomes (e.g., mortality) [37,54,55].\n\nEstimation of direct health care and indirect costs\n\nThe calculated PAF outcomes were used to estimate the direct health care and indirect costs attributable to unhealthy eating. Multiple different sources released in different years were used to estimate costs. First, the proportion of direct health care costs (hospital, physician, drug) associated with each relevant chronic disease by sex for different age groups (i.e., ≤14 years, 15–34 years, 35–54 years, 55–64 years, 65–74 years, and ≥75 years) were extracted from the 2008 EBIC [2] which contains the most recent estimates of this information. Because this resource does not provide separate costs for different types of diabetes, we assumed that type 2 diabetes was responsible for 0.96 of total diabetes costs [56]. Second, these proportions were then multiplied by the total hospital, physician, and drug costs reported by the 2014 National Health Expenditure Trends (i.e., 2014 costs in Canadian dollars) [57] to estimate more current direct health care costs for each relevant chronic disease for each sex and age group. The National Health Expenditure Trends resource contains information on the total hospital, physician, and drug costs for all diseases, age, and sex groups combined. Indirect costs were then estimated using the modified human capital approach as described by Krueger et al [6]. Briefly, using the EBIC 1998 [58] resource, a ratio of total direct health care to indirect costs (which includes costs associated with mortality, long-term disability, and short-term disability) was calculated for each included disease; these ratios are presented in . The indirect cost estimates in EBIC include discounted (5%) present value of lost productivity of all deaths during their estimated life expectancy, together with annual lost productivity by long term and short term disability. The used method utilizes age- and sex-specific rates of life expectancy, average annual earnings, workforce participation rates and values of unpaid work in Canadian provinces and territories [58]. The 2014 hospital, physician, and drug costs were then multiplied by this ratio to obtain indirect costs for each disease for each age and sex group. Third, the 2014 direct health care (hospital, physician, drug) and indirect costs were then multiplied by the relevant PAF to determine the costs attributable to unhealthy eating. Similar to Krueger et al [6,7], a disaggregation step was also applied to determine the economic burden attributable to individual foods.\n\nTable 2\n\nRatio of Indirect to Direct CostsCancer4.78Cardiovascular Diseases1.71Endocrine and Related Diseases (for Diabetes)1.19Genitourinary Diseases (for Renal Disease)0.35\n\nA sensitivity analysis was also conducted similar to Krueger et al [59]. This analysis was done by re-calculating all PAFs using the 95% confidence interval upper and lower boundary estimates for all included relative risks. We also re-calculated the PAFs with the assumption that all individuals consumed one half serving (or one serving for SSBs) closer to the recommendations to determine the potential annual cost difference."
