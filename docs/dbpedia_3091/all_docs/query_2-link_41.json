        "meta_description": "Background: With the exception of Canada, all countries with universal health insurance systems provide universal coverage of prescription drugs. Progress toward universal public drug coverage in Canada has been slow, in part because of concerns about the potential costs. We sought to estimate the cost of implementing universal public coverage of prescription drugs in Canada.\n\nMethods: We used published data on prescribing patterns and costs by drug type, as well as source of funding (i.e., private drug plans, public drug plans and out-of-pocket expenses), in each province to estimate the cost of universal public coverage of prescription drugs from the perspectives of government, private payers and society as a whole. We estimated the cost of universal public drug coverage based on its anticipated effects on the volume of prescriptions filled, products selected and prices paid. We selected these parameters based on current policies and practices seen either in a Canadian province or in an international comparator.\n\nResults: Universal public drug coverage would reduce total spending on prescription drugs in Canada by $7.3 billion (worst-case scenario $4.2 billion, best-case scenario $9.4 billion). The private sector would save $8.2 billion (worst-case scenario $6.6 billion, best-case scenario $9.6 billion), whereas costs to government would increase by about $1.0 billion (worst-case scenario $5.4 billion net increase, best-case scenario $2.9 billion net savings). Most of the projected increase in government costs would arise from a small number of drug classes.\n\nInterpretation: The long-term barrier to the implementation of universal pharmacare owing to its perceived costs appears to be unjustified. Universal public drug coverage would likely yield substantial savings to the private sector with comparatively little increase in costs to government.\n\nSee also page [475][1] and [www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.150281][2]\n\n [1]: /lookup/volpage/187/475\n [2]: http://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.150281",

        "text": "Universal health care coverage encourages access to necessary care and protects patients from financial hardship, and the World Health Organization has declared that governments are obligated to promote universal coverage of necessary health care services, including prescription drugs.1 All developed countries with universal health insurance systems provide universal coverage of prescription drugs — with the exception of Canada.\n\nFederal cost-sharing of provincially run programs established Canada’s national system of universal, comprehensive public insurance for hospital care in the 1950s and medical care in the 1960s.2 Canada has a single-payer public insurance system for these services in each province and territory. Such coverage for prescription drugs was recommended by the 1964 Royal Commission on Health Services, the 1997 National Forum on Health, and the 2002 Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada.3–5 Despite these recommendations, prescription drugs in Canada are currently funded by a fragmented patchwork of public and private drug plans that varies by province and leaves many Canadians with little or no drug coverage at all.6\n\nFederal drug plans cover First Nations and other targeted populations that account for 2% of prescription costs in Canada; provincial drug plans cover various populations, accounting for a total of 36% of prescription costs in Canada (ranging from 28% in New Brunswick to 41% in Alberta).7 A total of 36% of drug costs Canada-wide are funded through private insurance plans, 4% of costs are funded through compulsory social insurance policies (i.e., workers’ compensation funds and compulsory drug coverage required for residents of Quebec), and 22% of costs are funded out-of-pocket by patients.7\n\nAwareness that the lack of universal drug coverage is a serious shortcoming of the Canadian health care system is growing.8–10 Owing to variations in drug coverage by province and patient group, about 1 in 10 Canadians report that they cannot afford to take their medications as prescribed.11,12 In contrast, such cost-related barriers to prescription drugs are reported by only about 1 in 50 residents of the United Kingdom, where universal coverage of prescription drugs is provided at little or no cost to patients.13 Canadians who fill prescriptions incur out-of-pocket costs that vary considerably depending on their age, employment status and province of residence.13–15 Overall, 5.7% of Canadians incurred more than $1000 in out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs in 2007, whereas just 1.2% of British citizens reported incurring such levels of out-of-pocket costs.13\n\nProgress toward universal public drug coverage in Canada has been slow, in part because of concerns about the potential cost of such a program.16,17 Previous studies concerning the impact of a universal public drug plan in Canada have been limited by a lack of data on prescribing patterns, costs by drug type and source of funding (i.e., private drug plans, public drug plans and out-of-pocket).18–20 Researchers therefore have been unable to model details concerning expected changes in the volume, type and price of prescription drugs purchased by patients with different levels of coverage within and across provinces. We address this information gap using recently published data describing prescription drug spending by province, drug type and source of funding.\n\nWe model the cost-impact of a universal system of prescription drug coverage that would be akin to Canadian medicare: public coverage of medically necessary prescription drugs on universal terms and conditions across Canada, including limited patient copayments and a national formulary. We provide estimates of the cost of such a program from the perspective of government, private payers and society as a whole."
