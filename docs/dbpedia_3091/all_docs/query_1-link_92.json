The room was nice, the staff was pleasant, and breakfast was awesome. Stay here.2017-08-03\"\n\n\"I have trouble with stairs and requested a room on the 1st floor, but arrived to find we had to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the lobby, then took an elevator to the 1st floor. The beds were comfortable, but we were subjected to loud music from the live band at the downstairs bar. When I called to complain about the noise, the clerk told me it was to be expected at a downtown hotel.2017-06-14\"\n\n\"Lots of street noise, and we had to open the window since the room was quite warm.

If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -\n\nDon't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot  because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -\n\nAlways read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -\n\nMore >\n\nWhen you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.\n\nThe earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.\n\n< Less"
