        "text": "Canada Place Cruise Terminal\n\nClick to zoom\n\nBefore embarkation: When you make a reservation, we ask for you to specify a time for delivery of your luggage at Canada Place. At the time of delivery, you are requested to wait outside the terminal building. Our van will pull up in front of the terminal building for curbside delivery.\n\nAfter disembarkation: If you are a cruise ship passenger with a reservation, you will find our vehicle waiting for you right outside the main terminal building. As you step outside the terminal, look around for your pickup vehicle. It can be parked right in front of the building or across the street depending on availability of parking spots. If you cannot make it outside the terminal by the designated pick-up time, please give us a call at 1-888-411-5260. You also need to call us if your disembarkation goes smoothly and you are able to leave the terminal before the designated pick-up time. In that case, we may be able to dispatch a vehicle sooner depending on our availability.\n\nHotels, residences, offices, and all other locations\n\nOur pick-ups and deliveries are conducted at the curbside. As such, we ask that you meet our vehicle outside the designated pick-up/delivery location at the time you specified on your reservation. For example, if you reserved a pick up from Hilton at 1pm, please wait outside the main entrance or inside the lobby where you can see our vehicle pulling up in front of the hotel at 1pm. It is especially important for you to meet us outside the building if you are an Airbnb guest because we have no way of entering the residential buildings.\n\nAirport departures (domestic & int'l)\n\nClick to zoom\n\nThis procedure applies to both domestic and international flights departing from Vancouver International Airport:\n\nIf you would like your luggage to be delivered to you at the airport prior to your departure, we ask that you to specify the flight number and preferred delivery time when you make a reservation. Our online reservation form prompts you to enter your flight number and the specific time for delivery. We advise setting the delivery time at least 1 hour before a domestic flight or 2 hours before an international flight.\n\nWhen you get to the airport, you will see a sign above each terminal entrance. These signs list the names of the airlines closest to each specific entrance. We ask that you wait outside the terminal in front of the entrance associated with your airline. Our delivery vehicle will pull up in front of you at the specified time of delivery. Please note that we are not allowed to idle in front of the terminal if you are not present. As such, we need you to be waiting for us at the curbside at the specified time of delivery. If you anticipate delays in getting to the airport, please call us to change the time of delivery: 1-888-411-5260. Please note that if you would like to change the delivery time by more than 15 minutes, there may be additional charges associated with the change depending on our delivery schedule at the time.\n\nDeliveries at a hotel\n\nIf you would like us to deliver your luggage to a hotel, we can leave it with the concierge prior to your arrival at the hotel. Most hotels take your luggage to your room before you check it if we deliver it before you arrive. This is a great service you would like to take advantage of. When you make an online reservation, please add a note if you prefer us to leave your luggage with the hotel employees. Otherwise, we will ask for you when we get to the hotel for delivery. If you do not specifically ask for pre-check-in delivery, we will leave you luggage with the concierge only if you are not available at the hotel at the designated time of delivery.\n\nInternational arrivals at the airport\n\nClick to zoom\n\nInternational arrivals:\n\nâ€‹If you would like us to pick up your luggage from you at the airport upon your arrival, we will obtain your flight information so that we can keep track of your flight status. Upon landing, please call us after picking up your luggage from the carousel. Our vehicles will be waiting outside - a few minutes away from the terminal. Upon receiving your call, we will dispatch a vehicle to the pick up location. You need to leave the terminal with your luggage, turn left, cross the street, and walk about 10 meters to the pick up location where you will find our vehicle. Please note we are not allowed to idle at the pick up location if the passenger is not present. As such, we need you to be present at the pick up location immediately after calling us for dispatch.\n\nDelays: Although we obtain your flight information as part of your reservation, we still need you to specify a pick up time as a reference. For example, if your flight is scheduled to land at 1:00 pm, you may want to enter 2:00 pm as the pick up time to allow for customs and luggage retrieval from the carousel. If we notice any delays associated with your flight, we simply add the delay duration to the pick up. For example, if your designated pick up time is 2pm for a flight that is scheduled to land at 1pm, we will change the pick up time to 2:30pm if your flight is delayed by 30 minutes.\n\nWe understand in certain situations, your post-landing procedures (passport control, customs, luggage retrieval) may take longer than expected. If this is the case for you, we expect you to call us and inform us of additional post-landing delays. Per our policy, we will deem your reservation a no-show if you fail to call us within the 15-minute period after your scheduled or modified pick up time. In case of longer delays, we may be able to wait for you depending on our availability if you call us on a timely basis. In case of longer waits, we charge $1.00 per minute past the 15th minute after the scheduled or modified pick up time. For example, your flight is scheduled to land at 1pm and your scheduled pick up time is 2pm. Your flight is delayed in mid-flight for 30 minutes and we modified your pick up time to 2:30pm. We expect you call us by 2:45pm at the latest. Otherwise, you will be deemed a no-show and your reservation will be cancelled automatically. In case you experience post landing delays and call to let us know before 2:45pm, we may be able to wait for you longer and if we do wait, we will charge $1.00 per minute after 2:45pm.\n\nDomestic arrivals at the airport\n\nClick to zoom\n\nDomestic arrivals:\n\nIf you would like us to pick up your luggage from you at the airport upon your arrival, we will obtain your flight information so that we can keep track of your flight status.

What time should I put in as the pickup time?\n\nWe recommend adding an hour to your scheduled disembarkation time to estimate your pickup time for the reservation. We understand it is difficult to be on time due to the unpredictable nature of cruise ship disembarkation process. No worries. We always have a vehicle waiting near the cruise ship terminal. As soon as you clear customs, please call your driver directly to coordinate your pickup. You will receive your driver's contact information before the date of your pickup.\n\nHow much does it cost to pick-up and deliver my luggage?\n\nIn downtown Vancouver area, we charge 19.99 per reservation for pick up/delivery. Pick-up/delivery fees do not change based on the number of luggage items. For example, even if you have 10 bags, you will still be charged 19.99 for pick-up and 19.99 for delivery.
