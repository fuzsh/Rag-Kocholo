        "text": "University Fees\n\nHow Much Will University Cost?\n\nThe amount of tuition you pay will depend on factors such as your program and year of study, your course load and your campus. While the exact tuition fees for each academic year are typically finalized in the spring, you can take a look at the previous year’s amounts in your area of study to get an idea of how much you’ll pay in tuition. Remember that in addition to tuition, your total fees will include incidental and ancillary fees.\n\nLook up Tuition Fees for your area of study.\n\nFinal tuition, fee schedules, and payment information are posted on the Student Accounts website.\n\nIncidental and Ancillary Fees\n\nNon-Academic Incidental Fees (or Incidental Fees) contribute to things like student societies, campus-based services, athletics and recreation facilities, and student health and dental plans. Many of these fees are compulsory, but you will have the option of opting out of a small proportion of them.\n\nAncillary fees cover things like field-trip costs, or special equipment provided for coursework, as well as administrative costs such as transcript fees or library fines.\n\nFind out more about Incidental & Ancillary Fees.\n\nOther Costs of University\n\nThere are a number of other costs to factor into your budget – for example, the cost of books, educational supplies, food, and residence. And international students should also factor in the University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP). Find more about other costs of attending university.\n\nTo get a better idea of how much money you will need to cover tuition and fees, housing costs, food and everything else for the upcoming academic year, use our financial planning calculator to budget your costs. This is only a rough estimate on the cost of university, but should give you an idea about how much to budget."
