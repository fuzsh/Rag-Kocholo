        "text": "1. Executive Summary\n\nOn September 17 and 18, 2013, the Economics of Policing: Police Education and Learning Summit brought together, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, more than one hundred representatives from approximately thirty Canadian police services, the three national police associations, federal and provincial representatives, as well as academic organizations to examine efficiencies in police training. Co-hosted by Public Safety Canada and the Canadian Police Knowledge Network (CPKN), this event was structured around the broader 'economics of policing' dialogue while specifically focussing on issues related to police training.\n\nThe economics of policing is not simply about reducing the cost of policing in Canada but ensuring existing resources are used efficiently and effectively. Police training is fundamental to ensure police officers have the knowledge, skills and tools to reduce crime and disorder in our communities. Police training must be cost efficient, relevant and delivered in an effective manner. The policing community must work collaboratively and in a forward thinking fashion to ensure police training meets its objectives, including taking advantage of innovative training methods and new technologies.\n\nLed by facilitator Norm Taylor, the Summit agenda was structured in an interactive, discussion-based format in order to achieve the following objectives:\n\nTo understand learning needs and opportunities for Canadian police services;\n\nTo learn about technology-enhanced training and other innovative learning solutions from industry experts including academia and private and public sector trainer specialists; and\n\nTo prioritize training needs, current and future, for the Canadian police sector.\n\nThe focus of the discussions was organized around the following three themes: Cost of Police Training; Landscape of Canadian Police Training; and Competencies in Police Training.\n\nCost of Police Training\n\nThe cost of police training in Canada is poorly understood and is not tracked consistently across policing services. As such, there is a need to determine the total cost of police training in Canada and to demonstrate if that training is delivered in a cost effective and efficient manner. What is evident is there are other factors that impact the cost of police training that need to be considered. These secondary factors include: backfilling positions and overtime when an officer needs to attend training. In addition, a cost analysis of police training must take into consideration the effectiveness of the various styles of training, particularly the use of technology and e-learning, which have demonstrated a potential for cost savings.\n\nA fulsome understanding of the cost of police training and collaboration among trainers could inform the identification of best practices and allow for the development of national training guidelines that are adaptable to jurisdictional needs. True collaboration between parties can exist when mutually accepted rules, memoranda of understanding, and strong and equitable governance frameworks are established. An evidence-based approach to police training would demonstrate to senior policing officials and other executives the importance of training and the need for prioritizing these resources.\n\nLandscape of Canadian Police Training\n\nThe landscape of Canadian police training is one of technology and collaboration. The use of technology is bringing a new dimension to police training. We are seeing more trainers incorporating e-learning, blended learning and simulations into existing curriculum, and police learners are receptive to change. In a time of change, what appears to be lacking is collaboration among police trainers, and with outside training experts. Countries like Australia have broken through these barriers and are employing technology-based innovative training on a service-wide scale. This approach is now the standard practice to both operational and developmental learning. We are seeing progress in Canada and training is being delivered in the following innovative ways:\n\nWork is being done with e-learning specialists like CPKN, to develop electronic learning portals that can deliver the same training to many police services;\n\nRegional training centres have modified their training to be in line with local police services; and\n\nCapitalizing on the experience and knowledge of academics to develop and deliver evidence-based training in-house to new recruits and in service officers.\n\nIn order to identify best practices and continue to develop training that is innovative and technological, police trainers and services must engage with academia and be open to change. Universities and colleges can also be a partner in exploring academic accreditation for police training in the future.\n\nCompetencies in Police Training\n\nThe next generation of police learning may be more structured around competencies. Police competencies are a useful tool to identify core policing activities and a measure of the effectiveness of police training. Competencies also clarify demands on learning providers by identifying national benchmarks for police training, and efficient succession planning and leadership development. These are essential components in developing a well-trained, professional police service. Competencies can also be useful in the recruiting and promotional process, particularly when introduced at the beginning of a police officer's career. This provides officers with clarity around their responsibilities and what is required for advancement in the service. Competencies should be incorporated into current human resource practices even if it means drastically changing the structure of policing in Canada.\n\nFuture Training Needs\n\nIn the future, police trainers will need to fully embrace technology, e-learning and even more innovative education and learning styles and techniques. There is a need to determine the baseline costing for police training in Canada so that police trainers can identify opportunities for cost savings through the use of technology. Better collaboration between police services and training experts will support the development of national guidelines for police training. A true understanding of today's landscape of police education and learning, and an openness to innovative approaches, will shape the future of police education and learning in Canada.\n\n2. Purpose of the Report\n\nThis report records the proceedings and outcomes of the Economics of Policing: Police Education and Learning Summit that took place on September 17-18, 2013, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The report includes summaries of panel presentations, the keynote address, group discussions, and outlines the key themes identified throughout the course of the Summit.\n\nThe views expressed herein are those of the participants at the Summit and do not necessarily reflect those of the Government of Canada or the CPKN.\n\n3. Purpose of the Summit\n\nEducation and learning are key factors in developing a professional police service and ensuring that officers have the right skills and competencies to deal with operational and community needs. Enhancing police knowledge and approaches is a priority under Public Safety Canada's Economics of Policing initiatives and CPKN plays a leading role in the advancement of technology-enhanced learning models in the Canadian police community.\n\nThe Summit brought together police leaders, training experts, frontline officers, academics, and industry representatives to explore and identify learning needs and priorities for Canadian police. Together, we looked at what and how police officers learn and if current approaches are conducive to today's social, operational and technical environments.\n\nThe objectives of this two-day Summit were:\n\nTo understand learning needs and opportunities for Canadian police services;\n\nTo learn about technology-enhanced training and other innovative learning solutions from industry experts, including academia and private and public sector trainer specialists; and\n\nTo prioritize current and future training needs for the Canadian police sector.\n\n4. Summary of Presentations and Discussions\n\nOn September 17-18, 2013, Public Safety Canada and CPKN partnered to bring together 100 participants from various police services across the country, provincial representatives, police board members, frontline officers and union representatives to discuss police education and learning in the context of the Economics of Policing. As police services strive to be more efficient and effective, they must consider how they deliver all of their services including how they educate and train their officers.\n\nThe means by which training is administered is also part of the discourse. It is without a doubt that technology has changed the way society interacts and communicates, so it is no surprise that technology plays a large role in how officers are educated and trained.\n\nThe Economics of Policing: Police Education and Learning Summit was structured around theme-based discussions which focused primarily on presentations by individuals from the police training sector. These individuals 'set the stage' for broader group discussions by sharing their organizational initiatives, experience, and perspectives. The discussions over the two days focused on the cost of police training, how we educate police and how officers learn, as well as the role that technology can play in transforming training and the associated costs. The following is a summary of facts, ideas, and questions raised by the presenters. To view the full presentations, click on the active links below.\n\nThe following presentations provided context to the agenda, outlined the Economics of Policing issue, and laid the foundation for the Summit discussions.\n\nSetting the Stage: Training and the Economics of Policing\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nThe Honourable Julian Fantino, Minister of Veterans Affairs opened the Summit on behalf of the Honourable Steven Blaney, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness\n\nThe Honourable Minister Julian Fantino opened the Summit by commending all in the room for coming together to discuss the important issue of police training. Minister Fantino stated that the Economics of Policing is not about eliminating certain activities in order to reduce budget line items but rather it is about finding more effective and innovative ways for the policing community to work together to address criminality and disorder, both now and for the future. He made note that the Government of Canada is committed to the Economics of Policing initiatives that will address these issues by fostering strong partnerships, effective communication, relevant research, and better information-sharing. Two of the initiatives mentioned by the Minister include the:\n\nIndex of Policing Initiatives: a database of innovative and cost-effective initiatives gathered from police services and provincial and territorial governments that aims to help police services learn from one another's best practices; and\n\nPolice Research Plan: Public Safety Canada is developing a national research agenda for policing, which will include working with academics and universities to establish a police research centre of excellence that will strengthen Canada's research capacity; as well as a repository of police research.\n\nMinister Fantino emphasized that the most essential and fundamental aspect of the Economics of Policing is police training. As a result, there is a need to look at the true costs of police training and how police services are using technology to improve the delivery of training across the country. The Minister challenged all Summit participants to delve into this, and other training issues, to begin transforming how training is delivered to police across Canada.\n\nMinister Fantino informed Summit participants that, in support of the Economics of Policing initiatives, the Federal, Provincial and Territorial (FPT) Ministers Responsible for Justice and Public Safety will be meeting this fall to discuss the Shared Forward Agenda; a strategy for the future of policing in Canada. FPT Ministers will examine activities under the Agenda that will guide the policing community toward efficient, sustainable, and effective policing in Canada.\n\nEconomics of Policing\n\nMark Potter, Director General, Policing Policy Directorate, Public Safety Canada\n\nMark Potter's presentation focused on the Economics of Policing and emphasized the need for a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing policing in Canada. He noted that the Economics of Policing is about the efficiency and effectiveness of policing and public safety more broadly, including areas like police training and education. Mr. Potter also mentioned that to better understand the changes in policing costs we must understand the context in which police are carrying out their duties. The world of policing has changed; officers are dealing with individuals who suffer from addictions and mental illness and police face new crimes and challenges such as cyber-crime and terrorism. In addition, the Canadian public is increasingly engaged on issues related to policing and aware of the increasingly diverse and complex nature of police work.\n\nMr. Potter provided an overview of policing in Canada, noting that one of the greatest challenges facing policing today is that both the cost and the number of police officers continue to increase while, at the same time, the reported crime rate and the crime severity index continue to decline. In 2012, Canada employed just under 70,000 sworn police officers and just over 28,000 civilian staff. In 2011, Statistics Canada reported that the total cost of policing in Canada was $12.9 billion or $375 per Canadian.\n\nSince 1997, the cost of policing in Canada has more than doubled, outpacing the increase in spending by all levels of government. The average salary for police personnel alone has increased by an average of 40% since 2000 while the salary for all employed Canadians has increased on average by 11% in the same time period. In the face of such increases in police expenditures, the reported crime rate continues its downward trend, dropping 3% between 2011 and 2012, reaching its lowest level since 1972. The crime severity index also dropped in 2012 for the ninth consecutive year. In addition, recent polling indicates the majority of Canadians feel satisfied with their personal safety.\n\nIn order to address these issues, including the increase in police expenditures, Mr. Potter indicated that we must move forward in a focused and collaborative way on actions to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of policing and public safety in Canada. Governments and the policing community are already pursuing opportunities to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of policing through:\n\nEngagement with citizens, police services and stakeholders on performance measures, priorities, the role of police and the future of policing;\n\nActions to increase operational and structural efficiency and effectiveness; and\n\nInvesting in proactive, integrated community safety approaches to get at the root causes of crime.\n\nMr. Potter informed participants that in the fall of 2013, Public Safety Canada will be seeking approval from FPT Ministers on a Shared Forward Agenda as a collective first step in shaping the future of policing in Canada. The goals of the Agenda are to:\n\nIncrease the efficiency and effectiveness of policing in Canada;\n\nEncourage learning, innovation and the application of best practices; and\n\nContribute to improved public safety outcomes and social well-being.\n\nMr. Potter indicated that the Shared Forward Agenda outlines both early actions, ready for implementation following approval by FPT Ministers, and actions that require further consideration and consultation in the areas of research, information-sharing, efficiencies within police services, new models of community safety and efficiencies within the justice system. In order to implement these actions, Public Safety Canada will continue to collaborate with other governments, police services and stakeholders to flesh-out and implement the strategy.\n\nBuilding Bridges: Lessons Learned about Training, Technology, and Collaboration\n\nSandy Sweet, President, Canadian Police Knowledge Network\n\nSandy Sweet outlined the benefits of collaboration in police training and how technology is transforming the industry. He also noted that factors such as changing demographics, technology, and economic realities all contribute to the need to change our approach to police training. Technology-enhanced learning has long been recognized as an efficient and effective means to train frontline officers. Evidence-based research and case studies also support the value of online and blended learning.\n\nMr. Sweet noted that a policing culture that resists new methods of police training remains the single largest barrier to building a national inventory of training resources. Mr. Sweet estimates that approximately $1 billion is spent annually on police training in Canada. With more collaboration and integration of training resources, as much as $300 million might be saved and could be reallocated to other areas of police operations.\n\nTheme 1: The Cost of Policing\n\nPolice Training Practices and Costs: What are the Essential Questions?\n\nThrough research and case studies, presenters outlined current police training practices, the known and national estimates on police training costs. Presenters also identified what information is needed to ensure police training is efficient and effective in the future.\n\nCost of Police Education and Learning in Canada\n\nRachel Huggins, Manager, Policing Policy and Coordination, Public Safety Canada\n\nRachel Huggins presented an overview of the available data on the cost of police training in Canada and suggested potential cost savings related to innovative education and learning approaches. Ms. Huggins indicated that there is a lack of information available regarding the true cost of police training in Canada. At this time, only a handful of case studies are able to quantify the cost of police training, however two of these case studies were able to demonstrate a cost savings potential through the use of online education.\n\nNational-level data on police training costs is required in order to determine:\n\nTotal costs for training, by Canadian police service; and\n\nCurrent training methods, by police service, type and cost.\n\nSuch data would not only provide a complete picture of the amount police services spend on training in Canada but would allow for cost comparisons between training delivery methods, including in-class versus online training, as well as demonstrate associated training costs.\n\nCost of Policing - Calgary Police Service\n\nRoger Chaffin, Deputy Chief, Calgary Police Service\n\nDeputy Chief Roger Chaffin provided an overview of the Calgary Police Service's (CPS) training costs, in-house training program, and what information is needed to ensure future CPS training is effective. Deputy Chief Chaffin noted that the CPS training budget accounts for approximately 3.5% or $10 million of the overall operating budget. The budget supports the Service's in-house and external training, including recruit training, Canadian Police College courses, university courses, conferences and executive development programs.\n\nThe Deputy Chief acknowledged that CPS has come a long way in its use of technology and is looking to future innovative techniques such as gaming and learning. The Service sees the benefits of in-house training and has developed the Chief Crowfoot Learning Centre to provide officers with on-site access to scenario/case-based and blended training. Officers also have access to a self-directed, online, 24/7 e-learning portal. He noted that this approach has been a tremendous success for the Service, with a high user rate as officers can access training on their own time.\n\nDeputy Chief Chaffin noted that in order for CPS to ensure future training is effective and efficiently delivered, the following must be considered:\n\nThe costs associated with taking police officers off the street for training;\n\nThe effectiveness of various styles of training; and\n\nHow critical thinking, reflective practice and engagement with learners can be incorporated into training.\n\nThe Deputy Chief went on to provide an overview of how e-learning is being used and where CPS wants to take training in the future, including collaborating with training partners and the further incorporation of technology into training (e.g. use of iPads and gaming).\n\nChanging the Training Paradigm: Always applicable, but unique to each agency\n\nBrent Shea, Deputy Chief, London Police Service\n\nDeputy Chief Brent Shea discussed how the London Police Service (LPS) came to embrace e-learning. Senior management was initially opposed to the implementation of e-learning until, in 2008, the Ontario Police College was able to demonstrate significant cost savings using blended learning. He noted that blended learning accounted for an annual savings of $19,670 for the General Investigation Training Course and $23,973 for the Advanced Patrol Training Course. Today, LPS recognizes not only the economic efficiency of e-learning but the learning benefits that are being achieved.\n\nLPS now has an annual line item in the budget for e-learning and is taking advantage of other innovative approaches to support officer training including a course re-imbursement program for self-initiated learning, a 24 hour on-site computer classroom and the implementation of the LPS e-Learning Portal which enables officers to access training remotely. Deputy Chief Shea noted that the next challenge that he wants to address is ensuring that police training in the Service's budget is seen as a commodity rather than an expendable expense.\n\nCosts of Training - Saskatoon Police Service\n\nBernie Pannell, Deputy Chief, Saskatoon Police Service\n\nDeputy Chief Bernie Pannell provided an overview of the Saskatchewan Police College's (SPC) Cost Reduction Strategy, the training cost of the Saskatoon Police Service (SPS) and the impact new legislation has on police training.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2012 the budget for SPC increased from $318,340 to $1,162,000. As a result, the College is now engaged in the following efforts to reduce costs:\n\nCapitalizing on blended learning;\n\nHosting training around the province to reduce costs for partners outside Regina;\n\nEnsuring specialists only instruct when necessary; and\n\nLeasing RCMP facilities when possible.\n\nDeputy Chief Pannell noted that the overall operating budget for the SPS in 2013 is $80 million, of which $693,200 or 0.87% is allocated to training costs. Recent legislative changes, such as the new mandated Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW) training, have impacted the training budgets of the police services in Saskatchewan. Even with the additional costs, Deputy Chief Pannell recognizes that the cost of not providing such training affects more than the financial bottom line and increases the risk of public complaints and the loss of public confidence. In response to these pressures, Saskatchewan is looking at more cost efficient ways of delivering training by taking advantage of: new technology and techniques; focusing on training for core police functions; and sharing training and best practices with other agencies.\n\nDeputy Chief Pannell noted that SPC is looking beyond other police services and wants to increase provincial partnerships and collaboration between the government, police, corrections and educational institutions to address public safety research, education and training.\n\nKeynote Address\n\nAchieving Organizational Success through Technology-Enhanced Education and Learning\n\nAndrew McKee, Sergeant, Victoria Police, Melbourne, Australia\n\nSergeant Andrew McKee provided an overview of how the Victoria Police in Melbourne, Australia uses technology to address the resource constraints with having to train over 12,500 police service members. The Victoria Police was experiencing a number of resourcing issues including a shortage of trainers, the overuse of equipment and facilities that were full to capacity. In response, the police service considered increasing their training capacity and capabilities by:\n\nBuilding bigger facilities;\n\nTraining and developing more instructors;\n\nChanging the core training hours; and\n\nMoving training off site.\n\nInstead of these big budget considerations, they implemented eLearning programs for compliance-based courses which realigned the training and shifted $20 million back into the operational sector every 6 months.\n\nAccording to Sergeant McKee, the ultimate goal of the Victoria Police was to provide quality theoretical training that met the needs of both employees of the police service, governments and the community, while meeting quality assurance standards.\n\nIn developing training courses, the Victoria Police examined a number of factors. The Trend Analysis Unit determined the organizational demands to which training had to respond. Input was also sought from coroners, psychologists and others who are responsible for reviewing officers' actions in the field. The review concluded that e-learning provided opportunities to better adapt training to police officers' learning styles, improve efficiencies, partner (where appropriate), while addressing operational and budgetary demands.\n\nThe Victoria Police implemented a new training delivery model in 2012. The Victoria Police, Media and Online Learning Unit (MOLU) rolled out its first two training packages: Critical Incident Management and Critical Incidents Involving the Mentally Ill, using a blended courses model of online training backed up with a practical application component. Sergeant McKee noted that management buy-in was essential to the change management that was underway in the police service, not only to secure the financial resources but to ensure that the service was accountable for the delivery of that training.\n\nThe current approach of the Victoria Police has proven successful for many reasons, including skills retention. However, the program coordinators are cognizant of future challenges such as ensuring the integrity of the programs, changes in technology, mitigating the effect of turnover within the training delivery teams, as well as process issues and continuous improvement requirements. Sergeant McKee noted that the Victoria Police is also interested in mapping the effect of this new training model against crime rates and other factors to further identify benefits of e-learning.\n\nTheme 2: The Landscape of Canadian Police Training\n\nState of the Nation: Challenges and Opportunities\n\nPresenters provided an overview of the frontline perspective and training research related to police education and learning.\n\nState of the Nation: Challenges and Opportunities (no presentation available)\n\nTom Stamatakis, President, Canadian Police Association\n\nTom Stamatakis provided an overview of some of the gaps in our understanding of police training. For example, how do we: establish accountability to ensure that officers complete required training; ensure program effectiveness; get program buy-in from upper management; and link training to performance measures and breakdown of costs?\n\nIn order to address some of the gaps, Mr. Stamatakis noted that we must first define what \"core policing\" consists of, in the Canadian context, and how these core functions change from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so that appropriate training can be designed. He also noted that we need to begin to link training to performance measures and measure our training successes and use these measures as standards. Furthermore, online education needs to be properly resourced, evaluated and compensated. There is a general need to ensure, through evaluation and research, that training itself is effective and we are not only looking at the medium through which training is delivered.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. Stamatakis advocated for a national approach to police training. He suggested establishing a national committee for police education and training composed of representatives from police services, governments, colleges and universities. This committee could establish a framework for police training in Canada through consultations, collaborative partnerships and a commitment to excellence. A key deliverable of the committee would be to determine clear evaluation measures for training, as well as a definition of the \"effectiveness\" of training.\n\nBuilding Efficiencies through Collaboration\n\nPresenters provided examples of innovative and sector-wide collaboration around police training.\n\nCollaboration and Efficiencies: OPC/CPKN Partnership\n\nJon Schmidt, Deputy Director, Ontario Police College\n\nJon Schmidt provided an overview of the collaborative efforts between CPKN and the Ontario Police College (OPC) to create an online Front Line Supervisor Training course. Originally this course was delivered in a classroom format by OPC with little use of technology. In the process of modernizing this course, OPC and CPKN worked together to examine the different delivery methods for the course and determined that a blended learning approach with a self-study component would be the most beneficial. Mr. Schmidt noted that in order to properly implement this model, the existing in-class program was suspended for nine months while the framework was developed for the self-study, online and in-class aspects of the course. An evaluation component was also developed to ensure knowledge transfer and information retention through the use of exams. Today, the training modules developed by the OPC can be used by any police training organization and are compatible with the skills required for frontline officers across the country.\n\n\"A great group of presenters… everyone was very open to discussions and freely shared information…\"\n\nEdmonton Police Service: Investigative Skills Education Program (no presentation available)\n\nJamie Clover, Staff Sergeant, Edmonton Police Service\n\nStaff Sergeant Jamie Clover discussed the requirements for successful collaboration among police training coordinators. He noted that true collaboration is a difficult process but is achievable if the parties establish mutually accepted rules, develop memoranda of understanding and implement strong and equitable governance frameworks. If what needs to be achieved is accurately defined, true collaboration will occur. Staff Sergeant Clover noted that e-learning is another version of collaboration as it requires the input of police, educators and IT services.\n\nStaff Sergeant Clover stated that policing is a craft and the standardization of that craft must include collaboration among police services. He was also of the view that in order to standardize the policing craft in Canada, the policing community must identify both the aspects of the policing craft that are consistent across the country and how policing can be adapted to meet specific jurisdictional needs. He also emphasized that just as there is always a cost for training, there are also costs and consequences associated when training is not carried out.\n\nPolice Education and Learning Needs\n\nPresenters provided an overview of how police training is delivered in each of their organizations in order to meet the learning needs of police officers.\n\nOPPLearn: Lessons Learned and Future Direction\n\nHugh Stevenson, Superintendent / Director, Ontario Provincial Police Academy\n\nSuperintendent Hugh Stevenson provided an overview of the lessons learned following the implementation of OPPLearn, the e-learning platform of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Academy, as well as future direction for the project. In 2007, the OPP Learning Management System (LMS) was implemented in order to track the training of OPP officers. In 2010, OPPLearn was also launched as the OPP e-learning platform. Since the implementation of OPPLearn, the OPP has witnessed an increase in course completions and has saved about $1 million on training. Additional benefits to the implementation of the LMS and OPPLearn include real time access to training stats and individual training histories that can be used by management when making staffing decisions.\n\nWhen adopting e-learning and a LMS, Superintendent Stevenson indicated that the police service must be cognizant of the availability of the following:\n\nOrganizational acceptance;\n\nSupporting infrastructure;\n\nImplementation costs;\n\nIT support; and\n\nOn-going program support and maintenance.\n\nAccording to Superintendent Stevenson, the OPP is now addressing a new wave of issues that has arisen with the implementation of the LMS and OPPLearn. These issues include getting police officers to \"come off the road\" to do training. Many feel that the operational requirements of the job outweigh the need to train. OPPLearn also lacks the infrastructure to allow self-enrollment in training. The OPP Academy also needs to align training with officer performance plans and link courses to job competencies in order for the service to plan training effectively. Superintendent Stevenson noted that although there are new challenges, the service has come a long way in improving training and reducing overall costs.\n\nEconomics of Policing - PRTC\n\nMichel Legault, Superintendent, RCMP Pacific Regional Training Centre\n\nSuperintendent Michel Legault provided an overview of the RCMP Pacific Regional Training Centre (PRTC) training program and the challenges, successes and future directions for the Centre. One of the priorities of the PRTC is to harmonize RCMP training with that of other law enforcement agencies in British Columbia. He noted that this is about efficiencies, as well as establishing consistent training practices at a provincial level. The harmonization of police training programs must focus on better collaboration and innovation.\n\n\"Very Informative\"\n\nIn moving forward with police training, Superintendent Legault indicated the PRTC harmonization efforts are also about comparing the role that academic institutions play in delivering police training versus training provided by law enforcement training centres. In addition, Superintendent Legault suggested that governments should be more involved in police training and can play a role by investing in research opportunities to ensure financial and human resources are targeting the appropriate training and learning needs of police.\n\nThe Journey Ahead: Defining Our Academic Direction\n\nJune MacDonald-Jenkins, Dean of Police Education, Durham Regional Police Service\n\nDean June MacDonald-Jenkins provided an overview of the Durham Regional Police Service's Police Education and Innovation Centre (PEIC). The focus of PEIC is to provide accessible, appropriate and affordable training to the Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS). Dean MacDonald-Jenkins noted that officer training times vary depending on the technology available. As a result, the PEIC provides 24/7 access to e-learning. It has been noted that the vast majority of learners work between 10:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m.\n\nDean MacDonald-Jenkins noted that what has evolved out of the changes at PEIC is a focus around three core fundamental elements to training: accessibility; appropriateness; and affordability. Any course that does not include all three of these elements is not considered essential training. The PEIC has also incorporated the following themes into all of their training courses: professional development; mental health; and crisis management. These themes are relevant to all police officers from the constable level to the chief of police. As noted by Dean MacDonald-Jenkins, evaluation and education standards are also considered very important to successful training outcomes as they ensure knowledge transfer.\n\nPEIC is employing many innovative approaches in their police training model. The Centre has recently moved to a specialist model where trainers are kept on to deliver training but are also sent out to the front line for 100 hours every summer. The PEIC has determined that it is not possible to develop a specialist in a three year time period usually allocated to most police service positions. The model adopted by PEIC allows trainers to stay connected to the front line while preventing the usual training staff turnover seen by other police services. In addition, the PEIC has been able to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating online training into their police training model. The Centre has been tracking the soft costs of online training on five portfolios and found e-learning provided significant cost savings.\n\nDRPS has recently been approached by police services in British Columbia to duplicate their police training model in that province. This is a testament to the overall success of the PEIC approach to police training.\n\n\"The networking is invaluable. Wonderful to have individuals from different sectors and disciplines (i.e. policing and educators)…\"\n\n\"We understand the issues; we are living them every day… let's find some solutions!\"\n\nTheme 3: Competencies in Police Training\n\nMapping Learning to Police Competencies\n\nPresenters demonstrated how police training can be mapped to police competencies.\n\nCompetencies in Policing\n\nCal Corley, Assistant Commissioner / Director General, Canadian Police College, on behalf of Geoff Gruson\n\nAssistant Commissioner Cal Corley provided an overview of the Police Sector Council's National (Learning) Qualifications Framework. The Framework outlines the training required to meet standardized competencies of police officers from the Constable level through to Chiefs. Assistant Commissioner Corley noted a number of benefits with using the competencies. This framework clarifies the demands on learning providers by identifying: national benchmarks for police training; efficient succession planning and leadership development; and national training standards set by educational institutions. The goal of the National Qualifications Framework is to ensure training and skill requirements are consistent across all police services. Assistant Commissioner Corley noted that human resource planning in police services needs to be modernized through embracing the use of standardized competencies.\n\nPolice Recruit Training Curriculum Mapping\n\nSteve Schnitzer and Nora Houlahan, Justice Institute of British Columbia\n\nSteve Schnitzer and Nora Houlahan of the Justice Institute of British Columbia (JIBC) provided an overview of how they plan to use the Police Sector Council Police Competency Framework to map recruit training in British Columbia. Mr. Schnitzer argued that there is a need to make recruit training defensible, affordable and accessible. The three identified goals for the mapping project are:\n\nMap training to the constable competency profile;\n\nDevelop a searchable curriculum database; and\n\nMap training so that it can be assessed.\n\nMapping recruit competencies to training will provide proof of the standards to which officers are trained and allow for the examination of police core competencies. Competencies will be mapped to discipline objectives and then session competencies can be examined and mapped to objectives.\n\nMs. Houlahan concluded by noting that using these competencies will ensure trainers are using strategies that are tied to outcome objectives. All training and competency information will be available and accessible to all police officers and services.\n\nMapping to Competencies: York Regional Police (no presentation available)\n\nTony Cummins, Sergeant, York Regional Police.\n\nSergeant Tony Cummins provided an overview of how the York Regional Police (YRP) has mapped competencies to the officer promotional process. In 2011, the promotional system of the YRP was examined and a competency based management (CBM) system was implemented.\n\nAs a result, an independent panel was added to the promotional process to review promotional applicants against competencies. Sergeant Cummins noted that YRP has since run seven processes over the past years based on CBM. He also indicated that if an officer doesn't achieve a promotion, the CBM can create a development plan for that member so they may achieve success in the future.\n\nYRP is now implementing competencies within job descriptions and will consider how competencies can be integrated into performance appraisals at the sergeant and constable ranks.\n\nThe Next Generation of Police Learning\n\nPresenters examined learning and innovation through the eyes of the next generation of professional police in Canada.\n\nSynthetic Training vs. Live Training Environment: A Better Way to Train\n\nGreg Kratzig, Innovation and Research, Depot Division, RCMP\n\nGreg Kratzig of the RCMP Depot Division presented on the innovative training approaches being employed at Depot. The RCMP has undertaken a case study to examine the benefits of using a firearm simulator vs. live firearms in training. According to Mr. Kratzig, the results of the case study show that by the final firearm qualifying reshoot test, the mean score of those trained on the firearm simulator was actually higher than the mean score for those trained using live firearms. This evidence supports synthetic firearms training; a bullet does not need to come out of a gun in order to develop proper shooting skills.\n\nAcademic and research literature supports the perceived benefits of simulator training. Past research has demonstrated that performance is enhanced when cadets are exposed to a dynamic training environment, with innovative technology. There are also other benefits to using simulators in training: they can reduce instructional hours because the technology is programmed to deliver instruction and there is a lot less wear and tear on equipment.\n\nMr. Kratzig noted that the RCMP is using simulation technology in other areas. Depot has eight driving simulators that are being used for defensive driving training for new recruits. In cases where experienced officers have been found to be driving too fast when responding to calls for service, these officers are re-trained on driving simulators. It was found that the approach improved the officers' driving skills.\n\nSimulated training allows for the transferability of skills for basic decision making. RCMP Depot is currently working on using simulators in a number of projects including to test police officers in the field using virtual worlds.\n\nTraining for Future Officers and Integration of Technologies, Current Reality, and Future Perspectives in Quebec\n\nDanielle-Claude Bélanger, Director, École nationale de police du Québec\n\nDanielle-Claude Bélanger provided an overview on ow technology is integrated into the training continuum followed by policing students at the École nationale de police du Québec (ENPQ) in Quebec. Technology is integrated at various stages of a trainee's curriculum. The ENPQ is currently using a MOODLE portal, a free software platform used by their academic partners, to house learning materials and activities for their students, as well as resources for their instructors. Students may access training modules 24/7. Ms. Bélanger noted that in the near future, ENPQ will be offering multimedia courses through MOODLE and multimedia PowerPoint presentations online.\n\nAccording to Ms. Bélanger, ENPQ has been looking to integrate simulators into various aspects of their training programs. ENPQ is already using cockpit driving simulators to allow recruits to learn in a dynamic real world environment. They are hoping for some technological changes that would see lightweight, table top simulators used for independent learning by students in order to optimize learning time. This would be followed up by coaching and supervised training using the cockpit simulators. The goal is to ensure independent learning and knowledge transfer in a dynamic format.\n\nENPQ has had a centre for research in place for the past two years. The research centre is currently examining the best method to assess and follow up on student performance so the best recruits can be identified to police services. Ms. Bélanger noted that every competency included in a learning activity is evaluated in order to support trainers in their efforts to develop students. ENPQ has made it easy for students to track their performance and obtain immediate feedback on progress. Soon, student evaluations will be made available on the ENPQ Moodle portal, which will allow instructors to track the performance of students in real time. This will also reduce the administrative burden of calculating grades and managing the distribution of results to students.\n\nEnhanced Education for Police Recruits in Ontario (EEPRO)\n\nAngela McGonigal, Issues and Special Project Lead, Ontario Police College.\n\nAngela McGonigal provided an overview of the Enhanced Education for Police Recruits in Ontario (EEPRO) project. The project began with input from the Ontario Police College's (OPC) Advisory Committee regarding the future of policing and how to professionalize policing. The Advisory Committee asked that the EEPRO project be carried out in two phases:\n\nDevelop a scope and vision for the future of policing in Ontario, including a literature review, data collection, jurisdictional scan and \"quiet\" consultations; and\n\nDesign and development of the future of policing.\n\nThe EEPRO project included an examination of whether or not recruits should be required to have a post-secondary degree in order to be a police officer. A literature review was conducted as part of the EEPRO and focused on the benefits a post-secondary education has on police officer job performance. The review found the most significant benefit of post-secondary education for police officers is enhanced communication skills, as the ability to communicate effectively is integral to all police work.\n\nPolice recruits across British Columbia are already required to have more than a secondary school education. In the USA, police recruits require grade 12 or some form of post-secondary education.\n\nMs. McGonigal noted that there are several drawbacks to requiring all police recruits to have a post-secondary education, including increased competition for promotions, and limiting the diversity and inclusiveness of the policing workforce. Others have argued police officers should all be required to have a post-secondary degree because of the high salaries they receive; other professionals making comparable salaries are required to have at minimum a post-secondary education. It was also noted that there may not be a reason to make post-secondary education a requirement as 80% of today's recruits have attained this level of education.\n\nBased on this information, the following are possible options for recruit education requirements:\n\nThe OPC would become a degree-granting institution and the basic cadet training would provide credits towards an undergraduate degree;\n\nCompetencies of the job would dictate the minimum education requirements of recruits; or\n\nRecruits would be required to complete two years of university and two years of college.\n\nMs. McGonigal noted that the OPC is also considering whether police should be self-governed in Ontario. There are various benefits to self-governance including allowing police to have the autonomy to control standards of practice and entry requirements of recruits without an act of parliament. At the same time, the oversight of complaints and discipline are already well regulated through the Police Service Act, Office of the Independent Police Review Director and the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) and there appears to be little reason to change current practices. Self-governing policing must be considered in the broader context of the future of policing in Ontario if it is to be implemented.\n\n\"This conference was definitely worth my time… the information sharing is extremely valuable.\"\n\nThe Way Forward Discussion Summary\n\nThe Summit concluded with a discussion around the next steps for police training in Canada. The discussion was structured around the four overarching themes raised during discussions at the Summit:\n\nWe do not appear to have a clear or consistent handle on the true cost of training. Can this continue to be justified in an Economics of Policing world?\n\nThere was unanimous agreement that we do not know the cost of police training in Canada. What is included in these costs must first be agreed on in order to ensure calculations are consistent across the policing industry.\n\nWe have years of evidence that technology-enhanced learning and blended delivery can produce equivalent or better learning and/or performance outcomes at moderately to greatly reduced costs. Are we seizing upon this opportunity to the full extent available to us?\n\nWhile it was agreed that police training has come a long way in adopting new technologies and training delivery methods, there was consensus that more could be done. The actual cost savings of these methods must be determined before other opportunities are exploited. The development of more technology-enhanced learning depends greatly on the availability of appropriate funding and support from management.\n\nThe Victoria Police experience demonstrates what can be achieved when truly faced with the power of consequence. There is significant innovation occurring across the country in police training and education, but, innovators need broader support and the collective policing community needs to benefit more fully from these innovations.\n\nThe Victoria Police stated that operational expectations could not be met unless their approach to training changed. Questions were raised as to whether the cost of not adopting technology-enhanced learning is truly understood, if the power of such consequence can be conveyed and how the understanding of these consequences can be measured.\n\nThe functions of the police training industry must be clearly outlined. The importance of education and the long-, medium-, and short-term outcomes must be communicated effectively. It was suggested that a multidisciplinary approach be taken to address issues with the bureaucracy.\n\nInnovation isn't about one bright person who has a great idea; it's about a whole system recognizing it. CPKN is taking steps to rejuvenate its Advisory Committee in order to address issues of police training efficiency and effectiveness in Canada.\n\nWe all seem to recognize that the demands for continuous learning among police officers, civilian specialists, and police leaders continue to grow and strain the energies and capacities of individuals and agencies alike. At the same time, we appear to still accept obsolete methods within our education and training systems and in our finance and accounting systems... because change is difficult?\n\nIt was agreed that the policing industry is generally resistant to change and old methods often die hard. If changes are to be made to the policing system as a whole, financial and accounting experts must be engaged in the conversation.\n\n5. Deliverables and Next Steps\n\nAs a result of this Summit, two clear deliverables emerged:\n\nResearch\n\nPublic Safety Canada will pursue research around common language and the cost of training.\n\nContinuing the Conversation\n\nCPKN has committed to providing a means for delegates and others in the Canadian police community to continue the conversation about the economics of policing and emerging issues around police training and education.\n\nTo that end, a LinkedIn group, The Economics of Policing: Police Education and Learning Group has been established. All delegates will be sent an invitation (via LinkedIn) to join the group. Members are encouraged to use this forum to ask questions, share knowledge, and generate discussions on the issues impacting police training in the context of the larger Economics of Policing dialogue.\n\nCPKN's National Advisory Committee will also play a role in engaging the community in further discussions on this topic.\n\n6.
