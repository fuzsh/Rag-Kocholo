A typical storm or flood that cost roughly $8 million in the early 1970’s now costs over $110 million.\n\n5% of GDP\n\nOver the last decade, the average cost of weather-related disasters and catastrophic losses each year has risen to the equivalent 5-6% of annual GDP growth.\n\nCOSTS ARE PILING UP\n\nReducing emissions is critical to contain future damages, but past global emissions mean Canadians face looming costs on the horizon.\n\n1,800,000\n\nHOUSEHOLDS AT RISK\n\n10 per cent of households—1.8 million—are currently at very high risk of flooding.\n\nCritical\n\ninfrastructure\n\nRoads, power lines and public buildings across Canada are vulnerable to climate-related impacts.\n\n$601,000,000\n\nLOST ECONOMIC OUTPUT\n\nThe 2013 southern Alberta floods caused a $601 million loss of economic output due to employment disruption.\n\nIT’S TIME TO ADAPT\n\nTo manage climate risks and capitalize on opportunities, governments, investors, business leaders and individuals must take action—before disaster strikes.\n\nInvesting in resilience pays off.\n\nLimits impacts to businesses, workers and the economy.\n\nProtects nature.\n\nImproves health and well-being.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe uncertainty inherent in climate change requires acting decisively on what we already know while also developing improved foresight.\n\nRead our detailed recommendations.\n\nDramatically scale up public investment in adaptation, given economic and other benefits.\n\nWork with other governments in Canada to improve efficiency and coordination.\n\nSystematically enhance disclosure of physical climate risks to mobilize planning and investment decisions."
