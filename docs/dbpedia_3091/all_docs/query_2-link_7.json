        "text": "Globally, Canada is rated very high for having an excellent quality of life, a well-developed public education system, and access to healthcare. In 2020, Canada was ranked second as the best country (overall) in the world by the U.S. News., dominating the rankings with high scores in the quality of life, citizenship and business categories. Some other important factors that make Canada an attractive country on the global stage are its multicultural population and welcoming immigration policies.\n\nMoving to a new country is not only a huge life decision but also requires a substantial financial commitment. In this article, we will share the total cost breakdown for a few key types of applications – Express Entry, Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP), a study permit, and a working holiday visa.\n\nCost of applying for immigration to Canada through Express Entry and the PNP\n\nGenerally speaking, as an individual applicant, you would need approximately $15,500 CAD to immigrate to Canada. Couples would need around $21,000 CAD while families with children will require between $25,000 to $30,000 CAD. The table below provides a detailed breakdown of expected immigration costs.\n\nLast updated on May 4, 2023; all figures in CAD.\n\nFee Type Notes Individual Couple Couple + 1 Child Couple + 2 Children Language tests (IELTS, CELPIP, TEF, or TCF) Average cost. 300 600 600 600 Educational Credential Evaluation (ECA) Cost excluding international courier delivery charges. 200 400 400 400 Biometrics Charges for 2 or more people remain the same provided all members are applying at the same time and place. 85 170 170 170 Medical exams Average cost; fee varies by country. 100 200 300 400 Application processing fee 850 1,700 1,930 2,160 Right of permanent residence fee 515 1,030 1,030 1,030 Miscellaneous fees (police certificate, transcripts, courier delivery, photos, notaries, translations, etc.) Average (assumed) cost. 250 500 600 700 Settlement funds Not applicable for Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 13,757 17,127 21,055 25,564 TOTAL 16,057 21,727 26,085 31,024\n\nThose applying through the PNP, are required to pay additional application fees based on the province they are applying to.
