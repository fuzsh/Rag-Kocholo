        "text": "Not to be confused with Place du Canada (Montreal), Canada Place (Edmonton), or Place Canada (Tokyo).\n\nCanada Place is a building situated on the Burrard Inlet waterfront of Vancouver, British Columbia. It is the home of the Vancouver Convention Centre, the Pan Pacific Vancouver Hotel, Vancouver's World Trade Centre, and the virtual flight ride FlyOver Canada. The building's exterior is covered by fabric roofs resembling sails. It is also the main cruise ship passenger terminal for the region, where cruises to Alaska originate. The building was designed by architects Zeidler Roberts Partnership in joint venture with Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership and DA Architects + Planners.\n\nCanada Place can be reached via the SkyTrain line at the nearby Waterfront Station terminus or via West Cordova Street in Vancouver. The white sails of the building have made it a prominent landmark for the city, as well as drawing comparisons to the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia and the Denver International Airport in Denver, Colorado.\n\nThe structure was expanded in 2001 to accommodate another cruise ship berth. In 2009/10, for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada Place served as the Main Press Centre.\n\nHistory\n\nCanada Place was built on the land which was originally the Canadian Pacific Railway's Pier B-C. Built in 1927, its primary purpose was to serve CPR and other shipping lines trading across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 1978 Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments commenced planning for development of convention, cruise ship and hotel facilities. Four years later, the Government of Canada created a crown corporation, Canada Harbour Place Corporation (known as Canada Place Corporation until 2012), to develop the Canada Place project on the Pier B-C site. Construction began when Queen Elizabeth II arrived on the Royal Yacht Britannia with Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada and William R. Bennett, Premier of BC to initiate the first concrete pour.\n\nDuring Expo 86, the Canada Pavilion at Canada Place was opened by Prince Charles and Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister of Canada. Among the largest and most elaborate pavilions presented by any nation at any World's Fair, the Canada Pavilion hosted more than 5 million visitors prior to the October 13, 1986 closing date.\n\nCanada Place Corporation (CPC), a Crown agent, continues to act as the coordinating landlord for Canada Place facilities.\n\nEvents\n\nThroughout the year many community events are held at and hosted by Canada Place.\n\nPan Pacific Vancouver\n\nThe Pan Pacific Vancouver opened in January 1986 and has 503 rooms and suites, two restaurants, and a lounge.\n\nThe Hotel is operated by Pan Pacific Hotels and Resorts.\n\nHeritage Horns"
