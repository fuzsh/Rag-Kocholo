        "text": "Canada Gazette, Part I, Volume 157, Number 43: Canadian Navigable Waters Act Fees Regulations\n\nOctober 28, 2023\n\nStatutory authority\n\nCanadian Navigable Waters Act\n\nSponsoring department\n\nDepartment of Transport\n\nREGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS STATEMENT\n\n(This statement is not part of the Regulations.)\n\nExecutive summary\n\nIssues\n\nTC’s NPP services are currently provided to users free of charge, so all service delivery costs are borne by Canadian taxpayers. TC resources are strained to maintain existing service levels. Fees would help to shift some of the cost on to the beneficiaries of NPP services, thereby reducing the subsidization burden on taxpayers and the impact on TC resources.\n\nBackground\n\nThe NPP is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the CNWA. The NPP helps keep Canada’s navigable waters open for transport and recreation by regulating works and obstructions that may interfere with navigation in Canada’s navigable waters.\n\nApplications for approval of works\n\nThe NPP receives applications, conducts assessments, and issues approvals to construct, place, alter, rebuild, remove, or decommission a work in navigable waters. Such works can range from private installations on recreational waterfront property to works associated with large-scale international mining operations. During the assessment phase of the review, the NPP may develop project-specific requirements for mitigating the potential impacts to navigation. This may include terms and conditions that would be attached to any approval issued for the work. Possible compliance requirements may be identified, such as on-site inspections by NPP staff during or after the construction of the work. Depending on the type of project proposed, the nature and degree of impacts, and its location, an impact assessment pursuant to the Impact Assessment Act and consultation with the public and Indigenous peoples may be required. The assessment would be conducted by the Impact Assessment Agency unless the proposed work is on federal lands in which case TC would lead the assessment. In either case, the NPP and other TC groups would provide input to the impact assessment.\n\nWorks approvals are granted to a diverse mix of proponents, including industry, private individuals, Indigenous peoples and organizations, federal departments, provincial and territorial governments, and municipalities. These entities benefit from the economic development of Canada’s natural resources; the use of navigable waterways for commercial and other transportation purposes; the opportunity to enjoy recreational activities along the country’s navigable waterways, such as the use of local swim areas, slalom courses, nautical sports jumps, and boat-launching ramps; the use of waterways to exercise Indigenous rights; and/or the opportunity to contribute to the construction of public infrastructure.\n\nThe NPP approves many applications for works which are stand-alone undertakings by proponents (e.g. a raft, a boathouse). The NPP also approves works which are components of larger projects (e.g. barge facilities, a road at a mine). With larger projects, the NPP only approves the individual works that may interfere with navigation, not the project as a whole or other activities that may be part of the project. For example, the NPP would not approve all components or activities of a wind generating tower, rather they would only focus on the elements of the work that may interfere with navigation, such as a tower component that is sunk into the seabed and bolted into place.\n\nApplications for exemption of navigable waters from prohibited activities\n\nThe CNWA prohibits the following activities:\n\nThrowing or depositing floating materials likely to interfere with navigation in any navigable water or that flows into any navigable water (e.g. disposal of waste from logging activities);\n\nThrowing or depositing materials liable to sink to the bottom of a navigable water where there is not a minimum depth of 36 m of water at all times (e.g. dumping of mine tailings); and\n\nDewatering that lowers the water level of a navigable water or any part of a navigable water to a level that extinguishes navigation for vessels of any class that navigate, or are likely to navigate, the navigable water in question.\n\nThe Governor in Council (GIC) has authority to exempt navigable waters from the application of these prohibitions through an Order in Council (OIC) if it is in the public interest to do so. The NPP shepherds applications by project proponents through the OIC process. Many federal and provincial departments, as well as agencies, may become involved in this process. Extensive public consultation and Indigenous consultation are required, and an environmental review may also be required.\n\nTypically, OICs are only sought by proponents for major resource development projects. It is the responsibility of the proponent to compile the baseline research required for the NPP to conduct a triage and prepare the necessary documents related to the OIC. The NPP will develop the Minister’s recommendation (the official request for an exemption from the Minister of Transport to the GIC), based on the information and evidence submitted.\n\nExemptions of a navigable waterway from prohibited activities apply only to that waterway for that activity, not to other activities that may be part of a larger project, and which do not impact navigable waters.\n\nMinor works in any navigable water\n\nThe CNWA provides the Minister of Transport with the power to make orders. The Minor Works Order allows for works to be built without review or approval if they meet the criteria for the applicable class of works, as well as specific terms and conditions for construction. Proposed works that meet the criteria and requirements found in the Minor Works Order do not require approval from the NPP and would not be subject to fees under the proposed Regulations.\n\nFee modernization at Transport Canada\n\nThe introduction of fees for the review of an application under the CNWA is part of TC’s Fee Modernization initiative. This project aims to increase revenues for the Department while providing improved client service experiences through digitalization, simplified fee structures, consistent processes, and clear service standards. The initiative is grounded in the Service Fees Act (SFA), which represents the Government’s commitment to modernizing its services and delivering value to Canadians, as well as the Policy on Service and Digital which was implemented to, among other things, articulate how Government organizations manage service delivery, information, and data. The project is part of a broader transformation plan to modernize laws, regulations, rules and standards while ensuring TC continues to uphold safety and security and to support innovation in the transportation sector.\n\nThe proposed fees for the review of an application under the CNWA would adhere to the requirements of the SFA and its related instruments, such as the Directive on Charging and Special Financial Authorities. In line with these requirements, TC developed a fee proposal, which was published online for public review and comment in November 2020.\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of the proposed Regulations is to recover a portion of the costs of providing the service of assessing and processing applications for CNWA approvals of works or applications for CNWA exemptions from prohibited activities. Currently, no fees are charged to project proponents to review an application for an approval or an exemption. The proposed Regulations would charge those that benefit from these services and would therefore reduce costs to Canadian taxpayers.\n\nDescription\n\nTC is proposing to introduce fees for\n\nthe review of an application for approval of a work, where TC has determined that the work may interfere with navigation in navigable waters and an approval would be required before a project could proceed; and\n\nthe review of an application for an exemption from the prohibition of dewatering navigable waters or depositing and throwing certain materials into navigable waters, where TC has determined that an exemption would be required by the GIC before a project could proceed.\n\nFees to review an application for approval of a work\n\nA fixed fee would be charged for the review of works that are subject to the requirement to apply for an approval. It is important to note that the fee is not for the granting of the approval itself and would not be refunded if an approval was denied. The fee would be payable after TC has notified the proponent that the application has been properly completed and submitted. Projects requiring multiple works would be billed for each individual work requiring an approval, so that total charges are proportional to the effort expended by TC for larger projects.\n\nThree fee categories are proposed for review of applications for approval of works:\n\nCategory 1 with a fee of $500 per application review;\n\nCategory 2 with a fee of $1,400 per application review; and\n\nCategory 3 with a fee of $4,300 per application review.\n\nMore detail on the three fee categories is presented below in Table 1. TC has developed a list called the Work Types List, which is comprised of all possible works which may be approved and categorizes each work as belonging to either Category 1, Category 2, or Category 3. The list can be found in Schedule 1 of the proposed Regulations.\n\nCategorization of the works was determined based on construction methods, industry practices, size of the work, likely impacts to the waterway, and level of effort to review the application. The ability of the project proponent to absorb fees was also considered, hence differentiated (lower) pricing is proposed for works often undertaken by individuals, homeowners, and cottagers such as rafts, as well as certain types of aquaculture facilities, which are often owned by individuals or very small businesses.\n\nWhile terms and conditions associated with a CNWA approval may be time-limited, the approval itself does not expire. Therefore, the fees payable for review of applications for approval of works are payable only once, at the time of initial application, after the NPP officer has accepted the application for review and there is no renewal fee. Additionally, fees would not be charged for the authorization or approval of emergency works, nor for any administrative amendments to terms and conditions (such as extensions to the validity period), nor to other elements of an existing approval.\n\nThe proposed categories, examples of works in each category, proposed fees and cost recovery rates are summarized below in Table 1, while a more detailed list can be found in Schedule 1 of the proposed Regulations. The proposed cost recovery rates were determined based primarily on a client’s ability to pay. Applications for Category 1 works are often submitted by individuals, therefore a relatively low-cost recovery rate of 14% is proposed. The rate climbs to 40% for Category 2 works as applications for these are more commonly requested by commercial or government clients. Category 3 works have the highest proposed rate (60%) as these higher complexity works are usually associated with large-scale commercial, industrial, or public sector projects whose proponents have the ability to absorb higher fees.\n\nFees for applications for an exemption\n\nA fixed fee would also be charged for TC’s review and processing of an application to exempt a waterway or waterways from a prohibition. This work includes navigation impact assessments, input required by NPP officers towards parallel processes, if required (i.e. impact assessment per the Impact Assessment Act, Indigenous and public consultation) as well as shepherding the application through the OIC process.\n\nThe fee would be payable after TC has confirmed that an exemption would be required in order for the activity to proceed, and TC has notified the proponent that the application has been properly completed and submitted. TC is able to confirm if an exemption is required based on the information contained in the proponent’s application. This includes a description of the project, information on the anticipated impacts to navigation, a description of alternatives considered, consultation information, an environmental assessment, and rationale in support of an exemption. This information allows TC to determine whether an application involves an activity subject to subsection 24(1) of the CNWA.\n\nIt is important to note that the fee is not for the granting of the approval itself and would not be refunded if an exemption request were denied by the GIC. An application for an exemption from prohibited activities would have a fee of $66,000 imposed that would, on average, allow the NPP to recover 100% of its cost to review and process an application for exemption. This fee reflects the high proportion of privatized benefit of the service to the proponent.\n\nTable 1: Navigation Protection Program — Proposed cost recovery fees\n\nTable 1 represents each full fee amount starting in the fourth year after the coming into force of the Regulations. Fee category Fee category description Examples of work types Fee payable per application for approval reviewed table a1 note a Estimated cost to TC to provide service Cost recovery rate Category 1 Low complexity works that do not meet the criteria to be considered a Minor Work, and are often associated with, but not limited to\n\nhomeowner/cottager applications\n\nmulti-work projects with a number of identical small works in close proximity\n\nLow complexity works that do not meet the criteria to be considered a Minor Work, and are often associated with, but not limited to\n\nraft, boathouse, recreational slipway / boat-launching ramp\n\nhelicopter logging, scientific equipment\n\n$500 $3,510 14% Category 2 Other low complexity works Dredging, aerial cable, aquaculture facility — other than finfish, and commercial dock (jetty, pier, wharf) $1,400 $3,510 40% Category 3 High complexity works Aquaculture facility — finfish, bridge and terminal $4,300 $7,220 60% Exemption Exemption from prohibited activities Dewatering a navigable waterway, throwing and depositing of certain materials $66,000 $66,000 100%\n\nIt is important to note that proposed works that do not require review and approval from the NPP, such as minor works, would not be subject to fees.\n\nPhasing in of fees\n\nThe proposed fees for review of an application for approval of a work would be phased in gradually as noted below and in Table 2.\n\nUpon the coming into force of the proposed Regulations, fees would be payable at a price equivalent to 55% of the full fee listed in the proposed Regulations. The full fee is indicated as item 4 of the fees table in the proposed Regulations.\n\nBeginning April 1, 2025, fees would be payable at a price equivalent to 70% of the full fee listed in the proposed Regulations.\n\nBeginning April 1, 2026, fees would be payable at a price equivalent to 85% of the full fee listed in the proposed Regulations.\n\nBeginning April 1, 2027, fees would be payable at a price equivalent to 100% of the full fee listed in the proposed Regulations.\n\nOn April 1, 2028, and on April 1 in each subsequent year, the fees would be adjusted annually, based on the applicable Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by Statistics Canada.\n\nThe fee for application for an exemption would not be phased in. The full fee amount would be payable upon coming into force of the proposed Regulations, and CPI adjustment would occur on April 1, 2024, and every April 1 thereafter.\n\nTable 2: Phase-in schedule for proposed fees Period Fee amount as % of full price (for works) Fee payable for Category 1 works Fee payable for Category 2 works Fee payable for Category 3 works Fee payable for exemptions Coming into force of the Regulations to March 31, 2024 55% $275 $770 $2,365 $66,000 April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025 55% $275 $770 $2,365 $66,000 + annual CPI adjustment April 1, 2025, to March 31, 2026 70% $350 $980 $3,010 $66,000 + annual CPI adjustment (compounded) April 1, 2026, to March 31, 2027 85% $425 $1,190 $3,655 $66,000 + annual CPI adjustment (compounded) April 1, 2027, to March 31, 2028 100% $500 $1,400 $4,300 $66,000 + annual CPI adjustment (compounded) April 1, 2028, to March 31, 2029 100% + annual CPI adjustment $500 + annual CPI adjustment $1,400 + annual CPI adjustment $4,300 + annual CPI adjustment $66,000 + annual CPI adjustment (compounded) April 1, 2029, onwards 100% + annual CPI adjustment (compounded) $500 + annual CPI adjustment (compounded) $1,400 + annual CPI adjustment (compounded) $4,300 + annual CPI adjustment (compounded) $66,000 + annual CPI adjustment (compounded)\n\nConsultation\n\nConsultations on the NPP fee proposal began on November 25, 2020, with the public posting of the fee proposal document on the TC “Let’s Talk Transportation” website. The fee proposal was also emailed to 378 stakeholders and 989 Indigenous Nations/communities and organizations contacts. The 60-day consultation period was extended to 80 days to accommodate the holiday period and concluded February 12, 2021.\n\nThe stakeholders and Indigenous peoples who would be generally affected by the proposed fees include the aquaculture industry, mining, energy and forestry sectors, boating associations, marinas, various levels of government, and Indigenous Nations/communities and organizations.\n\nTo support engagement and elicit meaningful input from stakeholders and Indigenous peoples, virtual consultation sessions were held by Webex in December 2020, January 2021, and May 2021. TC solicited feedback from those who attended these sessions on the following topics:\n\nthe proposed fee design and pricing structure;\n\nthe types of works included in each Fee Category;\n\nthe impact of the fees on affected parties; and\n\nthe proposed service standards.\n\nDuring the consultations, TC received 37 written submissions and two comments through its “Let’s Talk Transportation” website from industry (aquaculture, mining and energy, beef producers), Indigenous communities, and different levels of government (federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal). These same stakeholder groups also provided comments during the virtual sessions. Details about the consultation and the feedback received were published online in a report entitled “What we heard: Public consultation on introducing fees for the Navigation Protection Program.”\n\nAs a result of consultation feedback, four themes emerged that necessitated further analysis to determine whether changes to the proposed fees were warranted:\n\nTiming of fee implementation;\n\nPricing for aquaculture works;\n\nApplication of fees by request type; and\n\nFee exemptions.\n\nThese themes, and how TC addressed the concerns raised from each stakeholder category, are discussed below.\n\nAquaculture sector\n\nParticipants from the aquaculture sector opposed the proposed NPP fees. They provided general feedback indicating that they already pay taxes/various fees to run their businesses and new fees would limit the growth of the aquaculture industry. They also noted the administrative burden of completing NPP applications for approval of works and that they have to comply with a wide range of regulations and requirements from all levels of government.\n\nIn particular, the aquaculture sector cited the following concerns with the fee proposal:\n\nthe economic impact fees could have on the industry and the potential impact on their competitiveness in international markets;\n\nthe differences in typical business size and profitability between finfish aquaculture facilities and other facilities such as shellfish aquaculture operations; and\n\nthe perceived incongruity in the types of works that would be subject to Category 3 (i.e. it was considered unfair to include aquaculture works in the same fee category as major energy and public infrastructure works).\n\nThe aquaculture industry pointed out that about 96% of the sector is comprised of small businesses (0–99 employees) and most shellfish farms are run by single individuals or families, with a lower ability to absorb fees. It was also suggested that TC should charge lower fees for modifications to existing works, conduct a comprehensive review and jurisdictional analysis of fees being paid by aquaculture businesses and provide additional information on the costing and pricing analysis that supported the proposed fees. Some shellfish producers expressed concern with the significant change of going from no fees to $4,300 and some suggested that the fees could be phased in over a few years to mitigate the impact they would have on the growth of the industry. The sector also noted the challenges that it is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including loss of upstream customer revenues.\n\nTC response\n\nIn response to the concerns raised by the aquaculture industry, TC moved shellfish and other aquaculture facilities, such as marine plants, sea urchins and cockles, from Category 3 ($4,300) to Category 2 ($1,400), leaving finfish aquaculture facilities in Category 3. The proposed pricing for aquaculture facilities is thus as follows:\n\nAquaculture facility — other than finfish — $1,400\n\nAquaculture facility — finfish — $4,300\n\nTC determined that this change would be appropriate because\n\nShellfish farmers have been particularly impacted by COVID-19 due to the closure of food service establishments. For example, in winter 2020 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, shellfish farmers in British Columbia (B.C.) were losing an estimated $2.4 million a month in sales.\n\nThere are a number of alternate aquaculture species, such as marine plants, sea urchins, abalone, sea cucumber and cockles that are in the early stages of development and commercialization in Canada. They tend to be small producers, with a reduced ability to pay fees, and they form part of an important emerging industry in Canada.\n\nA client’s ability to pay was a consideration in the original fee design and pricing analysis. Using the feedback provided through consultations to better align fees for shellfish and other aquaculture facilities with owners’ ability to pay is consistent with the intent of the fee design and responds to the concerns heard with regard to the impact of the proposed fees on small and medium sized shellfish and other aquaculture businesses.\n\nMining and energy\n\nSubmissions from the mining and energy sectors noted that the proposed fee structure was appropriate and reasonable. However, they suggested that the introduction of a fee structure should be done in conjunction with a review of the NPP’s services to ensure the efficient use of resources and reduce the administrative burden on regulated companies. Those two sectors also proposed that when a work includes several components that may create economies of scale (for example a dam with a spillway and water intakes), the project should be treated as one single work for the purpose of issuing an approval and levying a fee. TC was also urged to provide more detailed service standards that include all the steps of the NPP approval process, from the filing of an application to the issuance of the final approval.\n\nTC response\n\nIn developing the fee proposal, TC considered levying a single fee for projects that include several works, rather than billing for each work included in the application which is being reviewed. While the review of several works in a single application may offer some efficiency in the NPP’s review, it is proposed to charge the fee for each individual work because each work requires a separate navigation impact assessment and assessing the combined potential cumulative impact to navigation posed by multiple works represents an additional level of complexity. However, it was determined that, under certain circumstances, an application for an exemption could include more than one waterway if it was related to a single project. In these instances, the fee would be applied only once for the review of the application, rather than for each individual waterway.\n\nThe service standards in the fee proposal — for the review of both an application for a work and an application for an exemption — provide that within five business days of acknowledgement to the proponent of receipt of a complete application that requires an approval or OIC, TC would make available a tracking tool within the NPP external submission website to enable the proponent to track the status of their application. Stakeholders from the mining and energy sector commented that they would prefer to see service standards tied to the time it takes the NPP to review and approve the applications, particularly for those parts of the process for which the NPP has some control over the timelines (i.e. not including impact assessment, consultation with Indigenous people and GIC approval, which are parts of the process over which the NPP does not control the timelines). The proposed service standards were revisited following the consultation; however TC decided not to make any changes for several reasons.\n\nFirst, there are many factors outside the NPP’s control that have an impact on the time it takes to review and approve a particular application. For example, whether the waterway has previously undergone a navigability assessment; if there are other works that may interfere with navigation on the waterway; if comments are received from the public in relation to the proposed work; and the characteristics of the waterway, safety of navigation, and navigation volumes on the waterway.\n\nAdditionally, the NPP data management system, NavInfo, does not currently include a provision to track NPP officers’ time spent on completing the steps in the NPP process for review of applications for works and exemptions. However, as part of the implementation of the fee regime, a time tracking provision is being developed, which will enable TC to better track and analyze the time required by NPP officers to complete the application review process.\n\nAs committed to in the original fee proposal, in the interest of transparency, TC will make available a tracking tool to enable the proponent to track the status of their application and will post the internal timelines that the NPP follows in relation to its review of works and exemption applications.\n\nGovernments\n\nFeedback received indicated that some governmental organizations, such as small and/or rural municipalities, may find it challenging to pay the proposed fees, and that some organizations are already in difficult budget positions. The rationale to charge fees was also questioned for works that do not require changes to navigational aids, and the administrative burden of charging between governments was cited as a reason not to pursue the new fees. Some respondents asserted that fees should not be applied to government-funded infrastructure projects (for example roads and bridges) because these projects ultimately benefit the public. One respondent suggested that a yearly charge could be pursued, instead of fees for various individual approvals, as this could be easier and more efficient to administer.\n\nTC response\n\nTC considered the feedback received from public sector respondents and assessed whether to exempt this class of NPP applicant from the proposed fees. However, TC decided to maintain the existing approach and not exempt any applicant class, including governmental organizations, because\n\nCharging fees to other departments and levels of government is in line with TBS policy, since it promotes equity in the financing of government programs, facilitates more accurate distribution of costs among programs, and encourages the efficient use of available resources within the government.\n\nThe NPP’s application review services still provide benefits to the applicant, even if the work is public infrastructure (e.g. a bridge).\n\nSince the proposed NPP fees are not recurring fees and are not material when viewed in comparison to the cost of most public infrastructure projects, it is not expected that the fees would delay or discourage public infrastructure development, with the caveat that smaller organizations, or frequent applicants to the NPP, may be more impacted financially.\n\nIndigenous Nations/communities and organizations\n\nA variety of views regarding the impacts of the proposed fees on Indigenous and remote communities were heard during the consultation. Certain Indigenous groups suggested offsetting the financial burdens placed on Indigenous communities associated with consultations for applications for approval of works. Indigenous Nations/communities and organizations suggested that they should not pay fees for works that benefit Indigenous people or are related to the pursuit of Indigenous ways of life and the exercise of their constitutionally protected rights. One Indigenous Nation that submitted feedback agreed in principle that the collection of fees, particularly from large industry projects, would provide an opportunity to reduce the costs paid by taxpayers, but felt that the negative impacts of fees charged to Indigenous peoples would outweigh the benefits to Canada as a whole. It was also mentioned that the proposed fees could represent a barrier for the economic development of Indigenous peoples and that the public-private benefit assessment used to develop the fees did not consider the Indigenous peoples’ relationship to navigable waters. Indigenous Nations/communities and organizations also encouraged TC to more closely examine how the proposed fees might affect them.\n\nTC response\n\nTC recognizes that the proposed fees would likely have mixed impacts on Indigenous communities. Imposing fees ensures that those who create interferences to Canadians’ and Indigenous people’s right to navigate are responsible for costs associated with an application review for the interference. Despite the suggestions, TC is not proposing to exempt projects constructed by Indigenous communities from fees primarily because Indigenous applicants receive the same benefits of the NPP’s application review services as other clients. Moreover, TC fee regulations generally do not include fee exemptions for specific classes of service recipients.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n\nStakeholders, particularly in the aquaculture sector, raised concerns about both the timing of the consultation and eventual fee implementation given the current economic climate and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and indicated that imposing new fees at this time could be damaging to business and competitiveness. Of note, shellfish farmers have been particularly impacted by COVID-19 due to the closure of food service establishments. In winter 2020 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, shellfish farmers in BC were losing an estimated $2.4 million a month in sales.\n\nTC response\n\nTC is proposing to address the underlying concerns about the timing of fee implementation in light of the current economic climate and COVID-19 pandemic effects by introducing most fees gradually, through a phase-in period.\n\nThe proposed fees for the review of an application for works would be phased in over approximately three years (2023–2026), for all applicants as follows:\n\nUpon coming into force of the proposed Regulations — 55% of full proposed fee;\n\nAfter 1 full fiscal year — 70% of full proposed fee;\n\nAfter 2 full fiscal years — 85% of full proposed fee; and\n\nAfter 3 full fiscal years — 100% of full proposed fee.\n\nThis approach was chosen because it would allow additional time for the economic circumstances of impacted stakeholders to improve before the full fees take effect and broadly address the concerns raised by industry. It would also be consistent with the approach taken by TC for several other programs introducing or increasing fees in the current economic environment.\n\nAdditional consultation feedback\n\nApplication of fees by request type\n\nHow the proposed NPP fees would be applied for various application types emerged as a theme, with respondents asking questions surrounding efficiencies and economies of scale that may be realized in certain cases.\n\nSome stakeholders raised concerns with respect to billing the same fee regardless of the proposed activity (e.g. construction, placement, alteration, rebuilding, removal or decommissioning of works). Other stakeholders questioned the application of fees for amendments to existing approvals. Finally, some stakeholders suggested that fees for temporary works should be lower and questioned whether the NPP should lower its fees when reviewing more than one work in a single approval, due to economies of scale.\n\nTC response\n\nTC revised its approach to charging for the removal or decommissioning of a work. Fees would not apply to applications of this type. Charging such fees could unintentionally create an incentive among owners to abandon works, thereby creating unnecessary, prolonged interferences to navigation.\n\nNo action was taken with respect to changing the proposed fees for temporary works because the NPP’s review process and level of effort is identical to permanent works. In addition, the proposed approach of billing for each individual work included in an application was retained because each work requires a separate navigation impact assessment and assessing the combined potential cumulative impact to navigation posed by multiple works represents an additional level of complexity in the NPP officer’s review. No fee was originally proposed for administrative amendments to existing approvals and this approach remains in place (this point was clarified to the aquaculture industry in targeted engagement sessions).\n\nFee exemptions\n\nThe possibility of incorporating into the fee design exemptions for certain classes of users arose as a theme due to concerns raised during consultations regarding budget constraints, public-private benefit, and Indigenous considerations. Several stakeholders reasoned that their applicant class or type of work should be exempted from fees:\n\nPublic works, such as those funded by other federal departments as well as municipal or provincial governments (including works in the Department of Fisheries and Ocean’s [DFO] Small Craft Harbours), since these were perceived to be of purely public benefit and many government organizations raised concerns about their ability to pay; and\n\nWorks where the proponent is Indigenous, or works on traditional Indigenous territory, in the interest of reconciliation or due to the applicant class’ limited ability to pay.\n\nTC response\n\nNo action was taken with respect to exempting certain applicant classes because\n\nCharging fees to the public sector is generally consistent with other TC programs (e.g. TC charges other federal departments and other levels of government for vessel inspections, aircraft maintenance, drone registration, vessel registration, railway inspections);\n\nCharging fees (including to other federal departments/other levels of government) is in line with TBS policy;\n\nAll NPP clients receive the same benefits from the application review services; and\n\nTC generally does not exempt specific classes of service recipients from fees.\n\nAdministrative changes to fee proposal\n\nIn addition to the changes made to the original fee proposal in response to feedback heard during consultations, TC made some administrative adjustments to the proposal. In particular, Appendix B of the published fee proposal was modified. This appendix provided a list of 136 possible work types and the applicable fee category as initially proposed. Changes to this list were necessary to ensure clarity, consistency and cohesion.\n\nTo ensure national consistency in the use of work type names, duplicative or repetitive work types were eliminated.\n\nThe names of the fee categories were changed from Fee Category A1, A2 and B, to Category 1, 2 and 3.\n\nSome works were grouped together as subtypes under a broader work type. For example, dock — commercial, now includes three subtypes: jetty, pier, and wharf.\n\nCertain works were moved between fee categories. For example, after further analysis, fish habitat compensation structure was moved from Category 3 to Category 2 and regrouped with environmental compensation structures, since the review of an application for this work type represents the same level of effort as for environmental compensation structures.\n\nThe complete, refined Work Types List reflects the above adjustments, and can be found in Schedule 1 of the proposed Regulations.\n\nModern treaty obligations and Indigenous engagement and consultation\n\nIn accordance with the Cabinet Directive on the Federal Approach to Modern Treaty Implementation, analysis was undertaken to determine whether the proposed Regulations are likely to give rise to modern treaty obligations. This assessment examined the geographic scope and subject matter of the regulatory proposal in relation to modern treaties in effect and no modern treaty obligations were identified.\n\nInstrument choice\n\nCurrently, there is no fee regime associated to NPP service delivery. This places a heavy strain on TC resources to maintain a consistent level of service and requires Canadian taxpayers to subsidize CNWA application processing services.\n\nNon-regulatory options\n\nAlthough there are non-regulatory options, such as Service Level Agreements (SLAs), that would meet most of the objectives of the proposed Regulations, these were not chosen primarily to reduce the administrative burden on TC’s clients. SLAs are voluntary contractual arrangements that enable the provision of a service in exchange for compensation. A prospective NPP client seeking to construct a work could voluntarily enter into an SLA with TC for NPP application review services. Since TC would charge for the service under the terms of the SLA, the objective of the regulatory fee proposal (i.e. shifting the cost burden from the general taxpayer to the client receiving the service) would be met. However, SLAs require negotiation and ongoing monitoring by both parties. In contrast, paying fees set by regulation is relatively simple and familiar for TC clients, since setting fees by regulation is a standard approach used by all levels of government worldwide.\n\nRegulatory option\n\nInstruments other than regulations, such as standards and policies or SLAs would be insufficient to achieve the outcomes needed. Charging fees would be the most transparent, predictable, and consistent way to ensure that the financial burden of the service delivery costs is balanced more appropriately between service recipients and taxpayers.\n\nFees can only be set using the regulatory authorities provided under the CNWA. Therefore, in order to establish these fees, a regulatory change is necessary. Regulations were also chosen to create a simple and understandable fee structure situated within one instrument (as opposed to multiple service agreements between TC and every owner across the country proposing a work).\n\nRegulatory analysis\n\nBenefits and costs\n\nThe proposed Regulations would enable TC to charge fees when reviewing applications submitted under the CNWA for (1) approval of works; and (2) exemption of a navigable waterway from a prohibition. As a result, proponents who would require such NPP services would incur a total of $11.84 million additional costs from 2024 to 2033 (present value in 2021 Canadian dollars, discounted to the base year of 2024 at a 7% discount rate).\n\nThe proposed fees would be used to recover the costs incurred by TC to provide these services, which are currently funded entirely by Canadian taxpayers. Therefore, the proposed Regulations would rebalance a portion of the costs from Canadian taxpayers to the TC clients who benefit from the services.\n\nAnalytical framework\n\nBenefits and costs associated with the proposed Regulations are assessed by comparing the baseline scenario against the regulatory scenario. The baseline scenario depicts what is likely to happen in the future if the Government of Canada does not implement the proposed Regulations. The regulatory scenario provides information on the intended outcomes of the proposed Regulations.\n\nFollowing the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS)’s Policy on Cost-Benefit Analysis, the scope of this analysis is at the societal level, analyzing costs and benefits attributed to Canadians. Since the introduction of fees for NPP services would result in a rebalancing of costs from taxpayers to those who directly benefit from the proposed Regulations, the costs to users of NPP services/activities would have a neutral impact on Canadian society overall.\n\nThis analysis estimated the impact of the proposed Regulations over a 10-year period from 2024 to 2033.footnote 1 Unless otherwise stated, all values are expressed in present values in 2021 Canadian dollars and discounted to the base year of 2024 at a 7% discount rate.\n\nIt is also important to note that proposed fees presented in Table 1 and 2 above are in 2023 Canadian dollars. For the purpose of this analysis, they have been adjusted to 2021 Canadian dollars using the Conference Board of Canada’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) Forecast.\n\nA detailed cost-benefit analysis report is available upon request.\n\nAffected stakeholders\n\nThe proposed Regulations would affect those who require NPP services. Works approvals are granted to a diverse mix of proponents, including industry, individuals, Indigenous peoples, federal departments, provincial and territorial governments, and municipalities. These entities profit from the economic development of Canada’s natural resources, make use of navigable waterways for commercial and other transportation purposes, enjoy recreational activities along the country’s navigable waterways, use waterways to exercise Indigenous rights, and/or contribute to the construction of public infrastructure. Proponents requesting an exemption of a navigable waterway from prohibited activities are traditionally mining companies, which require the ability to deposit materials, such as waste rock, into a navigable waterway to facilitate the development of projects with significant commercial benefits.\n\nDue to the heterogeneous nature of NPP clients, the impact of the proposed fees on each group, and across individual members of each group, would be quite varied and dependent on the economic circumstances of each individual party.\n\nBased on records in the NPP data management system, NavInfo, most applications submitted to the NPP were for approvals of works. Between 2017 and 2019, the NPP processed between 800 and 1 100 approvals of works per year. Of these approvals, 53% were issued to private sector commercial entities, 36% to various levels of government (with DFO as the federal department with the most approvals), 7% to residential works proponents, which includes cottager associations and private citizens, and 4% to Indigenous peoples.\n\nGeographically, 29% of these approvals were issued in British Columbia, followed by 28% in the four Atlantic provinces, 25% in Quebec, and 18% in Ontario, Manitoba, the territories, and the Prairie provinces collectively.\n\nBaseline and regulatory scenarios\n\nIn the baseline scenario, TC would continue to not charge fees to any users of NPP services, whereas in the regulatory scenario, fees would be charged (with a phase-in approach) on applications to be reviewed for approval of works and for exemption of a navigable waterway from a prohibition. With regard to the review of applications for the approval of works, TC’s internal analysis based on historical data of applications reviewed estimates that, between 2024 and 2033 (i.e. the analytical period), approximately 784 applications for approval would be reviewed and subject to fees each year, spread across the three Fee Categories for review of applications for approval of works. With regard to the review of applications for exemptions, based on anticipated resource development and TC’s past experience with these requests, it was estimated that approximately 3 applications for exemption would be reviewed each year. Table 3 below presents the proposed fees by Fee Category, and the associated estimated number of applications to be reviewed for both approval of works and exemptions.\n\nTable 3: Proposed fees and the estimated number of applications to be reviewed, by fee category Fee category Fees table a3 note a ($) Annual average number of applications to be reviewed Total number of applications to be reviewed (2024–2033) Baseline scenario Regulatory scenario Coming-into-force to March 2025 April 2025 to March 2026 April 2026 to March 2027 April 2027\n\nand onward Category 1 0 248 315 383 450 84 839 Category 2 0 693 882 1,071 1,260 432 4 323 Category 3 0 2,129 2,710 3,290 3,871 268 2 682 Exemption 0 59,412 59,412 59,412 59,412 3 28\n\nSource: Transport Canada\n\nCosts\n\nThe costs imposed on NPP service users were estimated by multiplying the proposed fee for each category and its associated number of applications to be reviewed per year. Using data presented in Table 3 above, the total costs associated with the proposed Regulations would be approximately $11.84 million for the analytical period. More detail is presented in Table 4 below.\n\nTable 4: Total costs for NPP users, by fee category (present values in millions) Fee category Total costs Category 1 $0.25 Category 2 $3.56 Category 3 $6.79 Exemption $1.25 Total $11.84\n\nNote: Numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n\nBenefits\n\nAs previously stated, the proposed Regulations would result in a rebalancing of costs from Canadian taxpayers to users of NPP services. Therefore, the costs imposed on NPP users (i.e. $11.84 million in total) would also be the benefits (i.e. recovered costs) for Canadians.\n\nCost-benefit statement\n\nNumber of years: 10 (from 2024 to 2033)\n\nBase year for costing: 2021\n\nPresent value base year: 2024\n\nDiscount rate: 7%\n\nTable 5: Monetized costs (cost to users of NPP services, present value in millions) Impacted stakeholder Description of cost Base Year: 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028–2032 Final year: 2033 Total (present value) Annualized value Users of NPP services Service fees $1.06 $1.10 $1.25 $1.46 $5.99 $0.97 $11.84 $1.69 All stakeholders Total costs $1.06 $1.10 $1.25 $1.46 $5.99 $0.97 $11.84 $1.69\n\nNote: Numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n\nTable 6: Monetized benefits (cost recovered by TC, present values in millions) Impacted stakeholder Description of benefit Base year: 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028–2032 Final year: 2033 Total (present value) Annualized value Transport Canada Recovered costs from fees paid by users of NPP services and activities $1.06 $1.10 $1.25 $1.46 $5.99 $0.97 $11.84 $1.69 All stakeholders Total benefits $1.06 $1.10 $1.25 $1.46 $5.99 $0.97 $11.84 $1.69\n\nNote: Numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n\nTable 7: Summary of monetized costs and benefits (present values in millions) Impacts Base year: 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028–2032 Final year: 2033 Total (present value) Annualized value Total costs $1.06 $1.10 $1.25 $1.46 $5.99 $0.97 $11.84 $1.69 Total benefits $1.06 $1.10 $1.25 $1.46 $5.99 $0.97 $11.84 $1.69 All stakeholders $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00\n\nNote: Numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n\nQualitative benefits\n\nThe proposed service fees would result in increased equity by transferring a portion of the government’s costs to the primary users of NPP services (i.e. proponents seeking a review of an application for works or an exemption from prohibited activities), rather than the Canadian taxpayer. The proposed fees would help reduce the strain on the Government’s fiscal framework.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nAs previously described, a number of assumptions based on the projection of annual applications to be reviewed have been made to estimate the costs of the proposed Regulations. To address the effect of uncertainty and variability on these assumptions, a sensitivity analysis is conducted, where variables are assigned different values, and outcomes are re-evaluated. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the following variables: discount rates and number of approvals. See Table 8 below for details.\n\nDiscount rates\n\nThe central analysis used a 7% discount rate as recommended by TBS. The sensitivity analysis presents the results should a 3% discount rate have been used, as well as if there was no discounting.\n\nNumber of applications to be reviewed\n\nThe central analysis uses approximately 787 applications to be reviewed each year. The sensitivity analysis presents the results if this number was increased or decreased by 5%.\n\nTable 8: Sensitivity analysis on total costs/benefits (present values in millions) Parameter Total cost/benefit Discount rate Undiscounted $16.20 3% $14.06 7% table b5 note a $11.84 Number of applications to be reviewed − 5% $11.25 Approx. 787 table b5 note a $11.84 + 5% $12.43\n\nDistributional analysis\n\nAs previously described, costs to users of NPP services are not equally distributed among provinces and territories. Overall, NPP users in the Atlantic region would bear about one-third of the total costs, as well as the largest share of costs associated with Category 2, Category 3 and Exemption fees, while NPP users in the Pacific region would bear most of the cost associated with Category 1 fees. Table 9 provides a breakdown of the costs by region.\n\nTable 9: Costs distributed to regions, by fee category (present values in millions) Region Fee category Total costs Share of total costs (%) Atlantic table b6 note a Category 1 $0.02 31.59% Category 2 $1.13 Category 3 $2.06 Exemption $0.53 Sub-total $3.74 PNR table b6 note b Category 1 $0.05 20.35% Category 2 $0.42 Category 3 $1.50 Exemption $0.45 Sub-total $2.41 Pacific table b6 note c Category 1 $0.13 19.35% Category 2 $1.00 Category 3 $1.12 Exemption $0.04 Sub-total $2.29 Quebec Category 1 $0.03 16.19% Category 2 $0.80 Category 3 $0.90 Exemption $0.18 Sub-total $1.92 Ontario Category 1 $0.01 12.52% Category 2 $0.21 Category 3 $1.21 Exemption $0.05 Sub-total $1.48 Total $11.84 100%\n\nNote: Numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n\nSmall business lens\n\nAnalysis under the small business lens concluded that there would be impacts on small businesses associated with the proposed Regulations.footnote 2\n\nGeneral impacts to small business\n\nThe proportion of applications submitted to the NPP by small businesses varies year to year. Most NPP applications are submitted by large or medium-sized companies, or public sector organizations such as other levels of government. Based on a review of applicants to the NPP in fiscal year 2018–19 and publicly available information, 33 small businesses accounted for about 10.6 % of private sector applications. These companies received approvals for 46 applications for works which, under the proposed fee structure, would be subject to Category 1 or Category 2. For purposes of estimating the compliance costs to small business due to the proposed Regulations, it is assumed that 33 small businesses would submit 10.6% of private sector NPP applications for review every year over the analytical time frame, and these would be subject to Category 1 or Category 2. As a result, it was estimated that the proposed Regulations would result in an incremental cost of $0.40 million on small businesses, over the 10-year analytical period, or annualized cost of $57,162 ($1,732 per affected business) [Table 8].\n\nThe number of affected small businesses and the volume of applications to be reviewed from this class of applicant could vary, which would impact the total compliance costs and the amount attributed to each small business. However, since small businesses typically submit applications that would fall into Category 1 and Category 2 which have markedly lower proposed fees compared to Category 3, and NPP fees are not recurring, overall, the burden on small businesses is expected to be limited.\n\nConsiderations for the aquaculture sector\n\nDuring consultations on the fee proposal, the aquaculture industry pointed out that most of the industry is comprised of small businesses (0–99 employees), and most shellfish farms are run by single individuals or families with a lower ability to absorb fees compared to larger companies. Stakeholders expressed concerns that fees could have a negative economic impact on the industry’s competitiveness in international markets and noted that the differences in typical business size and profitability between finfish and shellfish and other aquaculture operations would necessitate a tailored approach.\n\nTo address the aquaculture industry’s concerns and limit the impact to small businesses in this sector, aquaculture facilities have been divided into two distinct types of works.\n\nTo address small business concerns more generally, the fees would be phased in gradually over a three-year period, which would provide additional time before the full fees take effect. In addition, fees would not be charged for the removal or decommissioning of works.\n\nSmall business lens summary\n\nEstimated number of small businesses that apply to the NPP: 33 per year\n\nNumber of years: 10 (2024 to 2033)\n\nBase year for costing: 2021\n\nPresent value base year: 2024\n\nDiscount rate: 7%\n\nTable 10: Compliance costs (present values in millions) Activity Annualized value Present value Service fees\n\n(Category 1 and Category 2) $0.06 $0.40 Total compliance cost $0.06 $0.40\n\nOne-for-one rule\n\nThe one-for-one rule does not apply as there would be no incremental change in the administrative burden on business. Fees are not considered administrative burden. Although the proposal would introduce a new regulatory title, the title would not result in an incremental change in the administrative burden and, therefore, is not counted as a title “IN” for the purposes of the rule.\n\nRegulatory cooperation and alignment\n\nThis regulatory proposal does not have any explicit linkages to international agreements or obligations. However, for the purpose of comparability with NPP services and the proposed fees, other jurisdictions were examined to determine if they provide approval processing or permitting services with respect to works in navigable waters, and if so, how these compare to NPP activities.\n\nIn general, depending on the type of work proposed, approval and permitting requirements range widely. Various types of approvals may be required from federal, provincial/state/territorial or municipal governments, or from other regulators (e.g. Conservation Authorities). TC’s analysis focused on approval and permitting requirements for works in navigable waters where an assessment of impacts to navigation is performed, as this is the primary objective of the NPP’s application review process under the requirements of the CNWA.\n\nTwo international jurisdictions were found to charge fees for approval and permitting services with respect to works in navigable waters where an assessment of impacts to navigation is performed: the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). The analysis also looked at approval and permitting services for domestic works in navigable waters under the jurisdiction of large Canadian Port Authorities. Per the Port Authorities Operations Regulations, 11 ports are not subject to the requirements of the CNWA since they have the capacity to determine whether a work could interfere with navigation themselves, rather than relying on TC. In particular, fees charged by the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority (VFPA) were examined.\n\nThe analysis concluded that the services provided by the other jurisdictions are not directly comparable to the services that the NPP provides. This is because, as noted, the NPP review is focused on impacts to navigation, while the US, UK and VFPA assessments of proposed projects can include other technical and environmental considerations, and consultations. Furthermore, each jurisdiction uses different criteria to define a work or activity, either individually or in groups, making direct comparisons across jurisdictions, or with NPP works and activities, challenging.\n\nSufficient information was also not available for the US, UK or VFPA regarding the costing methodology, proportion of costs recovered or fee pricing considerations to fully compare the fees charged to the proposed NPP fees. The proposed NPP fees were determined by first determining the full cost of the service, then a series of pricing considerations were applied to determine the proposed fee levels.\n\nAlthough the services provided and fees charged by other jurisdictions are not directly comparable, these other jurisdictions still provide pertinent points of reference in regard to fee design and pricing for the review of applications for approval of works, which TC considered in the development of the proposed fee structure for the NPP. Of note, both the UK and VFPA’s pricing structures are based on the type of work, which is aligned with the NPP design. In addition, all jurisdictions examined apply fixed fees (as opposed to hourly or formula-based fees) which is also aligned to the NPP approach, though the UK structure also includes an annual charge element which TC is not pursuing.\n\nThe following provides an idea of the type of projects undertaken in other jurisdictions and associated fees and charges.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nTo ensure that works do not endanger life or property by increasing the risk of flooding or causing harm to the environment, the UK Water Resources Act 1991 prohibits the construction of a structure in, over or under a watercourse which is part of a main river except with the consent of and in accordance with plans and sections approved by the Environment Agency. Since the UK process includes technical and environmental assessments, the regime has a broader scope than the NPP assessment focused on impacts to navigation.\n\nThe UK model features fixed permit application fees for various categories of works, as well as an “annual subsistence activity charge” to recover regulatory costs while the authorization is in force.\n\nThe UK Environment Agency charges $292 (all amounts in Canadian dollars) for an authorization to install an access culvert less than 5 metres in length, plus an annual charge of $117 while the permit is in force. Over a 10-year period, this would equal a total fee of $1,462. Permits for a vehicle bridge cost $1,661 plus $465 annually, for a 10-year total of $6,311, while a permit for a reservoir spillway costs $2,500 plus $640 annually, for a 10-year total of $8,900.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) regulates activities that could obstruct or alter navigable waters of the US under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Authorization is required from the Corps to conduct work in, over, or under navigable waters. The US charges nominal fixed fees based on the type of applicant. Individuals and non-commercial applicants are charged a fee of $13 for a standard individual permit; commercial and industrial applicants are charged a fee of $131. These fees, which could be characterized as nominal, are not charged to federal, state or local governments.\n\nVancouver Fraser Port Authority\n\nThe VFPA is a shared governance organization responsible for the stewardship of federal port lands in and around Vancouver, British Columbia. The VFPA is the permitting authority for projects around Vancouver harbour and in the Fraser and North Fraser Rivers, and it conducts environmental reviews of projects in accordance with Section 82 of the Impact Assessment Act. The VFPA is exempt from the CNWA if the work is done by the port authority or on behalf of the port authority.\n\nThe VFPA’s consideration of project permit applications include technical and environmental reviews and any required municipal, stakeholder and community engagement and consultation with Indigenous peoples. Therefore, the review is broader in scope than the NPP which is focused mainly on impacts to navigation.\n\nThe VFPA groups project types into five categories based on the complexity of the project and the associated review. Category A works are minor in scale and may be temporary in nature, with predictable, minimal potential impacts. This category aligns closely to work types described in the CNWA’s Minor Works Order. No fees are payable to VFPA for an application review for approval in this category, nor are NPP fees proposed for minor works.\n\nCategory B works are also relatively minor in scale, such as shoreline protection, but have attributes requiring additional technical analysis and may require specialized mitigation. A fee of $500 is payable to obtain a permit for works in this category. Category C works include the same type of projects as Category B, but where consultation is required; the fee for a Category C work is $2,500. Categories D and E comprise increasingly complex project types which usually require a variety of supporting technical studies and consultation processes, including major dredging (Category D) and commercial marinas (Category E). Permit fees for Category D and E are $12,500 and $22,500, respectively.\n\nStrategic environmental assessment\n\nIn accordance with the Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals, and the TC Policy Statement on Strategic Environmental Assessment (2013), the strategic environmental assessment process was followed for this regulatory proposal and a Sustainable Transportation Assessment was completed. No important environmental effects are anticipated as a result of this proposal. The assessment took into account potential effects to the environmental goals and targets of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy.\n\nGender-based analysis plus\n\nUsers of the NPP’s services are varied and include a diverse group of proponents, including industry, private individuals, Indigenous peoples, federal departments, provincial and territorial governments and municipalities. The proposed Regulations would benefit Canadian taxpayers and are not expected to have differential impacts to the users of the NPP’s services on the basis of identity factors such as gender, race, sexuality, religion, or others.\n\nAs part of its consultation process, TC heard from a variety of stakeholders including provinces, territories, municipalities, and Indigenous people and communities. TC also heard from industry, including the aquaculture, mining, nuclear, hydropower, oil and gas, cattle and beef industries. No concerns about impacts related to gender or other identity factors were identified.\n\nAs noted, about 96% of the aquaculture industry is comprised of small businesses, with most shellfish farms run by single individuals or families, with a likely lower ability to absorb fees. With this in mind, TC has considered whether the regulatory proposal could disproportionally impact rural communities, small businesses, and aquaculture facilities operated by individuals or families and has considered whether the proposed fees may create barriers to equal participation in the aquaculture industry due to compliance costs. To address any potential impacts, TC adjusted the proposed fees for the aquaculture industry, in particular for the shellfish industry, with a view to minimizing financial impact on smaller businesses and those that tend to be in more rural and remote communities. TC is also proposing a phase-in period for fees, to minimize the impact of the fees on industry in the short term.\n\nThe proposed fees are likely to have a varied impact on Indigenous communities. Imposing fees ensures that those who create interferences to Canadians’ and Indigenous people’s right to navigate are responsible for costs associated with application review for the interferences. A variety of views regarding the impacts of the regulatory proposal on Indigenous and remote communities were heard during consultations. It was suggested that First Nations that apply for approval of works in their traditional territories should be exempted from application processing fees. Certain Indigenous groups suggested a fee exemption could offset the financial burdens placed on Indigenous communities when they participate in consultations in respect of applications for approval of works. TC is not proposing to exempt projects constructed by Indigenous communities from fees primarily because Indigenous applicants receive the same benefits from the NPP’s application review services as all other clients. Moreover, there are no fee exemptions for Indigenous peoples in any TC cost recovery regulations.\n\nTo help offset the financial burdens placed on Indigenous communities when they participate in consultations related to applications for approval of works, contribution funding is available through TC’s Indigenous Participant Funding Program. The objectives of this Program are to:\n\nSupport consultation related to decisions and discussions on proposed policy initiatives related to the CNWA and the Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act (WAHVA) and/or;\n\nProvide capacity support for activities, such as Indigenous-led studies, that promote long-term benefits aligned with the objectives of the CNWA and the WAHVA and/or;\n\nSupport outreach, collaboration and partnership between TC and Indigenous communities and organizations in the implementation of the CNWA and the WAHVA.\n\nImplementation, compliance and enforcement, and service standards\n\nImplementation\n\nThe proposed Regulations would come into force upon registration.\n\nApplications received prior to the coming into force date of the proposed Regulations would not be subject to fees. However, applications received after the coming into force date, and which are subsequently determined by the NPP to be a complete application, and which would require an approval or exemption in order for the project to proceed, would be subject to fees in accordance with the fee phase-in schedule as presented in Table 2 under “Description” above.\n\nPayment would be required after TC has notified the proponent that an application has been properly completed and submitted. Work by the NPP to review an application would not commence until payment is received. TC accepts a number of forms of payment, including online payment, electronic funds transfer, cheque, and in person at a TC Centre. However, it is expected that most applications would be submitted through the NPP external application website, which would include an online payment step.\n\nTC is developing guidance and explanatory materials to ensure that the new fees are applied consistently, and to ensure that users of NPP services clearly understand how and when the fees would be applied, how each work type is defined, and what their responsibilities and liabilities would be under the proposed Regulations. These materials would be ready before the new fees come into force.\n\nIn accordance with the Service Fees Act, as noted, the proposed fees would be indexed annually, based on the applicable Consumer Price Index published by Statistics Canada, beginning on April 1, 2024, for application review for approval of exemptions and April 1, 2028, for application review for approval of works. The inflation-adjusted fee levels and the date they would come into effect would be published in TC’s Fees Report and would be made available annually on the TC website.\n\nCompliance and enforcement\n\nRequirements for compliance and enforcement of the CNWA are already in place under the Act. With respect to the payment of the fees being proposed under these Regulations, any fees owing would constitute a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Financial Administration Act.\n\nService standards\n\nTo support the implementation of the proposed Regulations, TC is currently developing a tracking tool. The proposed service standards – for both an application review for a work and an application review for an exemption – provide that within five business days of acknowledgement to the proponent of receipt of a complete application that requires an approval or OIC, TC will make available a tracking tool within the NPP external submission website to enable the proponent to track the status of their application. The cost of developing this tool is being managed within existing resources.\n\nIn cases where the service standard is not met, a portion of the fee would be remitted to the client in accordance with the Service Fees Act, the Treasury Board Directive on Charging and Special Financial Authorities and TC’s Policy on Remissions.\n\nDonna McLean\n\nDirector\n\nOperations and Regulatory Development\n\nIndigenous Relations and Navigation Protection Program\n\nTransport Canada\n\n330 Sparks Street, 20th Floor, Tower C\n\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nK1A 0N8\n\nEmail: NPPHQ-PPNAC@tc.gc.ca\n\nPROPOSED REGULATORY TEXT\n\nNotice is given that the Governor in Council, under subsection 28(1)footnote a of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act footnote b, proposes to make the annexed Canadian Navigable Waters Act Fees Regulations.\n\nInterested persons may make representations concerning the proposed Regulations within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice.
