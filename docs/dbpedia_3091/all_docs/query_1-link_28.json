        "text": "Unknown\n\nGreat Stay\n\n1st time in Vancouver, stayed Fairmont Hotel. The room had an amazing view over the port, the staff was extremely helpful from check-in to parking to concierge. 8th and 9th floor has their own breakfast buffet on the 9th floor for only the guests on the 8th and 9th with everything you want. In the afternoon we would go up to this place and have cocktails on the balcony. Loved it...\n\nDan\n\nwonderful experience\n\nI would like to commend your staff for their exceptional service. Everyone I interacted with was incredibly friendly, helpful, and professional, which made my stay truly enjoyable. Additionally, the view from my room was absolutely breathtaking and contributed greatly to the overall positive experience. However, I would like to offer some constructive feedback that I believe could enhance future guest experiences: 1. USB or Charging Stations: In today's tech-centric world, having readily available USB or charging stations in the rooms is essential. I found it a bit inconvenient to search for outlets and use my own adapters. Upgrading this amenity would greatly improve convenience for guests. 2. TV Performance: The TV in my room had a noticeably slow processor, which made navigating channels and apps somewhat frustrating. An upgrade to the TV system would enhance the in-room entertainment experience. 3. Cleanliness: While the room was generally clean, I noticed that the counters were not wiped down thoroughly. Ensuring that all surfaces are impeccably clean would contribute to a more comfortable stay. Overall, I had a wonderful time at Fairmont waterfront and appreciate the efforts of your team to make my visit pleasant. I hope these suggestions are helpful and contribute to making future stays even better."
