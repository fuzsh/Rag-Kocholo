Using shore power can significantly reduce air quality and climate change-related air emissions, as well as reduce engine noise.

        "text": "What is shore power?\n\nShore power is a clean technology that enables ships that are fitted with the necessary technical apparatus to shut down auxiliary engines and connect to the land-based electrical grid.\n\nWhat are the benefits of shore power?\n\nShore power:\n\nreduces fuel consumption of container ships while at berth by allowing auxiliary engines to shut down and the ship to be powered by the electrical grid, predominantly hydroelectric based, resulting in lower greenhouse gas and air quality emissions\n\nreduces noise associated with ship engines\n\nOver time, as more ships call are able to connect, and as those ships grow in size and more terminals offer connections, the emission reduction benefits will grow.\n\nWhich terminals and berths at the Port of Vancouver offer shore power services for container ships?\n\nShore power is available to container ships at Centerm container terminal and at Deltaport, Canada’s largest container terminal. The port authority installed shore power with support from Transport Canada and BC Hydro, and in collaboration with the respective container terminal operators Global Container Terminals and DP World Vancouver.\n\nShore power facilities at Centerm berth five have been operational since May 2018, and the container shore power system there is the first in Canada adhering to current international standards for container ships.\n\nShore power at the third berth at Deltaport has been operational since November 2019.\n\nThe port authority will be considering expansion of shore power facilities to additional berths, depending on the uptake by shipping lines, feasibility studies to confirm infrastructure conditions and electrical availability, and funding.\n\nAre there incentive programs for shipping lines that plug into shore power?\n\nShore power capability qualifies a ship calling at the Port of Vancouver for the EcoAction program, providing discounted harbour dues rates and opportunities to be recognized with the Blue Circle Award.\n\nInformation on how to apply is available here on our website at portvancouver.com/ecoaction.\n\nIn addition, as electricity in British Columbia is less expensive per unit of energy than the low sulphur marine diesel fuel that vessels are required to use within 200 nautical miles of our shores, it is possible shore power enabled vessels may see financial savings through reduced fuel costs.\n\nIs plugging into shore power mandatory?\n\nIn Canada, federal legislation does not require that shore power connections be mandatory.\n\nHow has the installations of shore power been paid for?\n\nTotal project funding for the installation of shore power at Centerm and Deltaport is $14 million: this amount is equally split between funding from Transport Canada’s Shore Power Technology for Ports Program and from the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority. The port authority’s portion will be recovered over time from port users through harbor dues.\n\nWhat is the demand for shore power from container ships calling the Port of Vancouver?\n\nThe container terminals with shore power infrastructure at the Port of Vancouver typically have approximately 700 vessel calls per year, around 34 per cent of which have shore power capability. Of this 34 per cent, however, not all are capable of connecting to our shore power infrastructure. Although it seems straightforward, shore power is not a one-size-fits-all system. In fact, there are a number of conditions that affect whether a ship can plug in, including the availability of shore power facilities, the configuration of a terminal’s shore power equipment, the location and limitations of the ship’s shore power connection, and the availability of power from BC Hydro.\n\nMarket forecasts predict that the demand for shore power will rise. Providing infrastructure for the use of cleaner power is an important step. Now that an international standard for shore power technology has been established, we hope to see increased uptake in its use."
