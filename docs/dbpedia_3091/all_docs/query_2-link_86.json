        "meta_description": "Background Coordinated and appropriate health care across sectors is an ongoing challenge, especially at the end-of-life. Population-level data on end-of-life health care use and cost, however, are seldom reported across a comprehensive array of sectors. Such data will identify the level of care being provided and areas where care can be optimized.   Methods This retrospective cohort study identified all deaths in Ontario from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Using population-based health administrative databases, we examined health care use and cost in the last year of life.   Results Among 264,755 decedents, the average health care cost in the last year of life was $53,661 (Quartile 1-Quartile 3: $19,568-$66,875). The total captured annual cost of $4.7 billion represents approximately 10% of all government-funded health care. Inpatient care, incurred by 75% of decedents, contributed 42.9% of total costs ($30,872 per user). Physician services, medications/devices, laboratories, and emergency rooms combined to less than 20% of total cost. About one-quarter used long-term-care and 60% used home care ($34,381 and $7,347 per user, respectively). Total cost did not vary by sex or neighborhood income quintile, but were less among rural residents. Costs rose sharply in the last 120 days prior to death, predominantly for inpatient care.   Interpretation This analysis adds new information about the breadth of end-of-life health care, which consumes a large proportion of Ontario’s health care budget. The cost of inpatient care and long-term care are substantial. Introducing interventions that reduce or delay institutional care will likely reduce costs incurred at the end of life.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nHealth care utilization increases at the end-of-life.[1, 2] The baby boomer cohort effect[3] coupled with an extension of life-expectancy[4] is leading to an increasingly aged population. This has led to great concern among funders and policy makers that elder and end-of-life care will place unprecedented strain on the publicly funded health care system. However, there is little population- and system-wide data to identify the relative contributions of patient characteristics and components of healthcare delivery responsible for healthcare costs at the end of life.[5]\n\nA series of Canadian reports have examined health care use at the end of life in Manitoba[2], British Columbia[6], Saskatchewan[7], and the Atlantic Provinces[8], focusing on specific aspects (e.g., trajectories of death) and specific health sectors. Similar studies have occurred in other jurisdictions.[9–13] In the United States, the Dartmouth Healthcare Atlas has examined variations in end-of-life costs among those with chronic illness who are over 65 years, focusing on hospital, hospice, and physician care.[14, 15] Other studies have examined how various factors such as age, sex, and geographic region affect end-of-life health care expenditures in select populations.[13, 16–20] Very few studies, however, have examined health care use and cost at a population level and across an array of health sectors.[2, 7]\n\nIn this study, we systematically examined both use and costs across a comprehensive set of healthcare sectors in Ontario, Canada, a province of over 13 million residents with nearly universal health care coverage.[21] This includes coverage for all residents for costs associated with acute care hospitalizations, physician visits, emergency room visits, long-term care, home care, and complex continuing care. Medications are also insured for those over 65 years and for those receiving social assistance. To our knowledge, no other study has examined end-of-life health care use and cost for such a large population and for such a breadth of health sectors. We aim to inform health care practitioners on the broad health care use of patients prior to death. At a population level, we look beyond the effects of demographic pressures, to examine the relative contributions of sector-specific health care use to overall costs as death approaches. This study will help policy makers and health planners foresee future needs, and highlight areas where care can be optimized.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study of healthcare utilization and costs among all decedents in Ontario, we found that the cost of health care in the last year of life is high. Decedents, who constituted 0.67% of the population, consumed $4.7 billion dollars annually, or approximately 10% of Ontario’s total health care budget.[24] Compared to an age-sex matched survivor cohort during the same period, decedents consumed 6.7 times greater mean cost. End-of-life cost is driven largely by an increase in inpatient hospital costs in the last 120 days of life. If inpatient costs in this period increased proportionately to all other sectors (86% increase instead of a 502% increase), $2.3b of total cost would be reduced. Some hospitalizations and other health care use near the end-of-life may be appropriate (e.g., for curative efforts when death is not imminent or for when symptom relief cannot be achieved otherwise). Regardless, some hospitalizations at the end of life can be potentially preventable.[25–27] In our study, only 9.1% of hospitalizations in the last year of life were admitted with palliative care as the main patient service or the main responsible diagnosis, accounting for 7.3% of total inpatient cost (data not shown). In Ontario, similar to other Canadian and international jurisdictions, there is a push to care for the aging outside of the hospital setting.[28–32]\n\nWhile over three-quarters of decedents separately used physician services, medications and devices, outpatient laboratory services, and emergency rooms in the last year of life, these services combined contributed less than 20% to total costs. This proportion is lower than other periods of life (26.6% of Ontario’s health care budget is spent on physician services alone).[24] It is apparent that to achieve potentially large cost savings at the end of life, efforts should focus on reducing hospitalizations. Such an approach will likely simultaneously improve the dying experience since most people prefer to spend their last days of life at home.[33–35]\n\nFurthermore, about one in four people at the end-of-life spend time in a LTC home, at a substantial cost, while sixty percent received home care at a much smaller cost (Table 3). It seems prudent, from a direct cost perspective, to identify and target the modifiable predictors of LTC entry so that people may stay at home longer with supports. While those in LTC are generally in higher need, a series of Balance of Care reports in Ontario have shown that there are LTC residents who may be reasonably cared for at home at lower cost.[36] Debates and efforts to care for patients in optimal settings are globally pervasive.[30–32]\n\nThis analysis adds new information about the breadth of health care costs in the last year of life. Very few previous studies have estimated population-level end of life costs[7, 37], and most have been studied in the Canadian context. Our mean cost of more than $50,000 per decedent is higher than previous population-based estimates; studies from British Columbia (2004–06)[16], Saskatchewan (2003–04)[7], and Manitoba (2000–01)[2] estimated averages of $20,705, $31,492, and a median of less than $15,000, respectively. Our estimate was likely higher due to inclusion of several health sectors not included in other studies, and from temporal escalation of costs. For example, the BC study examined only hospital, ambulatory, and prescriptions drug costs, while Saskatchewan added LTC and home care but did not include outpatient clinics, laboratory services, non-physician services, and rehabilitation costs. Other cost estimates have focused on disease specific end-of-life cohorts, and on specific segments (e.g. older adults) of the population.[14, 15, 38–40] Many of these originate from the United States, often limited to those over 65 years of age and do not take into account nursing home costs[37]. Population inclusions varied considerably; cost estimates accordingly range widely from about $40,000 for Medicare and Medicaid patients[41, 42] to $95,776 for people with multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors.[43]\n\nAverage cost peaked for those dying at 65–74 years and declined over 75 years. This pattern is similar to a 2008 study[7], but contrary to older Canadian studies that found increasing cost over 75 years.[2, 44] This discrepancy is potentially explained by healthier populations at older ages (healthy aging hypothesis). We did not find significant differences in end-of-life cost across income quintiles, in contrast with previous Canadian studies.[2, 16] We also found higher care cost for urban residents prior to death, while previous studies have reported mixed results [2, 7, 17]. There are many potential reasons for higher urban costs, including improved access to care, and differences in patient preferences with respect to places of care near the end of life.[45]\n\nStrengths\n\nWe examined a wide array of health care services at the end of life for a large, population-based decedent cohort. This is possible in Ontario, comprising of approximately 40% of the Canadian population, where well-developed health administrative databases are linked at an individual level for a range of publically-funded health services. Costing was estimated accordingly at an individual record level, using detailed costing methodology taking into account the intensity and duration of care.[23] Previous studies have focused on specific populations (e.g. seniors, disease-groups, insurance subscribers) and/or on a select set of health care sectors, and included smaller sample sizes.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study is descriptive in nature, and does not directly address quality of care; nevertheless, it can be inferred that a proportion of health care utilization near the end of life, such as certain emergency room visits, hospital admissions and medications, are potentially preventable and burdensome for the patient. We use administrative databases to capture health care use and direct costs in the last year of life. Each database has limitations in population coverage. For example, the OHIP database, although capturing the vast majority of all physician services, does not include some services provided in provincial psychiatric hospitals and services provided by physicians on an alternate funding plan. The Ontario Drug Benefit program, as another example, provides coverage only to those over 65 years of age and those on social assistance. Our perspective was from the public health care system. Due to lack of data, we did not include the cost of publically subsidized hospices in Ontario. Approximately 2,500 Ontarians die in such hospices annually. Overall, it is thus likely that our estimation that 10% of the health care budget is due to end-of-life costs is an underestimation of the true proportion.\n\nFurthermore, not included are health care use and costs paid out-of-pocket.[46] This includes private assisted-living arrangements, private home care support services, and drugs, devices, and non-physician services not covered by the provincial health insurance. We also did not include the substantial indirect costs that are associated with the dying process, including the costs incurred by informal caregivers.[47] Finally, our study was conducted in a Canadian province with extensive universal coverage; our results may not be generalizable to populations with vastly different health care systems."
