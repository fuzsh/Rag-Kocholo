The developed interactivity approaches are taken into account when designing and analyzing systems. The formalization, systematization and classification of the basic principles of interactivity has been carried out. Influences on objects of activation and execution with defined conditions are shown. The principles of interactive interaction are presented structurally.\n\nThe principle of interactivity based on the characteristics of the object of execution having a memory and being able to adapt, improve and reorganize structurally or functionally in time is considered. The example of an algorithm that implements the multifunctional principle of interactive interaction is given."
