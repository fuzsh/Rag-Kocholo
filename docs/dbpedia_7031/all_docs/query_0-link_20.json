        "text": "Edmonton, Alberta, Saint John’s Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral, 1923\n\nPrehistory\n\nThe first sobor (Church assembly) which formed the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada took place 28 December, 1918, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. This sobor was concerned to provide Orthodox Christian worship to the believers in the Ukrainian language instead of in Church Slavonic. The Ukrainian Brotherhood found a temporary bishop in the person of Metropolitan Germanos (Shehadi), who was a missionary metropolitan of the Antiochian Orthodox Church in the USA. He continued to oversee the early development of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada from the USA until 1924.\n\nEstablishing the parish, 1923\n\nOn 11 November, 1923, the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox parish of Saint John the Baptist began to be organised in Edmonton, Alberta. This was as a consequence of a meeting held at the Mykhailo Hrushevsky Institute in Edmonton for the purpose of founding a parish in Edmonton. During that meeting, some impassioned speeches were delivered by Petro Zvarych (of Vegreville), and by Yuri Dragan (a medical student at the University of Alberta). These speeches were influential.\n\nThis meeting established a Ukrainian Orthodox Brotherhood which in fact included the establishment of the parish itself.\n\nThe founding members were :\n\nA Bodnaruk ; W Cheladyn ; Dr. G Dragan ; J Melnyk ; P Melnyk ; H Michalyshyn ; P Michalyshyn ; D Proniuk ; H Shevchishin ; A Solowan ; A Syrotiuk ; J Yanishevsky.\n\nThe priest Kucey visited the parish to serve it.\n\nImmediately, the women associated with the Orthodox Brotherhood began making pyrohy (perogies, varennyky) for sale in order raise the necessary funds for all that was to come.\n\nFirst foundational meeting hosts\n\nPriest Dmytro Senata, 1924\n\nIn 1924, the Priest Dmytro Senata arrived in Canada from Ukraine, and he became the priest who visited and served the parish. The first service was held on Pascha Sunday at the M Hrushevsky Institute, later known as “Saint John’s Institute”.\n\nIn September, 1924, Archbishop John (Theodorovych), who had come from the USA, came to visit in Edmonton for the first time. He had been elected at the sobor in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, to be the bishop of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nIn the same year, the choir of the parish was officially established.\n\nFirst Temple, 1926\n\nOn 24 October, 1926, the priest Senata served the first Divine Liturgy in a church building, the former Grace Methodist Church, that was acquired on Kinistino Avenue, which is now 96 Street, and popularly called \"Church Street\". This building proved to be adequate, and the facilities were appropriately adapted to accommodate Orthodox worship. The purchase had become possible because this Methodist congregation had become redundant in 1925, when it became part of the United Church of Canada (a merger of Methodist, Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches).\n\nFirst Divine Liturgy\n\nIn 1926, a Women’s Organisation was established in the parish. In the same year, a similar national organisation, the Ukrainian Women's Association of Canada (UWAC), had been founded in Saskatoon.\n\nOn 26 February, 1927, the parish adopted a formal constitution.\n\nIn 1928, church school classes began to be offered on Saturdays. Women in the parish were given the right to vote at parish council meetings. The parish choir was founded (under the direction of Peter Lazarowich, the rector of the M Hrushevsky Institute).\n\nIn 1929, the parish Women’s Organisation became affiliated with the Ukrainian Women’s Association of Canada as a local branch.\n\nIn 1930, a parsonage was built next to the Temple.\n\n\"CYMK\" Orthodox Youth established, 1933\n\nIn 1933, the senior Ukrainian Orthodox Youth (CYMK) association was formed in the parish. The CYMK is usually closely associated with a parish’s women’s association.\n\nFormal entry into the UGOCC, 1934-1936\n\nOn 21 January, 1934, a resolution was adopted which declared that this parish would formally become part of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nIn 1935, the Junior CYMK was founded. The parish began to broadcast the Divine Liturgy on the radio.\n\nOn 7 July, 1936, the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Congregation of Saint John the Baptist was formally admitted to the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nOn 25 September, 1938, the Edmonton parish of Saint John celebrated the 950th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus’ in Kyiv, the capital city of Rus', and now of Ukraine. Archbishop John (Theodorovych) made an archpastoral visitation, celebrated the Divine Liturgy, and blessed the new iconostas.\n\nIn 1940, the Junior CYMK was temporarily suspended (during war time).\n\nIn 1942, the Ukrainian Women’s Association took over the responsibility of the Saturday Ukrainian language and religion school.\n\nIn 1944, the Church school classes were moved to Sundays and became a Sunday school.\n\nThe congregation, 1948\n\nIconostas and interior, 1948\n\nPost-war activity, 1946\n\nWhen World War II was over, the women of the parish transformed their War Committee into a Postwar Committee. Its primary function was to help the 200,000 Ukrainians who found themselves in displaced persons camps after the fighting was over. The Postwar Committee sent them hundreds of dollars worth of comestibles and hundreds of pounds of clothing. Then, when the displaced persons arrived in Edmonton, the women helped them to fill out documentation, to find accommodation, and to find employment.\n\nPost-war refugees\n\nThe newcomers, especially those from Bukovina and Volhynia, added to the membership of the parish and of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada (UGOCC) as a whole. The church as a whole gained a new hierarchy of highly educated and prestigious bishops from amongst the new immigrants. It is enough to mention that the UGOCC was headed by Archbishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) from 1947 to 1950, and then by Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) from 1951 to 1972. The former, who was the nephew of the Ukrainian revolutionary leader Symon Petliura, had been a senator in the Polish parliament before his ordination. The latter had been a professor and prominent expert in Ukrainian philology in Ukraine.\n\nYuriy Bilashevych\n\nThe parish also gained some prominent and talented persons. It deliberately \"headhunted\" amongst the displaced persons to find a new choir director. The conductor they settled upon was Yuriy Bilashevych. He had been born into a priestly family in Lutsk, in Volhynia. He studied at the conservatory in Kyiv, joined the opera, and later founded a choir under his direction. Before travelling to Edmonton, he had organised a choir in the American zone of occupation in Germany that toured 22 displaced persons’ camps. The parish paid him well, $175 a month, which was the same as the pastor was paid. Maestro Bilashevych certainly earned his keep. He took the choir on concert tours in the Ukrainian bloc settlement northeast of Edmonton. (A concert in Vegreville in spring 1951 earned $175.65, and another in Two Hills brought in $112.12.) He directed the choir from late 1948 until the end of 1951.\n\nBecause of this investment in Mr. Bilashevych, the choir was able, through giving many concerts and annual carolling at Christmas, to raise considerable funds for the parish. These funds, together with the funds raised by the Women's Association through its food sales and other works, made it possible for the parish to consider the next step, the construction of a new Temple.\n\nCathedral choir with Mr. Bilashevych\n\nWadym Dobrolige\n\nAnother important “acquisition” of the parish in this period was the painter Wadym Dobrolige. Born in Nizhyn, near Chernihiv, in 1913, Wadym Dobrolige acquired a higher education at the Kyiv State Art Institute , where he worked in the studio of the renowned Ukrainian artist, Fedir Krychevsky. Later, he completed his studies at the Academy of Arts in Leningrad, Russia. In the Soviet Union, he worked primarily in the genre of theatre and film set decoration (he remained a prolific decorator even after he moved to Canada in 1948). He was unable to avoid the Stalinist purges, and he spent 1935-1938 in exile in northern Siberia. Even then he was engaged artistically, helping to decorate the Red Army House in Ussuriisk (on the site of the former Nikolsky Cathedral). During the Nazi occupation, he left the Soviet Union, and he ended up in Heidenau, Germany, in 1943. It was there that he began first to paint icons. After settling in Edmonton, Mr. Dobrolige, in addition to his work as a decorator, painted numerous churches in Alberta. Until his death in 1973, he helped the parish in numerous ways, providing expert advice on artistic matters, designing covers for parish publications, painting stage sets, and eventually painting a new iconostas for the cathedral.\n\nIn 1949, with stabilisation of society after World War II, the Junior CYMK was re-established.\n\nRural depopulation, urbanisation\n\nBy this time also, there had begun the mass migration of Ukrainians from rural localities like Redwater, Vilna, and Stry to Edmonton, as part of the rural depopulation phenomenon. The exodus of the Ukrainian population from rural areas into the city (an unstoppable torrent by the late 1950s) was a major demographic change. Up until then, the “colonies” (i.e., the rural bloc settlement) had been the most vibrant centre of Ukrainian Canadian life in Alberta. Now Edmonton took up that role. The minutes of Saint John’s annual meeting of 23 June, 1949, stated : “In comparison to the past decade we have taken a triple step forward in the growth of membership and income. Our parish has over 200 families”.\n\nImpetus to construct a larger Temple\n\nUnder these circumstances, the parish began to think of building a new and larger Temple, one that could accommodate up to 600 Faithful. Father Peter Melnychuk, the pastor in the 1940s, saw that a new building was necessary, and he, himself, gave $500 to the building fund in order to \"prime the pump\" for donations. The board’s intention to save for a new Temple was expressed already in October, 1942. By 1944, a special committee was set up to examine lots for purchase. Four locations were considered for the new building. One was near Park Memorial Funeral Home (corner of 97 Street and 111 Avenue). However, this site had some serious drawbacks. For one thing, there was just too much traffic in the area, not only cars, but streetcars. (The streetcars were to disappear in 1951, but no one foresaw that in 1944.) The problem with the traffic, aside from the noise, was that it wasn’t safe for the children who would come to church to attend Ukrainian school and Sunday school. It was also thought inappropriate to locate the Temple so close to a funeral establishment. Moreover, this site would not allow the Altar to face east, as prescribed by the canons of the Orthodox Church.\n\nAnother site under consideration was in the vicinity of the Hudson Bay building (102 Street and Jasper Avenue). Lots were relatively cheap there, and it was possible to position the building so that the Altar faced east. However, it was too close to the business section ; there were too many run-down buildings in the area, and there were problems with the soil.\n\nA third site considered was that of the original Temple (96 Street and 106 Avenue). However, the existing structure would have to be demolished first, and the new building constructed. It was too costly a proposition.\n\nThe site eventually chosen was in the vicinity of 107 Street and 110 Avenue. As the minutes record, “it is a suitable place, just 1 block from streetcars running on 3 streets ; a quieter location, near other churches ; a rather nice neighbourhood ; there are 8 lots altogether ; there is room for a residence”. There were 2 difficulties : first, the lots were a bit expensive ; and second, in between the lots the parish wanted was another lot with a house on it. They would have to purchase it. Two cars of people were sent out to examine the lots, and the conclusion was that this was the most suitable place for the new Temple.\n\nThe parish was able to save $45,000 towards the new building by October, 1948. By August of the next year it had saved $60,000.\n\nConstruction of a new Temple, 1950\n\nOn 7 May, 1950, Bishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk), the head of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, blessed the grounds for the building of the new Temple, at the corner of 107 Street and 110 Avenue (10951-107 Street). At that time, he turned the sod for the beginning of the project. Construction began on 14 September.\n\nArchbishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) turns the sod symbolically\n\nErecting the steel frame\n\nFormal incorporation, 1951\n\nOn 4 April, 1951, the Edmonton parish was incorporated under the Religious Societies Land Act of the Province of Alberta under the name, “The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Parish of St. John in Edmonton”.\n\nOn 29 November, Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko), the new leader of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, paid his first visit to the Edmonton parish.\n\nBlessing of the corner-stone of the Second Temple, 1952\n\nOn 31 August, 1952, Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) blessed the cornerstone of the newly-constructed Temple. The architect of this new Temple was Patrick Campbell-Hope, and the cost of the building was about $250,000.00.\n\nOn 17 May, 1953, Metropolitan Ilarion made an archpastoral visitation and he sanctified the new Temple, served the hierarchical Divine Liturgy, and officially opened the new Temple. However, the parish’s original aspiration to build a Temple to accommodate 600 people proved to be \"wishful thinking\". It was learnt that according to the fire code, just over 300 worshippers at a time could attend services in the Temple.\n\nCongregation at the new cathedral\n\nNew cathedral interior (original iconostas)\n\nIn 1953, the Young Adults Club was formed.\n\nIn 1953, the Junior CYMK members were being given lessons in wood-carving and embroidery.\n\nIn 1955, a new parsonage (manse) was constructed near the Temple, and it was used as the residence of the priest. Its first occupant was Father Kowalishin. Not all the pastors of Saint John’s have chosen to live in the manse, and it has been costly to maintain. At present, the manse is being rented out.\n\nNew parsonage, 1955\n\nCathedral and parsonage\n\nThe parsonage, 2020\n\nThe English Language\n\nAside from migrations, there was another sociological change underway : a deteriorating knowledge of the Ukrainian language amongst the youth, and the increasing employment of English in parish life.\n\nThe first symptom of this change was a motion put before the parish board on 12 July 1956 : “To write to the consistory and explain that we absolutely need a priest who has a perfect command of English, because circumstances in Edmonton require it”. Already in 1957, the youth brotherhood in the parish was conducting its meetings in English. Again, at an extraordinary board meeting on 19 August 1959, Lena Budnick raised the concern of a priest “who has a good command of the English language so as to be more accessible to the youth and children”.\n\nA special committee was struck in the parish in 1960, in order to deal with the language question. The committee consisted of John Decore (who served as chair), Kost Telychko, and Steve Cybak. The committee proposed that 2 Divine Liturgies be held every Sunday, one with a sermon in Ukrainian, the other with the sermon in English ; that the Divine Liturgy be celebrated in English, especially for mixed marriages ; that Sunday school lessons be conducted partially in English ; that the Divine Liturgy be shortened ; that the parish periodical, \"Visnyk\", publish some articles in English ; and that Divine Liturgies be celebrated on Latin Christmas and Easter. Only some of these proposals were implemented. In that same year, 1960, the parish purchased bilingual prayer books to place in the pews.\n\nThe change in the language used in the parish is expressed in the contrast between the 50th anniversary booklet of the parish (1973), published entirely in Ukrainian, and the 75th (1998) booklet, which was primarily in English.\n\nWith the development of other parishes in the city, the use of the English language was included in their services in varying degrees. For instance, the parish of Saint Anthony, the youngest of the Ukrainian Orthodox parishes in Edmonton, uses a substantial amount of English, in the Divine Liturgy and in the sermons. Saint John’s Cathedral was the parish of choice for those who have preferred to worship in Ukrainian. The cathedral did experiment with English services once a month, but attendance was low, and the all-English services were discontinued in 2020. Since then, parish services employed a mixture of Ukrainian and English, with Ukrainian predominating.\n\nBeginning seriously with the enthronement of Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko), the whole Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church undertook the necessary steps towards regularising the structure of the UGOCC, and towards normalising relationships with the canonical Orthodox Churches throughout the world.\n\nAn important step on this path was the creation of a synod of 3 bishops at the head of 3 eparchies. This was initiated by the sobor of 1951, which divided the Church into 3 eparchies : the Eastern Eparchy in Toronto ; the Central Eparchy in Winnipeg ; and the Western Eparchy in Edmonton. The latter eparchy was comprised of the parishes in Alberta and British Columbia.\n\nWith the establishment of 3 eparchies, the head of the Church, at that time Archbishop Ilarion (Ohienko) was raised from the title of archbishop to the dignity of metropolitan. Although the Western Eparchy was created at that time, there was no bishop immediately available to head it. In fact, the eparchy remained essentially a paper creation until an administrator was assigned in 1955. This was Father Yeronim Hrycyna, who had been pastor of Saint John’s from 1933 to 1940.\n\nEstablishment of the Western Eparchy ; Cathedral status, 1959\n\nExtraordinary sobor ; ordination of Bishop Andrew (Metiuk)\n\nIn 1959, there was an extraordinary assembly of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada in Edmonton. At this sobor, Archpriest Hryhorii Metiuk was elected to become the first bishop of Edmonton and the Western Eparchy. His ordination at Saint John’s was the first episcopal ordination of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to take place in Canada.\n\nOn 5 June, 1959, the Archpriest Hryhorii Metiuk was ordained to the Holy Episcopate to be Bishop Andrew (Metiuk), Bishop of Edmonton and the Western Eparchy (diocese).\n\nAt the ordination of Bishop Andrew (Metiuk)\n\nCathedral status for Saint John's parish\n\nIn 1959, after the ordination of Bishop Andrew (Metiuk) and the establishment of the Western Eparchy, Saint John’s parish was officially named the Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral Parish of Saint John. Thus, the parish became the cathedral seat of this and future bishops of Edmonton.\n\nNew Holy Table, Table of Oblation, and vestments, 1961\n\nIn 1961, on the 35th anniversary of the Saint John’s Branch of the Ukrainian Women’s Association of Canada, the local branch made a donation in the form of the new Holy Table, Oblation Table, vestments for the clergy and acolytes, and altar-coverings.\n\n40th anniversary, 1963\n\nIn 17 November, 1963, the parish celebrated its 40th anniversary.\n\nConstruction of the auditorium, 1964\n\nBlessing the ground for the auditorium\n\nConstruction of the auditorium\n\nIn 1964, the construction of the auditorium began. The auditorium came to be known as a cultural centre. Later, a solarium was added as well. The hall was made available for rent, and a regular “perohy supper” was offered as a fundraiser in the hall.\n\nOn 31 October, 1965, the completed auditorium was blessed officially by Bishop Andrew (Metiuk). The first ball was organised.\n\nThe new building came to include space for the “Ukrainian Museum of Canada — Alberta Branch”.\n\nPermanent site of the museum\n\nSYMK choir\n\nIn 1966, the Edmonton CYMK choir was formed for youth over 14 years of age. The choir sings during some services and on other occasions.\n\n50 years of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, 1968\n\nIn 1968, the 50th anniversary of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada was celebrated. In the same year, the bingo committee was established.\n\nNew iconostas\n\nIt was only in 1968 that the parish felt comfortable enough in its financial situation to decide upon installing a new iconostas. Heading up the project were William Hawrelak, who was between terms as mayor of Edmonton, and the two pastors, Alexander Chomiak and Dmytro Luchak.\n\nThey engaged the artist Wadym Dobrolige (a post-war immigrant) to prepare a design. Mr Dobrolige had studied art in the studio of Fedir Krychevsky in Kyiv, Ukraine, and at the Academy of Arts in Leningrad, Russia (Taras Shevchenko had long ago studied there).\n\nMr. Dobrolige made a model of the iconostas, and later he drew up plans and specifications. The board and Archbishop Andrew (Metiuk) approved the plans and hired Mr. Dobrolige to begin work on the iconostas. He worked on it from 1969 to 1972. Then the completed iconostas was installed in the cathedral.\n\nThe new iconostas was designed in Cossack baroque style, with a layout soaked in tradition. The entire ensemble is a masterpiece of Ukrainian sacred art, instilling in the worshipper a prayerful attitude. The life-size figures of the Saviour, his Mother the Theotokos, and the saints help us understand how Saint Volodymyr’s emissaries felt in the churches of Constantinople : “We knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth”.\n\nDrawing, model of the new iconostas\n\nTheology scholarship, 1971\n\nIn 1971, a scholarship for theology students was established by the Ukrainian Women’s Association, Saint John’s Branch.\n\nSaint John’s Ukrainian Home for Seniors, 1973\n\nOn 28 October, 1973, the newly-constructed Saint John’s Ukrainian Home for Seniors was sanctified and officially opened.\n\nCathedral interior, new iconostas\n\n50 years, 1973\n\nIn 1973, the parish celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\nOn 2-5 July, 1975, the 15th Sobor of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada in Winnipeg elected Archbishop Andrew (Metiuk) to be the next metropolitan, and Bishop Boris (Yakovkevych) to be the Archbishop of Edmonton and the Western Diocese.\n\nBishop Boris (Yakovkevych)\n\nIn 1976, mosaics were installed on the east wall of the Altar area.\n\nIn 1978, a mosaic of a “deisis” was installed on the arch above the iconostas.\n\nIn the same year, Alice (Lesia) Chumer became the director of the cathedral choir.\n\nIn 1980, bronze doors, a gift of the Krysa family, were installed at the western entrance of the Temple. They were made by Roman Kowal (also a post-war immigrant). It was he who also prepared the mosaics on the cathedral façade.\n\nChange of incorporation status, 1980\n\nOn 25 July, 1980, the “Bar-V-Nok Cultural Society” was incorporated as “The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Parish of Saint John’s Cathedral and Recreational Association”. This group promotes the Ukrainian Orthodox Christian Faith, and it raises funds to support the cathedral parish’s programmes and projects. The parish has also contributed to institutions meant to serve the general Orthodox community.\n\nThe proposal to establish a camp for youth at Pigeon Lake was first discussed in the parish in 1955. Saint John’s Cathedral has supported the camp, known as \"Camp Bar-V-Nok\", with both funds and pastoral care. The parish also helped in the establishment and maintenance of Saint John’s Institute\", which replaced the former Mykhailo Hrushevsky Institute.\n\nThe board of the newly-planned institute purchased the former Robertson College from the University of Alberta in 1949, but the building proved too small and too dilapidated for the many Ukrainian Orthodox students who were coming to Edmonton for higher education. Over the years 1955-1958 a new building was constructed on the same site, on Whyte Avenue. As the migration of Ukrainian Orthodox from the countryside into the city slowed to a trickle, the Institute no longer proved financially viable, and it was sold in 2020. Although the cathedral parish and the former institute were both called Saint John’s, they were each named after a different Saint John : the patron of the cathedral is Saint John the Baptist, while the patron of the institute was Saint John Chrysostom.\n\nIn 1982, mosaics were installed on the outside front wall, and on either side of the entrance doors. In this year also, the parish marked the “Year of the Ukrainian Orthodox Youth”.\n\n60 years, 1983\n\nIn 1983, the parish marked its 60th anniversary.\n\nSaint John's Cathedral\n\nBishop John (Stinka), 1984\n\nIn 1984, Bishop John (Stinka) was elected to be the Bishop of Edmonton and the Western Diocese.\n\nArchbishop John (Stinka) blessing baskets at Pascha\n\nIn this same year, the Saint John’s Senior Citizens’ Home (Dnipro) was officially opened.\n\nMillennium of the Baptism of Rus’, 1988\n\nIn 1988, the Western Diocese celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus’.\n\nThere were 2 large stained-glass windows installed in the transepts of the cathedral. They were the creation of Winnipeg artist Roman Kowal. Born in a Ukrainian village which is now in Poland, Mr. Kowal studied in Lviv and in Munich, and he came to Canada in 1948. According to the Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine, he was best known for his stained glass windows and mosaics that “incorporated abstract design into a neo-Byzantine form”.\n\nTwo stained-glass windows\n\nRoman Kowal’s windows are arranged so that the ones referring to the life of the Saviour are on the right (south) side of the Temple, while those referring to the Mother of God are on the left (north side).\n\nSouth wall windows\n\nWindows in the central dome\n\nMr. Kowal was also the creator of the mosaics at the entrance to the cathedral.\n\nAlso in 1988, the Hawrysh Scholarship was established.\n\nIn 1989, reflecting the name-change of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada to “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada”, the cathedral parish similarly changed its name to “The Ukrainian Orthodox Parish of Saint John in Edmonton”. The name-change was approved by the Government of Alberta on 18 July, 1989.\n\nRe-naming of the UGOCC, 1990\n\nIn 1990, the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada was officially renamed “The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada” (UOCC) by an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe UOCC entered into Eucharistic union with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, 1990\n\nIn 1990, the 18th Sobor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba, decided to enter into Eucharistic Union with the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople (Istanbul). This decision also changed the relationship with the other Orthodox dioceses and parishes in Canada in a positive way.\n\nIn 1991, a meeting of the parishioners rejected a proposed plan for renovations and additions to Saint John’s Auditorium, and an alternative plan was accepted.\n\nIn the same year, the centennial of Ukrainian settlers in Canada was marked.\n\nIn 1992, the parish contributed substantially to an airlift of aid to Ukraine and to the project for the children of the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nIn 1992, the Archpriest Stephen Semotiuk was assigned to be the rector of the cathedral parish.\n\n70 years, 1993\n\nIn 1993, the parish marked its 70th anniversary.\n\nIn 1994, there was a major renovation project which included making a physical connection between the auditorium and the Temple. The kitchen in the auditorium was renovated and expanded, and a seminary room was added. In this year also, Nick Ochotta replaced the previous windows of the cathedral with stained-glass windows.\n\nIn 1996, 4 stained-glass windows were installed at the west entry of the Temple.\n\nIn 1997, 8 stained-glass windows were installed in the dome of the Temple.\n\n75 years, 1998\n\nFrom 12-15 November, 1998, the cathedral parish marked its 75th anniversary.\n\nIn 2014, new fresco-style icons were applied to the ceiling of the Altar area.\n\nThe parish’s children who are eligible to serve as acolytes (Altar-boys) are those over age 8 who attend the Sunday school and who express the desire to participate in this way.\n\nWomen's Association baking Paskha\n\nDevelopment of the Cultural Centre\n\nThe Expansion of Infrastructure\n\nIn 1958, the parish began to discuss constructing a new building to house the Sunday school and the \"Ridna Shkola\" (\"Native Land School\"), and to serve as an auditorium for various gatherings. The cost of what was eventually to be called Saint John’s Cultural Centre was well over $250,000.\n\nOn Sunday, 29 August, 1963, Vladyka Andrew (Metiuk) blessed the land for the planned school and auditorium.\n\nTwo years later, on 31 October, 1965, he sanctified the finished construction, and the centre was available for use. It has been the venue for many, many cherished events in the parish ever afterwards. Of course, with the expansion of the parish’s physical plant, upkeep and renovation would demand additional funding and many hours of work over the following decades.\n\nMany subsequent additions and renovations have enhanced the original facility, one of them being the solarium, which was completed in 2001. The facility was established primarily to accommodate the needs of the congregation, various Ukrainian associations and the community at large.\n\nIn 2022, the cultural centre was enhanced by a series of mosaics by Theodora Harasymiw entitled “Our Heritage : The Past, The Present, and The Future”. This legacy mosaic celebrating the centenary of Saint John’s Cathedral was commissioned by the parish’s Ukrainian Women’s Association.\n\nUWAC members, 2023\n\nThe Cultural Centre is used for events such as weddings, banquets, socials, memorial dinners, seminars, workshops, conferences and meetings.\n\nCultural Centre\n\nParishioners\n\nNew main chandelier and others, 2012\n\nThe story of the procuring of a new main chandelier began in 2005, when the previous, original chandelier was being cleaned. It was discovered at that time that the old chandelier was simply falling apart. Trying to find a replacement that was adequate to the large space of the cathedral was a great challenge, which was only overcome in July, 2012, when the new chandelier was installed. A few months later, 2 smaller chandeliers were also installed. The cost of the whole project, before the GST tax, was $118,000.\n\nLater, a Baptist visitor wrote : “The elegant main chandelier which was imported from Portugal and installed in 2012, contains fine gold detail that couples with Swarovski crystals to dazzle within the room. This piece adds an extra sense of royalty and splendour to the space”.\n\nNew Chandeliers\n\nLesia/Alice Chumer, Choir Director, 1976-2020\n\nLesia Chumer directed Saint John’s Cathedral choir for 44 years. No other choir director, priest, or cantor served the parish for such a long span of time. She took up the leadership of the choir in November, 1976, when the previous director, Roman Soltykewich], died of a heart attack. When she retired as director in October, 2020, she was replaced by Roman Soltykewich’s son, Orest Soltykevych.\n\nLesia Chumer was raised in Boyle, Alberta ; but like many rural and small-town Ukrainians, her family moved to Edmonton in 1948. At the age of 14, Lesia was encouraged to join the parish choir by the director, who at that time was Alexander Yefymchuk.\n\nLater, as director of the choir herself, she developed (as all directors do) her own style. She amassed a huge library of liturgical music, and the choir would generally learn 4 or more so versions of each piece (“Our Father”, “Cherubic Hymns”, and others). On Sundays, as each part of the Divine Liturgy progressed, she would flip through her binder and pick one of the versions that she had taught the choir. No-one knew in advance exactly what they would be singing. Sometimes, however, she would pick a piece that the choir had never practiced, or had sung only in the rather distant past. One could always tell if it was one of these sight-reading Sundays because a mischievous smile would cross her lips before she announced her choice of what was to be sung. She held choir practices for 2 hours most Wednesday evenings during the year, except for summertime.\n\nCentennial of the UOCC, 2018\n\nIn 2018, the 100th anniversary of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada and also of Holy Trinity Cathedral were marked at an extraordinary sobor (assembly) at the cathedral in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe purpose of the sobor was to celebrate 100 years of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada. The celebrations were attended by Ukrainian Orthodox faithful from across Canada and beyond.\n\nThe Sobor began on Thursday, 9 August, 2018, with a Hierarchical Divine Liturgy in the Chapel of Saint Petro Mohyla Institute, presided by Bishop Andriy (Peshko) of the Eastern Eparchy, with the responses sung by the Clergy led by Father Michael Lomaszkiewicz. This was followed by an All-Canada Clergy Conference.\n\nCentennial Clergy Conference\n\nAll gathered for Vespers at the Mohyla Institute Chapel and this was followed by a wine and cheese reception as the delegates and guests registered for the Extraordinary National Council.\n\nThe celebrations continued for a year.\n\n2020-2021 Coronavirus-19 virus restrictions on parishes\n\nIn early 2020, the Covid-19 virus made its appearance in Canada, and it quickly became a world-wide pandemic. Because of the rules governing gatherings that were laid down by the provincial and city governments, the cathedral stopped any further services after 15 March, 2020. Including the rules regarding social distancing, the decreasing numbers permitted for any gathering, and the considerations regarding the health of all concerned, this and other parishes were required to close for a time.\n\nAs elsewhere, there was some controversy about the legal requirements.\n\nServing during the pandemic\n\nThe cathedral parish was able to enjoy weekly Divine Liturgies through 15 March 2020 ; but after that, there was a hiatus during which no services at all were allowed, both by government decree and by the decision of Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk). Divine Liturgies continued to be celebrated, but the congregation was absent. Instead, as of 22 March, the cathedral parish began to \"livestream\" the Divine Liturgy. Later, on 12 July, as the lockdown was partially relaxed, it was possible to attend services in a limited way. Some pews were blocked off with tape to ensure \"social distancing\". Members who wanted to attend had to sign up in advance, and there was a cap of 15 percent of capacity (thus, 45 participants). The manner of receiving Holy Communion was adjusted in accordance with the instructions of Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk). Choral singing was also banned during the lockdown, so the choir was completely supplanted by the cantor, Fedir Gotsaliuk.\n\nAside from the impact on liturgical life, the lockdown affected the finances of the parish. Saint John’s Cathedral parish administration had been relying very much on a successful catering operation for funding ; but no events were allowed during the lockdown. There was no collection when there was no service ; and later, when a restricted number of parishioners were allowed to attend, the collection baskets were not as full as they would normally be. The parish had to lay off staff temporarily. However, government subsidies and generous donations by parishioners allowed the cathedral's administration to make use of the lockdown to upgrade and renovate facilities, including bringing up to code the alarm systems.\n\nA Ukrainian proverb has it that \"there is no evil from which good will not come\" (\"Нема такого злого, щоб на добре не вийшло\").\n\nBy 2024, everything had returned to normal in the parish : the choir is singing every Sunday, Holy Communion is taken in the traditional manner, and there are no restrictions on attendance. One detail of the lockdown remains : the streaming of the Divine Liturgy every Sunday on \"YouTube\". For an aging parish, this has been a valuable pastoral instrument.\n\nElection of Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk), 2022\n\nElection of a nominee by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada\n\nOn 15-19 June, 2022, the 24th Sobor of the Ukrainian Orthodox of Canada was convened \"on-line\". This conference-meeting was convened thus instead of convening physically (as customarily) in Winnipeg, Manitoba. There were 6 cathedrals in Canada where this meeting took place simultaneously through a computer-network : in Winnipeg, Manitoba (Holy Trinity Metropolitan Cathedral) ; Vancouver, British Columbia (Holy Trinity Cathedral) ; in Edmonton, Alberta (Saint John's Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral) ; in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (Holy Trinity Cathedral) ; in Toronto, Ontario (Saints Vladimir and Olga Cathedral) ; in Montréal, Québec (Saint Sophie Cathedral).\n\nThere was a total of 205 delegates, which was near the average attendance for such sobors.\n\nIn the course of the work of the Sobor, there was the necessary election in order to nominate to the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople a candidate for election as Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, who would succeed the Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk).\n\nThere were 3 candidates who were considered : Archbishop Job (Getcha), Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk), and Bishop Andriy (Peshko). The final choice of the members of the sobor was Archbishop Job (Getcha). He had received more than the minimum required 51% of the votes, and there was no subsequent voting required.\n\nThe election by the Sobor (Assembly) of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada then had to be confirmed by the Holy Synod of Bishops of Constantinople (as is described in the Consistory By-laws).\n\nUpon having received the nomination (with accompanying documents) from the Sobor of the UOCC, the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople elected Vladyka Ilarion (Rudnyk) to become Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Canada.\n\nThe Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople elected Archbishop Job (Getcha) to become Metropolitan of Pisidia, in west-central Türkiye (Turkey), north of Lycia, and east of Ephesus.\n\nRetirement of Protopresbyter Stephan Semotiuk, 2022\n\nOn 31 July, 2022, Protopresbyter Stephan Semotiuk was given the blessing to retire from active service. He had served as Dean of Saint John's Cathedral since 1 August, 1992 (30 years). On this occasion, Protopresbyter Stephan served at the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy for the last time as dean. On this day also, Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk) served for the first time in the cathedral after his being nominated to become the metropolitan of the UOCC.\n\nOn 1 August, 2022, Archpriest Cornell Zubritsky was assigned to serve as the Dean of the Cathedral. Father Cornell had previously been serving in the cathedral parish as the Second Priest since 2008.\n\nBeginning of the Divine Liturgy\n\nArchpriest Cornell Zubritsky (left) ; Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk) (centre) ; Protopresbyter Stephan Semotiuk (right)\n\nAt the Entrance with the Holy Gospel\n\nConfirmation of election in Constantinople/Istanbul, 2022\n\nOn 29 August, 2022, Vladyka Ilarion (Rudnyk) was at the Phanar in Constantinople for the purpose of the first confirmation of the election in June, 2022. He co-served the Divine Liturgy with Patriarch Bartholomew (Archontonis) in the Cathedral of Saint George at the Phanar.\n\nEnthronement as Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, 2022\n\nOn Saturday, 19 November, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., in Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Enthronement Hierarchical Divine Liturgy was served. Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) presided at the Divine Liturgy. He was assisted by Bishop Andriy (Peshko), many priests, several deacons, subdeacons and Altar-servers. Present also were Metropolitan Archbishop Sotirios (Athanassoulas), Exarch of Canada for the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk), Former Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nIncrease in immigration, 2023\n\nBy Spring, 2023, more than 650,000 refugees from the war in Ukraine had arrived in Canada. 7,000 of them had settled in Edmonton. This fact has had an effect on the cathedral parish, since now a sizable portion of the congregation every Sunday consists of these newcomers. The parish welcomed them, and supported them in various ways. It was considered that it was quite possible that this new group might reinvigorate, and even reinvent the cathedral parish community.\n\nCentennial anniversary, 2023\n\nRetirement of Protopresbyter Stephan Semotiuk\n\nThe centennial celebrations began in September, 2022. At that time, there were celebrations surrounding the retirement of Protopresbyter Stephan Semotiuk. Father Stephan, Dean of the Cathedral, had served in this capacity for 30 years. He had served the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada in an active capacity for 53 years in total. With retirement, he continued to serve the Faithful, but without the responsibility of the deanship. He had served the cathedral parish for 1/3 of its history up to that time. The parishioners were grateful for the leadership of Father Stephan and Dobrodijka Diana over these years.\n\nDuring the celebrations, the Chair of the 100th Anniversary Committee, Marianne Makowsky, announced the beginning of the year-long centennial celebrations. In addition, retired professor John-Paul Himka, made a presentation about the inaugural meeting of the parish on 11 November, 1923. Earlier, Professor Himka had presented a series of 4 lectures that covered the history of the parish up until 2022.\n\nMosaics\n\nIn October, 2022, the cathedral's Women's Association donated 12 mosaics of the past, present, and future of the parish. They had been prepared by Theodora Harasim, and they were blessed by Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyk).\n\nCulminating events\n\nBeginning in March, 2023, other particular events were organised in order to mark and to celebrate the first 100 years of service.\n\nThe events culminated in 3 days of events in November, 2023 :\n\n17 November : Sacred Music Concert – Saint John’s Cathedral\n\n18 November : Anniversary Banquet – Saint John’s Cultural Centre\n\n19 November : Hierarchical Divine Liturgy – Saint John’s Cathedral\n\nAt 100 years of age, Saint John’s parish, like any group of people, has some differences and divisions regarding the way forward for the congregation, and for the Church in Canada as a whole. The latter division was particularly evident at the 24th sobor held (remotely in different locations) in June, 2022. However, differences of opinion are necessary for any organisation to make progress, and they serve as an indication of health (that is, when people are concerned about the future, they are not envisioning the termination of their activities).\n\nOverall, if one were to pick one word to describe the atmosphere in Saint John’s parish at the end of a centenary of existence, that word would be “friendly”. Much of the credit for this must be ascribed to the gentle leadership of the former pastor, Mitred Archpriest Stephen Semotiuk, who served this parish for 30 years before his retirement in 2022. The outgoing, pleasant manners of the president, Marshall Kachmar, and of the vice-president, Gerald Kruhlak, contributed to the neighbourly atmosphere. Likewise does the handshake and smile that the parish greeter, George Zaharia, bestows on everyone entering the Temple. He is supported at the vestibule by June Kachmar.\n\nIt was difficult to think of Archpriest Cornell Zubritsky as the new dean of the cathedral parish, since he had been assigned to Saint John’s Cathedral in 2008 ; and from that time, he has always played a large part in parish life.\n\nThe Rector of the Cathedral, Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyk) served the Divine Liturgy\n\nOn Sunday, 29 October, 2023, Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyki), rector of the cathedral parish, served the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy at the cathedral. He was assisted by clergy of the Western Eparchy of Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nThose serving in the Altar\n\nCongregation\n\nChange of calendar for the UOCC, 2023\n\nOn 1 December, 2023, in accordance with the resolutions of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyk) announced that, effective that day, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada moved to use the New (Revised Julian) Calendar. He allowed that for a brief period of time, a parish might remain on the Old (Julian) Calendar.\n\nIt seems that subsequently, John's Cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta, was the first to adopt the New (Revised Julian) Calendar.\n\nHowever, a previously-existing group of persons began to encourage resistance to the immediacy of this change. It was their understanding that the process would be determined ultimately and finally at the next general sobor of the UOCC. Therefore, on 16 December, 2023, Metropolitan Ilarion issued a formal letter concerning the situation, together with a letter of support sent to him by his predecessor (Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk)). He called the resisters to repentance.\n\nClergy of the cathedral parish\n\nIn the cathedral parish, the ruling or administering bishop of the Western Diocese also serves as the rector of the cathedral.\n\nRectors of the cathedral parish include : Archpriest Yeronim Hrycyna 1955-1958 Archpriest Hryhory Metiuk 1958 Archbishop Andrew (Metiuk) 1959-1975 Archbishop Boris (Yakovkevych) 1975-1984 Archbishop John (Stinka) 1984-2005 Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyk) 2008-____ Priests who have served as parish pastor include : (The symbol * indicates an assistant priest. ) Archpriest Dmytro Senata 1923-1927 Archpriest Peter Bilon 1927-1928 Mitred Archpriest Peter Sametz 1928-1933 Mitred Archpriest Yeronim Hrycyna 1933-1940 Archpriest Peter Melnychuk 1940-1949 Archpriest Ambrose Chrustawka 1949-1955 Archpriest Thomas Kowalishin 1954-1955 Archpriest Michael Fyk 1956-1962 Mitred Archpriest Hryhory Metiuk 1958-1959 Archpriest Olexander Chomiak 1959-1980 Archpriest Thomas Kowalishin 1962-1963 Archpriest Dmytro Luchak 1963-1970 Mitred Archpriest Frank Kernisky 1970-1974 Archpriest Victor Lakusta 1974-1984 Mitred Archpriest Dmytro Luchak 1981-1987 Archpriest Nicholas Rauliuk 1987-1992 Mitred Archpriest Dr. Ivan Stus 1990-1991 Archpriest Taras Udod 1991-1992 Protopresbyter Stephan Semotiuk 1992-2022 Priest Jaroslav Buciora *1994 Priest Brent Kuzyk *1996-1997 Priest Mykhail Ozimko *1999-2000 Priest Ivan Petrouchtchak *2001-2003 Priest Volodymyr Bilous *2003-2006 Protopresbyter Mykola Petroushchak *2006-2008 Archpriest Cornell Zubritsky *2008-2022 Archpriest Cornell Zubritsky 2022-____\n\nParticular parish information\n\nThe cathedral parish is the centre of the Western Eparchy, Edmonton Region, of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.
