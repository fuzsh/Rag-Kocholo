In Gathering a Heritage, Thomas M. Prymak uses the essays and articles he has written over the past thirty years as a historian of Ukrainian and Ukrainian Canadian history to reflect on the evolution of ethnic studies in Canada and the United States. The essays included in this book explore the history of Ukrainian and Slavonic immigration to North America and the literature through which these communities and their historians have sought to recapture their past. Each previously published essay is revised and expanded and several more appear here for the first time – including the fasci­ nating story of French Canadian writer Gabrielle Roy’s connections with Ukrainian Canadians and her tumultuous affair with a Ukrainian Canadian nationalist in pre-war London. thomas m. prymak is a research associate of the Chair of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Toronto.\n\nCover illustrations: (front) A Quadriga, or Chariot of the Gods, pulled by four horses car­ rying Winged Victory.

In particular, the beginnings of a new mass migration of people from various countries to Canada and its southern neighbour can be traced back to changes in the immigration laws in both countries enact­ ed in the 1960s. These changes eliminated certain restrictions placed on immigration from Third World countries, and, by the late 1970s, a massive new immigration from them was fully underway. The movement gathered strength steadily over the course of the next few decades and began to level off only during the economic downturn that began in 2008. It was soon realized that this new immigration from countries that had previously supplied very few immigrants to Canada and its neigh­ bour – that is, countries in Asia and elsewhere in the Third World – sig­ nalled a change in the ethnic makeup of the receiving countries, the like of which had not occurred since the Great Economic Migration from eastern and southern Europe to the Americas that had taken place from the 1880s to 1914. The earlier immigration had expanded the sources of the Canadian and American populations southward and especially east­ ward across all Europe; this later immigration is presently expanding them southward and eastward across the whole world. There is, however, one constant: from very modest beginnings in the 1930s, through the expansion in the educational systems of the 1950s and the “roots” phenomenon of the 1960s, through the multicultural movement of the 1970s, the 1980s, and beyond, to the exciting new devel­ opments of the early twenty-first century, interest in “ethnic studies” and immigration history has been steadily growing among both the general\n\nx Preface\n\npopulation and scholars. The present book seeks to address this interest with regard to one of the most prominent groups constituting the earlier Great Migration to Canada, and, in places, makes some modest compari­ sons with later developments. The book contains a collection of my essays dealing with Ukrainian Canadian subjects and related themes, Slavonic and ethnic, written over the course of the last twenty-five years. (Certain parallel or divergent American developments are also considered in various places.) During this period, my interests expanded considerably from Ukrainian Canadi­ an history with an emphasis on the pioneer immigration to the Canadian prairies at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, through the experiences of the children of this pioneer im­ migration, the generation of the 1940s, which lived through the Great Depression and the Second World War, to Ukrainian Canadian and Ukrainian American cultural history of later times, with an emphasis on scholarship and higher education, especially history writing and the lives and careers of various historians. Thus, the pre-1914 pioneer immigra­ tion, the children of the pioneers, the interwar immigration, their chil­ dren, and, later on, the post-1945 immigration, the highly political so-called Displaced Persons immigration, which the earlier immigrants, mostly economic in nature, welcomed to Canada and the United States, are the major subjects of the present book. The oldest contribution to the present collection is the essay on the distinguished Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko and the emigration question in old Austrian Galicia (Franko’s homeland, a region inhabited by many Ukrainians), which was written in 1983, prior to the defence of my PhD thesis in Ukrainian history at the University of Toronto. I wrote this Franko essay on the basis of some revealing new documents that I had come across by chance in the course of researching my dissertation on Franko’s friend and close collaborator, the historian Mykhailo Hrushev­ sky. It was published in a rather severely abridged form under the title “Ivan Franko and Mass Ukrainian Emigration to Canada” in the journal Canadian Slavonic Papers at the end of 1984 when I was Visiting Professor of Ukrainian History at the University of Saskatchewan. A much fuller and completely updated version of this essay appears here for the first time. One of the very last essays to be written and placed in this collection is the paper on the influential French Canadian writer Gabrielle Roy and her connections with the Ukrainian Canadians, especially the mysterious “Stephen” with whom she fell thoroughly in love and to whom she de­ voted two full chapters in her autobiography. This autobiography is now generally considered to be a classic in the genre in Canadian literature.\n\nPreface xi\n\nMuch of the material in Gathering a Heritage: Ukrainian, Slavonic, and Ethnic Canada and the USA has already been published, at least in part, in various journals, some of them highly specialized and rather obscure to the general Canadian or American reader. Indeed, two of the articles were even published in far-off Kazan, the capital city of Tatarstan in the Russian Federation! Consequently, with a view to making these essays more available to Western readers, I have taken this opportunity to gath­ er, revise, and update much of this scattered material, especially the old­ er material dealing with various immigration questions, and, thus, these materials have become somewhat “new.” Similarly, other materials, which, like the Franko essay mentioned above, were published only in a shorter form, appear for the first time in full here. Also, the essay on li­ brary studies titled “Scholarship on Mykhailo Hrushevsky during the Early 1980s: Ukrainian Books and Libraries in Canada and the United States,” the substantial essay on reference materials, “Ukrainian Canada in the Encyclopedias, 1897–2010: An Historical Overview,” and the above-mentioned essay titled “In the Shadow of a Political Assassination: Gabrielle Roy’s ‘Stephen’ and the Ukrainian Canadians” make their first printed appearance in this volume. The heritage gathered here is, of course, primarily Ukrainian Canadi­ an, and all the essays included reflect this fact. But, as indicated in the title, related themes, Slavonic and ethnic, are treated as well. Thus, while there is a geographical focal point for the work – western Canada and the prairie provinces – the material radiates outward to include all of Canada and, indeed, even all of North America and the New World. The essays on Ukrainian émigré scholarship, for example, take in the entire Western world, as, indeed, do some of the essays on the early waves of emigration from Europe to the Americas. With regard to questions of migration to the New World, social and political factors influencing emi­ gration from eastern Europe come to the fore, as also do immigration policies and conditions in North America. Moreover, in places, interna­ tional relations and European power politics impinge directly on the very Canadian issues and events discussed here. Perhaps the best exam­ ple of this sort of thing in this volume is the essay on Gabrielle Roy and her connections with the Ukrainian Canadians. In this particular essay, the rise of Hitler, the spread of Stalinism, and the European political crises of 1938–9, which led to the Second World War, are of central im­ portance to Roy’s personal life of the time and her decision to become a writer. Although Roy first gained fame as a Quebec writer, it should be emphasized that she always remained a French Canadian writer from the ethnically diverse province of Manitoba of the 1930s. This fact affected\n\nxii Preface\n\nher political opinions in later life and gave her a certain cosmopolitan streak, which included an interest in the Ukrainian Canadians. Thus, there is both a local core and a universal framework to the present book. On a slightly different level, I should point out that all the essays con­ tained in this book were written by a scholar trained in historical method and usually working in the field of European history; in particular, the history of “Russia and Eastern Europe,” as the discipline was once geopo­ litically defined. Thus, the linguistic skills and historical consciousness of the author vary somewhat from that of the typical Canadian or American historian whose linguistic skills are generally restricted to English and French and whose emphasis is most definitely on this continent. This different approach to the sources comes out quite clearly, I think, in the essays in this volume on the writer Ivan Franko, the historian Dmytro Doroshenko, and, perhaps most of all, the political leader/historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky. All three men were giants in their fields and very important to their nation but are little known to most North American historians and to the North American public at large. It is my hope that the European training and interests displayed here bring a refreshingly new perspective to the history of an important Canadian/American eth­ nic group and also make a contribution to European history in its con­ nection with this continent. Finally, I think it would not be untoward to mention that the reprinted part of the articles and essays collected here, although generally updated and expanded, are still witnesses to their own times. They document some of the interests and conditions that prevailed during the last years of the Cold War, the Soviet reform period of perestroika and glasnost, and the first years of Ukrainian independence. Thus, as witnesses of those times, they are not entirely without interest in and of themselves. Of course, though the essays in this book are arranged chronologically with the historical materials first and more general materials later, it is not necessary for them to be read in this order. The general reader may choose what interests him most (biography, library studies, or whatever) and read it first and turn to the older materials only later, if they catch his interest. With all these considerations in mind, I entrust this volume to the hands of the reader and hope that he (or she) may enjoy going through it as much as I have enjoyed putting it together. Lege filiciter!\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI should first like to thank the various publishing houses and their edi­ tors and manuscript reviewers, often anonymous, who, earlier on, helped me to see some of these essays into print in their original editions. The possibilities they first offered me to share my ideas with others were a great encouragement to the writing and eventual revising, expanding, and updating of these pieces. I should also like to thank the editors and publishers of the various journals in which they first appeared for per­ mission to reprint them here. It was the distinguished historian of east­ ern Europe, the late Professor Peter Brock of the University of Toronto, concerned that for too long I had limited my writing to articles and re­ views, who pushed me into publishing still another book. With fond memories, I acknowledge him here. I would also like to thank the eminent sociologist Professor Wsevolod Isajiw (University of Toronto Emeritus) for his helpful comments on the manuscript, the respected folklorist Dr Robert Bohdan Klymasz of Winnipeg (formerly of the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa) for encouraging me to write on cer­ tain little-known but important Ukrainian Canadian topics, and my col­ leagues at the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, Toronto Office, Roman Senkus and Andrij Makuch, for their encouragement and many a useful bibliographical lead. I also thank Professor Frank Sysyn of the Peter Jacyk Centre for Ukrainian Historical Research at the University of Alberta for certain services rendered that helped to see this book into print. My editor pro tem at the University of Toronto Press Len Husband, my copy editor Pat Sanders, and my associate managing editor Frances Mundy expertly guided it forward to press. Some important funding for the book came from the Shevchenko Scientific Society, Toronto Branch, the Canadian Foundation for Ukrainian Studies, also in\n\nxiv Acknowledgments\n\nToronto, and the Ukrainian Studies Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I thank all three of these institutions for their generous support. But, most of all, I should like to thank my wife Yassy and my children Shahram and Cyrus, who were witnesses to the joys and travails of a (then relatively) young academic setting out to explore his ethnic roots in west­ ern Canada. The journey has been a long one, and one that has not yet ended, but it is one in which each of you has intimately participated, through numerous conversations about ethnicity and heritage, through homework assignments that you chose to do on Ukrainian or Ukrainian Canadian themes, or through simple attendance at Josef Cardinal Slipyj Ukrainian Catholic School in West Toronto. I especially thank my beauti­ ful Iranian wife Yassy (or Yassaman, as formal Persian would have it) for the respect she has always shown for her husband’s somewhat exotic (to her) Ukrainian Canadian heritage, which even included going to Kyiv and Soviet Ukraine to study Ukrainian in the bad old days when the KGB was constantly breathing down our necks but when Solidarity was already raising its banners in Poland and John Paul II had already blown the trumpet that would knock down the walls of Jericho and set such a large part of our world free. I also especially thank Shahram and Cyrus for bearing with their parents each time we met an interesting foreigner, or Canadian with a “foreign” accent in Toronto and elsewhere, and in­ quired about his or her background to the dismay of our somewhat more reserved children. It has been all part of the same cosmopolitan cultural quest, for true respect for, and knowledge of, one’s own heritage, with all its manifold and diverse sources, I have learned, often leads to respect for, and knowledge of, that of others. And so, with love and fond memo­ ries, I dedicate this book to all three of you.\n\n[1] hĕ’rĭtage, n. What is or may be inherited; (fig.) portion allotted to any one.

John of Salisbury, twelfth century\n\nBefore presenting the varied essays contained in this book, I think it ap­ propriate to say a few words about the title and some of the concepts used throughout the volume. First, the title: Gathering a Heritage is a fa­ miliar concept to most national historians of eastern and central Europe, but is less well known to mainstream Canadian and American historians and to Canadians and Americans in general, or, at least, less well known to such people in the way that I have used it here. For some time now, eastern European historians who write the histories of their respective countries, many of them missing from the political map of Europe be­ fore 1918, have divided into several stages the history of the national movements in their parts of the world; most of these movements were eventually successful to some extent, and the result was national inde­ pendence and the final appearance of these countries on maps. Thus interpreted, the stages of these national movements were, first, “heri­ tage gathering” by a relatively small elite of intellectuals of various sorts, then mass mobilization in various cultural and social organizations, and then political action sometimes resulting in military conflict and “wars of liberation.”1 The first great wave of Ukrainian or “Ruthenian” (as it was called at the time) immigration to Canada and the United States (which origi­ nated for the most part in the Habsburg Monarchy) occurred before 1914 and, to a certain degree, falls in-between the first and the second of\n\n4 Gathering a Heritage\n\nthese three stages; at least, for most of these immigrants, if not for the elite in their European homeland. In other words, “heritage gathering” and mass cultural organization were especially important for this initial wave of Ruthenian/Ukrainian immigrants to Canada and the United States. (The building of churches and the formation of religious com­ munities are cases in point, as were the establishment of prosvita or popu­ lar “enlightenment” societies striving to promote literacy in the native language and education in a national spirit.) Political involvement and the national movement existed both on the right and on the left of the political spectrum, but in Canada, at least, they were still in an embryo form to some degree. Indeed, the very name “Ukrainian,” with all its promising (or disconcerting, as the case may be) political and national implications, did not become predominant in Canada until the 1920s, and, more universally, in the 1930s, some twenty-five or thirty years after the immigration had begun. It was only then that this new name almost completely replaced older terms such as “Ruthenian” (applied previ­ ously to the new settlers by themselves) and “Galician” (applied previ­ ously to the settlers by many of their new Anglo Canadian neighbours). Indeed, as late as 1937, the Encyclopedia of Canada contained the article “Ukrainians” (which acknowledged that by that time they constituted the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Dominion after the British groups, the French, and the Germans), but also the somewhat scurrilous article “Galician Immigration,” which made no reference to the “Ukrainian na­ tionality” of most of these “newcomers” to the Prairies, while, among the Ukrainians themselves, the largest religious institution of the Ukrainian Canadians, the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church of Canada, retained its old name on the statute books until 1951.2 At this point, it is necessary to get personal. Three of my four grand­ parents belonged to this first pre-1914 “pioneer” wave, and I identify with it quite closely. When I was a boy in the western Canadian city of Winnipeg in the 1950s, I learned that I was of Ukrainian background, but knew nothing of the highly politicized Ukrainian “nationalist” move­ ment that came to dominate Ukrainian political life in the western parts of that country between the wars and afterwards. Thus, the third, more political, stage outlined above was somewhat alien to me. In fact, aside from a few folk customs observed by my family, I knew very little of Ukrainian culture and even language. Consequently, many years later, when I became interested in this background of things Ukrainian, I had to start almost from scratch. In fact, I consciously began to “gather a heritage,” about which I learned more and more over the course of the\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nfollowing years. Most of my scholarly career and the present book are just an extension of that long-lasting and serious but also very enjoyable en­ terprise. An unintended by-product is that this enterprise has also turned me somewhat more political and aware of “nationalist” versus “Communist” influences on, and conflicts concerning, my ethnic heritage. From a different viewpoint, of course, some Canadian and American observers might see this as an exemplary manifestation of the principle conventionally called “Hansen’s Law” once formulated by the American historian of immigration Marcus Lee Hansen (1892–1938), who famous­ ly wrote that “what the son wishes to forget, the grandson wishes to re­ member.” Hansen is now often interpreted to have meant a return not exactly to ethnicity but rather to a recollection of it. Moreover, more re­ cent observers have pointed out that this recollection or “rediscovery” of things past by the third generation is highly selective in nature, some things being deliberately forgotten while other things, especially those of a positive symbolic nature, purposefully cultivated. The elements cultivated greatly vary from folk dancing and various kinds of music to genealogy and history. In my particular case, study of the immigrant ex­ perience of my grandparents never quite squelched the feeling that I was “other” and “ethnic” but not “immigrant.” Indeed, I was aware at all times that Canadian history as I had been taught it – Mackenzie down the Mackenzie River, Fraser down the Fraser, representative government followed by responsible government in the two Canadas, and a Great War from 1914 to 1918 in which neither of my grandfathers, though resi­ dent in this country, in any way participated, or, presumably, were in support of – was a history that was at some distance from my family’s ex­ perience. In fact, I always considered the Great War to have been a futile and indescribably wasteful enterprise, its contribution to Canadian “na­ tion building” inadvertent and not all positive. And, when I did consider pre-twentieth-century Canadian history, I usually identified with the con­ quered Catholic French and not the conquering Protestant English or Scots; thus, I found Champlain and Montcalm to be congenial figures and preferred Louis Riel, the controversial Métis leader and founder of Manitoba, to John A. Macdonald, the foremost father of the Canadian Confederation and first prime minister of Canada. (My regional back­ ground and early education in a Manitoba Catholic school with its par­ ticular ethnic mix, which included both French and assimilated French Métis, were probably partly responsible for this orientation. Moreover, it was this particular background that most certainly led to my early uni­ versity studies in medieval history and the history of the Crusades, an\n\n6 Gathering a Heritage\n\ninternational phenomenon in which the country that we today call “France” played an especially significant role.) In general, however, my distance from what can be called the “triumphalism” of English Canadian history was probably due most of all to the fact that before the 1970s, “ethnic” history in the sense of the histories of the non-French and the non-British – that is, my history in particular – was not a part of the Canadian history curriculum and virtually no “ethnic” topics or even sur­ names appeared in the history textbooks. Moreover, though today, “eth­ nic studies” are very much a flourishing branch of Canadian sociology, the political and cultural historians still lag very far behind the social scientists and no proper ethnohistory of this country as yet exists, though partial immigration histories in English, and preparatory studies of vari­ ous other sorts, including collections of source materials, have been done in several languages, of which Ukrainian, Polish, and German, not to speak of French, are very important for the prairie region. Indeed, Canadian ethnic history is still too often lumped together indiscrimi­ nately with immigration history and no significant distinction is made between the two. This is an obfuscation, gleefully promoted by certain unsympathetic establishment and assimilationist historians, which com­ pletely ignores the evolution of Canadian ethnicity through the genera­ tions and is in desperate need of correction. My personal journey from textbook Canadian history through European, medieval, and world his­ tory, to immigration history, and finally to Canadian ethnic history lies at the base of the present book and forms the essence of this heritagegathering project at its core.3 Of course, heritage gathering of the type in which I have long been engaged has certain implications for Canadian history as a whole. Writing before 1939, the famous English Canadian humorist Stephen Leacock, who was not known to have much sympathy for “continental” immigrants to this country, could already foresee such a development and seems to have objected to it. “Leave them alone,” he declared, “and pretty soon the Ukrainians will think that they won the battle of Trafalgar.” In fact, as indicated above, I make no claims about the Battle of Trafalgar, but I do think the history of my own family and that of my ethnic confreres, as well as of many of those in parallel groups sometimes considered “oth­ ers,” forms a good part of Canadian history, and an understanding of the historical myths that formed these particular ethnicities is necessary to develop a more balanced understanding of Canadian society as a whole. As the Austrian Canadian historian Franz Szabo boldly put it: Cossacks as well as coureurs-de-bois!4\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nAs to Canadian history and the heirs of the Cossacks, one might add that the link between the two recurrently bubbles to the surface at cer­ tain crucial times. For example, not only were the Ukrainians important in the settling of the Prairies, but it was they who were among the first to raise the ire of Anglo Canadian “nativists” (to use the polite term) at the beginning of the twentieth century; it was they and their fellow “ethnics” (usually called “foreigners” at the time) who complicated the Manitoba school question; it was they who formed the bulk of the unjustly interned “enemy aliens” during the Great War; they, among others, who were the butt of the rightist reaction during and after the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919; they who provided much of the rank and file of the Communist Party of Canada during the Great Depression and who vol­ unteered in numbers to join the international brigades fighting the royalists/nationalists during the Spanish Civil War; they who were blamed for much of the “no” vote on the Prairies after the acrimonious Conscrip­ tion Plebiscite of 1942 that split the country down the middle; they who inspired John Diefenbaker’s fiery September 1960 United Nations speech condemning the evils of Communism and calling for the free­ dom of the “captive nations,” and Ukraine in particular; they who formed one of the most prominent parts of the ethnic alliance that brought Ed Schreyer’s NDP to power in Manitoba in 1969 and rejoiced when, several years later, he was appointed the first non-British, non-French, that is, “ethnic,” Governor General of Canada (Schreyer was actually of Galician German ancestry; his wife was of Bukovinian German ancestry); it was they who led the boisterous protests that shook Toronto and embar­ rassed Prime Minister Trudeau during the state visit of Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in the early 1970s; it was they who led the fight for a mul­ ticultural Canada at the time of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, a fight that they legally won with the federal govern­ ment’s proclamation of official multiculturalism in 1971, and that they symbolically won with Schreyer’s appointment to Ottawa, reiterated a decade later with Ray Hnatyshyn’s appointment as the second Governor General of “ethnic” origin and the first of Ukrainian ancestry; and final­ ly, in a partial reversal of their predominantly leftish tendencies before 1939, it was they, or at least some of their most active political leaders, who most openly bucked the Jewish and left-wing lobbies and insisted on a wider historical perspective, due process, and a fair hearing for those Canadian citizens accused of being involved in Nazi war crimes, generally one of the worst libels that any innocent individual or osten­ sibly implicated community could endure during the last decades of the\n\n8 Gathering a Heritage\n\ntwentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first. Their political spectrum was always exceedingly broad, their politics always exciting; their social life was always lively, and their religious life tumultuous as much as tranquil. During most of their time in this country, they formed a seriously divided but very vigorous Canadian community with politi­ cally opposed but perennially recurring traditions; and, throughout the twentieth century, this community and these traditions repeatedly pro­ vided some very colourful chinks, red and white, blue and yellow, in the ever-changing kaleidoscope that is Canadian society. They are a Canadian ethnic group, an “ethnicity,” if you will, with a story to tell, and those es­ tablishment historians, either political elitists on the “right” such as Jack Granatstein or social homogenizers on the “left” such as Gerald Friesen, who would cross them out of Canadian history for the sake of a more narrow national narrative, do a serious disservice to their country.5 Of course, the history of Canada itself in relative terms is not all that long and, though the Ukrainian Canadians have been a part of it through­ out most of its time as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire, and all of its time as an independent country, the freshness of their experience and a certain pioneering mentality permeate their cul­ ture, which is almost stereotypically designated as “ethnic.” Witness the fiery Ukrainian dancers who, over many decades, almost always per­ formed for Queen Elizabeth II on her state visits to western Canada and the girls with their embroidered Ukrainian costumes with ribbons flow­ ing who ceremoniously offered her bread and salt. Though only dating back to the royal visit of 1939, which was aimed to bolster Canadian sup­ port for the coming war in Europe, such traditions are fairly old in rela­ tive terms; that is, both the custom of offering bread and salt and the monarchy and civic tradition that they honour are centuries old. It is the coming together of the two that remains fresh and striking and particu­ larly Canadian. On a different level, it has to be admitted that, in a certain sense, the general concept of “ethnicity” and, indeed, the very word itself, is also new. It does not appear, for example, in Walter Skeat’s famous Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, which was first published at the turn of the nineteenth century (the time when a particularly famous Canadian postage stamp bore the proud motto: “We hold a vaster em­ pire than has been!”). This dictionary, however, does list the word “eth­ nic” and tells us that it is derived through the Latin ethnicus from the Greek ethnikos, meaning “national.” The Greek noun ethnos, from which the adjective derives, at one time had the double connotation of “nation”\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nand “foreign people,” as is revealed in the Greek version of the Bible, where it is used to translate the Hebrew term goy, meaning a non-Israelite or “gentile” nation. For about three centuries, in the English language, the “foreign” or more strikingly “heathen” meaning of the word seemed to predominate, but by the middle of the nineteenth century, the sim­ pler meaning of “a people” began to hold sway. The term “ethnicity” it­ self seems to have been first applied to so-called “immigrant groups” and their descendants in 1941 by the American anthropologist W. Lloyd Warner, who may have felt something of the original double meaning of the root word. Traditionally, the term “ethnicity” has some relation to the concept of “race,” but is also somewhat distinct from it, since, in commonsensical terms, a person can at times cultivate or discard his or her ethnic back­ ground, but cannot do quite the same for race. Of course, as the sociolo­ gists assure us, “race,” too, is largely a social convention or construct, since, for example, a person of a certain racial type in the United States may find himself placed in a different racial category in Brazil or some other country. Moreover, both “ethnicity” and “race” are concepts that were constantly changing throughout the twentieth century and the for­ mer ever more frequently replaced the latter since its misuse by the Nazis in the middle of that century. For example, the Canadian census once counted people of various “racial origins” but now discusses only “ethnic groups” and “visible minorities.” There are, at present, generally two different uses of the term “ethnic” in North American scholarship. One restricts usage to persons of nonEnglish background (or, in Canada, to persons of a “non-charter group” – that is, non-English and non-French background), while the other ac­ knowledges that all people have some kind of ethnic background or other, and this includes elite White Anglo Saxon Protestant Sons (WASPS) as well. In the title of the present work, the word “ethnic” appears and is used in the narrower sense, which excludes the English and also, to some degree, the other British groups. I do this consciously, not because I wish to deprive English Canadians of their heritage (it is well stated in most mainstream Canadian history books), but rather to emphasize what these books have generally ignored or belittled: the history of us “others.”6 It must be acknowledged, however, that ethnicity is a variable thing, culturally learned as much as genetically inherited, and can be put on or taken off at various times. It is created over time, and sometimes, as the asssimilationists constantly remind us, it passes away. In North America, many immigrant groups typically at first often had only local, regional,\n\n10 Gathering a Heritage\n\nor religious identities, which were later wielded into national or broad­ er “ethnic” identities by the social pressures of North America and the influence of events occurring on the international stage. For example, as mentioned above, the Ukrainian Canadian identity and even the “Ukrai­ nian” name itself developed out of earlier regional and religious identi­ ties, and, on the Prairies, firmly congealed only in the 1920s. Other groups such as the Polish and the Italians also went through this process of transformation from local to national identities, though for the most part without the striking change of name that was characteristic of the Ukrainians. Some groups never did completely congeal, as, for example, “German” Canadians and Mennonites, who to this day remain seriously divided along religious lines that impede the emergence of a single ­ethnic identity. Boundaries are also important. In other words, how do ethnic groups define themselves and mark themselves off from their neighbours? Leav­ ing this question unanswered sometimes leads to puzzling problems. For example, through most of the twentieth century, the Canadian censuses showed there were significantly more Ukrainian speakers in the country than there were Ukrainians. This would be unremarkable for a promi­ nent group with an internationally recognized language like the Germans or even the Russians. But for a little-known group, which throughout most of the century did not even possess its own state, like the Ukrainians, it was indeed remarkable. Ukrainian Canadian historians typically ex­ plained it by saying that for a long time, citizens of Ukrainian back­ ground were still often incorrectly registered as Austrians, Russians, or even Poles.7 But it also could be that the Ukrainians, being by far the largest Slavonic group in the country and comprising the third-largest group on the Prairies after the British groups and the Germans, exer­ cised an assimilative effect on their Slavic neighbours, especially those Roman Catholics from Galicia, and their children, who, in Europe, the United States, or even in eastern Canada, would be usually counted as “Poles.” Thus, throughout twentieth-century Canada, the ethnic markers were in this particular case not always clear. In addition to this, it should be noted that, in western Canada at least, when newspapers, politics, and political pamphleteering are put aside, on the personal level this Ukrainian–Polish relationship was usually posi­ tive. Intermarriage was always quite common and the large numbers of Canadian Roman Catholics who today adhere to Ukrainian ethnicity are, at least in part, evidence of it. Once again, this throws light on the element of choice in the acquisition of ethnicity. Children of mixed\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nparentage can usually openly choose which ethnicity to adopt. In my own family, which is the typically mixed Ukrainian and Polish, I always felt myself Ukrainian, though I was aware that one of my grandfathers was Polish and subscribed to the famous Winnipeg Polish weekly Czas (Time). Indeed, even he hailed from pre-1914 eastern Galicia, southern Podillia, to be exact, a predominantly Ukrainian region that was incor­ porated into the Ukrainian SSR in 1944 as part of the Ternopil region. By contrast, one of my sisters, who visited Poland during a very formative part of her life, identifies more closely with a Polish identity, and I had a close uncle (my mother’s brother Edward Miedzybrocki) who attended a Ukrainian church, spoke a bit of Ukrainian, knew practically no Polish at all, and still considered himself to be Polish and not Ukrainian. For a time, he was, in fact, president of the Canadian Polish Professional and Businessmen’s Association in Manitoba. This mixing is, as I have said, a typically western Canadian phenome­ non, but such situations are not unique to Canada. They also occurred in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century eastern Europe. Thus, the foremost spokesman for integral Ukrainian nationalism, Dmytro Dontsov, an extremist if there ever was one, who actually immigrated to Canada after 1945, ironically had a brother who declared himself “Russian,” while in western Ukraine under Poland from 1919 to 1939, the leader of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who was a national hero of no little import, came from a prominent Polish family with quite distant “Ruthenian” roots. His brother became a Polish general. All this would seem to push the explanation for ethnicity into the “chosen” or “invented” rather than the “inherited” or “primordial” camp, and, among social scientists today, supporters of the “invented” concept seem to hold the upper hand.8 Certainly, in the writing of the articles in this book, I have sometimes felt myself constrained to bypass the vagaries of real life and, to no little degree, accept the given boundaries of a welldefined ethnic group. Nevertheless, I remain a Ukrainian Canadian with a significant and valued Polish heritage, and it occasionally shows in this volume dedicated to heritage gathering. Of course, heritage gathering never ends and, with the passage of time, new material sometimes comes to the fore. This is particularly true in times of great political and social change, and there is no doubt that East European, Ukrainian, and Ukrainian Canadian studies in the 1980s and 1990s were deeply affected by such changes. For example, the first draft of the essay on Ivan Franko in this volume was written when the Cold War was still underway and Soviet materials were still very heavily\n\n12 Gathering a Heritage\n\ncensored. Since that time, Franko’s literary, scholarly, and journalistic corpus has been much more fully published and new nuances added to his biography. In fact, for readers in Ukraine itself, this biography has been completely reinterpreted. With regard to Franko and Canada, suf­ fice it to say that we now know for certain that the great writer himself once considered emigrating to this country. Thus, on 18 May 1895, Franko wrote to his political mentor Mykhailo Drahomanov that things were going badly for him in Galicia and that he was ready to emigrate to some other country. He continued: “At this time, we are talking a lot about Canada here with Dr Oleskiv. In the middle of July, he is going there to seek a place for Ruthenian colonists, and if an appropriate place can be located and the possibility of founding a nice colony demonstrat­ ed, I will be the first who is ready to go across the ocean.”9 This letter was unknown to me in 1983 when I wrote my first essay on Franko and Canada. It has been integrated into the updated and much expanded essay appearing here. On a somewhat different level, I think it necessary to consider some terms that occur repeatedly in this book and may need some explanation for readers unfamiliar with the subjects considered here. The first two are the terms “Slavonic” and “Slavic.” These two terms are used inter­ changeably in the present work to refer to the largest ethnolinguistic group of peoples in eastern Europe and their descendants in North America. Many writers approaching Canadian and American ethnic his­ tory use the term “Slavic” and avoid the term “Slavonic.” This is probably because, among academics on this continent, “Slavic Studies” are now an established discipline and the term “Slavonic” is generally restricted to the medieval world where the liturgical language of the early South Slavs is referred to as “Old Church Slavonic,” and its derivatives in the eastern Slavic world are referred to as forms or “redactions” of “Church Slavonic.” By contrast, in Britain, the parallel discipline is referred to as “Slavonic Studies” and the relevant modern languages and modern peoples of eastern Europe are often referred to as the “Slavonic languages” and the “Slavonic peoples.” My choice to mix the two terms is a conscious one, not only because the potential readership of this book extends past Canada and the United States to Britain and beyond, but also because I feel that the term “Slavonic” somewhat restores a bit of the medieval gravitas that emigration to the New World cut off for so many poor im­ migrants of earlier times. Indeed, the children and grandchildren of these early immigrants were often so very alienated from their ancient European roots that one prominent Polish American historian, John J.\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nBukowczyk, even titled his master work on this subject as And My Children Did Not Know Me: A History of the Polish Americans.10 My use here of the term “Slavonic” is a road sign indicating the direction in which the de­ scendants of older immigrants may go to find and recover some littleknown but very profound parts of their ancestral heritage. Furthermore, as is well known to philologists and medieval historians, the apparently unrelated words “Slavic” and “slave-like” are, in fact, etymologically re­ lated (both are derived from the medieval Latin word sclavus, meaning first “Slav” and then later “slave”), and the use in this book of the (for some North Americans) literary and archaic-sounding term “Slavonic” is an attempt to put somewhat more distance between the two and restore a certain pristine dignity to the root of this word, which, in its origins, was almost certainly positive.11 The second term or phrase that may be unfamiliar to some readers is what I, inspired by several American and Canadian writers on the sub­ ject, call “the Great Migration,” or “the Great Economic Immigration,” or variants of these forms. As is repeatedly explained in the essays that follow, this term refers on one level to the great eastern and southern European immigration to the Americas that occurred between the 1880s and the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. American historians often call it the “New Immigration,” which contrasts, in their view, with the preceding “Old Immigration,” which was predominantly from the British Isles and northwestern Europe. (This was a period of enormous change in the ethnohistory of North America and caused a certain amount of panic in some quarters.)12 In my view, however, and not in my view alone, this language of “old” and “new” is now somewhat obsolete. This is be­ cause, after a long period in the first half of the twentieth century of rela­ tively limited immigration to the United States from Europe (less limited in Canada), and a short period of resettlement of refugees at the end of the Second World War, in the 1970s, a still newer mass immigration from the Third World, particularly Asia, began. As did the Great Economic Immigration from 1880 to 1914, this new immigration, largely of people who joined the so-called visible minorities in North America, greatly changed the ethnic and cultural makeup of Canada and the United States. Thus, it, too, can be referred to as a “New Immigration,” though, for many groups such as the Chinese and certain others, it had prece­ dents in earlier times. With regard to specifically Prairie Canadian history, and the history of the Ukrainian Canadians, the pioneer or Great Economic Immigration is a very apt designation, for it was in numerical terms by far the greatest\n\n14 Gathering a Heritage\n\nimmigration of eastern Europeans in general, and Ukrainians in particu­ lar, to this region, and it distinguishes very clearly between this immigra­ tion and the much smaller interwar immigration (still largely economic), and the smaller still, politically motivated, refugee immigration post1945, which is usually referred to as the Displaced Persons (DP) immi­ gration. The more recent post-Soviet immigration to Canada has also been relatively small in numerical terms, though, to some extent, it is undoubtedly important in rejuvenating certain institutions of the orga­ nized Ukrainian community in the country. (It provides Ukrainian-fluent staff for certain museums, libraries, and academic institutions founded by earlier waves of Ukrainian Canadians whose children and grandchil­ dren are now mostly assimilated and English speaking, though many un­ doubtedly retain a clear memory of their “ethnic” origins and identify in some ways with things Ukrainian.) These four “waves” of Ukrainian im­ migration to Canada, as it were, form the paradigm around which Ukrai­ nian Canadian history is usually organized, and the pioneer or Great Economic Immigration was the first and by far the largest of these waves. Finally, this terminology again varies with geographical emphasis. When the “push” factors in Europe are paramount, the term used for the pre1914 period is the “Great Economic Emigration,” since the stress is on leaving; when the “pull” factors in North America are more important, the term becomes the “Great Economic Immigration,” since the stress is on arriving. This distinction between emigration and immigration is often glossed over by historians dealing in an unequal way with either Europe or the Americas who usually reveal either a Euro-centric or American-centred view. In this way, for example, some historians often write of political “émi­ grés” while others write about economic “immigrants.” This question of émigrés versus immigrants is manifested in various forms in different ethnic communities. Among the Ukrainian Canadians, for example, the distinction between the first two waves of economic im­ migrants and the third or DP wave was often remarked on in earlier times by participants in these waves and was later noted by historians. In western Canada in the 1970s, I myself noticed the appearance of young “nationalist” missionaries from the East, children of the DP immigration, who had come to western Canada with the noblest of intentions to spread the national gospel among the largely assimilated grandchildren of the older economic immigration. This elitist tenor of a good part of the DP immigration, throughout the second half of the twentieth century, was particularly strong in Toronto, the metropolitan centre of the DP immi­ gration, and produced a certain amount of friction with its somewhat\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nless political confreres. Moreover, western Canadian regionalism and re­ sentment of Toronto’s cultural pretensions and important role in Cana­ dian society may have deepened this divide. Certainly, Torontonian civic pride and sometimes dismissive, sometimes good-natured, joking about provincial and frosty “Winterpeg,” which was, to the 1970s, the metro­ politan centre of the older economic immigration, did not help. But the division was not limited to Canada’s Ukrainians or even to Canada, riven as it is with various regional tensions. More generally, among some eastern European communities in the United States, where regionalism among these groups is much less pronounced, this friction still reached remarkable proportions. For example, in the 1980s, a sharp exchange occurred on the pages of the New York Times Book Review be­ tween the Nobel Prize-winning Polish poet Czesław Miłosz (a newer, post-1945 political émigré who had lived for a while under the Communist dictatorship) and Stanislaus Blejwas (an historian of the older, economic Polish immigration). Miłosz bemoaned what he called “the incredible cultural crudeness of Polish-Americans” and Blejwas replied to the poet by noting “that intolerant prejudice unique to intellectuals, namely, the contemptuous condemnation of the masses who do not read or under­ stand him.” The Polish American historian James S. Pula concluded that this peculiar debate reflected the old divide between the nobles or szlachta and the peasants who lived under them in pre-Communist Polish society in eastern Europe. Among the Ukrainian Canadians, the friction between the older immigrants and the DPs, to my knowledge, never reached the same intensity or, at least, literary levels as among Polish Americans, but the difference in ambience was, for several decades at least, very real. The use in this book of the term \"Great Economic Immigration\" at­ tempts to remove from the picture all condescension of the Miłosz type and its concomitant frictions.13 The third term or phrase that may require some explanation is what I call the “Long Cold War.” By this term I mean the long-standing conflict between the Soviet Union and the West that occurred between the de­ feat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and the final collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Certain historians who advocate the concept of a shorter Cold War date the beginning of this conflict somewhat later – for example, with the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948 – and end it some­ what earlier – for example, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the libera­ tion of “eastern Europe” in 1989. But for the Ukrainian Canadians, as one of the anonymous readers of this manuscript pointed out to me, the Cold War was already in full swing by the 1920s and 1930s, and, after a\n\n16 Gathering a Heritage\n\nbrief period of suppression from 1941 to 1945 (the period of the “Grand Alliance” between the Western democracies and the USSR), certainly took on a new vigor after 1945; and, for Ukrainians in Europe, it was 1991 and the declaration of national independence from the USSR that was the great turning point and not the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall. The year 1991 actually meant that “eastern Europe” now extended some 800 kilometres further east to the new border between independent European Ukraine and a somewhat different “Eurasian” Russia. Most importantly, the term “Long Cold War” also puts to rest the illusion that the Sino–Soviet conflict and other events of the 1960s and 1970s somehow diluted or ended cer­ tain aspects of this conflict, especially the ideological aspects, that di­ rectly concerned the population of Ukraine and were of great import to almost all of the organized Ukrainian community in Canada and the United States. This view was widespread among Western historians of international relations right until 1991, but it was never shared by most Ukrainian scholars working in the West who were always well aware that political repression in Ukraine and the censorship of political materials and of scholarship of all kinds continued right through to the Gorbachev Reforms of the late 1980s.14 In this way, the term “Long Cold War,” like other terms frequently used in this book, such as “ethnic,” “ethnicity,” “ethnic history,” “Slavonic,” “Slavic,” “emigration,” “immigration,” the “Great Economic Migration,” and “heritage gathering,” takes on a special meaning. It is to be hoped that this meaning adds something to the understanding of the reader to whom these concepts may be less well defined and to whom the debates surrounding them may be somewhat new. Finally, it is necessary to say a few words about the organization of the book. It is divided into four separate sections, each reflecting a certain connection between Europe and the Americas and using the concepts described above. In the first section, “Emigration Studies,” the materials are set in chronological order and pass from the general to the particu­ lar. Thus, the first essay on the Great Migration in the literatures of the Slavs treats the oldest emigration from eastern Europe to the Americas before 1914, the so-called pioneer era, and takes in all of both regions; the second essay concentrates more specifically on the Russian Empire and North America; and the third zeros in on the old Austrian Crown Land of Galicia, the Ukrainian emigration from this land to western Canada, and the role of the writer Ivan Franko in helping to prompt this emigration. The fourth essay in this section takes the story out of the pioneer era and treats the interwar emigration from the Republic of\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nPoland to Canada. But, in many ways, this later interwar emigration was merely an extension of the earlier pioneer emigration. The new immi­ grants to Canada had largely the same social profile as the earlier ones did and they mostly came from exactly the same part of Europe: old Austrian Galicia, which was annexed to the Republic of Poland in 1918– 19 and offically renamed Eastern Little Poland by the new Polish govern­ ment and its agencies. With regard to my particular heritage, I should point out that although three of my grandparents came to Canada be­ fore 1914 with Austrian passports from old Galicia, the fourth, my mater­ nal grandmother, although an ethnic Ukrainian, came from this same region in 1925 with a new Polish passport. On a different level, post-1945, this same region underwent further political change and was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR; by then, its emi­ grants to Canada were fleeing the advance of the Red Army westward and were, therefore, quite political, which was very different from most of their predecessors, who were, by and large, purely economic immi­ grants. This comes out in the present book in the essays dealing with anti-Communist Ukrainian émigré scholars, many of whom, such as the philologist J. B. Rudnyckyj or the historian Lubomyr Wynar, hailed from this same area, though, as the recent and exhaustive study of Wynar’s Ukrainian Historical Association by Alla Atamanenko has shown, Wynar himself tried very hard to have all of modern Ukraine represented on the pages of the association’s journal, Ukrainskyi istoryk (The Ukrai­nian historian).15 Thus, the spectacular and repeated border changes in twentieth-­century eastern Europe played a role in forming the charac­ ter of Ukrainian and eastern European immigration to North America, but did not change it completely. The second section in the book, “History, Historians, and Others,” also has an emphasis on pre-1945 developments, but goes on to deal with some of the contributions of post-1945 immigrants. It starts with a con­ sideration of the career of the historian Dmytro Doroshenko, who visit­ ed Canada twice in the 1930s and finally immigrated to this country in the late 1940s. It continues with treatments of the Canadian historian George W. Simpson and his relations with the Ukrainian Canadians; it then turns to an examination of how the subject of Ukrainian history was treated in the 1930s, then during the war of 1939 to 1945, and then again during the Cold War period. The general theme here is one of slow but steady growth and constantly increasing professionalism, the shift from the spread of literacy and popular education (as, for example, in the prosvita or “enlightenment” societies) to scholarship and higher\n\n18 Gathering a Heritage\n\nforms of learning (as, for example, in various post-1945 émigré academ­ ic institutions). The emphasis on the origins of Ukrainian Canadian scholarship in the pioneer, interwar, and Second World War eras reflects my own family background, while the treatments of the DP emigration post-1945 and its contribution to historical and other scholarship reflects my professional training under the influence of some of these DP schol­ ars. The final essay in this section, that on Gabrielle Roy, ties in to inter­ war developments and reflects the yearning for higher education among the earlier immigrants as well as the striking political developments of the 1930s and the personal life of the principal protagonists, Gabrielle Roy and Stephen Davidovich, the latter of whom ended as a professor of public administration at York University in Toronto. The third group of essays, “Library Studies and Reference Works,” continues some of the themes raised in the second section. The career of the distinguished Winnipeg philologist J. B. Rudnyckyj is examined with regard to his contributions to “Library Science,” as the field was called at the time, and reflects the state of Ukrainian émigré scholarship during the Cold War era, especially the central years of this long period. The second essay in this section (on Mykhailo Hrushevsky) is my own personal assessment of what I discovered about Ukrainian history and Ukrainian émigré scholarship towards the end of this Long Cold War and continues the “books and libraries” theme. The third essay in this section on the Ukrainian Canadians in the encyclopedias sums up the general history of this group and says a lot about how its members were viewed throughout the various periods of Canadian history from the 1890s to the present. The evolution described here in certain ways paral­ lels points made in the earlier essays and puts them within a more gen­ eral context. These three essays are followed by a final section consisting of a single essay with some concluding ruminations comparing the Ukrainian expe­ rience in Canada with that in the United States. This piece makes some general remarks on the idea of multiculturalism as it has developed in Canada over the last few decades and how this has diverged from ethnic experiences in the great American Republic to Canada’s south, where the idea of the melting pot has always been very prominent, though not necessarily all-encompassing. In sum, all the essays included in this volume reflect the heritage I have been collecting over the course of the last few decades. They move from basic questions of emigration and immigration, to the first fragile fruits of education in the New World, and then to the fuller development\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nof Ukrainian scholarship on this continent. This process began with pop­ ular education and the national movement as expressed by “popular enlighteners” such as the writer Ivan Franko and other Slavic figures, continued through further enlighteners such as Mykhailo Hrushevsky and Dmytro Doroshenko, was transferred to Canada and given a special Canadian spirit by men such as George W. Simpson, was observed and commented on by no less a writer than Gabrielle Roy, and reached a certain maturity in the work of émigrés such as the Ukrainian American Lubomyr Wynar and the Ukrainian Canadian J.

Of course, Ukrainian culture on this continent has progressed considerably since the end of the Long Cold War, and, it must be said, the heyday of Ukrainian émigré scholarship is now long gone. Nevertheless, I am, in part, most definitely a product of certain of these developments and, like Bernard of Chartres so many years ago, I acknowledge that the heritage I have gathered here clearly reflects that state.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nEmigration Studies\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 The Great Migration: East-Central Europe to the Americas in the Literatures of the Slavs, Some Examples\n\nIterum. Ubi bene, ibi patria. (Again. Where it’s good, that’s where the homeland lies.)\n\nWith apologies to Emily Greene Balch\n\nThe century that preceded the First World War saw one of the greatest voluntary movements of population in world history. Quite literally, mil­ lions of European citizens, some city people, but mostly townsfolk and villagers, deserted their homelands and boarded trains and then oceangoing ships for the New World. They headed for both North America and South America. The movement began in western and northern Europe, but, by the 1850s, had encompassed Germany and central Europe, and, by the end of the century, engulfed southern and eastern Europe. During the first years of the twentieth century, Italy, the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy, and the western borderlands of the Russian Empire became the principal focal points of the emigration movement.1 By the middle of the nineteenth century, this mass movement of ordi­ nary people, labourers from the towns and agriculturalists from the vil­ lages, had already touched certain territories inhabited by the Slavonic peoples of Europe. The westernmost of the ethnographically Slavic ter­ ritories were, of course, the first to be affected. Thus, the first mass mi­ gration of Slavonic peoples to the Americas emanated primarily from Polish-speaking lands such as Pomerania, the Poznan region, and Prussia in imperial Germany, and from Czech-speaking Bohemia and the Croat lands in the Habsburg Monarchy. Afterwards, this so-called emi­ gration fever caught Slovakia and Trans-Carpathian Ukraine (or “Upper\n\n24 Emigration Studies\n\nHungary,” as these territories were called at the time), “Austrian Galicia” (which was inhabited for the most part by Poles in the west and by Ukrainians or “Ruthenians,” as they were then usually called, in the east), and also the land known as the Congress Kingdom of Poland with­ in the Russian empire. Finally, the movement spread to the western bor­ derlands of Russia itself and encompassed the territory inhabited by Belarusans, Ukrainians, and, to a lesser degree, by Russians.2 In a pattern that was common throughout most of these lands, iso­ lated individuals, political émigrés, and colourful adventurers of various sorts preceded the mass migration of country folk. Among the Slavs, the Poles are definitely the best example, with political émigrés and military men such as Tadeusz Kościuszko and Kazimierz Pułaski playing signifi­ cant roles in American revolutionary history and Sir Cazimir Gzowski playing a prominent role in nineteenth-century Canadian public life. Polish political émigrés were also early arrivals in Latin America, and, for example, the Brazilian emperor Pedro I, while visiting Paris, even shout­ ed out “Vive la Pologne” when he found himself at the theatre, by chance, at a play put on for Polish émigrés from the November Insurrection. The audience reciprocated with a shout of “Vive l’Empereur du Brézil’.”3 Other examples of early Slavic political refugees and assorted adventur­ ers include the Czechs Augustine Herman (c. 1605–1696) and Frederick Philipse (1616–1701), who emigrated to colonial America, the Slovak inventor Jozef Murgas (1864–1929), who emigrated to the United States in the late nineteenth century, the Slovene Roman Catholic missionary Frederick Baraga (1797–1868), and Ferdinand Konščak (1703–1759), the Croat Jesuit explorer who helped demonstrate that Baja California was a peninsula and not an island. Finally, there was Ahapii Honcharenko (Agapius Goncha­renko) (1832–1916), who came to America from the Kiev region of the Russian Empire, founded the Alaska Herald, the first Russian-language newspaper in the United States, and tried to establish a Ukrainian socialist colony in California during the early years of the twentieth century. Both Russian and Ukrainian historians include Honcharenko in the history of their respective communities in America, though undoubtedly he was a nationally conscious Ukrainian.4 When, in the 1870s, emigration from the Slavonic countries in Europe began to take on a new, more plebian, and much more massive charac­ ter, there were, once again, a few exceptional personalities. These in­ cluded a small number of intellectuals and writers who witnessed this mass exodus of eastern European country folk, in some cases even visit­ ing or planning to visit the New World themselves, and sat down to\n\nThe Great Migration 25\n\ndescribe what they believed to be this unique migration in travellers' tales, memoirs, fictional accounts, and poetic works of various sorts. By far the most famous name among these literary observers is that of Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846–1916), who attracted world attention by his historical novels of seventeenth-century Poland and of Christian hero­ ism in ancient Rome. His grand trilogy of historical novels on the fall of the old Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, which were published be­ tween 1883 and 1888, are tales replete with love and war, and made him the most popular Polish writer of his time. In 1905, his Quo Vadis, a tale about the persecution of Christians in ancient Rome, won the Nobel Prize for literature. Sienkiewicz, who was of lesser gentry origin, had be­ gun his career as a journalist for the Warsaw newspaper Gazeta Polska (Polish gazette) where, under the pseudonym “Litwos,” he published a series of “letters” or feuilletons in which he described the petty episodes of ordinary life and paid some attention to what nineteenth-century ob­ servers euphemistically called “the Social Question.” In these early writ­ ings, one can find a “realistic” and very touching picture of the hard life of the Slavic country folk.5 It was on a romantic whim, it seems, that Sienkiewicz and a group of his Polish intellectual friends, including the famous Polish actress Helena Modrzejewska (who came to be known in the English-speaking world as Helen Modjeska), decided to leave Warsaw to live a freer, ostensibly more “natural” life on a frontier commune in far-off California. Sienkiewicz’s experience with this ill-fated socialistic experiment, his descriptions of American life in the 1870s, and his observations of the beginning of or­ ganized Polish life in America and the initial phase of the mass migra­ tion of the Polish peasantry were published immediately in the form of a series of “Letters” to the readers of the Gazeta Polska. In turn, this Warsaw paper paid for the cost of the expedition.6 Sienkiewicz and his friends knew that other European intellectuals had preceded them in the voyage to the New World. In his Listy z podróży do Ameryki (Letters from my travels in America, published in English as Portrait of America: Letters of Henry Sienkiewicz), the Polish novelist men­ tioned both the American Notes of Charles Dickens and Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville. The former had been translated into Polish in 1844; the latter was widely read throughout Europe in the nine­ teenth century. Certain Polish writers, too, had dealt with American themes: Julian Horain dispatched enthusiastic reports from California; Christine Narbutt published the account “In America,” and Roger Lubieński, Sygurd Wiśniowski, and Kalikst Wolski all printed several\n\n26 Emigration Studies\n\narticles on the subject.7 But it is in Sienkiewicz that can be found the bestknown descriptions of the initial stages of mass Polish economic migra­ tion, and it was Sienkiewicz who produced the first important work of fiction in Polish dealing with this migration. Most of Sienkiewicz’s Listy z podróży do Ameryki dealt with the author’s impressions of the New World and of American life and character. Only one letter (number thirteen) directly treats the mass migration of the Polish peasantry and the new Polish communities in America. But even in this brief letter, Sienkiewicz makes several observations that become major themes in his fictional tale about the Great Economic Migration. Sienkiewicz deals first with the difficulties of the ocean crossing and the motivations of the peasant travellers: “In search of bread and freedom which we did not have back home,” they tell him. Then came the delight followed by the shock of landing in bustling New York and the sudden realization that “there would be no one with whom they could speak in the Catholic language.” Sienkiewicz does not minimize the horrendous physical and psychological difficulties the new immigrants had to face, and concluded that “their lot is a severe and terrifying one and whoever would depict it accurately would create an epic of human misery.”8 This is exactly what Sienkiewicz was to do in his intensely moving short story \"Za chlebem\" (For bread). \"Za chlebem\" was written after Sienkiewicz had returned to Poland from his travels in America. It was first read publicly in 1880 at a gather­ ing in the Warsaw City Hall held for the financial benefit of poor country folk who had gotten in trouble with the law. Afterwards, it was printed in the Gazeta Polska and the Dziennik Poznański (The Poznan daily), two of the leading Polish newspapers. The press notices stressed the emotional power and cruel reality of Sienkiewicz’s tale. It was obvious that he had written this piece as a warning to all who would venture from hearth and home in search of fortune in unknown lands far away.9 In this particular case, the story did not attribute emigration to po­ litical conditions, but, rather, Sienkiewicz’s protagonists, old Vavron Toporek and his beautiful daughter Marysia, went to America as a result of a curious combination of local crop failures, a frustrating legal dispute with a neighbour, and the none-too-fortuitous arrival of a cunning German emigration agent. After a difficult ocean crossing marked by overcrowding and fear of death by storm, Vavron and young Marysia ar­ rive in New York City, where ignorance of the language, lack of money, and the generally terrible living conditions throw Vavron into such a fit of despair that he almost kills his daughter. However, a chance meeting\n\nThe Great Migration 27\n\nwith an established Polish gentleman leads to their resettlement in a Polish colony on the Arkansas frontier. Such an opportunity to plough the virgin soil of the West was the dream of almost all Slavic immigrants of rural background, and Sienkiewicz allows the colony to flourish. For a brief time, Vavron's and Marysia’s health and hopes are restored. But, once again, a string of disasters, ending in a flood in which Vavron per­ ishes, puts an end to all hope, and Marysia eventually returns to New York, where, unable to return home or to find work, she reverts to penu­ ry and dies. The cunning emigration agent, terrible ocean crossing, language dif­ ficulties, and horrible living conditions in New York were all themes that first appeared in Sienkiewicz’s Letters and correspond to his impressions of the lives of the poor Slavic immigrants. However, the disasters on the frontier do not; for, in his Letters, Sienkiewicz makes it clear that if a Polish farmer can find the money to get to the far West, he will eventually do well. The Polish writer’s portraits of the existing Polish communities of Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee, again, are anything but depressing. Thus, it is clear that the didactic purpose behind \"Za chlebem\" was to discourage the Polish country folk from venturing on the great journey to the New World. Sienkiewicz produced other works based on his expe­ riences in America: Przez stepy (Across the plains, 1878) dealt with the love between a sweet American girl and the Polish captain of an immi­ grant party, and Latarnik (The lighthouse keeper of Aspinwall) is the tragic story of a Polish political refugee who is unable to find peace in the New World – but none of them had as their central theme the Great Migration of the eastern European peasantry. This theme did clearly emerge, however, in the works of other Slavonic writers. One of the most important of these writers was the Slovak novelist Martin Kukučin (1860–1928). Born Matej Bencur to parents who were small farmers of the Lutheran faith and of petty gentry origin, Kukučin grew to become one of the best and most cosmopolitan Slovak writers of the turn of the century. At first, he wrote short stories that dealt realisti­ cally and sympathetically with Slovak village life. But he later composed a number of novels that stand among the greatest monuments of mod­ ern Slovak literature. One of these, Dom v stráni (The house on the hill­ side), was set in Dalmatia and dealt with the social gulf and conflicting responsibilities of the large landowner and the impoverished peasant farmer; another, the five-volume Mat’ volá (The motherland is calling), was destined to become one of the most important works of Slavonic lit­ erature dealing with the emigration theme. Like Sienkiewicz, Kukučin\n\n28 Emigration Studies\n\nalso wrote a travelogue detailing his experiences in South America. But this three-volume Prechádzka po Patagonii (Travel sketches of a trip through Patagonia) was published in full only after his death in 1928 and never became well known outside the world of Slovak literature.10 The emigration theme appears quite early in Kukučin’s work, for mi­ gration was an important aspect of life among the Slovak villagers of the High Carpathians. Indeed, at the turn of the century, Slovaks had the highest per capita emigration rate among all groups from the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1899, they represented 25 per cent of all immigrants to the United States from the monarchy and 45 per cent of those from Hungary. One in every four people among the almost two million members of this group had already been to America before World War I.11 Thus, Kukučin’s short story \"Z teplého hniezda\" (From a warm nest) (1885), which was his first attempt to deal with the emigration theme, hit on an important aspect of life in the Slovak village. This autobiographical tale dealt with the departure from the Slovakian mountains of a young son, Matej, for work, not in America but in a far-enough-away Hungarian city. Emigration themes, personal separation, broken family life, and the economic stag­ nation of the village all appear in this story. Its main theme, however, is the attractive ceremonialism of the villagers in their ritual of saying goodbye to Matej, and, in this way, Kukučin emphasizes the wholeness of the community and its public morality. The tale is widely regarded as one of the best early stories of Slovak village life. A second early Kukučin story, \"Dies irae\" (The day of wrath), deals with the social power of mon­ ey and plainly anticipates his long masterpiece on the emigration theme, Mat’ volá.12 Kukučin’s five-volume Mat’ volá is a novel about the life of Croatian immigrants in South America and details aspects of a Slavonic immi­ grant group that Kukučin, who served for many years as a medical doctor both in Dalmatia and then in Punta Arenas, Chile, knew very well.13 Although Kukučin was able to describe precisely the daily life and eco­ nomic struggles of these southern Slavic migrants, with their attendant desire to return to their native “motherland,” he also wove into his story a great moral lesson about the use of money. Kukučin evaluated each of his characters according to their use of money. The shopkeeper Simon Katovič, a man who considers that his shop belongs not to the person whose name appears on the sign but, rather, to all the customers trading in the shop, became the central figure of the novel. Two characters espe­ cially exemplify the search for happiness in the New World: the demoral­ ized Andrija, whom greed makes a usurer and who is, in the end, rejected\n\nThe Great Migration 29\n\nby the entire community; and Kreśimír, who, on the contrary, succeeds in retaining his integrity and returns ultimately to his native land, which he was never able to forget. What is especially remarkable about Kukučin is not his innovative realism but, rather, his ability to tackle difficult class, economic, social, and psychological questions without either diminish­ ing their intensity or reducing them to the mechanical formula of class struggle. Even when describing the most extreme conditions of immi­ grant life, Kukučin never lost his humane and gentle touch.14 The Slovak Martin Kukučin, who had spent many years in Latin America, produced the most important novel on the emigration theme in the Slavonic literatures, but it was the Polish writer Maria Konopnicka (1842–1910), who had never once visited the New World or even sailed on an ocean-going ship, who penned the greatest contribution in the poetic field. Konopnicka is well known in contemporary Poland as a poet, a writer of short stories and children’s tales, and as a political and social activist who made many contributions to the women’s movement. She was born into an intelligentsia family, educated at a Catholic school for girls in Warsaw, married, had six children, divorced, and was com­ pelled to make her living by writing. For a time, she edited a Polish wom­ en’s magazine, Świt (The dawn), but her radical program soon alienated many – both potential contributors and others – and difficulties with the censor compelled her to resign. She spent a great deal of time travelling in western Europe and, in 1891, during a visit to Zurich, met by chance a group of ragged Polish peasants who were making their way home across Europe. They were emigrants who had been enticed to Brazil but had been completely disillusioned by their stay in the New World. The wanderings of these disoriented Polish country folk, who travelled from Brazil to Marseilles, then to Geneva, Zurich, and eventually Cracow, in­ spired Konopnicka to write an epic work on the emigration theme. Her long poem Pan Balcer w Brazylii (Mr Balcer in Brazil) was the result.15 It was Konopnicka’s long-standing dream to write an epic poem deal­ ing with the life and fortune of the Polish peasantry. Polish literature al­ ready possessed an epic poem focused on the lives of the gentry (Adam Mickiewicz’s Pan Tadeusz), and Konopnicka wished to complete the na­ tional literature and to make it truly national (“prawdziwie narodową”) by writing an epic on the peasantry. The sudden mass migration of the Polish peasantry to Brazil at the turn of the century, the “Brazilian fever,” as it was called at the time, provided her with the unifying theme she needed. Immediately after her encounter with the Polish peasants in Zurich, she began gathering material for Pan Balcer w Brazylii. The first\n\n30 Emigration Studies\n\npart of the poem, “On the Sea,” was published in the spring of 1892. Other parts appeared during the following years, and the entire epic was completed and published by 1909. Thus, it took her all of seventeen years to complete her great project.16 It was not scarcity of material that delayed the completion of Pan Balcer w Brazylii. The Brazilian fever was an important phenomenon of the day, and the Polish intelligentsia, both in Galicia and in the Congress Kingdom, which, by the turn of the century, were the major focal points of the emigration movement, avidly discussed the matter in books, pam­ phlets, and the daily press. Factors such as rural overpopulation, parcel­ ization of the land, unscrupulous emigration agents, and advertising by labour-hungry Brazilian state governments who had just experienced the abolition of slavery were all openly broached. The mass migration of perhaps some 275,000 people to Brazil was often seen to be a popular – that is, democratic – phenomenon that widened the perspective of the villagers, but, at the same time, it was also acknowledged that the emi­ grants endured unspeakable sufferings and that the mass migration, in the short term at least, caused economic as well as demographic losses to the homeland. The conservative gentry usually opposed emigration be­ cause it increased the price of labour, while the radical intelligentsia gen­ erally criticized it because seemingly it dulled the edge of the class struggle. Konopnicka, like Sienkiewicz before her, was in accord with this negative majority view.17 Pan Balcer w Brazylii is the story of a group of Polish peasants who set off for Brazil at the height of the Brazilian fever. They are immediately beset by difficulties: the terrible ocean voyage in the tight, prison-like quarters of a ship that was not meant to carry people and the filth and oppressive heat that cause the first deaths. In Brazil, they are not given the land they were promised but, rather, are immediately divided into groups, some to work on a coffee plantation, others to work in the depths of the jungle. Amidst the steaming heat of the tropics, Pan Balcer, who is an artisan, not an ordinary peasant, arises as a leader and advises the suf­ fering country folk to return home. Balcer leads them through jungles and over mountains, where many succumb to heat and thirst, but they eventually make it to the port. The dock workers, however, are on strike, and Balcer again is the first of the country folk to join the strikers. Eventually, the suffering peasants succeed in sailing for their native land. The final part of the poem is a hymn of praise to Mother Poland.18 Like her Slovak contemporary Martin Kukučin, Maria Konopnicka is a master of description, and her depiction of the various peasant types is\n\nThe Great Migration 31\n\ndetailed and accurate. Her use of Pan Balcer as a narrator provides an opportunity to describe nature and the villagers with the simplicity and authenticity of folk language. Her major theme is a patriotic one, steeped in the religious language of the devout country folk. The difficulties of the journey and the return home transform the protagonists from peas­ ants (sing.: chłop) to the people (collective: lud) and from people into a real part of the nation (naród), and, in so doing, complete the social profile of the Polish nation of which only the gentry had hitherto been depicted on such a scale.19 The appearance of Pan Balcer w Brazylii was greeted enthusiastically by Konopnicka’s early critics. Sienkiewicz immediately saw the vividness and accuracy of Konopnicka’s descriptions of the ocean voyage and the New World, while Aleksander Brückner and Wilhelm Feldman both con­ ceded that “Konopnicka has enriched the national Pantheon with the people.”20 More recent observers are far more severe, with the slow pace, lengthy descriptions, and dated material (emigration to Brazil ceased to be a current event after the Russian revolution of 1905) becoming criti­ cal themes. “The ideology of Pan Balcer,” wrote Julian Krzyżanowski in 1979, “is the mechanical clustering of various uncoordinated parts and has little to do with the epic parts of the poem which are its [true] val­ ue.”21 However, as a testament to the emigration fever that struck the Slavonic lands at the turn of the twentieth century, Konopnicka’s work remains unsurpassed. Pan Balcer w Brazylii has been translated into both Russian and Ukrainian, and, because of her treatments of patriotism, class consciousness, and alliance between peasant and worker, Soviet critics, in particular, to the demise of the USSR, continued to rate her work highly.22 Even during her lifetime, Maria Konopnicka’s work was not unknown among the eastern Slavs. She was particularly familiar to the Ukrainians with whom the Poles shared the Austrian province of Galicia, and she attracted the special attention of the western Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko (1856–1916), who reckoned her “among the most talented wom­ en not only in Polish but also in all the Slavonic literatures.” Franko liked Konopnicka’s dedication to the peasantry, her lyrical talents, and her lack of national exclusiveness – what were probably ethnically Ukrainian Eastern Rite Catholics (“Uniates,” as they were then called) play an im­ portant role in Pan Balcer – but at the same time, like so many later crit­ ics, he thought that Pan Balcer w Brazylii fell far short of an epic poem on the level of Pan Tadeusz.23 Franko’s opinion was of considerable signifi­ cance because the Ukrainian peasantry of eastern Galicia was also very\n\n32 Emigration Studies\n\nseverely struck by the Brazilian fever, and, like Konopnicka, Franko him­ self composed a memorable poem on this theme. Franko was certainly the man to do this job. Not only was he the most outstanding literary talent among the Galician Ukrainian intelligentsia of the turn of the century – shortly before his death in 1916, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature – but he was also a gifted journalist and social critic who had written frequently on the emigration theme and had even been personally involved in the effort of some members of the Galician Ukrainian intelligentsia to redirect the emigra­ tion movement from Brazil to North America, most especially to western Canada. Like Sienkiewicz before him, Franko was a severe critic, though not an absolute opponent of mass economic migration. He seemed to believe that the emigration to the New World could be beneficial to both the emigrants and to the nation as a whole so long as it was well orga­ nized and wisely carried out.24 By the end of the nineteenth century, however, the mass migration of Galician Ukrainian country folk had reached truly astounding propor­ tions. Overpopulation, famine, and educational, national, and other le­ gal disabilities caused thousands to sell whatever they had and leave. According to Soviet reckoning, 212,000 Ukrainians deserted Galicia between 1890 and 1910. In the first decade of the twentieth century, another 35,000 left the neighbouring province of Bukovina, while emi­ gration from Trans-Carpathia was correspondingly large.25 Among the very poorest, fantastic rumours sprang up; for example, in 1891, quasi-­ messianic hopes were aroused by the mysterious death of the emperor’s son, Crown Prince Rudolph, at Meyerling. In 1895, the emigration agent Gargoletti took advantage of this credulity. Disguising himself as a peasantfarmer, he pretended to be the beloved Archduke Rudolph and bought up the villagers’ land in exchange for promises of cheap passage to plac­ es such as Brazil. A sudden and irresistible surge in emigration of poor folk was the result.26 The vain hopes and tragic situation caused by the unscrupulous Gargoletti was the spark that fired Franko’s imagination. In the following couple of years, he composed a cycle of poetry on the Brazilian theme and published it in his own periodical and in the prestigious Galician Ukrainian journal Literaturno-naukovyi vistnyk (Literary-scientific herald).27 Franko’s cycle Do Brazilii (To Brazil) may be divided into three parts. The first part takes the form of a letter from a group of Galician Ukrainian villagers to the Archduchess Stephanie, the wife of the late Crown Prince, in which they assure her that Rudolph was not dead but alive, was\n\nThe Great Migration 33\n\nsending her greetings, and wished the country folk to follow him to Brazil. This faraway land, they informed the archduchess, was truly a peasant paradise without landlords or money lenders, a land where the faithful Ukrainian villager (virnyi Rusyn) simply captured a few monkeys to do whatever work had to be done. The second part of the cycle tells of the hardships of departure, the struggle across the Austrian Empire to a port city – Fiume, Genoa, or Hamburg – and across the high seas to the famous Brazilian state of Parana. The third part of the cycle again takes the form of a letter, this time from one of the emigrants who has suc­ ceeded in making it to the New World. This letter again tells us of the perils of travel and of the many who had died on the way. It ends with equally bad news about life in Brazil, where tropical weather, poisonous snakes, and other difficulties had taken their toll. The poor Ukrainian emigrants were even forbidden to use their own language; Brazil, they were now told, was a “Polish” country.28 Other Galician Ukrainian writers also devoted a great deal of attention to emigration motifs. In 1899, Vasyl Stefanyk published a collection of stories on the departure theme entitled Kaminnyi Khrest (The stone cross); in 1896, Andrei Chaikovsky printed one with the ironic title Braziliiskyi harazd (Brazilian prosperity); in 1901, Osyp Makovei wrote Tuha (Grief) and, in 1903, Hist z Kanady (The guest from Canada); and Tymofii Borduliak contributed three more titles to the genre. But, with the possi­ ble exception of Stefanyk’s tales, none of these works ever enjoyed the prestige and popularity of Franko’s Do Brazilii. Under the Soviets, where the cult of the “revolutionary democrat” Ivan Franko was very well devel­ oped and the social utility of literature was considered to be its most valu­ able quality, the renowned Ukrainian writer’s criticism of the Brazilian fever was taken to highlight his intense social consciousness and his loy­ alty to the underprivileged masses of the Ukrainian villagers.29 The simple humanity of his tale is its lasting quality. Ivan Franko spoke for the impoverished villagers of western Ukraine under the Habsburg Monarchy, but, farther east, in the Ukrainian lands under the Romanovs, other authors took up the cause of the simple Ukrainian country folk and directed attention towards the Great Migra­ tion to the New World. Of these, by far the most important was the fa­ mous Russian writer, journalist, memoirist, and radical populist Vladimir Korolenko (1853–1921). Although he was of mixed Ukrainian–Polish ancestry and always retained a special interest in his native land, Korolenko was brought up in an atmosphere that caused him to choose Russian literature as his calling and, like many writers of Ukrainian\n\n34 Emigration Studies\n\nbackground, he made an important contribution to Russian culture. Korolenko was educated in Saint Petersburg, joined the “movement to the people” in the 1870s, was exiled to eastern Siberia in the 1880s, edited the widely circulated populist journal Russkoe bogatstvo (Russian wealth) after his return, and eventually settled in the town of Poltava in eastern Ukraine, where he spent the remainder of his days. He was espe­ cially well known for his “progressive” and humane approach to social questions and was a defender of disadvantaged minority groups such a­ s the Votiaks, Jews, and Eastern Rite Catholics (Uniates). He opposed the death penalty, both under the tsars and under the Bolsheviks, and, dur­ ing the last years of his life, addressed a series of letters to A. V. Lunacharsky, the Bolshevik commissar of education, condemning the Bolsheviks as enemies of civilization. Korolenko also wrote a novelette entitled Bez iazyka (Without the language) on the question of peasant emigration to the United States.30 The idea of writing a piece on the subject of the Great Migration origi­ nated in Korolenko’s own experiences in the United States during his visit to the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893. He had long been interested in seeing America, a land of both economic progress and civil liberties, and, in places like London and New York, he knew that he could find exiled Russian revolutionaries who would be of interest to him. Travelling as a correspondent of the newspaper Russkie vedomosti (Russian news), Korolenko and a friend sailed to Scandinavia and to England, and then on to America. The whole journey took three and a half months and, during this time, the Russian writer managed to visit London, New York, Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and Chicago. While in London and New York, Korolenko did, in fact, meet some Russian exiles, and his steps were closely followed by the Russian secret police. In New York, moreover, the press sensationalized the arrival of this “victim of the Tsar” and ex­ pounded on his desire to take asylum in the United States. Shaken by this news and frightened by the possible reaction of the Russian authori­ ties, Korolenko, who knew no English and who had no intention of re­ maining in America, hurried on to Chicago. Once again, minorities such as the African Americans and the native Indians aroused his special sympathies. On his return home, he learned of the death of his young daughter, and guilt over his absence during this critical time forever darkened his memories of the voyage to the New World.31 During his visit to America, Korolenko could not help but notice the large numbers of Slavic and eastern European immigrants who were be­ ginning to fill the cities of New England and the Midwest. Indeed, by the\n\nThe Great Migration 35\n\nend of the 1800s, the emigration fever had definitely touched the west­ ern borderlands of the Russian Empire and, between 1899 and 1916, some 2,651,000 Russian citizens, primarily Poles and Jews, but an everincreasing number of Belarusans, Ukrainians, and Russians as well, were to arrive in the United States as immigrants.32 Thus, Korolenko was able to gather a great deal of material for literary work. Some of this he used in his short story \"Fabrika smerti\" (Factory of death), which mirrored what he saw in a giant Chicago meat-packing plant; other materials he worked into travel notes, and still others entered into his principal cre­ ation on the emigration theme, Bez iazyka. The main character in Bez iazyka is Matvei Lozinsky, a strong but gentle young farmer from Volhynia in Ukraine. Volhynia was then one of the most westerly provinces of the Russian Empire"
