As an antiquarian Barsicyj was outstanding for his time. His detailed descriptions and painstakingly accurate drawings of churches in many instances are either our earliest, or sometimes our only, records of the original appearance of buildings, some of which are no longer extant. The record is invaluable especially for Greece, Cyprus, and Athos. When he visited monastic libraries he not only compiled checklists of rare and unusual documents, but also transcribed the colophons, copied out the imperial chrysobuUs and gave conservation reports on the state of the manuscripts. Such details are found in abundance in his accounts of the libraries of Sinai and Athos. As an epigrapher he was exacting when transcribing the languages that he knew, which included Greek, Latin, Slavic languages, Arabic, and Turkish. Of those languages with which he was not familiar, such as ancient Egyptian, he faithfully copied the hieroglyphs, making some of the earliest accurate transcriptions ever attempted. He was also an acute observer of church liturgy, not only providing us with detailed descriptions of who stood where during the liturgy and an account of the liturgical texts employed, but also providing sketched ground plans of the churches and the exact position of each participant. A catalogue of BarsTcyj ' s interests would be encyclopedic, including such subjects as town planning, monastic economies, foreign currencies and exchange rates, folk customs, traditional dress, folk rituals and folk arts, organization of educational institutions, church politics, ecclesiastical dress, and the mechanics of early eighteenth-century pilgrimage.2 Rather than attempting to note what could be called highlights from BarsTcyj ' s twenty-four years of pilgrimage between 1723 and 1747, this paper concentrates on BarsTcyj's first year of pilgrimage in Italy. This material is virtually unknown,3 because even those scholars familiar with Barsicyj's manuscript were quick to realize that his observations in 1724 were not a unique archeological record of previously unrecorded churches and monasteries, that in fact he belonged at the tail end of a very extensive pilgrimage literature for Italy.4 Also, apart from anything else, his lack of knowledge of the Italian language, his status as a mendicant pilgrim who spent more time begging for alms than examining the sacred sites, and his general lack of sympathy for anything that was Roman Catholic, made it into a seriously flawed and at times wildly inaccurate account.5 It is not my purpose to take issue with such an assessment, but rather to present a reading of Barsicyj's account of Italy and to interrogate it insofar as it tells us about Barslcyj, his values, and the values of the early eighteenth-century Kievan society from which he emerged. I shall also attempt to take a glance into what\n\n8\n\nALEXANDER GRISHIN\n\ncould be called the mind of the pilgrim traveler. Frequently it is as significant to note what BarsTcyj omits to mention in his narrative, as it is to catalogue what is included. For example, for Barslcyj the pilgrim, the sole point of interest in the church of San Piętro in Vincoli lay with the relics, the chains with which it was thought that Saint Peter had been bound, while Michelangelo's Moses and the tomb of Pope Julius II do not rate a mention. From this, one need not draw the overhasty conclusion that BarsTcyj lacked an interest in the visual arts. His account of San Marco in Venice, for example, includes a discussion of both the mosaics and the bronze horses. In this instance, apparently, the criterion for the inclusion or exclusion of church art was theological. He viewed the Michelangelo sculpture as a Roman Catholic work and omitted it, while he saw the mosaics with their Greek inscriptions as living proof that the church was originally Greek Orthodox before being taken over by the Catholics, and included them in that context.6 Likewise, it is important to note and to understand BarsTiyj's misinterpretations, as frequently they cast more light on his convictions and those of his society, than do the things that he repeats accurately from common sources. Barslcyj7 was born into a wealthy merchant's family in Kiev, probably in 1701. His younger brother, Ivan, was to become a distinguished architect of the Ukrainian late baroque. When he was in his teens he entered the Kiev Academy, apparently against his father's wishes, but supported by his mother. He stayed there for half a dozen years, mastering Latin, until some sort of ulcer on his leg forced him to abandon his studies.8 Using the twin opportunities of the absence of his father from the city on a business trip, and the journey by one of his costudents Iustyn Lenneckij, Barslcyj beseeched his mother to give him some money so that he could go to L'viv on the pretext of seeking a cure for his leg, but also wishing desperately to continue his studies at the renowned L'viv Jesuit Academy. On 20 July 1723, he and his friend Iustyn left Kiev. For BarsTcyj this was the commencement of a pilgrimage which was to last twenty-four years. When he finally returned to Kiev in 1747, his health was broken and he died barely a month later, unable to revise, edit, or publish his manuscript. In L'viv he did find an instant cure for his leg and did gain admission to the prestigious Jesuit Academy, but it was only through feigning to be a Roman Catholic.9 Through various circumstances the true nature of his faith was suspected and he was expelled. Although later he was re-admitted under protest, he felt vulnerable. He said to his traveling companion, \"Will not those who hate us set another trap for us, more dangerous than the first ... will they not test our faith?\"10 Less than nine months after arriving in L'viv, the two young lay students set off on their pilgrimage to Italy, as Barslcyj put it, to worship at the holy shrines and \"to see new cities, different people and different customs.\"11 Barslcyj ' s pilgrimage and travel journal need to be seen in the context of other travelers of the Petrine period. In 1717, Feofan Prokopovyc preached in favor of travel abroad as part of a sound education and argued that a sensible man \"sees also in foreign nations, as in a mirror, himself and his own people, both their good\n\nBARS'KYJ\n\n9\n\npoints and their bad...\"12 Secular travel for self-enlightenment prompted a new literature of travel notes, which co-existed with the more traditional written pilgrim accounts. BarsTcyj' s journal belongs to this latter category, and from the outset he adhered to a pilgrim's travel journal format with opening prayers and listing of holy sites and sacred relics, but wrote it in a diary-like sequence incorporating personal responses to the actual journey with a description of the hardships of travel. Parallels can be drawn with other contemporary pilgrim accounts such as those by Hieromonk Ippolit Vy senslcyj from Kiev, who made his pilgrimage in 1707-09;13 Andrej Ignafev, a Moscow priest, who made his pilgrimage in 1707 ; Hieromonk Varlaam, from the Kievan Caves Monastery, who made his pilgrimage in 1712; Hieromonk Makarij from Novgorod, who made his pilgrimage in 1704-07; and the monk Serapion from the Saint Matrona-Trinity Monastery near Cyhyryn, who made his pilgrimage between 1749 and 1751.14 For an understanding of BarsTcyj's reaction to Italy, several factors need to be kept in mind. First, we are reading the reactions of a young man, about twenty-two years old, with a fairly limited education, but with strong theistic convictions, who had emerged from a background of struggle with the Uniates and who had experienced persecution by the Roman Catholic Church. Second, BarsTcyj was a mendicant pilgrim, who had no financial resources and needed to beg for food, shelter, and money to keep himself alive. He managed to survive in this manner fairly successfully for almost a quarter of a century, but it was during this early part of the pilgrimage that he experienced the most acute poverty. Third, BarsTcyj both realized and acknowledged that he was a \"stranger,\" a traveler in what was often a hostile environment, lacking money and the local language for communication, and by necessity dressed in the garb of a Catholic pilgrim en route to Rome to obtain the patents and alms. After the separation with his traveling companion Iustyn, in Barletta, BarsTtyj traveled alone, and the internal dialogue was heightened, as were his phobias, apprehensions, and his conviction in the active intervention of Divine Providence in all his actions. With regard to the physical journey, BarsTiyj's route was somewhat unusual. On leaving L'viv, which was then part of the Polish Commonwealth, he traveled through Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, and then to the port of Portogruaro, where he begged and received free passage on a boat bound for Venice. On 27 June 1724 he arrived in Venice, and for the purposes of this paper, we can take this date for the commencement of his Italian pilgrimage. From Venice he walked to Padua, then on to Ferrara, Bologna, Ancona on the Adriatic coast, and on to the Marian shrine at Loreto. From there he took the difficult and little used coastal track to Bari, which was to be the major highlight of his Italian pilgrimage. At this stage, tensions with his traveling companion had come to a peak and they parted in Barletta, where BarsTcyj stayed for several days in a successful attempt to regain his patents, which he had lost while scaling vineyard walls at night to steal grapes. From Barletta he walked alone to Naples and on to Rome, which he reached on 29 August—roughly two months after setting out from Venice. From Rome he\n\n10\n\nALEXANDER GRISHIN\n\ntook the main road through Florence and back to Bologna, Ferrara, and on to Venice, which he reached on 6 October 1724. After failing to beg his way onto a ship going to Zadar on the Dalmatian coast, he settled in for the winter in Venice at the Orthodox hospice of San Giorgio dei Greci, where he commenced his study of Greek. Barsicyj left Venice on 28 February 1725, never to return to Italy. Thus, the period under consideration lasted for about three and a half months spent walking through northern, central, and southern Italy, and about four and a half months of residence in Venice. Initially, BarsTcyj's travel journal was written during this period as a series of diary-like entries, with frequent asides like \"there I sat until evening writing about my journey,\"15 while the last section, from Bari to Rome and back to Venice, was probably composed in Venice from travel notes, and is often punctuated with careless inconsistencies, as in the correlation of dates with days of the week. The journal was written with publication in mind, using the out-of-fashion but still popular genre of pilgrim travel literature, with recurring references to \"my dear patient reader.\" There is also evidence that Barsicyj intended to revise and edit the journal, with marginal notes addressed to himself, reminding him to check certain dates and figures. Fortunately for us, he never made these revisions, and the lacunae remain, as do the rawness and freshness of the observations. I will divide my observations into four main sections: Bari, Rome, Florence, and Venice. Unlike most pilgrims traveling to Italy, who placed Rome and the shrines of the Apostles at the top of their itinerary, BarsTcyj originally justified the whole pilgrimage by his desire to worship at the shrine of Saint Nicholas in Bari: I did not so much wish to go to Rome, as to the shrine of the Holy Bishop Saint Nicholas in the town of Bari. When I was still attempting to heal the huge ulcer on my leg ... I made a vow to God that if healed I would undertake a distant journey in gratitude for His mercy.16 Why he held Saint Nicholas in such veneration is never fully explained. Of course, the cult of Saint Nicholas was very popular in Ukraine, where the first church was dedicated to him in Kiev in 882, if the Nestor Chronicle is to be trusted.17 Perhaps more significantly, Christianity was introduced to the Slav peoples at a time when the cult of Saint Nicholas was at its peak in Byzantium, and the Slavs adopted him as part of the foundations of their faith. In the eighteenth century, the cult was an integral part of the faith, and there may be nothing remarkable in Barslcyj's vow to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Nicholas at Bari if cured of his ulcer. One could speculate that there was more of a personal commitment and point to the fact that the name Barslcyj was associated indirectly with the cult and was derived from the name of the town of Bar in western Ukraine. Formerly known as Rov, it was renamed in 1537 by Queen Bona Sforza, the wife of the Polish King Sigismund I, in memory of her Italian possessions in Bari. This, of course, would be only speculation. The shrine of Saint Nicholas at Bari is a perfect candidate for what the sociologist Dean MacCannell described as a holy site. He outlined the steps in the\n\nBARS'KYJ\n\n11\n\nprocess of creation of a holy site. First, the site is purified of extraneous associations. The second stage is its \"sacralization\"—when it is marked off, elevated, and separated from its surroundings. It is at this stage that it may be architecturally \"framed.\" Third, the site is mechanically reproduced in effigies, pictures, models, relics, souvenirs, and icons, by means of which its fame and reputation are spatially extended. Fourth, there is the stage of \"social reproduction\" of the site which, if successful, gathers a community around it and makes it a self-sufficient economic entity. The site continues as long as it can generate a literature—texts, guidebooks, testimonies, miracles, and travel accounts.18 MacCannell of course had in mind not religious shrines, but secular ones, such as the Empire State Building in New York, and the factors that made them into economically viable tourist attractions. The translation of Saint Nicholas's relics from Turkish-occupied Myra to Bari in 1087 is well attested in contemporary sources and could be viewed as a process of purification. Within a couple of years, a tomb with the saint's bones was well embedded in the crypt of a vast basilica erected in the saint's honor; thus, the territory had been architecturally \"marked off and framed.19 Saint Nicholas's fame as a miracle-worker was closely linked with his function as a myroblate—that is, a saint whose relics unceasingly emit a myrrh, manna, or sacred liquid, with miraculous medicinal qualities. While the myrrh was distributed free, it could only be collected in special phials exclusively sold by merchants associated with the church, permitting the church to maintain a monopoly over the relic and its miracles.20 Thus, very early in its life the church became a self-sufficient economic entity, attracted a vast number of pilgrims or tourists, and generated a considerable quantity of promotional literature, produced both on its own behalf and by impressed travelers. BarsTcyj arrived at the shrine of Saint Nicholas in no need of conversion. He knew that the site was holy, and that the saint' s powers were great: throughout the pilgrimage he had called on him for help. Recently he had suffered great hardships, walking along the rocky shores for days, exhausted by the summer heat and suffering from lack of food and water. When walking at night he had lost his travel documents, his patents, and also experienced great pain in his legs, so that he lamented that he could hardly walk. It is interesting to examine his response upon reaching his destination. On his arrival in Bari, Barslcyj was entitled to three nights' free accommodation at the local hospice for pilgrims, and appears to have divided his days between begging for alms around town and going to the church of San Nicola. He provides us with a brief description of the church, including such details as its basic two-story structure, the two sets of stairs leading down to the crypt with the relics, the number of columns in the crypt, and a description of the tomb of the holy bishop.21 He excludes all that is extraneous to the functioning of the cult, so that the huge sixteenth-century tomb of Bona Sforza (the queen who renamed Rov as Bar), an eyesore that dominates the entire upper church, does not get a passing mention. In Dean MacCannell's terminology, BarsTcyj is solely concerned with that which \"sacralizes\" the site, and not in its physical appearance.\n\n12\n\nALEXANDER GRISHIN\n\nInitially, in keeping with convention, Barsicyj lists some of the main features of the cult and its associated miracles. Then he breaks with the established topoi of pilgrim tales, proceeding to observe the cult from what could be termed an \"objective\" viewpoint. It is here that the traveling stranger, the outsider, is simultaneously the passionate believer within his own culture, and the impartial observer in the one within which he travels. After the account of the church and the miracles, he brings up the pivotal question of the holy myrrh, which he calls the holy manna, from the Italian Manna di San Nicola with which the priests anoint the heads of the worshippers: Near the church there were four shops which sold glass phials and different images and icons, all depicting the Holy Bishop Saint Nicholas...The production of these phials is paid for by the church and the money gathered from their sale is returned to the church administration...They distribute ample amounts of manna to anyone who asks for it, but only provided that it is placed into phials bought in the church shop with an image of Saint Nicholas on them, but never into any others. We asked...how much manna do the relics of Saint Nicholas exude....[The priest] answered us, that every morning the tomb is full and that what is distributed during the day is replaced in the night...We also heard that before his feast day, two or three days earlier, sometimes an abundance of manna appears, and at other times only a little. From this without fail they can calculate that when there is much manna, there will be a gathering of a great multitude of Christians in the church, but if only a little manna has appeared, there will be a small gathering of people. The sagacious Holy Bishop exudes only as much of the healing manna as the faithful will require.22 At this point in the text there follows a catalogue of the saint's miracles that are testified to in the church. Thus, for example, the saint, noticing that the builders of the church were one column short of completing the crypt, appeared with a couple of angels and the additional column. The church also contained the image of a ship which the saint had saved from destruction, a huge bone from a fish which the saint had helped a fisherman to land, and a tusk, apparently taken from an elephant shot by a hunter who had said a prayer to the saint. What disturbed Barslcyj more than anything else was that he had not seen and physically touched the relics of the saint, nor witnessed the miracle of the holy myrrh. His persistence with the Latin-speaking clergy paid off, however, and he and his traveling companion were invited into the church one night after vespers to be shown what could be termed the inside workings of the cultus. As far as can be established, this account is rare in the voluminous pilgrim and travelers' tales associated with the Saint Nicholas shrine:23 After that, he led us to the church, which I have mentioned before, and which lies below the vault of the upper church, and to the great altar of silver, and opened in the front of it a small door through which a person could crawl like a worm. The sacristan crawled into itfirst,up to his waist, and he lit a small lamp so that one could see inside. After him, I the sinful one crawled in next...In the upper marble slab, there was cut a small round window\n\nBARS'KYJ\n\n13\n\nwhich could be covered by a [small coin like a ] thaler. Suspended through this window was an iron chain with a candle on it hanging deep inside, almost near thefloorof the tomb. Having crawled inside, I placed one eye over this hole and could see inside a very deep marble sarcophagus, about a cubit off the ground, like a well half-filled with water or manna, which was light and transparent like the clearest water, and through it, under the surface of the water, there appeared something like bones on which moisture endlessly formed as if drops of perspiration. There was noflesh,and they say that it had all dissolved into the manna, and one could not tell which bone belonged to which part of the body, as 24 they were not lying in their usual formation. Next Barsicyj allowed his traveling companion, Iustyn, to have a look, and then returned for a second look. Finally, I asked a guard at the tomb, that if the tomb was never opened, then how did they extract the manna? He answered, that it was done through that little window, where 25 with a special instrument they suck out the manna. Having attained his aim and examined the evidence, BarsTtyj solemnly concludes : \"I did not think that they were real bones, but that they had been carefully carved out of that very same marble, and so, too, thought Iustyn.\"26 The point is not elaborated, nor does he return to it in the text or explain its significance for the cult in Bari. Immediately after witnessing the manna, he simply notes that they left Bari just before sunset. An interesting parallel can be drawn with the slightly earlier account found in the travel diary of Pëtr Tołstoj, who arrived in Bari in June 1698. He traveled in comfort with his entourage by ship, and when he arrived in Bari was greeted by the representatives of the local governor. He presents an architecturally accurate account of the church with a summary of the miracles of the saint as provided by the local guides, explains how the holy manna is obtained and distributed to the pilgrims, lists the other relics in the church, and complains that \"there are only a few shops in Bari, with few goods in them.\"27 Tołstoj, aged 53, well funded, reasonably well educated and traveling on a mission for Tsar Peter, appears as the impartial observer who repeats uncritically that which he is told and reports without particular emotion that which he observes. For В arsTcyj, by contrast, both the physical and the spiritual pilgrimage involve a process of struggle with a need to verify and to authenticate. Barsliyj's circumstances changed as he traveled to Rome. After leaving Bari, in Barletta, he finally parted company with his friend Iustyn. After several pages of moaning on how deserted and alone he feels, the \"we\" of the text changes to a solitary \"I.\" No longer does he seek confirmation of his opinions from a fellow traveler from his own society with its common cultural values.28 This slight shift in emphasis, with a growing focus on the self, is already perceptible in the subheadings that he gives in the manuscript. In place of headings such as \"Calabria\"\n\n14\n\nALEXANDER GRISHIN\n\nor \"Description of the town of Bari,\" there appear headings like \"Concerning the famous city of Rome and my arrival in it.\" The sense of alienation—the character of \"detachment\" and \"objectivity\"—is heightened as Barslcyj ' s journey progresses. Increasingly he sees himself as \"outside\" something: The world becomes an array of \"objects,\" artifacts, and exemplars whose meaning is mysterious to the outsider and must be decoded from appearances. Through being removed, one may come to see one's native culture—which once provided the lenses and meanings through which one looked out upon the world—as an object, a thing, a unified, 29 describable phenomenon. Barsiiyj's account was to some extent determined by the sheer mechanics of the pilgrimage. In Bari, with access to a single hospice, BarsTiyj could stay for three nights and produced material for six folios in the manuscript. With the much greater range of pilgrim hospices in Rome, Barslcyj stayed for twelve days and gathered material for fifteen tightly written folios of text. In Rome he felt drawn to catalogue and to explain everything that he encountered—customs, rains, Roman history, rituals, and so on. 30 In terms of the empirical data provided, BarsTcyj's account of Rome provides little that could be described as new or archeologically interesting, even though the events to which he was an eyewitness did offer him a rare perspective.31 In Rome he encountered many unfamiliar phenomena which, with an amazing single-mindedness, he translated into experiences known to him. For example, В arsTcyj ' s paradigm for Rome was the history of the city of L'viv, which was once free, Orthodox and Ukrainian, and then suffered forced conversion to Catholicism and Polish domination. According to Barslcyj, Rome too was once a Greek city ruled by Greek emperors and true to the Greek Orthodox faith, and only some time after Emperor Constantine shifted his capital to Constantinople did the Italians and the Roman Catholics appear and convert the churches to their own rite. According to Barslcyj, Rome is a very ancient city, not ancient through weakness or through being dilapidated,32 but ancient in years, as it was already founded by the Greeks long before Christ. It is an imperial city and had on its throne Greek emperors in ancient times, such as Titus, Vespasian and others. The last emperor to have his throne there was the pious Constantine, who moved it to Byzantium, which is now called Constantinople.33 Barslcyj's explanations are ingenious and lend the text a certain naive charm: There is also another church within the city which is called the Rotunda,34 meaning round, as the building is round on the inside and on the outside. It has no corners or rooms, but only a single wall which goes all around, like a column, and it is covered by a single dome. It is very ancient and was created by the Greeks35 for all their gods, that is, it was a pagan temple for their idols to whom they made sacrifices on a huge fire in the middle of the church on which they burnt bodies. For this reason there is a window, or a great hole,\n\nBARS'KYJ\n\n15\n\nin the middle of the church dome, through which the smoke could escape, and this hole still remains uncovered. When Rome became holy and Christian and all the pagan temples were cleared of their idols, then this church was called All Saints.36 Regarding the alleged purpose of his pilgrimage to Rome, the churches and their relics, BarsTcyj boasts that \"there is a common tradition among pilgrims, that on reaching Rome you visit many churches... But there are seven great and leading churches, which if anyone does not visit, he cannot be deemed a worshipper and he has come and gone in vain.\"37 Yet his account of the seven pilgrim churches is brief, confused, and at times inaccurate. He does not even mention Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, which was mandatory for all good pilgrims. His chief lament is the lack of access to the relics except every twenty-five years, in the Jubilee year, which to Barslcyj's misfortune was only the following year, 1725. In terms of materials and observations, BarsTcyj's contribution lies in his description of the mechanics of pilgrimage in Rome, from the perspective of the traveling mendicant pilgrim. We learn much about the physical geography and the administration of hospices for travelers, especially the famous Santissima Trinita de' Pellegrini,™ and their arrangements for feeding the poor and the ill, the arrangement of the refectory and the dormitories, and the processes used to screen pilgrims' credentials. There is also a discussion of which monasteries made food available to paupers on what days of the week, and the fountains that had good drinking water and those that did not. Two significant events punctuated BarsTcyj's stay in Rome, and both yielded peculiar and somewhat unexpected results. The first was an invitation to dine at the pope's table at the papal palace; the second was witnessing the confirmation of the Dominican pope, Benedict XIII. In Rome there was a practice for a papal representative each day to select twelve pilgrims and one pauper, and to invite them to dine at the papal palace, with the obvious symbolic parallel with the Apostles. Standing outside his hospice, Barslcyj was spotted by the papal representative and invited to come the following day to dine at the papal palace. His account is interesting for all the details that it omits. We learn almost nothing about the layout of the palace, the other people present, or what one could call \"local color,\" in which Barslcyj's manuscript generally excels. The whole event is portrayed in ethical terms, as yet another trial of BarsTcyj's true faith. The invitation was to come to dine on Wednesday evening, and it struck him that in Kiev the Orthodox treat this day as a meat-free day, while the Catholics do not: \"I was afraid that they would offer inappropriate food and I prayed to God to protect me from the snares of the enemy.\"39 God of course intervened, for by coincidence that Wednesday was the day preceding the feast of the Veneration of the Holy Cross, and hence was a Vigil, which by Roman practice was commemorated by a fast. Thus only lenten food was served, and our traveler's true faith was neither tested nor exposed. Beyond this, Barslcyj only gives us a few details of the trinkets offered to the pilgrims on leaving the table as evidence of their visit.\n\n16\n\nALEXANDER GRISHIN\n\nThe papal confirmation incident yielded a no less surprising account. Apart from a rather inaccurate description of the papal procession40—which BarsTcyj obviously watched from the crowd, lacking a privileged position or access to information with which he could interpret the proceedings—the focus of the account is on the distribution of papal charity to the paupers of Rome, something which he obviously experienced at first hand: The pope three days prior to his confirmation, gathered all the beggars and paupers into his courtyard and gave each an equal amount in alms. To men and to the women, to the big and to the small, he gave each ten baiocchi, which when converted into Polish money is worth four groszes and in Moscow coins it is worth eight kopecks.41 But he did not give it in silver or copper coins, as it would have taken a long time to calculate the amount for a crowd of about three or four thousand poor, and where would he have obtained such a quantity of coins? Instead he gathered all the poor into the courtyard [of the papal palace], and then let them out one by one, and as each left he gave he gave them a docket or a ticket,42 that is, a small piece of paper in which that pauper is referred to a specific baker and on presentation of this ticket is given ten biadcchi worth of bread. On this ticket it is stated in the following terms: that this pauper, the name indicated, is being sent to you baker, name indicated, in such a parish or at a specific address, and you must give him ten baiôcchi worth of bread and accept this ticket in lieu of the money. Then each pauper on having received this ticket went to the baker whose name was printed on it, and the baker gave each pauper ten loaves of bread and retained the dockets, and took them later to the papal palace where he received his money.43 While I have not encountered a similar account in other pilgrim tales, the literature for Rome for this period is immense, and it seems unlikely that BarsTcyj has unearthed any particular nuggets of information here. What is interesting is that unlike a \"good tourist\" who is impressed by the unfamiliar and parrots the formulas,44 Barslcyj adopts the perspective of the lone traveling stranger for whom the unknown provokes the need for an interpretation in terms of the known. For him, alienation underscores a confrontation and a desire to explain in terms of Kievan society and its values, religious conventions, and convictions. Barsicyj's account of his visit to early eighteenth-century Florence is unusual when placed in the context of those of other travelers of this time. While there may be nothing remarkable about his preoccupation with the fifteenth century when discussing Florence, Barslcyj' s preoccupation is with a fifteenth-century Church gathering, and not with the great cultural events associated with the so-called Italian Renaissance. The only reference to the physicality of the place is the sentence, \"In Florence the largest and the most attractive church is called Sancta Maria Liberata and next to it is a high and beautiful stone bell tower which has been created with great skill.\"45 The reference is obviously to the cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore, and Giotto's campanile, but neither is graced by a description. Barsicyj ' s discussion of the Council of Florence of 1439 is short enough to quote in full:\n\nBARS'KYJ\n\n17\n\nFlorence is the city in which took place the Eighth Council (which the Eastern Church does not recognize), which was assembled through the initiative of and funding by the pope in Rome, who wanted to create the union of the Churches. Theyfirstgathered at Ferrara, as it is close to the sea, and then shifted to Florence as is recorded in the chronicles. Present at this council was the Greek Emperor John Palaeologus, Pope Eugene IV, the Patriarch Joseph, Isidore, the Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus', Mark of Ephesus and other Greek archbishops and bishops, archimandrites and leading presbyters46 and hegumens from the Holy Mountain, Mount Athos. All signed in favour of the union, except for Mark of Ephesus alone, and it was this that prevented the Greek Church from entering the union, and until the present day it remains separate from the Romans. At the conclusion of the Council in Florence, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Joseph, who was sitting there and taking notes, because of his insolence dropped dead, as a sign from God that He opposed the union. The patriarch, together with the emperor were the first to sign the union, and the others followed. This happened on 9 June, according to the Roman calendar, or 29 May, according to the Greek calendar, and he was buried with great honors in the church of Sancta Maria Novella, which is a monastery of the Dominican Order in which the pope resided. The Councilfinishedin the year of the Incarnation of Our Lord, 1439, on 6 June, according to the Roman calendar, or 26 May, according to the Greek.47 It is not difficult to note some confusion in BarsTcyj ' s account. The translation of dates into the Julian calendar as then used in Kiev as if they were eighteenthcentury and not fifteenth-century dates, by subtracting rather than adding the eleven days, is simply a case of a naive slip.48 The fact that the Council finished on 6 July 1439, and not on 6 June, is a slightly more serious matter, in that the unfortunate Joseph II, the Patriarch of Constantinople, could hardly have been a signatory if he had died a month earlier. In fact he did die, and was not a signatory, but his actual date of death is a matter of more than passing interest. Barsłcyj appears to have misunderstood the reasons why the patriarch had been damned by the Orthodox polemicists. It was not because he allegedly had signed the decree of union, or that together with his emperor, in some aspects, he had argued in favor of the union. Rather, it was because he allegedly had left a document usually referred to as the Last Profession, allegedly signed on his deathbed, in which he basically agreed with the Latins' interpretation of the Filioque. Church historians of the past hundred years have argued at length over the authenticity of the Last Profession text, generally with the Roman Catholics, such as the eminent Jesuit Father Joseph Gill,49 arguing for its authenticity, and Orthodox scholars, including Ivan Ostroumoff,50 arguing against it. The issue is complicated, but in the final analysis the most telling contradiction is that the Latin Act reproduces the socalled Last Profession with a date of 9 June 1439, stating that he wrote it and died that evening, and then proceeds to give the date of death as 10 June. The contradiction is difficult to resolve; Father Gill's ingenious explanation is to say, \"It is just as possible that the Patriarch himself was in error about the date. That does happen even to the best of us.\" 51 For Orthodox theologians it is a clear-cut case: it is simply \"an unsuccessful forgery made by some Greek or Latin to allure the Orthodox.\"52 Here Barslcyj ' s testimony that the patriarch died on 9 June would\n\n18\n\nALEXANDER GRISHIN\n\nbe interesting if we could determine his source. While his general remarks on the Council and the heroic role played by Mark Eugenicus, the Metropolitan of Ephesus, simply repeat common Orthodox rhetoric, the source for the date of the patriarch's death is different. This source can be established. Patriarch Joseph, as Barsicyj correctly noted, was buried in the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, in which the pope lived during the Council, so that BarsTcyj's source, as it is so often the case in this early part of the manuscript, was epigraphic: the subsequently lost inscription on the tomb of the patriarch. This would suggest that the inscription visible on the patriarch's tomb in the early eighteenth century testified to the fact that he in fact died on 9 June, and not on the following day, as stated in the Latin Acts. This perhaps does not resolve the controversy, but does add a new piece to the jigsaw. It is interesting that by the time that Barslcyj had arrived in Florence, it was not a physical reality that preoccupied him, but a metaphysical one. His concern was with the straggle of his home Church and its values, which he saw reflected in the one that he encountered every day on his pilgrimage, as a stranger looking in. When BarsTtyj was returning to Venice, in many ways it was a journey out of a strange, threatening, and alien environment into a familiar one, which he had experienced several months earlier, and where he was no longer the lonely stranger waiting outside the city gates: [I] straight away went to the Greek church and attended vespers and saw the priests. I bowed,rightdown to the ground, before the archpriest who recognized me, and I asked him not to bar me from going to their hospice [despite it being] at such a late hour. He not only granted me my request, but went with me to the hospice (which is not far from the church) and instructed those living there, not to prevent me from staying there as long as I wished to remain in Venice.53 BarsTsyj's sojourn at the San Giorgio dei Greci hospice lasted over four and a half months, during which time he was provided with a bed, had access to the Greek school, and was given a small weekly stipend paid every Sunday to him and to Greek refugees from Turkish-occupied lands who had managed to escape to Venice. It was here that he also received moral support and religious companionship. As one could anticipate, there was a certain shift in Barslcyj's mode of expressing observations, in contrast with the passages that immediately preceded it. Once removed from a position of absolute alienation, Barslcyj writes from a position of greater security, where he has time to reflect on the whole philosophy of pilgrimage and is able to contemplate the secular past of the surrounding environment. His observations of Venice are crowded with genre details as he describes the festivals, carnivals, and the various curiosities that he encountered in the Piazza di San Marco. He notes the glass factories in Murano; the church of San Marco, which he takes to be an old Orthodox church taken over by the Roman rite; the Ponte di Rialto, which he complains is crowded with over-expensive shops; he catalogues tricks performed by cardplayers, jugglers, and strongmen, all\n\nBARSTCYJ\n\n19\n\nfor the entertainment of people in the Piazza. Parallels may be drawn with other contemporary accounts of Venice, by travelers taking in the sights as part of the Grand Tour. 54 In three passages, however, BarsTcyj breaks with the conventions of describing Venice as part of the Grand Tour. The first passage is a strange and lengthy defense of pilgrimage; such an expression of self-justification can only be made from a position of relative security, when one is able to externalize a situation after having experienced it. From the security of a safe haven, one can justify one's actions, particularly with an anticipated audience in mind. BarsTcyj composed the last part of his account of his Italian pilgrimage in Venice from notes that he had assembled earlier. He intersperses the text with references to his \"patient reader.\" The emphasis on the pious nature of his text may in fact be seen as an attempt to convert the essentially secular nature of his Venice travel notes into a text with a religious significance. It needs to be read with the knowledge that at the time of writing it, BarsTcyj thought that the pilgrimage was close to an end, and that with spring he would retrace his steps home: Many people think, and say, that a pilgrim traveling through the world and passing through many lands, simply does it to collect money. I can speak with a clear conscience and say that only God knows all of the trials and torments of the traveler. Only God knows, how in the summer, under the burning sun, the body is so bent over that it hurts the heart and the head, and how, when you are pouring with sweat, your bones become so weakened that you cannot make the effort to eat, or to drink, or indeed, even to speak. Only God knows how in the autumn time, when you are caught in the rain, in a field or a forest, and you are far away from a town or a village, how it is then to endure the rain and the wind, while shivering, and groaning in your heart, and how sometimes weeping you call upon the Lord, because you do not have a single dry thread on all of your freezing body, and how you are chilled to the bone, wet from the rain, sodden and heavy. Likewise I could relate, how in the winter time, in the cold, in the frost and in the snow, with your inner and outer organs frozen, how you usually manage to endure this, but sometimes you cannot and your life ends prematurely. But if you do continue, it is without a single warm limb, but only with a warm spirit, and it is this that gives you life. Do not think, my dear reader, that if through one thing or another, the traveler meets his death, he will be denied the Kingdom of Heaven. Each traveler, if he is a true traveler, who travels for the sake of Christ, and does not simply travel to gather wealth, traveling the world to see the beauties of this world with the different lands, peoples and customs, but the traveler who goes in fulfillment of a vow, or through a wish or a desire to save himself, and goes to visit the holy sites sanctified by the footsteps of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, or to worship the relics of the holy saints of God, then he and all like him, will live with the angels.55\n\nAlthough on a rather elementary level Barsicyj can be interpreted as stating his credentials as a bone fide pilgrim, it is also an act of differentiation from a Roman Catholic pilgrim, where BarsTcyj presents a fairly obvious subtext as to whom he considers to be a true pilgrim. The stress on the need for poverty and for traveling on foot can be fairly read in self-referential terms ; what is more interesting is when\n\n20\n\nALEXANDER GRISHIN\n\nhe goes on to denounce Catholic pilgrims, whom he observes at each holy site making their confessions and receiving communion. He exclaims, \"Who can honestly say his confession so frequently?\" Then he answers his own question in 56 the negative and says that those travelers will \"meet with an evil death.\" Barslcyj was certainly aware of the differing traditions of receiving communion in the East and the West: in his own tradition it was usual to say confession twice annually, once before Easter and once before Christmas, by contrast with the Latin tradition of almost weekly communion. In his definitions of what constitutes a true pilgrim traveling towards his heavenly goal, he arrives at the answer that in the final analysis, he needs to be an Orthodox Christian; otherwise, his reward will be eternal damnation. The second passage consists of a description of a carnival held in Venice at Shrovetide. Again, I severely abridge BarsTcyj's rich, flowing rhetoric. First he describes the various dances, games, and fireworks in the Piazza di San Marco, then the portable theater erected in the square and the public slaughter of four oxen for the feast: ...two or three days later, within the doge's palace, they arranged stalls to seat people and a multitude of people gathered. They led out an ox, with a rope around its horns, and took it away a certain distance, where it was set upon by dogs, specially trained for the purpose, which gnawed off its ears while the animal was still alive. And so they tortured to death a second, a third and a fourth one, doing the same to each up to the tenth ox. The tenth they released without a rope; the eleventh they strung up by a rope in the middle of the doge's courtyard, and with the twelfth they simply chopped its head off. When I saw this and saw how much the people were entertained by this, I was almost in tears. How can any charitable person witness the torture of a kind animal, which was forced to endure such great torment, and to have heard its terrified cries and its roars of agony, without having his heart pierced? I remember, how I, the sinful one, said to myself at the time, Surely this animal is worthy of great honor, for was it not an ox that was chosen to wait on the newly born Lord, Jesus Christ, in His manger? It was only the ox and the domestic ass.... Rather than thanking the Lord, we torture it and prefer a nasty cunning dog to the worthy kind ox. What I say is that we need to love, rather than torture those who love us. Yet they have closed minds, and they kiss, sit, eat and drink together, but hate the sight of the beggar and cast him away from their eyes. О madness of mankind! О madness of men who do such silly and evil things.57 If in the first passage BarsTcyj was drawing a line of demarcation between a true pilgrim and a Catholic one, here the target is the host society within which he finds himself. There is a conscious identification of the tortured oxen with the Orthodox traveler. The madness that BarsTcyj describes is one which the outside observer sees in the foreign society through which he moves.58 By contrast, when Pëtr Tołstoj was resident in Venice in his \"large house, with many rooms built of fine stone,\" he attended the carnival and noted how many Venetians were amused by seeing \"great bulls baited with mastiffs.\" Later, he continues,\n\nBARS'KYJ\n\n21\n\nin front of the Venetian prince they held three enormous bulls which they decapitated with swords. They severed the head of one bull with a single stroke of the sword, so cleanly and swiftly, that its point sank into the ground, and this two men did very quickly to the heads of two of the bulls. While the third man could not sever the head of the third bull with a single stroke.59 Tołstoj makes no moral judgement, nor does he attribute a religious significance. As a tourist and observer, he records what he sees and passes on to describe the other entertainments. The third passage is the longest of the three, and for the material which it contains is one of the most important in the first section of the manuscript. Barslcyj gave it the title \"A description of the church of Saint George which is in Venice.\" Despite this, there is little in it that would interest the architectural historian or the archeologist. The physical description of the church runs for exactly two lines, but what follows is a most detailed analysis of the liturgical life of the Greek community in Venice. BarsTcyj prefaces the section with the words, \"In liturgical celebrations, everything corresponds to our service, except for the following details.\"60 What he then presents is several pages of the most detailed observations on how the celebration of the Divine Liturgy differs from that celebrated in Kiev. The detail includes every aspect of the liturgy, such as what words are said by whom and from what exact physical position in the church.61 For example, Barslcyj observes that \"the prokeimenon is not sung before the reading of the Epistle, but nevertheless the Epistle is read. After the reading of the Epistle, the two choirs do not sing the Alleluia, but only one from one side of the church.\"62 And so the details continue for all aspects of the liturgical celebrations that BarsTcyj witnessed in the Greek church during the winter that he spent in Venice, now armed with the knowledge of the Greek language. Not only does it appear to be the most detailed account of the peculiarities of eighteenth-century Greek Orthodox practice in Venice, but it is also an invaluable source for the reconstruction of early eighteenth-century Ukrainian liturgical practices in Kiev. BarsTcyj worked from the premise that the most correct liturgical practices were those of his own Church, and his purpose was to note deviations from them. By carefully examining these deviations, the Ukrainian peculiarities are also revealed. For example, one passage refers to the forty days of Lent: During the forty-day Lent, at the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts the readings from the Holy Scriptures are not done from the center of the church, but from the bema, and the \"Glory to Thee\" is sung by an assistant priest63 at the altar. This is unlike the way it is in our church, where the reading is done from the center of the church and it is here that the \"Glory to Thee\" is also sung... On Fridays during Lent they do not read the Pasija, but only a little from the Gospels, and instead of the Pasija, they read parts from the Akathistos to the Most Holy Mother of God, divided into sections of three stanzas each, one for each Friday.64\n\n22\n\nALEXANDER GRISHIN\n\nOf course the Pasija, which for Barsicyj was the norm, was aUkrainian peculiarity unknown not only to the Greeks, but also to the other Orthodox peoples. This liturgical celebration was established in the first half of the seventeenth century under the Kievan metropolitan Peter Mohyla, for the first four Fridays of Great Lent, when in the evenings, selections were read from the account of the Passion in the four Gospels, accompanied by certain hymns. It was described in the Cvetnaja Trioa\"65 published in 1702. Barslcyj's account of 1724 fills in some of the missing details. In this section Barsicyj establishes a methodology to which he returns in the final section of the manuscript, dealing with the monasteries of Mount Athos, where he presents an exceptionally detailed account of the liturgical celebrations at the Great Lavra Monastery. For all the monasteries he subsequently visited, BarsTcyj returned to this paradigm, noting how the celebrations compared with or differed from this one. By that stage, however, his goals had changed. Now he was looking to the liturgies on Athos, which he thought preserved the liturgy of primitive Christianity to the greatest extent, and through which he wished to reform the liturgical practices of his homeland.66 Venice was an important watershed in Barsliyj's Italian pilgrimage, at which he could bring together and distill the experiences of his first year on the road. This paper has been an attempt to map out BarsTiyj's progress in his physical pilgrimage as well as to note changes and developments in the traveler and his journal. When, after he had made his final preparations to return home, it appeared to BarsTcyj that God had intervened and told him to travel to the Greek islands, \"I was overjoyed and thanked my Creator for His benediction and providence, for me, his sinful slave, as I realized that I was not acting according to my will, but that He was doing with me according to His holy will.\"67 Australian National University\n\nNOTES 1.

The facsimile of Barsicyj's autograph will appear as a volume in the Harvard Library of Early Ukrainian Literature, Texts series. The first of the two volumes of translation and commentary has now been completed and will be published as part of the English Translations series. This will be the first facsimile publication of Barslcyj's text, which prior to the conservation of the manuscript was\n\nBARS'KYJ\n\n23\n\nillegible in places. Furthermore, the texts will include a lengthy and comprehensive account of BarsTcyj's life and activities, the first such study for over a century. For a summary of the earlier literature see Nikolaj Bursakov, Странствованія Василія Григоровича-Барскаго no святымъ мЪстамъ Востока съ 1723 по 1747 г., Православное Палестинское общество, 4 vols.

A parallel may be drawn with BarsTcyj's earlier Russian contemporary, Pëtr Tołstoj, who was sent by Tsar Peter in 1697 to Venice for two years to study naval science. Tołstoj was accompanied by servants and while remaining true to the Orthodox faith, left a factually accurate account of Italy and its churches. See Max J. Okenfuss, The Travel Diary of Peter Tolstoi: A Muscovite in Early Modern Europe (DeKalb, 111., 1987). 6. He writes,\"The most beautiful and foremost church of the city is dedicated to the Holy Apostle, the Evangelist Saint Mark, which has been converted into a Roman Catholic church.\" BarsTtyj, Stranstvovanija, fol. 77a. All references to the BarsTcyj text are to the autograph manuscript as reproduced in the facsimile volume. 7. The name Vasyl' Hryhorovyc Barsityj has given rise to some controversy and the various changes and alterations to the name are discussed comprehensively in the introduction to the facsimile volume. 8. The controversial question of Barsicyj ' s relationship with Feofan Prokopovyc I discuss in some detail in the introduction to the facsimile volume, and on the basis of chronology conclude that when Prokopovyc was teaching at the Academy, BarsTcyj would have been doing elementary Latin and struggling with Alvarez's lnstitutiones lingue Latinae, rather than listening to lectures in Latin on philosophy. 9. It was not unusual for Kievans to study at Jesuit colleges in the Polish lands. Feofan Prokopovyc, Stefan JavorsTcyj, and Metropolitan JasynsTcyj can all be cited as examples. It was also usual for the Kievans to take vows as Roman Catholics and become Uniates for the duration of their studies and to revert to Orthodoxy on their return to Kiev. The three churchmen cited above all did this. Barsiiyj and his companion took the more unusual step of not taking Roman Catholic vows, but pretended to be Catholics from the Polish Commonwealth. Throughout his travels, BarsTcyj refused to compromise his faith. 10. BarsTcyj, Stranstvovanija, fol. 4. 11. BarsTcyj, Stranstvovanija, fol. 4. 12.

Earlier passages are frequently presented in the form of a dialogue with his traveling companion, for example, when he debates with him the need for a pilgrimage, the authenticity of the holy manna, and which road to take next.

So wrote Eric Leed in reference to the travel notes of the German clergyman Karl Moritz, BarsTcyj's contemporary, who decided unwittingly to travel throughout England on foot and found himself locked out of inns and treated as an undesirable. This twin feature of the outsider looking in and trying to make sense of what he sees, and the perception that the home culture, and in this instance religious tradition, is something unified and definable, strongly comes to the fore in the latter part of BarsTcyj's Italian journey.

In the eighteenth century the Julian calendar had fallen eleven days behind the Gregorian one used by most European countries. Barslcyj was not particularly at home with the non-Biblical calendar, hence his confusion in subtracting rather than adding the eleven days. 49.

Now with Ukrainian independence, Ukrainian intellectuals are attempting to come to terms with the Ukrainian past in a more open analytic and scholarly vein. Historians are now able to consider long-forbidden critical interpretations, including emigré and other Western analyses of Russian and Soviet imperial policies and national history that were prepared under strongly contrasting intellectual traditions. The history of archeography and archival policies in the Russian Empire likewise deserve critical intellectual analysis. While archives are themselves a product of state functions, and records they hold result from the implementation of state policies, state policies towards archives in different periods reflect the ideology of the regime that created them and the political aims of the regime they serve. As we honor the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Archeographic Commission in Kiev, we may be tempted to look back to its beginnings with nostalgia and to view its thrice golden anniversary as an historical precedent to the impressive work being undertaken today by the revived Ukrainian Archeographic Commission and the Institute of Ukrainian Archeography recently founded on its basis. Already the present anniversary has produced an important monograph by O. I. Zhurba on the history of the Archeographic Commission during its first seventy-eight years, which surveys its fundamental contribution to documentary publishing in the Ukrainian lands and at the same time recognizes some of its intellectual heritage and the political traditions in which it functioned.1 Other Institute publications honoring the anniversary attest to the publication zeal and attainments of the new institute, while papers presented at the conference reveal the new enthusiasm for dispassionate, critical analysis of sources for Ukrainian history and the work of those historians and archivists who have in the past contributed so much to the Ukrainian archeographic and more broadly historical traditions. * The present essay is revised from a paper presented at the Seminar in Ukrainian Studies at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute in February 1988. A Ukrainian version was prepared for the Conference Honoring the 150th Anniversary of the Founding of the Archeographic Commission, at Kiev/Sedniv, 19-20 October 1993.\n\n28\n\nPATRICIA KENNEDY GRIMSTED\n\nI would like to take a somewhat broader view and reflect on the political and ideological context of the foundation of the Archeographic Commission in 1843 and the closely related founding of the Kiev Archive of Early Record Books nine years later, in terms of Russian imperial policies of the early nineteenth century. It behooves us today to look beyond the Ukrainian borders and view these developments in the comparative context of the Western regions of the Russian Empire and the eastern regions of the Habsburg Empire that then encompassed the Western Ukrainian lands. Today it is possible and appropriate to re-analyze the archeographic work of the nineteenth-century commissions and the related historical archives in light of a broader understanding of Russian and Austrian imperial policies operative in the period of their creation. By examining the ideological and political aims of the empires in founding and developing those archives, it will be possible to put archeographic efforts in Ukraine in their historiographie context in terms of the national, political, and social pressures facing imperial policies of the first half of the nineteenth century. One of the most penetrating intellectual analyses of the ideology of the reign of Nicholas I was written in the 1950s by Nicholas Riasanovsky.2 Riasanovsky's analysis of the tripartite state ideology, \"Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality\" (pravoslavie, samoderzhavie, narodnost'), formulated most forcefully by the Minister of Education under Nicholas I, Count Sergei Semenovich Uvarov (17861855), provides an important intellectual framework and a depth of understanding of the ideological principles that guided the autocratic Russian emperor of the period. Although Riasanovsky does not mention archives and archeography as reflecting state ideology, it is nevertheless worth considering them in that context. Zhurba's recent historical essay on the Archeographic Commission in Kiev takes into account the ideological background of Official Nationality, but the author did not have access to the Riasanovsky study. While Uvarov's name does not figure in Zhurba's account, it should be noted that many of the commission members were closely tied to St. Vladimir University in Kiev, and that the Kiev Archive for Early Record Books throughout the prerevolutionary period operated as a division of the university library under the firm tutelage of the Ministry of Education (Enlightenment). The ideas of Official Nationality provided essential underpinning for the Great Russian imperial component in state policies of the period, to the detriment of other Slavic nationalities within the Russian Empire. That imperial tradition is readily apparent in the development of archives and archeographic efforts in the Western gubernias in the early nineteenth century. For example, the 1840 proposal for the establishment of the Kiev commission, while demonstrating the important archeographic work to be performed by it, includes a revealing justification for its foundation: Recognizing the necessity of preservation of Russian antiquities in the Western gubernias, as the obvious proof of therightof the Empire to proprietorship of these lands,\n\nTHE KIEV ARCHEOGRAPHIC COMMISSION\n\n29\n\nfrom time immemorial belonging to the family of Saint Vladimir, Your Esteemed Excellency ordered the clear direction which must comply with the execution of this plan.3 The archeographic commission that was established in Kiev in 1843 did not bear the name \"Archeographic Commission,\" as did the Imperial Archeographic Commission established in St. Petersburg in 1834, although it was frequently referred to by that name. Nor did it have the broad scholarly aims of the present Archeographic Commission of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, reestablished in Kiev in 1987. The official name of the Temporary Commission for the Analysis of Early Acts in Archives Found in Localities and Monasteries of Kiev, Podolia, and Volhynia Gubernias (Vremennaia komissiia dlia razbora drevnikh aktov ν arkhivakh prisutstvennykh mest і monastyrei Kievskoi, Podol'skoi і Volynskoi gubernii) suggests the narrower archeographic рифове of its foundation. Its political aim in imperial eyes was as an offshoot of the ultimate imperial purpose of collecting documents that would provide justification for the \"return\" and integration into the Russian Empire of the lands recently annexed in the course of the Partitions of Poland. Similarly, the first official historical archive to be founded in the Ukrainian lands under the Russian Empire was established by imperial ukaz in Kiev in 1852 as the Kiev Central Archive for Record Books of Kiev, Volhynia, and Podolia Gubernias (Kievskii tsentral'nyi arkhiv dlia aktovykh knig gubernii Kievskoi, Volynskoi i Podol'skoi).4 Its major рифове was to house and preserve prenineteenth-century court record books from Right Bank Ukraine, the so-called South-West Region (Iugo-Zapadnyi krai) of the Russian Empire—the euphemism used in the nineteenth century for those Ukrainian lands. Most of these territories were annexed to the Russian Empire in the course of the Partitions of 1793 and 1795, although the city of Kiev and its immediately surrounding territory on the Right Bank had effectively ceased to be ruled by Poland after the Khmernytsicyi uprising in the mid-seventeenth century. The foundation of the archive in Kiev was part of a much larger effort on the part of the Russian authorities to collect and control documentation from all the Western gubernias. Similar historical archives were established simultaneously by the same ukaz in Vilnius for the North-West Region and in Vitsebsk for the so-called Western gubernias to consolidate pre-partition records from their respective territories. My earlier discussion of the establishment of the larger archive in Vilnius and the smaller one in Vitsebsk—and the archeographic commissions that worked with them—suggests their political context.5 The recent analysis of Belorussian historiography by Dmitrii Karev further develops this і\n\nThe Vilnius Archeographic Commission was founded for the historico-documentary elucidation of the Orthodox and \"elementary root Russian\" nature of the region, which in the nineteenth century was \"spoiled\" by the Poles. The commission was obliged \"through history\" to promote the return to its original and pure \"Russian character.\"6\n\n30\n\nPATRICIA KENNEDY GRIMSTED\n\nAlthough many of those involved in the foundation and development of these institutions were leading scholars of the period, the imperial purposes for founding these archives and the related archeographic commissions were hardly scholarly. Nor were they founded principally for the purpose of archival or historical preservation. The overriding political purposes involved, which strongly affected their orientation and functions, need to be understood in the historical context of the problems the Russian Empire faced in attempting to integrate the territories which—in the contemporary euphemism—had been \"recently reunited to the Empire.\" Intense problems of social, political, and economic integration came in the wake of the annexation of the vast western borderlands that had been part of the partitioned Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for three or four centuries. The Polish or polonized Ruthenian upper classes in these regions, accustomed to many more local rights and privileges, were anxious to preserve their former lands and qualify for Russian gentry rights, such as would exempt them from the military draft and allow appropriate entrance into the imperial Table of Ranks. In Russian imperial eyes in that period, there was to be no distinction between Polish and Ukrainian—or Ruthenian—gentry; all were to be considered of common Russian stock. Under the Polish Commonwealth, entry into the ranks of the szlachta had been relatively difficult, but under Russian rule, it was initially fairly easy for Poles to secure gentry rights in the Russian Empire, even with forged documents. As proof of gentry status, Russian authorities required official copies of documents certified by local uezd courts. Accordingly, official copies of documents from pre-partition court and municipal records were in great demand to substantiate family lineage and noble status, landholding grants, and other privileges.7 After the dissolution of the Hetmanate at the end of the eighteenth century, some Cossack officers were also anxious to enter the ranks of the Russian gentry. They, too, often sought false Polish documents.8 As a result, there was a serious wave of fabrication of documents and attempts at falsification of the original record books and individual documents. Throughout the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth extensive systematic records had been kept of grants of land and other privileges, and of various court proceedings and other legal actions on the part of the gentry, in much more legally systematized form than was known under other parts of the Russian Empire.9 Record books themselves were traditionally retained in the building that housed the court or court office. Many of these groups of records in the course of time had fallen on neglect or plunder, and the wars that accompanied the KhmernytsTiyi uprising in the mid-seventeenth century proved disastrous for many of the earlier records. The archival fate of pre-partition court and municipal records from the Western Ukrainian lands of the Commonwealth that came under the rule of the Habsburg Empire after the Partitions differed remarkably from that of records from areas that came under the Russian Empire. Within ten years of the first Partition (1772),\n\nTHE KIEV ARCHEOGRAPHIC COMMISSION\n\n31\n\nAustrian authorities had established a comprehensive archive in L'viv and brought into state archival custody all local court records from the palatinates of Ruthenia and Belz. They hired extensive teams of officials to prepare name and geographic indexes of the record books, resulting in a set of remarkable finding aids that can still be used today.10 The story is quite different for records from the Ukrainian lands of the Commonwealth that became part of the Russian Empire. Although the basic organization of the court system and the nature of the records produced in Right Bank Ukraine were quite similar to those in other parts of the Commonwealth, inasmuch as the palatinates of Kiev, Volhynia, and Bratslav had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until 1569, their courts functioned under the provisions of the Lithuanian Statutes of 1529 and 1566. Even after these lands were shifted to Crown jurisdiction by the Union of Lublin in 1569, their courts continued to function according to the slightly divergent Lithuanian provisions.11 Documents in most of the court record books from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century accordingly were inscribed in the Ruthenian language, which had been the main chancery language throughout the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The terms of annexation of the Union of Lublin (1569) guaranteed the continued use of the Ruthenian language for the local courts in these areas, although increasingly during the seventeenth century Polish became the language of government and administration throughout the Right Bank Ukrainian lands.12 It is worth noting in this connection that there was— and still is— no word for the Ruthenian language in the Russian language, and in the nineteenth century there was a noted tendency to speak of it as \"Russian,\" although clearly it was far from the chancery language of Muscovy during that period.13 After Russian annexation in 1793 and 1795, and earlier in the case of Kiev and its environs, local Russian courts and municipal administrations superseded the pre-partition Polish agencies. Their functions differed considerably. In the course of the early nineteenth century, Russian authorities sought to extinguish earlier distinctive privileges and subject the local population in the western regions to the more autocratic Russian traditions, including serfdom, which had not been known under the Commonwealth. Initially little attention was paid to the earlier records by Russian authorities, and there were no efforts to protect them or bring them into archival custody. Only when they became aware of their potential legal value and their current political importance did they take measures to ensure their preservation and control over their use and disposition. Pressures for Russification and persecution of Poles—and Polonized Ruthenians— increased following the 1831 Polish uprising. The rights of the Roman Catholic and Uníate Churches, which were widespread in the area and catered to the local population, were withdrawn. Privileges for the Jewish municipal population were also curtailed. The respectable St. Vladimir University, founded in Kiev in 1834, was closed in 1839, its Polish professors were transferred elsewhere, and it later reopened as a strictly Russian institution with\n\n32\n\nPATRICIA KENNEDY GRIMSTED\n\ninstruction in the Russian language. As Russification and religious discrimination increased, the multiplying numbers of forged documents from local record books attracted imperial attention.14 Government authorities decided they needed more complete control over records from the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Hence out of the reactionary political climate in the 1830s came a new concern for the archival heritage of the Commonwealth and efforts to ensure its preservation and description. Commissions in \"the Western gubernias that were returned from Poland\" were established by imperial ukaz in December 1833 under the Ministry of Justice to verify, describe, and prevent further falsification of local court records as well as parish registers, including a separate commission for the Right Bank Ukrainian gubernias of Kiev, Volhynia, and Podolia.15 The commission sent out representatives to local courts where the early record books were housed. They were instructed to count and number the folios in the record books, and record their findings at the end. A cord was to be tied through each book and affixed by seal to the binding so that additional pages could not be added. Lists of the books and inventories were to be prepared. Many record books still extant in the Kiev archive (TsDIA-K) have the stamp of the 1833 commission with the appropriate cords and seals.16 On the whole, however, the commission's work was not successful, and there were many later complaints about the sloppiness and inadequacy of its efforts.17 New commissions were established in 1842 to complete the examination and inventorying of the record books, and more stringent conditions were prescribed for their work.18 As pointed out by specialists both at the time and later, however, the work of the commissions in terms of inventorying the record books themselves proved almost a total failure. The commissions lacked a working office and trained staff. In most cases, the individuals sent out to examine local records were unable to read the various forms of Ruthenian, to say nothing of the Latin, Polish, and in some cases even Armenian languages, in which the documents were recorded, let alone to understand the early judicial terminology involved. It is understandable that in many instances they simply gave up before they started. Indeed, it soon came to light that even when they had not begun the inventorying process, they sometimes filed reports that the work was completed.19 Descriptive inventories were prepared in a few areas in Ukrainian lands, but according to one recent account, only a few inventories for the gubernia of Podolia were completed.20 For Kiev gubernia, inventories were completed for four uezds—Chyhyryn, Lypovets', Uman', and Skvyra—but these covered court registers only from the post-partition Russian period.21 Some volumes in TsDIA-K today bear the stamp of the 1842 commission.22 The basic failure of this commission led to political pressure on the governor-general to remedy the situation with the formation of a proper archive. The reactionary Russian governor-general in Kiev, D. G. Bibikov, who had been appointed as Nicholas Γ s strong man to impose Russification on the Ukrainian lands, took a special interest in the problem.23 Strongly committed to the\n\nTHE KIEV ARCHEOGRAPHIC COMMISSION\n\n33\n\nsuppression of Polish influences, Bibikov played a crucial role in implementing imperial policies in Ukrainian lands, which is shown in the contemporary treatment by the historian and editor of Kievlianin, V. la. Shul'gin. Shul'gin's account provides a helpful background regarding Bibikov's attitudes and policies in the face of the social, religious, and cultural tensions of the period brought about by the bitter repression of the Polish population following the 1831 uprising.24 Shul'gin does not analyze the work of the commissions in dealing with local record books, but according to other reports, under Bibikov's direction the commission for the South-West Region was the most effective. He himself boasted that there were \"some 64,000 szlachta to be excluded from the gentry rolls, because they were illegally inscribed.\"25 Reference was made elsewhere to the fact that during this period in the three Ukrainian gubernias, 141,708 individuals of Polish origin had used false documents to establish claims to Russian gentry status, many of whom were discovered under Bibikov's investigation.26 These allegations of documentary forgeries and falsification now need further investigation as to the extent they were part of Bibikov's scheme to disinherit as many gentry of Polish origin as possible. Simultaneously with the failure of the ill-fated 1842 commission, Bibikov played a major role in the establishment of an archeographic commission in Kiev, modeled on the scholarly Imperial Archeographic Commission established in St. Petersburg in 1834. With the immediate example of a similar archeographic commission established in Vilnius in 1842, Bibikov sought and received imperial sanction for the formation of the Kiev commission. Although its purposes were indeed the location and publication of historical documents from Right Bank Ukraine, the strong nationalist aim of government authorities is everywhere apparent. They conceived of such a commission with the ideological aim of demonstrating the traditional Russian character of these areas and hence promoting the values of the Official Nationality propagated by the Emperor. Bibikov described the potential work of the commission in a letter to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in April 1843, explaining the need to collect documents \"which clearly demonstrate the inherent Russian character, which was the most significant phenomenon from earliest times in the South-West Region.\"27 To be sure, in the eyes of its academic founders in Kiev the Archeographic Commission also had serious scholarly purposes. Like the nationality elements in Uvarov's policy of \"Official Nationality,\" it was in a wider context a product of the general increased interest in history and antiquities throughout the Russian Empire in the period, and in a broader political and intellectual context, a reflection of early nineteenth-century European romanticism. The aims of most of the intellectual leaders of the commission were in fact basically scholarly and historical, and certainly the instigating circle of interested intellectuals in Kiev was strongly committed to serious archeographic work and historical investigation. This circle included M. O. Maksymovych, rector of the university in Kiev;28 N. D. Ivanishev (M. D. Ivanyshev), dean of the law faculty and later rector of the\n\n34\n\nPATRICIA KENNEDY GRIMSTED\n\nuniversity;29 Father Innokentii (I. A. Borisov), rector of the Kiev Theological Academy;30 and the history professor V. F. Dombrovskii (DombrovsTcyi).31 More than the others, Governor-General Bibikov saw the political potentialities of the Kiev commission and sought to use it for imperial ends. Further serious study of Bibikov, his intellectual outlook, and his role and personal aims in the establishment of the commission, is needed. There is little doubt that he viewed the commission as his own political tool rather than an independent learned society. In organizing the commission, Bibikov relied heavily on his strong supporter Baron Stanislav de Chodoire (Shoduar), who was active in Kiev intellectual circles,32 and on his chancery director, M. E. Pisarev.33 He conceived of the commission as a learned government body directly subordinate to the administration of his own office, as was clear in its first meeting (8 December 1843). Pisarev was appointed as first president of the commission (1843-1848), and Chodoire as vice-president. Pisarev, however, submitted a letter refusing the presidency for reasons of health, and hence the commission was actually without a president for its first two years, leaving Bibikov himself in charge.34 Pisarev assumed the role from 1845 until 1848. Again, further analysis is needed of these individuals and their immediate roles and purposes in the operation.24 Ivanishev, who succeeded Chodoire as vice-president of the commission in 1859, was particularly active in drafting and implementing its publication program, and from the beginning assumed a major editorial role. He was one of the first to see the publication potential in the pre-nineteenth-century court record books, but given his position at the university in Kiev, he necessarily subordinated his earlier scholarly interests to those with Russian nationalist overtones that would coincide with official policy, as exemplified by the Russifying intentions of Bibikov. One of his reports at the time was later quoted as follows: The main purpose of the Kiev Commission for the Analysis of Early Acts in the present time consists of following the path of historical research, to encourage the return to Russian nationality in South-West Russia and Lithuania, which has been weakened by Catholic propaganda and Polish patriotism.35\n\nAs a recent study of Ivanishev shows, in the early years of his academic career he had considerable interest in work with West Slavic sources. But as he is quoted as saying in a letter to a colleague in 1840, after he had received his appointment to the university kafedra in Kiev he considered it necessary to devote himself first of all to the preparation for publication \"of documents of early Russian law that demonstrate a common Slavic system of law from earliest times.\"36 Ivanishev complied with official policy to devote his efforts to show the traditional Russian roots of the gentry as well as the peasantry in Right Bank Ukraine, which would serve to reinforce the anti-Polish orientation of Russian authorities in the period. One of the first juridical texts (1557) from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to be prepared under his direction was recommended by Baron de Chodoire, and its\n\nTHE KIEV ARCHEOGRAPHIC COMMISSION\n\n35\n\npublication justified, because it demonstrated the extent to which the landholding strata in Lithuania \"always remained more faithful than others to its basic pure Russian nationality.\" Hence, such a text could further \"demonstrate and contribute 37 to the history of early Russian legal practices.\" Once the Archeographic Commission was in place, further pressures for the formation of an archive for the Right Bank Ukrainian gubernias came from members of the commission as well. Their appeals, coinciding with the failure of the work of the 1842 local commissions, helped to convince Bibikov of the need for an archive. Although members of the Kiev Archeographic Commission were from the first strongly committed to the foundation of an archive in Kiev, it was not until the end of 1849 and early 1850 that Bibikov was able to act decisively and pursue the plan in St. Petersburg. The revolutionary events of 1848 in Europe and the fear of further revolt in Ukraine made Nicholas and his conservative officials in St. Petersburg more anxious than ever for tightened polices, safeguards, and repressive measures in \"Little Russia.\" In Kiev, Ivanishev was especially active in getting the archive started and preparing the necessary proposals and reports for 38 Bibikov. Bibikov pursued the plan actively in St. Petersburg, and even sent the Minister of Justice—who initially did not support the plan—a sample of a dilapidated record book from the Kremenets' court as evidence of the destruction of records with improper storage. Simultaneously, reports came in regarding the failure of the 1842 commissions in both the western gubernias and the North-West Region, corroborating Bibikov's arguments. Nicholas I finally concurred with Bibikov's proposal and ordered plans to establish three archives simultaneously in Kiev, Vilnius, and Vitsebsk.39 Bibikov may well have also been using the episode to promote his own career in the imperial capital; his Russification efforts in Ukraine were well rewarded when he became Minister of Internal Affairs in 1852. The work of the commission and the archive declined in the period after Bibikov's departure. After its establishment in 1852, the Kiev Central Archive was housed in the library of St. Vladimir University in Kiev, under the direction of the university librarian, and was legally and administratively part of the university. Its first director was university librarian A. la. Krasovskii.40 The archive was in fact run by two assistants, only one with a permanent appointment.41 Although its resources were severely limited, the archive grew rapidly. During its first few years, it accessioned close to six thousand record books and half a million separate individual documents. The record books accessioned by 1861 (through number 5,838) were all listed in a preliminary inventory compiled by the current archivist E. V. Stankevich, and published serially from 1862 to 1864.42 Only a few scattered record books were added later (before the revolution), and their numbers added to the master copy of the Stankevich inventory by the later archivist, I. M. Kamanın.43 The arrangement of record books within the archive bore little relation to the distinctive institutions of the Polish period which created them or the several\n\n36\n\nPATRICIA KENN"
