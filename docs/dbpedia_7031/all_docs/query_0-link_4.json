[Parallel texts: Ukrainian and English: English text: 125,127,129,131,133,135,137,139,141,143].\n\nAycock examines Lesia Ukrainka's play Kaminnyi hospodar in comparison with some of the previous versions of the Don Juan legend, such as those by Tirso, Molière, Mozart and Pushkin, and states that even though Lesia Ukrainka \"works within the frame of the legend and makes use of its basic elements\", she creates at the same time \"a substantially new version, one that reflects her own artistic viewpoints.\" Aycock discusses the setting and plot of the play, the theme of freedom, the scenes of seduction, the dinner invitation to the stone statue, the stone imagery and the motif of disguise, but - in his view - \"it is Lesia Ukrainka's conception and development of her characters that seem to make her drama strikingly different from the previous versions of the legend.\"\n\nB\n\nA040. \"Babii, Oles.\" Encyclopedia of Ukraine. 1 (1984): 153.

Denied visit to mother, 82.\" Smoloskyp. 8.36 (Winter 1987): 7-8. port.\n\nA memoir of Iurii Badz'o about how he \"was given permission to take leave from exile and spend one month in the village of Kopynivtsi in Transcarpathian Region\" to visit his 82-year-old mother, and how this permission was revoked upon his arrival in Kiev. With an editorial note and a b/w portrait of the author.\n\nA045. Badz'o, Iurii. \"An open letter to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU from citizen of the Ukrainian SSR, Iurii Vasylovych Badzo.\" / Tr. from the Ukrainian by Roman Senkus. Journal of Ukrainian Studies. 9.1 (Summer 1984): 74-94 and 9. 2 (Winter 1984): 47-70.\n\nThe open letter is a summary of Badz'o's unfinished work \"The Right to Live\", the manuscript of which was confiscated in February 1979 during a police search of the author's apartment. According to Badz'o, \"taday's party-state ideology and policies in the sphere of national relations deprive the Ukrainian nation... of its fundamental and decisive right - the right to live.\" The author discusses what are in his view \"conditions of ideological ethnocide, political injustice, cultural second-ratedness, and spiritual inadequacy\" forced upon Ukrainian people. Badz'o calls attention to the fact that government policies in the USSR have \"resulted in the substantial forcing-out of the use of Ukrainian in all spheres of life\" in Ukraine. He cites statistics and examples of Russification in education, in book publishing, in historical scholarship, in literature, theater and film, as well as instances of \"endless repressions of those Ukrainians who oppose Russification...\"\n\nA046. Badz'o, Iurii. \"The return of Ukrainian poet - Wasyl Stus.\" ABN Correspondence. 40.4 (July-August 1989): 15-17.\n\nTranslation of a letter written by Iurii Badz'o from his exile in Yakutia to the weekly Literaturna Ukraina. The letter, dated 5 December 1987, demands from the leadership of the Writers' Union of Ukraine to begin the process of civic rehabilitation of Vasyl' Stus, a poet who, according to Badz'o, spent 13 years \"in concentration camps behind barbed wire and in exile\" and died \"on the night of 2nd-3rd March 1985, in his prison cell in the Urals.\" In Badz'o's view, Stus's place \"comes close to that of Shevchenko\". Badz'o proposes that Stus's works, hitherto available only outside of the USSR, be published and that the 6th of January 1988, Stus's 50th birthday, be marked on the pages of Literaturna Ukraina as the first step in the poet's rehabilitation. The letter is accompanied by a brief note from UCIS.\n\nA047. Badz'o, Iurii. \"The right to life: the national issue\"/ by Yuriy Badzyo. ABN Correspondence. 31.2 (March-April 1980): 8-13.\n\nThe text of an open letter addressed to \"the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, foreign Communist parties and the democratic citizens of the world\". Badz'o, a literary scholar arrested on April 23, 1979 for alleged crimes against the state, analyzes Ukrainian history and Ukrainian-Russian relations, concluding that \"the imperialist-chauvinist policy of the CPSU has denied the Ukrainian nation its right to life.\" With a brief editorial note.\n\nA048. Badz'o, Iurii. \"To everyone who is capable of hearing the cry of human suffering.\" Appeal by Yuriy Badzio. ABN Correspondence. 38.6 (November-December 1987): 1-5. port.\n\nAccording to the editorial note appended, the appeal was dated August 31 and reached the West via samvydav channels. Badz'o protests the treatment to which he was subjected while attempting to visit his ailing 82-year-old mother and appeals to the Secretary-General of the UN, Javier Prez de Cullar, to US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, to the writer Gabriel Garci M rquez and to Mother Theresa to intercede on his behalf with the Soviet authorities.\n\nA049. \"Badzo, Yurii.\" Encyclopedia of Ukraine. 1 (1984): 158.

Lypa and published in Odessa in 1905.\n\nA052. \"Bahliuk, Hryhorii.\" Encyclopedia of Ukraine. 1 (1984): 159.\n\nHryhorii Bahliuk (1905-1938) was a writer and journalist, editor of the literary journal Zaboi (Literaturnyi Donbas ) (8 lines).\n\nA053. \"Bahmut, Ivan.\" Encyclopedia of Ukraine. 1 (1984): 159.\n\nIvan Bahmut (1903-1975) wrote travel books and books for children.

Kulish's The Black Council.\" Canadian Slavonic Papers. 24. 2 (June 1982): 152-160.\n\nChorna Rada by Panteleimon Kulish has attracted attention primarily as a social study, says Bahrij-Pikulyk, and only Borys Neiman tried in 1927 \"to demonstrate that The Black Council was a historical novel in the tradition of Sir Walter Scott.\" Bahrij-Pikulyk attempts to vindicate Neiman's classification in this article based on her 1978 University of Toronto doctoral dissertation entitled \"Taras Bulba and The Black Council: Adherence to and divergence from Sir Walter Scott's historical novel pattern.\"\n\nA055. Bahrij-Pikulyk, Romana. \"Superheroes, gentlemen or pariahs? The Cossacks in Nikolai Gogol's Taras Bulba and Panteleimon Kulish's Black Council.\" Journal of Ukrainian Studies. 5. 2 (Fall 1980): 30-47.\n\nThe author distinguishes between historical romances that \"present illusionary worlds in which the heroes remain heroes and succeed in all sorts of incredible adventures and where the action consists of a fantastic succession of events\", and historical novels that focus \"on common, everyday, middle class reality\", have \"a non-heroic hero, a plot that issues from character, and a deromanticizing style.\" She discusses at length Gogol's Taras Bulba which is classified as a historical romance, and P. Kulish's Chorna rada, which is, in the author's view, a historical novel with a historical framework.\n\nA056. Bahrij-Pikulyk, Romana. \"The use of historical sources in Taras Bulba and The Black Council.\" Studia Ucrainica. 2(1984): 49-64.\n\nA revised and expanded version of a paper presented at the Canadian Association of Slavists' Conference at the University of Ottawa in June 1982. Kulish's The Black Council, says the author, was written as a refutation of and challenge to Gogol's Taras Bulba. \"The only feature that these two works share is the romantic subject matter of the cossacks; yet, while Gogol's treatment of this subject is romantic, Kulish's is not. Taras Bulba is an inflationary, subjective and thoroughly romantic work written in the tradition of romance, whereas The Black Council is a deflationary and critical work belonging to the tradition of the Realist novel,\" says Bahrij-Pikulyk. Gogol's approach was mythical and subjective; Kulish, on the other hand, \"made wide use of a variety of Ukrainian and non-Ukrainian historical and ethnographic sources\", and the author makes an attempt to document this.\n\nA057. Bahry, Romana. \"J.J. Rousseau's Émile and P. Kulish's views on education.\" In Working Order: Essays Presented to G.S.N. Luckyj. Ed. by E.N. Burstynsky and R. Lindheim. Journal of Ukrainian Studies. 14.1/2 (Summer/Winter 1989): 57-79. Biblio.\n\n\"Like Rousseau, who in his Émile provides not just a manual on education but a 'philosophical treatise on the nature of man', Kulish in his Letters and other essays presents his views on education in a philosophical framework which addresses such issues as the nature of man, ethics, and freedom,\" says Bahry. She claims that Kulish's views on the goodness of human nature and the dichotomy between the \"heart\" and the false exterior \"are largely derived from Rousseau\". Kulish's innovation, according to Bahry, \"lies in his addition of the national dimension to education...\"\n\nA058. \"Baidebura, Pavlo.\" Encyclopedia of Ukraine. 1 (1984): 160.\n\nFourteen lines of bio-bibliographical data about Pavlo Baidebura (born 1901), author of short stories and books for children.\n\nA059. Baklanova, Lyubov. \"Bard of Bukovina : centennial of the death of Yuri Fedkovich.\" Forum. 73 (Spring 1988): 23-25. illus., port.\n\nA brief biography of Iurii Fed'kovych illustrated with a b/w portrait of the poet and accompanied by six of Fed'kovych's poems reprinted from The Ukrainian Poets (1963). [cf. T101]. Fed'kovych, according to Baklanova, \"reflected in his works the exploitation in rural areas, asserted a firm belief in the strength of the people and in their inevitable victory over the oppressors\".\n\nA060 . Balan, B. \"Kysilevska, Olena.\" Encyclopedia of Ukraine. 2 (1988): 735-736. Port.\n\nAbout Olena Kysilevs'ka, née Simenovych (1869-1956), journalist, community activist and writer. With a b/w portrait by M. Dmytrenko.\n\nA061. Balan, Jars. \"Some notes towards the writing of a history of the Ukrainian literary institution in Canada.\" Canadian Review of Comparative Literature. 16.[3/4] (September-December 1989): 745-762. Biblio. (Special issue: Literatures of lesser diffusion).\n\nAn overview of the development of Ukrainian literature in Canada which, in Balan's view, \"has been characterized by fairly consistent growth and a steady movement towards greater sophistication. Essentially, each generation of immigrants has made a distinctive contribution to the evolving literary culture and tradition and in the process transforming Ukrainian-Canadian belles-lettres from a cottage industry to a semi-professional activity.\" The scope of the article is limited to literary works written originally in Ukrainian. Rather than enumerating the works and authors who constitute the body of this literature, Balan offers critical observations on various trends and characteristics and makes a number of detailed suggestions for what he considers to be much needed critical studies and English-language anthologies of this literature still to be published.\n\nA062. Balan, Jars. \"Ukrainian writing\". Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature. Gen. ed.: William Toye. Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1983. 807-810.\n\nA critical survey of Ukrainian literature in Canada from the first poem published in Ukrainian by Ivan Zbura (dated 1898) to the contemporary Ukrainian novelist Ulas Samchuk. Balan surveys the literary contributions of Ukrainians against the different social backgrounds of the four waves of Ukrainian immigration to Canada and singles out for special attention an anthology of indigenous Ukrainian folk poetry Pisni pro Kanadu i Avstriiu (1908; 4th ed. under a changed title in 1927) which sold over 50,000 copies; Paul Crath (Krath) (1882-1952), \"perhaps the most interesting writer of the pioneer generation\", Andrii Babiuk (1897-1937), also known under his literary pseudonym Myroslav Irchan, who, according to Balan, \"wrote much that enriches both the tradition of Ukrainian writing in Canada and the larger Canadian literary heritage\", Illia Kyriiak (Kiriak) (1889-1955), the author of Syny zemli, \"a well-told story that chronicles many of the important stages in the development of Ukrainian-Canadian life\" and Ulas Samchuk (born 1905), \"the foremost living author among the post-war immigrants.\" Other writers are mentioned briefly. Balan notes the role of the writers' association \"Slovo\" and devotes a separate paragraph to Ukrainian-Canadian authors writing primarily or exclusively in English.\n\nA063. Balla, Gyula. \"The poetry of the Ukrainian 'New Wave'.\" Acta Litteraria Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae. 25. 3-4 (1983): 387-394.\n\nThe poets of the 1960's \"had to shoulder the responsibility of restoring the respectability of poetry\", says Balla. The article concentrates on the work of Ivan Drach, \"the most accomplished member of this group of poets.\" \"In Ivan Drach's poetry, we can witness a peculiar interpretation and renewal of the balladistic form that transcends the genre as it is,\" says the author. Interspersed with some unattributed translated fragments of Drach's poetry [q.v.T077]. With a note about historical antecedents and about Ukrainian writers outside of Ukraine proper.\n\nA064. \"Bandrivsky, Dmytro.\" Encyclopedia of Ukraine. 1 (1984): 169-170.\n\nDmytro Bandrivs'kyi (b.1897) was an author of short stories, poetry and articles.

Benedek writes about the \"heroic Romanticism depicting an idealized reality\" of an earlier era and the \"poetic prose that could express the life of the heart...\" of the 1960's. He mentions the \"ascetical\" short story and documentarist novels and discusses the 'traditional historical novel\" and the innovative historical novel, which can \"beside the epic evocation of the past, detect the social and psychological processes that underlie the historical events\". He writes about the intellectual or psychoanalytical prose which \"poses the most pressing questions of our days\" and is especially impressed with the \"chimerical prose\" which in Ukraine grew out of \"rather rich and viable\" \"traditions of a grotesque realism\". According to Benedek, \"the chimerical novel that aspires toward higher peaks of literature does nothing else but reestablishes the once broken continuity of literary development arching from Kotlarevski through Kvitka-Osnovyanenko up to the writers of the present day, thereby incorporating a forgotten store of national culture.\" A number of writers are mentioned, some in unusual Hungarian transliteration: i.e. Khirir Tyutyunnik, Ievhen Khutsalo, Oles Khonchar, Pavlo Zakhrebelni and others.\n\nA081.

'For me, reading Tronka,' writes worker Shilyaev from Donetsk, 'was like listening to music that moves you and fills your soul with the joy of life.

Carynnyk, Marco. \"Poetry and politics.\" Studia Ucrainica. 4 (1988): 23-31.\n\nMost of Ukrainian poetry, says Carynnyk, is programmed poetry, i.e. it expresses a certain ideology, and programmed poets \"have a dangerous tendency to veer off into codified abstractions\". The Eastern European tradition of seeing the poet as a national bard and conservative tastes of Ukrainian reading public make for a greater popularity of programmed poetry. Vasyl' Stus's poetry, says Carynnyk, is \"unprogrammed, intensive rather than extensive, lyric rather than epic.\" His poetry is dominated by the Rilkean theme of the artist finding his essence \"in a communion with the world and with things, so complete that it appears to be an interpenetration.\" Vasyl' Stus, according to Carynnyk, \"refused to place his poetic talent at the service of any party or ideology.\" His life, his persecution by the Soviet regime and his death in a Soviet labor camp, however, prove how difficult is the distinction between pure and engaged poetry. The refusal of any political mission, says Carynnyk citing Hans Magnus Enzensberger, is of itself a political mission. The article is illustrated with two Stus's poems in the original Ukrainian and in Carynnyk's English translation.
