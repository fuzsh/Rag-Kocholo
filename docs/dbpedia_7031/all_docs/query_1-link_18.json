This conference-meeting was convened thus instead of convening physically (as customarily) in Winnipeg, Manitoba. There were 6 cathedrals in Canada where this meeting took place simultaneously through a computer-network : in Winnipeg, Manitoba (Holy Trinity Metropolitan Cathedral) ; Vancouver, British Columbia (Holy Trinity Cathedral) ; in Edmonton, Alberta (Saint John's Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral) ; in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (Holy Trinity Cathedral) ; in Toronto, Ontario (Saints Vladimir and Olga Cathedral) ; in Montréal, Québec (Saint Sophie Cathedral).\n\nThere was a total of 205 delegates, which was near the average attendance for such sobors.\n\nIn the course of the work of the Sobor, there was the necessary election in order to nominate to the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople a candidate for election as Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, who would succeed the Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk).\n\nThere were 3 candidates who were considered : Archbishop Job (Getcha), Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk), and Bishop Andriy (Peshko). The final choice of the members of the sobor was Archbishop Job (Getcha). He had received more than the minimum required 51% of the votes, and there was no subsequent voting required.\n\nThe election by the Sobor (Assembly) of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada then had to be confirmed by the Holy Synod of Bishops of Constantinople (as is described in the Consistory By-laws).\n\nUpon having received the nomination (with accompanying documents) from the Sobor of the UOCC, the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople elected Vladyka Ilarion (Rudnyk) to become Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Canada.\n\nThe Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople elected Archbishop Job (Getcha) to become Metropolitan of Pisidia, in west-central Türkiye (Turkey), north of Lycia, and east of Ephesus.\n\nConfirmation of election in Constantinople/Istanbul, 2022\n\nOn 29 August, 2022, Vladyka Ilarion (Rudnyk) was at the Phanar in Constantinople for the purpose of the first confirmation of the election in June, 2022. He co-served the Divine Liturgy with Patriarch Bartholomew (Archontonis) in the Cathedral of Saint George at the Phanar.\n\nEnthronement as Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, 2022\n\nOn Saturday, 19 November, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., in Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Enthronement Hierarchical Divine Liturgy was served. Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) presided at the Divine Liturgy. He was assisted by Bishop Andriy (Peshko), many priests, several deacons, subdeacons and Altar-servers. Present also were Metropolitan Archbishop Sotirios (Athanassoulas), Exarch of Canada for the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk), Former Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) at the Phanar, Istanbul, 2023\n\nOn Sunday, 2 July, 2023, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew (Archontonis) was present and praying during the Divine Liturgy at Saint George's Cathedral in the Patriarchate compound. He gave the blessing that Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) preside (\"horostasia\") over the Divine Liturgy. Metropolitan Job (Getcha) of Pisidia, Bishop Athenagoras (Ziliaskopoulos) of Nazianzos, and the Honourable Roman Nedilskyi, General Consul of Ukraine in Constantinople were also present and praying with the congregation of the Faithful.\n\nChange of calendar for the UOCC, 2023\n\nOn 1 December, 2023, in accordance with the resolutions of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyk) announced that, effective that day, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada moved to use the New (Revised Julian) Calendar. He allowed that for a brief period of time, a parish might remain on the Old (Julian) Calendar.\n\nIt seems that subsequently, John's Cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta, was the first to adopt the New (Revised Julian) Calendar.\n\nHowever, a previously-existing group of persons began to encourage resistance to the immediacy of this change. It was their understanding that the process would be determined ultimately and finally at the next general sobor of the UOCC. Therefore, on 16 December, 2023, Metropolitan Ilarion issued a formal letter concerning the situation, together with a letter of support sent to him by his predecessor (Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk)). He called the resisters to repentance.\n\nArchpastoral visitation, 2023\n\nOn 10 December, 2023, Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyk) visited Saint Andrew's Sobor in Edmonton. The visit coincided with the parish Altar Feast-day of the Holy Apostle Andrew, the First-called. He presided at the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy, and he gave the homily on that day.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion greeted at his arrival in the Narthex, and then at the entrance to the Temple\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) preaching\n\nParish organisations\n\nThe Men’s Club\n\nThe Saint Andrew’s Men’s Club was registered in Alberta under the Societies Act. Its primary purpose is to raise funds for charitable purposes and, as such, supports the parish with funding for the capital projects and cultural programmes. The Men’s Club provides a significant contribution to the parish capital works programmes.\n\nWith regard to donations to other charitable organisations, the Men’s Club and the Ladies’ Auxiliary coordinate their donations to avoid duplication amongst the parish organisations. The Men’s Club completed a “space use study”, and the recommendations were significant. The recommended improvements required acceptance from the related organisations, and funding for the capital improvements from the Men’s Club.\n\nMetropolitan Ladies League\n\nThe Metropolitan Ladies' League is an independent organisation registered under the Societies Act of Alberta.
