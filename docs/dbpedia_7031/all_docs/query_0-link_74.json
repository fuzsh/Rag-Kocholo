Joseph Rene Vilatte (1854–1929) of the American Catholic Church. The ceremony culminated a long search by McGuire, an African American, for recognition for his ministry.\n\nMcGuire, an immigrant from the West Indies, had joined the Episcopal Church in 1895 and was ordained two years later. Like all American denominations with both episcopal leadership and a significant black membership, the Episcopal Church faced problems and pressures related to electing and elevating their first black member to the bishopric. Within the Episcopal Church the cries for a bishop drawn from among black members grew even louder after the Civil War. The leadership refused these demands, arguing that, since the church did not recognize racial distinctions, it could not elevate a man to the bishopric just because he was black. A step toward the solution came in 1910 with the creation of black “suffragan” bishops, bishops without right to succession and without vote in the house of bishops. Among those who complained that suffragans were not enough was Dr. McGuire.\n\nMcGuire served parishes in Cincinnati, Ohio; Richmond, Virginia; Philadelphia; and Cambridge, Massachusetts, before becoming the archdeacon for the Commission for Work Among the Colored People under William Montgomery Brown, the bishop of Arkansas. In 1911 McGuire became field secretary for the American Church Institute, but two years later he left the country for his native Antigua, where he remained for five years serving as a pastor. Then, in 1918, McGuire moved to New York City to participate in the movement led by Marcus Garvey, the United Negro Improvement Association. Working with Garvey only strengthened McGuire’s dissatisfaction with serving a church where black people were systematically denied positions of leadership, and he became determined to pursue an independent course. In 1919 he left the Episcopal Church to found his own congregation, the Good Shepherd Independent Episcopal Church.\n\nMcGuire seems to have settled on the idea of a separate black church with a recognized apostolic succession. On September 2, 1921, in the Church of the Good Shepherd in New York City, a meeting of independent black clergy resolved itself into the first synod of the African Orthodox Church and designated McGuire as its bishop-elect. The synod then entered into negotiations with the Russian Orthodox Church in America in its search for episcopal orders for its newly elected bishop. The Russians indicated a willingness to consecrate McGuire, but only if they controlled the newly created jurisdiction. The idea of nonblack control had no appeal to either McGuire or his followers. They then turned to the American Catholic Church, headed by Abp. Joseph Rene Vilatte, who was willing to confer orders and asked little or nothing in the way of control. On September 29, 1921, Abp. Vilatte, assisted by Carl A. Nybladh, consecrated Dr. McGuire in the Church of Our Lady of Good Death in Chicago. Upon his return from his consecration, McGuire was enthroned as the first bishop of the new African Orthodox Church.\n\nThe new jurisdiction grew quickly, and within two years had parishes in Brooklyn, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; New Haven, Connecticut; and outside the country in Nova Scotia, Canada; Cuba; and Santa Domingo in the Dominican Republic. Soon afterward, congregations in Philadelphia, Boston, Florida, and the Bahamas were added. McGuire also initiated an order of deaconesses. Its major appeal was to African Americans of West Indian heritage.\n\nMcGuire died in 1934 and was succeeded by William E. J. Robertson (1875–1962). In the wake of the passing of the original leadership, the church went through a period of turmoil and several schismatic churches, all now defunct, emerged as bishops left or were suspended from office. However, the time of trouble passed and Robertson remained in the archbishop’s throne until his death in 1962. He was succeeded by Richard Grant Robinson (served 1962–1967), who adopted the patriarchal name Peter IV. Among Robinson’s major accomplishments was the reunion he effected with the last remaining group that had left a generation before, the Holy African Church, then under the leadership of Gladstone St. Clair Nurse. Nurse succeeded Robinson as the archbishop of the reunited African Orthodox Church. Nurse was succeeded in turn by William R. Miller (served 1976–1981) and Stafford J. Sweeting. The current archbishop is George Walter Sands.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nEducational Facilities\n\nEndich Theological Seminary, New York, New York.\n\nSources\n\nAfrican Orthodox Church Inc. www.netministries.org/see/churches.exe/ch26904.\n\nBurkett, Randall K.

Carpatho-Russia had been forcefully converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to the Roman Catholic Ruthenian Rite by a series of rulers who basically followed the Latin Rite. Once the church was established in the United States, a process of further latinizing the Ruthenian Rite parishes began. Among other things, attempts were made to curtail the assignment of married priests to American parishes.\n\nAs early as 1891, a Carpatho-Russian Catholic parish sought to return to Eastern Orthodoxy. It was soon joined by others. Then in 1936, approximately 40 parishes that had left Roman jurisdiction organized and selected Orestes P. Chornock (1883–1977) as their leader. The next year they designated him their bishop-elect and turned to the ecumenical patriarch in Constantinople for recognition. In 1938 the patriarch consecrated Chornock and authorized the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese as an independent body. In 1966 the patriarch elevated Chornock to the dignity of a metropolitan. The present ruling bishop is Metropolitan Nicholas Smisko.\n\nThe American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church is an independent autonomous body directly under the authority of the ecumenical patriarch. It has a working relationship with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, whose archbishop is the exarch of the patriarch. The archbishop intercedes when the appointment of a new bishop is requested by the church and has the task of consecrating him. The church is at one with Eastern Orthodox faith and practice, though its liturgy still retains a few minor peculiarities reflective of its Roman Catholic history. The church is a member of the Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008 the church reported 82 parishes being served by 132 priests.\n\nEducational Facilities\n\nChrist the Savior Seminary, Johnstown, Pennsylvania.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nCerkovny Vistnik–Church Messenger. • A.C.R.Y.

Refusing to accept this innovation, hundreds of thousands of the faithful walled themselves off from communion with the state (new calendar) church, in the hope that they might thereby exert pressure on the hierarchy to restore the traditional calendar.\n\nOne issue that has divided the movement since its separation from the state church is whether any saving Grace (i.e., the efficacious Mysteries) remains in the Church of Greece. The Old Calendarists under Metropolitan Cyprian are the only group acknowledging that such Grace does exist in the state church, in spite of the fact that, in their view, this church has seriously compromised its integrity by actively participating in what the Old Calendarists see as relativistic excesses that characterize much of the contemporary ecumenical movement.\n\nThe monastery founded and headed by Metropolitan Cyprian had originally belonged to the state church, but returned to the Julian Calendar in 1967 and broke communion with the New Calendar church two years later, accepting the authority of the Old Calendarist hierarchy. Metropolitan Cyprian was consecrated to episcopacy in 1979. The Old Calendar movement in Greece was disrupted in the early 1980s, and the various factions reorganized themselves into independent groups. The more moderate groups accepted Metropolitan Cyprian as their leader. The synod of bishops under Metropolitan Cyprian, the Holy Synod in Resistance, hopes for a future reunion with the state church, viewing a return on the part of the latter to the Julian Calendar and a decisive withdrawal from the ecumenical movement as necessary conditions for the restoration of ecclesiastical communion.\n\nThe Church is organized into five dioceses: two in Greece, two in Italy, and the diocese of Etna, which includes the parishes and monastic centers in North America. Along with the parishes, there is one monastery and one convent in Etna, California, and one convent in Bluffton, Alberta, Canada.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008, the Diocese of Etna reported 11 parishes in the United States and 2 in Canada.\n\nEducational Facilities\n\nCenter for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, Etna, California.\n\nPeriodical\n\nOrthodox Tradition.\n\nSources\n\nOrthodox Church of Greece, Holy Synod in Resistance. www.synodinresistance.org/.\n\nChrysostomos, Archimandrite, with Hieromonk Ambrosios and Hieromonk Auxentios.

Steven A. Kochones (b. 1931). Kochones was raised as a member of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, but left the jurisdiction as a young man. In 1956 he was ordained as a minister in the Independent Assemblies of God, a Protestant church of Pentecostal faith, after he had experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit as evidenced by speaking in tongues. After some years as a Pentecostal minister, Kochones was drawn back to his Orthodox heritage and in 1967 accepted ordination as an Orthodox priest by Abp. Walter A. Propheta (1912–1972) of the American Orthodox Catholic Church (Propheta).\n\nIn 1969 he established the Church of God in the Lord Jesus Christ, an independent church in fellowship with the American Orthodox Catholic Church (Propheta). It combined Orthodox faith with Pentecostal piety and some insights from messianic Judaism. Kochones developed a system of seven sacraments and seven sacramentals. The seven sacraments were baptism and confirmation, confession and absolution, Holy Eucharist and Holy Communion, ministry and priesthood, marriage, private and public prayer, and preaching and teaching. The seven sacramentals were bowing or kneeling to pray and praise; singing choruses, hymns, and psalms; clapping or uplifted hands in prayer; dancing and singing in the Holy Spirit; music and drama; making the sign of the cross and smiting the breast; and speaking in tongues, prophecy, and interpretation. The church used Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, in its iconography, and speaks of God as Yahweh. It acknowledged the continuing validity of the Seventh-Day Sabbath, and services are held on both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe church observes the biblical dietary laws as found in Leviticus. Women, otherwise meeting ordination requirements, may be ordained to the priesthood.\n\nIn 1979, following a burglary at the church’s headquarters in Pasadena, California, at which time the corporation papers and seal were stolen, the church’s name was changed (for legal reasons) to the Catholic Church of God. The church’s symbol combined a latin cross, the Star of David, and the Jewish seven-stemmed candelabra. The name chosen also reflected a trend within the church to bring it more in line with the perceptions of the historical and ancient church being made by Kochones. Included in this trend was a new emphasis on apostolic succession, and Kochones began to seek consecration as a bishop. He was consecrated in 1980 by Bp. David Baxter of the Orthodox Church of America.\n\nIn 1989 The Catholic Church of God changed its name to the American Orthodox Catholic Church, though it remains separate from the jurisdiction of the same name of late founded by Archbishop Propheta.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nOrthodox Messenger.\n\nSources\n\nThe Christian Liturgy.

Propheta (1912–1972), a former Ukranian Orthodox priest. In 1964 he was consecrated to the episcopacy by Abp. Peter Zhurawetsky (1901–1994), exarch in the United States for the Greek Patriarchate of Alexandria, assisted by Abp. Joachim Souris, metropolitan primate of the Autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church in America, and Abp. Theodotus DeWitow, metropolitan primate of the Holy Orthodox Church in America. In 1966 he was consecrated as archbishop by Abp. Theoklitos Kantaris of the Old Calendar Greek Orthodox Jurisdiction, Greece, and Archbishop DeWitow.\n\nPropheta continued the task of building an independent and indigenous American Orthodoxy, which had been initiated by his direct predecessor, the Most Rev. Aftimios Ofiesh (1889–1966) of Brooklyn, who in 1927 received canonically and formally from the synod of bishops of the American dioceses of the Russian Orthodox Church the mandate to initiate an American Orthodox Catholic Church. As Archbishop and Patriarch Wolodymir I (as Propheta was ecclesiastically known), he ordained and consecrated a number of clergymen who became part of his jurisdiction. Some of them left the jurisdiction and founded their own autonomous groups, and others were received into different jurisdictions as a result of the struggle for control of the church after Propheta’s death.\n\nAbp. Francis Joseph Ryan (d. 1986), successor to Abp. Propheta and Abp. John A. Christian (d. 1984), was consecrated to the episcopacy in 1969 by Abps. Propheta, Christian, and Uladislau Ryzy-Rysky. His successor was Abp. Jeremiah, (David William Worley), consecrated to the episcopacy in 1972 by Abps. LaVon Miguel Haithman (Gabre Kristos Mikael), Francis Ryan, Jamed Edward Burns, and Anthony Everhart.\n\nArchbishop Samuel, the current patriarch of yhe American Orthodox Catholic Church, was consecrated to the episcopacy in 2004 by Archbishop Jeremiah. The American Orthodox Catholic Church Holy Synod in 2005 ratified and approved this appointment and confirmed him as patriarch of the church.\n\nThe American Orthodox Catholic Church is Orthodox in doctrine and follows the decrees of the Seven Ecumenical Councils. It adheres to the Nicene Creed and requires only adherence to the traditional Orthodox text. A variety of preschismatic rites are allowed, though the Eastern, or Byzantine, is most frequently used.\n\nThe church follows an episcopal polity and is governed by the patriarch and the Holy Synod.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008 the church reported congregations and more than 100 monastics in the United States, Africa, and Great Britain.

Walter A. Propheta of the American Orthodox Catholic Church as the Bishop of Laconia, New Hampshire and the New England States. During this period he also met Abp. Peter A. Zhurawetsky (1901–1994) of the Old Orthodox Catholic Patriarchate of America, who on November 4, 1967, in the presence of a congregation of four, elevated him to the status of Archbishop. Without leaving Propheta’s jurisdiction, Ryzy-Ryski began to create archbishops-patriarchs for each national/ethnic group and—quite apart from any laity demanding leadership—to build a hierarchy which he envisioned as international in scope. The World Patriarchate was very loosely structured, and established in large part by the elevation to patriarchal status of other independent bishops not otherwise required to recognize Ryzy-Ryski’s authority or come under his jurisdiction. In 1972, as one of the last acts before his death, Propheta excommunicated Ryzy-Ryski from the American Orthodox Catholic Church, an action that merely spurred the growth of the American World Patriarchates, who established patriarchs for Canada, Hungary, Germany, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Haiti, Santo Domingo, Brazil, Peru, Argentina, El Salvador, Nigeria, the West Indies, Norway, Sweden, Formosa, and the Ukraine. Only rarely were new congregations established as a result of a patriarch being named. Occasionally, the new patriarch could claim a small following.\n\nIn connection with the American World Patriarchates, Ryzy-Ryski organized the Peoples University of the Americas, an educational center designed to meet the needs of various ethnic and immigrant groups in the Bronx, New York. A well-educated man, with a good academic background, he led a faculty that offered a wide variety of courses in the humanities, and especially in English as a second language. The school also provided the World Patriarchates with a seminary.\n\nSince the death of Patriarch Uladyslau Ryzy-Ryski in 1978, the work has continued under his brother, Abp. Emigidius J. Ryzy, who holds the title of Apostolic Administrator of All American World Patriarchates. He is assisted by Abp. Adam Bilecky, Patriarch II of the American World Patriarchate, Abp. Frank Barquera, and Bp. Piot Huszoza.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 1997, the church reported 19,457 members, 17 congregations, and 54 priests in the United States. There were also one congregation and three priests in Canada. Affiliated work was to be found in 17 foreign countries. The newest work was in Ryzy-Ryski homeland, Belarus.

In 1904 the first Orthodox bishop ever consecrated in North America, Archimandrite Raphael Hawaweeny (1860–1915), became the bishop of the Syrian Mission of the Russian Orthodox Church. Metropolitan Germanos came to the United States in 1914 and began organizing Syrian churches. These two efforts paralleled each other until 1925, when an independent church was created. In 1936 Archimandrite Anthony Bashir (1898–1966) was elected and consecrated bishop by the American Syrian churches. He became metropolitan of New York and all North America in 1940 and provided leadership for 30 years.\n\nIn the 1936 election, in which Bashir was elected to the bishopric, Archimandrite Samuel David of Toledo, Ohio, polled the second-highest number of votes. On the same day that Archbishop Bashir was consecrated in New York, Russian bishops consecrated Samuel David as archbishop of Toledo. Abp. Samuel David was condemned and excommunicated in 1938 but then recognized the following year. The Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Toledo, Ohio, and Dependencies that he led existed as a separate body until 1975.\n\nIn 1966 the Mt. Rev. Philip Saliba succeeded Bashir and became primate of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of New York and All North America. Archbishop Philip was a leader in promoting the use of English in the liturgy. He gave priority to missions and emphasized the cause of Orthodox unity in North America and abroad.\n\nIn 1958 Archbishop David died, and hope for reunion of the two Antiochian churches emerged. Abp. Michael Shaheen succeeded Archbishop Samuel and conducted talks toward union, which were finally consummated in 1975. The new Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America selected Archbishop Philip as head of the church with the title of metropolitan. There are four auxiliary bishops: Bishop Antoun, Bishop Joseph, Bishop Basil, and Bishop Demetri.\n\nIn February 1987 the former Evangelical Orthodox Church (EOC) was received as a body into the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, thus ending for its members a pilgrimage that began almost two decades earlier. The Evangelical Orthodox Church had its roots in the late 1960s, when a number of the staff of Campus Crusade for Christ left their positions. Some launched independent ministries; some affiliated with various independent evangelical churches. In the early 1970s several of these leaders—Peter Gillquist, John Braun, Dick Ballew, Ken Berven, and Jack Sparks—banded together as the New Covenant Apostolic Order (NCAO).\n\nThe formation of the NCAO afforded a context for study that led to a concentrated reappraisal of a common view of Evangelical Protestant Christians, that the first-century church had become corrupted over the centuries until restored by Evangelicals in relatively modern times. Gathering in Chicago in 1979, the leaders of the movement announced the formation of the Evangelical Orthodox Church to supercede the NCAO and to call Evangelicals back to their historic roots. Special emphasis was placed on ritual, a subject largely neglected in Evangelical circles. The new church immediately turned its attention to a search for valid Orthodox episcopal orders. Initial talks were held with the Orthodox Church in America. Although a major obstacle was overcome when the leaders of the EOC professed their belief in the Blessed Virgin Mary as theotokos, the Mother of God, the talks eventually reached a stalemate. Finally, the EOC was able to work out an arrangement with the Antiochian Church by which the leaders dropped their designation as bishops and were reordained by Archbishop Philip.\n\nOver the years the leaders of the EOC have written a number of books that received wide circulation within Evangelical circles. Most of these were published by Thomas Nelson, where Gillquist worked as an editor, and included Gillquist’s Why We Haven’t Changed the World and It Ain’t Gonna Reign No More by Jon Braun. Most notable among them was The Mindbenders, by Jack Sparks, an anticult book that led to a lawsuit for libel by the Local Church, one of the groups treated in the volume, and its eventual withdrawal by the publishers.\n\nIn October 2003, the Holy Synod of the Antiochian Orthodox Church allowed the Archdiocese to proceed under autonomous rule in an effort for more efficient self-government, internal organization, and effective outreach ministries.\n\nOn July 28, 2005, the Archdiocese voted unanimously to withdraw its membership from the National Council of Churches (NCC), becoming the first Orthodox jurisdiction to leave the NCC. The Archdiocese cited the increased politicization of the NCC and irrelevancy of its relationship as the main reasons for the withdrawal.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2002 the archdiocese reported 240 parishes and missions, 350,000 members, and 400 priests and deacons.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nThe Word. 1777 Quigg Dr., Pittsburgh, PA 15241-2071. • Again.

Zeiger as its Archbishop of Denver and Primate. He was consecrated in 1961 by Archbishop Peter A. Zhurawetsky (1901–1994) as an Orthodox bishop for Westerners.\n\nThe Anglican Church of the Americas was founded by Gordon A. Da Costa (d. 1991) in Indiana in 1971. In 1976 a synod was held at Marion, Indiana, at which Da Costa and others became members of the American Orthodox Catholic Church. At that time, the American Orthodox Catholic Church, in order to avoid confusion with Archbishop Walter A. Propheta’s church in New York, took an alternative official name, the Apostolic Catholic Church of the Americas, which became its most commonly used designation.\n\nDa Costa was elected Archbishop Primate of the Apostolic Catholic Church of the Americas. Zeiger, who had resigned as head, was elected chancellor. There was no actual merger of the American Orthodox Catholic Church and the Anglican Church of the Americas. However, Da Costa continued parallel activities as head of the Anglican Church of the Americas for some time in order to carry out responsibilities for those of his clergy who wished to continue as members of that church.\n\nIn 1977 Zeiger resigned and submitted to the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church. As a condition for union with Rome, he was required to agree not to exercise his office as bishop or priest. In 1981 Zeiger returned to Orthodoxy. At that time, he became a cofounder of the Holy Synod of Denver in 1984. This venture floundered after a dispute in 1986. At that time, Zeiger returned to the Apostolic Catholic Church of the Americas as Archbishop ad personam of Lakewood, Colorado. Zeiger has since been arrested twice in connection with pro-life activities.\n\nArchbishop C. F. Quinn of Dallas, Texas, was elected Archbishop Primate Coadjutor with the right of succession to Da Costa in 1986. Quinn succeeded as primate in 1988, when Da Costa could no longer serve. Quinn continued as Archbishop Primate after Da Costa’s death.\n\nThe Apostolic Catholic Church of the Americas employs Western liturgy, accepts as the rule of faith the Sacred Scriptures and Divine Tradition as expressed in the writings of the church Fathers and the dogmatic degrees of the Seven Ecumenical Councils. The church makes clerical celibacy optional, even for bishops. It rejects females as candidates for the priesthood. Church property is held in lay trusteeship. The church is in the Apostolic succession; Catholic, not Protestant; Orthodox, not Roman; and American, not a foreign mission.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nThe Door.

Ingram and Charles Ingram, both former bishops in the Western Orthodox Church in America (WOCA). Richard J. Ingram had been consecrated on June 17, 1984, by Charles David Luther, assisted by Bps. Peter Brennan and Alan Maxwell Bain. He was also consecrated sub conditione in 1988 by Bp. Luis Fernando Castillo-Mendez, assisted by several of his fellow bishops in the Igreja Catolica Apostolica Brasileira, Josivaldo Pereira de Oliveira, Galvao Barros, and Walbert Rommel Coelho. Richard Ingram consecrated Charles Ingram on September 10, 1989; before the end of the month, both had resigned from the WOCA. The Apostolic Orthodox Catholic Church is like its parent body in faith and practice, the differences leading to its founding being primarily administrative.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nAssociation of Occidental Orthodox Parishes\n\nCurrent address not obtained for this edition.\n\nThe use of the Western Rite in Orthodox Churches experienced a revival during the twentieth century as Eastern Orthodoxy flourished in the West. It has a long history, though little noticed because of the predominance of the Roman Rite. Some held the view, verified by such examples as the Western Rite Vicariate within the Antiochian Orthodox Church, that Western Rite parishes do not remain Western within a predominantly Eastern Rite church body. The Orthodox Church of France is a Western Rite diocese founded in 1953 by Fr. Evgraph Kovalevsky (1905–1970) and several other priests who withdrew from the Russian Orthodox Church. As priests in Lithuania they had followed a Western Rite, and Father Kovalevsky had pastored a Western Rite parish opened in 1944 in Paris. That parish became the source of several others.\n\nAfter leaving the Russian Orthodox Church, the priests and their parishes affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. Bishop John Maximovitch (1896–1966) ordained several new Western Rite priests and saw to the publication of the liturgy, the old Gallican Rite according to Saint Germain, Bishop of Paris (555–576), not to be confused with the eighteenth-century occultist of the same name. The death of Bishop John led to a break with the Russian Church, and, as relations worsened, Kovalevsky, who had been consecrated in 1964, led his followers in forming an autonomous diocese. But he died in 1970 without having a successor consecrated. Finally, in 1972, the Patriarch of Romania agreed to consecrate Pere Gilles Hardy as the new bishop of the Orthodox Catholic Church of France. He was known as Bishop Germain. The Western Rite was reintroduced to America by Fr. Stephen Empson, who founded a parish in New York City. In 1981 he organized the Association of Occidental Orthodox Parishes to further promote Western Rite Orthodoxy.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nUnofficial: Axios. 800 S Euclid St., Fullerton, CA 92632.\n\nAutocephalous Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church\n\nCurrent address not obtained for this edition.\n\nThe Autocephalous Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church is an independent Orthodox jurisdiction founded by Mt.

During the Soviet era the region was called Byelorussia. A national church, called the Metropolia of Kiev, under Greek jurisdiction, was established in Belarus in 1291. At that time the city of Kiev was under the authority of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Subsequent elected church heads, or Metropolitans, were Belarusans.\n\nThe church eventually came under the control of the Moscow head of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1922 the Bishop of Miensk, Metropolitan Melchizedeck, called a council of clergy and laity under his leadership, and attempted to organize a Belarusans Church independent of Moscow. This action was met with the furious disapproval of both the communist government and the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church. Over time the government arrested all the pro-Belarusan leaders, bishops, priests, and laity and sent them to Siberia; the church reverted to its dependent status. During the German occupation of Belarus in 1942, the church again attempted to organize independently, but this effort ended with the defeat of the German forces.\n\nThe Belarusan Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which emerged among refugee Belarusans in Germany after the war, is one of two Orthodox groups serving Belarusan immigrants. Their own bishops had turned to the Russian Church, while the clergy and laity followed the Ukrainian Church. Metropolitan Palikarp not only blessed the reorganization of the church among the Belarusans, but in 1948 granted permission for one of his bishops, Siarhej, to leave his jurisdiction and join the new church. In 1949, accompanied by his former Ukrainian colleagues, Siarhej consecrated a second bishop for the church, Bishop Vasil. As the church spread among immigrants worldwide, two more bishops, Andrej (Alexander Kryt) and Mikalay (Michael Macukievic) were consecrated in 1948.\n\nArchbishop Mikalay was elected primate of the church in 1984, serving until his death in 2007. He was succeeded by Metropolitan Iziaslau (b. 1926).\n\nPeriodicals\n\nCarkouny Paslaniec (Church Messenger), the quarterly bulletin of the Parish Council of St. Cyril’s of Turau Cathedral.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2007 the church reported four parishes in the United States, two in Canada, three in the United Kingdom, and two in Australia.\n\nBulgarian Eastern Orthodox Church (Diocese of North and South America)\n\n519 Brynhaven Dr., Oregon, OH 43616\n\nThe reestablishment of relations between the Orthodox Church in Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Church (Diocese of North and South America and Australia) and the resultant manifestation of that accord in the joint visitation of North American parishes in 1963 by Bishop Andrey Velichky (d. 1972), metropolitan of the American church, and Bishop Preiman, metropolitan of Nevrokop, Bulgaria, led to major protests throughout the Church. Bishop Andrey was accused of violating the declaration made in 1947 that the Bulgarian Church in America would not accept any orders from the Church in Bulgaria. In March 1963 protesting leaders representing 18 churches and missions met in Detroit, Michigan, and reconstituted themselves as the Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Church (Diocese of the United States of America and Canada) and elected Archimandrite Kyrill Yonchev (1927–2007) as their bishop.\n\nThey turned to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia for support. The Russians, also cut off from their homeland by a hostile communist regime, gave the new Bulgarian jurisdiction their canonical protection, and their bishops consecrated bishop-elect Yonchev in 1964 at their monastery in Jordanville, New York.\n\nThe Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Church differs from its parent body only in matters of administration. It lays claim to all properties belonging to the undivided Church in America though it has not been able to take control of them. It was staunchly anti-Communist during the Soviet era.\n\nMembership\n\nIn the mid-1970s the church reported 21 parishes and missions.\n\nBulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocese of the USA, Canada, and Australia\n\n550-A W 50th St., New York, NY 10019\n\nBulgarians arrived in the United States throughout the nineteenth century and by 1907 were numerous enough to begin establishing congregations. The first parish was formed in Madison, Illinois. Soon, the Holy Synod in Sofia established a mission to oversee their American members. In 1937 a diocese was created, and Bishop Andrey Velichky (d. 1972) came from Bulgaria as its head. Bishop Andrey returned to Bulgaria during World War II and worked on various projects, among which was the handling of negotiations between the ecumenical patriarch in Istanbul and the Bulgarian patriarch, which helped repair a 70-year-old broken relationship.\n\nSoon after the war ended, Archbishop Andrey returned to America. In 1947 he incorporated the Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocese of the USA, Canada, and Australia. The constitutional assembly meeting in March of that year realigned its relationship to the Church in Bulgaria by declaring that while it saw itself as part of the whole of Bulgarian Orthodoxy, it could not accept orders from the church leaders in Sofia as long as a Communist regime ruled their homeland. They then proceeded to formally elect Andrey as their leader. The Holy Synod reacted by declaring the election null and void. The American diocese ignored the Synod, and for the next 15 years the diocese operated independently of the church leaders in Sofia. In 1962 the church in Bulgaria recognized the Metropolia and reestablished a working relationship. In 1969 the jurisdiction was divided into two dioceses, and in 1972 Bp. Joseph Znepolski succeeded Archbishop Andrey as Metropolitan. In 1989, the year the communist government fell in Bulgaria, the two dioceses were again merged into one under Metropolitan Joseph.\n\nThe Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocese follows standard Orthodox faith and practice. It is a member of the Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008 the diocese reported 22 parishes in the United States, 4 in Canada, and 3 in Australia.\n\nSources\n\nBulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocese of the USA, Canada, and Australia. www.bulgariandiocese.org/.\n\nByelorussian Orthodox Church\n\nCurrent address not obtained for this edition.\n\nWhen refugees and immigrants from Byelorussia came to the west after World War II, some organized as the Byelorussian Autonomous Orthodox Church and elected their own bishops. Others formed independent congregations and sought the canonical blessings of other Orthodox bishops. The Byelorussian Orthodox Church consists of three congregations that placed themselves under the jurisdiction of Archbishop Iakovos, head of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, in his role as exarch in America for the ecumenical patriarch. Besides the congregation in South River, New Jersey, parishes are found in Chicago and Toronto.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nThe Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. (Independent Jurisdiction)\n\n19818 Hart St., Winnetka, CA 91306\n\nThe Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc., assumed its present form in 1984 through a merger of the Byzantine Old Catholic Church (BOCC), Inc., and the Holy Orthodox Catholic Church, Eastern and Apostolic (HOCCEA). The BOCC, originally an Old Catholic jurisdiction and now an Orthodox Catholic jurisdiction, has a history that is intimately tied to the career of its leader, Mar Markus I, who was elected patriarch in 1967.\n\nMar Markus I was born Mark I. Miller in 1927. In the early 1960s, he joined the North American Orthodox Catholic Church, in which he was ordained in 1964 after completing his seminary training. Miller was consecrated by Christopher Maria Stanley (1902–1976), who was assisted by Bp. John Joseph Frewen, in Kentucky in 1965. The church itself was incorporated in 1964.\n\nIn 1966, in an attempt to engender an expansion of the church, Stanley commissioned Miller to work with the Orthodox Old Catholic Church headed by Bp. Claude Hamel (b. 1935), but Miller’s objections to aspects of Hamel’s leadership led to a myriad of problems. Thus, after Stanley fell ill and died, Miller separated his work from Hamel and changed the name of the jurisdiction to the Orthodox Old Roman Catholic Church II, to try to salvage some of the work for expansion in 1967. Miller then moved to Los Angeles, California, and in 1967 the synod of bishops unanimously elected him to succeed Stanley as patriarch, naming him Mar Markus I.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Mar Markus reorganized the church and changed the name back to the North American Orthodox Catholic Church, as it was called when he was originally consecrated. During this period he was moving both theologically and liturgically away from the Old Catholicism toward Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nIn 1981 the church reorganized again, the result being the formation of the Byzantine Old Catholic Church, Inc. The reorganization occurred during a period of great flux in the congregations. After the new church was formed, Mar Apriam I (Abp. Richard B. Morrill, d. 1994), who headed the Holy Orthodox Catholic Church, Eastern and Apostolic (HOCCEA), joined with Abp. Mar Markus in the formation of a Sacred Synod of Bishops. Mar Apriam became president of the synod and Mar Markus became vice president of the synod and chief justice of the Spiritual Court of Bishops, in addition to maintaining his own jurisdiction.\n\nA further merger in mid-1984 united the BOCC and the HOCCEA and led to the formation of the Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. However, before the year was out, Morrill withdrew with approval and reconstituted the HOCCEA. Mar Markus remained as head of the Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc., which came into full communion with the reconstituted HOCCEA, their differences being purely administrative.\n\nThe possible merger of Morrill’s jurisdiction with the Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. was again raised and in 1991 a synod was called with that idea on the agenda. However, before it could meet, Mar Apriam died. When the synod did meet, it agreed to unite the various segments of the church previously under Mar Apriam under Mar Markus.\n\nBELIEFS\n\nThe Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. is Orthodox Catholic in faith and practice. It celebrates the Liturgies of St. John Chrysostom and St. Basil in the vernacular of its various jurisdictions. The church also has a growing Western Rite vicariate that is Orthodox Catholic in creed and tridentine in liturgical practice.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 1997 the patriarchate reported over 500 congregations worldwide. Affiliated congregations are spread throughout the United States. Outside the United States, affiliated congregations are found in Great Britain, France, Italy, Congo, Nigeria, Liberia, Haiti, and South America and together have a reported membership of over 100,000.\n\nEducational Facilities\n\nSt. John’s Theological Seminary, Los Angeles, California.\n\nL’Institute Orthodoxe Ecumenique de St. Jean Chrysostome, Port au Prince, Haiti.\n\nByzantine Orthodox Catholic Church (Armstrong)\n\nCurrent address not obtained for this edition.\n\nThe Byzantine Orthodox Catholic Church is a small Orthodox jurisdiction founded in the 1980s by Bp.

The Catholic Apostolic Church in Brazil was formed in 1946 by Dom Carlos Duarte Costa (1888–1961), a former bishop of the Roman Catholic Church who had been excommunicated by Pope Pius XII because of his criticism of the church during World War II. Among those whom Costa consecrated was Dom Luis F. Castillo-Mendez, who succeeded him as patriarch of the church in 1949. Corradi-Scarella was consecrated by Mendez in 1949 and established the church as an exarchate with headquarters in New Mexico. During the 1960s, following the death of Costa, Corradi-Scarella lost touch with the Brazilian group and began to associate with the various Old Catholics in the United States. By 1970 he called his jurisdiction the Diocese of the Old Catholic Church in America.\n\nThe church grew slowly until the 1970s. In 1973 Corradi-Scarella was joined by Francis Jerome Joachim (1928–1997), a priest ordained by Abp. Bartholomew Cunningham of the Holy Orthodox Church, Diocese of New Mexico. Joachim brought an Eastern Orthodox perspective with him, in contrast to Corradi-Scarella’s Catholic tradition, but soon became Corradi-Scarella’s chief associate. Corradi-Scarella arranged for Joachim’s consecration by Abp. David M. Johnson of the American Orthodox Church, Diocese of California, on September 28, 1974. Two months later, on December 1, 1974, Corradi-Scarella, then almost 70 years old, resigned in favor of Joachim.\n\nUnder Joachim the small jurisdiction grew, at one point having almost 100 clergy, but over time it lost significant strength due to the defections of many to other independent jurisdictions. In 1980 Joachim renamed his jurisdiction the Western Orthodox Church in America. At the request of Mendez, Joachim changed the name of the church back to the Catholic Apostolic Church of North America. In 1985 Joachim was named primate of all North America and the church was recognized as the Autocephalous Catholic Apostolic Church in Brazil in North America.\n\nThe church believes in the Nicene Creed, the Apostle’s Creed, and the Athanasian Creed and practices sacraments such as the Eucharist, baptism, matrimony, and anointing of the sick. Membership is open to anyone who wishes to join and the church makes a point of reaching out to individuals who may not feel welcome elsewhere. The church recognizes the pope as the bishop of Rome but not as the supreme leader of Catholics throughout the world.\n\nThe church is currently led by Abp. Rev. Anthony Santore, who succeeded Mt. Rev. Willard E. Schultz, the presiding bishop emeritus and now the church’s historian. Bishop Santore is also assisted by Bps. Francisco Betancourt and Carl Purvenas-Smith.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008 the church reported 10 parishes in the United States.\n\nEducational Facilities\n\nSt. John Chrysostom Theological Seminary, San Francisco, California.\n\nSt. Charles Academy of Theology, San Francisco, California.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nJournal Apostolica.\n\nSources\n\nCatholic Apostolic Church in North America. www.cacina.org/home.php?flag=1.\n\nCeltic Orthodox Christian Church\n\nc/o Deaconess Elizabeth, Cele De, Box 72102, Akron, OH 44372\n\nThe Celtic Orthodox Christian Church, founded in the 1990s, is one product of the revival of interest in Celtic religious life, especially in the Christian community toward the end of the twentieth century. The church sees itself as continuing the faith and practice of the Christian Church in the West prior to 1000 and traces its history to Saint Irenaeus of Lyon (c.115–c. 202 c.e.), who resided in Gaul (modern France). Irenaeus was a student and disciple of Polycarp of Smyrna, and St. Polycarp was reputedly a student of the Apostle John. The church uses the Liturgy of the Lorrha “Stowe” Missal in its worship, the only surviving Celtic liturgy. It is also the only surviving Eucharistic liturgy according to the form used by churches of the British Isles, France, Germany, Switzerland, and northern Italy prior to 900 c.e.\n\nCeltic churches were largely replaced by the Roman Catholic (Latin-Rite) by 1172. The suppression of the Celtic church began in England during the seventh century and was continued by Charlemagne in the ninth century. Suppression followed in Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The last stronghold, Ireland, gave way in the twelfth century following the synod of Cashel in 1172. The suppression meant that no line of apostolic succession through Celtic bishops survived into the modern era. The revived church received its apostolic succession through independent bishops representing the lineage of the Antiochian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nIn using the term Orthodox, the Church does not, however, identify with Eastern Orthodoxy; rather, the term Celtic Orthodox is interpreted to mean that the church is committed to the belief and practice of the undivided church (which split into Roman and Eastern in the eleventh century). That belief and practice is believed to have been held by the saints of the Celtic churches, whose writings are especially valued.\n\nThe church follows the belief promulgated by the seven ecumenical councils. It stands apart from both Eastern Orthodoxy and the Roman Catholic Church in its understanding of original sin that is expressed in its understanding of Mary, Jesus’ mother. It uses the term Theotekos (Birthgiver of God), and understands that Mary was free from both the stain of a sinful life and the guilt inherited from Adam. In that respect, she is like all people. Original guilt is seen as an error attributed to St. Augustine (354–430 c.e.). The idea of original guilt requires the further error of the Immaculate Conception, which posits Mary’s freedom from the stain of original guilt. In contrast, the Celtic Church teaches that although original sin is a deficiency that causes individuals to tend toward sin, it does not impart guilt nor does it cut people off from God’s grace. Guilt follows from sin committed by an individual.\n\nThe church does not admit women to the priesthood; however, it offers females the opportunity in the ordered religious life as a Celi De (or Culdee), a Companion or Servant of God. The Celi De serve through prayer, teaching, and/or service. They may be male or female, married or monastic. Contemporary Celi De look to St. Maelruain, who in 755 c.e. established a monastery at Tallaght. The writings of that monastery have survived, including the Rule of St. Maelruain.\n\nThe church is currently led by Abbot-Bishop Maelruain, Cele De, Metropolitan and Archbishop of Armagh. He is assisted by Bishop Timothy, Cele De, of Nashville and Glasgow, and Bishop Photius, Cara Cele De, of Iona.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008 the church reported two parishes in Akron, with a third forming in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nCeltic Orthodox Christian Quarterly.\n\nSources\n\nCeltic Orthodox Christian Church. www.celticchristianity.org/.\n\nCeltic Rite Orthodox Diocese\n\nc/o The Order of the Servants of Jesus, PO Box 350, Clarkdale, GA 30020\n\nThe Celtic Rite Orthodox Diocese is a rite of the Holy Orthodox Catholic Church that wishes to bring the strength of Celtic spiritual expression into the twenty-first century. The diocese considers itself Christian, Orthodox, and Celtic—that is, Christian in love and mission; Orthodox in theology, beliefs, and practices; and Celtic in the expression of spirituality and heritage. The diocese uses the vernacular in worship and freely experiments with an array of ancient and modern music. The Order of the Servants of Jesus is a small ordered community affiliated with the diocese. The church is a member of the International Federation of Orthodox Catholics United Sacramentally (FOCUS).\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nSources\n\nPruter, Karl.

Kersey into a family who were members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, as a young man the future bishop began a spiritual search that led him to become a Baptist pastor. From there he became influenced by Pentecostalism, especially its teachings on the baptism of the Holy Spirit and modern activity of the gifts of the spirit (as mentioned by the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians 12). He also was led to Eastern orthodoxy by his study of church history, but found that no church accepted both his belief in charismatic gifts and Orthodoxy.\n\nAfter receiving consecration as a bishop in a lineage of apostolic succession, Bishop Symeon John I founded the Charismatic Orthodox Church in 1998. The new church attempts to continue the Eastern orthodox tradition while being thoroughly charismatic. It affirms the Nicene and Apostles’Creed. It is Eastern in theology and spiritual focus while allowing both Eastern and Western practice, including worship formats. It attempts to blend three streams of what some call the Convergence Movement, meaning that it is orthodox (faith), charismatic/liturgical (in style), and evangelical (practice). Women may serve as deacons (evangelists, prophets, and teachers), but not as priests or bishops.\n\nThe church has its primary presence on the Internet, and its bishops travel around the United States to oversee the needs of the scattered faithful. The Transformation Theological and Rabbinical Institute, the church’s training school, operates primarily by correspondence through e-mail.

The church operated on a territorial basis from the old patriarchates at Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Constantinople (now Istanbul). Over the centuries, each of these churches assumed jurisdiction in different territories and relinquished territories as new autonomous national churches and patriarchates were created. In the twentieth century, with the massive movements of people, the lines between jurisdictions blurred.\n\nIn 1850 the Church of Greece was granted autonomy, and the Ecumenical Patriarchate relinquished jurisdiction over most of the country. However, he retained jurisdiction over the Americas. Thus the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, to which most Americans who are Greek Orthodox belong, is affiliated with the Ecumenical Patriarchate. However, Greek immigrants in the twentieth century who wished to remain attached to the Church of Greece organized a diocese in America. It is at one in faith and belief with all of Orthodoxy, but administratively separate.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nSources\n\nChurch of Greece. www.ecclesia.gr.\n\nOrthodoxy.

One such tradition is the church calendar, used by the church from the beginning of its history.\n\nOn March 10, 1924, supported by the revolutionary military government, the state church of Greece replaced the Old (Julian) calendar with the New papal (Gregorian) calendar. This change was implemented without the consensus of the whole church, and against prior consensus of the church reached in 1583, 1587, and 1593, at the Pan-Orthodox Synods, which forbade, condemned, and anathematized any change to the church calendar. However, the calendar change was mandated by a 1920 Encyclical of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, as a first step toward the ecumenical communion of all Christian denominations and the amalgamated unification of Orthodoxy and, in the church’s view, all the heresies.\n\nBecause of this change, the new-calendar state church of Greece became schismatic and cut itself off from the Orthodox Church. The Greek Orthodox who respectfully abided by the historical church decisions regarding the calendar, and whose conscience militated against the schismatic innovation, refused all communion with the state church. In 1935 they gained episcopal oversight when three Church of Greece bishops accepted the Orthodox Confession of Faith. The three bishops quickly ordained four new bishops, among whom was Bishop Matthew of Vrestheni. However, within a few months a significant difference of opinion arose among the Old Calendar bishops concerning the status of the state church. Metropolitan Chrysostomos released a statement saying that, by adopting the Gregorian Calendar, the state church was in a position of potential schism and that, if no other heretical moves were made, it retained the grace of the Holy Spirit and valid sacraments.\n\nBishop Matthew steadfastly rejected Metropolitan Chrysostomos’s position and cut the latter off from the main body of the Old Calendarists. He argued that the Church of Greece was in schism and that grace was no longer present in its sacraments. In 1948, two years before his death, Bishop Matthew consecrated four more bishops. The other Old Calendar factions did not recognize these consecrations, arguing that it takes more than one bishop to perform the ceremony. Nevertheless, Metropolitan Chrysostomos, who had three more bishops on his side, refused to ordain new bishops and left no successors when he died in 1955; this was seen as proof that he recognized the state church as orthodox. Moreover, two of the bishops aligned with him entered into full communion with the state church.\n\nIn 1971 Bishop Matthew’s successors attempted to unite with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, on the basis of an Orthodox confession of faith, but their communion broke down when the latter violated this confession. The issue of the position of the state church continued to divide the several Old Calendar factions, and even though various bishops of the other Old Calendar groups moved toward the Matthew position, the fragmentation was not overcome.\n\nIn 1995 the Church of the True Orthodox Christians of Greece defrocked Archbishop Andreas and two other bishops because of their views regarding the veneration of icons. The church is currently led by His Beatitude Archbishop Nicholas of Athens and All Greece, and in the United States by the Very Rev. Archpriest Anthony Gavalas, who serves as the Episcopal deputy.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008 the church reported 10 parishes scattered across the United States.\n\nSources\n\nChurch of the Genuine Orthodox Christians in the United States. orthodox-christianity.net/.\n\nChysostomos, Archimandrite, with Hieromonk Ambrosios, and Hieromonk Auxentios.

When the Independent Catholic Church disbanded, the IBCC affiliated with The Holy Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church of North America (THEOCACNA) based in Denver, Colorado, and took its present name. When the Denver jurisdiction also disbanded, the EOCC formed as a new jurisdiction, independent of any other group. Most Rev. George Michael Jachimczyk was named the first bishop.\n\nThe church is at one in faith and practice with the other Eastern Orthodox churches. The founders saw the EOCC as having a special ministry to open a path of spirituality to those disenfranchised from their native (ethnic) churches without losing the tradition embodied in the rites of the church. They tried to incorporate different practices from different churches (including the Roman Catholic) into the liturgical life. The church also adopted the Gregorian calendar (as opposed to the Julian calendar used by the more conservative Orthodox churches).\n\nIn practice, clergy are allowed to marry. The church has instituted a female deaconate. Candidates for the clergy are considered apart from their sexual orientation. However, the church has strict rules concerning anyone accused of molesting a minor. The church is led by its presiding bishop and administered by its board of directors with the presiding bishop serving as president. The church is based in John Paul the Great Eastern Orthodox Catholic Monastery in San Antonio, where the religious order it supports, the Community of Divine Charity, is based. There is also a mission in Miami, Oklahoma.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nSources\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church, North American Synod. www.geocities.com/Athens/Thebes/5793/.\n\nEcumenical Orthodox Christian Church\n\nCurrent address not obtained for this edition.\n\nThe Ecumenical Orthodox Christian Church was founded in 1991 with orders from the Russian and Albanian Orthodox Churches. Its leader is His Beatitude, the Most Blessed Sergius (Quilliams), who is assisted by Bps. Yuri Spaeth Jr. (Florida) and Ignatius Cash (Erie, Pennsylvania). The Ecumenical Orthodox Christian Church is an Old Calendar church adhering to the Julian Calendar in its liturgical practice. It is strictly Orthodox, accepts the teachings of the Seven Ecumenical Councils of the third through seventh centuries, and uses an English translation of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom in its celebrations. As with most Orthodox, it rejects the Filioque addition to the Nicene Creed made by the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe church has separated itself from most independent Roman, Old Catholic, High Anglican, and Orthodox jurisdictions in which it finds unacceptable doctrine and practice. It does not allow Western Rites within the church, and priests must wear the proper vestments, including a hat indicative of their marital status. The church’s Synodical Statutes offer detailed instruction on the proper dress of a priest and furnishing of a sanctuary in which the liturgy is to be celebrated. It rejects the doctrines of papal infallibility, papal supremacy, and purgatory. It also rejects the idea of using unleavened bread in the Eucharist. The church adheres to the idea of Mary as Theotokos (birth giver of God) and affirms Mary’s holy (but not immaculate) conception, her assumption into heaven, and her role as one who can make supplication for the believer, but it rejects the title of Mary as co-redemtrix.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nEducational Facilities\n\nHoly Wisdom Correspondence Seminary, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n\nEcumenical Orthodox Church\n\nCurrent address not obtained for this edition.\n\nThe Ecumenical Orthodox Church is a small jurisdiction founded by Bp.

Primate of the Estonian Orthodox Church Archbishop Alexander fled to Sweden, where he organized the Estonian Orthodox Church in Exile. The church is under the Greek Orthodox Church’s ecumenical patriarch in Constantinople and at one in faith and worship with the Greek Orthodox Church.\n\nIn 1949 the V. Rev. Sergius Samon established the first congregation of the Estonian Church in North America at Los Angeles. Large numbers of Estonians had come to the United States and Canada following World War II. Congregations were subsequently established in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York City. Canadian parishes were established in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal.\n\nEstonians were surprised by the fall of the Soviet Union and the establishment of a free and independent Estonia in 1991. Subsequently the autonomous Estonian Orthodox Church was reestablished and in 1996 the Patriarchate of Constantinople formally acknowledged the autonomous church as being under its jurisdiction. Archbishop John of Finland was named to head the church until a episcopal election could be held. This action led the Moscow Patriarchate to sever relations with the Ecumenical Patriarchate (there still being an Orthodox church in Estonia under the Moscow Patriarchate). The events in Estonia signaled the end of the period of exile for Estonians abroad, though otherwise their lives continued much as in previous decades.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008 there were several thousand Estonians of the Orthodox faith in North America.\n\nEvangelical Apostolic Church of North America\n\nCurrent address not obtained for this edition.\n\nThe Evangelical Apostolic Church of North America, formerly known as the Autocephalous Syro-Chaldean Church of North America, derives from the Ancient Holy Apostolic Catholic Church of the East through the Metropolitan of India, Mar Basilius, who in 1902 consecrated Mar Jacobus (Ulric Vernon Herford) bishop to bring the line to England. In 1952 Mar Georgius (Hugh George de Willmott Newman) was brought into the episcopal lineage by Mar Paulus (William Stanley McBean Knight), successor to Mar Jacobus.\n\nMar Georgius consecrated Charles D. Boltwood (1889–1985) bishop in 1952. In 1959 Bishop Boltwood was elevated to archbishop of the Free Protestant Episcopal Church in England. That same year, Archbishop Boltwood consecrated John Marion Stanley (b. 1923) bishop of Washington State. Bishop Stanley subsequently withdrew from the Free Protestant Episcopal Church and formed the Syro-Chaldean Archdiocese of North America, taking the name of Mar Yokhannan. In 1969 Mar Yokhannan received into the archdiocese Mar Jacobus (James A. Gaines), who had received consecration in the Ukranian Orthodox succession.\n\nThe series of events that led to the formation of this body began at a meeting of the Holy Synod of the Syro-Chaldean Archdiocese, December 13–14, 1974. The synod designated Archpriest Bertram S. Schlossberg as bishop-elect with the task of organizing a Diocese of New York. By that action, Father Schlossberg came under the direct authority of Mar Jacobus, who had received authority from the Archdiocese for the Eastern half of the United States. Together, on April 16, 1976, they incorporated their new work as the Autocephalous Syro-Chaldean Archdiocese of the Eastern United States of America. On October 31, 1976, Mar Jacobus and Mar Yokhannan consecrated Father Uzziah bar Evyon (Schlossberg). In December, the diocese of the Northeast was erected with Mar Uzziah as bishop.\n\nOn April 2, 1977, Mar Yokhannan released Mar Jacobus and Mar Uzziah from “all canonical obedience” and then withdrew from the Syro-Chaldean Archdiocese to join the Patriarchal See Holy Orthodox Catholic Church, Eastern and Apostolic, located in California. Mar Jacobus and Mar Uzziah then recognized all the work within the Eastern Archdiocese and in October 1977 incorporated the Autocephalous Syro-Chaldean Church of North America. Mar Jacobus was archbishop and metropolitan. Mar Uzziah was bishop of the Northeast. Upon his retirement in 1978, Mar Jacobus elevated Mar Uzziah to be metropolitan of North America.\n\nSince 1978 the church has grown slowly, concentrating on proclaiming the Gospel to the unsaved and ministering to the broken and wounded in the spirit of Isaiah 61. The Northeastern Diocese was erected as a mission diocese with the expectation that smaller local dioceses would be carved out of it. The intention was that the church would be organized along small diocesesan lines, each diocese being a city or county. In the years since, the Diocese of Fairfield in Connecticut and the Diocese of Westchester in New York have been created. In addition to New York and New England, the church has work in Florida, a mission parish in the Philippines, and a mission in the Middle East.\n\nIn 1992 the Episcopal Synod agreed to change the name to the Evangelical Apostolic Church of North America. The church follows the Orthodox theology of the Church of the East. It affirms the Bible as the Word of God and both the Apostles’ and Nicene Creeds. It keeps seven sacraments: baptism, confirmation or chrismation, holy communion, reconciliation, annointing for healing, holy matrimony, and holy orders. Its official liturgy is a simplified English-language version of the Liturgy of Mar Addai and Mar Mari, but it allows parishes freedom in their use of the liturgy. Several alternative forms are also authorized. The church is evangelical, believing that all persons need to repent and be converted to Christ; catholic, stressing the historical doctrines, sacraments, and practices of Christianity; and charismatic, emphasizing the ministry of the Holy Spirit. It is strongly opposed to the acceptance of homosexuality and other forms of sexual liberalism that it considers to be a sin. The church stands opposed to the practice of abortion. Women are ordained to the diaconate, but not to the priesthood.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported. In 1991 the church reported 1,000 members.

While the church has remained small, it has persisted. Finland gained independence from Russia in 1919 and a wave of nationalism swept the church. In 1923 the church was given autonomy under the Greek Orthodox Church’s ecumenical patriarch in Constantinople. The following year a non-Russian bishop was named primate. The church is Orthodox in faith and practice and uses the Finnish and Russian languages. The selection of archbishops must be submitted to Constantinople for approval.\n\nIn 1955 the first attempts to call together Orthodox Finns residing in the United States found most already attached to Russian congregations, but a small mission chapel was established in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It was not able to minister to the 1,300 Orthodox Finns and ceased to exist in 1958. In 1962 Fr. Denis Ericson implemented a new plan, which entailed traveling from his home base of Lansing, Michigan, to four worship stations, conducting services in English but preserving Finnish hymns and customs.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nSources\n\nFinnish Orthodox Church. www.ort.fi/en/index.php.\n\nPurmonen, V., ed.

Dr. Melchizedek, the archbishop-metropolitan. Trained as a Roman Catholic, the future archbishop converted to Orthodoxy in 1983. He affiliated with the Holy Orthodox Synod for Diaspora and Hellas, a free Holy Synod which had been organized in Greece in 1950, and began to work within its jurisdiction. He moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1986 and the following year became the pastor of St. Tikhon’s Orthodox Church. He was consecrated in 1993. In 1994 the American work became autocephalous as a step in adjusting to the American situation.\n\nAs a free jurisdiction, the church is not affiliated with either the Church of Greece (or any other national jurisdiction) or any of the ancient patriarchates. Archbishop Melchizedek believes that since society has abandoned patriarchal structures, the church has no scriptural mandate to continue them. It is, however, at one with the Orthodox world in faith and practice and accepts the authority of the Holy Scriptures and the Seven Ecumenical Councils. It recognizes any jurisdiction that teaches and practices the Orthodox faith in nonjudgmental Christian love. Members of the church are encouraged to devote their lives to the service of Christ according to their own life experience.\n\nThe church has some opinions that differ from the main body of Orthodoxy. It accepts the authority of the intertestament books commonly called the Apocrypha. It denies the doctrine of original sin. The church allows bishops to marry. Baptism is by triple immersion in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The church retains the power to pronounce the forgiveness of sin through the sacrament of forgiveness (confession, penance, and counseling). Life is sacramental but focused in holy baptism, crismation, absolution of sins, the Eucharist, holy anointing of the sick, priesthood, and matrimony.\n\nVarious rites have been approved for workshop in the several parishes including the Sarum Rite, the Tridentine Roman Rite, the Liturgy of St. Chrysostomos, the Qurbana, and the Gallican Rite. Worship in the vernacular is recommended but Greek and Latin allowed. Among the structures sponsored by the church is the noncommunal Oblate Order of the Blessed Virgin Theotokos, whose members offer themselves to the life of the Blessed Virgin in the spirit of the Magnificat (Luke 1:46–55). When received, the new member is given a blue robe and matching scapular which is worn on special occasions, though on a day-to-day basis members do not dress in special clothing. They are also assigned an individual obedience, in most cases a specific daily prayer to follow.\n\nThe church has formal communion with the Diocese of Emmaus, Christ Catholic Church International, the Free Orthodox Catholic Church of Germany, and the Holy Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church in North America, and fraternal relations with the Federation of St. Thomas Christian Churches, the Holy Catholic Apostolic Orthodox Church, and the Shekinah Glory Mar Thoma Orthodox Church.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nEducational Facilities\n\nSt. Elias School of Orthodox Theology, Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nThe Pilgrim.\n\nGreek Orthodox Archdiocese of America\n\n8-10 E 79th St., New York, NY 10021\n\nAs early as 1767 Greek Orthodox Christians settled in New Smyrna, Florida. Greek merchants in New Orleans established Holy Trinity, the first Greek Orthodox Church in America, in 1864. Other parishes sprang up across the country. No attempt was made to organize the parishes until 1918 when the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, as it was initially named, was organized. Archbishop Alexandros headed the archdiocese from 1922. He began the extensive work of bringing the many Greek parishes under his jurisdiction. The greatest progress in this direction was made by his successor, Metropolitan Athenagoras Spirou (1886–1972), who became the ecumenical patriarch in 1948.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Archdiocese has over the years become the largest in the United States. It has ten districts, each headed by a bishop. Archbishop Iakovos (1911–2005), as chairman of the Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops and exarch for the ecumenical patriarch, was a recognized spokesman of the Greek Orthodox community to the outside world for much of the latter half of the twentieth century.\n\nCurrents of change that have flowed through the Orthodox world made Archbishop Iakovos a subject of intense controversy as he emerged as a founding father of the modern ecumenical movement. Much of the criticism was directed against the growing openness of Patriarch Athenagoras toward Rome and the World Council of Churches, while Archbishop Iakovos was criticized for approving this openness and initiating contact on his own in the United States with various Protestant and Catholic bodies. Ultratraditionalists see such ecumenical activity as compromising Orthodox faith. Mt. Athos, the most famous Orthodox monastery, has become a center of traditionalism and at times has been critical of Archbishop Iakovos and of changes in the contemporary church, which has always been done under the aegis of the mother church and headquarters of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nArchbishop Iakovos retired in 1996 (amid rumors that it had been forced). He was succeeded by Archbishop Spyridon (b. 1944), whose short three-year tenure was filled with controversy. He resigned in 1999 and was succeeded by Archbishop Demetrios (b. 1928).\n\nLiturgy being the most important aspect of Orthodox church life, changes affecting liturgy have been met with extreme resistance when not in conformity to early church tradition and the ecclesiology of the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1922 the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, following the mandate of the Ecumenical patriarchate, accepted the Gregorian calendar. Some other patriarchates continue to use the Julian calendar. For the canonical Orthodox Churches, the calendar controversy has been a nonissue.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2004 the archdiocese reported 563 churches, with 834 clergy serving 1.5 million members.\n\nEducational Facilities\n\nHoly Cross School of Theology and Hellenic College, Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nOrthodox Observer.\n\nSources\n\nGreek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. www.goarch.org.\n\nConstantelos, Demetrios J.

In the first century c.e., Christianity spread among the Greek-speaking residents of Egypt and from them to the Coptic-speaking peoples. In the fifth century c.e., the Patriarch of Alexandria became a monophysite, a position denounced by the Council at Ephesus in 451, and a new Patriarch, Proterios, was installed in his place. The mass of Coptic-speaking peoples followed the deposed patriarch, but a small minority stayed with the Patriarch of Alexandria, whose jurisdiction extended across North Africa. It was substantially reduced by the Muslim conquest of the territory but has survived to the present. The American exarchate was organized among Greek-speaking migrants to North America from North Africa.\n\nIn 1964 the exarchate received a young priest into its jurisdiction by the name of Makrogambrakis (1919–2005). He had migrated to America in the previous year and served under Bishop Petros of the Hellenic Orthodox Church. In 1983 Makrogambrakis was consecrated as Bishop Dionysios and named Exarchate of the Greek Orthodox Church of America. Several years later, the exarchate was granted autonomy, and as Archbishop Dionysios he became primate of the new church.\n\nMembership\n\nNot reported.\n\nSources\n\nClarke, Boden.

As the only Orthodox body in the West that allows the laity the sole right to elect bishops and to keep the monies of the church under the control of the members they were able to select new leaders. Oxford-educated Bishop Photios was elected archbishop, and Theocletos of Salimis, auxiliary bishop. Photios has gathered the largest group of Greek Orthodox followers not under Archbishop Iakovos. The installation of the archbishop took place in St. George’s Greek Orthodox Church in Memphis, Tennessee, where Archbishop Photios resided for several years.\n\nIn 1965 jurisdiction was extended to Australia.

Theofil Ionescu, Russian Patriarch Dositheus Ivanchenko, and Albanian Apb. Christoforus Rado to serve among the Greek-Americans who had migrated to Long Island from Albania, Romania, and parts of Russia. The name Vasiloupolis (“royal city”) refers to Queens, New York, where Metropolitan Pangratios was consecrated. The church grew out of a refugee program started by the late Fr. Alexander Tzulevitch, pastor of St. Nicolas Russian Orthodox Church in New York City. At a “Synod of the Diaspora,” Archimandrite Pangratios was chosen to be the archbishop over those people who had declared their desire for a leader who was traditionalist with a multicultural background, an American citizen, and missionary-minded. In addition, he would have to be approved by the exiled royal families of Greece and Romania.\n\nThrough the 1970s, Metropolitan Pangratios moved to build the archdiocese, which had grown primarily through the addition of conservative ethnic parishes. He is assisted by five titular bishops: Michael Pangratios (Rouse) of New Carthage, Kyrill Esposito of Taormina, Elias Milazzo of Apollonia, George Dimitre Pias of Palation and Metropolitan, and Leontios de Noronhos of Brazil and Argentina. Together with Metropolitan Pangratios they constitute the Hierarchical Consistory.\n\nIn 1999 the archdiocese was accepted fully as a sister church by the Old Calendar and Traditionalist Church of Greece, under the jurisdiction of Abp. Maximos Vallianatos (Auxentios).\n\nThe archdiocese is Orthodox in faith and takes a traditionalist stance, although it does accept and maintain, in a canonical Orthodox manner, Western Rite Orthodox parishes. It is an Old Calendarist group, meaning its liturgical life follows the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar. It opposes what it considers to be the modernist trends and attempts at liturgical reform represented in the churches that make up the Standing Conference of Orthodox Bishops in America.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 2008 the archdiocese reported 42 parishes and 8 monasteries.\n\nRemarks\n\nOne of Metropolitan Pangratios’s consecrators was Abp. Christoforus Rado, who around 1958 had founded the Independent Albanian Orthodox Church of St. Paul. Archbishop Christoforus died in 1974. While some of his parishes joined the Orthodox Church of America, some came under Pangratios, who consecrated Stavros Skembi to lead them. Pangratios also inherited the following of Greek-Romanian Bishop Theofil. In 1981 Pangratios consecrated Stephen Degiovanni to minister to a group of Italo-Greek immigrants located on Long Island, New York, and New Jersey.\n\nSources\n\nBlighton, Paul. Memoirs of a Mystic.

Continued adherence to the Old Calendar also emerged among Greek Orthodox believers in the United States. In 1952 Bishop Petros, then a monk from Mt. Athos, arrived in the United States from Greece as the representative of the Old Calendarists to pull together the scattered American believers. In 1962 he was consecrated as bishop of Astoria (New York), where he had established his headquarters, and Exarch of the American work. He was consecrated by two bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia.\n\nThroughout the years of its existence, the Old Calendar Movement had been split by an ongoing controversy over the presence of grace in the state Church of Greece, given its abandonment of the traditional liturgical calendar. The moderate faction held to the position that grace remained in the state church. In 1974, however, Archbishop Auxentios, the head of the synod of the moderates, issued a statement (seemingly in an attempt to placate the more extreme group, which denied the presence of grace in the state church) in which he accepted the essence of the extreme position.\n\nAs a result of Archbishop Auxentios’s action, Petros left his jurisdiction and reorganized his work independently as the Hellenic Orthodox Church in America. He followed the traditional belief and practice of Orthodoxy. By 1967 he had five churches and some 9,000 members. St. Sincletike Convent is located in Farmingdale, New York. He started a newsletter, The Voice of Orthodoxy, and a radio show of the same name. Membership in the jurisdiction is centered among Greek Americans on Long Island.\n\nMembership\n\nIn 1985 there were parishes in Astoria, Bethpage, and Hensonville, New York.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nThe Voice of Orthodoxy.\n\nSources\n\nChrysostomos, Archimandrite, with Hieromonk Ambrosios, and Hieromonk Auxentios.

Archbishop Aftimios Ofiesh (1889–1966) was appointed first archbishop of this church and headed it until his death in 1966. The church was incorporated in February 1, 1928, and continues as the same church and same corporation. It is a Western Rite jurisdiction but includes some Eastern Rite clergy and liturgies.\n\nPrior to the death of Archbishop Aftimios the church had only one bishop after the deaths of Dr. Joseph Zuk (d. 1934) and Bishop Sophronios Bishara (1888–1934), leaving only Archbishop Aftimios. Upon the death of Aftimios the church continued “in locum tenens” until its clergy were able to obtain consecration in acceptable lines. Metropolitan Victor Prentice was corporate vice president under locum tenens prior to his election in 1997 as Metropolitan President of the Church.\n\nThe church reports that its name, over the years, has been used by others in the independent movement who have claimed to be this church or related to it, as a “status symbol” because of the 1927 charter. However, because the charter was issued to Archbishop Aftimios, who subsequently incorporated the church, and the church has continued without cessation, the church as"
