        "text": "Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Saint Petro Mohyla Institute, 1916\n\nPetro Mohyla may also be spelt Peter Mogila, Petru Movilă, Saint Petro Mohyla.\n\nBukovina may be spelt Bucovina, Bukovyna.\n\n– Edited from original articles by Albert Kachkowski, and reflections by other persons.\n\nPrehistory\n\nThe establishment of the Petro Mohyla Institute was part of a movement of Ukrainian immigrants to help maintain their historical national identity as they settled into Canada and Canadian citizenship.\n\nBy the year 1910, approximately 150,000 people had emigrated to Canada from territories which came to constitute Ukraine. The great majority of them took up farming in the western provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Before emigrating to Canada, their homes had been situated mostly within the territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and some were within the Russian Empire. In general, the people left their homes in Eastern Europe because it was extremely difficult to obtain land upon which to make a living ; because finding employment for work was very difficult ; because they were Slavs or Romanians who lived under imperial Austrian/Hungarian oppression ; because, if they were Orthodox Christians, they were either pressured not to, or forbidden to practice their Orthodox Christian Faith.\n\nImmigrating people were identified by the Canadian government according to the current name of the territory in which they previously had lived. Thus, many people (such as those from Bukovina) arrived with an Austrian passport, and they were identified as Austrians by the Canadian immigration authorities. Others were identified as Russians, Poles, and so forth. They were also identified by the local regions within the larger territories from which they had arrived, such as Bukovina, Galicia (Halychyna), and Ruthenia (Trans-Carpathia). Those who arrived from Halychyna, Trans-Carpathia and Bukovina (in principle, Western Ukraine) spoke a language which was quite similar from one region to another, generally now called the Ukrainian language.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, after attending to their basic needs, recent immigrants from Ukraine quickly turned their attention to the education of their children. In local schools, including rural schools, it was already enforced with the educational policy that children speak in English only. Any use of other languages by them brought sharp discipline and ridicule upon them. The parents were concerned that their children be educated, and yet be able to retain the ability to speak in Ukrainian, and not to be ashamed of or afraid to practice their Orthodox Christian Faith and their Orthodox Christian way of life.\n\nAmongst the recent-arrivals were persons who already had some higher education, and they proceeded to acquire yet more in their new land. For many of them, especially those who would become teachers, it was evident that their homeland had for a very long time been dominated by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Empire), the Austrian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Included in much of that history was the oppression and suppression of the Orthodox Christian Faith. They soon began to recognise a similar process developing in Canada. The French Roman Catholics (in Saint Boniface, Manitoba), the Presbyterians (in Teulon, Manitoba, and in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), and the Methodists and the Baptists, were all opening educational institutions specifically to attract students of Ukrainian origin.\n\nThe newly-developing leadership amongst the Ukrainian immigrants quickly understood that it was important to set the course of the Ukrainian community onto a new path that would lead the Ukrainian people into using their own talents and resources to build their life in Canada, and on the basis of their own Faith. This was particularly the case amongst the teachers who graduated from the “Ruthenian (Ukrainian) Training School” in Winnipeg or Brandon, Manitoba (1905-1916). In addition, the recent-arrivals had to cope with the negative prejudices against them which were held by the English-speaking Canadians. There were sometimes violent attempts to keep the Ukrainians from using their own language. This was especially evident in the schools.\n\nAt the first Convention of Ukrainian Teachers in 1908, with teachers and non-teachers present, it was decided to publish an independent Ukrainian newspaper, which would give much needed direction to Ukrainian life in Canada.\n\nUkrainian “Bursa” Movement begins, 1910\n\nThe first issue of this Ukrainian independent newspaper, “Ukrainian Voice” (“Укрїнськи Голос”), appeared on 16 March, 1910, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Three months later, an association was founded with the name of “Zaporozhs’ka Sich”. Its goal was to enlighten the Ukrainian community. At one of its first meetings, the association engaged itself with the challenge of founding Ukrainian “bursas” (student residences) and national homes (community halls). In August, 1910, the “Ukrainian Voice” published an appeal for the Ukrainian community to raise funds for the establishment of “bursas”. The community responded well and became enthusiastic about this idea. Many were familiar with such residences in their home province of “Halychyna” (Galicia). They were also aware of the important role that such residences played in the education of the youth, and in imbuing them with a Ukrainian “nationalistic” spirit.\n\nAs a result, the first “Ukrainska Bursa” was opened by the “Greek Independent Church” (descendant of the “Seraphimite” schism) in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1912.\n\nPressure to use only the English language, 1911\n\nMajor opposition to the bilingual schools began in 1911. However, it was the Liberal Party in Manitoba, which had always stood in opposition to the bilingual school system (including the French form thereof), that provided the biggest threat when it took the reins of power from the Conservative Party in May, 1915. Ukrainians were worried that the bilingual system would be cancelled.\n\nIn the meantime, the Ukrainian community petitioned and lobbied the Government of Manitoba to retain the bilingual system. Nevertheless, the bill to cancel the system passed its third reading on 8 March, 1916. It meant that bilingual systems in other provinces would likely meet the same fate. This was a blow, not only to the Ukrainians of Manitoba, but to all Ukrainians (and other nationalities) in Canada. Their worries had been justified.\n\nEstablishment of the first \"bursa\", 1915\n\nDiscussions then turned to considering how the community might support the teaching of the Ukrainian language. After considering several alternatives, it was decided to pursue the most practical one : the opening of the “Adam Kotsko Bursa” in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The committee in charge called a meeting in the summer of 1915, with the goal of opening the “bursa” for the fall. There followed a great debate about the nature of the “bursa” : should it be Greek-Catholic or should it be “narodna”, of a secular Ukrainian nationalistic nature. At a meeting on 3 July, 1915, the members voted 82 to 68 to make it secular.\n\nBy the beginning of September, the “bursa” opened its doors to 16 students at 117, Juno Street, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. A campaign for funds began immediately, and collections were made in both Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Ukrainians generally continued to believe that they and the country of Canada would be better off if the younger generation were raised in a Ukrainian cultural atmosphere and would learn pride in its own ethnic origins. Thus, they sought to establish more “bursas”.\n\nSaskatoon “Mohyla Bursa” founded, 1915\n\nIt was in this context of the cancelling of government support for bilingual schools, and the initiation of the “Adam Kotsko Bursa”, with funds being collected across Canada, that a group of Ukrainian students who were living in various private homes in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, formed a Ukrainian Students’ Club in the autumn of 1915.\n\nIn 1915, the students assembled a very small amount of money ($8.00) and they organised the movement towards providing housing for Ukrainian students in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe students had followed the Manitoba bilingual school issue closely. When that matter concluded, they decided to follow the example of Winnipeg’s Ukrainians and found their own “bursa” in Saskatoon.\n\nThe Ukrainian Students’ Club of Saskatoon discussed this issue in the Lypka Home at 819-13th Street on 4 March, 1916. At that time, they decided to pursue the matter at a larger community meeting to be held the next day at the West Side Theatre (306-20th Street West).\n\nWest Side Theatre on 20th Street\n\nOn Sunday, 5 March, 1916, a planning committee was formed (headed by J Bohonis), and the first collection of funds yielded $7.36. The planning committee proclaimed its objectives, namely that :\n\nThe Saskatoon Bursa will educate Ukrainian sons and daughters to become future leaders and workers among our people. Also, the Bursa will supply devoted teachers, priests, scholars, and intellectuals who will guarantee to guard our national interests, because without this education we will not contribute anything to the national interest of Canada.\n\nFollowing the initial meeting, a financial campaign was launched for the establishment of a needed facility, and donations flowed in from many centres in Saskatchewan. Therefore, 3 houses were rented (2 for boys, 1 for girls), and in June, 1916, a call for students went out. These students would attend public, secondary, Normal Schools (teachers’ college) and university. Both genders would be accepted.\n\nThe institute would offer Ukrainian language, history and literature classes. An underlying principle of the institution was as follows : “To be a good Canadian citizen, it was desirable to maintain one's origin and national culture”.\n\nAt that time, several teachers and students of Ukrainian origin formed a student society. They were very concerned about the economic and cultural well-being of their fellow Ukrainian-Canadians. They had decided to establish a Ukrainian-based institution in Saskatoon.\n\nIt was agreed to call the first convention of Ukrainians in Canada. It took place on 4-5 August, 1916, with 500 participants attending from 60 centres in Saskatchewan, as well as several from Alberta and Manitoba. This first-ever attempt at an interprovincial meeting was an outstanding success.\n\nThe 1916 convention approved the initiatives to establish the “bursa” in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and that it be “non-denominational”. A board of directors was chosen with O Magus as president. The objectives of the institution were also more clearly stated :\n\n1. To establish and promote an institution of higher learning for students of Ukrainian descent, both male and female, of any religious denomination. 2. To provide board and lodging at a moderate charge, or entirely free of charge if need be.\n\nP Mohyla Ukrainian Institute, 1916\n\nIt is not clear when the decision was made to name the “bursa” after Petro Mohyla. However, the first written references to this name occurred in April, 1916.\n\nThe choice of Petro Mohyla is directly related to his personal history. First, Petro Mohyla (born Petru Movilă) (1596-1647) was a Romanian nobleman who became the Orthodox Christian Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galicia, and all Rus', within the Patriarchate of Constantinople (1633-1646). This was during an important and formative period of time. Second, he and a group of Orthodox Christian clerics promoted ideas of national liberation and cultural self-preservation (in the context of the recent annexation by Poland). It was a time of mass conversion to the Orthodox Christian Faith. His diplomatic gift bore fruit. King Władysław IV reinstated the status of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Third, he founded a monastic school at the Kyiv Caves Lavra. Soon, this foundation developed into a major school, and then an academy. This was accompanied by the encouragement of scholarship, and the prolific printing of various publications. There are many more reasons.\n\nMetropolitan Petro (Mohila)\n\nIn September, 1916, the “Mohyla Bursa” was opened in a rented house at 716, Lansdowne Avenue, in Saskatoon. In this first year, there were 35 students, of which 4 were girls, and 31 were boys. Of these students, 23 were Greek Catholics, 6 were Protestant, 4 were Orthodox, and 2 were Roman Catholic. The plan was to make it an all-Ukrainian educational institution.\n\nFirst house\n\nOfficial naming of the Peter Mohyla Ukrainian Institute, 1917\n\nOn 20 January, 1917, the Board officially named the “bursa” as “Ukraiins’kyi Instytut imeny Petra Mohyly”, which is translated as the “Peter Mohyla Ukrainian Institute”.\n\nOn 5 March, 1917, the institute was incorporated legally, under the “Joint Stock Company Act” as a company of shareholders who paid $25 for each of their non-dividend paying shares. Thus, the institute was owned by its member-shareholders.\n\nWasyl Swystun, the first Rector of the Mohyla Institute, expressed the will of the people :\n\nthat it was necessary for Ukrainians in Canada to destroy all artificial borders created among us in Ukraine by our enemies, so that children of Greek-Catholics, and Orthodox families can live together and get acquainted with each other as children of one Ukrainian nation.\n\nLife at the institute was strictly structured. Daily activities of students began with the 6:45 a.m. wake-up bell, followed by 1 hour to get ready for breakfast at 7:45 a.m. In the evening, students took lessons in Ukrainian language, literature, history, and culture. Students also took part in dancing, singing, and music. Before and after each meal the students prayed under the guidance of the rector. On Sundays they attended the church of their choice. To facilitate the growing demand for space at the institute, operations for the 1917-1918 school year were conducted in 3 rented buildings : 2 for boys and 1 for girls.\n\nIn December, 1917, a second Convention of Ukrainians in Canada was held in Saskatoon. This convention was attended by 700 people who represented the 3 prairie provinces and Ontario. It was held in the \"Daylight Theatre\". The spirit and enthusiasm were heightened because of the possibility of the development of a free Ukrainian state (which resulted from the revolutionary fervour of the time). With this surge of nationalistic feeling, the convention passed a resolution that :\n\nWe wish to concentrate around the Institute our best educated people, and to create it as an educational, scientific, and cultural centre for Ukrainian people in Canada.\n\nAt this 1917 convention, the delegates elected a board of directors of the institute, and they retained O Magus as the president. Viewing the institute as the centre of Ukrainian cultural work in , Western Canada, members were elected to the board from Saskatchewan, Alberta, [ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba Manitoba] (3 each), and Ontario (1).\n\nOn 29 December, the new board held its official meeting. Amongst other decisions, the board decided to pay salaries to the institute’s administrator and the secretary-treasurer (both previously were volunteers).\n\n\"Kameniari\" Literary Society\n\nIn 1918, the students organised a literary society, naming it “Kameniari” (stone-cutters) based on a poem of the same name by famous Ukrainian author Ivan Franko. This society provided students with the opportunity to express themselves and develop abilities as future leaders. The originator of the “Kameniari” society was Semen W Sawchuk.\n\nThe following views and objectives of the Kameniari were enunciated by William Burianyk, a later rector of the Mohyla Institute :\n\nThat Ukrainians in Canada do not want to be considered as perpetual immigrants, they will remain in Canada for all time, and as citizens are ready to take upon themselves the aspects of economic, political, and social life of the country. That Ukrainians are not beggars, they are children of a cultured, historically famous nation, who are willing to enrich the cultural treasury of Canada. Furthermore, that Ukrainians are not seeking favours and donations from others, they are ready to take upon themselves all obligations of Canadian Citizenship.\n\nThese words express the hopes and desires of the initiators of this movement. Very many of these persons were amongst the first Ukrainian-Canadian teachers. Because of their efforts, this institute (and the several others that were founded at about the same time) produced educated young people who were themselves amongst the first political leaders of the very large number of new Ukrainian-Canadians.\n\nBuilding Purchase, 1917\n\nThe board of directors set to work immediately after the 1917 convention. The first was the matter of an appropriate building. It became apparent that to build an appropriate building would cost more than the $100,000.00 figure that had been discussed at the convention. In the meantime, the building which was formerly known as the Empress Hotel was vacant. It was situated in a residential part of Nutana, Saskatoon, at the corner of Main Street and Victoria Avenue.\n\nFormer Empress Hotel\n\nThe Board of Directors decided to attempt to purchase it. After a month of negotiation an agreement was reached with the owners in early April, 1918, to purchase it for $32,000.00. The renovations that were required to the newly purchased building cost $20,000.00, and by October, 1918, the institute was ready to house students.\n\nSecond building\n\nOf the 60 students who then enrolled, 40 returned to their homes. This was the time of the Spanish Influenza epidemic, and many expected that the epidemic would be less severe in the country than in the city. Mercifully, the institute did not lose any students to the epidemic. When the winter frosts stopped the spread of the influenza, 70 students occupied the institute, and they participated in a full cultural programme for the balance of the school year.\n\nThis new, refurbished building provided 30 rooms for boys, and 16 rooms for girls. There was a large dining hall, which also served well as an activity room for dancing, concerts, singing, and various other functions. There also was a residential suite for the rector. This building properly housed approximately 70 students. However, in times of extreme need, it accommodated 120 students, with as many as 8 sharing one of the large rooms.\n\nUkrainian Greek Orthodox Church, 1918\n\nIt is said that the Mohyla Institute was a catalyst for the formation of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nInitially a nonsectarian residence for all Ukrainian students from rural areas attending educational institutions in Saskatoon, the institute became the center of a major controversy in 1917, when the Ukrainian Catholic bishop Nykyta Budka demanded that it become a Roman Catholic entity, and that its properties be incorporated with the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Episcopal Corporation.\n\nThe desire to protect what was regarded as the national integrity of the institute provided a catalyst for the liberal intelligentsia in Canada to break ranks with the Roman Catholics and to establish the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada in Saskatoon in 1918. The institute then became an important symbol of and center for the fledgling church community. It sponsored courses in Ukrainian language, literature, history of Ukraine, choral singing, and folk arts ; it held concerts, lectures, and debates intermittently throughout Saskatchewan ; and it sought to develop a sense of Ukrainian patriotism in the students who lived there (approximately 100 annually).\n\nThe strong criticism of the institute by the Ukrainian Catholic clergy finally caused some of the institute’s leaders to leave that church in the summer of 1918. Determined not to be churchless or Godless, these leaders promptly organized a 30-person committee, which in turn organised a confidential meeting of more than 100 people from the 3 Prairie Provinces. The meeting took place on 18-19 July, 1918. It was at that meeting that it was decided to form a Ukrainian Orthodox Brotherhood which would concern itself with the organising of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada by calling the first general assembly of the new Church.\n\n\"Mohylianky Society\", 1923\n\nAlthough the female residents at Mohyla Institute were active members of the Kameniari, and they took a keen interest in the institute’s cultural and educational programme, they felt the need for an organisation of their own. In 1923, the girls’ organisation, the “Mohylianky Society”, was formed by Savella Stechishin and senior girls. This organisation promoted good public speaking and debates through their oratory programme. They also included studies about Ukrainian writers, music and singing, and they organised discussion groups. Thus, the girls, too, were trained for leadership, and they studied many aspects of Ukrainian culture.\n\nIn 1923, the leaders of the Mohylianky Society played a leading role in the founding of the first (Olha Kobylianska Ukrainian Women’s Association (Olha Kobylianska Branch) in Saskatoon. Afterwards, other Ukrainian Women’s branches were formed, and the Ukrainian Women’s Association of Canada was soon founded in Saskatoon in 1926.\n\nFirst Mortgage Burning, 1925\n\nThe year 1925 started with an expansive carolling campaign during the Nativity Season in order to benefit the institute. Thirty-three groups travelled around the province, and the resulting carolling donations totalled a record sum of $1,455.30.\n\nThe 9th National Convention of Ukrainians in Canada was held at the institute on 30-31 December, 1925. These were buoyant times, and the mood was nearly euphoric. It was hoped that the mortgage would be able to be paid off at this convention. Therefore, after the business session, an appeal was made, and a collection of donations for the institute was made at the assembly. As the donations were collected, the needed remainder was attained.\n\nThe mortgage document was passed from hand to hand for everyone to see. After 2 more speeches, 2 of the oldest members held the document while Wasyl Swystun and Julian Stechishin set it afire from 2 sides and it quickly turned to ashes. The students chanted the “burstskyi klych” (bursa cheer) as a conclusion to the ceremony :\n\nБУРСАЦЬКИЙ КЛИЧ BURSA CHEER Пу-гу козаки ! Young Cossacks ! Саска – саска – бурсаки ! Saska, Saska, bursakites ! Для народу ростуть сили For the people, forces grow В славній Бурсі Петра Могили ! In the glorious Bursa of Peter Mohyla ! Бурса – бурса – бурс – бурсун ! Bursa - Bursa - Bursa - Bursun ! Саска – Саска – Саскатун ! Saska - Saska - Saskatoon !\n\nCultural exchange\n\nIn 1926, the first student cultural exchange took place in the form of a debate between the students of Saskatoon and Winnipeg.\n\nUkrainian dance summer school\n\nIn May, 1927, the institute invited the ballet-master Vasyl Avramenko to conduct dance classes at the institute for students and for the community at large. Mr. Avramenko had recently arrived in eastern Canada from Ukraine. Nearly 100 enrolled and the courses ended with a concert in one of the larger halls in Saskatoon.\n\nAbout the effect of Ukrainian dance on the youth, Julian Stechishin wrote,\n\n… Avramenko’s schools awakened Ukrainian youth, enthused them and handed them something concrete, with which they were able to step forward and be proud of in front of their non-Ukrainian neighbours.\n\nYouth dance group\n\nNational conventions\n\nThe national conventions which were convened by the institute every year from 1918 were like a parliament for Ukrainian Canadians, at which various concerns about life in the Ukrainian community were discussed. The leadership of the institute was central to these discussions. The students, for their part, sacrificed a portion of their Christmas vacation and in support of the work and life in the institute, they presented a play and a concert for the delegates.\n\nBy 1927, it had become apparent to the institute’s leaders, that the institute, which was in fact a Ukrainian cultural-educational institution, would not be able to rise to the position of being able to engage in all general Ukrainian concerns and matters, be they economic, political or religious. It was decided that it was therefore necessary to form a new body with a clearly-stated ideology, and which could attract and retain people who were not members of the institute.\n\nUkrainian Self-Reliance League, 1927\n\nThe leaders of the institute met in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in October, 1927, and they discussed the proposed new organisation. A main concern was the name to be chosen. Finally, the name “Soiuz Ukraiintsiv Samostiinykiv” (“Ukrainian Self-Reliance League” (USRL)) was selected. At the 11th annual national convention of Ukrainians in Canada (held in late December, 1927), a resolution was passed which brought into being the Ukrainian Self-Reliance League (USRL). Another resolution officially named the “Ukrainian Voice” as the CYC/USRL publication organ.\n\nShortly after the convention, even though the institute’s cultural and educational work was flourishing, rumours had begun to circulate that the institute was the source of much anti-Canadian propaganda. However, in the late summer of 1928, an article in the “Yorkton Enterprise”, and a full-page story in the “Saskatoon Star-Phoenix”, about the positive work in the community and the excellent training the institute was providing its students, put an end to such negative rumours. This publicity was also most effective in informing the community at large about the purpose and work of the institute.\n\nThe last National Convention organised by the institute was in 1928. In an unusual manner, this convention took place between 22 December and 1 January, in 3 centres : Edmonton, Saskatoon and Winnipeg, with 3 days in each city. The convention was co-hosted by the USRL. The convention played a large role in spreading the ideology of the newly founded organisation.\n\nThe 1929 convention was the first one which was organised by the USRL. In this convention, the institute participated only as a component organisation.\n\nHard times : the Great Depression\n\nIn 1930, the Canadian national economy collapsed, and the numbers of students decreased. During the next 10-11 years, the operation of the institute was sustained with great difficulty and effort.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, and the end of the prairie drought, the national economic situation eased. However, many institute alumni joined the armed forces. The number of students remained small. The building had come to be in a rundown condition, and taxes were several years in arrears. Substantial amounts were owed for fuel and services.\n\nIn 1941-1942, the institute’s 25th anniversary year, a concerted drive was conducted in order to put the financial affairs in order. An appeal for donations was sent out across the country. The generosity of the institute’s supporters, and the success of certain other procedures yielded sufficient funds to clear the financial burden of the past, and also to carry out some much needed renovations in the building.\n\n“Ukrainian Arts & Crafts Museum”, 1941\n\nIn December, 1941, the “Ukrainian Arts & Crafts Museum” of the Ukrainian Women’s Association of Canada opened a gallery in a room provided by the institute. The women’s organisation had been collecting artifacts (primarily textiles) of Ukrainian pioneers, since the early 1930s. The institute provided space for the museum gallery, free of charge, until 1979.\n\nAt that time, the museum moved into its own quarters as the Ukrainian Museum of Canada of the Ukrainian Women’s Association of Canada (UMC). The name was shortened to “Ukrainian Museum”, and it came to feature 3 galleries dedicated to celebrating and promoting the arts, culture, and legacy of the Ukrainian Canadian community. The new site was at 910, Spadina Crescent East, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7K 3H5.\n\nUkrainian Museum, Saskatoon\n\nYearbooks\n\nAfter World War II, the students began publishing an annual yearbook which documented their activities. It also included some literary efforts by the students. These yearbooks were published, under the title “Kameniari”, through the 1950s. When a year was missed, it was made up with a double issue the following year. The last yearbook was published in the 1970s.\n\nCultural exchanges 1950s\n\nIn the 1950s, some cultural exchanges took place between “Kameniari” and students of Saint Andrew’s College in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Saint John’s Institute in Edmonton, Alberta, (Saint Vladimir’s Institute in Toronto, Ontario, had not yet been founded). This primarily took the form of debating teams competing for a trophy presented annually.\n\n40th anniversary, 1956\n\nIn 1956, at the 40th anniversary reunion banquet, the Mohylianky Society donated $250.00 towards the building of a new institute facility.\n\nRadio programme\n\nIn 1957, the “Kameniari” presented a radio programme of Ukrainian Christmas carols. Preparing this radio programme became an annual practice. The student choir recorded Christmas carols each autumn, and the choir combined the carols with messages of good will from the administration and the students. The students arranged for broadcasting on several stations in the province. This Christmas radio programme continued until the early 1980s.\n\nNeed for a new building, 1956\n\nIn 1976, Professor Andrew Michalenko wrote that in the 1950s,\n\nthe mechanization of agriculture and increase in industrial activity set in motion the great shift of population from the countryside to the city. Thus, the rural population, which was the mainstay of support for the institute, began to decrease.\n\nHe went on to say,\n\nwith economic conditions much improved, the standard of accommodation provided by the old building was no longer satisfactory. To put it simply, the physical plant was worn out. It became apparent that the institute must have a new building or sink into oblivion.\n\nOnce again, the need for an improved facility was urgent, and the interest of the people was high.\n\nEveryone saw the effective educational and cultural achievements of the Ukrainians in Canada made possible by the excellent work done by the institute. In 1958, in response to this need, plans were being developed to relocate, and to construct a new building closer to the University of Saskatchewan. The first public meeting was held in Yorkton, and the participants discussed the need for a new building. The programme included some Ukrainian dancing performed by students. A 16mm coloured home movie recorded this event.\n\nMohyla Institute (new corporation), 1958\n\nA membership corporation was registered with the provincial government. It was entitled, “Mohyla Institute (1958)”. Its purpose was to provide and to operate the new building. The corporation “Mohyla Institute (1958)” co-existed with the old shareholder corporation until the mid-1970s, by which time most shareholders had redeemed (in fact, donated) their shares to the new corporation. Lifetime memberships in the “new” institute were, and still are, sold at $25 each. In the 1960s, there was a cultural “revival” as the institute prepared to move into new quarters.\n\nInter-institute exchanges, 1962\n\nThe first mass-participation inter-institute exchange took place in 1962, when more than 20 students from Saint John’s Institute in Edmonton travelled by train and visited the Mohyla Institute for a cultural weekend. The programme included sports activities and a dance on Saturday. On Sunday, after the Divine Liturgy at the Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Church (now Cathedral), there was a public concert, which included songs, skits, dancing and, according to tradition, a debating competition. This took place in the new auditorium (1960) located next to the church.\n\nThe debate was particularly memorable. The topic was “Resolved that the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada allow the English language to be used in the liturgy in its parishes”. In this debate, the Saint John’s Institute team of 2 debaters took the affirmative side. It was revealed to be a sensitive and emotional topic. The debate continued as a discussion amongst all the students in the institute's common room prior to supper that same afternoon. It became apparent that the views held for debating purposes were actually the views of the students from each centre. It became an emotional Edmonton-versus-Saskatoon discussion in which even the rectors of the institutes became involved. Even though some tears were shed during the discussion, the 2 groups parted on friendly terms. The visitors had to board the train later that evening to travel home. Much was learned and shared. New friends were made. The following year, the Mohyla Institute students visited the Saint John’s Institute in Edmonton.\n\nThe exchanges continued to be held each year, usually in February. Saint Andrew’s College students joined the exchanges, and in the 1970s, Saint Vladimir’s Institute in Toronto was included. They all took turns hosting. These annual exchanges, though modified in programming, continue to take place to this day.\n\nChristmas carolling\n\nIn the early 1960s, the custom of carolling during the season of the Nativity of Christ was promoted amongst the students. Volunteer drivers from the Board of Directors took groups of students carolling to members’ homes during the Christmas season. Customary gifts of money went towards the building fund. This practice grew, and it culminated in the mid-1970s with 11 groups of students going out (in rented cars) to communities all over Saskatchewan on the weekend following Julian Calendar Christmas (January 7). In addition, student carollers visited homes in Saskatoon. Proceeds from this endeavour were shared between the institute and “Kameniari”.\n\nConcert tours\n\nIn 1963, with the support of the administration, the students directed and produced an operetta entitled “Na Sinozhati” (“On the Hay Meadow”), with a cast of about 15 students. This involved considerable effort, considering that the players were full-time students. This required that some of the rehearsals be held at 7:00 a.m.\n\nVolunteer Board-members drove the students to their performances of the operetta in Moose Jaw and Regina, and at a different time in Canora and Yorkton. The host communities billeted the students in their homes when an overnight stay was involved.\n\nThis activity evolved through the 1960s into what became an annual event in the 1970s. It was referred to as the annual concert tour in which 2 or 3 communities were visited in 1 weekend with a 2-hour concert consisting of drama (sourced from the collection of drama scripts in the Mohyla Institute library), choir, and dancing presentations. Although the concerts were largely student-directed, preparations sometimes involved volunteer choir and dance instructors from the broader community. Travel was by bus, and overnights were in motels. The tour took place near the end of November in order to allow time for the annual Christmas radio programme to be recorded prior to the Christmas break. The institute chose concert destinations in response to invitations from the Ukrainian Self-Reliance League (USRL)-affiliated organisations, particularly branches of the Ukrainian Women’s Association of Canada, who usually hosted the students with a reception. The communities visited with concerts, in addition to those already mentioned, included Prince Albert, Nipawin, Gronlid, Hudson Bay, Meadow Lake, Kamsack, Kindersley, Ituna and Stenen. Each concert was also presented in Saskatoon on the weekend following the tour. The concert ended with the singing of the Ukrainian national anthem and the “Bursatskyi Klych” chant.\n\nEvery student was introduced personally at each concert, by name, and by community of origin. Audience numbers ranged from 50 to 300. The language used for all the concerts was exclusively Ukrainian. The last concert tour took place in 1978. In the 1970s, as a public relations gesture and a cultural experience, small groups of students, forming a singing group, would go out to country parishes to sing the liturgy for them. In particular, Vonda and Kindersley were the beneficiaries of such excursions.\n\nNew building, 1965\n\nThe new institute was constructed at 1240, Temperance Street (2 blocks from the university), and the official opening took place on 13-15 August, 1965. The corner-stone of the new institute was laid by Dr Zenovey Danylchuk of Canora. The event was a great success, and it was celebrated in 3 locations. At the new institute (at 1240, Temperance Street), there were tours of the building with its new furnishings. The ribbon-cutting took place on a platform in front of the institute. This ceremony featured distinguished guests, including the mayor of Saskatoon, E J Cole. A banquet was held at the Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral Auditorium. An outdoor church service, a picnic lunch, and an afternoon concert were held on the grounds of the Saskatoon Exhibition Park.\n\nThe occasion was well-attended, with representation from all parts of Canada.\n\nIn 1966-1967, Protopresbyter Oleh Krawchenko served as Rector of the institute, and also as its chaplain.\n\nThe railing from the old building is now used in the upper story (“Boom Town” section) of the Western Development Museum in Saskatoon.\n\nPart of the \"Boomtown\" exhibit\n\nThird building, on Temperance Street\n\nSide view, along Wiggins Avenue\n\nRe-naming of the UGOCC, 1990\n\nIn 1990, the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada was officially renamed “The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada” (UOCC) by an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe UOCC entered into Eucharistic union with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, 1990\n\nIn 1990, the 18th Sobor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba, decided to enter into Eucharistic Union with the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople (Istanbul). This decision also changed the relationship with the other Orthodox dioceses and parishes in Canada in a positive way.\n\nFull spiritual and cultural formation\n\nBecause of the very rich environment provided to the many Ukrainian-descended students and others who lived in the institute, this educational institution actually strengthened the whole of Western Canada. While they lived in the institute, very many students were awakened to the deeper meaning and way of life of the Orthodox Christian Faith which many of them had inherited. Many good marriages were made, which in turn led to strong families. Many were strengthened in their fluency in the Ukrainian language, which itself is very rich in proverbs and humour. Many benefitted from the fact that a full Divine Liturgy service was held at the institute on Sundays for many years, and this gave the students a very convenient access to the sacraments. Thus, their whole lives were strengthened and enriched.\n\nThere were more aspects of the institute's life which contributed to their healthy formation. When the students returned for classes in early January, they could participate in the Nativity Holy Supper on 6 January, and again in the Epiphany Supper on 19 January. This gave a sense of holy community and high holy days spent together.\n\nLife at the Mohyla Institute was not concerned about a narrow nationalism, but rather an attempt to preserve and nurture a whole culture in all its aspects. Thus, for Orthodox Christians, this begins with the Orthodox Christian Faith which is lived out and expressed in language, crafts, dancing, food, hospitality, mutual care of one another. In a way, it has tried to provide what is the essence of the meaning and way of life. The cycle of the year included meatless Fridays. There were daily prayers before supper which were led by the rector ; or in his absence, they were led by any student who could lead the prayers in Ukrainian. In addition, there would be farm trucks arriving in the autumn, which carried loads of potatoes and cabbages for the students. These kept the cooks busy making perogies and cabbage-rolls for the residents, which provided a real sense of home for those far away from home.\n\nThere were clergy who cared for the spiritual life of the students, and they were present often. This was in connexion with the Ukrainian Orthodox Parish of All Saints in Saskatoon which had itself come into being through the institute. In particular during the early 1970s, there were 2 priests who served as chaplains at the institute who were influential with the students in a particularly good way. One was the Priest Oleg Krawchenko, who served as the rector of the institute. The other was the Priest Orest Olekshy, who regularly appeared at the institute on Saturdays in order to sit in the student lounge with an invitation to students to come and speak about anything that concerned them. They could address any spiritual questions or personal problems to him, and this opportunity and relationship proved to be greatly beneficial for many students.\n\nLibrary\n\nThe institute assembled a significant library over the years. In particular, a significant acquisition was made when Julian Stechishin was in Lviv, Ukraine, and “bought many very valuable books for the Institute”.\n\nA room in both institute buildings was dedicated to the library collection. In the 1970s, thanks to available grant monies, the entire collection was catalogued and a card file was prepared by student workers over 5 summers. This was the start of a career for one of the students, Zenon Zuzak, who later became the director of the Francis Morrison Library in Saskatoon. His father was a priest who served in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nBefore anyone was able to imagine microfilm and electronic digitisation, it had been deemed important to save the copies of the “Ukrainian Voice”. This was done diligently by the institute, beginning with the first issue printed in March, 1910. Volunteers assembled and sewed the newspapers into annual “books”, bound in hard cover and labelled with embossed print. One of the most dedicated volunteers was John Rubashewsky, of Calder/Yorkton, a retired teacher who spent hundreds of hours in the 1960s and 1970s as a live-in book-binder. He was the last person to work on this project. This collection is still housed at the institute.\n\nNewsletter\n\nAn important link with the community was the establishment of the Mohyla newsletter that was a co-operative effort between the institute office, which provided the copy, and Walter Mysak, a Canora, Saskatchewan, alumnus, who edited and published the newsletter 4 to 6 times a year on a volunteer basis.\n\nThe newsletter, printed on newsprint, was a source of information regarding the preparations for the new building, its construction and the subsequent paying down of the mortgage, originally about $350,000.00. The progress reports, community and student news, and appeals for funds were disseminated through that newsletter. The mortgage was paid off in 1976. Walter Mysak served as editor from 1958 to approximately 1980. After that, the newsletter format was changed and it was published from the institute office.\n\nIn order to maintain contact with the community and to raise the much-needed funds for the institute, the province was divided into districts, and a board member was elected from each district’s annual general meeting of institute members. When funding was needed, board members were encouraged to go door-to-door in the Ukrainian community and to solicit funds for the institute. It was common at board meetings for board members to turn over to the management the receipts from their most recent collection. Donations and donors’ names were printed in the newsletter, listed by district and by town, in recognition and encouragement for others to join in the campaign.\n\nSummer School\n\nIn 1970, in co-operation with the Mohyla Institute, the Ukrainian School Council (“Rada Ukrains’koi Shkoly”) organised a Ukrainian Summer School for high school students, which was to be held at the institute. This was a 5-week live-in programme, in which the students studied Ukrainian language courses accredited by the Saskatchewan Department of Education (Grades 9 to 12), for one-half day. Then they participated in a Ukrainian cultural and sports programme for the other half-day. Fully-qualified teachers taught the language programme and the cultural portion was conducted by a staff of monitors supplemented with volunteers. The summer programme was held annually.\n\nIn 1975, it was decided to convert the programme into a total-immersion experience based on the methodology of the French immersion summer programme held at the University of Saskatchewan. This meant hiring a staff of teachers and monitors fully fluent in Ukrainian. The first director of the total-immersion programme was Dr. Andrij Hornjatkevyč, a university professor from Edmonton. The monitors were post-high school youth. Sufficiently fluent candidates were difficult to find in Saskatchewan, so some monitors were recruited (through USRL contacts) and brought in from Ontario and Alberta. A week-long preparatory programme was instituted so monitors could learn the methodology and practice the instructional techniques they would use. Upon arrival, students were provided with an orientation in English. After that, they were expected to speak Ukrainian at all times, within their range of ability.\n\nBeginners were quickly taught questions which they could ask in Ukrainian, and which they could use to build their Ukrainian vocabulary. To enhance the Ukrainian language learning experience, it was decided to pay all expenses to bring 2 non-English-speaking Ukrainians (a boy and a girl) who were fluent Ukrainian-speaking students, age 16, from other countries in order to encourage the Canadian students to speak Ukrainian in their daily activities. This programme was offered for 5 summers, with students coming from Germany, France, Switzerland and Argentina. Ukraine was closed to this opportunity at the time.\n\nStudent residents benefitted from personal time on Saturdays. Sunday involved going to Ukrainian language Church services (Orthodox or Ukrainian Catholic). This was followed by a bus excursion for recreational activities at a lake, camp or festival.\n\nThe summer school programme concluded with a public concert performed by the students, which was attended by parents, family, friends, and institute supporters.\n\nOver the 37 years that the summer programme was offered, programme modifications developed, and the programme switched from language immersion to cultural immersion with a strong language component. The summer programme was last offered in 2006.\n\nCompulsory Cultural Programme Participation\n\nIn the mid-1970s, a system of compulsory participation during the school year was instituted. The students all signed an agreement to participate in a minimum of 8 hours of cultural programming per semester, or 16 hours for the year. Students could choose from choir, drama, dancing, Ukrainian language classes, or lectures given by visiting guest lecturers. Those who failed to meet the requirement were not accepted for residence the following year. The compulsory participation programme continued for about 5 years.\n\nKameniari Elections\n\nIn the 1970s, “Kameniari” elections were lively affairs, and there were at least 2 candidates for each position. A campaign evening featured speeches by the candidates. Some years, each candidate for president sponsored his own evening of campaigning which featured entertainment. In the autumn of 1975, Sonia Hawrysh became the first-ever female elected president of Kameniari.\n\nScholarships\n\nJohn Fedan of Arnold, Pennsylvania, USA, established the first scholarship through the gift of an endowment of $3,000.00 in 1941, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the institute.\n\nBetween 1970 and 2000, the number of scholarships grew substantially. The Mohyla Institute web-site lists 21 scholarships, all established by donors of endowments to the institute. Annual awards from each scholarship vary between $100 and $800.\n\nAs the institute raised funds by various means in the community to support the summer school and its winter programming, and conducted its affairs, some unique experiences did occur.\n\nCommunity liaison\n\nIn the early 1970s, as the elimination of the building’s mortgage came in view, and enthusiasm mounted in anticipation, 2 students decided to dedicate themselves to this cause. John Gramiak of Hafford and Terry Martinuk of Calder, devoted one whole summer to travelling around the province. They promoted the institute and collected donations for it. They did this on a volunteer basis, in return for expenses only.\n\nIn addition, Albert Kachkowski developed other methods also through which the mortgage was indeed retired during these years.\n\nThe many activities of the residents at the institute during their years of study played an important role in shaping many future Ukrainian community leaders. The institute also provided the first home for the Ukrainian Museum of Canada, from 1936 (to 1980), and operated a library, whose holdings currently number approximately 10,000 volumes. In 1958, the institute began publishing a bilingual newsletter, “Holos Instytutu” (“Voice of the Institute”).\n\nIn 1965, the institute moved to its new building situated closer to the University of Saskatchewan campus. Since 1975, the institute has conducted an annual Ukrainian-immersion summer school.\n\nAll Saints Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Saskatoon developed from the institute itself, assembled weekly on the premises for 11 years, and for a long time it served as the parish for the institute.\n\nWestern Canada Lottery\n\nAt the same time, provincial gaming laws were relaxed, and the Western Canada Lottery came into existence. The lottery used paper tickets in booklets. Charitable organisations were allowed to sell the tickets.\n\nThe “Mohyla Institute” took advantage of the opportunity. It became apparent that some other organisations were using mass mailings to sell the tickets. The institute began to do the same, and it quickly became one of the top 3 sellers in the province, along with the Saskatchewan Foresters and the Saskatoon Hilltops. The rewards were significant. This new-found prosperity enabled the institute to fund an ambitious 60th anniversary celebration, to bring students from Europe and South America for the summer schools, and to send about 24 students to the first student exchange to be held in Toronto in 1975. When the lottery converted to a ball-system, which no longer involved ticket stubs for the draws, the participation of charitable organisations decreased. However, the institute had accumulated a lottery proceeds reserve fund of $350,000.00 by 1979.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the reserve fund enabled the institute to bring summer school monitors from Ukraine, and to endure the deficits that the summer school and regular institute operations experienced from time to time.\n\nThe name change, 1996\n\nFor most of the institute’s history, it was named the “P Mohyla Ukrainian Institute”.\n\nWhen the new building was opened in 1965, the name was simplified to “Mohyla Institute”.\n\nAfter Metropolitan Petro Mohyla was glorified (canonised) in Ukraine in 1996 by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Board of Directors of the institute renamed it the “Saint Petro Mohyla Institute”.\n\nSaint Petro (Mohyla)\n\nCelebrations and reunions\n\nThe first mortgage was ceremonially burned at the 9th convention in 1925.\n\nIn 1941, the 25th anniversary was marked.\n\nIn 1956, a 40th anniversary banquet was held.\n\nIn 1973, a banquet honouring the 50th anniversary of the Mohylianky Society was held in the Ukrainian Orthodox Auditorium in Saskatoon. It featured a display of all the original composite layouts of student photographs for the 50 years. It allowed guests to admire the photographs and to reminisce.\n\nFormer prime minister of Canada, John G Diefenbaker, was the head table guest at the banquet honouring the 60th anniversary of “Kameniari” held at the institute in February, 1978, in conjunction with the inter-institute exchange that was held in Saskatoon. A black-and-white videotape was made of the event. A reunion was held in October of that year and a group photograph was taken of more than 20 “Kameniari” presidents in attendance, including the first president, the Archpriest Semen W Sawchuk.\n\nPlanning for the 60th anniversary of the institute began in 1974. The celebration took place 1-4 July, 1976. Approximately 300 people registered for the event. It featured a live stage production in Saskatoon’s main auditorium, and it told the story of the institute. Over 700 were in the audience. It featured a 16-piece orchestra, a 45-member cast starring Cecil Semchyshyn of Winnipeg, and the 60th anniversary choir. A special feature was the first Saskatchewan visit of the then famous Ukrainian dance band Rushnychok of Montréal, Québec. Alumni from all 6 decades attended. At the Saturday night banquet, the mortgage for the new building was ceremonially burned.\n\nThe 75th anniversary reunion celebration took place the summer of 1991 at the Saskatoon Inn, in conjunction with the USRL Convention. It featured a banquet and dance. Decade photos of alumni were taken. The 1991 reunion was the first of 21 consecutive annual reunions by student residents of the 1960s decade.\n\nA 90th anniversary celebration took place in Saskatoon in 2007, with a banquet and renewal of acquaintances.\n\nThe 95th anniversary celebration was held in Saskatoon, and it featured the unveiling of the National Historic Event plaque. The evening banquet featured a performance by the grandson of Julian Stechishin, John Stech an accomplished jazz pianist from New York. John is also a Mohyla Summer School alumnus. At the banquet, the organising committee honoured the alumni who stayed at the institute in the 1930s and 1940s, by presenting them with a Certificate of Honourary Membership in the “Mohyla Institute”.\n\n\"A National Historic Event\", 2011\n\nThe Government of Canada's Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada hosted a ceremonial unveiling of an official bronze plaque recognising the “St. Petro Mohyla Institute” as a National Historic Event. By virtue of this designation, the institute was welcomed to Canada’s family of National Historic Sites, which includes places, people and events of national historical importance. The public unveiling ceremony took place in conjunction with the 95th anniversary celebrations on 24 September, 2011.\n\nThe plaque was inscribed in 3 languages : English, French, and Ukrainian. The English-language plaque inscription reads as follows :\n\nPETRO MOHYLA INSTITUTE In 1916, the activities of a dynamic group of Ukrainian immigrants culminated in the founding of the Mohyla Institute at the first Ukrainian national convention in Saskatoon. The Institute, operating as a student residence, supported higher education for Ukrainian youth while also serving as a centre for cultural and religious events. In 1916, following a fractious debate, it spearheaded the formation of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada. In the ensuing decades, the Institute instilled a sense of community leadership in young men and women who would go on to found a range of Ukrainian organizations.\n\nUnveiling the plaque\n\nSpeech by Allan Dudderidge\n\nThis recognition is not concerned with any particular building, but rather, it recognises the lasting impact of the people within the organisation. Many Ukrainian-Canadian organisations saw their genesis through the community spirit that defines the “St. Petro Mohyla Institute”.\n\nStudent society activities integral to the historic significance of the institute continue to be encouraged and facilitated at the institute.\n\nCentenary : 24-26 June, 2016\n\nCommemorative plaque\n\nProfessor Andrew Michalenko, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary, had written :\n\nA brilliant centenary celebration in 2016 is assured if we do our part now.\n\nPeople did, in fact, set to work.\n\nOn 24 June, 2016, the eve of the 100th anniversary, the Mohyla Institute Board Chair Steve Senyk stated :\n\nJust imagine the excitement that was in the air on Sunday, March 5, 1916, during a meeting at West Side Theatre in Saskatoon when a group of students collected $7.36 in support of their decision to form a ‘bursa’. Few people had any money to spare but that did not stop them. Our founders actualized their imagination on that historic day. They took action. They worked together and because of them Mohyla Institute was created. And here we are, 100 years later getting ready to celebrate Mohyla’s 100th anniversary in Saskatoon on June 24-26, 2016.\n\nRegardless of how the 100th anniversary was celebrated, it is undeniable that, in its first century, the Mohyla Institute left an indelible positive impact on the lives of thousands of people, on the organised Ukrainian Canadian communities they lived in, the province of Saskatchewan and the nation of Canada.\n\nURSL/CYC at the 100th anniversary\n\nCentennial of the UOCC, 2018\n\nIn 2018, the 100th anniversary of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada and also of Holy Trinity Cathedral were marked at an extraordinary sobor (assembly) at the cathedral in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe purpose of the sobor was to celebrate 100 years of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada. The celebrations were attended by Ukrainian Orthodox faithful from across Canada and beyond.\n\nThe Sobor began on Thursday, 9 August, 2018, with a Hierarchical Divine Liturgy in the Chapel of Saint Petro Mohyla Institute, presided by Bishop Andriy (Peshko) of the Eastern Eparchy, with the responses sung by the Clergy led by Father Michael Lomaszkiewicz. This was followed by an All-Canada Clergy Conference.\n\nCentennial Clergy Conference\n\nAll gathered for Vespers at the Mohyla Institute Chapel and this was followed by a wine and cheese reception as the delegates and guests registered for the Extraordinary National Council.\n\nThe celebrations continued for a year.\n\n2020-2021 Coronavirus-19 virus restrictions on parishes\n\nIn early 2020, the Covid-19 virus made its appearance in Canada, and it quickly became a world-wide pandemic. Because of the rules governing gatherings that were laid down by the provincial and city governments, the chapel stopped any further services after 8 March, 2020. Including the rules regarding social distancing, the decreasing numbers permitted for any gathering, and the considerations regarding the health of all concerned, this and other parishes were required to close for a time.\n\nAs elsewhere, there was some controversy about the legal requirements.\n\nThese prescriptions applied to the chapel of the institute, but not to the whole institution.\n\nHelp for Ukrainian refugees, 2022\n\nIn 2022, there was already an increase in emigration from Ukraine to Canada. Then the Saint Petro Mohyla Institute offered basic conversational Ukrainian language courses to Canadians who were preparing to receive refugees into their homes, and to help them as they settled. These courses were made available by \"Zoom\" to anyone in Canada who wished to register for this. They took place between April and July, 2022.\n\nPeople in Saskatchewan were encouraged by the institute to donate to the \"Red Cross\" for this purpose, since the Federal Government was supplying matching grants for this humanitarian assistance (not only for immigrants, but also for those who remained in Ukraine). Another agency receiving donations for similar help was the \"Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal\".\n\nElection of Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk), 2022\n\nElection of a nominee by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada\n\nOn 15-19 June, 2022, the 24th Sobor of the Ukrainian Orthodox of Canada was convened \"on-line\". This conference-meeting was convened thus instead of convening physically (as customarily) in Winnipeg, Manitoba. There were 6 cathedrals in Canada where this meeting took place simultaneously through a computer-network : in Winnipeg, Manitoba (Holy Trinity Metropolitan Cathedral) ; Vancouver, British Columbia (Holy Trinity Cathedral) ; in Edmonton, Alberta (Saint John's Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral) ; in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (Holy Trinity Cathedral) ; in Toronto, Ontario (Saints Vladimir and Olga Cathedral) ; in Montréal, Québec (Saint Sophie Cathedral).\n\nThere was a total of 205 delegates, which was near the average attendance for such sobors.\n\nIn the course of the work of the Sobor, there was the necessary election in order to nominate to the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople a candidate for election as Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, who would succeed the Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk).\n\nThere were 3 candidates who were considered : Archbishop Job (Getcha), Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk), and Bishop Andriy (Peshko). The final choice of the members of the sobor was Archbishop Job (Getcha). He had received more than the minimum required 51% of the votes, and there was no subsequent voting required.\n\nThe election by the Sobor (Assembly) of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada then had to be confirmed by the Holy Synod of Bishops of Constantinople (as is described in the Consistory By-laws).\n\nUpon having received the nomination (with accompanying documents) from the Sobor of the UOCC, the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople elected Vladyka Ilarion (Rudnyk) to become Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Canada.\n\nThe Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople elected Archbishop Job (Getcha) to become Metropolitan of Pisidia, in west-central Türkiye (Turkey), north of Lycia, and east of Ephesus.\n\nConfirmation of election in Constantinople/Istanbul, 2022\n\nOn 29 August, 2022, Vladyka Ilarion (Rudnyk) was at the Phanar in Constantinople for the purpose of the first confirmation of the election in June, 2022. He co-served the Divine Liturgy with Patriarch Bartholomew (Archontonis) in the Cathedral of Saint George at the Phanar.\n\nEnthronement as Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, 2022\n\nOn Saturday, 19 November, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., in Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Enthronement Hierarchical Divine Liturgy was served. Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) presided at the Divine Liturgy. He was assisted by Bishop Andriy (Peshko), many priests, several deacons, subdeacons and Altar-servers. Present also were Metropolitan Archbishop Sotirios (Athanassoulas), Exarch of Canada for the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk), Former Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) at the Phanar, Istanbul, 2023\n\nOn Sunday, 2 July, 2023, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew (Archontonis) was present and praying during the Divine Liturgy at Saint George's Cathedral in the Patriarchate compound. He gave the blessing that Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) preside (\"horostasia\") over the Divine Liturgy. Metropolitan Job (Getcha) of Pisidia, Bishop Athenagoras (Ziliaskopoulos) of Nazianzos, and the Honourable Roman Nedilskyi, General Consul of Ukraine in Constantinople were also present and praying with the congregation of the Faithful.\n\nChange of calendar for the UOCC, 2023\n\nOn 1 December, 2023, in accordance with the resolutions of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyk) announced that, effective that day, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada moved to use the New (Revised Julian) Calendar. He allowed that for a brief period of time, a parish might remain on the Old (Julian) Calendar.\n\nThis decision affected not the whole institution, but only to the chapel of the institute.\n\nOverview of the institute's goals and purpose\n\nThe original mandate of the Mohyla Institute was to provide housing for Ukrainian-Canadian students in order to give them the means to achieve a high school diploma, and university entrance qualifications. An additional mandate of the Mohyla Institute was to provide cultural programmes in order to promote the preservation of Ukrainian culture within the Canadian environment. The Mohyla Institute has since become a residence for post-secondary students of all nationalities and backgrounds, while still focussing on the preservation of Ukrainian culture in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Mohyla Institute serves as a home-away-from-home for residents, including those of Ukrainian ancestry, and for students throughout Canada and abroad. Indeed, all students are welcome, whether they are attending university, college or a trades school. The residence is open to all students pursuing post-secondary education at various institutions throughout Saskatoon. Because of the institute's close proximity to the University of Saskatchewan (3 blocks distant), the majority of the residents are enrolled at the university in a variety of programmes.\n\nThe early years of the institute are described in “Iuvileina knyha 25-littia institutu im. Petra Mohyly v Saskatuni” (“Twenty-Five Years of the P. Mohyla Ukrainian Institute in Saskatoon, 1945”).\n\nThe Mohyla Institute continues to honour its Ukrainian roots by providing space for Ukrainian organisations. “Mohyla” has been a long-time supporter of Saskatoon's Orthodox Ukrainian Youth Choir Lastiwka, who call the institute home. “Mohyla” also offers a Ukrainian language immersion programme for high school students in the summer months to continue the mandate of its founders to preserve Ukrainian language and culture. The Mohyla Institute is very involved in the Ukrainian community in Saskatchewan, as well as throughout Canada.\n\nThe time of studying while living at the Saint Petro Mohyla Institute has generally been a life-enriching and even life-changing experience for those who did so. Besides the positive atmosphere provided, the friendships that developed have often been for a lifetime.\n\nPast Rectors of the institute The rectors of the institute include (amongst others) : Wasyl Swystun (1917-1921) Julian Stechishin (1921-1929 ; 1931-1933) Vasyl Burianyk (1932-1935 ; 1936-1937) Ivan Syrnyk (1943-1947) Priest Vasyl Senyshyn (1956-1962) Albert Kachkowski (1970-1979)\n\nParticular Institute information\n\nThis institute is an entity of the Central Eparchy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.
