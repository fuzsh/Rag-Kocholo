        "text": "Even with the Russian–Ukrainian war in the background, in these four books there is plenty of cause for optimism concerning the state of Russian, Ukrainian, and East European scholarship. Readers interested in new interdisciplinary angles for the study of nations and empires will find room for dialogue and a wealth of historiographical knowledge, as well as literary, archival, and periodical research on geography, nationality, and identity.\n\nThe second Socio-cultural Anthropology Conference at Klaipėda University in the spring of 2009 is an expression of the need to understand and discuss the above-mentioned issues of identity politics by presenting ethnographic analyses of particular cases of transnationalism, regionalism and contested borderlands. It was organized by Klaipėda University’s Institute of Baltic Sea Region History and Archaeology and the Center of Social Anthropology of Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas under the title of “Anthropological Approaches to Identity Politics: Focus on Regions, Borderlands and Diasporas”. The conference’s aim was to discuss and elaborate anthropological and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of identity processes and policies from regional, borderland and diasporic perspectives with a special reference to the New Europe and its Baltic component.\n\nThis article analyses the main determinants of the formation of the European identity of Ukraine. Using the historical background of the Ukrainian statehood the author focuses on European cultural and political components inherent to the mentality of Ukrainians. It is proved that Ukrainian regionalism does not separate the population into groups with different mentalities but contributes to the realisation of their specific features. The long absence of statehood caused the detraction of importance of some Ukrainian mental traits, which is why it is only nowadays that the Ukrainian population can be considered to be a conscious nation. This article focuses on the main features that unite Ukrainian people with Europeans: individualism, constitutionalism, democratism, etc. It also analyses the geographical component of Ukraine’s identity, and the current trends in the formation of the latter. The author concludes that the formation of the European identity of Ukraine is possible only ...\n\nSometimes university students question basic assumptions which we as “seasoned academics” take as givens. Such is the origin of these reflections on the origins of ethnic identity and its legitimacy as a legal concept in international law to justify the right to self-determination and the consequent right to formation of an independent, sovereign state. Ukrainian national identity is merely the case I, as the academic, have chosen. For the record, unequivocally I support Ukrainian national sovereignty and Ukrainians as a distinct national group deserving of a homeland of their own. The student raised the question of what distinguishes Kashubians, Silesians, and Poles versus Russians and Ukrainians; and why is it Ukrainians deserve national sovereignty while Kashubians and Silesians do not. I do not attempt to understand the reasons why Kashubians and Silesians have not and do not demand a separate nation-state from Poland. The student’s question did raise an academic question though, which as pedantic as it seems, ebbed into the question of the international legal grounds upon which the US supports Ukraine in its current war with Russia. Sometimes, encouraging critical thinking amongst our students can be both enlightening and aggravating.\n\nThe present paper investigates and problematises how the discourse of Ukraine's national identity is being constructed. The transformation of Homo Sovieticus into Homo Europeicus, which consists in the modification of the old boundaries of Ukraine with the Soviet Union, along with the delimitation of new ones within the European Union, is traced on both the tangible (material) and conscious psychological) levels. Due to historical, geopolitical and ethnopsychological factors, various material and mental objects, signs, and notions encapsulating and radiating Soviet ideology, are being replaced with new signs and notions restoring a version of the Ukrainian, pre-Russian past, and simultaneously projecting Ukraine's European future.\n\nAn overview of Ukraine interms of nationhood and identity, and how this impacts upon current events in Ukraine, particularly with regards to Euromaidan and the on-going conflict. Much focus is given to linguistics and historical memory and interpretation and how this effects and creates divisions within Ukraine. Furthermore, the question of a European Ukraine is looked at, particularly in the current conflict context."
