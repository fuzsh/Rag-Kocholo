Aycock examines Lesia Ukrainka's play Kaminnyi hospodar in comparison with some of the previous versions of the Don Juan legend, such as those by Tirso, Moli√®re, Mozart and Pushkin, and states that even though Lesia Ukrainka "works within the frame of the legend and makes use of its basic elements", she creates at the same time "a substantially new version, one that reflects her own artistic viewpoints." Aycock discusses the setting and plot of the play, the theme of freedom, the scenes of seduction, the dinner invitation to the stone statue, the stone imagery and the motif of disguise, but - in his view - "it is Lesia Ukrainka's conception and development of her characters that seem to make her drama strikingly different from the previous versions of the legend."

Bio-bibliographical note about Iurii Badz'o (born 1936) with a focus on his dissident activity. (14 lines).

A044. Badz'o, Iurii. "Badzyo protests new harassment. Denied visit to mother, 82." Smoloskyp. 8.36 (Winter 1987): 7-8. port.

A memoir of Iurii Badz'o about how he "was given permission to take leave from exile and spend one month in the village of Kopynivtsi in Transcarpathian Region" to visit his 82-year-old mother, and how this permission was revoked upon his arrival in Kiev. With an editorial note and a b/w portrait of the author.

A045. Badz'o, Iurii. "An open letter to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU from citizen of the Ukrainian SSR, Iurii Vasylovych Badzo." / Tr. from the Ukrainian by Roman Senkus. Journal of Ukrainian Studies. 9.1 (Summer 1984): 74-94 and 9. 2 (Winter 1984): 47-70.

The open letter is a summary of Badz'o's unfinished work "The Right to Live", the manuscript of which was confiscated in February 1979 during a police search of the author's apartment. According to Badz'o, "taday's party-state ideology and policies in the sphere of national relations deprive the Ukrainian nation... of its fundamental and decisive right - the right to live." The author discusses what are in his view "conditions of ideological ethnocide, political injustice, cultural second-ratedness, and spiritual inadequacy" forced upon Ukrainian people. Badz'o calls attention to the fact that government policies in the USSR have "resulted in the substantial forcing-out of the use of Ukrainian in all spheres of life" in Ukraine. He cites statistics and examples of Russification in education, in book publishing, in historical scholarship, in literature, theater and film, as well as instances of "endless repressions of those Ukrainians who oppose Russification..."

Translation of a letter written by Iurii Badz'o from his exile in Yakutia to the weekly Literaturna Ukraina. The letter, dated 5 December 1987, demands from the leadership of the Writers' Union of Ukraine to begin the process of civic rehabilitation of Vasyl' Stus, a poet who, according to Badz'o, spent 13 years "in concentration camps behind barbed wire and in exile" and died "on the night of 2nd-3rd March 1985, in his prison cell in the Urals." In Badz'o's view, Stus's place "comes close to that of Shevchenko". Badz'o proposes that Stus's works, hitherto available only outside of the USSR, be published and that the 6th of January 1988, Stus's 50th birthday, be marked on the pages of Literaturna Ukraina as the first step in the poet's rehabilitation. The letter is accompanied by a brief note from UCIS.

With a brief editorial note.

A054. Bahrij-Pikulyk, Romana. "The individual and history in the historical novel: P. Kulish's The Black Council." Canadian Slavonic Papers. 24. 2 (June 1982): 152-160.

Chorna Rada by Panteleimon Kulish has attracted attention primarily as a social study, says Bahrij-Pikulyk, and only Borys Neiman tried in 1927 "to demonstrate that The Black Council was a historical novel in the tradition of Sir Walter Scott." Bahrij-Pikulyk attempts to vindicate Neiman's classification in this article based on her 1978 University of Toronto doctoral dissertation entitled "Taras Bulba and The Black Council: Adherence to and divergence from Sir Walter Scott's historical novel pattern."

A055. Bahrij-Pikulyk, Romana. "Superheroes, gentlemen or pariahs? The Cossacks in Nikolai Gogol's Taras Bulba and Panteleimon Kulish's Black Council." Journal of Ukrainian Studies. 5. 2 (Fall 1980): 30-47.

The author distinguishes between historical romances that "present illusionary worlds in which the heroes remain heroes and succeed in all sorts of incredible adventures and where the action consists of a fantastic succession of events", and historical novels that focus "on common, everyday, middle class reality", have "a non-heroic hero, a plot that issues from character, and a deromanticizing style." She discusses at length Gogol's Taras Bulba which is classified as a historical romance, and P. Kulish's Chorna rada, which is, in the author's view, a historical novel with a historical framework.

A056. Bahrij-Pikulyk, Romana. "The use of historical sources in Taras Bulba and The Black Council." Studia Ucrainica. 2(1984): 49-64.

A revised and expanded version of a paper presented at the Canadian Association of Slavists' Conference at the University of Ottawa in June 1982. Kulish's The Black Council, says the author, was written as a refutation of and challenge to Gogol's Taras Bulba. "The only feature that these two works share is the romantic subject matter of the cossacks; yet, while Gogol's treatment of this subject is romantic, Kulish's is not. Taras Bulba is an inflationary, subjective and thoroughly romantic work written in the tradition of romance, whereas The Black Council is a deflationary and critical work belonging to the tradition of the Realist novel," says Bahrij-Pikulyk. Gogol's approach was mythical and subjective; Kulish, on the other hand, "made wide use of a variety of Ukrainian and non-Ukrainian historical and ethnographic sources", and the author makes an attempt to document this.

A057. Bahry, Romana. "J.J. Rousseau's √âmile and P. Kulish's views on education." In Working Order: Essays Presented to G.S.N. Luckyj. Ed. by E.N. Burstynsky and R. Lindheim. Journal of Ukrainian Studies. 14.1/2 (Summer/Winter 1989): 57-79. Biblio.

"Like Rousseau, who in his √âmile provides not just a manual on education but a 'philosophical treatise on the nature of man', Kulish in his Letters and other essays presents his views on education in a philosophical framework which addresses such issues as the nature of man, ethics, and freedom," says Bahry. She claims that Kulish's views on the goodness of human nature and the dichotomy between the "heart" and the false exterior "are largely derived from Rousseau". Kulish's innovation, according to Bahry, "lies in his addition of the national dimension to education..."

A058. "Baidebura, Pavlo." Encyclopedia of Ukraine. 1 (1984): 160.

Fourteen lines of bio-bibliographical data about Pavlo Baidebura (born 1901), author of short stories and books for children.

A061. Balan, Jars. "Some notes towards the writing of a history of the Ukrainian literary institution in Canada." Canadian Review of Comparative Literature. 16.[3/4] (September-December 1989): 745-762. Biblio. (Special issue: Literatures of lesser diffusion).

An overview of the development of Ukrainian literature in Canada which, in Balan's view, "has been characterized by fairly consistent growth and a steady movement towards greater sophistication. Essentially, each generation of immigrants has made a distinctive contribution to the evolving literary culture and tradition and in the process transforming Ukrainian-Canadian belles-lettres from a cottage industry to a semi-professional activity." The scope of the article is limited to literary works written originally in Ukrainian. Rather than enumerating the works and authors who constitute the body of this literature, Balan offers critical observations on various trends and characteristics and makes a number of detailed suggestions for what he considers to be much needed critical studies and English-language anthologies of this literature still to be published.

A062. Balan, Jars. "Ukrainian writing". Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature. Gen. ed.: William Toye. Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1983. 807-810.

A critical survey of Ukrainian literature in Canada from the first poem published in Ukrainian by Ivan Zbura (dated 1898) to the contemporary Ukrainian novelist Ulas Samchuk. Balan surveys the literary contributions of Ukrainians against the different social backgrounds of the four waves of Ukrainian immigration to Canada and singles out for special attention an anthology of indigenous Ukrainian folk poetry Pisni pro Kanadu i Avstriiu (1908; 4th ed. under a changed title in 1927) which sold over 50,000 copies; Paul Crath (Krath) (1882-1952), "perhaps the most interesting writer of the pioneer generation", Andrii Babiuk (1897-1937), also known under his literary pseudonym Myroslav Irchan, who, according to Balan, "wrote much that enriches both the tradition of Ukrainian writing in Canada and the larger Canadian literary heritage", Illia Kyriiak (Kiriak) (1889-1955), the author of Syny zemli, "a well-told story that chronicles many of the important stages in the development of Ukrainian-Canadian life" and Ulas Samchuk (born 1905), "the foremost living author among the post-war immigrants." Other writers are mentioned briefly. Balan notes the role of the writers' association "Slovo" and devotes a separate paragraph to Ukrainian-Canadian authors writing primarily or exclusively in English.

A063. Balla, Gyula. "The poetry of the Ukrainian 'New Wave'." Acta Litteraria Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae. 25. 3-4 (1983): 387-394.

The poets of the 1960's "had to shoulder the responsibility of restoring the respectability of poetry", says Balla. The article concentrates on the work of Ivan Drach, "the most accomplished member of this group of poets." "In Ivan Drach's poetry, we can witness a peculiar interpretation and renewal of the balladistic form that transcends the genre as it is," says the author. Interspersed with some unattributed translated fragments of Drach's poetry [q.v.T077]. With a note about historical antecedents and about Ukrainian writers outside of Ukraine proper.

A080. Benedek, Andr√°s S. "Some stylistic and thematic peculiarities of the contemporary Ukrainian prose." Acta Litteraria Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae. 26. 1-2 (1984): 291-296.

A critical analysis of 20th century Ukrainian prose and its major trends. Benedek writes about the "heroic Romanticism depicting an idealized reality" of an earlier era and the "poetic prose that could express the life of the heart..." of the 1960's. He mentions the "ascetical" short story and documentarist novels and discusses the 'traditional historical novel" and the innovative historical novel, which can "beside the epic evocation of the past, detect the social and psychological processes that underlie the historical events". He writes about the intellectual or psychoanalytical prose which "poses the most pressing questions of our days" and is especially impressed with the "chimerical prose" which in Ukraine grew out of "rather rich and viable" "traditions of a grotesque realism". According to Benedek, "the chimerical novel that aspires toward higher peaks of literature does nothing else but reestablishes the once broken continuity of literary development arching from Kotlarevski through Kvitka-Osnovyanenko up to the writers of the present day, thereby incorporating a forgotten store of national culture." A number of writers are mentioned, some in unusual Hungarian transliteration: i.e. Khirir Tyutyunnik, Ievhen Khutsalo, Oles Khonchar, Pavlo Zakhrebelni and others.

Mykola Khvyl'ovyi's short story "Redaktor Kark ", written two years earlier than his pamphlets, expresses a number of ideas that were later integrated into Khvyl'ovyi's polemical articles, says Bennett. She focuses on Khvyl'ovyi's methods of conveying his political beliefs through the structure, plot and symbolism of "Redaktor Kark ", discussing such things as the narrative organization and style of the short story, the impressionistic scenes and encounters, and the symbolic images used to convey observations and feelings.

A number of Honchar's books are mentioned with an emphasis on the writer's popularity among his readers. The following brief passage is typical of this long article's style and substance: "The novel Tronka holds a special place in Honchar's legacy. Using literary devices characteristic only of his style, the author describes endless steppes of Ukraine and its people. 'For me, reading Tronka,' writes worker Shilyaev from Donetsk, 'was like listening to music that moves you and fills your soul with the joy of life. The author has put a great deal of emotion into his creation, and it is truly a paean to the laborers of our land - honest, hard-working people."

There is no mention in the article of Honchar's novel Sobor.

"Honchar's artistic development has paralleled a growth in national self-awareness, " says Bird. "Despite his status as a pillar of Communist society, he has dealt in a forthright manner with moral dilemmas in his wartime and war-focused pieces, and with the question of cultural vandalism by unsympathetic bureaucrats in his postwar writing." Honchar's masterpiece - the novel Sobor , according to Bird, "is an indictment of the Russian authorities and their Ukrainian minions who are oblivious to the values of the Ukrainian past and ruthless in uprooting them." Honchar, says Bird, "has taken as his civic and literary task a serious, longterm, unrelenting assessment of his nation's present and past, distinguishing the healthy impulses from the pernicious, and postulating spiritual absolutes as the inescapable answer to current problems."

Bulgaria, says Birnbaum, "not only provided the linguistic vehicle for transfering a rich and sophisticated body of writing to Kievan Rus'.... but, in addition, the Bulgarian men of letters, by having selected, absorbed, and assimilated a specific portion of the Byzantine literary legacy, largely determined, at least initially, also the kind, amount, and content of literature that would find its way to the relatively small group of readers among the Eastern Slavs." The Serbian impact on Old Rus', according to Birnbaum, "came later than the Bulgarian influence... " but was of even broader scope "since it affected not only the language and literature of Old Rus' but also its remarkable religious art."

"By viewing feminism as a striving toward individualism and self-esteem, Kobylianska strengthened the pragmatic bent of Ukrainian women, creating role models for them," says the author. This biographical study of Ol'ha Kobylians'ka (1863-1942) analyzes at some length the writer's feminist novel Tsarivna and discusses some of her other works. It provides also, as a background, additional silhouettes of the writers Uliana Kravchenko (Nementovs'ka) born Julia Schneider (1861-1947) and Ievheniia Iaroshyns'ka (1868-1904).

A study of life and work of Ivan Vahylevych, a member of the "Ruthenian Triad", who - together with Markiian Shashkevych and Iakiv Holovats'kyi - was responsible for the publication in 1837 of Rusalka Dnistrovaia, the first Ukrainian language literary anthology in Galicia. Unlike the other two, "Vahylevych was almost forgotten even before he died. Since then, only his association with these two friends of his youth has saved him from total oblivion," claims the author. According to Brock, the opinion that Vahylevych "became a renegade working against his own people" is "grossly unfair", because "Vahylevych remained until his death what he had always been - a Ukrainian cultural nationalist bent on defending the independent status of his native language and literature..."

A157. Carynnyk, Marco. "Poetry and politics." Studia Ucrainica. 4 (1988): 23-31.

Most of Ukrainian poetry, says Carynnyk, is programmed poetry, i.e. it expresses a certain ideology, and programmed poets "have a dangerous tendency to veer off into codified abstractions". The Eastern European tradition of seeing the poet as a national bard and conservative tastes of Ukrainian reading public make for a greater popularity of programmed poetry. Vasyl' Stus's poetry, says Carynnyk, is "unprogrammed, intensive rather than extensive, lyric rather than epic." His poetry is dominated by the Rilkean theme of the artist finding his essence "in a communion with the world and with things, so complete that it appears to be an interpenetration." Vasyl' Stus, according to Carynnyk, "refused to place his poetic talent at the service of any party or ideology." His life, his persecution by the Soviet regime and his death in a Soviet labor camp, however, prove how difficult is the distinction between pure and engaged poetry. The refusal of any political mission, says Carynnyk citing Hans Magnus Enzensberger, is of itself a political mission. The article is illustrated with two Stus's poems in the original Ukrainian and in Carynnyk's English translation. [See T550].

This, in Cracraft's view, leads to a far larger question: "how much of the huge corpus that has been ascribed to him - twenty-five or thirty poems, the five-act play Vladimir, voluminous treatises on poetics, rhetoric, philosophy, theology, fifty-eight sermons and speeches, numerous other works of a historical, devotional, legal, polemical, or quasi-official nature, including Pravda voli monarshei - did he in fact write?" Cracraft concludes that attribution of any work to Prokopovych "can no longer be considered certain" and proposes "a method of resolving the question of attribution with respect to his works in Russian"

"As a literary phenomenon, Antonyc is mainly a creation of his native land..." says Olena Duc. "Having once fallen under the spell of the mountains, having drunk of their heady fragrance, having been burned by the mountain sun, Antony_ would forever remain 'the poet of nature and the sun', the boy 'holding the sun in his hand', in love with life and spring and creating poetry pregnant with hot, burning emotions. The passionate enjoyment of life mixed with a certain pagan quality - the 'divinization' of nature and the sun, the pantheistic freedom of his thought - are characteristic of the people of the mountains who live simple lives 'near to the sun', that accord with nature's own rhytm".
