        "text": "How can I find credible sources?\n\nWhen writing a research paper, it is crucial to use and cite only credible sources. But what makes a source credible? And how and where can you find credible sources? Below are 7 suggestions on how to search and find credible sources:\n\nMake sure that the sources you use are not too old or out of date. There might be a more recent paper with new and better insights on your topic than the one from 10 years ago.\n\nResearch papers, books, and articles that are written by well-respected authors\n\nIf an author has a good reputation and is well-known in their field, it is highly likely that the source can be trusted.\n\nSources that you find at your university's library\n\nIn general, sources that you find at your university's library are credible, be it books, scholarly journals, articles, music recordings or DVD's. But be aware that your university's library can also have popular media, which may not be a credible source of information.\n\nSources from online scholarly databases\n\nOnline library databases are probably one of the best sources of articles from scholarly journals to which you will have access. Your library will most likely be subscribed to multiple online databases and provide information on how to access them. Credible online scholarly databases are also:\n\nPubMed\n\nWeb of Science\n\nScopus\n\nJSTOR\n\nScience\n\nERIC\n\nGovernment websites\n\nWebsites that end with .gov, .edu, .ac, are generally considered credible sources. Examples of reliable websites are:\n\nScience.gov\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nUK Office for National Statistics\n\nUS Census Bureau\n\nSources from newspapers\n\nMore caution is required when considering using news articles, as the reliability of news sources available online varies significantly. Good sources that can generally be trusted are, for example:\n\nThe Economist\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe New York Times\n\nPolitico\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nSources from social networks, blogs, and sites like Youtube or Vimeo\n\nWith sources like social networks, blogs, etc., it really depends. They may or may not be highly biased, insufficiently researched, and not well written. These sources should be checked thoroughly before being used in an academic paper.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about credible sources"
