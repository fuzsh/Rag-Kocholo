        "text": "Join the effort to create accurate and comprehensive profiles of research institutions around the world.\n\nSince 2009, Clarivate has been profiling the world’s leading universities and research institutions using an exclusive set of key performance indicators for our Global Institutional Profiles Project.\n\nInstitutional Profiles facilitate a multidimensional and unbiased comparison of several aspects of a university’s performance regardless of the university’s mission, size, geographical location or subject mix. Combining gold-standard bibliometric information with unique data on reputation, demographics and funding creates a 360-degree view of an institution.\n\nThese Profiles are used by universities, funding agencies, governments and rankings agencies as a valuable tool to identify weaknesses and strengths, compare to global or regional benchmarks and to promote achievements to their stakeholders.\n\nEvery university that contributes to the Global Institutional Profile Project receives a complimentary profile report. Clarivate validates the data and applies powerful analytical techniques to interpret and present the data in a meaningful way.\n\nInform leadership of research performance\n\nCirculate the report to university leadership and across departments to support strategic decision-making.\n\nPost the report to internal websites, newsletters or share with potential collaborating institutions.\n\nAssist students and faculty in the selection of your institution\n\nFreely post the profile report and use the data within for marketing and promotional activities that elevate your institution.\n\nFor institutions that are ranked in U.S. News & World Report Global Universities Rankings and participated in the Profile Project, enrollment numbers are displayed on the main Rankings page and a supplemental University Data tab is made available on the U.S. News profile page.\n\nConduct more rigorous assessments in InCites\n\nSubmit the report with national research assessments or funding proposals.\n\nAccess your profile data alongside article-level and aggregated data in the InCites Benchmarking & Analytics platform that can be used to assess the impact and influence of researchers, departments, institutions, regions, funders and journals."
