        "text": "NORC is an independent affiliate of the University of Chicago, with whom we partner on a wide variety of research. More than half of the NORC Board of Trustees is composed of UChicago faculty members.\n\nOur official name is NORC at the University of Chicago. Please refer to us “NORC at the University of Chicago” on first reference and “NORC” on subsequent references.\n\nNORC is pronounced as a word – “nork” – not as an acronym.\n\nNORC was once known as the National Public Opinion Center, but we no longer use that name. Our mission is much broader than that now.\n\nYes. We have a variety of print- and broadcast-quality materials and visuals that we can share for use with news articles. Tell us what you need.\n\nWe conduct nonpartisan social science and public opinion research. Our political polling is done strictly on a nonpartisan basis and not for political parties or organizations. The range of topics we cover is reflected in the five main areas of our work:\n\nEconomics, Markets, and the Workforce\n\nEducation, Training, and Learning\n\nGlobal Development\n\nHealth and Well-Being\n\nSociety, Media, and Public Affairs\n\nThough NORC should be referred to in news stories and academic articles as “NORC at the University of Chicago,” our legal name is National Opinion Research Center. We are also registered to do business as “NORC.” NORC is an independent 501(c)3 research corporation and is not a part of the University of Chicago."
