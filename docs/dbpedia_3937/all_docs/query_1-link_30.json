The google scholar algorithm chooses only the second part of my name as my \"last name\", even when the journal has published my work as Doe Smith, Jane. Instead Google Scholar will present it as JD Smith.\n\nIs there anything I can do? Any way to contact Google Scholar, or fix it myself? I'm assuming the answer is to just live with it. I thought about just publishing under Jane Doe or Jane Smith from now on, but I've already published a lot under my name, and realistically, if I were to pick one I'd want it to be Doe, which may confuse the system that always wants to pick Smith."
