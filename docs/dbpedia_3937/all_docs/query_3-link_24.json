Peter Deutsch while they were computer science students at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.\n\nIt started as a local network-based searchable database of file names of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) archives.\n\nThe first commercial version of Archie—a complete rewrite of the software—was made available in October of 1992 by Emtage and Deutsch who had by then founded Bunyip Information Systems.\n\n1991\n\nVeronica\n\nUsed for searching Gopher protocol servers, Veronica was built by Steven Foster and Fred Barrie while at the University of Nevada in the US. Gopher is a read-only network file system consisting of hierarchical hyperlinkable menu items (similar to a web page) and was invented by Mark McCahill at the University of Minnesota in the US.\n\nVeronica provided keyword search of a database of menu items from files on Gopher servers. Named after a character, Veronica Lodge, created by US comic book publisher Archie Comics.\n\nJughead\n\nDeveloped by Rhett Jones at the University of Utah in the US, Jughead also used the Gopher protocol but would search only a single server at a time.\n\nAnd yes, it was also named after a character created by Archie Comics.\n\n1992\n\nThe World Wide Web Virtual Library or VL\n\nBuilt by the inventor of the world wide web and Londoner Tim Berners-Lee.\n\nIt was the first catalogue or directory of the world wide web and comprised of topic experts maintaining lists of links to quality resources.\n\nYou can still browse a version of The WWW Virtual Library today.\n\n1993\n\nWorld Wide Web Wanderer\n\nDeveloped by Matthew Gray, it was the first bot ever built and was designed to measure the growth of the web by counting active web servers.\n\nIt created one of the first indexes called the Wandex and was eventually upgraded to include URLs.\n\nW3 Catalog\n\nCreated by Oscar Nierstrasz at the University of Geneva, it mirrored web resources linked to by high-quality web directories, reformatted the content and provided front-end dynamic querying.\n\nAliweb\n\nDutch software engineer Martijn Koster’s early search engine did not use a bot instead relying on website owners to submit pages they wanted indexing.\n\nKoster also created the Robots Exclusion Standard which allowed website owners to block access to bots at a domain or individual page level.\n\nJumpStation\n\nThe first complete search engine to use bots to build and maintain an index made up of document titles and headings and offer a web form for users to search the index using keywords — how modern search engines work.\n\nCreated by Jonathan Fletcher from Scarborough, North Yorkshire while working at the University of Stirling in Scotland.\n\nEventually abandoned due to lack of investment and server space(!).\n\nWorld Wide Web Worm\n\nDeveloped by Oliver McBryan at the University of Colorado in the US, it was the first implementation of a search engine which used the anchor text in a backlink to characterise the page it points to.\n\nIt would eventually be cited as an influence in Larry Page’s patent for PageRank.\n\nBack to top of page\n\n1994\n\nJerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web or Yahoo!\n\nUS-based Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang start their own directory formed from their favourite web pages.\n\nSensibly re-named Yahoo! —after that race of brutish creatures from Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels— it quickly expanded and uniquely offered a human authored description with each url.\n\nToday Yahoo! is still a thriving brand, powered by Microsoft’s Bing and owned by US multinational telecoms giant Verizon.\n\nWebCrawler\n\nBuilt by Brian Pinkerton WebCrawler was the first search engine to use bots to crawl and index entire web pages which has become the standard ever since. Users could search for any word on any webpage on the world wide web.\n\nBought by America Online in 1995 who would then sell WebCrawler to Excite in 1997. Eventually acquired by InfoSpace in 2001 when Excite (@Home) went bankrupt.\n\nToday WebCrawler is a meta search engine blending results from Google, Yahoo! and ‘other popular search engines’.\n\nLycos\n\nAfter starting as a research project by Michael Mauldin Lycos launched with a catalogue of 54,000 documents.\n\nIt provided results based on ranked relevance retrieval, prefix matching and word proximity.\n\nLycos became the fastest IPO from inception to offering in 1996. Bought by South Korea-based Daum Communications in 2004 who then sold Lycos to India-based Ybrant Digital in 2010.\n\nInfoseek\n\nFounded by Steve Kirsch, Infoseek started as a pay-for-use service but quickly became free post-launch. It uniquely allowed webmasters to submit a page for listing in real-time.\n\nIt became the default search provider for the then popular Netscape browser in 1995 and following this went public 1996.\n\nInfoseek was bought by Walt Disney in 1998 and became Go.com. The technology behind Infoseek was then eventually bought by Inktomi in 2000.\n\nEx-Infoseek engineer Robin Li co-founded (and is current Chairman and CEO of) the China-based search engine Baidu.\n\nArchitext or Excite\n\nUsing statistical analysis of word relationships, Architext was a project by Graham Spencer, Joe Kraus, Mark VanHaren, Ryan McIntyre, Ben Lutch and Martin Reinfried all from Stanford University in the US.\n\nExcite was formally launched in 1995 with an IPO quickly following in 1996. Bought by broadband provider @Home in 1999. Bankrupt in 2001 and acquired by InfoSpace.\n\n1995\n\nAltavista\n\nBased on an initial idea by Paul Flaherty; Louis Monier wrote the web crawler and Michael Burrows the indexer.\n\nIt was the first search engine to allow natural language queries, had unlimited bandwidth and allowed users to add or delete a url within 24 hours.\n\nAltavista was bought by Overture in 2003 which was then bought by Yahoo! in the same year.\n\nHomebase or LookSmart\n\nFounded in Melbourne, Australia, Homebase was majority owned by Reader’s Digest but was bought back from them by original founders Evan Thornley and Tracey Ellery; re-located to California and re-branded as LookSmart; signed deal with Microsoft to provide search services in 1998; Nasdaq-100 IPO in 1999.\n\nA popular early alternative web directory to Yahoo! LookSmart is still operating today as a ‘premier search advertising network and management company’.\n\nBack to top of page\n\n1996\n\nHotBot\n\nCan this type of bot really be hot? Who are we to judge?\n\nWired magazine release its HotBot search engine served by the Inktomi database and LookSmart and after that DMOZ directories.\n\nLycos acquired HotBot as part of its Wired magazine buy-out in 1998 and would eventually sell the hotbot.com domain name in 2016 for $155,000 to an anonymous buyer. Inktomi would be bought by Yahoo in 2003.\n\nHyperlink Search Engine or RankDex\n\nRobin Li establishes RankDesk which uses backlinks to measure the quality and popularity of websites it is indexing. It uses the actual keywords in the anchor text of links pointing to a webpage to identify relevance.\n\nRankDesk was also cited as an influence in Larry Page’s patent for PageRank.\n\nBackRub\n\nCollaboration by Larry Page and Sergey Brin so named because it could count and analyse citation notation or backlinks pointing to a given site.\n\nThe anchor text and backlink data gathered for a given website or page would eventually be converted into a measure of importance by an algorithm called PageRank.\n\nAsk Jeeves\n\nAsk Jeeves was founded by Garrett Gruener and David Warthen from Berkeley, California in the US.\n\nNamed after P. G. Wodehouse’s brilliant valet it was heavily marketed as an ‘answer engine’ and a more human way to search.\n\nIt would go public in 1999 but then be bought by InterActiveCorp in July 2005 with Jeeves retiring to become ask.com in 2006.\n\nAsked to carry on, Jeeves made a comeback on the UK and Irish editions of the site in 2009.\n\nIBM MedSpeak Radiology\n\nIBM launches MedSpeak the first commercially available product capable of recognising continuous speech.\n\nSeznam\n\nBased on a catalogue of the best Czech web pages to visit Ivo Lukačovič launches Seznam (or list).\n\nFuelled by the revenue from banner advertisements Seznam quickly added people search, a free email service and a news portal. In 2000, Lukačovič sold a 30% share to the Swedish portal, Spray International which became Lycos Europe.\n\nLike PageRank, Seznam uses a 0-10 ranking scale for its websites called S-Rank.\n\nLatest reports suggest that Google and Seznam share 50%-50% of desktop search in the Czech Republic, with Google dominating mobile searches. However, with new ventures such as a detailed wind map aimed at sailors and surfers called Windy it looks like Lukačovič and Seznam are going to continue to lead the way in terms of the range and innovation of services offered to users.\n\nBack to top of page\n\n1997\n\nYandex\n\nArkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich launch their search engine, Yandex or ‘Yet Another Indexer’ at the Softool exhibition in Moscow.\n\nYandex floated on the Nasdaq-100 in 2011 and is still Russia’s leading desktop search engine, just.\n\nGoogle is rapidly eating into Yandex’s lead thanks in part to its domination of searches from mobile devices using its Android OS\n\nGoogle.com\n\nLarry Page registers the domain name Google.com on September 15.\n\nBack to top of page\n\n1998\n\nGnuhoo or NewHoo or Open Directory Project or DMOZ\n\nCreated by Rich Skrenta as Gnuhoo then renamed NewHoo and when acquired by Netscape, the Open Directory Project also known as DMOZ (breathe).\n\nIt would become the largest internet directory and was run almost entirely by volunteer editors.\n\nOfficially closed in March 2017 but a version still exists http://dmoz-odp.org/.\n\nGoTo.com\n\nLaunched by Bill Gross, GoTo was the first company to allow advertisers to bid against each other auction-style to secure placement at the top of search results for specific search terms. Pay-Per-Click (PPC) or paid-for search advertising was born.\n\nGoTo would become Overture Services in 2001 and form strategic partnerships with Microsoft and Yahoo! before acquiring Altavista and AlltheWeb.\n\nIt would eventually be taken over by one of its partners Yahoo! in 2003.\n\nGoogle\n\nAfter the buzz created by BackRub Larry Page and Sergey Brin launch Google based on their unique PageRank technology.\n\nIn the words of Google themselves ‘PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.’\n\nThe first Google index of the world wide web contained 25 million pages.\n\nMSN Search\n\nMicrosoft launches MSN Search based on the Inktomi database which would be replaced by LookSmart and then AltaVista.\n\nBack to top of page\n\n1999\n\nAlltheWeb\n\nBased on a doctorate thesis by Tor Egge, AlltheWeb was completely customisable, had a bevy of advanced search options and featured search clustering. Bought by Overture in 2003.\n\nNaver\n\nNaver (from ‘Navigator’) was the first South Korean search portal to use an internally developed search engine.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that today Naver is the predominant internet-based company in South Korea it’s more difficult to get an accurate figure of its pure search engine market share.\n\nCurrently, Dublin-based StatCounter suggests that Google has caught up considerably with just over 67% of the search market, while KoreanClick says that Naver has 74%.\n\nBack to top of page\n\n2000\n\nBaidu\n\nBased on Robin Li’s pioneering RankDesk technology, Baidu was co-founded with Eric Xu.\n\nFrom launch Baidu allowed users to bid for ad space and charged them for every click through.\n\nAccording to StatCounter Baidu’s search market share in China today is 76.05% of an estimated internet-user population of 731 million.\n\nGoogle AdWords\n\nGoogle launches its first advertising service based on a CPM or cost-per-mille model meaning that advertisers paid per thousand impressions of their ad.\n\nGoogle would quickly move to a pay-per-click auction style model and go on to develop Quality Score to better determine the relevancy (and quality) of ads to search terms and their landing pages.\n\nNaver – Comprehensive search\n\nThe first company to develop blended search results, Naver adds blogs, websites, images and businesses in its result pages.\n\nGoogle index\n\nGoogle’s index hits one billion unique pages.\n\nGigablast\n\nBuilt by Matt Wells formerly of Infoseek, Gigablast is an open source search engine written in allowing for real-time indexing of websites.\n\nGoogle Tool Bar — PageRank Opens to the public\n\nGoogle launches its browser-based toolbar providing access to its search technology from any web page. Also included was a PageRank indicator.\n\nSuddenly PageRank wasn’t just available to those in the know, anyone who had a website could see what theirs was and, perhaps more tellingly, what their competitors was. Websites now had a value placed on them, out of 10, by Google.\n\nA major accelerant for the SEO industry as it is today, Google has spent the last five years talking down the importance of PageRank.\n\nBack to top of page\n\n2001\n\nGoogle image search\n\nGoogle launches a service allowing users to search the web for images.
