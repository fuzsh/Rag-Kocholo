To change settings in Google Scholar, click on the three line icon at the top left corner of the page and select the gear icon/settings link.\n\n2.On the settings page, click on Library Links. Search for \"University of Wyoming\" and mark it as one of your library access links. Save your settings.\n\nYou should now see Full Text @ UW links next to article citations when you search Google Scholar. Be aware that not all articles will be available at UW. If the article is not available, you will need to use Interlibrary Loan to obtain a copy.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nYou can also adjust Google Scholar settings to export citations to RefWorks or other citation managers. On the Search Results page in Scholar Settings, under \"Bibliography manager,\" mark the box next to \"Show links to import citations into . . .\" and select your citation manager. UW offers RefWorks and EndNote Web citation managers; both require that you set up a free account (see below). Check Google Scholar exports for errors; Google Scholar is not as structured as library databases.\n\nWhile Google Scholar can be a good resource, the results may not be as current or credible as the resources provided by the UW Libraries. Our database vendors attempt to identify all the literature in a field, but many of these resources are unavailable to Google Scholar."
