        "text": "Search engine optimization (SEO) very much revolves around Google today.\n\nHowever, the practice we now know as SEO actually predates the world’s most popular search engine co-founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nAlthough it could be argued that SEO and all things search engine marketing began with the launch of the first website published in 1991, or perhaps when the first web search engine launched, the story of SEO “officially” begins a bit later, around 1997.\n\nAccording to Bob Heyman, author of Digital Engagement, we can thank none other than the manager of rock band Jefferson Starship for helping give birth to a new field that we would grow to know as “search engine optimization.”\n\nYou see, he was quite upset that the official Jefferson Starship website was ranking on Page 4 of some search engine at the time, rather than in Position 1 on Page 1.\n\nGranted, we may never know if this tale is more revisionist history or 100% fact, all signs definitely point to the term SEO originating around 1997.\n\nDo a little more hunting around and you’ll see John Audette of Multimedia Marketing Group was using the term as early as February 15, 1997.\n\nRanking high on search engines in 1997 was still a pretty new concept.\n\nIt was also very directory-driven.\n\nBefore DMOZ fueled the original Google classification, LookSmart was powered by Zeal, Go.com was its own directory, and the Yahoo Directory was a major player in Yahoo Search.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with DMOZ, the Mozilla Open Directory Project (remember, Mozilla was a company and Moz was a brand well before SEOMoz), it was basically a Yellow Pages for websites.\n\nThis is what Yahoo was originally founded upon; the ability to find the best websites out there as approved by editors.\n\nI started doing SEO in 1998, as a need for our clients who have built cool sites but were getting little traffic.\n\nLittle did I know it would become a lifestyle.\n\nThen again, the World Wide Web was still a pretty new concept at the time to most people.\n\nToday? Everybody wants to rule the search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nSearch Engine Optimization vs. Search Engine Marketing\n\nBefore Search Engine Optimization became the official name, other terms were used as well:\n\nSearch engine placement.\n\nSearch engine positioning.\n\nSearch engine ranking.\n\nSearch engine registration.\n\nSearch engine submission.\n\nWebsite promotion.\n\nBut no discussion would be complete without mentioning another term…\n\nSearch Engine Marketing.\n\nAt one point in 2001, one prominent industry writer suggested search engine marketing as a successor to search engine optimization.\n\nObviously, it didn’t happen.\n\nPrepare yourself now; you’re going to see many false claims (e.g., “SEO is dead,” “the new SEO”), and attempts at rebranding SEO (e.g., “Search Experience Optimization”).\n\nWhile SEO as a term isn’t perfect – after all, we aren’t optimizing search engines, we’re optimizing our web presence – it has remained the preferred term of our industry for more than 20 years now and likely will be for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs for Search Engine Marketing?\n\nIt is still used but is now more associated with paid search marketing and advertising.\n\nThe two terms co-exist peacefully today.\n\nA Timeline of Search Engine History\n\nSearch engines have changed the way we find information, conduct research, shop for products and services, entertain ourselves, and connect with others.\n\nBehind almost every online destination – whether it’s a website, blog, social network, or app – is a search engine.\n\nSearch engines have become the connecting force and directional guide to everyday life.\n\nBut how did this all start?\n\nWe’ve put together a timeline of notable milestones from the history of search engines and search engine optimization to understand the roots of this technology, which has become such an important part of our world.\n\nDawn of SEO: ‘The Wild West’ Era\n\nIn the last decade of the 1900s, the search engine landscape was highly competitive.\n\nYou had your choice of search engines – both human-powered directories and crawler-based listings – including the likes of AltaVista, Ask Jeeves, Excite, Infoseek, Lycos, and Yahoo.\n\nIn the beginning, the only way to perform any kind of SEO was through on-page activities.\n\nThis included optimizing for factors such as:\n\nMaking sure the content was good and relevant.\n\nThere was enough text.\n\nYour HTML tags were accurate.\n\nYou had internal links and outbound links.\n\nIf you wanted to rank well in this era, the trick was pretty much just repeating your keywords enough times throughout your webpages and meta tags.\n\nWant to outrank a page that uses a keyword 100 times? Then you’d use the keyword 200 times!\n\nToday, we call this practice spamming.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\n1994\n\nYahoo was created by Stanford University students Jerry Wang and David Filo in a campus trailer. Yahoo was originally an Internet bookmark list and directory of interesting sites.\n\nWebmasters had to manually submit their page to the Yahoo directory for indexing so that it would be there for Yahoo to find when someone performed a search.\n\nAltaVista, Excite, and Lycos also launched.\n\n1996\n\nPage and Brin, two Stanford University students, built and tested Backrub, a new search engine that ranked sites based on inbound link relevancy and popularity.\n\nBackrub would ultimately become Google. HotBot, powered by Inktomi, also launched.\n\n1997\n\nFollowing on the success of A Webmaster’s Guide to Search Engines, Danny Sullivan launched Search Engine Watch, a website dedicated to providing news about the search industry, tips on searching the web, and information about how to rank websites better.\n\n(Ten years later, after leaving SEW, Sullivan founded another popular search publication, Search Engine Land, and he now works at Google.)\n\nAsk Jeeves also debuted and Google.com was registered.\n\n1998\n\nGoto.com launched with sponsored links and paid search. Advertisers bid on Goto.com to rank above organic search results, which were powered by Inktomi. Goto.com was ultimately acquired by Yahoo.\n\nDMOZ (the Open Directory Project) became the most sought-after place for SEO practitioners to get their pages listed.\n\nMSN entered the space with MSN Search, initially powered by Inktomi.\n\n1999\n\nThe first-ever all search marketing conference, Search Engine Strategies (SES), took place. You can read a retrospective on that event by Sullivan here.\n\n(The SES conference series continued running under various monikers and parent companies until shutting down in 2016.)\n\nThe Google Revolution\n\nIn 2000, Yahoo pulled off the worst strategic move in the history of search and partnered with Google and let Google power their organic results instead of Inktomi.\n\nBeforehand, Google was a little-known search engine. Hardly known!\n\nThe end result: every Yahoo search result said “Powered by Google” and they ended up introducing their largest competitor to the world and Google became a household name.\n\nUntil this point, search engines mainly ranked sites based on the on-page content, domain names, ability to get listed in the aforementioned directories, and basic site structure (breadcrumbing).\n\nBut Google’s web crawler and PageRank algorithm were revolutionary for information retrieval.\n\nGoogle looked at both on-page and off-page factors – the quantity and quality of external links pointing to a website (as well as the anchor text used).\n\nIf you think about it, Google’s algorithm was essentially about “if people are talking about you, you must be important.”\n\nAlthough links were only one component of Google’s overall ranking algorithm, SEO practitioners latched onto links as being the most important factor – and an entire sub-industry of link building was created.\n\nOver the next decade, it became a race to acquire as many links as possible in the hopes of ranking higher.\n\nLinks became a heavily abused tactic that Google would have to address in coming years.\n\nIt was also in 2000 that the Google Toolbar became available on Internet Explorer, allowing SEO practitioners to see their PageRank score (a number between 0-10).\n\nThis ushered in an era of unsolicited link exchange request emails.\n\nSo with PageRank, Google essentially introduced a measure of currency to its linking. Much like domain authority is misused today.\n\nGoogle’s organic results also got some company in the form of AdWords ads starting in 2000.\n\nThese paid search ads began appearing above, below, and to the right of Google’s natural (i.e., unpaid) results.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of webmasters informally got together at a pub in London to start sharing information about all things SEO in 2000.\n\nThis informal gathering eventually turned into Pubcon, a large search conference series that still runs today.\n\nOver the coming months and years, the SEO world got used to a monthly Google Dance, or a period of time during which Google updated its index, sometimes resulting in major ranking fluctuations.\n\nAlthough Google’s Brin once famously said Google didn’t believe in web spam, his opinion had probably changed by the time 2003 rolled around.\n\nSEO got a lot harder following updates like Florida because it became much more important than just repeating keywords X amount of times.\n\nGoogle AdSense: Monetizing Terrible SEO Content\n\nIn 2003, after acquiring Blogger.com, Google launched AdSense, which serves contextually targeted Google ads on publisher sites.\n\nThe mix of AdSense and Blogger.com led to a surge in simple, monetized online publishing – and a blogging revolution.\n\nWhile Google probably didn’t realize it at the time, they were creating problems they would have to fix down the road.\n\nAdSense gave rise to spammy tactics and made-for-AdSense sites filled with thin/poor/stolen content that existed solely to rank well, get clicks, and make money.\n\nOh and something else important happened in 2003.\n\nI founded the site you’re on, Search Engine Journal!\n\nAnd I’m incredibly happy to say we’re still here, going stronger than ever.\n\nLocal SEO & Personalization\n\nAround 2004, Google and other top search engines started improving results for queries that had a geographic intent (e.g., a restaurant, plumber, or some other type of business or service provider in your city or town).\n\nBy 2006, Google rolled out a Maps Plus Box, which I was quite impressed with at the time.\n\nIt was also around 2004 that Google and search engines began making greater use of end-user data, such as search history and interests, to personalize search results.\n\nThis meant that the results you saw could be different than what someone sitting next to you in a coffee shop saw when he or she did a search for the same query.\n\nAlso in 2005, nofollow tags were created as a means to combat spam.\n\nSEO pros began using this tag as a way of PageRank sculpting.\n\nGoogle also unleashed a couple of noteworthy updates:\n\nJagger, which helped to diminish the level of unsolicited link exchanges that were flying around, as well as heralding the decline in the importance of anchor text as a factor due to its corruptibility.\n\nBig Daddy (coined by Jeff Manson of RealGeeks), which improved the architecture of Google to allow for an improved understanding of the worth and relationship of links between sites.\n\nYouTube, Google Analytics & Webmaster Tools\n\nIn October 2006, Google acquired user-generated video sharing network YouTube for $1.65 billion, which ultimately became the second most used search property in the world.\n\nToday, YouTube has 2 billion users!\n\nDue to its soaring popularity, video SEO become crucial for brands, businesses, and individuals that wanted to be found.\n\nGoogle also launched two incredibly important tools in 2006:\n\nGoogle Analytics. This free, web-based tool was so popular at launch that webmasters experienced downtime and maintenance warnings.\n\nGoogle Webmaster Tools. Now known as the Search Console, Google Webmaster Tools let webmasters view crawling errors, see what searches your site showed up for, and request re-inclusion.\n\nAlso in 2006, XML sitemaps gained universal support from the search engines.\n\nXML sitemaps allow webmasters to display to the search engines, every URL on their website that is available for crawling.\n\nAn XML sitemap contains not only a list of URLs but a range of further information, which helped search engines to crawl more intelligently.\n\nUniversal Search\n\nWe really began to see search starting to evolve in new and exciting ways starting in 2007.\n\nAll of these updates were aimed at improving the search experience for users.\n\nLet’s start with Google’s Universal Search.\n\nUntil this point, the search results had consisted of 10 blue links.\n\nThen Google began blending traditional organic search results with other types of vertical results like news, video, and images.\n\nThis was easily the biggest change to Google search – and SEO – since the Florida update.\n\nCleaning up the Cesspool\n\nIn 2008, then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt said the Internet was becoming a cesspool and that brands were the solution. “Brands are how you sort out the cesspool,” he said.\n\nLess than six months after his comment, along came a Google update called Vince.\n\nBig brands suddenly seemed to be ranking a whole lot better in the SERPs.\n\nBut it wasn’t really intended to reward brands, according to Google.\n\nGoogle wanted to put greater weight on trust in the algorithm (and big brands tend to have more trust than smaller and less-established brands).\n\nShortly after this update, Google released another to improve the speed of their indexing, called Caffeine.\n\nAs Search Engine Journal reported at the time, Caffeine was “a next-generation search architecture for Google that’s supposed to be faster and more accurate, providing better, more relevant results and crawling larger parts of the web.”\n\nSpeaking of speed, in 2010 Google announced that site speed was a ranking factor.\n\nBing & The Search Alliance\n\nIn 2009, Microsoft Live Search became Bing.\n\nThen, in an attempt to challenge Google’s nearly 70% grip of the U.S. search market, Yahoo and Microsoft joined forces to partner on a 10-year search deal (though it ended up being reworked five years later).\n\nThe Search Alliance saw Microsoft’s Bing power Yahoo’s organic and paid search results.\n\nWhile it made Bing the clear Number 2 search engine, they have ultimately failed to break Google’s massive grip on search in the U.S. and globally. In October 2020, Bing officially rebranded to Microsoft Bing.\n\nThe Rise of Social Media\n\nAnother phenomenon was emerging late in the 2000s: social networks.\n\nGoogle made its big bet on YouTube (although it would try again with the now-defunct Google+).\n\nBut other networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn all emerged as major players (with many more to come and go in the following years).\n\nAlong with the rise of social media came speculation that social signals can impact search rankings.\n\nYes, social media can help SEO, but indirectly – just as other forms of marketing can help drive more traffic to your website and increase brand awareness and affinity (which generates search demand).\n\nWhile the impact of social shares (likes, tweets, +1’s, etc.) has been denied time and again by Google through the years as being a ranking factor, it continued to be listed as having a strong correlation in various ranking factor studies.\n\nIf you want to read more about this topic, I highly suggest reading How Social Media Helps SEO [Final Answer].\n\nSchema\n\nSchema markup, a form of microdata, was introduced in 2011 to help search engines interpret the context of the query. You can view every schema markup type on Schema.org.\n\nSchema is not a ranking factor. And, there is little evidence to support it has an impact on your search performance.\n\nHowever, schema does help you stand out in the SERPs with rich and featured snippets.\n\nFor example, in a Search Engine Journal webinar, Milestone shared they saw a 33-66% boost in search impressions for large fast-food restaurant chain locations after schema was deployed.\n\nAnother experiment by InLinks revealed that sites with schema gained rankings once schema was implemented.\n\nIf you’re unsure if you properly implemented structured data, test it in Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool.\n\nThe Google Zoo: Panda & Penguin\n\nTwo major algorithmic updates – Panda in 2011 and Penguin in 2012 – had a big impact on SEO that is still being felt to this day, as Google once again attempted to clean up its search results and reward high-quality sites.\n\nIn 2011, Google found its search results facing severe scrutiny because so-called “content farms” (websites that produced high volumes of low-quality content) were dominating the search results.\n\nGoogle’s SERPs were also cluttered with websites featuring unoriginal and auto-generated content – and even, in some instances, scraper sites were outranking content originators.\n\nAs a result, these sites were making tons of advertising revenue (remember when I mentioned Google’s self-made AdSense problem?).\n\nThese sites were also living and dying by organic traffic from Google.\n\nBut once Google’s Panda update rolled out in 2011, many websites saw much, if not all, of that traffic vanish overnight.\n\nGoogle provided some insight on what counts as a high-quality site.\n\nAimed at eliminating low-quality (or thin) content, Panda was updated periodically over the coming years, eventually becoming integrated into Google’s core algorithm in 2016.\n\nWith websites still recovering from the effects of Panda, Google unleashed a hotly anticipated over-optimization algorithm, intended to eliminate “aggressive spam tactics” from its results.\n\nEventually dubbed Penguin, this algorithm targeted link schemes (websites with unusual linking patterns, including a high-amount of exact match anchor text that matched keywords you\n\nwanted to rank for) and keyword stuffing.\n\nPenguin wasn’t updated nearly as frequently as Panda, with more than a year passing between some updates. And, like Panda, Penguin became part of Google’s real-time algorithm in 2016.\n\nThings, Not Strings\n\nIn May 2012, Google unveiled the Knowledge Graph.\n\nThis was a major shift away from interpreting keywords strings to understanding semantics and intent.\n\nHere’s how Amit Singhal, Google’s former SVP for engineering, described it at launch:\n\n“The Knowledge Graph enables you to search for things, people or places that Google knows about – landmarks, celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, celestial objects, works of art and more – and instantly get information that’s relevant to your query. This is a critical first step towards building the next generation of search, which taps into the collective intelligence of the web and understands the world a bit more like people do.”\n\nGoogle enhanced its search results with this information.\n\nKnowledge panels, boxes, and carousels can appear whenever people do a search for one of the billions of entities and facts in the Knowledge Graph.\n\nThe next step in Google’s next generation of search came in September 2013 in the form of Hummingbird, a new algorithm designed to better address natural language queries and conversational search.\n\nWith the rise of mobile (and voice search), Google needed to completely rebuild how its algorithm worked to meet the needs of modern searchers.\n\nHummingbird was considered to be the biggest change to Google’s core algorithm since 2001. Clearly, Google wanted to deliver faster and more relevant results, especially to mobile users.\n\nMobile-First\n\nStarting somewhere around 2005 or so, one question kept being asked in our industry:\n\nIs this the “Year of Mobile”?\n\nWell, it turns out that it wasn’t in 2005.\n\nOr 2006.\n\nNeither was 2007.\n\nOr 2008. Or 2009.\n\nNot even 2010 – when Google transformed itself into a mobile-first company.\n\nThen 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 came and went.\n\nMobile was talked about and much-hyped because it was growing like crazy all this time.\n\nAs more users adopted smartphones, they were increasingly searching for businesses and things while on the move.\n\nFinally, in 2015, we had the Year of Mobile – the point at which mobile searches overtook desktop search for the first time on Google. And while this is true in terms of raw search numbers, it’s also true that search intent is quite different and conversion rates remain much lower on mobile devices.\n\nThis was also the year that comScore reported mobile-only internet users surpassed desktop-only users.\n\nIt was also in 2015 that Google launched a much-anticipated mobile-friendly algorithm update, designed to give users “the most relevant and timely results, whether the information is on mobile-friendly web pages or in a mobile app.”\n\nIn an attempt to speed up pages, Google also introduced Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) in 2016.\n\nThe idea behind AMP was to instantly load content. Many news media and publishers quickly adopted AMP and continue to use it today.\n\nAnd, this may not surprise you, but in January 2017, Google announced that page speed will now be a ranking factor for mobile searches.\n\nIn that same month, Google stated it will begin to devalue pages with intrusive pop-ups.\n\nIn July 2019, mobile-first indexing was enabled for all new websites. And, by March 2021, all websites will have switched to mobile-first indexing.\n\nMachine Learning & Intelligent Search\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that Google, originally built around information retrieval, became a mobile-first company.\n\nWell, that changed in 2017 because Google CEO Sundar Pichai declared Google a machine learning-first company.\n\nToday, Google search is designed to inform and assist, rather than giving users a list of links.\n\nThat’s why Google has built machine learning into all of its products – including search, Gmail, Ads, Google Assistant, and more.\n\nIn terms of search, we’ve already started to see the impact of machine learning with Google RankBrain.\n\nAnnounced in October 2015, RankBrain was initially used to try to interpret the 15% of searches that Google has never seen before, based on the words or phrases the user has entered.\n\nSince that time, Google has expanded RankBrain to run on every search.\n\nWhile RankBrain impacts ranking, it isn’t a ranking factor in the traditional sense, where you get rewarded with better rankings for doing x, y, and z.\n\nAnd there’s much more coming soon in the world of intelligent search.\n\nVoice searches are increasing.\n\nVisual search has gotten insanely good\n\nUsers (and brands) are increasingly adopting chatbots and using personal assistants (e.g., Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana).\n\nThese advances in technology mean more exciting times are ahead for those who do SEO.\n\nGoogle’s Core Updates\n\nGoogle makes updates to its algorithm every day.\n\nBut, throughout the year, Google releases core updates when there is a change to its algorithm.\n\nThere are also broad core algorithm updates.\n\nThe goal of these core updates is to create a better search experience for users with more relevant, trustworthy search results.\n\nThese Google core updates don’t target a certain page or site but aim to improve how the system tracks content.\n\nHere’s how Google described these core updates:\n\n“One way to think of how a core update operates is to imagine you made a list of the top 100 movies in 2015. A few years later in 2019, you refresh the list. It’s going to naturally change. Some new and wonderful movies that never existed before will now be candidates for inclusion. You might also reassess some films and realize they deserved a higher place on the list than they had before.”\n\nIn March 2018, Google confirmed a broad core algorithm update had rolled out to benefit “under-rewarded” pages.\n\nA little over a month later, Google released another broad core algorithm update targeted at content relevance.\n\nThen, another broad core update rolled out in August (sometimes wrongly and inaccurately referred to as the “Medic” update) targeting sites with low-quality content.\n\nIn March 2019, as an extension of the August 2018 core update, Google confirmed that a core update (a.k.a., Florida 2) was here and it was supposed to be a big one.\n\nBut, the SEO community felt it was more of a rollback of previous algorithms.\n\nAnd, another broad core update hit in June 2019 that exposed weaknesses of E-A-T on websites, focusing on the authority and trustworthiness of incoming links.\n\nEvery now and then, Google will release a broad core update that has an impact on all search results worldwide.\n\nFor example, there was a broad core update in September 2019 that aimed at boosting sites with overall optimal performance. And, another broad core update in January 2020 that targeted YMYL (your money, your life) categories.\n\nThat’s the key difference with broad core updates vs. core updates – you need to analyze your site overall, not a specific page.\n\nMost recently, Google released a core update in May 2020 that targeting thin content landing pages while giving a boost to local search results.\n\nBERT\n\nBERT is the biggest Google algorithm update since RankBrain.\n\nBERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers used for natural language processing.\n\nEssentially, it helps Google understand the context of search queries better.\n\nFor example, the word “bat” can mean a nocturnal winged animal often associated with Batman. Or, it can be used when a baseball player goes up to bat.\n\nWith BERT, Google is able to dissect the context to serve up better search results.\n\nWhat makes BERT even better is that Google can now use the words surrounding your keywords to help its spiders digest your content.\n\nFor example, “I went to in the bat cave.” Or, “After my bat, I went into the dugout.” Google can now generate a context model around other words in the sentence. This is a crucial factor in how natural language processing identified human communication.\n\nAs Google’s Danny Sullivan said:\n\n“There’s nothing to optimize for with BERT, nor anything for anyone to be rethinking. The fundamentals of us seeking to reward great content remain unchanged.”\n\nIf you’re still interested in learning more about BERT, Dawn Anderson explains everything you need to know about BERT here.\n\nFeatured Snippets\n\nYou’ve probably seen featured snippets before, but not realized what they were.\n\nFeatured snippets are short text, bullet points, numbers, or tables that appear at the top of Google’s search.\n\nThe goal of a featured snippet is to answer the searcher’s query directly in the SERPs without needing to click through to the website.\n\nBut, featured snippets can be extremely volatile so tread lightly.\n\nFeatured snippets are nothing new. They were spotted all the way back in 2014.\n\nFeatured snippets have kicked off the allure of the coveted “position zero.” Meaning, your search result is featured above all the other distractions in the SERPs, plus you would also appear in the organic results.\n\nIn January 2020, Google updated this feature to de-duplicate featured snippet search results so you would either be included in the featured snippet or the organic result, not both.\n\nAnd, in June 2020, Google released another update stating that featured snippets will now take users directly to the text that is relevant to their search query.\n\nUsers now see the text highlighted in yellow.\n\nAs voice search continues to refine itself, featured snippet content will provide a big opportunity to increase organic visibility.\n\nConclusion\n\nSearch engines and SEO have come a long way since the 1990s.\n\nWe’ve only touched on a few of these ways in this post.\n\nThe history of SEO has been filled with exciting turns – the birth of new search engines, the death of old search engines, new SERP features, new algorithms, and constant tests and updates – plus the emergence of great SEO publications, conferences, tools, and experts.\n\nWhile search engines and SEO have evolved greatly over the years, one thing remains true: as long as there are search engines, SEO will remain vital.\n\nAnd we’ve only gotten started!"
