To stay informed in the most timely way, however, you should consider subscribing to the Summon listserv.\n\nYou might also be looking for:\n\nThe status of the Summon Index in relation to content changes you are expecting to appear in Summon.\n\nSystem Status Page providing updates on system availability, known performance issues and more.\n\nThe Release Preview Environment where you can view your Summon instance with the changes that will be included in the next release.\n\nRecordings of Summon Update sessions presented by the product management team.\n\nThe Ideas Exchange page where you can post, vote, and comment on what you feel is important to further Summon development.\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\nBelow are some details for features and improvements in the current release. This summary applies to Summon, Summon over Alma, Sierra via Summon, and Summon API customers. The Summon preview environment for this release was available on July 24.\n\nEnhancements:\n\nSave Items between Sessions: NERS Enhancement\n\nUsers can permanently save items to their Google, Microsoft, and Ex Libris cloud drives if users are signed-in. For more information, see Saving Items (Citations).\n\nTo enable this feature, set the new Saved Items Enabled parameter to ON on the Summon Admin Console > Settings > Advanced Search page.\n\nBulk Export for Search Results: NERS Enhancement\n\nThe Bulk export of search results (up to 1000) functionality, which has been available for several preview releases, is now available in Production and includes the following changes based on your feedback:\n\nTranslations for email subject, report title, and default email message text.\n\nReturn a URL for the Summon search result in the BookMark field in the .csv export report instead of the bookmark hash.\n\nReturn the standardized date format YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nClearer messaging for the 1000 item limit.\n\nFor more information, see Exporting Search Results and Saved Citations.\n\nReplace Summon Auto-Scroll with Pagination:\n\nTo address a critical accessibility concern, we have removed the “infinite” or auto-scroll navigation for search results and now provide paged results of either 10 or 25 items per page.\n\nYou can configure whether to display 10 or 25 results per page by configuring the Default Number of Search Results parameter on the Summon Admin Console > Settings > General page.\n\nVerbatim Search Operator for Exact Matching: NERS Enhancement\n\nUsers can now disable linguistic features (such as stemming, spelling/casing/character normalizations and synonyms) to match exact phrases verbatim. This is done by adding an equals sign (=) after the closing double quote of an exact phrase. Examples:\n\n\"sea otter\"= – Disables pluralization to retrieve results that include the exact phrase sea otter and not sea otters.\n\n\"theatre\"= – Disables spelling variations to retrieve results that include the exact phrase theatre and not theater.\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nEnhancements:\n\nAs a reminder, Bulk Export will be available in Production in the August release. We’ve made a number of enhancements for the Preview environment based on your feedback and have additional ones scheduled.\n\nReturn a URL for the Summon search result in the BookMark field in the .csv export report instead of the bookmark hash.\n\nReturn the standardized date format YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nBulk export email not sent for some language results (CJK, Russian).\n\nResolved Issues:\n\nSummon Quick Look pane was prefixing the 590 note with the text MARC_.\n\nA hash tag in a notes field broke the text into separate lines in the display.\n\nSearch Scopes were missing translations for the following labels: Collections to search for and You are about to leave.\n\nSummon over Alma only: the language parameter in the link to My Account was not resolving correctly.\n\nJune 5, 2024\n\nBelow are some details for various fixes and and improvements. This summary applies to Summon, Summon over Alma, Sierra via Summon, and Summon API customers.\n\nEnhancements:\n\nThe Summon Notes field was removed from the default search fields in November 2023 for performance reasons. We implemented a new solution for libraries that want to search Notes by default, in addition to the existing “Notes:” syntax and dedicated Notes index in the Advanced Search options.\n\nIf you would like Notes fields searched by default, please open a case with Support to enable this feature.\n\nThis applies to Summon UI users as well as Summon API users.\n\nAPI users, please see Include Notes Matches on the Ex Libris Developer Network\n\nNew authentication option: Summon now supports the ability to immediately redirect users to a SAML login rather than the Summon splash page if they are not already IP authenticated. This scenario is primarily for secured, private libraries but can be used by any Summon customer. Please contact support if this is an option you’d like to enable.\n\nNormalized Subject headings now display in alphabetical order.\n\nThe default value of the s.include.ft.matches API parameter is changing to false to be consistent with the default behavior of the Summon UI. Setting it to false helps return more focused search results for users.\n\nResolved Issues:\n\nCustomizer: missing translation in preview environment - \"This item cannot be requested\" for Summon via Sierra libraries.\n\nFor some customers a subset of titles linked to the OPAC instead of the Summon details page.\n\nLibrary Notes (5XX) displays incorrectly due to hash character.\n\nThe permalink label pop-up in Summon obscures the \"x\" to close the permalink pop-up.\n\nSummon via Sierra users cannot access My Library Card if there are no checked-out items on their account.\n\nRemoved the errant “Leave Site?” prompt when attempting to save changes to the Summon Admin Console > Pages > Sections page.\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release as well as various fixes and and improvement. This summary applies to Summon, Summon over Alma, Sierra via Summon, and Summon API customers. The Summon preview environment for this release was available on April 17.\n\nEnhancements:\n\nBulk Export of Search Results: NERS Enhancement from the Idea Exchange\n\nPreview only! This will not be released to production on May 1. We are interested in gathering feedback from the Summon community before finalizing feature details. Please provide feedback by submitting a new Support case or by posting to the Summon Listserv.\n\nBulk export allows users to download the results (up to 1000) of a search query in one action, as opposed to exporting titles individually. The results are sent to the designated email address in a .csv file with commonly used metadata fields.\n\nTo enable this feature, go to Summon Administration Console (Preview version only) > Settings > Search Results and enable the new parameter Allow Download Search Results.\n\nOnce enabled, when a search query yields 1000 or fewer results a new button labelled “Export Results” will appear at the top of the results list.\n\nIf the query yields more than 1000 results the, button will not appear.\n\nSelecting Export Results opens a new form that asks for a mandatory email address, optional message text, and a reCAPTCHA confirmation the first time patrons use the feature in a session.\n\nAfter submitting the form, a confirmation message appears on the screen for several seconds. Depending on the size of the file, it may take several minutes to reach the email account.\n\nDisplay Full Title on Hover: NERS Enhancement from the Idea Exchange\n\nTo provide more clarity and context to users with smaller screens and screen resolutions, hovering over the title of a result will now display the full title.\n\nAuto-enable Quicklinks\n\nWith the May release, we will enable Quicklinks for all Summon libraries automatically! Why? Quicklinks, which have been live since 2021, enable users to go directly to the full text with one click to either a PDF or HTML file. Quicklinks have a 99% linking accuracy rate to more than 1.5 billion records and are supported by many providers.\n\nTo support this feature, the Auto Activate Quicklinks May 2024 parameter has been added to the Settings page (Summon Administration Console > Settings > Search Results):\n\nIf you currently have Quicklinks enabled, take no action.\n\nIf you want to enable Quicklinks on May 1, take no action.\n\nIf you do NOT want to Quicklinks enabled automatically, set the Auto Activate Quicklinks May 2024 parameter to OFF.\n\nAfter the May release, you may opt out of using Quicklinks at any time.\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release as well as various fixes and and improvement. This summary applies to Summon, Summon over Alma, Sierra via Summon, and Summon API customers. Please note that there is no Summon preview environment for this release.\n\nEnhancements:\n\nSummon + Canvas LTI Integration\n\nSummon + Canvas clients are now able to take advantage of LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability), a standard that helps securely integrate learning management systems with remote platforms. Once the integration is configured in both systems, Canvas users (instructors and students) can access full text content in Summon directly from Canvas without the need for a proxy or other authentication system.\n\nThis integration supports the following workflows:\n\nA Canvas administrator can make a Summon Canvas app available to instructors.\n\nA Canvas course instructor can:\n\nAdd the library’s Summon URL to the course as a virtual tool.\n\nAdd a bookmark to a specific record in Summon with appropriate descriptive text.\n\nAdd a Summon search URL.\n\nA course participant can\n\nView Summon records (bookmarks).\n\nLaunch search results in Summon from the pre-defined URL as an authenticated library user (i.e. no additional proxy or login required).\n\nAuto-enable Quicklinks\n\nWe are preparing to enable Quicklinks for all Summon libraries in May! Why? Quicklinks, which have been live since 2021, enable users to go directly to the full text with one click to either a PDF or HTML file. Quicklinks have a 99% linking accuracy rate to more than 1.5 billion records and are supported by many providers.\n\nPlease note that you may opt out of using Quicklinks any time you want.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nIf you currently have Quicklinks enabled, take no action.\n\nIf you do not already have Quicklinks enabled, the new setting (above) will default to On in the February release. For now this is information only. Once the May release is live:\n\nQuicklinks are automatically enabled if this parameter’s value is On.\n\nQuicklinks are disabled if you change the parameter’s value to Off.\n\nNotes Search Field in Summon Advanced Search\n\nThere is now a dedicated field for searching notes in the Advanced Search interface. You can add “Notes” to the list of visible fields in Summon Administration Console > Settings > Advanced Search. Enabling this field will make the field appear in the options in the order specified.\n\nBy default these fields are included in the Notes search, but each library may have customized the mapping:\n\n500 $a, 502 $a$b$c$d$g$o, 362 $a $z; 506 $a$b$c$d$e; 510 $a$b$c; 511 $a; 518 $a; 530 $a$b$c$d; 533 $a$b$c$d$e$f$m$n; 534 $p$a$b$c$e$f$k$l$m$n$t; 538 $a$i; 583 $a$b$c$d$e$f$h$i$j$k$l$n$o$x$z\n\nResolved Issues\n\nOn the \"Cited by\" tab trying to scroll beyond the Default Number of Search Results yielded a “Citations failed to load. Please try again.\" message. This is now resolved.\n\nTranslations:\n\nNew: “(Search Scope) All”\n\n“Retracted Publication” now accurately displays the translated phrase\n\nNew: “Secondary Content Type”\n\nSoA Real Time Availability: “Available” now successfully translates\n\nNovember 1, 2023\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release as well as various fixes and an improvement. These enhancements include:\n\nSend Summon Language Settings to 360 Link: NERS Enhancement from the Idea Exchange\n\nSummon will now pass the language parameter from the results page to 360 Link to better ensure that the returned page is in the same language.\n\nNo configuration is required.\n\nNormalized Subject Headings: A CDI Update\n\nAll English language subject headings in CDI have been mapped and deduped against LCSH (Library of Congress Subject Headings) and MeSH (NIH Medical Subject Headings).\n\nInstitutions can now use these headings for their subject facet in place of the current.\n\nSubject headings that could not be mapped, including all non-English subjects, are still available for display when the new normalized subject headings are in use.\n\nTo configure the use of Normalized Subject Headings for your facets, you’ll find the controls in the Admin Console, under Settings > Subject Terms:\n\nFor the control Use Normalized CDI Subjects, switch from Default to Custom and set the field to ON.\n\nClick the Save Settings button and within 5 minutes the update should be applied to your instance of Summon.\n\nTo display subject headings that could not be normalized on the Quick Look pane, you will find the controls in the Admin Console under Settings > Quick Look.\n\nTo display the keywords, switch the Display Keywords control from Default to Custom and set it to ON.\n\nWhen enabled Keywords can be dragged/dropped to prioritize their order and determine if they as expanded/collapsed.\n\nClick the Save Settings button and within 5 minutes the update should be applied to your instance of Summon.\n\nScopes Update\n\nBased on your feedback, we have updated how Scopes are represented in the Summon UI.\n\nFacets applied as part of a Scope are now displayed at the top of the Facet Pane.\n\nChanging any of the parameters for the scope will now display a warning dialog box that the user is about to leave the selected scope.\n\nFor more information about using Scopes, see Summon: Search Scopes. For configuration information, see Summon: Administration Console: Settings.\n\nDisplay 5xx Notes Fields: NERS Enhancement from the Idea Exchange\n\nThis functionality will require mapping and content processing for your specific institution before any content is available for display in your instance of Summon.\n\nInstitutions will now be able to display 5xx notes fields on the Quick Look panel in the Summon search results page.\n\nTo enable the display of the 5xx Notes field in Quick Look, you’ll find the controls in the Admin Console under Settings > Quick Look.\n\nSwitch the Display Library Notes control from Default to Custom and set it to ON.\n\nWhen enabled Library Notes can be dragged/dropped to prioritize their order and determine if they as expanded/collapsed.\n\nClick the Save Settings button and within 5 minutes the update should be applied to your instance of Summon.\n\nThe Summon Notes field was removed from the default search fields in November 2023. As a result, local catalog metadata mapped into the Notes field can no longer be searched from the basic search field. Instead, Summon users can search in the Notes field using the field search syntax (for example, Notes:\"some notes\"). The notes field will be added to the Advanced search drop-down options in February 2024.\n\nUnpaywall Indexing\n\nUnpaywall functionality is being updated: Unpaywall will now be available as a collection you can subscribe to in Client Center. For more information, see Summon: Unpaywall Database.\n\nUnpaywall will now be an option under the Database facet.\n\nRecords merged with Unpaywall records will be flagged as having an Open Access (OA) option; this will improve OA labeling and faceting on the search results page.\n\nIndexed Unpaywall links will be returned by CDI as regular IEDL links and will be prioritized using standard linking logic.\n\nUnpaywall links will be returned as the \"Link to PDF\" element on the Summon search result when there is no available Quick Link.\n\nAdding Unpaywall to your instance of Summon will follow the same process as adding any other collection to Summon.\n\nPrevent Ebook and Computer File Records from Merging: NERS Enhancement from the Idea Exchange\n\nAny records marked as a Computer File will no longer be merged with other records.\n\nThis feature requires no configuration.\n\nBecause this feature requires content updates, the changes will be made as the appropriate collections with affected records are refreshed.\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release as well as various fixes and an improvement.

These enhancements include:\n\nCitation Search Improvements using GROBID Algorithm, Based on AI/Machine Learning:\n\nMany users search for known items by copying and pasting entire citations from a webpage or a list into a Summon search box. While Summon already supports a majority of these searches, we still had cases where extra information in these searches confused the algorithm and prevented items from being found. We now use an Open Source AI tool called Grobid to parse the search query so that Summon can find and return the cited items in search results. Our test results show that this has solved all reported cases where these searches previously failed.\n\nPublication Date Normalization: Select the Best Publication Date for Rights, Faceting and Display:\n\nSometimes metadata for an article from different sources has different dates, leading to confusion when all dates are searchable but only one is displayed. Because this issue is usually caused by individual participants in a merged record, we have changed how the merged date is determined and used for article type records. We will now prefer the date provided by a majority of data sources and use this single date for facets, display, and rights calculation. In cases where a single date does not hold the majority, we will use the latest date.\n\nCitation Trail and Web of Science Display Improvements:\n\nWe adjusted the presentation for both Citation Trail and Web of Science.\n\nCitation Trail links are now buttons, to conform to other elements in the brief result.\n\nWeb of Science is now spelled out and indicates the link will take users to a different website.\n\nAdditional Fixes and Improvements:\n\nAdded support back for links generated from the legacy Advanced Search page (URL containing the advanced#!/search? syntax).\n\nIncluded results for matches in the DEWEY field when a user specifies \"Call Number\" in the Summon Advance Search.\n\nLeading character in translated strings are no longer automatically converted from lower to upper case.\n\nAdded translations for the Course Reserves page.\n\nOn the Advanced Search form, the translated ‘1 Year’ publication date filter button text is now displayed on two lines to match the other publication date filter buttons.\n\nIf you have any questions about Summon, please contact Support by using chat options (360 chat; Intota chat) or by submitting a case through the Support Portal.\n\nFebruary 1, 2023\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release as well as various fixes and and improvement.

Some subject terms kept in records for archival purposes or from a specific institution that could be objectionable for your institution or patrons could display in facet values.

For a brief video overview, see The New Summon Experience.\n\nFor any feedback or requests for improvements we received from the preview environment that hasn’t been implemented in this release, we are planning on including them in the February 2022 release. We will provide more details as part of the 2022 roadmap.\n\nDisplay All Links – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nAbility to display all available links for full text content.\n\nInstitutions can determine how many links they would like to display.\n\nFor configuration information, see the Maximum Full Text Link Options field in Summon: Administration Console: Settings - Search Results.\n\nDirect access to PDFs via Quicklinks\n\nLinks to the PDF or HTML full text directly from the results list.\n\nCreated centrally and do not use the link resolver.\n\nIf available, Summon presents Quicklinks first, and then relies on current linking priority if Quicklinks are not available.\n\nWorks with selected providers. For a complete list, see Quicklinks Provider List.\n\nFor more information and how to configure this functionality, see Quicklinks in Summon.\n\nEnhanced Did You Mean? – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nAutomatic search based on corrected term (current implementation searches on original query and user must use a secondary link to search the corrected term).\n\nAbility to execute original search via secondary link.\n\nNew Identifier Fields with exact match added to Advanced Search – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nIndividual fields available on the Advanced Search page has been expanded and include the following: Call Number, ISBN, ISSN, CODEN, Dewey, DOI, OCLC Number, Patent Number, EAN, EBSCOAN, ERIC, ISMN, LCC, NAICS, ORCID, PCID, PMID, PQID, PQPubID, SSID, UPC, DUNS, and SICI.\n\nDue to the number of fields now available, the Search All option has been removed; patrons can still search all fields by selecting them individually, but the response may be slower due to the nature of the search.\n\nTo enable these fields:\n\nSwitch the Custom Search Fields Enabled field to Custom under Settings > Advanced Search in the Summon Admin Console.\n\nSelect Options to expand the list of available fields.\n\nDrag a tile from disabled to enabled to add it to your advanced search page or the reverse to remove it.\n\nClick Save at the bottom of the page. Your changes should be visible in Preview within 5 minutes.\n\nAn update to Call Number to support this improvement requires a search index update to make this visible, in either production or preview; as such, if you activate the Call Number search prior to December 17 (the first expected search index update after the release), you may not see any results; after December 17 it should perform as expected.\n\nImproved Database Recommender Management Tools\n\nBatch processing now available for Database Recommender changes.\n\nDownload a CSV of your current configurations, edit the file via a spreadsheet program and upload your changes.\n\nInstitutions can activate or deactivate databases for inclusion in Database Recommender and add or remove tags.\n\nNew: Institutions can assign priority to listed databases; if multiple databases could be recommended, the top two prioritized databases will be displayed; if no priority exists, recommendations will be made using the current criteria.\n\nTo start using this improved tool:\n\nFind this tool under Settings > Recommender > Databases in the Summon Admin Console.\n\nSelect Show CSV import / export options to access the tool and for further instructions.\n\nAdditional Fixes and Improvements:\n\nSummon remote authentication banner now supports the OpenAthens Redirector.\n\nHTTPS Support:\n\nIn the past, we’ve given sites the option to force a redirect to HTTPS for all non-secure (HTTP) links; in order to better secure our shared environment, as part of the December release, we will require all Summon sites use HTTPS for more secure connections.\n\nBeginning with this release all Summon URLs will be delivered via HTTPS; any existing links or widgets using HTTP will be automatically be redirected to an HTTPS connection.\n\nThis does not affect Summon API users, only the Summon User Interface.\n\nAugust 4, 2021\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release as well as various fixes and improvement. As always, your participation in the Idea Exchange and the NERS voting process for 2020 helped shape this release.\n\nEnhancements:\n\nBetter Tag Matching for “Best Bets” – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nNow Best Bets will show up when tag keywords are present in search, not just when there’s an exact match.\n\nExample matches:\n\n“Job Search” now matches a “Job” tag\n\n“Search for a job in my area” now matches a “job search” tag\n\nUse case not currently covered: partial keyword match.\n\n“Looking for a job in my area” would not match “job search”\n\nNo additional configuration for this feature is required beyond the standard configuration for Topic Explorer.\n\nSierra via Summon\n\nThe following functionality is currently available to the Early Adopter group:\n\nLogin using CAS.\n\nView availability and perform requests from the results page.\n\nView library account information, including loans, requests, fines and fees.\n\nThis functionality will be available in the second half of 2022, after the Early Adopter’s review.\n\nRecent Improvements:\n\nSeparate Print from eBooks when Searching – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nFor Summon over Alma environments, resolved issue with the feature reverting to off.\n\nImproved process for including electronic materials in faceted results.\n\nImplemented toggle between facets to prevent use in combination.\n\nTo achieve an include or exclude of both formats, use the Book/eBook facet value under Content Type.\n\nRemaining outstanding bug: Clear All Facets does not clear these facets.\n\nAdditional Fixes and Improvements:\n\nThe following fixes have been resolved or completed:\n\nAdvanced search for DOI causes API parser error.\n\nSummon usage statistics are not accessible.\n\nZero Result searches returns error.\n\nChat images are not automatically resized.\n\nTranslations do not display in Summon Preview.\n\nHTML returned in permalinks for OpenAthens proxy.\n\nDate facet update to correctly handle time zone differences.\n\nThe following improvements have been completed:\n\nAdd proxy when vendor = redirector.\n\nSupport Summon WeChat interoperability.\n\nRemoval of RefWorks Lite links options for non-RefWorks sites (if your RefWorks login should be appearing but is not, please contact support).\n\nMay 12, 2021\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release.

Your participation in the IGELU and ELUNA NERS process guaranteed these would be delivered this year.\n\nEnhancements\n\nSeparate Print from eBooks when Searching – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nPreviously Summon only had a combined Book/Ebook content type facet value; now institutions can also add a facet value for just physical books and one for ebooks\n\nPatrons can include or exclude search results using this value\n\nThis is configurable by institution; activation is a two-step process\n\nTo prepare your instance of Summon you must first turn on “Physical Books – Backend Processing; you will find this in the Summon Admin Console under Settings > Refine Your Search\n\nAt the bottom of the Refine Your Search configurations you will find the setting “Physical Books – Backend Processing”\n\nSet Physical Books – Backend Processing to On\n\nThen click Save Settings\n\nThe backend process is part of the twice weekly CDI search index update process\n\nAn index update will to be completed before the facet is ready\n\nIf you turn on the facets prior to the process being completed, they will likely show no results for those facets\n\nOnce the backend processing is complete, you will need to turn these facets on in the Summon Admin Console under Settings > Refine Your Search\n\nAt the bottom of Refine Your Search configurations, you will find Physical Books Filter Enabled and eBooks Filter Enabled set to off by default\n\nFor Print click on the Default button for “Physical Books Filter Enabled” to change it to Custom and set the value to On\n\nFor electronic books click on the Default button for “eBooks Filter Enabled” to change it to Custom and set the value to On\n\nThen click Save Settings\n\nThis feature should appear in your instance of Summon within 5 minutes\n\nBecause this feature requires a search index update in production, you will not be able to view this during the preview period; after you’ve run the backend processing in production once the release is live you can then view the facet in the preview environment prior to activating in production\n\nThe addition and configuration of these facets does not impact the Book/Ebook facet; it will still be available and should perform as before\n\nImprovements on Topic Source Display\n\nThe source label for the encyclopedia entry in Topic Explorer should now better reflect the source found when the user clicks on “Read More”\n\nNo additional configuration for this feature is required beyond the standard configuration for Topic Explorer\n\nApply EZProxy to DOI in Preview Pane – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nNow you can apply your proxy settings to the DOI link in the preview pane in Summon search results\n\nYou’ll find the controls to apply your proxy to the DOI link in the Summon Admin Console under Settings > Search Results at the bottom of the controls\n\nSwitch Proxy DOI Links Enabled to “Custom” and “On”\n\nClick Save Settings and the change should be applied in approximately 5 minutes\n\nYour proxy settings used on your site should be applied to the DOI link\n\nFebruary 3, 2021\n\nWhile the majority of the February 2021 release is related to performance and internal tools updates, users will also now have access to the updated APA Citation Style (7th Edition) as a citation option.\n\nUpdate APA Citation Style to current edition (7th Edition)\n\nIf you have the APA citation style already active in your Summon User Interface, the update to the new citation style will be automatic; 7th edition will replace the 6th edition.\n\nIf you do not have the APA citation format active, you can change this in the Summon Admin Console under Settings > Citation Formats; simply drag the APA American Psychological Assoc. tile from the disabled column on the right to the enabled column on the left and click the save button at the bottom of the page.\n\nAvailability of APA Citation Style (6th Edition)\n\nIn the April maintenance release, per customer request, we added back the option for APA Citation Style (6th Edition) so institutions can now choose between 6th Edition, 7th Edition, or displaying both.\n\nEach style’s default text now includes edition number (previously this was labeled only as APA Citation Style.\n\nSummon over Alma Course Reserve Link\n\nSome links were resulting in searches with incorrect mapping; we have resolved this issue.\n\nDecember 16, 2020\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release. All of these ideas originated on the Idea Exchange and were the top votes for the NERS process for 2020. Your participation in the IGELU and ELUNA NERS process guaranteed these would be delivered this year.\n\nEnhancements\n\nClarify Author and Editor in Results and Citations – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nIn Summon search results, editors for a publication can now be displayed underneath the \"by\" line for authors\n\nEditors can also be included in citations, where appropriate.\n\nThe visibility of the Editor information is dependent upon the metadata available in CDI. As an ongoing process, we will add this information to the records as it is made available by the provider.\n\nTo enable this feature, set the new Display Editor field to On in the Summon Admin Console under Settings > Search Results. After clicking Save Settings, this feature should appear in your instance of Summon within 5 minutes.\n\nFor a short overview of this feature, see Summon Feature Review - Clarify Author and Editor in Results and Citations.\n\nFor API users, the following fields are related to Author/Editor:\n\nAuthor (text field): both searchable and displayable\n\nAuthor_xml (xml field): displaying only\n\nEditor (text field): both searchable and displayable\n\nEditor_xml (xml field): displaying only\n\nCorporateAuthor (text field): both searchable and displayable\n\nAuthorCombined (text field - combines Author and CorporateAuthor, but not Editor): both searchable and displayable (as Author and/or\n\nCorporateAuthor) => this is the field used when a user chooses \"Author\" from Summon's advanced search interface\n\nDatabase A to Z List Integration – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nYou can now turn on a Springshare A–Z list Database Finder widget in the right-hand panel.\n\nTyping a term in this box will generate an autocomplete list of possible databases, or the user can hit Enter or click the search icon to have the results displayed in the right-hand column.\n\nTo activate this functionality, the A-Z Database Settings section has been added to the new Recommender > Springshare page in the Summon Admin Console. For information on how to configure the A–Z list Database Finder widget, see A-Z Database Settings.\n\nFor a short overview of the feature, see Summon Feature Review - Database A-Z within Summon.\n\nHarvesting Best Bets from LibAnswer FAQs – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nNow you can import your FAQs from Springshare’s LibAnswer FAQs for use as Best Bets in Summon.\n\nImporting your FAQs will create a Best Bet instance for each FAQ, including tags for each Best Bet.\n\nTo activate this functionality, the LibAnswers Settings section has been added to the new Recommender > Springshare page in the Summon Admin Console. For information on how to harvest FAQs from Springshare, see LibAnswers Settings.\n\nFor a short overview of the feature, see Summon Feature Review - Best Bets to Harvest LibAnswers FAQs.\n\nAdditional Improvements and Fixes\n\nWe improved the positioning of the Save Settings and Reset Form buttons in the Admin Console; previously, they were displayed at the bottom of the page, where they were not visible without scrolling; these buttons are now displayed directly beneath the settings to which they apply.\n\nPopular Searches in Summon Analytics now includes a drop-down menu for displaying Popular Searches by month.\n\nAugust 5, 2020\n\nBelow are some details for features in the current release. All of these ideas originated on the Idea Exchange and were the top votes for the NERS process for 2020. Your participation in the IGELU and ELUNA NERS processes guaranteed that these features would be delivered this year. More NERS enhancements are coming in November!\n\nEnhancements\n\nSection Number on Course Reserves Page – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nFor Summon over Alma customers, you can now display the section number along with the Course ID on the Course Reserves page.\n\nConsistent Links Back to Results – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nNow links from various Summon pages (such as the Saved Items Folder and Advanced Search) have consistent labels and placement to improve the overall user experience.\n\nImproved Peer Review Labeling – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nYou can add a Peer Review icon in the same location as the Open Access icon for improved visibility.\n\nIn the Admin Console under Settings > Search Results, you will find the option to turn the icon on or off at the bottom of the list of options labeled Peer Review Indicator.\n\nDisplay Book and Ebook Publication details – NERS Enhancement and Idea Exchange\n\nBrief records in results for books and ebooks will now display Series Title, Edition, and Year.\n\nYou can also learn more about these features by reviewing the most recent Summon Update and Q&A session, available for you to view as either a YouTube video or PDF.\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\nBelow you will find highlights of user-facing improvements and bug fixes.

For more information, see Summon: Administration Console: Chat Widgets.\n\nAdd your WhatsApp number and configuration under Settings > Chat in the Summon Admin Console.\n\nChats will be directed to the smart phone number entered in the Admin Console; to change who the chats are routed to, you can update the number in the Admin Console and the change should take effect in five minutes or less.\n\nChat functionality is managed by the WhatsApp application; features such as chat log or history are provided by WhatsApp.\n\nNew Records facet: limits results to records added to the index in the last 7, 30 or 90 days.\n\n“New Records” label can be customized under “Translations” in the Summon Admin Console.\n\nThe facet can be enabled or disabled or placed in a diffent display order with other facets by going to Settings > Facets in the Admin Console.\n\nThis was added as part of the March maintenance release.\n\nCurrently, some existing catalog records may show as “new” in this facet; this is because an existing record has merged with a record that is new to the index, making the entire record appear new; we are working on revising the logic to address this.\n\nFebruary 5, 2020\n\nBelow you will find highlights of user-facing improvements and bug fixes. You can review existing functionality for Summon now on CDI and preview new features in the Summon Release Preview Environment as of January 23. This applies to Summon customers, Summon over Alma customers, and customers of the Summon API.\n\nCDI Improvements\n\nYou can now test out Summon using the Ex Libris Central Discovery Index.

This functionality allows you to prioritize physical resources above electronic.\n\nTo activate this, select “Search Results” from the Settings tab in the admin console. The very last setting in that pane is “Merged document physical priority.”\n\nTurn this on if you want print or physical items to take priority over electronic items\n\nThis feature was a product of the ELUNA / IGeLU 2017 New Enhancement Request System (NERS)\n\n“Add results beyond your library…” should not appear when results refined to catalog\n\nWhen results are constrained to the library catalog, there are no results beyond your library to add, and as such, this filter does not apply.\n\nNow, if a user constrains their results to only the catalog, this option will not appear; if the user clears that constraint, the option will reappear.\n\nThis feature was a product of the ELUNA / IGeLU 2017 NERS\n\nCustom Location Mapping\n\nThe Mapping tab in the admin console will now include a form for requesting location mapping changes\n\nConfigurable force redirect to HTTPS\n\nWhile your site may be HTTPS compliant, URLs from outside of your site (such as links from bookmarks, emails or typed in the browser’s address bar) may be referred across HTTP rather than HTTPS\n\nActivating this feature will direct the traffic over HTTPS regardless of the original URL\n\nYou can turn this on or off for your institution\n\nJava8 Upgrade\n\nOur production environment will be updated to Java 8 as part of this release\n\nFor the most part, this upgrade should be transparent\n\nThe API and User Interface should not be affected by this upgrade\n\nThis predominantly impacts internal tools and should resolve some outstanding issues with RTA\n\nWhile we have done extensive quality assurance in our testing environments, configurations within your connections for RTA may vary from our test environments, so please check your links.\n\nProduct Improvements and Issue Resolution\n\nIn addition to the above functionality, we have addressed the following issues:\n\nResolved an issue in the Chrome browser that was causing the Detail Page to unintentionally scroll when the Saved Items dialog box is present\n\nPreviously, emailing a result did not include location and call number (both of which are displayed in the result preview); now both are included in the email\n\nAddressed conditions causing certain item from a specific institution to be excluded when \"Items at my Institution\" filter is applied\n\nFor Topic Explorer, addressed issues to ensure simplified Chinese is displayed when the User Interface (UI) is set to “simplified Chinese” and traditional Chinese is displayed when the UI is set to “traditional Chinese”\n\nNewly Indexed Content Highlights\n\nWe’ve recently added or updated the following commercial content packages in the Summon Index:\n\nCAIRN\n\nNomos e-Library\n\nCanadian Electronic Library\n\nIHS Jane's\n\nInfobase Films on Demand\n\n19th Century British Pamphlets\n\nPreselect Media\n\nWestlaw UK\n\nBrill Books Full text\n\nSciELO\n\nNovember 15, 2017\n\nEnhancements\n\nFor more details on the enhancements described below, you may want to review our release overview or our recorded release preview.\n\nSearch within a Journal\n\nWhen a user searches for a journal title, a link to constrain your search to only within that journal will appear\n\nClicking the link will limit that search and any additional searches to that journal until the user clears the limit\n\nMatching requires a match of at least 3 words to the journal title or match an acronym\n\nWe’ve modified the matching to be more tolerant of capitalization and punctuation and adjusted our requirements for matching so that more searches should surface the link more frequently\n\nIn order for an acronym to match it must be capitalized\n\nYou need to turn this on before it will appear in your instance of Summon; instructions on how to do so are found here\n\nCustom Panels in the Right-Hand Column\n\nNow you can easily create and display blocks of rich HTML or custom widgets in the right-hand column on the Search Results page\n\nThese panels can include rich HTML or JavaScript\n\nThey can be set to display only when triggered by a keyword or to be persistent for all searches\n\nPlease test your custom JavaScript; most issues identified in the preview environment were addressed by addressing issues within the custom script\n\nYou need to activate this feature and create your custom panels before it will appear in your instance of Summon; instructions on how to do so are found here\n\nSearch Form Improvements\n\nOn the Search Results page you can add a \"New Search\" button that allows users to clear a search with as single click, which includes search terms, applied filters, rights panel content and search results\n\nCurrently there is no way to turn the “New Search” button off; if you wish to remove this feature from your instance of Summon, under translations, change the label from “New Search” to a single space\n\nAlso, the New Search feature does not clear the Search within the Journal feature if it is active; we will resolve this in a future release\n\nYou can also clear only the search terms using the Clear icon in the search box\n\nYou can now add a second Search and Clear button to the Advanced Search Form so that they appear at both the top and bottom of the form\n\nCitation Query Improvements\n\nWe have improved our relevance algorithm to better handle processing a search on a complete citation\n\nBetter handling of punctuation and other conventions within a citation style\n\nAdditional Enhancements Available Outside the Quarterly Release\n\nBeyond these notable items, we are also making improvements that will be included as part of the November release but may not be visible immediately upon release. This includes increased frequency of rights updates, In Index reporting in Client Center, updates to the API documentation, and Citation Query Improvements. We will include more details on these features as part of the release.\n\nIncreased frequency of rights updates\n\nAs part of the November 15 release, we will be increasing the frequency of updating rights for your institution\n\nIf the content is already available within Summon, you can add or remove it to your instance of Summon and the change will take place within 48 hours or less\n\nIn most cases, if you make a change today, by end of day the next day your changes will be visible\n\nChanges to your catalog records, addition of new content or changes to existing content will still be processed as part of our twice weekly Summon Index Updates\n\nWhile this functionality will be live in the production environment starting November 15, you will not be able to see the increased frequency of updates immediately\n\nIn order to ensure rights are being processed properly, for approximately two weeks after the release, we will run this new process in parallel with the current twice weekly updates\n\nDuring this time we will be reviewing and comparing the two processes to ensure everything is performing as expected\n\nOnce we have validated that this process is performing as expected, we will replace our current process with the new one\n\nWe will send out notification once this switch has been made\n\nIn Index reporting in Client Center\n\nThis reporting, which displays in the client center or in Intota, indicates whether a database is indexed in Summon and provides the database's coverage percentage in Summon\n\nThis should appear in your instance of Summon within 24-48 hours after the initial Summon November release\n\nUpdates to the API documentation\n\nWe have made numerous improvements to our documentation in the Ex Libris Developer Network\n\nImprovements include better and more consistent formatting, inclusion of examples, and addressing broken links\n\nWe’ve also added more details around Availability and support for creating your own Topic Explorer\n\nWe will follow up with links to specific changes by the end of the week\n\nBug Fixes\n\nIn addition to the above functionality, we have addressed the following issues:\n\nNew Full Load Requests Improvements: Summon now allows requests for any catalog type (previously the form was limited to MARC and MARCXML) and allows for requests for Institutional Repositories\n\nImproved HTTPS support for creating off-campus login links\n\nAddressed outstanding login issues with OBI\n\nNewly Indexed Content Highlights\n\nWe’ve recently added or updated the following content packages in the Summon Index:\n\nProvider Collection Name or Type\n\nJuly 26, 2017\n\nEnhancements\n\nFor more details on the enhancements described below you may wish to review our Summon Update and Q&A webinar, specifically slides 21 through 41.\n\nSearch Course Reserves: Customers with Summon and Alma can provide users the ability to search for course reserve materials\n\nControlled Vocabularies Search: Subject terms are now enabled as search links, in the preview pane and on the catalog details page, enabling users to generate a new search with all elements of the subject term applied\n\nExpand search results to 1,000: You can configure Summon to generate 1,000 search results for your users, beyond the current 200\n\nEnglish Search Improvements: Improved handling of punctuation and special characters, use of synonyms, and stemming\n\nImproved Faceting: New enhancements improve usability of the include and exclude functionality in the primary and more facets panes\n\nImproved Header, Icon and Background Color Support: You can now set custom colors for your icons and background in the header of the results page and set the right hand column background to white; note: you do need to configure these features for them to take effect\n\nPreview Link Hover: A preview is displayed when the user hovers over the preview icon, eliminating the requirement to click on the link to see the preview\n\nPermalink placement improvement: Permalinks are now both in the preview section and as an icon at the top of the result with a tool tip\n\nOpenAthens Support: Proxy support for OpenAthens\n\nBeyond these notable items, we are also making accessibility improvements and enabling you to enhance results page design through better color contrast of icons and backgrounds.

We will be continuously updating this content on an ongoing basis based on feedback from the customer community and as we cooperate with more providers to properly identify open access content within their collections.\n\nResource Recommender Improvements\n\nSearching on a database name should now return the database as a recommendation, regardless of capitalization or spacing.\n\nFixed issues related to capitalization and alphabetical ordering of database names in Resource Recommender.\n\nBest Bets Improvements\n\nBest Bets bulk imports now allows for importing of tags.\n\nImproved handling of some punctuation and special characters (-_ &/'@#) in Best Bets tags, and support for special characters (\"-_.&'@#/~!$%^()+`={}[]:;?,|\\<>.`*) in the description field.\n\nBetter error handling for adding Best Bets.\n\nSummon over Alma\n\nSummon now supports integration with Alma for both the Summon User Interface and for Summon API customers who also subscribe to Alma.\n\nSummon / Alma customers will have access to the same features and functionality found in Summon.\n\nAdditional Functionality Available to Summon / Alma customers:\n\nServices page\n\nDelivery of patron account data in Alma\n\nAbility for users to log in to view their account information\n\nA customizable page that shows items checked out, holds, fines, etc.\n\nPublish catalog data\n\nRather than the output from Voyager of new/changed records and the batch input into Summon, Alma will “publish” new and changed records from the Alma bibliographic database to Summon\n\nThese records will be picked up by the Summon indexing programs\n\nRights management for e-resources\n\nReplacement of 360 Client Center with Alma\n\n\"Client Center\" functions embedded in Alma\n\nSingle activation - there is no need to activate in both Alma and Summon, just a new process\n\nDiscipline scoped searching\n\nUser can now limit and pre-filter searches to specific disciplines using the Advanced Search form.\n\nAdditional Enhancements\n\nWhen exporting search results and saved citations, you now have access to the Chicago 16th Edition (Notes & Bibliography) footnoting citation format in Summon.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nBeyond the fixes and improvements listed above, we have also made the following issues:\n\nTranslated the Help Page into German.\n\nAny changes made to the translations fields for citation format names will now be reflected in the UI.\n\nAddressed issues related to dynamically rendered views that were preventing Zotero from importing citations from Summon.\n\nAddressed issues that were causing the A&I Details Page to show Available in Print when there's no print or electronic access.\n\nTitles that were appearing in the user interface without spaces between the words now have proper spacing.\n\nImproved HTTPS support so that thumbnail images that were not appearing in the UI due to redirects of the URL are now displaying.\n\nImproved accessibility so that tabbing through elements in the user interface now highlights the menu options when expected.\n\nPreview Environment - Now Including Access to Your Admin Console\n\nThe preview environment for the May 3 release is available through May 2.
