I've found it's better to ask a question with a longer answer, so there's more \"meat\" for ChatGPT to chew on.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT and other interesting alternatives to try\n\nKeep in mind that ChatGPT can't provide any information after January 2022 for GPT-3.5, April 2023 for GPT-4, and October 2023 for GPT-4o, and requests for information pre-internet (say, for a paper on Ronald Reagan's presidency) will have far fewer available sources.\n\nHere's an example of a prompt I wrote on a topic that I worked on a lot when I was in grad school:\n\nDescribe the learning theories of cognitivism, behaviorism, and constructivism\n\nMost large language models respond well to detail and specificity. So if you're asking for sources, you can push for higher-quality sources. You'll need to specify that you need reliable and accurate sources. While this approach won't necessarily work, it may remind the AI chatbot to give you more useful responses. For example:\n\nPlease provide me with reputable sources to support my argument on... (whatever the topic is you're looking at)\n\nYou can also tell ChatGPT the kinds of sources you want. If you're looking for scholarly articles, peer-reviewed journals, books, or authoritative websites, mention these preferences explicitly. For example:\n\nPlease recommend peer-reviewed journals that discuss... (and here, repeat what you discussed earlier in your conversation)\n\nWhen dealing with abstract concepts or theories, request that ChatGPT provide a conceptual framework and real-world examples. Here's an example:\n\nCan you describe the principles of Vygotsky's Social Development Theory and provide real-world examples where these principles were applied, including sources for these examples?\n\nThis approach gives you a theoretical explanation and practical instances to trace the original sources or case studies.\n\nAlso: Two ways you can build custom AI assistants with GPT-4o\n\nAnother idea is to use sources that don't have link rot (that is, they're no longer online at the URL that ChatGPT might know). Be careful with this idea, though, because ChatGPT doesn't know about things after January 2022 for GPT-3.5, April 2023 for GPT-4, and October 2023 for GPT-4o. So, while you might be tempted to use a prompt like this:\n\nPlease provide me with sources published within the past five years.\n\nInstead, consider using a prompt like this:\n\nPlease provide sources published from 2019 through April 2023.\n\nAnd, as always, don't assume that whatever output ChatGPT gives you is accurate. It's still quite possible the AI will completely fabricate answers, even to the point of making up the names of what seem like academic journals. It's a sometimes helpful tool, but it's also a fibber.\n\nKeep this golden rule in mind about ChatGPT-provided sources: ChatGPT is more often wrong than right.\n\nAcross the many times I've asked ChatGPT for URL sources, roughly half were just plain bad links. Another 25% or more of the links went to topics completely or somewhat unrelated to the one I was trying to source. GPT-4 and GPT-4o are slightly more reliable, but not by much.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT: Everything you need to know\n\nFor example, I asked for sources on a backgrounder for the phrase \"trust but verify,\" generally popularized by US President Ronald Reagan. I got a lot of sources back, but most didn't exist. I got some back that correctly took me to active pages on the Reagan Presidential Library site, but the page topic had nothing to do with the phrase.\n\nI had better luck with my learning theory question from step 1. There, I got back offline texts from people I knew from my studies who had worked on those theories. I also got back URLs. Once again, only about two in 10 worked or were accurate.\n\nAlso: What does GPT stand for? Understanding GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and more\n\nDon't despair. The idea isn't to expect ChatGPT to provide sources that you can immediately use. If you instead think of ChatGPT as a research assistant, it will give you some great starting places. Use the names of the articles (which may be completely fake or just not accessible) and drop them into Google. That process will give you some interesting search queries that probably lead to interesting material that can legitimately go into your research.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you're not limited to using ChatGPT. Don't forget all the tools available to researchers and students. Do your own web searches. Check with primary sources and subject-matter experts if they're available. If you're in school, you can even ask your friendly neighborhood librarian for help.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to create an app\n\nDon't forget that there are many excellent traditional sources. For example, Google Scholar and JSTOR provide access to a wide range of academically acceptable resources you can cite with reasonable confidence.\n\nOne final point: if you merely cut and paste ChatGPT sources into your research, you're likely to get stung. Use the AI for clues, not as a way to avoid the real work of research."
