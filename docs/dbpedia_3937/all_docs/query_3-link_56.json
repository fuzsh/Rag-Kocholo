        "text": "Have you ever thought about using a search engine other than Google? When you think about search engines, Google is probably the first thing that comes to mind.\n\nThat’s because it dominates the search engine market by a long margin. Over 90% of the searches take place on Google.\n\nBut what if other search engines are more secure and provide different benefits than Google?\n\nIn this article, we’ll show you alternative search engines that are better than Google. Let’s dive straight in…\n\nMonsterInsights is the best WordPress Analytics plugin. Get it for free!\n\n1. Bing\n\nBing is a search engine by Microsoft and is second in terms of market share after Google. It was launched in 2009, and its origin traces back to earlier search engines offered by Microsoft, such as MSN Search and Live Search.\n\nYou can perform the same kind of searches on Bing as you would do on Google. For instance, you can use the search engine to perform keyword research, find videos, images, maps, products, and more.\n\nBing offers a webmaster tool, which comes in handy if you want to submit a website to search engines for indexing.\n\nWhat makes Bing a better alternative search engine?\n\nThere are a few features that make Bing standout. First, it provides better video searches, as you get larger thumbnails, and if you hover over the video, you can preview the video with sound.\n\nSecond, Bing offers reward points for users who use the search engine. You can redeem the points you’ve earned to win exciting prizes like Microsoft Xbox One X or a Surface Laptop.\n\n2. Yahoo\n\nYahoo is another alternative search engine you can use and is third in terms of market share, behind Google and Bing. Created by David Filo and Jerry Yang in 1994, Yahoo was one of the most popular search engines in the 90s and early 2000s.\n\nSadly, the company has gone downhill over the years. Bing now powers it, and some may even see it as an outdated search engine. But all is not lost, as Yahoo still has some features up its sleeve.\n\nWhat makes Yahoo a better alternative search engine?\n\nIf you’re using other Yahoo services like finance, sports, email, and Yahoo Answers, then it provides better search results. You get more information about topics, as Yahoo pulls data from its other services.\n\n3. DuckDuckGo\n\nDuckDuckGo is perhaps one of the top private search engines. It places high importance on securing the privacy of its searchers.\n\nFounded in 2008 by Gabriel Weinberg, DuckDuckGo brings you search results from over 400 different sources. It also has its own crawler and partners with Bing as well.\n\nOne of the key features that set DuckDuckGo apart is that it avoids filter bubbles. A filter bubble is when users get personalized search results based on their previous browsing history.\n\nWhat makes DuckDuckGo a better alternative search engine?\n\nAs you can see, DuckDuckGo prides itself on being a secure search engine that doesn’t compromise on privacy. It doesn’t store any personal information, record user’s IP addresses, or user’s past history to modify its search results.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for a search engine that’s more secure than Google, then DuckDuckGo is a great option.\n\n4. Baidu\n\nBaidu is an alternative to Google for people in China. That’s because Google and its services don’t work in mainland China, so Baidu the go-to search engine for users.\n\nThe search engine is in Mandarin and if you access the search engine, you’ll get a similar interface and user experience as Google.\n\nThat said, Baidu is heavily regulated due to the strict censorship laws in China. So, you won’t get extensive information about the topics.\n\nWhat makes Baidu a better alternative search engine?\n\nBaidu has an advantage over Google that it works in China. Since you cannot use Google, Baidu is the best alternative. And if you’re planning on attracting visitors from China to your website, then instead of optimizing your content for Google, you can focus on ranking on Baidu.\n\n5. Yandex\n\nYandex is another popular internet search engine that’s based in Russia and makes the top 5 search engines in the world in terms of market share.\n\nIt’s more than just a search engine. The company offers other services like transportation, eCommerce, online advertisements, mobile apps, and navigation. And just like Google, Yandex also offers its own browser.\n\nWhat makes Yandex a better alternative search engine?\n\nYandex offers the same search features as Google, but what makes it better is its huge presence in Russia. It commands almost 56% of market share in Russia, making it the most popular search engine in the region.\n\nNot only that, but Yandex is also used in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. This provides benefits for anyone who is looking to business in these countries. By focusing your search engine optimization for Yandex, you’ll have a better chance of attracting and converting visitors.\n\nAnd if you use Yandex’s cloud storage, then you can look up your files in the search engine – cool feature isn’t it!\n\n6. Twitter\n\nTwitter is mainly a social media platform, but it can also be a powerful search engine. If you’re looking for the latest news or information about a trending topic, then nothing beats Twitter.\n\nBy searching hashtags, profile handles, or simple keywords, you can get real-time updates about anything. And through Twitter, you can uncover interesting topics and resolve your customer’s queries.\n\nWhat makes Twitter a better alternative search engine?\n\nIn terms of speed of getting up to date news, Twitter beats Google hands down. In fact, you’ll find a section of Tweets on Google search results, just like People Also Ask, infoboxes, and featured snippets.\n\nSo, if you want breaking news, opinion about a topic, real-time feedback, and minute by minute update, then Twitter should be your preferred search engine.\n\n7. StartPage\n\nStartPage is among the top secure search engines and was created with privacy in mind. How secure is the search engine?\n\nFor starters, it doesn’t track IP addresses and there are no tracking cookies to monitor users’ search behavior. And the best part of all, it brings search results from Google. So, you don’t have to worry about the lack of information or irrelevant searches.\n\nWhat makes StartPage a better alternative search engine?\n\nStartPage offers privacy features that you won’t find in Google. You get a proxy service that lets you browse the internet anonymously. It also offers a custom URL generator, which you can use to browse the web without the need for setting cookies.\n\nAnd since StartPage is based in the Netherlands, it complies with GDPR regulations, helping protect the privacy of EU citizens.\n\n8. Ecosia\n\nEcosia is a search engine that’s designed to help the environment and fight climate change. With every search that you perform, Ecosia plants trees around the world through its own profits.\n\nIt roughly donates about 80% of its profits for tree plantation, which means that it plants 1 tree for every 50 searches.\n\nEcosia uses Bing to power its search engine but also uses its own algorithm to enhance the searches.\n\nWhat makes Ecosia a better alternative search engine?\n\nIn addition to minimizing the carbon footprint left behind by search engines, Ecosia offers privacy features that you won’t find in Google. For instance, it doesn’t create a permeant search profile of users and deletes data from its database after one week.\n\nEcosia doesn’t sell data to third parties or advertisers. There are no external tracking tools in the search engine, and you can switch off trackingEcosia does that to improve its service. And through encrypted search, it keeps the user’s privacy safe.\n\n9. Swisscows\n\nSwisscows is another privacy-centric search engine and is based in Switzerland. It’s powered by Bing but uses its own index for queries in the German language.\n\nLike many other private search engines on our list, Swisscows doesn’t track users browsing patterns, collect data, or creates their search profiles. It even has its own firewall that filters personal identifiers before passing data on to Bing.\n\nWhat makes Swisscow a better alternative search engine?\n\nPrivacy is at the heart of Swisscows search engine and that’s what separates it from Google. It automatically screens out any content that contains pornographic or violent material.\n\nAnd it uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to understand the user’s query and then bring you search results.\n\nFinal Words\n\nThere are many search engines that you can use instead of Google. If your focus is on maintaining your privacy, then search engines like DuckDuckGo, StartPage, and Swisscows are a suitable option.\n\nAnd if you’re looking to do business in a specific location then you can try to optimize your site for Baidu and Yandex.\n\nThis brings us to the end of our guide.\n\nWe hope you liked our article on alternative search engines that are better than Google.
