        "text": "The six essential nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, fats, water, and carbohydrates. People need to consume these nutrients from dietary sources for proper body function.\n\nEssential nutrients are crucial in supporting a person’s reproduction, good health, and growth. These essential nutrients are divided into two categories: micronutrients and macronutrients.\n\nMicronutrients are nutrients that a person needs in small doses. Micronutrients consist of vitamins and minerals. Although the body only needs small amounts of them, a deficiency can cause ill health.\n\nMacronutrients are nutrients that a person needs in larger amounts. Macronutrients include water, protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\n\nKeep reading for more information about where to find these nutrients, and why a person needs them.\n\nVitamins are micronutrients that offer a range of health benefits, including:\n\nboosting the immune system\n\nhelping prevent or delay certain cancers, such as prostate cancer\n\nstrengthening teeth and bones\n\naiding calcium absorption\n\nmaintaining healthy skin\n\nhelping the body metabolize proteins and carbs\n\nsupporting healthy blood\n\naiding brain and nervous system functioning\n\nThere are 13 essential vitamins that nutritionists divide into two groups: fat soluble and water soluble.\n\nFat soluble vitamins are:\n\nvitamin A\n\nvitamin D\n\nvitamin E\n\nvitamin K\n\nWater soluble vitamins are:\n\nvitamin B-1 (thiamine)\n\nvitamin B-12 (cyanocobalamin)\n\nvitamin B-6\n\nvitamin B-2 (riboflavin)\n\nvitamin B-5 (pantothenic acid)\n\nvitamin B-3 (niacin)\n\nvitamin B-9 (folate, folic acid)\n\nvitamin B-7 (biotin)\n\nvitamin C\n\nTypically, a person who eats a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins can get all the vitamins they need in their food. However, those who eat less fruit and vegetables, and those with digestive conditions may need to take a vitamin supplement to reduce or avoid a deficiency.\n\nFind out what vitamins are and what they do here.\n\nMinerals are the second type of micronutrients. There are two groups of minerals: major and trace minerals. The body needs a balance of minerals from both groups for optimal health.\n\nMajor minerals are:\n\nmagnesium\n\ncalcium\n\nphosphorus\n\nsulfur\n\nsodium\n\npotassium\n\nchloride\n\nMajor minerals help the body to do the following:\n\nbalance water levels\n\nmaintain healthy skin, hair, and nails\n\nimprove bone health\n\nTrace minerals are:\n\niron\n\nselenium\n\nzinc\n\nmanganese\n\nchromium\n\ncopper\n\niodine\n\nfluoride\n\nmolybdenum\n\nTrace minerals help with:\n\nstrengthening bones\n\npreventing tooth decay\n\naiding in blood clotting\n\nhelping to carry oxygen\n\nsupporting the immune system\n\nsupporting healthy blood pressure\n\nA person can ensure they consume enough minerals by including the following foods in their diet.\n\nred meats (limit their use and choose lean cuts)\n\nseafood\n\niodized table salt (less than 2,300 milligrams a day)\n\nmilk and other dairy products\n\nnuts and seeds\n\nvegetables\n\nleafy greens\n\nfruits\n\npoultry\n\nfortified bread and cereals\n\negg yolks\n\nwhole grains\n\nbeans and legumes\n\nFurther resources\n\nFor more in-depth resources about vitamins, minerals, and supplements, visit our dedicated hub.\n\nProtein is a macronutrient that every cell in the body needs to function properly.\n\nProteins carry out a variety of functions, including:\n\nensuring the growth and development of muscles, bones, hair, and skin\n\nforming antibodies, hormones, and other essential substances\n\nserving as a fuel source for cells and tissues when needed\n\nA person can take in proteins through their diet. The following foods are good sources of protein:\n\nred meats (limit their use and choose lean cuts)\n\npoultry, including chicken and turkey\n\nfish and other seafood\n\nbeans and legumes\n\neggs\n\ndairy products\n\nsoy\n\nnuts\n\nsome grains, including quinoa\n\nAlthough meats and fish tend to contain the highest levels of protein, vegans and vegetarians can get enough protein from various plant products.\n\nLearn how much protein a person needs each day.\n\nPeople often associate high fat foods with bad health. However, a person needs certain fats to help maintain optimal health.\n\nFats provide the body with energy and help it carry out a range of functions. However, it is essential to consume healthful fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and limit or avoid saturated and trans fats.\n\nHealthful fats help with the following functions:\n\ncell growth\n\nblood clotting\n\nbuilding new cells\n\nreducing the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes\n\nmuscle movement\n\nbalance blood sugar\n\nbrain functioning\n\nmineral and vitamin absorption\n\nhormone production\n\nimmune function\n\nAccording to recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a person should consume 20–35% of their calories from healthful fats.\n\nA person can find healthful fats in several foods, including:\n\nnuts\n\nfish, such as salmon and tuna\n\nvegetable oils\n\nseeds\n\nFind out the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats.\n\nCarbohydrates are essential to the body. They are sugars or starches that provide energy for all the cells and tissues in the body.\n\nThere are two different types of carbohydrates: simple and complex. People should limit their intake of simple carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and rice. However, the body needs complex carbohydrates to support the following:\n\nthe immune system\n\nbrain function\n\nthe nervous system\n\nenergy to perform tasks\n\ndigestive function\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a person consumes 45–65% of their daily calories from complex carbohydrates.\n\nThe following foods contain complex carbohydrates:\n\nquinoa\n\nbrown rice\n\nvegetables\n\nwhole grain pasta, bread, and other baked goods\n\noatmeal\n\nfruits\n\nbarley\n\nPeople should avoid overly processed products that contain bleached, white flour, and foods with added sugar.\n\nLearn the difference between good and bad carbs here.\n\nWater is probably the most important essential nutrient that a person needs. A person can only survive a few days without consuming water. Even slight dehydration can cause headaches and impaired physical and mental functioning.\n\nThe human body is made up of mostly water, and every cell requires water to function. Water helps with several functions, including:\n\nflushing toxins out\n\nshock absorption\n\ntransporting nutrients\n\npreventing constipation\n\nlubrication\n\nhydration\n\nThe best source for water is to drink natural, unsweetened water from the tap or bottled sources. For people who do not like the taste of plain water, they can add a squeeze of lemon or other citrus fruits.\n\nAlso, a person can get extra water by consuming fruits that contain a large amount of water.\n\nPeople should avoid getting their water intake from sugary drinks. Sugary drinks include sweetened teas, coffees, soda, lemonade, and fruit juices.\n\nFind out how much water to drink to avoid dehydration."
