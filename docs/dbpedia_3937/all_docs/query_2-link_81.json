        "text": "Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent many infectious diseases. This page explains how vaccines work, what they contain and the most common side effects.\n\nVideo: Vaccines – are they safe for my child?\n\nIn this video, a GP reassures a parent about vaccinations for her child.\n\nImportant: Be aware of anti-vaccine stories\n\nAnti-vaccine stories are often spread online through social media and offline.\n\nAlways get your vaccine and health information from trusted sources, such as the NHS or World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nThe vaccine information on social media may not be based on scientific evidence and could put your child at risk of a serious illness.\n\nAll the current evidence tells us that getting vaccinated is safer than not getting vaccinated.\n\nThings you need to know about vaccines\n\nVaccines do\n\nhelp to protect you and your child from many serious and potentially deadly diseases\n\nprotect other people in your family and community – by helping to stop diseases spreading to people who cannot have vaccines, such as babies too young to be vaccinated and those who are too ill to be vaccinated\n\nundergo rigorous safety testing before being introduced – they're also constantly monitored for side effects after being introduced\n\nsometimes cause mild side effects that will not last long – you may feel a bit unwell and have a sore arm for 2 or 3 days\n\nreduce or even get rid of some diseases – if enough people are vaccinated\n\nVaccines do not\n\ndo not overload or weaken the immune system – it's safe to give children and adults several vaccines at a time and this reduces the amount of injections needed\n\ndo not contain mercury (thiomersal)\n\ndo not contain any ingredients that cause harm – only ingredients essential to making them safer and more effective and only in very small amounts\n\ndo not cause autism – studies have found no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism\n\nWhy vaccines are important\n\nVaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and our children against ill health. They prevent millions of deaths worldwide every year.\n\nSince vaccines were introduced in the UK, diseases like smallpox, polio and tetanus that used to kill or disable millions of people are either gone or are now very rarely seen.\n\nOther diseases like measles and diphtheria have reduced to a very low number of cases each year since vaccines were introduced. These cases are often related to travel.\n\nHowever, if people stop having vaccines, it's possible for infectious diseases to quickly spread again.\n\nInformation:\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the biggest threats to global health.\n\nMeasles and mumps in England\n\nMeasles and mumps are starting to appear again in England, even though the MMR vaccine is the best protection against both diseases.\n\nThis is serious as measles can lead to life-threatening complications like meningitis, and mumps can cause hearing loss.\n\nImportant\n\nIf 95% of children receive the MMR vaccine, this would stop measles spreading completely.\n\nHowever, measles, mumps and rubella can quickly spread again if fewer than 90% of people are vaccinated.\n\nEveryone should be up to date with their routine vaccinations to give them the best protection.\n\nHow vaccines work\n\nVaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.\n\nIt's much safer for your immune system to learn this through vaccination than by catching the diseases and treating them.\n\nOnce your immune system knows how to fight a disease, it can often give you life long protection.\n\nHerd immunity\n\nHaving a vaccine also benefits your whole community through \"herd immunity\".\n\nIf enough people are vaccinated, it's harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines. For example, people who are ill or have a weakened immune system.\n\nWho cannot have vaccines\n\nThere are very few people who cannot have vaccines.\n\nGenerally, vaccines are only not suitable for:\n\npeople who've had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the vaccine\n\npeople who've had a serious allergic reaction to ingredients in the vaccine\n\nPeople with weakened immune systems (for example, because of cancer treatment or a health condition) may also not be able to have some vaccines.\n\nIf you're not sure if you or your child can be vaccinated, check with a GP, practice nurse, health visitor or pharmacist.\n\nSide effects of vaccination\n\nMost of the side effects of vaccination are mild and do not last long.\n\nThe most common side effects of vaccination include:\n\nthe area where the needle goes in looking red, swollen and feeling a bit sore for 2 to 3 days\n\nfeeling a bit unwell or developing a high temperature for 1 or 2 days\n\nolder children and adults may feel faint\n\nfeeling tired, having a headache, mild fever, or flu-like symptoms\n\nSome children might also cry and be upset immediately after the injection. This is normal and they should feel better after a cuddle. Common side effects usually pass after a few days.\n\nAllergic reactions\n\nIt's rare for anyone to have a serious allergic reaction to a vaccination. If this does happen, it usually happens within minutes.\n\nThe person who vaccinates you or your child will be trained to deal with allergic reactions and treat them immediately. With prompt treatment, you or your child will make a good recovery.\n\nRead vaccination tips for parents, including what to expect after vaccination\n\nNon-urgent advice: Speak to your GP or practice nurse if:\n\nyou're worried about you or your child having a vaccine\n\nyou're not sure if you or your child can have a vaccine\n\nYou could also ask a health visitor any questions you have about vaccines.\n\nWhat's in a vaccine?\n\nMost vaccines contain a small amount of bacteria, virus or toxin that's been weakened or destroyed in a laboratory first.\n\nSome contain chemicals that make your body think it's coming into contact with the bacteria, virus or toxin.\n\nThis means there's a very low risk of healthy people catching a disease from a vaccine. It's also why you might see vaccines being called \"live\" or \"non-live\".\n\nDifferences between live and non-live vaccines Live (weakened) vaccines Non-live (destroyed) vaccines\n\nOther vaccine ingredients\n\nVaccines contain other ingredients that help make the vaccine more effective.\n\nThe main ingredient in vaccines is water. The other ingredients are used in very small amounts.\n\nThere is no evidence that any of the ingredients are harmful in such small amounts.\n\nAluminium (adjuvant)\n\nAn adjuvant is an ingredient added to vaccines in very small amounts to make them work more effectively. This may be particularly important for certain individuals, such as young babies or older people.\n\nThe most common vaccine adjuvants are aluminium salts. These have been used safely in many of our routine infant and adult vaccines for more than 70 years.\n\nWe come into contact with aluminium all the time. It's found naturally in very small amounts in:\n\nalmost all foods\n\ndrinking water\n\nbreast milk\n\nbaby formula milk\n\nIt's also used in medicines, such as antacids, and in food packaging.\n\nThere's no evidence that the levels of aluminium we come across every day increase the risk of conditions like dementia or autism.\n\nThe amount of aluminium used in non-live vaccines is very, very small. No harmful effects have been seen with vaccines that contain an aluminium-based adjuvant.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nAluminium is a very common metal that's been used safely in vaccines for more than 70 years.\n\nMost killed vaccines contain a very small amount of aluminium-based adjuvant to:\n\nhelp to boost our immune response\n\nmake the vaccine more effective and long-lasting\n\nreduce the amount of antigen needed in a vaccine\n\nsometimes reduce the number of doses that need to be given\n\nSqualene oil (adjuvant)\n\nAdjuvants are added to vaccines in very small amounts to make the response to the vaccine more effective. They have been shown to not be harmful.\n\nThey might cause minor reactions, such as a small temporary lump or redness at the injection site.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nSqualene oil is a component of the adjuvant added to the trivalent flu vaccine and the Sanofi (VidPrevtyn) COVID-19 vaccine recommended for older adults.\n\nIt comes from marine oil and is highly purified before being used in the vaccines.\n\nAdjuvants are added to some vaccines to:\n\nhelp to boost our immune response, especially as we get older\n\nmake the vaccine more effective and long-lasting\n\nreduce the amount of antigen needed in a vaccine\n\nsometimes reduce the number of doses that need to be given\n\nPork gelatine\n\nThere have been a small number of allergic reactions to vaccines containing gelatine. Speak to your doctor first if you have a known allergy to gelatine.\n\nSome religious groups, such as Muslims and Jews, may be concerned about using vaccines containing gelatine from pigs. But some faith group leaders have stated the use of gelatine in vaccines is acceptable and does not break any religious rules.\n\nRead this NHS leaflet about vaccines and porcine gelatine\n\nWhat is it?\n\nGelatine derived from pigs is used as a stabilising agent in some vaccines to:\n\nhelp protect vaccines from the effects of heat or freeze-drying\n\nhelp maintain the shelf life of the vaccine\n\nThe only vaccines containing gelatine in the UK routine vaccination schedule are:\n\nthe children's nasal flu vaccine\n\n1 of the 2 types of MMR vaccine\n\n1 of the 2 types of shingles vaccine\n\nHuman serum albumin and recombinant albumin\n\nThese are considered safe. Human serum albumin used in vaccines comes from screened blood donors. The manufacturing process ensures there is no risk of transmitting any diseases.\n\nRecombinant albumin does not contain any human or animal products.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nHuman serum albumin is a substance from human blood. It's used to stabilise a chickenpox vaccine called Varilix and maintain its quality during storage.\n\nRecombinant albumin is produced by cells, such as yeast cells, that have had the gene for human albumin inserted into them.\n\nThe cells are then able to generate large quantities of human serum albumin without any need to extract it from human blood.\n\nRecombinant albumin may be used in very small amounts as a stabiliser in 1 of the MMR vaccines used in the UK (MMRVaxPro).\n\nEgg protein\n\nChildren and adults with a severe egg allergy can safely receive the MMR vaccine.\n\nChildren and adults with an egg allergy are advised to have either:\n\nan egg-free inactivated flu vaccine\n\na vaccine with a very low egg protein (ovalbumin) content\n\nThe live nasal spray flu vaccine given to children has a very low egg protein content. It can be safely given to children with an egg allergy.\n\nChildren and adults who have previously had a very severe allergic reaction to eggs may be advised to have their flu vaccine in a hospital.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThere are 2 vaccines in the UK routine schedule that contain small amounts of egg protein:\n\nthe flu vaccine – which is grown on hens' eggs. It can potentially trigger an allergic reaction in people with an egg allergy\n\nthe MMR vaccine – which is grown on cells from chick embryos, which is not the same as hens' eggs. This means it does not trigger an allergic reaction\n\nFormaldehyde\n\nFormaldehyde can be found naturally in our bloodstream at levels far higher than we would be exposed to in vaccines.\n\nAlthough formaldehyde can be harmful in high concentrations, there are no health concerns about the small amounts found in vaccines.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nFormaldehyde is a chemical also used in the production of killed vaccines. It's used very early in the manufacturing process to kill or inactivate the toxins from bacteria or viruses.\n\nOnce the antigens are inactivated, the formaldehyde is diluted out. It's possible that trace amounts may remain in the final vaccine.\n\nAntibiotics\n\nIf you know you're allergic to neomycin or any other antibiotic, speak to your doctor or practice nurse before having a vaccine.\n\nAntibiotics known to cause allergic reactions, such as penicillin, are generally not used in vaccines.\n\nBut tiny amounts of an antibiotic called neomycin, which is capable of triggering an allergic reaction, are found in:\n\nthe MMR vaccine\n\n6-in-1 vaccine\n\nquadrivalent inactivated flu vaccine\n\n4-in-1 pre-school booster vaccine Repevax\n\nshingles vaccine\n\nWhat are they?\n\nAntibiotics are added to some vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria during the production and storage of the vaccine.\n\nAntibiotics can only be found in tiny amounts in the final vaccine.\n\nA full list of any vaccine's ingredients is available on the electronic medicines compendium (emc) website"
