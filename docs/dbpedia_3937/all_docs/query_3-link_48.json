        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Trace Explorer gives you the ability to search all ingested or indexed spans using any tag on any span. The spans found by your query change depending on whether you are searching Live (all spans ingested in the last 15 minutes, rolling) or indexed spans (spans retained for 15 days by your custom filters).\n\nInstrumented applications send 100% of their traces to Datadog for ingestion, making the traces available as Live traces for a rolling window of 15 minutes.\n\nThe Trace Explorer shows a Live Search - All ingested data indicator whenever you are in Live mode:\n\nAll ingested traces are then passed through:\n\nCustom retention filters that you can create to determine which spans to index. Once indexed through a custom retention filter, traces are retained for 15 days.\n\nThe default intelligent retention filter that retains a diverse set of traces. When indexed through the intelligent retention filter, traces are retained for 30 days.\n\nThe Trace Explorer shows an Search - Only Indexed Data indicator whenever you search indexed spans:\n\nLive Search is the default view on the Traces page. Switch from Live Search to Indexed Data Search by using the time selector in the top right-hand corner.\n\nTrace volume control\n\nYou can customize settings for both ingestion and retention to send and keep exactly what data is most relevant to you.\n\nIngestion\n\nControl your volume globally with Datadog Agent configuration options or set precise ingestion rules per service instrumented with Datadog APM.\n\nIndexing\n\nAfter you instrument your services and ingest traces, set tag-based retention filters within the Datadog app so that Datadog retains spans that are relevant to you.\n\nNote: Both ingested and indexed spans may impact your bill. For more information, see APM Billing.\n\nLive Search for 15 minutes\n\nWhen you use Live Search, Datadog displays spans as soon as they are sent by the Datadog Agent and before they have been indexed by your retention filters. All ingested spans are available for the last 15 minutes (rolling window), displayed without any sampling.\n\nFiltering\n\nA valid query in the search bar displays traces that match your search criteria across all spans. The search syntax is the same in the Live Search views as in the other trace views, but here, your query is matched against all of the ingested traces across any span and any tag, and not just the indexed ones.\n\nYou can choose to query the service entry spans, the root spans, or all spans by changing the selection to the box above the trace table. Use this feature on high traffic applications to reduce the number of spans displayed and view only the entry point spans of the services or the entry point of the trace. Selecting this box only filters the spans shown in the list; the others are still shown in the flame graph when clicking on a span to view the trace details.\n\nYou can also filter on attributes that are not defined as facets. For example, to filter on the cart.value attribute, there are two options:\n\nClick on the cart.value attribute in the trace details panel and add it to the search query:\n\nFilter on all spans with a cart.value attribute by typing “cart.value” in the search query bar:\n\nIndexed spans search with 15 day retention\n\nYou can search retained traces in the same way as you do a Live Search. To switch from searching live data to searching retained data, change the time selector to any period of time greater than 15 minutes. All spans that are indexed by retention filters are accessible from search. These spans are kept by Datadog for 15 days after being indexed by a retention filter.\n\nRetention configuration\n\nYou can customize which spans are retained and at what retention rates. By default, the Datadog intelligent retention filter is applied, which automatically retains traces with error and latency diversity as well as low-throughput resources. To learn more about the default intelligent retention filter and how to create your own additional filters, see the retention filters documentation. Go to the Retention Filters page within the Datadog app to create or modify your own filters.\n\nFurther Reading"
