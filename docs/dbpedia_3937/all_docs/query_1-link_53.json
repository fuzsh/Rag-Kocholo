Mostly, Google Scholar provides citation-only results. However, the full-text of an article or book can be accessed by using the \"Find it @ UTA\" link when it's available.\n\nWhen on campus you do not need to make any changes. When using Google Scholar off-campus, you will need to set your ‘Library Links’ to The University of Texas at Arlington. Once you complete the steps below, you will then see the \"Find it @ UTA\" link on some of your search results. Clicking that link will connect you directly with the appropriate database."
