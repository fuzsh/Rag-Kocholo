You will be able to access your list from any article in Discover.\n\nYou don't have any saved articles.\n\nNon-bird dinosaurs livedÂ between about 245 and 66 million years ago, in a time known as the Mesozoic Era. This was many millions of years before the first modern humans,Â Homo sapiens, appeared.\n\nScientists divide the Mesozoic Era into three periods: theÂ Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. During this era, the land gradually split from one huge supercontinent into smaller ones. The associated changes in the climate and vegetation affected how dinosaurs evolved.\n\nTriassic Period (252 to 201 million years ago)\n\nAll continents during the Triassic Period were part of aÂ single land mass called Pangaea. This meant that differences between animals or plants found in different areas were minor.\n\nThe Triassic climate was relativelyÂ hot and dry, and much of the land was covered withÂ large deserts. Unlike today, there wereÂ no polar ice caps.\n\nIt was in this environment that the reptiles known asÂ dinosaurs first evolved. Reptiles tend to flourish in hot climates because their skin is less porous than, for example, mammal skin, so it loses less water in the heat. Reptile kidneys are also better at conserving water.\n\nToward the end of the Triassic, a series ofÂ earthquakes and massive volcanic eruptionsÂ caused Pangaea to slowly begin to break into two. This was theÂ birth of the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nDuring the Jurassic Period, the single land mass,Â Pangaea, split into two, creating Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. Despite this separation, similarities in their fossil records show that there were some land connections between the two continents early in the Jurassic. These regions became more distinct later in the period.\n\nTemperatures fell slightly, although it was still warmer than today due to higher amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Â Rainfall increasedÂ as a result of the large seas appearing between the land masses.\n\nThese changesÂ allowed plants such as ferns and horsetails to grow over huge areas. Some of this vegetation became the fossil fuels that we mine today. Elsewhere there wereÂ forests of tall conifer treesÂ such as sequoias and monkey puzzles.\n\nCretaceous Period (145 to 66 million years ago)\n\nDuring the Cretaceous theÂ land separated further into some of the continents we recognise today, although in different positions. This meant that dinosaurs evolved independently in different parts of the world, becomingÂ more diverse.\n\nSauropods reached their largest sizes in the Cretaceous. The biggest were the titanosaurs. Patagotitan was a staggering 37.5 metres long!Â\n\nOther groups of organisms also diversified. The first snakes evolved during this time, and by the end of the Cretaceous, flowering plants were a much more common part of Earth's plant life.\n\nVariousÂ insect groups also appeared, including bees, which helped increase the spread of flowering plants. And mammals now included tree climbers, ground dwellers and even predators of small dinosaurs.\n\nDid you know?\n\nSea levels rose and fellÂ repeatedly during the Cretaceous Period. At the highest point there were many shallow seas separating parts of the continents we know today. For example, Europe was made up of many smaller islands. Thick layers of sediment built up at the bottom of these seas asÂ single-celled algaeÂ died and theirÂ skeletons fell to the seabed.\n\nThis is how most of theÂ chalkÂ we use today was first formed. So much so, that 'Cretaceous' comes from the Latin word for chalk,Â 'creta'.\n\nDiscover what killed the dinosaurs >"
