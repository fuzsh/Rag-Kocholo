        "text": "A personal digital wallet for EU citizens and residents\n\nThe EU Digital Identity will be available to EU citizens, residents, and businesses who want to identify themselves or provide confirmation of certain personal information. It can be used for both online and offline public and private services across the EU.\n\nEvery EU citizen and resident in the Union will be able to use a personal digital wallet.\n\nBenefits of the EU Digital Identity\n\nThe right of every person eligible for a national ID card to have a digital identity that is recognised anywhere in the EU\n\nA simple and safe way to control how much information you want to share with services that require sharing of information\n\nOperated via digital wallets available on mobile phone apps and other devices to:\n\nidentify online and offline\n\nstore and exchange information provided by governments e.g. name, surname, date of birth, nationality\n\nstore and exchange the information provided by trusted private sources\n\nuse the information as confirmation of the right to reside, to work, or to study in a certain Member State\n\nOnline consultation platform on European Digital Identity Wallets\n\nFollowing a Commission Recommendation from 3 June 2021, a Member States Expert Groups is developing a Toolbox including a technical Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), a set of common standards and technical specifications and a set of common guidelines and best practice, to make European Digital Identity Wallets truly a practical tool for all. The Commission regularly publishes the results of the work of the expert group.\n\nPrior to its roll-out in Member States, the EU Digital Identity Wallet is piloted in four large scale projects, that launched on 1 April 2023. The objective of these projects is to test digital identity wallets in real-life scenarios spanning different sectors. Over 250 private companies and public authorities across 25 Member States and Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine will participate.\n\nThe European Commission will also provide a prototype of a EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI) as set out in the proposed European Digital Identity Regulation.\n\nWhy is it needed?\n\nDigital identification systems offered by governments in the EU today have several important shortcomings: they are not available to the whole population, they are often limited to online public services and not allow for seamless access cross-border.\n\nOnly 14% of key public service providers across all Member States allow cross-border authentication with an e-Identity system, for example to prove a person’s identity on the internet without the need for a password. The number of successful cross-border authentications per year is very small, though on the increase.\n\n72% of users want to know how their data is processed when they use social media accounts. 63% of EU citizens want a secure single digital ID for all online services (Eurobarometer survey)\n\nKey principles\n\nAvailable to any EU citizen, resident, or business in the EU who wants to use it\n\nWidely useable as a way of identification or to confirm certain personal attributes for the purpose of access to public and private digital services across the EU\n\nGiving full control to users to choose which aspects of their identity, data and certificates they share with third parties, and keep track of such sharing\n\nUsing the EU Digital Identity: applying for a bank loan\n\nApplying for a bank loan is a process that typically includes numerous steps, from setting up appointments and having physical meetings, to collecting and signing all the paper documents - and repeating the operation if documents are missing.\n\nBy using the EU Digital Identity, the user only has to select the necessary documents that are stored locally on his digital wallet to reply to the bank’s request. Then, verifiable digital documents are created and sent securely for verification to the bank, who can then continue with the application process.\n\nMaking things easier for citizens and businesses\n\nThe following identification and trust services can already be used with legal effect across the EU thanks to the trust framework created by the eIDAS Regulation. They are key tools to enable trust and security in the Digital Single Market. Some services, like eSignatures, will be integrated into the wallet to facilitate their use.\n\nCitizens Businesses\n\nDocuments\n\nProposal for a European Digital Identity Regulation\n\nEuropean Digital Identity Recommendation\n\nImpact Assessment\n\nReport on the evaluation of the eIDAS Regulation"
