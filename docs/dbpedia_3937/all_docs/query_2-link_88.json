        "text": "UM defines plagiarism as “the presentation or use of information, ideas, images, sentences, findings, etc. as one’s own without appropriate citation in a written assignment, test or final examination.”\n\nPlagiarism can be intentional or unintentional. It is plagiarism whether you just can't remember where you got an idea, or you simply forget to add a citation.\n\nOther terms for plagiarism include: academic dishonesty, academic misconduct, improper citation, failure to cite, unreferenced quotes and passages, unreferenced sources, re-writing without citing.\n\nUM defines cheating as “the circumventing of fair testing procedures or contravention of exam regulations. Such acts may be planned or may be unintentional or opportunistic.”\n\nIf you do anything during an exam that gives you an advantage, it is considered cheating. It is also your responsibility to protect your answers from view during an exam.\n\nOther terms for cheating include talking during exams, contravention of exam regulations and bringing in cheat sheets.\n\nAt the University of Manitoba, inappropriate collaboration occurs, “when a student and any other unauthorized person work together on assignments, projects, tests, labs or other work intended to be individual.\"\n\nLearning how to work with other people is a big part of your university education, but so is learning to work by yourself. While it might be obvious you shouldn't work with a partner on some assignments, there are other situations where the line between appropriate and inappropriate collaboration can seem fuzzy.\n\nOther terms for inappropriate collaboration include unauthorized assistance, collusion, unequal group or team contribution.\n\nUM considers duplicate submission as, “cheating where a student submits a paper, assignment or test in full or in part, for more than one course without the permission of the course instructor.”\n\nThe university expects you to do new and original work for each class instead of re-using a previously submitted paper. If you are writing similar papers, have overlap between them, or need to build on a point you've made before, you need to first ask your professor, and then cite yourself.\n\nOther terms for duplicate submission include: self-plagiarism, copying yourself.\n\nUM defines personation as, “the writing of an assignment, lab, test, or examination for another student, or the unauthorized use of another person’s signature or identification in order to impersonate someone else. Personation includes both the personator and the person initiating the personation.”\n\nPersonation is straightforward. If you do something in place of another student, or another student does something in place of you, both of you have committed personation.\n\nOther terms for personation include writing a paper or assignment or lab for another student and forging signatures or names on class attendance records.\n\nUM defines academic fraud as, “falsification of data or official documents as well as the falsification of medical or compassionate circumstances/documentation to gain accommodations to complete assignments, tests or examinations.\"\n\nSometimes you don't get the results you were expecting. You might be tempted to change data or results slightly, especially if it seems like a minor detail. But if everyone changed their results just a bit when it came to their work, how could we trust any research? Academic fraud has big implications, not just for you, but for everyone else.\n\nOther names for academic fraud include falsification, fabrication, scientific fraud, making up data, changing data, misrepresenting ideas, submitting made-up data, application fraud and forged documentation."
