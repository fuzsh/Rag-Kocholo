        "text": "Fast and easy to use\n\nGoogle Scholar can lead to hundreds of relevant \"scholarly\" articles in seconds. It has a search interface similar to Google so it is clean and simple to use.\n\nProvides a \"cited by\" feature\n\nGoogle Scholar includes a list of references under each source. Next to each paper list is \"cited by\" link. Clicking on this link shows Google's citation analysis-- all the pages pointing to the original one listed are displayed.\n\nProvides formatted citations\n\nClick on \"cite\" link for citations in MLA, APA, or Chicago style. You may also import citations to BibTeX, EndNote, RefMan, or RefWorks from Google Scholar. Make sure to double check the citation formal provided with specific instructions from your professor and the resources provided on How to Cite Sources.\n\nProvides library links\n\nIf an article is available at McQuade, the \"Find it @ McQuade\" link leads you directly to the article via McQuade Library for free.\n\nFind open access journals\n\nSee full text of articles from open access journals and pre-print repositories that may not be in the library databases. To learn more about open access see the Public Library of Science The Case for Open Access page.\n\nFind science and technology articles\n\nCurrently Google Scholar is strongest in scientific, technical and medical disciplines thanks to partners such as PubMed, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, and the Association for Computing Machinery. New materials in the social sciences and humanities are being added. You'll also find article citations from databases such as Project Muse and Ingenta.\n\nFind patents and legal documents\n\nGoogle Scholar has added the capability to include patents in an article search and to search for legal documents. If you are interested in legal documents you can narrow your results by state and court by clicking the legal documents button under the main Google Scholar search box. However, Google Scholar should be used either to get your feet wet at the beginning of your searching or as a last resort. (See weeknesses.)\n\nIs everything really \"scholarly\"?\n\nNO and Google has yet to reveal what criteria they are using to select \"scholarly\" material.\n\nAs always, it is important to review and assess each source for its authority and quality for your research.\n\nHey-- I have to pay?!\n\nGoogle Scholar often links to papers and articles on commercial publisher websites. These sites will ask you to buy a subscription or pay for an article. DO NOT pay for articles. Use the \"Find it @ McQuade\" links to find a copy of the item. The options listed on the \"Find it @ McQuade\" menu will help you obtain the item -- either through a subscription, in print, or through interlibrary loan.\n\nNo full text?\n\nGoogle Scholar is NOT a full text database. Most records in Google Scholar are journal article citations, not articles in their entirety. Articles indexed in Google Scholar may be accessible through Academic Search Premier, Nexis Uni, ScienceDirect College Edition or other quality McQuade Library databases. Select \"Find it @ McQuade\" to see if we have full text access.\n\nMy results are all over the place. Is there a way to sort results?\n\nKeep in mind that a regular search displays highly relevant citations at the top of the list (just like in Google), not the most current materials. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to sort, import, or email results like in McQuade databases. Use the \"Advanced Scholar Search\" option by clicking on the down arrow in the search box. A pop-up will appear to limit by date range and take advantage of other advanced searching features.\n\nSometimes I'm not sure what I'm looking at.\n\nYour results may contain a hodgepodge of sources (including citations, cited references, and books). Also duplicate and fragmentary entries may appear, as well as different editions of works, such as pre-prints, which may vary from the version published in a journal. Ask a librarian for help if you are confused. Librarians are available by chat, text, phone, email or in the Research Center on the 2nd floor of McQuade Library.\n\nPatent and Legal Document Searching\n\nGoogle Scholar's own disclaimer states that, \"legal opinions in Google Scholar are provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied on as a substitute for legal advice from a licensed lawyer. Google does not warrant that the information is complete or accurate.\" Use the Google Scholar for legal searching with this disclaimer in mind. It may be a helpful place to start to get to the place where the primary legal documents reside or as a last resort."
