        "text": "After spending billions of dollars to beat Google at its own game, Microsoft has concluded that it needs to start over selling its search engine to the public.\n\nThe company has decided to rename the service now called Windows Live Search and has started testing a new search design with Microsoft employees, according to an executive briefed on the changes. The test uses the domain Kumo.com, but that is only one of several names being considered for the service, the executive said.\n\nOn Monday, Satya Nadella, a Microsoft senior vice president who runs the engineering for its online operation, sent a memo to all employees, asking them to try out the new service. He wrote that Microsoft is going to test various features, but they are meant to offer various ways to make it easier for people to accomplish whatever goals brought them to the search engine:\n\nWe believe we can provide a better and more useful search experience that helps you not just search but accomplish tasks. During the test, features will vary by country, but you’ll see results organized in a way that saves you more time. An explorer pane on the left side of results pages will give you access to tools that help you with your tasks. Other features like single session history and hover preview help accomplish more in search sessions.\n\n(There is nothing in this description, or in the screen shots that have been sent around, that looks the slightest bit like an advance to the state of the art.)\n\nThe new positioning is being overseen by Yusuf Mehdi, a senior vice president. Mr. Mehdi previously ran marketing for Microsoft’s online operations and introduced a new MSN logo and the slogan, “It’s Better With the Butterfly.” That was for the MSN 8 online service, back when Microsoft was trying to overtake AOL. (That didn’t work either.)\n\nIn 2006, after switching its strategy to focus on search, Microsoft decided to rename parts of its decade-old MSN Internet service using the Windows Live brand. Few outside Redmond thought that this brand would do anything for Microsoft. It seemed to say “from the people who brought you the Blue Screen of Death.” Now the brand adds all the warm associations people have about Windows Vista as well.\n\nMicrosoft’s own research shows that Windows Live Search has almost no awareness among the public. That should mean there is nowhere to go but up."
