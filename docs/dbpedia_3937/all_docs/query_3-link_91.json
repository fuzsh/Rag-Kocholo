        "text": "We’re thrilled to welcome transfer and graduate students to our residence halls! If you’re a student looking to build friendships and engage in the campus community quickly, consider living on campus. The experiences and knowledge that you bring from your former institution are valuable and will enrich our campus culture.\n\nWe can’t wait to see all the new experiences and learning opportunities that the residence halls have in store for you as you join our community!\n\nView Residence Hall and Apartment Information\n\nLiving off-campus can be fun and exciting, and we’re here to help you with all of your off-campus needs. We want you to have an extraordinary and successful off-campus living experience.\n\nIf you’ve been approved to live off-campus, here’s a handy Off-Campus Resource Guide (PDF) to help you consider where to live.\n\nPreparing to Move In\n\nNow that you’ve found your new apartment or house, moving in is accompanied by many different responsibilities you didn’t have before. So, what’s next? Here are some steps to take that can help you experience a successful move:\n\nSchedule a date to pick up your keys: Ask your landlord to do a walk-through before you move your furniture into the unit.\n\nSet up utilities:\n\nUtilities include gas, electricity, water/sewage, internet, etc.\n\nGenerally, the tenant will be responsible for arranging for utility connections. It’s best to contact companies at least two weeks before moving in. You may need the following to set up your utility account:\n\nRental address\n\nDeposit fee\n\nProof of identity (license, student ID, military ID, etc.)\n\nEither your Social Security Number or a passport\n\nReserve a moving truck or friends to help you move: Reserve a moving truck well in advance so you’re ready to go on move-in day.\n\nBuy renters insurance: Renters insurance is a must-have, inexpensive, and offers benefits to students. Make certain your policy takes effect the day you get your keys and move in.\n\nVisit Transportation Services: Learn more about the shuttle program, buy a parking permit, or purchase a bus pass.\n\nDo a fire safety check: Ask your landlord to provide the following if they aren’t already present in the unit:\n\nA fire extinguisher for each floor of the rental unit.\n\nSmoke and carbon monoxide detectors should be installed on each floor and in each bedroom. A combined 2-in-1 device is less expensive and commonly available.\n\nYou can also visit the Tenant Resource Center to learn about your rights in Dane County, where Edgewood College resides.\n\nYes, Edgewood College has a 2-year residency requirement. The reason we require this is to enrich your college experience and strengthen the sense of community for all on-campus students. Studies have shown that the first 2 years of college are a critical time for you to develop academic and social networks to help you succeed in your studies and remain motivated.\n\nYou can count on us to create a supportive and positive campus environment that helps you stay engaged and learn better. This is especially important for freshmen and sophomores who are just beginning their academic journey.\n\nIf you are under 21 and attending Edgewood College, you’ll need to live on campus for your first 2 academic years. However, if you prefer, you can choose to live with a family member or legal guardian who is over 25 and lives within a reasonable commuting distance.\n\nIf you enroll in and move into the dorms during your first year at college, you’ll be contractually obligated to stay for 2 years. However, there are some exceptions to this policy. If you have children, live in a domestic partnership, are a veteran, or aren’t a full-time student, you aren’t required to stay for 2 years. Additionally, if you study abroad, this can be considered as fulfilling the residency requirement."
