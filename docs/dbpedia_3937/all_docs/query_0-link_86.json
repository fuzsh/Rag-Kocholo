Chinese-language literature about Wikipedia: a meta- analysis of academic search engine result pages Han-Teng Liao Oxford Internet Institute University of Oxford Oxford, United Kingdom hanteng@gmail.com Bin Zhang Center for the Studies of Information Resources Wuhan University Wuhan 430072, P. R. China zb0205@126.com ABSTRACT This paper presents a webometric analysis of the academic search engine result pages (SERPs) of the Chinese-language term of “Wikipedia” across major Chinese-speaking regions of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Because of the academic outcome, the findings can also be interpreted for further meta- analysis, or “research about research”, of the Wikipedia research in Chinese-language literatures. The findings cover the results from four major search platforms: CNKI Scholar, Google Scholar China, Google Scholar Hong Kong and Google Scholar Taiwan. Cross tabulation of the results shows the major institutions (journals and academic departments) and scholarly archives for Chinese-language Wikipedia research. The findings suggest that there exists a divide between mainland Chinese academic sources/search results on one hand, and Hong Kong/Taiwanese ones on the other. Meta-analysis based on academic SERPs have implications for identifying the gaps and potentials in internationalization of Wikipedia research. Categories and Subject Descriptors [World Wide Web]: Web searching and information discovery – Web search engines, Page and site ranking Keywords Chinese Internet, Chinese research on Wikipedia, academic search engines, academic databases. 1. INTRODUCTION The ideal of using human knowledge to engage citizens has often been subject to parochial and national concerns despite the universal ideal of enlightenment encyclopedias. During the European enlightenment, geographic and linguistic barriers were among the major challenges for knowledge collection and diffusion [2, 6, 12]. Facing similar challenges, the Wikimedia Foundation, the hosting organization for all Wikipedia projects, has targeted the “Global South” regions of Brazil, India, and the Arabic language countries for engagement [3]. Nonetheless, some research has suggested that cultural and linguistic factors have prevented wider acceptance of Wikipedia, especially the Chinese and Korean versions [14, 16]. Thus, internationalization of Wikipedia research is needed for better understanding of the Wikipedia research around the world beyond English-language literatures. This paper aims to contribute to such internationalization efforts by looking at the current published Chinese-language literature as reported by major academic search engine results. 2. Methods The exploratory method mimics the information seeking actions likely to be executed by Chinese-language Wikipedia researchers. The query of the Chinese-language term “Wikipedia” is submitted to major academic search engine platforms, and then the search engine result pages (SERPs) are scraped and mined for further analysis. Because of the academic outcome, the expected findings can be interpreted for further meta-analysis, or “research about research” [1], of the Wikipedia research in Chinese-language literatures. It should be noted, however, the meta-analysis applied to social science research often involves a hypothesis that are being examined by a body of work. The work to be presented in this paper, on the other hand, is more of a descriptive meta-analysis of search engine result pages, or “search about research”. The aim of the research is to identify search result patterns based on the results provided by popular Chinese-language search platform as an exploratory study, not to test a hypothesis normally seen in meta-analysis. 2.1 Data selection and data sets This study includes CNKI scholar and three localized versions of Google Scholar (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan). CNKI refers to Chinse National Knowledge Infrastructure that was established in 1999 by Tsinghua University and Tsinghua Tongfang, with the aim to “achieve full social sharing and dissemination of knowledge resources”[5, 7, 17]. For data collection, the Chinese term “Wikipedia” was submitted to the four academic search engines, with the number of results shown in Table 1. Because mainland China uses simplified Chinese script and Hong Kong and Taiwan use traditional Chinese script[10], the queries of “Wikipedia” were submitted to the academic search engine platforms differently accordingly. For mainland Chinese platforms, the query of “维基百科” is used. For Hong Kong and Taiwan, the query of “維基百科” is used. Each search engine reported having different number of results: ranging from the highest one reported by Google Scholar China to the lowest one reported by CNKI scholar. However, these numbers do not correspond to the numbers of results that users can actually view. For instance, CNKI scholar has a limit at 500 and the Google Scholar has a cap at 1000, thereby imposing a limit on the number of samples for this research.

The dataset examined in this paper thus contains 3464 data points in total, each of which contains, if available, meta information of title, authors, institutions, links and short descriptions of the result. Table 1.

Results The findings of crosstabs are presented as follows. As the results for Google Scholar Hong Kong and Google Scholar Taiwan are almost identical (only 13 different out of 1000 results), only the results for Google Scholar Taiwan will be listed if the crosstabs results are identical for both Google Scholar Taiwan and Google Scholar Hong Kong. 3.1 Major (publishing) institutions Table 2 lists the most frequently-appearing source institutions, which include academic journals, degree-granting institutions and popular science magazines. Only those receive 10 or more hits in total are listed. Table 2.

Taiwanese journals such as NTUA Department of Graphic Communication Arts, and Performance Arts Review are also listed in Table 2. The listed degree-granting academic bodies include both Taiwanese (MBA and education dissertations) and mainland Chinese (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Harbin Institute of Technology) ones. The remaining listed institutions include three popular science magazines: China Internet Weekly, \"Youth Reporter\"(author’s translation) magazine, and China Internet Magazine. A clear division is shown in Table 2 between the mainland Chinese and Taiwanese results. (The Hong Kong results are identical to the Taiwanese ones.) Table 2 shows no overlapping results. Between CNKI Scholar and Google Scholar China, substantial overlapping results exists for journals and magazines. Google Scholar China does not seem to include as many degree dissertations as CNKI Scholar. 3.2 Major (archive) platforms Table 3 lists the most frequently appearing source platforms for each search engine results. (The Hong Kong results are identical to the Taiwanese ones.) As these data points indicate potential clicks to the websites that provide either the metadata or full texts of the citation, they provide important insights into the major academic (archive) database online platforms in the Chinese- speaking regions. Table 3. Most frequently appearing source platforms CNKI Scholar Google Scholar China Google Scholar Taiwan Grand Total CNKI platfrom 464 219 0 683 Education Taiwan 0 2 605 607 Miscellaneous 0 346 248 594 CQVIP platform 0 378 0 378 Airitilibrary platform 0 0 147 147 Wanfang Data platform 0 55 0 55 Grand Total 464 1000 1000 2464 It is clear that CKNI Scholar is the academic database itself with all the links pointing to its own sites. In contrast, Google Scholar China links outwards to three mainland Chinese academic databases: CNKI platform, CQVIP platform, Wangfang Data platform. CQVIP refers to Chongqing VIP Information Co., Ltd., a company has its historical roots under the Chinse Ministry of Science and Technology and is a strategic partner of Google search since 2005. Wangfang Data is another joint enterprise by various Chinese research institutes and publishers [5, 7, 17]. Google Scholar Taiwan links to mostly Taiwanese education websites with the domain names of “edu.tw” and a Taiwanese academic database called Airitilibrary platform. Again, judging from the archive academic database results, there is little overlapping among the search results. The only exceptions are first the links to CNKI platform by CNKI Scholar and Google Scholar China, and second the two links to Taiwanese educational websites by Google Scholar China and Google Scholar Taiwan.\n\n3. 3 When compared with CNKI Scholar, Google Scholar China is more neutral in terms of platform choices given to the users. Table 4 shows the same data points listed in Table 3 with the details of the subdomain names. CNKI Scholar and Google Scholar China links to different web interfaces hosted by the CNKI, with heavy concentration of links in certain subdomain names. Google Scholar Taiwan’s links to Taiwanese educational websites are much less concentrated. Table 4.

Figure 1 shows the results from 2002 to 2014, indicating a general trend of growth from 2002 to 2011. (The Hong Kong results are identical to the Taiwanese ones.) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 CNKI Scholar Google Scholar CN Google Scholar HK Google Scholar TW Figure 1. The trendlines for number of publications each year One should not jump into the conclusion by interpreting the results of the years of 2012-2014 as indication of decline. The new publications may still be in the process of archiving or indexing. In early 2012, based on the doctoral and master theses from Taiwanese and mainland Chinese databases, we observed a growing trend from 2003 to 2009 (for Taiwan) or 2010 (for mainland China), and then a decrease in numbers from 2010 onwards to 2012 [9]. In light of the new findings shown in Figure 1, the 2011 results indicate a continuing growth for the Google Scholar China and CNKI scholar results, and a rebound for the Google Scholar Taiwan results. Hence, it is more likely that there exists a two- to three-year window where fresh publications can be archived and indexed by major Chinese-language academic databases. 4. Discussion The status of the Chinese-language literature regarding Wikipedia, based on the SERPs from major academic search platforms across the regions of mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, provide interesting findings as follows. First, the presence of major institutions of academic journals, degree-granting bodies, and popular science magazines indicate a substantial interest of these regions in Wikipedia. The distribution appears to focus on information and library science, management studies, popular science on the Internet. Little overlapping exists though between mainland Chinese and Hong Kong/Taiwanese results. Second, the linking patterns show a distinct choice of academic databases used by these academic search platforms. CNKI Scholar seems to keep the links to its own websites. Google Scholar China links more evenly among three mainland Chinese academic databases: CNKI, CQVIP and Wangfang Data. In addition to several Taiwanese educational websites, Google Scholar Taiwan links to a Taiwanese academic database Airitilibrary platform. Third, the trend graph based on the reported publication years indicate a growing number of publications from 2002 to 2011. In conjunction with the previous observation made in 2012[9], the currently shown decreasing results for 2012-2014 are likely the outcomes of the possible two- to three-year window for a Chinese-language publication to be archived and indexed. The findings show a worrying situation where there exists little overlapping results between the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong/Taiwanese results. It is worrying because Chinese Wikipedia project is actually an open collaboration project contributed and managed by Chinese Wikipedians across these Chinese-speaking regions and beyond[11]. Wikipedia researchers who intend to conduct a literature review on Chinese-language literatures must, at the current situation, acknowledge the division of the found academic search results and find literature across Chinese-language academic search platforms. Otherwise, the coverage of the literature review is likely to be bounded and thus limited to a certain regional perspective. After trying entering different Chinese scripts into different search engines, we found that the Google Scholar results appear to return different results if the keywords were typed in different scripts. In contrast, the CNKI Scholar results appear to return similar and even smaller number of results. It means that users of Google Scholar can simply switch the keywords between traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese scripts for different scopes of results. It also presents a search engine design challenge in integrating sources that contain some degree of geolinguistic"
