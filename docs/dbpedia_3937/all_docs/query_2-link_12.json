        "text": "The Internet is home to a tremendous amount of information, but not all of it is reliable or true. Since anyone is free to build whatever website they wish, much of the information available isn't subject to the same level of quality control found in resources like scholarly journals. Many Internet resources don't undergo any editing or fact-checking to ensure that the information is truthful and accurate. It is often up to Internet users to evaluate whether or not information is credible.\n\nTo determine the credibility of a website, use the ABCs of Internet source evaluation:\n\nAccuracy: Is the information verifiable as true?\n\nAuthority: Is the author or website trustworthy regarding the subject?\n\nBias: Is the information presented objectively?\n\nCoverage: How comprehensive is the information?\n\nCurrency: How recently was the information published?\n\nAccuracy\n\nTo evaluate the accuracy of the information in Internet resources, you should ask:\n\nAre specific sources cited by the author? And if so, are they reliable? Check the bibliography, footnotes, or reference list.\n\nCan another source verify the information? Ensure that the information is available from more than one source.\n\nDid editors or reviewers fact-check the information?\n\nDoes the information contain spelling or grammar errors? Poorly written content may indicate poorly researched information.\n\nEvaluating Sources: Accuracy\n\nEvaluating Sources for Accuracy\n\nFinding Accurate Information on the Internet\n\nAuthority\n\nTo evaluate whether an Internet resource is authoritative, you should ask:\n\nDoes the website display the author's name and credentials? Is the author part of a respected organization or institution, such as a university?\n\nWho oversees the website?\n\nWhat was the purpose of creating the website? Check the \"about\" or \"background\" sections to find out where the information originates.\n\nWhat type of website is it? Personal blogs or social media websites like Facebook and Twitter will require you to closely review the author's level of experience to determine authority.\n\nWhat type of domain is the information on? Domains that end in .edu, .com, .biz, .gov, and .org can give you an insight into a website's credibility.\n\nHow Do I Know if My Sources Are Credible/Reliable?\n\nEvaluating Authority of Websites and Blogs\n\nEvaluating a Website or Publication's Authority\n\nBias\n\nTo evaluate whether an Internet resource has a bias, you should ask:\n\nIs the information presented fact-based or opinion-based? Review the citations.\n\nDoes the information have a political or religious motivation? Check sections titled \"about,\" \"purpose,\" or \"mission statement\" to evaluate the author's purpose in creating the information.\n\nIs the information on the website presented to entertain or inform?\n\nDoes the information contain advertisements for a brand, product, or service, or are they separate from the content?\n\nHow Biased Information on the Internet Can Influence Research\n\nHow to Evaluate Bias in Information Sources\n\nScholarly Voice: Avoiding Bias\n\nCoverage\n\nTo evaluate how comprehensive the coverage of Internet resources is, you should ask:\n\nIs any relevant information excluded from the page? Check all pages on a website or any relevant links to search for missing information.\n\nDoes the coverage of the subject matter go in depth? Are enough details provided?\n\nWho is the intended audience for the information? Information created for students or the general public may not be sufficiently detailed.\n\nIs the information presented on a commercial website? Be wary of sites that require you to pay for access to all of the information.\n\nIs the website the best available source for the information? More comprehensive coverage may be found in other sources.\n\nFind Better Coverage and Trace Claims Back to the Original Source\n\nHow to Determine the Scope of Coverage\n\nEvaluating Internet Sources: Coverage\n\nCurrency\n\nTo evaluate how current an Internet resource is, you should ask:\n\nWhen was the information first published?\n\nHas the page been kept up to date? If a page contains several broken links, that may indicate that the information has not been updated in a while.\n\nHow current does the information need to be to meet your research needs?\n\nEvaluating Website Currency\n\nOnline Sources: Currency, Relevance, and Authority\n\nAdditional Reading on Evaluating Internet Resources"
