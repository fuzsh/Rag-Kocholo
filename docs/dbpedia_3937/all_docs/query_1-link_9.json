        "text": "For a number of years Google Scholar has been the most popular academic search engine. Sure there have been others (e.g., ERIC) but overall I think most people would agree that they find themselves turning to Google Scholar more and more each year. Google Scholar recently developed the ability to create a Google Scholar Profile.\n\nThe following is a screenshot of my Google Scholar Profile.\n\nYou can access my live Google Scholar Profile online at: http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lvLel-MAAAAJ&hl=en. While there are problems or limitations to a Google Scholar Profile (e.g., it doesn’t differentiate how many citations are self-citations), it is a nice way to get a glimpse of all of your work on one page.\n\nRecently though Microsoft decided to challenge Google’s dominance in the academic search engine world with the development of “Microsoft Academic Search” which can be accessed at: http://academic.research.microsoft.com . And with this new tool came their equivalent of a profile. Here is an example of my Microsoft Academic Search profile:\n\nOne nice thing about Microsoft’s version is that they let you embed it:\n\n[Loading…]\n\nThe above information is generated by Microsoft Academic Search®, please visit Microsoft Academic Search for more information. Please check here for terms of use.\n\nBut as you can see from the embedded code above, it isn’t quite as clean as visiting the profile directly: http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Author/4019111/patrick-r-lowenthal"
