I can use it just fine with Enterprise bing at work, but when I log in to my personal account I get the same message about “Cannot access the internet, 2022 training model, etc”\n\nCan someone help me figure out why this is a problem for me?\n\nThere is tons of fine-tune and anti-hallucination to keep AI models that CAN’T natively browse the internet from fabricating information. Then OpenAI gave the particular users of ChatGPT Plus that function.\n\nThe way that language AI works (predicting the most likely text that follows), it can also do a good job of pretending it did something it has no capability for, thus returning untruthful information.\n\nYou can phrase your specific request “use your browse tool to search for and analyze…X.”\n\nYou can also ask on the forum for such comparative information about pricing, which here I compile and demonstrate for ranked comparison by showing the price of one million tokens of usage.\n\nModel Training 1M Input usage 1M Output usage 1M Context Length GPT-3.5-turbo-1106 $n/a $1.00 $2.00 16k (4k out) GPT-3.5-turbo $n/a $1.50 $2.00 4k GPT-3.5-turbo-16k $n/a $3.00 $4.00 16k GPT-3.5 Turbo fine-tune $8.00 $3.00 $6.00 4k GPT-4-1106 (turbo) $n/a $10.00 $30.00 125k (4k out) GPT-4 $n/a $30.00 $60.00 8k -------- ------------- ------------- ------------- ------------- babbage-002 base $n/a $0.40 $0.40 16k babbage-002 fine-tune $0.40 $1.60 $1.60 16k -------- ------------- ------------- ------------- ------------- davinci-002 base $n/a $2.00 $2.00 16k davinci-002 fine-tune $6.00 $12.00 $12.00 16k\n\nOk so I see this response:\n\n\" To enable Browse with Bing in your Beta Features setting.\n\nClick on ‘Settings & Beta’\n\nSelect ‘Beta features’\n\nToggle on ‘Browse with Bing’\n\nChoose Browse with Bing in the model selector under GPT-4.\"\n\nI have GPT 4 Plus:\n\nIt appears this does not exist:\n\nI know this response was from October so maybe I am missing something, so I still assume under my current plan I have should have this feature. I understand I could just use open up Edge and goto to bing myself but this AI right and essentially I am paying to just do it myself. It seems in efficient to be having a conversation with ChatGPT 4 and having to be told mid conversation that it can’t perform this task… Maybe its just me…\n\nI’m here in February 2024 and experiencing the same issue AGAIN. Please fix this OpenAI!!!\n\nI use the browse with Bing feature almost daily for work/research, and it being randomly taken away every few months is extremely frustrating. Today, I prompted with “using [x website] as your only source…” and immediately got the “I can’t browse using Bing or any other external search engines directly in real-time. However, I can provide information, answer questions, and perform tasks based on a wide range of data up to my last update in April 2023.”\n\nI even continued prompting variations of “why can’t you” and the only answer I got was that the feature isn’t “available or activated,” despite using it less than a week prior, continuously over the last 3-4 months with the exact same “using [x website]” prompt. UGH! lol\n\nFull GPT explanation from my further prompting:\n\nThe “browse with Bing” functionality, or the ability to perform real-time web searches and access up-to-date information directly within this conversational interface, is available under specific conditions. However, in this particular interaction setup, I’m unable to use the browser tool to directly access or fetch information from external websites, including performing searches with Bing or accessing live documents and web pages. The explanation refers to the limitations set for this specific interaction or session with me, the AI model.\n\nIn some contexts, I’m equipped with a browser tool that allows me to perform live web searches, access current events, fetch real-time information, and provide links or summaries from the web. However, in your current session with me, the browser tool functionality is not activated or available. This means I cannot access live data, perform web searches, or directly fetch information from websites in real-time. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update in April 2023, and I can’t update that information in real-time or access new content that has been published after that date.\n\nThe setup of each interaction with me can vary based on the platform, user preferences, or specific restrictions of the service being used. These setups determine which tools and functionalities are available for use during our conversation.\n\nThe reason why the browser tool functionality is not activated or available in your current session with me could be due to several factors, including the specific design choices or restrictions implemented by the platform or service you are using to interact with me. These reasons are designed with the user’s best interest in mind, balancing between providing a rich interactive experience and ensuring privacy, security, and adherence to the intended use case of the AI.\n\nTLDR: Basically an extremely vague answer of “I just can’t right now because of reasons.”\n\nUpdate 5 minutes later: I logged out and back in, and now it’s working again. Fix. Your. Sh*t. OpenAI.\n\nI’m having the same issue and tbh it feels like false advertising as the only reason I got Plus in the first place was for the real time internet access. It USED to always “Searching with Bing” before most responses, but that stopped ages ago. I’ve been using ChatGPT Plus since it came out, and now have ChatGPT Teams for my entire staff. As of a couple months ago, I get the same issues as everyone else, constant “I don’t have access to the internet.” Just now I ask a basic question about the elections referencing something from a month ago as a test to see if it uses the internet. Sure enough, it gives me information and references a website that’s 26 months old. I question it, and it goes:\n\nI referenced an outdated article in my previous response. Given the significant time since the article’s publication, it would be best to check to see if there’s anything more current or any new updates regarding this.\n\nLike, what?? I then tell it to use the internet like Bing or Google and get the latest information on this topic. It goes:\n\nI can’t browse using Bing or any other external search engines directly in real-time. However, I can provide information, answer questions, and perform tasks based on a wide range of data up to my last update in April 2023.\n\nI’ve tried posting this on reddit and got nothing but unhelpful responses acting like I’m crazy and like it has never worked before. Where I really noticed it was I had a custom GPT made months ago where the instructions said to always search documentation online to get the latest before ever responding. Any time it would respond even if I said “how are you?” it would say “Searching with Bing.” That also no longer works anymore. ChatGPT used to be so great last year but in the past few months I’m finding myself using it less and less as it’s constantly giving me wrong information and then refusing to use the internet, so even if it is giving me “correct” info, half the time it’s insanely old."
