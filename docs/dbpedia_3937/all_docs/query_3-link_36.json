TRIO includes eight programs targeted to serve and assist low-income individuals, first-generation college students, and individuals with disabilities to progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to postbaccalaureate programs. TRIO also includes a training program for directors and staff of TRIO projects.\n\nThe recipients of the grants, depending on the specific program, are institutions of higher education, public and private agencies and organizations including community-based organizations with experience in serving disadvantaged youth and secondary schools. Combinations of such institutions, agencies, and organizations may also apply for grants. These entities plan, develop and carry out the services for students. While individual students are served by these entities, they may not apply for grants under these programs. Additionally, in order to be served by one of these programs, a student must be eligible to receive services and be accepted into a funded project that serves the institution or school that student is attending or the area in which the student lives.\n\nNews and Information\n\nThe Federal TRIO Programs 2024 Low-Income Levels is available.\n\nDear Project Director Letter - ED HHS Collaboration in Support of Disconnected Youth\n\n(March 16, 2023)\n\n“Go Live” Dates for the 2022-23 TRIO Annual Performance Reports\n\nTalent Search – November 1, 2023\n\nUpward Bound/Upward Bound Math-Science – November 29, 2023\n\nStudent Support Services – December 7, 2023\n\nEducational Opportunity Centers – January 24, 2024\n\nRonald E.
