The Free State selectors have named their provisional teams for the respective rugby weeks coming up this school’s holiday. The teams will play against their opposite teams from the Griffons on 7 June at Grey College in Bloemfontein.

There are four teams altogether – the Craven Week team which will play at Affies in Pretoria. The Academy team will play in George.

The Arende play at the NWU-Pukke Week in Potchefstroom and the Kiewiete in the VKB Week in Reitz.

The Free State won the main match on the last day of the 2007 Craven Week in spectacular fashion when they smashed Western Province 52-3 at the Danie Craven-stadium in Stellenbosch.

The Kiewiete won the final of the VKB Week in Reitz against the Diamanstreek 20-17. The Kiewiete will be led by their hooker Moekoa Bolofo of Louis Botha at the tournament. Bolofo represented the Free State’s Craven Week team three times and was selected for the South African Schools side last year as a flanker.

The Craven Week team will be led by Adriaan Theisinger of Grey College. He and Milo Moholo (lock of Louis Botha) are the only survivors from last year’s Craven Week team.

Not surprisingly, Grey College dominate the teams. Their contribution is always great.
