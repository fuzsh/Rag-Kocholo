        "text": "Throughout history there have been dreams, visions and hopes for a utopian world. The history and presence of politics in South Africa abounds with moments and movements of pushing beyond and resisting 'a dog's life'. Integral to pushing beyond for a better world, are education and learning processes and practices, albeit in different shapes and forms, with varying intensities and power. This paper seeks to trace certain popular education practices that have and continue to deepen the struggle for an alternative South African society. The paper highlights the shifts and changes in popular education in response to the ebbs and flows of political struggle and movements. It is based on research entitled 'Re-membering traditions of popular education'-a recovery of popular education practices from the past that may have been forgotten and reconnection with present forms of education, organising and action. As a renewed working class movement is regrouping and growing in response to the ongoing structural violence of neo-liberal economic policies and state violence, this paper argues that popular education can play a role in contributing towards building this and other movements. Popular education can foster critical analysis in order to understand the context more deeply, name the enemy and foster openness and hope in searching for and imagining a collective alternative. This paper is part of a 3 year research project entitled 'Re-membering Traditions of Popular Education', which aims to uncover and recover forgotten traditions of popular learning and education in South Africa. 'Re-membering' suggests two things: firstly, a process of casting one's mind to call up something that may have been forgotten, a finding and retrieving in order to reveal, a recollection, uncovering of something that was neglected or no longer recognised as being there. Secondly, remembering suggests an act of connecting what has been severed, a re-attaching, a putting together what has been kept apart and re-establishing of relations between parts that belong together. The project aims to shed light on processes of activist education that\n\nThe issue of social justice, with Rawls (1971) theory of justice in particular, underlies this thesis. It is introduced and illustrated within the context of education in post-apartheid South Africa, together with aspects such as Bourdieu’s (1997) social and cultural capital, hegemonic and counter-hegemonic discourses and the anti-colonial framework. Through the findings collected in five South African high schools of various socioeconomic, cultural and racial background, located in the province KwaZulu-Natal, this thesis focus on the ways in which South African schools have addressed issues of difference and inequality inherited from their apartheid past. Moreover, the thesis looks into the value of various cultures and knowledge traditions as perceived by the learners, teachers and principals participating in this study. The research employs a mixed-method research strategy, which has integrated both qualitative and quantitative research methods through interviews, focus groups, observations and questionnaires. It examines the extent to which there is an acknowledgement of different knowledge and cultural backgrounds within current educational policy and practice. The thesis argues that the current approach to social justice and redress is limited by a narrow interpretation of the country’s social inequalities."
