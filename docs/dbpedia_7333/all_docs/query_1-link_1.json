        "text": "Historic Overview Grey vs Paul Roos Gymnasium since 1967\n\n38. 2023 Grey College 28 (20) vs Paul Roos Gymnasium 20 (11) home\n\n37. 2022 Grey College 19 vs Paul Roos Gymnasium 34 away*\n\n36. 2019 Grey College 51 (22) vs Paul Roos Gymnasium 28 (21) away\n\nThis cameraderie resulted in numerous friendships that were forged off the field in subsequent years. In the Paul Roos 1967 team was Johan Carinus (who now farms outside Stellenbosch) and among their matrics of that year was business tycoon Johann Rupert and Braam van Velde (who also farms outside Stellenbosch these days).\n\nAll three Paul Roos old boys became very good friends with the Grey fullback, Wilhelm Landman, and later in life Rupert played a big role in Landman’s career when Landman became the MD of Richmont South Africa.\n\nDawie Snyman (who later became Springbok) was also the assistant coach of the Paul Roos First Rugby Team. All these seeds were already planted during the first Grey vs Paul Roos match in 1967 in Stellenbosch.\n\n1974\n\nPaul Roos went on tour to the Free State and their first game was against Sentraal where Paul Roos lock-forward George Rautenbach’s ear was stepped on by a Tralie player and resulted in George missing the Grey game with a hole in his ear.\n\nThe Paul Roos team had 3 Western Province Craven Week players – George Rautenbach, Agie Koch and Jan (Gans) Coetzee. Agie was then chosen as captain against Grey.\n\nThe majority of the Grey team played for Free State Schools that year and Jan Geldenhuys and Gerhard Weitz were selected for SA Schools. Grey had a strong pack of forwards but was equally matched by Paul Roos with their stalwart WP Craven Week lock Jan (Gans) Coetzee.\n\nGrey won 22-3 and ten days later 14 of the Grey team was selected for Free State Craven Week which lost against WP. Several of the Paul Roos players played for WP Craven Week and this time George was fit to play with special protection that was made for his ear. George played for the SA Schools team that toured overseas later that year along with Jan Geldenhuys from Grey.\n\nBoth Jan and George became team mates again in subsequent years at Maties in Stellenbosch.\n\nGeorge Rautenbach also founded MEGAPRO in 1986 – South Africa’s first Sports Marketing agency. Today George is not only the face of MEGAPRO but arguably the face of Sports Marketing in South Africa.\n\n1977\n\nGrey played Paul Roos on tour in the Cape after the Craven Week. The match was remembered as a mud bath and given all the rain leading up to the match the venue was switched to Coetzenberg B field. Despite the heavy field Grey scored four tries and beat Paul Roos 20-10. This Grey First Team had four SA Schools players – Jan Richter, Jacques Nell, Abrie Marais, and Willem Daffue.\n\nSA Schools Grey also produced a record four old Boys (Morne du Plessis (captain), Dawie Snyman (vice-captain), Theuns Stofberg and Robbie Blair) in the starting Springbok team against the World XV of Willie-John McBride during the inauguration of the new Loftus Versfeld.\n\nTwo of these Grey old boys’ sons went to school at Paul Roos (Robbie Blair and Theuns Stofberg) while Dawie Snyman is assistant coach at Paul Roos today.\n\n1988\n\nIn 1988 Grey played Paul Roos the first time again since 1977 during a pre- season tour to the Cape. It was their second game of the season on 30 March 1988 at Markotter in Stellenbosch. There was a large crowd and the legendary Doc Craven also attended the game.\n\nThe 1988 Grey First Team had five Springboks – Charl Marais, Ruben Kruger, Pieter Muller, Naka Drotske and Heinrich Fuls. Andre Blom went on to play for the US Eagles. The entire Grey First XV was chosen for the starting line up of the Free State Cravenweek that year.\n\nAlso in the Grey team was Jannie Momberg who attended Paul Roos until std.8 before he finished off his school career at Grey following in the footsteps of his brothers – Niels and Steyn while his younger brother Altus also attend Grey all the way from Stellenbosch.\n\nAs a result, this was a unique experience for Jannie who was probably the only person at the game that knew all 30 players (many of his primary school friends also played for Paul Roos). Even the referee Johan Carinus (who played for Paul Roos against Grey in 1967) was an old friend of Jannie’s family.\n\nAlthough Grey had several future Springboks in their team, they were still finding their feet and hadn’t “clicked” as a unit yet in the early season. Nevertheless, Charl Marais scored Grey’s first try in the corner after a grubber from Naka Drotske.\n\nThe game was fairly close and Grey won the game in the final minutes with a disputed try by Pieter Muller. To most observers he knocked the ball on, however the referee allowed the try and Grey won 16-9.\n\n1989\n\nIn 1989 it was Paul Roos touring up north during pre-season and played Grey at Shimlapark in Bloemfontein. Grey had two SA Schools players (Naka Drotske and Mark McIntyre) and beat Paul Roos 28-7.\n\n1990\n\nGrey and Paul Roos were invited to play in the main match of the Van Rensburg Rugby Day in George at the conclusion of the schoolboy rugby season.\n\nThis memorable festival originated from the Van Rensburg brothers in George who was passionate about schoolboy rugby and wanted to see SA’s top rugby schools compete against each other, especially those who does not get the opportunity to compete on a regular basis.\n\nThey were visionaries in the early nineties to host such a festival which was the front runner of many other festivals to follow many years later. The difference with the Van Rensburg Rugby Day and many other Easter Festivals is that the Rugby Day was hosted at the end of the schoolboy rugby season and comprise of one full day of rugby (vs multiple days) and included SA’s top schools as performed throughout the year.\n\nIt also included many other festivities around George throughout the weekend and thousands of spectators, fans and old boys from across the country attended this unique event which was only in existence from 1990 – 1991.\n\nThe build up to the 1990 Final match between Grey and Paul Roos was televised on TopSport TV and legendary rugby critic Zanderg Jansen was doing most of the pre- match build up. He was also the host at the event and was the judge in selecting the best team, forwards and backline of the festival, and man of the match awards from all the top rugby schools participating including Bishops, Paarl Gim, Paarl Boys’ High, Affies etc.\n\nThe following year Johan Small-Smith (Grey old boy) was passionately involved in the Festival and was also supporting Zandberg Jansen during the announcements on the best teams of the Festival.\n\nBoth Grey and Paul Roos was unbeaten leading up to this match and Grey had 5 SA Schools players in their side that year (Pieta Steenkamp, Alex Fenwick, Nico Linde, Jean Craven, and Andre Venter). The 1990 Paul Roos side was the first unbeaten Paul Roos side in 37 years and had two future Springboks – Justin Swart and Cobus Visagie.\n\nIt was a tightly contested match with Paul Roos’ forwards gaining the upperhand at scrums while Grey’s backline was firing on all cylinders. Grey’s scrumhalf and future Springbok, Werner Swanepoel, broke blindside from a scrum to score the winning try for Grey with a final score of 17-9.\n\n1991\n\nThe Paul Roos First Team of 1991 will go down as one of the best teams the school has ever produced. On 10 August 1991 as part of Paul Roos’ 125 Year Festivities the Grey First Team and Cherries was invited to play against Paul Roos at Markotter. Paul Benade (old Grey) was instrumental to help finance the transportation of the buses and other logistics for the Grey teams.\n\nThe Paul Roos First Team of 1991 had the chance to become the first undefeated Paul Roos team in 38 years and after the narrow defeat against Grey the prior year, this was always going to be the pinnacle of all schoolboy matches in 1991.\n\nIn addition, Grey had 5 SA Schools players (Andre Venter, Alex Fenwick, Werner Swanepoel, Ollie le Roux and Hugo Venter) including 2 future Springboks – Ollie and Werner. Paul Roos had 2 future Springboks (Justin Swart and Cobus Visagie) in their side which set the table for a massive showdown.\n\nBelow Match Report from Cape newspapers:\n\nIt was widely believed that highly rated Grey, fielding 11 Free State Craven Week players, could end Paul Roos’s unbeaten run, but eventually they were outclassed by committed and confident opposition.\n\nThe scoreline did not fatter the home team in the least. Initially it seemed as though the stiff breeze would play a significant role in the match, particularly when Justin Swart landed three penalty kicks within the first eight minutes by judging the wind from behind to a nicety.\n\nBut the wind did not prove much use to the hard-pressed visitors in the second half as Paul Roos simply got stronger and stronger to confirm their superiority in all departments, scoring two tries to nil to put the issue beyond any doubt.\n\nFor the first time this season, the Stellenbosch school’s backs looked the part while facing tough opposition, particularly during the second half when they ran the ball confidently and judiciously.\n\nAlthough both Paul Roos tries were scored by forwards, the backs set it up through their quality of play. Grey were, to say the least, a major disappointment. Only right at the end, when 3-20 down, were they able to mount an attack which seemed likely to produce a try, and even then they were denied that consolation.\n\nTheir forwards found the going to tough, to last the pace, while their backs over- elaboration on the attack saw movements come to naught against resolute defense.\n\nGrey’s frustration at having to play under sustained fierce pressure was probably the main reason for the South African Schools centre, Andre Venter, becoming involved in a scuffle with Bles Kemp, the Paul Roos no.8, shortly before the final whistle.\n\nThat incident, which ended only after the intervention of people on the sideline, raised questions about the appointment of Dougie Holwill as referee for a match of such magnitude.\n\nAlthough it was a clear case of foul play, Mr. Holwill did not immediately try to establish from the touch-judge closest to the incident what had happened, and did not speak to or warn the players involved either.\n\nThe referee’s inconsistency at the line-outs must have left the players wondering what to expect next. Premature support of the jumper either legal or illegal, and should be treated the same from start to finish. When two of the best sides in the country (at any particular level) meet, a top-class referee must be in charge. Sadly this was not the case in Stellenbosch on Saturday.”\n\nPaul Roos 1991 on TV – YouTube link below http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFd5w3EKCjs\n\n1992\n\nAfter the 20-3 defeat the prior year, Grey was ready to turn the tables in Bloemfontein and won 20-6. This was also the first full Interschools between the schools where all other sports and teams were participating for the first time.\n\n1993\n\nThe first ever Paul Roos tour to Stellenbosch took place in 1993, the team of 1993 suffered two losses prior to Paul Roos against Monument and Dale College respectively, Grey also suffered their biggest loss to date against Paul Roos 28-8 on this tour.\n\n1994\n\nThe 1994 season was one of Grey hardest years to date, Grey lost 7 games that year the most ever by any team, but one has to also take note that they played so much tuffer opponents as well as a grueling New Zealand tour against their best, Paul Roos also succeeded in beating Grey in a nail biter for 1st time in their history on Grey main field 31-29.\n\n1995\n\nAfter 3 dismal years for Grey rugby according to their own high standards, the 1995 Grey First Team turned around 3 years of mixed successes and became undefeated again. This was also the first time that Grey would beat Paul Roos in Stellenbosch since 1988. The final score was 21-10\n\n1998\n\nAfter losing to Paul Roos in Stellenbosch the prior year 12-8, this was a hard contested match in Bloemfontein. Rudolph Froneman scored Grey’s winning try and the final score was 23-15 to the home team. CJ van der Linde (Springbok) played for Grey that day.\n\n2002\n\nGrey had several future Springboks and provincial rugby players in their team including Ruan Pienaar, Bismark du Plessis (both Springboks), and Andries Strauss (Sharks). Schalk Ferreira played for SA Schools from Paul Roos.\n\n2003 – Grey won in Stellenbosch and produced 5 SA Schools players – Flip vd Merwe, Richardt Strauss, Adriaan Strauss, Steph Robberts, and Alwyn Hollenbach.\n\nJodie Rose was chosen for the SA Schools from Paul Roos. Jaundre Kruger, who later became Paul Roos’ 50th Springbok played that day when Grey won a nailbiter 18-17 at Markotter.\n\n2004 – In 2004 both Grey and Paul Roos missed some key players towards the end of the season during their Interschools match in Bloemfontein.\n\nGrey lost their SA Schools players and the back row included Heinrich Brussow (Springbok), Deon Stegmann (Springbok) en Richardt Strauss (Cheetahs & Ireland). Pieter Myburgh played SA Schools for Paul Roos that year. This was another closely contested game and Paul Roos’ first victory over Grey in Bloemfontein by 21-18.\n\n2006 – Leading into the final Grey derby of the season Paul Roos was the top rugby school in SA and had a magnificent season in 2006. It was a memorable game for Rector Jock de Jager attending his final Interschools as Paul Roos headmaster from 1993 – March 2007.\n\nPaul Roos had one of their best teams in years and was the top Rugby School in SA in 2006. Many experts compared this team with the likes of 1991 and 1999 PRG teams.\n\nFour backline players from the 2006 Paul Roos team were selected for the final trial for the SA u/20 team – scrumhalf Francois Hougaard, flyhalf Coenie van Wyk and centers Charl Weideman and Stephan Dippenaar. However, neither Hougaard nor Dippenaar made the Craven Week.\n\nIn another close encounter, Paul Roos beat Grey 16-11 which resulted in two consecutive Interschools victories for the first time for Paul Roos in Bloemfontein. Springbok Frans Steyn played for Grey in 2006.\n\nPaul Roos 2006 YouTube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a6EazHV970\n\n2007 – The class of 2007 produced a remarkable Grey First Team which beat Paul Roos with a record score of in Stellenbosch. The Ebersohn twins Robert (Springbok squad) and Sias (Cheetahs) plus Coenie Oosthuizen (Springbok) played for Grey that day.\n\nGrey College defeated Paul Roos with a record score of 40-14 at Markotter-stadium. The visiting team led Paul Roos 17-9 at the break.\n\nBoth locks of Grey College, Pieter Labuschagne and Joubert Horn, played well in Grey’s victory. Boom Prinsloo, Roelf Pienaar (both flanks) and Adriaan Theisinger (eightman) also had great performances on the day.\n\nGrey’s SA Schools centre, Robert Ebersohn, showed once again why he was so highly rated in school’s rugby. Under Ebersohn’s captaincy Grey won all 14 their matches this season.\n\nSpringbok Willie le Roux played fly-half for Paul Roos and kicked three penalties in the first half to keep his team in contention until the break.\n\nThis Grey Team had the highest average score for any Grey First Team over the last 40 years with an average of 55 points per game.\n\nOne month earlier the Free State Craven Week team with 15 Grey College boys also put 50 points on WP in the Final of the Craven Week at the same Markotter stadium beating WP in the unofficial Final 52-3.\n\n2008 – Building on the previous record score at Markotter, the 2008 Grey First Team beat Paul Roos with a record score in Bloemfontein by 47-15. Grey had two SA School players (Francois Venter and Franna du Toit) that year while scrumhalf Cobus Reinach – son of double Springbok Jaco Reinach (Grey 1980) and nephew of another legendary old Grey Herman Reinach (1988) later became the regular no.9 for the Sharks. Both Reinach and Venter became Springboks later in their careers.\n\n2009 – The 2009 Grey First Team equaled the most amount of SA Schools players produced by one school in the starting line-up, namely six – Pieter Rademan (captain), Riaan Britz, Piet Lindeque, Jean Cook, Carl Wegner and Stephanus Kotze.\n\nThe previous record was also held by Grey in 1981. JP du Plessis played SA Schools for Paul Roos in 2009. Paarl Boys High broke the record in 2016 when they produced 8 SA Schools players.\n\nBoth Grey and Paul Roos played without their SA Schools players during the last match of the season. Hero of the day was fly-half Lucas Roothman, who landed the three decisive penalties, while Grey full-back Niel Marais could only manage one. This ended a winning streak for Grey since 2007.\n\n2009 Jolla Bolla – YouTube link\n\n2010 – The 2010 Grey College First Team is regarded as one of the best Grey Teams in modern times. Grey produced six SA Schools players that year – William Small-Smith (captain), Anrich Bitzi, Kevin Luiters, Paul Jordaan, Johan Goosen, and Neethling Fouche. Grey beat all of South Africa’s top rugby schools including Paarl Gym, Paarl Boys’ High, Monnas, Affies, Grey High, Glenwood as away games which is a remarkable performance.\n\nPaul Roos also had a very successful season with three SA Schools players (Steven Kitshoff, JP Lewis and Tshotso Mbovane) so the table was set for a climax in Bloem. With tighthead prop Steven Kitshoff Paul Roos had a very strong scrum but was also penalized several times.\n\nJohan Goosen scored 36 points (including one try) on the day when Grey won a nail biter 41-29.\n\nJohan Goosen scoring 36 points against Paul Roos – See YouTube link below:\n\nSee YouTube link below:\n\nGrey vs Paul Roos 2010 – War Cry YouTube link below:\n\n2011 – In 2011 Grey played Paul Roos at the Danie Craven Stadium due to construction at the Markotter Field. Paul Roos was leading with only a few minutes left when Grey scored and won the match in the final minutes 36-35. JP Lewis was Paul Roos’ SA Schools Player while Grey had three SA Schools representatives – Jan Serfontein, Dries Swanepoel and Neethling Fouche.\n\nThis Saturday the form book will be thrown out of the window as the Stellenbosch outfit will try and salvage their season with a win against the old foe. The Paul Roos boys have a lot of pride and a win against Grey will just show what they are really capable of. Grey will not be a pushover as their late seasons results have shown. They are coming down to the wine lands and facing a team with its back against the wall and nowhere to go.\n\n2018\n\nGrey College 1st Xv beat the powerful unbeaten team of Paul Roos in what was a close encounter between South Africa’s two best teams 28-26. The derby ended in what was called #TheGreytWhitewash all Grey rugby teams beat Paul Roos. The loosehead prop Jan-Hendrik Wessels & lock George Cronje was the star players for Grey, along with Kade Wolhuter that dominated the game for Paul Roos.\n\nThe SA Schools players for Grey (3) & Paul Roos (4) didnt play as they were part of SA Schools team that beat England (u18) on the same day 42-21.\n\n2019\n\nGrey College is once again on track for yet another unbeaten season and only the last Inter-schools match against Paul Roos can trip them up. They have beaten all comers with relative ease this season and the 2019 team is already spoken of as one of the all-time best this rugby factory has produced over the years. With an average match score of 54-18 against all the top schools in South Africa one can relate to the Bloemfontein uptake that this is a special team indeed. They can basically score tries from any position on the field by any player and one cant easily find any weaknesses, the group has amazing depth and even without their 5 SA Schools players (2 in SA A side), they still manage to smash very good opposition at ease.\n\nThey are somewhat victims of their own success as well in that 5 of their players and their coach is involved in the SA Schools setup that is currently playing an international series against France, Wales, Argentina and England. Prop Jan-Hendrik Wessels, 8th man George Cronje (both earmarked as future Springboks), hooker Andre-Hugo Venter (son of Springbok Andre Venter), lock Sisonke Vumazonke, fullback Sonwabo Sokoyi and coach Wessel du Plessis will all be missing out on the Stellenbosch trip and Grey will need to tap into their huge player pool to come up with replacements. This should however not hamper the Bloemfontein outfit to much as most of the replacements will have some 1st team games under their belt as Grey College uses a squad system that rotates players throughout the season.\n\nGrey College managed to pull the game away from Paul Roos Gymnasium at Markotter with field conditions that didn’t favour Grey College fast paced game. We witness some incredible events, one where Tielman Nieuwoudt the loosehead prop sprinted from half way line to tackle the flying Paul Roos winger and from that impact the ball dropped forward on try-line which the full back Franco Knoetze then counter attacked scoring a try from his try line without a single Paul Roos player touching him. The 2019 team is said to be the best 1st XV rugby team in Grey College history and majority of public reckon perhaps the best school rugby team ever witnessed in the world.\n\nBelow one can see what this Grey team did to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc ranked teams in South Africa.\n\nDate Opp For Against 2019/03/02 Duineveld 60 21 2019/03/09 Welkom Gim 29 0 2019/03/16 Menlopark 59 28 2019/03/19 Garsfontein 53 30 2019/03/27 Christchurch Boys High 73 26 2019/03/30 Southlands BHS (NZ) 54 0 2019/04/06 HTS Middelburg 81 8 2019/04/13 Selborne 17 8 2019/05/02 Outeniqua 64 7 2019/05/04 Paarl Gim 47 33 2019/05/11 HJS Paarl 43 24 2019/05/18 Affies 50 28 2019/07/13 Waterkloof 63 27 2019/07/20 Grey PE 58 0 2019/07/27 Glenwood 50 27 2019/08/03 Oakdale 57 26\n\nSPRINGBOKS\n\nSpringboks & SA Schools players Rugby at Paul Roos The words Paul Roos and rugby are synonymous as the great man was the originator of the now famous Springbok emblem and name for the South African national team. He is seen by many as the “father” of South African rugby and it is fitting that the school that carries his name is such a powerhouse in South African schools rugby.\n\nThe following schooled at Paul Roos but did not matriculate at Paul Roos:\n\nGrey College Recent Springbok Accomplishments\n\nThere were five Old Grey College’s in the 1999 World Cup squad, Ollie le Roux, Naka Drotské, Ruben Kruger, Werner “Smiley” Swanepoel and Pieter Müller. In the 2007 winning World Cup team there were again five Old Grey College’s, CJ van der Linde, Jannie and Bismarck du Plessis, Ruan Pienaar and Francois Steyn.\n\nIn 2010 season Grey had eight representatives in the Springbok squad, Deon Stegmann, Adriaan Strauss, CJ van Niekerk, Jannie Du Plessis, Bismarck Du Plessis, Flip vd Merwe, Ruan Pienaar en Franscois Steyn. Grey College had six representatives in the 2011 Rugby World Cup Springbok team in New Zealand – Jannie du Plessis, Bismarck du Plessis, Frans Steyn, Ruan Pienaar, Heinrich Brussow, and CJ van der Linde."
