These descriptions of events were the first steps in historiography in the scientific sense. They introduced the observational phase of\n\n2\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nhistory-writing, but selection of material was undisciplined and arbitrary. An advance on this was made by those who, like Aristotle in his Poetics, held that history was about specific people, places, constitutions and set out to classify these and similar unordered and usually unrelated data. But even classified events do not yet constitute history proper, especially if the time axis, so to speak, is absent. In the 14th century B.C., the Philosopher Pharaoh, Akhenaton (Amenhotep IV) wrote an Aton (Sun) based monotheistic and naturalistic theory of truth and pnmordial \"Law of Oppoisites\". Around 280 B.C. the great Egyptian historian Manetho recorded 31 dynasties in his Anegyptiaca, and laid the foundation of \"long time\" historiography by gouping them into seven sequences used by the Taoist historian, Tssuma Chien (145-179 BC), who wrote Shi Chi (Records of History), used “long time” as a measure of historic change 2000 years before Braudel and Wallerstein. He documented 1000 years of what later became known as “primitive communism” from the Shang to the Han “dynasties”. The concept of time-relation sets of events was developed further by the Shih T'ung of Liu Chih-chi (661-721), by Ssuma Kuang (1019-86), and the Ming historian, Wang Fu-Chih (1619-1692), who possibly influenced the Jesuit missionary and scientist, Matthew Ricci, and thence Leibnitz, and developed a materialist method based on dynamic equilibnhum. Wang Fee-Chih saw that forms, called Hsing, remained unchanged for long periods, while their content, Chih, continually changed. We may use the Hsing concept if we consider the Marxist evolution from slavery-to-feudalism-to-capitalism in much of Europe or from “savagery” to “barbarism” to “civilization”, in any part of the world, if we use Morgan’s Hsing forms. These changes were brought about by a generative force, Yin Yun, in both nature and society. We may consider Marx's “class struggle’, taken as “the motor of history’, as such a Yin Yun. This Yin Yun or the Yin-Yang dialectic, was a philosophical methodology for bringing time-order into the chaos of events. It introduced a scientific inductive methodology into historiography, if we take Yin Yun to be a generalisation of significant, event-making forces in social science. One form of Yin-Yang would be the conquest-resistance dialectic in South African history. The Tarikh-Il-Jehano-Gusha of Persia's great historian, Joveyni (1226-1283), enriched the methods of West Asian and North African historians with his thorough and careful selectiveness in the face of “facts” and “events”. So, too, did El Idrisi (13th century) and El Masudi (10th century), whose descriptions of East Africa are helpful to South African historiography; Ibn Battuta (1304 - 1369), whose Rihlah (Travels) covered 120,000 kilometres including long coastal areas of West and Eeast Africa, Leo Africanus (16th century) and, above all, Ibn Khaldun (b. Tunis, 1332, died\n\nCairo, 1406). Khaldun’s Mugaddimah (Introduction to his History of North Africa, Kitab al’ Ibar) was, wrote the British liberal historian, Toynbee, in 1934: “the greatest work of its kind that has ever yet been created by any mind.\" The greatest heritage\n\nThe Conceptual Framework\n\n3\n\nleft to modern historians is his “science of culture”, of socio-economic analysis. This\n\nscience, I] Al Umran, focussed on “social transformations that succeed each other in the nature of society’. He contrasted the cohesion of people under a social bond which he called Asabiyah (600 years before Durkheim's celebrated “organic society’) with class struggles between commoners, despots and usurpers.' The African historian, Khaldun, was probably the first to give historiography a method which, coupled with the Yin-Yang dialectics of the Chinese materialist historians, could be considered to make histonography scientific. This combination was regenerated in the methodology of Marx's “dialectical materialism” and its sub-set, in the field of human history, known as “historical materialism.” In terms of the results of the above evolution of history-writing, history is not a chaos of events strewn about world, space and time. We agree with Kant when he said that history's events have both order and coherence.’ For Voltaire, in Essai sur Les Moeurs et L'Esprit des Nations (1745-53), this order came from God. Max Weber also used religion as a driving force in his Die Protestantische Ethik und Der Geist Der Kapitalismus (1904-5; in English, 1930), which tried to show that Calvinism led the triumph of capitalism and was more racialistic in the colonies than Catholicism. This factually false idea has also entered deeply into South African liberal and neo-liberal historiography which sees in Calvinistic Afrikanerdom the diabolo of apartheid. Calvinist, Anglican and Catholic missionaries alien to Voltaire’s deism nevertheless went to convert the African peoples with the idea that history was, indeed, the work and word of God. But they, as the spiritual part of the worldly army of European conquistadores, also propagated the historiographic theories of Gibbons, renewed in the 20th century by Toynbee and Braudel, theories which centred on the diffusion of something called “civilization.\"* For South Africa this meant simply that everything that has happened since da Gama in 1497 or Van Riebeeck in 1652 has been the result of the spread of this “civilization” by the Europeans. Indeed, a strong current of the concept of “race” and of racism in his handling of the\n\nEuropean slave-trade, runs through Braudel’s Civilization and Capitalism (1979). Voltairean and Braudelian theories combined to form what has become known as the “civilizing mission” of Europe and the Europeans in all the world, and thence, too, in\n\nSouth Africa. This explanation for history was integrated with the theory that this “civilization” spread through the dynamism and superiority of one sub-species or race of humani-\n\nty, known as the “Whites” or “Europeans’. This theory was the work of Positivists like Herbert Spencer and historians like de Gobineau and Carlyle® in the 19th century during the final European conquest of the world. The British historian, Toynbee (1889-1975), in his A Study of History, listed no fewer than 21 “civilizations” of which\n\n4\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\n“two have been created by contributions from three different races, nine by contnbutions from two different races, and ten by the united endeavours of a single race in each case”®adding: “When we classify Mankind by colour, the only primary race that has not made a creative contribution to any civilization is the Black race”,’ due to “certain features in the Negro's circumstances”? Toynbee, like the German-American anthropologist-historian, Franz Boas (1858 - 1952) believed in “equal but different races” and that there were race-related “civilizations” or “cultures”. To obtain a valid historiography we attempt to find the Hsing forms in South Africa and the Asabiyah preserving and the Yin Yun revolutionising these forms. We come to the conclusion that the real framework of South African history is constituted by the becoming and being of modes of production and distribution and by the ratification of their social formations. This reality, in tum, translates into becoming also the conceptual framework of scientific South Afncan historiography. The inclusion of “race” in the above modal and class analytic approach reflects the unique expression, in the South African case, of the general world processes of the colonial — capitalist sys-\n\ntem. When we refer to a world economy or world system we do not do so in the sense used by Braudel, following, as he says,” the work of John Heinrich Von Thunen (1780 - 1851) who ranks alongside Marx as the greatest German economist of the 19th century’.\"° Von Thunen’s Der Isolierte Staat (1826) pictures a city (the Braudelian “centre”) in a fertile plain, with concentric zones of farming ranging from expensive ones near the centre to cheap ones towards a surrounding wildemess (the “periphery’), with diminishing returns from the land as transport costs increased with distance from the city “centre” bounded by a wildemess (the “periphery”). This model, not being based on a nation, by nation exploitation, is invalid for the world-capitalist system. It has reference to “centre-periphery’ trading “world economies” which may or may not be exploitative; and not to unequal inter-national relations of production. Its components are “civilizations” (which, for Braudel, include “European civilization” \"Jewish civilization”, Moslem or Arab civilization, including Arab-Africa, which Braudel regards as “White”, as distinct from sub-Saharan “Black” Africa). These civilizations are more or less timeless.\n\nEach world-economy “invanably has a centre, with a city\n\nand an already-dominant type of capitalism’.\"\" The Braudel view is that capitalism has always been part of “civilizations” and that it is only a third layer superstructure above a timeless primary layer of “structures of everyday life’, and a secondary layer, the timeless market economy. We see the Thunen-Braudel model! as unhistorical and inapplicable, in particular, to the world-capitalist system. Whereas, for example, the Braudel school, as continued by Wallerstein,’? would see the Homelands and Bantustans as peripheral “household economies” continuing an age-old primary layer and secondary layer (market-economy) structures, “capital-\n\nFig. 4: Cecil John Rhodes (1853-1902), British imperialist, honoured by Oxford University with the annual Rhodes scholarship.\n\nFig.3: Lobengula (1833-1894), Ndebele King and resister.\n\nThe Conceptual Framework\n\n5\n\nism’ as a third layer (of multi-nationals and state-powers) above the homelands/ Bantustans, we cannot but see the latter as an integral part of the colonial base of capitalism, as a part of capitalism proper. Instead of these timeless categories and structural models of “civilization” and “world economies’, we rely on the concepts of modes of production or social formations and their total systemics. |. Theory of Modes of Production for South African Historiography We use the concept of mode of production and distribution in the most general sense in which it was used by Marx, that is in the sense of a system, a social formation, together with its economy.’* We do not use “mode of production” in the narrow sense of a specific method of production, such as hunting, herding or metal-working. Nor do we use “mode” in the intermediate sense of a form of labour, such as slavery, serfdom, or wage-labour. We do not use “mode” to connote solely the economic forces and relations of production, the “economic base” of a system. We use it to\n\nconnote the system itself, in its totality, comprising its economy, its society, its politics and its culture. Following Marx's Critique and Grundrisse, we take the main modes or systems to have been those holding pre-class societies, slavery, feudalism, state-communalism and capitalism.'* This does not imply that all of these existed in South Africa or that they form a necessary sequence. Slavery, feudalism and state-communalism never properly existed in South Africa as modes or systems. Yet there were slaves, serfs and despots in South Afncan history. But, as we hope to be able to show, these functioned within a colonial-capitalist mode or system. They did not, as we see them, exist in pre-capitalist social formations. There were, for example, no pre-colonial despots, not even in the cases of Tshaka, Lobengula and Moshoeshoe, for the sim-\n\nple reason that in South Africa a system akin to what Marx called “Oriental state-communalism’” or the “Asiatic mode of production” did not have time to mature. Its development was, indeed, truncated by wars of dispossession and conquest waged for over 200 years in South Africa by a world-scouring capitalist systemic. Likewise, the Boers, British and German settlers of the 19th century had serfs, but not within a feudal systemic. Similarly, from 1658 to 1834 there were slaves at the Cape, but there\n\nwas, as we shall try to show, no slavery mode or system. Instead slavery was a labour form within a capitalist mode and systemic operating in the Western Cape and, after “abolition” in 1834, in parts of the Boer Republics. What we mean by “mode” or “system”, then, is not any specific technological method of production, nor\n\nany particular form of labour. By “mode” or “system” we mean an overall economicsocial-political-cultural entity.\n\n6\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nll. The Three Modes of South African History In the case of South African history, no more than three such entities have existed. The first such mode or system was that of the ancient food-gatherers and hunters, called or calling themselves the San, Xam or !Ke. Over a century ago, Morgan and Engels eurocentrically called this mode “savagery” and Marx, “primitive communism’. The second mode was that of the so-called Khoi-Khoi and Bantu herders or agriculturalists or farmers, which Morgan and Engels called “barbarism’.'® Both these modes may be collectively called “communalism’, with the qualification that many of the pre-conquest hunters and farmers were not organised into who the Europeans were later to call \"tribes\". The third mode (or second, if the previous two are regarded as one set) was and remains the most savage and barbarous of all: that of capitalism. Ill. The Nether and Upper Sides of Capitalist Mode The capitalist mode has an upper and a nether side. It is divided, and divides the world, in two ways. Firstly, it divides the peoples into rich and poor nations. Lenin called these rich, oppressor nations and poor oppressed nations.\"® We prefer this characterisation.\n\nFrank, Wallerstein, Amin and, with qualifications, this author, at\n\ntimes, calls them “centre” and “periphery”. Popularly, these are referred to as the West and South respectively. Our history needs to ask and to try to answer the question: “On which side of this divide does South Africa lie? In the West, the “cen-\n\ntre”, the “rich oppressor”, area? Or in the South, the “periphery”, the “poor oppressed” side? However, it is theoretically possible that no clear answer can be given to this question and that South Africa may, indeed, contain both sides. In such an event, our South African history would, conceptually at any rate, be of world significance. This problematic is an inevitable and necessary task of our methodology. The single general concept embracing this division of the global economy and system is: “colonialism\". This is meant to cover the entire process of capital accumulation. For some this process starts with the Crusades.’ For others, it begins in 1492.\" It is, however, widely agreed, following Hobson and Lenin’, that the phase of colonialism which opened up together with the Suez Canal, the Kimberley diamond mines and the Johannesburg gold mines during the final conquests of Africa and\n\nAsia by the European powers in the last part of the 19th century, be denoted by the concept and term: \"imperialism\".\n\nIn the case of South Africa, historians have to\n\nenquire: \"Was South Africa, as a political economy, like the U.S.A., Canada, Australia\n\nand New Zealand, converted, perhaps after the Boer War, perhaps only after the 1910 Act of “White” Union, from a colony into an imperialism? Or, if not, did it\n\nThe Conceptual Framework\n\nUi\n\nbecome a hybrid combining the colonial Yin and the imperialist Yang of capitalism in one national territory? IV. The Hierarchy of Intra-Modal Divisions in South Africa The concept of modes or systems is our primary concept. The concept of intramodal division requires a distinction between national, “racial”, “communal” and class groups and categories. These we hierarchise in the order given, considering first the nature of the South African “national state” entity within the panoply of capitalist nations; second, the partition of the South African population into “races” and “tribes”: third (but only third), the “class-structure” within and between the “races” and between the South African sub-set and the world set into which it is nested. Only if taken in this hierarchic context does “class analysis” of the South African story function in the way in which both the great African historian, Ibn Khaldun, and the internationalist, Karl Marx, intended: namely both as an accurate description and as a\n\nmeans of social reform or revolution. To place class analysis above the racial division of the populace would, for example, include economistic categories which, inter alia, would place the racist, privileged, \"White” citizen — worker in the same class as the rightless, oppressed non-citizen “Black\" worker. This would be neither real nor realistic. One such aberration we shall need to examine is that of “White socialism” in the first quarter of the 20th century. At the same time, the historian needs, in steer-\n\ning clear of this kind of economism — which is not without its own willy-nilly racism — to avoid the pitfalls of non-class “Africanist” concepts — which, in turn, are bom in the European or eurocentric Yang, but bred in the Yin locations of the system. Our effort is to achieve an internationalist and non-racial class analysis within a surrounding modal “systemology’. V. Colonial Conquest: A Class or a Modal Struggle? Marx's dictum, in the “Communist Manifesto’, to the effect that the history of “civi-\n\nlized” society is a history of “class struggles” and that these class struggles are the motor of historical change, makes sense and holds true only when placed in the context of modal/systemic evolution and revolution.\n\nFor example, can the wars of dis-\n\npossession, which make up a large part of our history, be regarded as “class struggles” pure and simple? Or were these not modal struggles, conflicts between the opposite modes of production of San, Khoi-Khoi and Bantu communalism and European capitalism, locked in an antagonistic contradiction with each other for over two centuries? Was this modal struggle, between opposite and antagonistic systems, part of a world-wide struggle waged throughout Africa, the Americas and Asia\n\n8\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nsince at least the Voyages of Diaz, Columbus, Cabral and da Gama? And was this struggle inter-modal rather than inter-class in character? Was this modal conflict the main process of capitalist primary accumulation? Was this global, inter-continental conflict between European modes and American, African and Asian modes, more fundamental for the birth and breeding of the capitalist system — and of Europe itself — than the intra-national class-struggles between feudals and bourgeoisie inside Europe? It is against the background of this question that we look at the wars of dispossession, conquest, the cheap labour policy, the racial laws and “customs”, and re-communalisation, as the new, capitalist mode overcame and dilated the modes of the\n\nhunters and herders — and of the birth-lands of the slaves imported into the Cape. Conceptually, it is possible to reconcile the modal conflictuality with a class struggle, provided the latter is conceived of as not being between classes in a national entity, but between different class-systems situated in different geographic areas. In some cases, as in the conquests of Mexico, Peru, Egypt, Ethiopia, and India, inter alia, there were struggles between opposite and antagonistic class systems. At each pole of the conflict there were class systems: at one pole, ultimately victorious, there were bourgeois, feudal and toiling classes; at the other pole, ultimately defeated, there were communal state-classes, as Marx called them” and commoners.\n\nHowever, in\n\nthe case of the conflict between rising European capitalism and pre-class, non-class, communal or pre-communal societies, as was the case from Van Riebeeck (perhaps from da Gama) to Rhodes, class systems did not exist at both poles of the historical dialectic. In the case of South Africa — and most of Africa and America, many parts of Asia and all of Australasia — a class system existed on one side only — the European side. If the antagonism between a class system and a non-class system is taken as an inter-system class struggle, the class struggle concept is reconcilable with the over-riding modal struggle concept. In the case of struggles between different class-systems (e.g., capitalism and Asian, Arab, African, Aztec, state-communalism; or in much earlier times, German barbarism and Roman slavery), there is no need for this conceptual modification. But, in the case of South African history, if it be true that capitalist conquest cut short evolution from communalism to state-communalism, this modification is needed if the concept of class struggle is to be held to apply to the periods, areas and protagonists of the Wars of Dispossession in our history.\n\nVI. Antagonistic Relations of Production in the Modal Struggle A basic contradiction ran through the inter-modal struggle between the European, feudal-capitalist class system, on the one side, and the pre-communal hunting and\n\nThe Conceptual Framework\n\n9\n\nfood-gathering San and the communal herding Khoi-Khoi and herding and agricultural Bantu, on the other side. This contradiction lay in the different and, indeed, mutu-\n\nally antagonistic, relations of production of the contending modes or systems. Historians have stressed, not without facts and reason, the difference between the forces of production at the disposal of the Europeans — thanks largely to those borrowed from the Chinese, Indians, Arabs and Egyptians — and the relatively inferior forces of production, certainly for warfare, of the San, Khoi-Khoi and Bantu peoples defending their lands and animals and resisting conquest. But insufficient attention has been, or is, paid to the qualitative difference in the relations of production between the European class-structured mode and the pre-class or non-class African modes from the Cape to the Limpopo. This difference is between the 2000-year old privatisations of land and labour in Europe, and the age-old relative absence of private property in land and labour not only in South Africa, but in most of Africa. The property of land and buildings in the ancient Greek and Roman cities and countryside was privatised. The main form of labour in the classical cities and rural surrounds of Athens, Sparta, Corinth and Rome was privatised labour: either slave or free. In the classical state-communalism societies of Babylonia, Egypt, India, China,\n\nMexico and Peru, inter alia, private property in land and labour was the exception. The rule was communal property in land and communal labour. In Mediterranean Europe and especially in the areas occupied by the Celtic, Frankish and Slavic there were at first, as elsewhere in the world, many forms of communal property in land and in labour. However, slavery reduced the area and influence of this communalism in Mediterranean Europe and feudalism adapted, eroded and in many areas destroyed and privatised the old communal mark, mir, obschina etc., in Central and\n\nEastem Europe. On the long eve of the capitalist revolution private property in land and labour had become dominant in much of Europe. Capitalism completed this process in Europe and violently extended it to the rest of the world, including South Africa during its wars of dispossession and the rest of the process of primary accumulation. This process of colonialistic privatisation underlies the destruction of the communal modes of the San, Khoi-Khoi and Bantu. Vil. The Backwardness of Pre-Colonial Europe At the time the conquests began Europe was technologically and culturally backward compared with what we have called the communal modes or systems in Asia, North Africa, and parts of the highlands of America. Europe was also poorer in raw materials for use in industry — but not in the iron and coal needed to make industrial machines. This backwardness and poverty stimulated the capitalists to push aside or to\n\n10\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nabsorb the feudals in a process of expansion abroad. But the element which enabled this expansion more than any other element was the pre-existence of private property in land and labour in the feudal mode from which they were trying to escape. This factor gave backward Europe the mobility and elasticity, as Amin has called it *, which gave it a decisive advantage over the superior communal non-European mode, and, certainly, over the technologically and scientifically inferior communal mode of pre-communal and communal societies in most of Africa, including South Africa. The individualism and freedom of action within classes having private means of production and privatised labour and capital resources at their disposal was a historical, that is, a mode-producing, advantage compared with the bottom — heavy communal land and labour, and the top-heavy state-class bureaucracies of communal societies; and, more so, over societies immobilised by the inertia of pre-commu-\n\nnal and communal social relations of production and administration. In particular, the expanding, world-seeking proto-capitalists of Europe did not have to break through the communal monopoly of foreign trade and travel as was the case with Indian, Chinese, Mexican and North African and Arabian commercialists.\n\nNor\n\nwere they tied to the past and the present by the communalistic prohibitions on inher-\n\nitance. Their private property in personal and capital goods could be passed on to their children and their class thus had a future. As Fernand Braudel has shown, this was almost impossible in communal cultures, such as that of the Ottomans, or in dynastic China.” Finally, whereas both communal and \"communal’ communal societies were redistributive, the class-based modes in Europe — whether slavery, feudal or capitalist — privatised that part of the surplus not immediately needed by the state and this priva-\n\ntised part was the bulk tributed by or through states. The privatised of state-communalism,\n\nof the surplus. In the communal modes the surplus was redistheir custodians — chiefs, patriarchs, matriarchs, elders, or part — pocketed by families within the state class in the case or by chiefs or usurpers — was usually a minor part of the\n\ntotal surplus. The major part was re-distributed either diurnally, or seasonally, or stored for distribution in bad times. The European capitalist did not have to hand over his surplus directly or indirectly to the community around him/her, but could dispose of it more or less at will. Thus private property in means of production gave the Europeans — or rather, at the stage between Marco Polo and Columbus, protoEuropeans, for Europe was bom only later — the elasticity and mobility which the\n\nnon-Europeans, by comparison, lacked. The above features and implications of private property in the means and labourforce of production gave “peripheral” and “backward” Europe the advantage over the\n\nmore\" advanced” and also more “backward” nations and peoples outside Europe, (in that sense “Non -Europeans”). The history of South Africa after the landings of Diaz\n\nThe Conceptual Framework\n\n11\n\nin 1488 and the settlement of Van Riebeeck in 1652 is largely a consequence and part of this difference in property relations of production and distribution between what may, with due caution, be termed the “European” and “African” modes or systems.” Vill. The Coionialistic Nature of Capitalism in South Africa The capitalist world system was properly bom and also bred by a process of colonialism. Since then capitalism has remained by nature colonialistic. Since colonialism partitions the word economy and its entire systemic into dominant and subject peoples, this system became intrinsically racialistic. “Race” accompanied both class and nation in the structures and modus operandi of capitalism. Capitalism without colonialism and racialism never did and does not and cannot exist. The colonial process not only enabled the birth of capitalism, but was also the cradle of the division of the world which placed Europe, in the first instance, and later her spawns, the United States and the “White Dominions”, including “White South Africa’, into the “centre” or rather apex of the world system. Colonialism thereby created Europe itself, with its myth of a “European civilization” and, thence, the famous “civilizing mission”. Before capitalist colonialism there was no Europe in the political or cultural sense. Nor were there any Europeans. The very term arose only in the 16th century, after da Gama and Columbus and the other “discoverers”.* All the major racial concepts and terms were created by capitalist colonialism.”\n\nThe very divisibility and the resulting partition of humanity into sub-species or races was unthinkable and at most exceptional before capitalism. The main ideology of capitalist-colonialism on a world scale was and remains racialism or racism open or hidden, patent or latent, colonial or neo-colonial. Racial terms and concepts, such as\n\n“race” (c.1500) “Negro” (c.1550), “native” (1450), “African” (c. 1564), “European (c.1603), “ghetto” (1611), “Coolie” (1598), \"Negroid” (c.1859), “Negrophobe (c. 1833), “Negrophile” (c. 1842), had never existed before capitalist colonialism. The race-theory spread from all European colonialist classes, including settlers, slavers and conquistadores, into every branch of the social and even the natural sciences. The very term “race” came out of what the South African revolutionary scholar, B.M. Kies, called the ‘first plundering expedition of capitalism',”” namely the Crusades of the 11th to 13th centuries against the Arabs and North Africans. The divisibility and partition of human-kind into races is the first paradigm of racism and its praxis, racialism. This paradigm is still almost universally accepted by scholars, in the West, South and East. Probably | was the first to question and reject this first theorem of race theory and to define racism in terms of its first principle: the divisibility and division of humanity into races.” Only recently has biological science\n\n12\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\ncome to the same conclusion.\n\nThus, the US biologist, S.J. Gould, accepted, on bio-\n\nlogical grounds, what our use of historical materialism had uncovered from the actual colonialistic pre-history and history of capitalism.” The concept of the superiority of one or some races and the inferiority of others is merely the corollary of the above first principle. It is today discarded even by the governments and academia of apartheid in South Africa. They, however, while no longer insisting on the idea of superiority and inferiority, still insist on divisibility and do so in the concept: “the races are equal but different”. This principle has obvious political consequences which are due to play their part in the re-shaping of the face, if not the re-structuring, of the body-politic of South Africa. This re-shaping concerns the policy of reconciling “one person — one-vote” with some form of racial partition; in short, to reconcile “equal” with “different”. All this is a denouement of at least five centuries of racial praxis and thinking induced by colonialism into the capitalist system. This infusion, for a number of correlated geo-economic reasons, became most intense in real South African history. IX. The Racial Nature of Capitalist-Colonialism in South Africa\n\nThe modal or systemic dialectic which related South Africa to both Europe and the America — Africa — Asia complex rapidly resolved itself in a peculiar racial manner. Whereas in the rest of the the world of colour (and Czarist Russia) the Europeans both oppressed the conquered peoples racially and repressed their national aspirations, in short, imposed a racial-cum-national oppression. In South Africa they prevented the formation of nationalism and racially repressed the dispossessed peoples. In South Africa the colonialist polarisation was not between an oppressor, rich, nation (or group of nations) and an oppressed nation, as in the cases of India, Mexico, the Sudanese kingdoms, Ethiopia et al. Rather, the polarisation was between Europeans of all nations as a “race” and people of colour of all communist or communal communal social formations as another, different and inferior “race”. The colonialist polarisation took on not a national but a racial form. This occurred also for a long period in those parts of Africa, America and Asia where the prevailing modal systemic was of a pre -class or communal nature, rather than of the “Oriental state-\n\ncommunalism’” type. During this period South Africa was not unique. But the rise of\n\nnational independence in America in the 19th century and, in the 20th, in Africa and Asia, eventually made the South African polarisation unique. X. The Dialectics of Colonial Racism\n\nCapitalist colonialism and racialism became inseparable.\n\nThis proposition holds\n\nThe Conceptual Framework\n\n13\n\ntrue both for the dominating countries of the “West” and for the dominated countries of the “South” — and, as events in Eastem Europe showed in 1989 - 1990, also for the only semi-delinked countries of the “East”. This inseparability is strongest in South Africa where it has resisted and continues to resist all efforts to disentangle the capitalist systemic from its racial content. This intractability, which repeatedly manifests itself also in the world’s leading non-racial “democracy”, the USA, decades after the “Desegregation” of the 1950's and 1960's is the real subject matter of the ongoing “reforms” and negotiations in South Africa. It derives from the specific institutionalised racial way in which colonialism took root and spread in the South African case. Colonialism formed several kinds of colour bar (the Australian immigration type, also found in California and now in EEC countries; the South African type; the desegregation de facto form — which, in terms of common law, is also de jure, according to American anti-segregationist organizations like the NAACP). But the systematic, general, statutory, official colour bar was bred in only certain types of colony. The discovery of these types and of their origins is the key to understanding why South Africa became a colour-bar dominated colony, compared with, say, India or Egypt or Mexico or Nigeria. In 1960 we tried to treat this problematic in the following terms:* The usual explanation is that this colour bar accompanied large-scale European settlement. But this fails to explain the settlement itself. The latter is usually explained as being due to the attraction of a pleasant climate and habitat. But, apart from being an over-generalisation, this is itself an implicitly racist explanation, since it assumes there are different races, with different abilities to withstand heat and\n\nhumidity. The hypotheses that eumelanin pigment inhibits Vitamin D under weak sunlight and that hence dark-skinned children would suffer from rickets in Northern Europe; and that eumelanin-free pale-skinned people would suffer from skin-cancer under the sunlight of equatorial regions may partially explain global skin-colour distribution before capitalism. But skin-colour distribution is not climate-related under capitalist colonialism, being both light and dark in cold, hot, dry or humid climates.\n\nDarwin observed that there was no necessary link between climate and colour. The “natural” explanation for European settlement fails also to explain why the Europeans did not settle in the congenial climes and habitats of North Africa (apart from Algeria after its conquest in 1830), China, and Japan; and why, on the other hand, there was heavy European settlement in the hot, humid equatorial regions of coastal \"Latin America’ (itself a racist term) as well as in cold regions of North America. Evidently, a social rather than a natural explanation is called for.\n\nNow, in general, change is the emergence of novelty out of the conflict of opposites which are themselves changed by their conflict. Thus capitalism became capitalism in the conflict between proto-capitalism from Europe and communalism and state-communalism outside Europe. Capitalism was largely the product of the colo-\n\n14\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nnial system it established. Thereby, a small cause of change was itself changed into a world system by the changes it caused. On the other hand, the communal and communal societies which capitalism changed into colonies stamped their own previous history on the colonies which resulted from their subjugation. Like all phenomena, colonies were the resultants of the intersections of the histories of all the forces bringing them about and metamorphosed by them.” Thus, the type of colony emerging from conquest and subjection had not only the general features of a capitalist colony (source of cheap labour and raw materials, markets for commodities and capital etc.). It had also specific features which came largely from the type of society which existed in each particular colony before it was colonised. The depth and scope of the colonial transformation of a particular area and its social formation was proportional to the degree of development of capitalist colonialism. But it was also inversely proportional to the degree of development of the precolonial civilization of the colonised country. There was, accordingly, a wide scale of transformations, ranging from a minimum in China (“despotic” according to Wittvogel and Trotsky; but according to J. Needham: bureaucratic-feudal) and to a maximum in lowly communal Australia. In China state-communal practices and structures ham-\n\npered colonialism. In Australia, the military and social weakness of communalism enabled the conquistadores to go so far that the colonial people were decimated and the colony was changed into an extension of the “mother country’, Britain. The same thing happened to Canada and the United States. The idea of change through the collision of history-bearing opposites reveals three broad types of colonised regions. Firstly, those where colonialism clashed with “state-communal” (American, Asian, African) modes or systems or “civilizations” at various levels (e.g., most of Asia, North Africa, Sudanese West Africa, Mexico, Peru)\n\nThe colonially corrupted or subjected state-communal upper class(es), like the Maharajah and Mogul rulers, became the social base in situ for the rule of the colonial powers. Without disturbing this convenient situation it was neither necessary nor possible for colonialism to introduce large numbers of European settlers into such ex“state-communal” colonies. European settlement filled a social and political vacuum where this existed and was a consequence of this, rather than of “climate”. In the ex-\n\nstate-communal type of colony, not only European settlement, but also capitalist slavery, was an impossibility on a general scale. For the state-communal societies which were colonised had long before either advanced beyond slavery as a practice or had never been preceded by slavery as a mode, or else had a non-privatised, statised or communalised form of slavery (e.g., captives who became slaves of the communalState) and the introduction of privatised slavery would have met (and, where attempted, did meet) general social resistance.\n\nThe Conceptual Framework\n\n15\n\nThus, in this type of colony, two of the conditions for a general colour-racialismEuropean settlement and chattel slavery — did not exist on a sufficient scale (e.g., China, whose combination of husbandry and home industry even prevented the penetration of Lancashire textiles and of imperialism into the interior, let alone its introduction of a general structural racialism; India, whose caste system division of labour facilitated the passage of British manufactures but resisted the institution of nondomestic slavery; Java, Western Sudan, North Africa, Aztec and Inca America and\n\nEthiopia — all these had state-communal elements which inhibited the total enslavement as such of the population and the unrestrained entry of European settlers). To the extent that they overcame the state-communal impedance, as in South America, the colonisers introduced slavery and colour discrimination practices, such as the “White mantua”, property and literacy obstacles to the franchise for the “indigens” and residential and job colour bars which exist to this day. Indeed, there the semi-colonial rulers are mainly ex-European racist settlers. A second type of colony was that which had a pre-conquest civilization of foodgathering, fishing, hunting. In such areas (northem part of America, Australia, Brazil, the indigens were decimated by war, land-robbery and the destruction of their means of subsistence (e.g., the buffalo of the Americans) and the survivors herded into reservations. The result was that the colonisers deprived themselves of all largescale internal sources of cheap labour. Although they thereby gained vast landareas, they had no labour to work these lands, unless such labour was imported. The unsuitability of slave-labour to the type of farming in Australia and Canada, for example, plus the fact that the genocide was completed after the abolition of the British slave traffic (1808) and slavery (1834), plus earlier colour-discrimination laws, combined to rule out the substitution of imported colonial-type labour. In consequence, a type of capitalism developed in such countries which produced, not a colony, but its opposite: an imperialistic settlement — in effect a distant “county” of the “home country’. In the Southem States of what became the United States, and in Brazil, the physi-\n\ncal annihilation of the indigens took place in a region where plantation slavery was possible. This genocide had, further, gone far enough before the system of slave labour became uneconomic or was destabilised by slave revolts. The colonialists imported slaves en masse from Africa and later bred them in their colonies. Settlers followed and ideal conditions came together for the emergence of a racialistically structured society.\n\nBoth the USA and Brazil, to this day, remain de-facto racially\n\nstructured. The fact that one, the USA, became an imperialism, while the other, Brazil, did not succeed to make the leap from “South” to “West”, is largely due to the\n\nfact that the USA industrialised its plantation crops in New England and traded its manufactures in its own right (as Frank has shown, New England was the fourth ver-\n\n16\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\ntex of a slave-cotton-rum-manufacturing (Africa-Caribbean-New England-Europe) quadrilateral; whereas Brazil's settlers exported their plantation products and imported mainly African slaves. This combination of settlers and slaves took place in and determined the third type of colony. But this had, in addition, a pre-colonial civilization which Morgan had called “barbarism” (herding and cultivation on communally held land). South Africa, with its highly developed Khoi-Khoi and Bantu communal civilizations (which Braudel calls no more than “cultures”** — as he did for the advanced pre-colonial American civilizations) became such a colony. On the one hand, these peoples could not, because of their greater resilience and social and economic versatility (compared with hunters and food-gatherers like the San) be decimated by the conquerors. On the other hand, their social order was a pre-class one and hence did not provide the\n\ninvaders with a ready-made upper class through which a class-divided society could be managed.\n\nThere was thus a political and a social vacuum which was, in fact,\n\ngradually filled by European settlers. (Had they tried to enter India, for example, in large numbers, they would have been ruined in the military and economic — not to mention cultural — conflict with the Indian state-communal hierarchy.) At the same time, there remained a vast enslaveable labour force, which, augmented by slaves\n\nimported from Java and elsewhere, provided a slavery base for the economy in its then mainly mercantile phase. A colour barrier was raised between masters (of all classes) and slaves, to prevent social diffusion. The confluence of “White” settlement and “Black” slavery on previously communal soil produced a systematic colour bar. This triple combination was unique to South Africa.\n\nChapter Two\n\nSOUTH AFRICANS BEFORE CAPITALISM\n\nU ntil the “bloody birth” of the triplets — Europe, capitalism and colonialism — Africa was a kind of mirror image of Europe, with the Mediterranean as the mirror: North Africa and Southem Europe had cultures at similar levels, and\n\nthe further north one went in Europe the more did it look like its image as one went southwards in Africa. On both edges of the Mediterranean were wide bands of classdivided social formations-feudal and proto — capitalist in Europe, from the Balkans to the Iberian, French and Flemish coasts; and trading, urban-centred and mixed farming communal — despotisms in North, Sudanese and Red Sea Africa. These class societies had opposite modes of production and distribution, including antagonistic property relations: private property dominated on the European side and communal property on the African side. But on both sides the privatisation decreased and the communal forms of property increased as one went away from the Mediterraneanbordered belts: northwards to Scandinavia and southwards towards and into South Africa. The southern African region was not less inhabited nor more riven by wars than the northern European one. Euro-racist historiography has been forced to retreat from, if not to abandon completely, this mythical rationalisation of the right of Europeans to settle in South Africa.’ In both, hunting and herding modes of production and distribution (in brief, systems or modes) predominated. In South Africa the hunters — and food-gatherers — were called “Bushmen” by the\n\n18\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nEuropeans, who regarded these nature-preserving people as wild and who genocided them and first unbalanced and eventually devastated their nature-society eco-system. These Africans were known by themselves or their farming neighbours as !Ke, Batwa or San, which means hunter-gatherer “people”. The first herders of the south of Africa were called “Hottentots” by the Europeans, because they failed or refused to lear or understand the language of these people who called themselves “Khoi-Kho”, or “Men of Men’.\n\nThe San (Hunter-Gatherers) The word “San” is presumed to derive from a root “Sa” meaning “hunters of small animals and gatherers of small plants.? Taken in this socio-economic sense, “San” does not refer to a racial/ethnic group. These hunters and food-collectors were, of course, no more — and no less — the distant descendants of the hominids which frequented Southem Africa over 5.5 million years ago® than were the rest of “homo sapiens” and its members in America, Europe, Asia, Australasia, or the Oceanic islands. Even this is still questioned in some authoritative archaeological circles who do not regard all present humans as descending from and belonging to Homo Sapiens.‘ This racist view does not, however, enter into the still on-going debate between those who hold that “man’s orginal habitat... in our opinion, is a wide belt in South Asia that includes the regions of Malaya and Indo-China, and perhaps extends to part of northeast Africa\"® and those who, led by the Leakeys, hold that the centre of dispersion was around the East/Central African Lakes. Both schools, however, see relevance in the finds in South Africa at Taungs in 1924 (first described by R. Dart), in a Swartkranz cave, in the Transvaal, by J. Robinson, in 1949-50, and in Sterkfontein and Krugersdorp.’\n\nAlthough some archaeologists, (e.g., Oldeggar, from the USSR), regard the San as “physically” distinct from the Khoi-Khoi® others (e.g., |. Schapira) regard them as alike or akin.’ Some (notably R. Singer) used an analysis of contemporary blood-groups to conclude that the Khoi-Khoi and San were one physical” “group” which was part of a wider African “physical” “group”. Such studies, however, belong to race-classification methods based no longer only, or so much, on skeletons as on “gene-pools’, including blood-group genes. Using these procedures “groups” can be shown to belong to one “race” because they both lack certain blood-group genes or because they both share certain genes. The Khoisan “group”, taken biologically and not for the sociological-linguistic group it was or was part of, is presumed to have had numerous blood-genes in common with the “European”, “Asian” and other “races”. This renders the making of race-classifications both absurd and impossible, whether\n\nussng skeletons or gene-pools, unless they lead to only one conclusion: Either all\n\nSouth Africans Before Capitalism\n\n19\n\n“groups” belong to one single human race, and thence are not “groups”; or else there are as many “races” as there are possible combinations of blood-group alleles, i.e., at least thousands.\"\" The San were not a “local race”? or members of a “Khoisan’, “African” or any other race-classified group. They were what their name implied: hunter-gatherers. It is not known whether the San language and social formation were among the socalled “Early Stone Age” tool-makers along the Vaal River, around 50,000 B.C. About the time early Americans are supposed to have come from Asia via the Bering Straits and the Australians to have made the crossing by sea from Indonesia, the San, or people who painted like the San, occupied parts of the Cape and Namibian coast before much of it was covered by the sea when it rose about 100 metres at the end of the glacial age lasting from 50,000 B.C. to 20,000 BC. Cave paintings in Namibia have been dated to 26,000 B.C. Skulls like others dug up around the Mediterranean and “Middle Stone Age” sites were found at Peers cave in the Cape, in Mossel Bay and at Hangklip, False Bay, on the Indian Ocean, and in Hopefield, Florisbad, Fouresmith, Pietersburg and the Cave of Hearths in the Transvaal. Wherever the sources of their migrations, the San were then already spread over all South Africa. Their occupation extended during the “Late Stone Age” (c.20,000 to 1000 B.C.) as sites at Wilton, Smithfield and Namaqualand revealed. It is possible that in this long period as the hunter-gatherers, many of whom were fishermen and some of whom had domesticated the dog, spread and slowly multiplied, the San languages diversified into probably four mutually distinct tongues.\"* Their geographic sources and migrations remain a matter of conjecture. H. Vallois, using a racial approach, suggested that they originated from a more highly developed culture north of South Africa and that they regressed socially in southward migrations. The pairing San family may be such a regression from a larger gentile form. Summers and Clark likewise suggest roots in East Africa, while Singer’s blood-group studies have shaken such hypotheses and been used to suggest a very ancient autocthenous geographic development.\"* It is likely that the San pairing family represents not a regression but a stage enabling and in fact, tolerating, polygamy and polygany. It is also certain that the San travelled “long distances in long time”, for “The whole system of the sun, moon and\n\nstars enters simultaneously into their mythology’. All such linguistic groups practised an egalitarianism or primitive communism which reflected the given stage of technology and productivity. The labour-force acted more communally than is usually imagined. Cooperation was always more important than individualism, and some work was extensive. Thus, during an exploration in 1851 to Namibia, F. Galton, the father of the racist |Q theory in psychology (he wanted to “produce a gifted race of men by judicious marriages’)\"* observing ani-\n\n20\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nmal-trapping on a large-scale by San constructors who used massive tree-trunks and pitfalls, wrote: “the scale of the undertaking would have excited astonishment in far more civilized nations”.\"” One person's labour could not support more than one person and those too young, old or infirmed to labour. Exploitation, including an unequal sexist division of labour, was impossible, for all were engaged in the struggle with nature and “the happiness of all was the condition for the happinesss of each’. Private property in means of labour did not exist and was, if anything, a disadvantage individually and communally. The land, rivers, forests, deserts, and all the mineral and vegetable fruits of the earth and the animals upon the earth belonged both to nature and to the San as nature’s custodian. The food hunted, fished and gathered was as free as the air and the water. These “harmless people”, or “hu twa si' as the Kung San call themselves,\"® were not unique or exceptional, but, as Leo Frobenius wrote, “typical hunters of the world, the lovers of freedom and independence”.\"* Today the decimated, segregated, survivors known as “San” have neither freedom nor independence. The San social formation is dead, killed as it retreated from and\n\nfought against the capitalist mode for 200 years.” 2000 years before Dutch, Boer and British colonialism destroyed the main body of the San and peripheralised the rest into the Kalahari, the San hunter-gatherer mode/system had suffered from a modal change which introduced sexism, including polygamy and an unequal division of labour, private property in domestic animals, and converted egalitarian administration first into matriarchal and then into patriarchal clan/gentile proto-hierarchies. This modal change did not eliminate the San society but subordinated it to a parallel and continguous society, which emerged from its own physical and social midst. That sexist, unequal, but still fundamantally communal, society called its dominant members “Men of Men”, or “Khoi-Khoi”. This self-change was probably promoted by the arrival north of and across the western Limpopo and the Chobe River, which today separates Botswana from the Caprivi Strip of Namibia, of iron-smelting and sheep and cattle rearing and herding Bantu and/or Khoi-Khoi speakers. That hunter-gatherers could, as they did, become hunter-herder-gatherers and these, in turn, herder-cultivators, was a tranformation\n\nalready latent even in communalistic San society itself. This possibility for inequality, derived from improved methods of hunting, fishing and food-gathering, whether such improvements involved better tools or a development of the social productivity of the labour force, including children. The transformation of the struggle with — but not necessarily against — nature was, sooner or later, converted into or supplemented by a struggle against nature, against women, and, in due course, against men. The pre-San society, like tribalism, \"was neither idyllic nor permanent. It was a prolonged but developing stage in the unfolding of human civilization, a stage back to which no return is possible, imaginable or desirable.” At the same time, the San “left behind\n\nSouth Africans Before Capitalism\n\n21\n\nthem indelible paintings and engravings which neither time nor man could erase... Their art reflected their technical development. Yet this same art also reflected their immense backwardness. Since their art was a form of recording their personal or family history, a form of ‘writing’, it was a remote ‘step towards a real phonetic script’, although as paintings ‘increase in value as written signs, they deteriorate as natural representations’, wrote Frobenius.” The “backwardness” of the San is related by racists to their alleged small stature. But even Broome admitted that before the European conquest the Batwa were “men and women of quite ordinary size” and the Soviet scientist, Nesturck, viewed the alleged smallness as a “secondary feature’, not a “biological degradation” in comparing an average height of 1.5 metres with the 1.6 to 1.7 metres of “Pithecanthropus” and “Sinanthropus”. Tobias and others found a not surprising increase in height and weight with a change in diet and social environment, as had likewise been observed with the allegedly “small Japanese” who emigrated from Japan to the U.S.A. The San intermarred with the Khoi-Khoi who branched off from them, and with the Xhosa,\n\nThembu, Mpondo and Zulu whom they were forbidden to marry not by their own customs nor by those of the Zulu, but by the first Boer Republic of Natal.* But, although, in these and other ways, not gene-cided, so to speak, they were to be genocided. This genocide was to come not from the equally native Khoi-Khoi or Bantu but from the European foreigners. Although the San were not generally on equal modal, and hence social and individual, terms with the Khoi-Khoi and Bantu, they were not\n\nenslaved, as they were — and their desperate descendants still are — by European farmers literally hunting for labour. The San hunter-gatherer belonged to a mode which suffered from inequality compared with the hunter-herder and herder-farmer mode of the Khoi-Khoi and Bantu. Kolb possibly plagiarising Grevenboek, described some of these inequalities, which Wikar later called a “client’ relationship.” Similar inequalities existed between the Nama and the (non-San) Dama smelters in Namibia, and between Tswana Bantu and Sarwa (San) pelt-collectors.* The Xhosa king, Rarabe, was reputed (by a missionary) to have once ordered a man-hunt against San who had slaughtered his head ox.”” Livingstone conceded that the Khoi-Khoi and Bantu never enslaved the San and that “never in any one case, within the memory of man, has a Bechuana\n\nchief sold any of his people’*; the missionary, Campbell, said that the Harutshe “knew of no nation who sold men\".” The missionary, Moffat, said that the “Tswana have a servile class” (including Basarwa) \"but no slaves”; while the survivors of the wreck of the “Stavanisse” in 1689 reported of the Nguni-speaking chiefdoms: \"It would be impossible to buy any slaves there\". The sole reported pre-colonial exception in South Africa was the sale of 74 children in Natal Bay to Robert Drury, by\n\n22\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nTsonga sellers acting for Delegoa Bay Portuguese slavers. The untrue concept that “Sarwa” means “slave”, and which persists to this day, is not Tswana but European, exploiting the Bantu-San modal inequality.” Nevertheless, this prejudice is part of a “memorial” going back to the slow modal change from hunting to herding which split the San mode and generated that of the Khoi-Khoi some two millenia before it was genocidally annihilated by the European-capitalist mode of production. The Khoi-San Modal Revolution\n\nThe absurdity of a racial classification separating San, Khoi-Khoi and Bantu is apparent in (a) _ the increasingly acknowledged probability that the Khoi-Khoi were a section\n\nof the San who combined herding with hunting during a modal revolution (b) that major distinctions lie in language differences (c) _ the classification which places the San in a “Stone Age”, the Bantu in an “Iron Age” (and the Khoi-Khoi in a Limbo-Age) (d) that “race” has befogged genuine study, by anti-scientifically combining San (hunters) with Khoi-Khoi (herders) and separating Khoi-Khoi from Bantu herders. “Du Bois traces one wave of Khoi-Khoin migration back to 1000 B.C. when Abyssinian pressure on (in) “Ethiopia, where Khoi-Khoins lived, drove these people south.\n\nEven before this, some 500 years before, however, Khoi-Khoin tribalists\n\nappear to have been settled far from Ethiopia and to have been in close touch with this land. This is illustrated in a mural on the walls of the temple of Beir el Bahri built by Queen Hatshepsut, and designed by Tuthmosis Il. The mural shows an expedition to the legendary city of Punt, and on it ‘The King and Queen of Punt are represented as of the modem Hottentot type, and the Queen with the characteristic steotapygia’.*' More than 3500 years ago the Khoi-Khoin had built a stable monarchy. Through the succeeding thousands of years the Khoi-Khoin tribalists trekked southwards, reached South Africa, came in intimate contact with the 'Ke, and from about\n\n1000 A.D. herded and traded in this country.\"” This picture has been modified by\n\narchaeology, which brings the herding date back to at least 0 A.D., and queried by Singer and others. The northern origin is not incompatible with the theory that a section of the San, probably in northern Botswana, north-eastem Namibia and southeastern Angola, adopted cattle and herding when they came into contact with herders migrating from the north. These herder-trekkers could have been Khoi-Khoi speakers or Bantu-speakers. The Khoi-Khoi could have worked with copper, the Bantu with copper and iron, north\n\nSouth Africans Before Capitalism\n\n23\n\nof the Limpopo at around 0 A.D. Archaeology indicates that cultivation was practised in Zimbabwe by at least 1000 B.C., and that by 0 A.D. iron tools, copper and iron mining, and agriculture, probably of Bantu-speakers, existed not far north of the Kunene, Limpopo, Zambezi rivers and was spreading south of the Capricorn line (which bisects Botswana). Iron sites dated 100 AD, 185 (Mabweni), 330 (Kalomo), 530 (Gokomere, which had miners and stone-builders) were found in Zimbabwe, and folklore includes the claim that Mambo, great-ancestor of the Lobedu, was fathered by Mwanemutepa, Zimbabwe great-king. Sotho-speaking Bantu iron-users crossed the Limpopo by 700, marrying San and Khoi-Khoi, and transmitting copper-mining technology to Khoi-Khoi groups along the present Botswana-Transvaal borders. By the 8th century the new settlers mined copper — and later iron — at Phalaborwa. By 1050 there were farming settlements in Bambandyanalo, and from 1250 in nearby Mapungubwe, which traded on a widescale for about a century. By 1060 iron was mined at Melville Koppies and at Rustenburg and Zeerust, Transvaal, near the Botswana border. Settlements of 15,000 in some 300 rondavels multiplied after the 850-853 revolts in Zanj against Persian domestic slavers had promoted a wave southwards of Bantu mixed farmers, using iron tools for hunting and farming. The settlements traded via Zanj with India and China’s Sung dynasty — a link which was broken in the 16th century by the Portuguese colonialists.* These joined Bantu farmers who had crossed into the Transvaal and Natal already in the 3rd century, as carbon-dating revealed at Silver Leaves farm, Tzaneen, and at Soutpansberg, Transvaal, and St.Lucia Bay, on the Indian Ocean coast. Salt was extracted at Silver Leaves from at least 280 A.D. The confluence of these herders with the San hunter-gatherers probably gave rise to the linguistic herding group which called itself “Khoi-Khoi’. Part of this group probably came from north of the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers where, in any event, the San had lived and painted for ages.“ Another part would have come by segmentation of those San, both north and south of the two rivers, who were attracted to the herding mode of production of the new-comers, whether these were Khoi-Khoi, or\n\nBantu or both (or herders from another language cluster). This formation of the Khoi-Khoi from the San-Khoi-Khoi-Bantu “triangle of forces” was a social revolution, the birth of a new mode/system in and from the old San mode/system. This modal revolution included only in part a transition from “Stone Age” to “Iron Age”. The main change was modal. This was a social revolution which affected both society and nature. Whereas the San always regarded the deserts, waters, forests, plants and animals as friendly protectors or providors, the herding — and even more so, the agricultural — revolution initiated that unbalancing and destabilisation of the society-nature eco-systemic from which the world is still suffering. The erosion, deforestation, diversion of rivers and planting over of the earth was\n\n24\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nbegun by domestication, worsened by agriculture and finally tumed into an ecological disaster, not only on the earth but also in the air and the waters, by the industnes of the capitalist mode of production.\n\n\"Stone Age\" San and \"Iron Age\" Bantu? The “Stone Age” was a misnomer for powerful, cultured and high-technology communal-state class and statised civilizations such as those of the Pharaonic Egyptians, the Babylonians, the early Shang, the Aztec, Inca and others. It may be an equally crude-materialist description of the non-despotic \"primitive\"-communalist societies of the pre-colonial Americans, Australians, Polynesians, and most Asians and Africans. These societies, including the Khoi-Khoin ones, used many materials other than stone, even as the communalistic, non-despotic American societies used wood rather than stone.\n\nTo define societies in terms of the materials used as tools or for construction — stone, bronze, iron, as the case may be — would classify together very different, indeed opposite, modes of production and social formations; and, on the other hand, make distinctions which do not differentiate social formations using different matenals. Thus, the difference between San and Khoi-Khoi lay very little in their matenals: both used stone, wood, shells, ostrich eggs, poisoned arrows, and similar products of the flora and fauna of their surrounds; neither made nor used inorganic containers or\n\nmanufactured pottery, other than hollowed out stones, in the pre-Bantu period over a vast area ranging from the Cape to Tanzania. Nor did the fact that some Khoi-Khoi did metallurgy while few San worked with copper® delineate the San-Khoi modal differences. That the use of criteria related to language, religion and art has proved\n\nmore useful in this respect than the use of criteria related to materials of production and consumption is not a refutation of the principled method of “historical materialism’, but, indeed, its confirmation. For these superstructural elements often reveal more of the infrastructure than the crude materiality of the latter. What is relevant to historical materialists trying to probe South African history is not only — and , indeed, not so much — the forces of production and their materials, but rather the social relations of production within and between different modes.\n\nEuro-Racist Chronicling of Pre-Colonial Societies The reports on the San and Khoi-Khoi of the colonialist Portuguese who landed in Namibia, the Cape or Natal from Diaz's voyage of 1487 to the collapse of the Portuguese hegemony around 1695-1700 in Asia, and also along the East coast of\n\nSouth Africans Before Capitalism\n\n25\n\nAfrica furnished considerable information about the San and Khoi-Khoi — and also some about the Xhosa.* More detailed information was furnished by colonialist travellers/explorers during the Dutch occupation between 1652 and 1795.” With rare exceptions (Sprenger, Grevenbroek) these Portuguese and Dutch reports reflected and contained a racism which increased with time and made reports increasingly unreliable for their veracity. Whereas Sprenger’s accounts and drawings of Xhosa and other families,* like some of the works of Lopez and Grevenbroek, were less racial/racist than contemporary liberal histories, Dapper reflected an open racism only two decades after the Dutch bourgeoisie won its final independence from Spain in 1648.° The travel reports on the San and Khoi-Khoi in the British period were necessarily informative, but almost invariably racially at least as biased as the early Portuguese and Dutch accounts. Among these reports were those of T. Baines (notably his paintings, 1842-53), J. Barrow (1800), S.A. Broadbent (c.1850), W.J. Burchell (1822), J. Campbell (1813, 1822), F. Galton (1851), W.M. Kerr (1886), H. Lichtenstein (1803-5), R. Moffat (1820-1828), D. Moodie (1808-9), and by the missionaries J. Philip (1820's), Van der Kemp (1804-13) and T. Hahn (1881, 1883 reports). From these Portuguese, Dutch and British reports and official documents, including compilations by Moodie and by Theal,® rather, perhaps, than the work of Bleek, Hoemle, Schapera, Marshall, and Thomas“ on the 20th century human survivors of genocide,\n\na picture of the Khoi-Khoi society may be focussed. For these survivors are not part of a past hunting-herding mode, but belong to the capitalist racist mode. Khoi-Khoi and Bantu Hunters, Herders and Farmers\n\nThe Khoi-Khoi and the Bantu, “whom the Christian Europeans called “Kaffirs”\n\n(unbelievers) because these people did not worship idols, crucifixes, virgin mothers or anthropomorphic gods’, enjoyed and suffered under the same mode, whether they lived together or separately. Race-classification and linguistic distinctions opacifies this common-ness. They had a common type of clan or gens structure, described by Dapper, Kolb, Ten Rhyne in the 17th and 18th centuries.* Centuries\n\nlater, first Hahn, then Hoemle, confirmed this clan structure, relying, however, on survivors who were no longer members of the old mode.“ Both lived in large clan-based communities. Marriage was usually exogamous, but even when it appeared to be endogamous, as among the Khoi-Khoi, Sotho and Tswana speakers, this was not really the case. Such exceptions (to Morgan’s grand tule, in his classic) were more apparent than real, for they allowed marnages between “cross-cousins’, that is, the children of brothers and sisters. When examined in the context of gentile patriarchy\n\n26\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nor matriarchy, cross-cousins clearly belong to different gentes or clans, as Thunberg reported after his 1772 joumey at the Cape. In addition to a fundamentally identical gens/clan structure, both herded, hunted and also tilled, and both had chiefs and elders and multi-clan communal aggregates. There were some Bantu who did not fish, hunt or till, and others who did. The same\n\nwas true of the Khoi-Khoi. In both herding was combined with hunting and both traded on a large scale in ivory and, from the 18th century, also in guns.* In the very year of 1652, San fishermen seized cattle from the Van Riebeeck settlement, herded\n\nthem and used them as articles of subsequent trade.’ Dapper reported on trading by the Nama with Portuguese via the Ovambo speaking Bantu. Cheap beads made in ltaly were sold for hunting and herding products and the Khoi-Khoi thereby fell into an early “unequal exchange” trap based on disadvantageous terms of trade, measured in use-values. The Khoi-Khoi, like Bantu herders, often rode their oxen, which facili-\n\ntated trading.* Da Gama’s crew saw Khoi-Khoi riding oxen in 1497 and, 12 years later, oxen were ridden and used as “tanks” by the Khoi-Khoi against the punitive expedition fatally launched by D’Almeida at the mouth of the Salt River, in Table Bay. Trading with the Delegoa Bay Portuguese by Nguni herders around 1800 played a part in the Difaqane/Mfecane (consolidation of the Zulu kingdom and destruction of other chiefdoms) which we shall duly need to review. While trading with African and Asian societies did not imply or produce unequal terms of trade, economic, political or cultural subjection, trade with the European capitalist mode undermined the economies and societies of the San, Khoi-Khoi and Bantu. This erosion began long before the Dutch settlement in 1652. For example, in 1591 the African-Portuguese trading rate was 1 ox for 2 knives; but by 1691 it had fallen to 1 ox + 7 sheep for 3 iron barrel hoops (Dutch East India Comapny and Portuguese shippers’ reports). The Von Thunen-Braudel “World economy” centre-periphery model fails to show the distinction between pre-capitalist and capitalist trading. The former is not necessarily unequal and exploitative, whereas capitalist trading between rich and poor nations is inevitably unequal. The African-Asian pre-colonial trade and the trade between San,\n\nKhoi-Khoi and Bantu with Europeans belong to different modal relations of production and distribution. This Marxist modal optic is required to enable trade to be historically periodised and interpreted. “The word Bantu is an exclusively linguistic label and has no other primary implications, either of race or culture”, wrote D.W. Phillipson.” He traced the movements of and in this “family of dialects’ (called “Bantu” by W.H.I. Bleek, a German philologist who worked in Africa in the late 19th century) to large “Early Iron Age” mixed farming settlements founded “from about 300 BC to AD 600\" in “regions to the south of central Tanzania”, where previously “the indigenous population lived by hunting and gathering”, and where domesticated animals and metal working were unknown.*\n\nSouth Africans Before Capitalism\n\n27\n\nThe new iron-using and mixed-farming settlers are presumed to have been part of an eastern stream moving towards the Indian Ocean from the \"shores of Lake Victoria by 500 BC”. A western stream, from the same source in central Africa, is taken to have moved westwards and then southwards towards Angola, Namibia, Botswana\n\nand the western Transvaal. By 400 AD this flux had crossed the Limpopo into South Africa. The work of J.H. Greenberg, B. Heine, D. Dalby and others has persuaded\n\nmost scholars that this iron-cattle-farming spread was the work of Bantu-speaking people. The source of this diaspora from the Great Lakes was presumed to have been constructed by previous migrations from the Cameroons in the region between the Niger and Zaire river-basins. These Great Treks (compared with the miniscule “Great Trek” of the Boers after 1834) brought with them sheep, goats, cattle and agricultural techniques developed in the West Sudan from about 2000 B.C.* An eastern stream moved down along or parallel to the Indian Ocean coast, probably impelled by class struggles in Zanj in the 9th century, including a “slave revolt” led by the “Lord of the Blacks” and the sacking of Basra. Commenting on this Bantu emigration from “Azania”, Schapera wrote: “We shall probably not be far from the truth if we place the great southem migration of the Bantu at about this period.” The final major migrations were caused by the Portuguese conquests, masacres, destruction of cities like Kilwe Kisiwane,® slaving® and commerce in Angola and Mozambique. These set in motion further southward movements, which accreted settlements to those already established in Botswana, the Transvaal, Natal and the\n\nEastem Cape. Among these pre-Portuguese-colonial settlements were Nguni in the Drakensberge foothills, from 1300, the Venda and their trading “clients”, the Lemba, in the Transvaal from 1370, the Baralong, founded by \"Morolong,” \"the iron forger’, and his son, Noto, “the hammer’, in the Zeerust area around 1300. The Xhosa, dis-\n\ntantly descended from “Mnguni”, were in the Eastern Cape when Diaz built his “padrao” near the Bushman’s River in 1497, and their many head of cattle were seen by Da Gama when he passed the place in 1497. The accounts of reporters on da Gama’s ships and of his Arab guide, Madjid, reveal large settlements which grew sorghum, had goats and cattle, used iron weapons and the hoe. The San hunters and the Khoi-Khoi and Bantu herders were along the entire coast of Namibia, the Cape and Natal when the Portuguese first rounded and passed the Cape of Good Hope in the late 15th century. Among those who recorded these Khoi-Khoi-Bantu societies were: Saldanha (1503), D'Almeida (1509), the crews of the wrecks of the “Sao Joao” (who fought with “Kaffirs’ with large cattle herds, and met their Tsonga chief, Nyaka, in 1552), of “Sao Bento” (who, says Theal, reported in 1554 that “the country was thickly populated\n\nand provided with cattle\" — and goats, millet and iron tools), the “Santo Thome” (1589. The crew met a “Vamba kingdom, where our own people also carry on a\n\n28\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\ntrade in ivory’, said a document collected by Theal).\n\nIn 1591 an English trader,\n\nLancaster, faced hostile Khoi-San at the Cape, but traded for about 1000 cattle and\n\nsheep. In 1593 the crew of the “Santo Alberto”, wrecked near Diaz's padrao, travelled through “thickly populated” settlements as they made their way towards Lourenco Marques. They wee received with traditional Nguni hospitality and some of such travellers became part of Bantu society. As Peter Kolb wrote of the herders in 1719: “They are certainly the most friendly, the most liberal, the most benevolent people to one another that ever appeared upon earth... The integrity of the Hottentots, their strictness and celerity in the execution of justice and their chastity are things in which they excel all or most other nations in the world.\"*’ The story continues in relations by the crews of the ship-wrecks of the “Sao Joao” in 1622, who met Khoi-Khoi fishermen near the Fish River, and later “an infinite num-\n\nber of kraals with herds of cattle and gardens’ in Bantu villages; of the “Noss Senhora de Belem” (the last name refers to the port of departure on the Tejo river mouth in Lisbon), whose crew in 1635 met Xhosa herders who hunted “buffaloes, tigers\" (leopards), \"lions and elephants” and who grew millet, maize (from the American colonies), sugar-cane (later to become vital for Natal’s colonialist economy), and used many milk products. The frontier along which the European-capitalist and the African communalist modes clashed was in the concept and practice of property in land and in labour. No chief could sell land. He/she was merely its custodian on behalf of the clan or society or kingdom. The most the chief could do was to grant usufruct. This did not stop the Europeans from repeatedly violating this law through false and falsified “treaties”, usually drawn up by missionaries. The Portuguese, Da Gama, violated such a law by using wood and water without communal consent and was wounded at St. Helena Bay as a result. A similar reason lies behind the lawful killing, in battle in fact, of Francisco D’Almeida and 65 of his men in 1510. In this case, as in others, “Property and organised society must be indicated as the factors that control and determine the\n\nconditions of regular warfare\".\n\nChapter Three\n\nCAPITALIST SLAVERY VERSUS COMMUNALISM\n\nT: phases of capitalist development defined according to the dominant form of capital — usurous/commercial, industrial, financial — have their nether sides in the colonial processes which enabled these phases. These same forms, however, from the viewpoint of the Africans, as of the Asians and Americans,\n\nwere not seen as forms of capital, but as forms of labour and dispossession. Thus usurous/commercial capital, which came past South Africa with the Portuguese from 1487, and which settled itself in the Cape in 1652 via the instrument of the Dutch East India Company (DEIC), appeared to the San hunters and the Khoi-Khoi and Bantu communalist farmers as slavery, dispossession and genocide. This view was objectively correct, for the Portuguese and Dutch capital adventurers had as their aim the winning of slaves, new lands, raw materials, precious metals, spices, luxuries and markets. Here, as elsewhere, the subjectivity of the conquered, dispossessed,\n\nenslaved and dispossessed coincided with historical objectivity. Therein, too, lies the objectivity of anti-Eurocentric historiography.\n\nThe Portuguese \"Navigators\" Historiography has underplayed the colonialistic and enslaving role of Henry the Navigator (1394-1460), his school in Sagres, near Point Vincent, the south-west point of Europe, and his naval base at Lagos, on the Algarve coast of Portugal.\n\n30\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nColonialistic mercantile forces were already at work during the racist wars of expulsion of the Moroccan Arab-Africans from Lisbon in 1150, and in 1189 fron their brilliantly cultured Algarve capital, Silves, founded in 711. English Crusaders hired by King Sancho | massacred 6000 Moors out of the 30,000 in Silves and the 2000-year old port of Lagos. Retaken in 1191 by the Sultan of Morrocco, both cities finally fell to the Portuguese King Alfonso Ill in 1249. From Lagos Henry seized Ceuta in Morocco in 1415. This opened the W. African coast to Portugal and Gil Eannes sailed to Cape Bojivar in 1434. Goncalves (or da Silva) brought African captives to Lagos in 1441, when the first capitalist slave market in Europe was opened. By 1440 the first colonialist Christian mission was built at Fadouth, Senegal. Insufficient attention, too, has been paid to the eroding effect of the Portuguese navigators on the African societies along the coasts of Namibia, the Cape and Natal. Already by 1484 Diego Cao planted a cross 100 kilometres north of Swakopmund. Portuguese landings for water and food cannot but have bruised the San-Khoi bodypolitic in Namibia — and Namaqualand. In February 1488, after landing a West coast captive at Wolfish Bay and “Angra Pequina’” to contact local herders, Bartholemew Diaz landed at “the Cape of Cowherds” (Mossel Bay), where a crewman shot a hunter (or herder) with a cross-bow — the first murder by capitalism in South Africa. Such a tragedy would soon become known over a wide area. Diaz’s padrao on False Island to S. Gregory' was broken up by the Afncans. Diaz then landed at the “River Infante” (the Fish or Keiskamma River), then erected a “padrao” (discovered by Axelson in 1938) near the Bushman River. He then is said to have erected another padrao, to St. Joseph (some reports say St. Filipe) on False Bay, and a cross at Hout Bay. Retuming in 1500, he was blown around Cape Point to a sea-grave.? Already by then Flemish and German capital had been accumulated from tribute passing over the Austrian Alps exacted by Venetian colonialists in Turkey and Egypt from the time of the Crusades. These capitalists had obtained from King John II Royal Concessions which financed the 15th century Portuguese search for a route to India. Martin Behaim, who was connected with Nuhremberg manufacturers, and J.\n\nMunzer, brought details ot the African route to India from Germany to Lisbon between 1485 and 1495. Rhenish Hansa League capital gave “Portuguese” colonialism a “European” character. This proto-Europeanism necessarily found ideological expression. As shown elsewhere,’ Christianity and a supra-national European racism became twin banners of commercial capital's colonial expeditions. Anti-paganism alone could not serve as a banner, if only because there was, at the time of Diaz's first voyage, talk of “converting” the Coptic Christians in Ethiopia, and Islam and Jewry were old Mediterranean foes.’ The voyage of Diaz was parallel to a simultaneous one, by Alfonso de Paiva\n\nCapitalist Slavery Versus Communalism\n\n31\n\nand Pero da Covilha, via the Mediterranean, to Prester’s Ethiopia.® In due course religious bigotry was subsumed in the race-discrimination which it had itself fostered in its Western and Eastern Crusades. The Inquisition made a racist blood theory which distinguished between “limpieza Y mala sangre” (“pure and bad blood”). 2000 Jews died in Lisbon in 1506 in a racist-religious massacre. The 12th-13th century anti-Arab wars in Portugal and the drive through Spain in the 15th century were waged with both religious and racist fervour.’ This religious racism was first brought to South Africa by the Portuguese, 150 years before the Dutch colonisation. The ship-diary of Alvaro Velho, from the “Sao Rafael’, in Vasco da Gama’s first voyage, of 1497-9, and the reports of Lopes de Castenhada, give detailed accounts of the stay of the men of Da Gama’s four ships in “Angra de Santa Helena” for a week, from 3 August 1497, and in “Angra de Sao Braz” (Mossel Bay) for two weeks, from 25 November.® “This land has dark men’, wrote Velho about St. Heiena. The indigens fished (there were also sea-lions and whales), hunted for “came de gazelas’, gathered root-foods, wore skins and refused barter for nails, cimmamon and gold. Some “40 or 50” came to the beach, and on the last day threw arrows which wounded a captain and three or four men.\n\nAfter the ships rounded Cape Point they anchored in Mossel Bay — the scene of the first murder, as Diaz's son, who had been with his father at Mossel Bay (“Diaz Beach” still recalls that landing) and now a member of Da Gama's crew, recalled. Da Gama’s men feared that the news of their skirmish at St. Helena might have reached Mossel Bay. During their fortnight there they saw large groups of hunter-herders, whom they likened to those of St. Helena. The Mossel Bay settlement hunted elephants (in the present Knysna area). One such group numbered 90, another over 200, with oxen, cows and sheep. A captain, Afonsa, who knew some Bantu from slaving in Manicongo, was unable to communicate with the Africans, who were almost surely San-Khoi hunter-herders. They had flutes and danced, drank and ate together with the Portuguese. This conviviality indicates the low level of racism — but not its absence — at the time. The herders fled when the Portuguese fired cannon. After Da Gama raised a cross and a padrao, some “10 or 12 negros” “stole the cross as well as the padrao”. When Da Gama passed Diaz’s padrao on the island of “Chaos”, “15 leagues from Rio Do Infante” (Fish River), he saw two men. After passing and fishing off Natal on 15-28 December, Da Gama proceeded towards Mozambique, where he saw a populous town, “with a lord among them’. On his retum joumey from cities in India and Zanj, Da Gama once more stopped at Mossel Bay, where his crew fished anchovies and hunted sea-lion, staying for 9 days before retuming, without stopping at Table Bay, to Lisbon.

This voyage was the occasion for intngue between Italian, German and Portuguese merchants, vying for the monopoly of the trade with Sofala, Melinde, Calicut and Cochim. This intrigue included a ruse that the aim of the voyage was not India but to attack the Turks in Mecca and Cairo. Italian merchants like Marchioni and Affaitadi had trading houses in Portugal. Among those interested were the Duke of Ferrara, Venetian and Florentine merchants, and diplomats (who met D. Manuel of\n\nPortugal secretly in the palace of Sintra, outside Lisbon). In a subsequent voyage, that of d’Albuquerque in 1503-4, the Papacy in Bologne were among those involved. On the German side there were Conrad Peutinger, C. Welser, who had a factory in Lisbon, and the “Grand Company of Germania’.* These multi-nationals and their rivalries formed part of the birth-pains of “Europe”. This formative process was accelerated by da Gama’s 2nd Voyage, coming as it did soon after the voyages of Columbus and Vespucchi (1500-1-2), and the first voyage of da Gama, who, in tum, advised Cabral for his famous voyage to Brazil the year after da Gama returned to Lisbon in 1499. This voyage was fired by the vision of the “Mines of Salomon” (Monomotapa in Zimbabwe), source of the gold and gems of Sofala, and of spices and dyes from India and Indonesia. Although already bruised by the first landings, Southern Africa was not yet itself a target or prize. G. da Empoli gave a personal account of the voyage, from 6 April 1503 to 20 August 1504, of the future Governor of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, and his brother Francisco. Merchants from Florence, Venice and Bruges took part in what da Empoli, a citizen of Florence, gave out to be his own voyage to India.'°Alfonso’s ship returned laden with “pimenta de Coulao e gengibre de Cananor’. Reports contain references to “African savages” seen at the Cape of Good Hope and Empoli described the herders, whom he saw at Mossel Bay, and who had ironpointed\n\nweapons, as “brutal people”.\"\" The ship anchored in a bay of “Santohiago”, 70 leagues from Cape Point, i.e., in the Eastem Cape, where the crew saw “people neither white nor brown, of great size, without hair, and all painted\", with large herds of\n\ncattle and sheep, and whom they described as “bestial people”: an early 16th century sign of race-prejudice. In Cochim Alfonso D’Albuquerque met up with Antonio Saldanha’s “armada”, which had already rounded the Cape. The heavily armed fleet of the Castilian, Antonio de Saldanha, had left Lisbon on 14 May 1503 in what was effectively an independent voyage, one option of which was an attack on Mecca.” The three ships of the fleet halted in the Bay of St. Helena and, for three days, at Mossel Bay (Angra de S. Bras), where the crew fished, took wood, meat and goats, probably by bartering with the Khoi-San there. Saldanha is reported to have anchored off Table Bay, to have climbed Table Mountain, and to\n\nCapitalist Slavery Versus Communalism\n\n33\n\nhave taken fresh water from the Salt River, flowing from the mountain into the Bay. When Francisco D’Almeida met his death there six years later, reports referred to the\n\nplace as “Saldanha Bay’. This name, however, was later given to the unwatered bay just south of St. Helena Bay, about 200 kilometres north of Table Bay. German Merchant — Financers of the \"Discoveries\"\n\nThe sixth Portuguese “armada” to intrude upon the South African coastal societies was that led by the first Viceroy or Governor of Portuguese India, Francisco D’Almeida. On 1 August 1504 D. Manuel authorized a society of German and Italian merchants to incorporate three ships in the fleet due to sail under the command of Tristan da Cunha, substituted by Francisco de Almeida. Among the conditions of this “privilege” was that a German agent should sail on each ship. Among these were Baltasar Sprenger and Hans Mayr. Of the capital of 66000 ducats the Nuhremberg and Augsberg merchants held 20,000 or 30%; Welser and Vochlin 3000 or 4.5%:\n\nGossenbrot 6%; the powerful Fuggers (mentioned in this connection in Marx's Capital) 6% each; 8.5% to Hochsetter, Hirschvogel, Imhoff and other Germans. Thus the German share of the capital was 55%. The remainder, 29,400 ducats, was subscribed by Genovese and Florentine capitalists.* This voyage of the Conquistador, de Almeida, marked the “take-off” of what we have called “hidden German colonialism’.* A leading financier of the Portuguese expeditions was Jacob Fugger, who was a banker to Charles V of Spain. In 1504 alone Antwerp received 1000 tonnes of pigment and spices from Calicut. The Affaitadi held a semi-monopoly for the Flemish spice trade from 1508 to 1514, when the monopoly fell to the FuggerWelser financial empire. It was to their houses in Augsburg that Tome Lopes was sent by the Portuguese monarchy. Thus, the ships sailing around the Cape and anchoring at St. Helena Bay, False bay, Table Bay, Mossel Bay, off the Eastern Cape River mouths and Natal-Swaziland bays, were vessels not only of Portuguese but primarily of German capital.\"® The weight of this “European” capital increasingly bore down on the San-Khoi and Bantu social order in a two-pronged assault. One came from Angola, where Portugal began slaving soon after Cabral’s “discovery” of Brazil in 1500; the other from Mozambique, where Portuguese-German-Flemish-ltalian slaving and unequal exchange trading increased and pressed upon the Natal population, draining both of their wealth and their resisance to slavery. The thrust from Mozambique, after accumulating for three centuries, and then joining forces with the land-seizures of Britons and Boers moving northwards from the Cape, was to become decisive in the socalled “Zulu Difaqane\" after 1800. The de Almeida armada which left Lisbon with 6 ships and 1500 armed men,\n\n34\n\nEuropean Colonial Despotism\n\nbrought the total of ships leaving Portugal via the Cape for India from and including da Gama’s 1497 voyage to 114. Of these 55 returned. The number passing and anchoring at the Cape in these 8 years was, on average, one a month: a considerable influence on the fringes of South African societies. The three Germans in de Almeida’s ships corresponded with Dr. Conrad Peutinger (1465-1547), secretary of the City of Augsburg. Sprenger’s diary gives objective details of the people at the Cape, Mossel Bay, and along Zanj coast.\" A 1513 map of Waldseemuller, Strasbourg, drawn only 25 years after Diaz's pioneering voyage, names no fewer than 40 places along the South African coast. C.F. Mentzel’s 1785 records of the German-Portuguese trading expeditions show that, for fear of the San-Khoi along Table Bay, the Portuguese used to land on Robben Island, from where they got water and supplies while they raided or bartered with mainland hunters, fishermen and herders.'’ He wrote of the racism of the “boorish"
