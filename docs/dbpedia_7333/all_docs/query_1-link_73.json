        "text": "Transcription of the diary of an officer of the 1st Life Guards during the Boer War.\n\nRoll of honours and casualties at end – as in original.\n\nNote : original in private possession; if quoting from this work, please acknowledge this site as source.\n\nBracketed numbers refer to footnotes at end.\n\nTHE AUTHOR :\n\nWalter Waring JP DL (1876 – 1930) was a British soldier and politician, son of Charles Waring, Liberal Member of Parliament for Poole, and Eliza, daughter of Sir George Denys Bt., of Draycott, Yorkshire. Educated at Eton.\n\nWaring was commissioned into the 1st Life Guards in 1897 and served in the Boer War 1899-1900 (for which he was awarded the Queen’s South Africa Medal and six clasps, and was mentioned in despatches). Promoted to Captain in 1904.\n\nIn 1901 he married Lady Clementine Hay CBE, only daughter of William Hay, 10th Marquess of Tweeddale. The couple had two daughters.\n\nHe served in the Yeomanry during World War I in France and Macedonia, 1915–1917, and in the Naval Intelligence Division during 1918 (Legion of Honour).\n\nServed as Master of the Horse to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1906-1907 and was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1909-1910.\n\nWaring was unsuccessful Liberal candidate in Wigtonshire in 1906 and sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Banffshire from 1907–1918, and as Coalition Liberal for Blaydon from 1918–1922, and National Liberal for Berwick and Haddington from 1922–1923, when he lost the seat.\n\nHe was the Municipal Reform (Conservative) member of London County Council for East Lewisham from 1925 to 1928 and later contested Wallsend as a Conservative in 1929.\n\nWaring served as and to the Secretary of State for War, 1919-1922. Waring died in 1930.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTHE COMPOSITE REGIMENT OF HOUSEHOLD TROOPS\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899, a Composite Regiment was formed from Household troops. It comprised one squadron 1st Life Guards, one squadron 2nd Life Guards and one squadron of the Royal Horse Guards. The regiment sailed on the Maplemore on 30th November 1899 and on the Pinemore on 4th December, the vessels arriving at the Cape on the 24th and 29th December respectively.\n\nAfter their arrival the regiment was sent to join Lieut. General French’s forces in the central district, after which one squadron or another was constantly involved in French’s numerous minor engagements between 7th January 1900 and the end of that month, when the general was ordered with most of the cavalry to Modder River. In General French’s despatch of 2nd February 1900 Major Carter, 1st Life Guards, was mentioned for skill and resolution in leading and Lieutenant C. C. De Crespigny, 2nd Life Guards, for great gallantry in bringing wounded men out of action.\n\nOn 3rd February 1900 Major General MacDonald was ordered to take the Highland Brigade, two squadrons of the 9th Lancers, and the 62nd Battery R.F.A. westward, and to seize Koedoesberg (or Koodoosberg) Drift on the Modder River, 40 miles S.E. of Kimberley. MacDonald built a small fort here on 3rd Feb. but his first contact with the Boers, under Cmdt. F. J. du Plooy barring the route to Kimberley came on 5th Feb. Boer reinforcements under Christian de Wet, A.P.J. Cronje and C.C. Froneman strengthened Boer forces up to over 600 men with one field gun, and a sharp action took place on 7th Feb., which resulted in the Boers falling back to new positions to the north. A cavalry brigade under Major General Babington, consisting of the Household Regiment, 2nd Dragoons, 10th Hussars, and part of the 6th Dragoons, was sent to MacDonald’s assistance and after pursuing the enemy for some distance the whole force returned to Modder River.\n\nA large mounted force was now assembled and placed under General French, with orders to press through to the besieged mining town of Kimberley via Ramdan, De Kiel and Waterval Drifts on the Riet River and Klip Drift on the Modder. Skirting the left flank of Boer forces under General Cronje, they would then relieve Kimberley. French’s cavalry division comprised :\n\n1st Brigade, Brigadier-General T. C. Porter\n\n6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers)\n\n2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)\n\nPart of the 6th Dragoons (Inniskillings)\n\n2nd Brigade, Brigadier – General R. Broadwood,\n\nComposite Regiment of Household Troops\n\n10th Hussars\n\n12th Lancers\n\n3rd Brigade, Brigadier General J. R. P. Gordon\n\n9th Lancers\n\n16th Lancers\n\nR.H.A. – G, O, P, Q, R, T, and U Batteries\n\nMounted Infantry\n\nAustralian mounted forces\n\nPart of Rimington’s Guides\n\nFrench faced no severe fighting; the speed of his movement enabled him to take the enemy by surprise and the drifts were seized with little loss. Early on the 15th, he came against a strong position, or rather two positions. With the 2nd and 3rd Brigades, he galloped through the defile (Klip Drift) (1) between the two in extended order until he reached some low hills, from which he was able to cover the advance of the rearmost troops. The enemy attempted to make a stand, but few of French’s men managed to get to close quarters before the Boers fell back. On the same day the mounted troops entered Kimberley, ending the siege and “relieving” the garrison.\n\nThere was to be little rest or respite. At 3.30 a.m. on the 16th February 1900, French started to drive the Boers from their positions north of Kimberley and part of his force became very heavily engaged. Had the general foreseen the orders coming from headquarters he would have spared his men and horses. After midnight a message was received from Lord Kitchener that Cronje had retreated, and French was asked to head him off.\n\nAt 3.30 a.m. on the 17th, Broadwood’s brigade, with the Household element, was ordered to start on this task. The artillery accompanying Broadwood were G and P Batteries RHA. At 12.15 p.m. their first shell hit Cronje’s leading waggon as it stood with its drivers ready to descend into the drifts. The 10th Hussars then galloped for a kopje, just beating some Boers to it. All afternoon the two batteries poured shells among the waggons crowded near the drift. In the late afternoon the dust of Kelly-Kenny’s division was seen in the west, but it was the morning of the 18th before the infantry actually came into contact with Cronje’s force; fortunately he had not slipped away during the night as he might have done. What followed was the battle – or siege – of Paardeberg, which was afterwards largely an infantry affair and saw the surrender of an entire Boer army.\n\nLord Roberts’ despatch of 28th February 1900 does not mention the heading-off of Cronje on the 17th; indeed one would gather from the despatch that French’s force only came into contact with Cronje on the 18th. General Kelly-Kenny’s despatch of 20th February gives the same impression, but in the commendations attached to his despatch of 31th March Lord Roberts, in mentioning General French, says, “After engaging the enemy on the 16th he made a forced march to Koodoesrand Drift (2) and cut off the line of retreat of the enemy’s force.”\n\nThe battle of Osfontein (3) or Poplar Grove (4) was fought on 7th March. In his telegram of that date Lord Roberts said: “We have had a very successful day and completely routed the enemy, who are in full retreat. The position they occupied was extremely strong and cunningly arranged with a second line of entrenchments, which would have caused us heavy loss had a direct attack been made. The turning movement was necessarily wide owing to the nature of the ground, and the cavalry and horse artillery horses are much done up. The fighting was practically confined to the cavalry division, which, as usual, did exceedingly well.” Broadwood’s brigade played a leading role. One officer and 1 man of the 12th Lancers were killed, 1 man of the 2nd Life Guards was killed, and there were several officers and men wounded in these regiments and in the 9th Lancers and 10th Hussars.\n\nThe army’s advance continued and on the 10th March Lord Roberts fought the battle of Driefontein (5). The 1st and 2nd Cavalry Brigades tried by a turning movement to force the enemy to evacuate their position, but the long-range guns of the Boers enabled them to hold on until an assault by the infantry of VI Division cleared the kopjes. There was much criticism of the work of the cavalry on the 10th; it was said that French should have pushed on harder. The criticism seems to be ungenerous, especially when one considers what the men and horses had done over the previous five weeks. Attacking trenches and hills held by riflemen is not the role of a cavalry division when the infantry are at hand.\n\nOn the 12th March, French with the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Brigades seized positions to the south and south-west of the Orange Free State capital, Bloemfontein, which commanded the town, and on the 13th it was entered by Lord Roberts.\n\nFor the operations prior to 13th March 3 officers and 3 non – commissioned officers of the Household Cavalry were mentioned in the despatch of 31st.\n\nLord Roberts and many others seemed to think that the enemy’s opposition in the Free State was practically over and soon some columns—dangerously small, as it turned out—were sent out from Bloemfontein to issue proclamations and complete the pacification of the Free State. General Broadwood headed towards Ladybrand (6), but, from what he saw of the strength of the enemy, deemed it advisable to return. On 30th March he was camped at Thabanchu (7) with Q and U Batteries RHA, 160 men of the Household Cavalry, 160 of the 10th Hussars, and 800 of Alderson’s Mounted Infantry.\n\nBroadwood decided to retire on Sannah’s Post, having to fight a rear-guard action as he did. The baggage was sent on in advance, arriving at the bivouac at 11 p.m. the rest of the force reaching the camp at 3.30 a.m. At daylight, Boers in force were seen to the north and east, the camp being shelled from the latter direction. As a continuation of the retirement was ordered, a spruit had to be crossed about 2000 yards from the camp. Much of the baggage had already descended into the spruit; U Battery had approached close to the bank and Q Battery was not far behind, when about 600 Boers in the spruit opened fire. Q Battery galloped back so as to come into action about 1000 yards from the spruit. Broadwood ordered the Household Cavalry and 10th Hussars to get into the spruit higher up and this was done. The Mounted Infantry company of the Durham Light Infantry were acting as escort to Q Battery and Alderson with more Mounted Infantry covered their final retirement. Eventually the bulk of the force got across the spruit, where the cavalry had secured a passage; but the whole of the baggage, five guns of U Battery, and two guns of Q Battery were lost. [see Brigadier General Broadwood’s report of 20th April 1900 and Lord Roberts’ covering despatch of 19th June.] It was unfortunate that the baggage and artillery were not preceded by a mounted screen, but the whole circumstances pointed to the attack coming from the north or east and Broadwood was led or driven into a clever ambush. Lord Roberts stated that he was of opinion “that no specific blame can be attributed to the general officer commanding the force.”\n\nTowards the end of April General Ian Hamilton commenced his operations round Thabanchu preparatory to moving north on Winburg. On 26th and 27th April Gordon’s 3rd and Dickson’s 4th Cavalry Brigades had stiff fighting. These brigades soon left with General French to join the main army.\n\nOn 4th May Broadwood’s 2nd Brigade joined Ian Hamilton when he was being opposed by about 4000 of the enemy with thirteen guns, while another party was moving up from the west. Broadwood grasped the situation and with two squadrons of the Guards and two of the 10th Hussars seized a ridge between the two Boer forces. This prevented a junction there and the enemy soon fell back.\n\nAt the crossing of the Zand River (8) the Boers looked like making a stand, but it was only a feint. The 2nd Cavalry Brigade did some useful work on this occasion. There was little more fighting on the way to Pretoria except in the action at Florida and the more serious resistance at Doornkop (9) on 29th May, where the 1st Gordon Highlanders distinguished themselves. The cavalry on that day had tried to get round the enemy’s right, but had failed to do so.\n\nIn the operations at Diamond Hill (10) on 11th and 12th June, French with the 1st and 4th Cavalry Brigades was on the extreme left and Broadwood and Gordon were on the right. On both flanks the cavalry failed to carry out a turning movement and Broadwood was indeed at one time hard pressed, since the enemy came on with great boldness, getting close to Q Battery RHA. To help the guns Broadwood ordered the 12th Lancers and Household Cavalry to charge and both charges were successful. On the 12th the infantry gained the ridge in front and that night the enemy retired.\n\nTowards the end of June 1900 the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Brigades started with General Hunter from Heidelberg for the north-east of the Orange Free State (or Orange River Colony as it had been renamed), where it was hoped to corner a large Boer force.\n\nOn 15th July the 2nd Brigade was detached from Sir Archibald Hunter’s force and next day began a pursuit of Christian de Wet, who was followed to the Vredefort-Reitzburg district. But after a very long chase, de Wet escaped through the Megaliesberg mountains on 15th August.\n\nThe brigade thereafter accompanied Lord Kitchener to Elands River in order to relieve Colonel Hore and his 300 Australians, who had been holding out for weeks against a great force of Boers. The brigade marched back to Pretoria via Banks, arriving at the capital on 30th August. In the meantime, Lord Roberts had started on his advance to Koomati Poort, so that the 2nd Brigade missed that part of the campaign. On 23rd September Broadwood’s brigade and some infantry again left Pretoria for the Rustenburg district and operated there for some time.\n\nIn his despatch of 15th November 1900 Lord Roberts mentioned that the brigade had marched 1200 miles between 29th April and 28th August. On 7th November 1900 the Composite Household Regiment sailed on the Hawarden Castle for Southampton.\n\nDIARY OF LT.

Enemy’s shells came well into us, but did not burst. One New Zealander killed, and General Clements’ horse shot under him.\n\nJan. 26\n\nGeneral French came over and inspected horses, was very complimentary on scouting and horses, which is satisfactory. Quiet day.\n\nJan. 27\n\nQuiet day.\n\nJan. 28\n\nOut on patrol. Nothing exciting. Nine blacks gave themselves up. Longing for news of Ladysmith. Service in the afternoon.\n\nJan. 29\n\nDoing nothing just now. More blacks come in.

Luggage van not to be compared to a Pulman’s car.\n\nFeb. 4\n\nLooked around place. Melancholy sight, one huge graveyard.\n\nFeb. 5\n\nFrightful dust storm lasting 3 hours, spoiling dinner, temper, and everything.\n\nFeb. 6\n\nOn patrol N.E. of camp. Not allowed to go beyond outpost line. Great rot in consequence.\n\nFeb. 7\n\nOrdered 9 a.m. to turn out whole Cavalry division. 2 batteries R.H.A. went off 20 miles to relieve MacDonald at Koodoosberg. Caught enemy in flank and shelled him out of position. Advanced twice and completely routed him. Veltd set on fire by shell blazed for two days. We were escort to guns. 2nd and Blues lost several horses and men wounded in trying to cut off enemy. Bivouaced by the river.\n\nFeb. 8\n\nOut at 4 a.m. to occupy positions. Did nothing all day, heat very trying. All went back to camp at 6 p.m. arriving Modder at 12 p.m. Trying march 20 hours without food.\n\nFeb. 9\n\nA Rest.\n\nFeb. 10\n\nQuiet day’s rest.\n\nFeb. 11\n\nCavalry division under French, we in Broadwood’s the 2nd Brigade, marched to Ramdam in Orange Free State (22). No incident. Bivouaced.\n\nFeb. 12.\n\nMarched cut 2 a.m. Fought successful action, and forced Reit river at Drekels Drift. On picket till 8 p.m. when Infantry relieved us.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nAnother long march without water about 20 miles. Arrived at Modder River. Skirmish with Boers at Farm on way. Captured laager without opposition. Also caught a convoy. Met Alick Houston.\n\nFeb. 14\n\nBoers appeared in the vicinity but we held the Kopjes against them. They shelled the camp for a short time but did no damage.\n\nFeb. 15\n\nInfantry and naval guns arrive. We went on but met Boers in force. Sharp Artillery dual. Cavalry were ordered by French to dash through their position. A mile and a half gallop under fire brought us through with but little loss (23). The Boers retired in front of us. Watered at a Farm (Abbot’s) and continued our march to Kimberley where we arrived at 5 p.m. We went out as far as Beaconsfield and were met by an enthusiastic population. We returned and bivouaced at a farm seven miles out, called Alexandersfontein.\n\nFeb. 16\n\nWe had a well earned rest. Pudden with bad laminitis. Horses about done up.\n\nFeb. 17\n\nTurned out at 4 a.m., no idea where we were going but turned out in for another 25 mile march. My troop 14 strong! Watered at a small farm on the way and arrived at a farm with a lot of water (Camelfontein) (24) at about 1 p.m. Saw Boer laager at drift of Modder about two miles off. Turned out to be Cronje with 5000 Boers from Magersfontein at river beside enormous laager. Did a little fighting with one of two 10 H[Hussars] killed. Occupied outpost line all night. Guns kept up fire all night. Most of us 24 hours without food.\n\nFeb. 18\n\nKelly-Kenny’s and Colville’s divisions turned up on other side of river and a tremendous battle took place which lasted all day (25). We still remained on the same Kopje on which was General French. Tremendous fire at the Boers they stood most gallantly. I don’t know if the attack was pushed home, as it was hard to make out from the Kopje, but at all events we did not take the laager then. All this time we have been without our transport, and our emergency rations are coming to an end. It is rumoured Teck is captured. Cockey has not come on and Pudden broken down, so am riding D.66.\n\nFeb. 19\n\nWe bivouaced at Camelfontein farm and are waiting for Gordon’s Brigade. Rest of our Brigade have crossed river. Did nothing. Went out in the afternoon with guns but returned soon, Teck and transport turned up. No servants or second horses.\n\nFeb. 20\n\nMoved to Koodoosrand Drift with Batteries.\n\nFeb. 21\n\nWent out with guns to take Kopje evacuated by Kenny first day. Came under fire several times. Were attacked in the open by about 100 Boers in line. But we dismounted in time and drove them back and advanced to Kopje. 10th [Hussars] and 12th [Lancers] coming up on our left.\n\nFeb. 22\n\nRest day. Heavy rain.\n\nFeb. 23\n\nCrossed to other side of river as rain has been falling heavily and river is rising. My troop 14 strong. Watered at a small farm on the way and arrived at farm with a lot of water (Camelfontein) at about 1 p.m. Saw Boer laager at. Drift of Modder about two miles off. Turned out to be Cronje with 5000 Boers from Lugersfontein at river besides enormous laager. Did a little fighting one or two 10th [Hussars] killed. Occupied outpost line all night. Guns kept up fire all night. Most of us 24 hours without food.\n\nFeb. 24\n\nMuch rain last night. Went out with Taffy to find potatoes. Let in for six mile walk in enemy’s country.\n\nFeb. 25\n\nHeavy rain all night, very uncomfortable. Squadron ordered to occupy advanced farm called Bankdrift – rather nice farm, owner, Jacobs, at present I suppose with Boers. Old mad woman only inhabitant. Two night alarms disturbed our rest but turned out nothing.\n\nFeb. 26\n\nOut on early morning patrol went as close as possible to Big Kopje and watched Boers for some time, till they came out and fired at us, when I returned, and later whole squadron, to camp.\n\nFeb. 27\n\nHeard of Cronje’s surrender [at Paaredeburg], so we’ve scored off De Wet.\n\nFeb. 28\n\nQuiet day for all.\n\nMarch 1\n\nQuiet day. Heard of Ladysmith’s relief (26).\n\nMarch 2\n\nQuiet day. Health of men not improving, only on quarter rations, and horses on 8 lbs. forage. They are looking awful, and although more forage has been issued I doubt their ever being able to pick up now.\n\nMarch 3\n\nVisited laager, a horrid sight, innumerable dead horses and upset wagons. Trenches most interesting. The Boers also dug caves in which they had lived for ten days completely sheltered from rifle and shell fire. A very curious sight.\n\nMarch 4\n\nSunday. Service at 6.30 a.m. Rain.\n\nMarch 5\n\nAwful night, soaking wet twice, not much sleep, and very uncomfy. Lovely lightening. Rainy season has come on with a vengeance.\n\nMarch 6\n\nChanged camp to Osfontein. Self riding Indian country bred about 14.1 [i.e. hands].\n\nMarch 7\n\nStarted at 3 a.m. marched South to outflank left of Boer position. Came under Boer Shell fire, so made wider circle. On seeing us turn their flank the Boers commenced to retire. We remained with guns while 2nd [Life Guards] and Blues went up a Kopje. Came under heavy fire – De Crespigny badly wounded. A very heavy rifle fire was kept up between M.I. [Mounted Infantry] and Boers who eventually retired when our guns came into action. Two Blues Troopers, one killed, one badly wounded. Boer Shells kept falling short though every now and then one burst in the air sending a few spent bullets amongst us. After a bit we continued the advance and halted about 2 miles beyond Poplar Grove on the Modder, The Infantry came up and pushed forward and occupied line of outposts (27).\n\nMarch 8\n\nQuiet day for us. 1st Brigade went on to Abraham’s Kraal (28). It is said on excellent authority, that Stein and Kruger were with the Boers yesterday,\n\nMarch 9\n\nSelf bad rheumatism. Did not move.\n\nMarch 10\n\nWent on to Dreifontein (self on Cockey) Fought a long wearisome action in which one Boer gun seriously annoyed 12 of ours, eventually retiring. (29) Advanced six miles beyond Dreifontein and bivouaced with battery.\n\nMarch 11\n\nStarted early and advanced without opposition to Aasvogel Kop (30) where we bivouaced. Self sent with troop to Kopje 5 miles in advance. A nigger came in with white flag, otherwise uneventful. Home at night fall. Rheumatism very bad.\n\nMarch 12\n\nAdvanced 14 miles to a place called Ventres Volaille (31) where we expected to stop, but found we were to go on another 12 to the railway. Got there in pitch darkness. 1st Brigade exchanging shots with Boer Pom Pom.\n\nMarch 13\n\nCaught Stein’s brother at whose farm we bivouaced, Started at daybreak and crossed railway and much to my surprise saw Bloemfontein in front of us on rounding a Kopje. Boer Pom Pom opened fire but chucked it after a bit and retired. We surrounded the town mighty cautious­ly only to be hailed by the English Colony to be told it was deserted. It was handed over and the Union Jack hoisted, I believe at 10.30 a.m. (32) We were kept in the blazing sun with no shade until 4 p.m. when we were ordered off to occupy a Kopje 5 miles off. The weather looked very threatening and I began to fear for my rheumatism but in the end was taken into a farm called Springfield (33), given a lovely room and a most comfortable, bed and everything one could want. The owner an Irishman, P. Lynch, an old man, very charming and interesting to talk to. All his family are here. Four sons came in from fighting us this morning, having chucked it as useless, as I believe, have most of the Freestaters. The whole lot do their level best to make me comfortable and succeed.\n\nMarch 14\n\nSpent a wretched night, but Poppet has taken away the worst of the pain. Am much better in fact but still in bed, as my temperature is over 100. I can hardly stand, and walk with the greatest difficulty. In fact this has been so from Poplar Grove, four men having to help me on my horse, a process which Cockey strongly resented. But he has carried me beautifully all the time.\n\nMarch 15 – 29\n\nAll these days I have been practically well again, and have returned on full ration. News from our fellows at Tibanchu is rather disgusting (34).\n\nMarch 30\n\nNews worse. Hear they are retreating. In evening wire was cut between us and them. Carried news to Bloemfontein. Are feeling uneasy for far own safety.\n\nMarch 31\n\nOut early and manned Springfield Kopje with 50 10th H [Hussars] and 23 of our own men. Salkeld, 10th H [Hussars] took all available mounted men as escort to Field Battery. Colville with division march out to Bushman’s Kopje (35) and Gordon with 3rd Brigade in afternoon. Colville spoilt the whole thing. Have lost 7 guns and convoy (36). They say Broadwood was splendid, and all troops behaved well especially the M.I. [Mounted Infantry] Our loss is I believe, Meade wounded. Regiment returned to Springfield in evening.\n\nApril 1\n\nRegt. out again but did nothing. Self into Church & Bloemfontein. Have left Springfield quarters with many regrets.\n\nApril 2\n\nManned Kopje again but nothing happened. Regt. returned.\n\nApril 3\n\nMoved camp towards Bloemspruit37, night alarm false as usual.\n\nApril 4\n\nMoved again to place selected by Fatheaded Phil. George, Clay and Reg Ward went to Cape Town. Col. Calley and Sudley came out.\n\nApril 5\n\nWent into Bloernfontein with sick horses. Rain came on very soon. Returned to camp, road turned river and drift very deep; it was dry when we crossed in the morning. Found Jerry in tent (tents arrived last night, first night in tents for eight weeks) standing in 3 inches of water. Shifted things with tent up hill and pitched it with great difficulty in the dark. Still raining.\n\nApril 6\n\nPitched tent properly, and dug huge trench round. More rain.\n\nApril 7\n\nHeard of Villbois’ death and Methuen’s disaster and 500 M.I. captured at Springfontein.\n\nApril 8\n\nRode into Bloemfontein for Church. Stayed Communion. Very nice service.\n\nApril 9\n\nOut on picket. Went to wrong place, and got damned for it. No alarm.\n\nApril 10\n\nGave a dinner party as our mess stores have arrived. Could not appreciate Pop and Port, suppose our palates want retraining.\n\nApril 11\n\nWent in morning to Bloemfontein to bring out remounts. Got 27 awful rotters some in worse condition than our old black’uns.\n\nApril 12\n\nFlying squadron. Went to Bloemfontein.\n\nApril 13\n\nOn picket. Awful night, rain whole time. Drove into Bloemfontein. Taffy nearly upset in Drift homeward journey.\n\nApril 14\n\nMore rain.\n\nApril 15\n\nHeard of poor Monkey Peel’s and Peeking 10th H[ussar]s. deaths. Went to funeral in afternoon. Dead March and Last Post, most melancholy.\n\nApril 17-18\n\nNothing.\n\nApril 19\n\nSam Surtees came up with details.\n\nApril 21\n\nOrderly had bad fall off Pudden.\n\nApril 22\n\nWent into Service at Bloemfontein.\n\nApril 23\n\nOn picket at Kaffer Kraal. 12th [Lancers] Officers tried to warn me as to near presence of Boers, but they turned out to be Colonials. Rode fat little pony instead of Pudden who must be left behind here, too weak to go on.\n\nApril 24\n\nOrdered to stand to and turn out for Waterworksway (38). 16th [Lancers?] and 12th [Lancers] have been at Denke Hoek, we go tomorrow. Nothing: happened. Satisfactory accounts of fighting at Waterworks.\n\nApril 26\n\nInspected by Lord Roberts.\n\nApril 29\n\nStarted at 4 p.m. and marched about 10 miles to a place N.E. of Bloemfontein.\n\nApril 30\n\nStarted at daybreak to co-operate with General Maxwell’s Infantry. We had to take a position so as to let Infantry come up to it. At first all went swimmingly, and Boers retired; then we came under a long range fire, and Bill Kensington was badly wounded, two of our men, and one of the 2nd [Life Guards]. After this the Boers shelled us with a Pom Pom and Long Tom with great accuracy but little destruction. We had to retire before the shell fire, but the 10th [Hussars] got round, their flank and got into them with a Maxim. We supported them, and on the way caught 10 prisoners and their headquarters wagon. Beef Marjoribanks executed the capture, and is rewarded by being allowed to keep the Transvaal German Commandos flag worked by German ladies in Pretoria and presented to them. Bivouaced on the battle field.\n\nMay 1\n\nOff before daybreak. Back to pick up our baggage at Kaalfontein (39). Found it all safe, also infantry with 4.7 cow-guns. Turned out almost immediately and made a quick march towards Thebanchu where French had been stopped. Arrived Houtnek and took up position along a ridge whence we saw the Boer Laagar and about 2 or 3 thousand Boers in the middle of the plain. French was shelling them in some Kopjes on the right. We watched each other for some hours, and then the Boers threw out a flank guard towards us and commenced retiring. I was sent round the left with my troop to see if I could poop at them at all. I got within about 1500 yards and let them have it. They hooked it at once, and then George Milner turned up with a section of guns under a somewhat timid subaltern. They were too late, and I am afraid did little good. Bivouaced close to water in rear of position.\n\nMay 2\n\nOut on picket early, reconnoitred a farm called “Rast und Friede”! (40) Boers are sitting opposite on next ridge.\n\nMay 3\n\nStarted, at 6 a.m.; marched. N., self with troop rearguard of baggage (41). A little sniping from Boers. No harm done. arrived at destination at 3 p.m. Told to return to bivouac and draw forage and rations. Came up behind and caught up the Brigade while under shell fire from Boers on the right. They had taken up a very strong position, Houtnek Farm (42). They had guns and Pom Poms and the shelling was unpleasant. The front of the position was strongly held, and we were ordered to take it. The Blues executed a splendid movement and took the Kopje where they remained under considerable fire. The 12th [Lancers] sent up their Maxims which did first rate execution. Two Blues were wounded, Lieut. Enoch Rose was killed, and Charles Wyndham who was doing duty with the 3rd Squadron was wounded in the head. We all moved up, and after a few more shells the Boers retired. The Infantry came up and occupied our Kopje, and we went on doing advance guard. We came under a lot of fire from the right and the bullets [flew past us?] as we went. We bivouaced two miles further on.\n\nMay 5\n\nEntered Winburg unopposed.\n\nMay 7\n\nA rest day.\n\nMay 8\n\nStarted at 7 a.m. and marched without event about 12 miles to Bloemplaats (43) where we bivouacked. Sent or picket with my troop. Saw a lot of Boers shelling on the right. Tuckers division about 7 miles on the left. We are 4 miles from Zand river where the Boers are supposed to be entrenched.\n\nMay 10\n\nOur cow-guns commenced shelling early and soon silenced the Pom Pom. Infantry attacked the Boers in a very strong position and cleared them out. The M.I and us went over the river, and passed the Infantry coming under shell fire from a Kopje to the right. We went righthanded and turned the Kopje, and then waited till almost dusk when a convoy was seen trekking away E. We tried a fruitless pursuit which did nothing but tire our horses still more. Bivouaced on hillside where we stopped pursuing. The Boers shelled us as we pur­sued but were evidently jumpy as the shells went everywhere but in the right direction. M.I. took 15 prisoners and people on the left of us took a couple of wagons. 2nd [Life Guards] sent to occupy Ventresburg (44).\n\nMay 11\n\nFound convoy of last night trekked right away, so whole force have returned to bivouac at Ventresburg, a town about as big as a small English village. At 2.50 marched again about 8 miles winding about considerably as the maps are extremely inaccurate about here, but eventually arrived and bivouaced at Bleuegum Spruit.\n\nMay 12\n\nStarted early, our squadron advance guard. Caught up Tucker’s division as it crossed our road and saw various other columns all converging on Kroonstadt. When we got to the top of Kroonstadt Kopje we found evidences of a battle and precipitate flight. Trenches had been dug all along, and the position was very strong, but our 12-1b. shells were lying all about, and had evidently done considerable damage as shown by the marks on the trees. All the Boer entrenching implements were lying where they had been thrown and we annexed them. It turned out that French had taken them on their left flank and driven them back and taken Kroonstadt (45), so we were saved what would have been a very nasty action. Bivouaced at Kroonstadt and hope to regain a week or so to recruit. Cockey broken down at last.\n\nMay 13\n\nChurch parade for the division; very hot day.\n\nMay 14\n\nInspected by Broadwood in morning, later by Roberts. Went into Kroonstadt in afternoon. Not much of a place; all shops closed as everything is commandeered by A.S.C. [Army Service Corps]\n\nMay 15\n\nStarted at 7.30 a.m. and marched East about 6 or 8 miles to Meriba where we bivouaced.\n\nMay 16\n\nMarched a long way, about 25 miles, to Kalfontein Bridge over the Zud Valsck river. (46) Taffy and I occupied the farm at the Bridge; a very cold night.\n\nMay 17\n\nMarched on about 17 miles and got to Lindley (47). Boers fired a few shots to cover the retreat of their wagons. Three casualties; one 2nd [Life Guards] man wounded. De Wet is supposed to be somewhere near.\n\nMay 18\n\nDe Wet has not appeared, and we are going to remain here. The Infantry and transport ought to get here today.\n\nMay 19\n\nWent into Lindley; had a good lunch at the Clarendon Hotel; bought some snuff. Sniping going on all round.\n\nMay 20\n\nAdvanced North. Met Boers about three miles out of Lindley, and came under shell fire. Opened with our Pom Pom and 12 pounders, and Boers retired. They attacked the rear of the column in force, and took a great many prisoners. Advanced again, and bivouaced at Vetchkop Rietfontein (48).\n\nMay 21\n\nStarted at 7 a.m. North. A long halt about 10 a.m. at a farm, and eventually bivouaced about 4 miles South of Heilbron (49).\n\nMay 22\n\nAdvanced towards Heilbron; us advanced regiment. Were soon under shell and rifle fire. Advanced and drove Boers in front of us, helped by two Maxims. Saw convoy as usual pursued it fighting Boers all the way, and eventually caught 14 wagons about 5 miles beyond Heilbron, a most exciting chase, no casualties. Returned and bivouaced close to town.\n\nMay 23\n\nMarched West towards Prospect. Bivouaced at Uitkijk (50).\n\nMay 24\n\nStarted at 6 a.m. and marched West. We were left flank guard, and soon came in touch with Roberts’ right flank guard crossing our front. We were then drawn in and the columns turned North, and we marched about 8 miles more and stopped at Arcadia (51) where we bivouaced.\n\nGod save the Queen.\n\nMay 25\n\nMarched to Vaal River and bivouaced at Boschbank (52) about ½ mile Free State side.\n\nMay 26\n\nStarted 6 a.m. Had a long wait and then crossed Vaal River into the Transvaal. Halted on banks of river.\n\nMay 27\n\nMoved about 10 miles North and bivouaced.\n\nMay 2853\n\nAdvanced against Klip Rivers Berg (54) position, which consists of several ranges of mountains about 8 miles long just in front of Johannesburg. Taffy and I were sent to a Kopje about 5 miles to the right; we could see Roberts’ farm and the Railway. Heard, a great deal of firing from French on the left. Caught four Boers’ ponies saddled with blankets and bread. Back to bivouac, long ride in the dark.\n\nMay 29\n\nStarted at 6.30 a.m. and moved West. Boers still in Klip Rivers Berg position. Pom Poms and guns have started at French; we have not yet come into action 10 a.m. Came under shell fire late in the evening, but Boers retired. Bivouaced at Dornkop where Jameson chucked it (55).\n\nMay 30\n\nStarted at 6 a.m. Wandered in and out of all the mines till 11 a. m. when we halted and fed. No signs of Boers at present. Bivouaced here, place called Florida (56) a suburb of Johannesburg about 5 miles west amongst the Boodepoort Mines. Johannes­burg surrendered to Lord Roberts.\n\nMay 31\n\nStood to in the morning. Nothing happened.\n\nJune 1\n\nSent out as officers patrol with Hamilton’s staff officer to select camp. All moved to Orange Grove 4 miles North of Johannesburg in afternoon (57).\n\nJune 2\n\nWent into Johannesburg in morning. Sam Surtees stood us excellent lunch at Frascati’s in honour of anniversary of his wedding day. Some use in married subs after all.\n\nJune 3\n\nStarted at 6.30 a.m. and marched about 15 miles along the Pretoria road and bivouaced at Deep sloop? [sic] (58). As we arrived about three in the afternoon, French to our left was engaged with the Dutch, result at present uncertain.\n\nJune 4\n\nMarched west to follow French round the position, but were stopped. Turned back and told Pretoria had surrendered. This was hardly the case as a big battle ensued. We however on arriving at the position did not come into action, but bivouaced eventually in a pretty place Mooiplaats (59). E. all surrounded by hills, the Boers having retired.\n\nJune 5\n\nStarted at 6 and advanced through the defile where the tenth [Hussars] were last night, Turned right-handed and marched East towards Pretoria. At 12 a.m. we were told to bivouac about a mile from the town which had given in etc. However, just as we had off-saddled an order came for us to go on, which we are at this moment preparing to do, whither remains to be seen. We made an entry into the town, self with troop advance guard. Passed Market Square just as Union Jack was hoisted (60). We however hurried on still as advance guard, and bivouaced eventually at Derdepoort 8 miles N.E. of Pretoria (61).\n\nJune 6\n\nOn picket on top of high hill. Watched French fighting at Waterfall (62) where most of our prisoners are. Marched at 2 p.m. to Trenes Station on the main line, crossing the Delagoa line east of town, arrived in Bivouac at 9 p.m., a beastly march.\n\nJune 7\n\nA rest day. Visited Irene Garden (63), lovely violet beds and fir trees. Very pretty, reminded us of home.\n\nJune 8\n\nMarched to Zwavelpoort (64) about 10 miles, went on patrol to see if ridge opposite was occupied. Had a long way to go, about 8 miles. Found Boers at a Kopje and retired under heavy fire. Hunt was shot through the head.\n\nJune 9\n\nA rest day (conference fallen through) Old Colonel Kelly (Australians’ doctor attached to us now Fawcett is dead) went to see if anything could be done for Hunt. Found him dead. Boers allowed him to bring him back and we buried him this afternoon.\n\nJune 10\n\nOn picket North of bivouac. Saw a lot of Dutch. Nothing happened.\n\nJune 11\n\nStarted at 6 a.m. marched about 5 miles East. Met the Boers in great strength (65). They shelled us from the left and we came under rifle fire from the right. The 10th [Hussars] dismounted on a Kopje and replied to the Dutch on the right and we all pushed on with the guns who unlimbered and answered the Boers’ guns. The Boers then advanced in great numbers from the front and right, so Broadwood ordered the l2th [Lancers] to charge those in front and us to charge those or the right, we drew swords and galloped at them hurrooshing like the devil, and they soon made off. We pursued them about a mile and turned them out of a Kaffir Kraal, which we then occupied. Blues on some little Kopjes on the right were reinforced by the 2nd [Life Guards] who came up later, and we by 60 M.I. Buffs. The Blues and 2nd [Life Guards] were soon compelled to retire as the Boers were again advancing and their led horses were not under cover, so we remained alone with the M.I. till night under very heavy rifle fire, and a Pom Pom and Long Tom shelling all the time. A section of guns supported us from behind somewhere. We remained all night in the Kraal, M.I.s going away, and moved next morning back to bivouac.\n\nJune 12\n\nInfantry had a big battle at big position on the left, and as far as we made out were successful.
