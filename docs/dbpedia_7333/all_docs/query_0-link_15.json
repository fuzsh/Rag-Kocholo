        "text": "It this time of year again, starting today and a bit about the father of the tournament, Doc Danie Craven by Paul Dobson from Rugby365\n\nCraven of Craven Week\n\nAt the 1995 World Cup's opening match at Newlands a group stood with a placard which read: Ons dink aan jou, Dok. As we get to Craven Week again in 2010 it is good for us to recall who the Craven of Craven Week was.\n\nSome names of people and places - proper nouns in the days when people did grammar - have become common nouns in the language, losing the capital letter to start th word - sandwich, cardigan, meander, boycott, lynch, rugby, as examples. Other people have their names attached to activities in such a way that we forget that they were people - as in Currie Cup, Bledisloe Cup and Ranfurly Shield, where Sir Donald Currie, Lord Bledisloe and Lord Ranfurly were all people. So, too, the Craven of Craven Week was a man, a great man.\n\nNobody has made a contribution to rugby of such variety and intensity as Danie Craven did - and nobody will, not with the changed workings of professional rugby.\n\nCraven played for and captained the Springboks when they were at their best, the masters of the rugby world in the Thirties. Not only did he play but he did so in several positions. In Tests he played at centre, flyhalf, scrumhalf and eighthman. In a tour match he also played fullback.\n\nHe played for South Africa first at the age of 20, before he had played provincial rugby, and he was in competition with the great Pierre de Villiers for the scrumhalf berth. His career lasted from 1931 to 1938. In modern time such a career would have earned him many, many caps.\n\nHe became a national selector. He managed and coached the Springboks. He became the president of the South African rugby Board in 1956 and was the executive president of SARFU when he died in 1993, in an unbroken presidency. He was a member of the International Rugby Board during that time and on occasion its chairman.\n\nIn 1988, when the ANC was still a banned organisation in South Africa, he met with the exiled African National Congress in Harare, Zimbabwe, thus incurring the wrath of PW Botha's apartheid government. Rugby thus started on the path of politically acceptable unity before any other sport in the country, for cricket and athletics did not pitch up for the meeting. But then for the last 12 or so years of his life he went about South Africa preaching the gospel of racially mixed sport. \"We can change South Africa on the rugby field,\" he said. He was a passionate rugby man and a passionate South African.\n\nCraven's grandfather was a Yorkshireman on his way to Durban to catch a ship to return to England when he stopped at farm near the small town of Lindley in the Eastern Orange Free State. He fell in love, stayed and never returned to Yorkshire. Danie Craven's father fought against the British in the Anglo-Boer War when his mother was interred in one of Britain's notorious concentration camps.\n\nFrom Lindley Craven went to Stellenbosch University and its influential rugby mentor, Oubaas Markötter. Craven's regard for \"Mr Mark\" never diminished, nor did his love for Stellenbosch where he died and is buried. If Stellenbosch was all right, South Africa was all right.\n\nMarkötter had a powerful influence on South African rugby. He took one look at Craven at a practice in 1929 and said: \"I'm keeping this one for South Africa.\" Craven was primarily a scrumhalf, not, as is often believed, the inventor of the dive pass though he developed it.\n\nCraven then went on the 1931-32 Springbok tour and played in three of the four tests. He did not miss another test after that till he retired at the end of 1938, after playing in 16 tests, a huge number for the time. He was captain in four of those.\n\nThe 1931-32 Springboks won all four of their tests. In 1933 the Wallabies played five tests in South Africa. The Springboks won the series. Then came 1937. The Springboks won the two tests in Australia and then set off for New Zealand and serious business.\n\nSpringboks and All Blacks had met in two series before - drawn in 1921 and drawn in 1928. The All Blacks had never lost a series at home. The Springboks had not lost a series since 1896. This series was billed as a world-title contest.\n\nIn those days the players ran the team. Vice-captain Craven was one of the five leaders - along with captain Philip Nel, Gerry Brand, Lucas Strachan and Boy Louw. They dropped Nel for the first test and Craven captained the team at flyhalf.\n\nIt was a poor decision. Craven played poorly and the All Blacks won 13-7. Craven went back to scrumhalf, Nel went back to lock and the Springboks won the second test 13-6, which left all to play for in the third test. The Springboks were magnificent at Eden Park, scoring five tries to nil to win 17-6.\n\nCraven was named one of the five players of the year in New Zealand and the team was often referred to by New Zealanders, not altogether jocously, as the best team ever to leave New Zealand.\n\nThe series against the Lions followed in 1938 and then war broke put in which Craven had the rank of Lt-Colonel.\n\nCraven coached the Springboks to their 4-0 series win over the All Blacks in 1949, then the 1951-52 Springboks on their victorious tour of Europe, then in the victorious series against the Wallabies in 1953 and the drawn series against the Lions in 1955.\n\nThen came the tour of 1956, Craven's last as a team manager and coach. The All Blacks led 2-1 going into the final test. The sides scored a try each but the boot of the late Don Clarke was telling and the All Blacks won 11-9.\n\nHeart sore Craven addressed the Eden Park crowd over the round, standing mike and said: \"It's all yours, New Zealand.\"\n\nCraven had by then been elected president of the SA Rugby Board. His 37 years in office became increasingly difficult as politics became a bigger and bigger issue. First South Africa became a republic and left the Commonwealth. Then the nations of the world found apartheid increasingly abhorrent and boycotts bit into rugby. That the Springboks played at all from the late Sixties on was probably due in the main to the personality and efforts of Danie Craven.\n\nIn the midst of it all he managed to earn three doctorates - in social anthropology, psychology and physical education - and have an honorary one bestowed on him. He attempted a rewrite of the laws along with Hermas Evans of Wales and Harry McKibben of Ireland. He wrote numerous books on rugby - on coaching, history and biography. And he did not stop coaching Stellenbosch University till he was 80 years of age.\n\nHe was a giant of a man.\n\nFact File\n\nFull name: Daniel Hartman Craven\n\nBorn: Lindley, 11 October 1910\n\nOccupation: schoolmaster, soldier, university professor\n\nDied: Stellenbosch, 4 January 1993\n\nClubs: Stellenbosch, Albany (Grahamstown), Garrison (Pretoria)\n\nProvinces: Western Province, Eastern Province, Northern Transvaal\n\nInternational career: 1931-38, 16 tests, 38 matches in all\n\nand his message on the first one back in 1964\n\nAlthough each team will play a few matches, the South African Rugby Board has decided to allow no competition or distinction amongst players. In other words no national team will be chosen and as a result the only distinction which will exist will depend on whether a team wins of loses. Some people are opposed to this decision. Because it is the first occasion that such a gathering takes place, there are more important things than championship at stake. For example the boys must 'find' each other, develop equally, make friends, get away from provincialism, learn from others, enter a wider world, get rid of tension which at times runs too high, and enjoy the game without regard to the result or position in a championship. In other words the Board wants the game played in the right spirit. That includes: attacking, adventurous, open, constructive rugby, without regard to the result, and without deviating from the game. If our schoolboys can be imbued with such a spirit, it will seep through to our national approach, to the advantage of all.\n\nMy message to all players is: run with the ball, choose attack before defence, throw the ball around when it should be thrown around and play correct rather than winning rugby, because correct rugby will promote the game and the players who play it. And remember that good behaviour is the mark of a good and honest sportsman.\n\nHistory\n\nCraven Week, the greatest schoolboy rugby tournament in the world, seems to have been around forever. But like all living things, it had a birth.\n\nIt was a healthy birth but not universally welcomed. There were those who thought it a bad idea. Schools and schoolmasters are conservative, which is a natural reaction to the constantly changing world in which schools exist.\n\nSome did not like the singling out of individuals. Some thought it was against the educational spirit of school sport. Some thought it smacked of professionalism. But it went ahead in 1964. The initial idea came from Piet Malan, then 1949 Springbok flank, currently the oldest living Springbok. After all the 75th anniversary of the South African Rugby Board was due and, in Potgietersrus, Malan asked Danie Craven how schools in South Africa could figure in the celebrations. Craven's Board decided to get the 15 schools unions together for a week. The man who picked up the idea and ran with it, on and one for many years, was Jan Preuyt, an East London schoolmaster, once a missionary in Nigeria.\n\nAt the time Jan Preuyt, an ex-Matie and a former Griqualand West player, was a teacher at Port Rex Technical School and chairman of Border Schools with Dummy Taylor of Queen's College as the secretary. There was no such thing as a South African Schools organisation and the SA Rugby Board was not involved. Border Schools did it all. East London then put on the first-ever Craven Week in July 1964. For many provinces it was a novelty to choose a provincial team. Western Province solved the problem by inviting its long-standing schools to nominate players and from that a team was cobbled together which did remarkably well, better in fact than some \"expertly\" chosen teams.\n\nThe teams taking part in the first Craven Week were Boland, Border, Eastern Province, Eastern Transvaal, Griqualand West, Natal, North Eastern Cape, Northern Transvaal, Orange Free State, Rhodesia, South West Africa, South Western Districts, Transvaal, Western Province and Western Transvaal. By 1987 there were 28 teams taking part at Craven Week. In 2000 there were be 32 teams.\n\nIn 2001 the format changed again and only 20 teams took part - the 14 provinces plus Namibia and Zimbabwe and four regional teams - Eastern Coast, Western Coast, Central and Northern. That did not last long.\n\nThis year things have not changed. There will be 20 teams - one from each province plus Limpopo, Border Country Districts, Griquas Country Districts, Eastern Province Country Districts, Namibia and Zimbabwe. The area most obviously left out is Northern Natal which includes Newcastle, Ladysmith, Dundee, Glencoe, Estcourt and Vryheid.\n\nAt that Craven Week the first SA Schools committee was chosen - Jan Preuyt (chairman), Trens Erasmus (Western Transvaal), Wouter du Toit (Transvaal), Hennie Lochner (Boland) and Meyer Sauerman (Eastern Province). In 1965 Craven Week was again held in East London, to consolidate the new foundation which very soon developed its own spirit and modus operandi. In 1974, for the first time ever, a national schools team was chosen. This was against Danie Craven's will as he wanted Craven Week to be a festival, not a competition and certainly not trials. That is why, when Australian Schools undertook their first tour in 1969, no South African Schools team was chosen.\n\nSince 1974 a South African schools team has been chosen each year. Forget all the non-competitive stuff. There is no official winner but there is no doubt that the last match on the last day is seen as a final and the winner of that match as the Craven Week champions. Moreover, while good behaviour is a hallmark of Craven Week, there have been repeated outbursts of bad sportsmanship, mainly as a result of provincialism.\n\nApart from selecting national teams, Craven Weeks have been a great hunting ground for talent scouts. Many provinces go to elaborate lengths to choose their Craven Week sides and generally it is a week where kudos reigns.\n\nThe next big change came in 1980 when Danie Craven forced the Craven Week organisers to open the week to all races. That was the last year in which Rhodesia participated. South West Africa would also cease to participate when the country became Namibia.\n\nThe next big change for all rugby in South Africa came about in 1992 with the fusion of the national bodies.\n\nRight from the 1964 start there were changes in the teams attending Craven Week. The number of teams increased as new provinces were created and with the entry of teams which had been excluded for political reasons. Each year since 1980 there has been an effort to give more players a chance to take part in Craven Week. In 1996 the quota system was introduced.\n\nIn 1987 the old SA Rugby Board introduced a Project Tournament, which by 1991 had 16 teams taking part, all based on a quota system that was at least 50-50. In 1987 the Project Tournament's selected team went on to play at Craven Week. In that team were Justin Swart, who later became a Springbok, Etienne Finn, who became a Springbok in 2001, and Louis Mzomba who became an international referee, the first Xhosa-speaker to do so. This system was more or less adopted by SARFU/SARU as the Academy Week.\n\nFor many years two teams were chosen at the end of the Craven Week - the SA Schools XV and the SA Nampak XV, which team was chosen from the Academy Week and played against SA Schools, has been replaced by the SA Academy XV. Often they played each other. In 2006 things changed. The Academy team became the South African Schools B team and played - and beat - Italy.\n\nIn 1988, after 19 years in charge, Jan Preuyt declared himself unavailable for re-election as chairman of SA Schools. His place was taken by Louis Terblanche of Western Province. In 1996 Terblanche was unavailable for re-election and was succeeded by Christo Bekker of Northern Transvaal.\n\nLater Craven Week came to fall under the United Schools Sport Association of South Africa (USSASA) under the chairmanship of Dries van Heerden of HTS Vereeniging. He was succeeded by the present chairman, Lindsay Mould, the principal of Grey Primary School in Bloemfontein, the first to chair both High Schools and Junior Schools rugby.\n\nOn 27 April 2006 Jan Preuyt died at his daughter’s house in Cathcart on 27 April 2006 He was 83 years of age, survived by his wife, Johlene, six children and nine grandchildren. His ashes were scattered at Absa Stadium, the Border Rugby Union's headquarters in East London. The Absa Stadium was once the Border Rugby Union Ground, then the Basil Kenyon Stadium and now the Buffalo City Stadium. It had sponsors' names (Waverley and Absa) twice.\n\nIn 2010 Piet Malan, whose brainchild the Craven Week is, is the oldest living Springbok. He turned 91 on 13 February."
