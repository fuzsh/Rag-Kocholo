        "text": "Most governments and international agencies have committed themselves to achievement of Millennium Development Goals. The government of Uganda has stretched its target to achieve 100% safe water supply and Sanitation by 2015. Achievement of this target will only be possible if service providers make deliberate strategies and action is taken now to provide sustainable services to all mankind, the poor inclusive. This paper highlights the Ugandan experience in the provision of Water and Sanitation to the urban poor by the National Water and Sewerage Corporation in Jinja-Njeru Water and Sanitation area. It highlights service strategies, challenges, change management and lessons learned."
