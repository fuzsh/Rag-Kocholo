Annual derbies between the pair started in 1988, while they became full Interschools competitors in 1992. Since 1967 Grey and Paul Roos have met 31 times, with Grey winning 23 times.\n\nThere is a special connection and bond between Grey and Paul Roos:\n\nBoth schools are amongst the oldest in SA with legendary founders.\n\nBoth schools have produced more Springboks than any other school in SA – Paul Roos 51 and Grey 42.\n\nBoth schools have strong traditions and even stronger Old Boy networks.\n\nMany legendary old Grey Springboks (and many other old Greys) that now live in the Cape are sending their sons to Paul Roos, including Theuns Stofberg (old Grey Springbok), Robbie Blair (old Grey Springbok), Frikkie Naude (WP), Chris Smith (WP).\n\nResults down the years\n\nYear Grey PR 1967 22 3 1974 24 0 1977 20 10 1988 16 9 1989 28 7 1990 17 9 1991 3 20 1992 20 6 1993 8 28 1994 29 31 1995 21 10 1996 18 10 1997 8 12 1998 23 15 1999 20 26 2000 42 13 2001 15 6 2002 19 8 2003 18 17 2004 24 23 2004 18 21 2005 16 11 2006 11 16 2007 40 14 2008 47 15 2009 3 9 2010 41 29 2011 36 35 2012 33 23 2013 40 8 2014 25 20\n\nHighlights Down The Years\n\n1967\n\nGrey and Paul Roos first met in 1967 at the old Coetzenberg Stadium when Grey went on tour to the Cape during the July holidays.\n\nThe legendary ’67 Grey College first team is regarded by many as one of the greatest Grey sides of its era. The team was gifted with outstanding athletes such as the two prop forwards and the two flank forwards (twins Danie and Dennis du Plessis) that formed the Grey relay team which won the 4×100 metres relay at Free State Interhigh athletics that year.\n\nDawie Snyman was flyhalf and vice-captain, while Wilhelm Landman was Grey’s fullback that year. Grey won the historic encounter 22-0 and one of the highlights was a try scored by the referee – Oom Johnnie Meiring from the Matie Club.\n\nOne of Grey’s centers went through a gap and with only the Paul Roos fullback in front of him he passed inside. The man on his inside was Oom Johnnie who caught the ball and then raced towards the tryline to ‘score’ right under the posts.\n\nThe cameraderie between the teams resulted in numerous friendships. In the Paul Roos 1967 team was Johan Carinus and among their matrics of that year was business tycoon Johann Rupert and Braam van Velde. All three Paul Roos old boys became firm friends with the Grey fullback, Wilhelm Landman, and later in life Rupert played a big role in Landman’s career when Landman became the MD of Richmont South Africa. Today Dawie Snyman (who later became a Springbok) is the assistant coach of the Paul Roos first team. All these seeds were planted during the first Grey v Paul Roos match in 1967 in Stellenbosch.\n\n1974\n\nPaul Roos went on tour to the Free State and their first game was against Sentraal. SA Schools captain George Rautenbach’s ear was stepped on by a Tralie player, resulting in him missing the Grey match with a hole in his ear. The Paul Roos team had three Western Province Craven Week players: Rautenbach, Agie Koch and Jan (Gans) Coetzee. Agie was then chosen as captain against Grey.\n\nThe majority of the Grey team played for Free State Schools that year and Jan Geldenhuys and Gerhard Weitz were selected for SA Schools. Grey had a strong pack of forwards but was equally matched by Paul Roos with their stalwart WP Craven Week lock Coetzee. Grey won 22-3 and ten days later 14 of the Grey team were selected for Free State Craven Week.\n\nSeveral of the Paul Roos team played for WP Craven Week and this time Rautenbach was fit to play with special protection covering his ear. He became the SA Schools captain later that year that toured overseas along with Geldenhuys. They became team-mates in subsequent years at Maties in Stellenbosch.\n\nRautenbach also founded MEGAPRO in 1986 – South Africa’s first sports marketing agency. Today he is not only the face of MEGAPRO but arguably the face of sports marketing in South Africa.\n\n1977\n\nGrey played Paul Roos on tour in the Cape after Craven Week. The match was a mud bath and given all the rain in the lead up, the venue was switched to Coetzenberg B field. Despite the heavy pitch Grey scored four tries and beat Paul Roos 20-10. This Grey first team had four SA Schools players: Jan Richter, Jacques Nell, Abrie Marais, and Willem Daffue.\n\nSA Schools\n\nGrey also produced a record four Old Boys (Morne du Plessis (captain), Dawie Snyman (vice-captain), Theuns Stofberg and Robbie Blair) in the starting Springbok team against the World XV of Willie-John McBride during the inauguration of the new Loftus Versfeld. Two of these Grey Old Boys’ sons went to school at Paul Roos (Robbie Blair and Theuns Stofberg) while Dawie Snyman is currently assistant coach at Paul Roos.\n\n1988\n\nGrey played Paul Roos the first time since 1977 during a pre-season tour to the Cape. It was their second game of the season on 30 March 1988 at Markotter in Stellenbosch. There was a large crowd and the legendary Doc Craven also attended the game.\n\nThe 1988 Grey first team had five Springboks in Charl Marais, Ruben Kruger, Pieter Muller, Naka Drotske and Heinrich Fuls. Andre Blom, meanwhile, went on to play for the US Eagles. The entire Grey first XV was chosen for the starting line up of the Free State Craven Week that year. Also in the Grey team was Jannie Momberg who attended Paul Roos until std.8 before he finished off his school career at Grey following in the footsteps of his brothers, Niels and Steyn while his younger brother Altus also attend Grey all the way from Stellenbosch.\n\nAs a result, this was a unique experience for Jannie, who was probably the only person at the game that knew all 30 players (many of his primary school friends also played for Paul Roos). Even the referee Johan Carinus (who played for Paul Roos against Grey in 1967) was an old friend of Jannie’s family.\n\nAlthough Grey had several future Springboks in their team, they were still finding their feet and were still to ‘click’ as a unit. Nevertheless, Marais scored Grey’s first try in the corner after a grubber from Naka Drotske. The game was fairly close and Grey won only in the final minutes with a disputed try by Muller. To most observers he knocked the ball on, however the referee allowed the try and Grey won 16-9.\n\n1989\n\nIn 1989 it was Paul Roos touring up north during pre-season, playing Grey at Shimla Park in Bloemfontein. Grey had two SA Schools players (Naka Drotske and Mark McIntyre) and beat Paul Roos 28-7.\n\n1990\n\nGrey and Paul Roos were invited to play in the main match of the Van Rensburg Rugby Day in George at the conclusion of the schoolboy rugby season. This memorable festival originated from the Van Rensburg brothers in George, who were passionate about schoolboy rugby and wanted to see SA’s top rugby schools compete against each other. They were visionaries in the early nineties to host such a festival – the front runner of many other festivals to follow.\n\nThe difference with the Van Rensburg Rugby Day and many other Easter Festivals is that the Rugby Day was hosted at the end of the schoolboy rugby season and comprises just one full day of rugby between SA’s top schools. It also included many other festivities around George throughout the weekend and thousands of spectators, fans and Old Boys from across the country attended this unique event which was only in existence from 1990–1991.\n\nThe build up to the 1990 Final match between Grey and Paul Roos was televised on TopSport TV and legendary rugby critic Zanderg Jansen was doing most of the pre-match build up. He was also the host at the event and the judge in selecting the best team, forwards and backline of the festival, as well as man of the match awards from all the schools including Bishops, Paarl Gim, Paarl Boys’ High and Affies. The following year Johan Small-Smith (Grey Old Boy) was passionately involved in the festival and was also supporting Jansen during the announcements on the best teams of the festival.\n\nBoth Grey and Paul Roos went unbeaten leading up to this match and Grey had five SA Schools players in their side that year: Pieta Steenkamp, Alex Fenwick, Nico Linde, Jean Craven, and Andre Venter. The 1990 Paul Roos side was the first unbeaten Paul Roos team in 37 years and had two future Springboks in Justin Swart and Cobus Visagie.\n\nIt was a tightly contested match with Paul Roos’ forwards gaining the upper hand at scrums while Grey’s backline was firing on all cylinders. Grey’s scrumhalf and future Springbok, Werner Swanepoel, broke blindside from a scrum to score the winning try for Grey with a final score of 17-9.\n\n1991\n\nThe Paul Roos first team of 1991 will go down as one of the best sides the school has ever produced. On 10 August 1991, as part of Paul Roos’ 125 Year festivities, the Grey First Team and Cherries was invited to play against Paul Roos at Markotter. Paul Benade (old Grey) was instrumental to help finance the transportation of the buses and other logistics for the Grey teams.\n\nThey had the chance to become the first undefeated Paul Roos team in 38 years and after the narrow defeat against Grey the previous year, this was always going to be the pinnacle of schoolboy matches in 1991. In addition, Grey had five SA Schools players (Andre Venter, Alex Fenwick, Werner Swanepoel, Ollie le Roux and Hugo Venter), including two future Springboks in Le Roux and Swanepoel. Paul Roos had a pair of future Springboks (Justin Swart and Cobus Visagie) in their side which set the table for a massive showdown.\n\nBelow Match Report from Cape newspapers:\n\nPaul Roos outclass highly rated Grey College\n\nPaul Roos Gymnasium (12) 20\n\nGrey College (0) 3\n\n“The Paul Roos Gymnasium u/19A side produced arguably its best performance of the 1991 rugby season to whip Bloemfontein’s Grey College 20-3 at Stellenbosch’s Markotter Stadium on Saturday.\n\nIt was widely believed that highly rated Grey, fielding 11 Free State Craven Week players, could end Paul Roos’s unbeaten run, but eventually they were outclassed by committed and confident opposition.\n\nThe scoreline did not fatter the home team in the least.\n\nInitially it seemed as though the stiff breeze would play a significant role in the match, particularly when Justin Swart landed three penalty kicks within the first eight minutes by judging the wind from behind to a nicety.\n\nBut the wind did not prove much use to the hard-pressed visitors in the second half as Paul Roos simply got stronger and stronger to confirm their superiority in all departments, scoring two tries to nil to put the issue beyond any doubt.\n\nFor the first time this season, the Stellenbosch school’s backs looked the part while facing tough opposition, particularly during the second half when they ran the ball confidently and judiciously.\n\nAlthough both Paul Roos tries were scored by forwards, the backs set it up through their quality of play.\n\nGrey were, to say the least, a major disappointment. Only right at the end, when 3-20 down, were they able to mount an attack which seemed likely to produce a try, and even then they were denied that consolation.\n\nTheir forwards found the going to tough, to last the pace, while their backs over-elaboration on the attack saw movements come to naught against resolute defense.\n\nGrey’s frustration at having to play under sustained fierce pressure was probably the main reason for the South African Schools centre, Andre Venter, becoming involved in a scuffle with Bles Kemp, the Paul Roos no.8, shortly before the final whistle.\n\nThat incident, which ended only after the intervention of people on the sideline, raised questions about the appointment of Dougie Holwill as referee for a match of such magnitude.\n\nAlthough it was a clear case of foul play, Mr. Holwill did not immediately try to establish from the touch-judge closest to the incident what had happened, and did not speak to or warn the players involved either.\n\nThe referee’s inconsistency at the line-outs must have left the players wondering what to expect next. Premature support of the jumper either legal or illegal, and should be treated the same from start to finish.\n\nWhen two of the best sides in the country (at any particular level) meet, a top-class referee must be in charge. Sadly this was not the case in Stellenbosch on Saturday.”\n\nPaul Roos’ Justin Swart (vice-captain) and Thian Muller (captain) in 1991\n\nPaul Roos 1991 on TV – YouTube below:\n\n1992\n\nAfter the 20-3 defeat the previous year, Grey was ready to turn the tables in Bloemfontein and won 20-6. This was also the first full Interschools between the pair where all other sports and teams were participating for the first time.\n\n1995\n\nAfter three dismal years for Grey rugby according to their own high standards, the 1995 first team turned it around and became undefeated again. This was also the first time that Grey would beat Paul Roos in Stellenbosch since 1988. The final score was 21-10.\n\n1998\n\nAfter losing to Paul Roos in Stellenbosch 12-8 the year before, this was a keenly contested match in Bloemfontein. Rudolph Froneman scored Grey’s winning try and the final score was 23-15 to the home team. CJ van der Linde (Springbok) played for Grey that day.\n\n1999\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten going into the final game of the season. Paul Roos had won all 20 matches and Grey all 15 and between them they had played the elite rugby schools of South Africa. Both defeated Affies and Paarl Boys’ High while PRG also beat Paarl Gym and Bishops. This was the showdown for the best Rugby School in SA at the end of the season.\n\nBoth sides chose attack above defence and there were some thrilling tries, notably when Grey fullback Dandre Gerber scored in the corner after a muscular break by impressive flanker Handrew Haupt. That try put Grey ahead 26-21 after Paul Roos had seemingly taken control soon after half-time when, with the wind at their backs, they led 21-14. With a minute of regular time left the score was 26-26. A penalty in front of the posts enabled Grey to win 29-26.\n\nScorers\n\nPaul Roos – Tries: Flank Braam Immelman (2), wings James Voortman and George Hauptfleish. Dropgoals: Flyhalf PJ Bergh (2)\n\nGrey College – Tries: Fullback Dandre Gerber (2), wing Riaan Harmse (2). Conversions: Lock Liam Combrink (3). Penalty: Centre Barry Goodes (1)\n\nSpringboks Wian du Preez (Grey) and Schalk Brits (Paul Roos) played that day.\n\n2001\n\nAnother close encounter in Stellenbosh which Grey won 15-6. Springboks Bismarck du Plessis (Grey) and Andries Bekker (Paul Roos) played that day.\n\n2002\n\nGrey had several future Springboks and provincial rugby players in their team including Ruan Pienaar, Bismark du Plessis (both Springboks), and Andries Strauss (Sharks). Schalk Ferreira played for SA Schools from Paul Roos.\n\n2003\n\nGrey won in Stellenbosch and produced five SA Schools players: Flip vd Merwe, Richardt Strauss, Adriaan Strauss, Steph Robberts, and Alwyn Hollenbach. Jodie Rose was chosen for the SA Schools from Paul Roos. Jaundre Kruger, who later became Paul Roos’ 50th Springbok played that day when Grey won a nailbiter 18-17 at Markotter.\n\n2004\n\nIn 2004 both Grey and Paul Roos were missing key players towards the end of the season as their Interschools match in Bloemfontein came around. Grey lost their SA Schools players and the back row included Heinrich Brussow (Springbok), Deon Stegmann (Springbok) and Richardt Strauss (Cheetahs & Ireland). Pieter Myburgh played SA Schools for Paul Roos that year. This was another closely contested game and Paul Roos’ first victory over Grey in Bloemfontein, by 21-18.\n\n2006\n\nLeading into the final Grey derby of the season Paul Roos was the top rugby school in SA, having had a magnificent season in 2006. It was a memorable game for Rector Jock de Jager, attending his final Interschools having served as Paul Roos headmaster from 1993 to 2007.\n\nMany experts compared this team with the likes of 1991 and 1999 PRG teams. Four backline players from the 2006 Paul Roos team were selected for the final trial for the SA Under-20 team: scrumhalf Francois Hougaard, flyhalf Coenie van Wyk and centers Charl Weideman and Stephan Dippenaar. However, neither Hougaard nor Dippenaar made the Craven Week.\n\nIn another close encounter, Paul Roos beat Grey 16-11, which resulted in two consecutive Interschools victories for the first time for Paul Roos in Bloemfontein. Springbok Frans Steyn played for Grey in 2006.\n\nPaul Roos 2006 YouTube video\n\nFrans Steyn (Grey Springbok)\n\n2007\n\nThe class of 2007 produced a remarkable Grey first team which beat Paul Roos by a record score of 40-14 in Stellenbosch. The Ebersohn twins Robert (Springbok squad) and Sias (Cheetahs) plus Coenie Oosthuizen (Springbok) played for Grey that day.\n\nBoth locks of Grey College, Pieter Labuschagne and Joubert Horn, played well in victory. Boom Prinsloo, Roelf Pienaar (both flanks) and Adriaan Theisinger (eighth man) also had great performances on the day.\n\nGrey’s SA Schools centre, Robert Ebersohn, showed once again why he was so highly rated in school rugby. Under Ebersohn’s captaincy Grey won all 14 matches this season.\n\nSpringbok Willie le Roux played flyhalf for Paul Roos and kicked three penalties in the first half to keep his team in contention until the break.\n\nThis Grey team had the highest average score for any Grey first team over the last 40 years, with an average of 55 points per game.\n\nOne month earlier the Free State Craven Week team, with 15 Grey College boys, also put 50 points on WP in the final of the Craven Week at Markotter stadium.\n\n2008\n\nBuilding on the previous record score at Markotter, the 2008 Grey first team beat Paul Roos with another record in Bloemfontein, 47-15. Grey had two SA School players (Francois Venter and Franna du Toit) that year while scrumhalf Kobus Reinach – son of double Springbok Jaco Reinach (Grey 1980) and nephew of another legendary old Grey Herman Reinach (1988), later became the regular no.9 for the Sharks.\n\n2009\n\nThe 2009 Grey first team equaled the most SA Schools players produced by one school in the starting line-up with six: Pieter Rademan (captain), Riaan Britz, Piet Lindeque, Jean Cook, Carl Wegner and Stephanus Kotze. The previous record was also held by Grey in 1981. JP du Plessis played SA Schools for Paul Roos in 2009.\n\nBoth Grey and Paul Roos played without their SA Schools players during the last match of the season. Hero of the day was flyhalf Lucas Roothman, who landed the three decisive penalties, while Grey full-back Niel Marais could only manage one. This ended a winning streak for Grey since 2007.\n\n2009 Jolla Bolla – YouTube:\n\n2010\n\nThe 2010 Grey College first team is regarded as one of the best Grey sides in modern times. Grey produced six SA Schools players that year: William Small-Smith (captain), Anrich Bitzi, Kevin Luiters, Paul Jordaan, Johan Goosen and Neethling Fouche. Grey beat all of South Africa’s top rugby schools including Paarl Gym, Paarl Boys’ High, Monnas, Affies, Grey High, Glenwood as away games which is a remarkable performance.\n\nPaul Roos also had a very successful season with three SA Schools players (Steven Kitshoff, JP Lewis and Tshotso Mbovane) so the table was set for a climax in Bloem. With tighthead prop Steven Kitshoff Paul Roos had a strong scrum but was also penalized several times. Goosen scored 36 points (including one try) on the day when Grey won a nail biter 41-29.\n\nJohan Goosen (Springbok) scored 36 points against Paul Roos in 2010\n\nJohan Goosen scoring 36 points against Paul Roos – See YouTube link below:\n\nSee YouTube below:\n\nGrey vs Paul Roos 2010 – War Cry\n\nYouTube below:\n\n2011\n\nIn 2011 Grey played Paul Roos at the Danie Craven Stadium due to construction at the Markotter Field. Paul Roos was leading with only a few minutes left when Grey scored and won the match in the final minutes 36-35. JP Lewis was Paul Roos’ SA Schools player while Grey had three SA Schools representatives: Jan Serfontein, Dries Swanepoel and Neethling Fouche.\n\nGrey / Paul Roos Interschools weekend 2011 – YouTube:\n\n2012\n\nLeading into the final game of the season Grey had a below average season according to their own high standards while Paul Roos had a strong team with one SA Schools player in Chad Solomon. The game was pretty even until half way through the second half when Grey took control and won by 33-23\n\nGrey & Paul Roos old boys part of the victorious SA U-20 Junior World Cup team in 2012:\n\n2013\n\nGrey came down to Stellenbosch and played a superb brand of rugby in wet conditions that should actually have favored the boys in maroon. They totally outplayed Paul Roos in the rain to win with a record margin of 40-8. Paul Roos did not have a bad first half and trailed only 3-6. In the second half the Grey pack with prop Andrew du Plessis, lock De Wet Bezuidenhout and flank Luan Reynders in the van, took over the match and gave their backs excellent front-foot ball. Paul Roos were forced to tackle again and again and inevitably the tries came – all five of them.\n\nOutstanding for Grey was speedy Henry Immelman, usually a wing but taking over the role of EW Viljoen, who was playing for SA Schools in Worcester with great verve. Grey’s display in any conditions would have been magnificent. In the rain and wind of Stellenbosch in 2013 it bordered on the miraculous.\n\n2014\n\nGrey was back on top of the schools rankings in 2014 and their final match against second ranked Paul Roos was the decider for the season. The star of the match was again Henry Immelman (pictured below) as he did a repeat of the previous year’s match down in Stellenbosch.\n\nHe scored both of Grey’s tries and kicked two penalty goals from inside his own half. He actually missed his first kick – from just outside of his own 22, but then Grey were playing with the wind in the first half. Grey scored two tries to one but Aidynn Cupido, son of WP legend Wilfred, kicked 15 points for Paul Roos on the day.\n\nNone of the match’s three tries were converted. In fact it was a surprisingly stodgy match between two very creative sides. In the end Grey prevailed by keeping ahead of the visitors and scoring points when it mattered to eventually win 25-20 and take the top spot for the year.\n\nRugby at Paul Roos\n\nThe words Paul Roos and rugby are synonymous as the great man was the originator of the now famous Springbok emblem and name for the South African national team. He is seen by many as the father of South African rugby and it is fitting that the school that carries his name is such a powerhouse in the South African game.\n\nPaul Roos has to date produced the most South African players to represent their country on a rugby field with Juandre Kruger becoming their 50th when he played against England at Kings Park on June 9 2012. Their latest Springbok is fullback Willie Le Roux, who got his test cap against Italy in June 2013.\n\nThe following players from Paul Roos have represented South Africa on the rugby field:\n\nArthur Nicholas de Kock (1891), Jacob Stephanus (Japie) Louw (1891), James Alexander (Jim) McKendrick (1891), Robert (Bob) Shand, Paul Johannes de Waal (1896), Japie Krige (1896), Bob Loubser (1896), Pieter Albertus Ryno Otto (PO) Nel (1903), Paul Johannes Roos (1903), Koei Brink (1906), Henry John (Pinkie) Daneel (1906), Boy de Villiers (1906), Freddie Luyt (1910), Dick Luyt (1910), Koot Reynecke (1910), Gideon Daniël Roos (1910), Wakkie Krige (1912), John Douglas Luyt (1912), Tom van Vuuren (1912), Nic du Plessis (1921), Theuns Kruger (1921), Charlé Meyer (1921), Mannetjies Michau (1921), Phil Mostert (1921), Tokkie Scholtz (1921), Jackie Tindall (1921), Attie van Heerder (1921), PK Albertyn (1924), Nico Bosman (1924), Daunce Devine (1924), Kenny Starke (1924), George Murray Daneel (1928), Manus de Jongh (1928), AF du Toit (1928), PK Morkel (1928), Boet Prinsloo (1928), Ferdie Bergh (1931), George Lionell van Reenen (1937), Ballie Wahl (1949), Tjol Lategan (1949), Jannie Engelbrecht (1960), Gertjie Brynard (1965), Hempies du Toit (1980), Cabous van der Westhuizen (1994), Justin Swart (1996), Cobus Visagie (1999), Andries Bekker (2008), Schalk Brits (2008), Francois Hougaard (2009), Juandre Kruger (2012),Willie Le Roux (2013).\n\nThe following players from Paul Roos have represented South African Schools on the rugby field:\n\nAdams, Tythan – 2008\n\nBrits, Schalk– 1999 (Springbok)\n\nDu Plessis, Daniel – 2013\n\nDu Plessis, JP –2009\n\nEngelbrecht, Johan -1986\n\nFerreira, Schalk – 2002\n\nKitshoff, Steven – 2010\n\nKoch, Agie – 1974-75\n\nLeonard, Nico – 2015\n\nLewis, Jean-Paul – 2010-11\n\nMyburgh, Pieter – 2004\n\nMyburgh, Stefaan -1996\n\nMbovane, Tshotso – 2010\n\nRautenbach, George – 1974-75\n\nRose, Jody – 2003\n\nRoux, Paul – 2000\n\nSiegelaar, Alastair – 2004\n\nSolomon, Chad – 2012\n\nSwart, Justin – 1991 (Springbok)\n\nVermeulen, Gielie – 1983\n\nVermeulen, Joshua – 2015\n\nWillemse Damian – 2015\n\nPaul Roos 2015 season\n\nPaul Roos, amid their 150th year celebrations, are constantly under pressure to perform. So far they have not disappointed and have only lost two closely contested matches against local rivals from Paarl. They have toured Japan to represent South Africa at the Sanix Youth World Rugby Championship and, after six matches on a tight schedule, they returned triumphant as the holders of the gold medal. Their season has gone to plan and coach Hein Kriek can be proud of his team after wins over Affies, Jeppe, Monument and Grey High PE.\n\nThe highly competitive Western Cape Schools league is a tough environment to stay unbeaten and they had one slip against Paarl Gim, as well as losing to SA ranked No 1 school Paarl Boys. To end the season off, they will have to face their old foe in Grey College as their final match of their 150th year celebrations.\n\nThe Maroon Machine had three WP Craven Week representatives this year in Joshua Vermeulen, Nico Leonard and Damien Willemse while reserve prop Muammir Salie, lock Lazlo Pscorn and captain Joa Swart all made the WP Academy team.\n\nVermeulen, Willemse and Leonard also made the SA Schools team coached by Kriek.\n\nDue to an injury suffered during the SA Schools week, Joshua Vermeulen will not be available for Paul Roos against Grey College.\n\nRugby at Grey College\n\nGrey has served Bloemfontein, the Free State, South Africa and the world well over the past 150 years. Grey has been able to make adjustments and remain relevant in a changing environment in which it has developed, grown and excelled. The brand is known and revered throughout South Africa and even internationally and the products of the school make a positive difference wherever they are. Parallel medium education, tolerance, respect for others and loyalty to the school are not only traditions, but firm foundations in a global village. Grey is structured on these foundations and is constantly adapting to new developments. The wave of change washing over our country confirms the value of Grey’s traditions.\n\nGrey has produced 42 Springbok rugby players. Since World War II it has produced more Springbok players than any other school in SA.\n\nList of Grey Springboks\n\nPlayer Debut Herman van Broekhuizen 1896 Boetie McHardy 1912 Sarel Strauss 1921 Louis Babrow 1937 Harry Martin 1937 Piet de Wet 1938 Popeye Strydom 1955 Gert Cilliers 1963 Flip vd Merwe 2010 Deon Stegman 2010 Johan Spies 1970 Morné du Plessis 1971 Dawie Snyman 1972 Jackie Snyman 1974 Theuns Stofberg 1976 Robbie Blair 1977 Jaco Reinach 1986 Helgard Muller 1986 Pieter Muller 1992 Heinrich Fuls 1992 Johan Styger 1992 Ruben Kruger 1993 Naka Drotske 1993 Ollie le Roux 1994 Werner Swanepoel 1997 Charl Marais 1999 CJ van der Linde 2002 Gerrie Britz 2004 Ruan Pienaar 2006 Francois Steyn 2006 Jannie du Plessis 2007 Bismarck du Plessis 2007 Adriaan Strauss 2008 Heinrich Brussow 2008 Wian du Preez 2009 Johan Goosen 2012 Coenie Oosthuizen 2012 Tiaan Liebenberg 2012 Jan Serfontein 2013 Piet Van Zyl 2013 Marcel van der Merwe 2014 Cobus Reinach 2014\n\nSA Schools players produced by Grey College\n\n2014-15 IG Prinsloo\n\n2013 EW Viljoen\n\n2013 Ruan Kramer\n\n2011 Leneve Damens\n\n2011 Jan Serfontein (Springbok)\n\n2011 Dries Swanepoel\n\n2010 Neethling Fouche\n\n2010 Johan Goosen (Springbok)\n\n2010 Paul Jordaan\n\n2010 Kevin Luiters\n\n2010 Anrich Bitzi\n\n2010 William Small-Smith\n\n2009 Riaan Britz\n\n2009 Jean Cook\n\n2009 Stephanus Kotze\n\n2009 Charl Wenger\n\n2009 Pieter Rademan\n\n2008 Franna Du Toit\n\n2008 Francois Venter\n\n2007 Robert Ebersöhn (uncapped Springbok)\n\n2007 Roelof Pienaar\n\n2007 Coenie Oosthuizen (Springbok)\n\n2006 Pieter-Willem Van Vuuren\n\n2005 Josephus Oosthuizen\n\n2004 Herman Pretorius\n\n2004 Heinrich Brussouw (Springbok)\n\n2004 Deon Stegmann (Springbok)\n\n2003 Adriaan Strauss (Springbok)\n\n2003 Flip Van der Merwe (Springbok)\n\n2003 Richardt Strauss (Ireland)\n\n2003 Alwyn Hollenbach\n\n2003 Steph Robberts\n\n2002 Ruan Pienaar (Springbok)\n\n2002 Riaan Vermeulen\n\n2001-02 Bismarck Du Plessis (Springbok)\n\n2000 Willie Steenkamp\n\n1999-2000 Wian Du Preez (Springbok)\n\n1998 CJ Van der Linde (Springbok)\n\n1997 Noël Oelschig\n\n1993 Chris Derksen\n\n1992 JR Oosthuizen\n\n1991 Hugo Venter\n\n1991 Ollie Le Roux (Springbok)\n\n1991 Werner Swanepoel (Springbok)\n\n1990 Jean Craven\n\n1990-91 Alex Fenwick\n\n1990-91 André Venter\n\n1990 Nico Linde\n\n1990 Pieta Steenkamp\n\n1989 Naka Drotské (Springbok)\n\n1989 Mark McIntyre\n\n1987-88 Pieter Müller (Springbok)\n\n1987-88 Ruben Kruger (Springbok)\n\n1987 Jaco Jacobs\n\n1986 Pieter De Haas\n\n1986 Andries Truscott (Springbok)\n\n1986 Jaco Swanepoel\n\n1985-86 Buks Steenkamp\n\n1985-86 Chet Maherry\n\n1985 Frans Cronjé\n\n1984 Andre Stompie Fourie\n\n1983 Kalf Giezing\n\n1983 Kees Stevens\n\n1983 Gert Marais\n\n1983 Eben Scheepers\n\n1981-82 Helgard Müller (Springbok)\n\n1981 Leon Botha\n\n1981 Conrad De Beer\n\n1981 Scheepers Gouws\n\n1981 Andre Greyling\n\n1981 Gerbrand Grobler\n\n1980 Hendrik Daffue\n\n1980 Jurie Erwee\n\n1980 Koen Pieterse\n\n1979-80 Jaco Reinach (Springbok)\n\n1979-80 Joepie Van der Merwe\n\n1979 Chris Smit\n\n1979 Ian Sadie\n\n1978 Riaan Joubert\n\n1977 Willem Daffue\n\n1977 Abrie Marais\n\n1977 Jacques Nell\n\n1977 Toppie Richter\n\n1977 Jan Richter\n\n1975 Kobie Fenwick\n\n1975 Pieter Theron\n\n1974-75 Jan Geldenhuys\n\n1974-75 Gerhard Weitz\n\nGrey College recent Springbok accomplishments\n\nThere were five Old Grey College Boys in the 1999 World Cup squad: Ollie le Roux, Naka Drotské, Ruben Kruger, Werner “Smiley” Swanepoel and Pieter Müller.\n\nIn the 2007 winning World Cup team there were again five Old Grey College Boys in CJ van der Linde, Jannie and Bismarck du Plessis, Ruan Pienaar and Francois Steyn.\n\nIn the 2010 season Grey had eight representatives in the Springbok squad: Deon Stegmann, Adriaan Strauss, CJ van Niekerk, Jannie Du Plessis, Bismarck Du Plessis, Flip vd Merwe, Ruan Pienaar and Franscois Steyn.\n\nGrey College had six representatives in the 2011 Rugby World Cup Springbok team in New Zealand: Jannie du Plessis, Bismarck du Plessis, Frans Steyn, Ruan Pienaar, Heinrich Brussow, and CJ van der Linde.\n\nGrey College 2015 Season\n\nThe season did not start well for Grey after losing a number of key players to injury. None as devastating as the injury to “Klein Os”, son of Os Du Randt, who will not be able to play this season due to a serious knee injury. “Klein Os” is a prolific flanker with speed to burn and is a great loss to the Bloem boys. They have enough depth, however, to cover such losses and should not be much weaker because of it.\n\nThey did suffer an unprecedented three losses in a row when they went down to Monument, Paarl Boys High and Affies in consecutive weekends in May. They also picked up a host of new injuries including incumbent captain Werner Roberts due to a car accident. They virtually had to string together a whole new first team, but true to the Grey spirit, they fought back and lived up to one of their motto’s: “When the occasion demands it”. They won all their next matches including tough opposition in Selborne College, Grey High School and Maritzburg College. Some of their casualties might return for the Paul Roos match, but the starting line-up is still undecided at this stage.\n\nDespite all these injuries, they still managed to produce 13 players for the OFS Craven Week team: 15 Niel Durrow, 14 Godfrey Simelane, 13 Francois Aggenbach, 12 PR Serfontein, 9 Rewan Kruger, 8 Diaan Schoonees, 7 Jurie Burger, 4 George Rossouw, 3 Gideon Beukes, 2 Daniel Rust, 16 Steph Brits, 17 IG Prinsloo and 20 Hardus Nel.\n\nA further seven players made the OFS Academy team: 13 Marnus Boshoff, 12 Dawid Snyman, 10 E van Vuuren, 4 Marius Kruger, 16 Chappo Pieterse, 20 Mario Vieira and 21 J van der Walt. Thus with the bulk of their star players injured, they still produced 20 provincial U-18 players for OFS, showing the depth that Grey College boasts.\n\nIG Prinsloo went one step further and repeated his feat of last year by gaining SA Schools “A” colours for 2015.\n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\nEditors:\n\nNico du Plessis & Pollie Pollard\n\nContributions (including Photos):\n\nNic de Jager, Nelio de Sa, Wilhelm Landman, George Rautenbach, Jan (Gans) Coetzee, Jan Geldenhuys, Abrie Marais, Charl Marais, Jannie Momberg, Flip de Bruyn, Morne (Boitjie) Vermeulen, Eion du Toit, Hilda Swartz (Paul Roos Old Boys)\n\nStatistics:\n\nPollie Pollard & Nelio de Sa www.rugby15.co.za\n\n© Copyright: Premier Interschools Pty, Ltd.\n\nRelated Posts\n\n2019 SA Rugby Youth Week dates and venues announced\n\nEP take top honours at Carfind.co.za Iqhawe Week\n\nThree teams remain unbeaten in Carfind.co.za Iqhawe Week"
