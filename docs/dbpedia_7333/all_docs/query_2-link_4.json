        "text": "Loading...\n\nHistorical Overview of Grey College vs Affies Derbies 1953-2010\n\nGrey College vs. Affies Interschools\n\nThe Rugby Teams of Grey College and Affies first played against each other in 1953, the same year that Affies’ legendary Springbok Louis Schmidt played in the First Team. Since 1953 Grey and Affies have met 31 times with Grey winning 23 of these encounters while 3 matches were lost and 5 were drawn (74% winning record).\n\nGrey’s winning record against all other schools since 1966 is 95% while Affies has a winning record of 70% against all other schools which dates back to 1923. Grey produced a total of 39 Springboks to date and Affies 7 Springboks. Post-isolation Springbok counts (since 1992) are 22 for Grey and 4 from Affies. Over the last decade Grey and Affies produced the most number of senior provincial rugby players (Currie Cup, Super 14 and Vodacom Cup) than any other school in South Africa.\n\nWhile Grey has a better winning record at the First Team level than Affies, it is interesting to note the strength and depth of Affies Rugby where Affies has won (on several occasions over the last two decade) the overall rugby count of all rugby matches played during the Interschools day.\n\nThe Grey vs. Affies Interschools has now evolved to be one of the Premier Interschools in South Africa and is a reflection of strength vs. strength between South Africa’s foremost rugby schools.\n\nSee below a historical overview of these two great schools:\n\n1855\n\nThe year in which Grey College was founded by Sir George Grey.\n\n1920\n\nThe year in which Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool (Affies) was founded.\n\n1953\n\nThe first encounter between Affies and Grey which Grey won 3-0. This match was played as a curtain-raiser for the Free State vs. Transvaal match during the inauguration of the new Springbok Park in Bloemfontein. The legendary Springbok Louis Schmidt (father of Uli) played for Affies’s First Team that year.\n\n1956\n\nAffies and Wonderboom hosted Sentraal High School and Grey College during the long week-end of 31 May. Several newspapers remarked that the attendance of these matches exceeded the attendance of major club, universities and several provincial matches. This is still the case today.\n\n1954 Grey College 9 vs Affies 3\n\n1955 Grey College 19 vs Affies 0\n\n1956 Grey College 6 vs Affies 6\n\n1957 Grey College 22 vs Affies 0\n\n1958 Grey College 14 vs Affies 6\n\n1959 Grey College 14 vs Affies 3\n\n1966 Grey College 25 vs Affies 11\n\n1967\n\nGrey won 22-0. Dawie Snyman (Springbok) was the Grey vice-captain of the legendary Grey College team of 1967. Wilhelm Landman (Grey School Captain that played Western Province and previous MD of Richemont South Africa) was Grey’s fullback that year.\n\n1970\n\nGrey won 16-11. Dr. Pierre Edwards (headmaster from Affies and Springbok fullback) played for Affies and Robbie Blair (Springbok flyhalf) played for Grey.\n\nEarly 70’s – Grey and Affies played regular Interschools in the early 70’s which was re-introduced again in the early 90’s\n\n1971 Grey College 19 vs Affies 0\n\n1972 Grey College 25 vs Affies 12\n\n1973 Grey College 10 vs Affies 3\n\n1974 Grey College 14 vs Affies 6\n\nMorne du Plessis (Grey) and Tonie Roux (Affies) played for the Springboks against the legendary Invincible 1974 British Lions of Willie-John McBride\n\n1977\n\nGrey produced a record four old Boys (Morne du Plessis (captain), Dawie Snyman (vice-captain), Theuns Stofberg and Robbie Blair) in the starting Springbok team against the World XV of Willie-John McBride during the inauguration of the new Loftus Versfeld\n\n1980\n\nDr. Pierre Edwards (headmaster from Affies) played for the Springboks against the South American Jaquars of Hugo Porta. Morne du Plessis (Grey) was captain of the Springbok team.\n\n1981\n\nGrey produced a record 6 SA Schools players which included 5 of the 6 backline players including the captain and scrumhalf, Conrad de Beer. Other players were Helgardt Muller, Andre Greyling, Gerbrand Grobler, Leon Botha and Scheepers Gouws\n\n1993\n\nFor the first time Affies and Grey drew the First Team match (26 all), played in Bloemfontein.\n\n1995\n\nGrey beat Affies 37-13 and had two players in the winning Springbok Rugby World Cup squad. Ruben Kruger and Naka Drotske.\n\n1996\n\nAffies beat Grey for the first time with a record score of 25-3 in Pretoria. This match was televised live on television. The 1996 Affies team has been regarded as one of the best Affies rugby teams in the history of the school and scored a record 146 tries that year.\n\n1998\n\nFor the first time, Affies won more rugby matches than Grey during the Interschools. The First Teams drew 23 all. The “Wit Bul” is introduced as the Affies mascot during the home match against Waterkloof.\n\n1999\n\nGrey won 17-13. Wian du Preez (Springbok) played for Grey that day.\n\nGrey produced five players in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Springbok squad (Pieter Muller, Ruben Kruger, Naka Drotske, Ollie le Roux, Werner Swanepoel)\n\n2000\n\nAffies en Grey drew 17 all.

Score was 12 all.\n\n2002\n\nThe 2002 Interschools between Grey and Affies in Pretoria will always be remembered as the last public appearance of Hansie Cronje before he tragically died one week later in a plane crash. This memorable occasion with Hansie at the Grey vs. Affies Interschools was also captured in the Hansie movie.\n\nGrey and Affies were very equal in terms of strength at First Team level over a span of 3 – 4 years before the 2002 Interschools since they drew 3 times during this time frame. The build-up to the 2002 Interschools was electric and it was the general consensus that the team that would win that day will be crowned as the unofficial top South African schools rugby team for 2002 and also over the preceding 4-5 years.\n\nGrey had several future Springboks and provincial rugby players in their team including Ruan Pienaar, Bismark du Plessis (both Springboks), and Andries Strauss (Sharks). Affies also had several future stars such as Derick Kuün (Bulls), Pierre Spies (Springboks) and Jacques-Louis Potgieter (Cheetahs and Bulls).\n\nIt was an intense match with Affies scoring early on and still leading 21-3 at halftime. It was published in the media after the match that Hansie called his dad (Ewie) during halftime and told him that while Grey is behind, he is convinced Grey would win that day. The second half produced some of the finest rugby moments from Grey scoring several tries to win 46-21.\n\nFor the 5th consecutive year Affies won more rugby matches on the day in all age groups.\n\n2003\n\nGrey won 33-3 in Bloemfontein and produced 5 SA Schools players –Phillip vd Merwe, Richardt Strauss, Adriaan Strauss, Steph Robberts, Alwyn Hollenbach.\n\n2004\n\nGrey won 32 – 29 in a nailbiting affair in Pretoria. Affies (16) won more rugby matches on the day against Grey (11). Grey’s First Team loose forwards were Heinrich Brussow (Springbok), Deon Stegmann (Bulls) en Richardt Strauss (Cheetahs).\n\n2005\n\nAffies beat Grey for the second time in history in the year that Grey celebrated its 150th year. The score in Bloemfontein was 27 – 20 for Affies. Frans Steyn was the Grey flyhalf that day.\n\nNo less than 13 Old Greys formed part of the Cheetahs squad, including management team, that won the 2005 Currie Cup Finals against the Bulls at Loftus.\n\n2006\n\nAffies won 18-13 in Pretoria. Grey won 20 of the 25 rugby matches played that day.\n\n2007\n\nThe 2007 Grey First Team was regarded as one of the best Grey College teams in history and beat Affies with a record score of 47 – 10 in Bloemfontein. The Ebersohn twins (Robert en Sias – both Cheetahs) and Coenie Oosthuizen (Cheetahs) played for Grey that day. This match was filmed by the Hansie movie crew to reproduce the 2002 Grey vs. Affies Interschools for the Hansie movie. Grey won 18 of the 28 rugby matches that day.\n\nIn the 2007 Rugby World Cup Springbok squad Grey College had the most schools representatives with five Old Grey players (CJ van der Linde, Bismark du Plessis, Jannie du Plessis, Ruan Pienaar, Francois Steyn). Affies had two representatives – Fourie du Preez and Wynand Olivier (Pierre Spies was injured)\n\n2008\n\nGrey won 31-12 in Pretoria.

The 2009 Grey First Team equaled the most amount of SA Schools players produced by one school in the starting line-up, namely six – Pieter Rademan (captain), Riaan Britz, Piet Lindeque, Jean Cook, Carl Wegner and Stephanus Kotze. The previous record was also held by Grey in 1981.\n\nAffies had five players in the Bulls Currie Cup winning team as well as in the Super 14 Final which the Bulls won – Fourie du Preez, Wynand Olivier, Derick Kuun, Gerhard van den Heever and Pierre Spies.
