        "text": "Paarl Boys’ High made history for the second time in Bloemfontein when they defeated Grey College by 46-31 in their annual Premier Interschools on Saturday. The team of captain, Francke Horn, became only the second first XV of Boishaai to manage to beat Grey in the City of Roses.\n\nThe victory was Boishaai’s third successive over their adversaries from Bloemfontein. Last year Boishaai came out on top 28-18 at home, while also beating Grey 21-19 in Bloemfontein two years ago. Saturday’s loss was Grey College’s first since last year’s defeat against Boishaai.\n\nPaarl Boys’ High now boast a run of 46 consecutive victories in South Africa. The team’s last defeat was back in 2014 in the final of Die Burger’s competition against Marlow Landbou (10-11). The team coached by Sean Erasmus did, however, lose against Christchurch Boys’ High (36-38) on tour through New Zealand earlier this year.\n\nThe record for the most consecutive games without defeat belongs to Grey College. The team from Bloemfontein experienced a golden era between 1985 and 1991 going to an impressive 87 games without defeat. Grey did, however, draw two matches in this era against Paarl Gimnasium (9-all, 1988) and Grey High School (6-all, 1990).\n\nPaarl Boys’ High implemented the rolling maul to perfection in the first half and it brought them two tries through hooker, Wilhelm Barnard, and flanker Vian Fourie.\n\nGrey College’s scrumhalf, Ross Braude, had an outstanding day at the office as was rewarded with a try after catching Boishaai’s defence asleep. Grey College was in control on the scoreboard at 17-10 although they only had 38 percent of the possession in the first half.\n\nThis changed when Grey’s hooker, Ru-Hann Greyling, was sin-binned by the referee, Pieter Janse van Vuuren in the last minute of the half. Boishaai scored a vital try through fullback, Thaakir Abrahams, after some good work by flyhalf, Abner van Reenen. Grey College still went into the lead with a 17-15 lead, but most of their hard work through the first half was undone.\n\nPaarl Boys’ High took the lead for the first time in the match after only 26 seconds of the second half thanks to a try by winger Luka Ferreira. This try started a blitzkrieg of tries as Boishaai scored four tries in the first 13 minutes of the second half. The team from Paarl scored 24 unanswered points in about 14 minutes of play which took the game away from Grey College and lead by 39-24.\n\nAbner van Reenen scored his second through a cheeky chip and regather to the round of a good performance. Van Reenen, however, didn’t experience a good day with the boot as he missed five conversions.\n\nGrey College’s flyhalf, Christopher Schreuder, scored a consolation try to bring the final score down to 46-31 in favour of Boishaai.\n\nScorers:\n\nPaarl Boys’ High 46 (15) – Tries: Abner van Reenen (2), Wilhelm Barnard, Vian Fourie, Thaakir Abrahams, Luka Ferreira, Francke Horn, Le Roux Malan. Conversions: Van Reenen (3). Grey College 31 (17) – Tries: Wycliff Vlitoor (2), Ross Braude, Christopher Schreuder. Conversions: Schreuder (4). Penalty: Schreuder.\n\nOn Saturday 27th of May Premier Interschools once again brings a top-class derby to all lovers of schoolboy rugby. This time around the annual interschool between Paarl Boys’ High and Paul Roos Gimnasium is broadcast live at 12 noon from the Brug Street grounds of Boishaai.\n\nThese two traditional rivals have been playing each other since the early 1900’s and the two schools have a sporting history that dates back over 100 years and have always been great rivals on the sports fields and great friends off it. Many an old boy of these two schools have represented Western Province and South Africa together on the sports fields.\n\nThe first recorded time the old boys of the two schools played together for SA was in 1910 when the Springboks played Great Britain in a three-test series. Dirkie de Villiers and Cocky Hahn became Paarl Boishaai’s first Springboks while Gideon Roos (Brother of Paul Roos), Dick and Lammetjie Luyt and Koot Reynecke where the PRG representatives.\n\nTwo other famous Springboks, Jannie Engelbrecht (PRG) and Mannetjies Roux (Paarl Boys’ High) both made their debuts for South Africa in 1960. The first test they played together was against Wales in SA’s 3-0 win at Cardiff Arms Park. These two played together in 16 tests up to 1969.\n\nThe extreme rivalry runs deep between the two schools but so do the friendships. Over the years so many boys from the two schools have represented WP in various age group teams that when they get to their matric year they have played just as often with each other than against each other.\n\nPaul Roos and Boishaai were also the two Cape schools invited to the first St John’s College Easter Festival and have been regular attendees of this festival over the years. In 1999, the Paarl Boys’ High team was so depleted with injuries that they were one player short in their starting 15 for the last game against Kearsney. Up stepped George Hauptfleisch from Paul Roos and pulled on a Paarl Boishaai jersey to help them out. He even scored a try in Neil Fullard’s No 3 jersey so the try was accredited to Neil. Paarl Boys’ High then helped out Paul Roos by providing some substitutes for their bench just in case they get injuries.\n\nThe regular yearly derby only started to take shape in 1976 as rugby became more organised in Western Province and Boland Schools. Since the start of the annual interschool they have played 41 times with Paarl Boys winning 23, Paul Roos winning 17 and only one game ended in a draw.\n\nScores since 1976\n\nYEAR HJS PRG 2016 28 3 2015 29 10 2014 13 17 2013 20 19 2012 22 17 2011 20 18 2010 17 31 2009 16 11 2008 29 42 2007 26 8 2006 6 10 2005 16 11 2004 7 22 2003 9 12 2002 18 18 2001 14 9 2000 12 8 1999 13 26 1998 3 17 1997 25 22 1996 0 3 1995 6 3 1994 20 22 1993 11 13 1992 6 3 1991 6 29 1990 0 4 1989 6 21 1988 6 10 1987 7 6 1986 0 3 1985 31 7 1984 12 9 1983 9 3 1982 10 7 1981 12 6 1980 15 10 1979 13 9 1978 20 8 1977 13 3 1976 14 0\n\nPaarl Boys’ High had an exciting start to their season by travelling to New Zealand to play some of their top rugby schools. The school travelled with four teams (u19A, B and C and u16A) and won all their matches by healthy margins except the last one which the First XV lost in injury time in Christchurch to a dubious penalty. Shades of the Springbok tour of 1981 came to mind. In a funny twist, one of the parents of the u16 team was a Springbok on that self-same 1981 tour.\n\nImmediately on their return from New Zealand, they joined the Easter school festival at St John’s College where they played three games with the last one against Affies being a real humdinger. To date, they are still unbeaten in South Africa after having played 9 games in total. Their last match was against perennial No 1 rugby school Grey College in Bloemfontein, where they surprised friend and foe with their performance in beating Grey by a record margin.\n\nPaarl Boys’ High season so far (SA games only):\n\nDate Opp For Against 2017/04/13 Eye of the Tiger 57 0 2017/04/15 NSW Combined Schools 67 0 2017/04/17 Affies 14 10 2017/04/22 Outeniqua 47 16 2017/04/29 Selborne College 33 16 2017/05/01 Glenwood 31 12 2017/05/06 Wynberg Boys’ High 67 25 2017/05/13 Grey College 46 31 2017/05/20 Rondebosch Boys’ High 73 7\n\nPaul Roos had a slightly different start to their season than the boys from Paarl. They started their season with a good win over a strong HTS Drostdy side at their own rugby day in March and then moved on to St John’s College where they won all three their games, coming back strongly against Helpmekaar after being down 22 to nil at one stage. They narrowly lost in the last seconds of their match against Paarl Gimnasium and then beat Affies in probably their best match of the season so far. They then lost two games in a row against Waterkloof and Grey High before coming back and beating an in-form SACS side last Saturday. This shows that they are not as consistent as they would like to be but on any given day when they click, they can beat the best teams out there.\n\nPaul Roos season so far:\n\nDate Opp For Against 2017/03/25 HTS Drostdy 32 19 2017/04/13 Nelspruit 44 6 2017/04/15 Helpmekaar 25 22 2017/04/17 Parktown Boys’ High 61 12 2017/04/22 Paarl Gimnasium 19 20 2017/04/29 Affies 21 14 2017/05/01 Waterkloof 25 38 2017/05/06 Grey High 20 22 2017/05/13 SACS 29 24\n\nRugby at Paarl Boys’ High School\n\nRugby is an integral part of the Paarl Boys’ High way of life. It is important to win, but that should not be the primary objective. A sportsman may never be abused to ensure the success of a team. The primary objective at Paarl Boishaai must be one of enjoyment, for both player and coach. Whereas they agree with the legendary Vince Lombardi when he said: ‘’Winning isn’t everything; it’s the only thing’’ they hold winning to be more than just points on the board. Winning relates to the values, commitment and the pursuit of the best of one’s abilities.\n\nBoishaai has produced 20 players that have represented South Africa since 1906. They have provided some of the legends and most famous Springbok rugby players ever to have played in the Green and Gold. Players like Oom “Boy” and Fanie Louw, Piet “Spiere” du Toit, Mannetjies Roux, Ryk van Schoor, Carel Du Plessis and Corné Krige.\n\nPaarl Boys’ High provided 8 SA Schools players in 2016 which is a new record for any school in one year. They also provided five SA u20 players for the 2017 Junior World Cup squad to be played in Georgia later this year.\n\nPaarl Boys’ High Springboks.\n\nCocky Hahn (1910)\n\nDirkie de Villiers (1910)\n\nLouis Louw (1912)\n\nTheuns Kruger (1921)\n\nChampion Myburgh (1924)\n\nJack Bester (1924)\n\nBoy Louw (1928)\n\nManie Geere (1933)\n\nFanie Louw (1933)\n\nBen du Toit (1938)\n\nRyk van Schoor (1949)\n\nTheuns Briers (1955)\n\nPiet du Toit (1958)\n\nMannetjies Roux (1960)\n\nHaas Schoeman (1963)\n\nCarel du Plessis (1982)\n\nWium Basson (1997)\n\nCorné Krige (1999)\n\nGürthro Steenkamp (2004)\n\nFrans Malherbe (2013)\n\nRugby at Paul Roos:\n\nThe words Paul Roos and rugby are synonymous as the great man was the originator of the now famous Springbok emblem and name for the South African national team. He is seen by many as the “father” of South African rugby and it is fitting that the school that carries his name is such a powerhouse in South African school’s rugby.\n\nPaul Roos has to date produced the most South African players to represent their country on a rugby field with Juandré Kruger becoming their 50th player when he played against England at Kings Park on 9 June 2012. Their latest Springbok is propped Steven Kitshoff who made his debut against Ireland in 2016.\n\nThe following players from Paul Roos represented South Africa on the rugby field.\n\nArthur Nicholas de Kock (1891), Jacob Stephanus (Japie) Louw (1891), James Alexander (Jim) McKendrick (1891), Robert (Bob) Shand, Paul Johannes de Waal (1896), Japie Krige (1896), Bob Loubser (1896), Pieter Albertus Ryno Otto (PO) Nel (1903), Paul Johannes Roos (1903), Koei Brink (1906), Henry John (Pinkie) Daneel (1906), Boy de Villiers (1906), Freddie Luyt (1910), Dick Luyt (1910), Koot Reynecke (1910), Gideon Daniël Roos (1910), Wakkie Krige (1912), John Douglas Luyt (1912), Tom van Vuuren (1912), Nic du Plessis (1921), Theuns Kruger (1921), Charlé Meyer (1921), Mannetjies Michau (1921), Phil Mostert (1921), Tokkie Scholtz (1921), Jackie Tindall(1921), Attie van Heerder (1921), PK Albertyn (1924), Nico Bosman (1924), Daunce Devine (1924), Kenny Starke (1924), George Murray Daneel (1928), Manus de Jongh (1928), AF du Toit (1928), PK Morkel (1928), Boet Prinsloo (1928), Ferdie Bergh (1931), George Lionell van Reenen (1937), Ballie Wahl (1949), Tjol Lategan (1949), Jannie Engelbrecht (1960), Gertjie Brynard (1965), Hempies du Toit (1980), Cabous van der Westhuizen (1994), Justin Swart (1996), Cobus Visagie (1999), Andries Bekker (2008), Schalk Brits (2008), Francois Hougaard (2009), Juandre Kruger (2012),Willie Le Roux (2013). Steven Kitshoff (2016)\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on Saturday 27 May on SuperSport Select channel 210 at 11h55.\n\nYou can also catch the build-up Premier Interschools Magazine Show from Wednesday 24 May at 18.45 on SuperSport One featuring Thomas du Toit and Ernst Joubert\n\nOn Saturday, 3 June 2017, the sixth edition of Premier Interschools moves to Durban for the derby between Glenwood High School and Monument High from Krugersdorp. This encounter is relatively new on the calendar as both schools saw the need to exchange pleasantries over a weekend of competition to the benefit of all learners. They previously only met on festivals and on the rare occasion at the Easter Tournaments. Since 2010, however, they have played each other regularly and while Glenwood has only won once, the encounters have always been tough and uncompromising.\n\nResults through the years\n\nDate Monument Glenwood 2010/04/01 26 5 2011/04/02 16 8 2012/04/05 18 25 2013/06/01 26 20 2014/05/31 30 19 2015/06/06 21 8 2016/06/04 40 15\n\nGlenwood started the 2017 season on a roll, winning six games on the trot before coming unstuck against Paarl Boys’ High at the Wildeklawer tournament in Kimberley. They returned to their winning ways in the next two games comfortably beating Kearsney College and Menlopark before narrowly losing to arch rivals Durban High School on their reunion day. This result hurt their pride and they will not want to lose another game on Dixons this year, so Monument can expect a very fired up Glenwood waiting for them.\n\nThe good form of the team resulted in 13 of their players being picked for the KwaZulu-Natal Craven Week side while another five players were picked in the Academy side. The Glenwood players who will be representing KZN are Jordan Clark, Edward Laubscher, JJ van der Mescht, Dylan Kruger, Dylan Pretorius, Rynard Jonker, Conan le Fleur, Morné van Rensburg, Siyanda Cele, De Wet Truter, Thabiso Mdletshe, Brendon Schwultz and Jaden Hendricks (all Craven Week). Lunga Ncube, George Luzolo, Joe Jonas, Rory Atwell and Jhacques Thyssen (all Academy Week)\n\nMonument will thus have a huge task at hand coming down to Durban to virtually play a provincial side brimming with talent.\n\nGlenwood results for 2017 so far:\n\nDate Opp For Against 2017/04/04 Goudveld 24 18 2017/04/13 Framesby 21 10 2017/04/15 EG Jansen 24 19 2017/04/17 Noord-Kaap 25 20 2017/04/22 Westville Boys’ High 38 12 2017/04/29 Garsfontein 38 12 2017/05/01 Paarl Boys’ High 12 31 2017/05/06 Kearsney College 59 7 2017/05/13 Menlopark 39 0 2017/05/27 Durban High School 17 20\n\nTheir opponents on the day in from Monument have had a far busier season having already played 14 matches thus far. They suffered only 2 losses so far, both unexpected on the day against Eldoraigne and Boland Landbou. Their last win coming against a very good King Edward VII side that was to date unbeaten.\n\nThe “Wit Bulle” as they are affectionately known, has shown that they are a contender to be one of the top teams in the country this season and is evident in the 19 players selected for the four Lions Craven Week trial teams. At this stage, seven players are knocking very hard at the selector’s door for inclusion into the Lions Craven week team.\n\nHooker, Morné Brandon, Locks Christen van Niekerk and Stephan le Roux, captain and 8th man PJ (Pot) Jacobs, scrumhalf Tinus Combrinck, flanker Franco Schutte and utility back Luke Rossouw all have a very good chance of being selected for Craven Week. Also in contention is the two Dandre’s in prop Dandré Degenaar and fullback Dandré Prinsloo.\n\nThis weekend could be seen a preview to a Lions vs KZN game with all the possible provincial players on the show!\n\nMonument results for 2017 so far:\n\nDate Opp For Against 2017/03/07 Welkom Gimnasium 40 10 2017/03/11 Pietersburg 85 13 2017/03/18 Eldoraigne 22 27 2017/03/25 HTS Middelburg 14 12 2017/04/13 Dale College 33 16 2017/04/15 HTS Middelburg 40 8 2017/04/17 Selborne College 19 12 2017/04/22 Garsfontein 45 21 2017/04/29 Oakdale Landbou 32 8 2017/05/01 Boland Landbou 22 24 2017/05/06 EG Jansen 50 13 2017/05/13 Waterkloof 20 17 2017/05/20 Kempton Park 50 13 2017/05/27 King Edward VII 24 19\n\nRugby at Monument\n\nWhen the school opened in 1921 ML Brink held a meeting of boys to find out what games they wanted to play. They all opted for soccer, as was the custom on the bare fields of the Highveld at the time, and he then democratically decided that they would play rugby. The school played its first match on 1 April 1921 and drew 3-3 with Krugersdorp High School.\n\nSince then the school has had many great sides – as in 1924, 1953, 1979, 1980, 1984 and 1993 when the team scored 143 tries in 28 matches.\n\nMonument first won the Administrator’s Cup in 1953. It won again in 1973 and then again in 1992 and for the seven years which followed. In 2003, they were Media 24 National Schools Champions.\n\nThese are all huge achievements given the number and quality of the competing schools.\n\nAfter Brink, famous coaches have been Jan Lange (1936-53), Pa Pelser, the famous Transvaal loose forward and coach, and Hans Coetzee who still has a finger in many of rugby’s pies. Hans says nobody is compelled to play rugby but the players live for the game.\n\nIn 1993, the 1st XV toured France and Britain and went unbeaten.\n\nMonnas, as the school is usually known, has by far the largest representation of any school north of the Vaal River at Craven Week and in SA Schools.\n\nThe monument might soon have their 9th springbok with prop Ruan Dreyer being named in the 2017 squad to play France.\n\nSPRINGBOKS\n\nChristo Wagenaar Brendan Venter Jaque Fourie Jorrie Muller Heinke van der Merwe Willem Alberts\n\nJaco Taute\n\nJulian Redelinghuys\n\nRugby at Glenwood\n\nRugby at Glenwood is the major sporting code. It is a sport that instils values such as integrity, sportsmanship, loyalty, discipline and hard work. Glenwood’s policy of participation in extramural activities, as well as the passion shown by the boys, enables almost five hundred youngsters the opportunity of experiencing the ultimate team sport.\n\nGlenwood fields thirty teams on a regular basis. This allows boys from all levels and ability to be part of this wonderful game. The sports department endeavours to provide games for all teams, this has allowed Glenwood to embark on tours out the province to play fixtures against some major rugby playing schools in South Africa such as Affies from Pretoria and Grey College from Bloemfontein.\n\nThe player base at other schools is diminishing at an alarming rate. Schools, educators and parents owe it to our children to provide them with an environment that will foster a healthy lifestyle and the opportunity to experience a real childhood. Perhaps instead of instilling a win at all cost attitude, we should rather emphasise the fun part of playing rugby.\n\nThe School represented South Africa at the Sanix Youth tournament in Japan in 2008 and again in 2016 and won top honours on both occasions.\n\nThe first 90 years (1910 to 2000)\n\nGlenwood has produced some good sides and players over the years, particularly 1954, 1957, 1965, 1972, 1978, 1979, the late 90s and in the past decade. The 1965 side is still considered by most Old Boys and KZN pundits as the greatest produced by Glenwood, playing 14 and winning 14, scoring 283 points while only 50 points were scored against. Seven players represented Natal Schools that year and included great names like Kevin Sclanders (capped 3 times for Natal Schools), Hylton Aylward (capped three times for Natal Schools & Captain in 1964 & 1965), Dennis Morrissey (capped 2 times for Natal Schools), R.D Shaw, E. Sclanders, A.J Delport, A.R Wallace, D.M Lawson and C.R Chambers.\n\n1979 saw Glenwood produce their best side since 1965. Although 2 games were lost by the narrowest of margins, there was little doubt that they were the best side in Natal. They played magnificent rugby, combining superb forward power with intelligent backline play. Their margins of victory over some of the best sides in Natal say it all, College 33-6, DHS 32-4, Westville 44-9 and Hilton 53-12. Derek La Marque was simply superb. Probably the only schoolboy to represent South Africa at water polo while still at school and captain both SA Schools rugby and water polo in one year. He was capped 3 times for KZN Schools in 1977, 1978 and 1979. He went on to have a good career with Natal and helped Natal make the 1984 Currie Cup final, playing with greats like Wynand Claasen, Craig Jamieson and Hugh Reece-Edwards.\n\nThe next great side came in 1984 where Glenwood had three boys picked for Natal Schools of which one was probably the best backline player ever to play for Glenwood, Dennis Baronet. Seldom has a schoolboy caused so much panic in an opposition backline, carving them to pieces with his speed and guile. He was rewarded in 1985 with an SA Schools cap, Glenwood’s second. >From 1985 to 1997 Glenwood produced some average sides who had some great individuals like T. Labuschange and P.Senekal.\n\nThe 1992 side could have been Glenwood’s biggest pack of all time with Leyton Pardey the 120kg loosehead prop making KZN Schools along with David Terblanche (No8). 1997 was probably the turnaround after the ‘darker’ early to mid 90’s where Glenwood lost more than they won. It heralded the rising of a rugby beast. Victor Tsewu, Nicholas Strauss and Cedric Mzolo kicked started a new generation and one that continues today.\n\nThe 2000s\n\nSince 2000, Glenwood has produced 47 KZN Schools Craven Week A team representatives, including 5 SA Schools players (Petros Methula, Shaun Malton, Jayden Hill, Ricky Schnetler & Siyabonga Tom) and 2 SA Academy players (Nteta & Makhabela). This is probably the biggest contribution by any school in KZN with Westville and Maritzburg College 2nd and 3rd respectively.\n\nThe 2000 side played 37 and only lost 2. Unfortunately, Glenwood rise has seen a decline in the rugby standard of their biggest rival, DHS or Horseflies from the across the Berea.\n\nIn the past Glenwood have battled to beat this great Durban school but in the last decade, it’s been pretty one-sided.\n\nGlenwood has created a great rivalry with Westville and College in the past 5 years and always seem to be fighting out with them for top honours in KZN. Glenwood has won the best performing rugby school award in KZN for the past 4 years. Many an envious parent from opposition schools has claimed Glenwood ‘buying’ players and recruiting players with bursaries.\n\nGlenwood has been clever and promoted the school at primary school level and by having a winning 1st team has attracted the best players in the province. Having a Boarding Establishment that can house over 200 boys helps here too. With success brings demand for other provinces schools to play Glenwood.\n\nIn the last five years, Glenwood has set up home and away from traditional fixtures with Affies and Grey Bloem, two of the country’s best rugby schools without the doubt. Glenwood’s finest rugby hour came in 2006 when they beat the mighty Grey Bloem for the first time on fortress Dixons, 14-10. A great achievement and something that will be remembered for generations to come.\n\nList of Glenwood Springboks (Test Caps Only)\n\nDebut Year Player 1921 Wally Clarkson 1937 Mauritz van den Berg 1938 Roger Sherriff 1964 Don Walton 1968 Rodney Gould 1993 John Allan 2014 Warren Whiteley\n\nGlenwood can also be very proud of Warren Whiteley who was named the 58th Springbok captain for the 2017 test series against France, the first Glenwood old boy to have this honour bestowed upon.\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on Saturday 3 June on SuperSport Select channel 210 at 13.55\n\nMatch – Kick off 14:00 on Sel SA build up at 13:55\n\nYou can also catch the build-up Premier Interschools Magazine Show from Wednesday 31 May at 18.00 on SuperSport One featuring Julian Redelinghuys and Warren Whiteley\n\nPARKLANDS COLLEGE LOCK IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST\n\nSouth Africa has a distinct rugby culture; it is embedded into our youth from a young age. Young boys begin to learn the fundamentals of the game from the very beginning of their school careers and this is how the country has produced some of the most exciting talents that the sport has to offer. For Ian Ketwanga, this was not the case, however, despite being one of DHL Western Province’s most exciting young talents, has only been playing the game for three years.\n\nA giant in stature, Ian towers over the rest of his rugby class at Parklands College at 2 meters tall, he made the switch from playing basketball and soccer to rugby 3 years ago and has never looked back. His love for rugby is second to none, and he will not stop until he reaches his dream of representing South Africa at the highest level, in green and gold. Ketwanga knows that he must take it one step at a time, and that begins with making the DHL Western Province Coca-Cola Craven Week team.\n\nHe went on to explain what this achievement would mean to him, “Last year I felt that I was so close to making the Coca-Cola Craven Week team, being selected for the Academy week instead. The week was one of the best in my life, as I learnt so much and really enjoyed playing with my teammates, but this year I want to take the next step and make major impact at the Coca-Cola Craven Week. It would mean the absolute world to me to represent my province at this prestigious event.”\n\nIan has been part the Coca-Cola Youth Weeks tournaments since he made the switch to Rugby, having also played for the u16 DHL Western Province team in 2015. It is safe to say the sky is the limit for this humble off-the-field/ terrifying on-the-field giant.\n\nDHL Western Province is historically one of the most successful franchises in the country, with some of the biggest sporting schools in the province producing the majority of the talent over the years, but as seen with Ian Ketwanga, it would be unwise to discount the players coming from the smaller rugby schools, because sometimes, small can make very big.\n\nFRANCKE HORN – BOISHAAI’S LEADER SET TO GO THE DISTANCE\n\nOriginally from Bredasdorp, Francke Horn is Boishaai’s 8th man and currently participating in the Coca-Cola Craven Week trial process. Despite an intense couple of weeks going up against the toughest and most talented that Western Province has to offer, Horn says he is excited to see what his future in rugby holds.\n\nA prodigy from a young age; once he moved to Boishaai in grade 8 it did not take long for the coaches to recognise his talent straight away as well as his immense leadership qualities, which led him to captain the u14A team. He didn’t stop there, as he was soon selected to play and captain his province at the Coca-Cola Grant Khomo Week.\n\nThe provincial selections continued to pour in, with Francke subsequently being selected to play for DHL Western Province team at the 7s, again as captain – a true leader of the pack.\n\nRugby runs deep into Horn’s roots, with his father having played in the Coca-Cola Craven Week whilst residing in Graaff-Reinet. Francke went on to share the positive impact his family has had on his rugby career so far,” My parents are extremely supportive of my career in rugby. They attend each and every game without fail and always travel with me during the tournaments. Their messages before and after the game are truly something special! My dad and I often discuss my game, and how I can improve – he has experienced this himself, and it helps my growth in the game, a lot!”\n\nThe Boishaai First XV captain has dreams of taking his career all the way to the very highest level, and there is absolutely no doubt that he has all the right tools to get there. Horn shows a maturity far beyond his age as he stresses the importance of academic studies is to compliment a career in rugby and will be completing a degree through UNISA.\n\nThe country will most definitely have two eyes on this young talent.\n\n2017 SA Rugby Youth Weeks dates and venues:\n\nLSEN Week: 3 to 6 July 2017 – Durban (Glenwood High)\n\n• U16 and U18 National Girls Weeks: 3 to 7 July – HT Pelatona Projects Stadium, Welkom\n\n• U13 Craven Week and U16 Grant Khomo Week: 10 to 14 July – Grey College, Bloemfontein\n\n• U18 Craven Week and Academy Week: 17 to 22 July – St Stithians College, Johannesburg\n\nThe SA Rugby Youth Weeks kicked off on an exciting note on Monday with a series of big wins and hard-fought encounters characterising the opening day’s play at the National Girls U18 Week and Learners with Special Education Needs (LSEN) Week in Welkom and Durban respectively.\n\nIn the National Girls U18 Week, hosted at the HT Pelatona Projects Stadium, Western Province, Boland, Zimbabwe and Border Country Districts registered comprehensive victories to get the tournament off to a strong start, while the Leopards, Golden Lions, Boland and Golden Lions EE stamped their authority in the LSEN Week.\n\nIn the main matches in Welkom, Border, who won the final match of the tournament in last year’s edition of the tournament, broke away in the second half against the Blue Bulls after leading 8-7 to win 25-7, while Western Province delivered a fantastic display all-around to defeat KZN 59-0, with the team scoring an impressive nine tries.\n\nBoland, who faced the Limpopo Blue Bulls in the opening match of the day, cruised to a 34-0 halftime lead, and secured an impressive 46-14 victory, while Border CD overcame a closely-fought first half against the Pumas to touch down six times for their 32-7 victory.\n\nZimbabwe, meanwhile, scored seven tries in their 39-5 win against Griquas, while Eastern Province defeated SWD 20-5 after leading 10-5 at the break.\n\nFree State also started the competition on a high note as they produced a strong second half performance to outplay the Lions 22-5, while the Griffons crossed the tryline three times and limited the Leopards to a converted try only thanks to their solid defence for their 17-7 victory.\n\nIn the LSEN Week at Glenwood High School in Durban, meanwhile, the Golden Lions overpowered the Blue Bulls EE 44-7, while their Golden Lions EE counterparts defeated the Griffons 36-18 in the opening matches of the day.\n\nThe Leopards registered the biggest victory of the day as they defeated hosts, KZN, 57-5 with Eric Lamb scoring a hat-trick and Amogelang Gorekwang two tries as they racked up eight tries in the match.\n\nWestern Province’s successful goal-kicking, meanwhile, earned them a 24-15 victory against the Blue Bulls in the North-South derby, despite each side scoring three tries, with Luther Springbok scoring twice; while Boland, who took top honours last season, secured a rewarding 47-5 victory against Eastern Province, as Xavier Exquire scored two of the team’s seven tries.\n\nIn the other match-ups, Free State outscored the Pumas three tries to two for a 24-12 victory, while the Valke managed to hold off a strong challenge after the break by SWD to for a 24-15 victory.\n\nNational Girls U18 Week day one results (Monday, 3 July):\n\nBoland 46-14 Limpopo Blue Bulls\n\nFree State 22-5 Golden Lions\n\nGriquas 5-39 Zimbabwe\n\nPumas 7-32 Border Country Districts\n\nGriffons 17-7 Leopards\n\nEastern Province 20-5 SWD\n\nWestern Province 59-0 KZN\n\nBorder 25-7 Blue Bulls\n\nLSEN Week day one results (Monday, 3 July):\n\nGolden Lions EE 36-18 Griffons\n\nGolden Lions 44-7 Blue Bulls EE\n\nWestern Province 24-15 Blue Bulls\n\nFree State 24-12 Pumas\n\nValke 24-15 SWD\n\nBoland 47-5 Eastern Province\n\nSharks 5-57 Leopards\n\nLSEN Week day two fixtures (Tuesday, 4 July):\n\n09h00 – Eastern Province v Pumas\n\n09h00 – Sharks v Blue Bulls EE\n\n10h20 – SWD v Blue Bulls\n\n10h20 – Leopards v Griffons\n\n11h40 – Free State v Lions\n\n13h00 – Valke v Western Province\n\n14h20 – Boland v Lions EE\n\nIssued by SA Rugby Communications"
