        "text": "Schalk van Heerden represented Tuks in this year’s Varsity Cup and recently signed a contract extension with the Bulls.\n\nThe son and brother of Springbok greats, Moaner and Wikus van Heerden, Schalk is fast becoming a household name.\n\nRugbyfromawheelchair caught up with the burly lock to chat about rugby and his life away from the oval ball.\n\nRFAW: What school did you attend?\n\nSchalk: I attended Hoerskool Waterkloof for four years. A couple of weeks into Grade 12, I decided to move to Affies. The reason for my move was so that I could play against Grey College [as Hoerskool Waterkloof did not play Grey College during my years at the school]. I started in the fifth team at Affies and worked my way up to the 1st XV, eventually representing the 1st XV on several occasions.\n\nRFAW: Described living in a household with such South African rugby greats?\n\nSchalk: It is mostly great as they keep you humble. They know what players get arrogant about, they know what hard work it takes to make it to the top and stay there. Sometimes it is difficult as they rarely focus on the good aspects of your game but I suppose it is only their way of helping me acheive my goals.\n\nRFAW: Explain how you got injured and for how long you will be out?\n\nSchalk: I was dropped during lineout practice and landed on my ankle awkwardly, tearing the front and back ligaments of my ankle. I’m out for anything between 6-9 weeks.\n\nRFAW: What is your favoured position?\n\nSchalk: I started playing rugby at 8th man. I was utilised by Tuks at lock but I would really enjoy playing blindside flank.\n\nRFAW: Extending your contract is a big step in your professional career, tell us a bit about it?\n\nSchalk: Yes, I just felt that my future lies with the Bulls and was extremely happy to extend my contract. Next year’s goals are to make the Super Rugby squad and to play Currie Cup.\n\nRFAW: Describe winning the Varsity Cup?\n\nSchalk: Awesome! It was the first cup I’ve ever won. The squad were like a band of brothers and that’s what I think pulled us through, coupled with our experienced captain, Jono Ross.\n\nRFAW: Who is Schalk, outside of rugby?\n\nSchalk: I’m just a chilled guy who loves my family! I have a lot of goals to achieve and even more passion to achieve them.\n\nRFAW: Any words of encouragement?\n\nSchalk: Never get to big for the game and cowboys don’t cry. Simple!\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nJurie Linde and RG Snyman both hail from Affies and Rugbyfromawheelchair caught up with them to chat about the Pretoria derby, SA Schools and rugby after school.\n\nRFAW: Jurie, Boys High vs Affies is a big match, not only for the players, but Pretoria as a whole. Your thoughts?\n\nJurie: It’s always tough playing Boys High at Boys High. It’s the last game of the season so I just want to enjoy it.\n\nRFAW: Affies is going into this game unbeaten while Boys High have been competitive. What is your favourite derby memory?\n\nJurie: In 2012, the first match where we beat Boys High convincingly. It was one of my best games. The forwards provided good, clean ball for the backs. It was just a good game for us!\n\nRFAW: What are you looking forward to the most with regards to the SA Schools series?\n\nJurie: It’s going to be hard work, practising three times a day. It’s great playing other countries.\n\nRFAW: RG, your call up to the SA Schools can not be described as a surprise as your omission was widely regarded as surprising.\n\nRG: I was very surprised but I’m very excited. Playing SA Schools is something I really want to do.\n\nRFAW: RG, are you looking forward to the game between Boys High and Affies?\n\nRG: Yes, for sure. It’s always great playing in the derby.\n\nRugbyfromawheelchair caught up with the duo after the game where Affies won 50-12. Jurie scored two tries while RG also crossed the whitewash.\n\nRFAW: Congratulations on the victory Jurie, your thoughts on the game?\n\nJurie: It was my best game this season. Boys High were very physical and in our faces in the first half. The vibe was great and the support from the Affies crowd was phenomenal.\n\nRFAW: What are your plans for next year?\n\nJurie: I’ve signed with the Bulls. I plan to study but not sure what yet.\n\nRG: I have also signed with the Bulls and will be studying BA Law at Tuks.\n\n“Rugby & more”"
