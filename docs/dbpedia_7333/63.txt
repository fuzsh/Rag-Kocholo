Historical Overview of Grey College vs Affies Derbies 1953-2010

Grey College vs. Affies Interschools

The Rugby Teams of Grey College and Affies first played against each other in 1953, the same year that Affies’ legendary Springbok Louis Schmidt played in the First Team. Since 1953 Grey and Affies have met 31 times with Grey winning 23 of these encounters while 3 matches were lost and 5 were drawn (74% winning record).

Grey’s winning record against all other schools since 1966 is 95% while Affies has a winning record of 70% against all other schools which dates back to 1923. Grey produced a total of 39 Springboks to date and Affies 7 Springboks. Post-isolation Springbok counts (since 1992) are 22 for Grey and 4 from Affies. Over the last decade Grey and Affies produced the most number of senior provincial rugby players (Currie Cup, Super 14 and Vodacom Cup) than any other school in South Africa.

While Grey has a better winning record at the First Team level than Affies, it is interesting to note the strength and depth of Affies Rugby where Affies has won (on several occasions over the last two decade) the overall rugby count of all rugby matches played during the Interschools day.

The Grey vs. Affies Interschools has now evolved to be one of the Premier Interschools in South Africa and is a reflection of strength vs. strength between South Africa’s foremost rugby schools.
