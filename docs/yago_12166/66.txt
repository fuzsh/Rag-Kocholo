AXIA FILMS has announced that the film Le Pharaon, le Sauvage et la Princesse will be released on November 4. Directed by Michel Ocelot, this animated feature film is composed of three French, Turkish and Sudanese tales, and gives us an enchanting story, specific to the director’s universe.

3 tales, 3 eras, 3 universes: an epic of ancient Egypt, a medieval legend of Auvergne, an eighteenth-century fantasy in Ottoman costumes and Turkish palaces, to be carried away by contrasting dreams, populated by splendid gods, revolting tyrants, cheerful vigilantes, clever lovers, princes and princesses doing their own – in an explosion of colour.

THE PHARAOH, THE SAVAGE AND THE PRINCESS is Michel Ocelot’s ninth animated feature film, notably after his critical and public successes Kirikou (1998), Princes et Princesses (2000), Azur et Asmar (2006) and Dilili à Paris (2018 ). With this film, Michel Ocelot once again gives us a beautiful story marked by the recognizable artistic signature of the filmmaker, full of colour, intelligence and poetry.
