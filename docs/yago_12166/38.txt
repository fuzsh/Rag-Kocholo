After studies in art, Michel Ocelot has dedicated his whole career to animated films. He writes all his own screenplays and draws all the graphics for his projects. He has directed several films for companies, short series and short films. He has been President of ASIFA, the International Association for Animated Film for the last six years. In 1998, he became known to the public with his first feature Kirikou et la Sorcière, an African tale. Its success enabled him to release Princes et Princesses, a montage of ancient tales in shadow theatre format. He is currently working on a new feature film, a new tale, in a North African/Andalucian medieval setting.
