        "text": "An under-utilized Horror subgenre:\n\nFae Horror\n\nThere’s so many ways to do it! So many aspects of fae that make for solid horror concepts.\n\nBeing taken away, coming back wrong, being replaced by something else, transforming into something, the cold indifference of nature, getting tricked or manipulated, holes in the ground, feeling like you’re being watched, time moving faster while you’re gone, getting lost in the woods, games, riddles, myths and fate\n\nThere’s not a lot of examples of fae horror but here are some I have seen starting from overt fae stuff to objectively not fae but my personal interpretations\n\n- Pan’s Labyrinth – the most obvious, I think they actually use the term fairy. You even see the Court.\n\n- The Hole in the Ground – the title kind of solidified my point. Nature, holes in the ground, changeling horror\n\n- Coraline – come on, the Beldam is totally an unseelie. She takes children, and she loves to imitate real life, trick people and play games\n\n- The Midnight House – I can’t really explain this one without spoiling the whole movie, if you know you know. Basically the house and the reason for the house.\n\n- Hellraiser – the most controversial on this list but the riddles, puzzles, pain and pleasure, interdimensional beings beyond our understanding, you see what I’m saying right?\n\n- Over the Garden Wall – not technically horror but it is very spooky and fae, especially closer to the end. Another world, lost in the woods, things aren’t as they seem, The Beast loves to trick people, talking animals, Adelaide of the Pasture, and one of the main antagonists isn’t even a character, it’s the indifference of nature\n\n- Annihilation – the strange dimension, the body horror (especially the flowers scene), nature warping, the rainbows everywhere, the doubles, time warps, coming back wrong, being replaced. I think it’s a totally valid interpretation\n\nPlease add more if you can think of any! I only listed ones I have personally seen, movies I’ve only heard of before didn’t make the list but if you have recommendations or personal interpretations please share!\n\nI've been reading Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros, and it's gotten me thinking about how worldbuilding is multilayered, and about how a failure of one layer of the worldbuilding can negatively impact the book, even if the other layers of the worldbuilding work.\n\nI don't want to spoil the book for anyone, so I'm going to talk about it more broadly instead. In my day job, one of the things I do is planning/plan development, and we talk about plans broadly as strategic, operational, and tactical. I think, in many ways, worldbuilding functions the same way.\n\nStrategic worldbuilding, as I think of it, is how the world as a whole works. It's that vampires exist and broadly how vampires exist and interact with the world, unrelated to the characters or (sometimes) to the organizations that the characters are part of. It's the ongoing war between Earth and Mars; it's the fact that every left-handed person woke up with magic 35 years ago; it's Victorian-era London except every twelfth day it rains frogs. It's the world, in the broadest sense.\n\nOperational worldbuilding is the organizations--the stuff that people as a whole are doing/have made within the context of that strategic-level world. For The Hunger Games, I'd probably put the post-apocalyptic nature of the world and even the existence/structure of the districts as the strategic level and the construct of the Hunger Games as the operational level: the post-apocalyptic nature of the world and the districts are the overall world that they live in, and the Hunger Games are the construct that were created as a response.\n\nTactical worldbuilding is, in my mind, character building--and, specifically, how the characters (especially but not exclusively the main characters) exist within the context of the world. In The Hunger Games, Katniss has experience in hunting, foraging, wilderness survival, etc. because of the context of the world that she grew up in (post-apocalyptic, district structure, Hunger Games, etc.). This sort of worldbuilding, to me, isn't about the personality part of the characterization but about the context of the character.\n\nEach one of these layers can fail independently, even if the other ones succeed. When I think of an operational worldbuilding failure, I think of Divergent, where they took a post-apocalyptic world and set up an orgnaizational structure that didn't make any sense, where people are prescribed to like 6 jobs that don't in any way cover what's required to run a modern civilization--or even to run the society that they're shown as running. The society that they present can't exist as written in the world that they're presented as existing in--or if they can, I never could figure out how when reading the book (or watching the film).\n\nSo operational worldbuilding failures can happen when the organizations or societies that are presented don't seem like they could function in the context that they are presented in or when they just don't make any sense for what they are trying to accomplish. If the story can't reasonably answer why is this organization built this way or why do they do what they do then I see it as an organizational worldbuilding failure.\n\nFor tactical worldbuilding failures, I think of stories where characters have skillsets that conveniently match up with what they need to solve the problems of the plot but don't actually match their background or experience. If Katniss had been from an urban area and never set foot in a forest, it wouldn't have worked to have her as she was.\n\nIn this way (as in planning), the tactical level should align with the operational level which should align with the strategic level--you should be able to trace from one to the next and understand how things exist in the context of each other.\n\nFor that reason, strategic worldbuilding failures are the vaguest to explain, but I think of them like this: if it either 1) is so internally inconsistent that it starts to fall apart or 2) leaves the reader going this doesn't make any sense at all then it's probably failed."
