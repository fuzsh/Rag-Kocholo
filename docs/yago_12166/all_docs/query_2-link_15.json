        "text": "Excellent continuation of the TV series Cinési\n\nBefore the release and production of his incredible classic Kirikou and the Sorceress, Michel Ocelot produced a series called Cinési. Whose very simple concept was that two young people meet every evening in a movie theater where an inventor, now the cinema’s owner, has built virtual reality machines that make it possible to produce universes, costumes, sets, and characters designed according to the wishes of any participants. Thus, each evening in this abandoned cinema is an opportunity for them to tell their stories and to act out their own fables for themselves. Some free adaptations, some original stories.\n\nThese stories, compiled in the movie Princes and Princesses, were as successful as Kirikou. But before the release of these two films, Michel Ocelot continued the momentum of Cinési in a series called Tales of The Night. In that special three-part mini-series, three new stories.\n\n1- Shepherdess who dances\n\nIncredible fairy tale by Michel Ocelot. Where a shepherd and his girlfriend, both living in a Slavic or Russian country, play and dance with each other. One day, a fairy appears in front of them. Uninterested in the shepherdess, the fairy tries to invite the young man to her home. Which he refuses as he doesn’t want to neglect his friend. On several occasions, the fairy tries to woo him. But each time, he refuses her, and each time that woman’s advances become more and more threatening. At the last request, she kidnaps him in front of the shepherdess and imprisons the shepherd in the Tower of Sleep for a hundred years, during which the shepherdess will die and the fairy will have this man only for her when she returns. How will this man come out of this curse and how will the shepherdess help him? It’s up to you to see it in this magnificent adventure.\n\nInspired by a story in a book by Henri Pourrat, which I haven’t read yet, Shepherdess Who Dances follows the grand adventure of masterpieces like The Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen. Where a main male character is cursed and imprisoned by a magical being. As his friend tries to save him from his curse. And in his screenplay, Michel Ocelot takes the trouble to establish the witch’s Machiavellian plan, how it seems infallible and how she would never dare think that the young shepherdess could find a way to free him.\n\nAs in his Cinesi series, the whole episode is animated in silhouettes; with paper cuts, some silhouettes painted on acetates, and some small original effects. But this time, the effects are more extensive, some animations more fluid. Which shows how Michel Ocelot and his artists have evolved in their techniques and can produce even more innovative work. As for the music, produced by Alain Marchall and not by Christian Maire as usual, the result is just as impressive. With flutes, violins, synthesizer, and other instruments.\n\nAs for the actors, all of them are different from those in the Cinesi series, but nevertheless excellent. In particular, the actress who is the voice of the fairy. Her performance was subtle and grew alongside the anger and powers of the fairy. Reaching explosive anger when she kidnaps the Shepherd and roars her plan into the air, as she holds the prince in her hands. Throughout this scene, we realize that this is not a good fairy, but a malicious creature.\n\nAs for the Shepherdess, her imaginative way of freeing her boyfriend from his curse inside the sleeping tower is amazing and brilliant.\n\nA spectacular ending to a wonderful tale that will amaze young and old alike.\n\n2- The Prince of Jewels\n\nStill animated in cut-out paper silhouettes in addition to drawing shadows on acetates, this story is a beautiful Persian fairy tale that will delight readers of Scheherazade’s Thousand and One Nights. A tale where, in ancient times and a distant kingdom, an eagle terrorizes the land by stealing the jewels of passers-by and nobles who dare to venture outside. Meanwhile, a young man is in love with the Shah’s daughter and every evening he stands in her tree and watches her play during the night. Becoming friends with her after the latter sees him, he hopes to marry her one day, but considers this impossible since he is poor and has no diamonds to offer to the Shah who is obsessed with precious stones and who is ready to offer her daughter in marriage to the man who will bring the most beautiful jewelry. But when a questionable character proposes to our hero a project to steal together the jewels in the lair of the Eagle of the Jewels, the young man decides to take the chance. Although the princess suggests that he bewares given the questionable nature of this stranger.\n\nDoes this man really know about the Eagle’s Lair? Is he honorable in his intentions? It’s up to you to see it in this excellent episode.\n\nA story as excellent as the others by Michel Ocelot. With dialogues and quotes that people can easily remember and recite. Something that is not always present with some writers who can write scenes and dialogue in such boring ways that you can hardly remember what is said. Moreover, this memory aspect of Michel Ocelot’s text adds to the theatrical scope of his work, which is often narrated in this dramatic style. With impressive narrative twists. Especially between the eagle and the hero, who clash a few times in memorable confrontations. Especially at the end of the story.\n\nAs for the sets and backgrounds, I appreciated how the director and his team rendered the Iranian desert and its mountains. With superb colors and textures, just as present in the capital with its buildings or even the magnificent princess garden. Which is adorned with a magnificent tree. Where the moments between the hero and that lady are well composed on screen. Especially at different times of night or dawn and where the sky presents wonderful palettes.\n\nAs for the art of animation by paper silhouettes, that Michel Ocelot did that in a Persian story reminded me of Lotte Reininger’s magnificent paper cut-out cartoon, The Adventures of Prince Achmed. A masterpiece of silent animation that refers to the myths of Scheherazade; From Sinbad the Sailor to Aladin’s Lamp. And although the story of Michel Ocelot has nothing to do with that author, the director, like Reininger, shows to us the beauty of Persian culture. Well demonstrated in the beautiful music of Alain Marchall, which uses percussions, flutes, the harp, and other instruments that immerse us in this culture and tale as magnificent as that of Shepherdess Who Dances and The Old Girl and The Sorcerer. Which I recommend you to watch if you loved this adventure.\n\n3 – The Old Girl and The Sorcerer\n\nA very short episode that Michel Ocelot produced in the 1990s. Which doesn’t even last five minutes. With only two characters in an original fable. Where an obese peasant woman saves a sorcerer who rewards her with beauty and love. All in transformations that make her go from an old shrew to a lovely lady of the Court.\n\nTransformations where Michel Ocelot amazes us with his animation skills. Paper cutouts and even hand-drawn distortion and stretch effects for the transformations and acrobatics the characters do with the tree. Superb artistic work.\n\nSo while the story is short, there is still a wonderful chance for the director to do some magnificent pirouettes. Transformations that transform bodies into something new. As well as a sublime landscape that evolves before our eyes as the camera changes angles and we see the scene seen from the side through another lens.\n\nLovely nature and sublime animation that is reflected even in the water. Accompanied by wonderful harp music. Always by Alain Marchal.\n\nIn the end, a third story of magic and fantasy by Michel Ocelot that will amaze everyone."
