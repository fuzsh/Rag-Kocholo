        "text": "Synopsis\n\nTiny Senegalese hero Kirikou is back in this sumptuous follow-up to the universally beloved Kirikou and the Sorceress. Using his wits and speed, brave Kirikou once again sets out to thwart the evil Sorceress Karaba and save his village from supernatural and environmental perils. Comprised of 4 short segments and based on traditional West African folk tales, \"Kirikou and the Wild Beast\" shows how the smallest and most valiant of heroes can overcome the fiercest of beasts.\n\nMichel Ocelot\n\nMichel Ocelot (1943, France) spent his childhood in Guinea, his teenage years in Anjou and lives in Paris. After studying art, he has dedicated his whole career to animated films and personal creation. Since the very beginning, all his works have been based on his own screenplays and graphic designs. He has directed a number of animated series and short films, works which helped establish his name on the festival circuit and in professional circles (for six years Ocelot has been President of ASIFA). Animafest made a comprehensive retrospective of his work in 2009 presenting his films, all immersed in a distinct atmosphere and aesthetics owing to the technique used – silhouette animation. He directed feature films Kirikou and the Sorceress (1998), Princes and Princesses (2000), Kirikou and the Wild Beasts (2005) and Azur and Asmar: The Prince’s Quest (2006) among others."
