        "text": "The animation department at GOBELINS was born thanks to Asterix!\n\nUderzo and Goscinny were looking for young artists for the Idefix studios they had just created in 1973. They approached the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. A few months later, the \"Animated Film\" department at GOBELINS was created.\n\nIn 1976, when the first class of animation students graduated, the industry was still in its infancy. GOBELINS was then the only school to train in the techniques of animated film thanks to the enthusiasm of passionate self-taught professionals.\n\nIt was in this atmosphere that the classes of students followed one another and very quickly forged the school's reputation for excellence, each contributing to the development of projects that would mark their era.\n\nFrom decade to decade, the school has evolved its teaching, following technological advances, particularly those brought about by digital technology, while reconciling them with artistic issues."
