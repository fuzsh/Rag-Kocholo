        "text": "After setting many of his stories in distant places and bygone times, Michel Ocelot decided to dedicate a film to his own city. His penultimate feature, Dilili à Paris, is indeed a tribute to the effervescent culture of the French capital during the Belle Époque era. The chapter examines the director's aesthetic choices and messages conveyed by the film, whose protagonist was elected in 2018 as UNICEF's messenger for the empowerment of girls and their right to education. The chapter also dwells on the filmmaker's only experience in the field of live-action cinema – the short film Pablo-Paris-Satie."
