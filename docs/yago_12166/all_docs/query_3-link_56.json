        "text": "This animated film exquisitely recounts the tale of tiny Kirikou born in an African village in which Karaba the Sorceress has placed a terrible curse. Kirikou sets out on a quest to free his village of the curse and find out the secret of why Karaba is so wicked.\n\nLisa Nesselson of Variety (11/1/99) notes: \"KIRIKOU AND THE SORCERESS employs snappy visuals to tell a catchy story for all ages. A blend of African folktales \"Kirikou\" has both humor and flair.\" KIRIKOU depicts a precocious newborn infant who battles ignorance, and so-called evil, with endearing perseverance. This film speaks to the child within us all who yearns to express and defend the best in others and ourselves. KIRIKOU's stunning visuals are accented by a traditional music soundtrack by African music giant Youssou N'Dour of Senegal.\n\n\"A blend of African folktales Kirikou has both humor and flair. Kirikou and the Sorceressemploys snappy visuals to tell a catchy story for all ages.\" - Lisa Nesselson of Variety\n\n“Kids will love Kirikou and the Sorceress, an offbeat carton feature about an alarmingly brainy tot. The lesson taught by Kirikou, that an evildoer actually is someone in pain, is a good one for kids to learn early” - The Record\n\n“In its 16-year history, the Chicago International Children’s Film Festival’s two juries – one comprising children, the other adults – had never given their top prized to the same film, until last year, when both juries honored Kirikou and the Sorceress, a beautifully animated first feature by French filmmaker Michel Ocelot about an African boy’s battle with an evil witch for the soul of his people. Filled with lessons about morality, bravery, selflessness and compassion, Kirikou and the Sorceress is top-shelf family entertainment.” - Chicago Tribune.\n\n“Kirikou and the Sorceress is magic from a clear sky. Dazzlingly painted images limn forth this folklore based animated feature by French-born, Guinea-raised Michel Ocelot. A newborn toddler whose simple powers are speed, mischief and ingenuity outwits an evil sorceress who comes on like a bead-bedecked Gloria Swanson. In the best tradition of National Geographic ethnography, everyone is naked, beads apart, and the scenery is gorgeous. Kirikou and the Sorceress is funny, charming, wise, beautiful, and exciting…” Arts section - Financial Times\n\n\"Should appeal to younger children and to adults who can appreciate its quiet pleasures.\" -- Eric Harrison, Houston Chronicle"
