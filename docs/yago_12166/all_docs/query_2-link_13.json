        "text": "The French animator Michel Ocelot specializes in giving folk tales his own spin, and he does so in “Tales of the Night,” his latest modest, charming offering. A framing device involves a man considered too old for filmmaking and a pair of teenagers too young. In an abandoned theater they conjure stories, each from a different culture and ending with a twist.\n\nIn “Night of the Werewolf,” from France, the title character is trapped in animal form by a woman but rescued by her sister, who embraces him and his wolf state. “Jon Jon and Beauty Not Knowing” has a Caribbean flavor, set in a land of the dead; “The Chosen One of the Golden City” concerns an Aztec girl threatened with human sacrifice.\n\n“Tam-Tam Boy” is an African fable about an enchanted instrument and its virtuoso; “The Boy Who Never Lied,” about an innocent whose honesty is tested, offers Tibetan textures. “The Young Doe and the Architect’s Son” is a 13th-century European tale about the salvation of a girl transformed into a deer.\n\nThe narratives — involving princesses, sorcerers, dragons, talking animals — are familiar. But Mr. Ocelot invigorates them with lyricism: silhouettes evoke shadow plays, and often brilliant palettes reflect the cultures presented. “Tales” happens to be his first foray into 3-D. But his craft needed little tweaking; his gentle sensibility yields abundant pleasures by itself."
