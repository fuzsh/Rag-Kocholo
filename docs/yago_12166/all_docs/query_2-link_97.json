        "text": "Introducing Dilili in Paris, the latest animated feature from multi-award winning director behind animated gems like Kirikou and the Sorceress, Azur and Asmar and Princes and Princessses, Michel Ocelot.\n\nOcelot is back with a new film sure to delight the next generation (and, let's face it, their parents, too): Dilili in Paris, which tells the story of a young Kanak girl who comes to Belle Époque Paris for the first time from a French territory in the South Pacific. Along with a pal (delivery boy Orel), Dilili sets out to solve the mystery of the Master-Men, who have been kidnapping children and stealing jewels.\n\nIn Ocelot's signature and visually striking style, we appreciate the splendour and sights of Paris, seen for the first time through Dilili's eyes. We're also taken on a rather exciting journey through the glitterati of turn-of-the-century Paris: on her quest, Dilili rubs elbows with French creative luminaries like Claude Monet, Louis Pasteur, Marcel Proust, Marie Curie, Sarah Bernhardt, and more. If your kids like animated films with a dose of whimsy, and title characters that are determined, courageous and resilient, then Michel Ocelot's magical directing formula is sure to mesmerise and charm them. And that even tougher audience: you.\n\nThe 95-minute film features the voices of Prunelle Charles-Ambron, Enzo Ratsito and Natalie Dessay.\n\nAfter the screening on Saturday, 20 October at Ciné Lumière at 12:45, there is a Q&A with director Michel Ocelot.\n\nDilili in Paris, French with English subtitles, suitable for 8+."
