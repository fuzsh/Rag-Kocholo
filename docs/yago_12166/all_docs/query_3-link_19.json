        "text": "Magnificent fable of Michel Ocelot involving fairies, love, magic, and brotherhood\n\nAfter the success of Kirikou and Princes and Princesses, Michel Ocelot presented in 2006 a film that I have not seen for years. Azur and Asmar. The director’s first 3D animated film. Telling an original fairy tale; located in Europe and North Africa. A story of fairies, love, magic, and brotherhood.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the 13th century in France, a noble widower raised his son, Azur, under a nanny. Named Jénane, that woman also has a son named Asmar. Under her tutelage, she nurtured, cherished, and raised them as if they were her own children, just as the two see each other as brothers and she as their mother. Every evening, she tells them stories, their favorite being that of the fairy of the Djinns, who is imprisoned in a crystal cage and who can only be freed by a prince who has collected magic keys, defeated powerful animals, and travelled miles of dangers. And the day that princess will be released, she will choose the one who has delivered her as her future husband. From this story, the two brothers swear to free that fairy and marry her. But soon after, everything goes awry as Azur’s father, jealous of his son’s love for this woman and alone in his grief, chases her and Asmar away. As for Azur, he sends him to the city to study at a college. But years later, the latter decides to leave for the country of his nurse and deliver the Djinn fairy.\n\nAfter several dramas involving superstitions, Azur finally reunites with his nanny, now a powerful businesswoman in her region, and also Asmar, who still resents Azur for the way his father treated them. For both of them, she organizes their quest to find the Djinn fairy. Each working alone, but with the same resources.\n\nFor this beautiful fable of brotherhood taking place in multicultural countries and settings – France and North Africa – Michel Ocelot reproduced the architecture, costumes, customs and settings of the period. A French-speaking and Arabic-speaking medieval universe. Where he presents the meals and the vegetation in an eclectic way. Either with 3D sets, or with drawings, 2D animations, and textures added in post-production. Moreover in the case of character textures, Michel Ocelot refused to do hyperrealistic work and to over-animate or over-detail the characters as it is done at studios such Pixar. A refusal that I also understand and admire since too often animation studios tend to overfocus on their visuals and neglect the spirit of a location and the soul of a protagonist/antagonist. Moreover, when I look at Azur and Asmar, whether in the presentation of the sets or the design of the characters, I notice many parallels with the visual aesthetics of films from Soyuzmultfilm, a famous Russian animation studio. Which is quite plausible since the director is a great admirer of Russian animation filmmakers.\n\nMoreover, if Michel Ocelot kept the textures of the characters in a sober way, he nevertheless brought meticulous details to the accessories; notably Jénane’s jewelry which was designed with 3D models. But through his approach to 3D, it allows him to be closer to his interests of making puppet animation, as he did with Princes and Princesses and other cut-out films. And for fans of Princes and Princesses, Michel Ocelot reminds us of his love of silhouettes twice in this film. Particularly in a breathtaking night time moment where Azur and Princess Shamsousabbah observe the city from the top of a tree. But also when Azur and her nanny Jénane talk to each other in her new home.\n\nHowever, in a move that stunned many distributors, Michel Ocelot refused to caption the Arabic dialogues in the film. Wanting the public to be like Azur; a stranger in a new land who understands people’s dialogues according to their contexts. A gesture that did not shock the public at all; and neither did the breastfeeding scene at the start of the film. Although some journalists and distributors were outraged and refused to distribute the movie.\n\nBecause although the motion picture is a fairy tale filled with magic, action and adventure, it remains very current since it was made in the 2000s, during the United States’ War of Terror against the Middle East. From then on, the idea of ​​a film showing a breastfeeding scene, unsubtitled Arabic dialogues, and a story pleading love and respect between Western and Arab cultures did not go unnoticed in the eyes of some who saw it as a social message. So much so that when the film was shown at Cannes, a Rita Skeeter from The Hollywood Reporter accused Michel Ocelot of trying to provoke the public with this film which, according to that hack reporter, did everything to not be distributed in the United States. Which the director of course denied when he was interviewed by the same rag in another article; where he explained his intentions to unite East and West in a positive and respectful history.\n\nBecause in the end, Azur and Asmar is, and remains, a plea for love, openness and respect for European and Arab cultures. A beautiful film by Michel Ocelot which will delight the public and deserves to be seen in HD as the visual work is breathtaking. And to be well listened to since Gabriel Yared’s soundtrack is awesome and awe-inspiring, making the action epic and the beauty of the time period and locations even more magnificent.\n\nPS: In the DVD Les Trésors Cachés de Michel Ocelot, released in 2008, the director presented a special epilogue, built on a synopsis that a class of Beyrut students sent to Michel Ocelot after having seen the film. An epilogue that blew him away and which he and his team drew and produced with detailed storyboards. A magnificent finale as it adds depth and heart to the character of Azur’s father, whom I felt was a bit sidelined after the first act. With this short tale, we finally have a nice conclusion to the story of Azur and Asmar, with the original actors, Gabriel Yared, and the designers / decorators at work. An epilogue that I hope future DVDS and Blu-Rays releases of the film will someday offer and fit into the final cut."
