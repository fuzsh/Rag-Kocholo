        "text": "Michel Ocelot’s most mature-oriented storytelling\n\nMichel Ocelot’s second short film, The Legend of the Poor Hunchback is an animated film very different from the man’s previous ones. Unlike The Three Inventors and Gideon which were made with cut paper, the director made this film with stills and an incredible animation effect at the end of the story; which takes place in medieval times.\n\nIn a cold and nasty realm, a princess with a pure heart is presented with various gifts for her birthday. In the middle of a court of rotten opportunists; all trying to make marriage offers; coming from certain nobles and kings visiting the castle. In the middle of the presents, a poor hunchback tries to give the princess a bouquet of flowers. But he is constantly belittled by other visitors who crave the princess’s attention. Intimidated, kicked, mocked and spat on, the pain that poor man experiences is heartbreaking and disturbing.\n\nEspecially when, after finally gaining access to the princess with his gift, the poor hunchback is the victim of a violent assault. An attack from one of the courtiers who even goes so far as to degrade the poor hunchback in the company of the other castle guards and the kitchen staff. In a set of scenes that will stun and shock the audience.\n\nBecause indeed, of all the films directed by Michel Ocelot, The Legend of the Poor Hunchback is the one movie whose images and content I find closer to a teenage audience age range. A very mature story focusing on the evil of mankind versus the sheer goodness of a few individuals. Notably naïve and pure young people who try to live their lives in a world where others control them, prevent them from living, and hurt all who stand in front of them. Therefore, I would not consider this film for young children, but rather for older viewers (adolescents and adults).\n\nThrough powerful images and scenes, the story is presented with drawings whose backgrounds are shaded in charcoal. This allows the main characters to stand out in their actions and emotions. And as you will notice throughout the film, none of the characters express a dialogue. All respond with grunts or cries; depending on the narrative context. This allows the story to be expressed only through the image and to be understood by audiences around the world. Which is evident in the titles of the film since we see the title of the story in French, English, Italian, Spanish and German.\n\nAs for his horns, his musical keyboard and his mandolin, Christian Maire amazes us with a score that plunges us into the medieval ages. Reminds us of how in this fable, the princess is another victim of the society in which she finds herself. A pawn for her parents and her social class. Without any control over what she wants and over her life.\n\nIn short, The Legend of the Poor Hunchback is a work that people all over the world can appreciate for its universal themes. A masterpiece by two great artists; Michel Ocelot and Christian Maire. Two people whose creativity and artistic beauty in their works (music and image) are so much more impressive than what several Hollywood artists do; Indeed, so many of these american artists only repeat conventional formulas of political correctness instead of pushing their barriers and surprising their audiences .\n\nIn the end, I think that if more American artists would have the guts to do what geniuses like Ocelot and Maire did in this film, which is a story that shocks, amazes and makes you think, more people would go to cinemas to watch movies. And more viewers / artists / producers would see that cinema is not built with box office receipts, but with stories whose language and themes reach the hearts of their audiences. Which The Legend of the Poor Hunchback achieves superbly in less than seven minutes."
