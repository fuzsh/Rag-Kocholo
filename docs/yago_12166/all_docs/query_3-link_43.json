As with his past work, I expect this one will travel as well, eventually, and reach global audiences.\n\nAnother feature-length animation – his seventh – the film is titled Dilili à Paris (Dilili in Paris), and the story, of course set in Paris, follows the adventures of the titular Dilili, a mixed-race girl of the Kanak (the indigenous inhabitants of New Caledonia) during the Belle Époque era (1900-ish), who teams up with a boy her age to solve a mystery regarding little girls who are being kidnapped. They uncover a sect (comprised of adults) who are seemingly responsible for the disappearances and who the pair will have to go up against.\n\nProduction kicked off in 2015, with a 2018 completion date eyed by the filmmaker at the time. It’s animation, and it’s feature-length; these things take time, especially if it must be great, which I’m sure he’s been aiming for, as he has done with past films.\n\nWild Bunch backed the Belle Epoque drama which will first make its world premiere at the Annecy Animation Festival, which runs June 11-16 in Annecy, France. And an October 10, 2018, theatrical release date is set for France for the $7.5 million film, produced by Nord-Ouest Films and by Ocelot’s own Studio O production company. Also Arte France Cinéma, Artémis Productions, Senator Film Produktion and Mars Films are co-producers.\n\nNo word on when the film will travel outside France, but I suspect it’ll be picked up by film festivals around the world to start including several here in the USA, as has been typical for the filmmaker’s work thus far.\n\nIn the meantime, a first teaser-trailer has been released by the film’s French distribution company, Mars Films, although I should note that it’s not subtitled unfortunately, but it at least gives you a first look at the film’s visual composition and soundscape. A first poster follows the trailer."
