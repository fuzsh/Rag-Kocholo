        "text": "In 2001, Anne Hathaway came into our lives as an unlikely, thick-eyebrowed princess. Over two decades later, a lot has changed—overgrown eyebrows are cool now, for instance—but our need for The Princess Diaries content remains.\n\nHence our excitement that there is a third Princess Diaries movie in the works. In April 2024, Hathaway revealed, \"We're in a good place,\" when she was asked about the third installment. She added, \"There's nothing to announce yet. But we're in a good place.\" Here's what we know to date about The Princess Diaries 3.\n\nMost of your favorite characters would be open to returning for the franchise's third installment.\n\nBack in 2019, Mandy Moore (Lana Thomas), Heather Matarazzo (Lilly Moscovitz), Chris Pine (Nicholas Devereaux), Julie Andrews (Queen Clarisse Renaldi), and Hathaway (Mia Thermopolis) were all interested in appearing in the movie, according to Elle.\n\nIn July 2023, Sandra Oh said she'd love to return as Vice Principal Gupta. \"I am ready for the Queen. Call me! I'm dying to see how Gupta has moved up in the world,\" Oh told Entertainment Weekly.\n\nIn February 2024, John Rhys-Davies, who played Viscount Mabrey , said that he'd love to return. \"Yes, and so would the fabulous Chris Pine,\" he said. (Chris Pine played his nephew, Nicholas Devereaux.) Of his time working on the second film, Rhys-Davies shared, \"Glorious, what lovely company! What fun we had! And of course, our director [Garry Marshall] was magical. He didn’t so much direct a film, he invited some friends to come have a bit of fun and maybe make a movie while we were doing it. It was glorious.\"\n\nJulie Andrews isn't sure it's happening.\n\nIn May 2022, Andrews shared she doesn't think she'll be involved in The Princess Diaries 3. \"It would be too late to do it now,\" Andrews told the Hollywood Reporter. \"There was talk of a sequel many, many years ago. But I don’t think it ever came to pass.\" Andrews added, \"Especially [for] me, it’s too far down the line now to go back to it. It’s a lovely thought, but I don’t think it would probably be possible.\"\n\nShe echoed that a few months later, saying, \"I think we know that it’s probably not going to be possible. It was talked about very shortly after two [The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement] came out, but it’s now how many years since then? And I am that much older and Annie the princess, or queen, is so much older. And I am not sure where it would float or run. In terms of us doing it, I doubt that now.\"\n\nIn March 2024, Andrews told Today that \"there was dialogue about\" the Princess Diaries 3, but \"nothing had been realized. And I think I may be wrong, but I think it’s been shelved now. I can’t be sure.\"\n\nShe continued, \"It’s quite a long time now since the two ‘Diaries’ were done, and I’m not sure, but sometimes it’s best to leave a good thing alone. I don’t like it when people milk and milk and milk the subject, you know, 'til it’s dead.\" Still, Andrews didn't rule out the possibility of returning as Queen Clarisse. \"I’d be very happy if we did do another one, but I don’t expect to.\"\n\nThere's a script, written by Aadrita Mukerji.\n\nMeg Cabot, the author of the series the movies are based on, told EW in 2017 that she'd read a version of a script. \"There is a script for the third movie,\" Hathaway also revealed on Watch What Happens Live in 2019. \"There is a script. I want to do it, Julie [Andrews] wants to do it, Debra Martin Chase our producer wants to do it. We all really want it to happen.\"\n\nIn the same interview with Andy Cohen, Hathaway hinted at the team's reservations. \"It's just, we don't want to do it unless it's perfect, because we love it just as much as you guys love it,\" she said. \"It's as important to us as it is to you and we don't want to deliver anything until it's ready. But we're working on it.\"\n\n\"Hopefully there'll be more about Genovia,\" Cabot told Town & Country in April 2022. \"I know Disney's very interested in doing more, but, you know, we just [have to get] the gang back together. It is hard in today's day and age with everybody's busy schedules, and of course COVID is not helping.\"\n\nIn November 2022, the Hollywood Reporter broke the news that Aadrita Mukerji is penning a script for a third Princess Diaries for Disney. The film is not a reboot, rather a continuation of the series. According to sources, Hathaway does not have a deal to return, but \"the hope is she would return should the potential new film move forward beyond the script stage.\" In January 2023, Hathaway said it was \"thrilling\" to \"see the level of excitement\" surrounding Princess Diaries 3. She didn't comment on whether or not she would be part of the project.\n\nIn April 2023, Andrews was asked by Entertainment Tonight if there was \"Any movement on Princess Diaries 3?\" She quickly replied, \"Nope, none—not that I'm aware of. You have to ask somebody else.\"\n\nThe movie would likely honor late director Garry Marshall.\n\nAnne Hathaway, Garry Marshall, and Julie Andrews at the premiere of The Princess Diaries 2.\n\nMarshall, known for his work on movies like Pretty Woman and Beaches, directed the first two Princess Diaries movies. Hope for a third movie first started in 2016, when Marshall revealed that he was speaking to Disney about The Princess Diaries 3. Sadly, not long after, Marshall passed away at the age of 81."
