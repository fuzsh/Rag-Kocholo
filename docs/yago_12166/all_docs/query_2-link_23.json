        "meta_description": "This prizewinning French animated film by Michael Ocelot is about a boy named Kirikou whose tiny village in Africa has been placed under a terrible curse by the sorceress Karaba. So, to the accompaniment of a soundtrack by the Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour, little Kirikou sets out on a quest to free his village from the curse and learn the secret of Karaba's wickedness.",

        "text": "''Mother, bring me into the world,'' demands Kirikou, the infant protagonist of the animated fable ''Kirikou and the Sorceress.'' Like its tiny hero, ''Kirikou'' proceeds at its own pace, and that pace is a more willful and slower piece of storytelling than children are accustomed to getting from American animated films, in which emotional crises are worked out like story problems (if Buzz and Woody need to get to point A . . .). The director Michel Ocelot's belief in his film is as winning as his title character's confidence, even though ''Kirikou'' is probably a story more suitable for younger children than for older ones.\n\nKirikou tells his mother when he's ready to be born and then pops out, a rambunctious can-do charmer who's constitutionally incapable of being defeated. This fairy tale, based on a West African legend, sends its indomitable little-boy hero with a ridge of sculptured hair atop his head on his way to outwit the evil sorceress Karaba and her minions: grim, obedient fetish objects and a thirsty beast that consumes all the water in sight.\n\nIt's wonderful and rare to see an African landscape rendered for an animated film and not have any of the characters voiced by white mainstream American movie stars, or hear any Broadway approximations of African music. The rhythms of ''Kirikou'' are aided by the lyric pulse of Youssou N'Dour's score, which lends the story an airy exuberance. The music does some of Mr. Ocelot's work for him.\n\nMr. Ocelot's style of illustration often uses a regal rigidity. His characters are frequently captured in profile, rendered as if they were pictograms created by the artist Romare Bearden. It's a full-scale delivery of animation with its own cultural imperative. This gives the movie an odd delicacy, especially in scenes when ''Kirikou'' is most effective, as when Karaba's fetish figures -- blockish and frightening -- charge onto the screen. This scene and shots of Karaba -- her burning amber eyes match the gold jewelry she wears, tribute she has forced villagers into surrendering -- have a haunted serenity, instead of the anarchic pop-pop-pop that even the most tepid American feature-length cartoons provide."
