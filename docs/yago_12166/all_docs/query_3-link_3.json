        "text": "“Kirikou may not be tall, but he is valiant!”\n\nBefore seeing this movie, I had many hesitations. Indeed, I was expecting to see a cheesy commercial product where its artists would try again to copy the Disney animated films of the late 90s. That is to say an incongruous and illogical happy ending , dozens of songs, and an unbearable politically correct morale lesson (ex: The Hunchback of Notre-Dame). But against all odds, I discovered instead a true masterpiece … Kirikou and the Sorceress!\n\nThe story of a West African village that a witch persecutes frequently. A witch named Karaba, who ends up seeing her despotic reign shaken when a little boy named Kirikou appears. A magical child who came out his mother’s womb by himself, who ran straight to his uncle to save him from the witch, and who asked this woman why she is mean. Question and action that attracts the respect of a few people, but in general the hostility of the villagers. Constant disrespect this child will face as he tries to save his neighbours from the clutches of their wicked witch. From this woman’s attacks, but also a strange curse that has affected their water source. According to several people, another attack from the witch; which Kirikou will have to settle. Just as he will have to elucidate the secret of this woman and her wickedness.\n\nIn short, a 70-minute film that has captured the heart of the world, garnering numerous awards at animation festivals; especially those of Annecy, Chicago and Montreal. And a monetary / critical success that allowed Michel Ocelot to become an important filmmaker in French cinema. But also to make sequels (books and two films) that have further enriched the world of Kirikou. Stories that display more deeply the wisdom of a brave, magical, and resourceful young child confronting the witchcraft of an impressive and terrifying witch. A fable that unfolds at a past time. Either the Middle Ages or Antiquity. An interpretation that each member of the public can decide on their own when they see this epic series.\n\nTechnically, the animation and colours are magical. In particular the sublime backgrounds of the Savannah and the jungle recapturing the beauty of Africa which Michel Ocelot knew when he lived his childhood in Senegal. Stunning landscapes, where he tried to reproduce the precision of the painter Douanier Rousseau as he captured in his paintings each flower petal with delicacy. As for the animation, even if some animators could notice errors in the film (I know some of them who only watch films to spot their flaws and claim to themselves that they would do better when they couldn’t), they would fail not to be moved by this story. Although Michel Ocelot, as he later admitted in his book Tout Sur Kirikou, found the production of this film very difficult because of the many trips he made in the various European studios that animated the film. During which he noticed some defects in the animations (repetitions in the animations, inconsistent volume quality, bad multiplane photography for some sequences) and a quality of animation closer to the television productions than those in cinema. Something which Michel Ocelot would solve for his next films by producing them either in Paris or with his collaborator Bénédicte Galup who would check the animation of the second Kirikou film.\n\nFinally, if the wonderful music, composed by Youssou N ‘Dour, contains songs, they are not derivative Disney copies. Instead, we have beautiful African chants! Notably the famous “Kirikou is not tall, but he is valiant”. A song that has become the emblem of the series. As for the soundtrack, it’s a real pity that it was not offered in CD compilation at record stores because it is simply beautiful and impeccable. With electrifying drums and impressive flutes.\n\nIn short, this film is a true work of art that must be preserved for future generations! A masterpiece of French animation produced a real filmmaker and not by a formula corporation, and a production which the whole world should watch."
