You know that you're getting close to her, when you find diamonds in the grass. But every prince who has tried to release her from custody has disappeared without a trace...\n\n• The Fig Boy\n\nEgypt. A dreaming penniless Fellah, a miraculous fig tree that bears fruits in winter, an all powerful beautiful queen, even more sumptuous gifts, a treacherous steward, a fearsome papyrus and an unexpected twist.\n\n• The Witch\n\nThe Middle Ages. No one has yet been able to break into the witch's castle: she rips to pieces all the mighty princes who try to take it over. A boy, perched in a tree, is watching: he declares that he is going to go in and win the princess. Everybody laughs at him.\n\n• The Old Lady's Coat\n\nIn Hokusai Japan, a sweet old lady, keen on poetry, is going home at night. A robber follows her to steal her coat. But the old lady has unsuspected resources and the man is about to spend a night he will never forget.\n\n• The Cruel Queen and the Fabulo Trainer\n\nScience-fiction. A cruel queen kills her suitors with her \"megaradar\" and its deadly ray. A humble fabulo trainer (a fabulo is a strange little creature that sings) wants to take up the challenge and marry her.\n\n• Prince and Princess\n\nIn a romantic park, a romantic prince begs a romantic princess to give him a kiss. She agrees, but she has scruples. Will romanticism survive?"
