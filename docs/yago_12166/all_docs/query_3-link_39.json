Girls and women represent half our humanity. It is highly urgent to address early marriage and defend the right of girls to education. \"Let's work with the UNICEF, the National Commission for Lebanese Women and with good intentions to give girls the power of creating the future.\" He concluded by honoring the endless talent of Michel Ocelot and thanked him for his wonderful work, modesty and good heart.As for Michel Ocelot, he said: \" I came to Lebanon to present all my films one after the other. Lebanon is a fascinating country that makes me feel at ease and where I meet a lot of people that I get along with. This evening, I am overwhelmed by this huge Avant-premiere of Dilili. I thank all those who have contributed in its creation, and I thank all of you for taking the time to see my small changes on this civilization and to share the happiness of being together as men and women. My true speech will come later; it is the movie.” Michel Ocelot, French writer, character designer, storyboard artist and director of animated films known for the animated series Kirikou and Azur et Asmar came to Lebanon at the occasion of his new animated film Dilili à Paris, upon the invitation of Mrs. Claudine Aoun Roukoz, president of the NCLW and the French Ambassador to Lebanon Mr. Bruno Foucher, to close the international campaign of 16 days of activism to eliminate violence against women. Dilili à Paris is a Franco-Belgian-German animated movie by Michel Ocelot, released in 2018. It tells the adventures of Dilili, a French-Kanak girl, in the Paris of the “Belle Époque” where she investigates alongside Orel, a young deliverer in scooter, the mysterious disappearance of a number of girls who were kidnapped by a network of bandits called “Mâles-Maîtres” (male masters). The two heroes will go through extraordinary places: Montmartre, the Orsay railway station, the Eiffel Tower, and will cross fabulous characters: Sarah Bernhardt, Marie Curie, Picasso, etc. who will help them solve this mystery. In his film, Ocelot tackles many forms of intolerance, including the mistreatment of women. The filmmaker highlights the sect’s misdeeds against the girls abducted by a wicked tyrant to become slaves. \"That's what we should do: shake the audience, it's time to do it. I want to shock people a little bit.” Says Ocelot. He also emphasizes the girl-boy equality that is crucial to him. A young Métis girl and a young white delivery man join forces to conduct the investigation. Indeed, in an interview published in Le Parisien, Ocelot stresses that \"Serenity can only come from the alliance between men and women. I am one of the men who understood that it is wonderful to have strong women in front of you. \" Mrs. Aoun Roukoz and Michel Ocelot are participating in the focus group held on December 10 in the French Cultural Center on ways to introduce Dilili à Paris in schools and use it as a tool for education and communication on violence against women and the prevention of violence against girls. Ten experts, including a representative from the French association “L’Escale”, and a group of students selected by the Minister of Education will take part in the focus group and will debate the necessary methods to make sure that the message reaches students from all sociocultural backgrounds. The film will be screened in Lebanese cinemas starting January 10.\n\nCategories"
