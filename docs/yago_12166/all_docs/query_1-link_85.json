        "text": "Princess is a 2008 fantasy tv movie directed by Mark Rosman and written by Heidi Ferrer. It follows down on his luck William who wins a date with a mysterious Princess named Ithica, who believes him to be a long-awaited saviour of her castle’s most treasured secrets.\n\nPrincess, is a movie not many people have heard of, but that is quite common with tv movies. Now this movie isn’t without its problems, but given the fact it is just a simple little flick there isn’t that much to be expected from it, so it is not as though it is failing to meet the audience’s expectations. If anything, I feel it delivers what it intends to, the only way it might fail to meet viewer expectations is because of the IMDB synopsis. It is the only synopsis I can see readily available and it completely fails to describe this movie accurately. It gives a long description that essentially describes the start of the movie and spends too much time explaining an irrelevant character, leaving only a vague sentence to describe the overall plot and main character. So basically, it tells you absolutely nothing. I’ve tried to remedy this fact and I hope that my description leads people to far more realistic expectations of the movie.\n\nA problem I found with Princess is that it takes a really long time to get to the point and really allow you to understand our main character Princess Ithica (played by Nora Zehetner) what she’s about and what this movie is about. We don’t really know who she is and what the point is until roughly 1 hour in and by then there’s only 30 minutes left on the clock, so by that point the rest feels rushed. In a way, I feel as though the film is trying to keep the audience engaged by keeping the mystery going, believing people will stick around just to get the answers they want. But, if you’re going to make people wait that long you really need to give them more of a payoff, and I don’t feel this movie does that. Princess Ithica isn’t a princess in the traditional sense, she is a Healer, a person born and destined to be granted the gift to communicate and heal all creatures of the mythical world, sadly this fact seems slightly overshadowed by a rocky love story. Ithica, has just one week to find the next person to take her place and she believes William (played by Kip Pardue) is just the man to do it. She believes him to be a Searcher, like many before him whose duty it is to search for next Healer and bring them to the castle to fulfil their destiny. Well he for most of the movie is just a guy going along with the charade because he is falling for the Princess, but naturally ends up being the real Searcher in the end, though he really sucks at his job.\n\nI do enjoy that this movie combines fairy tales, mythical beings and the real world and in a way it does feel believable. I think the fact Princess Ithica spends her time walking around dressed like a real Disney Princess does make it just a little less believable and does remind me more of Enchanted, when all the enchanted characters are in the real world and everyone else is just like WTF. So yes, it is a little out there and strange, but on the other hand the costumes they made her were absolutely stunning and if you are someone who loves Disney fairy tales then you will find it charming, because I think many girls, and even some boys looked at those princesses and wanted to dress like them and be them. In one seen a group of little girls dressed as princesses for a birthday party see the princess just casually walking by in her gown and they were in absolute aw. I think that’s what the movie was trying to do, remind little girls and some boys of that magical feeling. Does she stand out like a sore thumb? Absolutely, but at the same time you can’t take your eyes off her, really those costumes were gorgeous. Also, it’s a different take on the typical fairy tale story, instead of a regular girl falling for Prince Charming and becoming someone special we have a regular guy falling for an enchanting princess and him becoming someone special. On top of that we have a princess who has a real duty and purpose, she doesn’t just walk around and look pretty and wait around to get married as in most stories, in this she’s assigned with taking care of magical creatures from all over the world. She carries their secret and keeps them alive, which is pretty darn awesome.\n\nI honestly wish her duty and those creatures were more of a focus of the movie and less about this couple falling for each other after him conning her, cause it’s not really that romantic. Neither is William’s friend Louis. Louis (played by Matthew Edison) is an extremely annoying irrelevant character. He’s like the devil on William’s shoulder, he lives vicariously through William encouraging him to lie and con a sweet young woman and insults her constantly despite knowing nothing about her, all because he’s married and has a baby on the way and can’t run around and have fun anymore. It’s really sad and pathetic and irritating to watch, had he not been a factor I think the movie would have been able to focus more on Ithica and the world she protects instead of them having to rush it in the last 30 minutes.\n\nOverall this is a pleasant movie, one the whole family can watch together. Just sit back and enjoy it without a care in the world, which not many movies can do and while there are certain aspects I wish were better or not there at all I still appreciate the overall concept. You don’t have to dwell on things or try too hard to understand it as this is a pretty straight forward movie, and the throwing in of a mermaid didn’t hurt either so for all the reason’s above I give Princess a rating of 3/5 crystal balls."
