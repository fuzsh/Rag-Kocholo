Princes et princesses (2000) is a silhouette animation by Michel Ocelot, his second feature-length film. It is a compilation of 6 of the 8 12-minute episodes of the series Cin√© si, originally broadcast in 1989 and animated by La Fabrique. The feature film version was compiled in 1999 and went on general release in France on the 26th of January 2000. In Japan it was translated and is released on DVD as part of the Ghibli Museum Library. Each episode/segment is a self-contained fairy tale, the only link being that the main characters are always played the same animated "actors", having the same voices and, in most cases, the same physical appearance.

Each tale is preceded by the actor-animators (a boy and girl, and old man and a talking bird) discussing, and often disagreeing about the story they are about to perform. The stories themselves, while all appearing to be traditional fairy tales, are sometimes in highly unconventional settings (one seemingly influenced by Yakov Protazanov's Aelita) and all have surprise endings.
