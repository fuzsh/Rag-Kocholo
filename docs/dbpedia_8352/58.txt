Draupadi

From the second offering in the yagya performd by Drupad a full-grown daughter emerged, whose dazzle blinded the eye. She was Draupadi. WhenDraupadi emerged from the fire there was an oracle that she would side with God against the evil Kauravas.

She was born omniscient (Sarvagna, All Knowing), adorned with all the ornaments, youthful, she does not have old age and she is the most beautiful woman in the three worlds. She had the special presence of Uma in her. She possessed all the auspicious physical features.

In Mahabharatha it is mentioned in couple of places that Draupadi is the incarnation of Parvati. Its implication is explained here by using the word "umAMshayuktaa nitaraaM". Meaning though she had the presence of Shaci, Shyamala, Usha, one of the chapters in LakshaaLaMkara explains that presence of Parvathi was greater than the other three:

Draupadi of the Mahabharata In Hindu mythology, few women stand out as much as the character of Draupadi. Draupadi is the wife of the five Pandava princes in the Hindu epic the Mahabharata; she is a heroine who is unpredictable, unwavering and who could also possess the austerity of a traditional Hindu wife. Many see Draupadi as an early feminist because of her fearlessness in admonishing those who harmed her or her family. Draupadi existed in a time when a woman's role was to serve herhusband.

The unique relationship between Draupadi and her husbands is what makes her story so exceptional. Draupadi, the wife of the mighty Pandava brothers was anything but a conventional wife; she was smart, bold and would often lead her husbands into action. Draupadi's fearlessness and uncompromising nature makes her of great importance in the history of mythological women and of women today.

Draupadi, meaning daughter of Drupad, was known by several other names as well. As the princess of the kingdom of Panchal she was known as Panchali. As the grand daughter of Prushata she was known as Parsati. ( Draupadi is ayonija, not born of woman). Draupadi is born of fire and therefore, often referred to as Yagnyaseni. She is also called Krishnaa because she was copper skinned, fiery eyed and had long, black hair. She was gifted with blue-lotus fragrance wafting for a full kosha (2 miles) and hence was called Yojanagandha (she whose fragrance can be felt for miles). Draupadi alone enjoys the unique relationship of sakhi with her sakha Krishna. She was a true virgin, and has a mind of her very own.

After this Spectacular Performance She moved to next Powerful Preference ⭐️🔥

Pooja Sharma aka Draupadi of Mahabharat fame has been roped to play the titular role. It also has Saurabh Raj Jain playing the role of Lord Shiva who is popularly known for playing Krishna in Mahabharat.

The show is created by Siddharth Kumar Tewary of Swastik Productions. He has created several successful shows like Mahabharat, Suryaputra Karn, Shani etc.

The show is the first show ever to be made entirely on Kali showcasing her journey from Parvati to becoming the fierce warrior. The show also deals with the theme of women empowerment and gives out a message to all the women that they need to find their inner strength and must not depend on men, irrespective of their relationship and should therefore be able to fight for themselves and to tackle their own problems without their need of a man. This show features Kali.

Commenting on essaying the dual roles of Goddess Parvati and Maa Kaali, actor Pooja Sharma said, "It's difficult enough to play one mythological character and bring alive her charm and aura; I am challenged with two such characters Parvati and Kaali Maa. Their contrasting personalities make the entire experience very enriching and satisfying for me, as an actor. While Parvati is calm and composed, Kaali is untamable...a destroyer of evil. I am really looking forward to my role and hope it proves to be a glorious one in my resume⭐️

Waiting for her comeback ver much with another power project she left the space of Acting along with her which mostly lacking nowadays @ screens ⭐️
