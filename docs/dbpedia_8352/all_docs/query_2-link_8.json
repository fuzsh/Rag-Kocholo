        "text": "Actor Falaq Naaz's character in Siddharth Kumar Tewary's Mahakaali: Anth Hi Aarambh Hai, is a different take on Goddess Saraswati. The actor, who has been part of shows like Gunahon Ka Devta, Lagi Tujhse Lagan, Khamoshiyaan and Sasural Simar Ka, says that this is the first time that Saraswati is being portrayed like this on screen.\n\nSays Falaq, \"The speciality of the character of Saraswati in the show is that she has two variations. The first is the Saraswati that everyone knows - calm and composed. And the second variation is when Parvati tells her to get her inner strength out, against all the demons and evils. So then she turns into this hyper and strong Bhramini. She also enters the war to fight against the demons. It is a very different kind of Saraswati which will be seen for the first time on screen.\"\n\nNeedless to say, her look in the show is elaborate and it takes time for Falaq to get ready every day. \"It takes maximum one and half hours to get ready. Initially, when we were setting up the look, it used to take almost eight to nine hours to sit and get ready. But now, we have got the habit of wearing everything and of the makeup, so it has become easier now,\" she says.\n\nHowever, despite its challenges, Falaq loves to be part of a costume drama. \"I think when you are doing any normal daily soap, you are basically playing an ordinary everyday character. But when you are doing a mythological show, you get to play a whole new character, who you have just heard about in stories. So it is really an amazing experience,\" she says.\n\nTalking about working with Swastik Productions and Siddharth, she says, \"It is superb and amazing. Siddharth Sir is that kind of a producer who is there on the sets for everyone. He is very helpful and he makes his actors feel confident about their craft.\"\n\nShooting for the show has been memorable, says Falaq. \"The whole journey till now has been memorable. And it will be in the future as well because everyone in the team is superb, especially, Pooja Sharma who is Mahakaali and Nikita Sharma who is Laxmi. We have bonded very well now,\" she adds.\n\nAsk her what her fans will love in the show and she says, \"Firstly, it is a woman oriented show, it is all about women empowerment. Secondly, it shows a different perspective of the Goddesses, which has been done for the first time on the television. And lastly, everyone, especially Pooja Sharma, who is playing Mahakaali, has taken a lot of efforts for the role. So please watch the show and give us all your support and love!\""
