Your poojas instilled so much peace in me. The poojas performed were wonderful and Mayank ji kept me informed regularly. Things have been a little calmer. I was in a dark place before and now feel Matarani is watching over me. I continue to implore you for help and happiness through poojas and mantras.\n\n- Bhavna B., UK, 3-Aug-2024\n\nAlready successful\n\nThank for the Ganesh Puja!

I really appreciate it and will be purchasing another Puja very soon.\n\n- R. Scott, USA, 12-July-2024\n\nVery good experience\n\nI am very happy and elated by the puja / havan experience, pandit ji took my Sankalpa exactly on time as promised. Numerous pictures and videos sent by Mayank ji via WhatsApp, timely updates. Feeling very good and blessed. Definitely would recommend to everyone living anywhere in the world. Even Muhurta time & date were flexible and changed when requested. Catered all my needs.

I wish I was there to do it in person. Thank you for keeping me posted throughout the proceedings. I really was not expecting this at all. Puja is beautifully done. I remain amazed by the elderly Brahmin with the white beard every time you send me photos. He is truly inspiring even from so far away as are the youngsters. You have some beautiful souls there.\n\nAfter the completion of the Saturn yagya, was the first morning I had no palpitations. Last night was the most restful sleep I have had in a long time. Today, after the completion of both pujas, my heart feels lighter, and my breathing is much better. Most of all I had no palpitations, no tiredness, nothing. I just feel a sense of peace.\n\nI am so grateful for your guidance and the phenomenal dedication of all your Brahmins as they do these pujas to help souls like us and for your service to humanity as a whole. Because, as one of us benefits from this work, we can pass on that benefit to others.\n\nWith love, respect and gratitude to you and your team\n\n- L.P., UK, 22-April-2024\n\nFeel positive\n\nThank you!

It‚Äôs hard trying to chant all different planets at certain times and I don‚Äôt know how to worship each one. They were fast to schedule me and talked about any questions and concerns. I could also feel certain area of my body when they did puja for each planets. Thank you for the services.\n\n- Audrey Jenkins, USA, 25-May-2023\n\nVery pleased\n\nThank you very much for everything. Your clear and timely communications are reassuring when we are far away. The pictures depict care and attention to the puja. We had our thirteen day puja done by a different puja person and they did not do what they were offering us. So, I am very pleased to have found you and your Puja services for the transparency and respect associated with why we do pujas in the first place.\n\n- PW, USA, 30-Apr-2023\n\nA+ service\n\nExtremely well done and reported. Kept me in the loop and advised me of each and every step in the Puja. I highly recommend their services.\n\n- Roby Grewal, Canada, 28-Mar-2023\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart!\n\nNearly after a year, I circled back to Eshwar Bhakti - regret waiting on it for so long. Well, they say it's never too late. When I called Mayanki ji, he instantly recognized me and enquired about how I was doing. Knowing someone is there to listen to your problems and provide a bespoke/custom solution for you that works in your favor is a true blessing. After Mayank ji‚Äôs guidance, I opted for Jupiter puja & havan in Oct 2022 - I saw positive results in my work by December 2022. In less than a year of my co-ordinator role at my company, I was promoted and my work was being recognized - which for me was a miracle. Over and above that, when I reach out to Mayank ji, asking for solutions on my other issues, he provides practical solutions based on actions and not emotions.\n\nI have booked another Navchandi puja this week, and I can‚Äôt tell you all how excited I‚Äôm, feeling positive and looking forward to invoking Mata rani‚Äôs blessings.\n\nWith immense gratitude, I want to thank Mayank ji and his team of extraordinary acharyas who did the prayers/chanting and havan for me, with such shraddha & shuddhi. I felt like I was there. Feeling grateful and blessed to have found Eshwar Bhakti :)\n\n- Teena Punjwani, USA, 1-Mar-2023\n\nVery touched\n\nThank you very much Mayank ji and the Pandits who did this puja for Rohin. I am extremely grateful and very touched at everyone‚Äôs dedication and kindness for reciting the chants, Havan and prayers. I have listened to the clips a few times now and very touched. May God Bless Rohin and also your team for making this happen in such an auspicious occasion of Maha Shivratri. We are truly Blessed. Many many thanks again. With kind regards to all in the team.\n\n- T. Saluja, USA, 18-Feb-2023\n\nWould 100% recommend\n\nVery professional, quick, and satisfactory. I am so happy to have found Eshwar Bhakti.\n\n- Anthony C., USA, 14-Jan-2023\n\nWish fulfillment puja\n\nI approached Mayank and told him about a particular concern, they performed a powerful wish fulfillment yagya and everything started to turn in my favour. I can give my word, just trust them and share your birth details and concern and rest assured they will find a solution for you.\n\n- P. Acharya, Australia, 30-Dec-2022\n\nPujas are helping me a lot\n\nThank you, it looks wonderful, very impressive. Thanks to the priests who did the ceremony. Your Poojas are helping me already a lot. I am not feeling tired any longer. I feel much better and focused. Please keep helping people the way you do!\n\n- Ana Maria, Germany, 24-Nov-2022\n\nThank you for putting lots of time and efforts\n\nI felt something around my throat area when you were doing the process. Good videos and pictures from the services. I can tell all the priests have put their heart and soul into it. Good communication with emails and they answered several direct questions and concerns. I can concentrate better and when I approach people they care to listen. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\n- Audrey J., USA, 12-Oct-2022\n\nFeed elephant service\n\nWas a great experience to feed the elephant. He was very happy after eating bananas and sugar cane and it is good to see him put on some weight during the last one month of feeding. Elephants are definitely beautiful creatures.\n\n- Shyamal K., UAE, 1-Oct-2022\n\nVery very touched\n\nThank you very much for completion of Poojas for my late parents and thank you for using my parent's pictures. Many many thanks to all the Pujaris, my sincerest thanks!! Very touched, appreciative, grateful and thankful and I pray that both my mother and father reap the blessings!! We are truly very grateful and very thankful for the much needed Puja.\n\n- Taran B., USA, 21-Sep-2022\n\nSpiritual experience\n\nI want to thank you very much for an amazing and spiritual experience. I have used other services as well and by far this experience was the best. I very much appreciate you guiding us through in English. I will use your services going forward as we keep doing pujas throughout the year. Please thank all the Brahmins, it felt very personal, we knew they were praying for our family. Thank you kindly and I will be in touch soon.\n\n- Debbie Ramkerrysingh, Canada, 8-Aug-2022\n\nA true miracle\n\nNamaste. Thank you so much for all your pure hearted help. I could not attend the online Sankalpa, and just went to the local temple with fruit prasada and for darshan. I had Shiv Ji Bhagwan's darshan outside my son's room, starting last night until this morning, for the whole duration of the Puja. A true miracle of His Holiness. May the grace of God always be with you, the pure hearted one in this world.\n\n- R. M., UK, 24-July-2022 (initials used to protect privacy)\n\nAbsolutely wonderful!!\n\nThank you to all of the wonderful people that assisted with my Puja. I was not sure what to expect since it was my first time. Mayank was so kind to always keep me updated and send me videos and photos. I am feeling really wonderful afterwards! I will definitely be back for more! I highly recommend the divine reading after the puja! It‚Äôs very accurate, so insightful and positive! I completely understood everything on a deep level. I look forward to continued growth.\n\n- Cynthia M., USA, 7-July-2022\n\nAn honest opinion!\n\nI‚Äôll give an honest opinion. They are very very genuine & provide the best service. You‚Äôll definitely feel positivity & a strong connection with divine. They perform everything with proper rituals with experienced pandits. I‚Äôll definitely keep coming back. God bless.\n\n- Dhruv Srow, UAE, 18-June-2022\n\nUnbelievable gift\n\nThank you so much for the Mahamrityunjaya puja and the daily puja. The energy flowing is so unbelievably wonderful and I am so thankful to have the opportunity to receive this blessing. A big Thank you for your work and your prayers. This is an unbelievable gift for me. All the best to you and the priests.\n\n- Melanie Schuppler, Germany, 3-June-2022\n\nWinds suddenly became extremely powerful\n\nWow, Goyal ji. This is absolutely amazing. I never imagined that the Puja would be this powerful. I am feeling much satisfied with this Puja and so glad that I reached out to you. Something interesting to share, when you mentioned the Havan has begun, the winds suddenly became extremely powerful. I have not seen the weather like this in a long time. I have so much respect for you and all the gurujis that have performed such a Havan for our health and happiness. This is truly a moment of peace and joy for me. I am quite emotional right now. Thank you for the great Puja and ashirwad. I feel very blessed.\n\n- Sarbjit Budwal, Canada, 16-May-2022\n\nCredit to our culture\n\nReally pleasing to see that the ceremony was performed so well. Please accept my deepest gratitude Mayank and to the Brahmins that performed this puja. It was lovely to see Lord Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga as well during the video. Excellent service provided. Mayank and his team are a credit to our culture.\n\n- Shyamal K., UAE, 21-Apr-2022\n\nHeart Chakra balancing\n\nI am grateful to the Eshwar Bhakti Team that this service is even available worldwide. I didn't personally intensely feel anything but events in my life reflected a change had occurred. Almost immediately after the puja was performed, an unexpected event and opportunity occurred at the place where I work. Afterwards almost everyone I work has a more positive attitude towards me. Another unexpected event is that a few of my family members who I don't get to see often enough came to town. I feel it is always a blessing when life provides you an opportunity to spend more with people that you love. I would recommend the Heart Chakra Puja to anyone who feels lonely or isolated in their life. I feel the Divine and those who help connect with it are there to help us who are struggling.\n\n- EJL, USA, 6-April-2022 (initials used to protect privacy)\n\nSo Ecstatic\n\nWow Goyal ji. This is beyond my expectations. May God bless my brother, all the priests, and you for making this possible. I don‚Äôt have enough words to say Thank you. Although, I was not there physically but just seeing these pics and videos makes me feel so ecstatic.\n\n- Rajwinder M., Canada, 27-March-2022\n\nOverwhelmed\n\nWe are overwhelmed with the service provided by Eshwar Bhakti.

Thank you for offering 56 varieties of Prasada. We are so humbled and touched by the Pujas in the last 7 days and specially today. Thank you for the beautiful Puja, Havan and Blessings. It has brought a lot of peace to us and greatly indebted to all the Pujaris for the Blessings and the prayers. We feel our parents are more at peace after the Pujas. This means a lot to us and we are very fortunate to have been connected with Eshwar Bhakti. We are truly appreciative and thankful to God for showing us the way because honestly we could not have done this on our own specially being in the US, we have limited Vedic knowledge and not easy access to temples and Pujaris. Our humble and infinite thanks to all. We have no words to express our gratitude and thankfulness. Much appreciation and regards!! Almost in tears and feel very Blessed.\n\n- Taran and family, USA, 21-February-2022\n\nBest service\n\nI have been a consistent customer to Eshwar Bhakti.

I am very happy with their service.\n\n- Dixita P., USA, 11-February-2022\n\nPeaceful after Baglamukhi Homam\n\nEshwar Bhakti seemed very authentic and approached them for eliminating negative energies bothering my family. All the preists have put immense effort in performing the Baglamukhi puja and havan for two days. While wearing the Baglamukhi kavacha locket, I felt warm energy in my heart and spine. And it's just two days, I really feel lot more peace. I am also able to meditate very peacefully after wearing the locket. I struggled to meditate in the past. I have never felt like this before. Lots of gratitude for the entire team and their devotion to the divine and for their services. Thank you so much ..!!üôè\n\n- Manu, Telangana, India, 3-February-2022\n\nHighly recommend\n\nHaving done multiple yagyas and pujas through Eshwar Bhakti ...

Thank you for all your hard work in providing the puja and havan service to sanctify the Rahu planet in my birth chart. I appreciate it very much. During the first day of the puja it was midnight in Canada and I felt that the darkness that was blocking me was being purged, cleansed and removed from me. Also, the second day puja was a good night in Canada for me as I slept well. And after the completion of the puja I felt my anger, my hatred, my negative thoughts and hurt was all lifted from my mind. I am calm, clear and full of compassionate thoughts. I feel like the toxic sludge of dark karma lifted from me. I hope to do more puja with the Eshwar Bhakti team, Masters of Tantra.\n\n- Ganesh V., Canada, 15-April-2020\n\nHigh energy\n\nThanks for arranging the Ketu vedic puja.

My best wishes and blessings for all of you there.\n\n- Tajesh Sharma, Australia, 27-March-2020\n\nDelivered results which other priests couldn't do even after 10 years\n\nI started to see the result in a matter of few days upon the completion of my Das Mahavidya Maha yagya. My health is good and there is a lot of mental peace. I had darshan of Durga devi and received all my answers. The local doctors wanted me to be in hospital but now whatever I say they listen. I have more money left than ever before and all the people who were trying to perform black magic on me have disappeared suddenly. Mayank ji and his team of pandits have done what I have been asking other pandits through several websites in the last 10 years. I am now a loyal bhakt of Eshwar Bhakti. Just give them your birth details and they will suggest you the best yagya for any problem. Trust Mayank ji and his pandits to fulfill your desire quickly.\n\n- Pradyum Acharya, Australia, 21-February-2020\n\nReally appreciate your timely and much needed gift!\n\nDuring the week you were healing, I did feel more tired than usual as I slept about 11 - 12 hours every night. Maybe, my body was releasing a lot of stuff to make room to integrate your healing energy. Although I didn‚Äôt notice any other sudden changes, I‚Äôve been feeling other more subtle benefits. For example, my body seems more efficient at processing food and feels like it's gradually becoming stronger on less food. My stomach doesn‚Äôt really bother me at all when I sometimes eat food that it‚Äôs sensitive or intolerant to. I still feel something stuck in my throat. Though this feeling is diminishing. I feel that I may need it a few nutritional supplements.\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been feeling an increase in my personal power and decision-making ability. I‚Äôm improving at setting boundaries, dropping beliefs & other things that no longer serve me, following my intuition, receiving blessings and taking appropriate action when necessary. Those all sound like the domain of the 3rd chakra, relates to the stomach.\n\nIt feels like whatever was blocking my ability to manifest the type of work I desire is disappearing for good. Once again, I really appreciate your timely and much needed gift!\n\n- Lyndon, USA, 20-February-2020\n\nDie hard fan!\n\nThanks a million for being so brutally honest. It is very hard to find people like you in India. I have become a die hard fan of yours. I know you are a pure soul and will help me.\n\n- Mukesh B., India, 3-February-2020\n\nFavourable opportunities\n\nI thank the Eshwar Bhakti team, especially Mr. Mayank and Vimal ji for their individual approach and quality work. After carrying out the puja rituals and with the power of Wealth Talismans, my life has changed: obstacles in business have disappeared, favorable opportunities for spiritual and financial growth have appeared. I wish you all prosperity and blessings of the Divine Mother and Father.\n\n- Tatiana G., Russia, 13-January-2020\n\nAbsolutely amazing Wealth Talismans\n\nFaith is to believe in what you cannot see. Within 15 days of receiving my Wealth Talismans from nowhere I got a new job with a very good financial package. I highly recommend all services from Mayank and PujaYagna.\n\n- N.B., Ilford, UK, 12-January-2020\n\nFree Healing service\n\nWow! Thank you so much, Mayank. This is very kind.

This experience was easy and enlightening.\n\n- Jason McIntosh, USA, 10-January-2020\n\nGot an offer!\n\nI played this mantra yesterday and today. This afternoon, I got an offer for my flat. I already had the previous sale fall through. So, thank you so much for this pooja, I pray this sale goes through, but either way thank you and God bless you for taking the time to post this pooja and help other people.\n\n- Hina Soni, YouTube subscriber, 7-January-2020\n\nBrahmins Bhojan\n\nIt feels nice to feed brahmins on your website, because if there are brahmins then they give boons for health and wealth and to beget children.\n\n- Kunjal T., U.K., 25-December-2019\n\nWealth Talismans\n\nPlease accept sincere bow to you and all the Brahmins for all the good work that you do.

She is feeling happy, as though given parole for good behavior from prison. I felt her whisper to me if I needed anything and just checking up on me. Then suddenly out of nowhere I heard a crow‚Äôs voice for a brief few seconds in real-time. I haven‚Äôt heard or seen any crows ever in that area before. Thank you for the Shraadh Puja that you did for my ancestors on September 14th. My humble bow to you and all the Brahmins who participated.\n\n- Yuri Mayorchak, USA, 27-September-2019\n\nAwesome services\n\nGreat Powerful Pujas, Keep up the Good work Mr. Mayank and all the Priests involved.

You Sir, are the only person who truly knows the inner struggle I am going through. I thanked you personally in our 1st phone conversation but even so I wish that you may kindly accept my \"never enough\" and \"humble words\" of \"deep gratitude\" and \"love\" for sharing such caring and precious messages! All your messages carry such a profound feeling and meaning to me, specially the phone calls! It truly shows how kind, caring, loving, genuine (there are so many beautiful words...), magnificent, divine heart/person you truly are. You have \"touched\" my heart and my soul since the beginning, Mr. Goyal.\n\nI am so blessed to know you and I wish (my poor words will never be enough!), to thank \"Mother Goddess as well as Lord Shiva to show me the way to you, Mr. Goyal !\". You are like a \"gem\" to me. I will keep you in my heart! Thank you soo much, Mr. Goyal ! (I am crying all over the place!!!).\n\n- Daniel M., Portugal, 21-September-2019\n\nBetter relationship with my Boss\n\nMy relationship with my boss has taken new turn for the better.

May God bless them.\n\n- Dushyant, Australia, 19-October-2018\n\nI knew it is working\n\nIt was a great experience to have this service done for me. From the first of nine days of the recitation after taking Sankalpa I knew it was working because I could feel shivers on my skin from time to time. Panditji had a lot of work to do praying for my ancestors because my bloodline karma is very heavy. On the last ninth day five pandits were doing Puja in my name and I felt a great relief - it was like a heavy load was off. Thank you www.pujayagna.com for great help. God willing I will order this service again.\n\n- T. Sosnina, UK, 12-October-2018\n\nPut be back on track\n\nLately I found it very difficult to follow Ekadashi practice.

Thank you very much for your help.\n\n- Tamara, UK, 16-September-2018\n\nThank you sooo much\n\nI like the level of professionalism about the procedure of the prayer.

I shall order more soon.\n\n- Emilie B., Australia, 8-August-2018\n\nHonest and efficient service\n\nIt has been a real pleasure to commission the services of Mayank, at all times he has answered my doubts quickly and clearly.

Highly recommended, I will surely request your services again.\n\n- Jose R., Spain, 31-July-2018\n\nVery professional service\n\nPictures of the ritual were sent to me on the day the service was promised.

Mayank has been more than responsive to my questions and always prompt. The DVD and Prasad were shipped and delivered in a timely manner. I watched the entire DVD, and felt tears rolling my eyes and was pleased to know the reverence and grace with which this was accomplished by Pundits of Eshwar Bhakti.\n\nI am grateful! for such beautiful institutions in India that enable people like me who live so far away to accomplish and fulfill much-needed obligations. It's a real Punya for Mayank to be able to be the founding father of Eshwar Bhakti.\n\n- Anagha, USA, 13-June-2018\n\nWas able to buy a new Home\n\nI want you to thank you for the spiritual work you did for me in the past. The Hindu prayers you did on my behalf worked. I was able to buy a new home and moved from one end of the United States to another. A journey that took me 5 days of travelling through scary mountain passes to reach Washington state, near the border of Canada. At times I got really scared, especially when driving through thick fog at night, so I just called on the help of every deity name I could remember to get me safely to my new home, and it worked.\n\n- Hedy McCray, USA, 6-June-2018\n\nExcellent service to details\n\nIt was a pleasure to work with Mayank and how the cow donation service is handled by Eshwar Bhakti. I was informed on what to expect in advance, recommendations about diet fasting and Sankalpa were made which I had time to follow and I could call and connect with the priest at the time of Puja. Pictures and Video of the puja were emailed to me. - with gratitude towards the availability of this service.\n\n- Anagha, USA, 18-May-2018\n\nExcellent service\n\nReally good service, prompt and helpful responses.

He must be one of the Sakhas (friend) of Lord Krishna in Vrindaavan along with other Gopalas during \"Krishna-Avatar\" age. Otherwise, who has time to do this kind of laborious work as per vedic-scriptures ... when you may use your time and intellect to get rich and wealthy. MayankJi ..... you must be blessed by HIS divine grace and bliss, to continue this legacy to serve. God bless you and all. JAY BHOLE!\n\n- Bipin Patel, USA, 7-April-2018\n\nOut of the way\n\nThank you Mayank ji for always being there and going out of the way for your clients.\n\n- S.

Success rate is 100%. Well indeed a very interesting result. Very good result, I should say ! I am grateful and satisfied with the result.\n\n- Michael B. , Austria, 15-March-2018\n\nFantastic experience!\n\nThis was the 1st time I've ordered a cow feeding and it was lovely. There was also an emotional cleanse at the beginning and end was uplifting and cathartic.

I am beyond belief grateful and wanted you to know this. I wish Krishna and Radha to be always by your side and for you to receive all their blessings, without reservation.\n\n- Oksana , Russia, 26-Feb-2017\n\nExcellent service\n\nProfessional and efficient service with great communication throughout every step of the process. Unfortunately, I was unable to reach the priest for Sankalpa, but I received immediate followup from Mayank. The package with prasad and DVD arrived in a timely fashion. Very satisfied and would certainly utilize the service again. Keep up the good work.\n\n- Kevin N. , USA, 11-Feb-2017\n\nCherry on top of cake\n\nThank you for conducting Gau seva on my behalf.

You can always count on professional, prompt service at this business. In the context of SEVA or selfless service, the service is something that will create memories to remember for life times.\n\nThe staff have a demeanor of service that is incomparable to the service industry, I have realized. The yagna, homa services can be customized to your exact specification. The services rendered to me have created a new sense of belief in me relating to the business, it's products, it's knowledgeable and dynamic staff. Shop with them!.\n\n- Raymond Earl Watson Junior, USA, 18-Dec-2016\n\nClosed a Real Estate Deal\n\nThe service provided by Eshwar Bhakti and team is excellent. I always receive detailed follow up photos of the yagnas/homas that I order. I have also noticed some positive effects in my life after the yagnas, as an example: I was able to close on a real estate deal and retrieve the money that I had invested in 2012, otherwise I feel as though I would of lacked the grace of Gods to conjure up enough intuition to make the right decisive decisions that led me to that transaction. So, I would definitely consider ordering a few more yagna services in the upcoming year.\n\n- Yuri, MI, USA, 5-Nov-2016\n\nCow Donation Service\n\nExcellent, plan to buy many more cows in the future, love the service.\n\n- Walter M., AL, USA, 13-Oct-2016\n\nCow Ritual\n\nPuja was performed as per the traditions.

I can feel the Holy presence of your organization, Eshwar Bhakti. The Puja Yagna services, seems very good, done with pure mind and heart. One of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's teachings is simple, he says \"Simply Yagnas, Yajnas and Yagyas, and the best place to perform them is in the land of the Vedas, Bharata Varsha, India\".\n\n- Nantambu Satchidananda, Connecticut, USA, 24-Sep-2016\n\nThe Puja was done with heart\n\nI am happy to receive the photos of the Ganesha Puja. They are beautiful and I can feel the Puja was done with heart. Thanks to you and the priest. Looking forward to the Lord Ganesha's blessing very soon.\n\n- Ray Luen, Hong Kong, 6-Sep-2016\n\nMiracle happened\n\nI've ordered the Baglamukhi Puja and Yagna at the time of the biggest crisis of my life, when I faced a legal problem with potentially ten years prison sentence. I liked the fact that I could call the priest for Sankalpa as some other websites didn't include this in service and I think it's particularly important to make a personal connection with place where puja and yagna are held. I was given a mantra to chant on the day and I followed this advise. In just few weeks time, my solicitor called and said that the case against me is going to be closed and that she didn't expect this to happen. I received the official confirmation of it's being done today.\n\nI am very greatful to all the priests and Mr Mayank Goyal personally for making this miracle happen. God bless you all!\n\n- Tamara S., Norfolk, UK, 18-June-2016\n\nAti Rudra and Vishnu Maha Yagnas\n\nI am very happy and I think all the pundits are happy, too. The work has been completed. It was done with devotion and attention to every detail. I must say that my reverence and affection for the service of the pundits grew every day. Now it is in a level which words cannot express.\n\nDespite not being able to understand a simple sentence in Hindi, the language of the heart told me about the sincerity of your devotion; your commitment to the yagna; the greatness of your acharyas; your knowledge of the Vedas; your understanding of the Sanathana Dharma. Please accept my gratitude.\n\nMy special recognition to the head punditji for his leadership, organizational skills and hospitality. His guidance and explanations made it possible to understand some esoteric issues of the pujas. I thank all the teachings, patience and considerations that you had with me.\n\nI thank Mr Mayank Ji for the good organization of the event. Professionally and spiritually, the service rendered of these very sophisticated pujas, fulfilled all the expectations. His role in customer service was crucial to communicate successfully with the pandits and experiencing the pujas comfortably. I wish a lot of success for his company. Bringing the pujas to the global market is a great service to the world, and also to the Brahmin community.\n\nTo The Supreme Being, Lord Ganesh, Lord Rudra, Lord Vishnu, all the deities, great beings, holy, teachers, who participated in the yagas, please accept our gratitude, reverence and devotion.\n\nTomorrow when I return to Colombia I will remember all of you with gratitude, respect and love. May God blesses us with the opportunity to perform another big puja in this life.\n\n- Enrique Cordoba, Colombia, 1-June-2016\n\nAstonished by puja performance\n\nThe service provided is wonderful and thanks for the performance of ritual with immense dedication. I was astonished by performance of Ati Rudra Yagna and it's acceptance by the divine in the form of rains. Hats off, awesome commitment and I really admire your work.\n\n- Kiran, Ethiopia, 22-May-2016\n\nThe Best in this area\n\nI know you for many years and for sure you are the best in this area !!! I always have a very valuable advice and consultations from you. Many blessing to you, your family and business !!.\n\n- Tatyana L., North Billerica, USA, 13-May-2016\n\nGreat service in the age of Kaliyuga\n\nThank you for organizing these pujas/yagnas for me on May 9th. I'm very happy that you provide this great service in the age of Kaliyuga. I wish you liberation from this material universe and happiness forever, after your lifetime on this realm.\n\n- Yuri M., Westland, USA, 12-May-2016\n\nBlessed services\n\nThank you very much. Really appreciate you and the priest providing blessed services. And sure Lord Shiva will bestow his kindness and grace on my health.\n\n- Reena D., USA, 18-April-2016\n\nIt worked !\n\nThe Balaji puja worked !!! Today, I won 810 ‚Ç¨ from the state lottery that I play with ! Very good, thank you very much !.\n\n- Michael B., Austria, 13-April-2016\n\nYou have continued to impress me\n\nYou have produced a exceptional service that I am rating as a pivotal foundation to the basis of realisation. You have continued to impress me and serve me at the same time. I see your service as payment for the sell's of differences that exist on the planet's of creation! I have received some prasad (sales) that I am confident in the impression's service.\n\n- Raymond W. , USA, 12-Mar-2016\n\nI am in a quite \"well-off\" situation\n\nWell, the past months were quite interesting for me. I noticed some changes in my thought patterns and behavior. It seems like the \"Sri Yantra\" sent to me after the puja is quite effective in averting troubles and attracting positive influences. Some strange coincidences occurred which I think are due to the Shri Yantra. I am not rich by now, but I am not in money troubles either. So, I am in a quite \"well-off\" situation. So in short: It works ! I am quite satisfied with the results.\n\n- Michael B., Austria, 3-Feb-2016\n\nMiraculous effect\n\nThere was remarkable improvement in Sanvi's health since the puja was done. Please let the priests know about this. And just after 10 days she has recovered fully. Mahamrityunjay puja has had a miraculous effect. Thank you so much for getting that done.\n\n- Mrityunjay K, Ventura, USA, 19-Jan-2016\n\nLucky coincidences everyday\n\nThe rituals that I have done through \"Eshwar Bhakti\" have shown quite good effects, especially in the social sector. The people around me are more nice than before. If I go to a shop, then there are only very few people (only 1 or 2), in the waiting row, before me, and at times no people at all. There are many such \"lucky coincidences\".... everyday... and I am 100% sure, that these are the positive effects of the various rituals that I did.\n\n- Michael B., Austria, 29-Oct-2015\n\nShraadh Puja\n\nPuja was done in a very professional, and traditional way. Very happy with it.\n\n- Mrityunjay K, Ventura, USA, 17-Oct-2015\n\nI am grateful\n\nI am glad to receive your e-mail and the photos of the Ganesha Puja. Thank you for the effort of your priests during the course of the 3-days' puja.I am grateful again for the blessings of Ganesha.\n\n- Ray Luen, Hong Kong, 19-Sep-2015\n\nThanks a million for your selfless service\n\nI'm very lucky that I've managed to book the anushthan at Kamakhya Shakti Peetha, the most powerful Tantric Peetha on Earth. All thanks to Mother Goddess and to you. I'm so grateful that you have offered 1008 lotuses to Maa Kamakhya under my name, which proves you have a very big heart. Thanks a million for your selfless service. And with your help, I know that I will be getting immense blessings from the Mother Goddess.\n\n- Arjun ji, London , UK, 15-July-2015\n\nKumkum has already materialized\n\nThank you Mayankji, you are a true saint. You are so blessed, and I feel that we must have had a past life connection for you to do this favour for me, much appreciated. Kumkum has already materialized, at the time of Sankalpa, on the picture of yoni which I downloaded.\n\n- Lata B., Canada, 13-July-2015\n\nGreatly eased the SEVERE blockages\n\nI have had an absolutely fantastic experience with Mayank and the pandits at Eshwar Bhakti. Not only is Mayank extremely professional, prompt with his responses and generous with his time, but I have seen profound changes in my life and that of my husband‚Äôs through the pujas we have conducted via Eshwar Bhakti.\n\nWe conducted special pujas to balance the planets and the great Maha Mrityunjaya puja so far and are still reveling in the beneficial aftermath of these powerful yagnas. They truly work! The sheer volume of the mantras chanted and the strict rules followed by the Eshwar Bhakti pandits during the homas have greatly eased the SEVERE blockages we have been facing in our careers, our conjugal life and health. In addition, I am making much better progress in my own personal spiritual journey.\n\nI initially had my doubts about the efficacy of conducting such pujas and some reservations about the cost, but all these have now vanished. In fact, I am planning to do all the pujas recommended, over time. I would strongly urge others to use the services of Eshwar Bhakti. They are genuine and trusted advisors and can really help make a difference in your life.\n\n- Jaanhvi, San Francisco, USA, 3-July-2015\n\nSaw Lord Krishna himself in a dream\n\nEverything is quite good for me so far. I noticed that things begin to run quite \"smooth\" for me. It really works! My money also stays in my bank account.\n\nI think I have even seen Lord Krishna himself in a dream ! I always thought, that only when you complete a ritual would anything happen ! However, in my dream I was lying on the floor, then suddenly a young boy....kind of teenager (with some ornaments and bluish hue) came to me (looking almost exactly like Lord Krishna in the pictures !), and smeared my whole left side of the body with some \"slimy substance\"...from head to toe. I was perplexed and asked: \"What is this for\" ? The \"Teenager\" (with the \"bluish hue\") looked directly in my eyes, and said: \"It is for your heart!\" When I woke up.... ever since there is no pain in my heart.\n\n- Michael B., Austria, 29-June-2015\n\nGau Navratri\n\nFantastic service by Eshwar Bhakti. I'm very glad that I've managed to arrange 1.25 Lakh of Surabhi mantra, Cow donation, feeding 11 brahmins and 11 kumari kanya and 11 days Gau seva on the occasion of Gau Navratri. Funny enough, this is the only place which provides such service for Gau Mata. All thanks to Mayankji. May Gau Mata bless you with long life and fulfill all your wishes. Million times thank you.\n\n- Arjun ji, London, UK, 23-Apr-2015\n\nVery Positive\n\nI feel very positive and light! The beleaguered feeling of the past repeating is not there. Marriage is peaceful. The general scenario is hopeful. Thank you.\n\n- Sunita C., London, UK, 9-Apr-2015\n\nReally Overwhelming\n\nIt was very wonderful 9 days - really overwhelming at times. Thanks for taking care of this - I really appreciate all the efforts that you put in to this. Please pay my regards to Maa Baglamukhi and PanditJi as well.\n\n- Sourabh K., Reston, USA, 5-Apr-2015\n\nI have been guided\n\nSince the Puja, I have been guided to drink Golden Milk: mixture of Turmeric, Ginger, Milk, Ghee and Sweetener each day, this tonic has been real satisfying. Ways to enhance my health have came to my awareness also. This supports the wish request I submitted with the Puja.\n\n- Lorie S., Mt. Pleasant, USA, 31-Mar-2015\n\nFull Satisfaction\n\nDear Mayank Ji..I always have full satisfaction when ordering any puja as you give us a clear picture on how the puja will be conducted. Therefore, I always love to have pujas done with Mayank Ji. His response and courage always helps to reduce the burden or the sadness that one could have. Thank you again Mayank Ji for your kind assistance and patience in replying all sort of questions posted to you. Thank you.\n\n- Jaya oni, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 2-Mar-2015\n\nEfficient Service\n\nI had a great experience with the pooja service from EB. They are very kind and helpful. They answered all my questions and provided timely information. They helped me beyond the initial pooja service for my situation.\n\n- Taru J, Harrison, USA, 1-Mar-2015\n\nGreat guidance\n\nGreat guidance & support given by Mayank ji when choosing a puja. Even the most experienced of Devotees needs a little help and guidance sometimes..... Mayank ji helps, supports, counsels and guides you to making and taking the right choices in your life.\n\nSome of you might have a question \"Are online pujas effective ?\" Or \"How It Works\" . Let me tell you it is your belief, that makes it work. And yes, it has worked for me. So, believe in it and it should work for you as well !\n\nThank u, Thank u, Thank u Mayank ji!...... may u always enlighten and enrich others in their lives as you have done for me!\n\n- Nadiya B, Ilford, United Kingdom, 28-Feb-2015\n\nMaha Rudra Puja and Yagna\n\nThe service was delivered in my name last week. I was given priest's phone number so I received blessings over the phone at the beginning of Puja. This made it very special. I would recommend this company to all my friends and am looking forward to use it again in the future.\n\n- Tamara S, Norfolk, United Kingdom, 26-Feb-2015\n\nThings are moving in the right direction\n\nI was told I would see changes in the next 2-3 weeks and I'm still waiting for something that I can really say has changed but it hasn't. I have faith though and do see somethings that are moving in the right direction. Hopefully I can catch that big break I've been dreaming about soon.\n\n- Jose Magana, Saginaw, USA, 26-Feb-2015\n\nHighly recommended\n\nExcellent service, very professional and quick to reply to all queries. Thanks so much!\n\n- Julia C, Tucson, USA, 20-Feb-2015\n\nEffective online puja service\n\nExcellent, and effective online puja service, highly recommend it.\n\n- Mrityunjay K, Ventura, USA, 17-Feb-2015\n\nMany Thanks\n\nNamaste Mayankji,\n\nThanks for the puja. May God keep his blessings on you always. Many thanks again and again.\n\n- Janhavi, Waterloo, Belgium, 5-Feb-2015\n\nAlready feeling a difference\n\nMayank, Thanks so much for your help and advice. We stayed up all night and did the chants you sent and others for Maha Laxmi. We are already feeling a difference in our lives. I will contact you in February about doing one of the other Yagnas you recommended.\n\nLove and Light,\n\n- Elearia Rochelle, NC, USA , 18-Jan-2015\n\nEnlightening Experience\n\nNamaste Mayank,\n\nPlease express our heart felt gratitude to the pundits and everyone else who participated in our yagna. It was a strong and enlightening experience. We will definitely be doing more in the coming months.\n\nStay well,\n\n- Georgia MC, NC, USA , 16-Jan-2015\n\nGanesha Chaturthi Puja is a Very Powerful Puja\n\nI highly recommend the Ganesha Chaturthi Puja. This 11 consecutive days‚Äô of Puja is absolutely a very powerful Puja! It overcame and minimize all my difficulties, unlucky things and even disaster during my year of 2014!\n\nAs a practicer of Chinese Astrology, I-Ching and various kind of divinations for over 15 years, I can predict 2014 for me is a very hard year. The Chinese Astrology, which is based on the time of birth, can tell I am having troublesome especially in winter. The I-Ching, more obviously and exactly, can tell a Disaster will happen in December! As I was anxious what to do by this bad luck omen, I received an e-mail from Mayank Ji inviting me to book the Ganesha Chaturthi Puja to get Lord Ganesha‚Äôs blessings on His birthday 2014. I was hesitated if I should book the Puja. ‚ÄúWill Lord Ganesha help me? ‚Äú I remembered a month ago I bought a English book ‚Äú MO : Tibetan Divination System‚Äùin Chinese edition. This could be a good chance to practice it to see my future. As I know, Tibetan monks use this book to tell the fortune for their disciples. Without any guru‚Äôs initiation and instruction, I follow the procedure of the book, ask my question ‚Äú Will Lord Ganesha help me remove my difficulties and disaster?‚Äù While uttering 108 times mantra of the Tibetan Buddhist deity Manjusri, began to swing a dice (this book supplied with this dice), visualizing this Manjusri deity appeared in font of me, with a golden ray sent out from between his eyebrows to shine on the dice that I was swinging in both my hands. I stopped, let the dice dropped down on the table. This action was done twice. I got two words from the dice, Pa Dhi. I opened the book to search the answer of these symbols. At that moment, I was shocked and thrilling! As if this book had heard what I asked, and it answered me exactly what I was asking about and what I was anxious to know, in a most directly and most encouraging way. I translated the Chinese into English as following :\n\n‚Äú Just like Amrita can cure all diseases,\n\nAll the worries can be dissolved,\n\nAnyone who comes to divine and get this symbol,\n\nLike auspicious clouds gather together to switch into Gold ‚Äú\n\nSignal : You can get auspicious in the South!\n\nOh my God! I was moved to tears. India is the south direction of Hong Kong! I immediately booked the Ganesha Chaturthi Puja from Mayank Ji. From the August to December, I chanted Ganesha Mantra and Durga Kali manta whenever I was free. Times flied, December has just passed. I have been living as calm as the sea without storm, without any disease, without any disaster, just some small difficulties on daily job. The book of divination proved accurate, as well as Ganesha Chaturthi Puja proved its true and powerful!\n\nIs it funny to ask a Buddhist deity whether a Hindu deity will help me? Somebody might think one should not use non-Hindus way to do anything divine especially on the Hindus deity. But I don‚Äôt think so. Human beings have their different race, different boundary, but God have no race, no boundary, no limit!\n\nHeartily grateful to Lord Ganesha for his compassion, grateful to Mayank Ji and his priests!\n\n- Ray Luen, Hong Kong, 31-Dec-2014\n\nExtremely thankful\n\nMy son is doing better. He is not recovered but over last month we were able to find root cause of his issues and are now treating those. It happened after the MahaMrityunjaya japa, so I am extremely thankful to the divine.\n\n- Taru J., USA, 26-Dec-2014\n\nPujas and homas\n\nThanking Mayank Goyal for performing pujas and yajnas for me.Thanks once again with all the respect.\n\n- Dheeren Kumar Peelonah, Montagne blanche, 17-Dec-2014\n\nDo Pooja every month\n\nNamaste Mayank; Thank you so much for the beautiful Kubera's Pooja and the DVD of the pooja you did for me! I would like to humbly thank you and the priests for placing my picture by your beautiful altar‚Ä¶which is a big blessing by itself!! Words can not explain how grateful I am for this, thank you!!!!!!!!!!! You are the BEST, and I would have no hesitation to recommend you to all my friends. I am wishing I could do a pooja every month‚Ä¶and so be it:) You really are the Best!! May lord Kubera bless you all !!\n\n- Ramanthie Pugsley, Canada, 27-Aug-2014\n\nJoe Vitale recommended Yagnas\n\nI was searching for Yagnas, after reading Joe Vitale had success with them. Yagnas feel great. I have noticed changes in my life after having a Yagna. For the Ganesh Festival I'm ordering one, a Yagna during a festival is a powerful time and will enhance the effect of the yagna or puja.\n\n- Lorie Sienna, South Carolina, USA, 26-Aug-2014\n\nThanks much\n\nThanks so much for the puja service I requested last month. I already feel the subtle effects in my life, a sense of well-being and I noticed that my relationships are improving. Thanks so much, I will definitely return.\n\n- JC, USA, 3-Aug-2014\n\nVery grateful to the Pundits\n\nI am very grateful to the Pundits who pray with me for the health of my beloved. And to Mayank Goyal who made this possible - for his professionalism, his availability at each moment, in sum for the wonderful job he is doing in the service of others. Be blessed, thank you, with all my gratefulness.\n\n- Ioana Bena (Devapriya), Switzerland and Romania, 19-June-2014\n\nA Time Before...\n\nA time before Eshwar Bhakti.... the words & feelings that formed in my mind and became constant were .... despair, desperation, fear, frustration and desolation. Time now with Eshwar Bhakti my constant mantra and emotions are abundance, enlightenment, enrichment, positivity, focus, empowerment, control, contentment & happiness. I like seeking enlightenment from Eshwar Bhakti, it keeps me on the straight & narrow... Mayank Ji gives me inspiration! May you always be Successful & Happy.\n\n- Kamla Devi, London, UK, 28-May-2014\n\nThe Puja and Yagna Service Really Works!\n\nThank God! The Puja and Yajna service really works!I am heartily thankful to the priests, their tremendous power of invoking and worshiping has successfully call down the blessings from God. Just doing one time of Puja and Yagna has removed my incurable foot pain in 7 days that I had been suffering for a year. How wonderful! My first time to experience the miracle of the Hindu culture.\n\nI highly recommend the Puja & Yagna service to everyone who is facing obstacles that are beyond his own effort to overcome, and to those who want to fulfill his desires.\n\nI would also like to thank Goyal ji, he has been executing my purchase orders very promptly and very considerable. May God bless Eshwar Bhakti and priests with prosperity and longevity!\n\n- Ray Luen, Hong Kong, 30-Jan-2014\n\nWords cannot express my gratitude\n\nThank you for those beautiful thoughts. I thank you Mayank for all the good that you have shown and have done to help me in my being in becoming a better human being within my characteristic behaviour of my own thoughts and actions. My soul is less troubled and more serene. I have stopped resisting, but I do not accept everything. I know the difference between right and wrong, and love and evil. I stand my ground for the good energy frequencies and vibrations. Words cannot express my gratitude alone, for I am in complete awe to have met such intelligent kind and beautiful souls.

It's a gift working with your good company.\n\n- Enrique Cordoba, Colombia, 26-Oct-2013\n\nJoe Vitale recommends\n\nIf you read my book, \"The Attractor Factor,\" you might remember that I talked about an unusual way to remove blocks to attracting your desires.\n\nI called it Karmic Surgery in the book and said I often used \"yagnas\" to clear old baggage. Yagnas are an ancient way to invoke the blessings of a deity for the fulfillment of desires. By means of the yagya performances, the result can bestow health, wealth, protection, success in relationships, business and career growth, etc.\n\nScott if you like, but I've been having yagnas done for me for over ten years now.\n\nYou might consider it -- and now is a good time.\n\nThere are two major festivals coming up that are prime times for yagnas, as the energy during the festivals is huge and bestows multifold results.\n\nI would personally recommend to opt for their below services:\n\nPitru Paksha Shraddha Pujas: Online puja services to content our ancestors and get their blessings.\n\nNavratri Yagnas: Special yagna services during the 9 days of Navratri festival\n\nHave an open mind and check it out.\n\nExpect Miracles."
