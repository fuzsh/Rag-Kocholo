        "text": "SAB TV's popular show \"Maddam Sir\" is set to return with its much-anticipated second season. After the successful conclusion of the first season, there has been a strong demand from fans for a new instalment. Gossip mills had been abuzz with speculations about the return, and now it's confirmed: \"Maddam Sir\" is coming back.\n\nIndia Forums brings you an exclusive update on the casting for the new season. According to sources, Pooja Sharma, renowned for her role as Draupadi in Star Plus's epic saga \"Mahabharat,\" has been roped in to play the main lead in \"Maddam Sir\" Season 2.\n\nPooja Sharma made her acting debut in 2012 with Star Plus's \"Teri Meri Love Stories,\" but her portrayal of Draupadi in \"Mahabharat\" truly catapulted her to stardom. She was last seen as Mahakali/Parvati in Colors TV's \"Mahakali â€” Anth Hi Aarambh Hai.\"\n\nIt's been confirmed that Gulki Joshi will not return to the show, and Bhavika Sharma, currently busy with \"Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin,\" will also not be part of \"Maddam Sir\" Season 2."
