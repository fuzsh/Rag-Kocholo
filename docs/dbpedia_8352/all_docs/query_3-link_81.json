        "text": "Laughter Chefs: Unlimited Entertainment, is currently one of the most popular reality shows on national television. Hosted by Bharti Singh, the show features renowned TV celebs in an unconventional cooking setup. The upcoming episode of Laughter Chefs will have Bollywood actress Shraddha Kapoor as a special guest. She will be seen rating the dishes prepared by the contestants of the show.\n\nNeedless to say, Shraddha Kapoor’s presence on the show will bring a whole lot of entertainment and fun for the viewers. But wait, there’s a lot more on the list. During the episode, contestant Rahul Vaidya spilled the beans about his friend and TV actor Aly Goni’s secret crush on the Stree actress. Rahul revealed that Aly has been harbouring this crush for quite some time now. Aly, on the other hand, took the revelation positively, joining in the laughter and light-hearted banter that followed.\n\nAlso, Shraddha revealed that she and Aly share the same trainer and that’s all it took for the ex-Bigg Boss contestant’s face to turn red like a ripe tomato. Recently, the makers of Laughter Chefs: Unlimited Entertainment released a new promo, in which Shraddha could be seen interacting with the contestants of the show.\n\nThe clip began with some spooky skeletons making a dramatic appearance at Jannat Zubair and Reem Shaikh’s cooking counters. Reacting to it, Shraddha said, “Arre mere bhai beheno ko bhi bula liya yahan par (You have even called my brothers and sisters here).”\n\n“Laughter Chefs mein ek sundar stree ke peechhe peechhe aaye kuch aur bhi nayab chehre,” the promo caption reads.\n\nShraddha will be appearing on the show to promote her upcoming horror comedy film Stree 2, which will hit the theatres on August 15. Earlier, veteran actors Dharmendra and Dhinchak Pooja also arrived on the show as special guests.\n\nLaughter Chefs: Unlimited Entertainment features famous faces of the entertainment industry like Krushna Abhishek, Aly Goni, Karan Kundrra, Arjun Bijlani, Ankita Lokhande, Vicky Jain, Sudesh Lehri, Nia Sharma and Kashmera Shah.\n\nIt premieres on Colors TV."
