        "text": "The actress reveals that lack of good roles kept her stay away from TV.\n\nPooja Sharma, the actress who shot to fame with her character Draupadi in Star Plus’ mythological TV show Mahabharat, is now back as the fierce Goddess in Siddharth Kumar Tewary’s new show Mahakali – Anth Hi Aarambh Hai. The show airs on Colors TV.\n\nMahabharat, which was made by the same producer, was keen on casting Pooja for Mahakali. They had a hard time convincing her, says Pooja. However, Pooja maintained that she would have regretted declining the offer. However, the actress now feels, she would have regretted declining the offer.\n\nDuring the launch of the show, the actress reveals what kept her away from TV to indianexpress.com. She says, the great role like Mahakali has what brought her back. Also, the lack of good roles made her stay away from TV for quite some time.\n\nIn a statement to the portal, Pooja explains why she chose to play a mythological character once again, she says, “There was a lot of work that came my way but things never fell into place. Though I was quite apprehensive to play Kali, Siddharth sir (Producer Siddharth Kumar Tewary) managed to convince me. In the two hours meeting, he made me realize that there is a Kali in each one of us. That’s when I asked myself, why not do something powerful and empowering?”\n\nThe actress went on to say that she wanted to give this role a shot since it is challenging and would be a lifetime experience. She further adds, “Also, the audience has never seen Kali in a full-fledged show. It was for the first time her story is being projected. And as an actor, I am getting to play Parvati and Kali. Also, I am getting to learn so much about action and VFX. It’s challenging but also a lifetime experience.”\n\nSharing her experience, the actress says, “Doing the action sequence was comparatively easier. Though I must add that the action director literally held my hands and helped me out. And now when I see the same on screen, it’s like a badge of honour for me.” (ALSO READ: Nikkhil Arya opts out of Color’s new show Mahakali due to injury)\n\nSpeaking of the comparison that will come her way as she is still fondly remembered as Draupadi in Mahabharat, Pooja says, “I am game for all of it. It is a great thing that people still hold Mahabharat and Draupadi close to their heart after three years. And as actors, I think we all have to go through this phase.”\n\nThe actress also shares her views on why we lately see a lot of Indian TV actors moving to Indonesia for shows. While we wonder, if it’s the money, she explains, “Not at all. It is the love that makes us visit the place. It’s overwhelming to see so much love for us in a country that doesn’t even share the same cultural values. You have to visit the place to feel the warmth. And it is genuine love that comes from really loyal fans.”\n\nWhile fans want to see Pooja in social media, the actress has an altogether different perspective towards it. She says, “I an actor and my job is to perform and I cannot drown my energy in PR mechanisms. It’s strange that even though I am an actor I don’t want too much of attention. Rather than putting myself up there, I believe in putting my work ahead.”\n\nInterestingly, Pooja was rumoured to be dating most of her Mahabharat co-stars, but she responds, “It doesn’t really affect me for I know it’s all created. And at the end of the day, you are only answerable to your conscience. If you know you are not wrong, how does it matter.” Also, My personal life is exactly that – personal. So, I am not answering that.”"
