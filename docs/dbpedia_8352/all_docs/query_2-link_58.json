        "text": "From abhorring North Indians in Maharashtra to protesting against Valentine's Day, from taking an anti-Muslim stand in a secular nation to praising autocratic Adolf Hitler, from sketching eyebrow-raising cartoons to attacking top celebs of the country, the Shiv Sena firebrand leader Bal Thackeray's life has been a pack of controversies. Take a look at some of his most controversial remarks.\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nControversy 2:\n\nRepeatedly expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler\n\nThackeray attracted controversy for his praise of German autocrat Adolf Hitler. He was quoted by a magazine saying, \"I am a great admirer of Hitler, and I am not ashamed to say so! I do not say that I agree with all the methods he employed, but he was a wonderful organiser and orator, and I feel that he and I have several things in common... What India really needs is a dictator who will rule benevolently, but with an iron hand.\"\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nHowever, on 29 January, 2007, he cleared his stance in a media report. He said, \"Hitler did very cruel and ugly things. But he was an artist, I love him (for that). He had the power to carry the whole nation, the mob with him.\n\nYou have to think what magic he had. He was a miracle...The killing of Jews was wrong. But the good part about Hitler was that he was an artist. He was a daredevil. He had good qualities and bad. I may also have good qualities and bad ones.\"\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nIn a front-page appeal in the party mouthpiece Saamna, the 86-year-old leader also lashed out at home minister Sushilkumar Shinde for his statement \"to forget the past\" and play cricket with Pakistan.\n\n\"Mr Shinde, why are you taking this immature step of playing cricket with Pakistan? How can you say that we should forget the past? How and why should we forget the past?\" Thackeray questioned.\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nControversy 4:\n\nCriticism against Sachin Tendulkar\n\nReacting to Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar's comment that Mumbai belongs to every Indian, Thackeray snubbed him by saying, \"When you hit a four or a six people appreciate you, but the 'Marathi manoos' will not tolerate an infringement of their rights which will hurt them. Please dont lose on the ground of politics whatever you have earned on the cricket pitch\".\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nIn the same year, following agitation againt Biharis and other north Indians travelling to Maharashtra to take civil service examinations for the Indian Railways due to an over limit of the quota in their home provinces, Thackeray said of Bihari MPs that they were \"spitting in the same plate from which they ate\" when they criticised Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians.\n\nHe wrote, \"They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains.\" He criticised Chath Pooja an holiday celebrated by Biharis and those from eastern Uttar Pradesh which occurs six days after the Hindu New Year. He said that it was not a real holiday. This was reportedly a response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in protest against the attacks on North Indians.\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nControversy 8:\n\nOn Sania Mirza's dressing sense\n\nIn 2010, Bal Thackeray said, in a statement universally slammed, that the tennis star Sania Mirza was not famous for her on-court abilities but for her \"tight clothes, fashion and love affairs\". \"If she wished to play for India, she should have chosen an Indian life partner. Had her heart been Indian, it wouldn't have married a Pakistani,\" said Thackeray.\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nControversy 9:\n\nMorarji Desai - The man eater\n\nBal Thackeray, who worked as a cartoonist in the 'Free Press Journal' attacked the Congress using his cartoons. He had targeted the then social activist who became the prime minister of the country later, Morarji Desai, after 15 people were killed in the police firing on November 21, 1955, during a morcha at the Flora Fountain. Balasaheb sketched Desai as a Nar Bhakshak (man-eater) in his cartoon.\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nControversy 10:\n\nAnti-Muslim stand\n\nIn 2002, Thackeray issued a call to form Hindu suicide bomber squads to in response to Islamist suicide bombers and other violence.\n\nFollowing the Mumbai riots, Thackeray has taken stances viewed as anti-Muslim. However, he has also declared that he is \"not against every Muslim, but only those who reside in this country but do not obey the laws of the land...I consider such people traitors.\"\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nAgain in 2008, Thackeray wrote, \"Islamic terrorism is growing and Hindu terrorism is the only way to counter it. We need suicide bomb squads to protect India and Hindus.\" He has also reiterated a desire for Hindus to unite across linguistic barriers to see \"a Hindustan for Hindus\" and to \"bring Islam in this country down to its knees.\"\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today\n\nThackeray wrote in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana.\n\n\"(Through his cartoons) Trivedi tried to depict the rot in Parliament and the government charged him with sedition. The government should declare how many people who refused to sing Vande Mataram were charged with sedition. Police merely filed cases against people like Shah Rukh Khan for insulting the national flag but there is no record of him being charged with sedition and arrested for insulting national symbol.\"\n\nPhoto Credit : India Today"
