        "text": "The oldest was 108, the youngest 13. These are some of the UK’s coronavirus victims, among them doctors, councillors, a D-day veteran, a diplomat, a comedian and an academic.\n\nIn several cases, family members and medical professionals have been keen to emphasise that victims’ lives were cut short. Even if they had underlying health conditions, they would otherwise have been expected to live for many years.\n\nHere are some of the stories of more than 160 of those who have died so far in the UK, and those connected to the country.\n\nDr Douval Thompson-Davis, 59\n\nDr Douval Thompson-Davis, a former science teacher, died on 4 May after testing positive for coronavirus.\n\nThompson-Davis was born on 16 June 1960 at Homerton hospital in east London and attended Leone preparatory school and Sierra Leone grammar school, both in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He met his wife, Sharon, in London in 1996 and they married in 1997. They had twins, Miah and Savannah, a year later.\n\nHe had hoped to become a doctor, studying his PhD at the University of Manchester, but was drawn to teaching. He joined Greenford high school in west London as a science teacher 12 years ago, and was said to have loved his job.\n\nThompson-Davis was a deeply Christian man who loved a wide range of music and was huge fan of Arsenal football club. He was described as the life of the party by his cousin Ade Daramy, a journalist based in the Gambia.\n\n“He loved family and loved life. He was a fighter and I think the thing I have to say is that everyone who knew him loved him,” Daramy said.\n\nDr Jean Imrie, 91\n\nDr Jean Imrie, a retired GP, died on 30 April at Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham. “Outside everyone was cheering for the NHS. It was very apt for a retired GP who always went above and beyond for her patients,” Imrie’s daughter Heather said.\n\nThe 91-year-old was born in Bakewell, Derbyshire, and went to University of Leeds medical school. Imrie worked as a GP in Settle in North Yorkshire, her husband, Colin, worked as a dentist.\n\n“She would go above and beyond as a doctor. She would invite patients who were lonely round for tea, take them out. She was a very caring doctor,” their daughter said.\n\nImrie is survived by her daughters Anne, Jill and Heather.\n\nBryan Thomas Walker, 87\n\nBryan Thomas Walker died on 25 March, shortly after contracting the coronavirus.\n\nThe great-grandfather was a police officer for 30 years with the Warwickshire force and retired to Ellesmere. He returned to the Warwickshire area Henley when his wife became ill. He moved to Stratford-upon-Avon to be closer to his family and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren after his wife died.\n\n“A principled and moral gentleman, who had varying opinions on most subjects, he was always respected by those who knew him,” his family said in a statement.\n\nThomas Walker survived a triple heart bypass 12 years ago but was sadly and very quickly taken by the Covid19 pandemic, they added. “He will always be remembered and will be forever sadly missed.”\n\nNonny James, 69\n\nNonny James, a former BBC radio presenter, died on 1 May after contracting coronavirus.\n\nThe 69-year-old presented a weekly evening music show, a Sunday late show and the Sunday breakfast show on BBC Radio Shropshire as well as covering daytime programmes.\n\nShe also presented regularly on BBC Hereford and Worcester. The station paid tribute to her “wicked sense of humour”.\n\nOlume Ivowi, 46, and Isi Ivowi, 38\n\nOlume Ivowi, from Luton, died on 10 April in Luton and Dunstable University hospital leaving behind his wife, Juanetta Ivowi, and their three-year-old daughter, Mireille. His brother Isi Ivowi, who had Down’s syndrome, died nine days later in Milton Keynes General.\n\nThe family believe it is likely that they may have contracted Covid-19 from one another as Olume was in regular contact with his younger brother, who lived in supported accommodation in Milton Keynes.\n\nThey are survived by their older brother Osi Ivowi, also of Milton Keynes, who recovered from infection, their sister, Ida Ivowi, and their father.\n\nIda Ivowi, who lives in New York, said: “We are a very close family and as you can imagine this has hit us all incredibly hard but we are determined to celebrate the lives of our brothers and focus on moving forward together as a family.”\n\nDave Kettle, 77\n\nDave Kettle was admitted to Birmingham Heartlands hospital on 1 April with worsening breathing problems and a persistent cough, common symptoms for the coronavirus. He tested positive two days later and his health quickly deteriorated. The grandfather-of-six, and father-of-three, died on 4 April.\n\nKettle was born on 1 January 1943 as one of five children. He married wife, Olive, in 1962 and the couple moved into their home in Gilbertstone Avenue in 1965. They went on to have three sons – Gary, Simon and Ada.\n\nOlive, 75, told Birmingham Live: “Dave was a real family man who adored his children and grandchildren, and they loved him, too. He really was at the centre of all our lives and was a true character who never took life too seriously.\n\n“He was very well known in Gilbertstone, Sheldon and Yardley and he touched so many people’s lives. He was a wonderful husband and the house just feels so empty without him.”\n\nMore than 250 people lined the streets of Gilbertstone and Yardley to pay farewell to Kettle.\n\nDave Greenfield, 71\n\nThe Stranglers’ keyboard player Dave Greenfield died on the evening of 3 May at the age of 71 after contracting the coronavirus. Greenfield, originally from Brighton, tested positive for the virus following a prolonged stay in hospital for heart problems.\n\nA long-standing member of the influential punk band, Greenfield, who is survived by his wife, Pam, was known for his distinctive sound and playing style, using instruments such as the harpsichord and Hammond electric organ.\n\nThe Stranglers’ bass player Jean-Jacques Burnel paid tribute to Greenfield as a “musical genius” on the band’s website.\n\nHe said: “On the evening of Sunday 3 May, my great friend and longstanding colleague of 45 years, the musical genius that was Dave Greenfield, passed away as one of the victims of the Great Pandemic of 2020. All of us in the worldwide Stranglers’ family grieve and send our sincerest condolences to [his wife] Pam.”\n\nMelvin Gwanzura, 43\n\nMelvin Gwanzura, the former head of psychology at St Charles Catholic sixth form college in Kensington, London, died on 23 April after contracting Covid-19. He was 43.\n\nGwanzura was described as a devoted teacher and passionate volleyball player who had amassed a wealth of trophies and medals from tournaments around the UK.\n\nBorn in Harare, Zimbabwe, he moved to London 20 years ago. He leaves behind a loving family in the UK and in his homeland; his younger brother, his found family of loyal and loving friends, and his devoted partner and soulmate of 15 years.\n\nJames Jones, 91\n\nJames Jones died at Royal Blackburn hospital last month aged 91 after contracting coronavirus.\n\nJones grew up brought up in Withnell and left school at the age of 14. He worked as a joiner, working for a number of local employers throughout his life; Nightingale Signs, Boothman’s, Henry Boot Construction, Sheerglaze and Ultraframe.\n\nIn a moving tribute sent to the Lancashire Telegraph, his daughter Charlotte Compton said: “He has always been there for everyone; family, neighbours, colleagues, teammates and his many friends.”\n\nDerek George Belmont, 75\n\nDerek George Belmont, 75, died on Saturday 28 March at St Peter’s hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, after contracting coronavirus. The former plumber had lived in Englefield Green his whole life.\n\nDerek had undergone a major heart operation at St George’s hospital, Tooting, at the end of February when Covid-19 was beginning to hit the UK. He was discharged as it was safer to recover at home.\n\nThe family were not aware Belmont had contracted coronavirus until the week before his death. “My mum Beryl, myself and and my wife Emma stood in silence as the chaplain told us how calm and accepting of his fate Dad had been. He broke down as he told us Dad just asked about how the weather was, whilst processing the fact he probably wouldn’t live to see another morning,” his son Ryan said.\n\n“He was so selfless towards the end, that stories of his positivity and kindness has been a huge comfort, but we all miss him dearly and feel how this virus has robbed us of a lovely husband, father, grandfather and friend. I hope this story will show that by being selfless and helping others in this terrible time, that we will get through this. Dad taught me that throughout his life.”\n\nMaxine Frieze, 79\n\nMaxine Carol Frieze (née Hughes) born 6 April 1941, in Daglish, Western Australia, died on 26th April, from complications arising from Covid-19, in West Middlesex hospital.\n\nFrieze was described as a “beloved wife” and “loved” mother and grandmother. She was a secretary, starting work at The Guild for Undergraduates, University of Western Australia, Perth, where she met her husband Paul. Her last job was with the 737 Chief Pilots team for British Airways. It was the highlight of her career as it allowed her to indulge her love of travel including taking Paul on a surprise birthday trip to New York on Concorde.\n\nHer daughter, Andrée Frieze, said: “She was beloved and she loved us back. She also loved her garden, clothes, a good NZ Sauvignon Blanc (pref Villa Maria), travelling, art, movies and to dance. Most of all she loved my dad, Paul, beyond measure.”\n\nFrieze leaves her husband Paul and children, Anthony and Andrée.\n\nEdna Smith, 86\n\nSmith died on Thursday 23 April at Linden House in Blackburn after contracting coronavirus. The 86-year-old was in the late stages of dementia and had chest infections.\n\nHer grandaughter, Tracey Merrett, told the Lancashire Telegraph: “We were told she was not well on Sunday and on Monday she was OK, but by Tuesday she was in a bad state.\n\n“On Wednesday I got a phone call from the doctor that her breathing was very shallow and that she would not live long.”\n\nFollowing her grandmother’s death, Merrett started a campaign to donate radios to the care home.\n\nHamish Wilson, 77\n\nWilson, who died after contracting the coronavirus, was described as a leading radio producer and “gifted character actor with a lightness of touch”.\n\nWilson was born in Glasgow in 1942 and studied at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. He graduated and went on to play a number of roles on TV and theatre, including The Borderers (1969), Boy Meets Girls (1969), Adam Smith (1972), and The View from Daniel Pike (1972).\n\nHe became Radio Forth arts and drama producer in 1975 before joining the BBC in 1989, where he went on to produce a number of plays and series for Radio Scotland, Radio 3 and Radio 4.\n\n“Though dogged in his work, he was an affable, genial, unassuming man who was happy to help others and enjoyed reading and war-strategy games,” Toby Hadoke wrote in Herald Scotland.\n\nLaura Turner-Hewitt, 31\n\nTurner-Hewitt is thought to be one of the youngest people in Norfolk to die from coronavirus. The 31-year-old was described as a lovely young woman with “a kind nature who always thought of other people first”.\n\nTurner-Hewitt, who had a learning disability and some underlying health conditions, lived at Bowthorpe community village, an assisted accommodation in Norwich. She was taken to Norfolk and Norwich university hospital on Easter Sunday, where her condition rapidly deteriorated and she died over a week later.\n\nHer mother, Rachel Turner-Hewitt, said: “She lived at home until she was 28 when she was given the opportunity to move into housing with care. She blossomed into an independent, confident young lady.”\n\nShe said it was particularly hard to receive her daughter’s belongings from the hospital. “It was so hard not being able to visit her. Every other time she’s been in hospital, I’ve always been with her all through it.”\n\nEarl Dolphy, 71\n\nDolphy, who was described as an “amazing husband and father”, died on Sunday 19 April after contracting coronavirus. The father of seven’s death came a couple of months after he walked his youngest daughter down the aisle.\n\nThe 71-year-old, who lived in Walthamstow, worked for Transport for London as an accomplished engineer and retired after 41 years in 2012.\n\nBefore his death he requested a video call with his youngest daughter, in which he told her: “I hope to see you again”. Speaking after his death, she said: “The pain I feel is unreal, there was no way for me to see my father. He will be sincerely missed by all his family and friends.”\n\nDolphy leaves behind his wife, seven children, and five grandchildren.\n\nMargaret Blyth, 66\n\nMargaret Blyth, known as Margie, died in hospital after contracting coronavirus. The 66-year-old had worked at North East Autism Society for 18 years and was described as a “much-loved and dedicated” colleague.\n\nThe charity’s chief executive, John Phillipson, described Blyth as a “local hero”, adding: “In losing her, we have lost a significant member of our team and a friend. We’ve lost one of our own, and she will be greatly missed.”\n\nNews of her death coincided with International Workers’ Memorial Day on 28 April, with people across the world holding a minute’s silence at 11am to remember health, care and other key workers who have died from coronavirus.\n\nBetty Hill, 72, and Ken Hill, 69\n\nBetty Hill, 72, and her husband Ken, 69, died within 24 hours of each other having contracted the coronavirus virus. The “proud East Enders”, who were together for more than 40 years, were lifelong West Ham fans and described as “local heroes” by the mayor.\n\nRokhsana Fiaz, the Newham mayor, said: “The couple had been together for 40 years, and were well known to us at the council, because Ken was the secretary of the East Ham branch of the Royal British Legion and we worked with him to organise the annual Remembrance Day event in East Ham’s Central Park.”\n\nWest Ham Football Club also paid tribute in a statement. “Ken was a respected member of the club’s supporter advisory board at both grounds, and also a pillar of the local community.\n\n“Both loyal and popular fans, Ken was chairman and Betty served on the committee of the West Ham United Supporters’ Club in Castle Street, Upton Park, where the annual Hammer of the Year award was first presented in 1957-58 and for many years afterwards.”\n\nHenry Kavanagh, 94\n\nHenry Kavanagh, a popular pub owner who has been pulling pints for more than 70 years, died after contracting coronavirus. Kavanagh, described as a “loving” great-grandfather, ran Rostrevor pub Fearon’s, or Henry’s, as it is known by locals.\n\nKavanagh was born in east Belfast and joined the Merchant Navy during the second world war as a communications officer. He married Bronagh Fearon in 1950 and the couple took over Fearon’s, which had been in Bronagh’s family since 1820.\n\nHe kept working after his wife died 25 years ago until the coronavirus pandemic forced pubs to close.\n\nFamily friend Damian Goodman told the Belfast Telegraph: “I kept taking him out on the boats up until the summer of 2018. He was always very active with walking and swimming.\n\n“His grandson Sean and I had driven him down quite recently to look at a boat. At 93 he asked if he could climb on to it. I told him we were only supposed to be looking at it, but he was still trying to get the foot up and it was hilarious. He was great guy, I must say, and an absolute gentlemen.”\n\nMozadul Hussain, 63\n\nMozadul Hussain, a father-of-seven, died in Newport after contracting coronavirus. The former Liberal Democrat city councillor was only allowed five people at his funeral.\n\nHis son Kamal Hussain told ITV News: “He was liked by everyone, he left a good impression with anyone he spoke to and was always sharing his knowledge to family and friends.”\n\n“He was a family-orientated man, but he also had a lot of time for his community and he dedicated time to his charities.”\n\nHussain was one of three of Hussain’s children who attended the “difficult” funeral. He was joined by his cousin and Mr Hussain’s brother-in-law, along with an imam from the mosque.\n\nDavid Mitchell, 89\n\nMitchell was a retired music teacher and print maker who campaigned for older people and gay rights. He was a long-standing trustee of Age UK Camden and helped to set up a Opening Doors London, which supports the older LGBT+ community. He was named national trustee of the year in 2016 by the Charity Staff Foundation, and Age UK trustee of the year in 2017.\n\nMary Burd, the chief executive of Age UK Camden, said: “David was immensely proud of these awards, although in his self-deprecating way, slightly bemused that he had been chosen. We will miss him terribly.”\n\nHe died on 4 April. He is survived by David Hass, his husband and partner for 60 years.\n\nElsie Hunt, 88\n\nHunt left school at 16 and combined working for the Inland Revenue with duties as a vicar’s wife. Her son John said his mother “did her share of comforting and consoling in the many urban parishes that my father served in”.

She started showing symptoms of the coronavirus about two weeks ago before her condition deteriorated and she was taken into intensive care at the QEQM and put on a ventilator.\n\nHer daughter, Megan Murphy, wrote on Facebook that it had always been “us 4 against the world!”, and said she and her sisters would now look after each other. “Look at all the lives you looked after and all the families you comforted when patients passed away … you are an angel and you will wear your NHS crown forever more because you earned that crown the very first day you started,” she wrote. Now a family friend has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for O’Rourke’s family.\n\nA colleague, Lucy Page, wrote: “Aimee O’Rourke taught me to fight for what I believe in and gave me courage so many times to do it.” Another colleague, Soraya Zanders, said:“Aimee cared for many patients in her time as a nurse. She brought warmth and comfort to many.” On the evening of the day she died family and friends lit candles and clapped in her honour during the weekly Clap for Carers.\n\nAreema Nasreen, 36\n\nNasreen was an NHS nurse who had worked for 16 years at Walsall Manor hospital in the West Midlands, where she died on 3 April after contracting the coronavirus. Nasreen, who had three children and was from Walsall, developed symptoms on 13 March, including aches, a high temperature and then a cough. Her family said she had no underlying health issues. Her sister Kazeema Nasreen, 22, a healthcare assistant at the same hospital, said Nasreen was “an amazing nurse” and urged others to take the virus seriously. In a tribute posted on Facebook, her friend Rubi Aktar said: “She was the most loveliest, genuine person you could ever meet, she went above and beyond for everyone she met. I’m so grateful that I had the honour to call her my best friend, she saw me at my best and my worst and accepted my every flaw. I am so broken that words can’t explain.”\n\nA relative told Birmingham Live: “The immediate family are devastated. Everyone is in shock this morning. She was always so full of life. She was devoted to her job as a nurse, she absolutely loved it. She passed away doing what she loved. I’m really sad for the rest of the family, she was a fantastic person.”\n\nDanny Sharma, 38\n\nSharma was an avid fan of Liverpool Football Club and devoted much of his time to amateur football. The 38-year-old was considered to be high-risk because of his diabetes and other health conditions, and he died on 26 March after battling with coronavirus in intensive care at Hammersmith hospital in London. On 24 March, Sharma posted a picture of himself making the thumbs-up sign, and wrote: “Day Four Update. Looks nice out from the window wish I was participating in the Vitamin D. Finding hard to breathe, still fighting.”\n\nThe 38-year-old attended St Paul’s College in Sunbury-on-Thames before studying computer applications at Kingston University. His brother Vinny said he wanted Sharma’s death to make people take the threat of the coronavirus seriously. “He was a fantastic guy with a big heart, and he is someone who we are going to miss a great deal. Hopefully he will find some peace,” he said. Luke Thompson called his friend the “most selfless individual I ever met.” Traditionally the Sharma family, who are of Indian heritage, would hold an open house for 12 days after a death to enable people to pay their respects – but both Sharma’s brother and mother, Parveen, had to self-isolate because of their close contact with the 38-year-old.\n\nDanny Cairns, 68\n\nCairns was one of the first Scots to die after contracting the coronavirus to be named publicly. He had tried to self isolate at his home in Greenock in Inverclyde but after a few days became so ill he was transferred to hospital, where he died on 26 March. His brother Hugh, who lives in the United States, said the experience was a “nightmare” for the family. “He wasn’t just my brother, he was my best friend,” he said. “From the time of going into hospital within three days he was dead. His last words to me were, ‘I’m on my way out mate’.”\n\nSheila French, 80\n\nFrench from Broughty Ferry, a suburb of Dundee, died after six days in Ninewells hospital intensive care on 27 March. She had been admitted after becoming ill on a family holiday in Lanzarote to celebrate her 80th birthday. Her family spoke of the pain of not being able to visit her in hospital, but her son Colin said dedicated NHS staff were determined to ensure her “comfort and dignity right to the end”. Originally from Glasgow, she married Eric French in 1962. The couple were well-known figures in the local community and shared a lifelong love of tennis.\n\nThe 80-year-old sang in the Barnhill St Margaret’s parish church choir for more than four decades. Her son said she was “interested in so many things”, including music, singing and reciting poetry. “She was also always surrounded by wool for knitting and crochet,” he told the Dundee Courier. “Her main thing in recent years was crocheting blankets to raise money for charities including Chas, and she also collected for Save The Children.”\n\nDr Habib Zaidi, 76\n\nFamily GP Dr Zaidi is thought to be the first doctor in the UK to have been killed by the coronavirus.

He and his wife, Dr Talat Zaidi, 70, were both managing partners of Eastwood group practice and had served three generations of families in the area for nearly 50 years. The couple’s four children all work in the medical profession. Daughter Dr Sarah Zaidi, also a GP, said his death was “reflective of his sacrifice. He had a vocational attitude to service.” She added: “We can’t mourn in the normal way. We can’t have a normal funeral. He left a gaping hole in our hearts, but a loss that is also felt within the community that he devoted almost his entire life to. We are praying for the safety of everyone right now.”\n\nDr Jose Garcia-Lobera, GP chair at NHS Southend clinical commissioning group, said Zaidi had left behind an “incredible legacy”. He said: “[He] was a “hugely respected, selfless man who dedicated his life to helping others. Dr Zaidi will always be remembered for his significant contribution to local health services through his long career as a GP.”\n\nMark Barnett, late 60s\n\nBarnett was the headteacher at Westfield in Acomb, one of York’s biggest primary schools, for more than 17 years when he stepped down in 2008 aged 55 to work for the City of York council as a consultant headteacher.

Praised as a deeply committed teacher, he was a recipient of the Teacher Of The Year title at the Community Pride Awards.\n\nCllr Andrew Waller, a school governor at Westfield who knew Barnett well, said: “He was an inspirational headteacher and a legend in the community. Everyone knew Mark and he had a huge amount of respect.” Singer and former teacher Ian Donaghy said: “Mark was all about the children and not himself. You see a lot of career teachers out there, but Mark wasn’t one of them. The city has lost a big, big influence on children. His big thing was happy kids learn, it’s not about jumping through hoops or league tables. We could do with a few more like Mark.”\n\nEddie Large, 78\n\nLarge, best known as one half of the comedy duo Little and Large, died after contracting the coronavirus in hospital where he was being treated for heart failure, his son said.\n\nThe Glaswegian comedian, whose real name was Edward McGinnis, found fame alongside Syd Little in the 1970s and 80s, when their TV performances attracted millions of viewers.\n\nHis son, Ryan McGinnis, broke the news in a Facebook post on 2 April, explaining that his father had caught Covid-19 while in hospital. He wrote: “It is with great sadness that Mum and I need to announce that my dad passed away in the early hours of this morning. He had been suffering with heart failure and unfortunately, whilst in hospital, contracted the coronavirus, which his heart was sadly not strong enough to fight. Dad had fought bravely for so long. Due to this horrible disease we had been unable to visit him at the hospital, but all of the family and close friends spoke to him every day.\n\n“We will miss him terribly and we are so proud of everything he achieved in his career with Syd and know that he was much loved by the millions that watched them each week.”\n\nCaroline Saunby, 48\n\nSaunby, a mother of two young boys, had no known underlying health conditions and started exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms on Thursday 26 March. By Sunday, she had died.\n\nShe collapsed at her home in New Marske, North Yorkshire, where she had begun to struggle for breath after initially having a sore throat, which she thought was tonsillitis. An air ambulance was dispatched and Saunby was put on a ventilator at home before being taken to James Cook University hospital in Middlesbrough, where she died the same day. She leaves behind her husband, Vic, and six-year-old twins, Joseph and Elliot.\n\nHer twin sister, Sarah Jarvis, described her “unbearable heartbreak” as she pleaded with people to take the coronavirus seriously.

This virus does not discriminate.”\n\nPaul Ramsden, 80\n\nIt was only when Ramsden’s wife, Jacky, struggled to wake him that it dawned on her something was seriously wrong. Paul was fit for his age and had no known underlying health conditions.\n\nHe fell ill soon after the couple returned from the Canary island of La Gomera. Jacky said Ramsden’s only obvious symptom was tiredness, but when she tried to rouse him from his sleep on 22 March, the penny dropped. He died five days later.\n\nJacky, from Lytham near Blackpool in Lancashire, told the Blackpool Gazette: “It’s very clear that while the vulnerable are susceptible to this virus, it also strikes down fit and healthy people. I wish people to take the government guidelines seriously and to abide by them so we can avoid further heartbreak. I feel lucky to have enjoyed 40 years of love and adventure with Paul, but I am saddened that our marriage has been cut short in this way.”\n\nLinda Tuppen, 66\n\nA former nursery nurse and teacher, Tuppen died from suspected coronavirus after caring for her son, who is also thought to have caught the disease.

In an interview with MEN, Rob recalled the moment he found his mother at her home in Bolton, Greater Manchester. “I was in a panic, she was just lay there, and I shouted ‘Mum, mum,’ but she didn’t answer,” the 28-year-old software engineer said. “I was doing chest compressions until the ambulance came. I was still in the room when he came over and said she was gone. It’s devastating. We lost our father in 2008, so we’re pretty much on our own now.\n\n“She was a kind, loving lady who adored me and James and would have done anything for us. She always used to say that we were her lives. She would do anything for anyone.”\n\nThomas Harvey, 57\n\nThe NHS healthcare assistant caught coronavirus and died after treating patients with only gloves for protection, according to his family.\n\nIt is claimed Harvey fell ill after helping a patient who later tested positive for Covid-19 and eventually died on 29 March.

Goodmayes hospital in east London claims there were “no symptomatic patients on the ward”. But a former colleague told the BBC that Harvey contracted the virus after treating a patient who later tested positive.\n\nHarvey’s daughter, 19-year-old Tamira, told the BBC: “It’s so sad. I feel like he was let down in so many ways. It’s an absolute tragedy and he didn’t deserve to lose his life in the way he did. If he had just had the right equipment, we wouldn’t be in this predicament and it wouldn’t have escalated in the way it did.”\n\nPeter Sinclair, 73\n\nSinclair was a professor of economics and a former tutor to David Cameron.
