        "text": "I found two different ways to switch from PowerShell to the command prompt in Visual Studio Code.\n\nThe very simple steps I found myself are as below:\n\nThe first one is also simple and handy for all developers.\n\nPress Ctrl + Shift + P to show all commands.\n\nType shell in the displayed text box to filter the list.\n\nSelect Terminal: Select Default Shell.\n\nYou will be prompted to Select your preferred terminal shell. You can change this later in your settings or follow the same process as we do now\n\nSelect Command Prompt (cmd.exe)\n\nClick the Delete Icon in the shell pane to remove the existing terminal.\n\nPress Ctrl + ` (or menu View → Terminal in menu) to open a new terminal pane.\n\nThe second one is a very simple way:\n\nPress Ctrl + ` (or menu View → Terminal in menu) to open a new terminal pane.\n\nClick terminal selection dropdown and click 'Select Default Shell'.\n\nChoose the terminal type Command Prompt or PowerShell\n\nNow delete the current opened terminal or open a new terminal.\n\nNow, Command Prompt will be your default shell in Visual Studio Code.\n\nFrom Visual Studio if you have PowerShell set as your default integrated terminal, after you call it with Ctrl + ` (control + backtick) - that toggles from the terminal to your files panel and back. Call the terminal, It will show as 1: pwsh in the dropdown box. From the PowerShell command line type bash and enter. You have your bash prompt $. In the dropdown you now see 1: Bash.\n\nYou can type cmd from either the ps C: or the $ Bash prompt and open the Windows command prompt. C:> and exit to exit them.\n\nYou can open up multiple terminals. Say PowerShell (pwsh) is your default one. A new terminal will show as 2: pwsh which you can change to a cmd one. The same if you open a third. Change it to Bash. You now have three terminals 1: pwsh, 2: cmd, and 3: bash. You can select whichever one you want to work with from the dropdown. You can of course exit any of them.\n\nNo doubt you've seen that when you are running Node.js, the terminal becomes node."
