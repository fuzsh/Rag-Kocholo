Here we have given NCERT Solutions for Class 9 English Literature Reader Chapter 1 How I Taught My Grandmother to Read.\n\nNCERT Solutions for Class 9 English Literature Reader Chapter 1 How I Taught My Grandmother to Read\n\nTextbook Questions Solved\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nWrite about the following memories or experiences. Share your views with the class.\n\n(i) A memorable holiday spent with your grandmother\n\n(ii) A story told by your grandmother\n\n(ii) The things you admire the most about your grandmother\n\n(iv) The difference between your mother and your grandmother\n\nAnswer:\n\n(i) A memorable holiday spent with my grandmother\n\nGrandmothers are more than mothers. I still remember how I spent a holiday with my grandmother. It was quite a long time since I met her. I found her standing at the village bus-stand to receive me. She was really excited. She had prepared some of my favourite dishes only for me. She took me to the fields. We stopped at the canal. What a sight! Children were diving into it from a wooden bridge. I enjoyed fresh sugarcanes. It was evening. A herd of cattle was returning home. My grandmother would not let me sleep early. She had many interesting stories to tell. She talked of her youth, her good old times and her hobbies. She kissed me affectionately before I went to bed.\n\n(ii) A Story told by my grandmother\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a grandmother without her fanciful stories. My grandmother is a great story-teller. Her narrative skill is very real and convincing. She will make you believe even the incredible. She has stored many stories in her rpemory. Her favourite story is of Savitri and Yama. Savitri’s husband was cutting wood in the forest. He fell down from a tree and died. The God of death, Yama came to take him to the other world. Savitri would not let him come near the dead body of her husband. She remained glued to the dead body for many days. She didn’t eat and sleep. The God of death was moved. He had never seen such a devoted and determined wife. He was pleased and restored Savitri’s husband to life.\n\n(iii) The things I admire the most about my grandmother\n\nMy grandmother is my role-model. I am very much impressed with her personality. But there are certain things which I admire the most in her character. The first thing is her sense of discipline. She is very regular and punctual. She gets up at 5 a.m. in the morning. She is ready for her prayers before 6 a.m. She has always a fixed time for everything. I like her deep faith in God. Her sense of cleanliness is extremely praiseworthy. She looks noble and dignified in her spotless white clothes. All these things make her a very pleasing and dignified personality.\n\n(iv) The difference between my mother and my grandmother\n\nHuman relations generally defy comparisons. But still there are certain basic differences between my mother and my grandmother. I am also different from my mother. So is my grandmother from her daughter-in­law. Basically it is a generation gap. My grandmother is conservative. She is highly religious. She has deep faith in God and fate. But my mother is a working woman. She has a progressive outlook towards life and people. She is not so religious. She believes that everyone has a right to lead one’s own kind of life. My grandmother thinks that home and children are the most important things for any woman. My mother thinks of other things as well. She believes that a woman must have freedom to decide what is good or bad for her.\n\nQuestion 2.\n\nHave you ever been on a trip to any place in India, where you didn’t know the language spoken locally? How did you feel? How did you manage to communicate?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDuring my tour to Tamil Nadu, I happened to visit a small village. It is near the temple town of Kanchipuram. Actually, I went there to buy some sarees for my mother and my elder sister. I went to a handloom shop. The shopkeeper welcomed me with folded hands and wished ‘namaskaram’. I did the same. I said ‘sarees ’. He responded by saying “ilia’ or ‘Yella or something like that. He said something to the helpers. I could not understand even a word. Many new sarees of different colours were laid before me. I picked up one and asked the price. He raised three fingers—I couldn’t make out whether he was asking for three hundred or three thousand. A man who knew some Hindi saved me from the embarrassment. I paid six thousand and bought two sarees. Only then I realised that I was a stranger in my own country and I determined to learn at least one language that is spoken in South India.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nSee textbook on page 3.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDo it yourself.\n\nQuestion 4.\n\nNow that you have enjoyed reading the story, answer the following questions by choosing the correct option\n\n(a) The grandmother could relate to the central character of the story ‘Kashi Yatre’ as_______\n\n(i) both were old and uneducated.\n\n(ii) both had granddaughters who read to them.\n\n(iii) both had a strong desire to visit Kashi.\n\n(iv) both were determined to learn to read.\n\nAnswer:\n\n(iii) both had a strong desire to visit Kashi.\n\n(b) Why did the women at the temple discuss the latest episode of ‘Kashi Yatre’?\n\n(i) to pass their time.\n\n(ii) the writer, Triveni, was very popular.\n\n(iii) they could relate with the protagonist of the serial.\n\n(iv) women have a habit of discussing serials.\n\nAnswer:\n\n(ii) the writer, Triveni, was very popular.\n\n(c) The granddaughter found her grandmother in tears on her return as__________\n\n(i) the grandmother had been unable to read the story Kashi Yatre’ on her own.\n\n(ii) the grandmother had felt lonely.\n\n(iii) the grandmother wanted to accompany her granddaughter.\n\n(iv) she was sad she could not visit Kashi.\n\nAnswer:\n\n(i) the grandmother had been unable to read the story Kashi Yatre’ on her own.\n\n(d) Why did the grandmother touch her granddaughter’s feet?\n\n(i) As a mark of respect to her teacher.\n\n(ii) It was a custom in their family.\n\n(iii) Girls should be respected.\n\n(iv) She had read the story of Kashi Yatra’ to her.\n\nAnswer:\n\n(i) As a mark of respect to her teacher.\n\nQuestion 5.\n\nAnswer the following questions briefly\n\n(a) What made Triveni a popular writer ?\n\n(b) Why did the grandmother depend on her granddaughter to know the story?\n\n(c) Pick out two sentences which state that the grandmother was desperate to know what happened in the story.\n\n(d) Could the grandmother succeed in accomplishing her desire to read?

You want to make your friends aware of it and contribute something in bringing about a change in the lives of the illiterate adults. Deliver a speech in the morning assembly at your school about the Importance of Adult Education and ways to implement it.\n\nRead the following to make your speech effective:\n\nThe introduction of a speech is like the nose of an airplane. The nose sets the course and leads the plane off in a specific direction. A good introduction sets the direction of your speech by\n\ngetting the attention of your audience\n\nintroducing your topic\n\nstating your central idea or purpose\n\nbriefly identifying the main points\n\nmaking your audience eager to hear what you have to say\n\nAnswer:\n\nImportance of Adult Education and Ways to Implement it\n\nRespected Principal, teachers and dear friends!\n\nIndia’s economic achievements may be spectacular. So may be its rapid strides in space and arms. But let me ask you a question. Don’t we feel ashamed at having the maximum number of illiterates in the world? Doesn’t it make a mockery of all our achievements? I want to make, particularly my friends aware of it. I want that all of us must contribute something in bringing about a change in the lives of the illiterate adults.\n\nI feel that every unit of N.S.S. in schools must call for volunteers. The volunteers of each unit must adopt at least five villages. They must set their targets. I think two years are enough. Scatter out in the villages. Find out the illiterate adults. Be respectful and cooperative. Give them at least 20 hours a week.\n\nI want to draw the attention of all of you to the grandmother of the story ‘How I Taught My Grandmother to Read’. When an old and illiterate lady like Krishtakka can read a novel within a year, why can’t others? Let’s be like the granddaughter. Let’s be totally devoted to the cause of the illiterates. We can do wonders. A day will come when we will have not a single illiterate in India. It may take time. But that day will come.\n\nWriting Task\n\nQuestion 9.\n\nYou are the grandmother. How did you feel when your granddaughter gave you the novel ‘Kashi Yatre’ ? Write your feelings in your diary.\n\nTo make your diary entry interesting, read the following information about what is a diary entry.\n\nA diary entry is a purely personal piece of writing. The writer expresses his/her thoughts and feelings. Reactions to incidents are generally poured out in a diary. Hence expressions that are emotionally charged are used.\n\nFor example – When you are happy about something, you could start like this\n\n8th July 20xx, Wednesday 8 pm\n\nToday I am very happy as ………………………..\n\nAnswer:\n\n8th July 20XX, Wednesday 8pm\n\nToday I am very happy as my mission is almost over. About a year ago I set a deadline. I didn’t want to remain dependent and helpless anymore. So I decided to cast off the curse of illiteracy. I decided to leam the Kannada alphabet. No doubt, this task would not have seen the day without the active help of my granddaughter. She acted as my teacher and I worked hard and did an amazing homework under her guidance.\n\nToday, my granddaughter has given me a copy of Triveni’s famous novel Kashi Yatre. Lord, how merciful you are ! Now I can read any novel with confidence on my own. don’t need my granddaughter to read Kashi Yatre anymore for me. I have attained self­respect and independence. It is true that if you are determined you can overcome all obstacles. And I have learnt another lesson. For learning, there is no age bar.\n\nQuestion 10.\n\nHere is a story about Swami and his grandmother. After reading the excerpt, change it into a conversation between Swami and his Grandmother.\n\nAfter the night meal with his head on his granny’s lap, nestling close to her, Swaminathan felt very snug and safe in the faint atmosphere of cardamom and cloves. ‘Oh, Granny !’ he cried ecstatically. ‘You don’t know what a great fellow Rajam is.’ He told her the story of the first enmity between Rajam and Mani and the subsequent friendship.\n\n‘You know, he has a real police dress,’ said Swaminathan. ‘Is it? What does he want a police dress for?’ asked Granny.\n\n‘His father is the Police Superintendent. He is the master of every policeman here.’ Granny was impressed. She said that it must be a tremendous office indeed. She then recounted the days when her husband, Swaminathan’s grandfather, was a powerful sub-magistrate, in which office he made the police force tremble before him and the fiercest dacoits of the place flee. Swaminathan waited impatiently for her to finish the story. But she went on, rambled, confused, mixed up various incidents that took place at different times. ‘That will do, Granny,’ he said ungraciously. ‘Let me tell you something about Rajam. Do you know how many marks he gets in arithmetic?’\n\n‘He gets all the marks, does he, child?’ asked Granny.\n\n‘No silly. He gets ninety marks out of one hundred.’\n\n‘Good. But you must also try and get marks like him…. You know, Swami, your grandfather used to frighten the examiners with his answers sometimes. When he answered a question, he did it in a tenth of the time that others took to do it. And then, his answers would be so powerful that his teachers would give him two hundred marks sometimes.\n\n‘Oh, enough, Granny ! You go on bothering about old unnecessary stories. Won’t you listen to Rajam?’\n\n‘Yes, dear, yes.’\n\n‘Granny, when Rajam was a small boy, he killed a tiger.’\n\nSwaminathan started the story enthusiastically : Rajam’s father was camping in a forest. He had his son with him. Two tigers came upon them suddenly, one knocking down the father from behind. The other began chasing Rajam, who took shelter behind a bush and shot it dead with his gun.\n\n‘Granny, are you asleep?’ Swaminathan asked at the end of the story.\n\nNow read the dialogue and complete the conversation:\n\nSwarni: You don’t know what a great fellow Raj am is! In the beginning I could not get along with him but now he is my good friend. And you know, he has a real police dress.\n\nGrandmother: Is it? What does he want a police dress for?\n\nSwarni: His father is the Police Super­intendent. He is the master of every policeman here.\n\nGrandmother: I think, it must be a tremendous office. Do you know, your grandfather was a powerful sub­magistrate and the Police Force trembled before him? Even the fiercest dacoits of the place fled.\n\nSwarni: That will do, Granny. It’s so boring. Let me tell you something about Raj am. Do you know how many marks he gets in arithmetic?\n\nGrandmother: He gets all the marks, doesn’t he, child?\n\nAnswer:\n\nSwarni: No silly! He gets ninety marks out of one hundred.\n\nGrandmother: That’s good. But you must also try and get marks like him. Do you know how your grandfather used to frighten the examiners with his answers sometimes? He would answer a question in a tenth of the time that others took. He would give so powerful answers that his teachers gave him two hundred marks sometimes.\n\nSwarni: Oh, enough, Granny! Don’t bother about old unnecessary stories. Won’t you listen to Rajam?\n\nGrandmother: Yes, dear, Yes.\n\nSwarni: Granny, do you know when Rajam was a small boy, he killed a tiger? His father was camping with him in a forest. Two tigers came upon them suddenly. One knocked down the father from behind. The other began chasing Rajam. He took shelter behind a bush and shot it dead with his gun.
