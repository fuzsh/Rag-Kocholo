        "text": "Synopsis\n\nSmriti Irani gave her first media briefing after her defeat in Amethi to Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma. She gracefully accepted the loss and thanked her supporters for their dedication and hard work. When asked about her future plans, she remarked, \"Bhenon se rishta tab tootata hai, jab arthee uthatee hai\" (relationships with sisters end only with death).\n\nSmriti Irani gave her first media briefing after her surprising defeat in Amethi. When asked about her future plans, she said, \"Bhenon se rishta tab tootata hai, jab arthee uthatee hai\" (relationships with sisters end only with death).\n\nThe actress-turned-politician lost her Amethi seat to Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma, a close aide of the Gandhi family, by 1,67,196 votes. According to the Election Commission, Irani received 3,72,032 votes, while Sharma garnered 5,39,228 votes. The BSP candidate received 34,534 votes.\n\nFollowing the outcome, Smriti Irani shared a post on social media where she gracefully accepted her defeat and emphasized her years of hard work. Irani had clinched the Amethi Lok Sabha seat after defeating Rahul Gandhi in 2019.\n\nSmriti tweeetd, \"Such is life... A decade of my life spent moving from one village to another, shaping lives, fostering hope and dreams, working on infrastructure like roads, drainage systems, bridges, bypasses, medical colleges, and more.\" She further added, \"I am eternally grateful to those who supported me through thick and thin. To those rejoicing today, congratulations. And to those inquiring, 'How's the josh?' I say - it's still high, Sir.\"\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to reporters here, Irani said, \"I express special gratitude to all the supporters and workers of the BJP who served the party with full hard work and dedication. I got the privilege of fulfilling the 30-year-old demands of the Lok Sabha constituency, from the drains in the village to the bypass and medical college.\"\n\nShe expressed \"special gratitude\" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for completing the work of 30 years in the short span of five years.\n\n\"I congratulate the Modi-Yogi government that won the elections. I hope that with the devotion we served the people by going to every village, Amethi will continue to be served in this way every day,\" she said.\n\nIrani said the BJP will be strengthened further.\n\n\"The organisation will analyse on its own, but as a political worker, it has been my great fortune that I went to every village of the area and worked (there).\"\n\n(inputs from PTI)\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nSpotted a flying saucer?
