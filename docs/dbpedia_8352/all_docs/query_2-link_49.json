In the year 1984, he imprinted his name among the stars by commencing a mission lasting 21 days and 40 minutes, propelling India to remarkable accomplishments in space.\n\nSharma's pioneering spirit led him into uncharted territory, etching an unforgettable mark in the hearts of every Indian. His cosmic voyage unfolded through a joint collaboration between ISRO and the Soviet Interkosmos Space program. Aboard Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, alongside two Soviet cosmonauts, Sharma embarked on his cosmic journey. Amid weightlessness, he captured captivating glimpses of space, seamlessly blended yoga into the environment, and conducted experiments that expanded our scientific horizons.\n\nA poignant moment arose when then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, inquired about how India appeared from space. With unwavering patriotism, Sharma's response reverberated across the nation: \"Saare jahan se accha\" (better than the rest of the world). This instant united the nation around the shared quest for knowledge and scientific advancement, transcending barriers of religion, caste, and gender. Even recently, Indians stayed awake not for entertainment but to glean insights about upcoming space endeavors.\n\nAs Chandrayaan 3 triumphantly touched down on the lunar surface, Rakesh Sharma joined fellow Indians in congratulating ISRO, reaffirming his connection with India's space odyssey.\n\nPresently, Sharma resides in the tranquil Coonoor district of Tamil Nadu, relishing a life of understated yet extraordinary significance. Shying away from the limelight, he continues to contribute to ISRO's ambitious missions, serving on the National Space Advisory Council for the Gaganyaan venture.\n\nFile Photo\n\nWhile his name may not dominate modern headlines, Sharma's legacy resonates within history textbooks and India's celestial sojourn. He remains an emblem of limitless space exploration and human aspirations.\n\nSharma's journey from education to spacefaring is awe-inspiring. Born on January 13, 1949, he attended esteemed institutions including St. Ann's High School, St. George's Grammar School, and Nizam College in Hyderabad. His passion for a military career led him to the National Defence Academy (NDA) in Pune.\n\nAscending to the rank of Squadron Leader, Sharma joined the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 1970, amassing achievements that culminated in piloting MIG-21s during the 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh. His valor translated into 21 combat missions flown on these aircraft.\n\nSharma's unwavering determination drove him to the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, earning him the prestigious Soviet 'Hero of the Soviet Union' award in 1982.\n\nYet, humility remains his hallmark. As Chief Test Pilot at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Sharma's courage was tested during a MIG-21 test flight. Surviving a harrowing incident near Ozar, Nashik, he emerged with grace.\n\nRetiring in 2001, Sharma settled in Coonoor with his wife, savoring life's simpler pleasures: golfing, gardening, yoga, reading, and exploration. In his serenity, Rakesh Sharma embodies the essence of a life dedicated to soaring heights and profound peace.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nHNIs invested in Piramal PMS.
