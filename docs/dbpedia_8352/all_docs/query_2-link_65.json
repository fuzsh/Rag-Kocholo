Aman Parkar has emerged as an impactful horror storyteller and content creator. He brings spine-chilling stories to his followers who really enjoy his narration. Aman’s research and ability to discover hidden facts, secret knowledge, and haunted stories is truly commendable.\n\nAman’s Instagram page is a gold mine of horror stories. It’s like reading a storybook filled with intriguing narratives, where each post and story is bound to surprise you. His distinct style, defined by his ability to enthral with hidden truths and uncanny storytelling, has gained him a loyal following of 545K followers on Instagram and 403K subscribers on YouTube. Parkar’s content is as educational as it is eerie.\n\nA Horror Storytelling Session With Aman\n\nFrom ancient enigmas to modern mysteries, Aman Parkar’s Instagram page exemplifies the art of creating content that appeals to mystery enthusiasts. Being a fan of his storytelling prowess, we requested him to narrate a horror story to us LIVE in our office. Aman was sweet enough to oblige. He shook us with not just one but 2 thrilling horror stories! The first one was his personal experience, which made it all the more eerie!\n\nHe came face-to-face with the horrors of black magic. How? Check out his horror story here:\n\nYet Another Chilling Story\n\n“One of my subscribers shared this story and I know it is real because that subscriber’s friend had died in that incident,” mentioned Aman before proceeding to narrate the story. This statement itself sent chills down our spine!\n\nHe started, “So the incident happened when the group of friends were going for an event in Kolkata. A special route was prepared for that event. It was a tunnel. When their car entered the tunnel, they felt somebody tapping on the window from outside. The shocking part is that the car was running at 100 kph, so who was it?“\n\n“When the car crossed the tunnel and stopped at a gas station, everybody got out and saw that the car’s windows were covered with dirty hand prints. They approached a car washer available at the gas station, and they went for a coffee. When they came back, they saw that the handprints were still there. And when they asked for an explanation, the car washer said that the handprints were from inside. So this incident was so scary, that one of my subscriber’s friends died on the spot. It still gives me a chill thinking, about that tapping and hand prints,” Aman added.\n\nAlso Read: A Beast Games Contestant Makes Explosive Revelations About MrBeast\n\nWe know the man and what he does. Let’s dive a bit deeper into his mind to know how he does what he does! Here’s what Aman had to say:\n\nWhy Horror Storytelling?\n\nStorytelling is a perfect medium to make a normal story exciting. The horror genre gives you the liberty of being creative. And whenever you sleep at night, you will always find horror content in your reel feed. So that motivated me because even I watched horror content before sleeping.\n\nSince childhood, we all have heard such stories from our grandmothers and grannies, that ‘some peepal’s tree is there, some witch stays there,’ etc. So, I think we are all connected to horror content since we were kids. When I started posting on Instagram, within 10 days my subscribers went from 250 to 1 lakh! And since then, I have never looked back.\n\nThe Research & Ideation Process\n\nMy research team and I have a different approach to coming up with new ideas and conducting research for our horror stories. We start by researching deep into various sources of inspiration, including folklore, urban legends, historical events, and psychological phenomena.\n\nWe also brainstorm extensively as a team, bouncing ideas off each other and refining concepts until they are as chilling as possible. Most importantly I think new ideas pop up when you are following the current trend and you focus on being at the centre of any new controversy.\n\nAman’s Exposé On Balenciaga\n\nHe recently uncovered a very controversial campaign done by Balenciaga on his channel. Can we expect more such brand exposés? Aman says, “Of course, yes. There are lots of brands that are touching the sky based on Satanism and Satanic rituals. Even there are a few mobile phone brands that are very much connected with Satanism and by using their phones, you too are pleasing Satan. So, the Balenciaga exposé was just the start of something very new and fresh we are doing for the channel.“\n\nBalancing Suspense-Building & Delivering Facts In Storytelling\n\nWhen it comes to showing the facts, Aman adds links in the description. “Suspense is added through improvisation while shooting because you can imagine the tension building in real-time. So I always focus on my storytelling when it comes to building suspense.” How does he balance the two?\n\n“The balance comes from ensuring that the facts are clear and accessible, while the suspense is organically woven into the narrative. By blending factual information with improvised suspense, we ensure that the story is both informative and gripping, keeping the audience engaged and on edge from start to finish,” explained Aman.\n\nWhich Storytellers Or Filmmakers Inspire Aman?\n\nI adore a good story and moreover, I adore the storyteller who made it. That is why I have always been fascinated with the works of Lagaan maker Ashutosh Gowariker and love how he constructs every scene perfectly. Even if you watch his films after years, you will feel the same freshness when you see them for the first time.\n\nAnd the other filmmaker is, of course, Sanjay Leela Bhansali because we all know he is one of the best directors we have got in the industry right now.\n\nBut, out of all, I really like how Imtiaz Ali tells his story. He always comes up with a unique way of telling his tales. I really wish to work with him soon. And there are good Indian creators too who are great storytellers like Khooni Monday.\n\nOn Keeping The Audience Engaged\n\nIt is so essential for the viewers to be interested in a story for them to keep them coming back for more. And Aman Parkar has cracked the secret to capturing their attention. “It starts when your audience sees you often! So I guess fan interaction is pretty important. You must do anything that makes your followers happy.“\n\nHe explains how as well. “One of the things that works for a creator is meeting their fans outside. If it is a mall, movie theatre, anywhere. Keep meeting them and take photos with them. It builds a personal bond with your audience. And the other thing to retain or grow your audience is to collaborate. Keep collaborating with your favourite influencers to increase your subs.”\n\nChallenges In Horror Content Creation\n\nInitially while making content on Instagram, Aman always heard that creators should make content which people would engage with, and more importantly it should be according to the algorithm. “But, I never considered that and stuck to my true self as a storyteller. Luckily people connected with it and till now it is growing good,” said the storyteller.\n\nHe explained that there is not much challenge for Instagram, but there is a challenge for YouTube. “If a story gets stuck in your head, you can’t sleep at night. So, apart from being consistent on YouTube, I also need to get out of every horror story I narrate. And coming up with a new, fresh, and factual story is very important,” said the storyteller.\n\nWhat Is The Scope Of Horror Storytelling As A Content Creation Genre?\n\nHear it from the man himself, “The horror community is very underrated. There is good and healthy competition within the community, but I respect everyone who is in this category. It is growing every day and I hope that people see the true potential of this very soon.\n\nHow Can One Monetize?\n\nAman believes that where monetization is concerned, the key is being consistent. “Because every day new creators keep on coming on social media, you need to give your audience a reason to tune into your channel. So, for us, it was conspiracy theories. If someone wants to monetize their channel, just give something fresh,” he explains.\n\nWhile Aman Parkar’s stories are scary and thrilling, his insights on horror content creation are equally comforting. It was a delight to know all that goes behind putting out such engaging content for his viewers. We are still recovering from the stories he narrated to us! But, if you want to hear more such stories, just head to his Instagram and YouTube page!"
