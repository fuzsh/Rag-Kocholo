        "text": "Indian actress and politician (born 1963)\n\nNot to be confused with Rupali Ganguly.\n\nRoopa Ganguly (born 25 November 1966) is an Indian actress, playback singer and politician.[6] She is best known for her portrayal of Draupadi in B R Chopra's hit television series Mahabharat.[7] Often promoted as the Tollywood's answer to Bollywood's Shabana Azmi, she is known for her versatility and accent adaptation.[8][9][10] She has worked with directors such as Mrinal Sen, Aparna Sen, Goutam Ghose and Rituparno Ghosh. She is a trained Rabindra Sangeet vocalist and a classical dancer.[11] She received several awards including a National Award and two BFJA Awards.[12] In October 2016, she was nominated as a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha, by the President of India.[13] She served as the President of BJP Mahila Morcha in West Bengal.[14] She served as the General Secretary[15][16] and the Vice-President[17] for the West Bengal Motion Picture Artistes' Forum, a body representing cine artistes.[11] Her films have commulatively grossed more than US$100 million worldwide.[18]\n\nHer first acting assignment was Bijoy Chatterjee's Hindi short film Nirupama (1986) based on Rabindranath Tagore's Bengali short story Dena Paona and broadcast on DD National.[4] Her breakthrough role came with the Bengali TV series Muktabandha (1987) directed by Ramaprasad Banik.[19] She made her big screen debut opposite Chiranjeet in Prabhat Roy's Bengali film Prateek (1988). In 1988, she achieved national recognition for her role in the Hindi TV series Ganadevta and shot to wider fame and popularity after she played Draupadi in B. R. Chopra's Mahabharat (1988–90).[20] Her performance in this TV series earned her several awards including Smita Patil Memorial Award.[21] She reprised the role of Draupadi in Chopra's Mahabharat Katha. She acted in popular Hindi TV series such as Kanoon (1993), Chandrakanta (1994), Karam Apnaa Apnaa (2007), Kasturi (2009), Agle Janam Mohe Bitiya Hi Kijo (2009). Popular Bengali TV series, she acted in, include Janmabhoomi (1997), Draupadi (2000), Ingeet (2001), Tithir Atithi to name a few.[22]\n\nShe achieved critical acclaim for her performance in National Award winning Bengali films such as Padma Nadir Majhi (1992) by Goutam Ghose,[23][24][25] Janani (1993) by Sanat Dasgupta[26][27] and Yugant (1995) by Aparna Sen.[28] She received BFJA Award for Best Supporting Actress twice for her roles in Amal Ray Ghatak's Ujan (1995) and Rituparno Ghosh's Antarmahal (2005).[29] In the same year, she acted in the role of a conceited actress in Anjan Dutt's Tarpor Bhalobasa, which once again earned her critical acclaim.[30] She was conferred with Osian's Cinefan Festival Special Jury Mention for her role in Antarmahal (2005).[31] She was awarded in the Best Actress in a Leading Role category for her role in Sekhar Das's National Award winning Bengali film Krantikaal (2005)[32][33] at the 9th Dhaka International Film Festival.[34] In January 2006, she was named by The Indian Express in the list of the five most powerful actresses of 2005.[35] She was further acclaimed for her roles in films such as Kaaler Rakhal (2009), Chowrasta - The Crossroads of Love (2009), Chaurahen (2012), Na Hannyate (2012), Dutta Vs Dutta (2012) and Punascha (2014). In 2011, she received the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for rendering her voice in Aditi Roy's Bengali film Abosheshey (2012).[36][37] Goutam Ghose said that \"she has that skill to transform herself into any character she plays.\"[10] Rituparno Ghosh described her as \"a roisterer of pathos and exuberance through the portrayal of her characters.\"[10]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nGanguly was born to Samarendra Lal Ganguly and Juthika Ganguly on 25 November 1966.[38][39][3] She grew up in a joint family. She was a student of Beltala Girls' High School from which she finished her secondary examination.[39] She completed her Higher Secondary Education from Jodhpur Park Girls' High School.[40] Later, she obtained a bachelor's degree from the Jogamaya Devi College, an affiliated undergraduate women's college of University of Calcutta, in Kolkata.[39][41] Ganguly had to face financial problem during her college days.\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nGanguly never intended to be an actress. After she completed her graduation, she was suggested by some of her relatives to pursue acting.[3] She attended a wedding ceremony where she was introduced to Bijoy Chatterjee who was looking for a fresh face with unplucked eyebrows to play the female lead in his Hindi short film Nirupama (1986) based on Rabindranath Tagore's Bengali short story Dena Paona. Ganguly was initially hesitant to accept his proposal but later gave her nod on the insistence of her aunt.[4] Soumitra Chatterjee who played the father to her character in the film helped her get into the role of the heroine.[42] Impressed with her potential, Soumitra Chatterjee cast her as Mrinal alongside his daughter Poulami Basu playing the role of Bindu in his directorial venture Stree Ki Patra (1986), based on Streer Patra a Bengali short story written by Tagore.[43][44]\n\nGanguly was enjoined by Ramaprasad Banik to appear for a look test for the female lead in his Bengali TV series Muktabandha (1986).[45][46] After she appeared for the look test, Samaresh Majumdar, the screenplay writer of the TV series considered her to be imperfect for the role.[47] The role being that of a call girl, Majumdar wanted an attractive actress to portray it. He suggested Banik to find another actress other than Ganguly whom he considered to be dowdy. Majumdar was requested to meet Ganguly once again. This time Ganguly appeared charming and attractive, and was finalised to portray the female lead. Her performance in the series was appreciated.[48][49] She accepted a role opposite Chiranjeet Chakraborty in Prabhat Roy's Bengali film Prateek (1988).[50] Roy's next venture was Agnitrishna (1989) that once again saw Chiranjeet Chakraborty essaying the male protagonist Abhijit suffering from pyrophobia. Roy cast Ganguly as the female lead opposite Chakraborty. She had to enact the role of the doctor who treats the protagonist.[51] The film failed to win critical favour while Ganguly's performance was critically acclaimed.[52] She also accepted another role opposite Chakraborty in Biresh Chatterjee's Bengali film Tufan (1989). The film was a major financial success.[53] She featured in Mrinal Sen's much acclaimed Hindi Film Ek Din Achanak (1989) and Basu Chatterjee's Hindi film Kamla Ki Maut (1989).\n\nReportedly B.R. Chopra was quite impressed with Ganguly's performance in the TV series Ganadevta. After Juhi Chawla declined the role of Draupadi for Mahabharat, Chopra decided to get her appear for a screen test for the role. In 1988, she was summoned by director Biresh Chatterjee to NT1 Studio where the director informed her that Chopra wanted her to appear for the look test.[54] Ramya Krishnan was also another strong candidate to portray the role. Ganguly was finally chosen since her Hindi diction was better.[55] In 1989, the 34th episode of the series introduced her. She was hailed for her performance in the Game of Dice sequence.[56] The sequence was aired in the 46th, 47th and 48th episodes of the series. The sequence narrates Draupadi being dragged to the court by Dushasana. She then asks Bhishma, a veteran of the Kuru clan whether Yudhishthira has the right to put her in stake. The sequence demanded her to weep while enacting the part. She was so engrossed that she wept on even after her shot was over.[57][58][59][60][61] She later claimed that her performance in the TV series was quite mediocre.[62]\n\nGanguly received wide attention from Bollywood media and producers for her role in Chopra's Mahabharat, yet she never had a significant elevation in her Bollywood career. She said that things became very hard since she was an outsider and had to face the problem of casting couch.[63] She featured as Rama in Tariq Shah's Hindi film Baahar Aane Tak (1990). The film did not meet financial success.[64] Onwards, she appeared in films such as K. Bapayya's Pyar Ka Devta (1991), Raj Sippy's Saugandh (1991) and Rajkumar Kohli's Virodhi (1992) to name a few. In 1991, she acted in the blockbuster Kannada film Police Matthu Dada, directed by Tulsi Ramsay and Shyam Ramsay. In the same year, she appeared in its Hindi remake titled Inspector Dhanush. The film flopped at the box office. In 1992, she acted in A. V. Seshagiri Rao's Telugu film Inspector Bhavani, where she played the character of a sincere police officer whose object is to bring an end to those who assassinated her fiancée.[65] In the same year, she acted in Sukanta Roy's Bengali film Pitrireen, where she played the character of Sathi, a photographer who inquires about her father's assassin.\n\nIn 1992, she appeared in Goutam Ghose's award-winning Bengali film Padma Nadir Majhi, where she played the character of Kapila, a woman from the fishermen community who falls for her sister's husband and finally leaves her family to settle with him on Moynadeep island. Her performance in this film was appreciated by the critics and media personalities. Utpal Dutt, who was also a part of this venture, was recorded to comment on her performance: \"Roopa has really lived the life of Kapila with those flawless body languages of a woman from the fisherman community.\"[66]\n\nIn 1995, She accepted a role in Ravi Chopra's Kanoon on the latter's insistence.[67] In 1995, she appeared in Amal Roy Ghatak's Bengali film Ujan, which won her the BFJA Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1996. In 1996, she appeared in Aparna Sen's award-winning Bengali film Yugant, where she played the character of an obsessed dancer. Her performance in the film won favourable reviews.[68] Apart from acting in feature films, she went on appearing in numerous telefilms and television series, both in Bengali and Hindi, including Sukanya (1998).[69]\n\nIn 2000, she appeared in Rituparno Ghosh's award-winning Bengali film Bariwali, where she played the character of Sudeshna Mitra, an actress playing the character of Binodini, in a film Chokher Bali directed, alongside the male protagonist. In 2001, she appeared in a cameo role in Goutam Ghose's award-winning Bengali film Dekha. Though she made a cameo appearance in it, she garnered huge mass attention as the film was widely advertised on her enthralling dialogue; \"Sagar dekhben naa, shudhu amake dekhun.\" In the film, she rendered her character with a fine, seductive approach, especially in the Eki Labonyo Purna Prate song sequence, where the character played by Soumitra Chatterjee recalls an earlier moment of Ganguly gazing back at him.[70] In 2003, she appeared in Gautam Ghose's Bengali film Abar Aranye, where she played the character of Shimul, a buoyant woman who is grief-stricken at the deepest core of her heart for the probable loss of her husband. She appeared in a cameo role in Bow Barracks Forever (2004) by Anjan Dutt.[71]\n\nIn 2005, she appeared in Rituparno Ghosh's award-winning Bengali film Antarmahal, where she played the character of Mahamaya, a docile wife to an arrogant zamindar. Her performance in the film was hugely appreciated by film critics.[72][73][74] Indian film critic Piyush Roy wrote on her performance in the film, \"Ganguly rekindles memories of her fiery act of Draupadi in B R Chopra’s Mahabharat through her blow hot, blow cold performance.\"[75]\n\nShe herself considered this role as a big challenge as it was inherently contrary to her personality.[37] The film won her the BFJA Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2006. Reportedly Mira Nair was all praise for Ganguly's performance in the film after the former had attended a private screening of the film in USA. Nair proposed her to play the role of Asima's mother in The Namesake.[77] Ganguly eschewed the offer since the role was not meaty enough. She then, featured in Sekhar Das's award-winning Bengali film Krantikaal (2005), where she played the character of Subarna, who befriends a terrorist who broke into her house.[78] She appeared in Raj Mukherjee's Bengali film Nagordola (2005), where she portrayed the character of an arrogant and rude woman who gets diagnosed as having throat cancer and realises that life is not like it has conventionally been and gives her full consent to her own unmarried daughter to give birth of her baby and to bring it up. The film was a major hit at the box office for its contemporary social issue. Her performance in the film earn her an Anandalok Award nomination in the Best Actress in the Leading Role category in 2006.[citation needed] She acted in the much acclaimed Bengali film Ek Mutho Chabi (2005), produced by herself, where she played the character of an established actress who has a car accident, consequently losing her career.[79][80] In December 2005, Ganguly was named by The Telegraph in the list of Five Crowning Queens of 2005 alongside Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta, Konkona Sen Sharma and Vidya Balan.[81]\n\nIn 2006, she accepted a role of a writer in Karam Apnaa Apnaa produced by Balaji Telefilms and shifted her base to Mumbai.[82] She then appeared in Hindi TV series such as Love Story and Agle Janam Mohe Bitiya Hi Kijo (2009).\n\nEverything was fine. I don't mind if my role is not getting enough prominence as long as the character is meaty enough because that's how soaps are made today. I also don't mind if I am given less work. But I am a very sensitive and creative person. I felt that there was no respect for a senior actor like me. Money is everywhere but one doesn't work only for money. If there is no respect for the work one does then money is not worth the effort. On the last day of my shoot for Kasturi, I signed the register but didn't accept my pay-packet because I shot only for a few close-up shots. I didn't see any point in taking payment for only five minutes of work.\n\n— Ganguly on quitting Ekta Kapoor's Kasturi[20]\n\nIn 2009, she appeared in Sekhar Das's Bengali film Kaaler Rakhal.[83] She appeared in Anjan Dutt's film Chowrasta the Crossroads of love (2009).[84]\n\nIn 2011, she won the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for rendering her voice in Aditi Roy's Bengali film Abosheshey (2012)[85] where she also acted.

She sustained head injuries and had to be admitted to hospital.[100]\n\nShe was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in October 2016 in place of cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned earlier.[101][102][103]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nGanguly was married to Dhrubo Mukerjee, a mechanical engineer hailing from West Bengal, Kolkata from 1992 until 2007.[104] They have one child, a son, born in 1997, Aakash Mukherjee.[5][105] She was in a live-in relationship with the Bengali singer Dibyendu Mukherjee.
