        "text": "New year -> new beginning = new experiences. 🌟 Embracing the New Year with open arms and a heart full of lessons learned. As I reflect on the past year, 2023 has been a remarkable journey of self-discovery, new connections, and invaluable insights. 🚀 Meeting incredible individuals and understanding the true essence of where to invest my time has been a game-changer.🔍 In the pursuit of my goals, I've often found myself caught in the web of perfectionism. But this year, I've decided to loosen the reins, allowing myself the grace to navigate without the burden of rigid plans. 🌈 I've learned that sometimes the most significant growth happens when we give ourselves the freedom to flow. 🎉 Here's to a 2024 filled with gentle strides toward my aspirations, without the weight of undue pressure. 🌠 Let's all make a pact to be kinder to ourselves and savor the journey, understanding that life's beauty lies in its unpredictable twists and turns. Wishing everyone a Happy New Year filled with health, joy, and continuous growth. 🌱 ✨ Cheers to the unique adventures that lie ahead!✨ 🥂 #NewYear #Reflections #GrowthMindset #HappyNewYear2024 #SelfDiscovery #GoalSetting #LinkedInPost\n\n2023 was not the first year that happened while I was busy making other plans. 2023 was not the first year that found and left me questioning everything, including and especially myself. 2023 was not the first year full of risk, reward, consequence, gratitude, and responsibility. 2023 was not the first year for retreat, rebalance, peace, pleasure, and rest. 2023 was not the first year, nor the worst year, and by far not the best year. But it sure was one hell of a year, eh? ~ 2024's intention? To create. Here are a couple of projects I did for myself this year to get me warmed up. https://lnkd.in/dgs6GWVj #onward\n\n🌟 One Month and a Half in Vienna: Lessons from a Bold Leap 🌟 Just over a month ago, I made a life-altering decision to pause my career and dive into a period of study, all while relocating to the beautiful city of Vienna. This journey, taken in my mid-20s, has been nothing short of a rollercoaster of emotions, challenges, and invaluable lessons. Here, I share three critical insights from this unique experience: 1. Adapting is not going to be easy 🥲: Stepping into a new country, culture, and education system all at once has tested my limits in unexpected ways. Every day is a learning curve, pushing me to embrace flexibility and resilience. It's a reminder that growth often lies outside our comfort zones. 2. Migration grief is real ✈️: Leaving behind everything familiar - my job, friends, and routines - has brought about a sense of loss I hadn't anticipated. Acknowledging this grief has been crucial in my journey towards acceptance and finding new grounds to call home. 3. Frustration is normal, but building tolerance is key💪🏼 : Facing hurdles and feeling stuck at times is a part of the process. However, I've learned the importance of patience and building a tolerance for frustration. It's about finding balance, seeking progress over perfection, and understanding that every small step forward counts. This adventure has been a profound learning experience, teaching me more about myself and the world around me than I could have imagined. To those considering a similar leap, know that it's a path filled with challenges, but the rewards of personal growth and new perspectives are unparalleled. Let's embrace the journey ahead, with all its ups and downs. 🚀 #LifeInVienna #CareerBreak #PersonalGrowth #ExpatriateLife #Mid20sJourney\n\nAs we step into the exciting new year of 2024, I wanted to take a moment to share some wishes with all of you. It is my sincere hope that this year brings you immense joy, fulfillment, and success in all aspects of your life. As we embark on this fresh chapter, let us remember the importance of balance. In the midst of our busy schedules and endless responsibilities, it's crucial to pause and reflect on the delicate equilibrium between work and personal life.

May this year be an opportunity for self-improvement and skill enhancement. Let's dedicate time to invest in ourselves, whether it's pursuing a new hobby, learning something new, or honing our existing skills. Remember, personal growth is a journey that adds immense value to both our personal and professional lives. Above all, I wish you good health. May 2024 be a year filled with vitality, energy, and the strength to overcome any challenges that come your way. Take the time to nurture both your physical and mental well-being, for they are the true foundations of a fulfilling life.

Although a fictional ending and beginning, the New Year can be a time of reflection, a time to think about the path we are on: ❓ What do I want to let go of and leave behind in 2023? ❓ How do I want to feel in 2024? What do I need to do on a regular basis to feel that way? ❓ Which people do I want to give more space to in 2024, the people that nourish my soul and heart? ❓ What adventures do I want to have in 2024? What do I want to experience, learn, see? But new beginnings are often bittersweet, filled with excitement and also fear of the unknown. It means being patient with yourself (and others). You might initially regret having taken the plunge. But, after you are in the water for a while, you begin to adapt. What was first intimidating is now approachable. What felt cold is now tranquility. It means finding your cave, where you are safe to be vulnerable and grow into your new shell. And it means normalizing the uncomfortable. We often forget that uncomfortable feelings are normal whenever we do something we have never done before. I wish you all a wonderful 2024, a year filled with new beginnings, endings, and paths continuing! 🎉\n\n🌍 **Unlocking New Horizons: The Significance of Moving** 🌍 Whether it's across town or across continents, the decision to move is often a pivotal moment in our lives.

A few days ago, I faced an unexpected health issue. This challenging experience deeply influenced my perspective on life and reminded me once again how precious and correct my philosophy of \"live the life good\" is. To know the value of every moment, to care for our health and loved ones... This experience has shown how fragile yet valuable life is. Life gives us important lessons at unexpected times, and these lessons truly strengthen our life philosophy. 2023 was a year spent in the intensity of corporate life, enlightened by these experiences. While sharing my experiences with my valuable colleagues, I realized that each experience taught me important lessons not only in my professional life but also in my personal development. However, the biggest gain of this year was finding the courage to chart a new path for myself. On this path, I focused on learning new things and developing by stepping out of my comfort zone. Every challenge strengthens me and reminds me once again that there are no limits to learning. As we enter the year 2024, a hopeful period begins for our world and our country. Social and economic changes around the world are making us all more conscious and connected to each other. Significant developments are also taking place in our country, and these developments are further strengthening us as a society. The new year means new hopes and goals. In 2024, I will have these three main focuses for myself, our country, and the world: 1. Unity and Solidarity:Let it be a year where we are emotionally closer to each other and overcome challenges together. 2. Continuous Learning and Development: Let's focus on continuous learning and development, both individually and socially. 3. Creating Positive Impact: Let's aim to make every action we take and every word we say leave a positive impact on our society and the world. 2024 will unite our emotions and goals at a common point. Each of us has the potential to leave a positive mark in this world. Let's not forget that strength comes from unity, and together everything is possible. May the new year bring health, happiness, and success to us all!\n\nJust devoured my former #INSEAD classmate and friend Nicolo' Andreula and his co-author Vera Sprothen's book, \"The Flow Generation: A Survival Guide for Unpredictable Times.\" The book resonated deeply as I gear up for 2024, planning my portfolio career's next moves. (This year, I turned my 'play' into my work, and it's been a thrilling ride so far!) I am super excited about blending work, travel, home life, and investing in experiences that ignite my passion, and reading about this '#flow' trend in the book not only validated my inklings but also made me feel more hopeful and excited about the future! Some of my key takeaways from the book are: 1️⃣ The World's #Changed: Fluidity and Adaptability: Remember the days when work was a fixed, physical 9-to-5 grind? Well, technology has tossed those notions out the window, leaving us with a world where everything's in flux – our jobs, our homes, our bosses… it's all up for grabs. This book paints a vivid picture of our new reality, urging us to embrace fluidity and adaptability as our new survival skills as well as reasons to thrive. 2️⃣ Beyond #Fear: Embracing the Unknown: The book talks about shedding the shackles of fear and embracing the unknown, the very essence of the Flow Generation. It's about recognizing that uncertainty doesn't mean a lack of control; rather, it presents an opportunity to innovate, experiment, and forge our own paths. How exciting! 3️⃣ Stories of #Adaptation & Inspiring Examples of #Flow: The book is packed with real-life stories of individuals who have mastered the art of flow, transforming their careers, lifestyles, and overall well-being. From pivoting from corporate jobs to pursuing passion projects to embracing nomadic lifestyles, these stories are sources of inspiration, reminding us that 'saving for a FUTURE house' and missing out on life experiences NOW is no longer the norm, and is even rather boring. 4️⃣ Redefining #Meaning and #Purpose: Lastly, I think Flow Generation strikes a chord at a deeper level. While it's easy to get caught up in the uncertainty and fluidity of our lives, it also opens up a world of possibilities, inviting us to rethink what we truly desire from life and work. A Huge Thank You to Nicolo' Andreula and Vera Sprothen for this insightful and thought-provoking book. It's a must-read for anyone contemplating a fluid career and life mix, or simply curious about WHAT THE 'FLOW' this next generation future of work culture is all about. #FlowGeneration #BookRecommendation #WorktoLive #PortfolioCareers P.S. It was also a special bonus treat to read about Toby Frankenstein & Victor Trokoudes 📖 🥂"
