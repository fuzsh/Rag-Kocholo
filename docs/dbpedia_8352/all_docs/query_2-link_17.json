        "text": "Indian actress and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (1948–2016)\n\nIn this Indian name, the name Jayaram is a patronymic, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Jayalalithaa.\n\nJayaram Jayalalithaa[b] (24 February 1948 – 5 December 2016) was an Indian politician and actress who served as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for more than fourteen years over six terms between 1991 and 2016. From 1 January 1988 to 5 December 2016, she was the 5th and longest-serving general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK),[4] a Dravidian party whose cadre revered her as their \"Amma\" (Mother) and \"Puratchi Thalaivi\" (Revolutionary leader).[5]\n\nJayalalithaa rose to prominence as a leading film actress in the mid-1960s. Though she had begun her acting career reluctantly at her mother's behest to support the family, Jayalalithaa was a prolific actor. She appeared in 140 films between 1961 and 1980, primarily in the Tamil, Telugu and Kannada languages. Jayalalithaa received praise for her versatility as an actress and her dancing skills, earning the sobriquet \"Queen of Tamil Cinema\".[6]\n\nAmong her frequent co-stars was M. G. Ramachandran. In 1982, when M. G. Ramachandran was chief minister, Jayalalithaa joined AIADMK, the party he founded. Her political rise was rapid; within a few years she became AIADMK propaganda secretary and was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's Parliament. After M.G.R.'s death in 1987, Jayalalithaa proclaimed herself as his political heir and, having fought off the faction headed by M.G.R.'s widow, V. N. Janaki Ramachandran, emerged as the sole leader of the AIADMK. Following the 1989 election, she became Leader of the Opposition to the DMK-led government led by M. Karunanidhi, her bête noire.\n\nIn 1991, Jayalalithaa became chief minister for the first time and Tamil Nadu's youngest. She earned a reputation for centralising state power among a coterie of bureaucrats; her council of ministers, whom she often shuffled around, were largely ceremonial in nature. The successful cradle-baby scheme, which enabled mothers to anonymously offer their newborns for adoption, emerged during this time. Despite an official salary of only a rupee a month, Jayalalithaa indulged in public displays of wealth, culminating in a lavish wedding for her foster son V. N. Sudhakaran (Sasikala's elder sister son) on 7 September 1995. In the 1996 election, the AIADMK was nearly wiped out at the hustings; Jayalalithaa herself lost her seat. The new Karunanidhi government filed several corruption cases against her, and she had to spend time in jail.\n\nHer fortunes revived in the 1998 general election, as the AIADMK became a key component of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 1998–99 government; her withdrawal of support toppled it and triggered another general election just a year later.\n\nThe AIADMK returned to power in 2001, although Jayalalithaa was personally disbarred from contesting due to the corruption cases. Within a few months of her taking oath as chief minister, in September 2001, she was disqualified from holding office and forced to cede the chair to minister O. Panneerselvam. Upon her acquittal six months later, Jayalalithaa returned as chief minister to complete her term. Noted for its ruthlessness to political opponents, many of whom were arrested in midnight raids, her government grew unpopular. Another period (2006–11) in the opposition followed, before Jayalalithaa was sworn in as chief minister for the fourth time after the AIADMK swept the 2011 assembly election.\n\nHer government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda, which included several subsidised \"Amma\"-branded goods such as canteens, bottled water, salt and cement. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a disproportionate-assets case, rendering her disqualified to hold office. She returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In the 2016 assembly election, she became the first Tamil Nadu chief minister since M.G.R in 1984 to be voted back into office. That September, she fell severely ill and, following 75 days of hospitalisation, died on 5 December 2016 due to cardiac arrest and became the first female chief minister in India to die in office.\n\nJayalalithaa never married and had no children.[7]\n\nOn 29 May 2020, her nephew, J. Deepak, and niece, Deepa Jayakumar, were declared as her legal heirs by Madras High Court.[8] Her critics in the media and the opposition accused her of fostering a personality cult and of demanding absolute loyalty from AIADMK legislators and ministers.[9]\n\nEarly life, education and family\n\n[edit]\n\nJayalalithaa was born on 24 February 1948 to Jayaram and Vedavalli (Sandhya) in a Tamil Brahmin Mandayam Iyengar family at Melukote, Pandavapura taluk, Mandya district, then in Mysore State (now Karnataka). She had a brother, Jayakumar.[10][11][12][13][14]\n\nHer paternal grandfather, Narasimhan Rengachary, was in the service of the Mysore kingdom as a surgeon and served as the court physician to Maharaja Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV of Mysore. Her maternal grandfather, Rangasamy Iyengar, moved to Mysore from Srirangam to work with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. He had one son and three daughters—Ambujavalli, Vedavalli, and Padmavalli. Vedavalli was married to Jayaram, son of Narasimhan Rengachary. The couple Jayaram-Vedvalli had two children: a son, Jayakumar, and a daughter, Jayalalitha.[15] Her mother, her relatives and later co-stars and friends referred to her as Ammu.[16]\n\nShe is of the same lineage [clarification needed] of popular figures like K. T. Bhashyam (former minister of Mysore State) and Chairman of Mysore Legislative Council) and famous lawyer L. S. Raju who made significant contribution in the history of Mysore State (Now Karnataka).[17]\n\nJayalalithaa's father, Jayaram, was a lawyer but never worked and squandered most of the family's wealth. He died when Jayalalithaa was two years old. The widowed Vedavalli returned to her father's home in Bangalore in 1950.[9] Vedavalli learnt shorthand and typewriting to take up a clerical position to help support the family in 1950. Her younger sister Ambujavalli had moved to Madras, working as an air hostess. She also started acting in drama and films using the screen name Vidyavathy. On the insistence of Ambujavalli, Jayalalithaa's mother Vedavalli also relocated to Madras and stayed with her sister from 1952. Vedavalli worked in a commercial firm in Madras and began dabbling in acting from 1953 under the screen name Sandhya. Jayalalithaa remained under the care of her mother's sister Padmavalli and maternal grandparents from 1950 to 1958 in Mysore.[9][15] While still in Bangalore, Jayalalithaa attended Bishop Cotton Girls' School, Bangalore.[18]\n\nAfter her aunt Padmavalli's marriage in 1958, Jayalalithaa moved to Madras to live with her mother. She completed her education at Sacred Heart Matriculation School (popularly known as Church Park Presentation Convent or Presentation Church Park Convent).[15][19]\n\nShe excelled at school and was offered a government scholarship to pursue further education.[18] She won Gold State Award for coming first in 10th standard in the state of Tamil Nadu. She joined Stella Maris College, Chennai; however, discontinued her studies due to pressure from her mother and became a film actress.[20][21]\n\nThe Poes Garden plot was bought by Jayalalithaa and her mother on 1 July 1967 at a cost of ₹ 1.32 lakh, measuring around 24,000 sq. feet (10 grounds) with a built-up area of 21,662 sq. feet.[22][23] Jayalalithaa's mother Sandhya died in November 1971 at the age of 47.[24] Jayalalithaa held the housewarming ceremony of her residence Veda Nilayam (named after her beloved mother Vedavalli alias Sandhya) on 15 May 1972, early in the morning, followed by dinner and a Veena recital by classical musician Chitti babu in the evening.[25] Her brother's wedding took place at her Veda Nilayam home in Poes Garden in 1972.[26][27] Her brother Jayakumar, his wife Vijayalakshmi and their daughter, Deepa Jayakumar, lived in Poes Garden with Jayalalithaa till 1978[28] and then moved to T.Nagar Madras at the bungalow 'Sandhya Illam' which was bought by mother of Jayalalithaa.[29] Her brother was unhappy with adoption of Sudhakaran, a relative of Sasikala, as foster son of Jayalalithaa.[30] Jayalalithaa had adopted Sasikala's nephew Sudhakaran in 1995 and disowned him in 1996.[31] Her brother died in 1995 of heart attack.[32]\n\nShe was fluent in several languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, Malayalam and English.[33] She often conversed with Karnataka Chief ministers in Kannada. Basavaraj Bommai, the former irrigation minister and later chief minister of Karnataka said, \"I was astonished by her Kannada slang and fluency.\"[34][35]\n\nShe was fond of dogs as her pets. But after the death of Julie, a spitz, in 1998, she could not bear the loss and discontinued keeping pet dogs at her home.[36]\n\nFilm career\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Jayalalitha filmography\n\nEarly career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Madras (now Chennai), Jayalalithaa was trained in Carnatic music, western classical piano[37] and various forms of classical dance, including Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Mohiniyattam, Manipuri, Kathak.[38] She learnt Bharatnatyam and dance forms under K.J.Sarasa.[39] She had also learnt Kuchipudi under Padma Bhushan Guru Dr. Vempati Chinna Satyam. She became an accomplished dancer and gave her debut dance performance at the Rasika Ranjani Sabha in Mylapore in May 1960.[40] The Chief Guest at the Arangetram was Shivaji Ganesan, who called her a \"thanga silai\" (golden statue) and expressed wish that Jayalalithaa becomes a film star in future.[41][42]\n\nWhile a child, Jayalalithaa acted in the Kannada-language film Sri Shaila Mahathme (1961), which starred Rajkumar and Krishna Kumari.[43] She had been taken to the studio by her mother as she was shooting in the same premises for a different film. While Jayalalithaa was watching the shooting, a problem arose as the child actress playing the Goddess Parvathy in a school drama scene in the film failed to show up and the producer Neerlahalli Thalikerappa and director Aroor Pattabhi asked Sandhya if Jayalalithaa could be asked to act in the dance sequence. Sandhya agreed and Jayalalithaa was swiftly dressed up as Parvathy and the scene was shot in Sri Shaila Mahatme.[44]\n\nShe played Krishna in a three-minute dance sequence held on stage in the Hindi film Man-Mauji (1962) and danced with Kumari Naaz who played Radha. Y. G. Parthasarathy ran the drama troupe United Amateur Artistes (UAA), which staged English and Tamil plays. Soon Jayalalithaa while a schoolgirl began acting in some plays of Parthasarathy along with her mother and aunt. She acted in small roles in plays such as Tea House of the August Moon and Undersecretary between 1960 and 1964.\n\nShankar Giri, the son of the former Indian President V. V. Giri, saw her small role in the English play Tea Houses of August Moon and was impressed. Shankar Giri approached her mother Sandhya and told he wanted to cast her daughter in an English film called The Epistle. Sandhya reluctantly agreed with the condition that shooting should be held only during weekends or school holidays.[40]\n\nSandhya had acted in the 1964 Tamil film Karnan, produced and directed by Kannada film-maker B. R. Panthulu. Jayalalithaa accompanied her mother to a party related to the film and was spotted by Panthulu, who then decided to cast her opposite Kalyan Kumar in the Kannada movie Chinnada Gombe. He promised to finish all shooting within two months in order not to interfere with her education. Since Jayalalithaa would be studying for her PUC in two months' time, Sandhya had declined the offer initially.[45] Sandhya agreed when that promise was made and Jayalalithaa started acting and she was paid ₹3,100 (equivalent to ₹170,000 or US$2,000 in 2023). Panthulu kept his promise and completed shooting in six weeks. Jayalalithaa had forgotten all about films after acting in her Kannada debut film and had got ready to attend classes at Stella Maris as she had the ambition to be a lawyer. But the Kannada debut film became a blockbuster in 1964 and she became a well-known face.\n\nMeanwhile, Jayalalithaa continued acting in Parthasarathy's plays. She played the leading role in plays such as Malathi, The Whole Truth, and the dance drama Kaveri Thanda Kalaiselvi between 1960 and 1966. She made her debut as the lead actress in Kannada films while still in school, age 15, in Chinnada Gombe (1964).[45] She also appeared in a dance sequence of a song named \"Malligeya Hoovinantha\" in the movie Amarashilpi Jakanachari (1964).[9]\n\nShe made her debut in Tamil theatre in April 1964, when she played a sales girl in the drama named Undersecretary. Parthasarathy and Sandhya were the lead characters, while Jayalalitha and Cho Ramaswamy were paired together and A. R. Srinivasan was also involved. The play was based on the lives of middle aged couple and Jayalaithaa played character of sales girl in the drama. Her performance caused Parthasarathy to make her lead heroine in a drama named Malathy. Meanwhile, the films she had shot during her vacation in April–May 1964—Chinnada Gombe and Manushulu Mamathalu—became blockbusters. By end of 1965, she had become popular among film producers and directors.[45] She was approached by C. V. Sridhar for her Tamil film debut as well. Between 1964 and 1966 she did around 35 shows of drama named Malathy and later discontinued as she became very busy in films.[40] It was during the year 1964, financial debts had increased of Sandhya and she suggested her daughter make use of the increasing film offers to come her way.[46]\n\nJayalalithaa's debut in Tamil cinema was the leading role in Vennira Aadai (1965), directed by C. V. Sridhar.[39] She made her debut in Telugu films as lead actress in Manushulu Mamathalu opposite Akkineni Nageswara Rao. Her last Telugu release was also opposite Akkineni Nageswara Rao in the film Nayakudu Vinayakudu, which was released in 1980.[47] She was the first heroine to appear in skirts in Tamil films.[48] She acted in one Hindi film called Izzat, with Dharmendra as her male costar in 1968.[49] She starred in 28 box-office hit films with M.G. Ramachandran between 1965 and 1973.[50] The first with M.G.R. was B.R. Panthalu's Aayirathil Oruvan in 1965 and their last film together was Pattikaattu Ponnaiya in 1973.[51]\n\nJayalalithaa donated gold jewelleries she had to the then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.[52]\n\nShe had 11 successful releases in Tamil in 1966. In the opening credits of Arasa Kattalai, for the first time her name was affixed with the phrase \"Kavarchi Kanni\".[53] In 1967 she bought her bungalow, Veda Nilayam, in Poes Gardens for ₹132,000 (equivalent to ₹7.0 million or US$84,000 in 2023).[54]\n\nSandow M. M. A. Chinnappa Thevar was on the lookout for a regular heroine for his production after he had fight with the actress Savitri after the release of Vetaikkaran, and he signed Jayalalithaa on in 1965. She became a regular heroine for production house Devar films from 1966.[55]\n\nJaishankar was romantically paired with Jayalalithaa in eight Tamil films including Muthu Chippi, Yaar Nee?, Nee!, Vairam, Vandhale Magarasi, Bommalattam (1968), Raja Veetu Pillai and Avalukku Aayiram Kangal, whereas the films Thanga Gopuram and Gowri Kalyanam had him play elder brother to her.[citation needed]\n\nJayalalithaa acted in twelve films as heroine opposite N. T. Rama Rao, in Telugu—Gopaludu Bhoopaludu (1967), Chikkadu Dorakadu (1967), Tikka Sankaraiah (1968), Niluvu Dopidi (1968), Baghdad Gaja Donga (1968), Kathanayakudu (1969), Kadaladu Vadaladu (1969), Gandikota Rahasyam (1969), Ali Baba 40 Dongalu (1970), Sri Krishna Vijayamu (1970), Sri Krishna Satya (1972), and Devudu Chesina Manushulu (1973). Jayalalitha had eight films with Akkineni Nageswara Rao in Telugu—Manushulu Mamathalu (1965), Aastiparulu (1966), Brahmachari (1968), Aadarsa Kutumbam (1969), Adrushtavanthulu (1969), Bharya Biddalu (1972), Premalu Pellillu (1974) and Nayakudu Vinayakudu (1980).\n\nShe also made a guest appearance in Telugu film Navarthi (1966). Her films in Telugu also included two with Krishna and one each with Sobhan Babu, Jaggayya, Ramakrishna and Haranath.[56] She was given on-screen credit as Kalai Selvi in most of her Tamil films since 1967.[45]\n\nLater career\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween 1965 and 1973, Jayalalithaa starred opposite M. G. Ramachandran in a number of successful films, including Aayirathil Oruvan, Kavalkaran, Adimai Penn, Engal Thangam, Kudiyirundha Koyil, Ragasiya Police 115 and Nam Naadu.[49][57] Cho Ramaswamy cast her in the lead role in his directorial venture Yarrukkum Vetkam Illai.[58]\n\nShe acted with Ravichandran in ten films—Gowri Kalyanam (1966), Kumari Penn (1966), Naan (1967), Magarasi (1967), Maadi Veettu Mappilai (1967), Panakkara Pillai (1968), Moondru Yezhuthu (1968), Andru Kanda Mugam (1968), Avalukku Aayiram Kangal and Baghdad Perazhagi (1974).[45] In 1972, she acted opposite Sivaji Ganesan in Pattikada Pattanama, which went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil in 1973.\n\nIn 1973, she acted in Sri Krishna Satya, which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress in Telugu.[59] Her other films with Sivaji Ganesan include Galatta Kalyanam and Deiva Magan; the latter holds the distinction of being the first Tamil film to be submitted by India for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.[60]\n\nJayalalithaa was paired opposite Sivaji Ganesan in 17 films. She acted in six films with R. Muthuraman as a romantic leading pair—Dhikku Theriyadha Kaattil, Thirumangalyam, Kanavan Manaivi, Avandhan Manidhan, Suryagandhi, Anbu Thangai[45] and Muthuraman played supporting roles in Kannan En Kadhalan, Major Chandrakanth, Naan, En Annan, Adi Parashakti, Thaer Thiruvizha, Dharmam Engey, Chitra Pournami and Oru Thaai Makkal. She made her debut in Malayalam with Jesus (1973).[61] Her 100th film was Thirumangalyam (1974), directed by A. Vincent.[62]\n\nShe was romantically paired opposite Sivakumar in Kandan Karunai and Sri Krishna Leela. Sivakumar played supporting roles in Shakti Leelai, Yarrukum Vetkam Ilali, Thirumangalyam, Annaivelakanni, Kavalkaran, Motoram Sunderapillai and Ganga Gowri.[63]\n\nIn 1972, Jayalalithaa was invited to perform with her dance troupe in Mysore for the Dussehra exhibition. Due to her busy shooting schedule and health reasons, Jayalalithaa had to cancel the performance at the last minute. Vatal Nagaraj's Karnataka-based political outfit condemned her for cancelling her dance performance in spite of being a Kannadiga girl. Jayalalithaa responded by issuing a statement contradicting him in an interview to Vikatan magazine that she was a Tamilian and not a Kannadiga. Jayalalithaa was at Premier studio in Mysuru for the shooting of the B. R. Panthulu's film Ganga Gowri. The group of Kannada activists from Vatal Nagaraj's outfit got to know of this and invaded the studio premises. The mob surrounded Jayalalithaa and demanded that she withdraw her statement of being a Tamil woman. Jayalalithaa was defiant even when mob had encircled her. \"I am a Tamil girl, not a Kannada girl,\" Jayalalithaa responded loudly in Tamil, refusing to bow even as protestors gathered around her.[35][64]\n\nThe heroes of her films never objected to the title of the film being conferred on the female lead played by Jayalalithaa. Adimai Penn, Kanni Thaai, and Kannan En Kadhalan had Ramachandran as the lead male hero but the story and the title was built around the character played by Jayalalithaa. Similarly, Engerindo Vandhaal, Sumathi En Sundari, Paadhukaappu and Anbai Thedi had Sivaji Ganeshan as the male lead but the title and the story was built around her character. She did many female-centric films where the story revolved on her character, such as Vennira Adai, Yaar Nee?, Kumari Penn, Nee, Gowri Kalyanam, Magaraasi, Muthu Chippi, Thanga Gopuram, Avalukku Ayiram Kangal, Annamitta Kai, Vandhaale Magaraasi, Suryagandhi, Thirumangalyam, Yarukkum Vetkam Illai, and Kanavan Manaivi.[citation needed]\n\nShe received the title \"Nadippuku Ilakkium Vahuthavar\" from then Chief Minister Karunanidhi[65] and also won Tamil Nadu Cinema Fan Award for Best Actress for her 100th film Thirumangalyam in 1974.[66] Her last film in Tamil was Nadhiyai Thedi Vandha Kadal (1980).[49] Her last film as the heroine was Nayakudu Vinayakudu in Telugu,[67] which became the highest grosser of the year in Telugu.\n\nHer successful Kannada films include Badukuva Daari (1966), Mavana Magalu (1965), Nanna Kartavya (1965), Chinnada Gombe (1964) and Mane Aliya (1964). Jayalalithaa holds the record for having been the Tamil actress with maximum silver jubilee hits in her career—85 hits of 92 Tamil films as main female lead heroine and she also has all 28 films in Telugu as silver jubilee hits.[46] She was the highest-paid Indian actress from 1965 to 1980. She made guest appearances in nine films and six of her films were dubbed into Hindi. She had 119 box office hits between 1961 and 1980, of the total 125 films she did as the main female lead. She made a brief appearance in 1992's Neenga Nalla Irukkanum.[68]\n\nShe acted in mythological films like Kandan Karunai, Aadhi Parashakti, Shri Krishna Satya, Shri Krishna Vijayam, Shri Rama Katha, Shri Krishna Leela, Shakti Leelai, Ganga Gowri, Annai Velankanni and Jesus. Her period dramas include Ayirathil Oruvan, Neerum Neruppum, Mani Magudam, Adimai Penn, Ali Baba 40 Dongalu, Arasa Katalai, and Baghdad Perazhagi.\n\nShe acquired the reputation of being a multi-faceted actor equally comfortable in fantasy and mythological genres as well as in modern social dramas[69] and hence in 1969, in Tamil Conference, she was given the tag of \"Kaveri Thandha Kalai Selvi\".[70]\n\nShe, Savitri and Saroja Devi have been cited as the first female superstars of Tamil cinema. She did double roles in eight films.[71]\n\nShe received Special Award from Filmfare for her performances in 'Chandhrodhayam', 'Adimai Penn' and 'Engirundho Vandhaal' in the years 1966, 1969 and 1970 as the Filmfare Award for Best Actress was introduced only in 1972.[72] Her performance in Pattikada Pattanama, Suryagandhi were critically acclaimed and won her consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Actress in 1972 and 1973, respectively.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1973, at the peak of her career she took interviews and wrote columns in the magazines like Bommai. She wrote a column-\"Ennangal Sila\" in magazine Thuglak in the 1970s. She also wrote a short story, \"Oravin Kaidhigal\", for the magazine Kalki, \"Manadhai Thotta Malargal\" for Thaai magazine in the early 1980s.[73] She wrote about her own life in a serialised memoir in the Tamil weekly magazine Kumudam.[74]\n\nIn 1980, she decided to voluntarily decline any new film offers. An Australia-based journalist Brian Laul took over the mantle of Piousji ('Khaas Bhat'- The filmi gossip column) wrote an article specifying Jayalalithaa was trying for a comeback but was not being offered any roles. Jayalalithaa chose to respond to him by writing a letter, in which she mentioned that she was not struggling to make any comeback and that she turned down the offer from producer Balaji to star in Billa (1980) alongside Rajinikanth. She added she wanted to pursue other interests and was not interested in pursuing her film career any further.[75][76]\n\nHer closest friends from film industry included Manorama,[77] Cho Ramaswamy,[78] Rajasree, Jamuna, Saroja Devi, Kumari Sachu, Anjali Devi, Sowcar Janaki, Sukumari,[79] Ravichandran, R. Muthuraman, Nagesh, M. N. Nambiar, Vennira Aadai Nirmala, S. A. Asokan, Jaishankar, V. K. Ramasamy, Major Sundarrajan, P. Susheela, Sheela, M. S. Viswanathan, L. R. Eswari, R.S.Manohar.[citation needed]\n\nShe quoted on M. G. Ramachandran, \"He was a very warm and caring kind of a person. And after Mother died, he replaced her in my life. He was everything to me. He was mother, father, brother, friend, philosopher, guide. Everything. He sort of took over my life.\" In many of her interviews she often said she entered films on being asked by her mother and entered politics on request by M. G. Ramachandran.[80]\n\nPolitical career\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly political career\n\n[edit]\n\nJayalalithaa denied claims that M.G.R., who had been chief minister for the state since 1977, was instrumental in introducing her to politics.[9] On 4 June 1982,[81] she joined the AIADMK, which was founded by M.G.R.[82] Her maiden public speech,\"Pennin Perumai\" (The Greatness of a Woman), was delivered at the AIADMK's political conference in the same year at Cuddalore on June 20[83] and was well received. Even the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the Rajya Sabha member Khushwant Singh came to witness her speech which was widely acclaimed for its clarity of diction and elegant prose.[84] Her seat number in Rajya Sabha was 185, which was coincidentally the same as that of what C. N. Annadurai had while he was a member in the Rajya Sabha.[85] On 28 January 1983, she became propaganda secretary for the party succeeding R. Manimaran, who was an MLA and party's chief whip in the Tamil Nadu assembly and she campaigned extensively for the party candidate R. Amirtharaj in the by-election for the Tiruchendur Assembly constituency in February that year.[82][86][87]\n\nM.G.R. wanted her to be a member of the Rajya Sabha because of her fluency in English. She defeated Arcot N. Veeraswami, who is the senior DMK leader in 1984 Rajya Sabha elections.[89][90] Indira Gandhi lauded Jayalalithaa for the various speeches she made on issues including the one on internal security in Rajya Sabha.[91] Jayalalithaa was elected to that body in 1984 and retained her seat until 1989.[92] Jayalalithaa was one of the 16 special guests who were invited to participate the state dinner hosted by then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in honour of Erstwhile Yugoslavian President Veselin Djuranovic at Rashtrapati Bhavan.[93] Her success in her role as propaganda secretary caused resentment among high-ranking members of the party. By engineering a rift between her and M.G.R., these members influenced M.G.R. to stop her writing about her personal life in a Tamil magazine. Despite these machinations, she remained admired by the rank and file of the party.[9] She was given key responsibilities, including in the implementation of the landmark noon-meals scheme when M. G. Ramachandran was the chief minister and this taught her lessons in welfare politics. Under the instructions of MGR, She resigned as the Propaganda Secretary on 20 August 1984 to pacify the disgruntled leaders in the party.[94] Later when M.G.R. fell ill, she campaigned extensively for the party before the 1984 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election.[95]\n\nIn 1984, when M.G.R. was incapacitated due to a stroke, Jayalalithaa was said to have attempted to take over the position of chief minister or the party on the pretext that his health would prevent him from the proper execution of his duties.[96] She successfully led the campaign in the 1984 general elections, in which the AIADMK allied with the Congress.[92] On the midnight of 31 December 1984, When MGR was in United States, Jayalalithaa was unceremoniously turned out of Tamil Nadu House, which was her official residence as a Rajya Sabha M.P. by the coterie against her.[97] She was reappointed as the Propaganda Secretary of the party on 5 September 1985.[98] Following his death in 1987, the AIADMK split into two factions: one supported his widow, V. N. Janaki This faction was called AIADMK (JA) and the other favoured Jayalalithaa called AIADMK (J). Jayalalithaa faction was supported by senior leaders like V. R. Nedunchezhiyan, Panruti S. Ramachandran, Aranganayagam, KKSSR Ramachandran, Thirunavukarasar. On 1 January 1988, Jayalalithaa was elected as the general secretary of AIADMK by the leaders of her faction and It was ratified by the party general council convened by her on the next day.[99][100] Janaki was selected as the Chief Minister on 7 January 1988 with the support of 96 members; due in part to irregularities by speaker P. H. Pandian, who dismissed six members to ease her victory, she won a motion of confidence in the house. However, Rajiv Gandhi used Article 356 of the Constitution of India to dismiss the Janaki-led government and impose president's rule on the state.[9][101][102]\n\nAt the age of 41, Jayalalithaa entered the Assembly successfully contesting the subsequent 1989 elections on the basis of being M.G.R.'s political heir.[103]\n\nLeader of the Opposition, 1989\n\n[edit]\n\nShe was elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1989 as a representative of the Bodinayakkanur constituency. This election saw the Jayalalithaa-led faction of the AIADMK win 27 seats and Jayalalithaa became the first woman to be elected Leader of the Opposition in Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly. She is the first Indian actress and first woman to become an opposition leader in India. On 9 February 1989, the two factions of AIADMK merged and they unanimously accepted Jayalalithaa as the general secretary of the party and the \"Two leaves\" symbol of the party was restored.[40]\n\nOn 25 March 1989, as claimed by the party and a section of the members present in the assembly, amidst heavy violence inside the house among the ruling DMK party members and the opposition, Jayalalithaa was attacked by the ruling DMK members in front of the assembly speaker M. Tamilkudimagan when violence broke out between DMK and AIADMK MLA's after she called Karunanidhi a criminal and when he named and shamed her. Karunanidhi fell on the floor when one of her MLAs rushed towards him. Both Karunanidhi and Jayalaithaa alleged of attacks against them.[104][105][106][107] Jayalalitha left the Assembly with her torn saree drawing a parallel with the shameful disrobing of Draupadi in the epic Mahabharata.[104][108][109] At the peak of the situation, Jayalalithaa was about to leave the house, she vowed to not enter the house \"until as a Chief Minister\".[110][111] In spite of some sections of media terming it as a theatrics, it received a lot of media coverage and sympathy from the public.[112][113][114] During the 1989 general elections, the AIADMK allied with the Congress party and was handed a significant victory by winning 38 out of 39 lok sabha seats in Tamil Nadu. The AIADMK, under her leadership, also won the by-elections in Marungapuri, Madurai East and Peranamallur assembly constituencies.[92]\n\nFirst term as Chief Minister, 1991\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: First Jayalalithaa ministry\n\nIn 1991, following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi days before the elections, her alliance with the Indian National Congress enabled her to ride the wave of sympathy that gave the coalition victory.[115][116] The AIADMK alliance with the Congress won 225 out of the 234 seats contested and won all 39 constituencies in the centre.[92] Re-elected to the assembly, she became the state's youngest chief minister, and the first woman to serve a full term, serving from 24 June 1991 to 12 May 1996.[92][102]\n\nIn 1992, her government introduced the \"Cradle Baby Scheme\". At that time the ratio of male to female in some parts of Tamil Nadu was skewed by the practice of female infanticide and the abortion of female foetuses. The government established centres in some areas, these being equipped to receive and place into adoption unwanted female babies. The scheme was extended in 2011.[117] Her party had 226 elected members to the assembly. Her government was the first to introduce police stations operated solely by women. She introduced 30% quota for women in all police jobs and established as many as 57 all-women police stations. There were other all-women establishments like libraries, stores, banks and co-operative elections.[118] She began to be referred as Thanga Gopuram, Thanga Silai ('Golden Statue') by her followers.[119]\n\nIn July 1993, she observed fast for 80 hours (four days) near the MGR Memorial on the Marina beach, demanding that Karnataka release Kaveri water for the kuruvai crop. She ended her fast only after Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao sent his Cabinet colleague and Union Water Resources Minister V.C. Shukla to Chennai to assure her that the centre would set up two committees to ensure implementation of the 1991-interim award of the Tribunal.[120][121]\n\nReservations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1992, The Supreme Court Verdict which ruled that the overall amount of reservations allowed should not exceed 50% as per Article 16(4) endangered the 69 Percent Reservation in Tamil Nadu.[122]\n\nIn 1993, the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes Bill, 1993 was passed by the Assembly (Act 45 of 1994).[123] The Bill was sent to the President Shankar Dayal Sharma for his approval. J Jayalalithaa's AIADMK government led a cross-party committee of Tamil Nadu politicians to Delhi to meet with the Prime Minister Narasimha Rao led Central government and stepped up pressure on the centre to bring in a Constitutional amendment to include the Tamil Nadu Act in the Ninth Schedule, ensuring that its validity cannot be challenged in any court. By the end of August 1994, the Act became a part of the Ninth Schedule by the presidential accent, confirming \"the 69 percent reservation\" exclusive for Tamil Nadu.[124] The development fetched her the title of \"Samooga Neethi Kaatha Veeranganai\" (The leader who upheld Social justice) by K. Veeramani, General Secretary of Dravidar Kazhagam.[125][126]\n\nOn 20 January 1994, Mother Teresa Called on Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at her poes garden residence in chennai and lauded her welfare projects for girls, destitute women and the aged. Mother Teresa reportedly said that she and Jayalalithaa, India's then only female chief minister, were \"working for and fulfilling the same noble cause\". Mother Teresa said she would pray daily for Jayalalithaa, whose projects included the Cradle Baby Scheme (CBS)[127] Mother Teresa was also present at the State function on the International Women's Day On 9 March 1994 at Madras which Jayalalithaa later recalled as \"memorable event in my life\".[128]\n\nShe first invited Ford Motor Company to establish business in Tamil Nadu in 1995. This was followed by numerous companies setting up factories here especially from automobiles sector which included Hyundai Motor, BMW, Daimler, Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Wright and Yamaha. Due to this, Madras (now Chennai) began to be called as the Detroit of India under her first term.[129] Royal Enfield made significant expansion in Tamil Nadu and apart from Ashok Leyland, TAFE and TVS Motors became key players in Tamil Nadu.[130]\n\nLoss of power, 1996\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK lost power in the 1996 elections, when it won 4 of the 168 seats that they contested.[131] Jayalalithaa was herself defeated by the DMK candidate in Bargur constituency. The outcome has been attributed to an anti-incumbency sentiment and several allegations of corruption and malfeasance against her and her ministers.[116][131] The wedding event of her foster son Sudhakaran, who married a granddaughter of the Tamil film actor Shivaji Ganesan, was held on 7 September 1995 at Madras and was viewed on large screens by over 150,000 people. The event holds two Guinness World Records: one is for the most guests at a wedding and the other is for being the largest wedding banquet.[9][132][133] Subsequently, in November 2011, Jayalalithaa told a special court than the entire ₹60 million (equivalent to ₹360 million or US$4.3 million in 2023) expenses associated with the wedding were paid by the family of the bride.[134]\n\nThough Sudhakaran was adopted by Jayalalithaa as her foster son in 1995, when she became aware that Sudhakaran began to interfere in her financial affairs and that he took money without intending to repay, she disowned him in 1996 within one year of adoption.[135]\n\nThere were several corruption cases filed against her by the ruling DMK government headed by Karunanidhi. Jayalalithaa was arrested on 7 December 1996 and was remanded to 30-day judicial custody in connection with the Colour TV scam, which charged her with receiving kickbacks to the tune of ₹101.3 million (equivalent to ₹600 million or US$7.2 million in 2023). The investigation alleged that the amount through the TV dealers were routed in the form of cheques to a relative of Sasikala, who had quoted Jayalalithaa's residence as hers. She earlier filed an anticipatory bail in the trial court, which was rejected on 7 December 1996.[136] She was acquitted in the case on 30 May 2000 by the trial court and the High Court upheld the order of the lower court.[137][138]\n\nWhen questioned on her views on Sasikala, Jayalalithaa quoted in 1996 \"Sasikala never functioned as extra constitutional power centre. Calling her de facto chief minister is nonsense. She is not interested in politics and I have no intention to bring her into politics.\" It annoyed her when people said Sasikala was behind many of her political decisions and termed such news as rubbish and insult to her position as chief minister.[139]\n\nIn 1998, AIADMK Silver Jubilee Conference was held at Tirunelveli by AIADMK General Jayalalithaa from 1 to 3 January. Several Alliance party leaders such as L. K. Advani, Vaiko, S. Ramadoss, Vazhappady K. Ramamurthy and Subramanian Swamy participated it ahead of Lok Sabha election that year.[140][141][142] Her fortunes revived in the 1998 general election, as the AIADMK became a key component of then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 1998–99 government; her withdrawal of support toppled it and triggered another general election just a year later. During 1999 parliament general election, Jayalalithaa formed the alliance consisting of parties like Congress, CPI, CPI(M), INL and managed to win 13 lok sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and a lone seat in puducherry with the AIADMK winning 10 seats in Tamil Nadu.[143][144]\n\nShe was also convicted in Pleasant Stay hotel case on 3 February 2000 by a trial court to one-year imprisonment.\n\nSecond term as Chief Minister, 2001\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Second Jayalalithaa ministry\n\nJayalalithaa strengthened the AIADMK led Secular Democratic Progressive Alliance consisting Congress, Left parties by bringing in parties like Moopanar's TMC, PMK, IUML and other smaller parties for 2001 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election.[145] Jayalalithaa was barred from standing as a candidate in the 2001 elections because she was found guilty of criminal offences, including allegedly obtaining property belonging to a state-operated agency called TANSI. Although she appealed to the Supreme Court of India, having been sentenced to five years' imprisonment, the matter was not resolved at the time of the elections.[146] But she nominationed for contest in Andipatti, Krishnagiri, Bhuvanagiri and Pudukottai constituencies. All were rejected as she had been disqualified from contesting the polls at that time following conviction in the TANSI land deal case, Pleasant stay hotel case and Since one cannot file nomination for more than two constituencies.[147] The AIADMK Alliance won the landslide victory of 196 seats in the 234-membered assembly. The AIADMK returned to power in 2001 by winning majority and she took oath as Chief Minister as a non-elected member of the state assembly on 14 May 2001.[102]\n\nNoted for its ruthlessness to political opponents, many of whom were arrested in midnight raids, her government grew unpopular. Her appointment was legally voided in September 2001 when the Supreme Court ruled that she could not hold it whilst convicted of criminal acts.[146] O. Panneerselvam, a minister in her party, was subsequently installed as the Chief Minister. However, his government was purported to have been puppeted and micro-managed by Jayalalithaa.[102][148]\n\nJayalalithaa was acquitted in both the TANSI and Pleasant Stay Hotel cases on 4 December 2001 and the Supreme Court upheld the order of the High Court on 24 November 2003.[149][150]\n\nThird term as Chief Minister, 2002\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Third Jayalalithaa ministry\n\nUpon her acquittal, She contested a bye-poll to the Andipatti constituency, after the sitting MLA Thanga Tamil Selvan resigned for the seat, gave up his membership, which she won by a handsome margin in February 2002. Subsequently, On 2 March 2002, Jayalalithaa returned as Chief Minister once more to complete her term, having been acquitted of some charges by the Madras High Court.[151]\n\nIndia's first company of female police commandos was set up in Tamil Nadu in 2003. They underwent the same training as their male counterparts, covering the handling of weapons, detection and disposal of bombs, driving, horseriding, and adventure sports.[152] The government led by her in 2003 banned sale of all lotteries, including online, within the territory of the state, despite the risk of the state losing revenue. She gave orders to a special task force headed by K. Vijaykumar[153] to conduct a secret operation to capture and kill the bandit Veerappan by entering Karnataka.[154] In 2004 she declared eliminating Veerappan as biggest achievement of her government and quoted \"\"My only brief to them was capture Veerappan dead or alive. After that I never interfered. I left them to work out their own strategies and this paid off.\"[155] She began to be referred as 'People's CM' (Makallin Mudhalvar) and Iron Lady of India by end of this term.[156] In this term she launched a rainwater harvesting scheme in 2001 to rejuvenate water sources and this improved ground water levels in the parched southern state and this idea was replicated by various states and even by the centre. She also started the Veeranam project to deliver water to the dry metropolis of Chennai.[157] Doctor Manmohan Singh frequently praised Jayalalithaa for her administrative skills, mid-day meal schemes and efforts for gender empowerment.[158]\n\nHer administrative abilities were notable in her handling of events following the tsunami that hit Tamil Nadu on 26 December 2004. Jayalalithaa announced a Rs 153.37 crore relief package, divided into a general package and a separate one for fishermen. She announced that affected families would get Rs 1 lakh as compensation for every member lost, along with one dhoti, one sari, two bedsheets, 60 kg of rice, three litres of kerosene, and Rs 1,000 in cash for groceries and that furthermore, Rs 1,000 was to be given for purchase of utensils, Rs 2,000 so they could put up accommodation. Per family, and there were about one lakh families in all, the package would cost about Rs 5,000. The fishermen also received an extra Rs 65 crore meant to cover gill nets and boats. It was only a matter of hours before Nagapattinam had its power supply back. With the state working on disaster management for over seven years, response time had been reduced significantly; mobile cranes and ambulances were on patrol. The government entrusted district administration with rehabilitation of affected families, and when they were found to be incompetent, she reshuffled or sacked officers immediately. Jayalalithaa even extended help to the Sri Lankan government by instating officers to guide the island nation in the process of rehabilitation. Her administrative style was uncompromising, whether it was banning the sale of gutkha, or mandatory installation of rainwater harvesting systems, but, she got things done on time without any ifs or buts, as was seen with the tsunami relief, ensuring people remembered not the ruthlessness of her tenure, but the help it gave them.[159][160]\n\nOn 11 May 2006, Jayalalithaa resigned as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu following her party's defeat in the assembly elections.[161][162]\n\nLeader of the Opposition, 2006\n\n[edit]\n\nAIADMK fared poorly in May 2006 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, with her party winning just 61 seats out of total 234 in the state elections in 2006. She won in Andipatti. Though her main opposition, DMK did not win a single party majority (96/234), DMK coalition had 162/234 seats and formed the cabinet until 2011 which she referred to as \"Minority DMK government\".[163][164]\n\nOn 29 May 2006, Jayalalithaa was unanimously elected as Leader of the Opposition by AIADMK MLAs replacing O. Panneerselvam soon after two days, she single-handedly took on the ruling DMK in the house in the wake of the suspension of all 60 AIADMK legislators for the entire session.[165][166] During 2009 parliament general election, The AIADMK-led alliance consisting of parties like PMK, CPI, CPI(M), MDMK managed to win 12 seats with the AIADMK winning 9 seats.\n\nSri Lankan Tamil Issue\n\nIn August 2008, Jayalalithaa moved the Supreme Court to nullify the Katchatheevu agreements of 1974 and 1976. She had raised the retrieval of the islet in her maiden Independence Day address in August 1991. In 1991, Jayalalithaa led Tamil Nadu Assembly adopted a resolution demanding the retrieval of Katchatheevu. During the civil war and with northern borders under the control of the LTTE, the fishermen had easy access to the fishing grounds.[167]\n\nJayalalithaa undertook a day-long fast in March 2009, a couple of months before the Parliamentary elections demanding an immediate ceasefire. She accused then Chief Minister Karunanidhi led DMK government in the State and the UPA government at the Centre of \"criminal neglect in failing to provide relief and succour to the Sri Lankan Tamils\".[168]\n\nIn April 2009, LTTE Chief Prabhakaran thanked Jayalalithaa for voicing her support in favour of Tamil Eelam through a secret letter. It was later revealed by AIADMK MP Maitreyan.[169]\n\nAfter she returned to power in May 2011, the Assembly had adopted several resolutions, seeking an international probe into the alleged war crimes and genocide in the final phase of the Sri Lankan Civil War. She also demanded an economic embargo on Sri Lanka. She expressed her opposition not only to the presence of Sri Lankan military personnel receiving training anywhere in India but also to that of Sri Lankan sportspersons.[168]\n\nAs for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in Tamil Nadu, she had changed her position. Originally, she justified the refugees taking shelter in the State \"as long as the genocide continues\" in the Sri Lanka. But, after the Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, she had branded the refugee camps as \"breeding grounds\" for LTTE militants. However, she turned sympathetic again to the refugees in 2011. She not only enhanced allowance for them but also announced a special scheme for building \"durable houses\" for rehabilitation.[168]\n\nProtest Rallies\n\nIn late 2010, Jayalalithaa as an opposition leader held three big rallies to protest against the price rise and policies of UPA Government at the Centre and DMK Government in the State.

K. Sasikala and 13 others from the AIADMK after she became aware that Sasikala and her family were working against her.[175] Most of the party members welcomed her decision.[176] The matter was resolved by 31 March when Sasikala was reinstated as a party member after issuing a written apology.[177] Sasikala in her written apology mentioned that she had no ambitions either in the party or in the government and wanted to serve Jayalalithaa and added that she became aware of misdeeds done by her family members when Jayalalithaa was in power.

However, after she regained power, between 2011 and 2015, her state government corrected all the discrepancies of previous DMK regime such that the Central Electricity Authority in 2016 said the state is expected to have 11,649 million units of surplus power.[183] Tamil Nadu became among the power surplus states while she was chief minister in this term.[184][185] In this term her government ensured the wrongfully usurped property by land grabbing during 2006 to 2011 in the previous DMK regime, had been retrieved and handed over to rightful owners between 2011 and 2015.[186]\n\nShe announced in 2012, the Vision 2023 document which embodied a strategic plan for infrastructure development which included raising the per capita income of residents to $10,000 per annum, matching Human Development Index to that of developed countries by 2023, providing high-quality infrastructure all over the State, making Tamil Nadu the knowledge capital and innovation hub of India.

She stimulated a cult following, and adoring supporters often termed her \"Adi Parashakti\" (the eternal mighty goddess).[238] Several experts say that over the years the cult called 'Amma' has been carefully crafted. Others claim that the emotional outburst is just a spontaneous display of loyalist support. C Lakshmanan of the Madras Development Institute studies, who has studied personality cult in the politics of Tamil Nadu, said posters were installed around the state portraying Jayalalithaa as a goddess back then.[239] She was worshiped by the party cadre as \"Amma\" (Mother). She made sure the respect and loyalty of the functionaries of the party was there for everyone to see. The entire Cabinet would fall in line and bow in front of the helicopter in which it was flying. Members of the party, at all levels never found it difficult to prostrate before her in full view of the public.[240] Many of her worshipping followers are known to profess their loyalty through acts such as walking on hot coals or drawing her portrait with their blood.[241] S Kirubakaran who is a Journalist-turned-advocate, wrote a book on Jayalalitha titled, 'Ammavin Kathai,' said that when M.G.R. was a Chief Minister, he carefully chose MLAs and Ministers for the first time after going through their knowledge and experience. But Jayalalithaa had begun to assign those who praised her.[242] Even after her death, the AIADMK leaders continued to prostrate themselves before her burial ground.[243][244]\n\n1999 Attempted murder case\n\n[edit]\n\nA case of murder attempt was registered against Jayalalithaa, her close associate Sasikala, and Sasikala's nephew V Mahadevan has been recorded by the Chennai police on following a complaint by former Jayalalithaa's auditor, Rajasekaran, who alleged that he was summoned to the Poes Garden bungalow and violently assaulted by Jayalalithaa, Sasikala and Mahadevan with a stick and high-heeled shoes.[241][245] Rajasekaran also stated that he had been forced by Jayalalithaa and Sasikala to sign two letters and a promissory note in respect of ₹50 lakhs. Jayalalithaa, however, denied the charges in a statement.[246][247]\n\nCorruption cases\n\n[edit]\n\n1996 colour TV case\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Colour TV case\n\nIn the colour TV corruption case involving the purchase of TV sets to villagers, Jayalalithaa was charged and arrested.

Tons of plywood, plaster of paris and paint were used to erect cut-outs of Jayalalitha, arches, several hundred papier-mache statues, elaborate facades of palaces and gateways. The VIP invitations included a silver plate enclosed in a container, a silk saree and a silk dhoti, each worth ₹20,000.[252] The marriage hosted more than 1,000 VIPs. More than 40,000 guests were granted accommodation in the hotel. A legion of elephants and chefs brought in from Kerala.[253] The incident, hailed as \"the mother of all marriages\". People's anger mounted against her as the crores were lavished at the wedding, and Jayalalithaa and Sasikala became symbols of corruption. She was accused of using government money to celebrate the grand marriage.[254] The marriage may have triggered the AIADMK to lose all 39 Lok Sabha seats in the 1996 general election.[255]\n\nShe was later sentenced for 4 years in jail in 2014 for corruption related to the marriage and the Disproportionate assets case.[256]\n\nJayalalithaa owns a Guinness Book of World Records for conducting the luxury wedding.
