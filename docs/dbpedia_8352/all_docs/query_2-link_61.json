        "text": "MUMBAI: Mrunal Thakur responded to her earlier confession that she formerly had strong feelings for Indian cricket player Virat Kohli. The incident started when one of her earlier comments in which she expressed being \"madly in love\" with the cricket superstar resurfaced on the popular Instagram page. After being reshared on Reddit, the post included a photo of Mrunal next to a cutout of Kohli which attracted the interest of followers.\n\n(Also read: https://tellychakkar.com/prod-data/web/movie/movie-news/hot-times-when-gumraah-actress-mrunal-thakur-set-the-internet-fire-230405)\n\nMrunal never stays quiet, and swiftly replies to the post by posting \"STOP IT OK,\" letting everyone know that she wasn't amused by the reappearance of old comments. Fans disagreed with her straightforward but stern response, with some seeing it as sarcastic or playful. As one user noted, “Why her comment is giving the vibe that the information is true but she’s kinda embarrassed lol.” Another added, “Is it me or that comment sounds sarcastic! As in when our friends tease us for our crush we usually say ‘stop it ok.'”\n\nThe primary statement was made while Mrunal was promoting her drama Jersey, which has a cricket theme. She stated, “There was a time when I was madly in love with Virat Kohli. I started liking cricket because of my brother who’s a big fan. I have fond memories of watching a match live at a stadium with him around five years ago. I remember I was wearing a blue jersey and cheering for Team India. Cut to today, I am part of a cricket-based film like Jersey. It is such a happy coincidence.”\n\nMrunal recently appeared in Family Star alongside Vijay Deverakonda, which received a somewhat mixed reception. She also appeared in a cameo among well-known actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan in Kalki 2898 AD. In addition to her intriguing upcoming projects, which include Pooja Meri Jaan and a Sanjay Leela Bhansali production, Mrunal is now filming Son of Sardaar 2.\n\n(Also read: https://tellychakkar.com/prod-data/web/movie/movie-news/surprising-mrunal-thakur-auditioned-priyanka-chopra-starrer-hollywood-film-read)\n\nStay tuned to tellychakkar.com for more updates from the world of entertainment.\n\nCredit- News 18"
