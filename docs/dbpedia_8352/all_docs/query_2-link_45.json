        "text": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has often talked about how his own creation, ChatGPT, can prove to be dangerous if not regulated. On more than one occasions, he has said that he is scared of the AI chatbot and more recently, when he was in India, he said that he doesn't trust all of ChatGPT's answers. The AI tool certainly has its limitations and is not perfect, yet. However, ever since its launch in November 2022, it has come quite far and will continue improving.\n\nLooking at the rapid advancement of AI tools like ChatGPT, a lot of people, as well as tech experts, have expressed concerns over the technology replacing human beings at their jobs in future. And in some cases, this has already started happening. While some people are worried that ChatGPT and other AI tools might replace them at their jobs, others are taking things rather lightly and are saying that it will just help humans in doing their jobs easily and won't be a replacement. However, Sam Altman says that jobs are 'definitely' going to go away because of the technology.\n\nSam Altman says jobs will go away due to AI\n\nIn a recent interview with The Atlantic, Altman said that AI's impact on humanity will not be all positive. He told the publication that even though a lot of people who are working on AI 'pretend' that it is only going to be for the good of humans, act like a supplement for them, and won't replace anyone at their jobs. However, that is not the case.\n\n\"Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop,\" Altman said.\n\nApart from this, he also revealed that OpenAI could have created something even more powerful than ChatGPT but the public would not have been ready for such an advancement.\n\n\"We could have gone off and just built this in our building here for five more years and we would have had something jaw-dropping,\" he said and added that the public would not have been prepared for the 'shock' that followed, and the outcome is quite 'unpleasant' to imagine.\n\nThe Atlantic report further states that as per Altman, people need time to come to terms with the idea that a powerful new intelligence might coexist with humans in future and that ChatGPT was a 'way of serving notice'.\n\nWhen Altman came to India\n\nSam Altman visited India in June this year and had talked about AI taking away human jobs even then.\n\nIn a conversation with Economic Times, Altman had said that 'some jobs' will be going away due to AI but new ones will be created as well. When he was asked if AI will cause job loss, the CEO said, \"Every tech revolution leads to job change. In two generations, we can adapt to any amount of labour market change and there are new jobs and they are usually better. That is going to happen here, too. Some jobs are going to go away. There will be new, better jobs that are difficult to imagine today.\"\n\nIn another interview with Business Today, Altman had said that it is 'amazing to watch India embrace AI' and that OpenAI plans on 'building AI startups in India'. He also talked about regulating artificial intelligence and said that it should be done in a way that important innovation doesn't get hampered."
