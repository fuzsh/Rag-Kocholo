        "text": "She gave her final salutations to her husband Lord Shiva, and the mother of this mortal body, and then she prayed, hoped, that she be reborn to a father, whom she could respect.So saying, Devi Sati immolated her mortal body through the invocation and provocation of her yogic powers.\n\nKnown for her Shakti, Uma Parvati is the hindu goddess of love, devotion, energy and power. Being born to Parbat (lord of mountains) she was named as Parvati, the mother goddess having different attributes and aspects. She is adressed with different names all over the Hindu society as representing her different forms and aspects.She is known as Gauri(fair skined) as well as Kali(dark skined).Wife of Shiva (the destroyer, protector and regenerator), she herself is known for being the epitome of energy and power. She not only is the mother of Kartikeya and Ganesha,but, of all creatures existing and is their protector, looking out for them as a mother for her children. She also is the embodiment of divine knowledge. Parvati is known as one of most gentle and nurturing goddess but, can destroy anything in her way if needed to.\n\nParvati from her early days was fascinated by the tales of Shiv and worshipped him. She wished to have him as her husband and was ready to fight all the obstacles of the way. It is said that Sati herself was Parvati and had taken a rebirth. Parvati meditated for Shiv and passed different tests set by time and fate. After going facing various struggles, Parvati finally was able to win her lord and they both got married. She mothered Kartikeya( the warrior god) and Ganesha(the first worshipped).\n\nIn spite of her seemingly terrible form, Kali Ma is often considered the kindest and most loving of all the Hindu goddesses, as she is regarded by her devotees as the Mother of the whole Universe. And because of her terrible form, she is also often seen as a great protector."
