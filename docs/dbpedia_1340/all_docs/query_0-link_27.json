        "text": "The contract was awarded by Iberdrola Engineering & Construction for 80 MW of power. Nordex, the turbine manufacturing company, has assigned the installation of 15 N90/2500 turbines to our company \"MR&F\". The wind farm is located in the Dobrogea region near the Black Sea. In this windy spot, the average wind speed is above 7/ms, therefore the N90/2500 turbines used are well suited for the implementation of the wind farm. The crane configuration is as follows: LG 1750 SL8HS configuration with a lattice boom length of 112+6 m, 245 tons of counterweights and a radius of 18m.\n\nChirnogeni is an important reference project for our new branch in Romania, in this way we are demonstrating, with Professionalism, Competence and Dedication, that large projects can also be successfully executed in this country by Runco Mario & Figlio Srl."
