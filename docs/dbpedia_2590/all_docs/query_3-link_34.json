I was fascinated by the time and place and began to read more about the era, which ultimately served as a setting for my forthcoming novel, The Expert of Subtle Revisions.\n\nKirsten's book list on love, loss, and logic in 1930s Vienna\n\nWhy did Kirsten love this book?\n\nIn the mood for a graphic novel starring Bertrand Russell and a supporting cast of famous thinkers like Whitehead, Frege, Gödel, and Wittgenstein? Logicomix is for you!\n\nFlip to Chapter Six, “Incompleteness,” for a peek of Vienna in the 1930s. The logic and philosophy illustrated throughout provide a great context for the work of Vienna’s famous philosophical circle led by Moritz Schlick, whose 1936 murder provides a chilling contrast to the intellectual pursuits of that time.\n\nBy Christos Papadimitriou, Apostolos Doxiadis,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Logicomix as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis brilliantly illustrated tale of reason, insanity, love and truth recounts the story of Bertrand Russell's life. Raised by his paternal grandparents, young Russell was never told the whereabouts of his parents. Driven by a desire for knowledge of his own history, he attempted to force the world to yield to his yearnings: for truth, clarity and resolve. As he grew older, and increasingly sophisticated as a philosopher and mathematician, Russell strove to create an objective language with which to describe the world - one free of the biases and slippages of the written word. At the same time, he…\n\nPreview\n\nUnderstanding Comics\n\nBy Scott McCloud,\n\nFrom my list on other subjects that will teach you how to think.\n\nBy Ali Almossawi Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I’d spend much of my time in class daydreaming. Imagining myself in, say, a debate with someone I disagree with and going through a litany of scenarios where I’d try to convince that other person to change their mind. It’s a lot of fun. (My teachers would likely disagree.) When I grew older, I did more of that on my daily walks, and then about 11 years ago, I decided to start writing about creative ways to teach someone something they’re vehemently opposed to or just ambivalent about. I’ve published four books since then on this topic.\n\nAli's book list on other subjects that will teach you how to think\n\nWhy did Ali love this book?\n\nI bought this book when I first got into the field of data visualization. I wasn’t planning on learning how to create comics; I just wanted to see how someone from a different discipline—a comic artist—thought about position, color, meaning, and communicating a whole lot of things in a compact format.\n\nBy Scott McCloud,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Understanding Comics as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe bestselling international classic on storytelling and visual communication \"You must read this book.\" - Neil Gaiman Praised throughout the cartoon industry by such luminaries as Art Spiegelman, Matt Groening, and Will Eisner, Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics is a seminal examination of comics art: its rich history, surprising technical components, and major cultural significance. Explore the secret world between the panels, through the lines, and within the hidden symbols of a powerful but misunderstood art form.\n\nPreview\n\nWhat It Is\n\nBy Lynda Barry,\n\nFrom my list on for game designers.\n\nBy Jesse Schell Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have always loved game design – I love doing it, reading about it, thinking about it, and helping others do it. As you can see in the list, I’ve learned that sometimes what helps game designers most is getting inspiration from other fields. I hope these books help you as much as they helped me.\n\nJesse's book list on for game designers\n\nWhy did Jesse love this book?\n\nAll game designers struggle with what it means to be creative, and whether they are doing it properly.

We are British and reserved, but passionately love science and comics. There are some excellent comics that tell stories about people - Maus, Persepolis, Fun Home. But, there are fewer that try to explain ideas without a strong biographical bent. Here are five comics that are, we think, just a little bit more about ideas than people. They're also fabulous examples of how well comics can communicate sophisticated information, without hype. and in a way that reaches any thinking person, whatever their age or place in life. We are, respectively, two retired neuroscientists, a children's non-fiction author, and an artist. We've all grown up reading, and continue to read, comics from Germany, Britain, France, Belgium, Japan, and even the USA.\n\nUta's book list on explaining things that matter via graphics\n\nWhy did Uta love this book?\n\nOne of those books that tells you about a topic most people never think about - in this case, your trash. Partly semi-autobiographical about the time Backderf spent as a a trash collector but interspersed with general info about America's love of waste and where it all ends up. Backderf's hyper-exaggerated figures render everything fun to read, with a cynical but accurate eye towards human behavior. It's also painstakingly detailed, and the depictions of the gigantic dumps at the edges of towns cannot be unseen. We all know that trash smells terrible - and boy does this book manage to convey how much worse the smell of a whole canyon full of trash can be.\n\nBy Derf Backderf,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Trashed as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nEvery week we pile our rubbish out on the pavement. We go to work and when we return it's gone. Like magic!\n\nThe reality is anything but, of course. Trashed, Derf Backderf's follow-up to the critically acclaimed, award-winning national bestseller My Friend Dahmer, is a working man's epic. An ode to the crap job of all crap jobs-but anyone who has ever been trapped in a soul-sucking gig can relate to this tale. Trashed takes place after Derf graduates high school, when he and his childhood pals find themselves working as garbagemen in their Midwestern hometown. Together they clean the…\n\nPreview\n\nCorpus\n\nBy Rory Clements,\n\nFrom my list on Germany between the world wars.\n\nBy Neil Spark Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThe World At War, the first and arguably best documentary about the Second World War, was on television when I was 14. It fuelled my interest in history, especially about the reasons for the rise of the Nazis. History has many lessons to teach–if we are willing to listen–and one of the great teachers is Germany between the wars. It was a time of extremes: economic crises, social unrest, much of which was caused by the Nazis, and a flourishing bohemian, liberal culture. This febrile environment in which characters struggle with their personal conflict makes for great story-telling potential.\n\nNeil's book list on Germany between the world wars\n\nWhy did Neil love this book?\n\nOne of Rory Clements’ many writing skills is the ability to create tension and explore an angle of an historical event.\n\nIt’s London 1936, and the king is about to abdicate. A woman is murdered in Berlin, and a fascist-leaning couple in Britain are killed. I liked how Clements joins these seemingly separate tragedies into a memorable story. I liked his hero, an academic drawn into the world of spying, Professor Tom Wilde.\n\nI think a great novel's elements are believable characters, forensic attention to detail, and terrific tension, and they are all here.\n\nBy Rory Clements,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Corpus as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA gripping spy thriller for fans of ROBERT HARRIS and WILLIAM BOYD from award-winning Sunday Times bestseller Rory Clements and author of the 2018 CWA HISTORICAL DAGGER WINNER, NUCLEUS\n\n1936.

Spain has erupted in civil war.\n\nIn Berlin, a young Englishwoman evades the Gestapo to deliver vital papers to a Jewish scientist. Within weeks, she is found dead, a silver syringe clutched in her fingers.\n\nIn an exclusive London club, a conspiracy is launched that threatens the very heart of government.…\n\nPreview\n\nBelonging\n\nBy Nora Krug,\n\nFrom my list on WWII impact on German, Jewish families.\n\nBy Dorothy Mandy Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI was born in a log house in Alberta, Canada. I was nineteen months old in August 1939 when my parents decided we should visit my grandmother in Germany and thirteen when we returned. I have been deeply affected by the stories of ordinary families and the trauma they experienced after WWII. To this day, like thousands of others, I feel tremendous inherited discomfort from Nazism and the Holocaust. Our parents' generation did not talk about their wartime experiences, so we must preserve this important part of history and help to relieve the guilt many innocent individuals still harbor while raising awareness of this immensely damaging aspect of war.\n\nDorothy's book list on WWII impact on German, Jewish families\n\nWhy did Dorothy love this book?\n\nI don’t usually read graphic novels, but this book struck a chord with me. Because of its unique style, I expect it will help create an awareness of the impact WWII had on generations of Germans who were born too late to have had any part in it.\n\nThe author's graphic memoir describes her journey back to Germany in search of her family’s politics during the war. Even though she finds that her maternal grandfather, like my father, was exonerated of war crimes, she does not feel she can accept forgiveness for the unforgivable suffering of millions.\n\nBy Nora Krug,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Belonging as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n* Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award * Silver Medal Society of Illustrators *\n\n* Named a Best Book of the Year by The New York Times, The Boston Globe, San Francisco Chronicle, NPR, Comics Beat, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Kirkus Reviews, andLibrary Journal\n\nThis“ingenious reckoning with the past” (The New York Times), by award-winning artist Nora Krug investigates the hidden truths of her family’s wartime history in Nazi Germany.\n\nNora Krug was born decades after the fall of the Nazi regime, but the Second World War cast a long shadow over her childhood and youth in the city…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Secret Healer\n\nBy Ellin Carsta, Terry Laster (translator),\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nTerry Laster, who translated this work from the German original, does a masterful job of expressing the situation in 14th-century Heidelberg when a female secretly heals patients and for her success, is accused of performing works of the devil. In their ignorance, the town council appoints her husband, a lawyer, to discover her identity. How this story resolves is a testament to the power of good works and encourages me when I face opposition from ignorant people.\n\nBy Ellin Carsta, Terry Laster (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Secret Healer as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn the fourteenth century, opportunities for women are limited to the home.

Yet even though it…\n\nPreview\n\nSophie Scholl\n\nBy Frank McDonough,\n\nWhy did Greg love this book?\n\nThe story of Sophie Scholl and the student resistance group, the White Rose, never fails to being me to tears.\n\nSophie, her brother Hans, and friends in Munich printed and distributed thousands of anti-Nazi leaflets, which describe a post-war need for international cooperation. She believed that it was wrong for anyone to side with their own nation if they knew that nation was doing wrong.\n\nShe and her friends paid the price for their resistance but remained defiant to the end. Sophie wrote one word on the back of the indictment against her: ‘Freedom’.\n\nNever has her story been more inspiringly told than by McDonough.\n\nBy Frank McDonough,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Sophie Scholl as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOn 22 February 1943, Sophie Scholl, a 21-year-old student at Munich University, was executed by the Nazi regime, along with two fellow students from the White Rose resistance movement. They had fought against Hitler's tyranny, not with bullets and bombs, but with words, printed in leaflets, that proclaimed a passionate desire to live in a free and democratic society. Her brave and principled stand made her a legend in Germany, and she was voted 'Woman of the Century' by a popular women's magazine in 1999. Frank McDonough has used a variety of original documents from German archives, including letters and…\n\nPreview\n\nA Stranger to Myself\n\nBy Willy Peter Reese, Stefan Schmitz (editor), Michael Hofmann (translator)\n\nWhy did Edward love this book?\n\nBefore being drafted into the German Army in 1941, Willy Peter Reese was a bank clerk who spent his time engaged in reading German literature and attempting to become a writer in his own right.\n\nThe memoir is a compilation of his journal entries as he reflected on his transition from civilian to soldier. Originally published in German, Reese’s journal demonstrates the way in which a relatively naïve and carefree intellectual became involved in the Nazi war of annihilation in the Soviet Union.\n\nThe transformation from a bookish, sensitive, and brooding teenager into a soldier who lost empathy for the people suffering under German occupation demonstrates how some German youth became actors and accomplices in the Nazi regime’s crimes.\n\nBy Willy Peter Reese, Stefan Schmitz (editor), Michael Hofmann (translator)\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Stranger to Myself as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"A Stranger to Myself: The Inhumanity of War: Russia, 1941-44\" is the haunting memoir of a young German soldier on the Russian front during World War II.

Bearing witness to-and participating in-the atrocities of war, Reese recorded his reflections in his diary, leaving behind an intelligent, touching, and illuminating perspective on life on the eastern front. He documented the carnage perpetrated by both sides; the destruction that was exacerbated by the young soldiers'…\n\nPreview"
