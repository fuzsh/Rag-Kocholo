Bento, Noah Miller, Mehreen Mookerjee & Edson Severnini\n\nIncidental Adaptation: The Role of Non-climate Regulations\n\nEnviron Resource Econ 86, 305–343 (2023)\n\nAccess the OPEN ACCESS article here!\n\nWhen a non-climate institution, policy, or regulation corrects a pre-existing market failure that would be exacerbated by climate change, it may also incidentally induce climate adaptation. This regulation-induced adaptation can have large positive welfare effects. We develop a tractable analytical framework of a corrective regulation where the market failure interacts with climate, highlighting the mechanism of regulation-induced adaptation: reductions in the climate-exacerbated effects of pre-existing market failures. We demonstrate this empirically for the US from 1980 to 2013, showing that ambient ozone concentrations increase with rising temperatures, but that such increase is attenuated in counties that are out of attainment with the Clean Air Act’s ozone standards. Adaptation in nonattainment counties reduced the impact of a 1 °C increase in climate normal temperature on ozone concentration by 0.64 parts per billion, or about one-third of the total impact. Over half of that effect was induced by the standard, implying a regulation-induced welfare benefit of $412–471 million per year by mid-century under current warming projections.\n\nMotivation for the award\n\nThis impressive study offers a novel perspective on climate change adaptation by introducing incidental adaptation, where non-climate specific regulations induce climate adaptation. The authors present a well-articulated theoretical framework that demonstrates the mechanism of incidental adaptation, which underpins their empirical analysis. Using their theoretical framework, they show how regulatory actions aimed at addressing other non-climate market failures can also, incidentally, drive adaptation to climate change and improve welfare. This occurs in situations when climate change exacerbates regulated non-climate market failures.\n\nThe authors also present a rigorous empirical analysis where they quantify the unintended yet beneficial role of the ozone standard of the US Clean Air Act in driving adaptation to climate change. Their main finding is that the ozone regulation has significantly contributed to reducing the impact of climate-induced increases in temperature on ozone pollution. By comparing ozone levels in counties that meet the ozone standard (attainment counties) with those that do not (nonattainment counties), the study demonstrates that nonattainment counties have seen greater reductions in ozone pollution in response to temperature increases, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to climate change.\n\nThe implications of incidental adaptation go beyond ozone regulation. The paper hints at other applications, such as forest wildfire mitigation and water conservation in agriculture, where similar non-climate regulations could inadvertently induce climate adaptation. This research opens new avenues for research and policy considerations.\n\nThe 2024 Award Selection committee recognises also the excellence of these open access papers:\n\nGodwin Kwabla Ekpe & Anna A.

In this thorough and path-breaking study, the authors combine multi-region input–output and computable general equilibrium models to simulate the impact of carbon-tariffs given the patterns of trade-flows from 2000-2014.

The paper demonstrates the value of combining economic theory with empirical models to cast light on complex issues. The article also provides a model to other researchers of how to consider the considerable equity issues created by tariffs that will pass the burden of carbon abatement from richer industrialised nations to the developing world.\n\nThe 2022 Award Selection committee recognises also the excellence of these open access papers:\n\nBaranzini, A., Carattini, S. & Tesauro, L.\n\nDesigning Effective and Acceptable Road Pricing Schemes: Evidence from the Geneva Congestion Charge\n\nEnvironmental and Resource Economics 79, 417–482 (2021)\n\nDa Rocha, J.M., García-Cutrín, J., Gutiérrez, MJ., Prellezo R., Sanchez E.\n\nDynamic Integrated Model for Assessing Fisheries: Discard Bans as an Implicit Value-Added Tax\n\nEnvironmental and Resource Economics 80, 1–20 (2021)\n\nGersbach, H., Hummel, N., Winkler, R.\n\nLong-Term Climate Treaties with a Refunding Club\n\nEnvironmental and Resource Economics 80, 511–552 (2021)\n\nEAERE is grateful to the Award Nominating Committee composed by Simone Borghesi (Chair), Joëlle Noailly, and Alistair Munro for the service rendered to EAERE, and to Springer for supporting this Award.\n\nPeter Lau, Angela Sze, Wilson Wan, Alfred Wong\n\nThe Economics of the Greenium: How Much is the World Willing to Pay to Save the Earth?\n\nEnvironmental and Resource Economics, 81, 379–408 (2022)\n\nAccess the FREE ACCESS article here!\n\nSadly, not much. This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the greenium, the price premium the investor pays for green bonds over conventional bonds. We explain in simple economic terms why the price premium of a green bond essentially represents a combination of the non-pecuniary environmental benefit of the bond, as perceived by the investor, and the effective cost of issuing it, as measured by the additional issuing costs of the bond netted off a range of monetary and non-monetary benefits associated with the issuance. Our empirical model decomposes the greenium into a time-varying market component which is common to all green bonds and an idiosyncratic component which is specific to a certain green bond itself. Using the largest global green bond dataset compared to any previous studies, we find that the greenium on average amounts to, sadly, just over one basis point. However, it varies quite significantly among individual green bonds and our result suggests that a key factor underlying the variation is that they are subject to the risk of greenwashing to different extents.\n\nMotivation for the award\n\nThe paper is not only well executed and very well written, but also very topical and policy relevant. It provides a nice introduction to an important aspect of green finance to the ERE audience, while contributing at the same time to advance the literature in three different ways: (i) developing a theoretical framework to explain the economics of the greenium; (ii) constructing a very rich and comprehensive green bond database to analyze the greenium; (ii) adopting a new approach to estimating it.\n\nThe 2023 Award Selection committee recognises also the excellence of these open access papers:\n\nAbrell, J., Rausch, S., Streitberger, C.\n\nThe Economic and Climate Value of Flexibility in Green Energy Markets\n\nEnvironmental and Resource Economics 79, 417–482 (2021)\n\nStetter, C., Sauer, J.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions and Eco-Performance at Farm Level: A Parametric Approach\n\nEnvironmental and Resource Economics 81, 617–647 (2022)\n\nPretis, F.\n\nDoes a carbon tax reduce CO2 emissions?

The motivation provided by the committee is the following:\n\nBorsky, S., Hennighausen, H., Leiter, A and Williges, K.. CITES and the Zoonotic Disease Content in International Wildlife Trade. Environ Resource Econ 76, 1001–1017 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00456-7\n\nZoonotic diseases are infections caused by a pathogens that have jumped from an animal to humans. Across the globe, every year there are over one billion contacts between wildlife and humans or domestic animals from trade. For the majority of the trades, there is no mandatory testing for pathogens, raising the risks of epidemics from zoonotic diseases. And so, in a year in which the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic has tragically reminded us of the fragility of human society, this original paper provides a timely analysis of the links between international trade and the ongoing threats from zoonotic diseases. The authors, Stefan Borsky, Hannah Hennighausen, Andrea Leiter and Keith Williges carefully assemble data to show that in recent decades, the volume and pattern of internationally traded wildlife has changed considerably and, with it, the zoonotic pathogens that are traded. Combining zoonotic disease data with wildlife trade data from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife and Fauna (CITES), they demonstrate that making trade requirements more stringent decreases the number of animals traded and, as a consequence the number of zoonotic diseases that are traded also falls. The CITES agreement is aimed at lowering threats to extinction by placing restrictions on the trade of endangered species. They show that when an animal is moved to a more restrictive category an (accidental) by-product is the lower of zoonotic disease risk. Thus, through econometric analysis, the authors provide compelling evidence that an international environmental trade agreement could be used to limit the spread of zoonotic pathogens and disease.\n\nThe committee was extremely impressed how this paper puts the Covid-19 pandemic in its economic context. Such an outstanding article reminds us that, along with its many benefits, international trade can bring it with damaging, but potentially avoidable, externalities. It points to how international trade treaties could be upgraded in order to limit the risks of future zoonotic diseases.\n\nAndersen, D.C. Default Risk, Productivity, and the Environment: Theory and Evidence from U.S. Manufacturing. Environ Resource Econ 75, 677–710 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00404-5\n\nThis paper impressed the committee with its rigorous combination of different methods of economic analysis to shed light on the hitherto under-explored link between the market risks faced by businesses and their willingness to adopt pollution-reducing technologies. Dana Anderson first divides the effect of default risk into three distinct effects: the market-size, technology-upgrading, and selection effect. Conceptually, an increase in default risk raises equilibrium borrowing costs, thereby precluding investment in a technology upgrade among a subset of firms (technology-upgrading effect). As a consequence, the economy consists of more numerous (market-size effect) but less productive and more pollution-intensive firms (selection effect). All this is done in a theoretical general equilibrium model. To examine the quantitative link between default risk and aggregate pollution emissions, the author then builds an econometric model using a unique dataset that combines credit scores with measures of pollution emissions for firms in the United States. Having obtained these estimates, Dana Anderson then uses the theoretical model to consider the impact of economy-wide default risk on aggregate pollution emissions, demonstrating that default risk increases aggregate emissions and emissions intensity, primarily as a consequence of the technology-upgrading effect. In other words, an economy exposed to more macroeconomic risk is also an economy that is more polluting. Finally, the paper demonstrates that actual historical changes in economy-wide default risk generate economically significant changes in pollution emissions.\n\nThis paper is an excellent example of how only a combination of theory and statistical analysis can provide a powerful insight into the link between macroeconomic risks and polluting behaviour. As such it is a model for all researchers interested in careful and rigorous environmental economics.”\n\nThe 2021 Award Selection committee recognises also the excellence of these papers:\n\nBeck, U., Kruse-Andersen, P.K.

Tyner produce both a truly excellent example of multidisciplinary collaboration and internationally significant contribution to our understanding of the interplay between climate change, mitigation policies, and their impacts on the global economy. Their paper addresses a context in which climate change threatens to negatively affect crop productivity in many regions across the world. Add to this inelastic demand for most agricultural products then a climate or otherwise driven shock in food supply can result in food price increases, limiting the ability of some regions to provide adequate food supplies for population needs. Such circumstances undermine calls for reductions of deforestation and reforestation despite these being recognized as efficient and effective approaches for mitigating climate change.\n\nGiven such a context Peña‑Lévano, Taheripour and Tyner address a series of fundamental questions: (1) What is the cost of emissions reduction with no forest carbon sequestration (FCS) incentive? (2) What is the mitigation cost incorporating FCS? (3) What are the impacts of FCS on food security? (4) What are the consequences for the global economy and food production when crop productivity is affected by climate change? (5) What is the economic value of reducing crop yield losses? The authors modify a well-known computable general equilibrium (CGE) model (GTAP-BIO-FCS) to evaluate the economic and land use impacts of emissions reduction targets and policies under alternative climate scenarios. They find that implementing an aggressive FCS incentive can cause substantial increases in food prices due to land competition between forest and crop production. In fact, when climate-induced yield shocks are integrated in the analysis, food price increases are so large that it becomes clear that such an approach could not be adopted in the real world. Moreover, the results cry out for investment in agricultural research on climate adaptation, as the authors find that economic well-being falls more without mitigation, than with 50% emission reductions.\n\nThis paper is an excellent example of how economics can deliver the much-needed Sustainability Transition, by providing useful guidance for policy-making which derives from careful multidisciplinary modeling and economic analysis.
