        "text": "Bohemian and Czech Jews in American History[1]\n\nMiloslav Rechcgl, Jr.\n\nJews have lived on the territory of the historic Czech Lands for some 1,000 years. They have played an important role in the social, economic and cultural development of the country since the times of the Duchy and the subsequent Kingdom of Bohemia, through the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia, and the Successor State, the Czech Republic.[2]\n\nThe Bohemian or Czech Jews who immigrated to America represent a terra incognita. Relatively little is known and relatively little has been written, with the exception of Guido KischÕs now classical monograph, In Search of Freedom,[3] written in 1949, which dealt primarily with the emigrants from the Czech Lands around the year 1848; and my own study, which focused on the earliest arriving Bohemian Jewish pioneers in America. [4]\n\nThe purpose of this study is to take a comprehensive look at the immigration and settlement of the Bohemian and the Czech Jews in America at the onset of the 19th century and beyond and to evaluate their contributions. The first part deals with the arrival and the settlement of the immigrants in different States of the Union. The second part deals with the contributions of the selected Bohemian and the Czech Jews in different areas of endeavor, including American Judaism, public service, military service, business, culture, biological and medical sciences, physical sciences and engineering, and humanities and social sciences.[5]\n\nIdentification of Bohemian Jews\n\nOne of the difficulties has been to identify who is Jewish, since most of them came to America when the Czech Lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. German being the official language of the land, it is altogether not surprising, that being enterprising, they easily mixed with the German element, and as such, were a priori considered Germans or Austrians, or even Hungarians. This was true even though they had a separate identity and established their own culture. They were not Germans, they were Bohemian Jews. After the Czechoslovak Republic was established, many of these Jews identified themselves as Czechs Jews, having learned the Czech language and becoming a part of the Czech cultural milieu.\n\nDespite the initial difficulties of identifying them as a group, after some experience, the present author soon developed the skill of ÔguessingÕ whether a given surname might be of Bohemian Jewish origin. Here are some examples of the typical Bohemian Jewish names: Abeles, Adler, Altschul, Arnstein, Bleier, Bloch, Block, Bondi, Bondy, Busch, Eckstein, Eidlitz, Eisler, Eisner, Eitner, Epstein, Ernst, Fantl, Feigl, Fischel, Fischer, Fleischer, Fleischner, Frankel, Freud, Freund, Fried, Fuchs, Furst, Frth, Glaser, Grnberger, Grund, Grnfeld, Grnhut, Gnzburg, Haas, Hahn, Hammerschlag, Heller, Hirsch, Hofmann, Jeiteles, Kahler, Karpeles, Katz, Kauders, Kisch, Klauber, Klein, Kohn, Korbel, Kraus, Krauskopf, Kuh, Langer, Lederer, Lbl, Loewy, Lw-Beer, Lustig, Mahler, Mandl, Meisl, Meissner, Munk, Neumann, Pam, Pascheles, Petscheck, Pick, Popper, Porges, Reich, Rosenwasser, Rosewater, Schlesinger, Schmelkes, Schulhoff, Spira, Stein, Steindler, Steiner, Stern, Strauss, Tauber, Teweles, Vogel, Wehle, Weidenthal, Weiner, Weil, Weinberger, Weinmann, Weiss, Weisskopf, Weltsch, Winternitz, Wolf, Zeisel, Zucker, Zweig.\n\nThe identification was, of course, easier, when their names were based on German translations of the Czech towns, such as Austerlitz (Slavkov), Brandeis (Brandýs nad Labem), Brod, Bunzlau (Boleslav), Haurowitz (Hořovice), Janowitz (Janovice), Jenikau (Jenkov), Nachod (Nchod), Neustadtl (Nov Město), Nicolsburg (Mikulov), Politzer (Politz – Police), Postelberg (Postoloprty), Prag (Praha), Pribram (Přbram), Raudnitz ( Roudnice), Strakonitz (Strakonice), Taussig (Tauss – Domažlice), Teplitz (Teplice), Turnau (Turnov).\n\nSome of these Jews had typical Czech names, such as: Dubský, Forman, Holý, Hošek, Hubatý, Jahoda, Jellinek, Kafka, Kulka, Kussy, Mnes, Morawetz, Placzek, Psecký, Pokorný, Polček, Pollak, Roubček, Růžička, Slezk, Sobotka, Strnský, Tuschka, Vodička, Voskovec, Zelenka.[6]\n\nBohemian Jewish Settlers in Individual States\n\nThis section ignores the Bohemian Jewish pioneers in America from the 16th to 18th centuries, which were the subject of my earlier study. The emphasis here is the immigrants who came to America in the first half of the 19th century and their descendants.\n\nVirginia\n\nAround the turn of the 19th century several members of the Block (originally Bloch) Jewish family from Švihov, a village in Bohemia, settled in Virginia. [7] Among them were Jacob Block (ca 1765-1835) and his son Abraham Block (1780-1857). Jacob lived originally in Baltimore, MD but later moved to Williamsburg and soon after to Richmond in Virginia. Abraham arrived in America in 1791 at the age of 12 years and grew up in Virginia. He established himself as a merchant and in 1811 was married to Frances Isaacs with whom he had seven children. The following year he served as captain during the War of 1812. After the war he returned to his business. In 1823 he decided to move to Arkansas where he thought he would find better conditions for business.\n\nOther members of the large Block family lived in Richmond at that time. The patriarch of the family, Simon Block (bef. 1742-1823), the father of Jacob and grandfather of Abraham, resided in Richmond in 1804. Some six years later he moved to Williamsburg and finally he ended up in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nAbrahamÕs brother Simon Block, Jr. (bef. 1790-1826) lived in Richmond since 1794 or earlier, and later moved to Missouri. AbrahamÕs second brother Eleazer Block (1797-1886), a native of Švihov, was one of the lucky Americans who had the privilege of acquiring university education at that time. He attended the College of William and Mary and around 1826 settled by the Mississippi River and opened a law practice. AbrahamÕs sister Louise, who was born in Virginia, married Abraham Jonas, a close friend of President Lincoln. Their son Benjamin Franklin Jonas (1834-1911) became Senator for the State of Louisiana. [8]\n\nMaryland\n\nThe next State to register the entry of a Bohemian Jew at the beginning of the 19th century was probably Maryland. His name was Levi Collmus (1782-1856) who settled in Baltimore.[9] Although some sources state that he arrived in 1798, as a lad of 15, or in 1800, a declaration of naturalization he made in 1822 states that he arrived at the port of Baltimore in September 1806. He gave Prague as his birthplace and his age as 40 years. He was a dry goods dealer.\n\nLevi Collmus participated in the War of 1812. According to his application to the U.S House of Representatives for a pension, he \"was engaged in the battle near Baltimore which took place on the 12th day of September, 1814.Ó Although he married a Christian, Collmus was one of the electors of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation in 1831. He became treasurer of the United Hebrew Benevolent Society when it was formed in 1834. Though buried in a Christian cemetery (Greenmount Cemetery), he was given a burial according to the full Orthodox Jewish ritual.[10]\n\nIn the 1840s, several Bohemian Jewish families settled in Baltimore. Among them was Charles Winternitz (1815-1891), a native of Deštn, Bohemia, who came with his wife and five children, in 1845. After six months in Baltimore, he began an iron business. Within two years he owned two stores in the city, and was very successful. His firm, Charles Winternitz & Sons, did the heaviest iron business in the city of Baltimore. He had eight children, of which three--David, Lewis and Hiram--were associated with him in business. Two of them, Samuel G. and William, carried on individually their own iron businesses.[11]\n\nIn 1845, Adolf Guinzburg (ca1820-1908) settled in Annapolis, the capital of Maryland.[12] He was a merchant. He lived there until 1873 when he removed to Clearfield, PA, where he opened a menÕs clothing shop. His brother, Rabbi Dr. A. Guinzburg (1812-1873) immigrated with his family to Baltimore in 1849. Apart from his theological responsibilities he also taught at Newton University. He later moved to Rochester, NY.[13]\n\nIn 1849, Leopold Franz Morawetz (1818-1892) immigrated to Baltimore from Roudnice, Bohemia. [14] He was a physician specializing in surgery and obstetrics, having received his medical training at Prague and Vienna Universities. He opened a practice in Baltimore and was among BaltimoreÕs first physicians. One of his sons, Victor Morawetz,[15] became a prominent lawyer; the other son, Albert became a diplomat.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nAt the turn of the 18th and 19th century, Isaac Phillips (1794-1851) came to Pennsylvania from England, where his ancestor Phineas Phillips originally emigrated from Bohemia. He was a member of the foreign commission and exchange firm of R. I. Phillips, who became a prominent figure in the Philadelphia business world. His firm was the first American representative of the House of Rothschild. IsaacÕs son Barnet Phillips (1826-1885), a founder of the American Jewish Historical Society, achieved distinction as a scholar, soldier and journalist. In 1872 he joined the staff of the New York Times; at the time of his death he was in charge of book reviews.[16]\n\nDavid Winternitz (*1818) immigrated to America from Bohemia and settled in New Castle, PA in 1825. His son Isaac Adler Winternitz became a physician as did his grandson David Henry Winternitz (*1891). The latter was born Hoxie, KA, where his father moved. [17]\n\nFrancis J. Grund (1798-1863), a native of Liberec, Bohemia, was long a resident of Philadelphia, and a frequent contributor Ôto the public prints.Õ He made his first impression as a Washington correspondent of the Public Ledger. Grund played an active role in the cityÕs politics. He edited a Whig newspaper, the Daily Standard, during the campaign of 1840; and he afterwards became a staunch supporter of the Tyler administration. On October 26, 1842, The Spirit of the Times reported that Grund had been appointed Ôweigh masterÕ in the Philadelphia Custom House. Lambert A. Wilmer [18] recalled that Grund, while holding Òa fat office in the Custom-House,Ó controlled the Ôpolitical departmentÕ of the Evening Mercury, the organ of the Tyler administration in Philadelphia. He established a Philadelphia journal The Age, which he edited from 1843-63, and was the author of The Americans in their Moral, Social, and Political Relations (1837), Aristocracy in America (1839), Algebraic Problems, Elements of Chemistry and of Natural Philosophy and Plane and Solid Geometry.\n\nHis insightfulness is evident from the discussion in his book, Aristocracy in America, of PhiladelphiaÕs culture: ÒThe society of Philadelphia is, on the whole, better than that of Boston or New York. There is less vulgar aristocracy than in other Northern cities. Not that I mean to say that there are not people to be found in Boston and New York that could rival the Philadelphians in point of 'gentility but in the good 'city of brotherly love' there is, probably owing to a seasonable admixture of a large number of European, and especially French families, a higher tone, greater elegance, and, in every respect, more agrmens. The New-Englanders are an arguing people, and annoy you, even in society, with mathematical and political demonstrations. The Philadelphians have more taste, and have the best cooks in the United States.Ó[19]\n\nS. E. Rosenbaum (*1822), a Czech Jew from Golčův Jenkov, Bohemia, settled in Allentown, PA at age 25 in 1847. According to Guido Kisch, he had talents for art and journalism. He kept a careful diary, a veritable Ôhuman documentÕ of manÕs enterprise, striving, and endurance. His American career as a peddler and window-shade painter was beneath his talents and education. In his later years, his frequent spells of disappointment and despondency find tragic expression in the final pages of his diary – which he added some fifty years afterwards, at the age of seventy-five.[20]\n\nAdolph Brandeis (1822-1906) from Prague briefly visited Pennsylvania in 1848 after he emigrated from Bohemia to New York. He was the father of the famed Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis.\n\nDuring 1853-1854, Rabbi Bernard Illowy (1814-1871), of Koln, Bohemia, served as rabbi in Philadelphia. He then moved to St. Louis.\n\nLouisiana\n\nThe earliest known Bohemian Jew to settle in Louisiana was Samuel Kohn (1783-1853), who was born in a tiny Bohemian village of Hořany. It is surmised that he arrived around 1806 or earlier. Through wit, grit and acuity, he rose from a penniless immigrant to become one of the wealthiest financiers in New Orleans. In due course, Kohn became a banker, moneylender, investor, and a real estate promoter. He also built dwellings and commercial buildings throughout the city and was one of the major promoters of suburban construction. [21]\n\nSamuel Kohn had several brothers, including Simon and Joachim. In 1819 or 1820, when Joachim [22] was 19 or 20 years old, Samuel brought him to New Orleans and set him up in the commission brokerage line. He and his with several partners owned ships and handled cargoes on the Mississippi River, in the Caribbean, on the Atlantic seaboard and in Europe. After Samuel Kohn moved to Paris in 1832, Joachim acted as his agent in America. Joachim was successful in his own right. He was a member of more corporate boards than any other Jew in his time.\n\nA third member of the Kohn family, Samuel's nephew Carl Kohn,[23] was brought to New Orleans by Samuel in 1830 or 1831. He achieved a level of success and prominence equal to that of his uncles. Like them he became engaged in merchant banking, commission brokerage and various other business enterprises, culminating in his election to the presidency of the Union National Bank.\n\nApart from Kohns, several members of the Block family lived in New Orleans, including Abraham Block (1780-1857), Jacob Block (1808-1888) and Louisa Block (*1800), the mother of the future senator Benjamin F. Jonas (1834-1911).\n\nSome Bohemian Jews resided here only temporarily, such as Dr. Simon Pollak (1814-1903) from Domažlice or Philip Wohl (1823-1895) from Karlovy Vary, both of whom later moved to St. Louis. MO.\n\nMissouri\n\nMissouri was the next state in which Bohemian Jews appeared in the early part of the 19th century. According to Isidor Bush, it was Wolf Block (ca 1765-bf 1840) from Švihov, who previously lived in Baltimore, MD and Richmond, who moved to St. Louis in 1816. Other family relatives followed suit so that the Blocks were the most numerous Jewish family in the city. Wolf BlockÕs cousin, Eleazer Block (1797-1886),[24] was apparently the second Block who came to St. Louis, after completing his studies at the College of William and Mary. He became the first ÒHebrew lawyer\" in that city.\n\nA couple of decades later, the St. LouisÕ Blocks were joined by Abraham Weigl (1802-1888) and Nathan Abeles (1814-1885) from Bohemia, who married into the Block family.\n\nAround 1840, Charles A Taussig (*1822), son of Seligman Taussig from Prague, came to St. Louis, followed, a year later, by his brother John Seligman Taussig (1832-1911)[25] with their cousin William (1826-1916). Charles Taussig, jointly with Adolph Abeles, brother of Nathan Abeles, opened a very popular general store at Park and Carondelet Streets, which became widely known as far as Jefferson Co. [26]\n\nIn 1840, Adolph Klauber (1816-) arrived from Bohemia and established an iron and metal business in St. Louis. He became one of the founders of congregation BÕnai El. His son David, born in 1858, joined him in business and both became important members of the Jewish community. [27]\n\nIn 1845, a young physician Simon Pollak (1814-1903), of Domažlice, joined the growing St. Louis Bohemian Jewish community. He obtained his doctorate in 1835 and immigrated to America in 1838. After a short stay in New York, he went to New Orleans and then to Tennessee, before permanently settling in St. Louis. He established a highly successful ophthalmology and ear clinic and an institution for blind. During the Civil War he served as a general inspector of hospitals. [28]\n\nIsidor Bush (1822-1898) came to St. Louis in 1849, after a short stay in New York, where he first immigrated after the unsuccessful revolution in 1848 and when he had to flee from Austria. He was married to Theresa Taussig, sister of Charles A Taussig. He opened a general store in Carondelet with his brother-in-law Charles A. Taussig, who was already in business with Adolph Abeles. By 1853, Bush and Taussig bought out Abeles and continued profitably in the south St. Louis location. In 1851, Bush purchased one hundred acres of land in Jefferson Co., south of St. Louis, at a place called Bushberg, where he successfully grew grapes. Before long he gained a reputation as a leading authority in viniculture. [29]\n\nArkansas\n\nThe earlier mentioned Capt. Abraham Block (1780-1857), from Virginia, resided in the state of Arkansas by 1823. His family soon followed. They were considered to have been one of the original pioneer settlers and the first Jews to settle in Arkansas.[30] Abraham had established a store in the village of Washington, AK that had prospered and had drawn trade from a wide area in Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana, so that he soon became one of the wealthiest men in the county. In 1830s and 1840s, the Block firm began to open branches in other towns in the southwest Arkansas. According to his obituary, he was esteemed by all who knew him, and the businessmen of New Orleans and the planters of Red River and southern Arkansas all knew him.[31]\n\nMassachusetts\n\nThe year of 1827 marks the arrival in Boston of Francis Joseph Grund (1805-1863) from Prague. In contrast to the humble background of most of the early immigrants from Bohemia, Francis J. Grund was already educated when he came to America, with a degree from the Vienna Polytechnic. He was a mathematician of note who wrote textbooks on arithmetic, algebra and geometry, in addition to texts on chemistry, astronomy and natural philosophy. In 1827, after a year of teaching mathematics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, he settled in the United States. He continued teaching mathematics in Boston until 1833, subsequently engaging in journalistic work. In 1837 he settled in Philadelphia, where he served as an editor of the Whig newspaper Standard and Grund's Pennsylvanischer Deutscher. Some credit him with inventing journalistic sensationalism , full of hints of best sources and information from behind the scenes. [32]\n\nKentucky\n\nThe first Bohemian Jew in Kentucky was probably Louisa Block (*ca1800), who was married there in 1829 to Abraham Jonas. Her father Jacob was native of Švihov, Bohemia, who immigrated to the US at the end of the 18th century.[33] Louisa and her husband lived first in Williamstown in Grant Co., KY. Four of their sons were born in Kentucky, all of whom served in the Confederate Army. One of the sons, Benjamin Franklin Jonas (1834-1911) was a lawyer who became senator for Louisiana.[34] In 1836 the family removed to Quincy, IL where they became close friends of President Lincoln.[35]\n\nIn 1853, Lewis Naphtali Dembitz (1833–1907), whose mother came from Prague, opened a law practice in Louisville. He soon entered politics and held important offices in the Republican Party. He was a member of the National Republican Convention which nominated Abraham Lincoln for President. [36]\n\nAround 1853, another Bohemian Jew, Edward Klauber (1835-1918),[37] settled in Louisville, where he opened a popular photographic studio. One of his sons, Adolf Klauber (1879-1933) was a drama critic for New York Times and later became a theatre producer.[38]\n\nThe most interesting Bohemian Jewish family in Kentucky was that of Moritz Flexner (1820-1882) from Všeruby, who settled in Louisville in 1854.[39] Although he was just a peddler and later a shopkeeper, he managed to provide all his children university education. Without exception, they became prominent in their professions.\n\nNew York\n\nA large number of Bohemian Jews came to New York in the early part of the 19th century. However, most of them stayed for only a short period and then moved on to other states, particularly to the south. This is why New York City may be called ÒGateway to America.Ó [40] This group included Dr. Simon Pollak, who came here in 1838, Leopold Weisskopf in 1839, Louis Fleischner in 1839, Solomon Adler in 1843, Charles S. Kuh in 1844, Rabbi Issac M. Wise in 1846 and Samuel Klauber in 1847.\n\nAmong the early arrivals, only a few people made New York City or New York State their permanent home. Among them are Leopold Eidlitz, who came here in 1843, Marc Eidlitz and David Abeles (1822-1897) in 1847, Max Maretzek, Lewis Hahn (1828-), Philip Brockman, Julius Bunzl and Henry Dormitzer in 1848. Leopold Eidlitz (1823-1908) was one of the most prominent architects in the US, while his brother Marc (1826-1892) became one of the most famous building contractors and entrepreneurs in New York City.\n\nMax Maretzek (1821-1897) managed several opera companies at the Academy of Music, NY and was one of the pioneers in popularizing grand opera in the US.\n\nIt is noteworthy that already in 1848 the New York Czech Jews had their own congregation ÔAhabath Hesed.Õ Their synagogue stood on 133 Ridge Street and their burial ground in Cypress Hill Cemetery. Their first rabbi was Falkman Teberich, while Ignatz Stein served as president of the congregation. The parent organization, recorded as early as 1846, was not a synagogue but a mutual aid society, called ÔBohemian Brothers.Ó This society is mentioned in the minutes of Emanu-El Congregation in New York of May 30, 1847, under the name of ÔBőhmischer Verein.Õ Simon Klauber was president, Charles S. Kuh vice-president, Dr. Brockman as treasurer and M. Opper was secretary. [41]\n\nIllinois\n\nHenry Horner (1817-78) was the first Bohemian Jew, and one of the first four Jews to settle in Chicago. He came to America in 1840, and, was hired in Chicago as a clerk for a clothing house, where he remained until he opened his own wholesale and retail house, Henry Horner and Co. His company started at Randolph and Canal Streets. In 1859 Horner built a large store at Nos. 78, 80 and 82 West Randolph Street, and in 1864 he moved his business to South Water Street. His grandson, bearing identical name, became governor of Illinois.[42]\n\nIn 1852, Joseph Benedict Greenhut (1843-1918) from Horšovský Týn, Bohemia immigrated with his parents and settled in Chicago. He was a volunteer in the Union Army during Civil War and took part in the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. He was made adjutant general and chief of staff of 3rd Brigade, 3rd Div. of the 11th Army Corps and took part in the campaign and battles of his brigade in Tennessee. After 1869 he conducted a distilling business with unprecedented success. He erected largest distillery in the world at Peoria, IL. In 1887 he organized the Distillery and Cattle Feeding Co., with a capital of $35 million, comprising practically all large distilleries in the country. When Pres. McKinley and his entire cabinet visited Peoria in 1899 they were guests of the Greenhuts. [43]\n\nMichigan\n\nSolomon Weil (1821-1891) was the first Bohemian Jew to come to Michigan. He was a native of Bohumileč near Čkyně, Bohemia, from which he emigrated in 1843, settling in Ann Arbor. He was the first Jew in that city. He was soon joined by his future wife Dora and his brothers: Leopold, Moses, Marcus and Jacob, and his father Joseph. They all first conducted individual businesses but later decided to pool their resources and establish a family-run tannery J. Weil & Bros. Jacob Weil (1827-1912), who was highly educated, having initially studied in Prague to be a rabbi and later graduated from the University in Budapest, was chosen to be the firmÕs president. Just three years after they bought the tannery, the R.G. Dun & Company reported the brothersÕ worth as $50,000, and their business as Òone of the most successful firms in the West.Ó By 1861, the tannery employed from 40 to 50 men. Five years later their real estate was worth about $100,000. [44]\n\nIn 1847, three Lederer brothers, Charles, Henry and Emanuel, also from Čkyně, Bohemia, settled in Ann Arbor. Subsequently they moved to Lansing, Michigan, where they established a tannery, soap manufacturing and general store.\n\nIn the same year another Bohemian Jew arrived, named Abraham Weidenthal (1818-1848), who after two years moved to Cleveland, OH, where he became a prominent journalist.\n\nWisconsin\n\nAmong the earliest Jewish immigrants to settle in Milwaukee in 1844 was Isaac Neustadtl (d. l877) from Bohemia. [45] He started out as a retail grocer on Third Street but soon involved himself in the insurance business. Apart from his successful business, he was very active in the political and civic affairs of the city. In 1852/53 he was elected city alderman in the Second Ward, which contained the largest segment of Milwaukee's Jewish population. Neustadtl sympathized with the European revolutionary movement of 1848 and headed an association in Milwaukee for aiding political refugees from Europe. On Yom Kippur in 1847, 12 Jewish pioneers held their first services at the home of Isaac Neustadtl at Chestnut and Fourth Streets, leading to the establishment of Emanu-El, the first Jewish congregation in Milwaukee.\n\nThe second Bohemian Jew to come to Milwaukee was Josef B. Schram (1817-1900) in 1846, after spending some time in Boston. He opened a grocery store which he conducted for twenty-six years. His son Louis B. Schram (*1856) studied at Yale and received a law degree from Columbia in 1879. Since then he successfully practiced law in Milwaukee.\n\nThe third Bohemian Jew to come to Milwaukee was Solomon Adler (1816-1890), who originally immigrated to New York in 1843. He established a menÕs store in Milwaukee, jointly with Jacob Steinhardt which existed till 1852. He then formed another firm with his brother David under the name A & D Adler Co. When Solomon Adler retired from the firm and left for New York, the company was reorganized as the David Adler and Sons Clothing Co., which grew to be one of the largest wholesale clothing houses in the United States. While still in Milwaukee, Solomon was very active in Jewish affairs and held the office of secretary of the first Jewish cemetery organization in Milwaukee, as well as secretary of the first Jewish congregation in Milwaukee and the first president of the newly consolidated congregation Emanu-El BÕne Jeshurun.\n\nIn 1847 and the following years a number of other Bohemian Jews settled in Milwaukee, including Adolph Weil (1847), Henry Katz (1847), Bernard Heller (1848), Jacob Morawetz (1849), Jonas Schoenmann (1850), Isaac Strnský (1850).\n\nOhio\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Simon Block (1742-1832) moved to Cincinnati sometimes after 1810; he was the first Bohemian Jew in Ohio. When Simon Block died in 1832 Cincinnati's Jewish congregation mourned \"the loss of Simon Block, Esq., formerly of Richmond, Va. This venerable gentleman had filled the office of Parnass. . . . Being the oldest amongst us, we considered him as the father of this congregation.\" [46]\n\nIn 1848, Adolph Brandeis (1820-) from Prague, Bohemia came to Cincinnati scouting for a new home for his extended family, after immigrating first to New York that year. In January 1849 he worked for a Cincinnati grocery store, which gave him the necessary experience for his future business. Later that year, twenty-six members of Gottlieb WehleÕs family from Prague arrived in New York to join him. Adolph Brandeis who soon after married Gottlieb WehleÕs daughter then accompanied them to Cincinnati. They stayed for about a month and then all members minus two moved to Madison, IN. The two who remained were Dr. Sigmund Dembitz and his son Lewis N. Dembitz (1833-1907). Here then LewisÕ father practiced medicine while young Lewis studied law. He did it in the fashion of the day by obtaining an employment and reading law in the office of a rising lawyer John Bernhard Stallo.\n\nIn 1849, another Bohemian Jew, Abraham Weidenthal (1818-1848), a native of Hostice, moved to Cleveland, OH, after first immigrating to Michigan in 1847. He brought with him his new wife, Rebecca Neuman (1823-1890), also a native from Bohemia, whom he married at Ann Arbor, MI in 1847. Other members of the Weidenthal family, including GottliebÕs mother Rebecca, his bothers Bernard and Leopold and sisters Fanny and Charlotte joined them the same year. The youngest GottliebÕs brother Emanuel (1827-1897) arrived in Cleveland with his wife Julia and their six children around 1865. A least three of these children, Maurice, Henry and Leo became prominent journalists in Cleveland.\n\nIn 1849, Joseph Lőwy (1797-1870), another Bohemian Jew, arrived from Nov Hostice, together with his sons Leopold, Ignatz and Albert and daughter Dorothea. Two years later Dorothea Lőwy married Bernard Weidenthal.\n\nNotable Personalities among the Bohemian Jews in America\n\nMost Bohemian Jewish immigrants established themselves quite quickly in their new homeland and many of them achieved remarkable success, in just about every area of human endeavor. Although most major areas are covered here, because of the lack of space, only a few most representative individuals in specific areas are included.\n\nAmerican Judaism\n\nSeveral prominent American rabbis can claim Czech ancestry. Among them, by far, the leading place is held by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, originally spelled Weiss (1819-1900), who was born in Lomnička, Bohemia. In July 1846, he immigrated to NY and in September 1846 was elected rabbi of the Jewish congregation of Albany, NY where he remained until 1854 when he was elected rabbi of the Emanu-El B'ne Jeshurun Congregation of Cincinnati, where he officiated until end of his life. In Cincinnati he began publishing a weekly newspaper The Israelite (later The American Israelite). He was a pioneer, founder and organizer of Reform Judaism in US and most influential Jewish personality in US at his time. He was instrumental in organizing the Union of American Hebrew Congregation (1873) and in founding Hebrew Union College (1875), which he served as president until his death. In 1889 he also founded the Central Conference of American Rabbis and served as its president until the end of his life. [47]\n\nBernard Illowy (l8l2 1871) from Koln, Bohemia was probably the second most influential rabbi in America of Czech ancestry. He was an orthodox rabbi and scholar educated at the rabbinical school in Padua and the University of Budapest. At time of his immigration to US in 1848 he was the only Orthodox rabbi to hold a doctorate degree in the US. He served as rabbi in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Syracuse, Baltimore, New Orleans and Cincinnati. He stressed Orthodox observance in his sermons and was a powerful speaker, accomplished lyricist, and great Talmudist.[48]\n\nThe third rabbi of significance was Maximilian Heller (1860-1929), a native of Prague, who was educated in Prague and Cincinnati. He became rabbi in Chicago (1884-86), Houston (1886-87) and of the Temple Sinai in New Orleans (s. 1887), where he served for more than 40 years. He was active in communal affairs and in1912 was appointed professor of Hebrew and Hebrew literature at Tulane University, where he served until retirement in 1928. He was a Charter member of Central Conference of American Rabbis, serving as their president from 1911-29.[49]\n\nStephen S. Wise (1874-1949) was a descendant of a long line of rabbis in Moravia in the 17th and 18th centuries. After immigration to New York as a child and after his ordination as a Reform rabbi, he led a congregation in Portland, Oregon, where his liberal political convictions inspired him to fight for child labor laws and for the demands of striking workers. A charismatic orator, he became a champion for social justice and civil rights and was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He later became a strong advocate and vocal supporter of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's ÔNew Deal.Õ\n\nOther rabbis of note include Emanuel Schreiber (1852-1932), Moses J. Gries (1868-1918), Eugene Kohn (1887-1977, James G. Heller (1892-1971), and Leo Jung (1892-1977).\n\nPublic Service\n\nExecutive Branch - In the Executive branch of the Federal Government, Madeleine Albright (1937-) achieved the highest rank, having been named the Secretary of State by President Clinton. She was born in Prague to Czech diplomat Josef Korbel and his wife. Although she received her doctorate relatively late in life (1976), her career then skyrocketed. She became a legislative assistant to Senator Edmund Muskie, followed by similar appointment with the National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Later she was given a chair at George Washington University. She became an advisor to Presidential candidate Walter Mondale and to Michael Dukakis. When Bill Clinton became President, she was named US Ambassador to the UN and his next term, he appointed her Secretary of State.[50]\n\nThe second highest position held by a Bohemian Jew was Caspar Weinberger (1917-2006), whose paternal grandfather was a native of Bohemia. He served in the administrations of three U.S. presidents, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and as Secretary of Defense. He was noted for his budget-cutting ability until, as Secretary of defense, he pressed for huge annual increases in military spending.[51]\n\nA third very influential person was Charles William Taussig (1896-1948), whose paternal grandfather was a native of Prague. Charles W. Taussig was President of the American Molasses Company in 1933, when he became one of the original members of the \"brain trust\" of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. From 1935 to 1936, he served as Chairman of the National Advisory Committee of the National Youth Administration. Taussig co-chaired the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission in 1942, and was chairman of the American delegation from 1946 until his death in 1948. He also served as a member of the President's Council for the Virgin Islands, chairman of the U.S. Commission to Study Social and Economic Conditions in the British East Indies, and on the United Nations Conference on International Organization. [52]\n\nLegislative Branch - Two senators of Bohemian Jewish ancestry are Benjamin F. Jonas of Louisiana and John F. Kerry of Massachusetts.\n\nBenjamin Franklin Jonas (1834-1911) was a grandson of Jewish immigrant from Švihov, Bohemia. He enlisted in the army during the early days of the Civil War and was later promoted to the rank of major. He was a member of the Louisiana state house of representatives in 1865. Following the war, he served as a US Senator during Reconstruction as a Democrat from 1879 to 1885. He was the second Jewish US Senator from Louisiana.[53]\n\nJohn Forbes Kerry (1943-) is the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts, and, until recently, was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As the Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party, he was defeated by 34 electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election by President George W. Bush. Senator Kerry is a Vietnam veteran, and was a spokesman for Vietnam Veterans against the War when he returned home from service. Before entering the Senate, he served as an Assistant District Attorney and Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. In 2003 it was discovered that Kerry's paternal grandparents came from Horn Benešov, Moravia. They were Jewish but prior to immigration to US they changed their names and switched to Roman Catholicism. His grandfather changed his name from Fritz Kohn to Frederick Kerry. Until this discovery, Senator Kerry thought that his ancestors were Irish Catholics.[54]\n\nAmong Congressmen, Adolph Joachim Sabath (1866-1952), a native of Zboř, Bohemia, gets the highest honors. He served as a member of the US House of Representatives from Chicago, Illinois, from 1907 until his death. He served for 23 terms, representing Chicago's Southwest Side, and was chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee. He was known for his advocacy of immigration and social welfare reform.[55]\n\nJudicial Branch – Several Jewish judges with roots in the Czech Lands were appointed to American courts. Two of them held the prestigious posts as Associate Judges of the Supreme Court. The first was Louis D. Brandeis (1856-1941), a native of Louisville, KY, whose father Adolf emigrated from Prague to America in 1848. As a very successful attorney in Boston (1877–1916), he was known as \"the people's attorney\" for his defense of the constitutionality of several state hours-and-wages laws, his devising of a savings-bank life-insurance plan for working people, and his efforts to strengthen the government's antitrust power. His work influenced passage in 1914 of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Appointed by President Wilson to the Supreme Court of the United States (1916), he was noted for his devotion to freedom of speech. Many of his minority opinions, in which he was often aligned with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., later were accepted by the court in the New Deal era.[56]\n\nThe second notable jurist of Czech extraction was Felix Frankfurter (1882-1965), a native of Vienna, Austria, whose mother was born in Uherský Ostroh, Moravia. In 1900 the family emigrated to the United States. After graduating from City College of New York in 1902, Frankfurter entered Harvard Law School. In 1906 Henry Stimson, a New York attorney, recruited Frankfurter as his assistant. When President William Howard Taft appointed Stimson as his secretary of war in 1911, he took Frankfurter along as law officer of the Bureau of Insular Affairs. In 1914, Frankfurter returned to the Harvard Law School as professor of administrative law. Over the next few years he acquired a reputation for holding progressive political views. A founder member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) he criticized the Tennessee Anti-Evolution Law and joined the campaign to overturn the death sentence.\n\nWhen Roosevelt became president he often consulted Frankfurter about the legal implication of his New Deal legislation. In 1939 Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Frankfurter as a Supreme Court justice. Frankfurter took a strong stand on individual civil rights and this led to him being condemned by some as an \"extreme liberal.Ó[57]\n\nState and Municipal Government - At the State level, Henry Horner (1878-1940), whose maternal grandfather immigrated to Chicago, grew to prominence as a lawyer and politician. His political career began in 1914 when he was elected probate judge of Cook County, a post to which he was reelected four times. The younger Horner's ability and impeccable reputation led the Democratic organization to nominate him for governor of Illinois in 1932. Defeating the Republican nominee by a vote of 1,930,330 to 1,364,043, he became the first Democratic chief executive of the state in 17 years. During his tenure as governor (1933-40) he made many notable contributions to the welfare Illinois. His interest in Lincoln resulted in the gathering of one of the finest collections of ÔLincolnianaÕ in the U.S., which he donated to the Illinois State Historical Library.[58]\n\nAt a municipal level, Julius Fleischmann (1871-1925), a son of a Moravian Jew, became mayor of Cincinnati (1900 – 1905). He was the son of Charles Louis Fleischmann, the founder of the Fleischmann Yeast Co. He left college to become the company's General Manager in 1894 when he was twenty-two years old. The wealthiest and also the youngest man to serve as the city's mayor, he was remembered for vastly improving Cincinnati's park system and railways.[59]\n\nOther mayors of Bohemian Jewish ancestry include Isaac W. Taussig (1850-1884), mayor of Jersey City, NJ; William Taussig (1826-1913), mayor of Carondelet, MO; and Walter M. Taussig (1862-1923), mayor of Yonkers, NY,\n\nMilitary Service\n\nBohemian Jewish immigrants participated in just about every war in which the US was involved. First was Solomon Bush (1753-1795), whose father immigrated to Philadelphia and who was an officer in the Pennsylvania militia (1777-87). In July 1777, he was appointed deputy adjutant-general of the state militia by the supreme council of Pennsylvania. In September 1777, he was dangerously wounded in the thigh during a skirmish, and had to be taken to Philadelphia. When the British captured the City in December 1777, he was taken prisoner, but released on parole. His brother, Jonas Bush, was also on the roll of Revolutionary soldiers.[60]\n\nDuring the Civil War, Color Sergeant Leopold Karpeles (1838-1909) , a native of Prague, was instrumental in turning the tide of the May 1864 Wilderness Campaign, which saw his 57th Massachusetts Regiment suffer the highest casualties. Karpeles was badly wounded but he refused to relinquish the flag and be evacuated until he fainted from loss of blood. Karpeles spent most of the next year in military hospitals, and was discharged in May of 1865. He received Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery. He settled in Washington after the war and was rewarded for his military service with a job in the post office, which he held until his death.[61]\n\nRobert Eugene Steiner (1862-1955), a son of a Bohemian Jewish immigrant, served as captain in the Greenville Guards and major in the 2nd Regiment of Alabama National Guard. He raised a cavalry regiment (1916) and, appointed colonel, served with it on the Mexican border. He was promoted to brigadier general of the National Guards (1917), brigadier general of US Army (1917), and Commander of the 62nd Infantry Brigade. During the World War I he returned in command of the 31st division and later was appointed brigadier general (1919).[62]\n\nSeveral high-ranking officers were in the US Navy.

The flagship store downtown became one of Omaha's most prized symbols of modern culture. Brandeis was Nebraska's department store. At its peak in the early 1970s, the chain had 3,000 employees and $100 million dollars in sales. The Crossroads Mall store opened in 1960 with mixed results but soon took off and proved to be one of the best stores in the chain, earning an average of $38 million. Crossroads proved to be extremely successful for Brandeis, despite the risk of opening the first new Brandeis in 50 years. Locations opened across the entire state, downtown (Columbus and Hastings) and in the malls (Conestoga in Grand Island, Southroads & Westroads in Omaha, and Gateway in Lincoln).

Educated at Charles University, he became a full professor of insurance mathematics and mathematical statistics (1925) and in 1932-33 served as a dean. In 1919-39 he served as director of the General Insurance Institute and in 1935-39 director of Social Institute. Following the establishment of Czechoslovakia, he worked out the mathematical basis of the Czechoslovak law on social insurance (1924) and insurance for self-employed (1925). In 1939 he left for Latin America at the invitation of several LA countries to help them prepare similar laws. During 1940-45 he laid the basis for modern insurance in Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Mexico and Costa Rica.\n\nOlga Taussky-Todd (1906-1995), from Olomouc, Moravia, in 1947, served as a mathematics consultant to National Bureau of Standards, in Washington, DC, while being concurrently a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. From 1957 she was a member of the department of mathematics at California Institute of Technology, since 1971 as full professor. She was recognized by her peers as one of the foremost mathematicians of her generation. Her research in algebra, number theory, and matrix theory has influenced scholars throughout her long and distinguished career. For more than 30 years, she had been the moving force in the development of matrix theory, and her influence on both pure and applied mathematics has been profound.[160]\n\nJoseph John Kohn (1932- ), b. Prague, Czech., is a Princeton University trained mathematician. He has been associated With Brandeis Univ. (s. 1958), where he rose to full as professor of mathematics (1964-68). Since 1968 he has been professor of mathematics at Princeton University and dept. chair (1973-76, 1993-96). He is an authority on partial differential operators and function theory and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nPhysics\n\nWolfgang Pauli (1900-1958), a son of a Prague Jewish physician, whose name was originally Pascheles, was a theoretical physicist and one of the pioneers of quantum physics. He discovered that atom's electrons each have their own unique quantum state. Now known as the ÔPauli exclusion principle,Õ this discovery earned him the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physics. [161]\n\nFelix Bloch (1905-1983), a son of Jewish parents from Bohemia, received Nobel Prize for developing the nuclear magnetic resonance method of measuring the magnetic field of atomic nuclei.[162]\n\nGeorge Placzek (1905-1955) from Brno was also an outstanding physicist who made substantial contributions to the fields of molecular physics, scattering of light from liquids and gases, the theory of the atomic nucleus and the interaction of neutrons with condensed matter. [163]\n\nVictor F. Weisskopf (1908-2002), whose father was born in Sušice, Bohemia, was a theoretical physicist of note. During World War II he worked at Los Alamos on the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb, and later campaigned against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He made major contributions to the development of quantum theory, especially in the area of quantum electrodynamics. One of his few regrets was that his insecurity about his mathematical abilities may have cost him a Nobel Prize when he did not publish results (which turned out to be correct) about what is now known as the Lamb shift.[164]\n\nPeter Andreas Grnberg (orig. Grinberg) (1939-), b . Pilsen, Czech. is a Nobel Prize in Physics laureate for his coincidental discovery with Albert Fert of giant magnetoresistance which brought about a breakthrough in gigabyte hard disk drives. Grnberg received his intermediate diploma in 1962 from the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University. He then attended the Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany, where he received his diploma in physics in 1966 and his Ph.D. in 1969. From 1969-1972, he did postdoctoral work at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. He later joined the Institute for Solid State Physics at the Jlich Research Centre, where he became a leading researcher in the field of thin film and multilayer magnetism until his retirement in 2004.\n\nChemistry\n\nFelix Haurowitz (1896-1987) was born in Prague, Bohemia. In 1922-38 he was a member of faculty of dept. of physiology and medical chemistry at the Prague University. After his dismissal by Nazis, he was invited to chair the dept. at University of Istanbul. In 1947 he emigrated to US soon joined thye faculty in the department of chemistry at Indiana University at Bloomington, since 1958 as distinguished professor. He was a pioneer in isolation of fetal hemoglobin, allosteric changes on hemoglobin on oxygenation, introduction of chemical aspects into immunology and into the problem of antibody biosynthesis. [165]\n\nHarry G. Drickamer (orig. Weidenthal) (1918-2002), b. Cleveland, OH, of Bohemian ancestry, was a physical chemist and chemical engineer, associated with the University of Illinois. He was Head of the Division of Chemical Engineering from 1955-58, and became professor emeritus in 1989. He was the first to use infrared and UV-vis spectroscopy to study matter at high pressure, thereby discovering that high pressure perturbs different types of electronic orbitals to different degrees. He discovered a wide variety of electronic transitions in solids and molecules and the optical, electrical, chemical, and magnetic consequences thereof. Drickamer was awarded the National Medal of Science by President George Bush on October 18, 1989 for his pioneering studies in the field of pressure tuning spectroscopy. He also received the Debye Award and many others awards and was a member of the NAS and NAE.\n\nWalter Kohn (1923-), whose father was a native of Hodonn, Moravia, was a Holocaust survivor. He won a Nobel Prize in chemistry. His condensed matter theory made seminal contributions to the understanding of the electronic structure of materials. He played the leading role in the development of the density functional theory, which has revolutionized scientists' approach to the electronic structure of atoms, molecules and solid materials in physics, chemistry and materials science. [166]\n\nEngineering\n\nGustav Lindenthal (1850-1935), a graduate of the Brno Polytechnic, established the reputation as one of the great bridge engineers of America. He is best known for the construction of the Queensboro Bridge, connecting Long Island and New York City, and the Hell Gate Bridge, which connects the railroads of the Bronx with Long Island. In contrast to his American contemporaries, his bridges were characterized by originality and boldness.[167]\n\nAnother engineer, Karl Arnstein (1887-1974), originally from Prague, specialized in the design and construction of airships. He drew plans and supervised the construction of some 70 Zeppelin airships and stratosphere balloons, among them the famous airship ÔLos Angeles,Õ the first to cross the Atlantic. [168]\n\nArthur Aron Hamerschlag (1872-1927), a native of New York, NY, whose both parents were born in Bohemia, was an American electrical and mechanical engineer who served as the first President of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. [169]\n\nOne of the greatest minds among engineers was Theodore V. Karman (1881-1963), whose mother was Helen Kohn, a descendant of Rabbi Judah Loew, the 16th century Prague mystic who is said to have created the Golem. Karman was also a physicist, primarily active in aeronautics and astronautics. He is responsible for many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization. If there were a Nobel Prize for engineering, he would have earned it.[170]\n\nEpilogue\n\nThere is no doubt that future research may uncover additional names of notable Jewish Americans with Bohemian or Czech roots.\n\nIn viewing the mosaic of individual portraits presented here, one is struck by certain characteristics shared by most of the Jewish immigrants from the territory of the Czech Historic Lands. They were all hard working, energetic, enterprising, resourceful, self-made people, with a sense of purpose and accomplishment, highly patriotic towards their newly adopted country, yet mindful of their roots and their cultural and religious upbringing. It is therefore fitting that we conclude this survey with a quotation from Thomas Čapek,[171] the historian of Czechs in America:"
