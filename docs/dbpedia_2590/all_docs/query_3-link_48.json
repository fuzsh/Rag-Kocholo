        "text": "The MIT Press has been an open access leader for nearly three decades, publishing hundreds of books and articles openly, and working with authors, editors, scholars, societies, and research institutions to disseminate scholarly work as broadly as possible. The MIT Press supports a variety of open access funding models for select books and journals and sits on the leading edge of the open access movement in scholarly communication.\n\nWe focus our work in three areas: books, journals, and open access initiatives. If you are interested in learning more about open access at the MIT Press, please contact Nick Lindsay, director of journals and open access, at nlindsay (at) mit.edu.\n\nWith the open publication of City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn by William J. Mitchell in 1995, the MIT Press vaulted into the open access publishing space where it has pushed the limits for close to 30 years. Now, the Press is widely recognized as one of the most innovative open access publishers in the world and has made more than 350 open access books available.\n\nDirect to Open, our open access publishing model, has accelerated our program, publishing over 160 books — scholarly monographs and scholarly collections — in the first two years. And in 2024, we will release the much-anticipated Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science, edited by Michael C. Frank (Stanford) and Asifa Majid (Oxford).\n\nMore about our open access books.\n\nThe MIT Press open access publishing program in journals began with the conversion of Information Technology and International Development from subscription-based to open access in 2006. Our longest-running open access journal is Computational Linguistics, which moved to open access in 2009. Now we are proud that all of our active journals offer some form of open access support, with 13 diamond or gold open access journals. This means our journals make it easy for authors to comply with open access publishing and science requirements from funders or institutions and ensure their scholarship reaches the widest global audience possible.\n\nMore about our open access journals.\n\nMuch like our parent institution, the MIT Press thrives on creative excellence and effective entrepreneurship. As we work “daily to reimagine what a university press can be,” we strive to disrupt restrictive modes of scholarship and redefine scholarly publishing for the 21st century.\n\nOur dedication to innovation is why we were among the first publishers to embrace digital catalogs and ebooks. It is what led to our launching, with the MIT Media Lab in 2018, Knowledge Futures, now a transformative platform developer for open access tools, which includes the PubPub content platform. It is what inspired Direct to Open, a sustainable and scalable open access publishing model that harnesses the collective power of libraries around the globe and has published over 160 open access books in its first two years.\n\nThis commitment to reducing barriers to scholarship continues to inspire our work along new lines of inquiry in scholarly communications and open access publishing.\n\nMore about our open access initiatives.\n\nWe are grateful to the many partners who have supported the open access mission at the MIT Press over the years.\n\nIn May 2023, we announced the establishment of the Arcadia Open Access Fund to support open access books and journals in science and technology, social sciences, arts, and humanities. This fund is made possible by an outright endowment gift of $5 million from Arcadia, who has also provided a $5 million “challenge” gift to incentivize other funders by matching their support of MIT’s open publishing activities.\n\nLearn more about how you can support open access at the MIT Press."
