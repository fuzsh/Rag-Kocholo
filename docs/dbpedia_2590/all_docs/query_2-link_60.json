        "text": "Ben: Welcome to season 8 episode 5 of Acquired, the podcast about great technology companies, and the stories and playbooks behind them. Iâm Ben Gilbert, a co-founder and managing director of Seattle-based Pioneer Square Labs and our venture fund, PSL Ventures.\n\nDavid: And Iâm David Rosenthal, an angel investor based in San Francisco.\n\nBen: And we are your hosts. Letâs talk about the 10 most valuable companies in the world. The first nine are tech companies. Thereâs the big five in the US, plus Tesla because itâs 2021. And then you have Tencent and Alibaba from China. The ninth, TSMC, the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer. And the tenth, the only non-tech company, itâs a 182-year-old company that started as a textile mill in New England, Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nAs most listeners know, Berkshire is far from a textile mill today. It is a holding company, unique in every way, and by far the most successful in history. A few of the companies that they own outright include Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, Geico, NetJets, Seeâs Candies, and even Brooks Running Shoes.\n\nDavid: Seattle company, right?\n\nBen: Oh yeah, and Iâm super loyal. Iâve ran up Mt. Si the other morning.\n\nDavid: Nice.\n\nBen: They also own large pieces of many of your favorite publicly traded companies including Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, American Express, Kraft Heinz, Verizon, GM, Mastercard, Snowflake, and now they even own over $100 billion of Apple stock.\n\nSomehow, the man behind it allâWarren Buffettâhas claimed that purchasing Berkshire Hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made. And for many of you, youâre probably learning that Warren Buffett purchased Berkshire Hathaway and it was not something that he founded, which is the first takeaway from this episode.\n\nDavid: We will cover this again much later in the episode, but he claims that purchasing Berkshire Hathaway cost him $200 billion in opportunity cost.\n\nBen: When you compound something over 50 years, you can come up with some large numbers. What the heck is this company? How did it come to be? Why is it that even at an all-time high for the stock, so many analysts think it is underpriced today? To do this right, we are going to need more than one episode, even an Acquired-sized episode. So welcome to our first part of our two-part series on Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nIn this first part, most of it wonât even be about Berkshire the company. Itâs about the man, Warren Buffett, and his mental iterations and learnings that would shape what Berkshire would come to be.\n\nPeople always try and reduce what Buffett does to a simple strategy or even a few pithy quotes. In reality, Warren has learned, adapted, and reinvented his strategy at least four distinct times over the decades. In doing the months of research to prepare for these episodes, David and I both learned just how much Warrenâs thinking evolved to create the absolutely unreplicatable juggernaut that Berkshire Hathaway is today. In this episode, we bring you the story of Warren Buffett, the learning machine.\n\nAre you an Acquired Slack number? If not, what have you been waiting for? It is a stellar community discussing all things Acquired, recent episodes, but more importantly, it is just a genuine, smart group of people having a thoughtful, nuanced, and respectful discussion about the tech and investing news of the day. You can join at acquired.fm/slack.\n\nToday, for our presenting sponsorship from our friends at Tiny, we have something a little bit different for you. As many of you know, Tiny has been referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway of the Internet. Itâs quite a compliment. They have embraced this (and who wouldnât), and David and I decided that we want to tell youâactually this is with Tinyâs permission, so thanks to the Tiny guys for bearing with us hereâabout a very different product that they sell at berkshirenerds.store.\n\nThis is what I love about these guys. The fact that they would do this really shows you the personality behind who they are, so letâs navigate over to that, David. Iâm going to pull up berkshirenerds.store here in my browser. The title is, âWarren and Charlie, in bronze at last.â You can buy a bust of either of them. Theyâre the same price, which I thought was a very classy decision, $1299 per bust. You can get the complete set there for $2598. Itâs a steal.\n\nDavid: Like Warren, you got to save every dollar.\n\nBen: Absolutely. Think about what those $2 could be compounded over 50 years. The site is wonderfully designed. They have FAQs, such as will my bust give me investment advice, where do you ship to, can I return my bust, and what is the Charlie Munger, which of course, if you click it, it says, âIâm sorry, but this site isn't for you. Please leave.â\n\nThere are some wonderful photography. You can just feel how these busts could look in your office. After listening to this episode, if youâre like, gosh these guys really changed my life, I suggest you head over to berkshirenerds.store and pick up one of these.\n\nDavid: These things are amazing. berkshirenerds.store is basically like the Seeâs Candy of Tiny.\n\nBen: You think this is their cash flow business?\n\nDavid: Itâs esoteric. You wouldnât think that a little candy store would generate $1.65 billion in pretax profit to be redeployed within the business, but there it is.\n\nBen: I suppose if Warren can keep a clipping of the Black Friday crash on his wall, then we should all keep a bust of Warren in our office to remind us of sage lessons that we want to remember, too.\n\nDavid: Or Charlie. Which one of us is which?\n\nBen: Thatâs a good question.\n\nDavid: I think we should each get one.\n\nBen: Charlie I feel is kind of the color guy, so I would probably get Charlie.\n\nDavid: I kind of want Charlie. Okay, Iâll be satisfied with Warren.\n\nBen: Anyway folks, head over to berkshirenerds.store. Thank you to the good people at Tiny for bearing with us when this is the ad read that we wanted to do for this episode today. As always, if you are contemplating a sale or even wonder what it might look like for the future of your wonderful Internet business, you should reach out, tell them that Ben and David from Acquired sent you. You can learn more at tinycapital.com or click the link in the show notes.\n\nLastly, to keep this short and sweet, if you are not an Acquired LP, you really should just become one. Aside from all the things that we tell you every episode about the LP program, we just did a really cool new thing we called community Q&A with the founder of Levels, Josh Clemente, after we had him on the show. We thought, wouldnât it be cool to let all the LPs pepper him with questions and interact with him? That was super fun. If you missed it, you can check out the recording in the LP Google Drive. If you are not already a limited partner, you can click the link in the show notes or go to acquired.fm/lp. Cannot wait to see you in there.\n\nDavid, I think we are ready to do it. Listeners, as always, the show is not investment advice. Like Warren Buffett, we would never profess to give you investment advice. All of our best ideas we will keep a deep dark secretâmaybe until long after weâve executed themâso we can tell the world about our wonderful investments. David and I may have investments in the company that we discuss. The showâs educational, for entertainment purposes only. We hope you enjoy it. Without further ado, David Rosenthal, where are we starting the story?\n\nDavid: Iâve been a proud Berkshire Hathaway shareholder of the B, not the A, for pretty much my entire life. The greatest thing that my parents and grandparents gave me was a few shares of Berkshire B when I was a little tyke. Never sold them.\n\nBen: Very smart investment on their part. Whatâs your sell date on them? Where are you exiting the position?\n\nDavid: Never.\n\nBen: As it should be.\n\nDavid: Before we dive into history and facts, we owe a big, big, big thank you to Alice Schroeder and her wonderful book, The Snowball, which I (at least) used as my main source for this episode. Ben, you read theâ¦\n\nBen: Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, a great book by Roger Lowenstein. I thought this book was awesome. People talk about Snowball all the time as the sort of more popular Buffett biography. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, so I think you canât go wrong.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Weâll get to compare and contrast as we go here. Aliceâs own storyâs pretty amazing. I didnât realize until looking this up. She was an equity research analyst on Wall Street covering insurance companies, and she wrote to Warren in 1998 asking to talk to him. Warren had never talked to Wall Street research analysts before, but for some reason he takes her call. She was the first research analyst to initiate coverage on Berkshire. Kind of amazing.\n\nThen in 2003, another author approached her about writing a book together on Buffett. She talks to Buffett and he says, well why donât you just write it instead and Iâll give you full access, like thousands of hours with him. Itâs amazing. Amazing story, so definitely go check out both The Snowball and Buffett. Great books, highly, highly recommend.\n\nBen: And listeners, weâll have to see how this goes. This is the second time, I think. The New York Times would have been the first one, but David and I both just read separate books. I think we both read them cover-to-cover. Obviously, weâve got a few dozen other sources that we use for this as well, but we may have stories that one or another does not know about.\n\nDavid: Yeah, we shall see. Iâll go first and start appropriately enough back in 1867, with a journey from New York to Omaha undertaken by a young gentleman named Sidney Buffett, who was working for his fatherâs farm in Long Island. He quits because he feels like heâs not getting paid enough. Like so many young men of his generation, he decides to go west to seek his fortune, and he ends up in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nBen: He got part of the way west.\n\nDavid: Part of the way west. I think his maternal grandfather was already there in Omaha, that might have been why he headed there, but the other reason was that Omaha was a boom town at the time. It had existed for a long time. It was kind of a pit stop on the trail west, the Oregon Trail or the California Trail for gold prospectors heading out west.\n\nAfter the US civil war, Lincoln decrees that Omaha is going to be the headquarters of the new Union Pacific railroad, which is going to connect up the West Coast of the United States with the rest of the country. And the town takes off. Now interestingly, Union Pacific is still around and operating today, ironically as the second largest rail company in America, after Burlington Northern Santa Fe, owned by Berkshire Hathaway. But that wouldnât come until part two.\n\nSidney gets to town and decides he does want to be a farmer anymore. He instead wants to sell products from the farm. He opens up the first grocery store in Omaha. He runs it and then effectively passes it on to his son. His son, Ernest Buffett, (I think) actually technically set up a different story, but itâs like the family business, so Ernest is running the legacy of the grocery store in Omaha. As Alice points out in The Snowball, Ernest was very, very aptly named (as weâll see), under Ernest management of the store, his quote that he likes to use is, âThe hours are long, the pay is low, the opinions cast in iron, and the foolishness is zero.â\n\nBen: Hardcore.\n\nDavid: Yeah, hardcore. Typical of this new entrepreneurial middle class, Ernest and his wife, Henrietta, were fine with their children working in the store, but they want them to get a good education and become professionals. Most of their children go to the University of Nebraska, including their third son, Howard, who majors in journalism and works at The Daily Nebraskan school newspaper.\n\nWhile heâs working there, he meets a freshman who comes in and is applying for a job, Leila Stahl, whose father owned a local newspaper in Nebraska. They meet, they hit it off, they marry. Of course, these are Warrenâs parents that weâre talking about, and amazingly they meet at the college newspaper. Very fitting. The newspaper business is going to play a large part in young Warrenâs life to come.\n\nHoward graduates in 1925, he and Leila marry, and as was typical of the time, unfortunately she drops out of school. By all accounts, she was an incredibly promising student, very good at math. Her professors were very disappointed when she drops out to marry Howard and become a housewife.\n\nHoward wants to go into journalism and eventually politics, but Ernest is having none of it. His son needs a respectable, professional career; the no-nonsense Ernest. He instead suggests that Howard might want to do something more useful, something more like selling insurance. The ironies just continue to mount here.\n\nBen: Weâve got newspapers already. Weâve got insurance already. Either Berkshire Hathaway basically has an index on the American economy, or the forces that would then shape, bore, and forever are already playing a role in his life.\n\nDavid: Theyâre already stacking here.\n\nBen: Probably some of both.\n\nDavid: Maybe more the latter because thereâs one more chip to stack. Howardâheâs an insurance agent selling insurance, in the late 1920s now, itâs the roaring 20s and its go-go timeâafter a couple years, decides maybe this insurance stuff is pretty boring. Either my customers here in Omaha donât want insurance anymore. They want stocks.\n\nHe switches careers, two years out of school, and goes from selling insurance to being a stockbroker in Omaha. I didnât understand this up and have been thinking about this. You hear about stock brokers. What does it mean to be a stockbroker in Omaha in 1927? You got to remember, thereâs no Charles Schwab. For one, Schwab was hugely innovative.\n\nBen: How are you brokering stocks if youâre not on the floor?\n\nDavid: Thereâs the New York Stock Exchange in New York, but for the rest of the retail public in America, how did they get stocks, youâve got a local broker who is your sort of like combination financial advisor plus exchange access. You call your broker, or more often he callsâit was always a he at the timeâyou and would say, hey Iâve got this great stock that you might want to think about getting into. I know you and your portfolio, your investment objectives. You chat on the phone with him for a while or you go to his office, then you would sign up and you would buy shares. He would then call the exchange back in New York, get a trader on the line, and then buy in your name some shares.\n\nBen: Oh, so they would get a trader on? It wasnât like the brokerages bought these big blocks and then they would sort of sub. Your broker would call a trader on the floor to execute your trade?\n\nDavid: I think it was kind of both if you wanted a specific trade to happen. But more often what would happen was the big banks, financial firms, and trading houses in New York have product that they needed to move. They had issuances that they needed to move. They had trades that they were doing. They needed counterparties to the trades. All these local stockbrokers distributed throughout the country were like the distribution and sales force. There are people who talk about sales and trading back in the day and are part of investment banks. The sales part of it was an effort to educate all these local brokers to then recommend and push stocks to the clients.\n\nBen: Pretty fascinating, and at this point in history, investing isnât really like a profession with a lot of science behind it. Itâs kind of looked at as gambling, like buying stocks?\n\nDavid: Totally. Fundamental analysis does not exist yet. Exactly gambling is the right word. It kind of like tickets to bet on a horse, like oh, I like the name of this company or I like what theyâre doing, but nobodyâs thinking about whatâs the capital structure of this company or its revenues, whereâs its growth prospects. Thatâs not how this works.\n\nLater in life as we shall see, Warren would do a brief interlude working for his father at the firm as a stockbroker himself. He called what they did equivalent to being a âprescriptionistâ versus being a doctor. It would be like if you were a medical professional and you got paid based on the type and amount of pills that you prescribe to your patients versus the actual outcomes because youâre just getting paid by the commission on every stock that you sell. The incentives are totally misaligned.\n\nBen: Youâre making me pull for my first playbook theme already. Warrenâs not even born yet in this story, but this will ultimately be one of his very first realizations. What is the point of me researching the crap out of these companies and picking stocks when all Iâm getting paid for is just to move product? Like you said, itâs a total incentive misalignment. But letâs stick on Warrenâs father.\n\nDavid: Okay, so Howard (1927) switches over to becoming a stockbroker. Things are really great, the family is doing great for two years, and then October 29th, 1929. I donât think we talked about this on the show yet.\n\nBen: Amazingly no. Weâve made 150+ episodes without talking about Black Friday.\n\nDavid: Black Tuesday.\n\nBen: Black Tuesday, oh.\n\nDavid: Black Friday is a much happier event. A real capitalism-fest. Itâs not a capitalism-fest on Black Tuesday.\n\nBen: America has left its mark on me. All right, so Black Tuesday.\n\nDavid: Black Tuesday. Of course, weâre talking about the stock market crash on Black Tuesday. I think it actually wasnât that bad by modern standards. I think the Dow dropped in the low teens maybe percentages on Black Tuesday but it was still shocking to people. The real problem is over the next three years after Black Tuesday. The market loses 90% of its value. Can you imagine that? Thatâsâ\n\nBen: Unbelievable.\n\nDavid: I mean in 2008, I think the market lost close to 50%, maybe, but 90% people were just wiped out. Itâs carnage.\n\nBen: The way that itâs described in Lowensteinâs book, what was unique and remarkable about the Great Depression, was that even the smart money got wiped out. The people who realized things are cheap now the crash is over would buy, and even they lost all their money. Of course, that is the thing to fear when everyoneâs screaming âbuy the dip.â Of course, that hasnât happened to this level, as youâre saying, since 1929 but just crushed everyone.\n\nDavid: To grossly oversimplify what at least I think happened and why it hasnât fortunately happened since is the stock market crashed and that led people to panic. That led to runs on banks. People wanted their cash out of banks. Banks were not nearly as institutionalized as they are now and there was no FDIC insurance. That was put in place after the crash.\n\nWhen the runs on the banks, that led to bank failures. When all these local banks failed, the Fed had to (I think) raise interest rates because borrowing was so hard now that thereâs so much less capital base available to borrow. The interest rates have to go up. Youâve got an economic shock and interest rates are going up.\n\nBen: You want to be able to lower them.\n\nDavid: Right. When Coronavirus hitm the Feds slashed it to less than zero, and the same thing in 2008. Itâs a double whammy of economic shock plus major interest rate hikes. It was more than a decade really until World War II. The stock market, the Dow wouldnât return to its high before the crash until 1954. Thatâs 25 years. Thatâs a quarter of a century just lost. Crazy.\n\nOkay, so back to Howard and the Buffetts. Howard does something pretty crazy. Itâs bad. Warren is born less than a year after Black Tuesday. On August 30th 1930, Warren Edward Buffett is born. The next yearâit wasnât until 1931âHoward was working as a stock broker for Union State Bank and the bank fails. Not only is Howard out of a job, but all the familyâs moneyâs at the bank. They got no money, they got no job, and Howard and Leila now have two kids.\n\nWhat does Howard do? He does the 100% total contrarian move. First, he does try to go to his father, to Ernest, and get a job at the family grocery store. Ernest was like, I donât have any money to pay you. I canât employ you. Howard sets up his own stock brokerage firm. Weâre in the middle of the Great Depression after the crash, and heâs just like, well I know how to be a stockbroker. He was not totally crazy because the world is melting down, but for anyone who does still have some wealth left, they need something to do with it. Theyâre not going to put it in the stocks that they were in before the crash.\n\nHoward has this business plan. He starts going around Omaha to anyone who still has any wealth left, and he advises them on hyper conservative investments that they can use their capital for select utility companies, municipal bonds, that kind of stuff, and it works. Thereâs actually demand for this kind of service. Heâs placing all these hyper conservative securities. He ends up making (I think) pretty quickly way more money than he was making at the old job.\n\nBen: Wow. I didnât realize that he broke out on his own there and started his own brokerage.\n\nDavid: Yes, started his own brokerage. It would eventually come to be known as Buffett and Falk. Even though Warren has no memory of this, of these two years of really hard times, the family actually skates through the depression fairly well off.\n\nBen: His dad bought the dip.\n\nDavid: Exactly. Unsurprisingly to anyone whoâs heard of himâprobably everybody listening to this podcastâWarren turns out to be an extremely mathematical kid. Heâs always counting things. Heâs counting bottle caps, heâs counting his weight, heâs running all sorts of analysis even as a little kid.\n\nBen: Did you see he was counting the occurrences of letters in newspaper articles, and then he and his friend would tally them up and make bets on which letters were going to appear more often than others? He was counting completely arbitrary things just to count them.\n\nDavid: You might say that he has some budding OCD developing in his person.\n\nBen: He was writing down license plates that went by. It was hardcore.\n\nDavid: It was hardcore. Famously as the story goesâthereâs actually a picture of thisâfor Christmas when Warren is 6 years old, he receives one of those money coin changers that you wear on your belt, like the old style. I actually had one of these too when I was growing up.\n\nBen: Me too. I got one from my grandpa.\n\nDavid: Amazing.\n\nBen: With the little crank that you push down, the little lever.\n\nDavid: Yup, and then it spits out one coin at a time. Then there is the separate slot for quarters and dimes, for nickels and pennies. That thing was so cool. Warren gets this and he becomes obsessed with it. This is the culmination of counting, collecting things, analyzing, and money. He wants to get as many coins as he possibly can to stuff into this thing. He starts keeping jars in his drawers. Itâs amazing.\n\nHe starts to think, how can I get more money? He goes (I assume) to his grandfather to the grocery store, buys packs of gum in bulk, and then he starts going around door to door in the neighborhood and selling individual packs of gum to mothers in the neighborhood for 5Â¢ a pop. Amazing. He gets this racket going. Then he starts selling soda door to door.\n\nBen: Didnât he, on a vacation, goes and buys some Cokes and heâs wandering around the edge of a lake selling Cokes for twice as much as he bought them for?\n\nDavid: I donât think this was in The Snowball.\n\nBen: Yeah, itâs exactly that. And it was Cokes. I remember that. Despite his soon-to-come Pepsi addiction, his earliest childhood sales came from Cokes.\n\nDavid: Amazing. So heâs starting to accumulate the beginnings of the Warren Buffett wealth. When heâs 10 years old, Howard takes him on one of his trips to New York and to Wall Street. This amazing; you probably have read this, too. Warren actually gets to meet the legendary Sidney Weinberg who was the head of Goldman Sachs at the time. Heâs 10 years old. Warren Buffettâs 10 years old and his dad takes him to meet Sidney Weinberg.\n\nSupposedly, Warrenâs sitting there starstruck the whole time, and as theyâre leaving, Sidney supposedly turns to him and says, what stock do you like, Warren? Unfortunately, The Snowball, Alice doesnât say what Warren responds. I want to know what the hot pick is. But heâs totally starstruck. This makes a huge impression on him.\n\nBefore they come home after the Weinberg meeting, his dad takes him to the New York Stock Exchange, the building for lunch. It was great, amazing lunch in this gilded building. After lunch, a waiter comes up to the table with a tray that has all of these different types of tobacco on it and rolling papers for cigars. Warren realizes that after lunch at the exchange, you get a custom cigar made for you. You choose the tobacco. He has no interest then or ever in smoking a cigar or even in any of these trappings of wealth, but he realizes if this is how they roll at the New York Stock Exchange every day, there must be so much money here. I got to find a way to get me some of this.\n\nBen: Did you know if he got to see the trading floor as a 10-year-old?\n\nDavid: I think so.\n\nBen: Have you ever been?\n\nDavid: No. Have you?\n\nBen: Yeah. When I was 16 or something, I went as part of a high school trip. There was someone who had taken a class that I had previously taken who worked at the stock exchange and got us in. We went on the balcony and all that. It leaves a mark. Looking out at this, this would have been 2005 or 2006, something like that, so it was mostly already computers and you donât have people making every trade live on the floor the way you wouldâve in those days. But even that leaves an impression especially as a teenager how much gravitas there is there. That thatâs the central clearing house of equities in our nation. Thatâs an impactful experience.\n\nDavid: Itâs capitalism there incarnate. To this trip and the wealth that he sought at the stock exchange and at Goldman, he says he didnât have any desire to have any of the fancy stuff, but he says he did want independence. He said, âI realize wealth could make me independent. Then I could do what I wanted with my life. And the biggest thing I wanted was to work for myself. I didnât want other people directing me. The idea of doing what I wanted to do every day was important to me.â\n\nBen: Thatâs certainly happened.\n\nDavid: It certainly happened. It just resonates so much. I feel exactly the same way. When he gets home, he decides that heâs going to set a goal to amass this wealth thatâs going to get him the independence that he wants. He tells all his family and friends that his goal is heâs going to be a millionaire by the age of 35. Being a millionaire in those days would be equivalent to about $15â$20 million in net worth today.\n\nToday, anybody can do it and itâs great. Even our entrepreneurial, startup-friendly ecosystem, itâs probably not totally crazy if a little kid said that they wanted to amass a $20 million fortune by the time they were 35. In Omaha in 1940 this was totally nuts.\n\nBen: Iâll bet. It reminds me so much too when he would say several times throughout his lifeâIâm going to paraphrase because I donât have the exact quoteâthat he doesnât want to be rich to be rich. He wants to have a lot of money because itâs fun to have a lot of money and itâs fun to watch it grow. You can sort of already see that in his ambition here is not to make some specific impact or to get to do a certain thing to see his passion for it. Itâs, no, I want to be a rich person. Itâs fascinating how even so early in his life heâs just unabashed about that.\n\nI think weâre talking to every founder right now thatâs going out. Fifty percent wants to be rich and 50% wants to accomplish the mission that theyâre on. Theyâre like, Iâm here to accomplish the mission that weâre on because weâve all had it browbeaten into us. It is not virtuous to want to be and heâs like, no, I want to be a rich person. Later in his life he would also decide, I want to be likable, I want to be an icon for America, I want to be a platform for learning, I want to teach, but at this point heâs like, I want to be a rich person.\n\nDavid: I just want to be rich, yeah. Itâs kind of amazing. Even the 50% of people and vendors out there who do just want to be rich would never say that.\n\nBen: Right. Itâs a very Buffett sort of singular focus, and frankly not caring about what other people think of him to just have that out front.\n\nDavid: Yes, just come out with it. This is pretty amazing. Heâs 10 years old, he has this goal, and he figured something out at the age of 10 that just drives the entire rest of his life. I think itâs something that 99.9% of people out there in the world never figure out, which is this concept that money can create more money, which obviously compounding, which weâll spend most of the rest of the next several hours here and several hours on the next episode talking about, but he figures this out. It just simply reduced to them; money can create more money.\n\nThe way he figures it outâthe story goesâhe had gone to the library and taken out a book called One Thousand Ways to Make $1000. One of those books that could only exist in the 1940s and 1950s. One of the 1000 schemes that it describes in the book is that you could buy a penny weighing machine. These things used to exist. Theyâre scales in public that would be on street corners, drug stores, and stuff. You would weigh yourself on it.\n\nBen: Iâve seen these in my grocery stores.\n\nDavid: Yeah, and you pay a penny. You put a put a penny in the slot and then youâll get to weigh yourself. The scheme in the book is that you just go buy a penny weighing machine, then you collect the money over time, and eventually youâll get $1000 out of it.\n\nWarren reads this and heâs like, wait a minute. What if I buy one weighing machine, then once I earn enough money from it I use that money to go buy another weighing machine, put in a different spot, and then Iâve got these two weighing machines both earning pennies every day. Well, the rate at which Iâll earn enough to buy my third weighing machine is going to be half as much time. And by my fourth weighing machine, another third is less time. He figures this out. He apparently literally starts writing out essentially compound interest tables in his bedroom in his notebook, dreaming about all these weighing machines that heâs going to have.\n\nBen: Itâs so crazy.\n\nDavid: Amazing. Other kids would be thinking about using all this money to buy bubble gum, baseball cards, or something.\n\nBen: And heâs 10. I knew that later as he gets into his teenage years, heâs got a little pinball servicing business, but heâs 10. Thatâs crazy.\n\nDavid: Yeah, so you alluded to. He never does do the weighing machines, but when heâs in high school, yeah he buysâ\n\nBen: Oh, he actually didnât end up buying. He just does the formulas to see what it would be?\n\nDavid: No, he just does the formulas, but he does buy used pinball machines in high school. He makes a ton of money off these things. He puts them in barbershops. Itâs great.\n\nBen: Do you know why he got out of that business? The pinball?\n\nDavid: No. I assume just because he graduated high school.\n\nBen: No. This is a callback to our Nolan Bushnell episode. Warren found out that this was a business that if you get too powerful in it, then you start having to contend with the mafia for whoâs getting a cut of doing that servicing. He basically was like, I donât want anything to do with that, and he and his friend got out of that business.\n\nDavid: Wasnât Nolan saying something about the pinball machines were linked to bootlegging too during prohibition?\n\nBen: Bootlegging, money laundering. Theyâve got sort of a storied history there that would then bleed into arcade games, too, because I think it was an outcropping of the other?\n\nDavid: Thatâs right. These are during Warrenâs less scrupulous early years.\n\nBen: He had this whole game too that he was running, where he and his friend would basically pretend that they werenât the guys in-charge, that they work for some bigger company, so whenever theyâd get harassed for something, or they would complain about prices or something like that they would say, look, weâre just the hired hands. Weâre not the guys in-charge. We donât set the prices. Thatâs such a good bit.\n\nDavid: So great. The other thing he does when he gets back from the New York trip is that he starts buying stocks. Heâs got his dad the stockbroker right there, so heâs got the line and he can go buy stocks. He convinces his big sister Doris to pool all of their money togetherâtheyâre about $200â$250 between themâand he decides heâs going to buy preferred shares in a company called Cities Service. Heâs the (sort of) managing partner in this partnership.\n\nThey buy 6 shares for $38 a share and immediately the stock goes down to $27 a share, so not an auspicious beginning. Doris is freaking out about this and Warren feels horrible; itâs eating him up. The stock does recover at $40 a share and Warren just unloaded. Heâs like, great get the money back. Give Doris her money back. But it keeps going. Pretty quickly, the stock goes to over $200 a share, but Warren had already unloaded.\n\nBen: This is like me and Bitcoin in 2015.\n\nDavid: This is exactly like 10-year-old Warren. Ben, if only youâd learn these lessons at age 10.\n\nBen: Blew it.\n\nDavid: The incident makes an impression on him. He says he learned three lessons from this. I think he actually only learned one, but the first that he says he learns is donât fixate on the price you paid for something; itâs irrelevant. The second is donât rush to grab a small profit. Stay focused on the big, long-term wins. The irony is he would violate rules one and two many, many, many times until he was about 40 years old (as we shall see). But the third lesson he does learn, which is that you canât control other peopleâs emotions around money. If youâre going to take money from anybody, you need to make sure, (1) that youâre not going to lose it.\n\nBen: And heâs talking about his sister here.\n\nDavid: Heâs talking about his sister, yeah. And (2) that you need to do something to manage their ability to affect you so that they donât freak out and cause you to do uneconomic things. Warren might have sold it $40 anyway but certainly that his sister was breathing down his neck to sell. It reminds me of early Sequoia days and Apple. Warren decides itâs best if the clients donât see how the sausage is made, so to speak.\n\nBen: Which would absolutely inform his perspective on some of the partnerships he would do in the near future where he would not tell people the stocks he was buying on their behalf. I remember reading those words and being like, what? This is a blind undisclosed pool that heâs running, but itâs so easy to see how these early experiences make him realize, yeah if you want to be the completely independent free thinker that you are doing your own fundamental analysis and not moved not only by the current price that things are trading at but the the emotions of your investors or the demands of your investors for their tax consideration or for whatever reason they want to withdraw funds, then you better figure out how to hold and manage money on your own terms.\n\nDavid: Totally. Meanwhile, shortly after the New York trip, Howardâs career takes another turn. Pearl Harbor happens and the US enters World War II. Howard is a staunch isolationist.\n\nBen: Define that for us, like xenophobic, anti-trade, antiâ¦\n\nDavid: Itâs unclear to me if he was xenophobic. He probably was. I wouldnât imagine he was the kind of person who love foreigners, but he was certainly very against America entering the war. He hated FDR and Roosevelt. He was a diehard Republican, as apparently were many people in Nebraska at the time, because he runs for Congress inspired by the US entry into World War IIâwhich you think is the worst thing that has ever happenedâand he wins. The family moves to Washington and Howard becomes a US congressman.\n\nWarren, though, hates it. He wants nothing to do with Washington. He loves Omaha, he wants to go back, so he campaigns his family to let him go live with the grandfather, with Ernest, back in Omaha. Warrenâs like, this going to be great, me and gramps are going to become industrialists, were going to be partners, buddy buddy, weâre going to like the Rockefellers and the Morgans, this is going to be great.\n\nHe moves back, lives with his grandfather, and Ernest puts him to work in the store as a stock boy. Warren like, wait a minute. I thought we were partners here.\n\nBen: Yeah. I like the business youâre running. I donât so much like the work that I have to do inside of it.\n\nDavid: Yup, so manual labor, stocking the shelves, extremely low pay. Warrenâs like, this sucks. I had to get out of here.\n\nBen: Did you read too that his grandpa was withholding a penny or two each day to simulate social security? To show Warren what it was like to have to pay different levels of taxes?\n\nDavid: So great. Ironically, somebody else would feel the exact same way about working for Ernest Buffet a few years earlier, though they would not intersect; one Charles Thomas Munger.\n\nBen: So crazy. How nuts is it that Charlie Munger worked for Warrenâs grandfather in the same job that Warren did a few years later, and they never met until their thirties? Something like that.\n\nDavid: Yeah, until 1959. They never met.\n\nBen: Wild.\n\nDavid: Crazy. After this summer that Warren thought would be his future industrialist summer, heâs like take me to Washington. I got to get out of here, get out of the store. He goes with the family to DC where he devises a new way for making money to earn his fortune. He gets a paper route delivering The Washington Post.\n\nBen: Amazing. Beautiful foreshadowing when he can profess that, I rose all the way from paperboy to chairman, albeit with some leaving, the coming back, and between. Itâs an amazing journey.\n\nDavid: An amazing journey, and he would later become the chairman of The Washington Post and partner to Kay Graham. Was Warren the chairman? I think he was the chairman and Kay was the CEO.\n\nBen: I think thatâs right. He got a board seat commensurate with his investment. I think she gave him the chairman role because she had so much respect for his counsel.\n\nDavid: Weâll hear more about that in part two to come. Heâs got this paper route now. Remember, he was selling gum and soda door-to-door back in Omaha. Itâs like, this is great. Now Iâve got literally my foot in the door to all of the housewives in Washington, DC. I deliver them the paper but I can sell them magazine subscriptions. I can sell them calendars. I could sell them all sorts of stuff. He starts an empire in the streets of the suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\nBen: And heâs doing crazy stuff. Heâs ripping off the labels on subscriptions that I think people have put out to throw away. He was basically understanding when subscriptions would expire so he knew who to go sell what subscriptions to at what time. Itâs a brilliant strategy.\n\nDavid: Warren loves digging in the dirt for stuff. By the time he is in high school in Washington, heâs earning $175 bucks a month, which is more than what his high school teachers are making, and almost as much as the average US workerâs salary at that point in time, and Warrenâs in high school. Totally crazy. Heâs not spending any of it, of course. Heâs amassed over $2000 in savings, which is the equivalent of $40,000â$50,000 today? How many highschoolers do you know that have amassed self-made almost a full Bitcoin in savings?\n\nBen: And how many highschoolers do you know that firmly understand what the value of that is compounded 7% every year for another 80 years? You know that Warren is looking at that stack imagining its future potential.\n\nDavid: Totally. Now, heâs got some real, actual capital to invest. What does he do? Heâs still buying individual stocks, still playing the stock market, but he really wants to be like this industrialist businessman. He decides heâs going to buy an actual business; heâs 15 years old.\n\nHe buys a tenant farm in Nebraska back home for $1200. He buys an active farm with a tenant on it that is working the farm because Warrenâs not going to work the farm, no way. The deal with the tenant farmer is the tenant farms the land and the profits from the crops get split 50/50 between the tenant and the owner of the farm.\n\nBen: Half the returns to capital, half the returns to labor.\n\nDavid: Yup.\n\nBen: And, of course, the tenant also gets to live there in addition to getting half the profits, right?\n\nDaid: Indeed.\n\nBen: Warrenâs first yielding asset.\n\nDavid: Itâs his first cash flow business. Warren graduates high school in 1947 at age 16. I donât know, he might have skipped a grade or maybe he was just young?\n\nBen: It certainly sounded that way.\n\nDavid: And he goes to the University of Pennsylvaniaâs Wharton Business School, which has probably now I still think of it as, you want to be an undergrad business major in the US or anywhere in the world? Wharton is the place to go. But it is really his dad who makes him go. He doesnât want to go to school at all. Heâs like, I already know all this stuff. I just want to get to work.\n\nBen: And he wants to stay in Nebraska. He doesnât like going east. Itâs never been a great experience for him. Heâs only comfortable doing it because heâs like, my dadâs in Washington, so I have some family close, Iâll do it.\n\nDavid: He does it. He doesnât study, he aces all the tests, itâs sort of ridiculous. After two years, his dad loses his congressional seat and the family moves back to Nebraska. Warren uses this excuse to say, why donât I transfer to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln? Be back closer to home. He also has something else in mind. He knows if he goes to Nebraska he can take a lot more courses, accelerate and graduate in three years, and just get out of there.\n\nBen: I donât think he was loving the social scene of college. He wasnât a drinker, he wasnât going on lots of dates, he had his eye on the prize. For him that was making money and he frankly thought he was smarter than all of his college professors at Wharton.\n\nDavid: And he probably was. With Warren Buffett, heâs not wrong.\n\nDavid: He was probably pretty obnoxious about it. At Lincoln, he goes to the Lincoln Journal newspaper and he gets a job managing the country circulation, which means he now has 50 paperboys reporting to him all across the countryside in Nebraska. Thatâs his side hustle. He loads up on courses, he finished his degree a year early.\n\nHeâs 19 now, heâs just graduated college. Heâs ready to start his business career for real. But unlike when he went to undergrad, he actually does see some value in some further education. He decides there is a graduate school that he wants to go to that would actually be worth it, and that is to go to the prestigious Harvard Business School.\n\nHeâs so sure heâs going to get in. Heâs like, look, I bought my first business at age 15. I met Sidney Weinberg when I was 10. Thereâs no doubt Iâm going to get in. He writes his application, itâs all about being an investor. He goes to his interview, heâs sure heâs going to get in, and he gets rejected.\n\nBen: Which Harvard Business School would forever be regretting.\n\nDavid: Totally. Now, I donât know exactly what Harvard Business School was looking for in 1947 at the time, but I think either knownst or unbeknownst to Warren, I donât think he cared either way. I think this idea of being an investor was sort of dÃ©classÃ© because people were still hungover from the depression and it was wartime. I think what he wanted to do is he wanted to be like Mad men. He wanted to work for a big firm, he wanted to climb the ladder, he wanted the stability. This idea of being an investor and on your own was not what was proper at the time.\n\nBen: And Ben Graham is only really starting to publish The Intelligent Investor. This notion of how to analytically and from fundamentals do investing was still very much looked at as investing equals casino. Weâre still not quite in the era of that being respected, and frankly most people that are doing it are pretty much hucksters, are looking to just to make their commissions on the trades.\n\nDavid: And the people who are not, who are good and professionals, and fantastic at their craft (at this point time), most of them are Jewish. I assume there are probably some Jews at Harvard Business School but not a lot. And itâs kind of viewed as a Jewish profession. This is going to come up in a big way in a minute.\n\nBen: The anti-semitism that was running rampant at the time kind of help things.\n\nDavid: Totally. Sidney Weinberg, Jewish. Goldman Sachs, a Jewish firm. They were outsiders; they were not the establishment.\n\nWarren is shocked by his rejection from HBS. He starts looking at the course catalogs for other business schools just to like, oh man what am I going to do? He happens to see in the Columbia Graduate School of Business course catalog that there is a course taught by his heroes, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. Heâs like, holy crap. He would joke laterâI assume this is a jokeâhe said he write a letter to them to plead his case to get into Columbia saying, I thought you guys were dead. I didnât realize youâre alive and teaching classes.\n\nBen: Because he had just picked up their book. The Intelligent Investor, I think is the one he probably read and was like, this is incredible.\n\nDavid: Grahamâs book, The Intelligent Investor, had just come out and Warren was obsessed with it. Now, Graham and Dodd together had written and published Security Analysis back in 1934, but that was a textbook. That was an academic. I havenât read it but itâs super thick, dense. Itâs not meant to be readable. The Intelligent Investor is like Danny Kahnemanâs Thinking, Fast and Slow version of case studies, distilled down for public consumption.\n\nBen: And for listeners out there who have read The Intelligent Investor, youâre probably thinking, wait, that was supposed to be the not dense one?\n\nDavid: Different era. Warren read The Intelligent Investor. He loves it. Heâs like, this is amazing. What The Intelligent Investor and Security Analysisâeven more dry way before itâwhat they did was they espouse, hey you should think about investing in stocks systematically, based on the fundamentals of the companies that they represent, and as pieces of a business not like tickets on horse race betting here.\n\nBen: And they basically introduced the idea of the discounted cash flow. This is the first notion that stocks are the market cap of the company, is a representative of the sum of all future positive cash flows (or I guess all cash flows), discounted at a certain rate back to today. This sort of forcing you to look and say, does the price of the stock today reconcile with what you actually believe the business will yield or produce in its full lifetime? That was frankly novel.\n\nDavid: It was. Dodd is the chair of the finance department at Columbia. But Graham is an adjunct. Heâs a practitioner. Warren is just so gaga here because not only is he a professor, apparently, when he wrote this book, Graham runs essentially the first hedge fund in the world. He runs the Graham-Newman Partnership with Jerry Newman. They are a partnership that invest in stocks on Wall Street. Thereâs nothing Warren wants to do more than be like these guys.\n\nBen: I can literally go take a class from a guy who is actively employing a real investment strategy on Wall Street. Mind blown.\n\nDavid: Totally. The deadline for Columbia has passed by the time he gets to figure this out. He writes a letter to Dodd and Graham, and heâs basically just begging them to let him in. Well, lo and behold, guess who at the time was chairing the admissions committee at Columbia Business School? It was Dodd. Dodd gets this and reads it. Heâs like, all right. Iâm just going to unilaterally let this kid come in. No interview, no discussion, no formal application. They just send Warren in and like, all right youâre in. Youâre starting in the fall.\n\nBen: Because this is like, hey we basically see ourselves in you. No one is writing us about this thing that weâre doing, and here you are crazy excited about this super dry, relatively unrespected thing that weâre doing in the world. Yes, come join us.\n\nDavid: Come join us. The fall of 1950, Warren arrives in New York City. At this point, heâs compounded his net worth up to $10,000, which is a lot of money, 5X of what it was in high school 5 years earlier. But he still canât stand apart with any of his money. Rather than staying in the dorms at Columbia or renting an apartment, he rents a room at the YMCA for $1 a day.\n\nBen: This guy is truly cursed with having a firm grasp of the future value of his money compounded in the way that he feels he can get a return on it. We can talk all we want about the virtue of compounding and the eighth wonder of the world. Frankly, I feel like I have a new understanding for it based on doing all this research. Itâs only now that Iâm feeling the heft of what if I just put $1000 in an index fund and accessed it 50â70 years from now? Youâre like, oh my god, it turns into a real big amount of money, almost no matter what.\n\nItâs like you wonât notice, but when youâre Warren and youâve actually done all these calculations, and all youâre thinking about all the time with a singular focus is the future compounded value of this money, how could you ever spend a dime? It truly is cursing to your lifestyle.\n\nDavid: Yeah, Alice writes about that. Every time he looked at spending money, he would not see the sticker price for things. He would see it times 8, 10, or 20 of what that money would be worth in the future.\n\nBen: And just to come back and say it so we all have a firm understanding here, if you took that $1000 and you want to invest it for 70 years, say getting at 10% per year return on itâwhich would be good, that would be a very good return, I think itâs a little bit outpacing public marketsâthatâs $800,000 70 years from now. Seventy years from now, my money has a lot less utility to me than it does today because I will have not had it my whole life, which is the curse, but if youâre Warren and all youâre seeing all the time is that money in the future, my gosh.\n\nDavid: I think thatâs the difference between Warren and most normal people, too, is that money in the future probably has about the same utility to him because itâs not about what he can buy with the money. Itâs just about the stack of money.\n\nBen: Yup. For Warren it is a score board game, not a utility of the cash game.\n\nDavid: Totally. Okay, so he shows up at Columbia in the fall of 1950, signs up right away for Ben Grahamâs seminar, which is in the spring semester. Heâs already read The Intelligent Investor cover-to-cover, he's wearing out the pages so many times; he knows everything. But he's such a go-getter for this. He really wants to impress Graham in the seminar in the spring.\n\nI guess Moody's and S&P put out stock manuals at that time, that was the main thing that people like Warren, Ben Graham, Newman, and everybody browse through looking for stocks. He sees that the Graham-Newman Partnership owns 55% and Graham is on the board of this little company in Washington, called the Government Employees Insurance Company. Interesting. Sounds familiar?\n\nBen: I mean, if Ben Graham's the chairman, surely Warren wants to know more.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Well, certainly he wants to know more, but the Government Employees Insurance Company isn't mentioned anywhere in the Intelligent Investor. The rest of the Intelligent Investor is full of case studies and talking about different stocks, but they don't talk about this company there. Why is that? Warren decides, I want to go investigate. I'm going to find out more about this company, this GEICO, if you will, for short. I'm going to go pay them a visit.\n\nHe hops on the train from Penn Station, goes down to Washington on a Saturday morning. He just shows up at the office and he knocks on the door. He persuades a security guard at GEICO to see if anyone's around who could talk to him. Warren presumptuously at this time, although I guess he was signed up for the seminar and says that he's a student of Ben Graham's and Ben Graham is the chairman of the board. You might want to let me in. Somebody talk to me.\n\nEventually, the company's head of finance, Lorimer Davidson, is there that Saturday morning and he was like, all right kid, come on in my office. He figures, I'm going to do a Good Samaritan deed, give this kid 10 minutes of my time here. Well, it turns out that Lorimer (or Davey, as everyone called him) wasn't just a finance dude at GEICOânot that there's anything wrong with being a finance dude; I guess he was a finance dude in a certain respect. He had been an investor and a bond salesman before joining GEICO. He was a lot more like Ben Graham than just an employee at GEICO.\n\nThe story of GEICO, the founders had thought that they could make auto insurance cheaper by having commercials by selling the auto insurance direct to customers without using agents. To be as cheap as possible and have the best underwriting profile as possible, they also needed very responsible drivers. They borrowed an idea from USAA, which targeted military families for insurance. They target government employees for insurance, hence the Government Employees Insurance Company.\n\nBen: It's also amazing that their hunch that government employees are going to be less prone to accidents than the general public was right, that they could actually underwrite to, we can give these people cheaper premiums because they're going to be less expensive to us. That worked out for them.\n\nDavid: I mean, I guess seemed like a reasonable assumption, that if you work for the government, you're maybe more conservative, less likely to drive under the influence of alcohol or who knows. Either way it worked. One of the two founders, after a bunch of years, wanted to sell, the family wanted to sell their stake and hired Davey to help find a buyer. Davey brings it to Graham, which is how Graham at the company ends up negotiating a deal to buy at a discount to the asking price, of course.\n\nBen: Because it was fully privately owned. It was not a public company.\n\nDavid: He buys up the 55% stake the family owned for a million dollars, and then he turns around and puts Lorimer in charge of managing GEICO's own investments. Warren happened on the motherlode beating this guy. He's a Graham disciple. He runs all the investments at GEICO. Warren just starts peppering him with questions. Lorimer is super impressed. He's like, who is this 19 year old kid? They talked for four hours that Saturday morning. Davey tells Warren all about how GEICO works, how the insurance industry works, tells him about this magical thing called float. Warren has seen the revelation of, God has handed down the 10 commandments on the mountain.\n\nBen: You mean you have other people's money that they're loaning you for free that you can do stuff with until you need it?\n\nDavid: Amd you may not even ever need it?\n\nBen: Well, that's an interesting idea.\n\nDavid: Yeah. What is this float idea, and how does GEICO and all insurance companies work? The premiums that the customers pay GEICO for their auto insurance, that cash comes in the door on day one. GEICOâs expenses, they have to pay out claims on insurance claims later. You pay the policy premiums up front, but then when there are accidents and stuff, and then they go through court and blah-blah-blah, it could take years before you have to actually pay out any money, if you pay out any money at all.\n\nBen: Right. Yeah. Supposing you have a good government employee that never wrecks their car, you might just make money.\n\nDavid: You might just make a lot of money to sit on and you never have to pay it up. If you manage it well, you can make investments with it. That's what Lorimer is doing at GEICO. He's using all this float to make investments. He's doing a pretty damn good job of it.\n\nBen: There's two things that Warren realizes this, that I never fully put together before about insurance premiums. The first is, this is a loan that someone is making you at 0% interest. You're like, well, that's a pretty good loan. I don't have to service the debt. That means that I basically can make more profits, because I don't have to take a cut of my profits every month to pay down the debt. Awesome. It's an interest-free debt.\n\nThe second amazing thing is, it's not one person that loaned me money. It's a gigantic set of thousands, or tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of people that are paying me money. Well, then what that means is they're predictable because that's not just somebody wakes up on the wrong side of the bed and says that they want their money back. The worst thing that can happen, save for some hurricanes to foreshadow the future a little bit is that, one person wrecks their car and maybe another person's car, but nobody's wrecking all my customersâ cars at the same time. That's the second thing that's amazing.\n\nThe third thing that's amazing, is it's not a collateralized loan. You don't have to have something in your business that warrants you being able to take on this big debt load. Itâs just a big uncollateralized, interest-free distributed loan to you that you get to do something with until you need to pay it out.\n\nDavid: Especially back then, there was much less regulation about capital requirements for insurance companies, and well, all financial institutions. They really didn't have to keep any cash reserves. I mean, they could do whatever they wanted with the money.\n\nBen: Speaking of doing whatever they want with the money, I think what was happening back then is that, as you would imagine in the early days of insurance, you would want your premiums to basically equal the amount of money that you would need to pay out in the future. What happens now is, it's assumed that you can do interesting things to earn money on the float. I didn't know this until doing the research. When you pay for your car insurance, they're actually collecting less in premiums than in total they will owe out to everyone, so you need to do something interesting with the float in order to make it so that the insurance company doesn't go under. I never realized that. I suppose that probably happens with competition where everybody's just lowering and lowering their premiums until they realize, gosh, we effectively can sell our insurance below cost because we can invest the float.\n\nDavid: Yup, and GEICO's got the additional advantage which it still has to this day of, they don't employ agents. They just have a fundamentally better cost structure than all of their competitors, which means more money they get to play with.\n\nBen: I bet if you call these guys by going direct, they can save you some money in 15 minutes or less on your car insurance.\n\nDavid: How much money do you think they could save you, like 15%?\n\nBen: I would imagine. I can't imagine what the cost of customer acquisition is through an agent but it seems like they could at least rebate that to you. One final flash-forward here before we go back to the story. Everyone should go to berkshirehathaway.com, one to bask in the full glory of this beautiful website. Secondly, please observe that there is a banner to purchase GEICO Insurance on the Berkshire website. It is the one thing that they do on that website other than a series of blue links to shareholder documents. It is an ad for GEICO. It's the most hilarious use of web real estate ever.\n\nDavid: Hey, we have our car insurance with GEICO. It's cheap. It's great. All right, enough of this. The next Monday, Warren goes back to New York City and immediately liquidates 75% of his portfolio and loads up on GEICO, 75% concentrated in GEICO. He's in love. He thinks I'm going to show up at Graham's seminar. I will tell him about this. He's just going to go gaga, this is amazing. I'm going to be his boy. It's going to be like his dreams of Ernest back in the day. Well, he shows up at the seminar and he tells Graham what he's done. Graham is not that impressed. He's like, you put 75% of your portfolio into GEICO? What are you, nuts?\n\nBen: Yeah, because Graham, first of all, is not a one stock guy. He's a distributed portfolio approach guy. Second of all, I'm sure his next question was, yeah, what did you pay for it?\n\nDavid: What did you pay for it? GEICO was not a typical investment for the Graham-Newman Partnership. They probably only did it because he was able to whittle a deal out of Lorimer and the family. There's a reason why it wasn't in the Intelligent Investor. Graham's whole strategy, his whole mantra, basically, he and Dodd invented discounted cash flow evaluation, fundamental analysis, all that, and what comes to be known as value investing.\n\nBut there's a major problem with what they're doing, which, honestly, this conflation that Graham had between fundamentals and value investing persists to this day. It is still why there are religious wars about value versus growth investing. He thought there was a very specific way to practice fundamental investing, what he and others called cigar butt investing\n\nWhat does he mean by cigar butts? This is crude, but the analogy is that, you could be walking along the street in those days in New York, and you might see smoked cigar butts laying on the street, in the gutter, and some of them might still have a little bit of cigar on it. You could pick it up for free, not pay anything for the cigar, light it up, and maybe still be able to get a puff or two out of these cigar butts for free.\n\nThe reason why this analogy is used is that Graham's whole thing that he looked for in companies of stocks that he bought was, he wanted companies that were âworth more dead than alive.â He actually writes an article by this name. What this meant was, he looked for companies where the book value of the assets, the cash on hand, the value of their land, property, buildings, thereâ\n\nBen: If you shut the company down today, stop taking money from customers, paid out all your liabilities...\n\nDavid: Stop the business, and you just sell off in a fire sale everything in the building, would you make more money from what you're selling off than what the market cap of the company is trading? That was what he looked for.\n\nBen: Which in that era, you could find those because he didn't have tons and tons of people whose eyes were always on the stocks, trying to figure out is anything trading below the book value that it should be trading below? You could find them pretty often.\n\nDavid: Not only there were far fewer people participating in the market and far less data available, but the people who were participating were mostly handicapping horse races. They weren't thinking like this. Stocks that weren't hot, there were a lot of them out there. Graham had three big insights, he and Dodd that revolutionized investing. One was this concept that a stock is a piece of a business with cash flow profiles and going concerns and you should value it as such. Two, was that price and value are two very different things. The price of a stock at any given day, may or may not reflect the actual value.\n\nBen: Price is what you pay and value is what you get.\n\nDavid: Exactly. You can use this to your advantage here, this concept of Mr. Market. Mr. Market comes to you every day and quotes prices for what you own and what you're contemplating owning. But he's schizophrenic, and one day I'll quote high, one day I'll quote low, but the value stays the same.\n\nBen: Right. It is the notion that he's your business partner in the venture, and every single day he comes to you offering to buy out your stake at a price that is either too high or too low, almost never exactly reflecting the actual intrinsic value. Every single day, you have the option to decide to sell or buy more.\n\nDavid: Yup, very true. Points one and two, great, I totally agree with. Point three, I also agree with but I disagree with the interpretation. That's this concept of a margin of safety, the famous Ben Graham, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger margin of safety.\n\nBen: Of course, the way that Graham wanted to apply that is buy companies that are so cheap, they are literally free of risk.\n\nDavid: Yup. It makes sense. Investing involves risk as every disclaimer in history has told you and involves uncertainty, you don't know what's going to happen. Ideally, you want enough downside protection built in, that you'll do okay, no matter what. That makes sense, and you do want that. But Graham's way of looking at this, as we said, was I'm only going to buy things if we literally shut down the business and sold off everything on hand. We would get our money back or more.\n\nThere are two problems with that, both on the downside and on the upside. On the downside, as we shall see, sometimes the liquidation value of the assets of a corporation aren't worth as much as you think they are. You can try to sell off the property plant and equipment, but if there are no buyers, or no buyers at the price that you want, well, just because it says it's worth something on the books doesn't mean it's actually worth that. That's one problem.\n\nThe bigger problem, though, is that this is the ultimate small ball way of making money. Your upside is so fundamentally capped when this is how you're looking at the world. You could go to a hundred of these cigar butts or you could buy one GEICO and just hold it for 20 years, and make way more money.\n\nBen: Yeah, it's fascinating. The way that I have been thinking about this, I think the closest analogue is basically to gross margin in an operating business, where if you're running a tech business with super high gross margin and high fixed costs, you got to spend on the fixed costs, but then you get that gross margin forever without having to change what business you're in. If you're in the business of selling lattes, then every single time you need to go and pull a new espresso.\n\nDavid: This is the stock equivalent of that analogy.\n\nBen: Yeah. He's in a high velocity business of constantly needing to go and buy a new security, sell it for more than it's worth, go buy another one, sell it for more than it's worth. His notion is never count on making a good sale, have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results. But you're going to incur transaction costs every time, you're going to need to pay taxes every time, you're going to have to do the work of actually identifying what you want to buy and sell every time. It's a high COGS business.\n\nDavid: Yup, and it takes a long time. Sadly, tragically, by the next year, Warren has succumbed to Graham's exhortations here. Warren sells all of his GEICO stock in 1950 to early 1952 for $15,259. He makes over a 50% IRR on it, which is amazing. But if he just held on to the damn thing, he would have made hundreds of times more of his money.\n\nBen: Of course, the Graham way to analyse that business is like, hey, it's actuallyâ\n\nDavid: Now trading at a high price.\n\nBen: Right. Its price is at or above its value, so it's time to get out. It's so interesting. I just want to take a step back for a second here and just reflect on that for a minute because this whole growth versus value thing, if you think about value in this narrowly defined concept of like, let's just keep using the cigar butt analogy, you pick up the cigar butt, you smoke it and it's done, and now you throw it away. There's all the work we talked about of identifying the cigar butt, the transaction cost of picking it up, of puffing it, of paying the tax on your gain of the puff and then discarding it, and having to go through that whole process again.\n\nThe whole notion of growth investing is, wouldn't it be nice if that cigar actually got larger and larger and larger faster than you could smoke it? Not only do you have to not incur all those transaction costs there, but if you're willing to take some risk and be smart about analyzing what risks you're going to take, the value of the business could even grow faster than the way that it's being priced in the market. That's this completely novel concept that exists outside the universe of what Ben Graham was willing to consider an investment.\n\nDavid: Totally. Now, to be fair to Graham, we know he was doing all this through the depression. If you live 25 years, and the stock market is flat to down for 25 years, of course, you're going to think this way.\n\nBen: Yeah. Of course, we are all a product of our environment, and I think one of the phrases that is a Buffett-ism that applies to this is we've talked about the market weighing machine. If you think about a weighing machine, then it effectively equates value to price. Whatever you are spending is what it's worth. Or is it a voting machine where people are setting price and voting on the price, independent of the weight or the value of the actual underlying security? This is where the realization comes in that in the long run it is a weighing machine, but in the short run, it's a voting machine, the stock market.\n\nDavid: Totally. Sometimes the short run lasts longer than you would think.\n\nBen: Yup.\n\nDavid: All that said, cigar butt investing was still a sound strategy in the 1950s. You're in the land of the blind, the one-eyed person is king or queen or whatever. The Graham approach works and Warren is just lapping it up. He takes the seminar. Warren becomes the first and only student to ever receive an A+, in the class from Graham. Side note, also in that same class with Warren is one Bill Ruane, who was a stockbroker at that time at Kidder Peabody, and was auditing the class. He realizes this Buffett guy is going places. I'm going to become friends with him. That would pay off handsomely as we will see at the end of the episode.\n\nAfter graduation, Warren wants more Graham. He can't get enough. He goes to Ben and Jerry Newman and says, hey, can I get a job at Graham-Newman? Can I work for you guys? It was a pretty small place. I think there were only six or seven people working there. They talked about it and Graham, though, turns him down and says, I'd love to hire you, you're the best student I've ever had, but Jerry and I have a pretty strict policy here, and that is that we only hire Jews. He would later recant on this and would hire Buffett in a couple of years. But it makes sense, Graham was British, I think.\n\nBen: This is effectively an affirmative action type comment, where he's saying, we want to make an opportunity here for those who have been persecuted and discriminated against.\n\nDavid: Exactly, and this is 1952. World War II ended four years ago, and Graham was, I believe, British-European. He was born in Europe. It's a small firm, but they're like, hey, we're pretty committed to giving Jews an opportunity here. Warren is heartbroken, but not deterred. He goes back home to Omaha, decides, okay, well, if I can't join the Graham-Newman Partnership, I'm just going to set up my own partnership. I'm going to do it myself.\n\nBoth Graham and HowardâWarren's dadâtalked him out of it. They both say hey, you need some experience first working for someone else before you go and do your own thing. The natural thing to do is, why don't you go work for your dad's old brokerage firm, Buffett-Falk. Warren does, and he becomes the dreaded prescriptionist working for his dad, and he just hates it. He's getting paid on commission, selling stocks.\n\nBen: The whole idea of, there's a roomful of people who are tasked with moving a stock and calling all their customers to say you should buy this thing. It's about the most anti-Warren Buffett thing I can possibly imagine.\n\nDavid: Totally. It's like organ rejection. He's making his calls, he's doing what he has to do. He's trying to move the product, but he gets on the phone with people. He'll do whatever heâs asked to, but then he's like, hey, but there's this company called GEICO. They are an agentless insurance company, you should really consider buying that as well. People think he's nuts. An insurance company that doesn't have agents. I want to talk to my agent, that's weird. He doesn't have a lot of success.\n\nBen: D2C baby. They got this great website.\n\nDavid: Yeah. There are two good things, though, that come out of his two-year interlude.\n\nBen: Actually, I am curious. How did GEICO work back then? Is it by mail? Is it by phone? Presumably the whole thing's done by phone.\n\nDavid: That's actually a good question. I assume phone. There might have been some tie-in with the government agencies that, maybe there was marketing that went out to agency employees. I don't know exactly.\n\nBen: All right. We'll have to do a spin-out GEICO episode at some point.\n\nDavid: Yeah, we will. Well, it'll come up again in part two. Don't worry. Warren gets another bite at the apple, so to speak. Two good things that come out of this little interlude back in Omaha. One, he reconnects with one Susie Thompson, whose father, Doc Thompson, was a dean at the University of Omaha and had managed Howard's political campaigns. Warren somehow persuaded Susie to marry him, which was shocking given what Warren Buffett's personality and what he was like back then.\n\nTwo, he also after dutifully working for a while at the brokerage, persuades his dad to set up the first of the Warren Buffett Partnerships with him, called Buffett and Buffett. Basically, Warren puts some of his money in and his dad put some of the family's money in, and Warren just gets some more capital under management to invest here. It's his first taste of being a principal.\n\nBen: Yup, and just to add a little more color to that comment you made on what Buffett was like back then and got Susie to marry him, he was and is a person of singular focus in his life. He's in his old age and started to do more things, but he was never a socialite. He was never someone that was deeply diving into other people's interests and socializing to be social. He was a person that has always wanted to invest and make money. Of course, he did set his eyes on, hey, I want to marry Susie and I'm going to make that happen.\n\nDavid: Well, they're all these stories about family dinners. Even they'd have friends over, Warren would just wander off upstairs and start go reading annual reports in the middle of a dinner party. He's a wild man. All he did was invest in stocks. However, the flip side of these personality quirks of Warren are he is very singularly focused and he's very persistent. Despite the rejection from Graham-Newman, Warren continues to write letters to Ben and Jerry, constantly talking about his ideas, talking about stocks heâs looking at. He travels to New York frequently just to go see them and drop in.\n\nAfter two years of this, Jerry finally sits down with Ben and he's like, we've got this anti-Semitism rule here, but maybe we should make an exception and hire this kid. He's pretty special. Ben relents. He calls up Warren. He's like, all right, you really want to come work here? Fine, we can make it happen. You don't need to ask Warren twice, he accepts on the spot.\n\nI don't think he even talks to Susie about it, even though they have their daughter, little Susie at this point. They're living in Omaha. He just accepts on the spot, moves them back to New York at a moment's notice. He literally showed up at the Graham-Newman office a month before his initial start date. He's just like, yeah, you're not paying me this month, that's fine. I'm here, I'm working.\n\nBen: That's awesome.\n\nDavid: Once again, he doesn't want to pay New York City housing prices, so he moves the family into a crappy apartment in White Plains, even though he's pretty rich already from everything he's been doing, and he's now working at the most prestigious hedge fund in the world. He's paying, God knows how much, $50 a month for an apartment way outside the city.\n\nBen: That's crazy. Is it fair to call it a hedge fund? What differentiates a hedge fund versus an institutional money manager?\n\nDavid: That's a good question. I don't think really.\n\nBen: I don't think they're taking huge short positions or anything like that at this point in history.\n\nDavid: I don't think so. I think they would, sometimes short stocks. Warren would actually, famouslyâI wasn't going to put this in the scriptâwas a real pain in the ass in high school, arguably, a real pain in the ass for his whole life. In high school, he hated his teachers so much that he knew that they all had the teachers' pension mainly invested in AT&T stock. Warren went out and shorted AT&T stock, brought the slips in, and put them on his teacher's desk just to show them he's betting against their retirement funds.\n\nBen: Oh, and in high school, he was already seen as a savant, so that probably would freak people out. Like, what does he know that I don't?\n\nDavid: Yeah. He didn't really care about people's feelings, at least when he was in high school. At Graham-Newman, unsurprisingly, he just crushes it pretty quickly within another two years. Ben and Jerry are consulting him on everything that they do. Warren's coming up with most of the investing ideas that they're doing. He's involved in every decision that the firm makes, and he's really hitting his stride.\n\nSo much so that Ben isâwe're not going to get super into itâa very colorful character, shall we say, had three wives (I think), and then the story goes. I think he started up a relationship after his last marriage with the girlfriend ofâthis is at the end of his lifeâhis son after his son died. He's a character. He is ready to retire. He wants to move to California and live the good life. Newman is also getting old. Jerry's getting old, he's thinking about the same. They offer to make Warren a general partner at the firm and have him essentially continue Graham-Newman. I assumed they would stay as partner emeritus or something like that. But this time Warren shocks them. He's like, no.\n\nBen: Remember that whole, on my terms thing that I really care a lot about?\n\nDavid: Yup. He's like, I don't know. I don't want to run your firm. If I'm going to run a firm, I'm going to run my firm. I'm just here in New York to work with you guys. I don't actually like it in New York. Susie wants to be back in Omaha. I would do it in Omaha. They end up winding down the firm. Warren, Susie and little Susie, their daughter moved back to Omaha in 1956, this time for good.\n\nHere's the plan. Tell me how well you think this is going to work. Warren's net worth is about $175,000 at this point after working at Graham-Newman for two years.\n\nBen: It's that a few million dollars by today's?\n\nDavid: Yeah. The average yearly salary for a worker in the United States at that point is $4800, and he has $175,000 saved up in the bank account, and he's 26 years old. They have two kids now, Howie's been born. The plan is he's going to retire. He says, I made my fortune. Susie really wants me to be a father and all that, be involved at home, the small requests. All right, I think I can retire and if I set a budget that we can live on in Omaha, I'm going to enjoy the good life. This is so not Warren. He says, I think we'll set a budget of $12,000 a year. Remember the annual average income...\n\nBen: That's 3X.\n\nDavid: Yeah, close to 3X that he will be spending every year. We'll buy a nice house in Omaha, this is huge. We'll live like kings. Also the rest of the money, that'll be compounding. It'll grow, great. It'll all be fine.\n\nBen: How much does he have in the bank again?\n\nDavid: $175,000.\n\nBen: That's what, 6.8%, so that's probably about what he thinks he can generate passively by just leaving in an index fund, and so he's effectively...\n\nDavid: I'm sure he thinks he can generate more because he's still going to dabble a little. He's going to do a little bit of active management just on his own capital.\n\nBen: Why do I feel like this didn't happen? I don't remember this part of the book.\n\nDavid: No, this did not happen. Despite his retirement, he's hanging out with family and friends and stuff. They're talking to him, and all he could talk about is money. Eventually, some of these people are like, well, you want to manage my money? Warren's like, okay, twist my arm. I don't even know if he's [...].\n\nBen: I got some ideas.\n\nDavid: Yeah, I got some ideas. He started setting up these little vehicles around Omaha with family first, immediate family, and then a few close friends to manage their money in addition to his own money that he's managing. He structures these things actually. I really like the way he structures these. Remember, these are people he really cares about, in his own Warren way. He structures them as partnerships, where there's a 4% annual return hurdle. Any returns that he generates above 4%, he as the general partner in these partnerships, keeps half of the upside of those returns.\n\nBen: Half? I thought it was 25%.\n\nDavid: No, it's half, at least according to The Snowball. That's pretty huge. That's 50% carry effectively. But there's the 4% benchmark return.\n\nBen: If it underperforms 4%, then he gets no money? There's no fees, right? He's not paying himself a salary at all?\n\nDavid: There's no management fee. This is why I think it's actually pretty fair and I really like the structure. He personally puts himself on the hook for a quarter of the downside. Any money lost, I think between 0% and 4% return, it's a neutral zone where nothing happens. I think if there's any capital lost, he will personally cover 25% of the losses of his partners, which are pretty good incentives.\n\nBen: Yeah, he's so good at incentive alignment.\n\nTotally. Totally, and he hadn't even met Charlie yet. He's finally living the dream. He's fully independent. He doesn't work for anyone else. He has a partnership like Graham-Newman, but it's all part time. He has no employees. They're all separate partnerships. It's all friends and family. It's a little over $100,000 total in outside money, so not that much money. He does everything himself, the investing, the accounting, he files all the taxes himself for the partnerships. He has no employees, no outside services. His total expenses for doing all of this in 1956, you ready for this, Ben?\n\nBen: Lay it on me.\n\nDavid: Amount to $22.71.\n\nBen: That's our accounting at Acquired where all the labor is free?\n\nDavid: Yeah, totally. That's between all of the gains that he generates and taking in some more money. By the end of the year, he's managing over half a million dollars for less than $23 in cost. That's pretty good fee load on that. Word starts going around Omaha that like, hey, Warren's back in town.\n\nBen: Wait, let me understand real quick here. This 25% of the downside, is that GP commit where he was putting his own money in and that money was just at risk, or was he sort of like, additionally on top of that, saying, I will reimburse you for 25% losses?\n\nDavid: Reimbursed. At first, I thought this was weird, but then I understood it later. He does not really put in any of his own money. He only puts in $100 into each partnership. He's keeping his own money separate, which at first I was like, well, that's weird. But I think he did that because these are friends and family. The goal is to make returns for friends and family. He's essentially making the same investments separately with his own pool of capital. Later, when he consolidates it all, he puts in all of his family's money as well. I don't think he really thought of it as a fee-generating scheme.\n\nBen: Right. It's just that each one of these is the pool of capital for my friends.\n\nDavid: Yup. Word starts going around Omaha that Warren's back in town. He's taken on money if you want to invest with him. He can't help himself. He's loving this. He's going around town, he's meeting with everybody. He can't stop pitching. He's raising money for his retirement activities.\n\nOne family he gets introduced to is the Davis family in Omaha, the husband of which is a prominent doctor in town. They decided to invest $100,000, in this venture, after discussing amongst the family while Warren is there. Saying, Warren, you really remind us of a really bright, young man who actually grew up next door to us, now lives out in Los Angeles. You guys are the spitting image of one another. He's a really bright guy. We remember he was the smartest kid we ever knew. He's left Omaha now. He lives out in Los Angeles. We have to introduce you when he's back in town some time. Charlie Munger is his name. More on that to come in the next episode.\n\nBen: But it was a while. The seed was planted, but they wouldn't meet for years.\n\nDavid: That was in 1956 and the dinner that the Davis' would organize would not happen until 1959. Yeah, three more years before Warren and Charlie would meet. This all goes pretty well.\n\nBen: Do you know the one other term that he asked of the Davis', and then he would ask for everyone else going forward after that?\n\nDavid: No.\n\nBen: This gets to his desire for doing business his way and not having other people influence when he does distributions or anything like that. He is open for business one day of the year to his clients, and that day is December 31st. On that day, they can either take money out or put money in, but other than that, it is managed by Warren and secret. He does not have to disclose what he is buying or selling it, nor can they take money out.\n\nDavid: Interesting. He obviously didn't disclose what the holdings of the partnerships were, but I didn't know that it was only that one day that you could take money in or out. Interesting. This goes pretty well.\n\nPretty quickly, Warren's rounded up nearly a million dollars across seven different partnerships. After the first year or so of running this, his intention with this effectively carried interest that he sets up the half, 50% of the profits above the 4% benchmark threshold. He wants to essentially grow his equity ownership of these pools. He's not going to take that money out in cash.\n\nBen: Of course, he's not. There are transaction costs, there are taxes. Heâs Warren Buffett.\n\nDavid: He's Warren Buffett. He does so well within the first year or so that his fees are, on paper, $83,000, which is almost half of what his net worth was when he started this thing. Due to that, he owns 9.5% of the combined partnership, starting from essentially zero. His $100 that he put in, he now owns almost 10% of these pools.\n\nBen: That's, of course, because in that very first year, when the Dow finished the year down 8.5%, Buffett made 10.5% that year for his partners.\n\nDavid: Pretty good. He now has enough capital with the million dollars at his control that he can start to do the kinds of things that Graham-Newman used to do. We didn't really talk about this but there was another aspect to the cigar butt style of investing. It wasn't just that Ben and Jerry, and then Warren when he joined, would look for companies with book value above trading value. They would then amass big positions in those companies, trying to get themselves on the board, like Graham did with GEICO, although he didn't need to be agitated with GEICO. With the cigar butt companies, they would then agitate actively to get the companies to liquidate assets and distribute the cash out to shareholders.\n\nBen: It does sound like a hedge fund after all.\n\nDavid: Yeah, these guys are like Bobby Axelrod. They're corporate raiders. Now, with a million dollars at his disposal, Warren can start to do this. The first of the companies he does this with is a company called Sanborn Map. He puts 35% of the capital of the partnerships into it, gets control of the company, forces it to split itself in two, and makes a quick 50% profit on the spin off. He's shooting fish in a barrel; he can do this all day. By the end of 1960, total capital is up to $2 million, and Warren's share is worth a cool $250,000 or 13% of the partnership. In 1961â¦\n\nBen: Let me pause before you go into 1961. Just to recap a few of the returns here year over year. The second year, he made 41%. The third year, he made 26%. The fourth year, 1960, he made 23%. All while the Dow is having some good years, some bad years. It's losing money sometimes, it's making money sometimes. Warren hasn't lost a dollar. He's outperformed every single year, he stayed positive every year. In fact, the partnership results as a whole so far, if you compound over those four years, are 141% compared to the Dow's 43%. Whatever Warren is doing is working.\n\nDavid: Wow. I don't have the Dow numbers in 1961, so I don't know relatively how good this performance was.\n\nBen: The Dow numbers in 1961 are 22.4%. A pretty good year.\n\nDavid: Pretty good. Warren does 46% in 1961, which not only generates a bunch of returns, compounds the capital, the partners are like, please take more of our money. A bunch more money flows in. The partnerships are managing over $7 million in total, which is larger than Graham-Newman ever was.\n\nBen: Wow. Let me start quoting from some Buffett annual letters here because this is an interesting phenomena. He was a wonderful writer. He had trained himself both in public speaking, taking some classes in that, and in writing. He wrote these, as I'm sure many people would guess, some prolific shareholder letters to his partnership every year. That actually is not something that he did in the early Berkshire years. It took him years to start doing that again, but he really felt it was incumbent upon him to do this when he was running these investment partnerships.\n\nLet me just read from you a few of these. â1962: If my performance is poor, I expect the partners to withdraw. 1963: It is a certainty that we will have years when we deserve the tomatoes. 1964: I believe our margin over the Dow cannot be maintained. 1965: We do not consider it possible on an extended basis to maintain the 16.6% point advantage we had over the Dow.â This goes on and on where Warren continues to caution, I don't think this is sustainable. I don't think we can keep crushing it as hard as we are.\n\nDavid: Amd he does this to this day every year in the virtual letter. 60 years later, unreal. At this point in 1962, when he's now bigger than Graham-Newman ever was, he finally gets an office. He'd been working out of their spare bedroom, the Omaha house all these years doing everything himself. He gets an office, he hires a couple of people. He consolidates all these various vehicles into just one vehicle, the Buffett Partnership Limited. This is when he puts all of his own money in as well. He's got a single vehicle. I don't know if he ever said he officially unretired but...\n\nBen: He's in business.\n\nDavid: He's in business. He also codifies in these letters. He's sending out a few official âground rulesâ for the partnership, just like Don Valentine did back in Sequoia in the early days to their limited partners. There are few rules in there. The last one, like you were saying, Ben, hallmark of the Buffett style for years to come. âI cannot promise results to our partners. What I can and do promise is that: (a) our investments will be chosen on the basis of value not popularity, (b) we will attempt to bring risk of permanent capital loss, not short-term quotational loss to an absolute minimum by maintaining a wide margin of safety, and (c) my wife, children, and I have virtually our entire net worth invested in a partnership.â\n\nPretty good ground rules. By halfway through that year, 1962, when he consolidates everything, Warren is 31 years old, and his net worth crosses the million dollar mark. He's achieved his dream.\n\nBen: He made it.\n\nDavid: He made it four years early. The next year in 1963, Buffett finds the second great investment of his lifetime, and also the second great mistake that he would make on the back end of it, the first of course, being GEICO, American Express. This is great. Some listeners probably already know the story here.\n\nBen: Before we dive into the story, I think the framework that I would use if you're listening to this and hearing a lot of this for the first time, you heard about GEICO, you're hearing these puzzle pieces, where there's a lesson learned from each of these companies, that Buffett was the first to figure out that these businesses are each interesting in a puzzle piece way that fits in with other businesses, that in the sum of its whole could create this unbelievable capital-efficient flywheel.\n\nI don't know if flywheel's the right term. Puzzle pieces put together into a beautiful puzzle or mosaic might be the right term. But it really is him understanding all these unique types of businesses that have these characteristics that he can then use in the future. American Express, I feel is the second big lesson for him after he learns about the insurance business, the first one.\n\nDavid: I think you're totally right about the puzzle piece fitting together aspect. He learns that in his third great investment, which will be the last one we'll cover on this episode. That's coming up.\n\nBack to American Express. In 1963, Buffett is still under the Graham spell here. He's looking for cigar butts, that's what he's doing, looking for deals.\n\nBen: As Charlie Munger would later put it, he's looking for fair businesses at good prices.\n\nDavid: Great prices. Yeah, fair businesses at great prices.\n\nBen: Not great businesses at fair prices.\n\nDavid: Yup, exactly, which is the Charlie way of doing things that Buffett would later wisely adopt. AmEx is, at this point, still widely respected today. Back then, American Express is the most trusted financial services company in America. It had been around already for close to 100 years, the traveler's checks business. Many listeners are probably not familiar with traveler's checks, but was just an absolute juggernaut and an amazing business. The idea was if you were travelling, and this is beforeâ\n\nBen: I did this growing up.\n\nDavid: Yeah, me too. Even when I was in college, when I studied abroad, my parents got me AmEx traveler's checks. The idea was, you would go to your local American Express office, give them money, cash, they would in return give you traveler's checks, which were essentially a guaranteed paper for that amount of value backed by AmEx. Then you could take those checks anywhere where you traveled and if you lost them, you could go to AmEx. But more importantly, when you're traveling internationally, you could use this as a way to get funds in whatever the local currency was.\n\nBen: Right, because wherever you're traveling doesn't know about your hometown bank and may not even know about your home country bank, so this is the way to have your credit accepted everywhere.\n\nDavid: Right. There were no ATMs and credit cards are still early, early days, although AmEx was a pioneer there and had the American Express credit card. Anyway, it's this gilded institution.\n\nIn 1963, they have a small subsidiary of the company that operated warehouses and issued warehouse receipts. What does this mean? Itâs the equivalent of a traveler's check for warehouses. You would have warehouses full of a commodity, of something, say salad oil, in this case, soybean oil to be exact, and you would get AmEx to come in, inspect the warehouse and issue paper that says like, yes, there are XYZ tons of soybean oil in this warehouse. You could take that paper, and you could collateralize it, you could borrow against it, you could trade against it. You're essentially financializing this product. It was a pretty brilliant business that AmEx was in, but it was small, this was much smaller than their consumer business.\n\nAll this is great, until a pretty shady commodities trader named Anthony \"Tino\" De Angelis in New Jerseyâof all placesâdecides that he's going to pull one over on AmEx. He has his warehouses with them. He decides to fill his tanks, which were supposedly filled with soybean oil with seawater instead, defraud the inspectors, then collateralize it, borrow against it, and run a Ponzi scheme, essentially.\n\nBen: Didn't he try and bet with it? He then took it and made some risky investment with his check that said, hey, this is worth so many tons of salad oil, and then he ended up basically losing it all?\n\nDavid: Yeah, there was something that had to do with the futures market. You can't make this stuff up. It was something with Russia and the Soviet Union. Their soybean crop failed that year, and people thought they were going to have to buy US soybean oil, and then they didn't, so the price collapsed. Anyway, ridiculous stuff.\n\nBen: Anyway, suffice to say, he's now got a piece of paper that someone's coming and saying, okay, give me what that piece of paper's worth. Of course, not only does he not have it, but there's nothing in the warehouse to back it up either.\n\nDavid: The piece of paper is worth zero. All in, it comes to over $150 million worth of fraud that happened. Theoretically, AmEx is on the hook for this. Now, legally, it's debatable like Tino defrauded them. Whether they should actually be on the hook or not is debatable, but they're American Express. The CEO says, we're going to settle with the creditors, we're going to cover this. The scandal rocks AmExâs stock on Wall Street. The share price drops by over 50%. Analysts and people out there think the company's not going to survive.\n\nBuffett, though, thinks otherwise. He sees an opportunity. He and his new employees, they go around Omaha and New York and a bunch of other places. They just started interviewing consumers, talking to the banks, and saying, hey, what do you think of AmEx? Have you heard about the soybean oil scandal? The salad oil scandal? Are you still using the traveler's checks? Are you using the credit card? Consumers are like, I haven't heard of this.\n\nBen: Scandal? What are you talking about?\n\nDavid: Of course, I trust the traveler's checks. Buffett figures that AmEx can easily absorb all of these losses, even if they covered the whole thing, out of cash on hand. They have over $200 million of cash on hand, plus over $500 million of float from the traveler's checks business.\n\nBen. This is a similar lesson that he learns from GEICO, which is all of this debt that the company has, that they owe out to these people with traveler's checks, as long as there's not a scandal, they're not going to have a run on us. They're not going to come at us all at once. It's a portfolio distributed liability. As long as I do my diligence, I assume that consumer confidence hasn't been rocked, and there's not going to be a run on AmEx, then we're actually in good shape.\n\nDavid: He make"
