        "text": "Unfinished Memmoirs of a Hypcrit - Hesterglock Press (July 2019)\n\nPages 82 / £7.99\n\nAvailable to buy https://sjfowler.bigcartel.com/product/hypocrit\n\nI’m very happy to announce the launch of my 5th book in the Poem Brut series, the culmination of many years of work. From the publisher:\n\n“Memmoirs presents the handwritten and hand-drawn as a viable means of fiction - poetry - writing - art that emphasises context alongside content and challenges restrictive definitions. A book certainly as strange and unfortunately amusing as living mostly is, this is a dispatch from a prolific and future-facing writer attempting to operate on multiple fronts, and failing with aplomb.”\n\nVisit http://www.hesterglock.net/\n\nThe entire essay featured in the book, about it's methods and meanings, has been generously published by Tentacular Magazine to coincide with its release, and is available to read https://www.tentacularmag.com/elsewhere-blog/new-prim-and-proper\n\n“A considerable book of poetic inarticulation, swamping somewhere in between poetry, notation for future projects forever unrealised, forgetful scrawlings, childhood dream illustrations, erratic geometry, collage and quotation. UMOAH attempts to operate on multiple fronts, and fails, as is the history of such abundance conflict. It wishes to present the notebook as a finished poetry. It wishes to emphasise context over content, or at least blend and blind the two. It wishes to be as strange and unfortunately amusing as living mostly is. It wishes to be about where it was made (Spain, mostly) and what is was made from (a single notebook of bone coloured paper, a christmas gift, and some bad black pens, and some fingerpaint).”\n\n​\"Truly Fowler's magnum ice cream\"\n\n- Russell Bennetts : Berfrois\n\n\"Fowler builds a skull cinema across these brittle and bone-coloured pages worth well more than its advertised cost of entry\"\n\n- Dominic Jaeckle : Hotel magazine\n\nSample poems from the book have been published online at\n\nBerfrois www.berfrois.com/2019/06/no-one-really-understands-me\n\nTentacular www.tentacularmag.com/issue3b/steven-fowler\n\nHotel Magazine https://partisanhotel.co.uk/S-J-Fowler\n\nPerverse http://perverse/perverse\n\n“It is the fifth entry in SJ Fowler’s Poem Brut publication series, and strives to embrace environment affecting writing and writing affecting environment. It celebrates the obscure movement of the hand, writing, lining, drawing – deliberately plain, worked, smoggy. A book about the grid, the box, the cloud, the tree, where the words are meant to make you squint, to battle for legibility, rather than you be able to pinch and extend your thumb and forefinger against the page to get a closer look. Handwriting illustrates, it is more interesting than type, as are crossings out, as are notes, strange lines, grids made with rulers – constant gestures toward the homemade, the amateur, towards composition and motion. Towards liquid and wood, attractive ugliness, toilet wall draughtsmanship, doodled portraits, minor collage.”\n\nLaunches for UMOAH\n\nPoem Brut at Rich Mix #5, London : July Saturday 13th 2019\n\n7.30pm - Free entry. In the Mix\n\nJuly 25th at the May Day Rooms. This event will celebrate the wider list of Hesterglock.\n\n​From http://www.stevenjfowler.com/blog/2019/5/6/a-note-on-unfinished-memmoirs-of-a-hypocrit-coming-this-summer-from-hesterglock-press\n\nThe work Paul Hawkins and Sarer Scotthorne have done over the last number of years is really a source of encouragement, validation and hope for many poets writing around the edges of the Now (in the UK) because they are looking for the future. It is hard work, as it must often feel like digging a trench that fills with water, but their enthusiasm, sincerity and selflessness gives fuel to those like me, mining a weird and committed seam. I’m lucky to count them as friends, collaborators and supporters, as are brilliant folk like Thomas Havlik, James Caley, Arturo Desimone, Matti Spence and others.\" (thank you Steve for your generous words, support & enthusiasm)\n\nPublished: Bubble comb up on Perverse July 30, 2018\n\nChrissy Williams has recently started a brilliant and innovative new journal / e-mag endeavour entitled Perverse. It's a really engaged, open, direct, clever, complex way of sharing and reading poems, typical of Chrissy's work. I'm very happy to be in the latest issue, 1c, with some grand poets, and to feature a visual work which will be part of my last Poem Brut book, Memoirs of a Hypocrite, due out in November with Hesterglock press.\n\nYou can also save them as a single PDF here if you like. (You'll find the previous micro issues here.)\n\nContributor Note on ‘The Bubble Comb’:\n\n“'The Bubble Comb' is part of a book of art poetry, Memoirs of a Hypocrite (Hesterglock Press), which is part of a series of publications entitled www.poembrut.com It is about the potential poetic possibilities of handwriting, material, colour and composition meeting the semantic meaning of the written word.”"
