        "text": "1. Life and Achievements\n\nHermann Weyl was born on 9 November 1885 in the small town of Elmshorn near Hamburg. In 1904 he entered Göttingen University, where his teachers included Hilbert, Klein and Minkowski. Weyl was particularly impressed with Hilbert’s lectures on number theory and resolved to study everything he had written. Hilbert’s work on integral equations became the focus of Weyl’s (1908) doctoral dissertation, written under Hilbert’s direction. In this and in subsequent papers Weyl made important contributions to the theory of self-adjoint operators. Virtually all of Weyl’s many publications during his stay in Göttingen until 1913 dealt with integral equations and their applications.\n\nAfter Weyl’s (1910b) habilitation, he became a Privatdozent and was thereby entitled to give lectures at the University of Göttingen. Weyl chose to lecture on Riemann’s theory of algebraic functions during the winter semester of 1911–12. These lectures became the basis of Weyl’s (1913) first book Die Idee der Riemannschen Fläche (The Concept of a Riemann Surface). This work, in which function theory, geometry and topology are unified, constitutes the first modern and comprehensive treatment of Riemann surfaces. The work also contains the first construction of an abstract manifold. Emphasizing that the `points of the manifold’ can be quite arbitrary, Weyl based his definition of a general two-dimensional manifold or surface on an extension of the neighbourhood axioms that Hilbert (1902) had proposed for the definition of a plane. The work is indicative of Weyl’s exceptional gift for harmoniously uniting into a coherent whole a patchwork of distinct mathematical fields.\n\nIn 1913 Weyl was offered, and accepted, a professorship at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule—ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology)—in Zürich. Weyl’s years in Zürich were extraordinarily productive and resulted in some of his finest work, especially in the foundations of mathematics and physics. When he arrived in Zürich in the fall of 1913, Einstein and Grossmann were struggling to overcome a difficulty in their effort to provide a coherent mathematical formulation of the general theory of relativity. Like Hilbert, Weyl appreciated the importance of a close relationship between mathematics and physics. It was therefore only natural that Weyl should become interested in Einstein’s theory and the potential mathematical challenges it might offer. Following the outbreak of the First World War, however, in May 1915 Weyl was called up for military service. But Weyl’s academic career was interrupted only briefly, since in 1916 he was exempted from military duties for reasons of health. In the meantime Einstein had accepted an offer from Berlin and had left Zürich in 1914. Einstein’s departure had weakened the theoretical physics program at the ETH and (as reported by Frei and Stammbach (1992, 26) the administration hoped that Weyl’s presence would alleviate the situation. But Weyl needed no external prompting to work in, and to teach, theoretical physics: his interest in the subject in general and, above all, in the theory of relativity, gave him more than sufficient motivation in that regard. Weyl decided to lecture on the general theory of relativity in the summer semester of 1917, and these lectures became the basis of his famous book Raum-Zeit-Materie (Space-Time-Matter) of 1918.\n\nDuring 1917–24, Weyl directed his energies equally to the development of the mathematical and philosophical foundations of relativity theory, and to the broader foundations of mathematics. It is in these two areas that his philosophical erudition, nourished from his youth, manifests itself most clearly. The year 1918, the same year in which Space-Time-Matter appeared, also saw the publication of Das Kontinuum (The Continuum), a work in which Weyl constructs a new foundation for mathematical analysis free of what he had come to see as fatal flaws in the set-theoretic formulation of Cantor and Dedekind. Soon afterwards Weyl embraced Brouwer’s mathematical intuitionism; in the early 1920s he published a number of papers elaborating on and defending the intuitionistic standpoint in the foundations of mathematics.\n\nIt was also during the first years of the 1920s that Weyl came to appreciate the power and utility of group theory, initially in connection with his work on the solution to the Riemann-Helmholtz-Lie problem of space. Weyl analyzed this problem, the Raumproblem, in a series of articles and lectures during the period 1921–23. Weyl (1949b, 400) noted that his interest in the philosophical foundations of the general theory of relativity had motivated his analysis of the representations and invariants of the continuous groups:\n\nI can say that the wish to understand what really is the mathematical substance behind the formal apparatus of relativity theory led me to the study of the representations and invariants of groups; and my experience in this regard is probably not unique.\n\nThis newly acquired appreciation of group theory led Weyl to what he himself considered his greatest work in mathematics, a general theory of the representations and invariants of the classical Lie groups (Weyl 1924a, 1924f, 1925, 1926a, 1926b, 1926c). Later Weyl (1939) wrote a book, The Classical Groups: Their Invariants and Representations, in which he returned to the theory of invariants and representations of semisimple Lie groups. In this work he realized his ambition “to derive the decisive results for the most important of these groups by direct algebraic construction, in particular for the full group of all non-singular linear transformations and for the orthogonal group.”\n\nWeyl applied his work in group theory and his earlier work in analysis and spectral theory to the new theory of quantum mechanics. Weyl’s mathematical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics showed that regularities in a physical theory are most fruitfully understood in terms of symmetry groups. Weyl’s (1928) book Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik (Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics) deals not only with the theory of quantum mechanics but also with relativistic quantum electrodynamics. In this work Weyl also presented a very early analysis of discrete symmetries which later stimulated Dirac to predict the existence of the positron and the antiproton.\n\nDuring his years in Zürich Weyl received, and turned down, numerous offers of professorships by other universities—including an invitation in 1923 to become Felix Klein’s successor at Göttingen. It was only in 1930 that he finally accepted the call to become Hilbert’s successor there. His second stay in Göttingen was to be brief. Repelled by Nazism, “deeply revolted,” as he later wrote, “by the shame which this regime had brought to the German name,” he left Germany in 1933 to accept an offer of permanent membership of the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Before his departure for Princeton he published The Open World (1932); his tenure there saw the publication of Mind and Nature (1934), the aforementioned The Classical Groups (1939), Algebraic Theory of Numbers (1940), Meromorphic Functions and Analytic Curves (1943), Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science (1949; an enlarged English version of a 1927 work Philosophie der Mathematik und Naturwissenschaften), and Symmetry (1952). In 1951 he formally retired from the Institute, remaining as an emeritus member until his death, spending half his time there and half in Zürich. He died in Zürich suddenly, of a heart attack, on 9 December 1955.\n\n2. Metaphysics\n\nWeyl was first and foremost a mathematician, and certainly not a “professional” philosopher. But as a German intellectual of his time it was natural for him to regard philosophy as a pursuit to be taken seriously. In Weyl’s case, unusually even for a German mathematician, it was idealist philosophy that from the beginning played a significant role in his thought. Kant, Husserl, Fichte, and, later, Leibniz, were at various stages major influences on Weyl’s philosophical thinking. As a schoolboy Weyl had been impressed by Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason.” He was especially taken with Kant’s doctrine that space and time are not inherent in the objects of the world, existing as such and independently of our awareness, but are, rather, forms of our intuition As he reports in Insight and Reflection, (Weyl 1955), his youthful enthusiasm for Kant crumbled soon after he entered Göttingen University in 1904. There he read Hilbert’s Foundations of Geometry, a tour-de-force of the axiomatic method, in comparison to which Kant’s “bondage to Euclidean geometry” now appeared to him naïve. After this philosophical reverse he lapsed into an indifferent positivism for a while. But in 1912 he found a new and exciting source of philosophical enlightenment in Husserl’s phenomenology.[1] It was also at about this time that Fichte’s metaphysical idealism came to “capture his imagination.” Although Weyl later questioned idealist philosophy, and became dissatisfied with phenomenology, he remained faithful throughout his life to the primacy of intuition that he had first learned from Kant, and to the irreducibility of individual consciousness that had been confirmed in his view by Fichte and Husserl.\n\nWeyl never provided a systematic account of his philosophical views, and sorting out his overall philosophical position is no easy matter. Despite the importance of intuition and individual consciousness in Weyl’s philosophical outlook, it would nevertheless be inexact to describe his outlook as being that of a “pure” idealist, since certain “realist” touches seem also to be present, in his approach to physics, at least. His metaphysics appears to rest on three elements, the first two of which may be considered “idealist”, and the third “realist”: these are, respectively, the Ego or “I”, the (Conscious) Other or “Thou”, and the external or “objective” world.\n\nIt is the first of these constituents, the Ego, to which Weyl ascribes primacy. Indeed, in Weyl’s words,\n\nThe world exists only as met with by an ego, as one appearing to a consciousness; the consciousness in this function does not belong to the world, but stands out against the being as the sphere of vision, of meaning, of image, or however else one may call it. (Weyl 1934, 1)\n\nThe Ego alone has direct access to the given, that is, to the raw materials of the existent which are presented to consciousness with an immediacy at once inescapable and irreducible. The Ego is singular in that, from its own standpoint, it is unique. But in an act of self-reflection, through grasping (in Weyl’s words) “what I am for myself”, the Ego comes to recognize that it has a function, namely as “conscious-existing carrier of the world of phenomena.” It is then but a short step for the Ego to transcend its singularity through the act of defining an “ego” to be an entity performing that same function for itself. That is, an ego is precisely what I am for myself (in other words, what the Ego is for itself)—again a “conscious-existing carrier of the world of phenomena”—and yet other than myself. “Thou” is the term the Ego uses to address, and so to identify, an ego in this sense. “Thou” is thus the Ego generalized, the Ego refracted through itself. The Ego grasps that it exists within a world of Thous, that is, within a world of other Egos similar to itself. While the Ego has, of necessity, no direct access to any Thou, it can, through analogy and empathy, grasp what it is to be Thou, a conscious being like oneself. By that very fact the Ego recognizes in the Thou the same luminosity it sees in itself.\n\nThe relationship of the Ego with the external world, the realm of “objective” reality, is of an entirely different nature. There is no analogy that the Ego can draw—as it can with the Thou—between itself and the external world, since that world (presumably) lacks consciousness. The external world is radically other, and opaque to the Ego[2]. Like Kant’s noumenal realm, the external world is outside the immediacy of consciousness; it is, in a word, transcendent. Since this transcendent world is not directly accessible to the Ego, as far as the latter is concerned the existence of that world must arise through postulation, “a matter of metaphysics, not a judgment but an act of acknowledgment or belief.”[3] Indeed, according to Weyl, it is not strictly necessary for the Ego to postulate the existence of such a world, even given the existence of a world of Thous:\n\nFor as long as I do not proceed beyond what is given, or, more exactly, what is given at the moment, there is no need for the substructure of an objective world. Even if I include memory and in principle acknowledge it as valid testimony, if I furthermore accept as data the contents of the consciousness of others on equal terms with my own, thus opening myself to the mystery of intersubjective communication, I would still not have to proceed as we actually do, but might ask instead for the ‘transformations’ which mediate between the images of the several consciousnesses. Such a presentation would fit in with Leibniz’s monadology. (Weyl 1949, 117.)\n\nBut once the existence of the transcendent world is postulated, its opacity to the Ego can be partly overcome by constructing a representation of it through the use of symbols, the procedure called by Weyl symbolic construction, (or constructive cognition)[4] and which he regarded as the cornerstone of scientific explanation. He outlines the process as follows (Weyl 1934, 53):\n\nUpon that which is given, certain reactions are performed by which the given is in general brought together with other elements capable of being varied arbitrarily. If the results to be read from these reactions are found to be independent of the variable auxiliary elements they are then introduced as attributes inherent in the things themselves (even if we do not actually perform those reactions on which their meaning rests, but only believe in the possibility of their being performed).\n\nBy the introduction of symbols, the judgements are split up and a part of the manipulations is made independent of the given and its duration by being shifted onto the representing symbols which are time resisting and simultaneously serve the purpose of preservation and communication. Thereby the unrestricted handling of notions arises in counterpoint to their application, ideas in a relatively independent manner confront reality.\n\nSymbols are not produced simply “according to demand” wherever they correspond to actual occurrences, but they are embedded into an ordered manifold of possibilities created by free construction and open towards infinity. Only in this way may we contrive to predict the future, for the future is not given actually.\n\nWeyl’s procedure thus amounts to the following. In step 1, a given configuration is subjected to variation. One then identifies those features of the configuration that remain unchanged under the variation—the invariant features; these are in turn, through a process of reification, deemed to be properties of an unchanging substrate—the “things themselves”. It is precisely the invariance of such features that renders them (as well as the “things themselves”) capable of being represented by the “time resisting” symbols Weyl introduces in step 2. As (written) symbols these are communicable without temporal distortion and can be subjected to unrestricted manipulation without degradation. It is the flexibility conferred thereby which enables the use of symbols to be conformable with reality. Nevertheless (step 3) symbols are not haphazardly created in response to immediate stimuli; they are introduced, rather, in a structured, yet freely chosen manner which reflects the idea of an underlying order—the “one real world”—about which not everything is, or can be, known—it is, like the future, “open towards infinity”. Weyl observes that the reification implicit in the procedure of symbolic construction leads inevitably to its iteration, for “the transition from step to step is made necessary by the fact that the objects at one step reveal themselves as manifestations of a higher reality, the reality of the next step” (Weyl (1934), 32–33). But in the end “systematic scientific explanation will finally reverse the order: first it will erect its symbolical world by itself, without any reference, then, skipping all intermediate steps, try to describe which symbolical configurations lead to which data of consciousness” (ibid.). In this way the symbolic world becomes (mistakenly) identified with the transcendent world.\n\nIt is symbolic construction which, in Weyl’s vision, allows us access to the “objective” world presumed to underpin our immediate perceptions; indeed, Weyl holds that the objective world, being beyond the grasp (the “lighted circle”) of intuition, can only be presented to us in symbolic form[5]. We can see a double dependence on the Ego in Weyl’s idea of symbolic construction to get hold of an objective world beyond the mental. For not only is that world “constructed” by the Ego, but the materials of construction, the symbols themselves, as signs intended to convey meaning, have no independent existence beyond their graspability by a consciousness. By their very nature these symbols cannot point directly to an external world (even given an unshakable belief in the existence of that world) lying beyond consciousness. Weyl’s metaphysical triad thus reduces to what might be called a polarized dualism, with the mental (I, Thou) as the primary, independent pole and objective reality as a secondary, dependent pole[6].\n\nIn Weyl’s view mathematics simply lies – as it did for Brouwer – within the Ego’s “lighted circle of intuition” and so is, in principle at least, completely presentable to that intuition. But the nature of physics is more complicated. To the extent that physics is linked to the transcendent world of objective reality, it cannot arise as the direct object of intuition, but must, like the transcendent world itself, be presented in symbolic form; more exactly, as the result of a process of symbolic construction. It is this which, in Weyl’s vision, allows us access to to the \"objective\" world presumed to underpin our immediate perceptions.\n\nWeyl’s conviction that the objective world can only be presented to us through symbolic construction may serve to explain his apparently untroubled attitude towards the highly counterintuitive nature of quantum theory. Indeed, the claims of numerous physicists that the quantum microworld is accessible to us only through abstract mathematical description provides a vindication of Weyl’s thesis that objective reality cannot be grasped directly, but only through the mediation of symbols.\n\nIn his later years Weyl attempted to enlarge his metaphysical triad (I, Thou, objective world) to a tetrad, by a process of completion, as it were, to embrace the “godhead that lives in impenetrable silence”, the objective counterpart of the Ego, which had been suggested to him by his study of Eckhart. But this effort was to remain uncompleted.\n\nDuring his long philosophical voyage Weyl stopped at a number of ports of call: in his youth, Kantianism and positivism; then Husserlian phenomenological idealism; later Brouwerian intuitionism and finally a kind of theological existentialism. But apart from his brief flirtation with positivism (itself, as he says, the result of a disenchantment with Kant’s “bondage to Euclidean geometry”), Weyl’s philosophical orientation remained in its essence idealist (even granting the significant realist elements mentioned above). Nevertheless, while he continued to acknowledge the importance of phenomenology, his remarks in Insight and Reflection indicate that he came to regard Husserl’s doctrine as lacking in two essential respects: first, it failed to give due recognition to the (construction of) transcendent external world, with which Weyl, in his capacity as a natural scientist, was concerned; secondly, and perhaps in Weyl’s view even more seriously, it failed to engage with the enigma of selfhood: the fact that I am the person I am. Grappling with the first problem led Weyl to identify symbolic construction as providing sole access to objective reality, a position which brought him close to Cassirer in certain respects; while the second problem seems to have led him to existentialism and even, through his reading of Eckhart, to a kind of religious mysticism.\n\n3. Work in the foundations and philosophy of mathematics\n\nTowards the end of his Address on the Unity of Knowledge, delivered at the 1954 Columbia University bicentennial celebrations, Weyl enumerates what he considers to be the essential constituents of knowledge. At the top of his list[7] comes\n\n…intuition, mind’s ordinary act of seeing what is given to it. (Weyl 1954, 629)\n\nIn particular Weyl held to the view that intuition, or insight—rather than proof—furnishes the ultimate foundation of mathematical knowledge. Thus in his Das Kontinuum of 1918 he says:\n\nIn the Preface to Dedekind (1888) we read that “In science, whatever is provable must not be believed without proof.” This remark is certainly characteristic of the way most mathematicians think. Nevertheless, it is a preposterous principle. As if such an indirect concatenation of grounds, call it a proof though we may, can awaken any “belief” apart from assuring ourselves through immediate insight that each individual step is correct. In all cases, this process of confirmation—and not the proof—remains the ultimate source from which knowledge derives its authority; it is the “experience of truth”. (Weyl 1987, 119)\n\nWeyl’s idealism naturally inclined him to the view that the ultimate basis of his own subject, mathematics, must be found in the intuitively given as opposed to the transcendent. Nevertheless, he recognized that it would be unreasonable to require all mathematical knowledge to possess intuitive immediacy. In Das Kontinuum, for example, he says:\n\nThe states of affairs with which mathematics deals are, apart from the very simplest ones, so complicated that it is practically impossible to bring them into full givenness in consciousness and in this way to grasp them completely. (Ibid., 17)\n\nNevertheless, Weyl felt that this fact, inescapable as it might be, could not justify extending the bounds of mathematics to embrace notions, such as the actual infinite, which cannot be given fully in intuition even in principle. He held, rather, that such extensions of mathematics into the transcendent are warranted only by the fact that mathematics plays an indispensable role in the physical sciences, in which intuitive evidence is necessarily transcended. As he says in The Open World[8]:\n\n… if mathematics is taken by itself, one should restrict oneself with Brouwer to the intuitively cognizable truths … nothing compels us to go farther. But in the natural sciences we are in contact with a sphere which is impervious to intuitive evidence; here cognition necessarily becomes symbolical construction. Hence we need no longer demand that when mathematics is taken into the process of theoretical construction in physics it should be possible to set apart the mathematical element as a special domain in which all judgments are intuitively certain; from this higher standpoint which makes the whole of science appear as one unit, I consider Hilbert to be right. (Weyl 1932, 82).\n\nIn Consistency in Mathematics (1929), Weyl characterized the mathematical method as\n\nthe a priori construction of the possible in opposition to the a posteriori description of what is actually given.[9]\n\nThe problem of identifying the limits on constructing “the possible” in this sense occupied Weyl a great deal. He was particularly concerned with the concept of the mathematical infinite, which he believed to elude “construction” in the naive set-theoretical sense [10]. Again to quote a passage from Das Kontinuum:\n\nNo one can describe an infinite set other than by indicating properties characteristic of the elements of the set…. The notion that a set is a “gathering” brought together by infinitely many individual arbitrary acts of selection, assembled and then surveyed as a whole by consciousness, is nonsensical; “inexhaustibility” is essential to the infinite. (Weyl 1987, 23)\n\nBut still, as Weyl attests towards the end of The Open World, “the demand for totality and the metaphysical belief in reality inevitably compel the mind to represent the infinite as closed being by symbolical construction”. The conception of the completed infinite, even if nonsensical, is inescapable.\n\n3.1 Das Kontinuum\n\nAnother mathematical “possible” to which Weyl gave a great deal of thought is the continuum. During the period 1918–1921 he wrestled with the problem of providing the mathematical continuum—the real number line—with a logically sound formulation. Weyl had become increasingly critical of the principles underlying the set-theoretic construction of the mathematical continuum. He had come to believe that the whole set-theoretical approach involved vicious circles[11] to such an extent that, as he says, “every cell (so to speak) of this mighty organism is permeated by contradiction.” In Das Kontinuum he tries to overcome this by providing analysis with a predicative formulation—not, as Russell and Whitehead had attempted, by introducing a hierarchy of logically ramified types, which Weyl seems to have regarded as excessively complicated—but rather by confining the comprehension principle to formulas whose bound variables range over just the initial given entities (numbers). Accordingly he restricts analysis to what can be done in terms of natural numbers with the aid of three basic logical operations, together with the operation of substitution and the process of “iteration”, i.e., primitive recursion. Weyl recognized that the effect of this restriction would be to render unprovable many of the central results of classical analysis—e.g., Dirichlet’s principle that any bounded set of real numbers has a least upper bound[12]—but he was prepared to accept this as part of the price that must be paid for the security of mathematics.\n\nAs Weyl saw it, there is an unbridgeable gap between intuitively given continua (e.g. those of space, time and motion) on the one hand, and the “discrete” exact concepts of mathematics (e.g. that of natural number[13]) on the other. The presence of this chasm meant that the construction of the mathematical continuum could not simply be “read off” from intuition. It followed, in Weyl’s view, that the mathematical continuum must be treated as if it were an element of the transcendent realm, and so, in the end, justified in the same way as a physical theory. It was not enough that the mathematical theory be consistent; it must also be reasonable.\n\nDas Kontinuum embodies Weyl’s attempt at formulating a theory of the continuum which satisfies the first, and, as far as possible, the second, of these requirements. In the following passages from this work he acknowledges the difficulty of the task:\n\n… the conceptual world of mathematics is so foreign to what the intuitive continuum presents to us that the demand for coincidence between the two must be dismissed as absurd. (Weyl 1987, 108)\n\n… the continuity given to us immediately by intuition (in the flow of time and of motion) has yet to be grasped mathematically as a totality of discrete “stages” in accordance with that part of its content which can be conceptualized in an exact way. (Ibid., 24)[14]\n\nExact time- or space-points are not the ultimate, underlying atomic elements of the duration or extension given to us in experience. On the contrary, only reason, which thoroughly penetrates what is experientially given, is able to grasp these exact ideas. And only in the arithmetico- analytic concept of the real number belonging to the purely formal sphere do these ideas crystallize into full definiteness. (Ibid., 94)\n\nWhen our experience has turned into a real process in a real world and our phenomenal time has spread itself out over this world and assumed a cosmic dimension, we are not satisfied with replacing the continuum by the exact concept of the real number, in spite of the essential and undeniable inexactness arising from what is given. (Ibid., 93)\n\nAs these quotations show, Weyl had come to accept that it was in principle impossible to furnish the continuum as presented to intuition with an exact mathematical formulation : so, with reluctance, he lowered his sights. In Das Kontinuum his goal was, first and foremost, to establish the consistency of the mathematical theory of the continuum by putting the arithmetical notion of real number on a firm logical basis. Once this had been achieved, he would then proceed to show that this theory is reasonable by employing it as the foundation for a plausible account of continuous process in the objective physical world.[15]\n\nIn §6 of Das Kontinuum Weyl presents his conclusions as to the relationship between the intuitive and mathematical continua. He poses the question: Does the mathematical framework he has erected provide an adequate representation of physical or temporal continuity as it is actually experienced? In posing this question we can see the continuing influence of Husserl and phenomenological doctrine. Weyl begins his investigation by noting that, according to his theory, if one asks whether a given function is continuous, the answer is not fixed once and for all, but is, rather, dependent on the extent of the domain of real numbers which have been defined up to the point at which the question is posed. Thus the continuity of a function must always remain provisional; the possibility always exists that a function deemed continuous now may, with the emergence of “new” real numbers, turn out to be discontinuous in the future. [16]\n\nTo reveal the discrepancy between this formal account of continuity based on real numbers and the properties of an intuitively given continuum, Weyl next considers the experience of seeing a pencil lying on a table before him throughout a certain time interval. The position of the pencil during this interval may be taken as a function of the time, and Weyl takes it as a fact of observation that during the time interval in question this function is continuous and that its values fall within a definite range. And so, he says,\n\nThis observation entitles me to assert that during a certain period this pencil was on the table; and even if my right to do so is not absolute, it is nevertheless reasonable and well-grounded. It is obviously absurd to suppose that this right can be undermined by “an expansion of our principles of definition”—as if new moments of time, overlooked by my intuition could be added to this interval, moments in which the pencil was, perhaps, in the vicinity of Sirius or who knows where. If the temporal continuum can be represented by a variable which “ranges over” the real numbers, then it appears to be determined thereby how narrowly or widely we must understand the concept “real number” and the decision about this must not be entrusted to logical deliberations over principles of definition and the like. (Weyl 1987, 88)\n\nTo drive the point home, Weyl focuses attention on the fundamental continuum of immediately given phenomenal time, that is, as he characterizes it,\n\n… to that constant form of my experiences of consciousness by virtue of which they appear to me to flow by successively. (By “experiences” I mean what I experience, exactly as I experience it. I do not mean real psychical or even physical processes which occur in a definite psychic-somatic individual, belong to a real world, and, perhaps, correspond to the direct experiences.) (Ibid., 88)\n\nIn order to correlate mathematical concepts with phenomenal time in this sense Weyl grants the possibility of introducing a rigidly punctate “now” and of identifying and exhibiting the resulting temporal points. On the collection of these temporal points is defined the relation of earlier than as well as a congruence relation of equality of temporal intervals, the basic constituents of a simple mathematical theory of time. Now Weyl observes that the discrepancy between phenomenal time and the concept of real number would vanish if the following pair of conditions could be shown to be satisfied:\n\nThe immediate expression of the intuitive finding that during a certain period I saw the pencil lying there were construed in such a way that the phrase “during a certain period” was replaced by “in every temporal point which falls within a certain time span OE”. [Weyl goes on to say parenthetically here that he admits “that this no longer reproduces what is intuitively present, but one will have to let it pass, if it is really legitimate to dissolve a period into temporal points.”)\n\nIf \\(P\\) is a temporal point, then the domain of rational numbers to which \\(l\\) belongs if and only if there is a time point \\(L\\) earlier than \\(P\\) such that \\[ OL = l{.}OE \\]\n\ncan be constructed arithmetically in pure number theory on the basis of our principles of definition, and is therefore a real number in our sense. (Ibid., 89)\n\nCondition 2 means that, if we take the time span \\(OE\\) as a unit, then each temporal point \\(P\\) is correlated with a definite real number. In an addendum Weyl also stipulates the converse.\n\nBut can temporal intuition itself provide evidence for the truth or falsity of these two conditions? Weyl thinks not. In fact, he states quite categorically that\n\n… everything we are demanding here is obvious nonsense: to these questions, the intuition of time provides no answer—just as a man makes no reply to questions which clearly are addressed to him by mistake and, therefore, are unintelligible when addressed to him. (Ibid., 90)\n\nThe grounds for this assertion are by no means immediately evident, but one gathers from the passages following it that Weyl regards the experienced continuous flow of phenomenal time as constituting an insuperable barrier to the whole enterprise of representing the continuum as experienced in terms of individual points, and even to the characterization of “individual temporal point” itself. As he says,\n\nThe view of a flow consisting of points and, therefore, also dissolving into points turns out to be mistaken: precisely what eludes us is the nature of the continuity, the flowing from point to point; in other words, the secret of how the continually enduring present can continually slip away into the receding past. Each one of us, at every moment, directly experiences the true character of this temporal continuity. But, because of the genuine primitiveness of phenomenal time, we cannot put our experiences into words. So we shall content ourselves with the following description. What I am conscious of is for me both a being-now and, in its essence, something which, with its temporal position, slips away. In this way there arises the persisting factual extent, something ever new which endures and changes in consciousness. (Ibid., 91–92)\n\nWeyl sums up what he thinks can be affirmed about “objectively presented time”—by which he presumably means “phenomenal time described in an objective manner”—in the following two assertions, which he claims apply equally, mutatis mutandis, to every intuitively given continuum, in particular, to the continuum of spatial extension. (Ibid., 92):\n\nAn individual point in it is non-independent, i.e., is pure nothingness when taken by itself, and exists only as a “point of transition” (which, of course, can in no way be understood mathematically);\n\nIt is due to the essence of time (and not to contingent imperfections in our medium) that a fixed temporal point cannot be exhibited in any way, that always only an approximate, never an exact determination is possible.\n\nThe fact that single points in a true continuum “cannot be exhibited” arises, Weyl asserts, from the fact that they are not genuine individuals and so cannot be characterized by their properties. In the physical world they are never defined absolutely, but only in terms of a coordinate system, which, in an arresting metaphor, Weyl describes as “the unavoidable residue of the eradication of the ego.” This metaphor, which Weyl was to employ more than once[17], again reflects the continuing influence of phenomenological doctrine in his thinking : here, the thesis that the existent is given in the first instance as the contents of a consciousness.\n\n3.2 Weyl and Brouwerian Intuitionism\n\nBy 1919 Weyl had come to embrace Brouwer’s views on the intuitive continuum. Given the idealism that always animated Weyl’s thought, this is not surprising, since Brouwer assigned the thinking subject a central position in the creation of the mathematical world[18].\n\nIn his early thinking Brouwer had held that that the continuum is presented to intuition as a whole, and that it is impossible to construct all its points as individuals. But later he radically transformed the concept of “point”, endowing points with sufficient fluidity to enable them to serve as generators of a “true” continuum. This fluidity was achieved by admitting as “points”, not only fully defined discrete numbers such as 1/9, \\(e\\), and the like—which have, so to speak, already achieved “being”—but also “numbers” which are in a perpetual state of “becoming” in that the entries in their decimal (or dyadic) expansions are the result of free acts of choice by a subject operating throughout an indefinitely extended time. The resulting choice sequences cannot be conceived as finished, completed objects: at any moment only an initial segment is known. Thus Brouwer obtained the mathematical continuum in a manner compatible with his belief in the primordial intuition of time—that is, as an unfinished, in fact unfinishable entity in a perpetual state of growth, a “medium of free development”. In Brouwer’s vision, the mathematical continuum is indeed “constructed”, not, however, by initially shattering, as did Cantor and Dedekind, an intuitive continuum into isolated points, but rather by assembling it from a complex of continually changing overlapping parts.\n\nBrouwer’s impact looms large in Weyl’s 1921 paper, On the New Foundational Crisis of Mathematics. Here Weyl identifies two distinct views of the continuum: “atomistic” or “discrete”; and “continuous”. In the first of these the continuum is composed of individual real numbers which are well-defined and can be sharply distinguished. Weyl describes his earlier attempt at reconstructing analysis in Das Kontinuum as atomistic in this sense:\n\nExistential questions concerning real numbers only become meaningful if we analyze the concept of real number in this extensionally determining and delimiting manner. Through this conceptual restriction, an ensemble of individual points is, so to speak, picked out from the fluid paste of the continuum. The continuum is broken up into isolated elements, and the flowing-into-each other of its parts is replaced by certain conceptual relations between these elements, based on the “larger-smaller” relationship. This is why I speak of the atomistic conception of the continuum. (Weyl 1921, 91)\n\nBy this time Weyl had repudiated atomistic theories of the continuum, including that of Das Kontinuum.[19] While intuitive considerations, together with Brouwer’s influence, must certainly have fuelled Weyl’s rejection of such theories, it also had a logical basis. For Weyl had come to regard as meaningless the formal procedure—employed in Das Kontinuum—of negating universal and existential statements concerning real numbers conceived as developing sequences or as sets of rationals. This had the effect of undermining the whole basis on which his theory had been erected, and at the same time rendered impossible the very formulation of a “law of excluded middle” for such statements. Thus Weyl found himself espousing a position[20] considerably more radical than that of Brouwer, for whom negations of quantified statements had a perfectly clear constructive meaning, under which the law of excluded middle is simply not generally affirmable.\n\nOf existential statements Weyl says:\n\nAn existential statement—e.g., “there is an even number”—is not a judgement in the proper sense at all, which asserts a state of affairs; existential states of affairs are the empty invention of logicians. (Weyl [1921], 97)\n\nWeyl termed such pseudostatements “judgment abstracts”, likening them, with typical literary flair, to “a piece of paper which announces the presence of a treasure, without divulging its location.” Universal statements, although possessing greater substance than existential ones, are still mere intimations of judgments, “judgment instructions”, for which Weyl provides the following metaphorical description:\n\nIf knowledge be compared to a fruit and the realization of that knowledge to the consumption of the fruit, then a universal statement is to be compared to a hard shell filled with fruit. It is, obviously, of some value, however, not as a shell by itself, but only for its content of fruit. It is of no use to me as long as I do not open it and actually take out a fruit and eat it. (Ibid., 98)\n\nAbove and beyond the claims of logic, Weyl welcomed Brouwer’s construction of the continuum by means of sequences generated by free acts of choice, thus identifying it as a “medium of free Becoming” which “does not dissolve into a set of real numbers as finished entities”. Weyl felt that Brouwer, through his doctrine of Intuitionism[21], had come closer than anyone else to bridging that “unbridgeable chasm” between the intuitive and mathematical continua. In particular, he found compelling the fact that the Brouwerian continuum is not the union of two disjoint nonempty parts—that it is, in a word, indecomposable. “A genuine continuum,” Weyl says, “cannot be divided into separate fragments.”[22] In later publications he expresses this more colourfully by quoting Anaxagoras to the effect that a continuum “defies the chopping off of its parts with a hatchet.”\n\nWeyl also agreed with Brouwer that all functions everywhere defined on a continuum are continuous, but here certain subtle differences of viewpoint emerge. Weyl contends that what mathematicians had taken to be discontinuous functions actually consist of several continuous functions defined on separated continua. In Weyl’s view, for example, the “discontinuous” function defined by \\(f(x) = 0\\) for \\(x \\lt 0\\) and \\(f(x) = 1\\) for \\(x \\ge 0\\) in fact consists of the two functions with constant values and 1 respectively defined on the separated continua \\(\\{x: x \\lt 0\\}\\) and \\(\\{x: x \\ge 0\\}\\). (The union of these two continua fails to be the whole of the real continuum because of the failure of the law of excluded middle: it is not the case that, for be any real number \\(x\\), either \\(x \\lt 0\\) or \\(x \\ge 0\\).) Brouwer, on the other hand, had not dismissed the possibility that discontinuous functions could be defined on proper parts of a continuum, and still seems to have been searching for an appropriate way of formulating this idea.[23] In particular, at that time Brouwer would probably have been inclined to regard the above function \\(f\\) as a genuinely discontinuous function defined on a proper part of the real continuum. For Weyl, it seems to have been a self-evident fact that all functions defined on a continuum are continuous, but this is because Weyl confines attention to functions which turn out to be continuous by definition. Brouwer’s concept of function is less restrictive than Weyl’s and it is by no means immediately evident that such functions must always be continuous.\n\nWeyl defined real functions as mappings correlating each interval in the choice sequence determining the argument with an interval in the choice sequence determining the value “interval by interval” as it were, the idea being that approximations to the input of the function should lead effectively to corresponding approximations to the input. Such functions are continuous by definition. Brouwer, in contrast, considers real functions as correlating choice sequences with choice sequences, and the continuity of these is by no means obvious. The fact that Weyl refused to grant (free) choice sequences—whose identity is in no way predetermined—sufficient individuality to admit them as arguments of functions betokens a commitment to the conception of the continuum as a “medium of free Becoming” even deeper, perhaps, than that of Brouwer.\n\nThere thus being only minor differences between Weyl’s and Brouwer’s accounts of the continuum, Weyl accordingly abandoned his earlier attempt at the reconstruction of analysis, and joined Brouwer. He explains:\n\nI tried to find solid ground in the impending state of dissolution of the State of analysis (which is in preparation, although still only recognized by few)without forsaking the order on which it is founded, by carrying out its fundamental principle purely and honestly. And I believe I was successful—as far as this is possible. For this order is itself untenable, as I have now convinced myself, and Brouwer—that is the revolution!… It would have been wonderful had the old dispute led to the conclusion that the atomistic conception as well as the continuous one can be carried through. Instead the latter triumphs for good over the former. It is Brouwer to whom we owe the new solution of the continuum problem. History has destroyed again from within the provisional solution of Galilei and the founders of the differential and the integral calculus. (Weyl 1921, 98–99)\n\nWeyl’s initial enthusiasm for intuitionism seems later to have waned. This may have been due to a growing belief on his part that the mathematical sacrifices demanded by adherence to intuitionistic doctrine (e.g., the abandonment of the least upper bound principle, and other important results of classical analysis) would prove to be intolerable to practicing mathematicians. Witness this passage from Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science:\n\nMathematics with Brouwer gains its highest intuitive clarity. He succeeds in developing the beginnings of analysis in a natural manner, all the time preserving the contact with intuition much more closely than had been done before. It cannot be denied, however, that in advancing to higher and more general theories the inapplicability of the simple laws of classical logic eventually results in an almost unbearable awkwardness. And the mathematician watches with pain the greater part of his towering edifice which he believed to be built of concrete blocks dissolve into mist before his eyes. (Weyl [1949], 54)\n\nNevertheless, it is likely that Weyl remained convinced to the end of his days that intuitionism, despite its technical “awkwardness”, came closest, of all mathematical approaches, to capturing the essence of the continuum.\n\n3.3 Weyl and Hilbert\n\nWeyl’s espousal of the intuitionistic standpoint in the foundations of mathematics in 1920–21 inevitably led to friction with his old mentor Hilbert. Hilbert’s conviction had long been that there were in principle no limitations on the possibility of a full scientific understanding of the natural world, and, analogously, in the case of mathematics, that once a problem was posed with the required precision, it was, at least in principle, soluble. In 1904 he was moved to respond to Emil du Bois-Reymond’s famous declaration concerning the limits of science, ignoramus et ignorabimus (“we are ignorant and we shall remain ignorant”):\n\nWe hear within us the perpetual call. There is the problem. Seek the solution. You can find it by pure reason, for in mathematics there is no ignorabimus.[24]\n\nHilbert was unalterably opposed to any restriction of mathematics “by decree”, an obstacle he had come up against in the early stages of his career in the form of Leopold Kronecker’s (the influential 19th century German mathematician) anathematization of all mathematics venturing beyond the finite. In Brouwer’s intuitionistic program—with its draconian restrictions on what was admissible in mathematical argument, in particular, its rejection of the law of excluded middle, “pure” existence proofs, and virtually the whole of Cantorian set theory—Hilbert saw the return of Kroneckerian constaints on mathematics (and also, perhaps, a trace of du Bois-Reymond’s “ignorabimus”) against which he had struggled for so long. Small wonder, then, that Hilbert was upset when Weyl joined the Brouwerian camp.[25]\n\nHilbert’s response was to develop an entirely new approach to the foundations of mathematics with the ultimate goal of establishing beyond doubt the consistency of the whole of classical mathematics, including arithmetic, analysis, and Cantorian set theory. With the attainment of that goal, classical mathematics would be placed securely beyond the destructive reach of the intuitionists. The core of Hilbert’s program was the translation of the whole apparatus of classical mathematical demonstration into a simple, finitistic framework (which he called “metamathematics”) involving nothing more, in principle, than the straightforward manipulation of symbols, taken in a purely formal sense, and devoid of further meaning.[26] Within metamathematics itself, Hilbert imposed a standard of demonstrative evidence stricter even than that demanded by the intuitionists, a form of finitism rivalling (ironically) that of Kronecker. The demonstration of the consistency of classical mathematics was then to be achieved by showing, within the constraints of strict finitistic evidence insisted on by Hilbert, that the formal metamathematical counterpart of a classical proof in that system can never lead to an assertion evidently false, such as \\(0 = 1\\).\n\nHilbert’s program rested on the insight that, au fond, the only part of mathematics whose reliability is entirely beyond question is the finitistic, or concrete part: in particular, finite manipulation of surveyable domains of distinct objects including mathematical symbols presented as marks on paper. Mathematical propositions referring only to concrete objects in this sense Hilbert called real, concrete, or contentual propositions, and all other mathematical propositions he distinguished as possessing an ideal, or abstract character. (Thus, for example, \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) would count as a real proposition, while there exists an odd perfect number would count as an ideal one.) Hilbert viewed ideal propositions as akin to the ideal lines and points “at infinity” of projective geometry. Just as the use of these does not violate any truths of the “concrete” geometry of the usual Cartesian plane, so he hoped to show that the use of ideal propositions—even those of Cantorian set theory—would never lead to falsehoods among the real propositions, that, in other words, such use would never contradict any self-evident fact about concrete objects. Establishing this by strictly concrete, and so unimpeachable means was thus the central aim of Hilbert’s program. Hilbert may be seen to have followed Kant in attempting to ground mathematics on the apprehension of spatiotemporal configurations; but Hilbert restricted these configurations to concrete signs (such as inscriptions on paper). Hilbert regarded consistency as the touchstone of existence, and so for him the important thing was the fact that no inconsistencies can arise within the realm of concrete signs, since correct descriptions of concrete objects are always mutually compatible. In particular, within the realm of concrete signs, actual infinity cannot generate inconsistencies since, again along with Kant, he held that this concept cannot correspond to any concrete object. Hilbert’s view seems accordingly to have been that the formal soundness of mathematics issues ultimately, not from a logical source, but from a concrete one[27], in much the same way as the consistency of truly reported empirical statements is guaranteed by the concreteness of the external world[28].\n\nWeyl soon grasped the significance of Hilbert’s program, and came to acknowledge its “immense significance and scope”[29]. Whether that program could be successfully carried out was, of course, still an open question. But independently of this issue Weyl was concerned about what he saw as the loss of content resulting from Hilbert’s thoroughgoing formalization of mathematics. “Without doubt,” Weyl warns, “if mathematics is to remain a serious cultural concern, then some sense must be attached to Hilbert’s game of formulae.” Weyl thought that this sense could only be supplied by “fusing” mathematics and physics so that “the mathematical concepts of number, function, etc. (or Hilbert’s symbols) generally partake in the theoretical construction of reality in the same way as the concepts of energy, gravitation, electron, etc.”[30] Indeed, in Weyl’s view, “it is the function of mathematics to be at the service of the natural sciences”. But still:\n\nThe propositions of theoretical physics… lack that feature which Brouwer demands of the propositions of mathematics, namely, that each should carry within itself its own intuitively comprehensible meaning…. Rather, what is tested by confronting theoretical physics with experience is the system as a whole. It seems that we have to differentiate between phenomenal knowledge or insight—such as is expressed in the statement: “This leaf (given to me in a present act of perception) has this green color (given to me in this same perception)”—and theoretical construction. Knowledge furnishes truth, its organ is “seeing” in the widest sense. Though subject to error, it is essentially definitive and unalterable. Theoretical construction seems to be bound only to one strictly formulable rational principle, concordance, which in mathematics, where the domain of sense data remains untouched, reduces to consistency; its organ is creative imagination. (Weyl 1949, 61–62)\n\nWeyl points out that, just as in theoretical physics, Hilbert’s account of mathematics “already… goes beyond the bounds of intuitively ascertainable states of affairs through… ideal assumptions.” (Weyl 1927, 484.) If Hilbert’s realm of contentual or “real” propositions—the domain of metamathematics—corresponds to that part of the world directly accessible to what Weyl terms “insight” or “phenomenal knowledge”, then “serious” mathematics—the mathematics that practicing mathematicians are actually engaged in doing—corresponds to Hilbert’s realm of “ideal” propositions. Weyl regarded this realm as the counterpart of the domain generated by “symbolic construction”, the transcendent world focussed on by theoretical physics. Hence his memorable characterization:\n\nThe set-theoretical approach is the stage of naive realism which is unaware of the transition from the given to the transcendent. Brouwer represents idealism, by demanding the reduction of all truth to the intuitively given. In [Hilbert’s] formalism, finally, consciousness makes the attempt to “jump over its own shadow”, to leave behind the stuff of the given, to represent the transcendent—but, how could it be otherwise?, only through the symbol. (Weyl 1949, 65–66)\n\nIn Weyl’s eyes, Hilbert’s approach embodied the “symbolic representation of the transcendent, which demands to be satisfied”, and so he regarded its emergence as a natural development. But by 1927 Weyl saw Hilbert’s doctrine as beginning to prevail over intuitionism, and in this an adumbration of “a decisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure phenomenology, which thus proves to be insufficient for the understanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that is most primal and most readily open to evidence—mathematics.”[31] Since by this time Weyl had become convinced that “creative science” must necessarily transcend what is phenomenologically given, he had presumably already accepted that pure phenomenology is incapable of accounting for theoretical physics, let alone the whole of existence. But it must have been painful for him to concede the analogous claim in the case of mathematics. In 1932, he asserts: “If mathematics is taken by itself, one should restrict oneself with Brouwer to the intuitively cognizable truths … nothing compels us to go farther.” If mathematics could be “taken by itself”, then there would be no need for it to justify its practices by resorting to “symbolic construction”, to employ symbols which in themselves “signify nothing”—nothing, at least, accessible to intuition. But, unlike Brouwer, Weyl seems finally to have come to terms with the idea that mathematics could not simply be “taken by itself”, that it has a larger role to play in the world beyond its service as a paradigm, however pure, of subjective certainty.\n\nThe later impact of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems on Hilbert’s program led Weyl to remark in 1949:[32]\n\nThe ultimate foundations and the ultimate meaning of mathematics remain an open problem; we do not know in what direction it will find its solution, nor even whether a final objective answer can be expected at all. “Mathematizing” may well be a creative activity of man, like music, the products of which not only in form but also in substance defy complete objective rationalization. The undecisive outcome of Hilbert’s bold enterprise cannot fail to affect the philosophical interpretation. (Weyl 1949, 219)\n\nThe fact that “Gödel has left us little hope that a formalism wide enough to encompass classical mathematics will be supported by a proof of consistency” seems to have led Weyl to take a renewed interest in “axiomatic systems developed before Hilbert without such ambitious dreams”, for example Zermelo’s set theory, Russell’s and Whitehead’s ramified type theory and Hilbert’s own axiom systems for geometry (as well, possibly, as Weyl’s own system in Das Kontinuum, which he modestly fails to mention). In one of his last papers, Axiomatic Versus Constructive Procedures in Mathematics, written sometime after 1953, he saw the battle between Hilbertian formalism and Brouwerian intuitionism in which he had participated in the 1920s as having given way to a “dextrous blending” of the axiomatic approach to mathematics championed by Bourbaki and the algebraists (themselves mathematical descendants of Hilbert) with constructive procedures associated with geometry and topology.\n\nIt seems appropriate to conclude this account of Weyl’s work in the foundations and philosophy of mathematics by allowing the man himself to have the last word:\n\nThis history should make one thing clear: we are less certain than ever about the ultimate foundations of (logic and) mathematics; like everybody and everything in the world today, we have our “crisis”. We have had it for nearly fifty years. Outwardly it does not seem to hamper our daily work, and yet I for one confess that it has had a considerable practical influence on my mathematical life: it directed my interests to fields I considered relatively “safe”, and it has been a constant drain on my enthusiasm and determination with which I pursued my research work. The experience is probably shared by other mathematicians who are not indifferent to what their scientific endeavours mean in the contexts of man’s whole caring and knowing, suffering and creative existence in the world. (Weyl 1946, 13)\n\n4. Contributions to the Foundations of Physics\n\n4.1 Spacetime Geometries and Weyl’s Unified Field Theory\n\nWeyl’s clarification of the role of coordinates, invariance or symmetry principles, his important concept of gauge invariance, his group-theoretic results concerning the uniqueness of the Pythagorean form of the metric, his generalization of Levi-Civita’s concept of parallelism, his development of the geometry of paths, his discovery of the causal-inertial method which prepared the way to empirically determine the spacetime metric in a non-circular, non-conventional manner, his deep analysis of the concept of motion and the role of Mach’s Principle, are but a few examples of his important contributions to the philosophical and mathematical foundations of modern spacetime theory.\n\nWeyl’s book, Raum-Zeit-Materie, beautifully exemplifies the fruitful and harmonious interplay of mathematics, physics and philosophy. Here Weyl aims at a mathematical and philosophical elucidation of the problem of space and time in general. In the preface to the great classical work of 1923, the fifth German edition, after mentioning the importance of mathematics to his work, Weyl says:\n\nDespite this, the book does not disavow its basic, philosophical orientation: its central focus is conceptual analysis; physics provides the experiential basis, mathematics the sharp tools. In this new edition, this tendency has been further strengthened; although the growth of speculation was trimmed, the supporting foundational ideas were more intuitively, more carefully and more completely developed and analyzed.\n\n4.1.1 Weyl’s metric-independent construction of the symmetric linear connection\n\nExtending and abstracting from Gauss’s treatment of curved surfaces in Euclidian space, Riemann constructed an infinitesimal geometry of \\(n\\)-dimensional manifolds. The coordinate assignments \\(x^{k}(p)\\ [k \\in \\{1, \\ldots ,n\\}\\)] of the points \\(p\\) in such an \\(n\\)-dimensional Riemannian manifold are quite arbitrary, subject only to the requirement of arbitrary differential coordinate transformations.[33] Riemann’s assumption that in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of a point, Euclidean geometry and hence Pythagoras’s theorem holds, finds its formal expression in Riemann’s equation\n\n\\[\\tag{1} ds^2 = \\sum_{i,j} g_{ij}(x^{k}(p))dx^{i}dx^{j}\\ [\\text{where } g_{ij}(x^{k}(p)) = g_{ji}(x^{k}(p))] \\]\n\nfor the square of the length \\(ds\\) of an infinitesimal line element that leads from the point \\(p = x(p) = (x^{1}(p), \\ldots ,x^{n}(p))\\) to an arbitrary infinitely near point \\(p' = x(p') = (x^{1}(p) + dx^{1}(p), \\ldots ,x^{n}(p) + dx^{n}(p))\\).\n\nThe assumption that Euclidean geometry holds in the infinitesimally small means that the \\(dx^{i}(p)\\) transform linearly under arbitrary coordinate transformations. Using the Einstein summation convention[34], equation (1) can simply be written as\n\n\\[\\tag{2} ds^{2} = g_{ij}(x^{k}(p))dx^{i}dx^{j}. \\]\n\nRiemann assumed the validity of the Pythagorean metric only in the infinitely small. Riemannian geometry is essentially a geometry of infinitely near points and conforms to the requirement that all laws are to be formulated as field laws. Field laws are close-action-laws which relate the field magnitudes only to infinitesimally neighbouring points in space.[35] The value of some field magnitude at each point depends only on the values of other field magnitudes in the infinitesimal neighbourhoods of the corresponding points. The field magnitudes consist of partial derivatives of position functions at some point, and this requires the knowledge of the behavior of the position functions only with respect to the neighbourhood of that point[36] To construct a field law, only the behavior of the world in the infinitesimally small is required.[37]\n\nRiemann’s ideas were brought to a concrete realization fifty years later in Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The basic idea underlying the general theory of relativity was Einstein’s recognition that the metric field, which has such powerful real effects on matter, cannot be a rigid once and for all given geometric structure of the spacetime, but must itself be something real, that not only has effects on matter, but is in turn also affected by matter. Riemann had already suggested that analogous to the electromagnetic field, the metric field reciprocally interacts with matter. Einstein came to this idea of reciprocity between matter and field independently of Riemann, and in the context of his theory of general relativity, applied this principle of reciprocity to four dimensional spacetime. Thus Einstein could adopt Riemann’s infinitesimal geometry with the important difference: given the causal requirements of Einstein’s theory of special relativity, Riemann’s quadratic form is not positive definite but indefinite; it has signature 1.[38] Weyl (1922a) says:\n\nAll our considerations until now were based on the assumption, that the metric structure of space is something that is fixed and given. Riemann already pointed to another possibility which was realized through General Relativity. The metrical structure of the extensive medium of the external world is a field of physical reality, which is causally dependent on the state of matter.\n\nAnd in another place Weyl (1918b) remarks:\n\nThe metric is not a property of the world [spacetime] in itself, rather spacetime as a form of appearance is a completely formless four-dimensional continuum in the sense of analysis situs, but the metric expresses something real, something which exists in the world, which exerts through centrifugal and gravitational forces physical effects on matter, and whose state is conversely conditioned through the distribution and nature of matter.\n\nAfter Einstein applied Riemannian geometry to his theory of general relativity, Riemannian geometry became the focus of intense research. In particular, G. Ricci and T. Levi-Civita’s so-called Absolute Differential Calculus developed and clarified the Riemannian notions of an affine connection and covariant differentiation. The decisive step in this development, however, was T. Levi-Civita’s discovery in 1917 of the concept of infinitesimal parallel vector displacement, and the fact that such parallel vector displacement is uniquely determined by the metric field of Riemannian geometry. Levi-Civita’s construction of infinitesimal parallel transport on a manifold required the process of embedding the manifold into a flat higher-dimensional metric space. In 1918, Weyl generalized Levi-Civita’s concept of parallel transport by means of an intrinsic construction that does not require the process of such an embedding, and is therefore independent of a metric. Weyl’s intrinsic construction results in a metric-independent, symmetric linear connection. Weyl simply referred to the latter as affine connection.[39]\n\nWeyl defines what he means by an affine connection in the following way: A point \\(p\\) on the manifold \\(M\\) is affinely connected with its immediate neighborhood, if and only of for every tangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) at \\(p\\), a tangent vector \\(v_{q}\\) at \\(q\\) is determined to which the tangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) gives rise under parallel displacement from \\(p\\) to the infinitesimally neighboring point \\(q\\). This definition merely says that a manifold is affinely connected if it admits the process of infinitesimal parallel displacement of a vector.\n\nWeyl’s next definition characterizes the essential nature of infinitesimal parallel displacement. The definition says that at any arbitrary point of the manifold there exists a geodesic coordinate system such that the components of any vector at that point are not altered by an infinitesimal parallel displacement with respect to it. This is a geometrical way of expressing Einstein’s requirement that the gravitational field can always be made to vanish locally. According to Weyl (1923b, 115), it characterizes the nature of an affine connection on the manifold. A manifold which is an affine manifold is homogeneous in this sense. Moreover, manifolds do not exist whose affine structure is of a different nature.\n\nThe transport of a tangent vector \\(v_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) to an infinitesimally nearby point \\(q\\) results in the tangent vector \\(v_{q}\\) at \\(q\\), namely,\n\n\\[\\tag{3} v_{q} = v_{p} + dv_{p}. \\]\n\nThis infinitesimal tangent vector transport Weyl defines as infinitesimal parallel displacement if and only if there exists a coordinate system \\(\\overline{x}\\), called a geodesic coordinate system for the neighborhood of \\(p\\), relative to which the transported tangent vector \\(\\overline{v}_{q}\\) at \\(q\\) possesses the same components as the original tangent vector \\(\\overline{v}_{p}\\) at \\(p\\); that is,\n\n\\[\\tag{4} \\overline{v}^{\\,i}_q - \\overline{v}^{\\,i}_p = d\\overline{v}^{\\,i}_p = 0. \\]\n\nFigure 1: Parallel transport in a geodesic coordinate system \\(\\overline{x}\\)\n\nFor an arbitrary coordinate system \\(x\\) the components \\(dv^{\\,i}_p\\) vanish whenever \\(v^{\\,i}_p\\) or \\(dx^{\\,i}_p\\) vanish.

A notion of “parallelism” is not something that a manifold would possess merely by virtue of being a smooth manifold; additional structure has to be introduced which resides on the manifold and which permits the notion of infinitesimal parallelism. A manifold is an “affine manifold” \\((M, \\Gamma)\\) if in addition to its manifold structure (differential topological structure) it is also endowed with an affine structure \\(\\Gamma\\) that assigns to each of its points 64 coefficients \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk} (x^{i}(p))\\) satisfying the symmetry condition \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk} (x^{i}(p)) = \\Gamma^{i}_{kj} (x^{i}(p))\\).\n\nAn \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold \\(M\\), which is an affinely connected manifold, Weyl (1918b) interprets physically as an \\(n\\)-dimensional world (spacetime) filled with a gravitational field. Weyl says, “…the affine connection appears in physics as the gravitational field…” Since there exists at each spacetime point a geodesic coordinate system in which the components \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk}\\) of the symmetric linear connection vanish, the gravitational field can be made to vanish at each point of the manifold.\n\nThe classical theory of physical geometry, developed by Helmholtz, Poincaré and Hilbert, regarded the concept of “metric congruence” as the only basic relation of geometry, and constructed physical geometry from this one notion alone in terms of the relative positions and displacements of physical congruence standards. Although Einstein’s general theory of relativity championed a dynamical view of spacetime geometry that is very different from the classical theory of physical geometry, Einstein initially approached the problem of the structure of spacetime from the metrical point of view. It was Weyl (1923b) who emphasized and developed the metric-independent construction of the symmetric linear connection and who pointed out the rationale for doing so. In both the non-relativistic and relativistic contexts, it is the symmetric linear connection, and not the metric, which plays the essential role in the formulation of all physical laws that are expressed in terms of differential equations. It is the symmetric linear connection that relates the state of a system at a spacetime point to the states at neighboring spacetime events and enters into the differentials of the corresponding magnitudes. In both Newtonian physics and the theory of general relativity, all dynamical laws presuppose the projective and affine structure and hence the Law of Inertia. In fact, the whole of tensor analysis with its covariant derivatives is based on the affine concept of infinitesimal parallel displacement and not on the metric.\n\nWeyl’s metric independent construction not only led to a deeper understanding of the mathematical characterization of gravity, it also prepared the way for new constructions and generalizations in differential geometry and the general theory of relativity. In particular, it led to\n\nThe development of the geometry of paths, first introduced by Weyl in 1918.\n\nWeyl’s discovery of the causal-inertial method which prepared the way to empirically determine the spacetime metric in a non-circular, non-conventional manner.\n\nWeyl’s generalization of Riemannian geometry in his attempt to unify gravity and electromagnetism.\n\nWeyl’s introduction of the concept of gauge in the context of his attempt to unify gravity and electromagnetism.\n\nFor more detail on Weyl’s metric independent construction of the affine connection (linear symmetric connection), see the supplement.\n\n4.1.2 Projective Geometry or the Geometry of Paths\n\nWeyl’s metric-independent construction of the affine structure led to the development of differential projective geometries or the geometries of paths. The interest in projective geometry is in the paths, that is, in the continuous set of points of the image set of curves, rather than in the possible parameter descriptions of curves. A curve has one degree of freedom; it depends on one parameter, and its image set or path is a one-dimensional continuous set of points of the manifold. One represents a curve on a manifold \\(M\\) as a smooth map (i.e., \\(C^{\\infty})\\) \\(\\gamma\\) from some open interval \\(I = (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)\\) of the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) into \\(M\\).\n\nFigure 3: A curve on the manifold \\(M\\) is the smooth map \\(\\gamma : I \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow M\\)\n\nIt is important to understand that what one means by a “curve” is the map (the parametric description) itself, and not the set of its image points, the path. Consequently, two curves are mathematically considered to be different curves if they are given by different maps (different parameter descriptions), even if their image set, that is, their path, is the same. If we change a curve’s parameter description we change the curve but not its image set (its path), the points it passes through. A path is therefore sometimes defined as an equivalence class of curves under arbitrary parameter transformations. Hence, projective geometry may be defined as an equivalence class of affine geometries.\n\nA geodesic curve in flat space is a straight line. Its tangent at one point is parallel to the tangent at previous or subsequent points. A straight line in Euclidean space is the only curve that parallel-transports its own tangent vector. This notion of parallel transport of the tangent vector also characterizes geodesic curves in curved space. That is, a curve \\(\\gamma\\) in curved space, which parallel-transports its own tangent vector along all of its points, is called a geodesic curve. Given a manifold with an affine structure and some arbitrary local coordinate system, the coordinate functions (components) \\(\\gamma^{i}\\) of a geodesic curve \\(\\gamma\\) satisfy the second-order non-linear differential equations\n\n\\[\\tag{6} \\frac{d^2\\gamma^i}{ds^2} + \\Gamma^{i}_{jk} \\frac{d\\gamma^j}{ds} \\frac{d\\gamma^k}{ds} = 0. \\]\n\nOne may characterize the projective geometry \\(\\Pi\\) on an affine manifold either in terms of an equivalence class of geodesic curves under arbitrary parameter diffeomorphisms[40], thereby eliminating all the parameter descriptions and hence all possible notions of distance along the curves satisfying (6),[41] or one may take the process of autoparallelism of directions as fundamental in defining a projective structure.\n\nFigure 4: A path \\(\\xi\\) is an equivalence class [\\(\\gamma\\)] of curves under all parameter diffeomorphisms \\(\\mu: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}; \\lambda \\mapsto \\mu(\\lambda)\\)\n\nWeyl took the latter approach. According to Weyl, the infinitesimal process of parallel displacements of vectors contains, as a special case, the infinitesimal displacement of a direction into its own direction. Such an infinitesimal autoparallelism of directions is characteristic of the projective structure of an affinely connected manifold.\n\nInfinitesimal Autoparallelism of a Direction:\n\nAn infinitesimal autoparallelism of a direction \\(R\\) at an arbitrary point \\(p\\) consists in the parallel displacement of \\(R\\) at \\(p\\) to a neighbouring point \\(p'\\) which lies in the direction \\(R\\) at \\(p\\).\n\nA curve is geodesic if and only if its tangent direction \\(R\\) experiences infinitesimal autoparallelism when moved along all the points of the curve. This characterization of a geodesic curve constitutes an abstraction from affine geometry. Through this abstraction, a geodesic curve is definable exclusively in terms of autoparallelism of tangent directions, and not tangent vectors. Roughly speaking, an affine geometry is essentially a projective geometry with the notion of distance defined along the curves. By eliminating all possible notions of distance along curves, or equivalently, all the parameter descriptions of the curves, one abstracts the projective geometry form affine geometry.\n\nAs mentioned above, a projective geometry \\(\\Pi\\) may be defined as an equivalence class of affine geometries, that is, an equivalence class of projectively related affine connections [\\(\\Gamma\\)]. Weyl presented the details of his approach to projective geometry, which uses the notion of autoparallelism of direction, in a set of lectures delivered in Barcelona and Madrid in the spring of 1922 (Weyl (1923a); see also Weyl (1921c)). Weyl began with the following necessary and sufficient condition for the invariance of the projective structure \\(\\Pi\\) under a transformation \\(\\Gamma \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Gamma}\\) of the affine structure:\n\nProjective Transformation:\n\nA transformation \\(\\Gamma \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Gamma}\\) preserves the projective structure \\(\\Pi\\) of a manifold with an affine structure \\(\\Gamma\\), and is called a projective transformation, if and only if\n\n\\[\\tag{7} (\\overline{\\Gamma} - \\Gamma)^i_{jk} v^{\\,j}v^{\\,k} \\propto v^{\\,i}, \\]\n\nwhere \\(v^{\\,i}\\) is an arbitrary vector.\n\nWeyl’s definition says that a change in the affine structure of the manifold \\(M\\) preserves the projective structure \\(\\Pi\\) of \\(M\\) if the vectors \\(v^{i}_{q}\\) and \\(\\overline{v}^{i}_{q}\\) at \\(q\\) that result from the vector \\(v^{i}_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) by parallel transport under \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\overline{\\Gamma}\\) respectively, differ at most in length but not in direction.[42]\n\nA spacetime manifold \\(M\\) is a “projective manifold” (M, \\(\\Pi)\\), if in addition to its manifold structure (differential topological structure), it is also endowed with a projective structure \\(\\Pi\\) that assigns to each of its manifold points 64 coefficients \\(\\Pi^{\\,i}_{jk} x^{i}(p))\\) satisfying certain symmetry conditions.[43] These projective coefficients characterize the equivalence class [\\(\\Gamma\\)] of projectively equivalent connections, that is, connections equivalent under the projective transformation (7).\n\nIn physical spacetime the projective structure has an immediate intuitive significance according to Weyl. The real world is a non-empty spacetime filled with an inertial-gravitational field, which Weyl calls the guiding field \\((F\\)ührungsfeld)[44]. It is an indubitable fact, according to Weyl (1923a, 13), that a body which is let free in a certain spacetime direction (time-like direction) carries out a uniquely determined natural motion from which it can only be diverted through an external force. The process of autoparallelism of direction appears, thus, as the tendency of persistence of the spacetime direction of a free particle whose motion is governed by, what Weyl calls, the guiding field \\((F\\)ührungsfeld). This natural motion occurs on the basis of an effective infinitesimal tendency of persistence, that parallelly displaces the spacetime direction \\(R\\) of a body at an arbitrary point \\(p\\) on its trajectory to a neighbouring point \\(p'\\) that lies in the direction \\(R\\) at \\(p\\).\n\nIf external forces exert themselves on a body, then a motion results which is determined through the conflict between the tendency of persistence due to the guiding field and the force. The tendency of persistence of the guiding field is a type of constraining guidance, that the inertial-gravitational field exerts on every body. Weyl (1923b, 219) says:\n\nGalilei’s inertial law shows, that there exists a type of constraining guidance in the world [spacetime] that imposes on a body that is let free in some definite world direction a unique natural motion from which it can only be diverted through external forces; this occurs on the basis of an effective infinitesimal tendency of persistence from point to point, that auto-parallelly transfers the world direction \\(r\\) of the body at an arbitrary point \\(P\\) to an infinitesimally close neighboring point \\(P'\\), that lies in the direction \\(r\\) at \\(P\\).\n\n4.1.3 Conformal Geometry, Weyl Geometry, and Weyl’s Unified Field Theory\n\nShortly after the completion of the general theory of relativity in 1915, Einstein, Weyl, and others began to work on a unified field theory. It was natural to assume at that time[45] that this task would only involve the unification of gravity and electromagnetism. In Einstein’s geometrization of gravity, the Newtonian gravitational potential, and the Newtonian gravitational force, are respectively replaced by the components of the metric tensor \\(g_{ij}(x)\\), and the components of the symmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma^{i}_{jk}(x)\\). In the general theory of relativity the gravitational field is thus accounted for in terms of the curvature of spacetime, but the electromagnetic field remains completely unrelated to the spacetime geometry. Einstein’s mathematical formulation of his theory of general relativity does not, however, provide room for the geometrization of the other long range force field, the electromagnetic field.[46] It was therefore natural to ask whether nature’s only two long range fields of force have a common origin. Consequently, it was quite natural to suggest that the electromagnetic field might also be ascribed to some property of spacetime, instead of being merely something embedded in spacetime. Since, however, the components \\(g_{ij}(x)\\) of the metric tensor are already sufficiently determined by Einstein’s field equations, this would require setting up a more general differential geometry than the one which underlies Einstein’s theory, in order to make room for incorporating electromagnetism into spacetime geometry. Such a generalized differential geometry would describe both long range forces, and a new theory based on this geometry would constitute a unified field theory of electromagnetism and gravitation.\n\nIn 1918, Weyl proposed such a theory. In Weyl (1918a, 1919a), and in the third edition (1920) of Raum-Zeit-Materie, Weyl presented his ingenious attempt to unify gravitation and electromagnetism by constructing a gauge-invariant geometry (see below), or what he called a purely infinitesimal ‘metric’ geometry. Since the conformal structure \\(C\\) (see below) of spacetime does not determine a unique symmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma\\) but only an equivalence class \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of conformally equivalent symmetric linear connections, Weyl was able to show that this degree of freedom in a conformal structure of spacetime provides just enough room for the geometrization of the electromagnetic potentials. The resulting geometry, called a Weyl geometry, is an intermediate geometric structure that lies between the conformal and Riemannian structures.\n\nThe metric tensor field that is locally described by\n\n\\[\\tag{8} ds^{2} = g_{ij}(x(p))dx^{i}dx^{j}, \\]\n\nis characteristic of a Riemannian geometry. That geometry requires of the symmetric linear connection \\(\\Gamma\\) that the infinitesimal parallel transport of a vector always preserves the length of the vector. Therefore, the metric field in Riemannian geometry determines a unique symmetric linear connection, a “metric connection” that satisfies the length-preserving condition of parallel transport. This means that the metric field, locally represented by (8), is invariant under parallel transport. The coefficients of this unique symmetric linear metric connection are given by\n\n\\[\\tag{9} \\Gamma^i_{jk} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{ir}(g_{rj,k} + g_{kr,j} - g_{jk,r}). \\]\n\nIf \\(v_{p}\\) is a vector at \\(p \\in M\\), its length\n\n\\[\\tag{10} \\lvert v_p \\rvert^2 = g_{ij}(x(p))v^{\\,i}_p v^{\\,j}_p. \\]\n\nMoreover, the angle between two vectors \\(v_{p}\\) and \\(w_{p}\\) at \\(p\\in M\\) is given by\n\n\\[\\tag{11} \\cos \\theta = \\frac{g_{ij}(x(p))v^{\\,i}_p w^{\\,j}_p}{\\lvert v_p \\rvert \\lvert w_p \\rvert}. \\]\n\nWhile in Riemannian geometry the parallel transport of length is path independent, that is, it is possible to compare the lengths of any two vectors, even if they are located at two finitely different points, a vector suffers a path-dependent change in direction under parallel transport; that is, it is not possible to define the angle between two vectors, located at different points, in a path-independent way. Consequently, the angle between two vectors at a given point is invariant under parallel transport if and only if both vectors are transported along the same path. In particular, a vector which is carried around a closed circuit by a continual parallel displacement back to the starting point, will have the same length, but will not in general return to its initial direction.\n\nFigure 5: The parallel transport of a vector by a two-dimensional creature, from \\(A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow A\\) around a geodesic triangle on a two-dimensional surface \\(S^{2}\\), ends up pointing in a different direction upon returning to \\(A\\).\n\nFor a closed loop which circumscribes an infinitesimally small portion of space, the rotation of the vector per unit area constitutes the measure of the local curvature of space. Consequently, whether or not finite parallel displacement of direction is integrable, that is, path-independent, depends on whether or not the curvature tensor vanishes.\n\nAccording to Weyl, Riemannian geometry, is not a pure or genuine infinitesimal differential (metric) geometry, since it permits the comparison of length at a finite distance. In his seminal 1918 paper entitled Gravitation und Elektrizität (Gravitation and Electricity) Weyl (1918a) says:\n\nHowever, in the Riemannian geometry described above, there remains a last distant-geometric [ferngeometrisches] element—without any sound reason, as far as I can see; the only cause of this appears to be the development of Riemannian geometry from the theory of surfaces. The metric permits the comparison of length of two vectors not only at the same point, but also at any arbitrarily separated points. A true near-geometry (Nahegeometrie), however, may recognize only a principle of transferring a length at a point to an infinitesimal neighbouring point, and then it is no more reasonable to assume that the transfer of length from a point to a finitely distant point is integrable, then it was to assume that the transfer of direction is integrable.\n\nWeyl wanted a metric geometry which would not permit distance comparison of length between two vectors located at finitely different points. In a pure infinitesimal geometry, Weyl argued, if attention is restricted to a single point of the manifold, then some standard of length or gauge must be chosen arbitrarily before the lengths of vectors can be determined. Therefore, all that is intrinsic to the notion of a pure infinitesimal metric differential geometry is the ability to determine the ratios of the lengths of any two vectors and the angle between any two vectors, at a point. And because we can determine the angle between any two vectors at a point, such a pure infinitesimal metric manifold must have at least a conformal structure \\(C\\).[47]\n\nThe defining characteristic of a conformal spacetime structure is given by the equation\n\n\\[\\tag{12} 0 = ds^2 = g_{ij}(x(p))dx^i dx^{\\,j}, \\]\n\nwhich determines the light cone at \\(p\\). A gauge transformation of the metric is a map\n\n\\[ g_{ij}(x(p)) \\rightarrow \\lambda(x(p))g_{ij}(x(p)) = \\overline{g}_{ij}(x(p)), \\]\n\nwhich preserves the metric up to a positive and smooth but otherwise arbitrary scalar factor or gauge function \\(\\lambda(x(p))\\). In the case of a pseudo-Riemannian structure such a gauge transformation leaves the light cones unaltered. The angle between two vectors at \\(p\\) is given by (11). Clearly, the gauge transformation \\(\\overline{g}_{ij}(x(p)) = \\lambda(x(p))g_{ij}(x(p))\\) is angle preserving, that is, conformal. Two metrics which are related by a conformal gauge transformation are called conformally equivalent. A conformal structure does not determine the length of any one vector at a point. Only the relative lengths, the ratio of lengths, of any two vectors \\(\\bfrac{\\lvert v_p \\rvert}{\\lvert w_p \\rvert}\\) is determined.\n\nWeyl exploited these features of the conformal structure, and suggested that given a conformal structure, a gauge could be chosen at each point in a smooth but otherwise arbitrary manner, such that the metric (8) at any point of the manifold is conventional or undetermined to the extent that the metric\n\n\\[\\tag{13} d\\overline{s}^2 = \\lambda(x(p))g_{ij}(x(p))dx^{i}dx^{\\,j} \\]\n\nis equally valid.\n\nHowever, a conformal structure by itself does not determine a unique symmetric linear connection; it only determines an equivalence class of conformally equivalent connections \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\), namely, connections which preserve the conformal structure \\(C\\) during parallel transport. The difference between any two conformally equivalent symmetric linear connections \\(\\overline{\\Gamma}^{\\,i}_{jk}\\), \\(\\Gamma^i_{jk} \\in [\\Gamma]\\) is given by\n\n\\[\\tag{14} \\overline{\\Gamma}^{\\,i}_{jk} - \\Gamma^i_{jk} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{\\,i}_j \\theta_k + \\delta^{\\,i}_k \\theta_j - g_{jk}g^{ir}\\theta_{r}), \\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\\tag{15} \\theta_{j}(x(p))dx^{\\,j} \\]\n\nis an arbitrary one-form field.\n\nSince the conformal structure determines only an equivalence class of conformally equivalent symmetric linear connections \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\), the affine connection in this type of geometry is not uniquely determined, and the parallel transport of vectors is not generally well defined. Moreover, the ratio of the lengths of two vectors located at different points is not determined even in a path-dependent way. According to Weyl, it is a fundamental principle of infinitesimal geometry that the metric structure on a manifold \\(M\\) determines a unique affine structure on \\(M\\). As was pointed out earlier, this principle is satisfied in Riemannian geometry where the metric determines a unique symmetric linear connection, namely, the metric connection according to (9). Evidently this fundamental principle of infinitesimal geometry is not satisfied for a structure which is merely a conformal structure, since the conformal structure only determines an equivalence class of conformally equivalent symmetric connections. Weyl showed that besides the conformal structure an additional structure is required in order to determine a unique symmetric linear connection from the equivalence class \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of conformally equivalent symmetric linear connections. Weyl showed that this additional structure is provided by the length connection or gauge field \\(A_{j}\\) that governs the congruent displacement of lengths. Weyl called this additional structure the “metric connection” on a manifold; however, we shall use the term “length connection” instead, in order to avoid confusion with the modern usage of the term “metric connection”, which today denotes the symmetric linear connection that is uniquely determined by a Riemannian metric tensor according to (9).\n\nWeyl’s Length Connection:\n\nA point \\(p\\) is length connected with its infinitesimal neighborhood, if and only if for every length at \\(p\\), there is determined at every point \\(q\\) infinitesimally close to \\(p\\) a length to which the length at \\(p\\) gives rise when it is congruently displaced from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\).\n\nThis definition merely says that a manifold is “length connected” if it admits the process of infinitesimal congruent displacement of length. The only condition imposed on the concept of congruent displacement of length is the following:\n\nCongruent Displacement of Length:\n\nWith respect to a choice of gauge for a neighborhood of \\(p\\), the transport of a length \\(l_{p}\\) at \\(p\\) to an infinitesimally neighboring point \\(q\\) constitutes a congruent displacement if and only if there exists a choice of gauge for the neighborhood of \\(p\\) relative to which the transported length \\(\\overline{l}_{q}\\) has the same value as \\(\\overline{l}_{p}\\); that is\n\n\\[\\tag{16} \\overline{l}_q - \\overline{l}_p = d\\overline{l}_p = 0. \\]\n\nWeyl called such a gauge at \\(p\\) a geodesic gauge at \\(p\\).[48] Weyl’s proof of the following theorem closely parallels the proof of theorem A.3 in the supplement on Weyl’s metric independent construction of the affine connection.\n\nTheorem 4.1:\n\nIf for every point \\(p\\) in a neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(M\\), there exists a choice of gauge such that the change in an arbitrary length at \\(p\\) under congruent displacement to an infinitesimally near point \\(q\\) is given by\n\n\\[\\tag{17} d\\overline{l}_p = 0, \\]\n\nthen locally with respect to any other choice of gauge,\n\n\\[\\tag{18} dl = -lA_j(x(p))dx^{\\,j}, \\]\n\nand conversely.\n\nMaking use of\n\n\\[\\begin{align} dv^{\\,i}_p &= -\\Gamma^i_{jk}(x(p))v^{\\,j}_pdx^k \\\\ l_p &= g_{ij}(x(p))v^{\\,i}_p v^{\\,j}_p \\\\ dl_p &= -l_p A_j x(p)dx^{\\,j}, \\end{align}\\]\n\nWeyl (1923a, 124–125) shows that the conformal structure supplemented with the structure of a length connection or gauge field \\(A_{j}(x)\\) singles out a unique connection from the equivalence class \\(K = [\\Gamma]\\) of conformally equivalent connections.[49] This unique connection, which is called the Weyl connection, is given by\n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\Gamma^{\\,i}_{jk} &= \\frac{1}{2}g^{ir}(g_{rj,k} + g_{kr,j} - g_{jk,r}) +\\frac{1}{2} g^{ir}(g_{rj}A_{k} + g_{kr}A_{j} - g_{jk}A_{r}) \\\\ \\tag{19} &= \\frac{1}{2}g^{ir}(g_{rj,k} + g_{kr,j} - g_{jk,r}) +\\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{\\,i}_j A_{k} + \\delta^{\\,i}_k A_{j} - g_{jk}g^{ir}A_{r}), \\end{align}\\]\n\nwhich is analogous to (14). The first term of the Weyl connection is identical to the metric connection (9) of Riemannian geometry, whereas the second term represents what is new in a Weyl geometry. The Weyl connection is invariant under the gauge transformation\n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\overline{g}_{ij}(x) &= e^{\\theta(x)}g_{ij}(x) \\\\ \\tag{20} \\overline{A}_j(x) &= A_j(x) - \\partial_j \\theta(x), \\end{align}\\]\n\nwhere the gauge function is \\(\\lambda(x) = e^{\\theta(x)}\\). Thus, a conformal structure plus length connection or gauge field \\(A_{j}(x)\\) determines a Weyl geometry equipped with a unique Weyl connection. Therefore, the fundamental principle of infinitesimal geometry also holds in a Weyl geometry; that is, the metric structure of a Weyl geometry determines a unique affine connection, namely, the Weyl connection.\n\nIn Weyl’s physical interpretation of his purely infinitesimal metric geometry (Weyl geometry), the gauge field \\(A_{j}(x)\\) is identified with the electromagnetic four potential, and the electromagnetic field tensor is given by\n\n\\[\\tag{21} F_{jk}(x) = \\partial_{j} A_{k}(x) - \\partial_{k} A_{j}(x). \\]\n\nA spacetime that is formally characterizable as a Weyl geometry, would not only have a curvature of direction (Richtungskrümmung) but would also have a curvature of length (Streckenkrümmung). Because of the latter property the formal characterization of the congruent displacement of length would be non-integrable, that is, path-dependent, in a Weyl geometry.\n\nFigure 6: In a Weyl geometry parallel displacement of a vector along different paths not only changes its direction but also its length\n\nSuppose physical spacetime corresponds to a Weyl geometry. Then two identical clocks \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at an event \\(p\\) with a common unit of time, that is, a timelike vector of given length \\(l_{p}\\), which are separated and moved along different world lines to an event \\(q\\), will not only differ with respect to the elapsed time (first clock effect (i.e., relativistic effect)), but in general the clocks will differ with respect to their common unit of time (rate of ticking) at \\(q\\) (second clock effect). That is, congruent time displacement in a Weyl geometry is such that two congruent time intervals at \\(p\\) will not in general be congruent at \\(q\\), when congruently displaced in parallel along different world lines from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\), that is, \\(l^{A}_{q} \\ne l^{B}_{q}\\). This means that a twin who travels to a distant star and then returns to earth would not only discover that the other twin on earth had aged much more, but also that all the clocks on earth tick at a different rate. Hence, in the presence of a non-vanishing electromagnetic field \\(F_{jk}(x)\\) the clock rates will not in general be the same; that is, there will be a second clock effect in addition to the relativistic effect (first clock effect). Thus, \\(l^{A}_{q} = l^{B}_{q}\\) if and only if the curl of \\(A_{j}(x)\\) vanishes, that is, if and only if the electromagnetic field tensor \\(F_{jk}(x)\\) vanishes, namely,\n\n\\[ F_{jk}(x) = \\partial_{j} A_{k}(x) - \\partial_{k} A_{j}(x) = 0. \\]\n\nIn that case the second term of the Weyl connection vanishes and (19) reduces to the metric connection (9) of Riemannian geometry.\n\nIn a Weyl geometry there are no ideal absolute “meter sticks” or “clocks”. For example, the rate at which any clock measures time is a function of its history. However, as Einstein pointed out in a Nachtrag (addendum) to Weyl (1918a), it is precisely this situation which suggests that Weyl’s geometry conflicts with experience. In Weyl’s geometry, the frequency of the spectral lines of atomic clocks would depend on the location and past histories of the atoms. But experience indicates otherwise. The spectral lines are well-defined and sharp; they appear to be independent of an atom’s history. Atomic clocks define units of time, and experience shows they are integrably transported. Thus, if we assume that the atomic time and the gravitational standard time are identical, and that the gravitational standard time is determined by the Weyl geometry, then the electromagnetic field tensor is zero. But if that is the case, then a Weyl geometry reduces to the standard Riemannian geometry that underlies general relativity, since the vanishing of Weyl’s Streckenkrümmung (length curvature) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a Riemannian metric \\(g_{ij}\\).\n\nWhen quantum theory was developed a few years later it became clear that Weyl’s theory was in conflict with experience in an even more fundamental way since there is a direct relation between clock rates and masses of particles in quantum theory. A particle with a certain rest mass \\(m\\) possesses a natural frequency which is a function of its rest mass, the speed of light \\(c\\), and Planck’s constant \\(h\\). This means that in a Weyl geometry not only clocks would depend on their histories but also the masses of particles. For example, if two protons have different histories then they would also have different masses in a Weyl geometry. But this violates the quantum mechanical principle that particles of the same kind—in this case, protons—have to be exactly identical.\n\nHowever, in 1918 it was still possible for Weyl to defend his theory in the following way. In response to Einstein’s criticism Weyl noted that atoms, clocks and meter sticks are complex objects whose real behavior in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields can only be inferred from a dynamical theory of matter. Since no detailed and reliable dynamical models were available at that time, Weyl could argue that there is no reason to assume that, for example, clock rates are correctly modelled by t"
