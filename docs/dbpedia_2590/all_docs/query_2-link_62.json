        "text": "Applied Biosafety Editorial Board - June 2024\n\nCoeditors-in-Chief: Barbara Johnson and Karen Byers\n\nApplied Biosafety successfully solicited an exceptional number of high-quality manuscript submissions for the forthcoming Special Issue on Biosafety and Biosecurity for Synthetic Genomics. We are pleased to report that the Special Issue will be featured over two full volumes (Volume 29, Number 2 and Volume 29, Number 3). In addition, generous support has been provided by Open Philanthropy to provide Open Access for each of the manuscripts in the Special Issue. A sincere thank you to our special Guest Editors who spearheaded this effort and made it a success, Dr. Rocco Casagrande (Gryphon Scientific) and Dr. Sarah Carter (Science Policy Consulting), plus David Gillum and Scott Patlovich.\n\nWe are also planning a Special Issue in 2025 focusing on Potential Pandemic Pathogens and Dual Use Research of Concern. We are pleased to announce that Dr. George Poste and Dr. Filippa Lentzos will serve as special Guest Editors for this project. Dr. Poste is the Chief Scientist of the Complex Adaptive Systems Initiative and Regents Professor and Del E. Webb Chair in Health Innovation at Arizona State University. Dr. Lentzos is an Associate Professor in Science & International Security and Director of MA in Science & International Security in the Department of War Studies and the Department of Global Health & Social Medicine at King’s College London. They will join Barbara Johnson and David Gillum for this Special Issue. Please visit liebertpub.com to view the call for papers.\n\nOperationally, we have recently worked with our publisher, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., who has transitioned to a new production vendor, KnowledgeWorks Global Ltd. (KGL). KGL brings advanced tools and technologies, and expertise in academic publishing and production processes. Their production management is extensive and modern, and they will help optimize workflows, improve efficiency, and streamline the proofing and production of manuscripts for our journal. This transition represents an exciting opportunity to enhance our publishing capabilities—including web-based manuscript proofs to authors and faster time to online publication.\n\nPreconference Course Committee - June 2024\n\nCo-Chairs: Geoff Phillips and Ray Scheetz\n\nThe Preconference Course Committee recently added two new members.

The Guest Editors for the special issue are Drs. Sarah R. Carter and Rocco Casagrande. They have provided substantial assistance to the APB Associate Editors Scott J. Patlovich and David R. Gillum with identification of experts in the field, manuscript recruitment, and review. To date, there have been 14 manuscript submissions from more than 30 authors on a range of topics, including: safeguarding mail-order DNA, genetic biocontainment technologies, regulatory interpretation and guidance for genomic synthesis screening, biosecurity practices for synthetic DNA providers, biosecurity risk assessments for AI in synthetic biology, cyberbiosecurity for desktop synthesis devices, and much more. Depending on how many articles are found suitable and accepted, there could be two themed issues of the journal dedicated to these topics. The Coeditors-in-Chief, Barbara Johnson and Karen Byers, are working closely with the Associate Editors to meet deadlines for publication and would like to express their sincerest thanks to all the authors and reviewers for the special issue.\n\nJournal – Applied Biosafety - September 2023\n\nCoeditors-in-Chief: Barbara Johnson and Karen Byers\n\nAssociate Editors: David Gillum and Scott Patlovich\n\nWe are pleased to announce that Applied Biosafety (APB) has recently achieved several notable landmarks. First, the journal recently received its first published Journal Impact Factor (JIF) of 1.5. This metric recognizes that the journal is part of a globally recognized, selective database of scholarly journals. There were over 66,000 article downloads between January and June 2023, a 27% increase from January to June 2022. In addition, Scopus announced the 2022 Cite index for APB articles published was 2.2 an increase of 47% from 2021. APB has been fully searchable in Pub Med Central for the past year. Between January and June 2023, APB's reviews were completed with a median 25-day response to the first decision and 53 days to final decision. To promote biosafety awareness and education to the broader scientific and policymaking community, free access to seven research articles was provided for a limited time, and an additional eight articles were made Open Access. The outstanding manuscripts, and the support provided by the editorial board and publication team, enabled the achievement of these goals.\n\nIn 2023, LaTonya Clay was awarded the prestigious annual recognition for the Best Paper by Women and Underrepresented Minorities for her work published in APB. The award is presented by the Rosalind Franklin Society in partnership with Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. Dr. Clay’s manuscript, “Monitoring Laboratory Occupational Exposures to Burkholderia pseudomallei” provided valuable and actionable information to inform decisions regarding the prevention of laboratory exposures and subsequent laboratory acquired infections.\n\nA special issue is under development for publication in 2024 focusing on examining the potential risks posed by synthetic genomics technologies and proposed mitigation efforts. It will review existing and forthcoming government policies to determine if there are gaps that still need to be addressed and consider the role of biosafety and biosecurity experts in the development of policies and guidance. The deadline for manuscript submission is December 1, 2023, please see the following link https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/apb.2023.29011.cfp.\n\nLearning Verification Committee - September 2023\n\nChair: Niki Drazenovich\n\nCo-Chair: Matt Fischer\n\nABSA members currently have eight quizzes available online for CM points and 11 quizzes in development.

The Board also reviewed application for the Registered Biosafety Professional (RBP) credential on an ongoing basis. The Board would like to remind applicants to provide enough narrative regarding your biosafety program management to allow them to grant you the amount of service credit you request. Adding elements that do not support biosafety (e.g., chemical or radiation safety efforts) does not help the Board evaluate an applicant fairly, will delay their decision and may result in the application being returned for clarification.\n\nCredentialing Evaluation Board - January 2023\n\nChair: Paul Meechan\n\nCo-Chair: John Henneman\n\nThe Credentialing Evaluation Board (CEB) continues to meet at least monthly (frequently more than once per month) to review applications for certification as Registered Biosafety Professionals (RBP) and Certified Biological Safety Professionals (CBSP). This fall, the Board made minor revisions to the CBSP forms for candidates to improve the function of the forms and to ensure that applicants understood that they needed more than 50% of their time working on biosafety issues for their time to count towards the CBSP. As a reminder, the Board requires the use of the new forms and any person submitting a request with the old form will have their application returned. The deadline for submitting all materials required for the 2023 CBSP examination is 01 February 2023.\n\nCredentialing Maintenance Board (CMB) - January 2023\n\nChair: Hallie Hoskins\n\nCo-Chair: Rhonda O’Keefe\n\nThe Credentialing Maintenance Board (CMB) welcomes new member Heidi Page and the transition of new chair Hallie Hoskins beginning in the new year.

As of January 1, 2023, courses taken from this date forward, will receive the following (CM points per hour for attendee): 0.125 CM points for 1-<2 hours; 0.25 CM points for 2-<3 hours; 0.5 CM points for 3-<5 hours; 0.75 CM points for 5-<6 hours (this was 0.5 CM points previously); 1 CM point for 6-8 hours.\n\nThe CMB would like to remind all CBSPs and RBPs of the requirement to recertify their credentials. A great tool to have at the ready when completing the Credentialing is the Credentialing Maintenance Program Guide. The CMB will begin to review the re-credentialing applications for the 2018-2022 cycle in January 2023. The deadline for worksheet submission is February 1! If you are not sure of your cycle assignment, please refer to the CBSP/RBP CM Cycle Assignments listed on the credentialing page of the ABSA website. Credentialing Maintenance fees can be paid online under your member profile (you must be logged in to access).
