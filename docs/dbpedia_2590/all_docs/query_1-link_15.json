        "text": "Ashley Moritz traveled with education pioneers who developed collaborative teaching environments and standards for classroom management! She worked for educational researchers Rick DuFour, Robert Marzano, and other leading authors during Summer Institutes with Solution Tree. This experience was where she learned how to collect classroom data and how to be a part of a thriving Professional Learning Community (PLC).\n\nShe is able to apply her research and training to collaborate with her lower school colleagues to improve the classroom setting and uses positive reinforcement to reach her fifth grade students. She analyzes student data to create individualized learning experiences for them, such as similar subject-based book clubs. She connects with her students by leaving positive notes, recognizing good behavior and providing consistent feedback to their learning process.\n\nDr. Donn Headley is an amazing reader who has read a total of 5,000-6,000 books! He reads several books and articles a week for both lesson-planning and his own learning.\n\nHe shares that...\n\n▸ with Kenneth Grahame's 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘞𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘰𝘸𝘴 he wanted to be an English teacher (5th grade)\n\n▸ with Niccolo Machiavelli's 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘗𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘦, he wanted to be a Philosophy teacher (8th grade)\n\n▸ with Allan Nevins' 𝘖𝘳𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘭 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘜𝘯𝘪𝘰𝘯, he knew he wanted to be a History teacher (U.S. Army, year three).\n\nHe brings this passion for reading and love of history into the classroom to teach his upper school students. Dr. Headley teaches all three levels of Upper School United States History - Advanced Placement, Honors and College Preparatory.\n\nWhile Grace Ulrich is new to the Charlotte Christian faculty this year as a second grade teacher, she has served in elementary education for 16 years with a master's degree in education curriculum, instruction and assessment.\n\nMrs. Ulrich credits her involvement in the Charlotte Leadership Forum as being transformational for her life. She participated in the program with her husband to learn about living purposeful lives and how to lead in her marriage, family and work. Through the forum's small group Christian community, Mrs. Ulrich grew in her comfort to share her story and faith walk with others. She brings this experience into the classroom by creating a comfortable family environment and plants the seeds for students to learn and understand about their own faith story.\n\nRob Mina has extensive expertise in particle physics! He previously contributed to research projects on the neutrino experiment called NOvA at the University of Virginia and Fermilab (America's particle physics and accelerator laboratory). While starting to pursue his PhD at Stanford University, he spent time at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, one of the world's largest and most respected centers for scientific research, and contributed to the ongoing search for dark matter.\n\nMr. Mina teaches the following science classes at CCS. Through his real-world experience, he connects course content for his classes to the cutting-edge research he was involved in and encourages his students to individually explore beyond what's covered in the curriculum.\n\n▸ AP Computer Science A\n\n▸ AP Physics C: Mechanics\n\n▸ AP Statistics\n\n▸ Astronomy\n\n▸ Calculus III/AP Physics C: E&M\n\nHeather Wilson is one of the first certified Apple Learning Coaches. To be accepted into this pilot program, she completed more than 40 hours of training, including a workshop with Apple Education specialists. This certification has been instrumental in her work with Apple's productivity apps in her classroom and in the work she does with supporting middle school teachers as the division is 1:1 with Apple devices. In addition to serving as the middle school technology facilitator, Mrs. Wilson teaches Media Production, Genius Hour and MidKnight News."
