        "text": "Preface\n\nSources in Electrical History: Archives and Manuscript Collections in U.S. Repositories is the first in a series of guides to be issued by the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering. The goal of the series is two-fold--to promote research in electrical history by making scholars and students aware of the diverse collections of primary sources and to encourage the collection and preservation of these materials by archives and manuscript repositories. Volume 1 of Sources lists 1,008 collections in 158 repositories, primarily university archives and state historical societies. Future volumes will cover oral history collections in the U.S., U.S. business archives and private collections, and collections held in repositories outside of the United States.\n\nThis first volume of Sources in Electrical History has a history of its own. The guide traces its origins to a project undertaken by David A. Hounshell more than a decade ago. According to Hounshell, in December 1971 the initial meeting was held of the History of Electrical Technology Group--Society for the History of Technology. Discussion centered about the need for identification and preservation of source materials and artifacts related to electrical history. It was suggested that the Smithsonian Institution, already a major repository for electrical artifacts, serve as coordinating center for such a project.\n\nResponding to this suggestion, the Smithsonian's Division of Electricity and Nuclear Energy secured the cooperation of the History Committee of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and financial aid from the IEEE's Life Member Fund. The Archive for the History of Electrical Science and Technology was then established with the following objectives: (1) to encourage the preservation of artifacts and manuscripts by coordinating their collection and placement [and] (2) to maintain a national inventory of collections of artifacts and source materials for electrical history. [1]\n\nFocusing on collections reported to the National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections (NUCMC), with supplementary information obtained from various libraries and archives, Hounshell compiled Manuscripts in U.S. Depositories Relating to the History of Electrical Science and Technology, published in 1973. This guide listed about 250 collections and included descriptions of collection scope and content.\n\nBy 1980, however, Hounshell's guide needed updating. This became one of the first projects of the newly-founded Center for the History of Electrical Engineering at the IEEE. The process began as the Survey of Archives and Manuscript Collections Relating to Electrical Science and Technology (SAMCREST). Under the direction of Robert Friedel, the Center's first Director, David Rhees organized the survey in the summer of 1981. Supported by the IEEE Life Member Fund Graduate Summer Internship at the Center, Rhees researched the collections already listed by Hounshell, additional listings in NUCMC, collections cited in scholarly publications, and relevant repositories identified in the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's Directory of Archives and Manuscript Repositories. Rhees defined the scope of the project.\n\n...it was established that the principal goals for the summer would be to gather as much collection data as possible from published sources; to send out questionnaires to confirm our data and inquire about new collections; to identify finding aids and the procedures for obtaining them; to identify repositories interested in acquiring material in our subject area; and to promote archivists' awareness of electrical engineering history and of the role of the IEEE Center for the History of Electrical Engineering.[2]\n\nRhees's questionnaire was sent to 175 repositories. The returned questionnaires verified or corrected information on previously-listed collections, but, more important, they also included descriptions of a surprising number of additional collections.\n\nNancy Perlman, the Center's Archivist from 1981-82, and Robert Casey, Assistant Historian at the Center in 1983, organized the files of questionnaires and assisted researchers wishing to tap this source of raw data pending its availability as an online database. This next phase of the project was set up by Friedel, Joyce Bedi, the Center's Curator since 1983, and Cathy Paci, one of the Center's Research Assistants. During the summer of 1984, Paci entered basic information on over 1,000 collections into a database, while Bedi designed programs that would allow searching on a variety of levels.\n\nNext, collection descriptions were added to the database, and the long process of verifying, editing, proofing, and indexing this information for publication fell to Bedi, Ronald Kline, the Center's Director from 1984 to 1987, and a succession of Research Assistants, including Ann Benson, Suzan Walworth, and, especially, Craig Semsel. The subject index was prepared by Kline, while final editing, design, and the repository index were Bedi's responsibility. In addition, Jay Iorio, Manager of Information Systems for IEEE Standards, provided invaluable assistance in transferring the database from the Center's Victor 9000 computer to its Macintosh II, on which this guide was prepared.\n\nSources in Electrical History: Archives and Manuscript Collections in U.S. Repositories, therefore, was very much a team project. Three other groups were also members of this team--the IEEE Life Members, who have provided constant support of this work, through the Life Member Fund, for over 15 years, the archivists and librarians who responded to the initial survey in 1981 and to follow-up phone calls and letters, and the Friends of the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering, who funded publication of the guide. The Center staff, past and present, therefore, acknowledges their assistance, with gratitude.\n\nSee also: Sources in Electrical History 2: Oral History Collections in U.S. Repositories\n\nSee also: Sources in Electrical History 3: An International Guide to Corporate Records and Archives of Companies in the Electrical, Electronics, and Computer Industries\n\nA\n\nA001\n\nABBOTT, WILLIAM L., 1861-1951\n\nColl. # 1/20/9\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University Archives\n\nProfession: Chief Operating Engineer of Commonwealth Edison Co.\n\nDates of collection: 1871-1981\n\nSize: .7 cubic ft.\n\nAccess: unrestricted\n\nFinding aids: none\n\nIncludes photographs (1871-1935); university catalogues (1884-94); National Electric Construction Co.
