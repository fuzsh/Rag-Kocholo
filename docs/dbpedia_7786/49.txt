Jessen (Elster) is full of attractions from the tourist’s point of view. Plenty of medieval architecture including castles and churches will have aficionados on their knees in appreciation!

Check out the Jessen Castle, the moated beauty Hemsendorf, the Seyda Amtshaus, the Schweintz Amtshaus, and the St. Nicolai Church. Add to this the dark woods, the river front, the parks, and the historic town center and you have yourself a merry mix of all things nice. :-)

Jessen has a market place just like any other self-respecting historic German town does. Here’s where you find some of the best half-timbered homes around. This is also where you can explore the cobbled walks and make your way to some quaint cafes and little shops which somehow seem to overflow with stuff.

Jessen’s beautiful outdoors is magnified by the presence of the Amsdofer Mountains. This area is well worth visiting if you like being out in the sun. Check out the sky mountain, the lush pastoral meadow, and an old coal mine from the 19th century while you’re here.

You could also take to one of the various well-marked out trails that wind their way along the mountain to make your own discoveries.

Nearby is the Glücksburger Heide which is a conservation area with its own brand of leisure pursuits.

Jessen’s vineyards come together in celebration for the Wine Festival held in the castle grounds in August. Here’s where you get to taste all of the local wines and also see who gets to win the wine princess title for the year.

Then the well-known Schul- und Heimatfest (School and Home Festival), held on the second Sunday in August, is one you shouldn’t miss either.
