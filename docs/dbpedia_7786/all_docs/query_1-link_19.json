A role in cell adhesion of the carbohydrate moiety of these molecules has been attributed to the presence of N-glycans bearing the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope. On the other hand, it has been suggested that these glycoproteins could be ligands of an endogenous mannose-binding lectin present in myelin, the cerebellar soluble lectin (CSL). In order to further document the heterogeneity of the glycans of these two CAMs, we have used several probes: an anti-carbohydrate antibody of the HNK-1 type, called Elec-39, the plant lectin concanavalin A (ConA), and the endogenous lectin CSL involved in myelin compaction. This study shows that CSL binds to a small proportion of the polypeptide chains of MAG found in adult CNS of rats and man and the polypeptide chains of P0 molecules from adult human and rat sciatic nerve. For MAG from adult rat brain, the binding of CSL is restricted to glycans of polypeptide chains which could be separated from the others according to their solubility properties. These MAG molecular entities react also with the Elec-39 antibody and with ConA. These results confirm that P0 and MAG are heterogeneous in their carbohydrate moieties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPlasma exchanges for severe acute neurological deterioration in patients with IgM anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaron, M; Lozeron, P; Harel, S; Bengoufa, D; Vignon, M; Asli, B; Malphettes, M; Parquet, N; Brignier, A; Fermand, J P; Kubis, N; Arnulf, Bertrand\n\n2017-06-01\n\nMonoclonal IgM anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibody-related peripheral neuropathy (anti-MAG neuropathy) is predominantly a demyelinating sensory neuropathy with ataxia and distal paresthesia. The clinical course of anti-MAG neuropathy is usually slowly progressive making difficult the identification of clear criteria to start a specific treatment. Although no consensus treatment is yet available, a rituximab-based regimen targeting the B-cell clone producing the monoclonal IgM may be proposed, alone or in combination with alkylating agents or purine analogs. However, in some rare cases, an acute and severe neurological deterioration can occur in few days leading to a rapid loss of autonomy. In these cases, a treatment rapidly removing the monoclonal IgM from the circulation might be useful before initiating a specific therapy. We report successful treatment with plasma exchanges (PE) in four patients presenting with acute neurological deterioration. PE allowed a dramatic and rapid neurological improvement in all patients. PE are safe and may be useful at the initial management of these cases of anti-MAG neuropathy.\n\nUncompacted myelin lamellae in peripheral nerve biopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nVital, Claude; Vital, Anne; Bouillot, Sandrine; Favereaux, Alexandre; Lagueny, Alain; Ferrer, Xavier; Brechenmacher, Christiane; Petry, Klaus G\n\n2003-01-01\n\nSince 1979, the authors have studied 49 peripheral nerve biopsies presenting uncompacted myelin lamellae (UML). Based on the ultrastructural pattern of UML they propose a 3-category classification. The first category includes cases displaying regular UML, which was observed in 43 cases; it was more frequent in 9 cases with polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy m-protein skin changes (POEMS) syndrome as well as in 1 case of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B with a novel point mutation in the P0 gene. The second category consists of cases showing irregular UML, observed in 4 cases with IgM monoclonal gammopathy and anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) activity. This group included 1 benign case and 3 B-cell malignant lymphomas. The third category is complex UML, which was present in 2 unrelated patients with an Arg 98 His missense mutation in the P0 protein gene. Irregular and complex UML are respectively related to MAG and P0, which play a crucial role in myelin lamellae compaction and adhesion.\n\nBony fish myelin: evidence for common major structural glycoproteins in central and peripheral myelin of trout.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeserich, G; Waehneldt, T V\n\n1986-02-01\n\nPeripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin from the rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) banded at a density of 0.38 M sucrose. The main myelin proteins consisted of (1) two basic proteins, BPa and BPb (11,500 and 13,000 MW, similar to those of trout central nervous system (CNS) myelin proteins BP1 and BP2), and (2) two glycosylated components, IPb (24,400 MW) and IPc (26,200 MW). IPc comigrated with trout CNS myelin protein IP2 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas trout CNS myelin protein IP1 had a lower molecular weight (23,000). Following two-dimensional separation, however, both IPb and IPc from PNS showed two components; the more acidic component of IPc comigrated with IP2 from CNS. PNS tissue autolysis led to the formation of IPa (20,000 MW), consisting of two components in isoelectric focusing of which again the more acidic one comigrated with the CNS autolysis product IP0. Limited enzymatic digestion of isolated IP proteins from PNS and CNS led to closely similar degradation patterns, being most pronounced in the case of IP2 and IPc. Immunoblotting revealed that all IP components from trout PNS and CNS myelins reacted with antibodies to trout IP1 (CNS) and bovine P0 protein (PNS) whereas antibodies to rat PLP (CNS) were entirely unreactive. All BP components from trout PNS and CNS myelins bound to antibodies against human myelin basic protein. On the basis of these studies trout PNS and CNS myelins contain at least one common IP glycoprotein, whereas other members of the IP myelin protein family appear closely related. In the CNS myelin of trout the IP components appear to replace PLP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nHeterogeneity of Polyneuropathy Associated with Anti-MAG Antibodies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMagy, Laurent; KaborÃ©, RaphaÃ«l; Mathis, StÃ©phane; Lebeau, Prisca; Ghorab, Karima; Caudie, Christiane; Vallat, Jean-Michel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPolyneuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy and anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies is an immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy. The pathophysiology of this condition is likely to involve anti-MAG antibody deposition on myelin sheaths of the peripheral nerves and it is supposed to be distinct from chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP), another immune-mediated demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. In this series, we have retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory findings from 60 patients with polyneuropathy, IgM gammopathy, and anti-MAG antibodies. We found that the clinical picture in these patients is highly variable suggesting a direct link between the monoclonal gammopathy and the neuropathy. Conversely, one-third of patients had a CIDP-like phenotype on electrodiagnostic testing and this was correlated with a low titer of anti-MAG antibodies and the absence of widening of myelin lamellae. Our data suggest that polyneuropathy associated with anti-MAG antibodies is less homogeneous than previously said and that the pathophysiology of the condition is likely to be heterogeneous as well with the self-antigen being MAG in most of the patients but possibly being another component of myelin in the others.

Using the Dot Immunobinding technique, M2 was found to be a component of CNS myelin different from basic protein (BP) and from cerebroside. The expression of M2 on oligodendrocytes, cells known to produce CNS myelin, also confirmed that M2 was a component of CNS myelin. Furthermore, the autoradiography of immunoprecipitates formed with radiolabelled guinea pig myelin and analysed in sodium dodecyl sulphate gels showed that M2 was specific to CNS myelin and absent in peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin. On electrophoresis M2 appeared as two CNS myelin protein bands at the 27 and 54 KD molecular weight levels, distinct from the major protein bands of proteolipid and BP. M2 bands were of glycoprotein nature, as was demonstrated by affinity chromatography of CNS myelin on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose. A monoclonal antibody induced by BP-free CNS glycoproteins recognized the same bands as anti-M2 serum in guinea pig CNS myelin. This would imply that both M2 bands share common determinants. M2 bands similar to the above in guinea pig were also shown in rat, rabbit and bovine CNS myelin with guinea pig antibodies. The same type of anti-M2 antibodies were induced in rabbit immunized with homologous CNS tissue. Although only a minor component of myelin, M2 is strongly immunogenic compared to BP. M2 antigen could thus be the target of chronic demyelinating processes such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.

Myelin serves essential roles in the functioning of the nervous system. Axonal degeneration is the major cause of permanent neurological disability in primary myelin diseases. Many glycoproteins have been identified in myelin, and a lack of one myelin glycoprotein results in abnormal myelin structures in many cases. However, the roles of glycans on myelin glycoproteins remain poorly understood. Here, we report that sulfated N-glycans are involved in peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelination. PNS myelin glycoproteins contain highly abundant sulfated N-glycans. Major sulfated N-glycans were identified in both porcine and mouse PNS myelin, demonstrating that the 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc-6-O-sulfation) is highly conserved in PNS myelin between these species. P0 protein, the most abundant glycoprotein in PNS myelin and mutations in which at the glycosylation site cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, has abundant GlcNAc-6-O-sulfated N-glycans. Mice deficient in N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (GlcNAc6ST-1) failed to synthesize sulfated N-glycans and exhibited abnormal myelination and axonal degeneration in the PNS. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GlcNAc6ST-1 modulates PNS myelination and myelinated axonal survival through the GlcNAc-6-O-sulfation of N-glycans on glycoproteins.

In this UK-based, multicentre study, 31 children with MOG antibody-associated relapsing disease were studied retrospectively. Of the 31 children studied, 14 presented with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM); they were younger (mean 4.1y) than the remainder (mean 8.5y) who presented with optic neuritis and/or transverse myelitis (p<0.001). Similarly, children who had an abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at onset (n=20) were younger than patients with normal MRI at onset (p=0.001) or at follow-up (p<0.001). 'Leukodystrophy-like' MRI patterns of confluent largely symmetrical lesions was seen during the course of the disease in 7 out of 14 children with a diagnosis of ADEM, and was only seen in children younger than 7 years of age. Their disability after a 3-year follow-up was mild to moderate, and most patients continued to relapse, despite disease-modifying treatments. MOG antibody should be tested in children presenting with relapsing neurological disorders associated with confluent, bilateral white matter changes, and distinct enhancement pattern. Children with MOG antibody-associated disease present with age-related differences in phenotypes, with a severe leukoencephalopathy phenotype in the very young and normal intracranial MRI in the older children. This finding suggests a susceptibility of the very young and myelinating brain to MOG antibody-mediated mechanisms of damage. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated demyelination manifest with an age-related phenotype. Children with MOG antibody and 'leukodystrophy-like' imaging patterns tend to have poor response to second-line immunotherapy.

Mutations in the corresponding gene cause hereditary demyelinating neuropathies. In mice heterozygously deficient in P(0) (P(0)(+/-) mice), an established animal model for a subtype of hereditary neuropathies, T-lymphocytes are present in the demyelinating nerves. To monitor the possible involvement of the immune system in myelin pathology, we cross-bred P(0)(+/-) mice with null mutants for the recombination activating gene 1 (RAG-1) or with mice deficient in the T-cell receptor alpha-subunit. We found that in P(0)(+/-) mice myelin degeneration and impairment of nerve conduction properties is less severe when the immune system is deficient. Moreover, isolated T-lymphocytes from P(0)(+/-) mice show enhanced reactivity to myelin components of the peripheral nerve, such as P(0), P(2), and myelin basic protein. We hypothesize that autoreactive immune cells can significantly foster the demyelinating phenotype of mice with a primarily genetically based peripheral neuropathy.\n\nLipid rafts mediate the interaction between myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) on myelin and MAG-receptors on neurons.\n\nPubMed\n\nVinson, Mary; Rausch, Oliver; Maycox, Peter R; Prinjha, Rab K; Chapman, Debra; Morrow, Rachel; Harper, Alex J; Dingwall, Colin; Walsh, Frank S; Burbidge, Stephen A; Riddell, David R\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThe interaction between myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), expressed at the periaxonal membrane of myelin, and receptors on neurons initiates a bidirectional signalling system that results in inhibition of neurite outgrowth and maintenance of myelin integrity. We show that this involves a lipid-raft to lipid-raft interaction on opposing cell membranes. MAG is exclusively located in low buoyancy Lubrol WX-insoluble membrane fractions isolated from whole brain, primary oligodendrocytes, or MAG-expressing CHO cells. Localisation within these domains is dependent on cellular cholesterol and occurs following terminal glycosylation in the trans-Golgi network, characteristics of association with lipid rafts. Furthermore, a recombinant form of MAG interacts specifically with lipid-raft fractions from whole brain and cultured cerebellar granule cells, containing functional MAG receptors GT1b and Nogo-66 receptor and molecules required for transduction of signal from MAG into neurons. The localisation of both MAG and MAG receptors within lipid rafts on the surface of opposing cells may create discrete areas of high avidity multivalent interaction, known to be critical for signalling into both cell types. Localisation within lipid rafts may provide a molecular environment that facilitates the interaction between MAG and multiple receptors and also between MAG ligands and molecules involved in signal transduction.\n\nAnti-myelin antibodies predict the clinical outcome after a first episode suggestive of MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nTomassini, V; De Giglio, L; Reindl, M; Russo, P; Pestalozza, I; Pantano, P; Berger, T; Pozzilli, C\n\n2007-11-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to test the contribution of anti-myelin antibodies in predicting conversion from clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to multiple sclerosis (MS) when considering either Poser's or McDonald's diagnostic criteria. Fifty-one patients with CIS and abnormal brain MRI were imaged monthly for six months and then at 12, 18, 24, 36 months. At baseline serum samples testing antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (anti-MOG) and myelin basic protein (anti-MBP) were collected. During the 36-month follow-up, 26 (51%) patients developed a relapse thus becoming clinically definite MS (CDMS) according to Poser's criteria; 46 (90.2%) patients converted to MS according to McDonald's criteria. Out of 51 patients, 28 (54.9%) had either double or single positivity for anti-myelin antibodies. Antibody status significantly predicted MS according to Poser's criteria (P=0.004), but did not according to the McDonald's criteria. When compared to antibody negative patients, the risk of developing a relapse was 8.9 (95% CI: 2.7-29.8; P<0.001) for anti-MBP positive (anti-MBP+) patients and 1.5 (95% CI: 0.4-5.4; P=0.564) for those anti-MOG positive (anti-MOG+); double positive patients (ie, anti-MBP+/anti-MOG+) had a risk of relapse's occurrence equal to 3.4 (95% CI: 1.1-10.2; P=0.031). Also, the antibody status predicted the median time span from CIS to CDMS, that was of 36 months in the anti-MOG-/anti-MBP- group, 33 months in the anti-MOG+/anti-MBP- group, 24 months in the anti-MOG+/anti-MBP+ group and 12 months in the anti-MOG-/anti-MBP+ patients (P=0.003 by ANOVA). Our data support the prognostic value of anti-myelin antibodies in CIS patients at risk of CDMS, with positive patients showing shorter time interval to relapse occurrence than negative patients.\n\nThe role of sulfoglucuronosyl glycosphingolipids in the pathogenesis of monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia and peripheral neuropathy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nARIGA, Toshio\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn IgM paraproteinemia and peripheral neuropathy, IgM M-protein secretion by B cells leads to a T helper cell response, suggesting that it is antibody-mediated autoimmune disease involving carbohydrate epitopes in myelin sheaths. An immune response against sulfoglucuronosyl glycosphingolipids (SGGLs) is presumed to participate in demyelination or axonal degeneration in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). SGGLs contain a 3-sulfoglucuronic acid residue that interacts with anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and the monoclonal antibody anti-HNK-1. Immunization of animals with sulfoglucuronosyl paragloboside (SGPG) induced anti-SGPG antibodies and sensory neuropathy, which closely resembles the human disease. These animal models might help to understand the disease mechanism and lead to more specific therapeutic strategies. In an in vitro study, destruction or malfunction of the blood-nerve barrier (BNB) was found, resulting in the leakage of circulating antibodies into the PNS parenchyma, which may be considered as the initial key step for development of disease. PMID:21785257\n\nMicroglial Fc Receptors Mediate Physiological Changes Resulting From Antibody Cross-Linking of Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMarta, Cecilia B.; Bansal, Rashmi; Pfeiffer, Steven E.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAntibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) have been implicated in Multiple Sclerosis demyelination through activation of complement and/or macrophage-effector processes. We presented a novel mechanism, whereby MOG on oligodendrocytes, when cross-linked with anti-MOG and secondary antibody resulted in its repartitioning into lipid rafts, and changes in protein phosphorylation and morphology. Here, we show that similar events occur when anti-MOG is cross-linked with Fc receptors (FcRs) present on microglia but not with complement. These results indicate that FcRs are endogenous antigen/antibody cross-linkers in vitro, suggesting that FcRs could be physiologically relevant in vivo and possible targets for therapy in Multiple Sclerosis. PMID:18406472\n\nTissue resident macrophages are sufficient for demyelination during peripheral nerve myelin induced experimental autoimmune neuritis?\n\nPubMed\n\nTaylor, Jude Matthew\n\n2017-12-15\n\nThe contribution of resident endoneurial tissue macrophages versus recruited monocyte derived macrophages to demyelination and disease during Experimental Autoimmune Neuritis (EAN) was investigated using passive transfer of peripheral nerve myelin (PNM) specific serum antibodies or adoptive co-transfer of PNM specific T and B cells from EAN donors to leukopenic and normal hosts. Passive transfer of PNM specific serum antibodies or adoptive co-transfer of myelin specific T and B cells into leukopenic recipients resulted in a moderate reduction in nerve conduction block or in the disease severity compared to the normal recipients. This was despite at least a 95% decrease in the number of circulating mononuclear cells during the development of nerve conduction block and disease and a 50% reduction in the number of infiltrating endoneurial macrophages in the nerve lesions of the leukopenic recipients. These observations suggest that during EAN in Lewis rats actively induced by immunization with peripheral nerve myelin, phagocytic macrophages originating from the resident endoneurial population may be sufficient to engage in demyelination initiated by anti-myelin antibodies in this model.

In zebrafish and rodent models, we identify GPR56/ADGRG1 as a conserved regulator of PNS development and health. We demonstrate that, during SC development, GPR56-dependent RhoA signaling promotes timely radial sorting of axons. In the mature PNS, GPR56 is localized to distinct SC cytoplasmic domains, is required to establish proper myelin thickness, and facilitates organization of the myelin sheath. Furthermore, we define plectin-a scaffolding protein previously linked to SC domain organization, myelin maintenance, and a series of disorders termed \"plectinopathies\"-as a novel interacting partner of GPR56. Finally, we show that Gpr56 mutants develop progressive neuropathy-like symptoms, suggesting an underlying mechanism for peripheral defects in some human patients with GPR56 mutations. In sum, we define Gpr56 as a new regulator in the development and maintenance of peripheral myelin.

It spans a region of 12.5 kb and consists of eight exons. Its exon-intron structure differs from that of classical MHC-class I genes, with which it is linked in the mouse genome. Nucleotide sequencing of the 5{prime} flanking region revelas that it contains several putative protein-binding sites, some of them in common with other myelin gene promoters. One intragenic polymorphism has been identified: it consists of a GA repeat, defining at least three alleles in mouse inbred strains, and is easily detectable using the polymerasemoreÂ Â» chain reaction method.Â«Â less\n\nA histone deacetylase 3âdependent pathway delimits peripheral myelin growth and functional regeneration\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHe, Xuelian; Zhang, Liguo; Queme, Luis F; Liu, Xuezhao; Lu, Andrew; Waclaw, Ronald R; Dong, Xinran; Zhou, Wenhao; Kidd, Grahame; Yoon, Sung-Ok; Buonanno, Andres; Rubin, Joshua B; Xin, Mei; Nave, Klaus-Armin; Trapp, Bruce D; Jankowski, Michael P; Lu, Q Richard\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDeficits in Schwann cellâmediated remyelination impair functional restoration after nerve damage, contributing to peripheral neuropathies. The mechanisms mediating block of remyelination remain elusive. Here, through small-molecule screening focusing on epigenetic modulators, we identified histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3; a histone-modifying enzyme) as a potent inhibitor of peripheral myelinogenesis. Inhibition of HDAC3 enhanced myelin growth and regeneration and improved functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury in mice. HDAC3 antagonizes the myelinogenic neuregulinâPI3KâAKT signaling axis. Moreover, genome-wide profiling analyses revealed that HDAC3 represses promyelinating programs through epigenetic silencing while coordinating with p300 histone acetyltransferase to activate myelination-inhibitory programs that include the HIPPO signaling effector TEAD4 to inhibit myelin growth. Schwann cellâspecific deletion of either Hdac3 or Tead4 in mice resulted in an elevation of myelin thickness in sciatic nerves. Thus, our findings identify the HDAC3âTEAD4 network as a dual-function switch of cell-intrinsic inhibitory machinery that counters myelinogenic signals and maintains peripheral myelin homeostasis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of transient HDAC3 inhibition for improving peripheral myelin repair.

Here, we hypothesized that immune activation during IM triggers autoreactive immune responses. Antibody responses towards cellular antigens using a HEp-2 based indirect immunofluorescence assay and native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) using a flow cytometry-based assay were determined in 35 patients with IM and in 23 control subjects. We detected frequent immunoglobulin M (IgM) reactivity to vimentin, a major constituent of the intermediate filament family of proteins, in IM patients (27/35; 77%) but rarely in control subjects (2/23; 9%). IgG autoantibodies binding to HEp-2 cells were absent in both groups. In contrast, IgG responses to native MOG, present in up to 40% of children with inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), were detectable in 7/35 (20%) patients with IM but not in control subjects.

Here, we hypothesized that immune activation during IM triggers autoreactive immune responses. Antibody responses towards cellular antigens using a HEp-2 based indirect immunofluorescence assay and native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) using a flow cytometry-based assay were determined in 35 patients with IM and in 23 control subjects. We detected frequent immunoglobulin M (IgM) reactivity to vimentin, a major constituent of the intermediate filament family of proteins, in IM patients (27/35; 77%) but rarely in control subjects (2/23; 9%). IgG autoantibodies binding to HEp-2 cells were absent in both groups. In contrast, IgG responses to native MOG, present in up to 40% of children with inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), were detectable in 7/35 (20%) patients with IM but not in control subjects. Normalization of anti-vimentin IgM levels to increased total IgM concentrations during IM resulted in loss of significant differences for anti-vimentin IgM titers. Anti-MOG specific IgG responses were still detectable in a subset of three out of 35 patients with IM (9%), even after normalization to increased total IgG levels.

Owing to the scarcity of certain antigens and the dense structure of the peripheral nerve, a pre-embedding technique is likely appropriate. After several investigations on procedures for pre-embedding immunolabeling, we propose a method that offers a good compromise between detection of antigenic sites and preservation of morphology at the ultrastructural level, and that is easy to use and suitable for investigations on peripheral nerve biopsies from humans. Pre-fixation by immersion in paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde is necessary to stabilize the ultrastructure. Then, ultrasmall gold particles with silver enhancement are advised. Antibodies against myelin protein zero and myelin basic protein were chosen for demonstration. The same technique was applied to localize a 35 kDa myelin protein.\n\nThe human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) gene: Complete nucleotide sequence and structural characterization\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPaule Roth, M.; Malfroy, L.; Offer, C.\n\n1995-07-20\n\nHuman myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a myelin component of the central nervous system, is a candidate target antigen for autoimmune-mediated demyelination. We have isolated and sequenced part of a cosmid clone that contains the entire human MOG gene. The primary nuclear transcript, extending from the putative start of transcription to the site of poly(A) addition, is 15,561 nucleotides in length. The human MOG gene contains 8 exons, separated by 7 introns; canonical intron/exon boundary sites are observed at each junction. The introns vary in size from 242 to 6484 bp and contain numerous repetitive DNA elements, including 14 Alu sequencesmoreÂ Â» within 3 introns. Another Alu element is located in the 3{prime}-untranslated region of the gene. Alu sequences were classified with respect to subfamily assignment. Seven hundred sixty-three nucleotides 5{prime} of the transcription start and 1214 nucleotides 3{prime} of the poly(A) addition sites were also sequenced. The 5{prime}-flanking region revealed the presence of several consensus sequences that could be relevant in the transcription of the MOG gene, in particular binding sites in common with other myelin gene promoters. Two polymorphic intragenic dinucleotide (CA){sub n} and tetranucleotide (TAAA){sub n} repeats were identified and may provide genetic marker tools for association and linkage studies. 50 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nAutoantibodies against myelin sheath and S100Î² are associated with cognitive dysfunction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaptista, Talita Siara Almeida; Petersen, Laura Esteves; Molina, Julia K; de Nardi, Tatiana; Wieck, AndrÃ©a; do Prado, Aline; Piovesan, Deise Marcela; Keisermann, Mauro; Grassi-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Bauer, MoisÃ©s Evandro\n\n2017-09-01\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been associated with cognitive impairment and peripheral production of autoantibodies. Autoantibodies against central nervous system (CNS) proteins and S100 calcium-binding Î² (S100Î²) were found increased in diseases characterized by cognitive impairment like Alzheimer disease and Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (NPSLE). The aim of this study was to investigate the plasma levels of autoantibodies against myelin basic protein (anti-MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (anti-MOG) and S100Î², and their relationships with cognitive performance in RA patients. Twenty patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and 19 age-, sex-, and schooling-matched healthy controls were recruited. Multiple dimensions of cognitive function were evaluated by structured clinical questionnaires. Autoantibodies and S100Î² levels were assessed by ELISAs. Patients had significantly higher levels of anti-MBP IgG (17.51Â Â±Â 1.36 vs. 5.24Â Â±Â 0.53Â ng/mL), anti-MOG IgG (5.68Â Â±Â 1.34 vs. 0.51Â Â±Â 0.49Â ng/mL), and S100Î² protein (2.24Â Â±Â 0.50 vs. 0.47Â Â±Â 0.06) than controls (all pÂ <Â 0.0001). After adjusting for potential confounders, RA group presented worse cognitive performance involving the working memory and executive functions such as inhibition, flexibility, and mental control in parallel to higher autoantibodies and S100Î² levels than healthy controls (all pÂ <Â 0.001). Levels of anti-MBP were negatively associated with delayed verbal recall (DVR; rÂ =Â -0.42, pÂ =Â 0.005), Stroop Color-Word (rÂ =Â -0.48, pÂ =Â 0.004), and N-Back Total scores (rÂ =Â -0.59, pÂ <Â 0.0001) and positively with Trail Making Test B (TMB, rÂ =Â 0.53, pÂ =Â 0.001).

However, receptors are present on myelinating glia, suggesting that chemical transmission may also occur along axons. Confocal microscopy and Ca(2+) -imaging using an axonally expressed FRET-based reporter was used to measure Ca(2+) changes and morphological alterations in myelin in response to stimulation of glutamate receptors. Activation of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors induced a Ca(2+) increase in axon cylinders. However, only the latter caused structural alterations in axons, despite similar Ca(2+) increases. Myelin morphology was significantly altered by NMDA receptor activation, but not by AMPA receptors. Cu(2+) ions influenced the NMDA receptor-dependent response, suggesting that this metal modulates axonal receptors. Glutamate increased ribosomal signal in Schwann cell cytoplasm. Axon cylinders and myelin of peripheral nervous system axons respond to glutamate, with a consequence being an increase in Schwann cell ribosomes. This may have implications for nerve pathology and regeneration. Muscle Nerve 54: 451-459, 2016.

Several histopathology studies have shown binding of IgM to myelin and a secondary widening of myelin lamellae in cutaneous nerves and in the sural nerve of patients with IgM-MGUS, or WaldenstrÃ¶m's Macroglobulinaemia (WM), and peripheral neuropathy. In this retrospective study we investigated the value of skin biopsy examination in the diagnosis of MGUS- and WM-associated peripheral neuropathy. A total of 117 patients, who were examined for an M-component in serum with associated nerve symptoms, had a skin biopsy taken and examined for immunoglobulin deposition in cutaneous nerves. Thirty-five patients were diagnosed with MGUS or WM and peripheral neuropathy with no other cause of neuropathy. Nineteen patients had MGUS but no peripheral neuropathy. Of the 35 patients with MGUS or WM and peripheral neuropathy, four had immunoglobulin deposition in the skin biopsy, all of whom had an IgM gammopathy. In the control group of 19 without peripheral neuropathy, three had immunoglobulin deposition in the skin biopsy, all of whom had IgM-MGUS. In both groups, there was a trend towards higher IgM blood levels in patients with immunoglobulin deposition. Half of the patients with IgM gammopathy in the neuropathy group had anti-MAG reactivity, whereas only one in the control group had weak anti-MAG reactivity. Our study indicates that examination of skin biopsies for immunoglobulin deposition does not add significant diagnostic value in the evaluation of neuropathies suspected to be caused by MGUS or WM. IgM immunoglobulin deposition in skin biopsy might merely be an epiphenomenon secondary to high IgM blood levels. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We recruited participants in the department of neurology and ophthalmology in our hospital in Japan. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical features and response to steroid therapies of patients with ON. Sera from patients were tested for antibodies to MOG and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) with a cell-based assay. Between April 2009 and March 2014, we enrolled serial 57 patients with ON (27 males, 30 females; age range 16-84â years) who ophthalmologists had diagnosed as having or suspected to have ON with acute visual impairment and declined critical flicker frequency, abnormal findings of brain MRI, optical coherence tomography and fluorescein fundus angiography at their onset or recurrence. We excluded those patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of neuromyelitis optica (NMO)/NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD), MS McDonald's criteria, and so on. Finally we defined 29 patients with idiopathic ON (14 males, 15 females, age range 16-84 years). 27.6% (8/29) were positive for MOG antibodies and 3.4% (1/29) were positive for AQP4. Among the eight patients with MOG antibodies, five had optic pain (p=0.001) and three had prodromal infection (p=0.179). Three of the eight MOG-positive patients showed significantly high CSF levels of myelin basic protein (p=0.021) and none were positive for oligoclonal band in CSF. On MRIs, seven MOG-positive patients showed high signal intensity on optic nerve, three had a cerebral lesion and one had a spinal cord lesion. Seven of the eight MOG-positive patients had a good response to steroid therapy. Although not proving primary pathogenicity of anti-MOG antibodies, the present results indicate that the measurement of MOG antibodies is useful in diagnosing and treating ON\n\nDesign, synthesis, biological evaluation, and modeling of a non-carbohydrate antagonist of the myelin-associated glycoprotein.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwardt, Oliver; Koliwer-Brandl, Hendrik; Zimmerli, Raphael; Mesch, Stefanie; Rossato, Gianluca; Spreafico, Morena; Vedani, Angelo; Kelm, SÃ¸rge; Ernst, Beat\n\n2010-10-15\n\nBroad modifications of various positions of the minimal natural epitope recognized by the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a blocker of regeneration of neurite injuries, produced sialosides with nanomolar affinities. However, important pharmacokinetic issues, for example, the metabolic stability of these sialosides, remain to be addressed. For this reason, the novel non-carbohydrate mimic 3 was designed and synthesized from (-)-quinic acid. For the design of 3, previously identified beneficial modifications of side chains of Neu5Ac were combined with the replacement of the ring oxygen by a methylene group and the substitution of the C(4)-OH by an acetamide. Although docking experiments to a homology model of MAG revealed that mimic 3 forms all but one of the essential hydrogen bonds identified for the earlier reported lead 2, its affinity was substantially reduced. Extensive molecular-dynamics simulation disclosed that the missing hydrogen bond of the former C(8)-OH leads to a change of the orientation of the side chain. As a consequence, an important hydrophobic contact is compromised leading to a loss of affinity. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, the authors have developed a highly stable platform for performing imaging of the tibial nerve in live rodents, thus allowing the capture of high-resolution, high-magnification spectral images requiring long acquisition times. By further exploiting the qualities of the topically applied myelin dye Nile red, this technique is capable of visualizing the detailed microenvironment of peripheral nerve demyelination injury and recovery, while allowing us to obtain images of exogenous Schwann cell myelination in a living animal. METHODS The authors caused doxorubicin-induced focal demyelination in the tibial nerves of 25 Thy-1 GFP rats, of which 2 subsets (n = 10 each) received either BFP-labeled SKP-SCs or SCs to the zone of injury. Prior to acquiring images of myelin recovery in these nerves, a tibial nerve window was constructed using a silicone hemitube, a fast drying silicone polymer, and a small coverslip. This construct was then affixed to a 3D-printed nerve stage, which in turn was affixed to an external fixation/microscope stage device. Myelin visualization was facilitated by the topical application of Nile red. RESULTS The authors reliably demonstrated intravital peripheral nerve myelin imaging with micron-level resolution and magnification, and minimal movement artifact. The detailed microenvironment of nerve remyelination can be vividly observed, while exogenously applied Schwann cells and skin-derived precursor Schwann cells can be seen myelinating axons. CONCLUSIONS Topically applied Nile red enables intravital study of myelin in the living rat PNS. Furthermore, the use of a tibial nerve window facilitates stable intravital peripheral nerve imaging, making possible high-definition spectral imaging with long acquisition times.\n\nA role for myelin-associated peroxisomes in maintaining paranodal loops and axonal integrity.\n\nPubMed\n\nKassmann, Celia M; Quintes, Susanne; Rietdorf, Jens; MÃ¶bius, Wiebke; Sereda, Michael Werner; Nientiedt, Tobias; Saher, Gesine; Baes, Myriam; Nave, Klaus-Armin\n\n2011-07-21\n\nDemyelinating diseases of the nervous system cause axon loss but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show by confocal and electron microscopy that in myelin-forming glia peroxisomes are associated with myelin membranes. When peroxisome biogenesis is experimentally perturbed in Pex5 conditional mouse mutants, myelination by Schwann cells appears initially normal. However, in nerves of older mice paranodal loops become physically unstable and develop swellings filled with vesicles and electron-dense material. This novel model of a demyelinating neuropathy demonstrates that peroxisomes serve an important function in the peripheral myelin compartment, required for long-term axonal integrity.

However, no serious neuropathological investigation of this protein in the schizophrenic brain has yet been performed. In this study, to confirm the change in neuropathological findings due to the pathogenesis of this disease, we observed the expression of myelin-oligodendrocyte directly in the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) was evaluated in the cortex of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the hippocampus in 10 schizophrenic and nine age- and sex-matched normal control postmortem brains. The expression of MOG was significantly lower in the middle layer of the neocortex of the STG and stratum lucidum of CA3 in the hippocampus in the long-term schizophrenic brains (patients with â¥30 years of illness duration) than in the age-matched controls. Furthermore, the thickness of MOG-positive fibre-like structures was significantly lower in both regions of the long-term schizophrenic brains than in the age-matched controls. These findings suggest that a long duration of illness has a marked effect on the expression of MOG in these regions, and that myelin-oligodendrocyte abnormalities in these regions may be related to the progressive pathophysiology of schizophrenia.\n\nStructure of the human myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein gene and multiple alternative spliced isoforms\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPham-Dinh, D.; Gaspera, D.B.; Dautigny, A.\n\n1995-09-20\n\nMyelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a special component of the central nervous system localization on the outermost lamellae of mature myelin, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. We report here the organization of the human MOG gene, which spans approximately 17 kb, and the characterization of six MOG mRNA splicing variants. The intron/exon structure of the human MOG gene confirmed the splicing pattern, supporting the hypothesis that mRNA isoforms could arise by alternative splicing of a single gene. In addition to the eight exons coding for the major MOG isoform, the human MOG gene also contains 3` region, a previously unknownmoreÂ Â» alternatively spliced coding exon, VIA. Alternative utilization of two acceptor splicing sites for exon VIII could produce two different C-termini. The nucleotide sequences presented here may be a useful tool to study further possible involvement if the MOG gene in hereditary neurological disorders. 23 refs., 5 figs.Â«Â less\n\nSir-two-homolog 2 (Sirt2) modulates peripheral myelination through polarity protein Par-3/atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) signaling.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeirowski, Bogdan; Gustin, Jason; Armour, Sean M; Yamamoto, Hiroyasu; Viader, Andreu; North, Brian J; MichÃ¡n, Shaday; Baloh, Robert H; Golden, Judy P; Schmidt, Robert E; Sinclair, David A; Auwerx, Johan; Milbrandt, Jeffrey\n\n2011-10-25\n\nThe formation of myelin by Schwann cells (SCs) occurs via a series of orchestrated molecular events. We previously used global expression profiling to examine peripheral nerve myelination and identified the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase Sir-two-homolog 2 (Sirt2) as a protein likely to be involved in myelination. Here, we show that Sirt2 expression in SCs is correlated with that of structural myelin components during both developmental myelination and remyelination after nerve injury. Transgenic mice lacking or overexpressing Sirt2 specifically in SCs show delays in myelin formation. In SCs, we found that Sirt2 deacetylates Par-3, a master regulator of cell polarity. The deacetylation of Par-3 by Sirt2 decreases the activity of the polarity complex signaling component aPKC, thereby regulating myelin formation. These results demonstrate that Sirt2 controls an essential polarity pathway in SCs during myelin assembly and provide insights into the association between intracellular metabolism and SC plasticity.\n\nJapanese neuropathy patients with peripheral myelin protein-22 gene aneuploidy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLebo, R.V.; Li, L.Y.; Flandermeyer, R.R.\n\n1994-09-01\n\nPeripheral myelin protein (PMP-22) gene aneuploidy results in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 1A (CMT1A) and the Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsy (HNPP) in Japanese patients as well as Caucasian Americans. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), the most common genetic neuropathy, results when expression of one of at least seven genes is defective. CMT1A, about half of all CMT mutations, is usually associated with a duplication spanning the peripheral myelin protein-22 gene on distal chromosome band 17p11.2. Autosomal dominant HNPP (hereditary pressure and sensory neuropathy, HPSN) results from a deletion of the CMT1A gene region. Multicolor in situ hybridization with PMP-22 genemoreÂ Â» region probe characterized HNPP deletion reliably and detected all different size duplications reported previously. In summary, 72% of 28 Japanese CMT1 (HMSNI) patients tested had the CMT1A duplication, while none of the CMT2 (HMSNII) or CMT3 (HMSNIII) patients had a duplication. Three cases of HNPP were identified by deletion of the CMT1A gene region on chromosome 17p. HNPP and CMT1A have been reported to result simultaneously from the same unequal recombination event. The lower frequency of HNPP compared to CMT1A suggests that HNPP patients have a lower reproductive fitness than CMT1A patients. This result, along with a CMT1A duplication found in an Asian Indian family, demonstrates the broad geographic distribution and high frequency of PMP-22 gene aneuploidy.Â«Â less\n\nMyelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein-IgG-positive Recurrent Bilateral Optic Papillitis with Serous Retinal Detachment: A Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nKon, Tomoya; Hikichi, Hiroki; Ueno, Tatsuya; Suzuki, Chieko; Nunomura, Jinichi; Kaneko, Kimihiko; Takahashi, Toshiyuki; Nakashima, Ichiro; Tomiyama, Masahiko\n\n2018-05-18\n\nAutoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) have been detected in inflammatory demyelinating central nervous system diseases.

The patient was thought to have optic papillitis associated with MOG-IgG. Her symptoms rapidly improved after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy.

Here we present a biomaterials-approach, specifically, a highly tunable conductive biodegradable flexible polyurethane by polycondensation of poly(glycerol sebacate) and aniline pentamer, to significantly enhance SCs' myelin gene expression and neurotrophin secretion for peripheral nerve tissue engineering. SCs are cultured on these conductive polymer films, and the biocompatibility of these films and their ability to enhance myelin gene expressions and sustained neurotrophin secretion are successfully demonstrated. The mechanism of SCs' neurotrophin secretion on conductive films is demonstrated by investigating the relationship between intracellular Ca(2+) level and SCs' myelination. Furthermore, the neurite growth and elongation of PC12Â cells are induced by adding the neurotrophin medium suspension produced from SCs-laden conductive films. These data suggest that these conductive degradable polyurethanes that enhance SCs' myelin gene expressions and sustained neurotrophin secretion perform great potential for nerve regeneration applications.

However, it is unknown how oligodendrocytes concentrate cholesterol above the level found in nonmyelin membranes. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for proteolipids in cholesterol accumulation. Mice lacking the most abundant myelin protein, proteolipid protein (PLP), are fully myelinated, but PLP-deficient myelin exhibits a reduced cholesterol content. We therefore hypothesized that \"high cholesterol\" is not essential in the myelin sheath itself but is required for an earlier step of myelin biogenesis that is fully compensated for in the absence of PLP. We also found that a PLP-homolog, glycoprotein M6B, is a myelin component of low abundance. By targeting the Gpm6b-gene and crossbreeding, we found that single-mutant mice lacking either PLP or M6B are fully myelinated, while double mutants remain severely hypomyelinated, with enhanced neurodegeneration and premature death. As both PLP and M6B bind membrane cholesterol and associate with the same cholesterol-rich oligodendroglial membrane microdomains, we suggest a model in which proteolipids facilitate myelination by sequestering cholesterol. While either proteolipid can maintain a threshold level of cholesterol in the secretory pathway that allows myelin biogenesis, lack of both proteolipids results in a severe molecular imbalance of prospective myelin membrane. However, M6B is not efficiently sorted into mature myelin, in which it is 200-fold less abundant than PLP. Thus, only PLP contributes to the high cholesterol content of myelin by association and co-transport.

In spite of the apparent pathogenicity of the IgM antibodies and the specific immunoreactivity to myelin antigens, the disease has been difficult to treat. This review describes the clinical phenotype, addresses recent data on immunoreactivity of IgM to various nerve antigens, and discusses the latest progress on treatment.Most of these patients present with paresthesias and sensory ataxia followed by a varying degree of sensorimotor deficits. In more than 75% of the patients, the monoclonal IgM recognizes myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and sulfoglucuronyl glycosphingolipid (SGPG), best detected by ELISA, or other peripheral nerve glycolipids. Recent experiments have demonstrated that animals immunized with SGPG develop sensory ataxia, suggesting a pathogenic role for this antigen. Although cladribine, cyclophosphamide with prednisone, and intravenous immunoglobulin have offered transient benefits to some patients, most have remained treatment-resistant. Open label studies and a recent randomized controlled trial indicate that rituximab is emerging as the best agent available, providing long-term benefits to almost half of these patients. Rituximab appears to work by suppressing the IgM as well as the anti-MAG antibodies and by inducing immunoregulatory T cells. Patients with more sensory deficits and higher anti-MAG antibodies are more likely to respond but may require re-treatment after several months.These encouraging results need confirmation with a larger trial. Data on long-term efficacy and immune markers associated with response to therapy or need for re-treatment are still needed.\n\nStructure and stability of internodal myelin in mouse models of hereditary neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAvila, Robin L; Inouye, Hideyo; Baek, Rena C; Yin, Xinghua; Trapp, Bruce D; Feltri, M Laura; Wrabetz, Lawrence; Kirschner, Daniel A\n\n2005-11-01\n\nPeripheral neuropathies often result in abnormalities in the structure of internodal myelin, including changes in period and membrane packing, as observed by electron microscopy (EM). Mutations in the gene that encodes the major adhesive structural protein of internodal myelin in the peripheral nervous system of humans and mice--P0 glycoprotein--correlate with these defects. The mechanisms by which P0 mutations interfere with myelin packing and stability are not well understood and cannot be provided by EM studies that give static and qualitative information on fixed material. To gain insights into the pathogenesis of mutant P0, we used x-ray diffraction, which can detect more subtle and dynamic changes in native myelin, to investigate myelin structure in sciatic nerves from murine models of hereditary neuropathies. We used mice with disruption of one or both copies of the P0 gene (models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like neuropathy [CMT1B] or Dejerine-Sottas-like neuropathy) and mice with a CMT1B resulting from a transgene encoding P0 with an amino terminal myc-tag. To directly test the structural role of P0, we also examined a mouse that expresses P0 instead of proteolipid protein in central nervous system myelin. To link our findings on unfixed nerves with EM results, we analyzed x-ray patterns from unembedded, aldehyde-fixed nerves and from plastic-embedded nerves. From the x-ray patterns recorded from whole nerves, we assessed the amount of myelin and its quality (i.e. relative thickness and regularity). Among sciatic nerves having different levels of P0, we found that unfixed nerves and, to a lesser extent, fixed but unembedded nerves gave diffraction patterns of sufficient quality to distinguish periods, sometimes differing by a few Angstroms. Certain packing abnormalities were preserved qualitatively by aldehyde fixation, and the relative amount and structural integrity of myelin among nerves could be distinguished.

Deficits in myelin formation and maintenance may lead to chronic neurological disease. P2 is an abundant myelin protein from peripheral nerves, binding between two apposing lipid bilayers. We studied the dynamics of the human myelin protein P2 and its mutated P38G variant in hydrated powders using elastic incoherent neutron scattering. The local harmonic vibrations at low temperatures were very similar for both samples, but the mutant protein had increased flexibility and softness close to physiological temperatures. The results indicate that a drastic mutation of proline to glycine at a functional site can affect protein dynamics, and in the case of P2, they may explain functional differences between the two proteins.\n\nCholesterol regulates the endoplasmic reticulum exit of the major membrane protein P0 required for peripheral myelin compaction.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaher, Gesine; Quintes, Susanne; MÃ¶bius, Wiebke; Wehr, Michael C; KrÃ¤mer-Albers, Eva-Maria; BrÃ¼gger, Britta; Nave, Klaus-Armin\n\n2009-05-13\n\nRapid impulse conduction requires electrical insulation of axons by myelin, a cholesterol-rich extension of the glial cell membrane with a characteristic composition of proteins and lipids. Mutations in several myelin protein genes cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and disease, presumably attributable to failure of misfolded proteins to pass the ER quality control. Because many myelin proteins partition into cholesterol-rich membrane rafts, their interaction with cholesterol could potentially be part of the ER quality control system. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that the major peripheral myelin protein P0 requires cholesterol for exiting the ER and reaching the myelin compartment. Cholesterol dependency of P0 trafficking in heterologous cells is mediated by a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif. Mutant mice lacking cholesterol biosynthesis in Schwann cells suffer from severe hypomyelination with numerous uncompacted myelin stretches. This demonstrates that high-level cholesterol coordinates P0 export with myelin membrane synthesis, which is required for the correct stoichiometry of myelin components and for myelin compaction.\n\nHigh frequency of mutations in codon 98 of the peripheral myelin protein Po gene in 20 French CMT1 patients\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRougher, H.; LeGuern, E. Gouider, R.\n\n1996-03-01\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease, characterized by distal muscle weakness and amyotrophy, decreased or absent tendon reflexes, and high arched feet, is the most common inherited peripheral neuropathy, with a prevalence of 1 in 2,500. Two types of CMT have been distinguished on the basis of nerve conduction velocities. CMT type 1 is the most frequent, with markedly slowed velocities ({<=}40 m/s) associated with hypertrophic onion bulb changes on nerve biopsy. Autosomal dominant CMT1 is genetically heterogeneous: CMT1A is caused by a 1.5-Mb duplication in 17p11.2 and, more rarely, by a point mutation in tha PMP22 (peripheral myelin protein, 22 kD) gene locatedmoreÂ Â» in the duplicated region; CMT1B results from mutations in the Po (peripheral myelin protein zero) gene in 1q22-23. Forty-five percent (7/16) of the published mutations associated with CMT1 occur in exon 3 of Po. In order to determine the cause of CMT1 in 20 unrelated patients without 17p11.2 duplications, mutations were sought in exon 3 of Po with three techniques: nonradioactive SSCP, automated sequencing, and PCR enzymatic restriction. 18 refs., 2 figs.Â«Â less\n\nStudy of the Peripheral Nerve Fibers Myelin Structure Changes during Activation of Schwann Cell Acetylcholine Receptors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVerdiyan, Ekaterina E.; Allakhverdiev, Elvin S.; Maksimov, Georgy V.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn the present paper we consider a new type of mechanism by which neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) regulates the properties of peripheral nerve fibers myelin. Our data show the importance of the relationship between the changes in the number of Schwann cell (SC) acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and the axon excitation (different intervals between action potentials (APs)). Using Raman spectroscopy, an effect of activation of SC AChRs on the myelin membrane fluidity was investigated. It was found, that ACh stimulates an increase in lipid ordering degree of the myelin lipids, thus providing evidence for specific role of the âaxon-SCâ interactions at the axon excitation. It was proposed, that during the axon excitation, the SC membrane K+- depolarization and the Ca2+âinflux led to phospholipase activation or exocytosis of intracellular membrane vesicles and myelin structure reorganization.

The authors have isolated bovine, mouse, and rat MOG cDNA clones and shown that the developmental pattern of MOG expression in the rat central nervous system coincides with the late stages of myelination. The amino-terminal, extracellular domain of MOG has characteristics of an immunoglobulin variable domain and is 46% and 41% identical with the amino terminus of bovine butyrophilin (expressed in the lactating mammary gland) andmoreÂ Â» B-G antigens of the chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC), respectively; these proteins thus form a subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The homology between MOG and B-G extends beyond their structure and genetic mapping to their ability to induce strong antibody responses and has implications for the role of MOG in pathological, autoimmune conditions. The authors colocalized the MOG and BT genes to the human MHC on chromosome 6p21.3-p22. The mouse MOG gene was mapped to the homologous band C of chromosome 17, within the M region of the mouse MHC. 38 refs., 6 figs.Â«Â less\n\nCholesterol and myelin biogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaher, Gesine; Simons, Mikael\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMyelin consists of several layers of tightly compacted membranes wrapped around axons in the nervous system. The main function of myelin is to provide electrical insulation around the axon to ensure the rapid propagation of nerve conduction. As the myelinating glia terminally differentiates, they begin to produce myelin membranes on a remarkable scale. This membrane is unique in its composition being highly enriched in lipids, in particular galactosylceramide and cholesterol. In this review we will summarize the role of cholesterol in myelin biogenesis in the central and peripheral nervous system.\n\nGemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, increases myelin genes in human oligodendrocytes via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î².\n\nPubMed\n\nJana, Malabendu; Mondal, Susanta; Gonzalez, Frank J; Pahan, Kalipada\n\n2012-10-05\n\nAn increase in CNS remyelination and a decrease in CNS inflammation are important steps to halt the progression of multiple sclerosis. Earlier studies have shown that gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, has anti-inflammatory properties. The current study identified another novel property of gemfibrozil in stimulating the expression of myelin-specific genes (myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, and proteolipid protein (PLP)) in primary human oligodendrocytes, mixed glial cells, and spinal cord organotypic cultures. Although gemfibrozil is a known activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î± (PPAR-Î±), we were unable to detect PPAR-Î± in either gemfibrozil-treated or untreated human oligodendrocytes, and gemfibrozil increased the expression of myelin genes in oligodendrocytes isolated from both wild type and PPAR-Î±(-/-) mice. On the other hand, gemfibrozil markedly increased the expression of PPAR-Î² but not PPAR-Î³. Consistently, antisense knockdown of PPAR-Î², but not PPAR-Î³, abrogated the stimulatory effect of gemfibrozil on myelin genes in human oligodendrocytes. Gemfibrozil also did not up-regulate myelin genes in oligodendroglia isolated from PPAR-Î²(-/-) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that gemfibrozil induced the recruitment of PPAR-Î² to the promoter of PLP and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein genes in human oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, gemfibrozil treatment also led to the recruitment of PPAR-Î² to the PLP promoter in vivo in the spinal cord of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice and suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis symptoms in PLP-T cell receptor transgenic mice. These results suggest that gemfibrozil stimulates the expression of myelin genes via PPAR-Î² and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may find further therapeutic use in demyelinating diseases.\n\nSchwann cell glycogen selectively supports myelinated axon function.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrown, Angus M; Evans, Richard D; Black, Joel; Ransom, Bruce R\n\n2012-09-01\n\nInterruption of energy supply to peripheral axons is a cause of axon loss. We determined whether glycogen was present in mammalian peripheral nerve, and whether it supported axon conduction during aglycemia. We used biochemical assay and electron microscopy to determine the presence of glycogen, and electrophysiology to monitor axon function. Glycogen was present in sciatic nerve, its concentration varying directly with ambient glucose. Electron microscopy detected glycogen granules primarily in myelinating Schwann cell cytoplasm, and these diminished after exposure to aglycemia. During aglycemia, conduction failure in large myelinated axons (A fibers) mirrored the time course of glycogen loss. Latency to compound action potential (CAP) failure was directly related to nerve glycogen content at aglycemia onset. Glycogen did not benefit the function of slow-conducting, small-diameter unmyelinated axons (C fibers) during aglycemia. Blocking glycogen breakdown pharmacologically accelerated CAP failure during aglycemia in A fibers, but not in C fibers. Lactate was as effective as glucose in supporting sciatic nerve function, and was continuously released into the extracellular space in the presence of glucose and fell rapidly during aglycemia. Our findings indicated that glycogen is present in peripheral nerve, primarily in myelinating Schwann cells, and exclusively supports large-diameter, myelinated axon conduction during aglycemia. Available evidence suggests that peripheral nerve glycogen breaks down during aglycemia and is passed, probably as lactate, to myelinated axons to support function. Unmyelinated axons are not protected by glycogen and are more vulnerable to dysfunction during periods of hypoglycemia. .

Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes) form a large group of vertebrates, and they are among oldest extant jawed vertebrate lineage. It has been known from studies 150 years ago, that they are positioned at the root of the successful appearance of compact myelin and main adhesive proteins in vertebrates. More importantly, the ultrastructure of their compact myelin is indistinguishable from the one observed in tetrapods and the first true myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin protein zero (MPZ) seem to have originated on cartilaginous fish or their ancestors, the placoderms. Thus, the study of their myelin formation would bring new insights in vertebrateâs myelin evolution. Chondrichthyans central nervous system (CNS) myelin composition is also very similar to peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin composition. And while they lack true proteolipid protein (PLP) like tetrapods, they express a DM-like protein in their myelin.

Here, we demonstrated on two neuronal cell lines (PC12 and N1E-115), that laminin and collagen hampered, in a dose-dependent manner, MAG inhibitory activity on several integrin functions, i.e., neurite growth, cell adhesion and cell spreading. Using a function blocking antibody, in PC12 cells, we showed that alpha1beta1 integrin is required in these phenomena. In parallel, we observed that MAG perturbs actin dynamics and lamellipodia formation during early steps of cell spreading. This seemed to be independent of RhoA activation, but dependent of Rac-1 inhibition by MAG. Laminin overrode MAG activity on actin and prevented MAG inhibition NGF-induced Rac1 activation. In conclusion, we evidenced antagonistic signaling between MAG receptors and beta1 integrins, in which Rac-1 may have a central function.\n\nSox2 expression in Schwann cells inhibits myelination in vivo and induces influx of macrophages to the nerve\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRoberts, Sheridan L.; Onaitis, Mark W.; Florio, Francesca; Quattrini, Angelo; Lloyd, Alison C.; D'Antonio, Maurizio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCorrect myelination is crucial for the function of the peripheral nervous system. Both positive and negative regulators within the axon and Schwann cell function to ensure the correct onset and progression of myelination during both development and following peripheral nerve injury and repair. The Sox2 transcription factor is well known for its roles in the development and maintenance of progenitor and stem cell populations, but has also been proposed in vitro as a negative regulator of myelination in Schwann cells. We wished to test fully whether Sox2 regulates myelination in vivo and show here that, in mice, sustained Sox2 expression in vivo blocks myelination in the peripheral nerves and maintains Schwann cells in a proliferative non-differentiated state, which is also associated with increased inflammation within the nerve. The plasticity of Schwann cells allows them to re-myelinate regenerated axons following injury and we show that re-myelination is also blocked by Sox2 expression in Schwann cells. These findings identify Sox2 as a physiological regulator of Schwann cell myelination in vivo and its potential to play a role in disorders of myelination in the peripheral nervous system.

Here, we provide the first evidence that CNS-reactive antibodies (Ab) are similarly capable of initiating an encephalitogenic immune response by targeting endogenous CNS antigen to otherwise inert myeloid APC. In a transgenic mouse model, constitutive production of Ab against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) was sufficient to promote spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the absence of B cells, when mice endogenously contained MOG-recognizing T cells. Adoptive transfer studies corroborated that anti-MOG Ab triggered activation and expansion of peripheral MOG-specific T cells in an Fc-dependent manner, subsequently causing EAE. To evaluate the underlying mechanism, anti-MOG Ab were added to a co-culture of myeloid APC and MOG-specific T cells. At otherwise undetected concentrations, anti-MOG Ab enabled Fc-mediated APC recognition of intact MOG; internalized, processed and presented MOG activated naÃ¯ve T cells to differentiate in an encephalitogenic manner. In a series of translational experiments, anti-MOG Ab from two patients with an acute flare of CNS inflammation likewise facilitated detection of human MOG. Jointly, these observations highlight Ab-mediated opsonization of endogenous CNS auto-antigen as a novel disease- and/or relapse-triggering mechanism in CNS demyelinating disorders.\n\nMolecular characterization of myelin protein zero in Xenopus laevis peripheral nerve\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXie, Bo; Luo, Xiaoyang; Zhao, Cheng; Priest, Christina Marie; Chan, Shiu-Yung; O'Connor, Peter B.; Kirschner, Daniel A.; Costello, Catherine E.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nMyelin protein zero (P0), a glycosylated single-pass transmembrane protein, is essential in the formation and maintenance of peripheral nervous system (PNS) compact myelin. P0 in Xenopus (xP0) exists primarily as a dimeric form that remains stable after various physical and chemical treatments. In exploring the nature of the interactions underlying the dimer stability, we found that xP0 dimer dissociated into monomer during continuous elution gel electrophoresis and conventional SDS-PAGE, indicating that the dimer is stabilized by non-covalent interactions. Furthermore, as some of the gel-purified monomer re-associated into dimer on SDS-PAGE gels, there is likely a dynamic equilibrium between xP0 dimer and monomer in vivo. Because the carbohydrate and fatty acyl moieties may be crucial for the adhesion role of P0, we used sensitive mass spectrometry approaches to elucidate the detailed N-glycosylation and S-acylation profiles of xP0. Asn92 was determined to be the single, fully-occupied glycosylation site of xP0, and a total of 12 glycans was detected that exhibited new structural features compared with those observed from P0 in other species: (1) the neutral glycans were composed mainly of high mannose and hybrid types; (2) 5 of 12 were acidic glycans, among which three were sialylated and the other two were sulfated; (3) none of the glycans had core fucosylation; and (4) no glucuronic acid, hence no HNK-1 epitope, was detected. The drastically different carbohydrate structures observed here support the concept of the species-specific variation in N-glycosylation of P0. Cys152 was found to be acylated with stearoyl (C18:0), whereas palmitoyl (C16:0) is the corresponding predominant fatty acyl group on P0 from higher vertebrates. We propose that the unique glycosylation and acylation patterns of Xenopus P0 may underlie its unusual dimerization behavior. Our results should shed light on the understanding of the phylogenetic development of P0's adhesion role in PNS\n\nMyelination and mTOR\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFiglia, Gianluca; Gerber, Daniel\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Myelinating cells surround axons to accelerate the propagation of action potentials, to support axonal health, and to refine neural circuits. Myelination is metabolically demanding and, consistent with this notion, mTORC1âa signaling hub coordinating cell metabolismâhas been implicated as a key signal for myelination. Here, we will discuss metabolic aspects of myelination, illustrate the main metabolic processes regulated by mTORC1, and review advances on the role of mTORC1 in myelination of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. Recent progress has revealed a complex role of mTORC1 in myelinating cells that includes, besides positive regulation of myelin growth, additional critical functions in the stages preceding active myelination. Based on the available evidence, we will also highlight potential nonoverlapping roles between mTORC1 and its known main upstream pathways PI3KâAkt, MekâErk1/2, and AMPK in myelinating cells. Finally, we will discuss signals that are already known or hypothesized to be responsible for the regulation of mTORC1 activity in myelinating cells.

By label-free coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) imaging of myelin lipids, we investigate myelin integrity in the lumbar spinal cord tissue isolated from naÃ¯ve SJL mice, and from mice at the onset, peak acute, and remission stages of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Progressive demyelinating disease is initially characterized by the retraction of paranodal myelin both at the onset of disease and at the borders of acute demyelinating lesions. Myelin retraction is confirmed by elongated distribution of neurofascin proteins visualized by immunofluorescence. The disruption of paranodal myelin subsequently exposes Kv1.2 channels at the juxtaparanodes and lead to the displacement of Kv1.2 channels to the paranodal and nodal domains. Paranodal myelin is partially restored during disease remission, indicating spontaneous myelin regeneration. These findings suggest that paranodal domain injury precedes formation of internodal demyelinating lesions in relapsing EAE. Our results also demonstrate that CARS microscopy is an effective readout of myelin disease burden.\n\nMyelin in cartilaginous fish.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Bellard, Maria Elena\n\n2016-06-15\n\nMyelin is probably one of the most fascinating and innovative biological acquisition: a glia plasma membrane tightly wrapped around an axon and insulating it.

In this study, we evaluated motor activity and myelin ultrastructures in 4.1G-deficient (-/-) mice. When suspended by the tail, aged 4.1G -/- mice displayed spastic leg extension, especially after overwork. Motor-conduction velocity in 4.1G -/- mice was slower than that in wild-type mice. Using electron microscopy, 4.1G -/- mice exhibited myelin abnormalities: myelin was thicker in internodes, and attachment of myelin tips was distorted in some paranodes. In addition, we found a novel function of 4.1G for sorting a scaffold protein, Lin7, due to disappearance of the immunolocalization and reduction of the production of Lin7c and Lin7a in 4.1G -/- sciatic nerves, as well as the interaction of MPP6 and Lin7 with immunoprecipitation. Thus, we herein propose 4.1G functions as a signal for proper formation of myelin in PNS.\n\nBinding specificity of anti-HNK-1 IgM M-protein in anti-MAG neuropathy: possible clinical relevance.\n\nPubMed\n\nHamada, Yukihiro; Hirano, Makito; Kuwahara, Motoi; Samukawa, Makoto; Takada, Kazuo; Morise, Jyoji; Yabuno, Keiko; Oka, Shogo; Kusunoki, Susumu\n\n2015-02-01\n\nAnti-myelin-associated-glycoprotein (MAG) neuropathy is an intractable autoimmune polyneuropathy. The antigenic region of MAG is the human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate. We and others previously suggested that the extension of antibody reactivities to HNK-1-bearing proteins other than MAG was associated with treatment resistance, without statistical analyses. In this study, we established an ELISA method with recombinant proteins to test binding specificities of currently available monoclonal antibodies to MAG and another HNK-1-bearing protein, phosphacan. Using this system, we found the distinct binding specificities of anti-MAG antibody in 19 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Their clinical relevance was then determined retrospectively with the adjusted 10-points INCAT disability score (0 = normal and 10 = highly disable). The results showed that strong reactivities of anti-MAG antibodies to phosphacan were significantly associated with treatment resistance or progressive clinical courses, indicating a possible clinical relevance of the binding specificities.

In combination with functional experiments in vitro, in vivo and in silico, the fine details of the structureâfunction relationships in P2 are emerging. P2 is a fatty acid-binding protein expressed in vertebrate peripheral nerve myelin, where it may function in bilayer stacking and lipid transport. P2 binds to phospholipid membranes through its positively charged surface and a hydrophobic tip, and accommodates fatty acids inside its barrel structure. The structure of human P2 refined at the ultrahigh resolution of 0.93 Ã allows detailed structuralmoreÂ Â» analyses, including the full organization of an internal hydrogen-bonding network. The orientation of the bound fatty-acid carboxyl group is linked to the protonation states of two coordinating arginine residues. An anion-binding site in the portal region is suggested to be relevant for membrane interactions and conformational changes. When bound to membrane multilayers, P2 has a preferred orientation and is stabilized, and the repeat distance indicates a single layer of P2 between membranes. Simulations show the formation of a double bilayer in the presence of P2, and in cultured cells wild-type P2 induces membrane-domain formation. Here, the most accurate structural and functional view to date on P2, a major component of peripheral nerve myelin, is presented, showing how it can interact with two membranes simultaneously while going through conformational changes at its portal region enabling ligand transfer.Â«Â less\n\nDifferential Sox10 Genomic Occupancy in Myelinating Glia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLopez-Anido, Camila; Sun, Guannan; Koenning, Matthias; Srinivasan, Rajini; Hung, Holly A.; Emery, Ben; Keles, Sunduz; Svaren, John\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMyelin is formed by specialized myelinating glia: oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells in the central and peripheral nervous systems, respectively.

Sox10 interacts with cell type-specific transcription factors at some loci to induce myelin gene expression, but it is largely unknown how Sox10 transcriptional networks globally compare between oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. We used in vivo ChIP-Seq analysis of spinal cord and peripheral nerve (sciatic nerve) to identify unique and shared Sox10 binding sites and assess their correlation with active enhancers and transcriptional profiles in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Sox10 binding sites overlap with active enhancers and critical cell type-specific regulators of myelination, such as Olig2 and Myrf in oligodendrocytes, and Egr2/Krox20 in Schwann cells. Sox10 sites also associate with genes critical for myelination in both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, and are found within super-enhancers previously defined in brain. In Schwann cells, Sox10 sites contain binding motifs of putative partners in the Sp/Klf, Tead, and nuclear receptor protein families. Specifically, siRNA analysis of nuclear receptors Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 revealed downregulation of myelin genes Mbp and Ndrg1 in primary Schwann cells. Our analysis highlights different mechanisms that establish cell type-specific genomic occupancy of Sox10, which reflects the unique characteristics of oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell differentiation.

The results are interpreted as indicating a supramolecular domain pattern of arrangement centered upon the transmembrane protein (P0) molecules. The latter are thought to be surrounded by annuli of substantially immobilized phospholipids. In the lamellar planes particular lipids are considered to have a nonrandom distribution. The visualization of bilayer compartmentalization was seen only in negatively stained sections obtained from unembedded or glutaraldehyde-urea-embedded myelin. Lipids were unextracted in the basic preparations except in so far as some unfixed, amphipathic molecules escaped at the trough-fluid interface at the time of sectioning, an observed phenomenon which probably aided in the visualization of the compartmentalization. Visualization was also augmented by surface tension expanding section fragments as they floated on the trough fluid. All stages of transition between well-ordered myelin and dispersed globular units were commonly to be found. Deliberately delipidated myelin exposed more sharply defined and smaller globular units in bilayer regions, but even these are regarded as being supramolecular aggregates including residual lipid annuli around the transmembrane proteins. The addition of cadmium ions as a \"fixative\" for lecithin seemed to improve the preservation of glutaraldehyde-urea-embedded myelin but was not strictly necessary to reveal its domain structure. A secondary tannic acid fixation was required to process unembedded myelin so as to reveal the fundamental compartmentalization of its lipid bilayers.\n\nMicroglia ablation alleviates myelin-associated catatonic signs in mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJanova, Hana; Arinrad, Sahab; Balmuth, Evan; Mitjans, Marina; Bittner, Robert A.; Pan, Hong; Goebbels, Sandra; Begemann, Martin; Gerwig, Ulrike C.; Langner, SÃ¶nke; Werner, Hauke B.; Davatzikos, Christos; VÃ¶lzke, Henry; West, Brian L.; Reif, Andreas; Grabe, Hans JÃ¶rgen; Nave, Klaus-Armin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe underlying cellular mechanisms of catatonia, an executive âpsychomotorâ syndrome that is observed across neuropsychiatric diseases, have remained obscure.
