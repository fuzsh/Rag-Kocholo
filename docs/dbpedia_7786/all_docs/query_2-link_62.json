In the mammary gland, TRPS1 activity is restricted to the luminal population and is critical during puberty and pregnancy. Its function in the resting state remains however unclear. To evaluate whether it could be a target for cancer therapy, we investigated TRPS1 function in the healthy adult mammary gland using a conditional ubiquitous depletion mouse model where long-term depletion does not affect fitness. Using transcriptomic approaches, flow cytometry and functional assays, we show that TRPS1 activity is essential to maintain a functional luminal progenitor compartment.

        "text": "Tricho-Rhino-Phalangeal Syndrome 1 (TRPS1), the only repressor in the GATA family of transcription factors, was originally identified as a regulator of skeletal and cartilage development. Mutations in the TRPS1 gene cause the autosomal dominant TRP syndrome characterized by skeletal and cranofacial anomalies that are also observed in mice mutants [1]. Trps1 knockout mice or Trps1 loss of function mutants lacking the GATA domain die shortly after birth due to respiratory distress caused by malformations of the rib cage [2, 3]. Recently additional functions for TRPS1 have been uncovered in the development of the mammary gland. There, TRPS1 is required for the initial branching of the mammary ducts at puberty but also plays a crucial role in the lactogenic differentiation during pregnancy [4].\n\nIt is now well established that TRPS1 can act as a context-dependent oncogene in several breast cancer subtypes [4,5,6,7]. In cancer cells, TRPS1 recruits repressor complexes to enhancer sites which is critical for cancer cell proliferation [5, 8]. In particular, TRPS1 represses the activity of the Hippo pathway transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP) to promote immune evasion [5]. TRPS1 also modulates ER binding at enhancer sites to promote ER-dependent cell proliferation [8]. The TRPS1 gene is amplified in about 28% of breast tumors which is associated with poor survival prognosis [5]. TRPS1 activity is particularly high in Luminal B and Basal-like breast cancers which are the most aggressive subtypes [5, 9]. In contrast, in Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (10–15% of BC), TRPS1 can also act as a tumor suppressor, in this case it’s the loss of TRPS1 that, associated to loss of E-Cadherin, drives tumor growth [4]. Therefore, understanding the molecular circuits that determine whether TRPS1 has pro- or anti-oncogenic properties is an important issue.\n\nBreast cancer originates in the mammary gland epithelium, which is composed of two cellular lineages, Keratin8-positive (Krt8pos) luminal cells and Keratin14-positive (Krt14pos) myoepithelial cells forming respectively the inner and outer layer of the mammary ducts. During lactation, the luminal lineage gives rise to milk secretory cells while the contractile basal cells enable milk expulsion. An expansion of aberrant luminal progenitors expressing basal markers is induced by aging or at a young age in BRCA1mut and BRCA2mut carriers [10]. These aberrant progenitors are believed to be the cells of origin of most breast cancer types, and their expansion dramatically increases the risk to develop breast cancer [10,11,12,13,14].\n\nVarious regulators have been shown to control lineage commitment and differentiation in the mammary epithelium. Among them, the hippo transducer TAZ promotes the commitment to the basal lineage. Forced expression of TAZ in luminal cells induces them to adopt basal characteristics and depletion of TAZ in basal cells leads to luminal differentiation [15]. In the luminal lineage Elf5 is exclusively expressed in the luminal progenitors of the resting mammary gland and induces the differentiation into milk-secretory cells during pregnancy. Stat5 is specifically involved in the maintenance and regeneration of the luminal progenitors [16] and Gata3 promotes their differentiation into luminal alveolar cells [17, 18]. Similarly, TRPS1 activity is restricted to the luminal population [4] besides its critical role in lactation, the function it fulfils in the healthy resting mammary gland has not yet been studied. Yet this knowledge would be essential to evaluate whether it could be a future target for cancer therapy.\n\nWith this in mind, we set out to investigate the function of TRPS1 in the homeostasis of the adult mammary epithelium. Using a ubiquitous depletion mouse model where long-term depletion does not affect fitness, we show that TRPS1 activity is essential to maintain a functional luminal progenitor population. Besides the direct repression of YAP/TAZ targets, TRPS1 is required to repress an SRF/MRTF transcriptional program since elevated activity of the mechanosensitive SRF/MRTF circuitry is sufficient to inhibit progenitor function. This repression is indirect and involves a set of TRPS1-regulated genes encoding RhoA modulators. Our work uncovers a hitherto function of TRPS1 in luminal progenitors which is intrinsically linked to mechanotransduction in the mammary gland. It also provides new insights into the oncogenic functions of TRPS1.\n\nA list of reagents (antibodies, chemicals, cytokines, commercial kits) is provided in Additional file 8: Fig. S7. For a detailed description of the experimental procedures including the phenotypic analyses carried out at the german mouse clinic, western blotting, Immunofluoresence, qRT-PCR, RNA-Seq and CUT and RUN See Additional file 8: Fig. S1.\n\nMice\n\nCAG-lsl-RIK, TRE-tGFP-shTrps1#1, shTrps1#2 or shRenilla [19] (Premsrirut, 2011), and CAG-rtTA3 mice lines were obtained from the Mirimus Company (NY, USA). The shRNA sequences can be found in Additional file 8. Details about the husbandry and the breeding of experimental animals can be found in Additional file 8: Figs. S1 and S2. Mice were used for experiments within an age range of 12 to 20 weeks. To induce shRNA expression, the animals were fed with doxycycline-supplemented food (ssniff-Spezialdiäten company, Germany).\n\nSorting mammary epithelial cells by flow cytometry\n\nThe mammary gland epithelial cell isolation method is described in detail in Additional methods. Mammary gland cells were incubated with a mixture of biotin-conjugated lineage antibodies (anti-TER-119, anti-CD31 and anti-CD45, see Additional file 6 : Table S5). After washing in PBS 2% FBS, the cells were stained with fluorophore conjugated antibodies (PE-Anti-mouse EpCAM, APCFire750- anti-mouse CD49f and APC-anti -ckit, PEvio770-anti mouse CD14) and strepatavidin-eFluor450 (Additional file 6: Table S5). For flow cytometric analysis and sorting, stained cells were washed twice, resuspended in PBS 2% FBS, filtered (40 µm cell strainer) and 1 μM SYTOX Blue dead cell stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added. For further details about the sorting procedures see Additional Methods and Additional file 8: Figs. S4, S9 and S11.\n\nCITE-Seq\n\nMammary gland cells were isolated as described in Additional Methods, section CITE-Seq. 0.5 ug of each Total Seq antibodies (anti-EpCAM and anti-CD49f, Additional file 6: Table S5) was added to the cell suspension and the samples were incubated 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed in PBS + BSA 2% + Tween 20 0,01%, counted and adjusted to a concentration of 1000 cells/ µL. Cells were subjected to the Chromium single cell 3’ assay v3 (10X Genomics) as recommended by the manufacturer. After cDNA amplification, ADT-derived cDNAs and mRNA-derived cDNAs were separated based on their size using 0.6 × AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter). The mRNA-derived cDNAs contained in the bead fraction were further processed following the standard 10X Genomics protocol in order to generate single-cell (sc)RNA libraries. The ADT-derived cDNAs contained in the supernatant were further purified (see Additional Methods) and used as template in a PCR reaction with the NEBNext® High Fidelity Master Mix (NEB), a Truseq small RNA RPIx (containing i7 index) primer and the 10X Genomics SI-PCR primer (see Additional file 6: Table S6) to generate the ADT sequencing library. The scRNA-Seq libraries and the ADT libraries were then sequenced together on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform (details Additional file 9 in additional methods).\n\nMammary gland organoids isolation and cultivation\n\nFreshly isolated mouse mammary gland tissue was finely chopped and digested in 2.5 mL of Leibovitz's L-15 Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 3 mg/mL Collagenase A and 1.5 mg/mL Trypsin in a GentleMACS™ Octo dissociator (Miltenyi) for 1 h at 37 °C, 100 rpm. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 medium, filtered (70 µm cell strainer) and centrifuged again. Cells were resuspended in Matrigel (Corning) dispensed in 10 µL-drops in a 48-well plate and cultured in Organoid medium (DMEM/F12 + Glutamax with addition of 1X N-2 Supplement, 1X B27 Supplement, 100 ng/mL Neuregulin, 100 ng/mL Noggin and 100 ng/mL R-spondin) at 37ºC, 5% CO2. Organoids were passaged every 2 to 3 weeks. Details about passaging and dissociating organoids are provided in Additional methods.\n\nMaterial for qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq\n\nFor qRT-PCR, 3000 sorted luminal progenitor/mature cells and about 50,000 isolated mammary organoid cells were used per sample for RNA extractions (Additional file 8: Fig S6). RNA from Luminal mature and progenitor cells was amplified using the \"NEBNext® Single Cell/Low Input cDNA Synthesis & Amplification\" (NEB). For RNA-Seq 20,0000 to 50,000 sorted basal and luminal cells from the shTrps1 ubiquitous mouse model (Additional file 8: Fig S4) and about 1,000 to 15,000 sorted GFP+ mKate2+ sorted luminal cells from the ShTrps1 luminal -specific mouse model (Additional file 8: Fig. S5) were used for RNA isolation and subsequent library preparation. For CUT and RUN, 200,000 sorted luminal cells from wild type mouse were usd per reaction.\n\nColony forming assay\n\nLuminal or luminal progenitor cells were isolated from mouse mammary glands and sorted in 96-well plate filled with 5% FBS EpiCULT full medium (STEMCELL Technologies). 500 luminal cells or 200 luminal progenitors were then transferred to a 48-well plate previously seeded with 10,000 NIH3T3 irradiated feeder cells per well and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 24 h later the medium was exchanged for EpiCULT full medium without FBS. When needed, doxycycline (10 µg/mL), ethanol (1:1000), cytochalasin D (0.2 μM) or the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM) were added to the medium. Cells were incubated for 7 days and medium was exchanged every 2–3 days. Colonies that ultimately formed were fixed for 1 min in methanol and stained in 10% Giemsa staining solution for 20 min.\n\nscATAC-Seq\n\nNuclei suspensions from 60,000 cells isolated from mammary gland organoids were processed using the 10 × Genomics Chromium Controller and Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (CG000496). 7600 nuclei were loaded onto the Chroimium Controller to recover 5000 nuclei for library prepration and sequencing. Total yield and quality of cDNA was assesed on DNA 7500 assay (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). The libraries were pooled and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 System in combination with SP 100 cycles v1.5 kit. The following sequencing cycles were performed: R1 (sequencing of interest: 51 bp; R2 (sequencing of interest): 51 bp; i7 index (sample index): 8 bp; i5 index (10X barcode): 16 bp. Extraction of FastQ files was done using bcl2fastq v2.20.0.422 (Illumina). More details about procedure and data analysis is provided in Additional file 9: Additional methods.\n\nTRPS1 long-term depletion has no deleterious effect in adult female mice\n\nTo systematically analyze whether TRPS1 could potentially be used as a target for cancer therapy, it is vital to understand its role for organismal fitness in the whole body. To this end, we generated a mouse line where we could study the effects of TRPS1 depletion in vivo by depleting it in the whole mouse. Since Trps1 KO mice are not viable we used a model where TRPS1 could be depleted in the adult animal in order to ensure proper embryonic development. In addition, we wanted the depletion to be effective in the whole body to mimic the systemic effect of TRPS1 drug targeting. To fulfill these different criteria, we chose to deplete TRPS1 using ubiquitous doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression and generated a mouse line harboring a TRE-turboGFP-shRNA cassette in the Col1a1 locus and a CAG-rtTA3 transgene (Fig. 1a, Additional file 8: Fig. S1).\n\nWith this model, TRPS1 can be depleted at any time by giving the animals doxycycline via food. The cells expressing the shRNAs can then be identified based on turboGFP (tGFP) expression (Fig. 1a).\n\nWe generated two distinct lines expressing different Trps1 shRNAs, as well as a control line targeting Renilla and verified the efficiency of each Trps1 shRNA in MEFs isolated from transgenic animals (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo evaluate the long-term effects of Trps1 depletion, we subjected our mice to a detailed phenotypic screening over a period of ten weeks (from nine weeks to nineteen weeks of age). About 15 mice for each shTrps1 line were screened together with their respective shRen control litter mates (Fig. 1c, Additional file 8: Fig. S1a). The phenotyping pipeline included various behavioral and neurological tests, a dysmorphology analysis, energy metabolism and cardiac function evaluations, as well as clinical chemistry and immunology screenings (the full screening pipeline is described in Additional file 8: Fig. S2). During the whole screening time, the mice were kept on doxycycline, and their body weight was measured weekly. Because TRPS1 is required for embryonic skeletal and cartilage development, we paid particular attention to the dysmorphology analysis. Full body X-Rays imaging did not reveal genotype-specific anatomical alterations (Fig. 1d). By DXA, bone mineral density (BMD) was slightly increased in the shTrps1#2 line when compared to the respective shRen#2 controls, especially males (Fig. 1e, Additional file 8: Fig. S2). These differences were not as clear with the shTrps1#1 construct (Fig. 1e). Only minor differences in body weight were observed between shTrps1 and control genotypes (Fig. 1f). At the end of the phenotyping pipeline, the animals were sacrificed, and histological analysis carried out on 33 organs/tissues (n = 5 per genotype/sex). No obvious genotype-specific histopathological alterations were found between animals depleted for TRPS1 and controls, including in the mammary gland tissue. Males of both shTrps1 lines also showed altered cardiac function with a lower ejection fraction for both lines and a longer QRS interval for shTrps1#2 animals (Fig. 1g and h). Apart from the minor alterations observed in males, TRPS1 depletion did not cause any significant deleterious effect in female mice. This suggests that systematic TRPS1 inhibition could be a valid therapeutic strategy.\n\nTo clearly define the function of TRPS1 in luminal progenitors (LPs), we isolated LPs and mature cells from WT mice using the c-Kit surface marker [21, 22] (Fig. 3a and Additional file 8: Fig. S6).\n\nAs expected, the mature marker Amphiregulin (Areg) showed higher expression in mature cells compared to progenitors while the progenitor marker Elf5 was expressed at a higher level in the LP fraction (Fig. 3b). Trps1 expression was approximately five times higher in the LP population compared to mature cells (Fig. 3b). To identify the LP-specific gene expression signature, we performed RNA-Seq on c-Kithigh (LP) and c-Kitlow (mature) luminal fractions. Differential gene expression comparing the two sorted populations revealed ~ 4000 differentially expressed genes (Log2FC < 1, padj < 1e-4), we defined a gene signature for each cell type (Fig. 3c, Table S1 and S2). Both signatures were downregulated in the bulk RNA-Seq experiment where we compared shRen vs. shTrps1 luminal cells (Fig. 3d, see also Fig. 2e).\n\nTo test whether Trps1 depletion indeed specifically affected the luminal progenitor population, and to be agnostic to surface marker expression, we isolated total mammary gland cells from shTrps1 and shRen transgenic mice and carried out Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq) experiments to analyze the transcriptome and the abundance of chosen surface markers at the single cell level (Fig. 3e). Cell clustering based on the gene expression data defined 12 different clusters (Fig. 3f). Cluster 3, 4 and 7 corresponded to the luminal population based on the activity of a luminal gene set and the abundance of EpCAM and CD49f surface markers (Fig. 3g and h). Within the luminal population, Cluster 4 was mainly composed of progenitors and cluster 3 of mature cells based on the activity of the luminal progenitor and mature gene sets that we defined in this study (Fig. 3c) and others that were published previously [23] (Fig. 3i and Additional file 8: Fig. S3). This correlated with the mRNA level of selected marker genes (Fig. 3j). We then compared the activity of the progenitor gene set in shTrps1 and control cells in clusters 3 and 4. Trps1 depletion led to a clear downregulation of the luminal progenitor signature in the progenitor cluster 4 but not in the mature cluster 3 (Fig. 3k). In comparison, the mature gene set activity was only slightly affected by Trps1 depletion (Fig. 3k). Selected marker genes followed the same pattern (Fig. 3l). We thus concluded that Trps1 is mainly expressed in the LP compartment and depletion therefore specifically affects the LP population, whereas changes in the mature population may be largely secondary in nature.\n\nTo identify TRPS1-regulated genes or pathways that are required to maintain the luminal progenitor function, we went back to our scRNA-Seq data and performed re-clustering of the luminal population. Among the seven newly identified luminal clusters, cluster 2 contained the LP population and showed prominent Trps1 expression (Fig. 5a). In contrast, mature luminal cells were distributed in clusters 1 and 3 and showed low Trps1 expression (Fig. 5a).\n\nWhen comparing the transcriptome specifically in luminal progenitor cells, we identified 1077 genes (up: 337 genes, down: 740 genes) that were differentially regulated after TRPS1 depletion compared to control (Fig. 5b). The downregulated genes were enriched for processes linked to tissue homeostasis and gland development underlining that TRPS1’s function in the LP population is relevant for the homeostasis of the mammary gland (Fig. 5c). Upregulated genes showed an enrichment for processes related to cytoskeletal dynamics, in particular Actin dynamics (Fig. 5d). In line with that, a TF motif search found Serum Response Factor (SRF)-regulated genes to be specifically overrepresented among the genes that were upregulated after TRPS1 depletion (Fig. 5e). SRF is regulated by actin dynamics and in turn regulates this process through the regulation of cytoskeleton-related genes. This data suggests that TRPS1 is required to restrain SRF activity in LPs. This was further supported by the upregulation of SRF targets in TRPS1-depleted LPs (Fig. 5f, h). SRF/MRTF targets were more abundantly expressed in cluster 4 and 0, which contained cells that neither belonged to the LP cluster 2 nor the more mature clusters 5,3,1 (Fig. 5a, g). This raises the possibility that TRPS1 is required to repress a transcriptional differentiation program that would normally drive them towards cluster 4,0. We thus next identified marker genes for these clusters exclusively in the shRen samples to identify which genes are strongly expressed in clusters 4,0 under unperturbed conditions (Additional file 3: Table S3). Strikingly, the top marker genes of the more distant cluster 0 contained well-known YAP target genes, such as Ctgf, Cyr61, and Klf6, and cluster 4 genes contained known SRF/MRTF target such as Actn1 or Tuba1c (Fig. 5j). Since YAP/TAZ and SRF/MRTF reciprocally potentiate each other’s activity [24] this implies that TRPS1 fulfills the function to restrain these two pathways which gradually become more active from the LP compartment towards cluster 4 and 0 (Fig. 5i, k). CytoTrace analysis on shRen cells revealed that progenitors follow two possible differentiation paths, one leading to mature hormone-responsive ductal cells and a second path leading to non-Hormone-responsive luminal ductal cells which might represent cells that are primed for alveolar differentiation (Fig. 5l).\n\nTo investigate how SRF activity affects the mammary gland, we treated mammary gland organoids from WT mice with cytochalasin D (CD) to stimulate SRF activity. After one day of treatment canonical SRF targets were upregulated (Fig. 5m, n). Concomitantly, LP marker genes were potently downregulated. Surprisingly, Trps1 gene expression itself was also downregulated, suggesting that high Trps1 expression is an inherent feature of the LP gene expression program (Fig. 5n).\n\nTo test whether this might negatively influence the LP function, we performed a colony forming assay with LP isolated from WT mice and treated them with CD (Fig. 5o). LPs treated with CD completely lost their ability to form colonies and this could be rescued by inhibiting SRF activity with the Y27 ROCK inhibitor (Fig. 5p). Y27 treatment also mitigated the effect of shTrps1 expression in LPs in vitro and restored some level of functionality (Additional file 8: Fig. S12). In conclusion, these data show that elevated SRF activity interferes with LP function and demonstrate that TRPS1 fulfills an essential function in the LP compartment of the mammary gland by restraining a mechanosensitive YAP/TAZ-SRF/MRTF gene expression program.\n\nIn this work we have developed a mouse model allowing the conditional ubiquitous depletion of TRPS1 using dox-inducible shRNA expression. We found that this model provided a way to ubiquitously diminish TRPS1 function without affecting the skeleton and cartilage development and early mammary gland development since it allows TRPS1 depletion in the adult animals. TRPS1 has recently emerged as an oncogene in specific breast cancer types. This work thus provides the first indication that targeting TRPS1 with a drug would not result in serious side effects. Indeed, the detailed phenotypic analysis did not reveal any major health issues upon TRPS1 depletion in the female mice who remained healthy over ten weeks of doxycycline treatment. In the future, it will be interesting to see how shTRPS1 mice respond in a breast cancer mouse model. Here, however we focused on the physiologic functions of TRPS1, mainly in the mammary gland.\n\nConsistent with TRPS1 expression being restricted to luminal cells, basal cells barely responded to TRPS1 depletion, whereas the transcriptome of luminal cells-particularly the luminal progenitor compartment-was markedly affected. Consistently, TRPS1 depletion had a negative impact on LP function, e.g. in CFC assays, demonstrating that TRPS1 is essential for these cells. Unexpectedly, we observed that GFP-negative luminal cells from shTrps1 animals formed a higher number of colonies than shRen controls. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms are present in vivo to overcome the reduced functionality of TRPS1-depleted LPs and could explain why we found no apparent changes of the mammary gland histological structure after long-term TRPS1 depletion. A lineage tracing experiment following the fate of each LP over time or the analysis of the transcriptional changes that occur in the GFPlow shTrps1 population upon TRPS1 depletion could help elucidating these mechanisms.\n\nSearching for regulatory pathways that are modulated by TRPS1 to maintain the LP pool and their functionality, we found that TRPS1 represses the SRF/MRTF regulatory pathway linking actin dynamics to SRF-mediated gene transcription. Notably, low SRF activity is crucial to maintain the LP function since hyperactivation of SRF in luminal cells did not only lead to repression of LP marker genes but also completely abolished colony forming abilities in CFC assays whereas ROCK inhibition promoted colony formation.\n\nOur scRNA-Seq pseudotime analysis revealed that the LPs can follow two possible paths of differentiation one leading to mature hormone-sensing cells and the other to a population that could represent hormone receptor-negative committed alveolar precursors [32]. The alveolar branch shows gradual activation of SRF/MRTF as well as YAP/TAZ suggesting that there might be already a priming mechanism in alveolar precursors that would require SRF and YAP activity. In virgin mice, a small number of alveolar cells are differentiated at each estrus cycle, and this number increases during pregnancy [33]. Although in the virgin gland YAP is mainly active in basal cells, at pregnancy it becomes very active in proliferating alveolar cells prior to differentiation of the alveoli [34]. MRTF is crucial to maintain basal cell contractile function during lactation [35], but there is no report of SRF/MRTF playing a role in alveolar differentiation of the luminal cells. However, SRF and YAP are both involved in mechano-transduction, and they have overlapping targets and potentiates each other’s activity [24] so they could cooperate to induce differentiation of alveolar cells. The development of Alveoli and the associated changes in cell morphology is a process that is likely to produce mechanical strain and therefore influence the actin cytoskeleton/SRF activity not only in the basal layer but also in the adjacent luminal alveolar cells [36]. YAP/TAZ activity in luminal cells could also be influenced by mechanical strain, as it is the primary signal stimulating YAP/TAZ activity in the liver [37]. Keeping YAP/TAZ activity in check is crucial in luminal cells since uncontrolled YAP has been shown to trigger overgrowth of aberrant luminal cells expressing basal markers that lead to altered ductal morphology and basal-like BC phenotypes [38]. In any case, TRPS1 needs to repress YAP/TAZ and SRF/MRTF activity to preserve the LP pool by preventing LPs from entering the alveolar differentiation path. Interestingly, YAP/TAZ is repressed directly by TRPS1 by binding to joint sites whereas SRF/MRTF repression seems to be largely indirect, e.g. via repression of a set of genes involved in modulating RhoA activity so that independent mechanisms can assure their stable repression.\n\nIn support of the hypothesis that TRPS1 prevents differentiation, our scATAC-Seq experiments to dissect the early events following TRPS1 depletion in mammary gland organoids revealed a strong activation of Elf5. Elf5 overexpression has been shown to support the differentiation of luminal progenitors into alveolar cells [26]. Concomitantly, GATA motifs become more accessible and this could result in the activation of GATA targets as these sites could be more accessible to GATA activators like GATA3 which is also essential for the differentiation of luminal progenitor cells along the secretory alveolar sublineage [17, 18]. Taken together our results suggest that TRPS1 maintain the LP population mainly by preventing entry in the alveolar differentiation process. This involves the repression of a YAP/SRF mechano-transduction program (Fig. 7).\n\nIn our CUT&RUN experiments from freshly sorted mouse mammary gland cells, we observed a strikingly different binding behavior of TRPS1 compared to ChIP-Seq experiments from cultured breast cancer cells [4, 5, 8]. Whereas in breast cancer cells, TRPS1 mainly bound to enhancer regions via its GATA domain, our CUT&RUN demonstrate a promoter-proximal binding pattern that is potentially mediated by TRPS1’s C2H2 zinc fingers. Whether this is due to technical differences of ChIP-Seq vs. CUT&RUN or whether TRPS1 binding is altered during malignant transformation needs to be addressed in the future. This data implies, however, an important function of TRPS1’s C2H2 zinc fingers for mammary gland function and could potentially explain why no phenotype has been observed in TRPS1 patients where only the GATA zinc finger region is affected.\n\nIn young BRCA1/2 carriers [10] and aged women [11, 39], there is an expansion of aberrant LP population expressing basal traits. These are believed to be the cells of origin of BC and therefore their expansion highly increases the risk to develop breast cancer. Since TRPS1 maintains a functional LP population in the homeostatic mammary gland, it is tempting to speculate that TRPS1 could be one of the drivers of luminal progenitor expansion especially as high levels of TRPS1 have been shown to enhance proliferation by boosting replication both in normal and cancerous mammary epithelial cells [40]. Therefore, targeting TRPS1 at an early stage could be an effective preventive and safe strategy in aged individuals or BRCA1/2 carriers – as suggested by our ubiquitous shTRPS1 mouse model. However, it will be necessary to find a balance between eliminating aberrant LP while preserving the mammary gland epithelium. One must also consider potential compensatory mechanisms that might arise when TRPS1 is depleted/inactivated and might render the treatment inefficient.\n\nHow TRPS1 becomes an oncogene and how it can be targeted most efficiently needs to be addressed in the future and will require the generation of adapted mouse models combining cancer model and shRNA based Trps1 depletion. Since transcription factors such as TRPS1 are very hard to target with small molecules, mostly because of the lack of good binding surface, one would need to consider alternatives to the direct targeting of TRPS1, e.g. by inhibiting crucial corepressor proteins of TRPS1."
