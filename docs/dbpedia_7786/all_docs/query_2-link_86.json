In a multitude of different applications, PVC also contributes to the conservation of energy and resources. The long service life of the products, especially in high-quality construction applications such as flooring, [...]\n\nBest Practice for the Environment: Documentation published\n\nIn the summer, the \"Best Practice for the Environment\" campaign by AGPU, Rewindo and AgPR came to an end after two years. Its aim: to identify and accompany recycling projects in the demolition, dismantling and deconstruction sector, where, for example, old PVC windows or PVC floor coverings accumulate and are recycled via the recycling systems of AgPR and Rewindo. A 28 [...]\n\nFirst recycling project for old windows in Bremen\n\nThe modernisation of the \"Wohlers Eichen\" housing estate in Bremen shows how disused plastic windows can be recycled in an environmentally friendly way during energy-related renovations. The housing company Vonovia SE is currently having the buildings near the free ports of the Hanseatic city with 256 flats renovated in four construction phases. Among other things, the façades are being given additional thermal insulation and new, energy-saving plastic windows. The approximately [...]\n\nBest practice for the environment: 700 windows replaced\n\nThe energetic refurbishment of the secondary school in Jessen (Elster) is considered an instructive example in environmental matters.

Furthermore, new plastic windows with triple glazing now ensure an additional improvement in the [...]\n\nEnvironmental Magazine: \"Established recycling of PVC building products\".\n\nIn the current July issue of UMWELTMAGAZINS (Springer-VDI-Verlag), a new technical article by AGPU Managing Director Thomas Hülsmann and AGPU Editor Michael Friedrichs on the topic of \"Established recycling of PVC building products\" has appeared on pages 27 and 28. Due to the good response in the past, AGPU has also decided to publish the technical article as an offprint.\n\nBVSE and AGPU: Positive development in recycling solutions for the building material PVC\n\nOn the occasion of the 21st Waste Plastics Day in Bad Neuenahr, the German Association for Secondary Raw Materials and Waste Disposal (Bundesverband Sekundärrohstoffe und Entsorgung e.V. - bvse) and the Working Group PVC and the Environment (Arbeitsgemeinschaft PVC und Umwelt e.V. - AGPU) drew a positive interim balance for the recycling of PVC as a building material. PVC has numerous long-lasting applications in the building sector. Here, proven products such as windows, pipes, floor coverings, roofing and sealing membranes or cable sheathing are particularly [...]\n\nPVC Recycling Campaign at the 24th Demolition Conference\n\nThe 24th Demolition Conference will take place in Berlin from 2 to 3 March 2018.
