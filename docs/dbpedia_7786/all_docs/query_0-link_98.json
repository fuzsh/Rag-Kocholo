        "text": "This thread is for my fictional high-speed project. I will be posting updates, polls and various screenshots from the development here.\n\nBasic Info:\n\n- Route planning will be done via polls if this project gains enough attention. First line is Berlin - Leipzig.\n\n- Route lenght and path is fictional, real are only names.\n\n- Signal / Speed system on HS lines is created to be as close to PZB and LZB as possible with current available assets. Therefore needing the HUD to be enabled.\n\n- Signal / Speed system on Regional lines are regular AŽD (Czechoslovak - due to their unlimited options of programming and simplicity, and my lack of knowledge of German signals) signals and speed signs (unless LZB wire is present, in which case driving with HUD is required).\n\n- Planned consists: ICE1, ICE2, Velaro D\n\n- Planned operations: Stage 1 - Passenger only\n\nTerminology:\n\n- Branch Lines: up to 100km/h\n\n- Main Lines: up to 120km/h\n\n- Regional Lines: up to 160km/h\n\n- Lower-high-speed (LHS): 160km/h - 200km/h\n\n- High-speed (HS): 200km/h - 320km/h\n\n- Super-high-speed (SHS): 320km/h - 400km/h\n\n- Ultra-high-speed (UHS): above 400km/h\n\nMain goal: If enough people show interest, I will be expanding this route alongside Central Europe until I connect all major cities of Germany, perhaps something in the neighbouring countries too (Paris, Amsterdam, Wien, etc.).\n\nThis project is Freeware and on DLS. However, once / if the route file size will be greater than DLS file size limit, I will be uploading the route as payware.\n\nProgress update:\n\nJüterbog is 50% finished.\n\nNext thing to do is catenary within the station platforms.\n\nAfter that, the hardest part of the station layout will be the flyover connection with regional lines.\n\n_ __________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOther News:\n\nI am doing testing runs with Euromodeller ´s new Swiss EMU. In real life it should be limited to 200km/h, but I managed to get it up to 320km/h on the first run. As such, I will be on lookout for an enginespec which will limit the speed to 200km/h. If I won´t find such enginespec, I will try to find something with reasonably close top speed.\n\nIf the resulting replacement enginespec will be:\n\nAbove 200km/h - Train could be used as stopping service for High-speed sections of the route. (HS sections: 200km/h - 320km/h)\n\nAt or Below 200km/h - Train could be used as express service only for lower-high-speed sections of the route. (LHS sections: 160km/h - 200km/h)\n\nHowever even with replacement, I do not have plans to use it on current stage of the route, because after all, it is Swiss train. Which means that it could be only used if I ever get South of Munich.\n\nCurrent progress update:\n\nStage 1: Berlin - Leipzig (55% finished)\n\nCurrent WIP area: Jüterbog - Leipzig\n\nJüterbog has now been finished. Last thing to do are platform decorations, but those will generally be the last thing to do at all the stations.\n\nStation\n\nSouthern Intersection with Regional line (to Leipzig)\n\nNorthern end (to Berlin)\n\nMap overview\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nYou may have also noticed that I removed the \"Freeware\" tag of this project. Let me explain.\n\nSeveral people have told me that this project is already payware quality. I myself am conflicted about this and don´t think that this is payware quality. However I think I will give it a shot.\n\nThe freeware part of the route will remain Berlin - Leipzig (including freight facilities) and at least 2 additional regional lines connecting to this area and the circular line around Berlin, including a High-speed train yard / depo / workshop in the East, regular train yard / depo / workshop in the North and freight yard / unloading / loading in the West of the circular.\n\nAfter that if I and others will be interested enough in continuing this project further, the additional high-speed lines and surrounding areas could become payware.\n\nNow, this is not official and I have not decided yet. But if I go for it, you can expect something as described above, unless my entire idea of the route changes.\n\nYes that town. I am sorry for misspelling that. I even double checked\n\nI did type it correctly on the message next to the poll, but not in the actual poll XD\n\nThank You for the compliments!\n\nYeah it was little bit of moving around, but it was quite easy. Most time on my side was spent on random things around my life so the progress was a little bit slow. Now some friends hooked me up on Snowrunner so I am trying to divide the work and fun time accordingly. However the development time should not take any hits from now.\n\nI will take the poll results in mind when I reach the area of the first station.\n\nCurrent progress update:\n\nStage 1: Berlin - Leipzig (70% finished)\n\nCurrent WIP area: Bad Schmiedeberg - Bad Düben\n\nWork is starting on the stretch of tracks between the two towns.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHello! It´s been quite a while since the last update on this project, so I figured I might post something. Since the 24th of September I progressed only a little, approximately 10 kilometers.\n\nSo, what is new?\n\nThe town and station of Jessen are 95% finished. As with other stations, I am missing only the platform decorations. The tracks split north of Jessen to allow for regional line connection from the South, to accompany the connection from North at Jüterbog. This connection will be finished when I begin work on the regional lines. Speed at platforms is 100km/h.\n\nThe town and station of Bad Schmiedeberg are 90% finished. Here I just have to add grass and platform decoartions.\n\nThis station is a bit unique and that is because it only has 2 tracks, rather than 4. However, the speed of the trains through the platforms will stay at 200km/h. As such, I had to create this station with additional safety for passengers, and that is a glass panel fence at the edge of the platforms. This comes with more limitations as well. I wanted the regional trains which stop at these stations to be Flirt 3. There are 4 and 5 car versions.\n\nHowever, as you can see, the 4 car and 5 car versions have different door placement. The platforms are 200 meters long, which means they can fit 2x Flirt 3 sets couple together. The 5 car sets however, are very symmetrical. So much that no matter the orientation and order of being couple together (front 1 to front 1 or front 1 to front 2), they will have doors at exact same positions every single time. This means that only 5 car Flirt 3 sets are allowed to stop at this station. This is one of the two unique stations I plan on this line. These two unique stations will require precise stopping of trains.\n\nThe margin of error in stopping position is minimal and correct stopping points will be marked with H signs.\n\nI have decided for this desing because I thought it would be more unique and bring a little bit of challenge to the player.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAdditional screenshots"
