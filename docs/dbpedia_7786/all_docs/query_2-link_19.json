        "text": "Dr. Stephan Dudeck\n\nAffiliate Scholar (Alumni)\n\nOn Social Media\n\nStephan Dudeck is an anthropologist working in close collaboration with Siberian indigenous peoples and conducted since 1993 long-term anthropological fieldwork with Siberian reindeer herding communities. For more than 20 years, he has been engaged in social science research at the crossroads of science and social activism. His scholarly interest grew with social engagement in Indigenous struggles for sustainable futures, land and resource rights and the preservation of Indigenous rights to self-definition in the face of dispossessions and resettlements by the state and the oil industry. He established close relations and friendships with Indigenous partners, some of which have already lasted for more than 25 years. In the years after his dissertation on Indigenous self-representation and resilience in Russia's oil-provinces in Western Siberia, he has expanded his collaborative projects by conducting research in oral history and later, by invitation of his Indigenous friends, on the preservation of their cultural heritage. He is a research fellow in Arctic Studies at the University of Tartu, Estonia and has worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Social Anthropology, Arctic Centre of the University of Lapland and the Centre for Arctic Social Studies at the European University at Saint Petersburg."
