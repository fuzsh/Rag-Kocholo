Nueva Pescanova Group subsidiary Pescanova USA is adding a new Toss & Serve Shrimp line to its U.S. portfolio. The line is part of Pescanova USA’s broader ready-to-cook range and features sustainably-farmed white shrimp. The three sauce pairings are chipotle sea salt, citrus herb, and salted butter with garlic.

Stores are currently carrying the Toss & Serve Shrimp line, which includes ready-to-cook products that prepared in less than 10 minutes, according to the company. Pescanova USA plans to roll out other additions to the Toss & Serve Shrimp line, such as Pescanova Chef Ready Portions for its foodservice partners, set for a May 2020 launch.

“We are very excited to make shrimp dinners accessible to anyone who wants it, regardless of their cooking skills or time constraints”, Pescanova USA CEO Chris Maze said. “We believe sustainable seafood should be a part of everyone’s diet, and this is just one expression of that goal.”
