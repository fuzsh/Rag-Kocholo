Pescanova is the world's leading shrimp company, based in Galicia, and has just opened a subsidiary in France (it previously marketed its products in over 80 countries).

Pescanova operates more than 70 boats, bringing in some 65,000 tonnes of shrimp every year. Some of the company's products also come from aquaculture.

The brand markets its cooked shrimp without benchmarks. Its ambition is to increase its share of the frozen food market (currently only 2% in France).
