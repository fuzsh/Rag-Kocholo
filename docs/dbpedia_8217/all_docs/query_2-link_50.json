        "text": "Nueva Pescanova is planning to build three ships for Namibia and four for Mozambique, with a total investment of EUR 42.5 million, according to the company.\n\nWith this investment, which is in line with its strategic plan, it intends to provide NovaNam, a subsidiary of Nueva Pescanova in Namibia, with the vessels needed to reach the planned catch volume.\n\nThe Namibian vessels will be 50 metres in length and will be used for hake fishing, mainly to supply the Lüderitz factory while Mozambique vessels will be smaller, less than 30 metres, and will be used for shrimp fishing.\n\nIn the framework of International Frozen Seafood Fair Conxemar, the CEO of Nueva Pescanova Group, Ignacio González, along with other executives of the firm, presented the prototype of the three trawlers to be built for NovaNam’s fleet to the Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources of Namibia, Bernhard Esau.\n\nNovaNam employs 2,100 workers in the country, of whom 1,800 work in Luderitz, where Pescanova has the largest hake processing centre in Africa and 300 employees in Walvis Bay factory.\n\nOn the other hand, the company has appointed Marcos Osuna as director of fisheries for Latin America, where he will also be appointed in the position of general manager of the subsidiary Argenova, in Argentina.\n\nThe management of Latam Pesca (integrated in the General Fisheries Directorate of Nueva Pescanova Group) covers the business of the Galician multinational firm in Peru (Novaperu), Uruguay (Belnova) and Argentina (Argenova), countries in which the group has a fleet of 20 boats. In this area, the company has a factory in Peru of about 100 employees, and another one in Argentina, with more than 700 people.\n\nSource: FIS"
