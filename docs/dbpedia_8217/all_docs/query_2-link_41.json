        "text": "President of Guatemala visits Nueva Pescanova Group subsidiary. Novaguatemala, subsidiary of the Nueva Pescanova Group, located in Champerico, Guatemala, received a visit from President of Guatemala, Alejandro Giammattei, who toured the facilities accompanied by Minister of Economy, Antonio Malouf, and numerous authorities.\n\nThis visit was aimed at learning more about the company’s work in the country, where Novaguatemala has a high value-added seafood processing plant, especially for prawns, employing 1,000 people. Accompanied by Mike Corser, general manager of Novaguatemala, and following the strictest safety and hygiene measures, the authorities toured the facilities and learned about the prevention measures put in place by the company to protect the health of all its workers. Among others, since the beginning of the health crisis, the company has been carrying out strict cleaning and disinfection processes, safety controls among work teams and prevention campaigns.\n\nOver the course of the day, the president of Guatemala conveyed a message of encouragement and congratulations to the workers for their work. He also congratulated the company for its contribution to the economic and social development of the area through job creation, the implementation of training programmes or collaboration with local entities and agencies. Among other examples, Novaguatemala manages the educational centre “Centro Experimental del Pacífico (CEPAC)” in Champerico, which offers training to children until they graduate and has a training programme for adults.\n\nMr. Giammattei stated: “It is a pleasure to visit Pescanova and see the excellent job they do as a company, but not just any company, but a company with a high degree of social responsibility. Thank you for what you do for our people”.\n\nIn turn, Mike Corser, general director of Novaguatemala, considered the visit “a great milestone for the company, since it has allowed us to promote the work we do, the role of the sector as an engine of growth and employment in the country and the strong social commitment we have in the Champerico region”."
