'Showman' Subhash Ghai got on stage to receive it from his Ram Lakhan actors Anil Kapoor and Jackie Shroff. Shraddha Kapoor also paid tribute to Mr Ghai by performing on songs from his films like Taal and Kisna.\n\n\"I grew up dancing on 'Taal se taal mila' in front of the mirror and today I got the opportunity to perform on the song on this platform,\" said the 26-year-old actress.\n\nOther performers included Parineeti Chopra and Anushka Sharma, who made everyone swing as she danced to the tunes of songs from her latest film Dil Dhadakne Do. Sonakshi Sinha did a medley of songs from films of Amitabh Bachchan and other superstars.\n\nA special tribute to Shah Rukh and Kajol's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, which completed 1,000 weeks of screening last year, was paid by the show's hosts, who also cracked jokes on their controversial AIB Roast video for which they got into trouble earlier this year.\n\nThere were also moments when Ranveer got \"distracted\" due to presence of Deepika, with whom he is currently being linked romantically.\n\nHeld at Putra Indoor Stadium, the award ceremony was attended by thousands of screaming fans, some of which had flown from different countries just to see their favourite stars at the gala, which celebrates Indian cinema in various foreign nations every year.\n\nList of Winners\n\nBest Picture: Queen\n\nBest Performance in a Leading Role (Female): Kangana Ranaut for Queen\n\nBest Performance in a Leading Role (Male): Shahid Kapoor for Haider\n\nBest Direction: Rajkumar Hirani for PK\n\nBest Story: Vikas Bahl, Chaitally Parmar & Parvez Shaikh for Queen\n\nWoman of The Year: Deepika Padukone\n\nBest Regional Film: Lal Bhaari\n\nBest Performance in a Supporting Role (Female): Tabu for Haider\n\nBest Performance in a Supporting Role (Male): Riteish Deshmukh for Ek Villian\n\nBest Playback Singer (Female): Kanika Kapoor for Baby Doll\n\nBest Playback Singer (Male): Ankit Tiwari for Galliyaan from Ek Villian\n\nAward for Outstanding Contribution: Subhash Ghai\n\nbest Performance in a Negative Role: Kay Kay Menon (Haider)\n\nBest Debut (Male): Tiger Shroff (Heropanti)\n\nBest Debut (Female): Kriti Sanon (Heropanti)\n\nBest Performance in a Comic Role: Varun Dhawan (Main Tera Hero)\n\nBest Music Direction: Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy for 2 States\n\nBest Debut Direction: Omung Kumar for Mary Kom and Sajid Nadiadwsla for Kick\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
