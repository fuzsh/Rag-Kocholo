        "text": "It’s difficult to isolate Lena Raine’s compositions from the games in which they appear; the pulsing electronica of Celeste is core to my memory of pushing through its grueling platforming challenges, and the tender piano melodies in Chicory: A Colorful Tale feel inherently tied to its story of artistic struggle. Raine’s work truly fits the worlds in which it appears, a testament to her songwriting prowess.\n\nPolygon asked her some questions about her process as part of Polygon FM, our theme week celebrating the intersection of music and games.\n\nPolygon: Was there a game soundtrack or song that inspired you to pursue creating game music? Can you set the scene of what that felt like for you, and why the music was so effective?\n\nLena Raine: So much of my music really owes a lot to discovering the soundtracks of Yasunori Mitsuda and Yoko Shimomura. Both had a bit of a parallel experience where I first discovered them through an SNES game (Chrono Trigger for Mitsuda, and Super Mario RPG for Shimomura, though I would have also heard her work while obsessively playing through Adventures in the Magic Kingdom years before), and then fell in love with their music and how it affected the emotional journey of a game once it had been further developed for a PS1 RPG.\n\nIn Mitsuda’s case, it was Xenogears, and while I knew his music in Chrono Trigger was incredible, Xenogears itself fully blew me away with its ability to carry forward entire genres and unique styles and themes for its characters. I fell in deep into the Xeno series, and it thankfully never let me go. For Shimomura, it was discovering the two very different scores for Legend of Mana and Parasite Eve, both games that instantly transported me into their worlds, and in the latter’s case showed me that even extremely electronic music can have its place in story-driven games.\n\nCan you break down one of your own songs and its influences? Was it inspired by game soundtracks, other music, or something else?\n\nOne of my favorite pieces I’ve had a chance to work on was “The Mountain Top” from Chicory: A Colorful Tale.\n\nIt’s one of the rare opportunities where I’ve been able to work as a songwriter and collaborate with an incredibly talented singer, in this case the legendary Emi Evans (from NieR fame). When we were wrapping up development on Chicory, I asked Greg Lobanov (the lead creator) if I could write a vocal credits song. It was always a dream of mine, ever since late-’90s-me played through countless RPGs with the now-traditional vocal theme capping it all off. In this case it made a lot of sense, because earlier in the game, the two lead characters sing on a mountaintop as part of the Wielder Trials. It’s a song that evokes the uncertainty and doubt that comes from being an artist, something I felt really strongly as something to evoke in the songwriting. Greg wrote the lyrics, and I worked with both Emi and a very talented crew of musicians to bring it to life.\n\nA source of inspiration outside games that I hold really close to my heart is the music of Yoko Kanno, and her frequent collaborations with singer and actor Maaya Sakamoto. She wrote a ton of songs for one of my earliest obsessions, The Vision of Escaflowne, an anime about a girl being magicked away to a hidden world. The details don’t really matter there, but it was that style of songwriting that I tried to channel for the piece, and I’m just really pleased with how it all turned out.\n\nWhat are the main instruments used to record the soundtrack for Celeste? How did you choose those instruments?\n\nPretty much everything used in Celeste can be narrowed down to two instruments: the digital synthesizer Massive by Native Instruments, and Felt Piano by Spitfire (though I’ve since moved on to a piano called Noire by Native Instruments). Every single synth patch was something I designed using the fairly simple parameters in Massive, and I even wrote a pretty detailed article about some of the patches specifically. I also used a number of percussion samples & drum loops from Ableton Live & other loop packs (which also has a Medium article)! The decision to use a combination of synths and piano came pretty organically from the first track I finished for the game, First Steps. The team didn’t have any specific sound they were going for, but I thought that the descending piano arpeggio was a great start to capture the falling snow of Celeste mountain. The rest came as I tried to find a sound that evoked NES era platformers without trying to go for a hyper specific chiptune sound. Instead, I used simple waveforms to create leads, pads & basses that felt modern, but derived from the same waveforms that created classic console chipsets.\n\nIs there anything else we should know about your approach to composing video game music?\n\nHonestly, the main thing I’m always trying to do any time I write new music, is to do something new. The world’s too big to close yourself off and only write one style over and over. It’s hard when a client wants you to keep repeating yourself, but seeking out new opportunities, new styles, new collaborations... That’s the energy that keeps me going. When I got into writing music well over 20 years ago, I never for the life of me thought I’d be writing a pirate-themed ska tune for a boss theme, or a Nine Inch Nails-inspired character theme. If I can keep finding projects that surprise me and get me to rethink how I write music, I’ll keep writing forever."
