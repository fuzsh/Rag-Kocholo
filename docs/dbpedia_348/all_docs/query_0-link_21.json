        "text": "Akshay Kumar, Bollywood's ‘Khiladi,’ has experienced a slump at the box office since 2022. Despite Akshay having nine theatrical releases since 2022, only one film, 'OMG 2', achieved success and became one of the highest-grossing films of 2023. As Akshay prepares to release his upcoming multi-starrer comedy-drama 'Khel Khel Mein', the spotlight is on whether he will bounce back with a hit or continue his streak of underperforming films. Let's review his recent releases ahead of the new film's debut.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\n‘Sarfira’: Akshay Kumar's most recent theatrical release, 'Sarfira', a remake of the National Award-winning Tamil film 'Soorarai Pottru' (2022), failed to replicate the original's success. Based on GR Gopinath's memoir 'Simply Fly: A Deccan Odyssey', 'Sarfira' marked Akshay's 150th film as a leading hero, but unfortunately, it was deemed a box office flop, grossing only Rs 30 crore worldwide. The film, which also starred Radhika Madan and Paresh Rawal, couldn't match the acclaim and success of the original movie which starred Suriya.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\n\n‘Bade Miyan Chote Miyan’ (2024): ‘Bade Miyan Chote Miyan,’ produced by Vashu Bhagnani and Jackky Bhagnani, tells the story of two former Indian army officers who reunite to save the nation from a looming threat. The film features Akshay and Tiger Shroff in lead roles, with Prithviraj Sukumaran as the antagonist, and supporting performances from Manushi Chhillar, Sonakshi Sinha, and Ronit Roy. Despite its ambitious budget of Rs. 350 crore, the film received overwhelmingly negative reviews upon its release in April and proved to be a commercial disaster, grossing only Rs. 102.16 crore at the box office.\n\n‘Mission Raniganj: The Great Bharat Rescue’ (2023): Tinu Suresh Desai's disaster-thriller film, produced by Pooja Entertainment, was ironically a box office disaster. Based on the true story of the Raniganj Coalfields Collapse in West Bengal, the film starred Akshay as Jaswant Singh Gill, a heroic mining engineer who rescued 65 trapped miners. Parineeti Chopra played the role of Gill's wife. Unfortunately, the film failed to resonate with audiences, grossing a mere Rs. 45 crore at the box office, making it a commercial flop.\n\n‘OMG2’ (2023): Since 2022, Akshay's sole box office success has been 'OMG 2', a spiritual sequel to the 2012 hit film 'OMG - Oh My God!'. Starring alongside Pankaj Tripathi, Akshay shines in this film directed by Amit Rai, which tackles the crucial topic of sex education in India. Produced on a budget of Rs. 60 crore, 'OMG 2' achieved impressive earnings of Rs. 221.08 crore, surpassing the collections of its predecessor and solidifying its position as a commercial triumph.\n\n‘Selfiee’ (2023): Raj Mehta's 'Selfiee', a remake of the 2019 Malayalam film 'Driving Licence', featured Akshay Kumar and Emraan Hashmi in lead roles, with Nushrratt Bharuccha and Diana Penty playing the female leads. The movie revolves around the rivalry between a renowned actor and an RTO officer. Despite its promising premise, 'Selfiee' underperformed at the box office, grossing only Rs. 23.63 crore worldwide on a budget of Rs. 100 crore, resulting in a significant commercial loss.\n\nHis performance in 2022: In 2022, Akshay Kumar appeared in six films, including the OTT release 'Cuttputtli' and a cameo in 'An Action Hero'. The remaining four films, 'Bacchhan Paandey', 'Samrat Prithviraj', 'Raksha Bandhan', and 'Ram Setu', unfortunately, failed to impress audiences and tanked at the box office, making them commercial disappointments."
