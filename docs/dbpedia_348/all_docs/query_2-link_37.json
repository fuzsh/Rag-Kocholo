        "text": "It's that time of the year when Bollywood gears up to celebrate the finest cinematic achievements at one of the most prestigious awards ceremonies in India - the Filmfare Awards. The Filmfare Awards are presented annually by The Times Group to honour both the artistic and technical excellence of professionals in the film industry of India. The Filmfare ceremony is one of the oldest film events in India. The awards were first introduced in 1954. Hindi cinema has given some exceptional magical moments over the years that will be cherished and remembered for a lifetime. Filmfare continues to contribute to this legacy by honouring the stalwarts who are redefining Hindi cinema. For decades, the elegant and prestigious Black Lady has been the epitome of credibility and success in the world of Indian cinema.\n\nCheck out the complete winners list of the 68th Filmfare Awards 2023!\n\nThe 68th Hyundai Filmfare Awards 2023 with Maharashtra Tourism promises to be a star-studded celebration of the best Hindi cinema had to offer in 2022. As we gear up for the latest edition of the ceremony, we take a look back at actors who have won the most number of Filmfare awards for Best Actor.\n\nDilip Kumar - 8 Times\n\nShah Rukh Khan - 8 Times\n\nAmitabh Bachchan - 5 times\n\nHrithik Roshan - 4 Times\n\nRajesh Khanna, Naseeruddin Shah, Aamir Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh - 3 Times\n\nRaj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar and Anil Kapoor have all won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor 2 Times\n\nDilip Kumar - 8 Times\n\nDilip Kumar was not just a name - he was a phenomenon. An icon in all its glory, his filmography reflects a superlative range of films that only went on to show what a terrific actor he was and the lasting impression he left behind. Dilip Kumar’s life is nothing less than a leaf from some of his films. It’s indeed a miracle that a former fruit merchant went on to become India’s greatest actor. The actor has won 8 Filmfare Awards for Best Actor (Daag, Azaad, Devdas, Naya Daur, Kohinoor, Leader, Ram Aur Shyam, Shakti). His other Filmfare trophies include Lifetime Achievement Award given in 1994 and a Special Award for contribution to cinema in 2004.\n\nShah Rukh Khan - 8 Times\n\nThere are a few stories in Bollywood that exist in the no man’s land between reality and legend. They usually begin with the words “it is said” or “I read it somewhere once”. One such story happens to be about Shah Rukh Khan, his dream and the city of Mumbai. Legend has it that a long time ago, way before he became the superstar that he is today, Khan stood on Marine Drive, looked across the sea at the setting sun and declared: “I’ll rule this city one day”. Shah Rukh Khan is tied for the most Filmfare Awards in this category with Dilip Kumar for films like Baazigar (1993), Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Devdas (2002), Swades (2004), Chak De! India (2007) and My Name Is Khan (2010).\n\nAmitabh Bachchan - 5 times\n\nAmitabh Bachchan’s greatest contribution to Indian cinema has been his redefining of the conventional Hindi hero in its varied forms represented by Ashok Kumar followed by the golden trio of Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand. The sheer number of films he has worked in, the milestone performances among them, his versatility as an actor, his adaptation to the changing demands of cinema to his ageing factor and most importantly, his innovative redefining of the conventional hero of Hindi cinema dominated by romance, family values, melodrama, villainy and song-dance numbers placed him in the minds of Indian audience for a long time. Amitabh Bachchan has won 5 Filmfare awards in the category of Best Actor for his roles in films such as Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Don (1978), Hum (1991), Paa (2010) among others. In 1991, he became the first artist to receive the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award, which was established in the name of Raj Kapoor. Bachchan was crowned Superstar of the Millennium in 2000 at the Filmfare Awards. Amitabh Bachchan holds a unique record of receiving nominations in this category in 6 decades (1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s) and winning an award in 4 decades.\n\nHrithik Roshan - 4 Times\n\nOne of the most well-known and adored actors in the nation, Hrithik Roshan has enjoyed three decades of superstardom. From the moment he starred as the only protagonist in Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, the actor became an overnight celebrity. From that point on, there was no turning back as the actor continued to produce films that were not only financially successful but also memorable and had a high recall value. Hrithik's love for acting began when he was a young child, and in order to advance his dream, he declined a degree from the prestigious UCLA College in the United States in order to master the fundamentals of filmmaking from scratch. Hrithik has won in the category of Best Actor 4 times. Hrithik Roshan not only won Best Debut for Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai also bagged the prestigious category of Best Actor for the very first time. He then went on to win Dhoom 2 (2006) and Jodhaa Akbar (2008) among others.\n\nRajesh Khanna, Naseeruddin Shah, Aamir Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh - 3 Times\n\nRajesh Khanna took over in the 1970s with 3 wins. Naseeruddin Shah emerged successful in the 1980s with 3 wins. Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh led the 2010s with 3 wins to their credit.\n\nRaj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar and Anil Kapoor have all won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor 2 Times\n\nThis year, the Filmfare Awards promises to be filled with entertainment and other fun-filled endless moments. The 68th Hyundai Filmfare Awards 2023 with Maharashtra Tourism will be held on April 27, 2023, at the Jio World Conventional Centre in Mumbai. Salman Khan will host the 68th Hyundai Filmfare Awards 2023 with Maharashtra Tourism for the very first time, alongside co-host Maniesh Paul and Ayushmann Khurrana. Industry stalwarts such as Vicky Kaushal, Tiger Shroff, Janhvi Kapoor, Govinda and Jacqueline Fernandez are all ready to set the stage on fire with their breathtaking performances. This glamorous extravaganza will be broadcast on Colors the next day, April 28, 2023, at 9 PM. Hyundai Motor India, as the Title Partner, will be an integral part of the celebration, along with Maharashtra Tourism as the Destination Partner.
