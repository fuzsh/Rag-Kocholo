        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nJeffrey Wright has had one of the most varied and distinguished acting careers of recent decades.\n\nWhile best known in supporting roles, he's now received his first Oscar nomination as the lead in \"American Fiction,\" a film itself nominated for best picture.\n\nJeffrey Brown spoke with him for our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nJeffrey Wright:\n\nI usually have to reshape myself to find a character. I like working that way. I like to create characters, a different man, from one film to another. It allows me to be useful in many — across many different genres.\n\nJeffrey Wright:\n\nI have had people say, I didn't even realize that was you in the two movies I watched last week. I didn't realize — I didn't recognize you from one to the other. I like that.\n\nACTRESS:\n\nYo, Sharonda, where you be going in a hurry like that?\n\nIf you got to know, I was going to the pharmacy.\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\n\"American Fiction,\" directed by first-time director Cord Jefferson, who adapted it from Percival Everett's novel \"Erasure,\" is partly a send-up of today's publishing industry.\n\nFacing more rejection, Monk writes an over-the-top street version of Black life using a pseudonym. To his shock, publishers love it. He's finally got a bestseller, except it's not a work he stands by, and it's not technically by him.\n\nJeffrey Wright:\n\nOh, yes, certainly.\n\nAnd I don't think it's restricted to the publishing world or to the world of film. I think it's across our culture that there's preconceptions or misrepresentations of who we are as individuals. I don't think it's necessarily confined to the Black experience either, this idea of not being seen.\n\nI certainly understand the pressures that the character feels. I don't think that I necessarily share his frustration and rage. I think, maybe because of the way I work, I have been able to work my way around some of those obstacles that have been put in my way. I can't complain about my career.\n\nJeffrey Wright:\n\nI'm just better than that, just by being better than the resistance to who I am as an artist.\n\nI have always thought that if I was good at what I did and I worked hard at it, that everything else would flow from that. When I was younger as an actor, I didn't want to make money. I just wanted to…\n\nJeffrey Wright:\n\nI wanted to pay my rent, but it wasn't — I wasn't doing it to pursue a lot of money. I wanted to be good at what I had chosen to do. I wanted to be a good actor.\n\nAnd I figured everything else would take care of itself.\n\nJeffrey Wright:\n\nSo I had kids, and trying to make sure that she was well. The pandemic rushed in. And, yes, I was feeling pressure from a lot of sides.\n\nAnd you kind of — as the character in the film realizes, that kind of youthful, blissful delusion that, as you get older, life will become easier, yes, I was disabused of…\n\nJeffrey Wright:\n\nYes, I think it's important when your peers and colleagues say, well done, when they show appreciation for the work and in this case for the film in such a generous way. Yes. Yes, that has meaning.\n\nThe thing that I like, that I have grown to appreciate about working on film is my responsibility when the camera rolls.\n\nJeffrey Wright:\n\nIt's to fill up the frame with whatever aspect of the story I'm responsible for. But that represents everyone's work. It represents the electricians' work, the gaffers, the grips, the people who work in the administrative office. It's all about what's happening in the frame at any given moment.\n\nAnd when it's my responsibility to be that in that place, I like it. But I like that I'm a part of a larger whole. And that's my gig, is to tell the story."
