Each year, this select group of film enthusiasts, filmmakers, professionals and academics participates in illuminating discussions with directors, actors, producers and screenwriters before announcing their selections for the best work of the year. Since first citing year-end cinematic achievements in 1929, NBR has recognized a vast selection of outstanding studio, independent, foreign-language, animated and documentary films, often propelling recipients such as Peter Farrelly’s Green Book and George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road into the larger awards conversation. In addition, one of the organization’s core values is identifying new talent and nurturing young filmmakers by awarding promising talent with ‘Directorial Debut’ and ‘Breakthrough Actor’ awards as well as grants to rising film students. With its continued efforts to assist up-and-coming artists in completing and presenting their work, NBR honors its commitment to not just identifying the best that current cinema has to offer, but also ensuring the quality of films for future generations to come.\n\nJoin the conversation @NBRfilm\n\nPress Contacts:\n\nAndy Gelb / Shawn Purdy / Lindsey Brown – SLATE PR\n\nandy@slate-pr.com / shawn@slate-pr.com / lindsey@slate-pr.com\n\nTo request credentials to cover the NBR Gala Red Carpet please fill out the application form HERE"
