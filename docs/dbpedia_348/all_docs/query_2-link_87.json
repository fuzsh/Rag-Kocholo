        "text": "Switzerland's Locarno Film Festival opens on Wednesday with Shah Rukh Khan, Jane Campion, Alfonso Cuaron and Irene Jacob set to be honoured with special awards.\n\nFounded in 1946, Locarno is one of the world's longest-running annual film festivals and focuses on auteur cinema.\n\nHeld on the shores of Lake Maggiore, in the Italian-speaking Ticino region of southern Switzerland, films are screened in Locarno's central square -- a feature of Swiss national life depicted on the country's 20-franc banknotes.\n\nThe open-air Piazza Grande holds up to 8,000 moviegoers, and films are shown on one of the largest screens in the world.\n\nBollywood superstar Khan, 58, will on Saturday be given the Pardo alla Carriera award for people whose artistic contributions have redefined cinema.\n\n\"The wealth and breadth of his contribution to Indian cinema is unprecedented,\" said the festival's artistic director Giona A. Nazzaro.\n\n\"Khan is a king who has never lost touch with the audience that crowned him. This brave and daring artist has always been willing to challenge himself.\"\n\nThe 77th festival, which runs until August 17, features 225 films, including 104 world premieres and 15 debut movies.\n\nLocarno's top prize is the Golden Leopard. Previous winning directors include Roberto Rossellini, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick, Milos Forman, Mike Leigh and Jim Jarmusch.\n\nSeventeen films -- all world or international premieres -- are vying for the award, including movies from Lithuania, France, Austria, Italy and South Korea.\n\nThe Golden Leopard comes with a prize fund of 75,000 Swiss francs ($87,400), shared between the director and the producer.\n\nSwitzerland's largest film event will feature a retrospective dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Columbia Pictures.\n\n- 'Tortured, fascinating characters' -\n\nNew Zealand's Campion will be recognised with the Leopard of Honour, given to outstanding personalities of world cinema.\n\nShe was the first woman to be nominated twice for the best director Oscar: first for \"The Piano\" (1993) and then for \"The Power of the Dog\" (2021), which secured her the Academy Award.\n\n\"Her work, peopled with tortured, fascinating characters and marked by an astonishing skill in grappling with the more disturbing side of the human condition, represents one of the undisputed pinnacles of contemporary filmmaking,\" Nazzaro said.\n\nPrevious recipients include Ennio Morricone, Jean-Luc Godard, Bernardo Bertolucci, Paul Verhoeven, Terry Gilliam and Werner Herzog.\n\nMexican filmmaker Cuaron, who won the best director Oscars for \"Gravity\" (2013) and \"Roma\" (2018), will receive the lifetime achievement award.\n\n\"Cuaron has reinvented himself as an artist with each new film,\" said Nazzaro.\n\nFrench-Swiss actress Jacob, who starred in \"The Double Life of Veronique\" (1991) and \"Three Colours: Red\" (1994), will receive the Leopard Club Award, given for film work touching the collective imagination.\n\nStacey Sher -- the US film producer behind \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Get Shorty\", \"Gattaca\", \"Erin Brockovich\", \"Django Unchained\" and \"The Hateful Eight\" -- will receive the Raimondo Rezzonico Award for major achievements in international movie production.\n\nNearly 150,000 people attended last year's festival."
