        "text": "Ayushmann Khurrana's career trajectory began as a television host before transitioning to acting with his debut in 'Vicky Donor' in 2012. Over the past decade, he has established himself as a versatile actor, delivering critically acclaimed performances in films like 'Andhadhun', 'Badhaai Ho', and 'Article 15', among others. However, it's interesting to note that Ayushmann has also turned down several projects that went on to achieve success.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nRecently, he reportedly declined a role in 'Border 2', the sequel to the 1997 film 'Border', citing reservations about joining an ensemble cast led by Sunny Deol, according to Mid-Day report. Let's explore some other projects that Ayushmann declined in the past, showcasing his discerning approach to selecting roles.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\n\nStree (2018)\n\nInterestingly, Ayushmann was initially offered the lead role of Vicky in the 2018 blockbuster hit 'Stree', directed by Amar Kaushik. However, after Ayushmann turned down the opportunity, the role was eventually offered to Rajkummar Rao, who starred alongside Shraddha Kapoor in the film. In a past interview, Ayushmann revealed that he later regretted his decision to decline the role, as 'Stree' went on to become a massive success. Meanwhile, the horror-comedy is set to return with its sequel, scheduled for a theatrical release on August 15.\n\nHungama 2\n\nMeezaan Jaffrey landed the opportunity to star alongside Shilpa Shetty Kundra in the 2021 film 'Hungama 2', directed by the veteran filmmaker Priyadarshan. Reportedly, Priyadarshan had initially offered the role of Aakash Kapoor to several actors, including Ayushman, Kartik Aaryan, and Sidharth Malhotra, before Meezaan finally bagged the part. For unknown reasons, the aforementioned actors declined the offer, according to multiple reports. The film, a sequel to the original 'Hungama', also marked Shilpa Shetty Kundra's return to the silver screen after a 14-year hiatus.\n\nLust Stories\n\nThe inaugural season of Netflix's acclaimed anthology series 'Lust Stories' boasted an impressive lineup of tales, including Karan Johar's segment featuring Vicky Kaushal and Kiara Advani. However, according to reports, Ayushmann was initially considered for the role of Paras, ultimately played by Vicky Kaushal, but declined the offer for unspecified reasons. In another interesting twist, Karan Johar revealed that the role of Megha, portrayed by Kiara Advani, was first offered to Kriti Sanon. Nevertheless, Kriti's mother objected to a particular sexual scene, leading to the part being re-offered to Kiara, who accepted it."
