        "text": "New Delhi: Kangana Ranaut won the best actress award for her powerful performance in “Queen” at the 62nd National Film Awards where Bollywood movies Haider and Mary Kom bagged key honours while Chaitanya Tamhane’s Court was named the best feature film.\n\nRanaut, 28, who celebrated her birthday yesterday, got a belated present by winning her career’s second National award in the movie about a girl who goes on a foreign honeymoon alone after being ditched by her fiance just before marriage. She had won her first National award, as best supporting actress, for Fashion in 2010.\n\nThe Vikas Bahl-directed coming-of-age film was also named the best Hindi feature film. Vijay was declared the best actor for his poignant portrayal of a woman trapped in a man’s body in Kannada film “Nanu Avanalla Avalu” (I am not a he, but she).\n\n“Court”, which focuses on the flaws in the Indian judicial system, has been winning critical acclaim nationally and internationally. The award is expected to give a major boost to the movie ahead of its theatrical release on 17 April.\n\nShahid Kapoor-starrer Haider, a Kashmir-set modern adaptation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, won five honours. Its helmer Vishal Bhardwaj was named the best music director but lost out the best director award to Bengali filmmaker Srijit Mukherji (’Chotushkone’).\n\nBhardwaj was also named for best dialogues in the movie while Sukhwinder Singh clinched the best male playback singer for the song “Bismil”. Its other two wins were in the categories of choreography and costume design.\n\n“Chotushkone”, a film about four directors’ attempt to make four short stories, won two more awards – best cinematography and screenplay (original). Priyanka Chopra-led biopic “Mary Kom” was named the best popular film providing wholesome entertainment.\n\nNirbashito won the Best Bengali Film while Harivu won Best Kannada Film.\n\nHere are a few more tweets through which Ministry of Information and Broadcasting announced the winners today:"
