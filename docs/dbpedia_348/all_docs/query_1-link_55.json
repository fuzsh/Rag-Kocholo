        "text": "Synopsis\n\nShahid Kapoor responded to Hrithik Roshan's remarks about the \"burden of being a star.\" He expressed understanding but revealed his \"opposite problem,\" emphasizing the importance of not losing the actor within himself. Drawing inspiration from iconic figures like Leonardo DiCaprio and Amitabh Bachchan, Shahid aspires to blend stardom with profound acting.\n\nIn a recent interview with Film Companion, Shahid Kapoor shared his perspective on the challenges of navigating the delicate balance between being a star and an actor in the entertainment industry, responding to Hrithik Roshan's candid revelation about the \"burden of being a star.\"\n\nShahid's Actor-First Approach\n\nAcknowledging Hrithik's sentiments, Shahid admitted, \"I can understand why he said that. I have the opposite problem. I think I don't want to lose the actor in me, so sometimes I sacrifice the star.\" Shahid elaborated on his viewpoint, highlighting the unique journey each actor takes in the industry.\n\nHe drew parallels with iconic figures like Leonardo DiCaprio, Amitabh Bachchan, and Dilip Kumar, emphasising the coexistence of stardom and profound acting skills in their careers.\n\n\"See Leonardo DiCaprio, Amitabh Bachchan, and Dilip Kumar, there is definite stardom with heavy acting jobs. I have grown up watching that, and I aspire to that,\" Shahid expressed, shedding light on his aspirations for a career that seamlessly combines the allure of stardom with substantial acting prowess.\n\nAddressing the complexities of the Indian film industry, Shahid underscored the distinct nature of Bollywood, emphasising the diverse audience.\n\nHe pointed out the need to find a balance unique to the industry, stating, \"Bollywood actors have a different industry, where the audience is extremely different.\" Despite these challenges, Shahid affirmed his commitment to maintaining the actor within, declaring, \"I won't let the actor in me go. That's just not something I am ready to do.\"\n\nWhat Did Hrithik Roshan Say?\n\n“When you got to take up the job of a star, it is unhealthy actually in many many ways... The star is the responsibility. I am very grateful for it, don’t get me wrong, I am very thankful this is something I cherish. I know it’s been given to me, it’s a gift but it’s a burden that I carry. And, I have to work very hard to thrive. I don’t want to survive I wanna thrive in it, but it’s a journey,\" Hrithik had told Film Companion recently.\n\nShahid's Upcoming Projects\n\nShahid, known for experimenting with various film genres, is all geared up for the release of his upcoming romantic drama film, 'Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya,' where he portrays a robot scientist. The film, directed by Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah, is set to hit theatres on February 9, offering audiences a unique storyline of love and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn light of Hrithik Roshan's recent comments on the challenges of stardom, Shahid Kapoor's perspective provides valuable insights into the ongoing dialogue within the industry. As both actors navigate their individual journeys, their reflections contribute to a broader conversation on the evolving dynamics of fame and the pursuit of genuine artistic expression in Bollywood.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nMirae Asset's Surana sees overvaluation in select defence stocks, but feels market is fairly valued\n\nMarket risk or deception?
