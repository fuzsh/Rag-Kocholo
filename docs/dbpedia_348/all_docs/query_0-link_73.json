        "text": "Submitted by TellychakkarTeam on Mon, 09/29/2014 - 13:16\n\nShahid Kapoor has given one of the biggest hits of his career with Vishal Bhardwaj's \"Kaminey\" and now the duo has teamed up again for \"Haider\", which the actor says is the best film of his career so far. \"I can proudly say 'Haider' is the best film of my career. This film has everything that I haven't done before. I have pinned my hopes on this film,\" Shahid told reporters in a group interview. Released in 2009, \"Kaminey\" starred Shahid in a double role and he won accolades for his performance from all quarters. \"Haider\" is set against the unrest in the Kashmir Valley and revolves around a guy called Haider who wants to avenge his father's death. An adaptation of William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\", the film also stars Shraddha Kapoor. \"Some people like violence, some like romance but I know people will connect emotionally with 'Haider',\" said the 33-year-old. Shahid says he believes in doing good work without caring much about box office collection or any award. \"Everyone tells me that this film ('Haider') will win the National Award but I am not thinking about it. Earlier, I would think about box-office collections but now I enjoy my work. If we win a National Award, it will be good for us. But if we don't, I will still be happy that I did this film,\" he said. The actor also has good words to share about Bhardwaj. \"Vishal Bhardwaj is a real superstar. He presents each film differently. For instance 'Maqbool', 'Kaminey' or '7 Khoon Maaf'. He also makes strong women-centric movies. Vishal and I share a bonding,\" said Shahid. \"Haider\" is slated for Oct 2 release.\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nHaha\n\n0\n\nYay\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nSubscribe Here"
