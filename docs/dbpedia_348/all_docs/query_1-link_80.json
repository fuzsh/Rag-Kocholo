        "text": "Based on my myopic knowledge of the Pakistan entertainment industry, they are known worldwide for their romantic dramas, which take on topics like classism, feminism, internalized sexism, and more. And Zindagi Gulzar Hai is one of the most popular Pakistani shows out there. I mean, the show was released in 2012, but it continues to find its audience till this day (one such audience member is me). It featured Sanam Saeed and Fawad Khan as the leads, and their chemistry and the writing around their characters still ignite furious discussions on every social media platform. However, despite the meteoric success of the show, Sanam and Fawad didn’t follow it up with a collaboration. So, you could only imagine the kind of buzz that Barzakh has generated as it has brought them together after over a decade. That said, in an interview with Digital Mafia Talkies, Sanam Saeed said that her and Fawad’s dynamic would be totally different from that of Zindagi Gulzar Hai. Now that I have watched all the episodes of Barzakh, I can confirm that she was totally right.\n\nAsim Abbasi’s Barzakh, streaming on Zee5 Global, is largely centered around the journey of Jafar Khanzada. He used to live in the mountains with his mother and brother, Jabbar. He was in love with a girl named Mahtab and they wanted to get married. But since Jafar wanted to stand on his own two feet before settling down with Mahtab, he went away to the city to get a job. Once he was satisfied with his earnings, he returned to his village, but Mahtab was nowhere to be found. Jafar went on to marry Firdaus and had a son with her named Saifullah. Then he married Afroz and had a son with her named Shehryar. Jafar left Afroz too and went back to his village to build Mahtab Mahal to commemorate his first love. As he started to feel that his days were numbered, Jafar invited Saifullah, Shehryar, and Shehryar’s son, Harris, to his wedding with Mahtab. Yes, although Mahtab was dead, Jafar wanted to travel from the land of the living to the realm of the dead and reunite with his lover. And the one guiding the old-timer through this process is a mysterious figure, who masquerades as a caretaker at Mahtab Mahal, called Scheherezade. In addition to all this family drama, the conflicts around the construction of Mahtab Mahal on sacred ground as well as the unsolvable cases of the disappearing daughters form the crux of Barzakh.\n\nIt’s a no-brainer that Asim Abbasi’s writing in Barzakh is multi-layered. He shows us the root of all evil and the various ways in which it scars the people it touches. Jafar is aware of the fact that he has lost the love of his life due to patriarchal norms, but instead of ensuring that the next generation can learn to be better, he inflicts all kinds of trauma upon them. When Saifullah struggles with the burden of his mother’s sickness and his inability to come to terms with his queerness, Jafar is nowhere to be seen. While Shehryar tackles the death of his wife, Leena, and tries to raise Harris in the best way he can, he gets little to no support from Jafar. And, despite their best efforts to not replicate their father’s teachings, Saifullah and Shehryar’s hatred towards Jafar begins to corrupt them from the inside. Abbasi also goes into the topic of land acquisition being used as a vengeful practice and portrays Jafar as a monster (which he undoubtedly is). You can totally excuse Jafar’s actions by saying that the villagers deserve what they’re getting for allegedly killing Mahtab. But as Abbasi starts to highlight how Jafar’s hatred and vitriol are essentially fueling regressive practices, such as honor killing, because the villagers have started to associate freedom with premarital sex, Jafar’s stubborn tirade feels pointless. While it’s interesting to see Abbasi deal with such complex, human emotions, I won’t deny that there are moments in the show where it seems like he has bitten off more than he can chew.\n\nBarzakh is one of the most visually appealing shows that I have seen in some time. By that, I mean that the show’s editing, production design, cinematography, costume design, set design, and art direction can not only rival series from Asia, but the rest of the world as well. The use of pink and reddish hues are so interesting. Saifullah sees a white dove with pink feathers, which seems to symbolize his queerness. Every time someone dies, a pink mist engulfs the frame, which means that it is an indicator of liberation from the mortal realm. The ghosts wear pink dresses, while carrying white rocks on their back, and they have white fingertips and their tears are white as well. The rocks obviously represent the baggage they’ve brought into the afterlife, and the rest is just aesthetically pleasing, I guess. The use of mirrors is exquisite. There’s a shot of Salman Shahid’s face that is reflected on Sanam Saeed’s body and it’s burned into my brain because it’s so simple and it says so much about their relationship. The blocking, in general, is excellent. Nowadays, shows and movies struggle to put more than two actors in the same frame, and resort to copious amounts of shot-reverse-shot. Meanwhile, Abbasi and his team stretched it to 7-8 actors without breaking a sweat. I usually hate mountains, but the way they’re shot in the show made me want to leave everything and settle down in a remote hilly town (preferably with good food, solid internet, and progressive values). The use of sound (or the lack thereof) and music is brilliant. By the way, there’s a scene where the whole cast breaks out into a melancholic song, and Sanam and Fawad are so beautiful in it. With all that said, the show does have some pacing issues and there are scenes which will test your attention span.\n\nComing to the performances in Barzakh, I’m sure that everyone wants to know about Sanam and Fawad (there are two Fawad Khans in the show, BTW), but I guess even they’ll admit that it’s Salman Shahid who takes the cake. I don’t know how he manages to look so frail and vulnerable, and that too while coming off so bloody monstrous. Khushhal Khan, as the younger version of Jafar, is magnetic. Fawad, the one who plays Saifullah, is excellent. The portrayal of his repressed feelings for Lorenzo is heart-breaking, and his complex dynamic with Shehryar and Jafar is depicted by Fawad (the one playing Saifullah) in such an intriguing fashion. Syed Arham is one of the best child actors out there, who goes toe-to-toe with the rest of the cast in such a confident fashion. Eman Suleman, despite her limited screen time, does a great job of showing what postpartum depression looks and feels like. The supporting cast, especially Anika Zulfikar, Sajid Hasan, Faiza Gillani, Uzma Beg, Nighat Chaudhry, and Meesum Naqvi, are amazing. Fawad Khan (the one who plays Shehryar) is actually the one who brings some much needed sense of levity. The way he expresses his confusion, disdain, and lack of enthusiasm for this whole ordeal is hilarious. Of course, when he needs to bring out the big guns, he delivers in spades. Meanwhile, Sanam Saeed maintains an air of calmness, maturity, and spirituality to counteract all the chaos that’s emanating from the family drama. I was in awe of Sanam’s vocal inflections in Zindagi Gulzar Hai, and since she is so awesome, she continues to impress.\n\nAsim Abbasi has delivered a stunning masterpiece in the form of Barzakh. But it’s unfortunate that the show has come out during a time when the world, especially South Asia, is normalizing bigotry and hatred. I mean, here’s a show that’s telling people to not be governed by the text (which can be religious or legal in nature) that’s been thrust upon them since the day they could read and, instead, be more mature than that, thereby allowing said text to transform with the times. And then you see people spewing all kinds of garbage in the comments section of the show and the replies of the social media pages of the artists involved because they think that the show is promoting “blasphemous values.” At the time of writing this article, Barzakh has been withdrawn from YouTube Pakistan, because people are against open mindedness in 2024. The world, as we know it, is this close to annihilation because of a variety of political and environmental (which is also political in nature) reasons. Yet, here we are bickering about stuff that’s inherently anti-humanity. Even if we do manage to avoid extinction, what kind of a world will we leave behind for the next generation if we continue to teach them how to celebrate patriarchy, oppress women, shun queerness, and ignore childhood trauma? Well, as long as we are here, watch Barzakh, appreciate its beauty, and at least try to keep an open mind while dealing with its themes and messages."
