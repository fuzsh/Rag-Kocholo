        "text": "The veteran actor believes that only theatre has “great roles for an actor”\n\nBy Usman Ghafoor\n\nThe News On Sunday\n\nMay 13, 2012\n\nThe inimitable actor in Salman Shahid didn’t quite develop in stages, but it definitely evolved on stage — his favourite medium. “Neither TV nor film can match theatre’s literary level,” he says. Even though his initial claim to popularity was a nerdy comic in early 1970s’ phenomenally successful TV show Such Gup, Shahid also acquitted himself famously in serious characters like Seerhiyan’s quirky villain, in the year 1988, Khuda Aur Mohabbat’s staid maulvi in 2010 and, more recently, in Sabiha Sumar’s off-beat film Khamosh Pani and the two Bollywood hits Ishqiya and Kabul Express.\n\nBut, he believes only theatre has “great roles for an actor.” In the past 40 or so years since he began to act on college stage, Shahid has always been tempted back to theatre. Currently, he is part of the much-hyped local rendition of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, which is headed for a performance at Globe Theatre in the UK, in the upcoming Cultural Olympiad. Although he has reservations about the way the great 17th century English bard is adapted on stage, particularly in Pakistan, he says he took up the project because of the prestigious event itself.\n\nClose on the heels of The Taming…’s first full dress rehearsal in Lahore, The News on Sunday had a conversation with the multi-faceted actor.\n\nThe News on Sunday: After how long are you working on stage?\n\nSalman Shahid: I never quit stage. Every second year, I’m doing something or the other in theatre. My last play was Dario Fo’s adaptation for NAPA two and a half years ago in Karachi. It was directed by Rahat Kazmi. Then, almost two years before that, I directed Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search of an Author, which was partly in Punjabi. So, I continue to be associated with theatre. When The Taming of the Shrew came my way, I obviously said why not.\n\nYou’ve been acting for a long time; what are your concerns now when you take up a project?\n\nWell, the concern is that it should be an intelligent project, to begin with. You try to do something which you know can at least become a reasonably good quality product, not necessarily a very good quality product; I am too realistic to expect that. If it turns out very well, that’s your good luck.\n\nA production is always a cooperative effort, whether you are a director or an actor or a writer. I mean, Shakespeare’s scripts are ruined every day, especially in countries like ours, where people don’t have any idea about it.\n\nSo, what made you accept The Taming of the Shrew?\n\nI accepted the offer basically because the very event in which it will be performed is very prestigious. In the play, I am the father to the two girls; it’s not a very meaty part, but it’s a nice one.\n\nWhat happens when, for instance, you don’t have much of a choice?\n\nYou whittle down things. You know the director is good and the script is good, so that’s a great beginning. And, if you are the director yourself and you think you are reasonably good, then at least you try to get a good script; that’s a good beginning.\n\nBesides, there’s the question of the cast. When you’re doing theatre, less people are attracted to it, because it is much less paying and much harder work. On the other hand, TV is much less work and both money and fame come more easily.\n\nIs it particularly different in Pakistan?\n\nWell, here, we don’t have a theatre tradition. People like myself who’re involved with theatre right from college level, have been working on the fringes and in the dark, because it has never gone beyond a point. I was the founding member with both Ajoka and Rafi Peer Theatre Workshop, and we’ve also had Lahore Drama School whose graduates are now well known TV directors and actors. But every time we are doing something in theatre it is like starting all over again. It never reaches that level where one would say that, yes, we started what is now a very big movement.\n\nIn Pakistan, there’s no tradition of archiving. People have already forgotten our great TV actors, despite the fact that TV is the most popular medium in the country. Those in their 20s today don’t know who Roohi Bano is or who, for instance, Muhammad Nisar Hussain was and what was his contribution to television. They know Shoaib Mansoor because he’s made two films now, so he is back in the scene.\n\nAre there any great roles being written for actors your age?\n\nTV doesn’t write ‘great’ roles any more. Earlier, when it was only PTV, there was such a tradition. The long plays done by Muhammad Nisar Hussain had some very interesting roles for actors — for instance, Ashfaq Ahmed’s Fehmida Ki Kahani Ustani Rahat Ki Zabani, which my mother did, or Munnu Bhai’s Darwaza, with Roohi Bano in the lead.\n\nToday, we are following the international format of sitcoms and soaps. And, sitcoms and soaps, traditionally, anywhere in the world, don’t have great roles for actors. People do them well, but they are never commendable.\n\nSecondly, in Pakistani drama, boy-girl scene hi nahin khatam hota. So, for an actor above 40 or 50, there is a dearth of substantial roles.\n\nHaving said that, television is not such a big medium. Theatre and Film are bigger mediums. You do not produce great literature or even great visuals on TV. The literary level of theatre is unmatched, while great visuals are really the domain of cinema. That’s why, internationally also, there are very few TV superstars, because TV doesn’t have the largeness to make bigger-than-life people.\n\nSo, would you say that the notions of greatness and the kind of romanticism we associate with the PTV drama of yore are justified?\n\nTo some extent, yes. Back then, at least there was an attempt to produce scripts which were dramatic and literary at the same time. Today, there is no stress on the literary at all; the result is only melodrama.\n\nTell us something about your experience in Bollywood?\n\nIt was quite good. I did two films there and both of them were off-beat, in the sense that they weren’t typical commercial Hindi films — they didn’t have item numbers, so to say. Ishqiya was more of a mainstream film than Kabul Express, for the very reason that it at least had a semblance of a commercial film.\n\nFor somebody like me who has been doing similar kind of work in Pakistan, in our own limited way, though, it was the right thing to be in this kind of film. It would be strange for me to be in the other kind of Bollywood film, against maybe a Kareena Kapoor. That would probably not have fitted my bill.\n\nAre you a part of its sequel, Dedh Ishqiya?\n\nWell, the makers of Ishqiya called me a couple of months back; they were in a mess regarding their main leads at that time, but now they have recast Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi, and Madhuri [Dixit] has also stepped in. But I haven’t heard from them since. So I don’t know if I am a part of it.\n\nDid you develop mannerisms for your character in Ishqiya entirely on your own or were they the director’s idea?\n\nMostly, on film, the mannerisms that an actor develops are his own creation. The director does not have a lot of time to spend with you even if you are given the script six months in advance, unlike in a theatre rehearsal where you are meeting for anything between 3 to 8 hours every day. There is a person-to-person interaction with the director for a month or so. You don’t get that on film or TV.\n\nWhen I am directing a theatre play, I only give broad outlines to my actors and don’t go beyond a point; that happens in school productions.\n\nHow did you land Kabul Express, in the first place?\n\nI had done a TV serial, Bano Ko Pehchano, with a Canadian-Pakistani actor who later moved to Mumbai because she wanted to break into the Indian film industry. There she happened to meet Kabir Khan [the director of Kabul Express] who was looking for a Pakistani actor for a part. She suggested my name and I was called over to India for an audition. That set the ball rolling.\n\nYou did (late) Nazrul Islam’s Khwahish, in early 1990s, but no other Pakistani film. Why?\n\nI’ve always got offers of films, but I never liked Pakistani films. Khwahish I accepted because it had a lot of TV actors in it and also because of its script: the movie was based on the real incident of Veena Hayat’s rape. It turned out to be a pretty good product, at the end of the day. We even got a review in Guardian.\n\nYou’ve played comic as well as serious characters. Is there a particular role you would like to work on?\n\nI keep getting a variety of work. Maybe in the public’s mind, talking about Pakistan specifically, I am still known as a comedy actor. But if you go to India, they think of me as a totally different kind of an actor, because they’ve seen me in Khamosh Pani, Kabul Express and Ishqiya.\n\nMy last few TV serials have all had serious roles for me, such as Khuda Aur Mohabbat. Recently, I shot for Sabiha Sumar’s first TV serial; again, it’s a serious character.\n\nSo, is there a conscious effort on your part to reinvent yourself?\n\nYes, there is. At the same time, by intention, I have worked very less. In the last 40 years since Such Gup, I’ve done only about 20 TV serials. People are doing eight serials at the same time these days.\n\nHave you ever felt limited as an actor?\n\nGiven the circumstances in Pakistan, I believe I’ve been quite diligent in my selection of roles. So, I haven’t felt limited. Also, because I’ve been doing theatre and some of my best performances have happened on stage, not on TV or film.\n\nWhere did the urge to direct stem from?\n\nIn 1976, I went to Russia to study film making. I was there for three and a half years. When I came back, I didn’t act for a while. In fact, for the next 15 or so years, I acted very reluctantly, because I wanted to direct. I took up a few roles on stage, some of them directed by Shoaib Hashmi and Kamal Ahmed Rizvi, others by myself.\n\nAt the same time, I didn’t want to become a producer with PTV, because I was averse to the idea of a nine-to-five job. No bank ki naukari, no denting-painting ka kaam, and no import-export ka business for me, please! I’ve been a freelancer all my life.\n\nDo you watch a lot of movies?\n\nYes, if I watch something it is movies; I don’t watch TV shows, whether they are ‘walayati’ or Pakistani or Hindustani.\n\nWhich of the recent performances have you truly admired?\n\nWell, I have really liked a lot of performances in French cinema. I feel that compared to Hollywood, somehow in French movies there is less posturing. In Hollywood, an actor, no matter how good he is, becomes a star and a lot of times he is imitating what he has done before. This is posturing. So, if it’s George Clooney, you can tell from his saunter or walk that it’s Clooney. My question is where is the character?\n\nWhat do you have to say about the Indian actors, especially Naseeruddin Shah and Vidya Balan whom you have shared screen space with?\n\nNaseer is a very good actor. Though, I think the role he plays in The Dirty Picture is bordering on caricature. As for Vidya, again, I think she was very good in Ishqiya but I didn’t like either the film or her role in The Dirty Picture. I didn’t find her lascivious. It seemed as if a good girl was trying to be naughty. Naughty toh hamari Veena Malik ya Nargis lagti hain! But since it was a very bold character, it had an impact.\n\nIf there’s one recent performance that impressed me it is by Saif Ali Khan in Omkara. It was simply brilliant.\n\nWhat were your early influences as an actor?\n\nAs a young kid, I used to accompany my mother to Alhamra to see stage plays. Later, I became a complete Hollywood movie buff. Since we lived close to Regal cinema in Lahore, movie-going was the order of the day. And, these were my early influences.\n\nAre you a big reader?\n\nNot big, but a constant reader.\n\nAre you a loner?\n\nYeah. In fact, the other day I was among friends and we were laughing at the fact that we are all loners."
