        "text": "Actor Ranveer Singh has lauded badminton player Lakshya Sen for his remarkable performance at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAlthough Sen faced a narrow defeat in the bronze medal match, he made history by becoming the first Indian shuttler to reach the semi-finals in the men's singles event at the Olympics.\n\nRanveer took to his Instagram Stories to share his admiration for Sen, posting a picture of the athlete.\n\nAlong with the picture, the 'Ram Leela' actor wrote, \"What a player! What endurance, what agility, what a range of shots, what focus, what grit, what smarts. Scintillating badminton on display! It's difficult to encapsulate just how brilliant he's been at the Olympics. Missed out narrowly in a game of extremely small margins. But he's only 22, and he is just getting started. Fight another day. Proud of you, starboy. @senlakshya.\"\n\nIndia could not open their medal account in badminton at the Paris Olympics. Shuttler Lakshya Sen missed out on a bronze medal in the men's singles event after suffering a defeat against Malaysia's Zii Jia Lee on Monday.\n\nLakshya's defeat was another instance when an Indian athlete failed to deliver the final punch. Lakshya was in the pole position of claiming a medal for India in badminton as he won the first set against Zii Jia Lee. However, Jia accelerated and increased the attacking intensity in the next two sets to take away the bronze.\n\nMeanwhile, on the work front, Ranveer Singh recently announced his new project, featuring a stellar cast that includes Sanjay Dutt, R Madhavan, Akshaye Khanna and Arjun Rampal.\n\nTaking to his Instagram account, the actor shared the announcement as he posted a black-and-white collage of the cast.\n\nAlong with the post, Ranveer added a caption that read, \"This one is for my fans, who have been so patient with me, and been clamouring for a turn like this. I love you all, and I promise you, this time, a cinematic experience like never before. With your blessings, we embark on this great, big motion picture adventure with spirited energy and pure intent. This time, it's personal.\"\n\nThe black-and-white photo collage included Sanjay Dutt, R. Madhavan, Akshaye Khanna, Aditya Dhar, and Arjun Rampal, all dressed in black and sporting serious expressions.\n\nAditya Dhar, who is best known for his national-award-winning film 'URI: The Surgical Strike', is directing this major feature.\n\nThe film's production involves Jyoti Deshpande from Jio Studios and Lokesh Dhar, alongside Aditya Dhar, under their B62 Studios banner.\n\nRanveer will also star in Farhan Akhtar's upcoming 'Don 3'. The actor will also appear in Rohit Shetty's Singham Again, where he will be seen sharing the screen with Arjun Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Deepika Padukone, Akshay Kumar, and Tiger Shroff. His most recent film was Karan Johar's Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, where he starred alongside Alia Bhatt."
