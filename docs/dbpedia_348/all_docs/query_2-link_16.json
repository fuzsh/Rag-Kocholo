Organized by the Directorate of Film Festivals under the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, these awards highlight films that demonstrate not only aesthetic and technical brilliance but also carry social significance. This celebration underscores the major influence of cinema as a powerful medium capable of both artistic expression and societal impact.\n\nHistory of the National Film Awards\n\nEstablished in 1954, the National Film Awards have become a highly prestigious and eagerly awaited event in India, showcasing and honoring excellence in the film industry. The awards are presented by the President of India and include a public screening of the winning films.\n\nEvolution of the Awards\n\nSince their inception, the National Film Awards, initially known as ‘State Awards,’ have undergone significant evolution. The awards began with two President’s Gold Medals, two certificates of merit, and silver medals for around twelve regional films. Originally, the Regional Best Award was synonymous with the National Best Film. However, the number of awards has increased now.\n\nIn 1968, a major change was brought about by the introduction of separate awards for artists and technicians, beginning with the films of 1967. The inaugural Best Actress (then called Urvashi) and Best Actor (then called Bharat) Awards were bestowed upon Nargis Dutt and Uttam Kumar, respectively.\n\nAward Categories\n\nThe National Film Awards are presented in three primary categories: features, non-features, and best writing in cinema. The Features and Non-Features categories acknowledge exceptional contributions in various aspects of filmmaking, while the ‘Best Writing on Cinema’ category encourages the study and appreciation of cinema as an art form. This is achieved by endorsing the publication of books, articles, reviews, newspaper coverage, and studies related to the film industry.\n\nSelection Process\n\nAn expert jury, comprising individuals distinguished in the fields of cinema, the arts, and the humanities, is entrusted with the responsibility of selecting the deserving winners of the National Film Awards. This ensures a fair and informed evaluation of cinematic achievements across various categories.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo showcase the achievements of Indian cinema, the 69th National Film Fare Awards were held in 2023 at the National Media Centre in New Delhi, revealing some of the best talents of the entertainment industry.
