        "text": "SP: I get the feeling that you are both quite honest, and also in your work as directors and writers. How do you, as filmmakers, see the relationship between cinema and reality, or life?\n\nGC: I place a lot of importance on sincerity, reality, and honesty – I’m someone who’s honest and straightforward in life and strives – as much as I can – to be as sincere and honest as possible while making a film, both as an actor and as a director. Like all viewers, I want to believe in the things I see on screen. Drawing from reality is very important, as well as being true to what you find.\n\nML: When I direct, I talk a great deal with my actors and technicians. I think that kind of dialogue is one of the keys to happiness! You have to make everything clear for all the amazing people you’re working with; they know their jobs, but you don’t want them to feel adrift or like they need to be guessing what to do next. When your ideas are really clear for everybody, then those people are free to do their best work. I also keeping the door wide open to improvisation, either with the actors or with the mise-en-scèene, because I love to follow my instinct on set, and to film it as I feel it should be filmed in the moment. Usually everything I’m feeling ends up in the movie at the end [laughs]. This is not a selfish job. Of course, there are selfish directors, but every time I was on the set of someone who didn’t communicate well, we would all, as actors, feel completely useless. That’s the worst feeling ever. You don’t know what to do with yourself, nor how to make yourself useful. In my mind, that’s about as far away from passion as one can get.\n\nSP: Do you feel like you still have to negotiate the roles of actor and director within yourselves or in the perception of the public?\n\nML: No, it was never a battle or even a contradiction for me, probably because I started acting at 14 and directed for the first time at 24. I had already worked [in the industry] for 10 years, so I guess my passion for directing had time to grow. In the meantime, I was observing everybody each time I was on set and absorbing it all. Having had the amazing chance of working with really great directors all around the world at a relatively young age gave me that strength and that crazy courage to just say: “I’ll do it!” But yes, I think I needed those 10 years. When I started directing, it felt like a very logical progression to just extend that passion I already had for cinema, to stand behind the camera and make use of it from that position.\n\nGC: Frankly, I don’t really know how people label me and whether there is still an actor-director divide. I’m fortunate to have had local recognition within France as a director, as I mentioned already, but I sometimes wonder whether people really see me as an actor, and a good actor, too. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I’m more self-aware as an actor than as a director. I wouldn’t say I have doubts about my acting or anything like that – I trust myself and I like my work – but I can’t help but feel like people are only paying attention to me as a director and less so as an actor.\n\nSP: Both of your careers in film began with acting, so it’s only natural for us to speak now about the transformations it entails. Guillaume, what’s the role of physicality in performance for you, between, for example, slimming down to embody the fragility of Maurice in L'homme qu'on aimait trop (In the Name of My Daughter, 2014) by André Téchiné, and the make-up and prosthetics in Le Déluge, the Locarno77 opening film in which you play King Louis XVI?\n\nGC: Generally, I find the physicality of the characters very important. Most of the time, I like to compare them with animals and to imagine what kind of animal they would be; that helps you to think about the way that your character thinks, the way they move. I also like to observe the people around me and compare my character to people from real life, trying to guess what kind of person they would be. If there are some people I know personally who come close to what I imagine for the role I’m playing, I might take something from them as inspiration: the way they look, talk, or walk.\n\nSP: I want to ask Mélanie the same question, since your role as Marie Antoinette in Le Déluge is, on the contrary, less exteriorized and more focused on her inner emotional life. With that in mind, how do you make the switch between registers and how, in your mind, do you approach comedy and drama differently?\n\nML: What can I say, France is a special country [when it comes to genre… [laughs] We don’t often make anything out of the [genre] box. But then I directed [and starred in] a movie called Voleuses (Wingwomen, 2023) for Netflix, which was a first in many ways. For the first time, we had money and we could do something special, instead of a pure action film, comedy, or a drama. I think the craziness of that film helped me to pursue new things and to realize it’s fine to do something out of the box. The only thing that matters to me is the relationship between the characters and what they are going through collectively and individually. When you follow them and it’s dramatic, it’s a drama; when it’s funny, it’s a comedy, when there’s action, it’s an action movie. But there is no comedy without drama, if you want to make a film about human beings. People are so complex, and a good film should reflect that.\n\nGC: Well, probably it’s not that strange for me or difficult to switch between registers. Yes, the energy is different: when you play a character in a comedy, they don’t often have the same reasoning and the same inner workings. A character’s reasons are a very important factor that distinguishes comedy from drama. Also, the way you express things in a drama is different, as there is a tendency to do more on the inside. I quite like that as an actor; I am able to switch from one job to another, you know?\n\nSP: Before Le Déluge, you worked together in the short film Voyage d'affaires (The Business Trip) in 2008 and Christian Carion’s Mon Garçon (My Son) in 2017. What’s your collaboration like, as I imagine, based on this conversation and from watching your films, that you may have a similar sensibility and shared approach?\n\nGC: Mélanie is a really talented actor and director. I think we have a lot in common and in a way, I feel like she’s like me – a chronic workaholic [laughs]. I see myself in her, in how much she works and keeps busy. At the same time, she’s capable of working very fast. It was great to be able to see each other before the shooting of Le Déluge, and we realized very quickly what it was that we wanted from this or that scene, and what we didn’t want. In every sense, she has always been very respectful and very kind to me. It was funny when she saw me in full make-up and costume for the first time [as Louis XVI] – she was visibly surprised [laughs]. It was nice to see her reaction because it felt like a certain kind of approval, as if we were doing the transformation into these parts right. When you change your face and look so much for a part, it can become scary once you start to believe that it might not work out. When you see an actor like Mélanie, somebody who you respect so much, instinctively believing in your character already, it helps a lot with that confidence I mentioned before!\n\nML: Yes, I was definitely shocked to see him transformed; it was so amazing and believable right from the get-go! If I remember correctly, there was another scene – perhaps the first one we shot together – of the day the King and the Queen arrive at the Tour du Temple. Guillaume improvised by taking a small rock off the ground, toyed with it, and putting it in his pocket. I was supposed to stand there and be emotionally cold, keeping my distance, but I remember, upon seeing him do that, just wanting to take him and hold in my arms! [laughs] He brought so many little details to life, like all great actors do, and seeing that in action, as always, was impressive.\n\nSP: You’re sharing the Locarno Film Festival’s Davide Campari Excellence Award and your careers also share some common trajectories. Is there anything you have particularly bonded over, professionally?\n\nML: It’s always very interesting to act alongside someone who is also a director, because we share what is an often complicated position. It’s a mix of letting the director do their work – we’re there to act, not to direct – and also of being there for them, if they need our input in any way. In Le Déluge, we had those two amazing characters that put us in a very serious state of mind and even when we had intense days and big scenes to shoot, it was always wonderful to draw from that. Most of all, I was amazed by the power of Guillaume manifesting a deep inner life in emotional scenes, by his open and effortless access to emotions, which he made look so simple! We did a lot of takes, over and over again, but he could keep up the same intensity, which in turn gave me so much strength to do the same. It felt like we were walking together, hand in hand, through the most challenging scenes.\n\nGC: Also, it’s always fun to talk about the way we are always busy and working on different things. You know, I was joking around with her on set – she had just finished a movie – and while we were shooting, she was writing and preparing another film at the same time. Whenever I made a joke about that, she would turn it back on me, because of course I was also working on another film at the same time! We relate to one another because of that, and for sure I feel very close to Mélanie in that regard. We’re always working on various new projects even when we’re working together on something.\n\nSP: And last, but not least: what does Locarno Film Festival symbolize for each of you and how do you feel about the event tonight at the Piazza Grande?\n\nML: It’s nicer to receive an award like this in tandem, no? And when I hear “Locarno”, I think of that huge screen and the big crowd at Piazza Grande, so I’m very excited to be in the middle of that! It’s the best celebration of cinema.' Also, that vintage way of watching movies outside and feeling like you’re absorbed in a grand fantasy: it’s summer and you’re watching a big movie on a big screen with so many people at the same time. Especially in a period when going to theaters it’s still sort of a problem for a lot of people, and when we’re all fighting to keep making movies that will screen to large audiences in cinemas… It’s an important fight we need to keep on fighting. So, tonight is going to be very moving, I’m sure of it.\n\nGC: I second that. I mean, I’ve been hearing about this festival for as long as I can remember and I’ll be very happy to finally see it for myself. I can’t wait to be there [on the Piazza Grande] and I just hope the weather will hold up, because I’ve heard stories about the Locarno storms [laughs]. Fingers crossed that our screening will be spared!"
