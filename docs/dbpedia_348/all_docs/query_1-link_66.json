        "text": "The singer praised Keoghan's performance in her \"Please Please Please\" music video in her new 'Variety' cover story\n\nSabrina Carpenter may be boyfriend Barry Keoghan’s biggest fan!\n\nWhile gracing the cover of Variety’s latest issue, the “Espresso” singer, 25, gave some rare insight into her relationship with the Saltburn star — and gave his acting abilities some seriously high praise.\n\nReflecting on the music video for her song “Please Please Please,” which stars the Oscar-nominated actor, 31, and Carpenter as Bonnie and Clyde-inspired lovers, the singer said Keoghan loved the track — and she loved how he brought it to life on screen.\n\nCarpenter told Variety that Keoghan “loved the song,” which contains cheeky references to his profession as an actor. Plus, she added, “He’s obsessed with the lyrics, and I’m so grateful for that.”\n\n“I don’t want to sound biased, but I think he’s one of the best actors of this generation,” she continued. “So getting to see him on the screen with my song as the soundtrack made the video better and all the more special.”\n\nRelated: Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan’s Relationship Timeline\n\nThe singer didn’t say much more about Keoghan in the interview, except for a quick nod to his astrological sign. “Barry’s a Libra, and so is my sister,” she told Variety. “They’re very different, but they have similarities. I tend to gravitate towards Leos as well.”\n\nKeoghan and Carpenter have kept their relationship largely out of the limelight, with the latter playing coy about their relationship as recently as June.\n\nRelated: Sabrina Carpenter's Boyfriend Barry Keoghan Threw Her a 25th Birthday Party Featuring a Leonardo DiCaprio-Inspired Cake\n\nWhile chatting with Rolling Stone, the popstar was asked if she refers to him as her boyfriend, to which she replied, “How do I skirt around this question?”\n\nBut she did open up about her romantic life more broadly, telling the magazine, “The [dating] pool is the pool, and when you meet people that feel authentic and are so brilliant and amazing in every way, that’s what you do.”\n\n\"Obviously, I write songs about exactly how I feel, so I guess I can’t be so surprised that people are interested in who and what those songs are about,” she added at the time. “That’s something that comes with the territory.”\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe “Feather” singer and Banshees of Inisherin actor first sparked romance rumors in late 2023, which ramped up in January when the couple “shared a little kiss” during a night out in Los Angeles.\n\nCuriosity about their romance grew further still in April when Keoghan was spotted standing front and center at Carpenter’s Coachella set, where he was also seen filming her performance.\n\nAfter the music festival, the pair made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty in March, posing side-by-side with their hands covering their faces. Shortly after, they also attended the 2024 Met Gala together.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
