        "text": "Indian actor Divyendu Sharma is known for his roles in web series and Bollywood movies. Sharma received his higher education from Delhi University's Kirori Mal College, where he graduated with a degree in Political Science. He then went on to study acting at the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune.\n\nAfter graduating from FTII, he arrived in Mumbai and struggled for more than three years before getting film offers. During that period, he arranged private events to fund his meals. He also joined the theatre club 'Players' to groom himself for movies.\n\nSharma's first official acting performances involved ads for brands like Fidelity Mutual Funds and Birla Sun Life. Then, in 2007, he appeared in the movie Aaja Nachle (2007) in a supporting role. The film was directed by Anil Mehta, and the star cast included Madhuri Dixit, Darshan Jariwala, Divya Dutta, and Dalai.\n\nSharma was also featured in the film Pyaar Ka Punchnama (2011), in which he portrayed a character called Liquid. The film was directed by Luv Ranjan, and the cast included Kartik Aaryan, Ashish Chhipa, Raayo S. Bakhirta, and Nushrratt Bharuccha.\n\nSharma's performance garnered favourable reviews, and the film was a success. In fact, he received the Screen Award for Male Newcomer (Most Promising) in 2011 for his portrayal.\n\nSharma has acted in numerous other movies, including Chashme Baddoor (2013), Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami (2014), Toilet: A Love Story (2017), 2016 the End (2017), The Icebreaker (2018), Kanpuriye (2019), Odd Couple (2019), Shukranu (2020), Thai Massage (2022) and Mere Desh Ki Dharti (2022).\n\nBesides movies, Sharma has been featured in web series and shorts, including Bicchoo Ka Khel (2020), Salt City (India) (2022), and Fatafat (2019), for which he received the Best Actor award by IWM Digital in 2019.\n\nHis performance as Munna Tripathi in Mirzapur (2018) was laudable. He also won the Best Supporting Actor award at the iReel Awards 2019 for this role."
