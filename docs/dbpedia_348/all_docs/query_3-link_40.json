        "text": "The Best Supporting Actor Academy Awards\n\nFacts and Trivia\n\nThe Best Supporting Actor award should actually be titled \"the best performance by an actor in a supporting role.\"\n\nIn 1936, the acting awards were expanded to start recognizing supporting roles. Best Supporting Actor Oscars are traditionally given to actors who stand out in small roles.\n\nIt is quite common that the Best Supporting Actor winner is either an older, established performer, or a young, inexperienced actor. Throughout Academy history, most of the winners in this category usually have no previous Oscar wins.\n\nThe Top Best Supporting Actor Winner:\n\nWithin five years, Walter Brennan won three Best Supporting Actor awards. He was the first and - to date - is the only performer to win three supporting awards (and within the shortest period of time - five years! And his three wins were in the category's first five years). Therefore, he was also the first to win three acting Oscars and the first Best Supporting Actor Oscar recipient.\n\nThe Top Best Supporting Actor\n\nOscar Winner\n\nBest Supporting Actor Wins\n\nWalter Brennan\n\n4 career nominations\n\n(4 B.S.A. noms),\n\n3 wins\n\nCome and Get It (1936)\n\nKentucky (1938)\n\nThe Westerner (1940)\n\nSeven other actors have received two Best Supporting Actor awards (among them is one performer who has won a consecutive statuette, Jason Robards).\n\nOther Top Best Supporting Actor\n\nOscar Winners and Nominees Best Supporting Actor Wins\n\nAnthony Quinn\n\n4 career nominations\n\n(2 B.S.A. noms),\n\n2 wins\n\nViva Zapata!

The two actors with the most Best Supporting Actor nominations (with no wins) include Arthur Kennedy, Claude Rains and Al Pacino.\n\nActors with the most Best Supporting Actor nominations (in parentheses) include:\n\nWalter Brennan (4) - with three wins (Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938), The Westerner (1940)); also nominated in 1941\n\nJack Nicholson (4) - with one win (Terms of Endearment (1983)); also nominated for Easy Rider (1969), Reds (1981), A Few Good Men (1992)\n\nArthur Kennedy (4) - no wins; nominated for Champion (1949), Trial (1955), Peyton Place (1957), Some Came Running (1958)\n\nClaude Rains (4) - no wins; nominated for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Casablanca (1943), Mr. Skeffington (1944), Notorious (1946)\n\nRobert Duvall (4) - no wins; nominated for The Godfather (1972), Apocalypse Now (1979), A Civil Action (1998), and The Judge (2014)\n\nJeff Bridges (4) - no wins; nominated for The Last Picture Show (1971), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), The Contender (2000), and Hell or High Water (2016)\n\nAl Pacino (4) - no wins; nominated for The Godfather (1972), Dick Tracy (1990), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), and The Irishman (2019)\n\nPeter Ustinov (3) - with two wins for Spartacus (1960) and Topkapi (1964); also nominated for Quo Vadis (1951)\n\nJason Robards (3) - with two wins for All the President's Men (1976) and Julia (1977); also nominated for Melvin and Howard (1980)\n\nCharles Coburn (3) - with one win for The More the Merrier (1943); also nominated for The Devil and Miss Jones (1941) and The Green Years (1946)\n\nGig Young (3) - with one win for They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969); also nominated for Come Fill the Cup (1951) and Teacher's Pet (1958)\n\nJack Palance (3) - with one win for City Slickers (1991); also nominated for Sudden Fear (1952) and Shane (1953)\n\nGene Hackman (3) - with one win for Unforgiven (1992); also nominated for Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and I Never Sang For My Father (1970)\n\nRobert De Niro (3) - with one win for The Godfather Part II (1974); also nominated for Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)\n\nMartin Landau (3) - with one win for Ed Wood (1994); also nominated for Tucker: the Man and His Dream (1988) and Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989)\n\nChristopher Plummer (3) - with one win for Beginners (2010); also nominated for The Last Station (2009) and All the Money in the World (2017)\n\nWillem Dafoe (3) - no wins; nominated for Platoon (1986), Shadow of the Vampire (2000), and The Florida Project (2017)\n\nCharles Bickford (3) - no wins; nominated for The Song of Bernadette (1943), The Farmer's Daughter (1947), and Johnny Belinda (1948)\n\nEd Harris (3) - no wins; nominated for Apollo 13 (1995), The Truman Show (1998), and The Hours (2002)\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman (3) - no wins; nominated for Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Doubt (2008), and The Master (2012)\n\nConsecutive Best Supporting Actor-Winning Performers:\n\nThere is only one actor who has received two consecutive Best Supporting Actor Oscar statuette wins:\n\nJason Robards for All the President's Men (1976) and Julia (1977)\n\nNo Best Supporting Actress has won two Academy Awards in a row.\n\nActors Winning at Least One Statuette in Both the Lead and Supporting Categories:\n\nSix actors have won acting awards in both the lead and supporting categories:\n\nJack Lemmon, Best Supporting Actor (Mister Roberts (1955)), Best Actor (Save the Tiger (1973)) - the first!\n\nRobert De Niro, Best Supporting Actor (The Godfather, Part 2 (1974)), Best Actor (Raging Bull (1980))\n\nJack Nicholson, Best Actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and As Good As It Gets (1997)), Best Supporting Actor (Terms of Endearment (1983))\n\nGene Hackman, Best Actor (The French Connection (1971)), Best Supporting Actor (Unforgiven (1992))\n\nKevin Spacey, Best Supporting Actor (The Usual Suspects (1995)), Best Actor (American Beauty (1999)) - his only two career nominations (so far)\n\nDenzel Washington, Best Supporting Actor (Glory (1989)), Best Actor (Training Day (2001))\n\nVictor McLaglen was the first performer to be nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar (for The Quiet Man (1952)) after having already won the Lead Performance Oscar for The Informer (1935).\n\nPosthumous Winner:\n\nThe only actor to win a posthumous acting Oscar in a supporting role was Australian actor Heath Ledger for his role as The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008). He was the second actor to win a posthumous acting Oscar - the first was Peter Finch, who won Best Actor for his role as Howard Beale in Network (1976).\n\nMultiple Nominations For a Single Performer:\n\nNo single performer has ever won two performing awards in the same year. There have been a total of eleven performers who are double nominees - that means that they have received two acting nominations in the same year. Three were actors and eight were actresses (wins are marked with *). (See the Best Supporting Actress section for eight actresses who have duplicated the feat.) Of the 11 performers (actors and actresses) who've been recognized with nods for two performances in the same year, seven of them ended up winning one of the trophies.\n\nDouble nominees usually win in one category (i.e., double nominees Al Pacino and Jamie Foxx won as Best Actor, and Fitzgerald won as Best Supporting Actor - see below).\n\nIn only one case, an actor (Barry Fitzgerald) was simultaneously nominated in two performance categories for the same film. [The Academy would prevent this in future years by not allowing a double nomination for the same performance.] He was the only actor simultaneously nominated in both the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories for the same film and performance:\n\nBarry Fitzgerald was nominated for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor* for Going My Way (1944)\n\nIn a few instances, actors have been nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for different films in the same year. The two male actors who accomplished this feat were Al Pacino, and Jamie Foxx. Al Pacino was the first actor to be nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor in two different roles. And Jamie Foxx was the only African-American performer to have two Oscar nominations in one year:\n\nAl Pacino (Best Actor for Scent of a Woman (1992)* and Best Supporting Actor for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992))\n\nJamie Foxx (Best Actor for Ray (2004)* and Best Supporting Actor for Collateral (2004))\n\nMultiple Wins for the Same Character:\n\nThe only actor to win two Academy Award Oscars for the same performance or role:\n\nHarold Russell received the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of a double-amputee veteran returning from WWII in The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) - his debut film\n\nRussell received an additional Special Honorary Oscar for the same performance \"for bringing hope and courage to fellow veterans\"\n\nThe only time two actors have won Oscars playing the same character (Don Vito Corleone) in different films:\n\nMarlon Brando won Best Actor for his role as Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972)\n\nRobert De Niro won Best Supporting Actor for his role as younger Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather, Part II (1974)\n\nConsecutive Double-Nominations for Best Supporting Actor:\n\n(4 year consecutive streak): Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan double-nominated for The Banshees of Inisherin (2022), Jesse Plemons and Kodi Smit-McPhee double-nominated for The Power of the Dog (2021), Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield double-nominated for Judas and the Black Messiah (2020), and Al Pacino and Joe Pesci double-nominated for The Irishman (2019).\n\nRefusal to Accept Nomination:\n\nGeorge C. Scott in his third screen appearance in The Hustler (1961) received his second supporting nomination in 1962 - after his first nomination received in 1960 for Anatomy of a Murder (1959). (His first film was The Hanging Tree (1959).) He became the first actor to decline his Oscar nomination - in protest of fellow actors' practice of campaigning for awards, calling the awards demeaning and self-serving. When Scott received another Oscar nomination (and won) as Best Actor for Patton (1970), he declined to accept the nomination and the award, because he did not feel himself to be in any competition with other actors, calling it a \"meat parade.\"\n\nFilm Debut Nominees/Winners of Best Supporting Actor Oscars:\n\nOnly three actors have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for their debut performance (in a feature film), while others received a nomination for a substantial role in a film debut (a sampling):\n\nJohn Garfield in Four Daughters (1938) (nomination)\n\nRobert Morley in Marie Antoinette (1938) (nomination)\n\nSydney Greenstreet in The Maltese Falcon (1941) (nomination)\n\nJohn Dall in The Corn is Green (1945) (nomination)\n\n(1) Harold Russell in The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) (win)\n\nRichard Widmark in Kiss of Death (1947) (nomination)\n\nJose Ferrer in Joan of Arc (1948) (nomination)\n\nDon Murray in Bus Stop (1956) (nomination)\n\nJason Miller in The Exorcist (1973) (nomination)\n\nMikhail Baryshnikov in The Turning Point (1977) (nomination)\n\n(2) Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People (1980) (win)\n\n(3) Haing S.

Only six different black actors have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar (Mahershala Ali was the only one to win two supporting Oscars):\n\nLouis Gossett, Jr. for An Officer and a Gentleman (1982)\n\nDenzel Washington for Glory (1989)\n\nCuba Gooding, Jr. for Jerry Maguire (1996)\n\nMorgan Freeman for Million Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nMahershala Ali for Moonlight (2016)\n\nMahershala Ali for Green Book (2018)\n\nDaniel Kaluuya for Judas and the Black Messiah (2020)\n\nOnly twenty-three awards have been won by African-Americans (or blacks) in both lead and supporting categories (five Best Actor, one Best Actress, seven Best Supporting Actor, and ten Best Supporting Actress).\n\n2020 became a record year when two black actors were competing in the same category (Best Supporting Actor): Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith (Keith) Stanfield for Judas and the Black Messiah (2020), and Kaluuya won the Oscar. The double nomination marked just the 11th time in Oscars history that two people from the same film were nominated in the category. The year 2020 also marked the first time in Oscar's history that three black actors (Daniel Kaluuya, Leslie Odom Jr. and LaKeith Stanfield) were all competing in the same category.\n\nJamie Foxx also set a record for being the first black to debut as a nominee in two categories in the same year, lead and supporting, for Ray (2004) and Collateral (2004). Morgan Freeman's Best Supporting Actor win for Million Dollar Baby (2004), paired with Foxx's Best Actor win for Ray (2004), was the first time that African-American actors won in their respective categories in the same year.\n\nLatino, Asian and Other Ethnic-Minority (Non-English) Performers:\n\nThere have only been a few Best Supporting Actor Oscar wins by ethnic/other minority (non-English) performers, or by actors in foreign-language performances:\n\nVietnamese-American Ke Huy Quan won the Oscar Best Supporting Actor for Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) - he became the first person from an Asian background to win the award\n\nMuslim and African-American Mahershala Ali became the first Muslim to win the Oscar, Best Supporting Actor for Moonlight (2016) and repeated his win for Green Book (2018)\n\nAustrian-born Christoph Waltz won his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Django Unchained (2012)\n\nAustrian-born Christoph Waltz won Best Supporting Actor for Inglourious Basterds (2009) - his performance was in German and French as well as English\n\nSpanish-born actor Javier Bardem won Best Supporting Actor for No Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nPuerto Rican Benicio Del Toro won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Traffic (2000) - a primarily non-English (Spanish) language role\n\nCambodian native Haing S.

Matlin was the first deaf performer to be Oscar-nominated - and she won the Oscar for Children of a Lesser God (1986).]\n\nGig Young (with real-name Byron Barr) was the only Oscar winner, Best Supporting Actor for They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), who adopted his screen name from the role he played in The Gay Sisters (1942) as \"Gig Young\".\n\nJason Robards has the record for the most Oscar-nominated roles as historical personages:\n\nWashington Post editor Ben Bradlee in All The President's Men (1976)\n\nAuthor Dashiell Hammett in Julia (1977)\n\nHoward Hughes in Melvin and Howard (1980)\n\nRelated Oscar Winners and Nominees: Siblings\n\nThe first - and only - brother and sister to win acting Oscars were:\n\nLionel Barrymore, who won the Best Actor award for A Free Soul (1930/31), and Ethel Barrymore who won the Best Supporting Actress award for None But the Lonely Heart (1944)\n\n(Note: Famous brother John Barrymore was never nominated, nor has descendant Drew Barrymore (yet).)\n\nOther brother-sister acting nominees include:\n\nJane Fonda (nominated seven times with two Best Actress wins), and Peter Fonda as Best Actor for Ulee's Gold (1997)\n\nEric Roberts as Best Supporting Actor for Runaway Train (1985), and Julia Roberts (nominated three times with one Best Actress win)\n\nWarren Beatty (nominated four times for Best Actor with no wins), and Shirley MacLaine (nominated five times with one Best Actress win)\n\nJake Gyllenhaal as Best Supporting Actor for Brokeback Mountain (2005), and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Best Supporting Actress for Crazy Heart (2009)\n\nThe only brothers nominated for acting Oscars were:\n\nRiver Phoenix as Best Supporting Actor for Running on Empty (1988), and Joaquin Phoenix as Best Supporting Actor for Gladiator (2000)\n\nTwo pairs of sisters have competed against each other (when nominated simultaneously) for the same Best Actress award:\n\nJoan Fontaine in Suspicion (1941) defeated sister Olivia de Havilland in Hold Back the Dawn (1941); de Havilland later won two Best Actress Oscars for her roles in To Each His Own (1946) and The Heiress (1949)\n\nVanessa Redgrave for Morgan (1966) vs. Lynn Redgrave in Georgy Girl (1966) - both lost to Elizabeth Taylor\n\nThe only other sisters to have received acting Oscar nominations (supporting in this case):\n\nMeg Tilly for Agnes of God (1985) and Jennifer Tilly for Bullets Over Broadway (1994)\n\nThree Generations:\n\n1948's Oscar-winning director John Huston directed both his father (Walter Huston) to a Best Supporting Actor Oscar and his daughter (Anjelica) to a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in respectively, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and Prizzi's Honor (1985) 37 years later. [Huston won two Oscars for writing and directing the 1948 film.] This remarkable feat made the Hustons the first family with three generations of Oscar winners - Huston became the only director to have directed both his father and daughter to Oscar victories. Since Huston also received an acting nomination (supporting) for The Cardinal (1963), the Hustons are the only grandfather-father-daughter acting nominees in Oscar history.\n\nIn addition, this made the Hustons the only grandfather-granddaughter ever to win Academy Awards:\n\nWalter Huston, Best Supporting Actor winner for The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) (directed by his son John Huston)\n\nAnjelica Huston, Best Supporting Actress winner for Prizzi's Honor (1985) (directed by her father John Huston)\n\nA win for Sofia Coppola for Best Original Screenplay for Lost in Translation (2003) made her part of the second family of three-generation Oscar winners (her father is a five-time winner and her grandfather, Carmine Coppola, won for musical score on The Godfather Part II (1974)). Further connections can be made for the Coppolas - the only father-daughter-nephew grouping to win Oscars:\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, Best Director winner for The Godfather Part II (1974)\n\nSofia Coppola, Best Original Screenplay winner for Lost in Translation (2003)\n\nNicolas Cage, Best Actor winner for Leaving Las Vegas (1995)\n\nCast Nominations:\n\nSixteen films have received nominations in all four acting categories. With his two films in 2012 and 2013, director David O. Russell was the first director to helm two movies (back to back too) that both achieved this feat:\n\nMy Man Godfrey (1936)\n\nMrs. Miniver (1942)\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls (1943)\n\nJohnny Belinda (1948)\n\nSunset Boulevard (1950)\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire (1951)\n\nFrom Here To Eternity (1953)\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
