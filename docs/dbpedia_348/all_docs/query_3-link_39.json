        "text": "Check out the best photos from the 2024 Academy Awards\n\n“Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s epic take on the father of the atomic bomb, was the big winner at Sunday night’s Academy Awards.\n\nEmma Stone (“Poor Things”) won best actress for the second time in her career. “Poor Things” also won Oscars for best production design, best costume design and best makeup and hairstyling.\n\nSee more photos from the show.\n\nFrom Da'Vine Joy Randolph making us cry to \"Oppenheimer\" dominating, here's how the Academy Awards unfolded\n\nWhat a night!\n\nRaise your hand if you did not have naked John Cena on your Academy Awards bingo card.\n\nThis year’s Oscars was a delightful — and surprisingly fast-moving — event.\n\nFrom Da’Vine Joy Randolph making costar Paul Giamatti cry when she won the best supporting actress award to Al Pacino’s unorthodox presentation of the best picture award, the show had moments of both heart and surprise. Not to mention, host Jimmy Kimmel’s roasting of former President Donald Trump for his criticism of Kimmel on social media.\n\nIn between, we also got Ryan Gosling turning it up with the bravado performance of his song from the “Barbie” soundtrack and Wes Anderson finally winning his first Oscar.\n\nOne not-very surprising moment was “Oppenheimer” winning best picture. It was completely expected, but still lovely to witness.\n\nThe BAFTA awards also continued its role of accurately predicting the best actress category.\n\nGoing into Sunday night, Lily Gladstone was expected to make history as the first Native American to win best actress. But Emma Stone won the BAFTA in that category, and also took home the Oscar.\n\nThe biggest surprise of the night may have been that it ended on time. Perhaps the producers may have been onto something starting an hour earlier this year.\n\nOther award shows, take note.\n\nJimmy Kimmel calls out Trump at the Oscars: \"Isn't it past your jail time?\"\n\nOscars host Jimmy Kimmel called out Donald Trump during the televised show on Sunday after the former president insulted the comedian on social media.\n\n“I was told we have like, an extra minute, and I’m really proud of something and I was wondering if I could share it with you. I just got a review,” Kimmel said, before, pulling out his phone to read Trump’s Truth Social post out loud.\n\nThe post from Trump reads, “Has there EVER been a WORSE HOST than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars. His opening was that of a less than average person trying too hard to be something which he is not, and never can be. Get rid of Kimmel and perhaps replace him with another washed up, but cheap, ABC ‘talent,’ George Slopanopoulos. He would make everybody on stage look bigger, stronger, and more glamorous.”\n\nHis comment prompted cheers and laughs from the audience.\n\nDid Margot Robbie, America Ferrera and Greta Gerwig’s Oscar gowns have a hidden \"Barbie\" meaning?\n\nThe cast of “Barbie” will go down in red-carpet history for their dedication to method dressing, as stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling diligently showed up to press events, premieres and award shows in outfits that could have been borrowed straight from Barbie and Ken’s dollhouse closets.\n\nBut at the Academy Awards on Sunday, where the summer blockbuster was nominated for nine awards, including “Best Picture,” Robbie appeared to pass the pink torch to co-star America Ferrera, wearing a striking black (but decidedly non-Barbie-like) gown — while Ferrera arrived in shimmering hot pink.\n\nStill, it seemed as if the actors’ dresses were connected, and linked to “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig’s too.\n\nWhile Robbie and Ferrera’s dresses were polar opposites in color and mood, they were both courtesy of Versace and seemed to be made of the same chainmail fabric. (Robbie’s was fresh off the Fall-Winter 2024 runway, while Ferrera’s was custom-made.) Gerwig’s gown, meanwhile, was a sparkling Gucci number of crystal mesh that also had an armor-like feel.\n\nThe collection of feminine chainmail was a subtle play on power dressing — appropriate for the movie’s message of female empowerment. But they weren’t the only “Barbie” cast and team members to sparkle. With a touch of Ken’s flair for opulence, Gosling wore a custom Gucci black tuxedo suit lined with sparkling beading, while Simu Liu opted for a black jacket cinched with a glittering brooch clasp.\n\nRead more.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" wins the Oscar for best picture, sweeping the major awards tonight\n\n“Oppenheimer” wins the Oscar for best picture, sweeping the major awards tonight.\n\nProducer Emma Thomas admitted that winning best picture was a dream come true and praised director — and her husband — Christopher Nolan for his talent.\n\n“Oppenheimer” dominated the Academy Awards this year, picking up seven Oscars including best movie, acting honors for Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., and best director for Christopher Nolan.\n\nIt has been an award season rich with success for “Oppenheimer,” which picked up dozens of awards across the major and guild awards shows before tonight.\n\nA slightly halting presentation: Given that host Jimmy Kimmel joked about the “Moonlight”-“La La Land” best picture snafu from a few years ago, it was hard to tell if this year’s best picture presenter Al Pacino was being his usual “I have lots of things going on in my head at once” self, or if there was a hiccup in production.\n\nThe delivery felt somewhat anti-climactic, and some in the room seemed caught off-guard when the acting legend read the winner’s name. That “Oppenheimer” was widely expected to take home the award likely helped everyone get with the program.\n\nThe post has been updated with more details on “Oppenheimer.”\n\n\"This is overwhelming.\" Emma Stone wins best actress award for her daring role in \"Poor Things\"\n\nEmma Stone has won the Oscar for best actress in a leading role, thanks to her daring portrayal of Bella Baxter in “Poor Things.”\n\nShe pointed out the other nominees within the lead actress category this year: Lily Gladstone for “Killers of the Flower Moon,” Annette Bening for “Nyad,” Sandra Hüller for “Anatomy of a Fall” and Carey Mulligan for “Maestro.”\n\n“I share this with you. I’m in awe of you. And it has been such an honor to do all this together. I hope we get to keep doing more together,” she said.\n\nShe thanked those who worked on the film and her family for the award. This was one of the few major races widely considered a toss-up heading into tonight.\n\nThis is Stone’s second Oscar for best actress in a leading role, after winning the award in 2017 for “La La Land.”\n\nIn “Poor Things,” Stone plays a child-like woman who is reanimated by a mad professor-type using the brain of her unborn child.\n\nThe bizarre and outlandish film was nominated for 11 Oscars total this year.\n\nThis post has been updated with details from Stone’s speech and about the movie.\n\nBillie Eilish offers beautiful, stripped down rendition of \"What Was I Made For\"\n\nBillie Eilish was joined by her brother, Finneas, for her performance of her hit song from “Barbie.”\n\nWith just the two of them — Finneas on piano — she offered an emotional version of the song.\n\nThe song feels so deeply personal that many people have assumed that it’s about the singer, something she denies.\n\n“It was so purely about ‘Barbie’ and how she feels, and I felt I could look through her eyes and see the world and write from her perspective,” she told the Los Angeles Times recently. “And I was truly not thinking about myself. We weren’t talking about my life.”\n\nEilish was simply made for this.\n\nThe wild world of \"Poor Things\" has earned the film an Oscar for best makeup and hairstyling\n\n“Poor Things” has won the Oscar for best makeup and hairstyling.\n\nNadia Stacey, Mark Coulier and Josh Weston accepted the award for their work on the film.\n\nIn “Poor Things,” Emma Stone plays a child-like woman who is reanimated by a mad professor-type using the brain of her unborn child.\n\nThe bizarre and outlandish film is nominated for 11 Oscars total this year, including best picture, best supporting actor for Mark Ruffalo and best director for Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\nThe post has been updated with more details on the movie.\n\n\"American Fiction\" wins Academy Award for best adapted screenplay\n\n“American Fiction” has won the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay.\n\nWriter and director Cord Jefferson took the stage to accept the award.\n\nHe called for more filmmakers to be given opportunities to make movies because “the next Martin Scorsese is out there, the next Greta is out there.”\n\n“They just want a shot and we can give them one,” he said.\n\n“American Fiction” is a satire adapted from Percival Everett’s book “Erasure,” that follows a frustrated author whose joke book riffing on Black stereotypes suddenly finds success – and thrusts him into a world full of insanity and hypocrisy.\n\nThis post has been updated with details from the movie and Jefferson’s speech.\n\nReal-life partners take home best original screenplay Oscar for film about the trial of a marriage\n\n“Anatomy of a Fall” has won the Oscar for best original screenplay.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Justine Triet and Arthur Harari (her real-life partner) and stars Sandra Hüller. The film is a French courtroom drama about a woman accused of killing her husband.\n\nTriet thanked the cast while accepting the Oscar.\n\nMore about the film: Triet’s knotty screenplay is as much the trial of a marriage as the prosecution of a crime. Hüller’s character Sandra Voyter is a successful German novelist whose French husband Samuel, rightly or wrongly, believes he is living in her shadow. One day he’s found dead in the snow beneath the balcony of their Alpine chalet by their son Daniel, who is blind.\n\nAn inconclusive autopsy results in a trial, where a lack of evidence from the alleged crime scene creates a void prosecutors fill by dissecting their marriage in search of motive.\n\nCNN’s Thomas Page contributed to this post.\n\nThe post has been updated with more details on the award and movie.\n\nMargot Robbie says goodbye to \"Barbie\" in black Versace gown\n\nMargot Robbie has worn nonstop “Barbie”-inspired looks for the past year, and she might be over it.\n\nAt least, that seemed to be the case as she hit the Oscars red carpet in a strapless black Versace gown with ruching at the waist. The simple but striking silhouette would probably not be found in Barbie’s Dream Closet, though it still had a connection to her castmates and creative team.\n\nThe material seemed to be a twin to America Ferrera’s hot pink chainmail look (also from Versace), and closely resembled the armor-like metallic gown that director Greta Gerwig wore as well.\n\nJimmy Kimmel lets Da'Vine Joy Randolph name her publicist after she forgot on stage\n\nAlthough Da’Vine Joy Randolph wasn’t wearing a mic, Jimmy Kimmel called on her after the commercial break to name her publicist, who she thanked in her speech for always having her back, but forgot to name.\n\nRandolph was happy to oblige, looking straight into the camera and thanking her.\n\nKimmel, a Howard Stern super-fan and best friend, also gave his first Stern Show shoutout of the night, telling Randolph “Bababooey” over her speech. Bababooey is a popular term used on the show as a nickname for executive producer Gary Dell’Abate.\n\n\"The Boy and the Heron\" wins Academy Award for best animated feature film\n\n“The Boy and the Heron” has won the Academy Award for best animated feature film.\n\nThe movie earned just under $13 million in its opening weekend, the biggest ever opening in the United States and Canada for a film by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, which he co-founded, according to Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.\n\nThe movie, a story of a child who travels to a mysterious realm after his mother dies, was released in theaters across the US in December.\n\nThis post has been updated with more details on the movie.\n\nOscar for best animated short film goes to \"War is Over!\"\n\nThe Oscar for the best animated short film was awarded tonight to “War is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko.”\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph wins Oscar for best actress in a supporting role\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph has won the first award of the night: the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role.\n\nRandolph won the honor for her role in the film “The Holdovers.”\n\nIn “The Holdovers,” Randolph delivers a heartbreaking performance as Mary Lamb, a boarding school cook in 1970 who is grieving her recently deceased son who was fighting in the Vietnam War.\n\nRandolph costars with Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa in the acclaimed Alexander Payne-directed film about people “holding over” at their snowy New England school with nowhere else to go during the holidays.\n\nThis post has been updated with more details from Randolph’s speech and about the movie.\n\nVanessa Hudgens debuts baby bump on Oscars red carpet\n\nActress Vanessa Hudgens debuted a baby bump on the red carpet at the Oscars tonight.\n\nHudgens is married to Major League Baseball outfielder Cole Tucker.\n\n30 years ago, Tom Hanks delivered an Oscar night performance that reverberated through Hollywood\n\nThirty years ago, Tom Hanks delivered a performance that reverberated through Hollywood. And it wasn’t in a movie.\n\nOn March 21, 1994 — at the 66th Academy Awards — Hanks accepted the Best Actor statuette for his role in “Philadelphia,” a drama about a gay lawyer slowly dying of AIDS. His acceptance speech quickly went down in history as one of the most memorable and moving in Oscar history.\n\nAs we gear up for the 96th Academy Awards on Sunday, here’s a look back at Hanks’ groundbreaking acceptance speech, 30 years later.\n\nThe speech\n\nIt starts like any other speech, with Hanks thanking his wife Rita Wilson, as well as the film’s cast and crew — including co-stars Antonio Banderas and Denzel Washington. Then, the speech turns personal. Hanks refers to his high school drama teacher, Rawley Farnsworth, and a classmate, John Gilkerson — both gay men who Hanks said he “had the good fortune to be associated with, to fall under their inspiration at such a young age.”\n\nRead more about the impact of Hanks’ speech\n\nOscars attendees are starting to arrive on the red carpet. And this year, it's actually red\n\nAs stars make their glamorous entrance at the 96th Academy Awards today, they’ll be strolling down a carpet of a familiar hue: red.\n\nIt might seem unnecessary to observe the color of the red carpet, but last year’s award show featured a champagne-colored carpet, marking a break with tradition.\n\nCurious about what it’s like on the other side of the carpet? Check out CNN’s profile of a celebrity photographer.\n\nHere are the 2024 Razzie Award winners\n\nEvery year around Oscars time, when the greatest in cinema is celebrated, an alternative awards ceremony is held that singles out the worst (at least, according to them) in movies — the Razzie Awards.\n\nAround since 1981, this 44th edition of the infamous “honors” counted Jason Statham, Vin Diesel and Ana de Armas among the nominees for worst actor and actress.\n\n“Expend4bles,” “Meg 2: The Trench,” “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” and the bland “Exorcist: Believer” were up for worst film of 2023.\n\nBut in a bad sign for the now-public domain figure Mickey Mouse, the horror film “Winnie the Pooh: Blood & Honey” took home the Razzie for worst picture, the awards association announced on Saturday.\n\nIn the acting categories, Academy Award-winner Jon Voight won worst actor for the film “Mercy,” while Sylvester Stallone snagged worst supporting actor for “Expend4bles.”\n\n“Transformers” star (and poet) Megan Fox had the distinction of winning two Razzies, for worst actress and supporting actress, for “Johnny & Clyde” and “Expend4bles,” respectively.\n\nThe “Winnie the Pooh” horror film won four other awards, including worst screen couple for Pooh and Piglet as “Blood-Thirsty Slasher/Killers (!),” according to the Razzie announcement.\n\nThe Razzies — also called the Golden Raspberry Awards — have not come without their fair share of controversy.\n\nLast year, the organization was called out for nominating then-12-year-old Ryan Kiera Armstrong for her starring role in the “Firestarter” remake, prompting an apology.\n\nSome \"Oppenheimer\" cast members join campaign to spotlight threat posed by nuclear arsenals\n\nThe Nuclear Threat Initiative is leveraging the attention on Christopher Nolan’s Oscar-nominated film “Oppenheimer” to elevate the conversation about nuclear threat.\n\nIn the run-up to the Academy Awards, the organization launched a “Make Nukes History” campaign Wednesday in Los Angeles.\n\nUsing billboards, a major art installation, an open letter from top artists published in the Los Angeles Times, social media videos and more, the campaign aims to raise public awareness about the civilization-ending risks posed by today’s nuclear arsenals.\n\nActors including “Oppenheimer” cast members Matthew Modine and Tony Goldwyn — as well as Michael Douglas, Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Viggo Mortensen, Emma Thompson, and Rosanna Arquette — joined J. Robert Oppenheimer’s grandson and activist Charles Oppenheimer to sign a letter in partnership with the Nuclear Threat Initiative.\n\nThe “For Your Consideration: Make Nukes History” campaign includes billboards and street posters, proclaiming “Oppenheimer Started It, We Can End It” and “13 Oppenheimer Nominations; 13,000 Nuclear Weapons.”\n\nThe live Oscars telecast will start one hour earlier than in past years. Here's what to know\n\nThe Oscars telecast is set to start one hour earlier than in years past, which means we’ll all hopefully get off to bed a little earlier tonight.\n\nIn an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences first, the live telecast of the premier awards event will begin at 7 p.m. ET (4 p.m. PT) instead of its usual start time one hour later, the organization announced late last year.\n\nABC will air a 30-minute pre-show leading into the live telecast starting at 6:30 p.m. ET, and a new episode of the Emmy-winning comedy “Abbott Elementary” will air immediately following the end of the Oscars ceremony, according the announcement.\n\nThe Academy has also stipulated that the runtime of this year’s show will be three and a half hours, which would be in keeping with the average duration of the event (although it often encroaches on four hours).\n\nLate night’s Jimmy Kimmel is set to host for the fourth time when the 96th Academy Awards air live on ABC and broadcast outlets worldwide tonight."
