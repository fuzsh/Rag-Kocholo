        "text": "Ajay Singh Deol (born 19 October 1957), better known as Sunny Deol, is an Indian actor, film director, producer, politician and incumbent Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Indian Parliament. He was elected from the Gurdaspur constituency of Punjab.[1] One of the highest grossing actors of Indian cinema,[2] he has worked in more than 90 Hindi films in a career spanning over four decades and is particularly known for his angry action hero persona.[3][4] Deol has won several awards including two National Film Awards[5][6] and two Filmfare Awards.[7]\n\nDeol had his biggest commercial successes in the period action films Border (1997) and Gadar: Ek Prem Katha (2001). The latter was the highest-grossing Hindi film to that point.[12][13][14] He subsequently starred with his father and younger brother, Bobby Deol, in the drama Apne (2007) and the comedy Yamla Pagla Deewana (2011).[15][16] After more than a decade of decline, he made a career comeback by reprising his role in Gadar 2 (2023), which became the highest-grossing film of his career and the sixth highest-grossing Hindi film of all-time.[17][18]\n\nMadhuri Rape Scene Paap Ka Ant\n\nDownload ðŸ”¥ https://urloso.com/2yvQOs ðŸ”¥\n\nDeol was born as Ajay Singh Deol[19] on 19 October 1957,[20] in the village of Sahnewal in East Punjab, India[21] in a Punjabi Jat family,[22][23][24] to Bollywood actor Dharmendra[25] and Prakash Kaur.[26]\n\nHe has a younger brother Bobby Deol and two sisters Vijayta and Ajeeta who are settled in California, USA. Hema Malini is his step-mother.[27] Actress Esha Deol and Ahana Deol are his paternal younger half-sisters.[28] His cousin Abhay Deol is also an actor.[29]\n\nThe following year, Deol starred in Sunny, Manzil Manzil, and Sohni Mahiwal, with only the latter becoming successful at the box office. Sohni Mahiwal (1984), an Indian-Russian film portrays the classic Punjabi folklore tragic love story of Sohni, portrayed by Poonam Dhillon, a potter's daughter, and Mahiwal (Deol), a wealthy merchant, amidst societal constraints. The film remains celebrated for its soundtrack and has attained cult classic status in Russia.[34]\n\nDeol then appeared in Rahul Rawail's Arjun (1985), in which he played the titular role of an unemployed radical youngster, who alongside his group of friends, fights against the system that thrives on corruption and exploitation of the weak. The film opened to much critical praise and went on to become a major hit and established Sunny Deol's status as an action hero.[35] Arjun is considered one of Deol's best works to date.[36]\n\n1993 was a noteworthy year for Deol as he starred in four major films of the year: Lootere, Kshatriya, Damini and Darr. Lootere was an action film where Deol played a cop investing the murder of his colleague with the help of a bar dancer. It ranked among the biggest hits of that year.[47] Kshatriya featured a star cast of Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Dutt, Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna, Rakhee Gulzar, Meenakshi Seshadri, Raveena Tandon and Divya Bharti. Released worldwide on 26 March 1993, it recorded a record-breaking opening at the box office. Although it was well received by both critics and audiences, the film was banned from theatres due to Sanjay Dutt's involvement in 1993 Bombay bombings case.[48]\n\nAlso in 1993, Deol reunited with Rajkumar Santoshi to play an alcoholic lawyer in the highly successful crime drama Damini and was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor and the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor.[49][50] The pathbreaking film was praised for breaking social taboos and handling the subject of rape with sensitivity; a rarity in Bollywood at the time.[51] It further strengthened Deol's He-Man image. His dialogues in the film \"Tarikh Pe Tarikh\" (date after date) and \"Dhai Kilo Ka Haath\" (Two-and-a-half kilogram hand) became iconic and a pop-culture reference.[52] The film was a milestone in the careers of Deol as well as Amrish Puri who went onto star in various films together in the future.[53] Besides being critically acclaimed, the film also became the sixth highest grossing film of the year and was declared a \"hit\" by Box Office India.[54] That same year, Deol portrayed the character of a lieutenant army officer in Yash Chopra's musical psychological thriller Darr. The film earned Deol his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. It was declared a blockbuster and was the third-highest grossing film of the year in India, and the highest-grossing Indian film of the year in the overseas markets. It received widespread acclaim from critics upon release. It was also noted for being Shah Rukh Khan's breakthrough film.\n\nIn 1994's Insaniyat, he appeared alongside Amitabh Bachchan. The production had finished in 1988 but it was delayed for several years and finally released on 11 March 1994. By the time it released, Bachchan had gone into semi-retirement post the release of Khuda Gawah (1992) and it was citied as Bachchan's last film. Due to Deol and Bachchan's pairing, the film got an excellent opening but was panned critically due to poor editing and unfinished storyline. It still turned out to be the 10th highest grossing film of the year.[55]\n\nIn 1998, Deol collaborated with Guddu Dhanoa once again after Ziddi (1997), to star in the action film Salaakhen. Featuring an identical cast to Ziddi, Raveena Tandon, Anupam Kher and Farida Jalal played supporting roles. The film was noted for its action sequences, cast performances and a notable monologue delivered by Deol during a courtroom hearing.[65] Released on 24 April 1998, it recorded an excellent opening and was another hit for the actor.[66]\n\nHis 1999 film Arjun Pandit marked his first collaboration with director Rahul Rawail after Yodha. Due to the critical and commercial success of their previous collaborations Arjun (1985) and Yodha (1991), the film was one of the most awaited films of the year. Although it was not well reviewed upon release, the film became a hit. UP gangster Vikas Dubey was reported to be an ardent fan of this movie and rumoured to have watched it over 100 times. Inspired by his love for this movie, he had earned the monicker Pandit.[67] In 1999 he made his directorial debut with Dillagi starring himself, his brother and Urmila Matondkar, but the film failed to gain success.[68]\n\nIn 2002, Deol starred in the war film Maa Tujhhe Salaam which opened strongly and despite being amongst the highest grossing films of the year, only emerged as a box office disappointment due to poor reviews.[80] He played the role of Indian revolutionary Chandra Shekhar Azad in 23rd March 1931: Shaheed, starring his brother Bobby Deol in the role of Bhagat Singh. The film's release coincided with another film based on Bhagat Singh, directed by Rajkumar Santoshi and titled The Legend of Bhagat Singh. Both films failed at the box office.[81][82]\n\nDuring this phase of his career, Deol ventured into a range of films that deviated from his usual style and the prevailing trends of the Bollywood industry, unfortunately achieving lackluster success.[87]\n\nIn 2004, Deol starred in Lakeer, which featured an ensemble cast including Sunil Shetty, and newcomers Sohail Khan and John Abraham. The film was a flop.[88] In the same year, he starred in the sports comedy film Rok Sako To Rok Lo, another flop.[89]\n\nIn early 2006, Deol starred in the techno-thriller Teesri Aankh. It marked the second time he co-starred alongside Ameesha Patel, after the all time blockbuster Gadar. The film is also inspired by the 1994 movie Mute Witness. It was panned by critics and turned out to be a disaster.[91] In September 2006, Deol took on a role in the action-adventure film Naksha, an endeavour by Bollywood to capture the essence of films seen in the Indiana Jones and The Mummy series. Despite being hailed as ahead of its time by certain critics, the movie unfortunately met with box office failure.[92]\n\nDeol kicked off 2007 with another atypical film for the time, Big Brother, a vigilante film. This was supposed to be Priyanka Chopra's first release in 2002 but was delayed by almost 5 years.[93][94] Continuing his year, he appeared in the comedic caper Fool N Final, sharing the spotlight with emerging talents Shahid Kapoor and Ayesha Takia. This film was also a box office disappointment. Deol appeared alongside his father Dharmendra and brother Bobby Deol together for the first time in Apne (2007), a sports-drama film.[15] The film garnered significant hype and achieved considerable success.[95]\n\nIn 2008, he appeared with his brother again in the ensemble film Heroes. Deol's performance, although brief, was praised. 2009 saw Deol star in the thriller Fox (2009) opposite Arjun Rampal. It marked Deol's first film appearing as an antagonist. The film was inspired from Hollywood film A Murder of Crows (1999).[96] The film failed miserably at the box office.[97][98]\n\nDeol's first release of 2010 was Neeraj Pathak's crime thriller Right Yaaa Wrong which had him playing a police inspector.[99]Yamla Pagla Deewana which also featured him alongside his father and brother was Deol's only release in 2011 and was declared a hit.[100]\n\nIn 2016, Ghayal Once Again was released which was a sequel to his 1990 film Ghayal. It marked Deol's second film directorial since Dillagi (1999). It was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. The action sequences were praised but the story and pacing were criticised. The film earned well but ultimately failed.\n\nIn 2017, he and his brother appeared in Shreyas Talpade's comedy film Poster Boys, which flopped at the box office.[104] This was Bobby Deol's comeback film after a hiatus of three years but could not re-establish him. a3c65b3c4b\n\nhill a first course in coding theory pdf downloadgolkes\n\nagilent intuilink data capture software 12\n\nCrack Batman Arkham Asylum Mac\n\nwyse usb firmware tool 1.20 download\n\nAdvanced Archive Password Recovery 4.53 Serial Keygen Cd-key"
