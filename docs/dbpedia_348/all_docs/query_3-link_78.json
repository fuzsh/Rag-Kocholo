        "text": "Worst way to begin an Oscars monologue\n\n“It’s going to be a long night,” said host Jimmy Kimmel, followed by “Is it a bumpy night already?” And, 28 minutes later, the evening’s first award was finally presented.\n\nCillian Murphy wins the best actor Oscar for portraying the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in “Oppenheimer.” “For better or for worse, we’re all living in Oppenheimer’s world,” Murphy said in his acceptance speech. (Chris Pizzello)\n\nLuck of the Irish\n\n“I’m a very proud Irishman, standing up here tonight,” Murphy said. Like Randolph, he won an acting Oscar for his very first nomination. (Speaking of Irishmen, Murphy joins three-time winner and retiree Daniel Day-Lewis in the best-actors-from-Ireland club. Lewis was born in London but has Irish citizenship.)\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph accepts the award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role for her role as a grieving cook in \"The Holdovers\" during the Oscars Sunday at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. “For so long, I’ve always wanted to be different, and now I realize I just need to be myself,” she said. “And I thank you. I thank you for seeing me.” (Chris Pizzello/Associated Press)\n\nShe gives a good speech\n\nWe learned as her award was being presented that Randolph wore her grandmother’s glasses in “The Holdovers” and, in her speech, she said her mother was the one who suggested acting could be her destiny. Having won every pre-Oscar award and given a whole bunch of speeches, she went with gratitude for getting to be an actor. “I’ve always wanted to be different,” she said as she accepted best supporting actress, but now, “I just want to be myself.”\n\nRobert Downey Jr. accepts the award for best performance by an actor in a supporting role for \"Oppenheimer.\" “I’d like to thank my terrible childhood and the academy, in that order,” Downey jokes. (Chris Pizzello/Associated Press)\n\nFrom hoosegow to Oscar\n\nSupporting actor winner Downey thanked his “Oppenheimer” director Nolan and continued his string of droll, self-deprecatory speeches by paying tribute to his entertainment lawyer. The veteran actor, whose struggle with substance abuse has been well documented, said his lawyer spent years “trying to get me insured and bailing me out of the hoosegow.”\n\nRyan Gosling, who played Ken in “Barbie,” performs “I’m Just Ken,” one of the movie’s two nominated songs Sunday at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Gosling was joined by 65 Kens and Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash. (Chris Pizzello)\n\nBest song(s)\n\nCredit where it’s due: The best song category has long been an industry joke, with one terrible performance after another. But this year may have been the best in Oscar history for song nominees, with Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell’s goosebump-inducing rendition of “What Was I Made For?” from “Barbie,” a rousing “Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)” from “Killers of the Flower Moon,” and Ryan Gosling (and fellow Ken actors) climaxing the song performances with a triumphant “I’m Just Ken” sing-along that even roped in Gosling’s “La-La Land” co-star Emma Stone.\n\nRich things\n\nThe most eye-popping movie of the year did well in the early-evening craft categories, with “Poor Things” — set in a magical world that looks a bit like several places in Europe — winning for its production design, costumes and makeup."
