Shahid Kapoor is still hailed as the 'chocolaty man' in the film industry, despite making his debut twenty years ago with the film, Ishq Vishk. Over the years, he has played many characters and often showed off his rowdiness on the silver screen. However, one thing that remained attached to him is that he is an amazing dancer. Recently, Shahid performed LIVE on the stage at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 2023, in Goa. However, he had a terrible fall on the stage, and a video of him has been going viral.

When Shahid Kapoor revealed that he always felt like 'an outsider' in the industry

In an interview with Pinkvilla Masterclass, Shahid Kapoor talked about his feelings of always feeling like an outsider, despite his father, Pankaj Kapur, being an integral part of the film industry. Shahid revealed that during the initial years, he didn't reveal that he was Pankaj Kapur's son. The actor shared that his father, Pankaj Kapur, always said that 'he never used his father's name'. He was quoted as saying:

"I am an outsider in the industry from the point of view that my father (Pankaj Kapur) was an actor but I never told anybody that he was my dad because I lived a lot in Delhi and I came to Bombay later in life and my father had always told me that, 'Beta maine kabhi kisi ko nahi bataya ki mere father kaun hai, toh tum kyu bologe. Kaam se dikhao. Let your work prove to people that you are worthy. Not your name.' So of course I have come from a family of acting but my father was the first actor in the family, first of all."

When Shahid Kapoor opened up about being constantly compared to Shah Rukh Khan

In an interview with Pinkvilla, Shahid revealed that he has been constantly compared to Shah Rukh Khan throughout his career. The actor shared that he hates when people compare an artist to already successful ones. Talking about the same, Shahid Kapoor said:

“It’s the worst thing that can happen. Why should you be the next anything? You are you and they are they. And that is the worst part of the job that you are doing, that you must be like somebody who is already successful. If you are like them, by virtue of that, you will be successful in the future. This is the dumbest logic that I have ever heard in my life.”
