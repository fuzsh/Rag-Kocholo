Barbie Horseshoes

Many little girls grew up playing with Barbies. Their bedrooms and outfits took on a fun pink color palette. At some point, most traded pastel and hot pink tones for neutral shades. With the release of Warner Bros new movie, Barbie, some fans are reliving their pink days!

Irish Master Farrier, Brian Horohoe got a special request recently. His client wanted pink shoes put on her horse. He happily obliged! These horseshoes are just like regular ones, though they come in a hot pink color.

The pictures were originally shared on his Facebook and Instagram. The post has gotten quite a lot of attention with comments like, "Nice paint job", "Amazing", "They look fabulous". Overall, cowgirls are loving them!

What do you think? Are pink horseshoes in your horse's future? First, you have to get your farrier to agree. Not all of them will be on board!
