        "text": "1925\n\nWatchlist\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nEither you loved Tom Mix or you disapproved of his turning westerns into three-ring circuses. The Lucky Horseshoe presented Mix at his very best/worst in a story that was more Douglas Fairbanks than William S. Hart. Spurned by his employer's daughter, Elvira (Billie Dove, foreman Rand Foster turns the ranch into a tourist attraction. The girl returns with her fiancee, Denton (Malcolm Waite), an allegedly distinguished European whom she plans to wed on the property. Foster attempts to seduce the girl very much a la his hero Don Juan, and Denton orders his servant to kidnap the lovesick foreman until the upcoming nuptials. In captivity, Foster dreams he is Don Juan at the court of Barcelona, awakening to the realization that there is no time to waste. Escaping his captors, the foreman races to the altar, unmasks Denton as an imposter, and takes the bride for himself. Fox spent a fortune making sure this Mix vehicle became a winner, including having the dream sequences filmed in two-strip Technicolor and engaging Ziegfeld Follies star Ann Pennington as one of \"Don Juan's\" conquests. Leading lady Billie Dove enjoyed a reputation as one of America's most beautiful women at the time. As an actress, however, she was, according to former co-star Lon Chaney, \"one of those 'blah' sorts.\" A young Gary Cooper, still using his real name, Frank Cooper, had a bit part as one of the ranch hands in this film."
