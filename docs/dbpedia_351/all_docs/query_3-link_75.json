        "text": "MIDDLESEX, July 1—Horse‐j shoe pitchers from the Middle Atlantic states gathered in! Mountain View Park here today and found that the men, who dominate the sport, hold! no monopoly on skill and endurance.\n\nThe only woman among the 55 contestants in the annual tournament of the New Jersey State Horseshoe Pitchers Association was Mrs. Jeanette Kemmerer, a 47‐year‐old mother of two children, and she took top prize in her rated class by beating five men.\n\nMrs. Kemmerer, who works a sa secretary, was not intimidated by being the only woman in the tournament.\n\n‘Hit 36 Per Cent’\n\n“We both started throwing a year ago,” said her husband, Don, who also competed today and who concedes her superiority.\n\n“I'm apparently at my peak as a 25 per cent player,” he said, “but my wife is constantly raising her average. Today she hit 36 per cent and won a cash prize and a memento. I am both proud and embarrasSed.”\n\nHorseshoe pitchers are rated on the basis of 100 per cent for throwing ringers only to a total. of 50 points, which, ends a game. Points are also awarded for proximity of six inches” or less. The second player can nullify an opponent's. ringer by covering a ringer with one of his own.\n\nThe reigning world champion horseshoe pitcher, Elmer Hohl of Wellesley, Ont., tosses the 2⅓‐pound steel shoe ‘at steady average of above 95 per cent of accuracy , according to Vince Yannetti of Bound Brook, tournament chairman.\n\nThe junior world champion this year is Ray (Deadeye) Williams of Eureka, Calif. On an ‘off day he has missed the spike only four or five times in 50 or more tosses.\n\n“At 12 years of age he is going great and seems to be improving all the time,” Mr. Yannetti observed.\n\nAlvin Cherry of Plainfield, who works as a supervisor ‘for the Knickerbocker Toy Company, recalled that two Presidents of the United States were known for their skill in the game.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was known to toss horseshoes with skill, the game's unofficial historian here said, and Harry S. Truman tossed.horseshoes as boy on the farm at Grand’ View, Mo When he reached the White House, he had a horseshoe court installed behind the Presidential residence, Mr. Cherry said.\n\nThe game has international standing with Canadians, Britons and Scandinavians, who are participating in increasing numbers, Mr. Yannetti ,said.\n\n“We understand it all began with Roman legionaires throwing worn‐out ‘ horseshdes at pegs stuck in the ground,” Mr. Yannetti added.\n\nThe centers of greatest horseshoe‐pitching interest in this country are New Jersey, Ohio, western Pennsylvan41, New England and California."
