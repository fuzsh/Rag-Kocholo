        "text": "The Horseshoe Origin Story\n\nSettlers were drawn to Bellingham in the 1850’s by jobs created through the growing industries of logging, coal-mining and fishing.\n\nThe original Horseshoe opened its doors in downtown Bellingham on Holly Street to satisfy the large appetites of these tough, ornery folks in the summer of 1886.\n\nInitially, the Horseshoe hosted a variety of features: selling smoking accessories, fishing licenses & tackle, hunting supplies, gifts and novelties alongside the restaurant & cocktail lounge.\n\nIn early 1900, the ‘Shoe was establishing itself as one of the best places in the Bellingham area for great food, fine tobaccos and a place to meet friends over a good beer and some fine spirit.\n\nBy 1950 the ‘Shoe became one of the first ‘licensed’ bars in Whatcom County. Our current neighbor, the Beaver Inn, was also licensed around this time. Relocating in 1958, the ‘Shoe moved across the street to it’s current location!\n\nROWDY BUCKAROO\n\nThe Horseshoe has over 135 years of history and we think Rowdy Buckaroo might be our favorite piece of it all.\n\nIn the early 2000’s, Horseshoe Cafe mascot Rowdy Buckaroo was the Robin Hood of downtown parking meters.\n\nFamous for plugging dimes in expired meters to save shoppers from a parking ticket, he would leave behind a small card that said “You’ve been rescued by Rowdy Buckaroo.”\n\nThe idea was to prove that the Horseshoe was not just a place of business, but a force within the community trying to make downtown a better place to shop.\n\nFor years, Rowdy drove around in his custom van, becoming the champion of Bellingham shoppers.\n\nTo commemorate Rowdy Buckaroo & his contribution to the community, local artist Shawn Cass painted a mural in his honor on the side of the cafe!"
