        "text": "Horseshoes (1977)\n\n** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nJohn Holmes is playing horseshoes when the beautiful Desiree West walks up to him. The two quickly move into the house where they eventually get around to some sex. I say eventually because this loops runs just nine minutes yet it takes almost four and a half until we get to the actual sex. That's quite a bit of time for a loop like this. With that said, if you're a fan of either Holmes or West then you'll probably want to check this out. There's certainly nothing overly special about the film but it's going to appeal to those who enjoy these 70's loops."
