        "text": "[slow relaxing music] - What's important for me on the farm is that when guests come here, whether they're staying overnight, or just visiting the spa, or the restaurant for the day that they feel like this is a place they can be themselves, and take a deep breath, unwind, relax.\n\n[slow relaxing music continues] It's kind of like the biggest gift of this place is being able to offer that for others, and watch them experience it.\n\n[slow relaxing music continues] - We're at the Horse Shoe Farm located in Hendersonville, North Carolina.\n\nWe're an 85-acre farm resort.\n\n- [Jordan] We have lodging for up to 61 people in eight different homes.\n\nWe have the Stable Spa, which is our full service luxury spa in a renovated stable.\n\nWe have the Silo Cookhouse, which is our dining room here.\n\nWe do a modern farm-to-table dinner party every night for 40 people.\n\n[slow relaxing music] - [Rachel] We have taken our silo, and cut out the bottom, and we turned it into a bar so you can hang out there, and just come relax and enjoy some time on the farm.\n\n- We were living in Los Angeles prior to this, had just started our family.\n\nWe have two small boys, and my father asked me to come out, and see the farm, and I drove through the gates, and I was just blown away by it.\n\nThat was December, 2017.\n\nJuly, 2018, we opened to a family of 50 that took the property for two weeks, and it's kind of been like wildfire since then.\n\nI thought I was just doing lodging, and here we are close to five years later with the spa, with the restaurant, the pool, and it's really morphed into this really beautiful farm experience.\n\n[uptempo cheery music] We're in the silo cookouts here, which I call the heart of the farm.\n\nIt's our lobby, our lounge, and our dining room.\n\nWe do dinner service here four nights a week.\n\nIt is a modern farm-to=table dinner party [people murmuring] - In connection with all of the things we try and do to create the ultimate guest experience.\n\nMy opportunity is to provide you with one of the best dining experiences that you can have.\n\nAt seven o'clock, we have passed hors d'oeuvres and cocktails.\n\nand at 07:30, just like when this was a working farm, I ring the cookhouse bell, [bell ringing] and Chef will talk about our first course, and then the food all comes out at once, so we all dine together.\n\nIt's so convivial, and optimistic.\n\n- [Jordan] You see every night, people are leaving with friends, with connections, with this, like, great experience.\n\nThe food is fabulous, if it's not grown here, from local vendors and farmers in the area.\n\n- Jordan and I, for years, had been wanting to start some kind of a supper club.\n\nThe concept was just, okay, let's partner with a farm, a vendor, a purveyor for each month, and we'll feature their product across a three-course, family-style meal, we'll have our chefs play with it, and showcase it, and it's been really incredible to see people take to that idea, and really just learn more about what's in this community.\n\n- We've done it with Lee's One Fortune Laotian Farm that produces Hmong, the best rice I've ever had, and we're doing another supper club with Carolina Ground, folks right here in Hendersonville, mill some of the best flower in the country.\n\nWhen the sun's setting at nine o'clock at night in the summertime, and you're sitting there, and you're having your entree, I'm just kind of, like, where else on earth would I rather be?\n\n[slow relaxing music ends] [slow relaxing music] - One of the things that, when I was drawn to this property, just like the magic of driving in here, was this idea of giving people a place to have space, to relax, to heal.\n\nI knew I needed to find a place to make that happen, and so the old stables were on the farm here, and they're absolutely gorgeous, and the first time I ever walked into them I was like, \"Why don't we convert the stable into a space?\"\n\n- The Stable Spa is a unique and gorgeous space here on the Horse Shoe Farm.\n\nWe offer a variety of massages.\n\nWe also specialize in a lot of esoteric services too, like cranial sacral sound therapy.\n\nWe utilize the herbs and flowers that we grow here in our garden in our services.\n\nSo we'll be making herbal and flower infused oils that we'll use in our treatments.\n\nThe whole energy of this property and this spa is so unique, and so different from any other place.\n\nI hope they'll take away the sense of calm and serenity combined with the massage or facial treatment that they got, and when they leave they're just gonna feel totally amazing and absolutely different from how they walked in.\n\n[slow relaxing music continues] - This is our home, and we are raising our family here on this farm.\n\nEvery time a guest comes here, we feel like we're welcoming them into our home.\n\nI mean, we started where we were the ones cooking dinner for our guests, and we still are involved in all the little details but it's grown and grown in this beautiful way, and I hope that everyone who passes through here finds some connection, whether it's with the folks they came with, whether it's to themselves, or the land, the animals, just taking that pause, making that memory, and taking that with them as they go on their way, and hopefully come back.\n\n[slow relaxing music ends] - The Horse Shoe Farm is at 155 Horse Shoe Farm Drive in Hendersonville.\n\nTo learn about their lodging, dining, and spa retreats, check them out online at thehorseshoefarm.com, or give them a call at [828] 393-3034."
