        "text": "The best place to start your visit is at the Visitor Center, open daily from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Restrooms, water fountains, exhibits, and a bookstore are all located here. An information desk staffed by a National Park Service representative is available, as well as a bookstore operated by a non-profit education partner. Sales at the park bookstore directly contribute funds used for special events, education activities, and other programs that increase public understanding and engagement in the Horseshoe Bend story.\n\nThe parkâ€™s official orientation film is shown on request in the auditorium. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend is a 22 minute exploration of the events leading up to the battle, as well as the tragic day of March 27, 1814 when over 800 people died on this now protected site. The film is also available on DVD at the park bookstore or from Eastern National."
