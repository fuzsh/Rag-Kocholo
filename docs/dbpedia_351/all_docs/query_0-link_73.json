        "text": "Five Corners, Angel Heart, and The Verdict, and the Sex and the City movie also filmed scenes in this establishment\n\nOn the outside it looks like an ordinary bar, you would never guess it is place where the Rosato brothers try (and fail) to strangle Frank Pentangelli in the Godfather Part II. The bar is also the the backdrop of a gunfight that takes place right on the corner of 7th Street and Avenue B. Vazac’s Horseshoe Bar, also know as 7B and the Horseshoe Bar is a favorite of the residents of Alphabet City. The structure has been around since the 1935, when it was built as a Polish catering hall. Its Tudor windows look out onto an original advertisement with the original phone number: OR4-2568\n\nThe bar was also featured in the movie Crocodile Dundee.\n\nThe bar is rumored to have also made appearances on Law & Order. The 7B of today is a dimly lit dive bar with a jukebox and a Pinball machine, which provides the crowds with cheap drinks until the wee hours of the night. 7B was called “wonderfully grimy” by Time Out New York.\n\nVazac’s Horseshoe Bar is actually shaped like a horseshoe, like the original bar nearby at the Museum of the American Gangster."
