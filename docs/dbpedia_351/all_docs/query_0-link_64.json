One equestrian took it to the next level and requested pink shoes for her horse! What's the verdict... are pink shoes a yay or nay?\n\nBarbie Horseshoes\n\nMany little girls grew up playing with Barbies. Their bedrooms and outfits took on a fun pink color palette. At some point, most traded pastel and hot pink tones for neutral shades. With the release of Warner Bros new movie, Barbie, some fans are reliving their pink days!\n\nIrish Master Farrier, Brian Horohoe got a special request recently. His client wanted pink shoes put on her horse. He happily obliged! These horseshoes are just like regular ones, though they come in a hot pink color.\n\nThe pictures were originally shared on his Facebook and Instagram. The post has gotten quite a lot of attention with comments like, \"Nice paint job\", \"Amazing\", \"They look fabulous\". Overall, cowgirls are loving them!\n\nWhat do you think? Are pink horseshoes in your horse's future? First, you have to get your farrier to agree. Not all of them will be on board!"
