        "text": "Colorado is known for its natural beauty. Majestic mountain ranges, vast open areas, 14 diverse regions and 300 days of sunshine are a big draw for Hollywood. The Colorado Office of Film, Television and Media works to promote the state as an ideal location for filming. For its part, Estes Park has hosted two major productions.\n\nLooking for a unique experience while visiting the area? Spend the day visiting the Stanley Hotel which is featured in TV and film.\n\nWhile you’re adventuring, make Estes Park Jellystone Park™ your home base. We are a family owned and operated RV park and campground. We have RV campsites and can accommodate RVs and motorhomes up to 40 feet long.\n\nDon’t consider yourself a camper? Opt for an RV rental or cabin instead. We have ones that sleep anywhere from 5 to 14 people! We’re home to Yogi Bear™, but you don’t need to travel with kids to stay here. Many Passport America members, full-time RVers and retirees stay with us because of our location and superior customer service. We’re a family owned and operated business and take great pride in our Colorado campground!\n\nDumb & Dumber\n\nFilmed in 1994 and starring Jim Carrey (Lloyd) and Jeff Daniels (Harry) this comedy has become a cult classic. The ‘Danbury Hotel’ where Lloyd and Harry stay is actually the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park. The scene where Lloyd is waiting for Mary Swanson (played by Lauren Holly) in the ‘Avalanche Bar & Grill’ is the Stanley Hotel’s bar. The hotel is located at 333 West Wonder View Avenue, a short drive from our RV Park in Estes Park.\n\nStanley Hotel has panoramic views of Lake Estes, the Rocky Mountains and Long’s Peak. The hotel offers tours where you can learn more of the history. For those into ghost hunting, you may like the night tour. As described by the hotel’s website, “This evening tour takes you to a few darkened spaces and introduces you to the ‘active’ phenomena and spirit folklore surrounding our 100+ year old hotel.”\n\nThe Shining TV Mini-Series\n\nThe Stanley Hotel was also home to The Shining TV Mini-Series which aired in 1997. The original movie starring Jack Nicholson was not filmed here, but the hotel is said to have inspired the book written by Stephen King. King stayed at the hotel sometime in 1974 and the book was published in 1977. The movie – directed by Stanley Kubrick – is considered iconic, but it’s reported that King didn’t like it because it changed too much of his book. He created the mini-series to give his own adaptation of the book and went back to the original Stanley Hotel for filming.\n\nThe Colorado Office of Film, Television and Media list several other productions filmed in Estes Park: Centennial (1978 TV mini-series), Serotonin Rising (2009 documentary), Different Kinds (2007), Touring America’s National Parks: Second Edition (1989 video documentary), Descent Into Madness (2007 short) and America (1971 TV series.)\n\nReady to Visit Estes Park?\n\nAfter your trip to Stanley Hotel, you may be ready to relax at our heated pool. Or you could try a round of mini-golf or horseshoes. Sit outside and take in the night sky lit up by stars. Maybe even pop in a DVD of Dumb and Dumber or one of the other shows filmed here. It’s fun to watch and say, “I’ve been there.” But if you decide to watch The Shining, you may need to sleep with the light on!"
