        "text": "Springfield offers up one of the most filling sandwiches in the Midwest.\n\nThis unique open-faced sandwich is definitely a must!!\n\nJust know, it will blow your diet...but, it is so worth it!\n\nStart off with two thick slices of toasted Texas Toast, topped with your choice of meat, then cover that with a heaping pile of crispy French fries and drench with homemade cheese sauce!! WOW!! This signature dish can be found at most local restaurants who serve pub & American-style food.\n\nHistory Behind the Recipe\n\nThe Signature Horseshoe Sandwich was created in 1928 at the Old Leland Hotel by Joe Schweska.\n\nThe idea came about with the help of Elizabeth, Chef Schweska's wife, after he came home saying he was in need of a new lunch item for the Leland Hotel Restaurant.\n\nThe name \"horseshoe\" was derived from the shape of the cut of ham used in the original sandwich.\n\nThe French fries represent the nails of the shoe, and the sizzle platter represents the hot anvil.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1939 Christmas Edition of the State Journal Register that Chef Schweska finally revealed the secret recipe.\n\nTry your hand at making a Horseshoe from home\n\nINGREDIENTS (THE SAUCE IS KEY):\n\n2 egg yolks\n\n1/2 cup beer\n\n2 tablespoons butter\n\n3 cups grated sharp Old English Cheddar or Colby Longhorn cheese\n\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n\n1/4 teaspoon dry mustard\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1 dash cayenne pepper\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\nBeat the egg yolks and beer together. Melt the butter and cheese over boiling water, stirring in one direction only with a wooden spoon. Add the seasonings. Stirring constantly, add the beer and egg mixture a little at a time. Keep the mixture piping hot as you stir, but don't let it bubble. Constant stirring and the very best cheese will yield a smooth, uncurdled mixture.\n\nThe sandwich is made by laying two pieces of toast on a preheated platter, place the meat on the toast, covering the entire sandwich with cheese sauce, and circling the platter with french fries. Add a dash of paprika for color and you have yourself a horseshoe.\n\nDownload your copy of the recipe here."
