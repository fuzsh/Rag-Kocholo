That was in 1988, when I was a bright-eyed drama student at New York University with big dreams of becoming the next Marlon Brando. Or Sam Shepard. Or both.\n\nI hadn't thought about the Horseshoe Bar in a while, until last week, when I suddenly saw my old local on the silver screen as a central location in \"Rent,\" the new movie version of Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer Prize winning 1996 musical about a group of melodic strivers living in the East Village.\n\nBut something was wrong. The bar in the movie, which opened on Wednesday, wasn't called the Horseshoe Bar. It's called the Life Café, which is the name of a real restaurant right across Tompkins Square Park. (Stay with me here.)\n\nIn an act of poetic license, the makers of the movie \"Rent\" shot the facade of the Horseshoe, but when the action moves inside, it's a fictional version of the Life Café, which, for the record, looks a lot like the real Life Café, if patrons of the real Life Café periodically broke into elaborate song-and-dance routines.\n\nThat detail is just one of the small, reality-twisting inaccuracies in \"Rent\" that will no doubt drive certain East Villagers crazy.\n\nThey are little things, like the presence of a subway stop on Tompkins Square Park. (Would that there were.) Or the fact that the Mars Bar, the down-and-dirty Second Avenue watering hole, is midblock in the movie. (It's actually on a corner.) Or that the side street on which the Renters live in the movie doesn't actually exist. (A blurry street sign suggests that it is somewhere off East 11th Street at Avenue A, but it looks nothing like that block. Or any other block, for that matter.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
