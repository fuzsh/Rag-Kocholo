Larry, through a series of mix-ups--including hitting the boxer in the face with a tomato--winds up in the ring with him but, with the aid of some strategically placed horseshoes, manages to knock the boxer out. When he comes to and finds out what happened, the outraged boxer sets out after Larry.",

        "text": "1923\n\nAn absolutely delightful two-reel romp featuring lesser-known (for what is probably a fairly obvious reason) silent comedian Larry Semon (a name which always leads to me trying to figure out what \"Larry\" would mean as an adjective).\n\nMoving along, this is just a ton of fun. Boxing, car stunts, motorcycle stunts, mistaken identities, vegetable throwing, devious monkeys, it's got it all. It's not quite as profound in its invention as the work of the \"three geniuses\" (Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd), but Semon's absolutely taken all the right lessons from their work."
