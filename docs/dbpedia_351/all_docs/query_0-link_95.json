        "text": "Post by Koastal Karl on\n\nThe Queen of Esquimalt was shown at Tsawwassen on some TV show years ago. They were actually on board. Dont forget the movie Disturbing Behavior which is sort of a sci fi type movie filmed on Bowen Island. The Queen of Capilano, Nanny and Bowen or Mayne Queens were all shown in that movie. Also Another Stakeout was filmed on Bowen Island, show's a C class passing a waterfront house, and also underway on the Bowen or Mayne Queens.\n\nPost by Dane on\n\nEsq, Van, and Saanich are on Free Willy 2 or 3. They used 1 for filiming, and the other two were in regular service. For whatever reaon I don't recall them catching the Spirits. This said I haven't watched it for like 7 years.\n\nTheres also a Martin Lawrfence film on a V or B class, I cannot recall.\n\nPost by Ferryman on\n\nI remember seeing a movie from the 80's with a car chase that was going around Downtown Vancouver and then all of the sudden resulted in jumping the ramp on to the Queen of Vancouver at Tsawwassen. Someone claimed it was \"Shoot to Kill\" I believe. I haven't seen the movie on TV since and I keep looking out for it at pawn shops.\n\nPost by Koastal Karl on\n\nIn that movie Disturbing Behavior they are racing to get off the island at the end which where Snug Cove is called Cradle Bay in the movie. This family moves to the island from a the big city, dont know which city, somewhere in the states. But something wierd that goes on on the island. There is a guy on a motorcycle who races down the main street toward Snug Cove smashes through the gate and jumps the dock onto the Capilano. Of course when you see the ferry docked it's one of the Bowen Class but when there on the ferry it's the Capilano.\n\nHas anyone seen Free Willy 3?? And how much of the ferries do they show in the 3rd?? Just curious if I should see it or not?? It's not number 2 cause I have that one, and Washington State Ferries are used in that one.\n\nPost by Ferryman on\n\nI wouldn't remember, I saw that movie once like right when it was released on to VHS. I remember seeing a V-Class of some sort in the backround in the starting and ending of the first one when they show all of the orcas jumping out of the water and stuff\n\nPost by Koastal Karl on\n\nWhich movie?? Disturbing Behavior never had a V class in it except a brief shot of the Nanny or the Burnaby. Pretty sure it was the Nanny though. No V class though. Might of been filmed on parts of Galiano too. Not sure though.\n\nPost by Koastal Karl on\n\nWere there any ferries in the first Free Willy movie?? I havent seen that one in a long time.\n\nFree Willy 2 shows one of WSF Evergreen State class ferries in the Saun Juans, they are actually onboard the ferry and also the Sealth or Walla Walla at Friday Harbour. That whole movie was filmed on Saun Juan Island as I reconize Friday Harbour.\n\nOh another movie is, oh shoot, cant remember the name darn it, but it had Jennifer Lopez in it who was on a Steel Electric Class ferry on the Port Townsend route.\n\nAlso the first ring movie, about 5-10 mins was filmed on the Quinalt, a wild horse in a carrier got loose and charged the car deck then finally went over board and well, you know, fell under the ship, propellers got it, then the next thing you see is the wake from the ferry then all this blood coming up, well if you seen the movie you'll know.\n\nAlso Scary Movie 3 the part with the Bowen Class was the Spoof for the Ring movie with the Quinalt.\n\nPost by Koastal Karl on\n\nI dont know which is the regular ferry on the Port Townsend run but in the move The Ring I know for sure it was the Quinalt because it showed the name. And also I dont think they would use one of the regular ferries that are in service for filming parts of a movie. They would need to use one that isent in service.\n\nPost by SS San Mateo on\n\nKarl said:\n\nI dont know which is the regular ferry on the Port Townsend run but in the move The Ring I know for sure it was the Quinalt because it showed the name.\n\nThe Klickitat is the regular boat. The Quinault operates as a 2'nd boat on that run from late Spring - early Fall and as maintenance substitute for the Kilckitat, Illahee, and Rhododendron.\n\n-- LB\n\nPost by SS San Mateo on\n\nThere was some movie a year ot two ago on either TBS or TNT that showed a C Class ferry (at least an upper car deck shot).\n\nI recall seeing either a TV show or movie which featured the Sechelt Queen (may have bene filmed after she was retired).\n\nA C Class ferry (not sure which one) appeared on \"Memories of Murder\" (a Lifetime movie). It was supposed to take place in Seattle, but it was clearly filmed in Vancouver (at one point someone was driving over a bridge and BC Place Stadium was in the background. A traffic report on the radio mentions the Evergreen Point floating bridge... rather useless when you're in Vancouver).\n\n-- LB\n\nPost by Koastal Karl on\n\nYes Disturbing Behavior is on DVD. Darn it, I have the VHS but I was looking at the DVD on Amazon and it's got a whole bunch of deleted scenes never shown in theaters. They might have more ferry scenes as I do remember seeing it on TV and there it seemed there was more scenes than on the VHS I have.\n\nHere is a link so you can read about the movie\n\nwww.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792840127/qid%3D1112737018/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/002-7215811-9795232\n\nIt's sort of a sci fi thriller type movie. It's neat though that it was filmed on Bowen Island though.\n\nPost by clay on\n\nAnother film which contained footage of a BCF was the ultra low budget sci-fi film Food of the Gods, filmed in 1976,mostly on Bowen Island, with additional scenes filmed at Empire Stadium, which was part of the P.N.E. That was the original home of the B.C. Lions. Anyway, the ferry footage was of the Queen of the North (Queen of Surrey back in those days) berthed in Horseshoe Bay. And yes, the movie sucked. It was about a strange substance that oozed out of the ground that made whatever ate it grow 100 times its original size. You want unbelievably bad special effects? You haven't lived until you've seen the giant wasp scene in this turkey (speaking of turkeys, I think there's a scene with a giant chicken, too). This one ranks right up there in the \"so bad it's hilarious\" category. Worth watching for the Vancouver area and QotN footage, plus the stupefyingly awful F/X.\n\nPost by Koastal Karl on\n\noh man, film producers sure must love Bowen Island. Alot of movies have either been filmed there or in the area. Another movie that was filmed on Bowen Island was Another Stakeout. Shows basically onboard one the ferries on the top deck of the Bowen or Mayne Queens from Horseshoe Bay to Bowen Island. And also a C class passing the island, and again offloading at Snug Cove."
