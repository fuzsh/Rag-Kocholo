        "meta_description": "Youssef Soltane, a 45 year-old Tunisian intellectual, is the product of a generation that lived the era of euphoria and great ideologies in the sixties, and their subsequent failure. He was incarcerated and tortured for his political opinions. Furthermore, his relationship with Zineb, a young, beautiful bourgeois, only brings him more trouble. During one long winter night, Youssef wanders in search of an emotional haven, prey to all the questions that flood his memory.\r\n\r\nIt deals with political persecution, political abuse. The filmmaker took his story in the prison. It is a live experience which shows the injustice. Meanwhile, we have to talk about shame and bad things to the entire world, and then we can heal the wounds. That because our present and our future are being monopolized by our past",
