        "text": "A local film production company is shooting a movie in the Lucky Horseshoe called “Bar America,” and the producers need extras as barflies in the movie. Want to be a star?!?\n\nI thought you’d like to be in the know, and if you feel like posting about the opportunity for neighborhood folks to be extras in this film, please let them know to email patrick@gorockbridge.com or text Patrick on 925-719-4648 about the interest. They’ll be looking for roughly 20 people on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\nThe movie stars John Candy’s son, Chris in his first motion picture role and some other great talent as well. They’ll be filming all week and wrapping at the bar on Saturday afternoon."
