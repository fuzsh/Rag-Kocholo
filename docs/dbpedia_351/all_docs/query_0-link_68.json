        "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Cinemark achieved its best opening summer weekend box office of all time just a few days ago. The release of ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ took box offices by storm nationwide, grossing more than $210 million. The film was awarded best July opening ever and best-ever opening for an R-rated film. The consumer interest only goes to show that there is still a desire for the unique experiences only movie theatres can provide. ‘Twisters’, ‘Despicable Me 4′, and ‘Inside Out 2′ have also contributed to an outpouring of interest throughout what has been a busy and successful Summer movie release.\n\nThe weekend also saw Cinemark reach its highest concessions revenue since the COVID pandemic.\n\nStill, theatres need a bit more of a boost, in attempts to recover from the setbacks and adversities created by the pandemic in 2020. Like nearly every industry globally, movie theatres were affected negatively by the world being shut down for the better part of two years.\n\nAs a result, tech companies like Apple and Disney brought the movie viewing experience to home audiences at a much easier and user-friendly way. Streaming services created subscription memberships allowing audiences to view movies right from their living room, without having to pay for the films, just the monthly membership. And in some cases, movies set to premiere in theatres could also be viewed from home, the same day.\n\nThis has contributed to ticket sales remaining down 21 percent since 2020 but the recent success of films this summer, as well as movies the famous studios are set to premiere will continue to make a difference.\n\nCinemark and it’s 500 theatres nationwide would certainly appreciate more box office success, to help increase other economic aspects the big screens drive in like concessions, merchandise, and tourism.\n\nClick here to report a typo."
