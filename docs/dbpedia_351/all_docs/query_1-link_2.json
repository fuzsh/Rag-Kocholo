Blystone and starring Tom Mix, Billie Dove, and Malcolm Waite.[1] Based on a story by Robert Lord, the film is about a ranch foreman who assumes responsibility for the ranch following the owner's death. He also cares for the owner's daughter who is taken to Europe by an aunt. Two year later the woman returns from Europe with her new wealthy fiancée and plans to hold their wedding at the ranch, which the foreman has turned into a successful tourist destination. The foreman's feelings for the woman have not been diminished by the years, and after learning some damaging information about the fiancée, the foreman must find a way to stop the wedding.[1]\n\nA print is preserved at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.[2][3]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the death of the owner of the Hunt ranch, foreman Tom Foster (Tom Mix) assumes responsibility for the property, taking also into his care Eleanor Hunt (Billie Dove), the beautiful daughter of the late owner. Although he falls in love with the girl, Tom is too diffident to express his feelings and propose marriage. Soon after, Eleanor is asked to accompany her aunt to Europe.\n\nTwo years later, Eleanor returns from Europe with condescending airs, accompanied by Denman (Malcolm Waite), her wealthy European fiancée. Eleanor announces that she plans to hold the wedding at the ranch, which has been renovated by Tom and transformed into a successful tourist destination. Tom's friend, Mack (J. Farrell MacDonald), tells Tom about the rakish exploits of Don Juan, hoping to instill in him a bit of romance.\n\nWanting to eliminate any competition, Denman instructs his men to kidnap Tom and keep him prisoner until after the wedding. Tom is knocked on the head and dreams that he is the fabled Juan, fighting like a lion for love. When he wakes up, Tom frees himself from his bonds and rides back to the ranch, where he arrives just in time to prevent the wedding. Afterwards, Tom and Eleanor are married.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nTom Mix as Tom Foster\n\nBillie Dove as Eleanor Hunt\n\nMalcolm Waite as Denman\n\nJ.

As Don Juan, Tom awards the prize for beauty to Elvira Hunt, who appears as a charming Spanish girl. After fighting off and routing his enemies by leaping to a chandelier and then lunging across the great hall, Tom says to the girl, \"Come, fair Eleanor; forget that despoiler, as you are mine.\" She replies, \"Oh, Don Juan, you are a man. But will they take me from you?\" Hall concluded:\n\nAnybody who has studied Tom Mix as a hero in films knows how impossible things are made for his enemies, and that if he, as a modern Adonis wrapped in antiques, wants the girl, no one will say him nay. True he needs the assistance of Tony in some of the chapters, but that matters not. In this story one perceives Tony with a rope tied to the pommel of his saddle hoisting his magnificent master to the turrets of the castle. Once there Don Juan has to fight single-handed more persons than one can count. There are plenty of surprises in this film, and the staging of the scenes is at times quite impressive ... Here is a picture which races along without a jolt—so far as the story is concerned—and one which is a most agreeable entertainment. Ann Pennington, in the rôle of a court dancer, is delightful. Miss Dove is effective as the heroine, and J. Farrell MacDonald of \"Iron Horsé\" furnishes the light comedy.[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nTom Mix filmography\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
