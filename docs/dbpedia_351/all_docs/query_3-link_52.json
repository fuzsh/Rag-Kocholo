        "meta_description": "Going home for summer break, baring the bad news of losing her scholarship, Samantha is forced to face her militant father, retired Sergeant Major Angelo Moreno. In an attempt to regain her funding for school, Angelo convinces his daughter to compete in a high stakes, underground game of horseshoes. During training, Samantha's attitude quickly descends towards failure until discovering her father's current medical condition. Working her way to the top, Samantha battles uphill until facing the current champion, King Lewy, in a final game to determine who will win the $50,000 and be named champion.",

        "text": "This movie has a real “contemporary” feel to it and makes a statement for the Christian faith. The film builds towards an exciting climax in which the viewer will be rooting for Samantha Moreno, a young woman who overcomes a significant storm in her life to battle for a major cash prize in order to be able to continue to attend college.\n\nHer father, Sergeant Major Angelo Moreno, adds some comic relief as the hard and tough military man who trains her, yet he’s the kind of man who has soft cream filling inside his tough exterior. He also faces a major drama in his life as he fights for his very life due to a serious blood clot. Moreno calls his daughter “turd” a lot, which he says stands for “trainee under rigorous development”! His top rule he tells his daughter to remember is to “Put Jesus first”.\n\nThe viewer will root for Samantha who winds up in a major horse shoe contest, pitching shoes for a chance to win a $50,000 cash prize. But some major competition stands in her way, including the current champion, King Lewy, who not only is very good but he just happens to know it.\n\nYou and your family will find yourself rooting for Samantha as you watch this family film together. We do want to note that a conservative character refers to “sissy liberals, no respect, morals, or ethics” and that one phrase that is used a couple of times is “P*ss on ’em”. This film does develop the theme that hard work and faith pays off. We are pleased to award the movie our Dove “Family-Approved” Seal for ages twelve plus."
