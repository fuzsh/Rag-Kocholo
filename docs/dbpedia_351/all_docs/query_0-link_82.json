        "text": "Set in the West\n\nThere are lots of films and television series that are filmed in the American West in general, and Southern Utah in particular. Weâve compiled this list here if you want to read about some of the most well-known examples. And there is this list from IMDb that is even more comprehensive. (Southern Utah has even been the setting for a few video games â see our blog post on the real-life locations in Horizon: Zero Dawn.)\n\nBut weâve never written about an animated film before. And it just so happens that the 2002 DreamWorks Animation horse movie Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron casts Southern Utah, and the American West, as an integral part of the filmâs story. So letâs look at the real locations the filmmakers used to tell their story.\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nThe Opening Flyover Scene\n\nWeâve got three locations just in the opening moments of the film!\n\nThe Grand Canyon in Arizona\n\nMonument Valley on the Utah/Arizona border\n\nRainbow Bridge in Southern Utah\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nHome Land\n\nSpiritâs home is located in the Grand Tetons in Montana. This where we see him grow up, and where he returns after his adventures.\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nDesert Fort\n\nThe army fort is a little bit tricky to place. But based on some of the monoliths in the background, we think weâre back in Monument Valley. What do you think?\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nNative American Camp\n\nThis one is easy! Itâs located in (what is now) Yosemite National Park in California! Yosemite became a national park in 1890, so only a few years after this movie’s story takes place.\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nRailroad Scene\n\nThe railroad was a big deal in the 1860s, when this movie is set. The Central Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad met to form the transcontinental railway in Northern Utah on May 10, 1869. Today there is a monument to honor that historic achievement at Golden Spike National Historical Park.\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nChase Scene in Bryce Canyon\n\nThe climactic chase sequence toward the end of the film take place in Bryce Canyon National Park in Southern Utah. (But there isnât actually a large canyon in the park to cinematically leap over, unfortunately.)\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nCreative Liberties\n\nItâs probably worth noting, in case you aren’t familiar with the general geography of the American West, that these locations are not close to each other. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron prioritizes the setting and feeling of each location to help convey the emotions of the characters – not the logical, real world distances between the set pieces. And thatâs okay. It helps paint a picture of all the stunning places that you can find out here in the West."
