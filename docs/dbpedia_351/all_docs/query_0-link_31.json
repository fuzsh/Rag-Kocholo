        "text": "Director Mitchell Smith's short feature looks at a marginalized environmental crisis on the Jersey shores that impacts the birding community at large and also points out the eco-holistic idea that life on Earth is poignantly interconnected. All it takes is one stupid, rapacious, self-destructive species to ruin a little-noted part of our planet and a cascade effect can follow.\n\nExample: the horseshoe crab, a fascinating, ancient but homely aquatic invertebrate (more akin to spiders than true crabs) swarms and breeds in mass quantities on the Eastern seaboard. It is not a restaurant delicacy, but when industrially processed (the grinding-up process not shown on camera) crabs can be sold as bait for fishâ€”which humans do consume, of course.\n\nWhen horseshoe crabs were found to be worth dollars, a vast \"mining\" (\"harvesting\" just isn't strong enough a word, says an interviewee) of the animals took place along Delaware Bay, severely depleting their once-apparently-limitless numbers. Other fauna that depended on horseshoe crabs for their own sustenance also suffered, especially an endangered seabird called the red knot, which feeds on crab eggs. The material goes into edu-taing detail about the intricate cannon-fired netting and evolution of high-tech tagging that help scientists keep track of these rare birds and estimate their dwindling numbers.\n\nThough the economics and public-policy side of the controversy gets less attention than one might hope from an expose, the film is particularly close to the personalities of passionate biologists, wildlife preservationists, academics, and ornithologists monitoring this situation over the years. Quite camera-friendly and effusive is Englishman Clive Minton, who died while Smith was in post-production; Horseshoe Crab Moon is dedicated to him.\n\nWhat public library shelves would this title be on?\n\nNature, ocean life, and ornithology are key nesting sites. Any collections in which Delaware Bay is home territory should also take note.\n\nWhat academic subjects would this film be suitable for?\n\nA wide net of Earth Science, Marine Biology, Ornithology, Sustainability, and Environmentalism-oriented courses can benefit from the lesson.\n\nWhat type of classroom would this documentary resource be suitable for?\n\nDespite a smattering of foul (and fowl) language, viewership should be considered junior-high level up to college. In addition to the lyrical filmmaking, a run time of just under an hour makes this a particularly recommended classroom addition. One wishes Clive Minton had left behind a more extensive filmography.\n\nDoes this documentary have Public Performance Rights?\n\nHorseshoe Crab Moon has streaming & DVD with performance rights for universities: $295. Lower pricing for smaller schools and public libraries is also available."
