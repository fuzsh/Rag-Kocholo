        "text": "Usually wore a raincoat, beat-up top hat and a curly orange wig. Rarely spoke in his roles and never in films with his brothers. He would use pantomime and often had a bike horn to communicate with. He often had a scene where he would play a harp with great skill.\n\nAt the beginning of the film Die Marx Brothers auf See (1931), The Marx Brothers, playing ship's stowaways concealed in barrels, are first introduced harmonizing unseen, singing the popular song \"Sweet Adeline.\" And although he cannot be seen, this musical performance marks the only time during one of The Marx Brothers' movie that Harpo's voice -- a clear and pleasant baritone -- is ever heard.\n\nGroucho Marx gave this reason for Harpo's silence: Once, while playing a theater in Winnipeg, Manitoba, during a vaudeville tour, The Marx Brothers had a disagreement with the theater's manager regarding their pay. At the end of The Marx Brothers' engagement there, the manager paid them the amount they had demanded...in several large sacks containing the proper amount in the form of pennies, nickels, and dimes. Since the brothers' train was departing in ten minutes, the brothers had no choice except to lug the sacks onto the train with them. As the train departed, Harpo shouted to the manager, \"I hope your theater burns to the ground.\" And that night, it did. Groucho always said that Harpo's voice was like the axe hanging on the backstage wall of every theater: To be used only in case of emergencies.\n\nOnce crashed a Hollywood costume party at the home of Marion Davies, dressed as Kaiser Wilhelm II. He had to hitchhike to get home and ended up being arrested by Beverly Hills police on charges of vagrancy, illegal entry, escaping from jail in Gloversville, New York, impersonating Kaiser Wilhelm II, and impersonating Harpo Marx.\n\nWhen he taught himself to play the harp, he later learned that he played it the wrong way. However, when he became famous and wealthy, he on occasion throughout his career, took harp lessons from various harpists and music teachers in both New York City and Los Angeles to better increase his skill. However, due to his natural born talent, many musicians and music teachers ended up approaching him to learn his method of harp playing. One mentor whom Harpo truly appreciated was Mildred Dilling, who not only took the time to instruct him in the proper techniques but he would regularly consult her when he was having difficulty with a particular composition.\n\nIf things get too much for you and you feel the whole world's against you, go stand on your head. If you can think of anything crazier to do, do it."
