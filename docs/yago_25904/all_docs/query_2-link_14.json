He met Minnie in New York where he was working as a dance teacher. They married in 1884 and had six sons. Their first son, Manfred, born 1885, died in infancy. The other children were born in 1887, Leonard (Chico); 1888, Adolph (Harpo); 1890, Julius (Groucho); 1892, Milton (Gummo) and 1901, Herbert (Zeppo). Marx was an excellent pinochle player, a game he taught to his two oldest sons.\n\nMarx became a tailor, although not a very good one. He was a talented cook, often convincing the landlord to delay their rent paytime with a good meal.\n\nMarx made a cameo appearance in his four sons' film Monkey Business (1931), sitting on top of luggage behind the brothers on the pier as they wave to the First Officer, having slipped off the ship without being arrested as stowaways.\n\nSam Marx died in Los Angeles, California on 10 May 1933 from complications due to renal failure, aged 73.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nparent->child relationship with Marx, Chico (born 22 March 1887)\n\nparent->child relationship with Marx, Groucho (born 2 October 1890)\n\nparent->child relationship with Marx, Harpo (born 23 November 1888)\n\nEvents\n\nRelationship : Marriage 1884 (Minnie Schönberg)\n\nDeath by Disease 10 May 1933 (Renal failure, age 73)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nSource Notes\n\nSy Scholfield quotes birth certificate n° 71, found online [1], copy on file.\n\nCategories\n\nFamily : Relationship : Number of Marriages (One)\n\nFamily : Parenting : Kids more than 3 (Six sons)\n\nLifestyle : Social Life : Hobbies, games (Pinochle, cooking)\n\nPersonal : Death : Illness/ Disease (Renal failure)\n\nVocation : Entertain/Music : Dancer/ Teacher (Dance teacher)"
