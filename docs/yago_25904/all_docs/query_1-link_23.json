        "text": "Groucho Marx, born Julius Henry Marx, was an American comedian, most known for his role as one of the Marx Brothers, a stage and film-based comedy act from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Groucho's signature black-paint-mustache and eyebrows make him perhaps the most iconic of the Marx Brothers, as well as his constant sarcasm and deadpan delivery. He played a main role in each of the Marx Brothers films and influenced a series of comedians and characters over the years; notably, Bugs Bunny.\n\nOrigin of Stage Name[]\n\nThe stage names of the brothers (except Zeppo) were coined in 1915 by monologist Art Fisher during a poker game in Galesburg, Illinois, based both on the brothers' personalities and Gus Mager's Sherlocko the Monk, a popular comic strip of the day that included a supporting character named \"Groucho\". As Fisher dealt each brother a card, he addressed them, for the very first time, by the names they kept for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe reason that Julius was named Groucho is perhaps the most disputed. There are three explanations:\n\nJulius's temperament: Maxine, Chico's daughter and Groucho's niece, said in the documentary The Unknown Marx Brothers that Julius was named \"Groucho\" simply because he was grouchy most or all of the time. Robert B. Weide, a director known for his knowledge of Marx Brothers history, said in Remarks On Marx (a documentary short included with the DVD of A Night at the Opera) that, among the competing explanations, he found this one to be the most believable. Steve Allen said in Funny People that the name made no sense; Groucho might have been impudent and impertinent, but not grouchy—at least not around Allen. However, at the very end of his life, Groucho finally admitted that Fisher had named him Groucho because he was the \"moody one\".\n\nThe grouch bag: This explanation appears in Harpo's biography; it was voiced by Chico in a TV appearance included on The Unknown Marx Brothers; and it was offered by George Fenneman, Groucho's sidekick on his TV game show You Bet Your Life. A grouch bag was a small drawstring bag worn around the neck in which a traveler could keep money and other valuables so that it would be very difficult for anyone to steal them. Most of Groucho's friends and associates stated that Groucho was extremely stingy, especially after losing all his money in the 1929 stock market crash, so naming him for the grouch bag may have been a comment on this trait. Groucho insisted that this was not the case in chapter six of his first autobiography:\n\nI kept my money in a 'grouch bag'. This was a small chamois bag that actors used to wear around their neck to keep other hungry actors from pinching their dough. Naturally, you're going to think that's where I got my name from. But that's not so. Grouch bags were worn on manly chests long before there was a Groucho.\n\nGroucho's explanation: Groucho himself insisted that he was named for a character in the comic strip Knocko the Monk, which inspired the craze for nicknames ending in \"o\"; in fact, there was a character in that strip named \"Groucho\". However, he is the only Marx or Marx associate who defended this theory, and as he is not an unbiased witness, few biographers take the claim seriously.\n\nGroucho himself was no help on this point; he was discussing the Brothers' names during his Carnegie Hall concert, and he said of his own, \"My name, of course, I never did understand.\" He goes on to mention the possibility that he was named after his unemployed uncle Julius, who lived with his family. The family believed that he was a rich uncle hiding a fortune, and Groucho claimed that he may have been named after him by the family trying to get into the will. \"And he finally died, and he left us his will, and in that will he left three razor blades, an 8-ball, a celluloid dicky, and he owed my father $85 beside.\"\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nMarx's three marriages ended in divorce. His first wife was chorus girl Ruth Johnson (m. 1920-1942). He was 29 and she was 19 at the time of their wedding. The couple had two children, Arthur Marx and Miriam Marx. His second wife was Kay Marvis (m. 1945–1951), née Catherine Dittig, former wife of Leo Gorcey. Marx was 54 and Kay was 21 at the time of their marriage. They had a daughter, Melinda Marx. His third wife was actress Eden Hartford (m. 1954-1969). He was 64 and she was 24 at the time of their wedding.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Marx described his perfect woman: \"Someone who looks like Marilyn Monroe and talks like George S. Kaufman.\"\n\nGroucho the Author[]\n\nBooks by Groucho Marx:"
