        "text": "Murder Hollywood Style: Who Killed Jean Harlow's Husband? by Samuel Marx\n\nPaul Bern was married to the world's leading sex-symbol, Jean Harlow, and was a top MGM producer. When his body was found early on the morning of 5th September 1932 in Benedict Canyon, South California, a frantic cover-up had been so artfully structured that it was all in place before the police were allowed to arrive - seven hours later. Everything seemed to point to suicide. Samuel Marx worked with both Benn and Harlow. He has always been convinced that Benn could not have committed suicide, and in this Hollywood expose he sets out to reconstruct the true events of the case. The book offers evidence pointing to murder, and incorporates a cast of characters ranging from Lois B. Mayer to F.Scott Fitzgerald."
