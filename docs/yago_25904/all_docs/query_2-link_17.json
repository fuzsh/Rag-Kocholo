        "meta_description": "Samuel Marx and Joyce Vanderveen discuss their book, “Deadly Illusions.”  Marx begins by explaining that the book began when he started asking questions about the apparent suicide of his friend Paul Bern.  At the time of his death Bern was married to MGM star Jean Harlow, and MGM studios kept the details of Bern’s death a secret because they didn’t want bad press.  Vanderveen talks about how she became interested in the case because she argues that Bern had no motivation for suicide.  Marx discusses how Bern had been keeping another lover in New York, and she was probably the one who shot him in the head.  They end the interview by describing how a large movie studio could influence the media, public, and law officers, and be able to cover up a murder.",
