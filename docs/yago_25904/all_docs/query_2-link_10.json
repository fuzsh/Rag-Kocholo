        "text": "Marx began a private practice in 1909; he lived in Chicago c. 1949 and worked for the firm, Friedman, Alschuler and Sincere; Marx achieved some acclaim as a painter and furniture designer, as well as an architect; Marx became a sought-after designer for high-society entertainment spots, such as The Pump Room in the Conrad Hilton Hotel, Chicago, IL, and the Pierre Grille, New York, NY. Work at the Pierre Hotel in New York came from his friend, the oil man, J. Paul Getty (1892-1976) who owned the establishment.\n\nFellow, American Institute of Architects (FAIA);\n\nMarx married several times. His third wife, Florene May, was a member of the May Company Department Store family; through her, he worked (in association with A.C. Martin, Sr.) on the commission for the huge May Company Department Store on the Miracle Mile in Los Angeles, CA (1940).\n\nMarx had an genial, understated and erudite manner, characteristics that enabled him to fit into high society; these connections allowed him to design the New Orleans Museum of Art, New Orleans, LA, for example and many large residences. He connected with wealthy businessmen, aristocrats and movie stars. He also strode in the company of architecture's elite; he maintained a friendship with Chicago-transplant Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, for example, and attended American Institute of Architects annual conferences where he socialized with organization officers. In 1946, Marx was a Registered Democrat."
