        "text": "Author: Gabrielle Zevin\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nWhen Sam and Sadie first meet in the hospital, they bond over their mutual love for video games. Years later, their paths cross again and they become partners, keen to develop games of their own.\n\nSpoilers ahead.\n\nDetailed Summary\n\nSadie Green and Samson “Sam” Masur meet in the hospital. Sadie is 11 and in the hospital because Alice, her older sister, is getting chemotherapy for cancer. Sam, 12, was in a car accident that killed his mother Anna Lee. Sam hadn’t spoken to anyone in the hospital until he and Sadie talked about video games and became instant friends. Sadie gets her time spent with Sam signed off as community hours. When Sam learns of this, he stops talking to her. In 1996, in Boston, Sam sees Sadie at a subway station. He is studying at Harvard while Sadie studies at MIT. Sadie gives Sam a video game she developed and he realises she’s incredibly talented. He suggests they make a video game together. Sadie dates her college professor, a reputed game designer named Dov. Dov later reveals that he has a wife and son in Israel who he wants to patch things with, so they need to break up. Sadie becomes depressed (it’s later revealed she had to get an abortion) and Sam knocks on her door every day until they can make a video game together. Sam lives with his friend Marx, the best friend anyone could ask for. Marx agrees to let Sadie stay in their flat over the summer so they can work on a game together. Sam is half-Korean, half-Jewish and his mother was a struggling actress. They moved from New York to Los Angeles because a woman (named Anne Lee) committed suicide right in front of them (she jumped off a building). Sam’s father George Masur doesn’t really want much to do with him so Sam is brought up by his grandparents, Dong Hyun and Bong Cha Lee. Sadie is white, Jewish and from a wealthy family but she’s often overlooked in the industry because she’s a woman. Sam and Sadie work on Ichigo and it’s a big success. Marx becomes the producer of their game (he’s part Japanese, from a rich family and almost a playboy but really nice about it). Sadie and Dov continue their relationship. Sadie and Sam have a few arguments and Sadie thinks Sam is taking credit for all her work. Sam needs an urgent amputation for his foot and Sadie’s relationship with Dov isn’t the healthiest. Marx almost tricks them into moving to California for the other where they set up the Unfair Games office (the name of their company). Sam struggles with phantom limb syndrome, pain and loneliness.\n\nSadie and Marx fall in love, much to Sam’s chagrin. They release Counterpart High and Mapleworld (one of their games flopped big time so they salvaged it into Mapleworld). Sam reinvents his personality and persona, renaming himself Mazer and being vocal about his liberal views e.g., Mapleworld allows for same-sex couples to marry. Sam accepts Marx and Sadie’s relationship and he and Sadie go promote their new game. Two gunmen storm into the Unfair Games office and shoot Marx who was trying to protect an employee. Marx dies in hospital after several weeks. Sadie and Sam are both devastated. Sadie gives birth to her and Marx’s child, Naomi Watanabe Green, and withdraws from everyone. Sam does his best to manage the company thinking about what Marx would have done. He designs and launches a game specifically made for Sadie based on The Oregon Trail. His and Sadie’s characters end up in a platonic marriage in the game and Sadie realises she’s been playing with Sam and cuts all ties and moves to Boston where she teaches Dov’s class. Sadie deals better with the grief and, upon learning of Dong Hyun’s death, attends his funeral. After five years, Sadie and Sam finally meet about a business pitch. After, Sam tells Sadie he always thought she hadn’t asked him out because he was Asian and disabled. She tells him she didn’t want to lose what they had by making things romantic. They play video games together and Sadie hands him an idea for what they can work on next when she’s in line for her flight at the airport.\n\nReview\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a celebration of gaming culture; almost like the Beartown (more on this later) of gaming. It’s also a book I was avoiding for ages because I knew it was about video games and let’s just say I’m not the biggest fan. Nevertheless, I was absolutely blown away by how accessible this book was for a non-gamer like me. Under different circumstances (i.e., not revising for my horrendous exams–please take time out of your schedule to pray that I’ll pass, thank you in advance), I just KNOW I would have devoured this book in a day or two. The writing was rich and beautiful, the plot was far more layered than I had anticipated it being and the characters–my GOD, the characters were everything!\n\nI’ve always had an appreciation for video game designers, sort of paying respect to them from a distance. I’ve tried numerous times to get into gaming (without actually gaming lol) and while I find the lore and worldbuilding fascinating, I accepted long ago that it was a passion I would never truly have. This book has definitely helped close that respectful distance a little, and I did feel so much for all the designers. It really is so hard to come up with a hit, and there’s so much bullshit you have to put up with. I could totally understand Sadie’s frustrations. As someone who loathes the public spotlight, I understood why she didn’t want to be a part of the publicity tour; yet it’s so invalidating when credit isn’t given where it’s due. Being a woman in the gaming industry (in the 90s at least) must have also been awfully tough. Sam was also someone I empathised with a lot. Gaming was his outlet and the one thing he enjoyed in life, given all the trauma he had experienced. I could also relate to his profound loneliness and jealousy for what Sadie and Marx had. I wanted to give him a massive hug multiple times during the book. I admired him for trying to take over the reins after Marx’s death.\n\nSam and Sadie’s relationship was an interesting one to watch unfold. As a third party, I was so frustrated at how little they communicated with each other about what they wanted and needed. However, I loved that Zevin emphasised that not every platonic relationship has to evolve into a romantic one, and sometimes, it’s nicer to just be really good friends with someone.\n\nAnd MARX!!! He was my favourite! The kind of friend I want and simultaneously aspire to be. His uncanny ability to know what people wanted before they themselves knew, the depth and breadth of his love for everyone in his life, anticipating everyone’s needs before they voiced them–what was there not to love?! I knew he and Sadie would get together. I was hoping the three of them would remain platonic but I guess there had to be one couple. I didn’t think he would die, I was so certain that there would be a massive falling out between him, Sadie and Sam, and I braced myself for it. But I DIDN’T THINK HE WOULD DIE!!! Ugh.\n\nI was surprised by how many different perspectives this book included. The first half was relatively tight, only switching between Sadie and Sam’s perspectives with one or two chapters from Marx’s POV. It wasn’t until the second half of the book that there were more characters involved. That’s why I felt there was a Beartown-esque quality to this book. It’s definitely a writing style that I have attempted to emulate with no success so I was impressed at how well Zevin wove all that in. I loved the slice-of-life aspect of this book. I appreciated that the characters had significant low points too rather than this book being the story of two prodigies having continual success (though I suppose that doesn’t really make for much of a story, does it?).\n\nDefinitely keen to read more of Zevin’s works!"
