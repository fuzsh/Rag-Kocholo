        "text": "While trying to implement LPA* (mostly based on its description in the same authors’ paper on its derivative D*Lite), I noticed it mentions predecessors and successors of a vertex without giving a full explanation.\n\nI understand that $Pred(u)$ is the set of all vertices from which an edge leads towards $u$, and $Succ(u)$ is the set of all vertices towards which an edge leads from $u$. Predecessors and successors must be immediate neighbors (thus e.g. a predecessor of a predecessor of $u$ is not necessarily a predecessor of $u$).\n\nIn practice, however, it is quite common to have edges that are not directional, i.e. can be traversed both ways (which is equivalent to the same two nodes being connected by two antiparallel directional edges). I infer that for two vertices $u$ and $v$ connected in this way, $u$ would be both a predecessor and a successor of $v$ (and vice versa). In other words, $Pred(u) \\cap Succ(u)$ is not necessarily empty.\n\nAm I correct to assume that predecessor and successor are defined only by the existence of an edge traversable in a given direction, and are specifically not related to start cost?"
