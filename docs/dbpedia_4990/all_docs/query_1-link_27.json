        "text": "Re: Too powerful ?\n\nYup, what you said. I was a fan of the Note series, had a Note #1, #3 and #4 and I was sweating the #4 until it finally died. I thought about a new Note, but they lost features I liked (the IR blaster was one) so I thought if I had to live without that why not shop around, and the one feature I really wanted to keep was the stylus, so I ended up with a Moto G Pro Stylus, for ~Â£200, and well, it's a phone. it does phone stuff, it does it well enough I don't think about it. I just can't justify flagship prices,.... I'd rather spend the grand I've saved on building materials for a geodesic dome,... I just have to sell the idea to my other half, although I'm sure she'll like sitting in it with a G&T.\n\nRe: Shrugâ€¦.\n\nCame here to say something similar. Apart from a Fairphone (which is expensive partly for reasons other than being \"flagship\") I've never bought a phone more expensive than about Â£160* until last week when I bought a second-hand phone at Â£300 which originally had a price tag of around Â£700 I think.\n\nThere is very, very little to choose between my expensive phone and the cheaper ones. It has a slightly better camera setup (a fixed 5x zoom for example) but for general use I'm all \"meh\".\n\nThere may be certain use-cases for ultra fast processors, ultra high-resolution screens, ultra-megapixel cameras, but if I want a mini laptop I'd rather shell out for something from Planet Computers which has a keyboard, or (if they can sort the software out) a Pinephone with a snap-on keyboard back which also happens to double the battery capacity.\n\nI'm bloomin' nervous even carrying a second-hand phone around given how often I tend to drop the things. The Pinephone and the Fairphone both have reasonably-priced and user-fittable spare parts. My last phone did me for just over 9 years (could really have replaced it from about year 7 onwards but didn't have the cash back then) so we'll see how this one gets on...\n\nM.\n\n*I don't buy a lot of phones for myself (hence the 9-year-old one), but family do tend to ask me to buy for them, so in the last five or six years I've bought and set up six (I think) smart phones (that's not counting the non-smart phones), one of which was a Fairphone but the others all under Â£160 IIRC. Given that many of these people are teenagers who tend to hammer their phones (though they're not into gaming other than a bit of Super Tux Kart) I've had absolutely no complaints about storage capacity, camera quality, device speed, battery life or any of the other things (\"do my mates think it's ok?\") that are supposedly \"better\" the more you pay for a phone.\n\nFormer Palm Stylus User\n\nI've run a Note 8 the last 3 years & had been looking for a reasonable price for the Note 20 Ultra (Which I got recently as New Old Stock) as I didnt fancy (or (justifiably) afford) the latest & greatest, I jumped off the merry-go-round of free upgrades\\contract renewals a few years back, especially when the phone contract prices went up & a purchase fee for the phone added.\n\nI'm staying with my corporate rate deal for $50 per month 25Gb Data 5G US\\Canada calling.\n\nIts nice to actually start receiving updates again & generally its more \"useable\" than the 8 & got it doing a few things that I'd never quite got around to with the old, like automatic hotspotting for my trucks Android head unit, mainly thanks to both the old Note & The Truck keeping the mobile hotspot going all the time & it also plays nice with the wireless charger in the truck, something the 8 rarely did.\n\nIt is annoying that the stylus port is on the wrong side compared to the old unit.\n\nI still keep the 8 to hand as its a handy 2FA backup for work.\n\nLong story short:\n\nI too am one of those that prefer's to use a stylus especially with fat fingers\\half dead hand these days, as long as it's got a stylus Samsung will have a customer (Only other contender in that is Motorola & getting Otterbox cases for them is potentially problematic).\n\nRe: What's it like for making actual phone calls?\n\nI have not used this, but I am still confident that I can answer your question: it's fine. I've used a bunch of phones in recent years, from my own devices to work ones and ones I set up for friends or family. Some iPhones, some Android, one KaiOS, and one feature phone. While some people don't make phone calls often, I am not one of them, so I've made calls on most devices. They are all basically fine.\n\nWhile some may disagree that making phone calls is the \"main purpose for a phone\" nowadays, what's much less questioned is that phone calls are a pretty basic feature. It's using well-tested protocols and, if the phone can't manage a call, it's going to have problems with the other services that people who don't use the calls will notice. Unless you need something unusual, it's going to handle your calling needs fine. Of course, if calls are your primary use case for a phone, you might be better off buying an incredibly cheap device which will also manage calls just fine, since the extra money on this ridiculously expensive device is likely not to benefit you.\n\nRe: Overkill\n\nMy Galaxy S9+ was sometimes a very good phone. Samsung would occasionally kill off some major feature with a bug and not fix it until whenever they felt like rolling out another security update. There were a couple of months where it had an unstable signal, a few months where WiFi cycled constantly, and I finally quit using after a couple of months with intermittent GPS.\n\nSo the big question is: Can you unlock the bootloader?\n\nAndroid really is a mess. It started out as a way to have a flexible and powerful computer in your pocket but now Google wants to dumb it down to sell more cloud crap. A few updates past made Google Drive the only backup option for Android phones. Today I found out that those backups are impossible to restore without a Google Pixel phone. Google Support said it's not a bug; it's a feature.\n\nIt feels nice when your phone reaches that age when you can install LineageOS on it. Enable ADB shell as root. Do magic."
