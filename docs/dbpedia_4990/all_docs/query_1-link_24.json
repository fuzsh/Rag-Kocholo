The original Samsung Galaxy S was met with great acclaim. Critics have given positive reviews positing that the smart phone was at-par with...\n\nPage 27 Android-operated device models as well as with Apple Inc.'s iPhone 4. Since then, Samsung Galaxy S devices became part of the fierce competition within the smart phone industry. With the Samsung Galaxy S II, the variants are as follows: i9210 HD LTE...\n\nPage 28 The i9100 (Released last April 2011) The SII Plus i9105 The i9100G As of the first quarter of 2013, there are more than 40 million units that have been shipped. The Galaxy SII was heralded...\n\nPage 29 as 2012's smart phone of the Year Award by the Mobile World Congress' Global Mobile Award. Most reviewers of the Galaxy SII gave it a near perfect and perfect scores, stating that the SII has become a benchmark for the other smart phones in the market. There were...\n\nPage 30 negative criticisms towards the plastic body performance wise, the Galaxy S II was outperforming the other devices that were out in the market. This is one of the Galaxy S devices that has received critical acclaim with the other being the successor, Galaxy S III.\n\nPage 31 With the Samsung Galaxy SII, the variants are as follow: The i9300 (Released last May 2012) Mini VE i8200 i9305 Neo i9300i Mini i8190 Neo i9301i...\n\nPage 32 Slim G3812B Currently, the S III has the most number of model variants. Also, the model has more than 50 million units shipped and can be assumed as the most successful among the rest of the line-up, in terms of shipments.\n\nPage 33 The Samsung Galaxy S III has been highly praised by several critics. Natasha Lomas, from CBET UK, has said that the Galaxy S III is the Ferrari of Android phones. Dave Oliver, from Wired UK, said that the device is a Prince among...\n\nPage 34 Dedezade from Stuff magazine said that the device is the King.

These new additions to the Galaxy S line of smart phones are meant to bring back the glory of that Samsung basked during their...\n\nPage 41 S III generation. As of the date, the Galaxy S6 models are currently met with positive reviews for the innovations that Samsung has implemented. These technological updates and upgrades will discussed in the next chapter. So in this chapter, the various...\n\nPage 42 Samsung Galaxy S smart phone line- ups were briefly discussed. The Samsung Galaxy S devices are at the pricier end of the smart phone spectrum because of its higher-end technologies that incorporated.\n\nPage 43 Chapter 2 The Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge...\n\nPage 44 “The Next is Now” – Galaxy S6 slogan The earliest rumors for the new Samsung Galaxy device started last January 2015. The gossip mill within the World Wide Web was rampant with the upcoming successor of the Galaxy S5.\n\nPage 45 Most of the hushed whispers and speculations were about the curved edge of the upcoming S6 as well as the shift to Samsung's native chipset, the Exynos, rather than the usual Snapdragon Qualcomm. There were also photo leaks and by the time...\n\nPage 46 were no longer such. Aside from the curved edge which was one of the two releases, there was the usual candy bar smart phone variant, the Galaxy S6. The Galaxy S6 Edge's curved screen does not dramatically shift like the Note Edge's and instead of only having one edged side as...\n\nPage 47 The unveiling was last March 1, 2015 at the Mobile World Congress. The event was held in Spain and Samsung Electronics event, Samsung Unpacked. Those who were part of the event had a chance...\n\nPage 48 Galaxy S line up. It was then officially revealed that the next in line for the Samsung Galaxy S series are the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Although it was not much of a surprise by then. As per...\n\nPage 49 Android version which is 5.0, Android Lollipop. Aside from the partnership with Goggle which means the usual pre-loaded applications such as the Play Store, Goggle Play Music and Goggle Chrome, Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge have...\n\nPage 50 Microsoft applications such as Skype and One Drive. Samsung is giving free 115 GB worth of storage with the Microsoft One Drive cloud storage for two years. This free storage can compensate greatly for the lack of external memory...\n\nPage 51 The staple, TouchWiz, Samsung Electronics' proprietary User Interface (UI), will run on top of Lollipop. However, unlike the predecessors which contained several bloat ware and unwanted applications, the current TouchWiz has been streamlined. The UI has also...\n\nPage 52 Samsung and the public's reception towards it is more than appreciative of this. As of today, these new flagship models of Samsung...\n\nPage 53 are receiving positive reviews. Why is that? The S6 models, as mentioned, are successors to the previous Galaxy S5 and retain the tradition of bar styled multi- touch screen interface, yet the excitement was palpable. Despite the traditional physical appearance...\n\nPage 54 Samsung is giving the new devices a fresh look. Samsung Electronics has made a move to veer away from their usual plastic physical make-up and opted from a matte aluminum alloy frame. The move to metallic frames of Samsung is not...\n\nPage 55 new. This started with the Galaxy Note 4 and the Galaxy S series, a mid-range brand of smart phones. The Corning Gorilla Glass 4 is also implemented on the front and the back of the Galaxy S6 models. The new physical appearance gives a pleasing aesthetic value to the device.\n\nPage 56 This change was highly praised by the early critics of the device. Samsung is setting the bar of having both front and back portions of smart phones be protected against scratches through implementation Corning Gorilla Glass technology.\n\nPage 57 The Galaxy S6 models are being equipped with the capacity for wireless charging and as well as fast charging. These changes are deemed as a significant move because it allows for the wireless charging of the mobile devices to be possible and more efficient due to the...\n\nPage 58 Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. The company claims that it will only take one and a half hour to fully charge the device from 0 to 100. Samsung has said that they are also selling their own brand of wireless chargers but the Galaxy S6 wireless...\n\nPage 59 charging ability will also work with other brands of wireless chargers. They are compliant to the wireless charging standards of Qi and Matter Powers Alliance. This ensures consumers that the wireless charging of the Galaxy S6 models are state of the art and stable.\n\nPage 60 In line with the Samsung devices wireless charging, there are news that the company is teaming up with IKEA to integrate into furniture the capacity for wireless charging. These new implementations are not only the latest additions. According...\n\nPage 61 Samsung, the company has raised the bar of the quality of the cameras of the new models. The new back or rear-facing camera is said to perform better under low lighting conditions compared to the rear-facing camera of the S5. The rear-facing camera is at...\n\nPage 62 16 MP and has similar specifications with Galaxy Note 4. The camera is accompanied by a LED flash. The front camera also receives an upgrade and a nice one too. From the usual 2 MP front cameras of the Galaxy S smart phones, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge's...\n\nPage 63 front camera gets a 5 MP bump. To date, this is one of the highest MP available for front cameras within its competitors. The back-end camera of the Galaxy S6 has similar image sensor as the Galaxy note 4, meaning that it has a built-in optical image stabilization.\n\nPage 64 The real-time HDR is also present. The camera also has auto focus on object tracking and with the aid of the infrared that is responsible for the heart rate sensor, there is white balance calibration integrated. Those who have a shaky grip will no longer worry because the Galaxy S6...\n\nPage 65 Edge also has the same capabilities. Samsung claims that the camera upgrades will allow for a better low-light performance. Another noteworthy upgrade is the inclusion of Samsung Pay. Last February 2015, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd was able to acquire LoopPay.\n\nPage 66 Through the acquisition, Samsung integrated mobile payments system that was developed from LoopPay's intellectual property. Samsung Pay works with at least 90% of the point-of-sale units within the United States. According to LoopPay, the mobile payment...\n\nPage 67 This means that LoopPay's development team has made significant improvements within the mobile payments systems. Samsung Pay will make the...\n\nPage 68: Chapter 1 The\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge will emit an electromagnetic field that will act as a conduit for the transaction.\n\nPage 69: Chapter 2 The Samsung Galaxy S6 And\n\nTransmission, the intellectual property of LoopPay. Aside from this, mobile payments done through Near Field Communication (NFC) also supported. Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are trailblazers among the Samsung mobile devices for this type of upgrade.\n\nPage 70 Owners of these new models will not have to worry about credit card theft because the information is stored in an isolated and secure token. Also, payments need to authenticate via fingerprint scan to make any transaction valid. This brings us to another...\n\nPage 71 S6 models – fingerprint scanner. There have been positive remarks about the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge's fingerprint scanner According to one critic, Anandtech, Samsung's fingerprint scanner is on par with Apple's Touch ID system. Instead of a swipe-...\n\nPage 72 style fingerprint scan which was in the Galaxy S5, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge have a touch-based fingerprint scan. Aside from the initial positive reaction, there have also been concerns that were raised. The common worry was the lack of memory expansion...\n\nPage 73 Unlike the predecessors of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, the current set of devices has removed this particular function. According to Samsung, the lack of a memory expansion slot is to allow for better performance and speed of the devices. The new addition to...\n\nPage 74 Galaxy S line also does not have a removable battery. In response to the lack of an expandable memory slot, Samsung Electronics offering three different internal memory storage capacities: 32 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB. Along with those mentioned,...\n\nPage 75 S6 models are compatible with the Gear VR, Samsung's virtual reality headset. The Gear VR was originally set to work for the Galaxy Note 4 but the new Gear VR, which is being rebranded into Gear VR Innovator Edition for Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge.\n\nPage 76 In this chapter, the upgrades and new inclusions that were incorporated to the S6 models were discussed. There were improvements to the older hardware components as well changes to the infrastructure of the device. Unlike the other members of the Galaxy S line, the S6 and S6 Edge...\n\nPage 77 Samsung phones were well-known for. The new members of the Galaxy S series of smart phones are eliciting positive responses from the public and to some, this device could be, as stated in the previous...\n\nPage 78 chapter, bring back the Galaxy S devices into the top list of smart phones. The specifications of the S6 models will be shortly discussed in greater detail.\n\nPage 79 Chapter 3 Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge Specifications...\n\nPage 80 We previously tackled on the innovations that were implemented by Samsung Electronics into the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge. In this chapter, the hardware specifications of the device will be discussed. These S6 models utilize a nano SIM card compartment...\n\nPage 81 and is LTE ready. The standard inclusions of a WiFi and Bluetooth ready device is also present. As is with the other Galaxy S devices, the S6models have the usual home button at the facade of the device while the power and volume buttons are at the side. However the...\n\nPage 82: Galaxy S6 Edge\n\nplacement of the SIM card slots vary between the two devices. For the Galaxy S6, the nano SIM card slot can be found at the side while for Galaxy S6 Edge, it can be found at the upper portion. The S6 models sport a bigger size than any predecessors. It has a screen...\n\nPage 83 size of 5.1 inches and the screen display of keeps up with the longstanding use of the Super AMOLED. It has a screen resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels with a density of 577 ppi. This means that the screen has a more vibrant color and critics have said that this currently one of the...\n\nPage 84 To those who have previously owned any of Samsung's high-tiered smart phones, the display screen utilizes Super AMOLED. To those who are new to this term, Super AMOLED was developed by Samsung to address the...\n\nPage 85 AMOLED displays which cannot be seen or difficult to see when under the sunlight. Super AMOLED marketing term by Samsung that differentiates this AMOLED display from others. The company has said that the Super AMOLED has...\n\nPage 86 a digitizer which means that the touch detection has been integrated into the screen instead of having it on top of the screen. The Super AMOLED also reflects one- fifth of the sunlight and the gaps between the layers of screens are minimized. Hence, as mentioned, this...\n\nPage 87 Unlike the previous North American releases of the Galaxy S smart phones that utilized the chipset, Qualcomm Snapdragon, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are using the Samsung Exynos chipset. The company...\n\nPage 88 Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 overheating while being run compared to the Samsung Exynos chipset. Also, the company also opted in favor of the usage of Samsung Exynos for the new Galaxy S smart phones...\n\nPage 89 because it can accommodate the upgrades better. The S6 series has an octa- core CPU running with four 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 and four 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57 and equipped with a RAM of 3.0 GB. These numbers mean that the devices are able to run effectively even if several...\n\nPage 90 applications are run together. For those who are into mobile gaming, this device has promising hardware specifications. Also for those who are heavy phone users, the device can still have a smooth run for prolonged usage. Going outside of the inner...\n\nPage 91 parameters of the S6 models, both devices are similar in size. The S6 Edge (5.6 x 2.8 x 0.28 inches) is infinitesimally bigger than the S6 (5.6 x 2.8 x 0.27 inches) but it is lighter weighing only 4.6 ounces (132 grams) compared to 4.9 ounces (138 grams). These values might seem...\n\nPage 92 Samsung Electronics has said that they are trying to emulate the devices being as close to each other. There are also differences with the batteries. The S6 has 2,550 mAh while the S6 Edge has 2,660 mAh. These values are smaller than the Galaxy...\n\nPage 93 S5 but there are new implementations within the system, particularly chipset and the lowered values could imply better battery efficiency. Although the two S6 models are priding themselves with the wireless charging capacity, the devices can still...\n\nPage 94 USB 2.0 port which can be used to attach the cord to an adapter. The downgrade from Galaxy S5's USB 3.0 port implemented by Samsung to ensure better performance and speed of the device. Also, there is lack of the IP6...\n\nPage 95 S6 models. To reiterate, the downgrades and changes enforced by Samsung to the new line of devices is to improve the S6 and Edge's overall performance and give the consumers best experience...\n\nPage 96 with their devices. In this chapter, the discussion was focused specifications, more on the hardware side of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. To an ordinary consumer, these numbers might just be some mambo jumbo but it was placed here to show that...\n\nPage 97 Samsung has ante what they were previously known for: external memory expansion slot as well as removable battery, for a powerful internal system dedicated to performance and speed. All of the basic components of a smart phone are present...\n\nPage 98 with the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge: WiFi ready, Bluetooth capable, a native Email client, HTML Internet browser, media playback everything else. As well as the S Health, S Voice and other integral applications of the Galaxy S devices are incorporated.\n\nPage 99 The upgrades that Samsung applied focused on the overall aesthetic value making the S6 and S6 Edge look like next generation devices and in line to predominantly glass facet, an efficient wireless charging ability; the camera for better low lighting capture; introduction of Samsung Pay...\n\nPage 100 Exynos chip sets. The S6 models are setting a new bar within the smart phone industry. In general, Samsung is leveling up the competition with introduction of their new flagship product.\n\nPage 101 Chapter 4 Additional Information for S6 Owners and Potential...\n\nPage 102 Owners Navigating through Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge is no different from other smart phones. However, these new models offer a fresh take to the Galaxy S devices. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd is fusing together the...\n\nPage 103 best of their technology and aptly innovating them into their devices. Changes have been present from physical appearance, down to the tiniest parts of the smart phone. Quoting from the first chapter, “smart phones have become integral part to the...\n\nPage 104 lives of millions of human beings.” Before, cellular phones were used primarily for communication through text messages and calls. Today, these cellular phones, aptly named smart phones, are able to do what a desktop computer could do and much more.\n\nPage 105 Recent utilities inside smart phones have the capacity to detect physiological changes such as heartbeats. Health related applications are also in constant development these days; these capabilities alone, surpass what a desktop computer does. The growth of the capabilities...\n\nPage 106 of the smart phone devices are exponential. Perhaps back in the 1900s the technological innovations that are present now were envisioned but not yet deemed as probable, much more, possible. However, 2000s, technological revolution has arrived. Mobile phones were...\n\nPage 107 able to access the Internet, take on multimedia functions such as image capture and video and music playback. These activities were done before with digital cameras and specialized players, respectively. The introduction of the first generation iPhone last 2007...\n\nPage 108 has made an endless horizon of technological revolutions. It paved way to a new wave of mobile phones. Smart phones became a different class of mobile phones all together. Bringing another revolution to the field of technology is the wireless charging...\n\nPage 109 Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge along with the compelling specifications. These models are still at their early stages of introduction to the market. Later into the year, there could be other variants that will return the integration of...\n\nPage 110 waterproofing and other applications that will maximize the hardware capacity of the S6 models. Another noteworthy aspect of the growth of the smart phones is its relationship with virtual reality. Smart phones and virtual reality are slowly moving hand in hand. Most...\n\nPage 111 Gear VR Innovator Edition for Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Owners of these S6 models will most likely receive periodic updates from Samsung for further optimization as it is normal...\n\nPage 112 for manufacturers.
