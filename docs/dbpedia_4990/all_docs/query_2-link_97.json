If the phone is overall more durable and nicer with a decent sized battery then that's totally fine with me also without a removable battery/back piece.\n\nwhistlepig [OP]\n\nDeal Addict\n\n1255 posts\n\n241 upvotes\n\nBurrowborough\n\nWell today is the day!\n\nSamsung launched their S6 and S6 Edge as expected.\n\n[QUOTE]Both sport bodies hewn of aluminum, sandwiched between two layers of Gorilla Glass 4. Both sport 5.1-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screens (more on them later). Both have Samsung's latest octacore chipset thrumming away in them, chipsets that pairs a quad 2.1GHz processor with a Quad 1.5Ghz one. (Oh, and they've both got 3GB of RAM as just for good measure). Both support LTE cat. 6. Both are slated for a global launch on April 10. You get where I'm going with this.

I've been using my old iPhone 4s since my S2 broke. Have to say I like the iPhone 4s in my hand again, feels solid, despite it being so old. I said I wasn't going to to back to Samsung, but might have to rethink. Looks pretty good. Just wondering how the battery will be with that QHD screen\n\nLovable\n\nDeal Addict\n\n4763 posts\n\n387 upvotes\n\nLove how the edge looks! Will be surprising to see what kind of cases they come out with, probably only corner protection for this phone. If it is the same sensor as the Note 4 with the 1.9 aperture... That will be sick.\n\nThe S6 definitely fixes most problems that people with the Note 4 would complain about (low light shots under performing/swipe unlock).\n\nbembol\n\nDeal Expert\n\n19935 posts\n\n3532 upvotes\n\nWoodbridge\n\nhackoder wrote: ↑I really doubt the difference will be only $50.

(The S5 had a 2,800 mAh battery.)\n\n[QUOTE]The Galaxy S6 comes with a 2,550 mAh non-removable battery while the Galaxy S6 Edge comes with a larger 2,600 mAh battery. [/QUOTE]\n\nRemaining unannounced were the storage capacities that each model will be available in. With the removal of the SD card slot there is question what sizes will be available and their respective costs. 16GB? 32GB? 64GB? 128GB?\n\nwhistlepig [OP]\n\nDeal Addict\n\n1255 posts\n\n241 upvotes\n\nBurrowborough\n\nIt's an interesting strategy for Samsung to remove the S6's dustproof and waterproof capabilities. It's a definite positioning move to place the Galaxy line below the Note line; but why?\n\nwhistlepig [OP]\n\nDeal Addict\n\n1255 posts\n\n241 upvotes\n\nBurrowborough\n\nEarly AnTuTu benchmarks score the Galaxy S6 at a scorching 69,019!"
