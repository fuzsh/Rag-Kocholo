IT AFFECTS THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF EACH GUEST THAT OBTAINS A TICKET TO OR ENTERS THE EDGE EXPERIENCE AT HUDSON YARDS (THE “EDGE”).\n\nIn consideration for being permitted to enter the Edge, an observation deck located at Hudson Yards, provided and/or operated by HY Attractions Manager LLC on behalf of KRE HYOD Owner LLC, or an affiliate thereof (“Company”), I, on behalf of myself and my participating minor child/children, if any, agree to the following:\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RISKS. I am aware and understand that the Edge is an observation deck and experience that inherently involves potential risks and dangers associated with interacting with and in, and traversing through, in and/or around, an observation deck experience. Those risks may include, for example, slipping, being knocked off balance, falling, exposure to heights (which may cause vertigo, nausea, or discomfort), exposure to flashing or intermittent special effects or lighting, personal injury, or death.\n\nASSUMPTION OF RISKS. DESPITE THE RISKS AND DANGERS INHERENT IN VISITING THE EDGE, I AGREE TO ASSUME ANY AND ALL RISKS CONNECTED WITH THE EDGE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, PERSONAL INJURY, ILLNESS, DEATH, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR LOSS.\n\nRELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, I, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF, MY HEIRS, EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS HEREBY WAIVE, HOLD HARMLESS AND RELEASE COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS AND THE OWNERS OR LESSEES OF ANY PREMISES USED FOR THE EDGE (COLLECTIVELY, “RELEASED PARTIES”) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LAWSUITS, DAMAGES, AND LIABILITIES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, IN LAW OR EQUITY THAT I, MY HEIRS, EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS EVER HAD OR MAY HAVE, ARISING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO MY VISIT TO THE EDGE.\n\nDISCLAIMER. COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE EDGE. COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ACCURACY OR QUALITY AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS, INJURY, OR DAMAGE, INCLUDING PHYSICAL INJURY OR DAMAGES OR LOSS TO PROPERTY.\n\nDISPUTES. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Edge or Company will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of New York, apply to this agreement and any matters relating to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow this Agreement as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: c/o The Related Companies, L.P., 30 Hudson Yards, New York, New York 10001, Attention: Hudson Yards, General Counsel. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial and agree that any such court proceeding must take place in a federal or state court located in New York County, State of New York. I irrevocably consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any claim that any such court is an inconvenient forum or venue.\n\nNOTICE OF FILMING OR RECORDING. I understand that I may be photographed, filmed, or otherwise recorded at the Edge, and that all photographs, recordings, and video footage taken of me by or on behalf of the Company while at the Edge (“Recordings”) will be the property solely of Company. As the owner of the Recordings, subject to Company’s compliance with applicable laws, Company has the unconditional, irrevocable right to use the Recordings in all media and formats, whether now or later known or developed.\n\nFITNESS AND RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR. I represent that I (and any minor children or other people under my responsibility or control): (a) am not under the influence of any alcohol, drugs, or medications that would alter or impair my or their senses, judgment, or fitness for participation; (b) am not aware of any physical, emotional, or other condition that could create a hazard to me or others as a result of entering or experiencing the Edge; and (c) will act responsibly during my participation with and at the Edge in accordance with all of the Edge’s rules, regulations, procedures and standards of conduct set forth herein or otherwise posted on the Edge’s premises or in its vicinity.\n\nEMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. I give permission to Company to administer first aid and to arrange for emergency medical care, treatment, and transportation for me in case of a medical emergency. I also give permission to the health care professional selected by Company to examine, diagnose and treat me, or secure treatment for me, if proper and necessary under the circumstances. I acknowledge that I am solely responsible for any and all charges for medical services provided to me or on my behalf and for carrying my own health insurance. The waiver and release of liability in this Agreement extends to any liability arising out of or in any way connected with any such medical treatment and transportation I receive or any failure to provide such treatment or transportation.\n\nINSPECTION; SEARCHES. I give permission to Company to search my person and belongings prior to my entry to the Edge and at any time while I am on the Edge premises. I agree that if I refuse to submit to such search or am found to be in possession of dangerous or unsuitable materials (as determined in Company’s sole discretion), I may be refused entry to or removed from the Edge and its vicinity.\n\nINVALIDITY. If any portion (e.g., paragraph or sentence) of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable to any extent and for any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion will be excluded to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; all other terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect; and, to the extent permitted and possible, the invalid or unenforceable term will be deemed replaced by a term that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable term.\n\nMODIFICATIONS. Company reserves the right to amend or vary the terms of the Agreement (and any exhibits or amendments to the legal Agreement) from time to time by posting such updated terms on the Edge website.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement states the complete understanding as to its subject matter, and may only be modified (or any provision waived) by a writing signed by the parties. I understand and agree that this Agreement is legally binding on me, my minor children, if applicable, my heirs, personal representatives, and assigns.\n\nPARENT/GUARDIAN CONSENT FOR GUESTS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. I represent that I am over the age of 18 and/or I am the parent or guardian of a guest that is under the age of 18 (“Minor”).
