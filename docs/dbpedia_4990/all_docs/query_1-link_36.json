        "text": "Mr. Haniyeh was mourned in Qatar on Friday. His likely successors vowed at his burial that his death would only strengthen Hamas’s will to fight.\n\nDiplomats labored to prevent the killings from sparking a wider war, what one U.N. official called “a spillover of the conflict” in Gaza. Asked about the situation, President Biden said late Thursday that he was “very concerned.” In a telephone call earlier in the day, he had pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to agree to a truce.\n\n“We have the basis for a cease-fire,” Mr. Biden told reporters. “They should move on it now.”\n\nBefore the two assassinations this week, Western officials had said in recent days that negotiators were getting closer to a cease-fire agreement. In addition, domestic pressure was mounting on Mr. Netanyahu to secure the release of the hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups.\n\nOn Friday, the prime minister ordered a delegation to leave for Cairo over the weekend to resume talks. It remained unclear, however, how badly Mr. Haniyeh’s death had damaged the prospects of a deal. He had managed most high-stakes negotiations and diplomacy for Hamas, taking a leading role in the cease-fire talks, which have been conducted through intermediaries in Qatar and Egypt.\n\nHere’s what else you need to know:\n\nThe United States is poised to send more combat aircraft to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran and its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen, American officials said. How many planes to send is still being worked out, as are final approvals from senior officials.\n\nMr. Haniyeh’s death brought cease-fire negotiations to a halt as Hamas and its allies seek to regroup. He had played an important role in the talks, although another Hamas official, Khalil al-Hayya, led most of the group’s negotiating delegations. It is unclear who will take Mr. Haniyeh’s place, although both Khaled Meshal, his predecessor, and Mr. al-Hayya are leading candidates.\n\nTurkey lowered its flag to half-staff at its embassy in Israel on Friday to mourn the assassination of Mr. Haniyeh, and sent top-level dignitaries to his funeral in Qatar, further ratcheting up tensions with Israel after a monthslong rift between the two countries over the war in Gaza.\n\nThe explosion that killed Mr. Haniyeh on Wednesday was not caused by a missile, but by a bomb covertly smuggled into the Tehran guesthouse where he was staying to attend the inauguration of the new Iranian president, according to Middle Eastern officials, including two Iranians, and an American official. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran.\n\nThe pro-settler policies of the government have come under fire from several countries and international organizations, including the Group of 7, since the conflict in Gaza started. The European Union and United States have in recent months sanctioned settlers, groups and other entities that they say are inciting violence against Palestinians, blocking access to land or otherwise violating human rights.\n\nLast month, the International Court of Justice, the United Nation’s highest court, issued an advisory opinion that concluded Israel was illegally occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and through its settlement and construction was conducting a “de facto” annexation.\n\nThe new report found that plans and approvals by the Israeli government to construct new housing units in the West Bank saw a particularly sharp yearly increase, rising to nearly 12,350 units in 2023 from 4,400 units in 2022.\n\n“For the West Bank, it was the highest number advanced since the signing of the Oslo Accords,” it stated, referring to a 1993 declaration of principles for reaching a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, which ultimately fell apart.\n\nThe advancements in 2023 represent a 180 percent increase over a period of five years, according to the report.\n\nWhile the extent of Israeli advancement in East Jerusalem was less dramatic than in the West Bank last year, Jewish expansion there was particularly problematic geographically, the report said.\n\n“From the perspective of safeguarding a two-state solution where Jerusalem could serve as a capital of both states, the Israeli settlement developments on the southern periphery of Jerusalem is severing the chances for contiguity between East Jerusalem and the West Bank,” the report said.\n\nThe European Union’s report noted that for the first time in more than 20 years, construction began on a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in 2023. A second new settlement in the area was fully approved late last year, and plans were also advanced for construction in Palestinian neighborhoods there, “which has been known to cause friction,” the report said.\n\nMr. Netanyahu — and some of his far-right ministers, who are settlers themselves — have been vocal about their expansionist aims. In a speech to the U.S. Congress last month, Mr. Netanyahu referred to Jerusalem as “our eternal capital never to be divided again.”\n\nPalestinians have long argued that the settlements are a creeping annexation, carving out territory that should become a Palestinian state into an unworkable patchwork while steadily pushing Arabs out of their homes and farms.\n\nThe United Nations in 1947 approved a partition creating a Jewish state and a Palestinian one that would include the West Bank; it put Jerusalem under international control. But after the first Arab-Israeli war, Jordan took control of the West Bank and Jerusalem became divided between Israel and Jordan.\n\nIn a 1967 war, Israel annexed East Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank, which it says is disputed territory whose fate should be determined in negotiations. Soon after, it began to permit settlements there. Under Israeli law, legal settlements must be built on land held by the state, must have government building permits and must be established by a government resolution.\n\nUnder the Oslo accords, signed by Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s, both sides agreed that the status of Israeli settlements would be resolved by negotiation, a prospect that grows dimmer with each new outpost, settlement and housing unit.\n\n“The E.U. has repeatedly called on Israel not to proceed with plans under its settlement policy and to halt all settlement activities,” the report said. “It remains the E.U.’s firm position that settlements are illegal under international law” and undermine “the prospects of a viable two state solution.”\n\nIsrael is widely believed to be behind Mr. Haniyeh’s killing, but it has not acknowledged playing a role in it. Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen, have threatened to retaliate against Israel, heightening tensions in the region.\n\nMr. Haniyeh, who ran Hamas’s political office from Qatar, was buried in the city of Lusail after a funeral ceremony in the capital, Doha, at Qatar’s largest mosque.\n\nThousands of mourners, including top Hamas leaders, senior leaders from across the Muslim world and Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, attended Friday’s funeral prayers.\n\nVideo of the funeral, shown on Al Jazeera and other Arab media outlets, showed Mr. Haniyeh’s coffin draped in a Palestinian flag and carried in a procession along with the coffin of his bodyguard, who was also killed on Wednesday.\n\nA statement by Hamas on Friday said the funeral prayer was led by Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy leader of Hamas in Gaza, and attended by Khaled Meshal, a former head of the political office who remains influential in the group.\n\nSpeaking during the funeral prayers, Mr. Meshal said Mr. Haniyeh’s death would only strengthen Hamas’s fight for a Palestinian state.\n\n“Palestine will remain from the river to the sea,” Reuters quoted him as saying, citing a video released by Hamas. He added that Israel had “no place on the land of Palestine, regardless of how many they kill of us.”\n\nHe said Haniyeh’s death was a significant loss but he promised that it would not change the group’s course, saying that when one of the group’s leaders are killed, “another leader comes.”\n\nMr. Haniyeh was also mourned in other parts of the Muslim world as protests and funeral prayers were held in absentia for the Hamas leader. Pakistan held a funeral prayer for the assassinated leader at the Parliament House, which was attended by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and lawmakers.\n\nThousands of protesters, many carrying Mr. Haniyeh’s pictures, also demonstrated in the streets of Lebanon, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThere was rage on the streets of Gaza, but it wasn’t necessarily over Mr. Haniyeh’s killing.\n\nMuch of it was triggered by the grisly familiar sight of rescuers and civilians pulling the dead and wounded from buildings destroyed by new Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City and Khan Younis.\n\nAnd while Mr. Haniyeh’s funeral prayer in Doha was held in the grandeur of Qatar’s largest mosque and attended by thousands, those in Gaza note that funeral prayers for their dead — if they happen at all — are generally rushed and performed either in hospital hallways or in the street amid ruined buildings.\n\nMr. Haniyeh’s coffin was draped ceremoniously in the Palestinian flag, but Gazans killed in the war are routinely buried in body bags, quickly and mostly in mass, unmarked graves.\n\n“Somebody feel for us,” one man pleaded in the Tal al-Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City as other men around him carried the dead in body bags after airstrikes there. “We are dying. We are dying. Oh, Arabs. We are dying, oh world,” he said in a video posted by Palestinian media.\n\nAt least seven new Palestinian deaths were added to a toll that Gaza health officials say is nearing 40,000 people, many of them women and children, over almost 10 months of war started by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Israel vowed to eradicate Hamas after that and says it has since targeted its leaders in a series of attacks.\n\nAt Al Aqsa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ekrima Sabri mentioned “the martyr Ismail Haniyeh” during his weekly Friday prayer sermon and asked for mercy on his soul.\n\nAfter the sermon, a funeral prayer in absentia was performed for Mr. Haniyeh. Not all worshipers took part though, and some left after the weekly prayer had ended. Nearby, outside the Dome of the Rock prayer hall, Israeli paramilitary police patrolled the courtyard near worshipers trying to stay cool in the shade. There is a history of tension and clashes between the Israeli police and Palestinian worshipers around the mosque compound — a contested religious site holy to both Muslims and Jews.\n\nThe afternoon at the mosque mostly passed without incident, but later, the Israeli police said they had initiated an investigation to determine whether there was any “suspicion of incitement” in Mr. Sabri’s prayer sermon and summoned him for questioning.\n\nPolice also said they had arrested another person who “chanted inciting remarks during the prayer.”\n\nIn the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, where Mr. Haniyeh was born in 1962, dozens of men and boys gathered to perform the funeral prayer on the ground floor of a damaged building. Part of one wall was completely missing.\n\nDespite its designation as a refugee camp, Shati was a developed neighborhood before the war, housing permanently displaced Palestinian refugees and their descendants who fled or were expelled from their homes in 1948 during the conflict that surrounded the creation of Israel.\n\nMr. Haniyeh was born there to parents who themselves fled their homes in what has become the Israeli city of Ashkelon and were never allowed to return by Israel.\n\nRawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.\n\nIsrael had summoned Turkey’s deputy ambassador for a “stern reprimand,” Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X, over the flag at the embassy.\n\n“If the representatives of the embassy want to mourn, let them go to Turkey and mourn together with their master Erdogan,” Israel Katz wrote on X.\n\nOncu Keceli, the Turkish foreign ministry spokesman, responded to Mr. Katz on X, writing: “You cannot reach peace by killing negotiators and threatening diplomats.”\n\nSupport for Palestinians and anger at Israel’s war in Gaza is widespread in Turkish society. On Friday, hundreds of Turks gathered at the Hagia Sofia, an ancient church that Mr. Erdogan converted from a museum to a mosque in 2020, to pray for Mr. Haniyeh at the same time as his funeral in Qatar.\n\nTurkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, and intelligence chief, Ibrahim Kalin, attended the funeral in Qatar. Mr. Fidan met with Khaled Meshal, a prominent Hamas leader who is seen as a possible successor to Mr. Haniyeh, to give his condolences, Turkey’s foreign ministry said on X.\n\nMr. Erdogan has referred to Hamas, which Israel and the United States consider a terrorist group, as “an organization of liberation” while condemning Israel. He has compared Mr. Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and called him a “psychopath” and a “vampire.”\n\nHe recently raised the possibility that Turkey could enter Israel in support of the Palestinians, a significant step-up in his harsh words toward the Jewish state over the Gaza war. In May, Turkey announced that it was freezing trade with Israel.\n\nThe war in Gaza has severely strained relations between the two countries, which had been slowly improving before it started. Only two weeks before the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Mr. Netanyahu met Mr. Erdogan on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, seeking to improve ties. Relations had been strained since Israeli commandos raided a flotilla sailing for Gaza in 2010, killing 10 Turks on board.\n\nReached on Thursday, Mr. Dekel-Chen sounded far less hopeful as tensions spiked across the region. His son was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, a community devastated by the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7; roughly 100 of its residents were either killed or taken hostage.\n\n“It seems like it will delay any possible resolution, cease-fire or hostage release,” said Mr. Dekel-Chen, referring to the assassination of Mr. Haniyeh, who played a key role in cease-fire talks. “It could very easily mean that revenge, retribution is taken against our loved ones.”\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the decision to press onward with the war effort, including by striking senior Hamas leaders, was bringing Israel closer to a deal to bring home the hostages. Some, particularly the families of the remaining hostages, appeared unconvinced.\n\n“I don’t see the straight line that goes from that assassination to the release of the hostages,” said Mr. Dekel-Chen.\n\nOn Thursday, as Israel braced for retaliation by Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah, the families of the remaining 115 living and dead captives marked a bitter milestone — 300 days since their loved ones were taken hostage. That morning, Hamas-led militants swept into southern Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people and abducting 250 others back to Gaza.\n\nOver 40 of the remaining hostages are presumed dead, according to the Israeli authorities. The families of hostages believe that reaching a deal to free them as soon as possible is the only way to ensure that any of them come home alive.\n\nIsrael and Hamas reached a weeklong truce to free 105 of the captives in November. But in the months since, Hamas has said it will only release more hostages as part of a permanent cease-fire. Israeli leaders have vowed to continue fighting until they destroy Hamas in Gaza.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have agreed on the overall framework for a cease-fire that would unfold in three stages. The proposal was backed by the Biden administration and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThe families of Israeli hostages have grown increasingly critical of Mr. Netanyahu. They say he has not done enough to reach a deal to free their loved ones. Although Mr. Netanyahu’s government greenlit the framework privately, he declined to clearly endorse it publicly for weeks and has since added new demands.\n\nAgreeing to a permanent cease-fire would endanger Mr. Netanyahu’s ruling coalition, which depends on far-right allies demanding that Gaza be brought under Israeli rule.\n\nAnat Angrest, whose son Matan was abducted on Oct. 7, accused Mr. Netanyahu and his allies of “undermining a deal.”\n\n“So much disappointment, Matan.” Ms. Angrest said at a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday night. “Your prime minister did not bring you home for 300 days now, and even expressed pride that he didn’t succumb to pressure when there was an opportunity.”\n\nTo maintain the presence of an aircraft carrier and its accompanying warships in the region, Mr. Austin also directed the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, now in the eastern Pacific, to relieve the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the next couple of weeks when it is scheduled to return home.\n\nSome ships already in the western Mediterranean Sea will move east, closer to the coast of Israel to provide more security, a senior Pentagon official said.\n\n“Secretary Austin has ordered adjustments to U.S. military posture designed to improve U.S. force protection, to increase support for the defense of Israel and to ensure the United States is prepared to respond to various contingencies,” Sabrina Singh, the deputy Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nThe statement did not specify when the additional warplanes and combatant vessels would arrive, but officials said on Friday it would be a matter of days for the additional aircraft and somewhat longer for the naval reinforcements.\n\nEarlier on Friday, officials were still deciding how many additional planes and warships to send. Officials said they were seeking to calibrate the American response to send enough of the right types of aircraft and ships as quickly as possible to help defend Israel without appearing to escalate the conflict.\n\nMs. Singh, in a news conference earlier on Friday, had raised the possibility that the United States could also send additional troops to operate whatever additional capabilities the Pentagon sends to the region. The support, she said, would be defensive in nature.\n\nShe said that during a telephone call Mr. Austin held with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Friday morning, Mr. Austin “committed” that the United States would help Israel in its defense. “We will be bolstering our force protection in the region,” she said.\n\nThe Pentagon is also bracing for the possibility that Iran-backed groups, including the Houthis in Yemen and Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq, might target American troops in the region as part of the expected Iranian retaliation for the killing of Mr. Haniyeh this week.\n\nMr. Austin, during the conversation with Mr. Gallant, expressed concerns about the dangers of escalation. He said that “all countries” in the region would benefit from defusing tensions, Ms. Singh said.\n\nIn addition to some 80 land-based combat aircraft, the Pentagon has already deployed more than a dozen warships in the region. The aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, equipped with about 40 F/A-18 Super Hornet and F-35 attack planes, is now steaming near the Arabian Gulf, while the U.S.S. Wasp amphibious ready group, with 30 airplanes and helicopters as well as 4,500 Marines and sailors, is operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAny additional air power could be crucial. Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel in a major attack in April, but only a handful got through, causing slight damage. U.S. Air Force jets based in Jordan and in Saudi Arabia coordinated with French, Jordanian and British Air Force fighters to shoot down more than 80 drones.\n\nIran telegraphed that strike in advance, giving the Pentagon sufficient time to move additional combat aircraft and Navy ships into place while U.S. commanders negotiated access to airspace for fighter jets and coordinated air defense batteries on the ground to help defend Israel.\n\nIt is unclear whether Israel and its allies will have that much time to prepare for any new round of major Iranian attacks, officials said.\n\nAsked about the situation in the Middle East after the assassination of a top Hamas leader in Iran this week, the president said he was “very concerned” and that Mr. Netanyahu should agree to a deal for a pause in fighting.\n\n“We have the basis for a cease-fire,” Mr. Biden said Thursday. “They should move on it now.”\n\nResponding to a reporter’s question on whether the killing of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had ruined the prospect of a deal, the president said, “It has not helped.”\n\nU.S. officials have been scrambling this week in the aftermath of Mr. Haniyeh’s death to keep the violence from spiraling and to salvage a cease-fire deal, which would include the release of hostages remaining in Gaza. A team of American negotiators was heading to Cairo from Saudi Arabia as part of the effort. Mr. Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, was a key negotiator for the Gaza-based militant group in the talks.\n\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Thursday also redoubled his calls for a cease-fire, saying the region was on a path toward more violence and conflict and that a deal was crucial to alter that course.\n\nAsked whether Mr. Netanyahu had misrepresented his desire for a cease-fire deal given the killings of the Hamas leader and a senior Hezbollah official, Mr. Blinken did not name Israel but said, “It’s urgent that all parties make the right choices in the days ahead.”\n\n“It all starts with a cease-fire, and to get there it also first requires all parties to stop taking any escalatory actions,” he said, while traveling in Mongolia.\n\n“Due to current developments, the Lufthansa Group is once again adjusting its service to the Middle East,” the German airline Lufthansa said on its website. The carrier had previously canceled flights to Beirut and is extending the pause by one week, through Aug. 12. Lufthansa also said it was suspending passenger and cargo flights to Tel-Aviv through Aug. 8.\n\nSwitzerland’s airline, SWISS, and Austria Airlines made similar announcements.\n\nThe cancellations came after a Lufthansa flight that was headed for Tel Aviv on Wednesday made an unexpected landing in Cyprus, deciding against entering Israeli airspace, the Israel Airports Authority said on Thursday.\n\nDelta said on Wednesday that it was pausing flights to Tel Aviv from New York through Friday “due to ongoing conflict in the region.” But the carrier noted that travelers could still book flights to Tel Aviv through its partners, Israel’s El Al airline and Air France.\n\nSimilarly, United on Wednesday said in a statement that it was suspending flights to Tel Aviv “for security reasons” and would “continue to closely monitor the situation.”\n\nThe flight-tracking website Flight Aware on Thursday showed 18 flights had been canceled at the international airport in Tel Aviv on Thursday. According to the site, Air India also canceled all Tel Aviv flights, while other carriers appear to have halted some flights but not all. Air India did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe cancellations came as Israel’s national security council said in a new travel warning that Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah could seek to target Israelis abroad in the coming days, in retaliation for the killings of Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commander, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political chief. Israel announced it had struck Mr. Shukr not long after the airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday, but has not acknowledged or denied killing Mr. Haniyeh in Tehran, as it has been accused of doing by Hamas and Iran.\n\nIsrael had already boosted security for its athletes at the Paris Olympic Games, and they will likely receive heightened protection in the aftermath of the killings.\n\nBut although Mr. Nasrallah promised that Hezbollah would respond, he equivocated on the scope and nature of that retaliation.\n\n“We have entered a new phase,” he said, speaking in a televised address during the funeral for Mr. Shukr. “You do not realize the red lines you have crossed,” warned Mr. Nasrallah, addressing Israel directly.\n\n“The response will come, whether spread out or simultaneously,” he added.\n\nOfficials and diplomats across the Middle East had been looking to the speech for any indication of whether Hezbollah would alter course in its long-running conflict with Israel, either by escalating its military response or seeking to lower the pressure and avoid all-out war. The speech by Mr. Nasrallah on Thursday appeared to straddle that line.\n\nAlthough he said the group and its allies were working on “a true response, not a show response as some are trying to suggest,” he added that Israel’s reaction would determine whether the war escalates.\n\nThe targeted Israeli strike in a Beirut suburb on Tuesday that killed Mr. Shukr also killed five civilians and wounded scores more, according to the Lebanese authorities.\n\nThe strike on Tuesday, which Israel quickly announced, was notable for several reasons, analysts said: It killed a high-ranking figure at the core of Hezbollah’s inner sanctum; it caused civilian casualties; and it hit less than three miles from downtown Beirut, Lebanon’s capital city, which had largely been spared direct violence. Some analysts said that Hezbollah could feel compelled to respond strongly because of those facts.\n\nBut Hezbollah has lowered the intensity of its attacks along Israel’s northern border since the strike on Tuesday, an indication that the group recognizes the stakes. Mr. Nasrallah said during his speech that he had ordered his fighters to remain calm, and that the group would resume operations on Friday. The retaliation for the killing of Mr. Shukr would come later, he added.\n\n“The only things lying between us and you are the days, the nights and the battlefield,” said Mr. Nasrallah, again addressing Israel.\n\nAfter Mr. Nasrallah finished his speech, Mr. Shukr’s coffin was carried onto the street outside and met a sea of mourners. The people frantically jostled back and forth to get closer to his body, pumping their fists in the air as the funeral procession moved through Beirut’s southern suburbs.\n\n“No escape, no retreat,” the crowd shouted, repeating chants that echoed over the loudspeaker. Some held up pictures of fighters who had been killed. Others hoisted Hezbollah and Palestinian flags.\n\n“We are not afraid of war,” said Fatima Nizan al-Din, 18, as she left the funeral. “We certainly expect an escalation.”\n\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Hwaida Saad from Beirut."
