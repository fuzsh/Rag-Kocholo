        "text": "This paper examines the nature of the construct of consumers&#39; trust toward the electronic channel of their financial institution. Through a study of a total of 372 individual users of Internet banking in Spain, we have managed to develop a third-order measuring instrument that integrates a total of seven dimensions. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to test the validation and reliability of the proposed scale. Findings provide useful information to professionals who seek to identify how customer&#39;s trust is formed in the online channel and in the financial sector.\n\nPurpose – Based on the trust theory, the purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the role of trustworthiness and trust in users’ intentions to continue using internet banking. Further, the authors position the trust beliefs of competence, benevolence, integrity, and shared values as key antecedents of trustworthiness and trust. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire survey was used to collect responses from 227 actual users of internet banking in Malaysian context. A PLS analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between trusting beliefs, trustworthiness, trust, and internet banking use. Findings – Empirical findings show that trusting beliefs of consistency, integrity, and shared values determine the trustworthiness and trust in internet banking. Moreover, trust was found to mediate the relationship between trustworthiness and internet banking use. Practical implications – The study findings help managers understand the factors that determine Malaysia users trust and trustworthiness perceptions in internet banking. With reports indicated increase in internet banking use in Malaysia, the study findings provide important insights into enhancing users’ trust in internet banking for future transactions. Originality/value – Unlike previous studies that have largely focussed on technology factors, this study based on trust theory proposes that trust is important for users to continue using internet banking services. In developing this trust, the authors propose that trustworthiness is of vital importance. Further, the authors propose and show that trusting beliefs of competence, integrity and shared values influence user trustworthiness and trust in internet banking use. Thus, this study extends the understanding of the internet banking use in Malaysian context."
