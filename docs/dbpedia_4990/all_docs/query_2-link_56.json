        "text": "Samsung has taken the wraps off of two new devices that we’re pretty sure everyone knew was coming: the Galaxy S6 Edge+ and the Galaxy Note5.\n\nThe company officially unveiled them at their Galaxy Unpacked 2015 event that was held in New York on Thursday, showing the world what the two new phablets look like and sharing the details of the hardware that will be powering them.\n\nAnd to be honest, we’re quite impressed. The S6 and S6 Edge were – and still are – beasts on the performance front, and these two new additions to Sammy’s lineup look to be even more potent. But they’re not just faster, they’re also bigger, as both sport 5.7-inch displays and measure a smidge more length- and breadthways.\n\nThe hardware in each phablet is nearly identical, with the biggest difference being the Note5’s inclusion of Samsung’s S-Pen stylus. Otherwise, they match each other spec-for-spec.\n\nHere’s what they’re both packing under the hood:\n\nDisplay: 5.7” Quad HD Super AMOLED @ 2 560×1 440 (518 ppi)\n\nProcessor: 64-bit Exynos 7420 Octa core (2.1GHz Quad + 1.5GHz Quad)\n\nRAM: 4GB\n\nStorage: 32GB, 64GB\n\nConnectivity: LTE, 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS\n\nCamera: Rear : 16MP OIS (F1.9), Front : 5MP (F1.9)\n\nOS: Android Lollipop 5.1\n\nBattery: 3 000maH, supports wireless charging\n\nDimensions: 154.4 x 75.8 x 6.9 mm (153 g)\n\nIf you’d like to see both phones in far more detail on their official portals on Samsung’s website, you can find the Note5 here, and the Edge+ here.\n\nSide note: Samsung has done a brilliant job of creating online showcases for both phones that actually out-do Apple, no small feat.\n\nThe phablets are out in August in the US, and apparently the official word from Samsung is that the S6 Edge+ will see wider availability (read: will launch in more countries) than the Note 5.\n\nThe Edge6+ comes in gold, silver, black and white, though different regions may carry different colors. Prices vary by retailer and country, but the Edge+ will cost more than the Note 5 overall.\n\nBoth are out on the 21st of August, but as stated before not in every country. We’ve not received local pricing information on either or whether the Note5 is definitely coming to SA, but we’ll let you know when we do.\n\nIn the meantime, here are the official video introductions to both devices to inspire your gadget-lust.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q-p-zkydLQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CppgLnNM1PE"
