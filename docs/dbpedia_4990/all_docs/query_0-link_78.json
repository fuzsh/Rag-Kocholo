Therefore, students in both MBA and undergraduate courses have an urgent need to under- stand operations—an essential function in every business. This textbook on operations management in the supply chain emphasizes decision mak- ing in operations with a supply chain orientation. The text provides materials of interest to general business students and operations and supply chain management majors. By stress- ing cross-functional decision making, the text provides a unique and current business per- spective for all students. This is the first text to incorporate cross-functional decision making in every chapter. A unique decision framework organizes the material by grouping decisions into five major categories: process, quality, capacity, inventory, and supply chain. This framework is intended to make it easy for students to understand the decision role and responsibilities of operations and supply chain management in relation to functions such as marketing and finance. See the illustration below. The text also provides a balanced treatment of both service and manufacturing firms. We continue to emphasize operations in the supply chain with new chapters on sourcing and logistics. The most current knowledge is incorporated, including global operations, supply chain management, e-operations, service blueprinting, competency-based strategy, Six Sigma, lean systems, 3D printing, sustainability, supply chain risk, and mass customization. Complete coverage is also provided on traditional topics, including process design, service systems, quality management, ERP, inventory control, and scheduling. While covering the concepts of operations and supply chain management in 18 chapters, the book also provides 18 case studies. The cases are intended to strengthen problem for- mulation skills and illustrate the concepts presented in the text. Long and short case studies are included. The cases are not just large problems or examples; rather, they are substantial management case studies, including some from the Northwestern, Sheffield, Cranfield, and The Case Centre collections. The softcover edition with fewer pages than most introductory books covers all the essentials students need to know about operations management in the supply chain, leaving out only superfluous and tangential topics. By limiting the size of the book, we have condensed the material to the basics. The book is also available for the first time in digital formats in Connect and LearnSmart versions.\n\nDecision-making framework for operations in the supply chain. Process\n\nQuality\n\nCapacity\n\nInventory\n\nSupply Chain\n\nDecisions\n\nHuman Resources Finance\n\nMarketing\n\nAccounting Information\n\nSystems\n\nSuppliers Customers\n\nviii Preface\n\nThis book is ideal for regular operations management courses and also case courses and modular courses. It is particularly useful for those who desire a cross-functional and decision-making perspective that reaches across the supply chain. Instructors can easily supplement the text with their own cases, readings, or course materials as desired. The Connect Library and Instructor Resources contain 20 Excel templates designed to assist in solving problems at the end of chapters and the case studies. These resources also contain technical chapters on linear programming, simulation, transportation method, and queuing, which can be assigned by the instructor, if desired. The resources have Power- Point slides, solutions manual, the test bank, and web links to companies cited in the Stu- dent Internet Exercises in the text. Access to these web resources can be obtained from your McGraw-Hill sales representative or directly in the Connect Library. A number of pedagogical features are contained in this book.\n\n∙ Operations Leader boxes are included in each chapter to illustrate current practices being implemented by leading firms.\n\n∙ Each chapter contains at least three Student Internet Exercises. These exercises allow for extended learning about concepts discussed in the chapter.\n\n∙ Points of cross-functional emphasis are noted in each chapter by a special symbol—a handshake. This highlights the locations of cross-functional aspects of operations decisions.\n\n∙ Solved problems are included at the end of quantitative chapters to provide addi- tional examples for students.\n\n∙ Excel spreadsheets are keyed to specific problems at the end of chapters.\n\nKEY CHANGES IN THE SEVENTH EDITION This book is known for its decision orientation and case studies. We have strengthened the decision-making framework by addressing new decisions in sourcing, logistics, sustain- ability, and global supply chains. We also added new cases to address these decisions.\n\n1. Supply Chain Management. This edition added a new section on Supply Chain. It contains two new chapters on Sourcing and Global Logistics. The Sourcing chapter contains material on sourcing goals, outsourcing, offshoring, reshoring, supply base optimization, the purchasing cycle, and scorecard weighting. The Global Logis- tics chapter contains material on the role of logistics, transportation modes, distribu- tion centers, logistics networks, location, third-party logistics, and logistics strategy. In addition, the Supply Chain Management chapter was moved to this section and up- dated to add a new section on supply chain risk and another new section on supply chain sustainability. This edition now has the latest and best supply chain material available. 2. Sustainability. More emphasis is given to sustainability. It is now covered in the chapters on The Operations Function, Operations and Supply Chain Strategy, Process Selection, and Supply Chain Management. A new case study is added on Murphy Warehouse: Sustainable Logistics. 3. Global. More material is provided on global operations and supply chains. With the addition of the Sourcing and Global Logistics chapters, global emphasis now moves beyond operations to the entire supply chain. New material on outsourcing, offshoring, and managing global supply chains has been added. New cases on global sourcing, global plant location, and global logistics are added.\n\ne celx\n\nPreface ix\n\n4. Other Additions. We have added materials on lean Six Sigma, 3D Printing, big data, analytics, ethics in sourcing, and disaster logistics. 5. Digital Versions. Digital versions of the text in McGraw-Hill’s Connect and LearnSmart have been developed. The Connect version provides a complete course man- agement system for the instructor and pdf content for students. It can be used to customize the course by selecting learning objectives for course coverage, using the test bank for multiple choice questions, automatic grading for selected quantitative problems, and access to all instructor support materials. The LearnSmart version provides feedback to students via multiple choice probes for each learning objective. The student is directed to return to readings where retention is weak. 6. Cases. Eighteen case studies are provided including cases from The Case Centre, and Northwestern, Sheffield, and Cranfield Universities. Existing cases have been revised to add current information. Ten new cases are added:\n\nAltimus Brands: Managing Procurement Risk; Murphy Warehouse Company: Sustainable Logistics; Polaris Industries Inc.—Global Plant Location; Shelter Box: A Decade of Disaster Relief; The Westerfield Physician Practice: Value Stream Mapping; Journey to Perfect: Mayo Clinic and the Path to Quality; The Evolution to Lean Six Sigma in 3M, Inc.; Sage Hill Above Onion Creek: Focusing on Service Process and Qualilty; Toledo Custom Manufacturing: Quality Control; Best Homes: Forecasting\n\nINSTRUCTOR RESOURCES Instructor Resource Center www.mhhe.com/schroeder7e The Instructor Resource Center provides complete materials for study and review.

Understanding the importance and value of AACSB accreditation, the authors of Opera- tions Management in the Supply Chain, 7e have sought to recognize the curricula guide- lines detailed in the AACSB standards for business accreditation. By connecting questions in the test bank and end-of-chapter material to the general knowledge and skill guidelines found in the AACSB standards. It is important to note that the statements contained in Operations Management in the Supply Chain, 7e are provided only as a guide for the users of this textbook. The AACSB leaves content coverage and assessment within the purview of individual schools, the mis- sion of the school, and the faculty. While Operations Management in the Supply Chain, 7e and the teaching package make no claim of any specific AACSB qualification or evalua- tion, we have within Operations Management in the Supply Chain, 7e labeled selected questions according to the general knowledge and skills areas.\n\nMCGRAW-HILL CUSTOMER CARE CONTACT INFORMATION At McGraw-Hill, we understand that getting the most from new technology can be chal- lenging.

The Operations Function\n\n2. Operations and Supply Chain Strategy\n\n3. Product Design\n\nThe introductory part of this text provides an overview of the operations function, operations and supply chain strategy, and product design. After reading this part, students should have an appreciation for the importance to the firm of decisions made in the operations function and its associated supply chain. Also, the need for strategy to guide all decision making is emphasized. New-product design is treated as a cross-functional decision responsibility that precedes the production and delivery of goods or services.\n\n2\n\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES After reading this chapter, you should be able to:\n\nLO1.1 Define operations management.\n\nLO1.2 Describe the five main decisions made by operations and supply chain managers.\n\nLO1.3 Explain the nature of cross-functional decision making with operations.\n\nLO1.4 Define typical inputs and outputs of an operations transformation system.\n\nLO1.5 Identify contemporary challenges facing operations and supply chain managers.\n\n1 c h a p t e r\n\nOperations management, as a field, deals with the production of goods and services. Every day we come in contact with an abundant array of goods or services, all of which are pro- duced under the leadership of operations managers. Nonprofit and government services are also managed by operations managers. Without effective management of operations, a modern industrialized society cannot exist. The operations function is the engine that cre- ates goods and services for the enterprise and underpins the global economy. Operations managers have important positions in every organization. One example is the plant manager who is in charge of a factory. Other managers who work in the factory— including production and inventory control managers, quality managers, and line supervisors—are also operations managers. Collectively, this group of managers is respon- sible for producing the supply of goods in a manufacturing business. We should also include in the group of operations managers all manufacturing managers at the corporate or divi- sional level. These managers might include a corporate vice president of operations (or manufacturing) and a group of corporate staff operations managers concerned with quality, production and inventory control, facilities, and equipment. Operations managers have important responsibilities in service industries as well. In the private sector, operations managers take leadership roles in hotels, restaurants, airlines,\n\nThe Operations Function\n\nChapter 1 The Operations Function 3\n\nbanks, and retail stores. In each of these organizations, operations managers are responsible for producing and delivering the supply of services. In government offices, there are operations managers in the post office, police department, and housing department, to name only a few. Anyone who is responsible for producing or delivering the service is an operations manager.\n\nAt first glance, it may appear that service operations have little in common with manufacturing operations. However, the unifying feature of these operations is that both can be viewed as transformation processes inside organizations that are themselves embedded within supply chains. In manufacturing, inputs of raw materials, energy, labor, and capital are transformed into finished goods. In service operations, the same types of inputs are transformed into services. Managing the transformation process in an efficient and effective manner is the task of the operations manager in any type of organization.\n\nMost Western economies have shifted dramatically from the production of goods to the production of services. It may come as a surprise that today more than 80 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed in service industries.1 Even though the preponderance of employ- ment is in the service sector, manufacturing remains important to provide the goods needed for export and internal consumption. Because of the importance of both service and manufacturing operations, they are treated on an equal basis in this text.\n\nIn the past when the field was related primarily to manufacturing, operations management was called production management. Later, the name was expanded to “production and operations management,” or,\n\nmore simply, “operations management,” to include the service industries as well. The term “operations management” as used in this text refers to both manufacturing and ser- vice industries.\n\nToday, individuals who work in operations and associated supply chains can belong to a number of professional societies. These societies provide opportunities to become certi- fied, network with other professionals, and learn about and share best practices. See the Operations Leader box titled “Professional Societies Affiliated with Operations and Sup- ply Chain Management.” The Operations Leader boxes throughout this book highlight best practices and useful professional knowledge in a variety of industries.\n\n1.1 WHY STUDY OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT?\n\nAll businesses want to hire bright people who can make the best decisions for the business as a whole, not the best marketing, finance, or operations decisions. They want employees who can see the big picture of how these functional areas interact. You will severely limit your career if you take a narrow functional perspective.\n\nOperations managers make important decisions in both manufacturing and service organizations. © McGraw-Hill Education/Jill Braaten\n\n1 U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States, Washington, DC, 2016 ed.\n\n4 Part One Introduction\n\nEvery decision is cross-functional in nature.2 You will be working with operations and need to understand operations no matter what career path you choose. Operations is a major func- tion in every organization, and regardless of the function in which you work, you will interact with the operations function that produces goods or services (or both). The organization in which someone works only with people from his or her own function does not exist. That is why we take a cross-functional perspective in this text so that the content is useful to all majors. As you study operations management, you will find that many of the ideas, techniques, and principles can be applied across the business, not just in operations. For example, all work is accomplished through a process (or sequence of steps). The principles of process thinking found in this text can be applied to all functions. After graduating, many students find that the ideas learned in operations management are among the most useful, regardless of the industry or career they enter. Operations management is an exciting and challenging field of study. The material is both qualitative and quantitative, and both are essential to good management practices. You are embarking on a journey that is interesting and useful no matter what career you choose!\n\n1.2 DEFINITION OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND SUPPLY CHAINS\n\nAll organizations (for-profit and nonprofit) thrive by producing and delivering a good or a service deemed to be of value to customers. Value is the tangible and intangible benefits that customers derive from consuming a good or service at a price they are willing to pay.\n\nLO1.1 Define opera- tions management.\n\nINSTITUTE FOR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT The largest and one of the most respected supply management associations in the world, whose mission is to lead the supply management and sourcing profession through its standards of excellence,\n\nresearch, promotional activities, and education (see www. ism.ws for more information).\n\nCOUNCIL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS\n\nThe preeminent worldwide professional association for supply chain management professionals, whose vision is to lead the evolving supply chain management profes- sion by developing, advancing, and dis-\n\nseminating supply chain knowledge and research (see http://cscmp.org for more information).\n\nOperations Leader Professional Societies Affiliated with Operations and Supply Chain Management\n\nASSOCIATION FOR OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT\n\nThe global leader and premier source of the body of knowledge in operations management, including production, inventory, the supply\n\nchain, materials management, sourcing and logistics (see www.apics.org for more information).\n\nAMERICAN SOCIETY FOR QUALITY The world’s leading organization devoted to advancing learning, quality improvement, and knowledge exchange to improve busi- ness results and create better workplaces and communities worldwide (see www.asq. org for more information).\n\n2 The “hand shake” symbol in the margin identifies a point of cross-functional emphasis and is designed to illustrate that the various functions must work together for an organization to be successful and thrive.\n\nChapter 1 The Operations Function 5\n\nFor example, value in a pair of shoes may be shoes that are good looking and comfortable and will last a long time at a price you can afford. What is of value to one customer (or set of customers) may not be of value to another. Flying in first class may be of value to business travelers, but for leisure travelers flying in first class may not be of value because of the price of first-class seats. Value, thus, is always defined in the eyes of the customer (or set of customers) relative to the price paid. See the Operations Leader box for Dell Computer Inc. for a company that creates value for its customers. Organizations that are successful strive to identify the value inherent in the goods or services being offered to customers. They then deploy this understanding to guide the deci- sions that affect the production and delivery of those goods and services. These decisions have an impact on the design, execution, and performance of operations and should be coordinated with decisions made by managers of the sourcing and the logistics functions. The sourcing function (also called purchasing or procurement) is responsible for finding other organizations to serve as sources and then buying the material and service inputs for the transformation process of the organization. The logistics function, in contrast, is typi- cally responsible for the actual movement of goods and/or services across organizations. Collectively, the operations, sourcing, and logistics functions manage the production of the goods or services that are moved through the production process and delivered to customers. Most organizations exist as part of a larger supply chain. The supply chain is the net- work of manufacturing and service operations (often multiple organizations) that supply one another from raw materials through production to the ultimate customer. The supply chain consists of the physical flow of materials, money, and information along the entire chain of sourcing production, and distribution. For example, the food supply chain reaches\n\n2007, through select retail outlets. Orders for products, once taken, are assembled in one of Dell’s factories and often shipped to customers or retail stores within days, with the factories carrying very little finished goods inventory. In addition to the importance of the operations func- tion at Dell, sourcing and logistics activities are critical. Sourcing managers source the many components required to manufacture Dell products, and logistics managers handle the global movement of components and finished goods to satisfy customer demand. Manag- ing Dell’s fast and rapidly changing supply chain is a chal- lenging task that they perform well. Dell today is pursuing environmentally friendly best practices: Its global headquarters campus is now powered by 100 percent green energy; its desk computer systems have been designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; Dell was the first computer manufacturer to offer free computer recycling to customers worldwide; and its “Plant a Tree for Me” and “Plant a Forest for Me” programs have planted over 600,000 trees.\n\nSource: Adapted from www.dell.com, 2015.\n\nOperations Leader Dell Delivers Products and Value\n\nIn 1984 Michael Dell founded Dell Computer Corpora- tion with $1000 in start-up capital and a business model to sell custom-configured personal computers directly to\n\ncustomers while passing along cost sav- ings to customers by cutting out the mid- dlemen. The company offers a range of products beyond personal desktop and mobile computing products; servers, storage, and networking products; print-\n\ning and imaging products; electronics and accessories; enhanced business and consumer services; and busi- ness solutions. Nearly half of Dell’s revenue comes from outside of the United States. In 2013 Dell was taken private in a stock buyout by Michael Dell and investors. In 2015 Dell bought EDS ser- vices to expand its offerings to services, and the cloud. A key to Dell’s strategy is its customer-driven approach to innovation. This approach signals a com- mitment to delivering new products and services that are valued by customers and that address customer needs. This approach explains how Dell pioneered the direct-selling system to allow customer orders to be placed over the Internet or over the phone and, since\n\n6 Part One Introduction\n\nfrom the farm to the food processor to the wholesaler and then the retailer. The supply chain links together the work and output of many different organizations. In this book we discuss operations management in the supply chain. This means we deal with operations in the larger context of its supply chain, including external suppliers and customers. Before discussing the larger supply chain implications, we define operations management as follows:\n\nOperations management focuses on decisions for the production and delivery of the firm’s products and services.\n\nThere are three aspects of operations management that require elaboration:\n\n1. Decisions. The above definition refers to decision making as an important element of operations management. Since all managers make decisions, it is natural to focus on decision making as a central theme in operations. Within the broader context of supply chain, this decision focus provides a basis for identifying major decision types. In this text, we specify the five major decision responsibilities of operations and supply chain management as process, quality, capacity, inventory, and supply chain. These deci- sions provide the framework for organizing the text and describing what operations and supply chain managers do. We will discuss these decisions in greater detail in subse- quent chapters.\n\n2. Function. Operations is a major function in any organization, along with marketing and finance. In a manufacturing company, the operations function typically is called the manufacturing or production department. In service organizations, the opera- tions function may be called the operations department or some name peculiar to the particular industry (e.g., the policy service department in insurance companies). In general, the generic term “operations” refers to the function that produces and delivers goods or services. While separating operations out in this manner is useful for analyzing decision making and assigning responsibilities, we must also integrate the business by considering the cross-functional nature of decision making in the firm.\n\n3. Process. Operations managers plan and control the transformation process and its in- terfaces in organizations as well as across the supply chain. This process view pro- vides common ground for defining service and manufacturing operations as transformation processes and is a powerful basis for the design and analysis of opera- tions in an organization and across the supply chain. Using the process view, we con- sider operations managers as managers of the conversion process in the firm. But the process view also provides important insights for the management of productive pro- cesses in functional areas outside the operations function. For example, a sales office may be viewed as a production process with inputs, transformation, and outputs. The same is true for an accounts payable office and for a loan office in a bank. In terms of the process view, operations management concepts have applicability beyond the functional area of operations. Toyota, for example, uses lean thinking to improve pro- cesses throughout the firm, including processes in human resources, accounting, fi- nance, information systems, and even the legal department. Process improvement is not restricted to operations.\n\nSince the field of operations and supply chain management can be defined by decisions, function, and processes, we will expand on these three elements in detail in this chapter. But first we provide an example of the decisions that would be made by operations and supply chain management in a typical company that makes and markets pizzas.\n\nChapter 1 The Operations Function 7\n\n1.3 DECISIONS AT PIZZA U.S.A.\n\nPizza U.S.A., Inc., produces and markets pizzas on a national basis. The firm consists of 85 company-owned and franchised outlets (each called a store) in the United States. The oper- ations function in this company exists at two levels: the corporate level and the level of the individual store.\n\nThe major operations and supply chain decisions made by Pizza U.S.A. can be described as follows:\n\nProcess Corporate staff makes some of the process decisions, since uniformity across different stores is desirable. They have developed a standard facility design that is sized to fit a particular location. Each store incorporates a limited menu with equipment that is designed to produce high volumes of pizza. As pizzas are made, customers can watch the process through a glass window; this provides entertainment for both children and adults as they wait for their orders to be filled. Because this is a service facility, special care is taken to make the layout attractive and convenient for the customers.\n\nWithin the design parameters established by the corporate operations staff, the store managers seek to improve the process continually over time. This is done both by addi- tional investment in the process and by the use of better methods and procedures, which often are developed by the employees themselves. For example, a store might re-arrange its layout to speed up the process of producing pizzas.\n\nQuality Certain standards for quality that all stores must follow have been set by the corporate staff. The standards include procedures to maintain service quality and ensure the quality and food safety of the pizzas served. While perceptions of service quality may differ by customer, the quality of the pizzas can be specified more exactly by using criteria such as temperature at serving time and the amount of raw materials used in relation to standards, among others. Service-quality measures include courtesy, cleanliness, speed of service, and a friendly atmosphere. Service quality is monitored by store manager observation, comment cards, and occasional random surveys. Each Pizza U.S.A. store manager must\n\ncarefully monitor quality internally and with suppliers to make sure that it meets company standards. All employees are responsible for the quality of their work to ensure that service quality and food quality are meet- ing the standards of the company.\n\nCapacity Decisions about capacity determine the maximum level of output of pizzas. The capacity available at any point in time is determined by the availability of equipment and labor inputs for the pizza-making pro- cess at that time. First, when the initial location and process decisions are made, the corporate staff deter- mines the physical capacity of each facility. Individual store managers then plan for annual, monthly, and daily fluctuations in capacity within the available physical facility. During peak periods, they may employ part-time help, and advertising is used in an\n\nLO1.2 Describe the five main decisions made by operations and supply chain managers.\n\nPizza U.S.A. satisfies its customers by carefully managing the four key decision areas in operations. © Steve Mason/Getty Images\n\n8 Part One Introduction\n\nattempt to raise demand during slack periods. In the short run, individual personnel are scheduled in shifts to meet demand during store hours.\n\nInventory Each store manager buys the ingredients required to make the recipes provided by corpo- rate staff. The store managers decide how much flour, tomato paste, sausage, and other ingredients to order and when to place orders. Store operators must carefully integrate sourcing and inventory decisions to control the flow of materials in relation to capacity. For example, they do not want to purchase ingredients for more pizzas than they have the capacity to bake. They also do not want to run out of food during peak periods or waste food when demand is low.\n\nSupply Chain The supply chain decisions consist of sourcing and logistics. Sourcing is done by the corpo- rate office. They select the specific suppliers for all inputs, negotiate prices, write contracts, and issue blanket purchase orders that stores use to order individual ingredients and items as\n\ncentral operations. This individual will participate in the development of strategic implementation plans and related objectives. Candidates must have strong commu- nication skills and acknowledge the important relation- ship with customer members in supporting the credit union’s vision and mission.\n\nCONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PLANT LEAD ConAgra Foods seeks a partner to roll out a system establishing a zero-loss manufacturing culture.

The orders are then fulfilled by the suppliers, and a logistics provider ensures the orders are delivered on time. Logistics is handled by a third-party provider who secures transportation and uses its distribution centers to make deliveries to Pizza U.S.A. stores. Because Pizza U.S.A. is only one example of an operation, students often ask: What do operations managers do in more general terms? The Monster.com Operations Leader box provides examples of five typical operations management and supply chain positions and describes the associated decision-making responsibilities. The descriptions have been greatly simplified for purposes of illustration. As the Operations Leader box indicates, there is a great variety of management positions in operations and the supply chain. These range from entry-level supervisory positions to middle- and top-management positions with considerable responsibility. These positions also show the breadth of operations and apply to both manufacturing and service operations. There are many opportunities for international employment in operations management since operations are located around the world. Many operations in other countries are seek- ing to implement world-class best practices, and so what is learned in this course can be applied globally.\n\n1.4 OPERATIONS DECISIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN—A FRAMEWORK\n\nThe five decision groupings showcased in the Pizza U.S.A. example provide a framework for understanding the various decisions made by operations and supply chain managers. Although many different frameworks are possible, the primary one used here is a conceptual scheme for grouping decisions according to decision responsibilities. The five key decision areas—pro- cess, quality, capacity, inventory, and supply chain—encompass what operations and supply chain managers do. This novel and useful decision framework is shown in Figure 1.1 and summarized in Table 1.1. In the table, examples are given of key decisions in each area. Careful attention to the five decision areas in the framework is the key to the successful management of operations and the associated supply chain. Indeed, well-managed opera- tions and its supply chain can be defined in terms of this decision framework. If decisions in each of the five groupings support the strategy of the firm, provide value, and are well integrated with the other functions of the organization, the operations function and its asso- ciated supply chain can be considered well managed. Each major section of this text is devoted to one of the five decision categories.3 The framework thus provides an integrating mechanism for the text that covers both the deci- sions faced by operations and supply chain managers as well as the cross-functional issues that must be considered.\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Decision-making framework for operations in the supply chain.\n\nProcess\n\nQuality\n\nCapacity\n\nInventory\n\nSupply Chain\n\nDecisions\n\nHuman Resources Finance\n\nMarketing\n\nAccounting Information\n\nSystems\n\nSuppliers Customers\n\n3 Students have called these five categories QPICS, pronounced “Q-PICS.”\n\n10 Part One Introduction\n\nAnalytics is the analysis of data to make better decisions. Analytics uses many tech- niques for the analysis including those from operations research, statistics, data sciences, and computer science. The analysis can use either big data from massive databases or small data depending on the application. Analytics can be descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive in nature. A descriptive analysis typically summarizes the present situation from data. The data can be used to go one step further and predict what will happen in the future. Prescrip- tive analytics typically uses mathematical models to find an optimal or best decision. Ana- lytics are used in operations and supply chains for a variety of decisions, including quality control, forecasting, capacity, scheduling, inventory, logistics, and sourcing. Throughout the text, best practices are presented. Additionally, discussion and examples of firms in which the best practice is not the best for their particular situation are included. These contingencies, situations, or conditions that require different solutions offer a more nuanced view of operations decision making. For example, successful implementation of a new method such as lean or Six Sigma is contingent on top management support. Simi- larly, the “best” forecasting tools and concepts depend on the availability of data. If there was a single best practice that works for all firms, then operations would not be the chal- lenging function to manage that it is. Therefore, by offering insight into specific conditions in which best practices may not be best, the text addresses the various contingencies or prerequisites or situaitons that need to be considered.\n\n1.5 CROSS-FUNCTIONAL DECISION MAKING\n\nThe operations function is a critical element in every business. No business can survive without good decisions being made by operations managers. The operations function is one of the three primary functions in an organization, along with marketing and finance. In addition, an organization has supporting functions that include human resources, informa- tion systems, and accounting. Some organizations also have separate sourcing and logistics\n\nLO1.3 Explain the nature of cross-functional decision making with operations.\n\nDecisions Examples of Decisions\n\n1.

Supply Chain • What suppliers should be used for products and services? • How should sourcing be conducted and evaluated? • What form of transportation should be used? • How should warehouses be used to allow economic flow of materials?\n\nTABLE 1.1 Operations and Supply Chain Decisions—A Framework\n\nChapter 1 The Operations Function 11\n\nfunctions that support operations. In others, the operations, sourc- ing and logistics functions are joined together to become the supply chain function.\n\nFunctional areas are concerned with a particular focus of respon- sibility or decision making in an organization. The marketing func- tion is typically responsible for creating demand and generating sales revenue; the operations function is responsible for the produc- tion and distribution of goods or services (generating supply); and finance is responsible for the acquisition and allocation of capital. Within for-profit businesses, functional areas tend to be closely associated with organizational departments because businesses typ- ically are organized on a functional basis. Supporting functions are essential to provide staff support to the three primary functions. Every function must be concerned not only with its own\n\ndecision responsibilities but also with integrating decisions with other functions. The five areas of operations and supply chain decisions, for example, cannot be made separately; they must be carefully integrated with one another and, equally important, with decisions made in marketing, finance, and other parts of the organization. In the Pizza U.S.A. exam- ple, if marketing decides to change the price of pizza, this is likely to affect sales and change the capacity needs of operations as well as the amount of ingredients (materials) used. Also, if finance cannot raise the necessary capital, operations may have to redesign the process to require less capital or manage pizza-related inventories more efficiently. This in turn may affect the response time to serve customers, costs, and so on. Decision making is therefore highly interactive and systemic in nature. Unfortunately, functional silos have developed in many organizations and impede cross-functional deci- sion making. As a result, the overall organization suffers due to an emphasis on functional prerogatives. But some companies are different. Texas Instruments, for example, has been a leader in fostering cross-functional integration. They do this by forming cross-functional manage- ment teams for new-product introductions and for day-to-day improvement. Each member of the team is trained in common methodologies, and the team is given responsibility for achieving its own goals. Some of the key cross-functional decision-making relationships are shown in Table 1.2.\n\n1.6 OPERATIONS AS A PROCESS\n\nOperations can be defined as a transformation system (or process) that converts inputs into outputs. Inputs to the system include energy, materials, labor, capital, and information (see Figure 1.2). Process technology is then used to convert inputs into outputs. The pro- cess technology is the methods, procedures, and equipment used to transform materials or inputs into products or services. Viewing operations as a process is very useful in unifying seemingly different opera- tions from different industries. For example, the transformation process in manufacturing is one of material conversion from raw materials into finished products. When an automo- bile is produced, steel, plastics, aluminum, cloth, and many other materials are transformed into parts that are then assembled into the finished automobile. Labor is required to operate and maintain the equipment, and energy and information are also required to produce the finished automobile. In service industries a transformation process is also used to transform inputs into ser- vice outputs. For example, airlines use capital inputs of aircraft and equipment and human\n\nLO1.4 Define typical inputs and outputs of an operations transformation system.\n\nManagerial decision making is cross-functional in nature. © Corbis\n\n12 Part One Introduction\n\nTABLE 1.2 Examples of Cross- Functional Decision Making\n\nKey Decision Area Interface with Operations Decisions\n\nMarketing Market segment and needs Quality design and quality management Market size (volume) Type of process selected (assembly line, batch, or\n\nproject) and capacity required Distribution channels Inventory levels and logistics Pricing Quality, capacity, and inventory New-product introduction Cross-functional teams\n\nFinance and Accounting Availability of capital Inventory levels, degree of automation, process type\n\nselected, and capacity Efficiency of conversion process Process type selection, process flows, value-added\n\ndetermination and sourcing Net present value and cash flow Automation, inventory, and capacity Process costing or job costing Type of process selected Measurement of operations Costing systems used\n\nHuman Resources Skill level of employees Process type selected and automation Number of employees and part-time or\n\nfull-time employment Capacity and scheduling decisions\n\nTraining of employees Quality improvement and skills Job design Process and technology choice Teamwork Cross-functional decisions in operations\n\nInformation Systems Determination of user needs Systems should support all users in operations Design of information systems Systems should help streamline operations and support\n\nall analytics and decisions in operations Software development Software is needed for capacity, quality, inventory,\n\nscheduling and supply chain decisions Hardware acquisition Hardware is needed to support automation decisions in\n\noperations and to run software\n\nFIGURE 1.2 An operation as a productive system.\n\nOPERATIONS MANAGEMENT OUTPUTSINPUTS\n\nEXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\nNATURAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nTransformation (conversion)\n\nprocess\n\nEnergy\n\nMaterials\n\nLabor\n\nCapital\n\nInformation\n\nGoods or services\n\nFeedback information for control of process inputs and process technology\n\nChapter 1 The Operations Function 13\n\ninputs of pilots, flight attendants, and support personnel to produce safe, reliable, fast, and efficient transportation. Transformations of many different types occur in all industries, as indicated in Table 1.3. By studying these different types of transformation processes, you can learn a great deal about how to analyze and manage any operation. Operations as a process provides a basis for seeing an entire business as a system of interconnected processes. This makes it possible to analyze an organization and improve it from a process point of view. All work, whether in finance, marketing, accounting, or other functions, is accomplished by processes. For example, financial analysis of a stock, closing the books at the end of the year, or conducting market research are each conducted by car- rying out an appropriate process. Thus, process principles and tools can be applied in every function in a business. All of these processes and systems interact with their internal and external environ- ments. We have indicated the nature of internal interaction through cross-functional decision making. Interaction with the external environment occurs through the economic, physical, social, and political environment of operations. Examples include economic changes such as rising labor costs, social changes such as customer preference for “green” products, and polit- ical changes such as regulations. Each of these can mean that the operations function and associated supply chain will have to change the way it was producing products and services. Operations is surrounded by both internal and external environments and constantly interacts with them. The interactive nature of these relationships makes it necessary to constantly monitor the environment and make decisions related to corresponding changes in operations and the supply chain when needed. In the fast-changing world of today’s global business, constant change has become essential as a means of survival. Viewing operations as a process or a constantly updating transformation system helps us understand how operations and the supply chain cannot be insulated from changes in the environment but rather must adapt to them.\n\n1.7 CHALLENGES FACING OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGERS\n\nSeveral challenges are important for operations and supply chain managers today and will be addressed repeatedly throughout this text. These challenges make operations and supply chain management an exciting and interesting place for aspiring managers and those who want the challenge of leadership in a fast-moving career.\n\nLO1.5 Identify contemporary challenges facing operations and supply chain managers.\n\nOperation Inputs Outputs\n\nBank Tellers, staff, computer equipment, facilities, and energy\n\nFinancial services (loans, deposits, safekeeping, etc.)\n\nRestaurant Cooks, waiters, food, equipment, facilities, and energy\n\nMeals, entertainment, and satisfied customers\n\nHospital Doctors, nurses, staff, equipment, facilities, and energy\n\nHealth services and healthy patients\n\nUniversity Faculty, staff, equipment, facilities, energy, and knowledge\n\nEducated students, research, and public service\n\nManufacturing plant Equipment, facilities, labor, energy, and raw materials\n\nFinished goods\n\nAirline Planes, facilities, pilots, flight atten- dants, maintenance people, labor, and energy\n\nTransportation from one location to another\n\nTABLE 1.3 Examples of Productive Systems\n\n14 Part One Introduction\n\nOperations concepts and ideas have been applied in service operations for years. Yet, service operations lag behind manufacturing in applying the latest ideas in supply chain management, lean operations, and quality improvement. This represents a challenge and tremendous oppor- tunity to apply what is learned in this course. Also, service-specific ideas such as service recovery, web-enabled service and globalization of service still represent implementation challenges. Nevertheless, some leading service businesses do excel in operations including Walmart, Nordstrom, Starbucks, Amazon.com, FedEx, and Delta Airlines, to name only a few. They excel by applying many of the operations concepts that are presented in this text.\n\nEvery operation should be externally directed to meet customer requirements based on the “voice of the customer.” This concept is often taught in marketing courses and is being integrated into operations and supply chain courses as well. A key point is that operations efficiency need not be sacrificed in the pursuit of meeting customer needs. Rather, the customer can be a powerful driver for reducing waste and improving the efficiency of all processes as firms reduce or eliminate activities that customers do not value. This is an ongoing challenge for operations and supply chain managers to put the customer first, and we provide tools and concepts for doing so.\n\nOne of the most difficult challenges facing all managers is cross-functional integration within the organization. Some organizations are managing functions as separate depart- ments with little integration across them. The best operations are now seeking increased integration through the use of cross-functional teams, information systems, management coordination, rotation of employees and other methods of integration. Most of the imple- mentation problems of new systems or new approaches can be traced to lack of cross-func- tional internal cooperation. The same thing can be said about interorganizational change in supply chains. Even when companies partner with their suppliers or customers the partner- ships are often not successful. Adequate information systems may also be lacking for supply chain integration.\n\nThe focus on sustainability of the natural environment has been heightened in recent years with concerns over global warming, water contamination, air pollution, and so on. Organiza- tions are increasingly being asked to produce and deliver products or services while minimiz- ing the negative impact on the global ecosystem and not endangering the ability to meet the needs of future generations. See the Operations Leader box titled “Sustainability in Interface Inc.’s Operations Transformation Process” for an example of one firm’s success in facing these issues. Operations and supply chain partners have made tremendous strides in reducing pollution of the envi- ronment from air to ground to water, but there is still a long way to go. Operations and their supply chains are finding they can reduce pollution, conserve resources, recycle products and be socially responsible to provide a sustainable world for future generations. Sustainabil- ity is a challenge that progres- sive operations and supply chain organizations are accepting.\n\nServices\n\nCustomer- Directed Operations\n\nIntegration of Decisions Internally and Externally\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nCoke is produced and sold globally.

One can hardly avoid information on the accelerating nature of global business. Strategies for operations and its supply chain partners should be formulated with global effects in mind and not only consider narrow national interests. Even many small busi- nesses compete globally, sourcing or selling goods and services in markets with global competitors. Facility location must be considered in view of its global implications. Tech- nology can be transferred rapidly across national borders. All decisions in operations and its associated supply chains are affected by the global nature of business.\n\n1.8 KEY POINTS AND TERMS\n\nThis text provides a broad overview of the challenging and dynamic field of operations management and the supply chain. It stresses decision making in operations, its associated supply chain, and the relationship of these decisions to other functions. The five major decision categories—process, quality, capacity, inventory and supply chain are the organiz- ing framework for the text.\n\nGlobalization of Operations and the Supply Chain\n\npost-consumer waste (used car- pet) as raw material input to their production system. It is not a perfect system, as it still requires some newly extracted raw mate- rials, but they believe they are moving in the right direction for achieving sustainability.\n\nWith production on four conti- nents and offices in more than 100 countries, Interface Inc. is the global leader in the design, pro- duction, and sales of modular car- pet squares. Since undertaking the goal of sustainability, Inter- face Inc. reports more than 133 million pounds of post- consumer waste has been diverted from landfills to serve as raw materials for new carpet squares. They have achieved a series of major milestones at the European man- ufacturing facility in The Nether-\n\nlands. As of 2015, the plant is operating with 100 percent renewable energy, using virtually zero water in manufactur- ing processes and has attained zero waste to landfill.\n\nSource: Adapted from Dave Gustashaw and Robert W.

The philosophy of sustainability is “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Over the past 15 years, carpet manu- facturer Interface Inc. has shifted its operations toward this phi- losophy and three bottom-line impacts: social, environmental, and financial. Or, in their words: People, Planet, and Profit. A typical operations transfor- mation process requires a con- tinuous supply of new raw mate- rial input. “In most instances, extraction of raw material [from the natural environment] exceeds its natural rate of regen- eration.” Following production, customers use and then dispose of products. Interface Inc. set out to change this typical supply chain with its environmental costs at both ends. They found that the most benign materials to use in manufacturing new products are their own used products. Creating a closed-loop supply chain, they use their own\n\n© Arcaid Images/Alamy Stock Photo\n\n16 Part One Introduction\n\nKey points emphasized in the chapter are these:\n\n∙ Operations and its associated supply chain produces and delivers goods or services deemed to be of value to customers in a global economy. The operations function is es- sential for both for-profit and nonprofit organizations.\n\n∙ Operations management focuses on decisions for the production and delivery of the firm’s products and services. These decisions are intended to maximize the value inher- ent in goods or services delivered to customers throughout the entire supply chain.\n\n∙ The supply chain is the network of manufacturing and service operations that supply each other from raw materials through manufacturing to the ultimate customer. The supply chain consists of the physical flow of materials, money, and information along the entire chain of sourcing production, and distribution. The supply chain connects many different organizations.\n\n∙ There are five key groupings of decisions in operations: process, quality, capacity, inventory, and supply chain. These decisions need to utilize analytics when appropriate and account for contingencies, or special situations, because a best practice may not be best in all circumstances.\n\n∙ Operations decisions are often cross-functional in nature. Decisions may impact or be impacted by activities in other functions such as marketing and finance. Often, cross- functional teams are formed to undertake complex decisions.\n\n∙ We identify several challenges facing operations and supply chain managers that are emerging and will be important in the future. These challenges are services, customer- directed operations, integration of decisions internally and externally, environmental sustainability, and globalization of operations and the supply chain.\n\nKey Terms Value 4 Sourcing function 5 Logistics function 5 Supply chain 5 Operations management 6 Decision making 6 Process 6\n\nTransformation system 11\n\nInternal and external environments 13\n\nVoice of the customer 14 Sustainability 14 Globalization 15\n\nQuality 6 Capacity 6 Inventory 6 Process view 6 Analytics 10 Cross-functional\n\ndecision making 11\n\nSTUDENT INTERNET EXERCISES\n\n1.

This can be done by contributing distinctive capability (or competence) to the business and continually improving the products, services, and processes. The Operations Leader box on Insignia Athletics discusses the way it competes through a strategy of flexible manufacturing and just-in-time delivery for both customized and standard products. Operations should be fully connected to the business strategy.

Value can be created only by operations and supply chains that are more productive than competitors’ in relation to the company’s chosen markets. All functions of the firm must be well coordinated for value to be created and competitive advantage to occur. The cross-functional coordination of deci- sion making is facilitated by an operations strategy that is developed by a team of managers from across the entire business. The following definition of operations strategy is a starting point for our discussion:\n\nOperations strategy is a consistent pattern of decisions for operations and the associated supply chain that are linked to the business strategy and other functional strategies, leading to a competitive advantage for the firm.\n\nThis definition will be expanded throughout this chapter as a basis for guiding all deci- sions that occur in operations and its supply chain with decisions in other functions. We will use McDonald’s as an example in the next several sections to illustrate the ele- ments of an operations strategy. In 1955, Ray Kroc opened his first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, patterned after the McDonald brother’s hamburger stand in California.
