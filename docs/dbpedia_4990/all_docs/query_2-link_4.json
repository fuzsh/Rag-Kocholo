        "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S6 is the worst-kept secret of MWC 2015, and by the looks of it, we're mid-February already! These circumstances make the timing of Samsung's latest announcement near-perfect. The maker of Galaxies published the time and date of its upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event on the official Samsung Spain website. The date is March 1st, the time is 18:30h (CET, UTC/GMT +1h.), and the place is... hmm, we'll have to see about that, for MWC 2015 itself begins March 2nd. This means Samsung is throwing a private party once again, and the very important guests that evening will most certainly be the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy Note Edge.\n\nSave the date, ladies and gentlemen, and prepare yourselves for the next chapter in Galaxy devices' history. Samsung is moving in for the kill this year, with all-metal and glass flagships that explore its proprietary powerhouse processors and curved displays. As mobile technology enthusiasts, we're genuinely excited, and it goes without saying that we'll be attending the show in person.\n\nsource: Samsung via Galaxys6.es\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nWe may wish to follow up.
