The Junior Volunteer programme requires a year-long commitment to support the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo, but the latest cadre came to a halt because of the pandemic. A BZS spokeswoman said: \"When the JV programme was able to recommence in September, the coordinators decided to give last year's JVs the opportunity to have a programme 'do-over'. \"A total of six students accepted the offer, and they are currently participating in the programme together with 12 new students.\" Alex Amat, coordinator for the JV programme and BZS educator, said that some of those who chose not to re-enter the programme still continued to volunteer at BAMZ. Dr Amat said: \"One student was offered a junior staff position at BAMZ. \"Students studying abroad have also pledged to come back and volunteer during their prolonged Christmas break after finishing their quarantine periods. \"We are very proud of their dedication.\" The spokeswoman said BZS volunteers contribute over 10,000 hours of valuable husbandry support to BAMZ every year, with all programmes being accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The JV programme runs from October to June and is intended for pupils between 14 and 17 years of age. It requires a year-long commitment to volunteer on a Saturday or Sunday morning each week, and gives participants the opportunity to work in all areas of BAMZ along with community conservation projects, field trips and educational activities. About Bermuda Zoological Society The shared mission of BZS and BAMZ is to inspire appreciation and care of island environments, and as the support charity for BAMZ, the BZS is an example of a highly successful non-profit/public partnership. Each year the BZS provide more than 8,000 free educational experiences through our Stempel Foundation BZS Schools Programme in addition to popular community programmes for all ages, development of BAMZ exhibits, and conservation and research programmes. Each year, BZS Volunteers contribute over 10,000 hours of valuable husbandry support to the Aquarium and Zoo with all programmes being accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

Flatts fuel spillage poses negligible risk A fuel spill at the Rubis gas station in Flatts Village poses a negligible risk to the environment, according to experts. 'Citizen Scientists' Health Check Bermuda Reefs For the fifth consecutive year, the Bermuda Zoological Society event REEF Watch trained teams of corporate professionals, teenagers and families to conduct coral reef surveys, fish counts and assessments of our reef ecosystem. Global Indemnity Re Donates To Local Charities Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art has praised Global Indemnity Re for their annual charitable giving programme after the arts and education organization was one of four local charities awarded.\n\n{'redpajama_set_name': 'RedPajamaCommonCrawl'}\n\n0\n\nToruń, Poland Nicolaus Copernicus University Subject area: languages University website: www.umk.pl/en English usually refers to: English studies (usually called simply English) is an academic discipline taught in primary, secondary, and post-secondary education in English-speaking countries; it is not to be confused with English taught as a foreign language, which is a distinct discipline. English includes: the study of literature written in the English language (especially novels, short stories, and poetry), the majority of which comes from Britain, the United States, and Ireland (although English-language literature from any country may be studied, and local or national literature is usually emphasized in any given country); English composition, including writing essays, short stories, and poetry; English language arts, including the study of grammar, usage, and style; and English sociolinguistics, including discourse analysis of written and spoken texts in the English language, the history of the English language, English language learning and teaching, and the study of World Englishes. English linguistics (syntax, morphology, phonetics, phonology, etc.) is usually treated as a distinct discipline, taught in a department of linguistics.

The dissertation deals with psychological aspects. Then it mentions the influence of media and also outlines the development of four most influencing genres in pop music (rock, punk, ska, hip hop). The next goal was to determine what is the importance of teenagers' active musicianship (playing in a band), regarding musical appreciation and building up their musicalness. The questionnaires and interviews with students emerge that the listeners who visit the concerts in clubs belong to the group of real music fans who don't perceive music only as a background. For them music embodies the way of self expression and it can also refers to their belonging to a peer group - a group of people with identical views of life, similar musical preferences but with alike appearance attributes too. My thesis is focused on the entire history of the Czech Music Society. This work is divided into two main parts. In the first section I deal with the history of the Czech Music Society from its very beginning to nowadays and in the sccond part I concentrated on the organization structure of every single part. The Czech Music Society is a voluntary independent association of people who are interested in music. The organization concentrates primarily on music education, musicology, interpretation, publishing and so on. It organizes a lot of activities in connection with music, for example courses both for professionals and amateurs, lectures, workshops, concerts, music summer camps and excursions. Its own history dates back to 1972 when the preparatory commission was established. The organization officially started its activity in 1975. The range of activities was truly wide. After the Velvet revolution in 1989 the Czech Music Society had to tackle serious financial problems. The members have tried to solve these problems, unfortunately without any success. The Society will cease to exist by the end of the year 2006.\n\n{'redpajama_set_name': 'RedPajamaC4'}\n\n2\n\n/* Default Variables */ $simple-line-font-path : fonts/; $simple-line-font-family : Simple Line Icons;

Located on top of a small mountain, the Vung Tau Lighthouse was first built in 1907 and was then moved to a higher peak; its current location, after it caught fire. This 18 metre high lighthouse is known to project light as far as 64 kilometres and has telescopes that are used to follow and direct ships at sea. Visitors can climb the spiral steps to almost the top of the lighthouse for a breathtaking 360 degree view of Vung Tau. Those visiting the attraction will also come across 4 old French cannons that were used to defend the area from naval attacks. 4,000 VND Recommended Visit Duration Around 30 minutes or more Adults, senior visitors, young adults, families, children The architecture, the cannons and the spectacular view Prayer Facilities Muslims visiting the Vung Tau Lighthouse will not be able to find any prayer facilities. They will therefore have to offer their prayers outdoors, if able to locate a clean and quiet area near the attraction. If unable to, they will have to return to their hotel rooms at prayer times, as there are no known mosques or Islamic Centres in the city of Vung Tau. Visitors to the Vung Tau Lighthouse may be able to find a couple of food stalls and restaurants in the surrounding area. These outlets will however not be Halal certified, and most will sell non-Halal items. To be on the safe side, Muslim tourists can therefore dine at one of the very few Halal restaurants in the city.

What's the best alternative-fuel car for you?... View all new car Audi A3 Sportback e-tron Maximum towing weight 1600kg Powered by an electric motor and a 1.4-litre petrol engine, the plug-in hybrid version of the A3 doesn't quite have the handling prowess of its petrol and diesel siblings, but it's a relatively roomy family-sized car with a plush interior. It's best suited to those who do lots of fairly short journeys; its batteries will be depleted after 15-20 miles, or less if you're towing. Read our full review of the Audi A3 e-tron Get a great deal on an Audi A3 e-tron The big Audi SUV combines a 3.0-litre V6 diesel engine with a battery pack that will let you travel for 34 miles before it needs to be recharged; this is the official figure, though, so expect to cover fewer miles in real-world driving. That short pure electric range means you'll have to have deep pockets if you're going on a long trip, because fuel economy will plummet once the batteries are depleted. Save up to £3,289 from RRP Read our full review of the Audi Q7 e-tron Get a great deal on an Audi Q7 e-tron BMW X5 xDrive40e The X5 is one of the best luxury SUVs to drive and unsurprisingly it's also one of the best for towing, feeling safe and secure with a caravan behind it. At low speeds, it's powered by an electric motor, which is aided by a 2.0-litre petrol engine if you accelerate hard or travel faster than 44mph. Its electric range is 19 miles. Read our full review of the BMW X5 xDrive40e Get a great deal on a BMW X5 Hyundai Ioniq Plug-in hybrid Maximum towing weight 750kg Like the conventional hybrid version of the Ioniq, the plug-in has a towing capacity limited to small trailers or caravans. It drives well and has plenty of pulling power. However, it's not as quick off the line as the pure electric Ioniq, although that version isn't able to tow. Read our full review of the Hyundai Ioniq Get a great deal on a Hyundai Ioniq The plug-in hybrid Outlander doesn't cost much more to buy than its 2.0-litre petrol sibling and is more economical, thanks to its batteries and two electric motors, which let it travel for up to 28 miles (officially) on pure electric power. Its maximum towing capacity isn't huge, but it's enough for a wide range of caravans. Read our full review of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV Get a great deal on a Mitsubishi Outlander Porsche Cayenne e-Hybrid The hybrid Cayenne has the best towing capacity of any alternative-fuel car and the sportiest handling, making it feel more controlled and predictable through bends than a BMW X5 or Range Rover Sport.

We shall be learning about all the creatures we can find in and around the sea. This topic lends itself well for plenty of lovely art and craft activities making fish galore! This science based topic allows us to spend time having lots of fun with water in many ways. As sand and water play works alongside each other so well, we shall be messing around with sand too, learning as we play. We shall be experimenting with objects that sink and float, and hopefully finding some surprises along the way. We shall be attempting to make boats, and trying to make sure they don't turn into submarines! The children will explore a variety of resources in water to see if they dissolve and we shall be making billions of bubbles, big and small! Maths will be, as usual, focused around the topic so we shall be looking at big and little fish, finding the heaviest treasure, exploring bottles of water and comparing full and empty, heavy and light. We shall be doing some counting using fish and making groups of fish, and making fish using shapes. Cookery this half terms is focusing on biscuits of all flavours, we shall be focusing on the skills of kneading and making shapes using biscuit cutters. A busy but exciting topic! Hello, my name is Chrissie and I am the class teacher for Hummingbird class. Working in my team are Jayne, Hayley, Emily and Natalie. There are six children in the class at the moment, 3 girls and 3 boys all being just or nearly 5 years old. As we have such a young class we work very much as you would expect a reception class to work. We have some structured lessons with group work in the mornings, and then in the afternoons we provide opportunity for free play mixed in with a number of adult led activities. This half term we are learning all about markets, fruit and vegetables and shopping. Our trip for topic will be a visit to the busy market in the centre of Milton Keynes. We have set up a role play market in one of our rooms and will be trying out our shopping skills; making shopping lists, counting and weighing fruit and vegetables and using money to pay for them. and \"Don't forget the bacon\" by Pat Hutchins. In science we will be looking at plant growth. We shall be planting a variety of seeds and watching them grow. The children will learn to label parts of the plant and explore plants by pulling them apart and sorting the parts. We will produce a plant book where the children will take photographs of the seeds as they grow. Some children will be learning about healthy and unhealthy food and will sort them into different groups. We will make some healthy plates to help the children learn about food that is good for them. Computing this half term is all about making marks. We are using two programs to help the children improve their mark making ability. For those who are able, we will use 2paint which allows the children to form letter shapes and overwrite their names and other words and lines. For the other children we will be using a variety of effects on the Busy Things website. This program makes different noises for each pattern and so keeps the children interested for longer periods of time. We will be encouraging the children to make side to side and up and down marks, as well as circles, bumps and scoops! Expressive arts is a lead up to the great Richmond Hill festival in the summer, the children will be preparing for their performance by practicing the dance and creating costumes to wear. This month's topic is all about travel. We will be spending each week learning about different vehicles; construction vehicles, bikes, buses, cars, trains and boats. We will explore make things move in different directions (forwards and backwards) in different ways (fast and slow) and will play with toy vehicles in a variety of small world setups. In maths, cars will be used for counting, sorting, number matching, lining up like a traffic jam, using big and small cars, creating cars using shapes and many more activities. Science will involve learning about force; pulling, pushing, magnetic force, gravity and friction. We will have fun exploring using these forces with our toys as well as listening to stories. Some great ones are available such as \"Duck in a truck\" and \"the Enormous Turnip\". In literacy, we have a new write dance where the children will learn to draw a car. Fine motor activities continue to have an emphasis on pincer movements to help the children develop muscles to use a pencil effectively. Our story sessions this half term begins \"The Journey Home from Grandpa's House\" and will lead on to \"The Naughty Bus\". To help the children, parents encouraged to take them on bus and train journey's, if you would like to see some boats there are local canals nearby where you can find colourfully painted barges. This half term we are using The Gruffalo as our topic base. We shall be reading the story in literacy and using the characters to create mark making patterns in write dance. In listening time we are going to try and mimic the sounds some animals make and we might even be able to make a noise up for the Gruffalo. Science will follow the same lead and week by week we shall be learning about different kinds of animals; mammals, birds, insects, fish as well as plants. We shall explore their habitats and see if we can make some ourselves. In cookery we are making different kinds of Pizza. As we have already made bread the children will be very used to making the dough, and each week we shall be adding a different topping. Hopefully the children will taste their pizzas in afternoon snack. We shall be learning three new songs this half term, in circle time we are singing Tommy Thumb, in literacy it is the Gruffalo Song, and in dance it will be Head to Toe by Eric Carle. You can find links to the last two songs below. PE this term is focused on dance and the children are learning to dance using ribbons to some Disney songs. This half terms topic is \"Where is Bear?\" The topic will see our bear who is called Barnaby, travel to different countries exploring their food, culture and art. We will role play packing for a holiday, getting on an aeroplane and Bear's birthday party. Our story for the first part of the half term is \"Room on the Broom\" by Julia Donaldson. Then for the last few weeks we shall be reading \"Hansel and Gretel\". In circle time we are beginning to learn about emotions, how them make us feel and an appropriate way to communicate how you feel. The children will learn the sign and the symbol for each emotion so that they can express themselves in their chosen way. We shall be using the Super Simple Song \"If you're happy, happy, happy.\" This half terms topic is \"The Jobs that People Do\". This is a fun topic with plenty of opportunity to play pretend and role play a number of different jobs. Included in this is Doctors and Nurses, Restaurants and Chefs, Hairdressers, Postman, Fireman, Policeman and Shop Keeper. Role play provides fantastic opportunities for communication, interaction, counting, turn taking, and many more occasions for learning . Our story this half term is all about change and growing up and what we could potentially be when we are older. It follows a boy who asks a rain drop, a caterpillar, a seedling, and a chick what they will be when they grow up. However, the boy decides, like most children, that he wants to be just like his dad! In cookery this half term we are focusing on baking bread – mostly rolls, creating a variety of shapes and creatures.

I write C# application, which gets orders from Ebay. The problem is I can get only 100 orders from getOrders.ApiResponse.OrderArray. I have about 1000 orders. How to get other 900? In another words, how to iterate through ebay orders by using HasMoreOrders call and Pagination.PageNumber? A: In the first GetOrders call itself you can find the total no of items and Pages in the result You should loop through each page & call GetOrders API call with different page number For(int index=0; index<Orders.Pages; index++) { // Build GetOrders Request with PageNumber - index // Call GetOrders API with page number // Manipulate result } A: The response itself contains the current page number and total number of pages. You will need to do a new request per page. Take a look at the following code I wrote to get all results from each page (this is with the Finding API, but works the same for all other eBay APIs): var response = GetResults(findingService, request, currentPageNumber); if (response.ack == AckValue.Success) { var result = response.searchResult; if (result != null && result.count > 0) { // TODO process result for (var i = response.paginationOutput.pageNumber; i < response.paginationOutput.totalPages; i++) { currentPageNumber += 1; response = GetResults(findingService, request, currentPageNumber); result = response.searchResult; // TODO process result } } } private FindCompletedItemsResponse GetResults(CustomFindingService service, FindCompletedItemsRequest request, int currentPageNumber) { request.paginationInput = GetNextPage(currentPageNumber); return service.findCompletedItems(request); } private PageinationInput GetNextPage(int pageNumber) { return new PaginationInput { entriesPerPageSpecified = true, entriesPerPage = 100, pageNumberSpecified = true, pageNumber = pageNumber }; }\n\n{'redpajama_set_name': 'RedPajamaStackExchange'}\n\n13\n\nCould Warren Buffet Be \"working on a (Chinese) railroad\" Investment? Back in the early 90s, when Warren Buffet owned a $1.5 billion position in McDonald's stock, he called my office and asked for a little help. It seemed that he and his friend Bill Gates and their families were planning a vacation trip to China, and had chartered a Chinese train to carry them across the country. Buffet was a McDonald's fan, and asked if we could guide him to our restaurants along his route. We helped make it easy for he and his party to drop in at a McDonald's whenever their hunger for hamburgers and fries arose. He talked about that trip for years. By 2008, Buffet had invested $200 million in Chinese transportation, in a major Chinese car company, BYD, which was developing technology and production capability to build electric cars. By the way, BYD means Build Your Dreams. Really. BYD is slow getting off the mark, but they may yet become a factor in the electric car revolution. Now, in 2012, Buffet appears on Chinese State Television, wishing the country well in their Year of the Dragon Chinese New Years celebration. And then he appears, in the same broadcast, playing his ukulele (http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2012/01/23/see-warren-buffett-sing-and-play-the-ukulele/) in front of a model railroad, singing \"I've been working on the railroad.\" With the background that we know Buffet likes trains, including trains in China, and that Berkshire Hathaway not long back invested $20 billion in the Burlington Northern railroad over here, I wonder if he's sending a signal that he may now be interested in getting financially involved somehow in the rails in China?\n\n{'redpajama_set_name': 'RedPajamaC4'}\n\n14\n\nGeneral (ASoIaF) A Song of Ice and Fire: The Novels Viserys's Gift By Lyanna<3Rhaegar, April 8, 2022 in General (ASoIaF) frenin 21 hours ago, John Suburbs said: No, they are not following Viserys. Few of them will ever even see him. They follow Drogo's general, and by extension, Drogo. As far as they are concerned, Viserys is just showing them where to plunder. And they cannot refuse to go, or else Drogo will slaughter them all and chop their bodies into little pieces and scatter them on the ground so they cannot ride the nightlands. That's all Illyrio needs, to get the Dothraki to Westeros. After that, Viserys is expendable. Drogo's general follows Viserys, ergo the rest of the army follows Viserys. And how come that few of them will ever see him? It's an army of 10k not a million and it only takes one of them for the word to spread. It's inmaterial imo because there's no dothraki, general or otherwise that's going to follow Viserys's orders anyway, it's a non starter not that Drogo would put his men over that position anyway, neither he nor his khalassar thought much of the beggar King. Perhaps that's why Jorah tagged along. Drogo would not even know Illyrio had Dany if he didn't offer her up. He's been paying off the Dothraki with far less than a Targaryen bride for years, so why would he even let him know he had her when he could just pay him off as usual? And if he is giving them both away just to prevent Pentos from being plundered, then why does he think he's getting an army out of the deal? A Targaryen bride serves to sweeten the deal even more, the Targlings are expendable and they serve to whatever scheme, high or low Illryrio wanted them to serve. Even if Illyrio did think he was buying off an army doesn't men that Drogo thought or was willing to sell off his army.. Which is why i think Varys and Illyrio orchestrated Dany's assasination attempt, in order to try and get Drogo to move his ass. Again, Illyrio didn't get to where he is in life by being trusting or foolish with has valuables. Even the greatests minds miscalculate. Fact is, Illyrio had little way to get Drogo to sail. The Dothraki do not sail. people ought to listen to Ned more. There is no reason to think Drogo would have gone back on his word had Viserys not threatened his unborn son. There's no reason to believe Drogo would have honored his word. In fact Drogo doesn't hint that he was considering the idea till his son and wife were endangered, he says he doesn't wanna and that's it. His son is going to plunder Essos. Dany's and Jorah's conversation also do not mention any change of mood from Drogo since Viserys's death. Lyanna<3Rhaegar John Suburbs 21 hours ago, frenin said: Sorry, no, you have it completely wrong. The general is only following Viserys to the plunder. He is not giving him command. And nobody would know that Vis was such a weak leader until they got to Westeros anyway, which is all Illyrio wants. The vast majority of grunts would only see him from a distance, and none of them speak his language, so as long as they win their battles, Vis is a strong leader as far as they are concerned. But as I said, once they ditch him, all the better for Illyrio, who has no intention of letting him take the throne. Illyrio is not stupid. Ned is. Illyrio has been dealing with Dothraki all his life. He knows what their code is. Drogo would have honored his word. We barely hear him speak about anything until the wine merchant, so just because we don't have a PoV confirming this means nothing. His decision after Viserys is dead is that he will not cross the poison water and neither will Rhaego. The iron chair is moot at that point, but there is no reason to think he would have gone back on his word to send others of his khal to Westeros. So what you characterize as a \"miscalculation\" by Illyrio would in fact be a bone-headed rookie mistake that is completely out of character for the man who fought and schemed his way up from the streets to become one of the wealthiest and preeminent figures in the entire world. 3 hours ago, John Suburbs said: But he is following Viserys, he's taking orders and advices from Viserys, if it's only to the plunder. Which again, not happening. Btw, the blood riders already knew Viserys was a little shit and were already mocking him. Dany followed on her silver, escorted by Ser Jorah Mormont and her brother Viserys, mounted once more. After the day in the grass when she had left him to walk back to the khalasar, the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal Rhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King. Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the next day, and Viserys had accepted. In his stubborn ignorance, he had not even known he was being mocked; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women giving birth, the very young and the very old. That won him yet another name: Khal Rhaggat, the Cart King. Her brother had thought it was the khal's way of apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah not to tell him the truth, lest he be shamed. The knight had replied that the king could well do with a bit of shame … yet he had done as she bid. It had taken much pleading, and all the pillow tricks Doreah had taught her, before Dany had been able to make Drogo relent and allow Viserys to rejoin them at the head of the column. Yeah... Not happening lol. Illyrio has been dealing with Dothraki all his life. Which leads to arrogance. Drogo would have honored his word. Drogo told Dany he had no intention to do so, post hoc reasoning doesn't change that. His decision after Viserys is dead is that he will not cross the poison water and neither will Rhaego. He doesn't have to tell Dany before because Dany only takes on Viserys's grievances and claims only after he's dead. Only after he's dead and Dany asks him what's up with the deal he made does Drogo state that he's bailing on that. The iron chair is moot at that point, It always was seemed so. If Drogo isn't crossing the poisoned waters for his own fated son, he's certainly not going to do it for a man his wife needs to give him blowjobs into treating to him like a person. by Illyrio would in fact be a bone-headed rookie mistake that is completely out of character for the man who fought and schemed his way up from the streets to become one of the wealthiest and preeminent figures in the entire world. Eh, people make mistakes, even rookie mistakes, no matter how capable and intelligent they are. It happens. But we have reached an impasse and I don't want to derail @Lyanna<3Rhaegar thread. Edited April 14, 2022 by frenin Well, if this is what you choose to believe -- that Illyrio is a simpleton who has somehow risen to immense power despite never having learned the basic lesson of not handing over your valuables in exchange for promises, not to mention Jorah who has lived with the Dothraki, ridden with them, learned their customs but still risks his life joining a plot that he knows will go tits up -- then c'est le. Queen of the Royal Heathens Location:Tower of Joy On 4/12/2022 at 12:32 PM, Hugorfonics said: Regarding the stallion, Drogo never mentions it. Him and Dany seemed to have a good marriage where their love transgresses disagreements and they wind up talking most things through together, Drogos injury, all the slaves, all the rape and destruction, etc. Neither mince words, so if Drogos actually this fundamentalist but who sees Jesus everytime he looks in the mirror, well I think we would have heard about that. Agreed, I don't think Drogo thought he was the stallion. A strong possibility is Illyrio doesn't know what he's doing. More like, shooting baskets with his eyes closed. He's got these Targaryens in his backyard and some Dothraki on his porch, maybe they can help Young Griff? It can't hurt. (Lol of course it does) Yes, or maybe he just isn't putting all his eggs in one basket. What did Drogo think, idk. He certainly knew Viserys was a king, king cart was his nickname after all. If I were to guess, it was on Drogos to do list but he probably didn't want to because Viserys was so annoying and he seemed to think Westeros is the size of Dragonstone and not really a priority or anything difficult that needs to be addressed thoroughly Sure, I think a gift for Viserys was probably on his to do list. If I had to guess the gift is probably not preplanned. Like Drogo doesn't say ok u give me this, I'll give you that. He may have known Viserys wished a crown or wished to rule the 7k & Drogo just thought if Viserys is worthy he will gift him something of equal value or something. OR Drogo may have thought the gifts he gave Illyrio made it a done deal. On 4/12/2022 at 2:58 PM, John Suburbs said: Of course he coveted a Targaryen bride. If he didn't want it he wouldn't have married her. She is blood of the dragon. His line can only be enhanced, if only in people's imaginations, by fathering sons on her. Sure, or maybe he just thought she was pretty. It's possible Targ blood & looks was thought to be something great among the Dothraki or to Drogo alone but we don't really know that. We don't hear one thing from any Dothraki, Illyrio, or Jorah saying the Dothraki or Drogo want a Targ bride. He may have been sold on having a young, beautiful bride. Yes, Illyrio has been dealing with Dothraki, and probably Drogo in particular, for quite some time. He would not do this if he wasn't absolutely sure that Drogo would deliver. He didn't get to where he did in life by being trusting or foolish. I agree Drogo & Illyrio had something worked out but it is only Illyrio who says it's for Viserys to have the 7k. It's perfectly reasonable to suspect that was never the deal from the jump, for all the reasons I've stated. Especially now that the fAegon plot has been revealed, why would anyone think Illyrio's plan for Viserys was to make him king? And even before that, we can see that Illyrio is pretty contemptuous of him. Viserys is not hard to read, and again, Illyrio would not be where he is today if he was not a good judge of character Hmm apparently I'm misunderstanding you because I agree, I think it's highly unlikely that Illyrio did want him to be king, it's one of the reasons I don't believe Drogo ever promised to conquer the 7k for Viserys. As I mentioned above, Viserys is not leading this army. He can't even speak to it. They will follow whatever bloodrider Drogo chooses, and their primary objective will be plunder. Viserys is the only one among them who knows where the good plunder is and who can find allies on the continent. And when it all goes tits up and they end up killing him in short order, well, that's all to the good because now there is a horde of Dothraki running amok in Westeros that fAegon can conquer. I honestly think that what's tripping you up is the idea that Illyrio wanted to put Viserys on the throne, but that idea has been eliminated. All Illyrio needs is to get the Dothraki to Westeros. 1. We don't have any indication khals ever make another blood rider a defacto leader to take off with part of their khalasar to plunder or conquer. In fact I would find this highly unlikely as it goes against the idea that the khalasar will follow the strongest - the blood rider is not the strongest. 2. Viserys does not have the slightest idea where any plunder is OR where he can find allies? Where did you get that from? 3. We have zero indication Drogo ever intended or was even interested in, let alone promised, to take his khalasar or send part of them to Westeros. We do have indication of the opposite. 4. Why would Illyrio want the Dothraki in Westeros? Iirc after he finds out Dany has hatched the dragon eggs & is planning on going to Westeros he tries to call her back to Pentos. If the plan was to hatch eggs with D & V, then why did he give all of this away to the Dothraki? That just means these rabid, mongol horselords now have dragons. The entire continent would burn. He has all the ingredients to hatch these eggs himself, so why wouldn't he just do it? Well I'm not sold on that idea either but he could have known via some prophecy that they would be hatched in the Dothraki sea. Or he just thought they were stone & never going to hatch. He can't hatch them himself? I would imagine it has to be a Targ doing it. Drogo only rejected the idea of he himself conquering the 7K and giving Dany the Iron Throne, and only after Viserys was dead. Once that happened, the deal was off and Drogo no longer had any skin in this game -- until the attempt was made on Dany No, he rejected putting his son on the throne. He said he has no need of it. The plan was never to put Dany on the throne. My issue isn't that he rejected only after V was dead, that's the first time it was brought up to him that we know of & so his first ability to reject it. My issue is that he, nor anyone else, even Jorah who speaks Dothraki, I'm pretty sure, ever mentions anything about any plan to go to Westeros ever. Not while V is alive, not after he is dead. When Dany says it to him his rejections make me believe he never had any intention on going there. We cannot cross the poison waters. How did he plan to cross them when he planned on going there with Viserys? If he had already planned it but nixed it because Viserys was dead, would that not be the reason he gave Dany? That Illyrio's plan was to put Viserys on the throne I'm in agreement here. And that he got conned by Drogo into getting his bride No, I don't think this either. I think Illyrio conned Viserys. Illyrio likely got exactly what he bargained for. It may have been only that Illyrio planned for D&V to die on the Dothraki sea & never thought those eggs would hatch, he just wanted them out of fAegon's way. On 4/8/2022 at 8:37 AM, Lyanna<3Rhaegar said: 1. Did Drogo promise anything? If so what? 2. Did Drogo even know Viserys expected an army or a crown? 3. What was in this for Illyrio? Some additional thoughts. I think Drogo in ASOIAF is like Prince Baelor in The Hedge Knight. He is in line to be king but he sacrifices himself so that someone else can move up in the succession. (In the Dunk & Egg story, Maekar moves up directly but I think Baelor's death is intended to indirectly move up Dunk - likely a Blackfyre dragon seed or prince - and Aegon V toward the Iron Throne.) Like Prince Baelor, Drogo is a larger-than-life, experienced leader. He suffers a wound that is not expected to kill him but it leads to his death. His actual death comes at the hand of a loved one. If you believe in the power of illustrations, the image of Baelor's death in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms shows a three-headed dragon hatching as the life leaves his body. This would be similar to Drogo's death at the moment the eggs hatch. I wonder whether the death of Viserys also relates to the death of Prince Baelor? He dies from a melted gold \"crown\" on his head. Recall that gold is associated with the coins known as gold dragons. (Even though the crown for Viserys is made out of gold medallions from Drogo's belt.) We know that Prince Baelor borrowed a dragon-shaped helmet for the Trial of Seven. Pate the armorer tells Dunk that fancy helmets don't protect as well as plain armor. (Dunk wears an egg-shaped helmet.) Maybe this also explains why would-be-kings die when they are crowned: the fancy headgear does not protect them the way a plain helmet (or shaved head?) would. Baelor dies from a gruesome head wound that is hidden until he removes the dragon-shaped helmet. Maybe that sets up a small contrast with the death of Viserys: Baelor dies when his helmet is removed; Viserys dies when his crown is placed on his head. If the Prince Baelor parallel is correct, I believe Drogo somehow knew (in his heart? subconsciously?) that he would be sacrificing his life to help Dany become queen. The promise was not to Viserys, but to Dany and (he may have hoped) his unborn son. GRRM sometimes uses a pair of items split from a single source (twins Jaime and Cersei, Lord Walder's castle called The Twins, the sword Ice split into two swords, Aegon the Conqueror having two wives, Sansa becoming Alayne, etc.) so it may be that Drogo and Viserys together are the equivalent of Prince Baelor in the Dunk & Egg story. I suspect that Illyrio knows that the dragon must have three heads. He may have suspected that Viserys was one of the heads, but he soon realized this was not the case. More likely, he knew that Aegon and Dany were two of the three he needed. The third one would be revealed in some way that fit the prophecy. I'm guessing that the death of Joffrey or the death of Tywin was the event that revealed Tyrion as the third head of the dragon. Or the revelation may have been something much smaller, such as Tyrion taking the poison mushrooms from Illyrio's garden. I'm sure the network of spies reported every little detail of Tyrion's behavior, and this small move sealed the deal for Illyrio. (The logic behind my thinking here is based in wordplay, so skip this part if you don't like literary analysis.) There is wordplay on \"champion\" and \"champignon,\" the French word for mushroom. Tyrion declines to be Joffrey's champion in the mummer jousting at the wedding feast. Tyrion also declines to eat mushrooms that Illyrio offers to him, suspecting that they are poison. Illyrio eats the mushrooms, apparently demonstrating that they are not poisoned. Oh well. Essentially, Tyrion turns down Illyrio's invitation to be a champion / champignon. BUT. Tyrion helps himself to mushrooms that he hides in his boot for later. This could demonstrate that he is a hidden \"champion,\" waiting for the right moment to use his \"gift.\" (\"Gift\" is the German word for \"poison.\") The champion, something hidden in the toe of a boot and even the foot inside of that boot may link back to symbols in the Dunk & Egg stories: Dunk wonders whether it would have been worthwhile to let Aerion cut off his foot, if it would have saved Prince Baelor's life. Egg hides a signet ring in his boot. (Does this relate to Illyrio's rings?) Prince Baelor agrees to be a champion of sorts in Dunk's Trial of Seven. Instead of wondering whether Drogo promised a gift to Viserys, we might do better to examine the gifts Illyrio gives to fAegon / Young Griff, Dany and Tyrion. Young Griff gets a shaved head and a fake father, as well as Septa Lemore, Rolly Duckfield (known as \"Duck\") and Yandry and Ysilla. Tyrion gets lots of food and a trunk full of used children's clothing. Dany gets a trunk full of fabric and three dragon eggs, Ser Jorah and a powerful husband. I still think that Illyrio's end game is to hatch dragons that will allow him to become the Kingmaker, putting his game pieces on the iron throne. I suspect that some of the things his players need to reach the throne are not things he can \"give\" them, however: for instance, each of Dany, Tyrion and fAegon find ways to acquire an army using their own strategies. Dany obtains the Unsullied, Tyrion the mountain clans (and maybe also the Second Sons) and fAegon wins over the Golden Company. Maybe the hollow promise to provide a Dothraki army in exchange for the sister of Viserys was the way that Viserys was exposed as a non-candidate for the Iron Throne. Among the Free Folk, a man has to \"steal\" a woman if he wants her. Viserys' failure to obtain his own army showed that he did not have the right stuff to become a king. Similarly, Joffrey received and demanded gifts but he was fairly passive in most aspects of combat or of ruling the kingdom. Do we seem similar \"obtaining an army\" moves by other characters? Jon Snow becomes commander of the Night's Watch and of a wildling army. Cersei revives the Warrior's Sons. Do the Faceless Men qualify as Arya's army? Is Lady Stoneheart at the head of the Brotherhood Without Banners army? Edited April 15, 2022 by Seams On 4/12/2022 at 4:56 PM, Evolett said: Well, legends die hard, histories and tales are passed on orally by unlettered people. Whey wouldn't the Dothraki have their own tales, stories, superstitions and prophecies about the Valyrians? The Valyrians were mighty and powerful, they rode dragons, they disintegrated in a fiery hell. Surely that is remembered and preserved in one form or other, hazy as it may be. The Targs tried again and again to hatch eggs as Stannis reminded us, and Rhaegar, an educated man, believed in prophecy, why not Drogo or the Dothraki? Daenerys handmaidens told her about the legend of Qarth, a tale presumably much older than Old Valyria, Jorah had heard the Stallion prophecy. If he was aware of it then Drogo must have been, though why he never mentioned it to his wife, I do not know. Perhaps they simply had too few words. Dany was the one doing her best to learn the Dothraki language Sure, they might have known but I don't think we can take it as a given since it's never mentioned. There is a hightend sense of expectancy here. Dany had successfully devoured the heart but was that enough? Drogo is nervous and tense, there is complete silence. The reader doesn't know what's coming next but Drogo's tension reveals that whatever the crone does or says next is of great importance to him personally. I also find it interesting that Daenerys is allowed to name the child. It's a pity we don't know more about Dothraki customs. Drogo seemed well pleased with Dany's choice after she explains Rhaego is named after her warrior brothe I thought they always knew the dosh khaleen were going to give a 'prophecy' after Daenerys ate the heart? I figured that's why they were all silent & tense - because they didn't know what was to come. Imagine had the prophecy been true & that's what came out of their mouths, that both Drogo & his son would be dead before long. Yeah, he says it's a good name but a Dothraki would think a son named after a warrior would be a good name, right? Besides the element of secrecy, there's the question of security, should dragons actually hatch. We later find out that the Yunkai lust for dragons and can imagine that there are many the world over who would like to own such a beast and who would be prepared to fight a war over ownership as well. A strong khal with a great khalasaar, one personally invested in the prophecy would be a better guarantee against such threats than say Illyrio hatching dragons in his backyard. The khalasaar disbanded after Drogo's death but before the three dragons saw the light of the world. Only a paltry few remained with Dany. What would have happened had the dragons hatched prior to that? More bloodshed, I imagine, with differing motives. Makes sense. Definitely a possibility. In the event that Illyrio led Viserys into thinking he would receive an army in return for his sister, I wonder if Illyrio lied to Varys about the army as well. If so, why? Possibly because he knew that revealing any plot to hatch dragons might alienate Varys? Varys must have been familiar with Targ attempts to raise dragons and probably also knew that sorcery was involved. He hated sorcery and magic because of his own first hand experience with it and might not have approved at all. Whatever the details, I think the idea that Illyrio concieved a plan to hatch dragons and deluded Viserys to get him to part with his sister for an army has merit. GRRM usually gives a hint or two regarding hidden plots within the story. How about this one: This is Viserys talking to Daenerys shortly before she meets the Khal: Evolett 1 hour ago, Seams said: Theon only has a few men with him when he takes Winterfell. Asha fails to bolster his forces because she doesn't think his capturing Winterfell deep in the North was a good idea. In the end Ramsay disguised as Reek offers to provide an army: \"And now, my sweet prince, there was a woman promised me, if I brought two hundred men. Well, I brought three times as many, and no green boys nor fieldhands neither, but my father's own garrison.\" Theon had given his word. This was not the time to flinch. Pay him his pound of flesh and deal with him later. \"Harrag,\" he said, \"go to the kennels and bring Palla out for …?\" Ramsay didn't want Palla, though she was the agreed price. He demanded Kyra. Then began Theon's downfall and ordeal, losing his newly won title, his manhood and even his identity for a while. So it would indeed seem that not being able to raise an army by one's own strength or wits has dire consequences. Similar theme with for Stannis who cannot win men to his cause and resorts to killing his brother via Mel's shadow. He does succeed in winning some Northern houses after heeding Jon Snow's advice.

Illyrio stressed that Viserys should chill at Pentos (like one of his \"not slaves\"), Im thinking this is because Illyrio wants credit for the gift, or at the least merge him and Viserys together in Drogos mind. So it might actually have been the right move for king cart to ride with the Dothraki, but ride, not cart lol. I wonder if Viserys was more like Jaime warrior level, would Drogo have actually been inclined to repay his brother in-law.

Yo @Seams I gotta a question (which obviously is open to everybody) (it's not really relevant...) Do you see any parallels with Drogo and his Red burning and Theon and his Smiler burning?

I agree the Dothraki would stay true to their word but I don't think it's possible he promised to deliver the 7k. If he had why did he act like the idea was so absurd when Dany suggested it after V's death? Also, his khalasar is already 40,000 strong. Viserys was just musing that he could take the 7k with 10,000. The Dothraki are dangerous customers. Magister Illyrio Mopatis is not foolish enough to misrepresent the agreement if it were not as he said. It is very possible to deliver the 7K, tied with a pretty bow, to King Viserys. Moiraine Sedai 17 minutes ago, James Arryn said: Word, figured something like that. I was just fucking around Viserys was their best chance at the time to take Westeros. Propping up Aegon is a lot harder because his identity is in doubt. Viserys is known. He doesn't have to be a good general. He only needs to have the right lineage. 10 hours ago, Hugorfonics said: Do you see any parallels with Drogo and his Red burning and Theon and his Smiler burning? It's just a horse in fire is such a weird yet powerful image and for it to repeat in back to back books, at the end... well, your better at this stuff then me I wish I knew. That does sound like deliberate juxtaposition by GRRM. We could have separate threads to discuss burnt horses, smiler symbolism (which is paired with \"slayer\" symbolism because Stannis asks Jon Snow whether he would prefer a smiler or a slayer to be the new lord of Winterfell) and Drogo/Theon parallels and we probably still wouldn't get to the bottom of the possibilities. Your question does raise an interesting point I hadn't considered: I have a hunch that Drogo and his stallion are reborn in the pyre; brought to life in a new way. It may be that Dany has somehow made Drogo immortal and he becomes the sun that rides a horse across the sky (much like Apollo in his chariot). But I always thought that the burning of Theon's horse, Smiler, represented the end of Theon's life as he knew it. Now I wonder whether I was looking at it the wrong way. Could the burning of Smiler also represent a rebirth for Theon? Theon with his uncle Aeron and Jon Snow with his uncle Benjen both are told that they are too green and they need to change. I wonder whether the burning of Smiler relates to a \"coming of age\" moment for Theon that is like Jon Snow's rites of passage among the Night's Watch? The Ironborn don't have much use for horses but Smiler dies quite awhile after Theon has been given command of a ship. So it's not an immediate trade-off between his life on dry land and life at sea. Jon Snow doesn't have a horse that burns but he does ingest the blood of the shaggy garron that goes lame when he is ranging with Qhorin Halfhand. Maybe the burning of Jon's hand is equivalent to the burning horse symbolism. (Barbry Dustin says that Lyanna and Brandon were both half-horse.) Relating the horse question back to the central topic here, though: Dany receives many wedding gifts; Viserys does not receive wedding gifts. GRRM goes to some trouble to explain that Joffrey and Margaery receive separate gifts - all of the gifts enumerated in the Tyrion POV (or is it the Sansa POV?) at Joffrey's wedding feast are groom gifts for Joffrey alone. And I found it significant that no one gives Joffrey a horse. He gets riding boots, a saddle, a tent to use at tourneys but no horse. By contrast, Drogo's wedding gift to Dany is her \"silver,\" the unnamed horse that she immediately brings to a gallop and jumps over a fire. As others have pointed out, instead of riding a horse, Viserys walks after he attacks Dany and she orders that his horse be taken away as punishment; then he rides a cart, which is even a worse debasement. I guess my point is, in addition to gifts promised to Viserys, we should look at the things he was not given or that were taken from him. Dany also tries to give him an appropriate outfit to wear in the desert which he rejects. Compare this to the trunk full of clothes that Illyrio gives to Tyrion or the fabric he gives to Dany. Are there other gifts rejected by, or taken from, Viserys? Hugorfonics and Lyanna<3Rhaegar Nice symmetry. Drogo may have \"known\" the way Dany \"knew\" how to hatch the eggs, right? Indeed. I've often wondered if part of the dragon needing 3 heads thing is the sacrifice to hatch them, like you need 3 dragons to sacrifice to hatch the eggs. Makes things a little sticky if we think Rhaegar was having children to sacrifice them to hatch eggs though. Still could happen. There were 3 deaths associated with the hatching of the eggs, though that gets all muddied in my mind too. It makes sense to me the sacrifices that gave life to the eggs are Rhaego, Drogo, & Viserys. The dragons are even named after them right? But Viserys's death was before this & doesn't seem associated really. Where does MMD's death fit in? Does it have to be a loved one, or sacrifice of the person hatching the eggs? Maybe the death doesn't matter proximity wise, just that the hatcher has sacrificed. I do hope Tyrion is the 3rd head. But would also love the irony if it turned out Tyrion was Tywin's only true born child. Ohh I like this. Indeed. Possibly Illyrio was more than happy to help Viserys along with his army but knew he would either sink or swim. It was a nice surprise when Viserys obviously wasn't going to work but then Dany worked things out on her own. I don't think the faceless men qualify as Arya's army, not yet anyway but yeah LSH has her brotherhood without banners, Drogo had his own army until he died. Stannis parallel's Viserys in a way I think, he is trying to get his own army but isn't super successful about it & seems to need Jon's help quite a bit. Mance had? has? his own army of sorts. We may see Bran with an army of children of the forest or something. Oh, I think so. I think if Viserys had turned out to be the dragon he claimed to be he would have found himself in a much better situation. He could have been \"reborn\" in the Dothraki sea, instead it was Dany. Hey don't let NN hear you! Wonder if she is still around the forums? haha ikr? I see some parallels but hell if I ever know what they mean. 20 hours ago, James Fenimore Cooper XXII said: What consequence would Illyrio suffer for misrepresenting the agreement to Viserys though? Viserys could not sweep the stables with 10,000 brooms, right? I don't think Illyrio misrepresented anything to Drogo or the Dothraki. It's certainly possible but I don't think Illyrio would have wanted Viserys as king to the 7k anyway, why would he? Plus, as I said, had Drogo promised to deliver the 7k in exchange for the marriage the conversation he later has with Dany about conquering the 7k would have been very different IMO.\n\n{'redpajama_set_name': 'RedPajamaCommonCrawl'}\n\n15\n\nWFMU is an FM non-commercial radio station broadcasting at 91.1 MHz.

The designers of the Russian Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet, including Director of the Sukhoi Design Bureau Mikhail Strelets, stated that U.S. F-22 Raptor can't be used to air-to-ground and support ground operations. According to Russian specialists, who developing Su-57 multi-functional aircraft, the US-made F-22 fighter jet is don't capable of effectively accomplishing missions to destroy ground targets. US Raptor aircraft that are focused only on specific tasks of air combat. Why the United States doesn't export the F-22? SU057 fighter jet is capable of effectively accomplishing missions to destroy both air and ground targets as compared to the US aircraft that are focused only on specific tasks, the Sukhoi chief designer said. \"The F-22 was initially developed as an aircraft to gain air superiority. But eventually, the Americans realized that it was essentially wrong to design the aircraft only for carrying air-to-air missiles and made an attempt to fit air-to-surface weapons into the existing configuration of its compartments. But the configuration of the compartments did not allow placing larger cargoes,\" Director of the Sukhoi Design Bureau Mikhail Strelets also said in a live broadcast of the Zvezda TV Channel on Friday. Russia's cutting-edge Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet incorporates the functions of the US F-22 and F-35 fighter planes but outperforms them, Chief Designer – Mikhail Strelets added. The designers of the Su-57 (PAK FA, the Prospective Airborne Complex of Frontline Aviation) faced the task of developing a multi-functional aircraft, he said. \"Regarding the load, the plane can carry to its weight, the greater this ratio, the higher the plane's quality from the viewpoint of the carrier. The same relates to the volume and the weight of the arsenal of weapons placed in its internal holds. And it can be said that by this indicator the Su-57 has no rivals among fifth-generation planes,\" Strelets stressed, noting that the PAK FA was also unrivaled by its acceleration capabilities. \"It so turned out and we didn't choose this especially but if you sum up 22 and 35, you get the figure 57,\" the Sukhoi chief designer said. It remains unclear what the Director of the Sukhoi Design Bureau meant, but the well-known that F-22 Raptor was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but also has a ground attack, electronic warfare, and signal intelligence capabilities. For its support ground role, an F-22 fighter jet can internally carry two 1,000 pound-class GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) with the Global Positioning System-guided or eight 250 pound-class GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs, two AIM-120C, and two AIM-9 missiles in the internal weapons bay. Also on F-22 can be fitted four under-wing pylon stations to carry weapons, each with a capacity of 5,000 lb (2,270 kg). However, if mounted, external hardpoints will compromise the stealth of the fighter. The pylon itself is designed for minimal impact on aircraft performance. If it becomes necessary for the pilot to jettison the external stores, the entire pylon is jettisoned along with the tank or missile launch rails. The pylon has an aft pivot, so when the stores are jettisoned, the forward attach point is released first, the pylon rotates on the pivot, and then the aft pivot is released. This motion allows the pylon, along with the tank or launch rail to clear the aircraft when it is released into the slipstream. It is also worth recalling that F-22 complete its first combat mission in 2014. The mission involved targeting and striking an ISIS command and control building in Syria. According to news reports, the mission was a success.

It also has over 130 specialty shops and boutiques and an eight-restaurant food court. Owned by Cominar Real Estate Investment Trust, one of the largest diversified real estate investment trusts in Canada and the largest commercial property owner and manager in Quebec, Centre Laval serves the shoppers of the Montreal area and numerous visitors. Centre Laval opened in 1968 with a Famous Players theatre, Woolco and Steinberg's department stores. A 1972 mall expansion was anchored by The Bay. Other expansions followed culminating with the present size in 1988. Centre Laval has seen a lot of changes. In the early 1990s, the Famous Players theatre was expanded to twelve screens. Club Biz (now Staples) occupies the former Steinberg's space and Woolco was taken over by Walmart in 1994 after F.W. Woolworth Company sold Woolco to Walmart. The cinema space is now The Brick and a Future Shop while Best Buy took over the former Bouclair space. Music World and Palais des Copains video arcade have closed. The Scotiabank branch, an original anchor in 1968, moved to the Quartier Laval open air shopping centre across the street. In 2012, Walmart left Centre Laval to relocate as a Walmart Supercentre. Its site at Centre Laval was cleared to make room for a new Target store.\n\n{'redpajama_set_name': 'RedPajamaC4'}\n\n19\n\nI recently needed to watch files for changes and had a chance to play around with using the WatchService functionality in JDK 7. As is generally the case with Java, the API requires you to jump through a number of hoops to do anything, but turns out that it's possible to wrap it up into something reasonable in the end. The WatchService can be used to watch directories and provides different types of events, such as create, modify, delete, and overflow. The first three are self-explanatory and the last is a special event that's triggered when an event might have been discarded or lost. What we'd like to do is create a function called watch that accepts an input path along with event handlers for each of the above events. Now that we have a Path and a WatchService, we can register the service with the path to listen for the events we specify. To handle this, I ended up creating a map with the keys representing the events and the values being the event handling functions. When the event is triggered we will receive an instance of the WatchEvent. So, the handler functions should accept it as the parameter. The watch function will register the events we passed in, open the watch service and then call the watch-loop function to do the actual watching. The watch-loop starts each iteration by calling take on the watch service. This method blocks until it receives an event, the service is closed or it's interrupted. Once we receive an event we can look it up in our options map and call the handler for the event. Finally, we need to call reset on the key before we start the next iteration. That's all there is to it and the full source for the example can be seen here.\n\n{'redpajama_set_name': 'RedPajamaC4'}\n\n20\n\nBand Director Tom Patterson, Tom Patterson, Tom Patterson Band Director, TomPattersonBandDirector Round Rock Band Director Tom Patterson Studies the Blues Roots of Rock 'n' Roll In Music on March 23, 2010 at 2:00 pm According to Tom Patterson, the band director at Deerpark Middle School in the Round Rock district, World War II was one of the most culturally and socially significant events of the last century. Tom Patterson is a band director in the Round Rock district who enjoys the study of history through the lens of musical forms. Band director Tom Patterson recently explained that the Second World War brought tremendous social upheaval in its wake. One of the cultural responses to this social upheaval, noted the Round Rock band director, was a popular music explosion known as rock 'n' roll. Artists like Bill Haley and Chuck Berry, said band director Tom Patterson, were at the forefront of the rock 'n' roll revolution. Tom Patterson told interested Round Rock students that rock 'n' roll was built on the musical accomplishments of blues, jazz, and swing. Band director Tom Patterson also noted that the electric lead guitar characterized this musical era. Today, the band director from Round Rock added, any typical rock 'n' roll ensemble sports a lead guitarist. Round Rock's Tom Patterson said this formula arose out of the blues guitar tradition. Round Rock band director Tom Patterson further explained that the blues guitar established its role as a strong solo instrument with the help of electricity. Electricity made the guitar a truly modern instrument, said Tom Patterson. B.B. King was a seminal figure, continued the Round Rock band director, elevating the electric blues guitar to a revered position in modern blues. Tom Patterson also said that the blues guitar became a premier solo instrument, even competing with the singer for the audience's attention. Performers and audiences alike, wrote Round Rock band director Tom Patterson, flocked to hear the electric blues guitar sound. Once the blues went electric, elaborated Tom Patterson, the rock 'n' roll revolution was not far behind. The Round Rock band director described droves of American citizens coming home after the Second World War looking for more out of life. Tom Patterson pointed out that new inventions, like radio, TV, and rock 'n' roll created a modern cultural environment where Americans could explore and test their boundaries. Band director Tom Patterson concluded that the success of this movement was evident in the classic rock 'n' roll of the 50s and 60s, from Elvis to the Beatles and beyond. Tom Patterson, the Band Director at Deerpark Middle School, has been passionate about music for as long as he can remember. Deerpark's Band Director Tom Patterson played with the University of Texas Orchestra and The University of Texas Wind Ensemble.

Buchwald This week's parasha, parashat Kee Tisah, features the infamous sin of the Golden Calf. The Al-mighty is so angry with the People of Israel that He wishes to destroy them and make a new nation out of Moses. Moses, however, pleads with G-d on behalf of the Jewish people, eventually convincing G-d not to destroy them. In Exodus 32:11-13, the Torah records Moses' extremely moving appeal: וַיְחַל מֹשֶׁה אֶת פְּנֵי השׁם אֱ־לֹקָיו, and Moses pleaded before the Lord his G-d, and said, \"Why, Lord, should Your anger flare up against Your people, whom You have taken out of the land of Egypt with great power and a strong hand? Why should Egypt say: 'With evil intent did He [G-d] take them out, to kill them in the mountains and to annihilate them from the face of the earth?' Relent from Your flaring anger and reconsider regarding the evil against Your people. Remember, for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Yourself, and You told them, 'I shall increase your offspring like the stars of heaven, and this entire land of which I spoke, I shall give to your offspring and it shall be their heritage forever.'\" At this point, the Torah in Exodus 32:14, reports that the Al-mighty reconsidered the evil and the punishment that He intended to visit upon His people. Rashi, citing Tanchuma 24 and Shemot Rabba 44:4, elucidates the finer points of the argument that Moses presented to the Al-mighty, and explains why Moses invoked the merits of each of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Moses says, \"If You, G-d, are angry because the people have transgressed the Ten Commandments, remember that their forefather Abraham was tested with ten trials and he has not yet received his reward for passing them. Give Abraham his reward by allowing these 'ten' to cancel out those 'ten.'\" Furthermore, says Rashi, Moses argued that if the Children of Israel are doomed to burning because of their sin, remember that Abraham gave himself over to be burned for Your sake in the fiery furnace in Ur Kasdim. Moses persisted and said to G-d, \"If the People of Israel are fated to be killed by the sword, remember that Isaac stretched out his neck to be slaughtered at the Akeidah. And, if the people of Israel are condemned to exile, remember that Jacob went into exile to Haran.\" Unwilling to concede, Moses continued arguing, saying that if the Israelites cannot be saved by recalling the patriarchs' merit, how then can You [G-d] say to me, 'and I will make you (Moses) into a great nation'? If a chair with three legs [Abraham, Isaac and Jacob] cannot stand before You at the time of Your anger, how will a chair with one leg [Moses] be able to stand? In this manner, Moses invokes זְכוּת אָבוֹת, the great merits of the patriarchs, asking G-d to consider those merits and save his brothers and sisters who had sinned. Moses' defense of the People of Israel won the day for the Israelites who were taken out of Egypt. More importantly, his plea to G-d on behalf of the people has served as a paradigm for many righteous leaders of Israel who have intervened on behalf of the People of Israel throughout the generations in the hope of assuaging G-d'"
