        "text": "After months of leaks and teasers, Samsung tonight officially unveiled its next-generation range of Galaxy phones.\n\nThe Korean firm ditched its trademark plastic casing for both models and has added a curved screen to the Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nThe flagship models both have 5.1-inch displays with the world’s highest number of pixels-per-inch (PPI), meaning tiny details on photos and videos can be seen with unprecedented clarity.\n\nThe phones are also the first to feature dual-standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets.\n\nAnd Samsung said at the launch event at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona tonight that it has reduced the amount of bloatware on both handsets by a staggering 40 per cent.\n\nDavid Kang, vice president of online at Samsung Mobile, told MailOnline: ‘We’ve created not only what’s next for the industry but set a new standard for smartphones.’\n\n‘We believe consumers and business alike will be impressed by the design but equally they’ll be taken by the power and performance.\n\n‘What we’ve accomplished is an elegant balance between design and technology.’\n\nThe majority of the other specifications were leaked before Samsung’s Unpacked event in Spain.\n\nIn particular, the curved screen on the S6 had been rumoured since the launch of the Galaxy Note Edge last year.\n\nOn the S6 Edge notifications appear on either the right or left-hand side, depending on which hand the owner uses.\n\nUp to five contacts can be programmed to appear on this edge, and each contact is assigned a colour.\n\nTo access a contact, users swipe the relevant colour and this reveals recent interactions and details about that person. Conversely, swiping the long edge of the screen shows the time, weather or other customised notifications.\n\nAnd when the phone is placed face down the edge glows to show a phone call, text or email has been received. If these messages are from a saved contact, the edge will glow the relevant colour.\n\nPlus the curved screen increases the viewing width and height of videos and photos to make them appear 3D.\n\nThe S6 and S6 Edge will be available from 10 April in colours White Pearl, Black Sapphire. Gold Platinum and Blue Topaz. The S6 Edge will additionally be available in Green Emerald.\n\nIn a surprise move, Samsung also used the event in Barcelona to unveil its next-generation virtual reality headset.\n\nIt announced the Gear VR last year and its latest model, called Gear VR Innovator Edition, builds on the technology in the original version.\n\nConsequently its still powered by Oculus Rift technology but the Innovator is 15 per cent smaller than the Gear VR.\n\nOptimised to work with the latest S6 and S6 Edge handsets, the Innovator has reduced pixilation to make images appear more realistic and a wider field-of-view.\n\nSamsung has also redesigned the Innovator model to give a better weight balance making it more comfortable to wear.\n\nA release date and price are yet to be officially announced.\n\nElsewhere, Samsung itself teased the introduction of the wireless charging chip in a blog post.\n\nUntil now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the ‘magnetic-inductive’ method of charging.\n\nThis involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers.\n\nThere are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP).\n\nSamsung is a member of all three groups.\n\nAbout Post Author"
