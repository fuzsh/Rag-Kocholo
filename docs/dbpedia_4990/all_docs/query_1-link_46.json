Application issues might manifest as network issues. Finger-pointing and cycles wasted searching for the source issues can lead to prolonged service disruptions that ultimately damage the revenue and reputation of the business.\n\n● Gain hop-by-hop visibility into the network underlay, including detailed path and performance metrics\n\n● Measure and proactively monitor SD-WAN overlay performance and routing policy validation\n\n● Determine the reachability and performance of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and internally owned applications\n\n● Establish network and application performance baselines across global regions before, during, and after deployment of SD-WAN to mitigate risk and establish and validate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n● Lower the Mean Time To Identify (MTTI) the causes of issues, with fast root-cause isolation and intuitive, easy-to-understand visualization of the entire service delivery chain.\n\n● Eliminate wasteful finger-pointing: Correlate visibility across the application, hop-by-hop network path, underlay and overlay performance, and internet routing to immediately isolate issues to the right problem domain (network or application) and responsible party (internal team or external service).\n\n● Enable effective escalation, with concrete proof to successfully escalate issues to providers and effectively manage Operational-Level Agreements (OLAs) and Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)\n\nThousandEyes collects multilayer telemetry data from vantage points distributed throughout the internet, as well as in enterprise data centers and cloud, branch, and campus environments, providing detailed metrics from between those vantage points and applications and services distributed throughout the globe. The result is real insight into application experience and every underlying dependency, whether network, service, or application related.\n\nFor more information, see https://www.thousandeyes.com.\n\n● Existing ThousandEyes customers can use their available ThousandEyes license and units toward new tests.\n\n● New ThousandEyes customers will need to purchase a ThousandEyes license to activate the ThousandEyes agent.\n\nLicensing\n\n● Cisco DNA Advantage with Network Advantage.\n\nFor a more detailed overview of Cisco Smart Licensing, go to cisco.com/go/licensingguide.\n\nFor SD-WAN, the bandwidth tier is metered by WAN traffic (encrypted or not). For Routing, the bandwidth tier is metered by IPsec. For example:\n\n●Tier 5 (WAN traffic): IPsec throughput is Unthrottled/Unenforced 50 Gbps full duplex, 100 Gbps aggregate.\n\n●Tier 4 (WAN traffic): IPsec throughput is Throttled 25 Gbps full duplex, 50 Gbps aggregate.\n\nApplication hosting\n\nPython programmability allows users to control devices running Cisco IOS XE by running Python code that makes use of APIs. It has multiple use cases, such as:\n\n● Interactive Python prompts\n\n● Running Python scripts\n\n● Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager\n\n● Zero-touch provisioning"
