        "text": "Ahead of their official launches, new smartphones are often outed by developers, case manufacturers or, on the rare occasion, an eager factory worker.\n\nSamsung’s next two smartphones, the Galaxy S6 and the curvy Galaxy S6 Edge, are due to be officially unveiled next week Barcelona during Mobile World Congress.\n\nBoth Galaxy phones have purportedly been outed in the weeks leading up to the event, but both haven’t been photographed together – until now.\n\nAccording to Sam Mobile, it is clearly visible from the leaked image that the display on the side of the Galaxy Edge doesn’t function independently from the main screen – rather differently to Samsung’s Galaxy Note Edge.\n\n“This hints at a different approach to how the Edge displays will be used. These displays will possibly work separately when needed, like showing notifications when the device is locked with the screen off,” Sam Mobile wrote.\n\nWe’ve already seen large number of leaked images showing off the Galaxy S6 sans curve – the images might well be the real deal, but there are a number of elements on the body that seem incomplete or experimental.\n\nEarlier this week is was also revealed (via a mobile operator) that the 128GB version of the Galaxy S6 Edge will retail for about $1 100, while the straight S6 will be $100 less."
