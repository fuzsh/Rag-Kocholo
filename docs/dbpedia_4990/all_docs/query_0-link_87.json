Where’s my smart home? The probiem with the internet of Things The amazing tabiet Nokia doesn’t want you to buy WELCOME PAGE Welcome! BY THE TIME you read this, it will be around two-and-a- half months since Windows 10 was finally released. We saw our first set of Windows 10 desktop PCs last month, but it’s taken a bit longer for the first laptops to arrive. It seems it has taken manufacturers a little more time to get Windows 10 working properly with the wide variety of modern laptop designs, with their high-pixel-density displays and detachable touchscreens. Enough Windows 10-certified laptops have now arrived for us to put together a comprehensive group test. One of the laptops we’ve tested this month ships with Windows 10, while the others come with Windows 8 and, with one exception, upgrade flawlessly to Microsoft’s latest operating system. We’ve reviewed powerful general-purpose models, versatile convertibles, incredible-value netbooks and a selection of hybrids: PCs that are both a tablet and a laptop in one. With prices from £160 to £700, there’s a specification and design here for you, starting on page 78. Gordon Moore. Businessman, Intel co-founder, multi-billionaire. He’s quite a chap, but he’s probably best known for his eponymous Law. The gist is that the number of transistors on a mainstream processor, and therefore the chip’s processing power, will double every year. This prediction has held remarkably true for half a century - but is it really a prediction or, if the processor industry actually saw the Law as simply a target to follow, did it hold back progress? We investigate, starting on page 94. From operating systems to smartphones, the tech industry certainly loves a bit of hype. Recently, a great deal of buzz has surrounded a three-letter acronym: loT, or the Internet of Things. This is the process of connecting everyday objects to the internet to enhance their capabilities; from washing machines to heating controls to light switches, the loT is meant to bring you a fully-connected smart home to make your life infinitely easier. But where are these smart homes? Outside of purpose-built show homes, we’ve never seen one. From page 102, we investigate why the smart home and the Internet of Things have been so slow to take off, and see if the loT is destined to remain the Next Big Thing in perpetuity. Chris Finnamore, Editor chris@computershopper.co.uk QUESTION OF THE MONTH Following on from Moore’s Law, what tech laws do you think will hold true for the future?

I was rather dismayed to read in your Windows 10 article (‘The Ultimate Guide To Windows 10’, Shopper 332) that Microsoft is offering the upgrade from Windows 7 or 8 “for the life of the device”. I have a number of PCs, all running Windows 7. So far I’ve only upgraded one to Windows 10 to try it out, as I really didn’t like Windows 8. The upgraded PC is a Dell Inspiron 1525 dating from October 2008, which originally shipped with Vista. As the machine is now seven years old, how long can I run Windows 10 before Microsoft deems in its wisdom that my laptop has reached “end of life”. Moreover, how will it determine that? Will I suddenly switch the machine on one day to find that it won’t launch Windows? This will be well after the one- month trial, so a simple rollback to Windows 7 won’t be an option. As I did a fresh install of Windows 7 on a new hard disk (the previous HDD had failed), I could still reinstall Windows 7, but the hours of downloading all the updates, not to mention my installed programs, fills me with dread. That’s if the updates to Windows 7 are still available. Do you know what Microsoft means when it says “for the life of the device”? Until I have more information about this upgrade and the implications for the future, I think I’ll hang back and see what happens. Brian Jones The muddied waters around this issue are finally starting to clear. In effect, Microsoft has committed to supporting Windows 10 until 2025. There’s a caveat to this support, however. You will need the latest version of Windows 10 installed in order to receive updates (as is the case with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1). These updates will be free but, according to Microsoft, “A device may not be able to receive updates if the device hardware is incompatible, lacking current drivers or otherwise outside the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (“OEM”) support period.” Essentially, if your computer’s manufacturer has decided not to release device drivers for a certain version of Windows 10, you won’t be able to upgrade, and at some point will no longer be able to receive security updates. What we really need to know is how often Microsoft will release major new versions of Windows 10 that are sufficiently different to require new drivers. We very much doubt that Microsoft will suddenly pull the plug and stop you logging into your PC, though. DRIVER ME CRAZY Just over two years ago I bought a Dell XPS 2710 direct from Dell, together with its three-year premium support, having seen a review in Computer Shopper. I bought the computer because I wanted a premium future-proof all-in-one that would last a long while, and because I don’t subscribe to the Apple philosophy of control. Although I didn’t think Windows 8 was as bad as many people believe, I did look forward to the introduction of Windows 10 and its philosophy as an evolving operating system. So A lack of drivers for Windows 10 may be beyond Dell’s control when Windows 10 was released I waited eagerly for the Windows app to tell me that the system was ready to install. However it was not to be. Dell in its wisdom has decided not to update the drivers of the XPS 2710 and even goes so far as to advise its customers not to install Windows 10 on this computer. I have tried both its support and customer service people to find out why Dell isn’t prepared to support the upgrade on what is, after all, a fairly new premium consumer computer, but the only response I’ve had is that this PC was built for Windows 8 and Dell won’t support such an upgrade. No one can say why and no one is prepared to do anything about it. I don’t know if Computer Shopper can find out anything more from Dell, but the company’s attitude and indifference to the needs of its customers is disappointing to say the least, and it’s surely bad business practice to abandon key customers. I, and many other people, will not be recommending Dell in future. Nigel Hartley It seems that the 2710 requires several drivers that are not present in Windows 10. Some people have tried to install Windows 10 from scratch, and with some success, but problems have been reported with everything from the touchscreen to the wireless card, so we wouldn’t recommend it. It’s a disappointing situation, which reminds us of Intel’s failure to provide Windows 8 drivers for a number of its graphics chipsets. Dell does have an excuse in that it doesn’t actually manufacture many of the components inside its computers or write the Windows drivers. If Atheros, which apparently makes the 2710’s wireless card, hasn’t released a Windows 10 driver, for example, Dell won’t be able to provide one on its website. We agree that it’s frustrating, but the best thing to do is wait and see if the relevant drivers become available. Windows 8 will be supported until 2023, so at least you won’t have to worry about security updates. FOIBLE FIXING I Having bludgeoned 1 my way through Microsoft’s attempts to stop me upgrading to Windows 10 (first no Windows 10 system tray icon, then the message “The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error 6 DECEMBER 2015 COMPUTER SHOPPER ISSUE 334 policomp ★ star letter WIND-WOES Having upgraded five different computers to Windows 10 over the past couple of weeks, I thought I’d write and share my experiences. The short story is that so far not one has gone through and been working 100% correctly at the end. Some have had problems I’ve been able to fix or work around, but I can imagine a typical person would be struggling and frustrated. The first to be upgraded was an old HP desktop that I had running the Insider Preview version of Windows 10. It worked fine for the primary user after the upgrade, but the second user had the US keyboard layout applied. No amount of fiddling with the settings has fixed this yet, but it’s the sort of thing you can live with and I haven’t spent much time on it. The second installation, on a six-year-old Dell Studio desktop, seemed to go well until I tried to set up a second user account. This resulted in an error message when I tried to log in to the new account, with no folders created for the new profile. Apparently, you have to create the account before performing the upgrade, or do a clean install and start again. Be warned. I’m living with one account on this PC for now. The third, an Acer Aspire netbook, also seemed to go well, until the user tried opening and resaving some documents. This revealed that the file permissions on the user account were all messed up and the folders and files seemed to be read-only. Trying to change the status of the files didn’t help, so I tried the security settings for the folders, giving the user full access instead of the restricted access indicated in the table. This didn’t work either. The fix I found for it was to copy all the files to a memory stick, delete the originals and move the Documents folder to a new location before moving the files back again. Unfortunately, the problem came back after a reboot. The only sure and easy way to fix it and some of the other problems was to restore Windows to its factory defaults and start over again. The fourth PC, a 7in Connect Windows 8.1 tablet, also suffered from the file permissions problem. The fifth one was a relatively new Toshiba C50D-B-120 laptop. On this one the touchpad and buttons stopped working after the user logged in, but fortunately the temporary work around was to plug in a mouse, and the fix was as easy as downloading a more up-to-date driver from Toshiba’s website. No appropriate driver was available from Microsoft. So should you upgrade or not? I leave it to you to decide, but don’t expect an easy ride. Peter Key That’s quite a selection of problems, and certainly far more than we’ve experienced in the office. We covered the most common problems in our feature last month (see ‘Windows 10 Fixed’, Shopper 333), but as your letter shows, there’s always more ground to cover. If any readers would like to write in with their upgrade problems, we can address the most common ones in Computer Shopper's How To section. ujuuuj.pQlicomp.co.uk Tel; 01270 898104 PRICE MATCH AN7 SYSTEM AMD Koveri Evolution - KAVl AMD Aia-?7i **O.Cto4Ghi' Asui AaaxM’Pius CRUCIAL SGB I^DCmI SEAGATE SSHD ITS AMO Rsdeon H7 Graphics ZALMAN Z3 Casoff HPMJ tlo £499.99 AMD Namesis Cube - NEMl jIqiA( 4 B5DK Black ASUS PLUS FM2* CRUtf^GB l€ODlVtti£ aEAGAApnB iATAi HDD 370 4GS Pfodicv M Case ASUS 24'*HPMILED £599.99 INTEL i5 Devil Bloster - HASO INTEL Core IS * *0X70 4.45 ASUS 297 CRUCIAL 9GB DDRJ SEAGATE SSHD 1' AMD B7 370 ZALMAN Z3 C&is ^ ASUSW' HDT^LEP , £699.99 during boot operation” when I installed), I quickly found three fundamental flaws in the operating system’s default state that would leave a novice floundering. First, the default email application offers only a conversation view, which quickly had me confused, with lost emails and drafts in my Sent Items folder. A novice user will struggle with that, and won’t know how to resolve it (is there an alternative app that offers a simple list of emails?). Second, the default browser provides very limited options as to what happens when you open a new tab. Granted, a novice might not use tabs, but if they do, they’ll struggle to fix that (install another browser, and make it the default). Third, searching is tied to Bing, a search engine that your recent research showed housed adverts linking to malware. I tried selecting the option to change the search engine, and it offered me the alternative of - you guessed it - Bing. Now, I’m sure that somewhere in Control Panel there’s a way of installing an alternative search engine and making it the default, but again, a novice user will give up at the point where they’re offered Bing or Bing - if they even realise they need an alternative. So there we have it. A novice user who upgrades to Windows 10 will be stuck with an email app they can’t use, a browser that annoys and a potentially dangerous search engine. While I suspect Windows 10 is a good upgrade once you’ve resolved these sorts of issues. I’m surprised that your reviews and articles to date haven’t even mentioned them. Most of your users aren’t novices, but many of us are the people novices turn to for advice, and if you recommend Windows 10 without qualification, so will we. If we’re going to look good, we need you to tell us the truth. Graham Hodson These aren’t so much problems with Windows 10 as annoyances with some of the applications that come with the operating system. One of the advantages of a PC (compared with, say, an iPad) is that it’s incredibly simple to install alternative applications if you don’t like the ones supplied with the operating system. For example, no-one in the Shopper office uses Edge as their main browser, preferring Chrome or Firefox instead. The problems you mention above are easy to fix, however. To disable the conversation view in Mail, click the cog at the bottom-left to open the Settings menu, click Options and under ‘Show messages arranged by conversation’ slide the switch to Off.

The search engine page you’re currently on will be listed at the top. PUSH Y PATCHES Your ‘Windows 10 Fixed’ article (Shopper 333) was welcome, but I feel that another feature of this OS should have been mentioned, namely Automatic Updates. This is set to enable Microsoft to download and install updates in the background with no intervention from the user. I object to giving third parties carte blanche to install whatever they like on my computers, so have always chosen the option to ‘Inform me when updates are available but let me choose when to install them’, available on previous Windows versions. This doesn’t seem to be available any more, unless it’s well hidden, and a brief trawl on Google came up with several solutions, some a bit flaky and others involving going into the Registry to make alterations, which I don’t really want to do. Surely there must be a more elegant solution to this lurking within the bowels of the OS, as Faster fibre is rolling out, but some green boxes will never be upgraded I’m sure I can’t be the only one concerned about this? Richard Najduch We agree that this is an odd choice from Microsoft, but it may be fundamental to the way the operating system works with its rolling upgrades. One method is to tick the Defer upgrades box, which will at least postpone major changes. We’d recommend leaving Automatic Updates turned on, though, as an unpatched Windows installation is open to all kinds of malware. GREEN WITH ENVY when I read news items like ‘BT trials 330Mbit/s G.fast fibre’ (News, Shopper 333) it makes my blood boil. In 2010 fibre cables were laid in our village and parts of the village now have superfast broadband. On the other hand we have a small BT box near us that Open reach has said may never be upgraded due to its size. BT should make sure as many homes as possible get a decent broadband speed before rolling out faster speeds to those who already get high speeds. My average broadband speed with BT is 1.5Mbit/s so the fastest I get is 2.5Mbit/s if I’m lucky. This rarely gives me a good steady picture on Chromecast for BT Sport, the only way of getting its sports channels without fibre. Mike Rose BT evidently feels it can make more money selling ever-faster broadband to high-density areas than making sure rural dwellers have half-decent broadband. As we showed in our ‘Fibre for all’ feature (Shopper 324), sometimes the only way is to bypass BT and set up a company to lay fibre yourselves - or even set up a high-powered wireless network to cover the parts of the village that can’t get fibre.

The chief mundane mission this month has been dealing with a wasps’ nest. The nest is in a shed at the back of the office where we keep any packaging awaiting recycling. It’s a huge nest, filling a box that contained a wall rack cabinet. I still had some wasp spray that worked well on a similar nest last year. Hoping to repeat the feat, I sprayed it into one of the box’s hand holes - but after three splutters it gave up. A trip to B&Q was fruitless, so I ordered a great big can from eBay. Having taken the first step to solve my mundane problem, I turned to the strategy problem. Decent commercial offerings for development are few and far between, so I’ve been playing with Python and Python-based web frameworks. Progress has The staff are whingeing about wasps so I decide to try dumping some ant powder through the hole in the box been a case of two steps forward, one step back - and sometimes one forward and two back. Web2Py looked promising but turned out to be hopeless. Experiments with Django have been more productive but I still keep hitting ‘environmental’ issues that make life difficult. I’ve come to the conclusion that much of this is due to Windows just not being a natural home for serious Python use. Most of the books and tutorials, both in print and online, use Unix or Linux examples. If there are any Windows references they’re often inaccurate, out of date or a half-arsed fudge. Some Windows procedures only seem to work if you wait for the full moon, then dance naked while singing Fight The Good Fight backwards. I could put Linux on a spare machine but that would mean having another screen on the desk or creating X-Terminal links, as you would when working with a ‘crustless’ Raspberry Pi (see Under Development, Shopper 304). HYPER-VENTILATION I ask engineer Garry if he has a virtual machine with Linux already installed. /Vlirabile dictu - he does. The bad news is that he prepared it using Microsoft’s Hyper-V, and I run VMs on the Lenovo using VMware. No problem, says Garry, just go into Control Panel and enable Hyper-V. Well, I would if the option were there! I’m running Windows 8 Home, and you need Pro to run Hyper-V. It’s a choice between forking out £100 for an upgrade that turns Hyper-V on or devoting precious time to creating an Ubuntu VMware installation. I opt for the easier route. Garry says he’ll do the Windows 8 Pro update while I deal with the wasp nest. He knows which tasks to pick. Ten days after ordering the wasp spray from eBay, it still hasn’t arrived. Meanwhile the staff are whingeing about wasps so I decide to try dumping some ant powder through the hole in the box. That significantly stems the volume of wasps flying out of the hole. Then I get a long pole, poke it through the hole and carry the box out at arm’s length to the far side of the car park bordering a field. I was only stung once in the process. When I return I find Garry’s still ‘upgrading’ the Lenovo. The screen is blue with a message that says ‘restarting your system’. After 45 minutes it still says ‘restarting your system’ and the infuriating circle of marching dots is going round and round. This icon is virtually useless. All it tells you is that the hardware is on and possibly doing something. Microsoft’s progress bars may offer laughably inaccurate time estimates but at least you know you’re not stuck in an endless loop going nowhere. We decide on a forced reboot. After a tense 15 minutes we finally get a logon screen. Phew! Regular readers will remember the horrors suffered last year when a Microsoft update killed my previous laptop, so you can understand the apprehension. Enabling Hyper-V was simply a matter of going to Control Panel and ticking a box. The only configuration I had to do was to set up a virtual network card in Hyper-V’s manager panel. Almost worth £100. Under Ubuntu I was able to construct a Python virtual environment, download Django, the Edge extension and PostgreSQL and construct a skeleton website in no time. Trying that in Windows 8 had involved days of faffing and failing to produce an acceptable result. The hunch about moving the development tests to Linux proved a good one. WIND DOWN WINDOWS I’ve heard mixed reports about Windows 10 and some horror stories about upgrading from 8, so I’m seriously considering testing Ubuntu for general use on the Lenovo. Many of the applications I use are available on Linux - OpenOffice, Thunderbird, Chrome - but others, such as Ecco and Cakewalk Sonar, are not. Decisions, decisions. Maybe the answer is another VM. At least I solved the wasp problem. My errant eBay spray can finally arrived, just in time for next year.

Most of you will have seen reports of a group of hackers calling themselves ‘The Impact Team’ who released details of 33 million accounts allegedly registered with the online infidelity site Ashley Madison. Apparently the hackers took exception to the dubious morality of a website that encouraged its members to commit adultery and stole a reported 300GB of data. The Canadian police are conducting enquiries into the hack as well as the subsequent release of members’ account details. Having worked closely with the Mounties in the past, I know them to be efficient, cyber-savvy and extremely persistent. It’s true: they always get their man (or woman). However, in reality there are far more breaches, where web servers are hacked and stolen account details are posted, than those we read about in the papers. On the side of the good guys are a number of ‘white hat’ researchers who make it their mission to identify potentially vulnerable websites and contact site administrators to warn against the flaw, so giving them If you run a small business and you don’t have a large cybersecurity budget, relatively low-cost assistance Is available the opportunity to plug the security hole. However, there would also seem to be a large number of commercial sites whose administrators are more concerned with the bottom line than the security of their users. This situation was brought to my attention recently when one of my contacts in the cyber- intelligence field called to ask what I thought about a post he had found on www.pastebin.com. For those of you who haven’t heard of it, pastebin.com is one of a number of pasting sites that have long been used by members of the programming community to post plain text (known as ‘pastes’) and to share source code or other coding snippets. However, the ability to use the site anonymously made the site a bragging ground for hackers. My contact had found what appeared to be the contents of an insecure server. The paste included full details of emails, usernames, passwords and orders made with a particular small business in the UK. My friend’s dilemma was whether he should inform the data owner of this compromise, and we agreed that letting the company know was the best thing to do. FUEL INJECTION We then contacted the third arm of our security triumvirate: another trusted colleague with extensive experience in the identification and remediation of server breaches. He was able to quickly identify that the business server was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. He thought it highly likely this kind of attack had occurred, resulting in the attacker being able to bypass the normal admin login and access the company’s database directly. This tale has a bittersweet ending; our server expert was able to advise the company as to how to beef up the server to reduce the chances of attacks like this happening in future, but this still left the business owner with the prospect of contacting his compromised customers to explain what had happened. I hope this chap doesn’t suffer too much reputational damage. Let’s face it, the real problem lies with his web host, not with him. The business concerned was operating in the same way as hundreds of other small businesses; growing its customer base and concentrating on delivering its core services to the best of its ability. The problem is that, with no available budget for cybersecurity and an absolute requirement to operate using the internet, businesses such as this are ripe for targeting by the small-minded yet tech-savvy idiots seeking to increase their ‘kudos’ rating among their equally small-minded peers. JUST THE ESSENTIALS A government initiative, called Cyber Essentials, aims to raise cybersecurity levels within organisations. The initiative is backed by the Federation of Small Businesses, the CBI and a number of insurance organisations who offer incentives for businesses that implement the scheme. Cyber Essentials is described as low-cost and light-touch, and defines a set of controls which, when properly implemented, provide organisations with basic protection from the most prevalent forms of internet-based threats. In particular, it focuses on threats that are widely available online and require low levels of attacker skill. Businesses are independently assessed and then helped to achieve certification, so demonstrating to potential customers that they are safe to trade with. I anticipate that this basic standard of business cybersecurity will become mandatory in certain areas, particularly when dealing with government contracts. If you run a small business and you don’t have a large cybersecurity budget at your disposal, therefore, relatively low-cost assistance is available. Go to www.gov.uk and use the search term Cyber Essentials: there’s plenty of worthwhile reading there. Let’s face it: it’s unlikely my friends and I will be around with free advice should you be the next unfortunate victim of a data breach.

Windows The need to have their desires satisfied has landed would-be adulterers in hot water, gamers in plot limbo and Shopper’s editor in a cavernous shopping centre in Purley jViel Croucher Technology has long been used to exploit male urges for profit, but Mel advises men to keep their hands well out of their pockets THE FACT THAT many men use technology for sexual frisson is nothing new. And neither is the fact that their search for sexual gratification is used to rip them off. It’s a voluntary testosterone tax. As a lad I remember aching to see my first photo of a Completely Naked Lady, as advertised on the grubby card of a peep-show machine at the dark end of the local pier. Eventually, I summoned the courage to insert my sixpence, which was quite an investment back then. I slid the nickel-plated shaft into the oiled slot of the device, and when the observation shutter fell open, there she was in all her glory. A crummy little black and white postcard of The Birth Of Venus, painted by Sandro Botticelli in 1485. rd been swindled by the arcade management, by the content provider and by my own crowded trousers. Which brings me to the biggest alleged swindle of modern times: Ashley Madison. IVe taken considerable time and effort to examine the hacked database of this adulterers’ website, which boasts such gloriously inappropriate advertising as “have an affair, guaranteed,” along with “100% Discreet Service”, “Trusted Security Award” and “this is a Secure Site”. I make no judgement about the men who seek extra-marital sex via this network, other than that they are as daft as I was when I spent my sixpence. So let’s start with the money. They used to say “a penny for your thoughts,” but dirty thoughts cost a lot more these days. Men are charged a basic £39 to introduce their member to the online world of Ashley Madison, and £179 for “Affair Guaranteed Membership”. The same services are free for women, which is where the obvious clue lies. In an echo of cynical children’s apps designed to extort additional revenues, men are encouraged to buy virtual gifts and pay for virtual chats to boost their chances with women who may, just possibly, be cartoons. And the gullibility of these men is almost overwhelming. Ashley Madison declared revenues of £79,844,503 last year. Of the detailed data and personal messages I saw concerning 39,855,361 profiles, 4,594,069 claim to represent women. Of these alleged women 4,085,458 show a zero default entry on their account timestamp, meaning their creators have never used the site. That could suggest that around half a million supposed women are putting it about with 35 million men using the database, which would be a bit tiring. But more detailed analysis shows the number of genuine women who check bona fide messages is far lower. In other words, most of the female accounts are alleged to have been faked. Perversely, since the Ashley Madison hack and adverse publicity, hordes of new male members have signed up. The swindle of the testosterone tax hasn’t changed, but the scale has mushroomed from a handful of sixpenny bits to way over eighty million quid. That’s progress. 14 DECEMBER 2015 COMPUTER SHOPPER ISSUE 334 RANTS & RAVES Chris Finnamore Internet shopping is all very well, but for babies - not known for their ability to defer gratification - sometimes only a shop will do WE’VE JUST HAD a baby daughter. I won’t bore you with the details, but she’s small and eats a lot. One immediate consequence was that I had to do a lot of shopping. No matter how well prepared we thought we were, with piles of mismatched clothes, second-hand prams we didn’t know how to put up and 600-page parenting tomes to read, there were, inevitably, plenty of things missing. This led to a mad dash up and down the Purley Way the day after we came home. The Purley Way is a large out-of-town shopping area south of London, with every major chain represented on a huge scale. However, the main thing this shopping trip taught me, apart from to avoid Ikea at certain times of the day, is that physical shops are being left to rot. One item in particular rammed the point home. We needed a nursing pillow. This is shaped like a broken doughnut (or a flattened horseshoe) and fits around mum’s waist to prop up the baby during one of her absurdly frequent feeding sessions. The Purley Way has a Mothercare, a Mamas & Papas, a John Lewis Home and a Babies R Us - all places you’d expect to find such an item. Indeed, go to their websites and there’s a huge selection available. With this in mind, I walked into Mothercare expecting to find a ward of nursing pillows, a Gregg’s of doughnuts, a smithy of flattened horseshoes. What I found was a space on a dusty shelf with a sad-looking price sticker and no product. Mamas & Papas was even worse: rarely have I seen such a cavernous space devoted to so few objects. I understand that shelf space is limited. I understand that businesses have to devote resources to their online offerings. But please don’t forget your physical shops. There are plenty of people out there who can’t wait three days for a parcel. Tom Morgan & Katharine Byrne Are gamers’ expectations reaching crazy new heights just as publishers are losing interest? NOT SINCE THE heady days of Pac-Man, where the 256th level couldn’t be played due to limitations in the 8-bit level counter, have we seen so many blatantly unfinished games. Part of the problem is technology, part is the way games are currently funded, and part is a combination of the two. PCs and consoles are so powerful that it’s possible for games to have astounding production values, but lush and detailed 3D environments don’t create themselves. Armies of modellers and artists are needed, and this adds a fortune to production costs. This was the case with Frozenbyte’s Trine 3, which arrived with fewer levels than players were expecting - mainly because the developers had spent most of their time and money making the switch from the 2D platforming that made the first two games so popular to new 3D environments. This was disappointing, as we noted in our review (see Shopper 333), as the game ends just as the story starts to get going. Sometimes a publisher simply loses faith in a game or developer and pulls the plug, as happened with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (see page 62). While a lot is still unknown about Konami’s public parting with Metal Gear developer Hideo Kojima, it seems his departure left its mark on the game’s final act. If the abrupt ending to the game’s second chapter wasn’t bad enough, it’s since been uncovered that a third chapter was in the works, which was completely cut from the final game. Rumours are circulating that Konami is finding it increasingly difficult to make a profit from video games, and that it had decided it had pumped enough money into Kojima’s grand vision of an open-world Metal Gear Solid game. When the company that finances your games decides that its future is in mobile content and Pachinko machines for japanese arcades, there’s little to do but wrap up as best you can and hope gamers will understand. And here’s the rub: gamers don’t always understand. Indeed, when most games these days are billed as bigger and better than their predecessors, it’s not surprising that fans have come to expect so much - which makes it all the more frustrating when those promises can’t be delivered. There’s also the fact that development of some titles is part-funded by gamers through pre-purchase or early-access schemes such as Kickstarter, which means they feel they have a stake in a title. As events have shown, however, meeting such expectations isn’t always possible. Some optimists hang their hopes on downloadable content (DLC) to finish the story, but Trine 3’s cash-strapped developers have said this won’t happen, and with cult Metal Gear developer Kojima firmly extracted from Konami HQ like a soldier strapped to a Fulton balloon, it seems fans of both games will be left wondering what might have been. E ISSUE 334 COMPUTER SHOPPER DECEMBER 2015 15 Computer Shopper rounds up all the highlights from this year’s IFA show in Berlin SONY to be seen whether 4K will be worthwhile on such a small screen, as we found that it gave diminishing returns when we held the phone at a normal viewing distance. Still, Sony is confident that its 3,430mAh battery will sustain the phone for the same length of time as the Xperia Z5 and Z5 Compact, claiming up to two days of normal use. It comes with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor and 3GB of RAM, as well as a 23-megapixel camera. Here the Z5 Premium lays claim to another world record, as Sony says the camera has the world’s fastest autofocus, clocking in at just 0.03 seconds. Another big addition is Sony’s super slim fingerprint sensor, which is built into the power button on the side of the phone. Sony has yet to announce pricing for the Z5 Premium, but we wouldn’t be surprised if it were considerably more expensive than the 5.2in Xperia Z5, which has only a 1,920x1,080 resolution. Still, if 4K sounds like overkill, the Z5 and Z5 Compact - which has a 4.7in, 1,280x720 display - share many of the same specifications as the Z5 Premium, including its chipset, camera and fingerprint sensor, so you won’t miss out on much if you opt for one of Sony’s smaller models. ACER’S BUILDING BLOCKS Earlier this year, the release of Acer’s Revo One mini PC proved that you don’t need to sacrifice storage space to fit a full computer in a case no bigger than a biscuit tin. Now Acer has gone one further with the Revo Build, a modular mini PC with interchangeable upgrades for adding extra storage, connectivity and even external graphics without compromising on size. The base unit will be available first, with modules appearing for upgrades. Modules stack on top of each other with magnets and pogo pins, so there are no unsightly external cables to worry about, and with a 125mm square footprint it won’t take up much space on a desk either. Inside it has an Intel Pentium or Celeron processor. IFA IS ONE of the biggest consumer technology shows on the planet, with major manufacturers from all over the world turning up to Berlin’s Messe to reveal their latest products just in time for Christmas. This year, there were more new devices on display than ever before, and we were there to see them all. SONY SQUEEZES IN MORE PIXELS We’d thought Samsung might be the first company to release a 4K smartphone this year, but Sony has beaten it to the punch with its brand-new Xperia Z5 Premium handset. Launching in November, the Z5 Premium is the world’s first 4K smartphone and will play big brother to Sony’s other new flagship devices, the Xperia Z5 and Z5 Compact, both of which are due out this month. To make the most of its 3,480x2,160 resolution, Sony has fitted the Xperia Z5 Premium with a large 5y2in display, giving it an insanely high pixel density of 806ppi. That’s more than twice as sharp as the iPhone 6 Plus, which also has a 5y2in screen but a resolution of 1,920x1,080. However, it remains ^ The gold version of the Xperia Z5 Premium has a mirrored rear panel, adding a further touch of class to the handset’s design Acer’s modular PC is incredibly flexible, allowing you to add more components simply by stacking them one on top of the other The base unit is equipped with HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet and two USB3 ports, as well as 32GB of storage, but two of the first modular upgrades will be external HDDs. A slightly more off-the-wall inclusion is the wireless charging dock, which sits on top of any Revo Build stack and adds a wireless charging pad for giving compatible phones a power boost when their battery is low. You can detach the base and take it with you too, as it has its own internal battery. There’s no word on prices for the upgrade modules, but the base unit is set to arrive across Europe this month, with prices from €199 (around £146) depending on hardware. LENOVO MIXES IT UP It may look eerily reminiscent of Microsoft’s Surface Pro 3, but Lenovo’s new IdeaPad Miix 700 is a decidedly more budget-orientated two-in-one tablet device. With US prices starting at $699 (around £460 excluding VAT), the Miix 700 will be available in a range of specifications, including one of Intel’s new Skylake-based Core M processors, up to 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of SSD storage. While it’s unlikely to match Microsoft’s Surface Pro 3 for raw processing power, the Miix 700 more than makes up for this with its DECEMBER 2015 COMPUTER SHOPPER ISSUE 334 4 From the outside, the Miix 700 looks almost identical to Microsoft’s Surface Pro 3 large 12.1in, 2, 160x1, 440-resolution display, and its height-adjustable kickstand should allow plenty of flexibility when you want to switch between laptop and tablet mode. We don’t yet know if Lenovo will charge extra for the detachable keyboard, but like Microsoft’s Touch Cover keyboards, it has a magnetic strip across the top that snaps on to the bottom of the tablet to provide a raised typing angle. As for connections, the Miix 700 has two full-size USB ports - one of which doubles as the power supply - a Mini HDMI output and a microSD card slot. A 4G version will also be available, and some models will include Intel’s depth-sensing RealSense 3D cameras as well. Still, it’s a huge improvement over previous Gear watches, and it comes with a full range of sensors, including an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, heart rate monitor and an ambient light sensor. You can also answer or dismiss calls from your wrist, and those who pair it with a Samsung smartphone can take advantage of the Samsung Pay contactless payment system. As well as two buttons on the side of the watch for stepping back through menus and returning to the home screen, the Gear S2 has a rotating bezel for controlling the interface. Turning this one notch to the left displays notifications, while rotating to the right flips through your widgets, including weather, music controls, calendar appointments, activity statistics and any third-party apps you’ve installed. Samsung’s S-Health activity tracker, Twitter and Nike+ Running are just some of the apps confirmed so far, and car manufacturers including VW and BMW are on board with plans to use the Gear S2’s NFC capabilities in forthcoming vehicles. With a 250mAh battery, the Gear S2 should provide between two and three days of general use, according to Samsung, but with 10 brightness levels available, it could potentially last much longer. When it does eventually run out of power, you can charge it with the supplied wireless charging dock. Samsung has yet to announce pricing for the Gear S2, but it will begin shipping this month. The launch will be staggered, and the UK isn’t guaranteed to be first on the list, but the device should be available here soon. PHILIPS LIGHTS THE WAY I FA is typically a very TV-heavy technology show, and Philips went all out this year, showing off its incredible new 65PUS8901 4K Ambilux model. Ambilux is the next step up from the existing Ambilight ambient backlighting technology Philips has been using in its TVs for years, only this time the LEDs have been swapped for tiny projectors that expand what’s onscreen out to the wall behind it. It works brilliantly in games and with sports, and you feel as if the action is exploding out of the screen and into the room. More importantly, Philips hasn’t had to make the panel any thicker - the 65PUS8901 is still less than a centimetre thick. The polished chrome ‘Bladewire’ stand puts two sculpted feet at the sides to keep the set upright, but you can wall-mount the TV and still enjoy the full effect of the projectors. The Ambilux TV is due to arrive in the UK and throughout Europe towards the end of the year. Philips hadn’t yet released any prices, but they’re likely to be towards the top end of Philips’ price structure. ♦ Instead of LED lights. Philips has installed tiny pico projectors on the back of its Ambilux models to extend its light show even further SAMSUNG GEARS UP There were plenty of wearables on show this year too, but top honours go to Samsung’s Gear S2. This is Samsung’s first circular smartwatch, but unlike its previous watches, you don’t need a Samsung phone to use it. Samsung says it will be compatible with almost any Android device that has 1.5GB or more of RAM and runs version 4.4 or above. It still needs to be running certain Android APIs, which may rule out older devices, but Samsung has yet to provide a complete list of compatible handsets. THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES NEWS Apple launches iPhone 6s, iPad APPLE ANNOUNCED A whole range of new products at its recent press conference in San Francisco. As well as two updated iPhones, Apple also unveiled its long-rumoured iPad Pro, its biggest iPad to date, and a new version of the Apple TV media streamer. BITE OF THE BIG APPLE Available around the world from November, the iPad Pro has a massive 12.9in, 2,742x2,048 resolution display. This is large enough to fit two iPad Airs inside it when the device is lying in landscape mode, effectively giving you enough space to run two full-screen iPad Air apps side-by-side without forcing them to run at a reduced scale in iOS 9. That’s a lot of screen to play with, but the iPad Pro’s main party trick comes in the form of its variable refresh rate. By monitoring what’s onscreen, it can tell when your screen is static and will automatically halve the refresh rate to 30Hz, helping to save energy. It will then raise it back up to 60Hz when it detects video, for example. Inside, a 64-bit A9X processor has twice the memory bandwidth of the ASX used in the iPad Air 2. It also has twice the graphics performance, thanks in part to Apple’s new Metal programming language. There will be two storage options at launch (32GB and 128GB), and both should deliver around twice the storage performance as the iPad Air 2. Essentially, it’s more than fast enough to run two iOS apps at once, or render a single powerful 3D app with more detail or more polygons than any other iOS device to date. There’s also room for a four-speaker system. With a driver at each corner, the iPad Pro can automatically balance the audio depending on how you hold it. The left, right, top and bottom channels will adjust to sound in both portrait and landscape modes. Despite the performance improvements and bigger screen, the iPad Pro should still be able to deliver 10 hours of continuous use on a single charge. You also get 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and an 8-megapixel iSight camera on the back of the tablet - the same sensor as the one seen in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. PENCIL PUSHER To make the most of the Pro’s screen, Apple is releasing a number of optional accessories to go with it, including the Apple Pencil. Despite Steve jobs’ famous dismissal of the technology, this digital stylus can be used for drawing and note-taking. It charges via a Lightning connector on the end of the pen, and should last up to 12 hours on a single charge. When you’re out of power, you can plug the Pencil into the iPad Pro’s Lightning port to draw extra juice from your tablet. Apple also announced a physical keyboard for the iPad Pro to turn it into a fully mobile workstation. Dubbed the Smart Keyboard, this uses the same shallow dome switches as the latest 12in MacBook, giving plenty of tactile feedback while still enabling you to type quickly. It also shares power and data with the iPad Pro using a new magnetic Smart Connector. It’s a similar setup to the Magsafe power connector on the MacBook, meaning you don’t need to unplug anything or worry about wrenching cables apart if you disconnect the tablet in a hurry. UK pricing has yet to be announced for the iPad Pro and its various accessories, but there will be three models available at launch: an entry-level 32GB, Wi-Fi-only model for US$799; a 128GB Wi-Fi-only model for $949; and a 128GB Wi-Fi and 4G cellular model for $1,079. The Apple Pencil will cost $99, while the Smart Keyboard will cost $169. SlRl-AL KILLER Apple’s next big announcement came in the form of a new Apple TV. The current model was released way back in 2012, so an update has been long overdue. The box itself is almost exactly the same size as the previous model, but inside it’s all new, as it comes with Apple’s brand-new operating system, tvOS. The interface looks very familiar to the existing Apple TV Ul, but it’s a little brighter and a little cleaner. Navigation is handled by a new remote control, which has a touchpad rather than a control dial like an old iPod. This should make it easier to fast-forward and rewind through films and TV shows with a simple left or right swipe. The remote uses Bluetooth 4.0 and has an integrated battery that lasts around three months. Cleverly, it’s charged via its Lightning port on the bottom. The 2015 Apple TV also has Siri integration, so you can launch apps and control playback using the remote’s microphone. You can even use natural phrases such as, “Siri, I missed that”, and it will automatically jump back 15 seconds and turn on subtitles when you’re watching a film. To find your chosen content, Siri will search across multiple apps, including iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Showtime (although the latter three are only available in the US). However, Apple has said it will be integrating more services in the future. DECEMBER 2015 COMPUTER SHOPPER ISSUE 334 Pro and Apple TV Finally, the 2015 Apple TV has its own app store. Previously, Apple TV had only a handful of locked-down services that came pre- installed, but now you can download all sorts of apps, such as Airbnb and various games. It’s not yet clear whether catch-up TV services and rival media-streaming apps will follow, but we have every hope the Apple TV app store will be better stocked than the Android-based Nexus Player or the popular Roku 3. As for hardware specs, the 2015 Apple TV is powered by a 64-bit A8 chip and has an HDM1 1.4 output for Full HD (1,920x1,080) playback. It also has Bluetooth 4.0 support, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a Fast Ethernet port on the back for anyone who wants a wired connection. UK pricing wasn’t available at the time of going to press, but in the US it will cost $149 for the 32GB version and $199 for the 64GB model when it arrives. TOUCH AND GO Last but certainly not least, Apple also announced a new pair of iPhones: the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. According to Apple, these are the most advanced iPhones yet, and add a wave of new features, including 3D Touch and Live Photos. From the outside, both phones look almost identical to their predecessors. The iPhone 6s still has a 4.7in 1,334x750 display, and the iPhone 6s Plus continues to loom over its little brother with its massive 5.5in 1,920x1,080 screen. They are, however, a fraction fatter than before, with the iPhone 6s measuring 7.1mm thick and the iPhone 6s Plus stretching to 7.3mm. This is likely to go unnoticed in daily use, but the reason behind this increase in size is so that each phone’s screen will be able to accommodate Apple’s newest, and arguably most exciting feature: 3D Touch, a mobile version of Apple’s Force Touch technology that we’ve seen in the Apple Watch, the new MacBook and MacBook Pro. With more sensors packed inside the touchscreen, the iPhone 6s can measure the microscopic changes between the cover glass and the backlight, providing faster, more accurate responses to each press. 3D Touch also allows you to interact with your apps in new ways. For instance, apply pressure to an app icon on the homescreen and it will open a popup window of options, letting you perform tasks faster without opening the app itself. For instance, rather than open the camera app III rinju ‘i9 ri^Anblh^ CFOira. ♦ The 2015 Apple TV has an updated interface, new hardware and a brand-new remote control ♦ In addition to the standard, gold, silver and space grey models, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will also be available in rose gold to take a video, 3D Touch allows you to jump straight to video mode from the homescreen. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus also have a brand-new processor: the A9. This has an all-new transistor architecture to make it faster and more energy efficient. The M9 motion co-processor is also embedded right into the A9 chip to provide always-on Siri. Another new addition is a 12-megapixel iSight camera. This lets you capture both HD and 4K video content, as well as 63-megapixel panorama shots. 3D Touch will work with your camera, too, creating Live Photos. These are essentially short videos that capture the moments before and after each shot, allowing you to create moving images, which you can then share with your friends. The only mildly disappointing thing about the new iPhones is that they will still come in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models, dashing any hopes we had of an entry-level 32GB version. Still, at least Apple hasn’t increased the price of each phone, as both will retail for the same prices as the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. For the iPhone 6s, that’s £539 for the 16GB model, £619 for the 64GB model and £699 for the 128GB model. For the iPhone 6s Plus, it’s £619 for the 16GB version, £699 for the 64GB version and £789 for the 128GB version. Both phones are available now, and we’ll bring you a full review next month. 967 . SAVED ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION WITH WORKFORCE PRO For more information visit www.epson.eu/inkjetsaving The results speak for themselves Independent tests are based on comparisons with competitive laser printers epson.co.uk/workforcepro EPSON EXCEED YOUR VISION NEWS Three launches 4G Super- Voice to eliminate indoor black spots THREE HAS LAUNCHED its new 4G Super-Voice service. Powered by Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) technology, Three’s 4G Super-Voice service should dramatically improve indoor and rural coverage across the Three network. Based on a new SOOMHz spectrum, which will run alongside Three’s existing 3G 2,100/\\/\\Hz and 4G 1,800/V\\Hz spectrums, 4G Super-Voice allows signals to travel much further than before, helping it penetrate those dreaded 4G black spots inside your home and in remote rural areas. This should mean customers will finally be able to make calls, send texts and get online in places where they previously had very poor signal. It will also finally allow customers to make calls over 4G. At the moment. Three’s 4G network only runs data services, so if you make a call, you fall back to its 3G network. However, 4G Super-Voice will enable 4G voice services, enhancing the quality of calls while speeding up connection rates and setup times. Three said 4G Super-Voice already covers 50% of the UK population for indoor coverage, as well as three-quarters of London, Edinburgh, Exeter and Birmingham. The service will roll out in other cities across the country, including Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool and Bristol, and Three expects that more than 1 million customers will be able to use it by the end of the year. There is a catch, though, as you need a compatible phone. Right now, only the Samsung Galaxy S5 and LG G4 support the service, a Three spokesperson told Shopper. Three expects that most current handsets will support the service before the end of the year, including the iPhone 6 and 6s, the Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, HTC One M9, the Microsoft Lumia 640 and Nokia Lumia 735. Handsets older than two years are unlikely to support the service. To use Three’s 4G Super-Voice service, customers must be running the latest OS software update. When the update is ready for a particular handset, they’ll receive an alert and update instructions. Canon reveals sensor BBC delays Micro Bit with 250 megapixels launch until 2016 CANON HAS DEVELOPED a digital camera sensor containing 250 million pixels, giving rise to the prospect of a massive bump in DSLR resolutions. The APS-H sensor - which is a halfway house between the APS-C sensors found in consumer cameras and the full-frame units found in professional gear - captures 19,580x12,600 images: roughly 30 times as many pixels as you’ll find on a 4K television. Canon claims the images are so detailed that, in a test photo, viewers were able to make out the lettering on the side of a plane flying 11 miles above the ground. Canon didn’t reveal which lens it used for the shot, but that the lettering was visible when it used software to zoom into an area approximately %o,oooth the size of the image. The resolution is greater than even professional photographers and video makers could cope with at present, although Canon claims the real advantage of capturing footage in such detail is that you can crop into small parts of the frame without any noticeable drop in clarity. Storing its output is a bigger problem. Shooting footage at 30fps at Full HD resolution on the Canon 70D consumes around 10MB of storage per second. The 250-megapixel sensor has 125 times the resolution of Full HD, which would equate to roughly 1.25GB of storage per second of footage at the same frame rate. However, Canon admits its new sensor currently shoots at only five frames per second, due to the sheer amount of data it’s processing. There’s little hope of the sensor finding its way into DSLRs in the foreseeable future. Instead, Canon says it is “considering the application of this technology in specialised surveillance and crime prevention tools, ultra-high- resolution measuring instruments and other industrial equipment”. ^ Canon’s new sensor produces massive images, but it’s unlikely ever to make its way into a consumer DSLR EARLIER THIS YEAR, the BBC announced ambitious plans to give every Year 7 pupil in the country a free Micro Bit computer (see News, Shopper 332). This small Raspberry Pi-like device was originally intended to arrive in October, but the BBC has since announced that its Micro Bit rollout will be delayed until 2016 because of manufacturing issues. The purpose of the cheap, low-powered board is to introduce children to coding, but a problem with its power supply means they will now have to wait until “after Christmas” to get their barebones computer. A BBC spokesperson said the problem had “affected a small number of devices”, but that it was still “expecting to start sending them out to teachers before Christmas and to children early in the New Year. “As a result of our rigorous testing, we’ve decided to make some minor revisions to the device - getting it right for children and teachers before we manufacture one million units is our priority,” the BBC said. Powered by a 32-bit ARM Cortex MO CPU, the BBC Micro Bit is a 40x50mm board that contains a matrix of 25 red LEDs, two programmable buttons, a motion detector and a magnetometer (or digital compass), as well as Bluetooth and five I/O rings for connecting other devices and sensors. However, it doesn’t include a display output or any expandable storage. Instead, the BBC will launch dedicated software for the Micro Bit, which will enable children to program the device using a computer, tablet or mobile phone. The software will support Microsoft’s Touch Develop language, JavaScript, Python, C++ and Blocks. Programs are then sent to a central server where they are compiled for the Micro Bit, before being downloaded and flashed to the device over Bluetooth. 4 The BBC Micro Bit was due to arrive in October, but manufacturing problems have now pushed the launch back until after Christmas DECEMBER 2015 COMPUTER SHOPPER ISSUE 334 NEWS amazon Amazon unveils new family of Fire devices AMAZON ANNOUNCED A number of new devices in September, including three tablets, an Ultra HD Fire TV box and a brand-new Fire TV Stick with a voice-activated remote control. The tablets, which start at just £50, will run Amazon’s new Fire OS 5 Bellini operating system. Amazon’s Fire OS has always been based on Android, but Bellini is the most Android-like operating system yet, as Amazon has ditched its old carousel design in favour of a more standard grid-based home screen. Content is still divided into separate tabs, such as Books, Games, Apps and Video, but it should make each device much easier to use than previous Fire tablets. The new OS will also take full advantage of Amazon Prime Instant Video’s On Deck feature, which lets you download shows to watch offline. Programmes download in the background to any spare storage space you have, making sure you’ve always got something to watch. The new tablets come in a range of sizes. The £50 Fire is the cheapest and smallest, with a 7in IPS display, while the Fire HD comes with an Sin or 10.1in screen and costs £130 or £170 respectively. Amazon hasn’t announced the resolution of the Fire yet, but both Fire HD tablets will have only 1,280x800 resolution displays. That’s just about acceptable on an Sin device, with a pixel density of 189 pixels per inch, but may start to appear pixelated on a lO.lin display. Still, Amazon claims its tablets will be more durable than the current iPad Air 2, surviving twice as many tumbles in its own lab tests. Each will also have a microSD card that supports cards up to 128GB, offering plenty of storage, with battery life topping out at seven hours for the Fire and eight hours for both Fire HD tablets. The tablets comes in a variety of colours, with protective cases costing £20 more, and are available to buy now. We’ll bring you a full review next month. Amazon also revealed new models of its popular Fire TV and Fire TV Stick streaming devices. Available now for £80, the 2015 Fire TV has a 4K UHD output, enabling users to take full advantage of today’s newer 4K TVs. With more 4K content arriving on Amazon’s own Instant Video service and Netflix, there should be plenty of films and TV shows available to get you started. However, Amazon hasn’t yet confirmed whether the Fire TV’s YouTube app will also support 4K. When asked about future 4K support on the YouTube app, Amazon told Computer Shopper it has “been in conversation with YouTube and they’re excited to bring their 4K content to our platform,” so it sounds as if it’s on the way. The new Fire TV will also support High Efficient Video Coding, so it should deliver better quality 1080p content too - Amazon says it’s up to twice as efficient as H.264. The box will also come with 8GB of internal storage and can be expanded up to 128GB with a microSD card. Meanwhile, Amazon’s updated Fire TV Stick includes a new remote control, which now supports voice search. This will allow users to find content simply by speaking the name of an actor, film or director, adding another layer of convenience when you’re trying to find something to watch. The new Fire TV Stick will be available from 22nd October and will cost £45. ^ The Fire HD will be available in multiple colours, with a brand- new interface that’s based heavily on Android Lollipop am imazon ♦ You’ll need an Amazon Prime subscription to get the most out of the new Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, but it’s not absolutely necessary ffEUMiiirv cfirrFjcp The results speak for themselves Independent tests are based on comparisons with competitive laser printers epson.co.uk/workforcepro FASTER PRINTING WITH WORKFORCE PRO For more information visit www.epson.eu/inkjetsaving EPSON EXCEED YOUR VISION _ / LI GREY IMPORTS It can often be cheaper to buy tech products from sellers based overseas, but that discount might be down to tax avoidance THESE DAYS, THE best price for a gadget can be only a click away. Google even helps by listing promoted suppliers at the top of your search results - but when some retailers offer goods for 30% to 40% less than others, is the deal too good to be true? Not necessarily. Welcome to the complex area of grey imports. Grey importing is when products are sold outside normal sales channels. The sale itself is legal, but the goods are often shipped from outside the final market, raising issues of tax, duties, warranties and returns. The practice also enables you to buy products that have never been launched in this country, such as the Nokia N1 tablet (see page 28). So how can you spot a grey importer? The presence of a UK phone number on a website is no guarantee that the firm is based here. Many such sites operate from Hong Kong, and if you buy from one of these, your usual consumer rights won’t apply, so check customer reviews before buying. A good source of ratings is Trustpilot, which is like TripAdvisor for retailers. Most of the reviews you’ll find on this site are glowing. If a site isn’t mentioned on Trustpilot or found in Google-sponsored results, it might be a scam - you can verify this by searching for the name plus “review” or “problem”. • • • q:. 91 IK4^ Expedite Electronics told us we wouldn’t have to pay VAT on top LaiFrt IUbMw MVAaewii SNpF of its advertised prices ^Expedite ■ elfldrEMiles Sl««)PTt4& ClfTrSRHIH GIFT FOR hO 1 CflMCRA UMMStPEES, «H5 TA61CT MOBILE IL PIKE Prpcftssjsf EhuiC^i MV CVt mmnk hMir lUWl lluu-em Ifilii C Vt A 1 ttUHlI. utmm iii«eiiMHi ab vm- C VI HHI CjIH d 1 »Hl. m C«i*f COMMON COMPLAINTS Unfortunately, not all resellers provide a good service.

There have been reports of inaccurate photos and orders, while ‘in stock’ can be an elastic term. A wait of five or six days is usual, but there are stories of items not showing up for a month. SLRHut’s customers noted that the firm phoned them before processing their online order, and while some appreciated the personal touch, others objected to being offered alternative products. Don’t expect to receive stock from the UK - goods may come from China, Russia or anywhere outside Europe. Whether this matters depends on the manufacturer. According to several users, Olympus, for example, will honour an international warranty based on any valid receipt, while lens-maker Sigma is opposed to grey imports. Apple reportedly doesn’t care where a product was bought, but make sure you watch out for technical differences, such as PAL versus NTSC or different power-supply requirements. Since you’re not buying your goods within the EU, you don’t get a two-year guarantee as standard either. Grey importers usually offer their own warranty bought in from an international provider. If you need to claim against it, you’ll have to send your product to a third-party workshop. 0133 DECEMBER 2015 COMPUTER SHOPPER ISSUE 334 nnnnn Calegory Buying goods on the international wholesale market and offering them direct to UK customers isn’t illegal (although it may involve a breach of contract somewhere), but in today’s global market, it’s not obvious why that should make them cheaper. Retailers such as Cam2 and Tin Cheung advertise the same prices online as in their Hong Kong shops, and you’ll rarely find them for less than the pre-VAT price in the UK. Yet much lower prices are advertised for UK imports. PAYING VAT Presumably, UK suppliers know where to go for the best wholesale deals, so might grey imports involve an element of tax evasion? When goods are shipped from outside the EU to a personal customer, a tax bill is sent - usually through the courier firm - to the supplier (if they’ve agreed to pay it) or to the Some grey suppliers promise a refund if you receive a tax bill. That’s highly suggestive that there might be some attempted misdeclaration, although it could occur due to error. Others just state that you won’t have to pay any tax but don’t explain why. Simply Electronics is unusual in disclaiming responsibility for tax and duty, correctly warning that the customer may have to pay it. We phoned several grey-importing companies for details. Twice we reached automated messages. A third supplier, based in England but under a name listed by Companies House as “dormant”, answered. After four attempts to track down an elusive manager, we gave up. Finally, at Expedite Electronics, a woman with a professional telephone manner answered our questions. Did the prices include VAT? No, because “the main company” was based in Hong Kong. Did A known method of VAT evasion is to mark packages with a vaiue beiow the £15 threshoid rather than the reai price customer. A known method of VAT evasion is to mark packages with a value below the £15 threshold rather than the real price paid. We’re not suggesting that any of the companies named here are involved in this practice, but plenty of customer stories are doing the rounds. One affirmed that his supplier had failed to “do an accurate customs declaration, to dodge the VAT. My camera was declared as a low-value toy accessory.” The gamble doesn’t always pay off: “I’ve since ordered a camera from another Hong Kong firm, which was delivered after being held by customs for seven weeks. I’ve paid the VAT and hope to be refunded [by the supplier].” The Home Office’s Border Force is responsible for customs enforcement. A spokesperson told us that the agency aims to “disrupt any fraud that cheats UK taxpayers and undercuts honest businesses”, and that it carries out checks to “assess whether the values on customs declarations are credible”. Border Force will also “respond to any specific intelligence about the suspected undervaluation of goods”. that mean we might get a VAT bill? No: “You don’t have to pay any VAT and the import duty and tax is already included.” If companies bring goods from outside the EU into UK warehouses and sell them on, they’re responsible for the VAT, not the customer. If the goods are shipped directly to you from abroad, however, you’re probably liable to pay the VAT on receipt. One problem is that there’s no easy way for a consumer to check that the tax has been paid. GREY ADVICE If you’re thinking of buying grey, go in with your eyes open. First, do the research. We found many items for hundreds of pounds less than UK prices, but a few were cheaper in the UK. Read the terms and conditions, which are often on a page called FAQ or Shipping. These range from explicit - requiring you to return faulty goods within a limited period, for example - to the unnerving, such as when ‘shipping insurance’ is an extra cost. Make sure you pay by credit card, because then the card issuer is jointly liable for Other ways to buy abroad Grey imports are not the same as personal imports. Many foreign retailers offer delivery to the UK, leaving you to pay the VAT and duty. Reputable New York company B&H (www.bh photovideo, com), for example, usefully shows a calculation of shipping, tax and duty while you’re browsing an item. Foreign eBay sales usually work in a similar way, but misdeclaration is not unknown. A few UK-based firms, such as HDEW Cameras, sell grey imports. With low prices backed by the reassurance of English law, this could offer the best of both worlds, although some users have said the company could be clearer about what you’re getting, including kit splits. One legal way to avoid some of the tax is to bring products with you when travelling to the UK from outside the EU. If the goods are worth more than £390 in total, you must go through the red channel and pay VAT and duty on the rest of the value. purchases of more than £100, no matter where it’s from. Some debit cards offer voluntary protection too. You can request a chargeback against any card if goods aren’t delivered, but you’ll be relying on the cooperation of the merchant’s bank, so don’t hold your breath for a quick resolution. If things go wrong with a purchase, badger the retailer until it has been put right. Insist on a replacement or refund, not a repair - if goods arrive faulty, cite breach of contract, a concept understood by courts everywhere. If necessary, log in to Trustpilot and post a complaint: many of these companies monitor reviews and they may reply. At worst you’re warning others of the pitfalls.

This means the 3rd Gen Moto G finally has some competition, but with a refined design, superb build quality and a huge number of features on offer, it has a real chance to win back its crown. That said, it’s less of a bargain than its predecessors once were. The cheapest model, which has 8GB of storage and 1GB of RAM, starts at £159. Choosing your own colours with Motorola’s Moto Maker service adds £20, and buying the slightly more powerful version, with 16GB of storage and 2GB RAM, costs another £30 on top of that. A microSD card slot means the extra storage isn’t crucial, but the extra RAM will make a difference to speed and multitasking. ANGLE POISE The new handset shares design elements with Motorola’s Moto X, with a metal-effect frame that curves almost seamlessly into the removable back plate, creating lovely smooth contours. The edges taper to a pleasing 6.1mm, and the 155g handset feels very strong and durable. We much prefer it to the flat, angular edges of the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua. The machined, textured finish on the power button is a particularly nice touch, making it easier to find next to the matt volume rocker. The removable rear panels come in various colours, and you can swap them as you please, making the Moto G more customisable than other handsets at this price. The subtle colour calibration tests bore very similar results, with the new handset displaying 85.4% of the sRGB colour gamut. We preferred it to the older phone’s screen, which looked very warm and pink by comparison. Black levels were reasonably dark at 0.36cd/m2 on maximum brightness, and a contrast ratio of 1,061:1 provided plenty of detail. Viewing angles were excellent, but its peak brightness of 339.38cd/m2 means you’ll struggle to see images and dark video scenes when using the phone outdoors. SPEED BOOST Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 410 chipset appears in many budget smartphones, but here it runs at 1.4GHz rather than the usual 1.2GHz, giving the phone a small speed boost. We tested it with both 1GB and 2GB of RAM, and both models proved significantly faster in our benchmarks than the competition. Both scored around 530 in the Geekbench 3 single-core test and 1,600 in the multicore test, whereas the 1.2GHz Snapdragon 410-powered 2nd Gen Moto E managed only 470 and 1,397 respectively. ribbed high-quality feel and provides plenty of grip. When the back is properly clipped into place, the Moto G becomes IPX7 waterproof, meaning it can be dunked in up to a metre of water for 30 minutes without being damaged. It’s not entirely watertight, though, so if you get it wet, you’ll need to take off the back and give it a quick wipe. We found a few droplets still lingering inside during our tests. Motorola has also managed to squeeze an extra 80mAh into the new phone’s battery. With screen brightness set to 170cd/m2, it provided an impressive 11h 12m of continuous video playback - over 90 minutes longer than the 2nd generation handset. It also beats every other phone in its price bracket except Samsung’s Galaxy A3, which lasted 14h 30m thanks to an energy-efficient AMOLED panel. The 2nd and 3rd Gen Moto Gs appear to use the same 5in, 1,280x720-resolution display panel, which we feel strikes the right balance between screen size and pixel clarity. Our 24 DECEMBER 2015 COMPUTER SHOPPER ISSUE 334 Both models were equally fast at web browsing, too, and their impressive score of 781 in Futuremark’s Peacekeeper web browsing test is one of the faster scores weVe seen from this chipset. Web pages loaded quickly and there were only a few signs of visible stutter on multimedia-heavy sites. However, the real difference between the 1GB and 2GB Moto G is its ability to multitask, as apps and games loaded much faster on the 2GB version - often only by a second, but the extra RAM does make a surprising difference. That said, there are plenty of other handsets available for around £200 that use the octa-core Snapdragon 615 chipset, such as the EE Harrier and Sony Xperia M4 Aqua, which are faster still, making the 2GB Moto G seem sluggish by comparison. A processor with a faster clock speed doesn’t necessarily equal smoother graphics performance, as the score of 105 frames in the GFX Bench offscreen Manhattan test indicates. The Moto G can handle 2D games perfectly well, though, and when playing Blizzard’s more demanding Hearthstone we didn’t see any warnings that the phone didn’t meet the recommended specifications, as we have with other Snapdragon 410 phones. LIVING COLOUR The 13-megapixel camera sensor is a big step up from the second generation handset’s 8-megapixel sensor. According to Motorola, it’s the same sensor used in the Nexus 6, which costs more than twice as much. It also has a dual LED flash, which is supposed to adjust colour temperature The Moto G can be dunked in up to a metre of water for 30 minutes without being damaged to make flash-lit shots look more natural, and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. We were a little disappointed by the flash’s performance in our indoor photo tests, as it made our still-life arrangement look rather green. This was particularly noticeable on the teddy bear’s fur, and the blocks of watercolour paint were also less vivid than in our non-flash shots. Admittedly, it eliminated a lot of noise, but colour quality suffered. Plenty of detail was visible, though, and outdoor shots in particular looked superb. Colours were rich and vibrant, even in areas of shadow. HDR was a little strong at times, but it helped preserve finer details and made clouds look particularly dramatic. Shooting is fast, too, with a simple interface that’s easy to navigate. A quick swipe in from the left reveals the camera’s settings, while a swipe from the right opens the Gallery. SKIN DEEP Like Motorola’s other handsets, the latest Moto G runs pure Android - in this case the latest 5.1.1 update. With no skins to worry about. Motorola can push out updates much sooner than other manufacturers. There are still a few Motorola-specific apps and features, though. You can set the phone to enter silent mode automatically when you’re at home or in a meeting, or turn off the screen and all notifications while you’re asleep, allowing only favourite contacts through or anyone who calls twice in five minutes. It also takes Android Lollipop’s lockscreen notifications further, displaying the time and up to three interactive notification buttons when the screen is turned off. This is good for the battery life and incredibly handy if all you want to do is check the time. With a higher base price and additional £209 version, the new Moto G isn’t the budget bargain its predecessors were. However, we feel its exquisite design and improved features are enough to counterbalance the slightly disappointing choice of chipset, and even the faster Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 and Sony Xperia M4 Aqua can’t beat its amazing battery life or stunning rear camera. Likewise, the Moto G’s Sin display makes for a much more manageable handset than the 5y2in screen of the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. The 8GB version is a better buy on contract, as you can get 1GB of data, 300 minutes and 5,000 texts for £15.50 per month with no up-front cost from Carphone Warehouse. Equivalent deals for the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and Samsung Galaxy A3 cost £20 or more per month. Three also has some good deals on Pay As You Go, with prices starting at £140 for the 8GB version and Moto Maker models available on contract. While the increase in RAM is nice, it’s not essential, especially when it costs so much more. The 3rd Gen Moto G might not be the best-value budget smartphone any more, but it’s one of Motorola’s best.
