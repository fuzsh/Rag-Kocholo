From its introduction in 1899 until it was last listed in Ensign Ltd’s 1938 catalogue, upwards of 26,000 examples of 60 distinct models of Sanderson camera had been made. The camera’s designer was Frederick Sanderson, who was born in July 1856 toa long-established Cambridge family. He had started work as a cabinetmaker and wood and a stone carver, and became interested in photography in the\n\n1880s. Sanderson took a leading role in his local photographic society and photographic retailing was soon added to his cabinetmaking business. A MATTER\n\nOF PERSPECTIVE\n\nSanderson had a particular interest in architectural photography and, when he was unable to find a camera to meet his needs, with the movements necessary\n\nto retain the correct perspective, he set about designing one. The outcome of his work was the subjéct of British patent number 613 of 10 January 1895.The patent described a method of supporting the front or back ofa camera that allowed it to be fixed at any angle. In practice, the design was incorporated into\n\na double strut on each side of the front standard that could be locked into any position. The patent also referred to a rotating lens panel into which the lens was mounted eccentrically and to bellows that tapered on their lower side to aid the extreme movement available with the strut arrangement.\n\n58\n\nThe Sanderson Hand Camera\n\nSanderson licensed the design to George Houghton and Son of London, who initially had the camera made by the London camera makers Holmes Brothers. When this firm was incorporated into Houghtons Ltd in 1904, the camera was subsequently made and sold by Houghtons and, from 1930, their selling company Ensign Ltd, until its demise after a direct hit during the Blitz in 1940. It was reborn after the war but never achieved its earlier success. Frederick Sanderson does not appear to have made any further significant contribution to photography; he died on 9 July 1929. CONTINUAL\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nThe Sanderson field camera proved popular and the model was made in a large range of plate sizes; a hand-and-stand model was offered from 1899.\n\nThe hand camera underwent a process of continual improvement, with further patents from Sanderson and others being incorporated into the design. The camera body was made of polished mahogany, covered externally with a fine-grained leather. The focusing back was removable and could be rotated 90 degrees to allow for horizontal or upright format negatives. The removable back also meant that it could be used with Eastman roll-film backs,\n\nwhich allowed the photographer to take a series of pictures on film rather than individually on single glass plates. The camera’s struts and the ability of the baseboard to drop down gave it greater versatility than its competitors: none of them were able to match its success. In 1902 the original model was improved and renamed the Regular. At the same time, other models were introduced, including a roll-film model\n\nBELOW\n\nThe pre-1914\n\nthat incorporated a fixed roll holder. Later years saw the release of simplified | models, a tropical model made of teak to withstand the heat and humidity of the tropics, and a specific Post-Card format model. The Tropical de Luxe was made in teak or heavily brass-bound Spanish mahogany.\n\ninstruction booklet for\n\nFew changes were made between 1910 and 1928, when the Regular model\n\nthe Sanderson hand camera. The cover illustration showed the extension and movement\n\npossible with the camera.\n\n|\n\n| |\n\n|\n\nwas updated to house a revolving back and a finish of black and nickel. This version continued to be made until manufacturing was stopped in the late 1930s. The Sanderson hand-and-stand camera found favour with keen amateur photographers, particularly those who were members of cameras clubs, rather than snapshooters. Commercial photographers, too, liked the camera, which offered versatility across different types of photography, both indoors and out. Writing in their 1904—5 catalogue, Houghtons noted that: ‘it is very gratifying to find the demand for the Sanderson Hand camera growing each season by leaps and bounds. The cause of the increasing popularity of this instrument is not far to seek. It supplied a want that has been growing year by year, a want shared by thousands of workers who, having become tired of the “Press the button Photography”, have decided on a more\n\nserious course of work, and the demand for an instrument more capable and adapted to a wider range of Photography naturally is the result, and a good universal Camera becomes a pressing need.’ At £6 10s Od (around £600 today) for the Regular quarter-plate model, the camera was attractively priced.\n\n59\n\n14 “t\n\nThe Kodak Brownie propuceD:\n\nABOVE Asked to name the camera that transformed amateur photography, most people would choose the humble Brownie box camera. For much of the twentieth century the Brownie was the first camera people bought, and even in a digital age the name continues to be used as shorthand for an amateur camera.\n\n60\n\n1900\n\n| country: USA\n\n| MANuFAcTURER: Eastman Kodak Company\n\netween 1900 and 1980, a vast range of camera models, more than 125 in\n\nB total depending on definition, were sold under the Brownie name. They were well designed, simple to operate and low in price. The camera changed\n\nover the years — from being made of cardboard to moulded plastic, and including box and folding models — but these basic concepts remained throughout. The Brownie camera was the most successful range of all time and introduced photography to many millions of people across the world. The original Brownie of 1900 was designed by Frank Brownell. He had been working for George Eastman, the owner of Kodak, making the Eastman—Walker roll-film holder from 1885 and undertaking woodworking for Kodak cameras. In 1892, Eastman built a factory next to his own that he called the Camera Works and rented it to Brownell, who began designing and making cameras for Eastman’s rapidly expanding company, By the time Brownell retired in 1902 and Eastman bought the factory, more than 60 new camera models and designs had come out of the Camera Works. Eastman described Brownell as ‘the greatest camera designer the world has known’.\n\nThe Kodak Brownie\n\nBACK TO BASICS The original Kodak camera of 1888 had done much to simplify the process of photography, but it was expensive and it sold in relatively low numbers. The Pocket Kodak of 1895 took the idea of a simple box-type camera further, and it was more popular, selling some 100,000 in its first year. Eastman recognised that if he could produce a cheap, reliable camera for under a dollar, it would encourage more people, particularly children and women, to take up photography; this in turn would boost the sales of film and paper, where most of Eastman Kodak Company’s profits were made.To bring the cost of manufacturing down would require going back to basics in terms of the design of the camera and how it was produced. So it was that in 1898, Eastman asked Brownell to design a camera that would be\n\ncheaper and easier to use than any Kodak had*yet made. The resulting Brownie camera was little more than a cardboard box with a lens mounted at the front, and yet it was innovative in that it simplified the camera to a bare minimum. The camera body was made of jute board, reinforced with wood and covered in imitation black leather. The few controls were nickel-plated. At one end was a simple meniscus lens of 100mm focal length and aperture of f/14, and a simple single-speed rotary shutter. The camera back was held on by two metal springs and was removed to allow a newly introduced daylight-loading roll film, later designated 117, for six exposures each of 2'4 x 2’4in (made and sold in inches, approx. 6 X 6cm), to be inserted. The shutter release and the winding key to advance the film were located on top of the camera. To take a picture the camera was simply pointed at the subject and the button pushed. There were no other controls; it was the simplest point-and-shoot camera able to produce acceptable results in sunshine. From July 1900, a separate clip-on waist-level viewfinder was available for an additional shilling (5 pence). The camera was launched on | February 1900 for the price of $1 in the United States and 25 shillings in the UK. The first 15,000 cameras were designed with a push-on back; following feedback from customers and dealers, the camera back was strengthened, and by June a redesigned version was being sold. If the original Kodak camera of 1888 had taken the photographer away from the darkroom, then the Brownie brought photography within the reach of everyone. The camera was affordable, even to the working classes, and the six-exposure films cost only 7d or 25 cents. A network of chemist shops and photographic dealers offered developing and printing services, although the camera was also supported with a processing kit and a range of accessories that would allow the owner to produce his or her own photographs. The resulting images could then be put into Brownie albums. Kodak Limited in Britain was excited by the camera. In its Trade Circular, sent out to the photographic trade, it proclaimed the Brownie would ‘bring into photography thousands of new workers and users, and — as with all our inventions, simplifications and advertising — will create new customers\n\nBELOW\n\nA Kodak Ltd\n\nadvertising brochure for the Brownie camera, c. 1906.\n\nfor our dealer friends’.\n\n61\n\nPEALE TA\n\nSTOLE\n\nBERT HARDY Between 1941 and 1957, Bert Hardy (1913— 1995), a former war photographer, worked for the illustrated magazine Picture Post. With cameras and photographic equipment restricted by\n\nED\n\ncompetition and sent Hardy off to Blackpool to prove his point. Armed with a box Brownie camera presented by the Lord Mayor, he headed down to the town’s Golden Mile promenade where he captured one of his most iconic images: two former members of the Tiller Girls dancing\n\ngovernment controls after the Second World War,\n\ntroupe — Pat Wilson and Wendy Clarke — seated,\n\na debate arose about how important the camera was for securing great photographs. Hardy claimed that it was not the camera but the person behind it that resulted in a great picture. To attract readers, Picture Post ran a photography\n\nlaughing, on the railings above the beach. Published in the magazine on 14 July 1951, it became an instant classic, proving that in the hands of a great photographer, the simplest box camera could produce truly memorable pictures.\n\n62\n\n_\n\nThe Kodak Brownie\n\nTHE OTHER BROWNIES In many respects, the camera was unremarkable.\n\nWhat made it the success it became, other than the price, was the associated marketing. The Brownie name — nothing to do with Frank Brownell — came from a series of well-known children’s books by Palmer Cox that had been popular since 1881. Characters from these were used by Kodak to advertise the camera and they appeared on the camera's packaging until around 1907. Reportedly, Kodak's marketing department used the characters with no acknowledgment or payment to Cox, which is ironic considering the lengths Kodak went to in preserving its own trademarks.\n\nLEFT Circa 1905,a girl taking a photograph using a Kodak Brownie camera.\n\nThe company envisaged the Brownie as being everyone's first camera, after which they would then move on to more expensive models. It was deliberately aimed at children and women rather than men, who had\n\nhitherto been the main buyers of cameras. To support sales, the Kodak company quickly announced a Brownie Prize Competition in 1901, which was open to members of its Brownie Kodak Club. Membership was limited to boys and girls under 16 years old. Prizes totalled £100 and more than 3,000 entries were received.\n\nThe camera was advertised extensively in newspapers and magazines to reach its intended market. In the United States in June 1900, the magazines carrying Brownie advertisements had a combined circulation of 6 million. Dealers were supported by Kodak, which supplied printed circulars, banners and show cards for shop windows. AN\n\nINSTANT\n\nHIT\n\nThe response from the public was exceptional. “They are selling like wildfire, the company announced one month after its introduction; it struggled to supply its dealers’ orders. By the time the original Brownie was superseded by the No. 1 Brownie in October 1901, around 245,000 had been sold. Needless\n\nto say, other camera manufacturers quickly brought out their own models, copying the simplicity of the Brownie and aiming at the same markets Kodak was targeting. They used names such as Buster Brown, Kewpie, Nipper and Scout, but none had the impact of the Brownie, which had Kodak’s massive\n\nadvertising and marketing spend to propel it into the limelight.\n\n63\n\nThe Brownie camera of 1900 was just the start. New models of box Brownie were regularly introduced. These appeared in different sizes, often with more controls for photographers, to allow them to react to different lighting conditions, for example, or so that portraits could be taken with greater success. More metal was incorporated into the camera body as manufacturing was mechanised and moved away from the hand assembly of Brownell’s workshop. This helped to keep the cost of the camera down. The basic box design remained the same until the 1950s, when, with the\n\nuse of new materials such as moulded plastics, the design became more streamlined, a style commensurate with the postwar age. The camera lenses also changed from glass to plastic. The traditional black box changed to brown, tan and grey colours and new features such as coupled or built-in flashguns allowing pictures to be taken indoors became the norm. Reflex models imitated more serious cameras. As colour films became more sensitive, with greater latitude to poor light conditions, and public demand grew, Brownie pictures moved from black and white to colour.\n\n64\n\nThe Kodak Brownie\n\nABOVE No. 2 Brownie cameras being packed at a Kodak Ltd warehouse,\n\nready for shipping to retailers for sale.\n\nDECLINE\n\nAND\n\nLEGACY\n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s, the Brownie range was increasingly seen as old-fashioned. Helping the brand for a while were moulded plastic and updated body designs, as on the incredibly successful Brownie 127 camera produced between 1952 and 1967, which sold in the millions. In Britain,\n\nKodak Ltd brought in industrial designer Kenneth Grange to update the Brownie 44A and 44B cameras, which lost their box shape to make them look like ‘proper’ cameras. The biggest drawback of the Brownie was its use of roll film, mostly 120, 620 and 127 films. These required care when\n\nthreading the film through the camera to a take-up spool. It was a fiddly, error-prone process that could result in missed pictures due to the film not advancing through the camera. The introduction of the Kodak Instamatic (see page 168) range of cameras in 1963, with a drop-in cartridge, did away with this and ensured that the film moved properly through the camera. It was failsafe. Technically,\n\nae\n\nBROWNIE camera\n\n2QO\n\nthe Instamatics were box cameras too, but the Kodapak 126 cartridge\n\nallowed for a more compact design and better reflected the modern age than did the Brownie. By the end of the 1960s, having long been the first camera for many tens of millions of people, the Brownie was consigned to history. It was briefly resurrected in 1980 when the Brownie name was used on a 110 cartridge camera celebrating the centenary of the founding of George Eastman’s company. Even today, the Brownie name resonates in popular culture and remains part of photography’s folklore. In May 1900, Kodak had promoted the Brownie camera to its dealers with the phrase: ‘Plant the Brownie acorn and the Kodak oak will grow’. Sure enough, the acorn had borne a whole forest of oaks and the Brownie had become the most famous and successful camera range of all time.\n\nFREE\n\nDTS BT\n\nSADA\n\nTIT I\n\nEST MEDS\n\nHOLDING BROWNIES\n\nSEIS\n\nSEL\n\nRDI\n\nLED\n\nABOVE of 1900 Brownie take the\n\nThe No. 1 Brownie (top) and the last camera made to 110 cartridge in\n\nBritain between 1980 and\n\n1982 (bottom).\n\nRL IEEE\n\nbody.

Some were impractical, some were too obvious and others were simply no more than a novelty, with no pretension towards being a serious camera. The Ticka camera, which was placed on the market during 1906, was different. Made in the form of a\n\npocket watch, it was also equipped with a reasonable lens that, coupled with a negative of only 1 x 1%in (2.5 x 3.8cm), ensured that the enlargements could, in the words of the British Journal of Photographic Almanac, “yield quite excellent little prints’ of up to 3 X 2in (7.6 x Scm). The Ticka was the most popular watch-form camera ever made. Many thousands of the standard model were sold around the British Empire. In the United States, a version of the camera was sold as the Expo Watch\n\ncamera and was still being listed in 1939 — some 35 years after Magnus Nieéll’s original patent. Niéll was a SWedish camera designer who came up with several innovative designs, including the Ensignette and the Ensign Midget, both of which were popular in their own right. Little is known about Niéll, other than that he came from Djursholm, near Stockholm, and that many of his camera designs were taken up and sold by the British firm Houghtons Ltd and its successor companies. At one point in the early twentieth century Houghtons was the largest camera manufacturer in the UK, even larger than\n\n66\n\nThe Ticka\n\nKodak in Britain, and it had a history going back to 1834, pre-dating the\n\nbirth of photography. The firm had been involved in photography since its announcement in 1839.\n\nThe Ticka camera was patented in Britain on 14 October 1904, although the original application had been lodged in 1903. It described a watch-form camera and claimed the lens, the film holder and the shutter\n\nas the novel parts. Three subsequent patents in 1908 improved the camera further by describing and protecting a special developing device for the Ticka film spools, a focal-plane shutter and an improved film spool. One of the most innovative features of the camera was the drop-in film cartridge, which coupled with the film advance gear and a counter to keep count of the exposures made. The film cartridge, as a single unit with a spool holding the fm and take-up spool, was novel and gave the snapshooter a foolproof method of ensuring that the unexposed film moved correctly within the camera. The idea was taken up again in 1963 with the introduction of the Kodak Instamatic camera (see page 168). The rights to manufacture the Ticka in Britain were granted to Houghtons Ltd, which had a large factory in Walthamstow, North London,\n\nand several large retail and distribution outlets across Britain and the British Empire. Wishing to distinguish the camera from German imports, Houghtons claimed that ‘the Ticka is British made throughout. It is made in our own factories by our own men, and is not imported’ It was sold from 1906 at 8s 6d (£40 today), and was described positively in the photographic press: ‘The apparatus though so compact, is nevertheless better than a toy.\n\nTHE COMPLETE OUTFIT The camera was available in outfits that made ive i it perfect for buying as a gift.

The Watch Face Ticka had the usual camera mechanism, but instead of the flat metal\n\npanel engraved with the Ticka monogram, a whole new face was provided, ‘which is quite an ordinary watch dial, with two hands, which stand at seven\n\nminutes past ten, serving as a pair of lines roughly indicating the angle of the picture’ (although the hands do not appear in this exact position on all surviving models). The camera was intended to be mistaken for a watch and it sold for 10s 6d (£50 today). The second model was the Focal-Plane Ticka. The camera featured a better-quality lens, a Cooke {/6.5, which could be\n\nfocused. It was made by Taylor, Taylor and Hobson of Leicester, one of the leading lens and optical manufacturers in the country. The camera was also fitted with an adjustable focal-plane shutter, giving five speeds from '/s to “soo of a second, plus ‘time’, which kept the shutter open for as long as the release button was depressed. The camera cost £2 10s (£225 today) and was described in the press as a ‘really nicely made instrument’. Both of these models sold in very limited numbers and were only listed for a few years, as they added complexity and this raised the price. Another addition to the range was the silver Ticka, made to the standard specification except that the body was silver rather than the usual nickelplated brass.

Magnus Nieéll patented the camera in Germany in 1904, but it was in the United States that it had its greatest longevity. The American patent of 1904 was quickly taken up by the Expo Camera Company, which started manufacturing it from 1905.The camera made use of the usual 25 exposures on a cartridge. Around 1910, an improved model for ten exposures was introduced. The company was taken over by the photographic dealer Geéénnart in the late 1920s and changes were made to the design, which by this time was dated. Variations in the engravings on the camera appeared,\n\nand around 1935 a range of coloured enamelled versions were manufactured in blue, red and black.\n\nIn Japan, the Uyeda Camera Company produced its own copy of the Ticka called the Moment, made around 1910. Its construction matched the Ticka and Expo cameras, with even the Moment monogram closely resembling that of the British Ticka. The overall impact of the camera is hard to gauge. Commercially, it was\n\nBELOW ‘The King, George and his two Sons’, from\n\nthe Christmas Gift Book, by\n\nundoubtedly successful, although in Britain it did not survive the First World\n\nQueen Alexandra, 1908.\n\nWar.

A selection of her photographs were shown by the Kodak company in London in 1897 and in New York in 1898, with further exhibitions of her work in 1902, 1904—5, 1906 and posthumously in\n\n1930. The Daily Telegraph published Queen Alexandra’s Christmas Gift Book in 1908, which\n\nfeatured her snapshot photographs, including informal pictures of the royal family. More than 500,000 copies were sold and the proceeds were donated to over 30 charities.\n\n69\n\nae wg = ‘%\n\nThe Soho Reflex PRODUCED:\n\nABOVE Introduced in 1905, the Soho Reflex was the definitive reflex camera, extensively used in a variety of plate sizes\n\nup until after the Second World War. The general design was adopted by a large number of manufacturers in Britain and Europe.\n\n€.1905\n\n| counTRY:\n\nUK\n\n| manufacturer:\n\nMarion and Company\n\neflex cameras incorporate a mirror through which the photographer Ie view the subject before making an exposure — a feature still found in DSLRs (digital single-lens reflex cameras) today. With a twin-lens reflex (TLR) camera such as the Rolleiflex, two lenses are employed — one to allow the photographer to view the subject, the second to make the exposure. By incorporating a mirror, the single-lens reflex (SLR) utilises one lens both to view the subject and to make the exposure, the mirror being moved out of the way when the exposure is made. The first true SLR camera was invented by the English photographer Thomas Sutton and patented by him in 1861.The camera was designed for portraiture and it was made by two London manufacturers, Ross and Dallmeyer. Only a very small number were produced. THE\n\nADVENT\n\nOF THE\n\nREFLEX\n\nCAMERA\n\nThe nature of the wet-collodion process meant that reflex viewing was not of significant advantage for the photographer. The limited sensitivity of the photographic emulsion meant that it was not possible to capture movement, and photographs of still subjects could be carefully composed through the back of the camera. It was not until dry plates were introduced that the advantages of the reflex camera became increasingly apparent. A number of designs came onto the market in the 1880s. Loman’s SLR camera of 1889\n\n70\n\nThe Soho Reflex\n\nwas commercially successful and incorporated a focal-plane shutter, although its operation required some care. During the 1890s, new designs were produced by a number of manufacturers. Of these, the Graflex reflex camera, launched in 1898, was the most long-lived and influential in terms\n\nof defining the general design of reflex cameras. The basis of the Soho Reflex camera was British patent number 22,698,\n\ntaken out on 21 October 1904 by Abraham Kershaw for ‘Improvements in Photographic Cameras’. The patent described a reflex camera, the movement of the mirror and a mechanism to ensure that the mirror was properly raised before the camera shutter was released and the exposure made. The mirror operated independently of the shutter, with the shutter-release button moving the mirror and operating the shutter in sequence. The patent was incorporated into a reflex camera made by the Kershaw company in Leeds. The design was initially licensed to Marion and Company, one of Britain’s largest manufacturers and retailers of photographic equipment and materials, as the Soho Reflex. The name Soho was applied to reflect the location of its headquarters in Soho Square, London, and the camera was sold by the company from 1905. The 1906 British Journal Photographic Almanac described the camera’s advantages: ‘The notable feature in this new pattern of reflector camera is, first of all, the arrangement of the mirror by which a more compact construction can be adopted... It carries a Kershaw focal plane shutter, working at one tension only, from ‘46 to “400 of a second... There is considerable rise and cross movement of the front, and altogether the camera answers the most varied demands of the photographer who\n\nBELOW The Loman reflex camera of 1889,\n\npurchases it, first of all, for the boon of actually focusing his picture.’\n\none of the more successful\n\nreflex designs.\n\n| |\n\nThe camera sold for £12 (around £1,100 today) with no lens.\n\n71\n\nKershaw made the reflex camera for a range of different manufacturers to retail under their own name, including Marion, Ross, Dallmeyer, Beck and the London\n\nStereoscopic Company, as well as for itself. These initial letter prefix to the serial number stamped camera was made in a wide range of plate sizes; version and a tropical model. Marion advertised\n\nare usually identifiable by an into the body. The Soho Reflex there was also a stereoscopic the camera as ‘For Artists,\n\nTravellers, Journalists, Naturalists, All Photographers’.\n\nMarion and Company took part in the merger of some of the major sensitised goods and photographic equipment manufacturers — including Kershaw — in Britain in 1921 to form Amalgamated Photographic Manufacturers (APM) Ltd. The Soho Reflex continued to be manufactured, while the Baby Soho produced negatives of 42 x 6in (11.4 x 15.2cm) and was aimed at ‘travellers, lady photographers and all those to whom, for one reason or another, weight and size are of the utmost importance’. By 1928, when APM was split and Soho Ltd formed, the reflex camera was\n\nbeing advertised as ‘the Aristocrat of the Camera World’. The top-of-the-range Soho Reflex camera was the Tropical model, which cost £30, against £23 10s\n\n(around £1,600 against £1,200 today) for the standard quarter-plate model in 1930. The Tropical was made from teak and was designed to be used in the tropics and subtropical countries where heat and humidity would warp and degrade the body of an ordinary mahogany model. In reality, the Tropical model was a luxury camera and it is likely that few saw active use in extreme climates. TOWARDS\n\nA PORTABLE\n\nPRESS\n\nCAMERA\n\nThe reflex camera was widely used by press photographers and those photographing topical events, where the reflex viewing gave greater certainty that a subject had been properly captured. Although many press photographers had begun to opt for 35mm and medium-format roll film, glass plates and cut film continued to be used well into the 1950s. Quarter-plate models could be fitted with a film-pack adapter or a roll-film back that would allow multiple exposures to be made before the film needed changing. During the 1920s, more compact designs were gradually introduced. Companies such as Ihagee in Germany and Houghtons in Britain launched folding reflex cameras, which proved attractive when compared to the solid,\n\nbulky box-shape of the Soho Reflex and its contemporaries. There was a move to smaller sizes as photographic emulsions improved, with more sensitivity and finer grains. Models designed solely for roll film were also produced. By the 1930s, the traditional reflex camera seemed dated when compared to new camera designs: the 35mm rangefinder, the TLR, such as the Rolleiflex, and, by\n\nthe mid-1930s, 120 roll-film and 35mm SLR cameras epitomised by the Exakta and Kine Exakta. These were all smaller cameras that were quicker to operate and capable of producing perfectly acceptable results for use in newspapers and the illustrated weekly press, such as Picture Post in Britain, Life magazine in the United States and the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung and Minchner Illustrierte Presse in Germany. For traditionalists, the Soho Reflex continued to remain their camera of choice; for the new generation of photojournalists and press photographers, it was a throwback to the past.\n\nif)\n\nThe Soho Reflex\n\nLEFT The Steerage, by Alfred Stieglitz, 1907.

Due to the popularity of outdoor photography and pursuits, bicycles and cameras had a general association, and the company was already selling cameras in 1898 when Folmer invented the first Graflex.

The Autographic version introduced in January 1915 sold around 1.75 million, with its sales boosted by the First World War when it was advertised\n\nas ‘The Soldier’s Camera’. The design continued in various forms until 1937, with total sales from 1912 running to around two million. For the snapshooter, the box camera was the simplest and cheapest camera available, and when used in bright sunlight with normal subjects it gave reasonable results. Kodak had always seen the humble box camera as a starting point and ‘aimed to encourage snapshooters to progress to betterquality and more expensive cameras: to embrace photography*as not just a\n\nmeans of capturing events, but a hobby in its own right. All of which would boost film sales, where the greatest profits lay. Like most large manufacturers, Kodak offered a range of cameras with various features\n\nand at different prices. For many snapshooters the next step up from a box camera was a simple folding bellows camera.\n\ni\n\nThe Vest Pocket Kodak\n\nRIGHT Houghton’s Ensignette of 1909, shown collapsed in the foreground, and its successor, the Ensign Midget camera of 1934. These cameras foreshadowed and were contemporaries of Kodak’s Vest Pocket camera.\n\nTHE\n\nENSIGNETTE\n\nIn 1909, Houghton’s Ensignette camera was introduced to the public — a small\n\nroll-film camera that collapsed from its taking position to a compact unit of no more than 101 x 50 x 19mm (4 x 2 X %in). It achieved this through the use of a bellows and strut arrangement that allowed the front lens support to collapse down into the main rear body of the camera. The camera produced a 60 x 38mm (2% X 1’Ain) negative, which was large enough to yield reasonable enlargements. Houghtons introduced a series of improved models, | which were accompanied by a variety of accessories and processing equipment specially made to support the negative size, together with albums to hold contact prints made directly from the negatives. The Ensignette was an immediate hit and the last model was only discontinued in the late 1920s. The Ensignette started a trend for more pocketable cameras that other manufacturers quickly adopted. The Eastman Kodak Company's response was the Vest Pocket Kodak of 1912.The bellows camera did not incorporate the strut arrangement of the Ensignette; instead, it featured a scissor arrangement —\n\nknown as lazy-tongs — that connected the front lens board to the camera back on both sides. Lazy-tongs offered rigidity, and the front could simply be pushed back without the awkward unclipping at four points that the Ensignette required. The Vest Pocket Kodak also made use of a new 127 roll-film format with a compact centre spool, which meant that the camera could be smaller than normal. It gave negatives of 3.5 x 6.4cm (1% X 2%in). The British Journal Photographic Almanac for 1913 described the camera when\n\nclosed as having ‘an excellent roundness of shape, being quite free from all projections, unless one so regards the very slim winding key of the filmspool’. The camera was just 12 x 6.4 X 2.5cm (4% x 2’ X lin) in size when closed. In order to appeal to a non-technical market, the lens was set in an Eastman Autotime scale, which negated the need to have any knowledge of f-numbers and shutter speeds, with the diaphragm being set according to the\n\n75\n\nTHE AUTOGRAPHIC | I. i og In 1913 and 1914 Henry Jacques Gaisman was granted a series of patents for an invention that allowed the photographer to write information (such as dates and locations) on the film while it was still in the camera and which would appear at the edge of the finished photograph. The potential of Gaisman’s idea was recognised by George Eastman, who paid him $300,000 ESERIES LITE GESET LAE\n\nSPITS\n\nBAC\n\n(approx. £4.5 million in today’s money) for the rights to his invention. The autographic feature was rolled out across many of Kodak’s _rollfilm cameras and Autographic backs could _ be bought for existing roll-film cameras. The Autographic feature remained on all popular Kodak cameras, other than Brownie box cameras, until the early 1930s. The Autographic Vest Pocket Kodak camera was introduced in 1915. etm\n\nsubject and only two shutter speeds.

The Vest a thoroughly\n\nreliable instrument, and is not at all dear at its price of £1 10s. The film\n\nproduced for use in the camera gave eight exposures per spool and cost 10d. Kodak's internal dealer publication, the Kodak Trade Circular, extolled the\n\ncamera to the photographic trade in its March—April issue, stating that ‘never have we put such good work into such small space’, with the optimistic statement that ‘the Vest Pocket Kodak brings appreciably nearer the time when it will be the exception to stir out of doors without a Kodak’. The remaining issues of the Circular for 1912 were full of accessories and ideas for dealers on how to promote the camera to the public. THE\n\nSOLDIER’S\n\nCAMERA\n\nWith the outbreak of the First World War, the business of photography began\n\nto boom. High-street portrait studios experienced a growth in demand as men called up to serve left their portrait behind for family members; sweethearts were photographed before being separated. Sales of cameras, along with sensitised materials, increased significantly as people bought cameras to record their family members. It was, in fact, a court-martial offence for soldiers to bring a camera to the front, but the regulation was\n\nwidely flouted by officers as well as men. Cameras such as the Ensignette and Vest Pocket Kodak were easily carried and concealed. Kodak noted to its dealers that any fear about the sale of Vest Pocket Kodaks to soldiers and sailors being forbidden by the authorities could be dismissed. It added that ‘Enquiries have failed to disclose any such restsiction. From late 1914, Kodak Ltd in Britain began to promote the Vest Pocket Kodak as ‘The Soldier’s Camera’, with owners being encouraged to ‘make\n\nyour own record of the war’. Kodak saw enormous purchasing power in what it estimated as two million British men in active service. Of these, there were some 50,000 officers and 150,000 non-commissioned officers\n\nwho were all able to afford a Vest Pocket Kodak.\n\n76\n\nThe Vest Pocket Kodak\n\n—\n\nom\n\nel\n\nThe Kodak Trade Circular in January 1915 reported on a Soldier's Kodak Selling Scheme that aimed to encourage dealers to target British soldiers directly with the Vest Pocket Kodak. The scheme noted that there was no difficulty in getting soldiers interested in the Vest Pocket Kodak and it exhorted dealers to: ‘Push now and push hard — next month it may be too late.’ It was a tremendous success with dealers, and Kodak’s promotional material was reprinted several times. The same issue noted that sales of the Vest Pocket Kodak in France were ‘at the present time phenomenal’. Sales of the camera |\n\nin Britain in 1915 were five times those of the previous year and the general boom\n\ncontinued until 1917.\n\nRIGHT Ernest Brooks’s iconic image of silhouetted men of the gt Battalion, East\n\nYorkshire Regiment, going up to the line near Frezenberg.\n\nTHE\n\nOFFICIAL VERSION\n\nconvey the scale of events.

Britain’s first official war photographer appointed by the military was Ernest Brooks (1878-1936), who had previously worked at the Daily Mirror. Using hand-held folding plate, SLR, panoramic and field cameras, Brooks produced around 4,400 images between 1915 and 1918, more than a tenth ofall official\n\nBritish photographs taken during the war. He was known specifically for using the Kodak Panoram No. 4, which recorded an arc of 142 degrees to\n\nofficial photographer to the Admiralty. He was given the honorary rank of Second Lieutenant and in 1916 was transferred to the War Office and sent to photograph the Western Front. He was the only professional photographer to cover the Battle of the Somme — witnessing the successions of troops going over the top. As an offical photographer, his photographs were often posed, and very different to those captured hurriedly by soldiers on the Vest Pocket Kodak, but occasionally his work conveyed some of the horror of the war.\n\n77\n\nTHE\n\nHUMAN\n\nFACE\n\nOF WAR\n\nA great number of images of informal military activity were taken with ‘The Soldier’s Camera’,\n\nsuggesting that Kodak’s intuition — that the camera would be taken to the front line and used to record subjects that had not previously been photographed — was correct. Direct military engagement was rarely the subject of these photographs; they tended to feature views of the trenches, bombed buildings and people, whether local civilians or soldiers relaxing or undertaking social activities. This was evidence that the Vest Pocket Kodak was used to capture the same subjects, albeit in a different context, that the\n\ncivilian population wished to photograph.\n\nRIGHT British soldiers wearing gas masks,\n\nunknown photographer, 1917.This informal photograph away from the front line was almost certainly taken with a Vest Pocket Kodak.\n\n78\n\nThe Vest Pocket Kodak\n\nIf)\n\n° | aim ae My fe,&\n\nThe Thornton—Pickard\n\nMark III Hythe Camera Gun PRODUCED: C. 1918 | country: UK | MANUFACTURER: Thornton—Pickard Manufacturing Company\n\nPE ae |\n\nPTHORNTON-Pickann\n\nIME mrn| 3846.\n\nABOVE The Hythe Mark III camera gun, introduced to help airmen improve their gunnery skills in the First World War.\n\nhe various camera guns that had been produced before the Thornton— Pickard Hythe was introduced had not been serious cameras, despite the fact that they could all take photographs. The Enjalbert Revolver de Poche (see page 44) was realistic, as was the Sands and Hunter Photographic Gun in the form of a rifle, but at £15 (around £1,400 today) the Sands & Hunter was an expensive camera. In many ways, the general design of a gun was ideally suited to photography: both the gun user and the photographer needed a device that was stable and could be aimed at the subject (or target) and fired. It is no coincidence that many terms used for firearms were applied to photography, from shooting one’s subject to firing the shutter and the term ‘snap shot’. The Photographers’ Indispensable Handbook described the Sands and Hunter Gun as ‘art ingenious novelty, but nothing much to recommend it beyond that fact’. That summed up the photographic camera gun. They were too conspicuous to be discreet, and in order to fit the camera into the shape of a gun many compromises were made, which in turn limited their functionality as cameras.\n\n80 _\n\nThe Thornton—Pickard Mark III Hythe Camera Gun\n\n=\n\nTHE WAR\n\nEFFORT\n\nThe Mark III Hythe camera gun was designed to fulfil a practical need: the training of gunners for accuracy, using film as a cheaper alternative to live ammunition. The Thornton—Pickard Manufacturing Company was a large camera manufacturing business located in Altrincham, just south of Manchester, England. It had started manufacturing roller-blind shutters for\n\nuse on field and hand cameras, and gradually moved on to making brass and mahogany field cameras and a range of other cameras. By the start of the First World War, it was one of Britain’s largest photographic equipment manufacturers, along with Houghtons Ltd in London, J. Lancaster and Sons\n\nin Birmingham and A. Kershaw and Sons in Leeds. The outbreak of war in 1914 put an end to the manufacture of cameras for consumers as the government requisitioned factories and gave orders for munitions. Many photographic manufacturers secured contracts for optical munitions, and war work helped to support businesses that were already starting to struggle against German and American competition. A government contract paid for a major factory building for A. Kershaw and Sons, which the business was able to use after the war ended.\n\nBELOW The Type A aerial camera (left) and Type E aerial camera (right), taken from a Thornton— Pickard sales brochure.\n\nFor the first time in an-armed conflict, photography was to play a significant role. It quickly became an important aid to military intelligence, especially when coupled with aircraft, which were also being used for the first time. A demand was created for aerial cameras to use in reconnaissance work. All of Thornton—Pickard’s wartime production was centred on contracts for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC): aerial cameras and camera guns for the training of aircrew. For the early part of the war, the organisation and placement of orders were haphazard and it was not until February 1915 that a serious attempt was made to organise photography for the RFC. Eventually, a unit specifically devoted to aerial photography was established under the leadership of Lieutenant J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon. Thornton—Pickard’s company secretary was called to a meeting with Moore-Brabazon and the design for an aerial camera was worked out. The Type A, made at the company’s factory, was the first official RFC aerial camera for oblique work, where the photograph was taken at an angle to\n\n81\n\nthe ground rather than directly overhead. In the summer of 1915, aType C followed, which was designed to be mounted vertically on the outside of an\n\naircraft. A Type E came out in autumn 1916; this model was intended to be mounted inside an aircraft. This was the last model to be designed and built by the Thornton—Pickard company; the Williamson Manufacturing Company in London made later models. TARGET PRACTICE The other camera Thornton—Pickard went on to design for the armed forces was the Mark III Hythe camera gun. Traditional methods of training in gunnery for land forces could not be applied to aerial combat, where distances between the gunner and the target and their positions were continuously changing. There was therefore a requirement for a camera similar in form and action to a real machine gun. Such a camera was developed at the School of Aerial Gunnery at Hythe in Kent and manufactured by Thornton—Pickard from around 1916.The Mark III was the result of an evolutionary design process and contained significant improvements over the Mark I and II models. The approximate shape of a Lewis gun, with a lens and shutter mechanism fitted inside the gun barrel, the camera made 14 exposures on 120 roll film. The procedure for operating it was.the same as that for a real gun. A marked glass screen placed in the focal plane of the camera provided a guide to the accuracy. of the ‘shooting’. The firing of film rather than bullets was a matter of economy, but it also offered other advantages, which Spencer Leigh Hughes MP described: “The Gun Camera shows and records on the film how many hits the man would have made had he been firing bullets at the aeroplane which he is photographing’ It also provided a precise measurement of how many drums of ‘ammunition’ were being used, as well as being a key tool in helping the gunner to judge distances. Hughes also noted that ‘soon after the authorities had given what was a reluctant consent to have it used for training purposes a very great improvement in the shooting of British aviators was noticed. Indeed, it was so remarkable that it could not be considered as a mere coincidence’ The Hythe Mark III camera gun was manufactured up until the end of the war and was supplied to Britain’s air force and those of her allies France, Italy and America. It continued to be sold to the newly formed Royal Air Force. After the war, Thornton—Pickard’s aerial cameras and camera gun were also supplied to civilian firms, where the latter cost £50. A booklet issued by the company called Aviation Photography described some of the firm’s wartime activities and acted as a sales tool for prospective customers. The Air Ministry, writing in 1919, noted that ‘the value of [tHe Hythe camera gun] cannot be overstated, and the large numbers used testify the importance of this instrument as a means of training pilots to shoot accurately’. By the end of the war, the Thornton—Pickard factory had given up making any cameras other than the Hythe Mark III. Leigh Hughes noted that ‘those who are capable of forming a definite opinion that is worth anything on this matter,\n\n82\n\nThe Thornton—Pickard Mark III Hythe Camera Gun\n\nABOVE Lieutenant S.C.

The reliance of Thornton—Pickard on the Air Ministry contracts was only of short-term benefit to the company. In the postwar era it struggled to develop new products to meet market demands and mostly continued production of updated versions of prewar cameras. The Hythe Mark III continued to be made until 1937. By this time the company was a shadow of its former self, its products having been overtaken by precision-engineered cameras from Germany and amateur cameras from Kodak and Houghton-Butcher, both of which had modern factories able to mass-produce products.\n\nPIONEER\n\nJ.T.

The Ermanox of 1924 was manufactured by the Ernemann company of Dresden and made 4.5 x 6cm (1% x 24im) plate negatives. The camera featured a wide-aperture Ernostar lens designed by Ludwig Bertele, which, at the time, was the widest-aperture lens of any miniature camera. .\n\nAnnounced in July 1924, the Ermanox was a development of the company’s ‘vest pocket’ range of plate cameras.

It was advertised under the headline: ‘Night photography without a Flash Light’ and the British Journal Photographic Almanac noted: ‘The camera has its special uses for indoor shutter exposures under conditions of lighting that would be impossible with lenses of smaller aperture.\n\nAmongst the users of the Ermanox camera were Felix H. Man and Alfred Eisenstaedt. Eisenstaedt became a photographer in 1927 and was later told by an editor: ‘If you want to succeed in photography, you should look at the work of Dr Erich Salomon.’ Salomon, a pioneering news photojournalist (see page 86), used an Ermanox, and Eisenstaedt immediately bought one in the hope of emulating his success. His first commission with the Ermanox was to photograph a meeting of the Salvation Army. Eisenstaedt described the use of the camera in his 1969 book The Eye of Eisenstaedt: “You approach with camera and tripod, ask permission to photograph, and set up. First you must focus through the camera’s ground-glass back, using a small pocket magnifier. Then, put in the metal plate holder with its glass plate, and remove the slide. Next you have to watch very closely. Replace the slide, remove the plate and holder. One shot. In looking back, I’m amazed we were able to get the candid results we did’ He later\n\nABOVE An advertisement for the Ernox, or Ermanox, camera from the British importers Duke & Neddermeyer in the 1925\n\nBritish Journal\n\nPhotographic Almanac.\n\npurchased a Leica camera in 1932, with which he took some of his most\n\nfamous images (see page 90). Another user of the Ermanox was the chemist Dr Hans B6hm, who used\n\nit to photograph Max Reinhardt's theatre performances in Vienna in 1924-5. Using highly sensitive plates, Bohm took photographs from the auditorium of performances as they happened. Shots of theatre productions had previously always been set up, but Bohm was able to capture the actors’ expressions and gestures exactly as the audience saw them.\n\nSES\n\nEET\n\nOEE IE ELD DERI\n\nEAE\n\nEE\n\na\n\nErnostar that were marketed under the name Sonnar.

He moved in 1919 to Ernemann and started to design photographic lenses the same year, a period of work that culminated with the Ernostar. In 1923, he patented his first largeaperture lens, the f/2 Ernostar. With the incorporation of Ernemann into Zeiss Ikon in 1926, Bertele continued his work for the new company. He developed new lenses based on the\n\nsmaller number of lens elements, which\n\nimproved the contrast and lessened light dispersion. In 1932, an f{/1.5 Sonnar was developed; which was fitted to Zeiss Ikon’s Contax cameras. In 1934, Bertele developed a\n\nseries of wide-angle lenses based on the Sonnar,\n\nsold under the Biogon name. From 1943 Bertele worked for Steinheil; after the war he joined the Wild company in Swizterland, as well as\n\ncontinuing to work for Zeiss Ikon. He received his last patent in 1976.\n\n85\n\nABOVE\n\nFrom left to right:\n\nBenito Mussolini, German\n\nChancellor Heinrich Briining and Foreign Minister Julius Curtius in the Hotel Excelsior, Berlin. Taken by Erich Salomon,\n\nAugust 1931.\n\nERICH\n\nSALOMON\n\nThe best-known user of the Ermanox was Erich Salomon. He took up photography to copy documents and soon after acquired an Ermanox camera. He found early fame when, using an Ermanox hidden inside his bowler hat, he photographed defendant on trial for murdering a police officer. From 1928 he worked for the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung as a photographer and quickly earned a reputation for photographing politicians, catching them unawares and in less formal situations than was the norm for such subjects at the time. During the signing of the Kellogg—Briand Pact in Paris in 1928, Salomon boldly helped himself to a vacant seat and captured several photographs of the proceedings. A well-known picture, taken at a conference in Switzerland, shows\n\nministers from world's major powers conversing informally around a small table. Other photographs show conference delegates*casually joking, yawning and chatting. Salomon’s photographs gave them a human dimension missing from the photographs of his contemporaries. In England in 1929, Salomon visited the Appeal Court and photographed judges about to pass a death sentence. He subsequently learned that this was a criminal offence, so he refrained from publishing\n\n86\n\nThe Ermanox\n\nthe picture. He also photographed a session of the United States Supreme Court, one of only two photographers known to have done so. Salomon’s nondescript appearance helped him to slip into meetings unnoticed, but he secured his pictures through a combination of keen observation, photographic expertise and patience. As his fame grew, Salonion came increasingly to be expected at events where politicians gathered. In the early 1930s, at a secret German-—British summit, Dr Otto\n\nBraun, prime minister of Prussia, was asked whether Salomon would be allowed on board the vessel where the meeting was taking place. He is said to have replied: ‘Surely it’s inevitable. Nowadays, you can hold a conference without ministers, but not without Dr Salomon,’ A similar remark is attributed to the French foreign minister, Aristide Briand: ‘Where is Dr Salomon? We can't start without him. People won’t think\n\nthis conference is important at all!’ In 1931, when Salomon was at the height of his fame, he published a\n\nbook, Famous Contemporaries in Unguarded Moments. As the political situation in Germany became increasingly difficult he moved to The Hague in the Netherlands, his wife’s home country. There, he was able to photograph world meetings and Dutch politicians. He continued to travel and photograph surreptitiously in concert halls. After Germany invaded the Netherlands he went into hiding, but he and his family were discovered and taken to a concentration camp. He died in Auschwitz in July 1944. The editor of The Graphic, a London illustrated weekly publication, coined the term ‘candid camera’ for Salomon’s work in its issue of 11 January 1930.The term continues to be used today. Salomon described himself as an historian with a camera. He lived through one of the most remarkable periods of the twentieth century and, uniquely, was able to photograph many of the statesmen associated with it. The Ermanox camera was manufactured until 1931, by which time the Leica was seen as better designed for capturing the type of images that Salomon had photographed.\n\n87\n\nThe Leica I proDucED:\n\nABOVE\n\n1925\n\nfollowing. It has been used by some of the world’s most famous photographers and still inspires an almost cult-like devotion.\n\nGermany\n\n| MANUFACTURER:\n\nLeitz\n\nuch mystique has been attached to the Leica camera. The instrument\n\nAn iconic marque,\n\nintroduced in 1925, the Leica quickly attracted a\n\n| country:\n\nINN Ea was not the first 35mm camera, but it came at a time when there\n\nwas a growing demand by professional photographers for more spontaneous images, to which the 35mm format was ideally suited. The camera was adopted by a group of photographers whose images quickly became part of a wider international visual currency, capturing the era in ways that would previously have been difficult to realise. THE\n\nRISE\n\nOF\n\n35MM\n\nFILM\n\nPerforated 35mm film had been developed around 1891-2 with Edison’s kinematograph and it became the standard format for the nascent cinematography industry. However, it couldn’t be used in still cameras until the sensitivity and quality of the film stock had been improved, with the consistent coating of the emulsion onto the celluloid base. The small size meant that any defect would be more apparent once it was enlarged.\n\n88 -\n\nThe Leica I\n\nOne of the first patents for a 35mm still camera was granted to A. Léo, P Audobard and C. Baradat on 9 March 1908, although there had previously been other designs produced in very small numbers. The 1908 design used a similar mechanism to a motion-picture camera to advance the film. It does not appear to have ever been manufactured, and the first commercially successful 35mm cameras were the French-made Homéos, patented by Colardeau and Richard in 1913, and the American Tourist Multiple, which\n\nappeared the same year. Other designs were also introduced, with none selling in any great number, although the Levy-Roth Minigraph camera of 1915, which took standard 18 x 24mm\n\n(% x lin) ciné frames, the Swiss\n\nSico (1920), the Austrian Amourette (1925) and the American Ansco Memo (1926) achieved some commercial success. THE\n\nMAKING\n\nOF A LEGEND\n\nThe most significant step in popularising the 35mm film format came with the Leica of 1925. It was based on the designs of Oskar Barnack, who had\n\njoined the Leitz optical company in 1911. He had designed a small portable camera to make use of ‘short ends’ of 35mm ciné film. Barnack’s prototype of 1913, named retrospectively the Ur-Leica, was held horizontally, and it\n\nhad a small collapsible lens and a focal-plane shutter. A viewfinder could be mounted on top. The negative was 24 x 36mm (1 x 1 Ain) — twice the usual ciné frame size. After the First World War the camera attracted the attention of Dr Ernst Leitz, and his company decided to produce a series of 31 samples in 1923.A collapsible optical finder was fitted and the camera was calibrated for 40 exposures. The camera was shown to the public at the 1925 Leipzig Spring Fair and became available during the summer, its name being derived from Lei-tz (the company name) and ca-mera. The production camera featured an Anastigmat lens and a self-capping shutter with speeds from ‘4s to oo of a second. Further variants quickly followed, with an Elmax lens and then the standard Elmar lens. The initial lack of slow shutter speeds was overcome by fitting the camera with a standard Compur shutter instead of the internal focal-plane shutter. An important development was the move from lenses fixed to the camera body to interchangeable lenses and, from 1931, a standardised body and lenses, which meant that any Leitz lens would fit any standardised camera body. Leitz supported the camera with an ever-increasing range of accessories to allow it to be used for everything from close-up photography to telephoto work, as well as darkroom equipment. The Leica I was superseded by the Leica II in 1932, which incorporated a built-in rangefinder coupled to the lens. The design remained largely unaltered, other than by incremental improvements, until the Leica M series\n\nwas introduced in 1954.\n\n89\n\nLEFT (above) The Austrian Amourette camera of 1925, which\n\nused 35mm film.

It captured a spontaneous kiss between strangers (or a sexual assault, depending on your analysis) as President Harry\n\n90\n\n__\n\nThe Leica\n\nS. Truman announced the end of the war on Japan. The photograph has become absorbed into wider culture, being represented as statues, in numerous Hollywood films and even in The Simpsons. Over the years, a number of individuals have claimed to be in the photograph, but the identities of the two people kissing have never been confirmed.\n\nThe Leica became a success where early and even contemporary designs failed because Leitz built it to a very high standard, as one would expect from an optical instrument maker. The body and parts were precisely engineered and supported by a range of high-quality lenses. These were calculated by Max Berek and others directly working for Leitz and were specifically designed to be used on the camera with the 24 x 36mm negative size. This combination allowed good enlargements to be made from what was, for the period, a small negative. The format was termed\n\nsub-miniature, reflecting most photographers’ familiarity with roll film and with plates giving negatives at least four times the size. The strengths of the camera were not immediately recognised by the photographic press. But the British Journal Photographic Almanac described the Leica as ‘quite an innovation in pocket cameras’ and noted its quality: ‘in design and workmanship the camera is of the highest description.’ The\n\nABOVE Leica advertising poster, c. 1930.\n\ncamera, which included a fixed lens, sold for £22, with the separate\n\nrangefinder costing another £2. One thousand cameras were sold in its first year, and by 1932, when the Leica II was introduced, some 90,000 cameras had been sold. For many photographers, the high quality of the Leica’s mechanics, its cosmetic build and its optical quality set it apart from other cameras and helped to establish a reputation that persists today. A NEW\n\nBREED\n\nOF PHOTOGRAPHER\n\nA new breed of what would be termed photojournalists adopted the Leica. They required a small, portable and unobtrusive camera that could be successfully used in a variety of situations and conditions. By 1954, when the camera was fully redesigned, many photographers who would become household names had used the Leica, producing a range of iconic images of the 1930s and, particularly, of the Second World War. Alfred Eisenstaedt, Robert Capa, André Kertész, Andreas Feininger, Aleksander Rodchenko, Leni Riefenstahl, Robert Doisneau, Bert Hardy and\n\nGeorge Rodger all used the first-series Leica cameras. For many, these cameras were so reliable that they continued to give good service long after they had been superseded by the M series. Despite competitors such as the Contax and Kine Exakta, the Leica retained its status as ‘the photographer’s camera’ and it was not seriously challenged until the arrival of the Nikon F in 1959.\n\nSit\n\nLEFT By Henri CartierBresson, Alicante, Spain, 1933.This image was\n\ntaken with his first Leica camera (pictured below).\n\nHENRI\n\nCARTIER-BRESSON\n\nIn September and October 1933 Henri Cartier-Bresson and an Exhibition of Anti-Graphic Photography was showing at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York City. Cartier-Bresson (1908-2004) had only purchased his first 35mm Leica that same year but was to become one of the most famous photographers to use the camera. He was given a box Brownie as a child and studied art as a young adult, but did not discover his passion for photography until 1930 when he saw a photograph by Hungarian photojournalist Martin Munkacsi that inspired him to move from painting to photography. After initial landmark exhibitions in New York and Madrid in 1933, he began travelling the world in search of new subjects to photograph. The Leica proved the perfect partner for Cartier-Bresson; its quick and unobtrusive nature matched and informed his feline style of shooting. He even went so far as to cover the camera's aluminium casing with black leather tape to make it less visible, enabling him to capture his subjects without their knowledge and remain an unnoticed witness to events. He was involved in founding Magnum Photos in 1947, Robert Capa’s brainchild, with David Seymour, George Rodger and William Vandivert. The organisation was the first co-operative agency for worldwide freelance photographers. The significance of his work was appropriately honoured in 1947 with a one-man exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1952, he published his most influential book, The Decisive Moment —\n\na phrase that perfectly reflects the momentary genius of his images and the Leica’s instantaneous capabilities.\n\n92\n\nThe Leica I\n\nRIGHT\n\nBy Henri\n\nCartier-Bresson.

One of the\n\nthe Leica II.\n\nlargest quality-camera manufacturers was the German Zeiss Ikon AG, based in\n\nDresden. The company had been formed in 1926 as a result of the merger of four of the leading German camera makers — Contessa-Nettel, Ernemann,\n\nC. P Goerz and Ica — under the auspicessof the lens manufacturer Carl Zeiss of Jena. Each of these companies was a well-established and successful business,\n\nbut merging gave them greater financial stability and strength at a time when the postwar German economy was struggling and inflation was affecting\n\nconsumer buying power. Zeiss Ikon offered something for everyone: from simple box cameras through to more complex instruments intended for amateurs and professional photographers, along with the accessories, films and supporting materials needed for photography. Initially, the company simply rebadged cameras made by its constituent companies, but gradually these were improved and new models introduced. The Ernemann company had a history of producing small precision cameras such as the Ermanox, with its fast f/1.8 lens, and this\n\nexperience was used in developing new products. Zeiss Ikon’s Kolibri, which used 127 roll film, was popular, as were smaller roll-film cameras such as the Baby Ikonta. It was increasingly clear that a 35mm camera was needed to meet the expectations of customers and to compete head-on with Leitz’s Leica.\n\n94\n\n—\n\nThe Contax I\n\nTHE\n\nUNIVERSAL\n\nCAMERA\n\nOF TODAY\n\nAND\n\nTOMORROW\n\nIn spring 1932, Zeiss Ikon announced its competitor to the Leica II, which it called the Contax camera. The name was chosen after a poll among its employees and Dr Heinz Kippenbender, a doctor of engineering, was the camera’s main designer. The camera was made between 1932 and 1936. Like the Leica, the Contax featured a built-in rangefinder coupled to the\n\nlens, but the features and fittings on the camera were similiar to other Zeiss Ikon cameras. The Contax body was square-cut rather than having the rounded corners of the Leica; it featured interchangeable Zeiss lenses that\n\ncoupled to the camera using a bayonet mount rather than a screw thread; and it was considerably heavier than the Leica. However, the biggest difference was in the shutter. The Contax shutter moved vertically and was made up of metal blinds, in contrast to the horizontally running cloth blinds of the Leica. The Zeiss Ikon shutter recalled the Contessa-Nettel shutter; although innovative, it was prone to jamming, for which the Contax quickly gained a reputation. The camera’s back removed completely, which made it easier to load than the Leica. Loading the Leica involved removing the baseplate and undertaking a fiddly process, with the potential for the film not to be properly secured to the take-up spool and leading to an unexposed roll of film. Like the Leica, the Contax was advertised as a system camera with a range of lenses and accessories all designed to make the camera usable across a wide range of subjects and applications, such as copying work and\n\nRIGHT The Contax I was introduced with a range of accessories to ensure\n\nthat the camera appealed to as wide a market as possible. This advertising brochure from c. 1936 shows a Contax I mounted\n\non a copying stand.\n\n95\n\nLEFT\n\nA Contax IIIa\n\ncamera with built-in light meter mounted above the lens, with standard,\n\nwide-angle and telephoto Zeiss lenses.\n\nphotomicrography. The lenses were designed by Ludwig Bertele (see page 85), who had previously worked for Ernemann and had designed the if 2\n\nErnostar. For many photographers, the Contax lenses were superior to their equivalent Leica lenses. Bertele’s designs reduced the number of air-to-glass surfaces. This ensured that the light was transmitted with fewer imperfections through the lens to the film. In the years before lens coating, which further aided the transmission of light, became widespread, this had significant advantages for contrast and reduced lens flare. In 1935, Bertele introduced the Zeiss Sonnar f/2.8 180mm lens, which was available for the\n\n1936 Olympic Games held in Berlin. The Contax was advertised from the outset as “The Universal Camera of today and tomorrow’. The company noted the key features of the camera as: all-metal construction, including the shutter; speeds from '/s to 'Aooo of a second; a rangefinder coupled to the lens for accurate focusing; automatic\n\nfilm transport to avoid double exposures; easy film loading; available for use with any 35mm film and a wide range of Zeiss lenses. The camera sold for £24 10s (around £1,500 today), including an f/3.5 50mm Tessar lens. The\n\nLeica II, which was the direct competitor for the Contax, sold for £22 (£1,300 today), including an f/3.5 50mm Elmar lens. A review of the Contax printed in the British Journal Photographic Almanac for 1933, which also carried a review for the Leica II, was positive: ‘beautifully\n\nmade and finished, this little camera may be said to represent the very last word in miniature de luxe camera construction’. New models, the Contax II and Contax III, were introduced in 1936 to compete with new Leica models. The I, which was manufactured until\n\n1942, featured an extended shutter-speed range and the III, also only made until 1942, when the war stopped production of both models, had a built-in selenium-cell exposure meter. The new models featured rounded corners and came in a chrome finish, with updated controls and fittings. The British Journal Photographic Almanac for 1937 noted that the II featured ‘radical\n\nconstructional improvements which make for great ease in manipulation’. The price was increased significantly to £40 10s for the II and £53 for the III. The last Contax model, the Ila, was made in 1961. By then, the\n\n96\n\nThe Contax I\n\nadvantages of the single-lens reflex had become apparent and SLRs began to dominate the market. The market for the Contax camera, especially the models II and III, lay\n\nwith the professional photographer, photojournalists and those working in industry. Robert Capa (see page 98) and Margaret Bourke-White both used the Contax. Eliot Elisofen used a Contax III extensively when he was on assignment in the Second World War, during which the Life magazine\n\nphotographers George Silk and Carl Mydans also carried several Contax II bodies with them. The Leica, although popular during the war, was given a good run by the Contax, which was often preferred because ofits Zeiss lenses and wide apertures. These gave it the edge when shooting in difficult or low-light conditions. The mechanics of the camera, despite the shutter’s propensity to jam qn the earlier models, were also more robust. For the amateur, the Retina camera introduced by Kodak AG in 1934\n\nwas a more affordable option. It was designed by Dr August Nagel, who had previously worked for Contessa-Nettel and had then joined Zeiss Ikon AG before leaving in 1928 to set up his own company. By 1939, the Retina had sold some 266,000 units. In 1937 the first Canon rangefinder camera was marketed in Europe, a forerunner of the competition Zeiss Ikon could expect after the war. The Contax II and III cameras were reintroduced after the Second World War as the Ila and IIa, with updated specifications, but by then they faced stiff competition from Japanese-made rangefinder cameras modelled on the Leica.\n\nTHE TWIN-LENS CONTAFLEX A number of Zeiss Ikon’s other cameras incorporated design or mechanical elements from the Contax range. The Super Nettel and Nettax cameras, for example, were essentially Contax shutter units with folding fronts. The Tenax II featured a rapid film advance lever. The most significant development was the introduction of the twin-lens Contaflex in 1935. The camera was essentially a streamlined Contax body with a viewing lens mounted above it. But it was far more than that: it was the first camera to have a fully built-in exposure meter. Although a masterpiece of Zeiss Ikon engineering and design, the camera was very heavy and its lens mount was not compatible with Contax lenses. Priced at £64 (around £3,900 today) and above, it saw only limited demand.\n\n97\n\nROBERT\n\nCAPA\n\nPerhaps the greatest of all Contax users was Robert Capa (1913-1954) — and of all the images he took using the camera, perhaps the best remembered are 11 surviving images taken on Omaha Beach during the D-day landings in 1944 for Life magazine. Armed with little more than two Contax II cameras with fixed 50mm lenses and his Rollei and Speed Graphic packed in oilskin bags, Capa was among the first wave of troops to arrive on the beach that June day. His famous maxim was: ‘If your photographs aren't good enough, you're not close enough,\n\nand on Omaha Beach he couldn’t have been closer to the action. Over a 90-minute period he took 106 photographs — the most famous of which was of a young soldier under fire, half submerged in the water. Shortly after taking this image, while Capa was trying to change the film, his Contax jammed and he found himself panicking and heading for a landing craft that was taking wounded men back to the ships. Suddenly he found himself covered in feathers from dead soldiers’ life jackets as the landing craft was shot away. Capa made it safely back to the mother ship before returning to England to send his film to the magazine’s London headquarters — where subsequently almost all the images were accidentally destroyed in the darkroom. Despite being offered various other assignments over the years, Capa was drawn to conflicts and was known for earlier photographs of the Spanish Civil War and the second Sino-Japanese War, as well as later coverage of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He was on assignment in South East Asia in 1954, photographing the First Indochina War, when he stepped on a landmine. He was found by fellow photographers John Mecklin and Jim Lucas with his left leg blown off and serious chest wounds,\n\nhis left hand still clutching his Contax II. He died in a field hospital shortly after.\n\n98\n\n—\n\n;\n\nThe Contax I\n\nso\n\nak\n\nABOVE A frame from Robert Capa’s D-Day landings film, 6 June\n\n1944, Of four rolls of 35mm sent back to Life magazine, only 11 frames survived an accident\n\nduring processing.\n\n99\n\nThe Voigtlander Prominent PRODUCED:\n\nABOVE\n\nThe Voigtlander\n\nProminent camera of 1933.\n\n1933\n\n| couNtTRY: Germany\n\n| MANUFACTURER: Voigtlander\n\nhe standard style of roll-film camera that was popular from the late 1890s until the 1950s had a baseboard that dropped from the body of the camera, along which the lens board was pulled. In more complex cameras of this type, opening the camera automatically pulled down the lens board into position via mechanical struts. The lens was connected to the back of the camera with light-tight bellows. Manufacturers generally produced a variety of models, from simple versions to better-quality ones with improved lens and shutter combinations, and across a range of film sizes. Beyond this there was little that could be done to reduce the potential for technical failures resulting from user error. a The Prominent, which was introduced in 1933, was an attempt by the\n\nGerman Voigtlander company to bring together some improvements to the general design. The camera was sprung so that when a button on the side was pressed, the baseboard opened out and brought with it the lens section, which\n\nwas locked into position by struts, ready for taking photographs. A rangefinder\n\n=\n\na\n\nThe Voigtlander Prominent\n\nBELOW Frances ‘Alice’ Griffiths, photographed\n\nby her cousin Elsie ‘Iris’ Wright using her father Arthur’s Midg quarterplate camera, the first\n\nin the ‘Cottingley\n\nFairies’ series.\n\nwas automatically coupled to the lens via a series of mechanical linkages. The focusing distance could be set in advance and the camera was ready for making the exposure. An extinction light meter, a simple but reasonably effective exposure meter, was fitted to the camera side. The camera produced eight exposures, each of 6 x 9cm (24 x 3%in) on film, but a metal mask could be fitted in the film plane that would allow sixteen 4.5 x 6cm (1% X 2’Ain) exposures. The British Journal Photographic Almanac, reviewing the camera in 1934, noted: ‘The Voigtlander designers have excelled themselves in providing many new features in a camera of remarkable portability considering the facilities it provides.’ The camera sold for £26 5s (£1,500 today) with a Voigtlander Heliar f/4.5 lens. Although the camera offered many technical improvements, the different controls and fittings protruding from the body made it aesthetically unappealing, and it did not sell well. Meanwhile, Voigtlander’s existing range of roll-film cameras remained popular and it was clear the market was not yet ready for the refinements the Prominent offered. By the end of the decade the Kodak Super Six-20 (see page 124) incorporated more automation, at a moderate price and in a body that was better designed, which made it more attractive than the Prominent. Voigtlander revived the name after the Second World War for a range of high-quality 35mm cameras that were much more successful.\n\nTHE COTTINGLEY FAIRIES Folding cameras like the Prominent were popular and sold well to the mass amateur market, which made them ideal for younger people to use. On display at the National Media Museum in Bradford, England, are a folding plate\n\nand a falling plate camera. The two cameras were used to fool everyone from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Kodak experts. In 1917 two British girls — Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths — borrowed Elsie’s father’s camera to create a series of images of themselves appearing to play with ‘fairies’ at the bottom of the garden — the fairies were in fact paper illustrations propped up using twigs and hat pins. Thanks to a 1920 article written by the Sherlock Holmes author and featured in the Strand Magazine, the fairies became a national\n\nsensation, with the girls claiming they were real until 1983, when Elsie revealed how they were really made in a BBC programme.\n\n101\n\n23\n\nThe Coronet Midget pRoDUCED: 1934 | country: UK | manuracturer: Coronet Camera Company\n\nABOVE A cheap plastic camera produced in\n\na range of colours for the snapshooter.\n\nhe Coronet Camera Company was established in Birmingham, England, around 1926 by Frederick Pettifer to produce a range of cheap cameras for the mass market. By May 1927, the company was selling a large range of simple, low-cost cameras, along with accessories and film that it bought in and relabelled with the Coronet name. The British Journal Photographic Almanac reported in 1934: ‘Realising the vast market which exists for snapshot cameras of very low price, the Coronet Camera Co. have produced a series of models very suitable for this market and of excellent construction at their prices. While low price has been a chief consideration the construction is very good and the cameras are undoubtedly capable of giving very good results and long service. The company’s production was mostly confined to box cameras and simple folding roll-film cameras. By 1933, the company was claiming an audited\n\nnet sale of 510,000 cameras and it advertised: “We believe that this figure is greater than all the combined total sales of all British owned and controlled camera companies.’\n\n102\n\nThe Coronet Midget\n\nNOT\n\nJUST\n\nA NOVELTY\n\nOR A TOY\n\nThe Coronet Midget was announced around 1934 as “The World’s Smallest Camera for Fine Photography’. It was made from moulded plastic in a range of colours and sold for 5s 6d (around £17 today).The company’s advertisement in the 1936 British Journal Photographic Almanac described the camera optimistically as ‘Not as long as a cigarette... In every way a REAL Camera and not just a\n\nnovelty or toy’. Technically, the camera was simple, with a Taylor, Taylor and Hobson single meniscus f/10 lens that focused from 60 inches (5ft/1.5m) to infinity and a shutter that gave a speed of 0 second. It used tiny spools of paper-backed 16mm film and weighed 71g (2'%0z).The company produced a small range of accessories including a Morocco leatherette carry case lined with coloured silk to match the camera and a viewer to magnify the resulting images. The camera was a departure for the Coronet Camera Company, which had generally made and assembled its own cameras from cardboard and metal, buying in lenses and some of the camera fittings. The Midget was made from Bakelite, to which the lens and shutter mechanism and fittings | were added. The camera was initially available in black, walnut, green and rose Bakelite, and around 1937 a blue model was added.

The first British camera with an all-plastic body was the Amalgamated Photographic Manufacturers’ Ltd Rajar No. 6 camera, patented in 1929. It was mainly used as a promotional camera given away in return for coupons, most commonly from cigarette manufacturers. The camera was cheap to produce and had a special spool that allowed only the manufacturer's own film to be used, thereby ensuring ongoing sales and profits. Kodak Ltd introduced a similar camera in 1930 made from brown Bakelite plastic, the Hawkette, which was also used as a gift in return for coupons. Between\n\n1930 and 1932, some\n\n34,920 Hawkette cameras\n\nwere given away. Elsewhere, Soho Ltd made the Soho model B, Pilot, Cadet and Tuon\n\ncameras in plastic or, in the comany’s own words, ‘Synthetic Moulded Materials’, between 1930 and 1933. Kodak also sold plastic-bodied\n\ncameras, including the Baby Brownie and the Baby Brownie Special, both of which were designed by Walter Dorwin Teague. The Coronet Midget showed what was possible and what the public would accept, as well as being a commercial success. The Coronet Camera Company introduced the miniature Vogue camera, made in streamlined brown Bakelite, in\n\n1936; after the war, the company tried to recreate the success of the Midget with the Cameo in 1947.The British Purma Special camera, made from black plastic, appeared in 1937, taking 12 pictures on 127 roll film and featuring a distinctive shutter; this returned in a new form after the war.\n\nThe Midget continued to be listed and sold until 1940.\n\n104\n\nThe Coronet Midget\n\nABOVE Three plasticbody cameras.

Canon and Nikon have dominated the market for professional and amateur single-lens reflex cameras since the 1970s, first as film cameras and more recently with their digital models.\n\nThe founder of Seiki KK, Goro Yoshida, Saburo Uchida and Takeo Maeda were three photography enthusiasts who were determined to build the first Japanese 35mm camera, with the intention of rivalling the Leica and Contax\n\nrangefinder cameras. The two German-made marques were prohibitively expensive at around ¥420, when the average graduate salary was around ¥70 per month. Yoshida established the company in November 1933 ina modest Tokyo appartment. Born in Hiroshima, Goro Yoshida moved to Tokyo to become an apprentice repairer of movie cameras and projectors. In the late 920s he frequently travelled to Shanghai on business. A story, possibly apocryphal, relates that Yoshida was inspired to make quality cameras by an American buisnessman he met in Shangai, who suggested to him that a country that already made successful aircraft and battleships ought to be able to make good cameras too, without having to source parts overseas.\n\n106\n\nThe Canon Hansa\n\nThe first design produced by the company was the Kwanon, named after the many-armed Buddhist goddess of mercy. Yoshida designed the camera after he had taken apart and studied a Leica II camera. When asked about his motive in doing this, Yoshida explained: ‘I just disassembled the camera without any specific plan, but simply to take a look at each part. I found there were no special items like diamonds inside the camera. The parts were made from brass, aluminium, iron and rubber. I was surprised that when these inexpensive\n\nmaterials were put together into a camera, it demanded an exorbitant price. This made me angry. It is uncertain whether the original Kwanon was actually put into production, although it was advertised between July and September 1934, and a purported prototype was sold at auction in 2006. The first Canon would come the following year and required a collaborative effort. In the autumn of 1934, the German Leitz company took out a Japanese patent for\n\nits method of coupling the Leica’s lenses to its rangefinder, and Seiki KK responded by asking Nippon Kogaku to design a new lens mount system for its own cameras. Nippon Kogaku was already a well-established optical equipment manufacturer with a history dating back to 1917; in 1948 it would introduce its own camera, the Nikon. In the 1930s, the company was looking to diversify its mostly military production with optical products for civilian use, and the request from Seiki KK was timely. The collaboration between the two companies cresulted in the Canon Hansa camera, fitted\n\nwith Nippon Kogaku’s Nikkor f/3.5 50mm lens. THE\n\nFIRST\n\nASIAN\n\n35MM\n\nCAMERA\n\nThe Canon Hansa camera was produced in 1935 and introduced to the market in February 1936. As well as the lens and the lens mount, Nippon Kogaku designed the viewfider optics and the rangefinder mechanism. Seiki KK assembled the camera and made the body and the shutter, which was of the focal-plane type. Seiki KK changed the camera’s name from Kwanon to Canon; the ‘Hansa’ trademark belonged to the company in charge of Seiki KK’s sales and marketing, Omiya Shashin Yohin Co., Ltd. The camera was sold for ¥250, which included a case. By 1938, Seiki KK was advertising\n\nthe Hansa Canon in Britain as it attempted to develop an export market for the camera. A series of new models, the S (April 1939), J (April 1939), NS\n\n(November 1939) and JS (1939), followed, until the Second World War interrupted production in 1941. In addition, from July 1937 the Seiki KK company worked on its own lenses. Yoshizo Furukawa, the company’s first optical engineer, developed some lenses on a trial basis and a series of Canon lenses was introduced under the Serenar trade name. The prewar rangefinder Canon camera models did not sell in large numbers but they were important as they showed that Japan was able to make a 35mm rangefinder camera and lenses that could potentially compete with Leica and Contax, even if they were cruder in their construction than their German counterparts.\n\n107\n\nannCANON CAMERA Moug CANON LENS (@@\n\nwith\n\nABOVE\n\nThe Canon IVSB\n\ncamera, made\n\n1952-1955,\n\nwas the successor to the Canon Hansa.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nWhen the Second World War ended on 15 August 1945, Seiki was able to give consideration to restarting production. The factory had escaped major damage, but due to the lack of raw materials and the unstable conditions in\n\nthe aftermath of war, company president Takeshi Mitarai decided not to proceed straight away, declaring: ‘Since I am at a loss about what to do, I will shut down the plants and disband the company immediately. But, remember to come back as soon as I call you back for restoration.’ In the months following the end of the war, the Allied occupation forces showed\n\ninterest in Japanese cameras, which encouraged Seiki to submit an application for permission to produce consumer goods. This was granted on 1 October 1945.The first postwar models launched by the company were the Canon J and J-II, which were made using remaining stocks of prewar\n\ncamera parts. Around 560 examples were made. In October 1946, the first all-new model, the S-II, was introduced, which sold some\n\n15,000—-18,000\n\nunits. In 1947, Seiki KK changed its name to Canon Camera Company Ltd; the company was fully back in business. : With the resumption of production in 1946, the business model that Seiki KK had established with its Canon cameras was adopted more widely. European cameras were taken apart and assessed, and Japanese companies worked out how to manufacture them more cheaply. Its prewar experience gave Canon a headstart in developing its own camera range.\n\n108\n\n_\n\nThe Canon Hansa\n\nGROWTH\n\nOF THE JAPANESE\n\nCAMERA\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nNippon Kodak introduced its own rangefinder camera in 1948, which it based, in part, on the German Contax camera. The lens mount was almost a\n\ndirect copy, meaning that most lenses were interchangeable. The quality of Japanese optics was increasingly recognised and the Canon and Nikon cameras were sought out by photographers travelling to cover the war in Korea. Photojournalists such as David Douglas Duncan used Nikkor lenses on their Leica cameras, and later would also buy Nikon cameras as\n\nconfidence in their reliability grew. Around this time, other Japanese manufacturers also entered the market — Chiyoca, Honor, Leotax, Minolta, Nicca, Tanack, Tower and Yashica — with\n\ndesigns mainly based on the Leica. Japanese cameras’ reputation for quality was gaining ground ; The move within the Japanese camera industry from simply copying European camera designs to developing their own and advancing them technically, principally with SLR cameras such as the Nikon F and Pentax Spotmatic (see pages 160 and 172), was key. Japanese camera manufacturers were now well placed to exploit a market that was ready for an easy-to-use, competitively priced design of proven quality. By establishing sales organisations or partnerships with companies in other countries to sell and market their products, Japanese companies soon went on to d"
