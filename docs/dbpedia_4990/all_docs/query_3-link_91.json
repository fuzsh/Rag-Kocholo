        "text": "Samsung has announced two new large high-end Android handsets: the Galaxy S6 Edge+ and the Galaxy Note 5.\n\nBoth phones have 5.7in (14.5cm) screens and are going on sale earlier in the year than their previous generations.\n\nThe launches follow five successive falls in Samsung Electronics' quarterly profits.\n\nAnalysts say the popularity of mid-range phones from Chinese rivals, and Apple's shift to bigger iPhones, have dented demand for Samsung's devices.\n\nThe company also revealed that its smart wallet service, Samsung Pay - which allows the phones to trigger payment card transactions - would go live in South Korea on 20 August.\n\nThat service will be extended to the US on 28 September and then to the UK and Spain at an unspecified date.\n\nIn a change of strategy, the South Korean firm has no plans at present to release the Note 5 in Europe - a decision it says is purely for marketing reasons.\n\nOne company-watcher said that could be a mistake.\n\n\"The Note would have been a good fit for Europe's enterprise market, and if Samsung expects the S6 Edge+ to attract the same business users I don't believe it will succeed,\" commented Francisco Jeronimo from market research firm IDC.\n\nUnlike last year, there is no \"edge\" edition of the Note.\n\nInstead, the Galaxy S6 Edge+ is targeted at those who want a \"phablet\"-sized handset with curved sides.\n\nThe \"plus\" in its name refers to the fact that its screen is both 0.6in (1.5cm) larger than the earlier edition and more scratch-resistant.\n\nIt now has an extra gigabyte of memory, taking it up to 4GB of RAM to aid multi-tasking, but uses the same in-house Exynos processor as before.\n\nThis marks a change from the S5 Plus, which was the same size but contained a faster processor than the original S5.\n\nThe decision to host a standalone press conference for the handsets marks a change of strategy for Samsung.\n\nAll the previous versions of the Note were unveiled at Germany's annual Ifa tech show, which is still three weeks away. The S5 Plus was announced last October in a low-key press release.\n\nOne of the benefits of announcing the new models together at this point is that it should give Samsung about a month's lead on Apple - reports suggest the US firm will update its own smartphones on 9 September, external.\n\n\"One reason Samsung may have done this was to get the announcements out ahead of all the other smartphone makers - both those at Ifa and Apple afterwards.\n\n\"The other rationale is that it needs to get these new models into the market quickly because it's under competitive pressure, and has accelerated its launch plans.\"\n\nSamsung's launch, however, has coincided with Xiaomi's surprise unveiling of a new phablet - the Redmi Note 2 - earlier in the day at a Beijing event.\n\nMr Fogg added that he too believed the decision not to launch the Note 5 in Europe was \"surprising and \"disappointing\".\n\n\"One of Samsung's challenges is that although both products will not be available globally, the announcement will be communicated globally,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the risks is that consumers will learn of both products, not be able to buy one of them in certain geographies and then defer their purchase.\"\n\nThe new phones go on sale on 21 August."
