        "text": "Even before Mobile World Congress (MWC) officially kicked off, the hype got stronger as big names show new devices in Barcelona.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge: A bendable smartphone\n\nIs Samsung tightening the match with Apple on design? For the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, it has finally abandoned its traditional plastic shell and replaced it with very sleek metal frames. Galaxy S6 Edge will be the first smartphone that can bend. Not exactly like a rubber of course, but the top and bottom part can tilt. Wonder what surfing with Opera Mini will be like here. But before we test that out, take a look from Unbox Therapy’s video:\n\nHuawei Watch: The Rolex of smartwatches?\n\nWith 42mm diameter in the watch surface, the Huawei Watch is compact and has a design typical for the luxury watch market. Straps also come in sizes that fit women’s wrists. Like most of its siblings, this watch will have a fitness tracker, heart rate monitor and bluetooth for sharing. Huawei explains more the idea behind this wearable Android:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/lrrC7SbiyMw\n\nLast year, we made a version of Opera Mini for the Samsung Gear S. Browsing with Opera Mini on it looks pretty awesome. Take a look here.\n\nHTC One M9 and M9 Plus: Unsurprising but more powerful\n\nThe M9 is the successor to HTC One M8 with improvements on the specs side. Its UltraPixel camera is moved from the back to the front, giving space to a 20-megapixel sensor. And, here’s an added perk: it now powers a 2,900mAh battery and is expected to last much longer than the M8. Take a closer look from this hands-on preview by The Verge:"
