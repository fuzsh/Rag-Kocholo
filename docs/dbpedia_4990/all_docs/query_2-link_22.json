        "text": "The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge have been officially announced, and a lot was revealed by Samsung at their Unpacked event at MWC yesterday, but not surprisingly, the company left out any information pertaining to the prices of the two handsets. Head over the jump to find out what the actual prices would be for the smartphones.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 is way beyond that rumor and speculative stage, where perhaps the only thing left, apart from real-world reviews, are the price tags that the S6 and its twin sibling with the curved edge display will be carrying. According to SamMobile, despite Samsung not announcing the prices, has managed to get in touch with the officials present at MWC, who were quite happy to reveal the pricing on the S6 and the S6 Edge.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 will reportedly start out at €699 (781 U.S. Dollars) which would be the base model coming in with 32GB of onboard storage. The 64GB variant will be priced at €799 (893 U.S. Dollars), while the massive 128GB configuration model will carry a €899 (1,004 U.S. Dollars) price tag. Now if you’re thinking you can get the beast of a Note 4 for much cheaper, you’re right, but the S6 has some significant improvements over the monstrous phablet. Apart from the screen size, the S6 is clearly leading the pack – be it the Note 4 – with faster hardware and some truly impressive camera capabilities which will be looked at more closely as review units swirl around.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 Edge however does have me intrigued even if the whole experience with the edge based swipe gestures is short-lived at best, but it’s that pricing that may have a lot of people more concerned. The more appealing variant of the S6 will cost €150 (167 U.S. Dollars) more than the standard S6 for all three of the storage configurations. The 32GB S6 Edge will priced at €849 (949 U.S. Dollars), 64GB at €949 (1,060 U.S. Dollars), with the 128GB model will be coming in at €1,049 (1,172US Dollars). It is unclear though what the prices in the United States will be like.\n\nVery steep price tags definitely, but this time around, Samsung seems to have really upped its game big time, with a very nice use of the whole metal-meets-glass approach, where the glass rear coupled with the color choices add so much more character to the phones, the S6 Edge in particular.\n\n(Source: SamMobile)"
