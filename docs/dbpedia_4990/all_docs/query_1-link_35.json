        "text": "Overview\n\nIn the Local Gantt chart, dependencies allow you to define relationships between tasks and visualize the sequence in which they must be completed in order to close a project.\n\nThere are two steps to creating a dependency—first, identify the predecessor and successor tasks and then establish a relationship between them.\n\nBy definition, the predecessor is the first task; it controls the start or end date for all related successor tasks. The successor, by contrast, is the task whose start or end date is controlled by the predecessor.\n\nA dependency is the relationship between predecessor and successor tasks. Tasks may have multiple predecessors or multiple successors. Before you begin establishing dependencies, it’s important to understand that there are four types:\n\nFinish to Start (FS)—The predecessor ends before the successor can begin.\n\nStart to Start (SS)—The predecessor begins before the successor can begin.\n\nFinish to Finish (FF)—The predecessor ends before the successor can end.\n\nStart to Finish (SF)—The predecessor begins before the successor can end.\n\nDependencies can be managed from the Local Gantt in both the Tasks list and the Schedule.\n\nHow to Add a Dependency in the Schedule\n\nHover over Projects in the left navigation, and select your project.\n\nIn the project workspace, click the Gantt tab. The Local Gantt chart opens.\n\nIn the Schedule section on the right side of the screen, hover over the predecessor task bar until a circle appears at either edge. The left circle represents the task’s Start date, and the circle on the right represents its Finish date.\n\nHover over the circle until it turns gray and your cursor becomes a pointer.\n\nClick and drag. You'll notice that circles appear at the beginning and end of a different task bar when you hover over it.\n\nNote: As you hover over areas where a dependency can't be created, you'll see a red Invalid message. Once you hover over areas where it can be created, this changes to a green Valid message.\n\nContinue dragging the dotted line to a circle on your successor task (either the Start date on the left, or the Finish date on the right) and then release.\n\nThe dependency is created, represented by a gray arrow that points from the predecessor to the successor.\n\nHow to Add a Dependency in the Tasks List\n\nWhen establishing dependencies from the Tasks list, you must add a predecessor from the successor task. In other words, you begin with the successor and then add a predecessor to it.\n\nHover over Projects in the left navigation, and select your project.\n\nIn the project workspace, click the Gantt tab. The Local Gantt chart opens.\n\nIn the Predecessors column, double-click on the successor task for which you’re establishing the dependency.\n\nType the line # of the predecessor task (e.g. 5), followed by the initialism for the type of dependency that you’re establishing (finish to start=FS, start to start=SS, finish to finish=FF, and start to finish=SF).\n\nNote: You can also click the drop-down arrow on the right side, select the predecessor task, and then indicate the type from the menu that appears.\n\nYour new dependency appears in the Schedule as a gray arrow pointing from the predecessor to the successor.\n\nHow to Change a Dependency Type in the Schedule\n\nHover over Projects in the left navigation, and select your project.\n\nIn the project workspace, click the Gantt tab. The Local Gantt chart opens.\n\nIn the Schedule, double-click the dependency task you want to change the type for. The Information modal opens.\n\nSelect either the Predecessors or Successors tab.\n\nIn-line with the specific dependency, select a new option from the Type drop-down.\n\nClick Save.\n\nHow to Delete a Dependency in the Schedule\n\nHover over Projects in the left navigation, and select your project.\n\nIn the project workspace, click the Gantt tab. The Local Gantt chart opens.\n\nIn the Schedule, double-click the dependency task you want to change the type for. The Information modal opens.\n\nUnder the Successors tab, click the Delete (“ ”) icon in the bottom-left corner.\n\nNote: If there is more than one dependency under the Successors tab, select the one you want to delete.\n\nClick Save.\n\nHow to Delete a Dependency in the Tasks List\n\nHover over Projects in the left navigation, and select your project.\n\nIn the project workspace, click the Gantt tab. The Local Gantt chart opens.\n\nIn the Tasks list on the left, double-click the Predecessors column in-line with the specific task, and then delete the value.\n\nDouble-click the Successors column, and then delete the value.\n\nCascade Dependencies\n\nWith the Gantt chart’s cascade dependencies functionality, any time you establish a dependency or modify a Start and/or Finish date, changes automatically roll down to dependent tasks so you don’t have to manually change the dates of all successors.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nWhen you establish a dependency, the Start and Finish dates of the successor automatically shift in relation to the Start and Finish dates of the predecessor. For example, if you’re establishing a Start to Finish dependency, the successor task begins directly after the predecessor task ends.\n\nWhen you edit dates, changes automatically roll down to all dependent tasks on the Schedule.\n\nNote: Adjusting Start and/or Finish dates does not delete the dependency or change its type.\n\nKnown Issue\n\nWhen a parent task has subtasks with dependencies, shifting the parent’s predecessor will cause the subtasks to be realigned to all start on the same day. The dependency of the subtasks will not be respected.\n\nTo avoid this issue, connect the predecessor task to the first subtask instead of the parent task. Then when you shift the predecessor, the dependency will be respected, and the parent task will automatically recalculate based on the dates of the subtasks.\n\nSetting Lag and Lead\n\nWhen you establish a dependency, the default delay between predecessor and successor is one day. For instance, with a Finish to Start dependency, the succeeding task will begin on the day after the preceding task ends. You can extend the days between the predecessor and successor tasks by setting a lag. Alternatively, you can create a lead wherein the successor task starts before the predecessor task ends.\n\nHow to Add a Lag or Lead\n\nHover over Projects in the left navigation, and select your project.\n\nIn the project workspace, click the Gantt tab. The Local Gantt chart opens.\n\nIn the Schedule section, double-click the dependency task for which you want to set a lag or lead. The Information modal opens.\n\nSelect either the Predecessors or Successors tab.\n\nIn the Lag column, click the up or down arrow to specify the amount of lag or lead days, or manually type in the amount.\n\nNote: To create a lead, set your Lag to a negative number. To create a lag, set it to a positive number of days.\n\nClick Save."
