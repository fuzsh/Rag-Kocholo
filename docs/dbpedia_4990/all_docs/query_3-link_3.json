        "text": "Samsung just outed its highly-anticipated Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge flagships, and for the first time we are witnessing two of those announced at once, thanks to the curved flexible display of the Edge variant. The handsets are stuffed to the gills with the most pixel-dense displays ever put on a mobile, powerful 64-bit chipsets and great camera modules, all stuffed in premium unibody chassis.\n\nWhen will you be able to put your grubby mitts on those two beauties. Well, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge will be available globally starting from April 10, 2015 with 32/64/128GB storage options. Samsung is still mum on the pricing, but we'd wager to guess something in the realm of $650 without a contract for the S6, and $200 on contract, while the S6 edge will probably run you a Benjamin, or even $150, more.\n\nIn fact, Samsung Netherlands put the handsets up for preorder, and thus confirmed the pricing for the two handsets, at least in Europe. The Galaxy S6 will start you off at €699 for the basic 32 GB version, which is in line with each and every flagship preorder on the Old Continent so far. The 64 GB model would be sold for €799, while the 128 GB variant will be priced at €899. Unsurprisingly, the Galaxy S6 edge will be more expensive: €849 (32 GB), €949 (64 GB), and €1,049 (128 GB)."
