        "text": "Castle Hill has a deep and storied past. The land we call Castle Hill was originally stewarded by indigenous peoples, who called this area Agawam, meaning “place beyond the marsh.” Their sagamore, Masconomet, entered into an alliance with the settlers of Ipswich in 1632 and afterwards this drumlin by the edge of the Atlantic became known as Castle Hill. Over the years, it saw many owners, but the hill never had a castle built upon it. In the 1880s, J.B. Brown transformed Castle Hill Farm from an agricultural holding into a gentleman’s farm, improving roadways and plantings and renovating his modest farmhouse into a rambling, shingle-style cottage that is now The Inn at Castle Hill.\n\nChicago industrialist Richard Teller Crane Jr., heir to Crane Co., and his wife, Florence Higinbotham Crane, purchased the property in 1910. With their vision, working with a team of renowned architects, landscape architects and artists, Castle Hill was transformed into one of America’s great Country Place Era estates. This European-inspired summer estate included a mansion, farm and estate buildings, a pool complex, designed gardens and grounds, and diverse natural areas.\n\nThe first house atop the Castle Hill was an Italian Renaissance Revival villa designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, who also worked with The Olmsted Bros. and Arthur Shurcliff on the designed landscapes. The villa was razed in 1924, replaced with the Stuart-style mansion we see today, inspired by 17th century English country houses. Today known as the Great House (1924-1928), it was designed by Chicago architect David Adler. Castle Hill became the centerpiece of an estate that once encompassed 3,500 acres, emphasizing the natural landscapes, their stewardship and protection.\n\nThe Cranes understood the value of land conservation and historic preservation. In 1910, they amended their wills to reflect that they would one day bequeath this property to The Trustees. Castle Hill came to us in 1949 upon the death of Mrs. Florence Higinbotham Crane. Today, The Trustees stewards 2,100 acres of the family’s original 3,500-acre estate, which includes Castle Hill, Crane Beach, and the Crane Wildlife Refuge. Castle Hill is comprised of 165 acres and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998.\n\nWelcome to Castle Hill!\n\nAdvance passes for grounds admission to Castle Hill are suggested but not required.
