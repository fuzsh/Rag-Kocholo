        "text": "Samsung's Galaxy A-series are due for an update, the earlier ones now approaching the ripe old age of 12 months. There have been indications that the next-gen mid-range models with a premium build are in the works, and things have gotten to a point where we're now being treated to a few live photos of the successors to the Galaxy A5 and A7.\n\nThe two smartphones have been brought up to check on current upmarket Samsung design, featuring a flat glass rear panel, a lot like the Galaxy S6 generation. Unlike the truly premium handsets, however, the future Galaxy A5 (2016) and A7 (2016) will have nothing but a single-LED flash next to the prominent camera hump. Obviously a heart-rate sensor is out of the question in this segment, but the news is that Samsung has relocated the loudspeaker, likely to the bottom of the devices.\n\nAlleged live photos of the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) and A7 (2016)\n\nThe front sees fewer changes, especially on the smaller A5 model. Apart from the rearrangement of the sensors around the earpiece, the most notable difference is the taller home button, hinting at a fingerprint sensor, which has already made its way to the A-series with the A8 and yet-to-be-released A9. The images appear to show a 2.5D front glass on the face of the Galaxy A7 (2016), but not on the A5 (2016), an odd discrepancy with an older leak.\n\nIf the naming is any indication, we'd expect the two models to be released no earlier than January next year - bang on time for the A7 to meet its one-year update deadline, and a couple of months late as far as the A5 is concerned."
