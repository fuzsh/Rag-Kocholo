        "text": "In our Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ vs Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge comparison, we'll compare the early technical specs to see whether the S6 Edge Plus lives up to its billing with regard to its hardware, software and performance.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: Design\n\nThe elegant curves of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge pleasantly surprised even the pickiest of tech enthusiasts. The S6 Edge was also the first smartphone to sport a rear shell glass, a feature that divided users.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ appears to have almost exactly the same design features as the S6 Edge, including all its strengths and weaknesses. Hmm, sounds like a pretty familiar story, Samsung.\n\nThe only obvious difference is the size of the S6 Edge+. It has a 5.7-inch display and a slightly larger body than its predecessor. It seems you'll have a choice of four colors – gold, silver, white or black.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: Display\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge features a 5.1-inch QHD resolution display (1,440 x 2,560 pixels) which, thanks to the curved edges, seems to extend to the rear bodywork and offers a great visual experience. Images always appear bright, sharp and saturated.\n\nThe display of the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus also offers high definition QHD but extends to a diagonal of 5.7 inches, with a pixel density of 1,440 x 2,560. When it comes to the reproduction of colors and the balance of contrast, the difference between the two screens will be minimal. It looks as though it’ll be possible to customize the color reproduction anyway, thanks to a range of dedicated display settings.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: Software\n\nThe S6 Edge was launched with version 5.0.2 of Android Lollipop already installed, including all the new features and, regrettably, all those little bugs too. Thankfully these small defects have been corrected through several updates.\n\nAs for the interface, Samsung made a few upgrades to TouchWiz in time for the launch of the S6 Edge+, which make the user experience feel more fluid, functional and uniform.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: Performance\n\nThe S6 Edge hasn’t fared too badly with its Exynos 7420 processor, which is supported by 3 GB of RAM and a Tegra X1 graphics chip.\n\nThe Plus version has the same processor, but packs 4 GB of RAM, which enables it to run big applications simultaneously without faltering. This is one powerful device.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: Camera\n\nThe front and rear cameras will also be the same in both models. With 16 MP available, the rear camera will be able to take impeccable shots, while the 5 MP at the front should be more than sufficient for a decent selfie.\n\nThe deeper we delve, the more it starts to look as though Samsung has released a smartphone almost identical to the S6 Edge, except for those extra 0.6 inches in diagonal display. But let's see if there are any surprises in store when it comes to the battery…\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: Battery\n\nThe S6 Edge had a few problems with its battery life. Along with the shocking news that users wouldn’t be able to replace malfunctioning batteries, we were all amazed to find out the battery only had 2600 mAh, so the likelihood of getting through a busy day without recharging was pretty slim. Thankfully it was at least equipped with turbo-charging technology.\n\nThe same battery just wouldn't be able to support the new model's larger display, so the S6 Edge+ battery is 3000 mAh. It will support wired charging and is compatible with WPC and PMA wireless charging technologies. Will it be enough to for one charge to get us through a full day? We’ll be running plenty of tests to find out.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: Specifications\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge OS Android 5.1 Lollipop Android 5.1.1 Lollipop Display\n\n5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED 2,560 x 1,440 (518ppi)\n\n5.1-inch Super AMOLED , 2,560 x 1,440 pixels (576ppi) Processor, Samsung Exynos 7420 octa-core at 2.1GHz Samsung Exynos 7420 octa-core at 2,1GHz RAM 4 GB 3 GB Internal Memory 32/64GB 32/64/128GB Camera 16MP (back), 5MP (front) 16MP (back), 5MP (front) Battery 3000 mAh 2600 mAh Dimensions 154.4 x 75.8 x 6.9mm, 153g 142,1 x 70,1 x 7 mm, 138g Additional info Fingerprint reader , heart rate monitor, Qi wireless charging Fingerprint reader , heart rate monitor, Qi wireless charging\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: release and price\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge was released on April 10 and cost around US$800, or £750. Samsung was forced several times to reduce prices and the smartphone often actually sold for less than this.\n\nAccording to some retailers, the Galaxy S6 Edge+ price will be around US$800 for the 32 GB version and US$890 for the 64 GB version, off-contract. For a two-year contract it'll cost US$349.99 for 32 GB and US$449.99 for 64 GB handset.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge vs S6 Edge Plus: Conclusion\n\nIn short, this new smartphone is very similar to its predecessor. But it will feature a more powerful battery to support its larger display (and a higher price to match).\n\nJudging from the information we've got so far, the likelihood of anyone getting excited about this new phone seems very slim. Disappointment and indifference seem the more likely emotions at this point.\n\nHave you heard any more about the new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus? Tell us in the comments below."
