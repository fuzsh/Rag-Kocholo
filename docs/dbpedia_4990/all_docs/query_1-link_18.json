        "text": "Apart from the Galaxy S6 that Samsung has in the works (besides a possible Galaxy S6 Edge), the company appears to be working on a couple new tablet devices for a launch later this month. The devices, that fall under the company’s newest codename — Project Goya — are expected to be affordable successors to the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite, with a launch date that is believed to fall somewhere in the end of this month.\n\nThe specific model names of these two devices, as reveal by an import listing on Zauba, are SM-T113 and SM-T116. A quick look at the listed specifications, and you’re reminded that these are going to be a couple of pretty affordable devices. Samsung has massive R&D resources in India, which is where a lot of its up and coming devices end up for testing, which was the case with these tablets in question as well. Speaking of specifications, according to previous leaks, the SM-T116 which is a part of the budget duo comes with a 7-inch display, a 1.2GHz quad-core processor (the Spreadtrum SC8830) along with 1GB of RAM and runs Android v4.4 KitKat. Looking at the way such devices are being priced in the present, I wouldn’t be surprised if the SM-T116 (launch name yet to be announced) turns out to be really inexpensive. According to reports, the tablets — SM-T113 and SM-T116 — will be launched in Europe around the third week of January, which is quite typical of Samsung.\n\nSamsung will have its work cut out, because tablet sales are on the decline and makers such as Lenovo and Xiaomi are eating away Samsung’s share in a lot of markets. There could be a lot of ways to go about it, but a budget tablet offering seems like the safest bet at the moment. With its Tizen OS development in full flow, Samsung will also be hoping to see a good response to its tablets, perhaps so that it could experiment a bit with the Tizen OS on the large screen… besides the new smart TV that it just announced earlier today."
