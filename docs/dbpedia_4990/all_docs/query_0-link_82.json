        "text": "Group B\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigationJump to search\n\nThis article is about motor racing regulations. For other uses, see Group B (disambiguation).\n\nAn Audi Quattro S1, one of the most powerful Group B cars.\n\nGroup B was a set of regulations introduced in 1982 for competition vehicles in sportscar racing and rallying regulated by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The Group B regulations fostered some of the fastest, most powerful, and most sophisticated rally cars ever built and is commonly referred to as the golden era of rallying.[1] However, a series of major accidents, some of them fatal, were blamed on their outright speed and lack of crowd control at events. After the death of Henri Toivonen and his co-driver Sergio Cresto in the 1986 Tour de Corse, the FIA disestablished the class, dropped its previous plans to replace it by Group S, and instead replaced it as the top-line formula by Group A. The short-lived Group B era has acquired legendary status among rally fans and automobile enthusiasts in general.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n\n2 Group 2 and Group 4\n\n3 Groups N, A and B\n\n4 1983–1985\n\n5 1986\n\n6 Disposition\n\n7 Group S\n\n8 Legacy\n\n9 Cars\n\n9.1 Group B\n\n9.2 Notes\n\n9.3 Group S\n\n10 Notable drivers\n\n11 References\n\n12 External links\n\nOverview\n\nGroup B Ford RS200\n\nGroup B was introduced by the FIA in 1982 as a replacement for both Group 4 (modified grand touring) and Group 5 (touring prototypes) cars.\n\nGroup A referred to production-derived vehicles limited in terms of power, weight, allowed technology and overall cost. The base model had to be mass-produced (5000 units/year) and had to have four seats. Group A was aimed at ensuring a large number of privately owned entries in races.\n\nBy contrast, Group B had few restrictions on technology, design and the number of cars required for homologation to compete—200, less than other series. Weight was kept as low as possible, high-tech materials were permitted, and there were no restrictions on boost, resulting in the power output of the winning cars increasing from 250 hp in 1981,[2] the year before Group B rules were introduced, to there being at least two cars producing in excess of 500 by 1986, the final year of Group B.[3] In just five years, the power output of rally cars had more than doubled.\n\nThe category was aimed at car manufacturers by promising outright competition victories and the subsequent publicity opportunities without the need for an existing production model. There was also a Group C, which had a similarly lax approach to chassis and engine development, but with strict rules on overall weight and maximum fuel load.\n\nGroup B was initially a very successful group, with many manufacturers joining the premier World Rally Championship, and increased spectator numbers. But the cost of competing quickly rose and the performance of the cars proved too much resulting in a series of fatal crashes. As a consequence Group B was canceled at the end of 1986 and Group A regulations became the standard for all cars until the advent of World Rally Cars in 1997.\n\nIn the following years Group B found a niche in the European Rallycross Championship, with cars such as the MG Metro 6R4 and the Ford RS200 competing as late as 1992. For 1993, the FIA replaced the Group B models with prototypes that had to be based on existing Group A cars, but still followed the spirit of Group B, with low weight, 4WD, high turbo boost pressure and staggering amounts of power.\n\nGroup 2 and Group 4\n\nUntil 1983 the two main classes of rallying were called Group 2 and Group 4. Major manufacturers competed in Group 4, which required a minimum of 400 examples of a competition car. Notable cars of the era included the Lancia Stratos HF, the Ford Escort RS1800 and the Fiat 131 Abarth.\n\nIn 1979 the FISA (then the name of the FIA's motorsport regulatory division) legalized four-wheel drive (4WD). Car companies were not keen on using 4WD as it was generally felt that the extra weight and complexity of 4WD systems would cancel out any performance benefits.\n\nThis belief was shattered when Audi launched a competition car in 1980, the Turbocharged and 4WD Quattro. That year a Quattro was used in Portugal's Algarve Rallye. Registered by the Audi Sport Factory Rally Team, IN-NE 3, as an opening (zero) car, it was driven by professional driver Hannu Mikkola. Mikkola's co-driver was Arne Hertz. IN-NE 3's combined time for all stages on this rally was over 30 minutes quicker[4] than that of the winner. While the new car was indeed heavy and cumbersome, its standing starts on gravel and road grip on Special Stages was staggering.\n\nThe Quattro was officially entered in the 1980 Jänner-Rallye in Austria and easily won. Audi kept on winning throughout the 1980 and 1981 seasons, although lack of consistent results meant that Ford took the driver's title in 1981 with Ari Vatanen driving a rear-wheel-drive Escort. The team's victory at the 1981 Rallye Sanremo, with the car piloted by Michèle Mouton, was the first time a woman won a World Championship rally. Mouton placed second in the drivers' championship the next year, behind Opel's Walter Röhrl.\n\nGroups N, A and B\n\nRothmans Rally Team's Prodrive-run Porsche 911 SC RS.\n\nThe FISA decided to separate the rally cars into three classes: Group N (production cars), Group A (modified production cars), and Group B (modified sports cars). These groups were introduced in 1982.\n\nGroup N and Group A cars were the same cars with different amounts of race preparation allowed (in Group N almost no modifications, in Group A significant modifications). The cars had to have four seats (although the minimum size of the rear seats was small enough that some 2+2 cars could qualify) and be produced in large numbers. This was 5000 cars/year between 1982 and 1991. It later changed to 2500 cars/year if the version being homologated was derived from a mass-market car (25000 cars/year for all versions).\n\nThe transverse mid-engine Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 E2 won Peugeot the 1985 and 1986 WRC manufacturers' titles.\n\nGroup B was conceived when the FISA found that numerous car manufacturers wanted to compete in rallying; witnessing the successes of the Stratos and the Quattro, manufacturers felt cars with mid-engine and RWD or 4WD were preferable, however their RWD production models had been gradually replaced by their FWD counterparts, lessening their chance of winning. By reducing the homologation minimum from 400 (in Group 4) to 200, FIA enabled manufacturers to design specialised RWD or 4WD rally cars without the financial commitment of producing their production counterparts in such large numbers.[5]\n\nGroup B cars could be two-seaters and the minimum production was 200 cars. Manufacturers were allowed to homologate an evolution each year by producing 20 cars of that evolution. The cars entered in the races were further modified (same modifications allowed as in Group A). Group B could in theory be used to homologate production sports cars, which could not be homologated in Group N or A, because they did not have four seats or were not produced in large enough numbers (e.g. cars like the Ferrari 308, the Porsche 911, etc.). The designation used in the regulations (\"Sports Grand Touring Cars\") shows this intention.\n\nThe major manufacturers, however, used them in a different way: they designed a rally car, of which 20 were produced and designated the evolution model, and then built a limited series of 200 street cars for homologation. (Similar things have been done before in Group 4, for instance the Lancia Stratos.) In some cases these cars were sold at a loss and journalists[who?] reviewing them now acknowledge that their development was not quite finished.\n\nIn each group there were classes based on engine displacement (with a 1.4 equivalence factor for forced induction engines). Each class had different weight limits, maximum tyre sizes, etc. The most important classes for Group B were the 3000 cc class (2142.8 cc with turbo or supercharger), 960 kg minimum weight (Audi Quattro, Lancia 037) and 2500 cc (1785 cc), 890 kg (Peugeot 205 T16, Lancia Delta S4).\n\nRenault 5 Turbo.\n\nPorsche 959.\n\nThe original Renault 5 Turbo had a 1.4 L engine so it was in the 2000 cc class. Renault later increased the size of the engine somewhat for the Turbo Maxi, so as to be able to fit larger tyres (at the expense of somewhat higher weight).[6] The Ferrari 288 GTO and the Porsche 959 were in the 4000 cc (2857 cc), 1100 kg class, which would have probably become the normal class for track racing if Group B had seen much use there. Otherwise they existed for old Group 4 cars which competed until 1985.\n\nClasses in Group B:[7]\n\nDisplacement Weight Wheel width\n\n(front & back) Cars\n\nNaturally-aspirated Super-, turbo-charged\n\n4000 cc 2857 cc 1100 kg 24\" Ferrari 288 GTO, Porsche 959\n\n3000 cc 2142.8 cc 960 kg 22\" Audi Quattro, Lancia 037, MG Metro 6R4, Ford RS200\n\n2500 cc 1785 cc 890 kg 22\" Peugeot 205 T16, Lancia Delta S4\n\n2000 cc 1397 cc 820 kg 20\" Renault 5 Turbo\n\nAudi was in the 3000 cc class because the displacement of the street car happened to be in that class, and as a car derived from the street version, it would have been difficult to reach the minimum weight needed. For the 037 Lancia decided that the lower class might be too light and consequently too fragile for gravel rallies, and they happened to have a good 2000 cc engine.\n\nWhen these rules were decided it was felt that these displacement restrictions would be enough to control power, but in the early and mid-1980s engineers learnt how to extract extraordinary amounts of power from turbo engines (the same thing was happening in F1). Nowadays the power of turbo engines is limited by mandating a restrictor in the intake (in World Rally Car, Group A and Group N).\n\n1983–1985\n\nLancia's 037.\n\nAlthough the Audi Quattro was still in essence a Group 4 car, it carried Hannu Mikkola to the driver's title in 1983. Lancia had designed a new car to Group B specifications, but the Lancia 037 still had rear wheel drive and was thus less consistent than the Audi over different surfaces (generally the Lancia had the upper hand on tarmac, with the Audi remaining superior on looser surfaces such as snow and gravel). Nevertheless, the 037 performed well enough for Lancia to capture the manufacturers title, which was generally considered more prestigious at the time, with a rally to spare. In fact, so low was Lancia's regard for the Drivers Championship, they did not enter a single car into the season finale RAC Rally, despite the fact that driver Walter Röhrl was still in the hunt for the title.\n\nOpel Manta 400.\n\nThe low homologation requirements quickly attracted manufacturers to Group B. Opel replaced their production-derived Ascona with the Group B Manta 400, and Toyota built a new car based on their Celica. Like the Lancia 037 both cars were rear wheel drive, but, while successful in national rallying in various countries, they were less so at World Championship level, although Toyota won the 1983 Ivory Coast Rally after hiring Swedish desert driving specialist, the late Björn Waldegård.\n\nIn 1984, Audi's Stig Blomqvist beat Lancia to the driver's title, although the victory was bittersweet: Midway through the year Peugeot had joined the rallying scene with its Group B 205 T16. The T16 also had four wheel drive and was smaller and lighter than the Audi Quattro. At the wheel was the 1981 driver's champion Ari Vatanen, with future Ferrari Formula One team manager and FIA President Jean Todt overseeing the operation. A crash prevented the T16 from winning its first rally but the writing was on the wall for Audi.\n\nThe Metro 6R4 was developed to compete in the 1986 WRC.\n\nDespite massive revisions to the Quattro, including a shorter wheelbase, Peugeot dominated the 1985 season. Although not without mishap: Vatanen plunged off the road in Argentina and was seriously injured when his seat mountings broke in the ensuing crash. Timo Salonen won the 1985 champion title with five wins.\n\nAlthough the crash was a sign that Group B cars had already become dangerously quick (despite Vatanen having a consistent record of crashing out while leading), several new Group B cars entered the rallying world in 1985:\n\nLate in the year, Lancia replaced their outclassed 037 with the Delta S4, which featured both a turbocharger and a supercharger for optimum power output.\n\nFord returned after several years away with the Ford RS200 and the Ford Sierra RS Cosworth (though the latter went on to compete in Group A).\n\nCitroën developed and entered the BX 4TC, which ultimately was too heavy and cumbersome to be successful.\n\nRover created the distinctive Metro 6R4, which featured boxy bodywork and a large spoiler mounted on the front of the car.\n\n1986\n\nFord RS200.\n\nFor the 1986 season, defending champion Timo Salonen had the new Evolution 2 version of Peugeot's 205 T16 with ex Toyota driver, Juha Kankkunen. Audi's new Sport Quattro S1 boasted over 600 hp (450 kW) and a huge snowplough-like front end. Lancia's Delta S4 would be in the hands of the Finnish prodigy Henri Toivonen and Markku Alén, and Ford was ready with its high tech RS200 with Stig Blomqvist and Kalle Grundel.\n\nOn the \"Lagoa Azul\" stage of the Portuguese Rally near Sintra, Portuguese driver Joaquim Santos crested a rise, turning to his right to avoid a small group of spectators. This caused him to lose control of his RS200. The car veered to the right and slid off the road into the spectators. Thirty-one people were injured and three were killed. All the top teams immediately pulled out of the rally and Group B was placed in jeopardy.\n\nLancia Delta S4.\n\nDisaster struck again in early May at the Tour de Corse. Lancia's Toivonen was the championship favorite, and once the rally got underway he was the pace setter. Seven kilometres into the 18th stage, Toivonen's S4 flew off the unguarded edge of a tightening left hand bend and plunged down a steep wooded hillside. The car landed inverted with the fuel tanks ruptured by the impact. The combination of red hot turbocharger, Kevlar bodywork, and ruptured fuel tank ignited the car and set fire to the dry undergrowth. Toivonen and co-driver Sergio Cresto died in their seats.[8][9][10] With no witnesses to the accident it was impossible to determine what caused the crash other than Toivonen had left the road at high speed. Some cite Toivonen's ill health at the time (he reportedly was suffering from flu);[11] others suggest mechanical failure, or simply the difficulty of driving the car, although Toivonen had a career full of crashing out while leading rallies. Up until that stage he was leading the rally by a large margin, with no other driver challenging him.[11]\n\nThe crash came a year after Lancia driver Attilio Bettega had crashed and died in his 037. While that fatality was largely blamed on the unforgiving Corsican scenery (and bad luck, as his co-driver, Maurizio Perissinot was uninjured), Toivonen and Cresto's deaths, combined with the Portugal tragedy and televised accident of F1 driver Marc Surer in another RS200 which killed co-driver Michel Wyder, compelled the FIA ban Group B cars immediately for 1987. Audi decided to quit Group B entirely after the Corsica rally.\n\nThe final days of Group B would also be controversial. The Peugeots were disqualified from the Rally Sanremo by the Italian scrutineers as the 'skirts' around the bottom of the car were deemed to be illegal. Peugeot immediately accused the Italians of favouring Lancia.[citation needed] Their case was strengthened at the next event, the RAC Rally, when the British scrutineers passed the Peugeots as legal in identical trim. FISA annulled the result of the Sanremo Rally eleven days after the final round in the United States. As a result, the championship title was passed from Lancia's Markku Alén to Peugeot's Juha Kankkunen. Timo Salonen had won another two rallies during the 1986 season and became the most successful group B era driver with a total of seven wins.\n\nDisposition\n\nAri Vatanen's Dakar Rally trim 205 T16.\n\nThree Ford RS200 E2, Audi Sport quattro S1, MG Metro 6R4 and Peugeot 205 T16 E2 in the 1989 Rallycross EC round at Melk.\n\nAlthough 1987 saw the end of the Group B cars on the world stage, they did not disappear from motorsport. Peugeot adapted their T16 to run in the Dakar Rally. Ari Vatanen won the event in 1987, 1989 and 1990. Improved Peugeot and Audi cars also competed in the Pikes Peak Hillclimb in Colorado. Walter Röhrl's S1 Rally car won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in 1987 and set a new record at the time. Audi used their Group B experience to develop a production based racing car for the Trans-Am and IMSA GTO series in 1988 and 1989 respectively. Ford sold off their RS200s to private buyers, with many being used in European Rallycross events from the beginning of 1987 till the end of 1992. The Metro 6R4 also became a frequent sight in Rallycross and the car was also entered in British and Irish national championship events. Porsche's 959 never entered a World Rally event, although it did compete in the Middle East championship and won the Paris-Dakar Rally. The 961 prototype won the GTX class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans 1986 race but crashed and caught fire in 1987. The Ferrari 288 GTO was built and sold the minimum requirement of cars to the public, however it never saw action in its category. The WSPC grids it was intended for was filled up by a batch of Group C cars (there would be no production sports car-based racers in European racing, including Le Mans, until 1993), but it saw limited use in an IMSA GTO race in 1989.\n\nGroup S\n\nThe Lancia ECV for Group S pictured at Legendy 2014.\n\nAs well as the cancellation of Group B, the tragedies of 1986 also brought about the scrapping of Group B's proposed replacement: Group S.\n\nGroup S rules would have limited car engine power to 300 hp (225 kW). To encourage innovative designs, ten examples of a car would have been required for homologation, rather than the 200 required for Group B. By the time of its cancellation, at least four Group S prototypes had been built: The Lancia ECV, the Toyota MR2-based 222D, the Opel Kadett Rallye 4x4 (a.k.a. Vauxhall Astra 4S) and the Lada Samara S-proto, and new cars were also planned by both Audi (the 002 Quattro) and Ford (a Group S development of the RS200). The cancellation of Group S angered many rally insiders who considered the new specification to be safer than Group B and more exciting than Group A.\n\nThe Group S concept was revived by the FIA in 1997 as the World Rally Car specification which, as of 2021, is still in use. WRC cars are limited to 380 hp (280 kW) and require 20 examples of a model but, unlike Group S, are required to share certain parts with production cars.\n\nLegacy\n\n1985 Audi Sport Quattro S1\n\nMENU0:00\n\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\nThe era of Group B is often considered one of the most competitive and compelling periods in rallying.[12] The combination of lightweight chassis, sophisticated aerodynamics and massive amounts of horsepower resulted in the development of a class of cars whose performance has not yet been surpassed within their category, even three decades later.[13] In reference to their dubious safety record, however, the class has also earned an unsavory nickname among enthusiasts: \"Killer B's\".[13] In contrast to this, many enthusiasts refer the Group B era as the Golden Age of Rallying.[14][15][16][17]\n\nThe 2017 video game Gran Turismo Sport features a rally car category known as \"Gr.

Here, the player drives a BMW M4 to a destination.\n\nSee also: Gameplay in Forza Horizon and Gameplay in Forza Horizon 2\n\nForza Horizon 3 is a racing video game set in an open world environment based in a fictional representation of Australia.[2] The gameplay world is about twice the size of its predecessor, Forza Horizon 2,[3] and the game contains locales and regions based upon their real-life Australian counterparts.[4][5] While previous Horizon games have depicted the player as being one of the racers of the Horizon Festival, the player is now the director of the festival, and their role is to expand it throughout Australia by completing races, challenges, and stunts to earn fans.[3][6] By expanding the festival, the player can unlock new areas, challenges, events, and racing courses.[7]\n\nThree types of racing modes are available in the game: Exhibition, Championship, and Rivals. Exhibition is a single race at one location, whereas Championship contains multiple races dispersed throughout the gameplay world. Rivals is a versus race against the player and an AI opponent, where the player has to compete in a time trial to beat the time set by the opponent.[8] Added in Forza Horizon 2, players can also participate in Bucket List Challenges. During Bucket List Challenges, the player is given a task to complete with a specific vehicle such as reaching a certain speed limit, for example.[9] The newly introduced Horizon Blueprint feature allows players to customise races and Bucket List Challenges.[3]\n\nApart from races and Bucket List Challenges, the player can engage in numerous other activities. Breakable boards called \"bonus boards\" can be discovered around the gameplay world; when driven over, they award the player with experience points or a discount on fast travelling.[9][10] As players progress through the game, they will receive notifications informing them of barn find rumours; when found, the in-game mechanic will restore the barn find for the player to use.[11] When performing driving stunts with a vehicle, the player is awarded \"skill points\"; if enough skill points are acquired, they can be used to purchase certain perks.[12]\n\nReturning from previous Forza games, Horizon 3 features an implemented driving AI called Drivatars, which learns and mimics the driving abilities of Forza players.[13] Drivatars are found throughout the gameplay world,[14] and they appear in races as opponents, where they can be adjusted by game difficulty via the player.[9] Apart from standard races, Drivatars can be challenged to a head-to-head race. If the player wins the race, they will be able to recruit that Drivatar onto their racing team,[14] which allows the player to earn additional experience points, fans, and in-game currency.[6] The player can also recruit Drivatars in a car convoy. When in a car convoy, Drivatars will follow the player, and they can be upgraded by skill points to perform certain tasks throughout the game.[15]\n\nThe player can upgrade and tune individual parts of their vehicles, with body kits for vehicles being available to the player as well.[16][17] Additionally, Horizon 3 includes a vehicle cutsomisation option called \"Upgrade Heroes,\" which utilizes both tuning and body kits to alter both a vehicle's performance and appearance, though the cutomisation preset is limited to a certain number of vehicles.[18] The colour of vehicles and its collective parts can changed, with the player further being able to design liveries for vehicles.[16] These liveries can be sold through the game's transactional system, which also includes an auction system to bid on cars from other players.[3][19] A total of 350 vehicles were available at the game's launch.[3]\n\nHorizon 3 offers a co-operative campaign for up the four players and supports cross-platform compatibility.[15][20] The game also includes a multiplayer open world mode supporting up to 12 players.[16] In multiplayer, players can compete in standard races, though they also have the option to play various kinds of minigames with their vehicles.[6][15] As from previous Forza games, players can join clubs, where they have the ability to compete against players of other clubs in races and minigames.[15]\n\nDevelopment\n\nForza Horizon 3 was developed by UK-based Playground Games, the developers behind previous Horizon titles. Additional work was provided by Turn 10 Studios.[1] The game was designed using the ForzaTech game engine, which is used to develop most other Forza games.[21] The development team started conceptualizing about the creation of Horizon 3 in 2014 initially after Forza Horizon 2 was released.[22] The team desired to give players more freedom in Horizon 3, which wasn't as prominent in the previous game of the series.[23] The team also aimed for Horizon 3 to be of better quality, therefore they sought to improve and reiterate many aspects of the game over the previous title.[22] This caused Playground Games to minimize the amount of loading screen time in Horizon 3, as it could damage the game's impression of being persistently high quality.[24] Creative director Ralph Fulton felt that Horizon 3 was a \"generational leap\" over the Horizon 2 because of the work the development team put in to better improve the game.[22]\n\nSetting\n\nClockwise from top left: Surfers Paradise, the Outback, The 12 Apostles, Yarra Valley. Australia's diverse scenery was one of the main reasons Playground Games selected the country as the setting of Forza Horizon 3.\n\nPlayground Games initially started with a broad range of locations for Horizon 3, with the list of locations narrowing with more research.[22] Because of Australia's largely diverse environment, the development team ultimately made the decision to have Horizon 3 set there, as they also considered the country to be a possible setting for future Horizon games.[22][25] Mike Brown, a game designer at Playground Games, thinks that the team made the correct decision to select Australia as the setting, describing the potential of the setting as \"perfect\".[25]\n\nTo help create a convincing gameplay world, a team was sent to Australia to take thousands of photos for reference to help import into the game, with these photos consisting of plants, rocks, and road details, among many others.[26][25] Playground Games stated that they explored and represented every ecologically distinct part of the country in Horizon 3,[27] with the gameplay world consisting of six distinct regions, alongside more effort being put into simulating iconic areas of the country, such as The Twelve Apostles.[25] Fairly obscure details were also implemented into the game, such as the colours of Australian phone boxes and garbage bins, as well as native wildlife also being included.[28][25] The gameplay world, however, is somewhat geographically inaccurate, with locations in real life existing in different geographic areas in the game.[29] According to Brown, the explanation for this inconsistency was to create a better gameplay experience for the player.[25]\n\nRalph Fulton, speaking in an interview with MCV/Develop, explained that Playground Games desired to help celebrate Australian car culture and familiarize the culture to people in other parts of the world, thus multiple Australian car models were incorporated into the game, with Fulton adding, \"[Australia's] culture of Ford vs Holden, and V8s and Utes isn’t immediately familiar to everybody north of the equator, but we did feel it was really interesting and colourful and would add to the game.\"[22]\n\nGeneral design and technology\n\nAfter the success of the recreation of Cote d’Azur and Northern Italy in Horizon 2, the development team talked about and tested new technology prototypes for several months to help enhance the visual scenery for the project. Among these prototypes was an HDR sky system.[22] As an idea, the team thought of pointing a high resolution camera at the sky for hours as a time-lapse. A test was then conducted in Leamington Spa, England. Lighting artist Jamie Wood admitted that during the test, there was more variety in shooting a camera at a sky than the sky design system that was used in Horizon 2. With Playground Games taking these aspects in consideration, three teams of two were sent to Braidwood, New South Wales to capture Australia's more specific skies, clouds, and sun rays. From October 2015 to the summer in the southern hemisphere, the teams performed the shooting process using HDR cameras. The cameras took thousands of photos with frame interpolation over 24 hour periods, alongside the lenses and light sensors needing to be cleaned regularly. Videos of the sky were also taken, with the footage being about 30 days long overall.[30] The shooting process took place through various weather conditions and times of day to resemble a \"dynamic weather system\" in the game. This further meant that camera exposures and filters had to be changed frequently to adjust to each time of day. The footage of the sky was then imported into the game.[26] Because of the sky footage, days were longer in Horizon 3 than its predecessor, and clouds also correlate with weather systems in-game.[30]\n\nThe lighting effects (including light direction and length) in Horizon 3 are calculated with real-time computing, which helps simulate a realistic sun in the game. This aids in generating shadows situated on how light is distributed and occluded based on surrounding objects and substances. The game also uses a voxel-based global illumination system to calculate the bouncing of light, which is also used with real-time computing. The sky, other sources of light, and occlusion data is used to assist in which surfaces light bounces onto. This helps light accurately blend into darker areas of the game.[30]\n\nHigh-dynamic-range rendering (HDR), played a key role in the visuals of Horizon 3. Originally, there wasn't any thought of incorporating HDR while developing the game, but due to the development team discovering the HDR output of the Xbox One S, it was decided to start programming the feature. \"ForzaTech\", the video game engine used for Forza games,[31] was found to be a perfect match for HDR, as the light rendering of the game engine was perfectly set up the incorporate the brightness gamut of HDR. To help investigate the feature, multiple televisions that supported HDR were bought. The development team later discovered that the televisions displayed HDR variously, which added much more intricacy to the process of developing the feature.[22]\n\nCar models were mainly developed with the help of CAD data exchange with the car manufacturer, but for cars that didn't support CAD data exchange, designers had to use more expertise in order to simulate them more accurately. Another issue was trying to track down cars for modelling details, especially rarer and older cars, with it sometimes taking upwards of weeks to locate some of them.[22][30] As with the Lamborghini Centenario, the cover car of the game,[32] a photographer was sent to Italy to take thousands of photos and measurements of the car. Using help from the images and measurements, a mesh of the car was modelled with Autodesk 3ds Max. As the car also consisted of 620 different types of materials, Playground Games desired to simulate all the materials to the \"sub-pixel level\", with designers of the game's Centenario having to figure out which materials had to be placed in areas of the car.[30]\n\nThe beach and sea was found to be an important racing area for the development team, therefore much effort was put into allowing the sea to realistically interact with the beach. To help assist in developing the sea, Playground Games contacted game developer Rare, who was working on Sea of Thieves at the time. As both developers were working on creating the sea in their games, they decided to share computer code, of which both developers improved and reiterated on.[30]\n\nGameplay design\n\nWhile in a conference hosted by GamesIndustry.biz, Ralph Fulton explained in a presentation that \"humans form their first impressions incredibly quickly\", elaborating that people form their opinions on someone within the first three seconds. He acknowledged that first impressions can change the way someone recognizes a game, with Playground Games conducting a study of first impressions before developing Horizon 3. Two groups of test subjects both played the same Forza game for the same amount of time, but one group played in a sports car and the other played in a regular car. When asked about their experiences playing the game, the group that played in the sports car rated the game higher in multiple categories. As a result of such observations, Playground Games spent a large part of their development cycle (about eighteen months) developing and curating the first few scenes of the game. In February 2015, it was decided that the first few scenes would be split between the opening drive and the first of the game's events, with the decided route for the opening drive being finalized a month later. By June 2015, the decided route was being tested and concept art was drawn for the scenery that the player would see during the opening drive, although some concepts had to be adjusted or removed such as the rainforest in the game being made less dense. Problems also emerged with the car that the player would be driving in during the opening sequence, the Lamborghini Centenario. The Centenario resulted in being too fast for the player to observe the scenery as intended, requiring changes in the route and terrain. As the opening drive also went off-road, a cutscene had to be instituted to switch the Centenario with a buggy to accompany the rougher land. Additionally, the first event after the opening drive had to be pushed back for further improvement, prompting modifications to be made to the opponent vehicle.[24]\n\nDuring the development process of the four-player cooperative campaign, the goal of the project was to enable all players to play with \"as little friction as possible\". This made the development team generate a list of goals for an organized campaign. The team then developed a list of issues that influenced the campaign when assessing their project design. The major issues mainly were:\n\nPlayers could be hours apart in campaign progress\n\nAs races could have specific requirements for cars based on the restrictions the session leader has set, players with fewer cars may not reach those car specifications\n\nPlayers with lower skill levels may finish races in lower positions\n\nAlthough players are able to play without any sort of communication between each other, the one player leading the game session has to also guide players throughout the game\n\nWith each issue, the team brainstormed a list of possible solutions, picking the solution that produced the least conflict between players. For the first issue, a screen appears that informs the player of how many fans they earned and festivals they can upgrade or open whenever they leave a cooperative session. If players also completed races in a cooperative session that have not yet been unlocked in their single-player session, the race will appear as \"completed\" on the UI in single-player. The second issue was considered more straightforward, which introduced a rental feature that allowed players to borrow the session leader's car during a race. For the third issue, every race was converted into a team race between the players and the AI opponents. A point system was then added for every opponent beaten. This created a structure that allowed inexperienced players contribute to the campaign even if they beat only one opponent. Although the fourth issue wasn't part of the team's original goals, it did come up often during testing phases. To resolve the problem, a feature was implemented that notified the session leader's actions to all other players whenever the leader did something, such as starting an event.[7]\n\nRelease\n\nThe 2016 Porsche 911 GT3 RS was featured in a Porsche downloadable car pack.\n\nForza Horizon 3 was announced on 13 June 2016 during Microsoft's E3 Xbox briefing.[2] The game was released on 27 September 2016.[20] Owners of the Ultimate Edition version of the game received access on 23 September, along with six downloadable content car packs, and access to exclusive cars and events.[33] The game also made use of Groove Music to play custom soundtracks, although the feature became limited to music and playlists uploaded to their OneDrive cloud storage only after 31 December 2017 when Microsoft discontinued the Groove Music Pass. The OneDrive music streaming feature in the game was later disabled on 31 March 2019,[34][35] effectively limiting players to the in-game soundtrack as with the other Forza Horizon games. Vehicles manufactured by Volkswagen were absent from the game due to licensing issues.[36] Forza Horizon 3 and all its downloadable content was removed from the Microsoft Store after reaching its end-of-life status on 27 September 2020.[37]\n\nDownloadable content\n\nSeveral downloadable content car packs were released. While most packs featured a small collection of cars, some packs were themed, such as the Motorsport All-Stars Car Pack. This pack included several race versions of popular sport and super cars, such as the Dodge Viper GTS-R, Nissan GT-R and Chevrolet Corvette C7. One pack was manufacturer specific, the Porsche Car Pack. This pack features the 2016 Porsche 911 GT3 RS and two other 911 variants from various years, a 1955 Porsche 550, a 1960 Porsche 718, a 2016 Porsche Cayman and a 2017 Porsche Panamera. Additionally if all expansions are purchased players can unlock an event to trigger an additional Porsche barn find. Another car pack featured real life modified cars used by the Hoonigan brand, including a third generation Mazda RX-7 drift car, Ken Block’s Ford Mustang ‘Hoonicorn’, and a Chevrolet K5 Blazer owned by BJ Baldwin, among other cars.\n\nOn 13 December 2016, the expansion Blizzard Mountain was released. Players who purchased the Expansion Pass received the Blizzard Mountain DLC, alongside the Hot Wheels expansion. Blizzard Mountain allows players to experience snow conditions both at the foot of and up to the peak of the titular mountain. Weather changes during play, ranging from clear skies to near whiteout conditions. The expansion comes with nine new DLC cars, including a barn find. Players can also buy the pack separately through the Microsoft Store, alongside the Expansion Pass as well.\n\nOn 9 May 2017, Turn 10 and Playground Games released an expansion pack, in collaboration with Mattel's Hot Wheels, named Forza Horizon 3 Hot Wheels,[38] which includes a new area located off the coast of Australia that is constructed with real-world scale Hot Wheels stunt track pieces. Included are ten brand new DLC cars, including a barn find. Several iconic cars from the Hot Wheels franchise are included, including the Twin Mill, while manufacturer speciality cars such as the 2010 Pagani Zonda R, the 2016 Jeep Trailcat, a Chrysler Hemi Hellcat powered Jeep Trailcat (a customised Jeep Wrangler) and the 2007 Toyota Hilux featured on Top Gear's North Pole special.[38] Players who purchase the Expansion Pass can access this expansion pack for no additional cost.\n\nOn 1 August 2017, Forza Horizon 3 players received the fictitious Quartz Regalia from Final Fantasy XV through the in-game message system, while Final Fantasy XV players received an Xbox Live message with a code to redeem the car.[39] It was free DLC for those who've played either game on Xbox One or Forza Horizon 3 on Windows prior to that date.[39] According to Final Fantasy XV director Hajime Tabata, Forza Horizon 2 was used as a reference for the road trip aspects of the Final Fantasy game, which lead to Square Enix's partnering with Turn 10 to bring the fictional car to Horizon 3.[40]\n\nReception\n\nReception\n\nAggregate score\n\nAggregator Score\n\nMetacritic 91/100 (XONE)[41]\n\n86/100 (PC)[42]\n\nReview scores\n\nPublication Score\n\nDestructoid 9/10[10]\n\nGameRevolution 4/5 stars[6]\n\nGameSpot 9/10[5]\n\nGamesRadar+ 4/5 stars[43]\n\nIGN 9.5/10[44]\n\nPC Gamer (US) 92/100[9]\n\nPolygon 8.5/10[1]\n\nForza Horizon 3 received \"universal acclaim\" from critics for the Xbox One version, while the PC version of the game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[41][42] Until the release of Forza Horizon 4, it was the most-acclaimed Forza Horizon title to date and the only Xbox One console exclusive to have a Metascore higher than 90.[45][46] It was the seventh top selling game in Australia in 2016.[47] More than 2.5 million copies of the game were sold.[48]\n\nBrett Makedonski from Destructoid gave the game a 9/10 citing that \"It's a good dynamic, one that has worked expertly for three games.\"[10]\n\nNick Tan from Game Revolution gave the game 4 out of 5 stars saying that \"You'll want to bend and curve around every corner in picturesque Australia landscape at least once, even if that's the only time.\"[6]\n\nMiguel Concepcion from GameSpot also gave the game a 9/10 saying that \"Turn 10 and Playground Games affirm the series' status as the driving game for everyone. The new emphasis on off-road options isn't at the expense of traditional races, thanks to the sheer volume of activities.\"[5]\n\nJustin Towell from GamesRadar also gave the game 4 out of 5 stars citing that it \"You won't need to think much while you play it, but if you're talking about places to just cut loose and enjoy the breathtaking scenery, Australia is a fine place to do it.\"[43]\n\nLuke Reilly for IGN gave the game a 9.5/10 saying it \"never loses sight of the fact that tearing through postcard-perfect locations should be fun, and it puts the tools in our hands to keep it that way, always. This is the racing game I've been waiting for, and it's officially my favourite thing on four wheels. A fair dinkum triumph, mates.\"[44]\n\nColin Campbell from Polygon gave the game an 8.5/10 saying that \"Through a superbly realized version of Australia as well as a wide variety of terrain, cars and challenges, this free-roaming car simulation offers a valuable playbox. But it also managed to muster \"cor blimey\" moments that made me feel a whooping rush of speed and liberation.\"[1]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Award Ceremony Category Result Ref.\n\n2016 Guild of Music Supervisors Awards Best Music Supervision In A Video Game Nominated [49]\n\nThe Game Awards Best Sports/Racing Won [50][51]\n\n2017 British Academy Games Awards British Game Nominated [52]\n\nMultiplayer Nominated [53]\n\nNotes\n\nThe Ultimate Edition for the game was released in 23 September 2016, while the standard and deluxe editions were released in 27 September.\n\nAdditional work was provided by Turn 10 Studios.[1]\n\nReferences\n\nCampbell, Colin (20 September 2016). \"Forza Horizon 3 Review\".

It is the predominant variant of the C-135 Stratolifter family of transport aircraft. The KC-135 was the US Air Force's first jet-powered refueling tanker and replaced the KC-97 Stratofreighter. The KC-135 was initially tasked with refueling strategic bombers, but it was used extensively in the Vietnam War and later conflicts such as Operation Desert Storm to extend the range and endurance of US tactical fighters and bombers.\n\nThe KC-135 entered service with the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1957; it is one of six military fixed-wing aircraft with over 50 years of continuous service[1] with its original operator. The KC-135 is supplemented by the larger KC-10. Studies have concluded that many of the aircraft could be flown until 2030, although maintenance costs have greatly increased. The KC-135 is to be partially replaced by the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus.\n\nContents\n\n1 Development\n\n1.1 Background\n\n1.2 Engine retrofits\n\n1.3 Avionics upgrades\n\n1.4 Further upgrades and derivatives\n\n2 Design\n\n3 Operational history\n\n3.1 Introduction into service\n\n3.2 Research usage\n\n3.3 Replacing the KC-135\n\n4 Variants\n\n5 Operators\n\n5.1 Former operators\n\n6 Accidents\n\n7 Aircraft on display\n\n8 Specifications (KC-135R)\n\n9 See also\n\n10 References\n\n11 Bibliography\n\n12 External links\n\nDevelopment\n\nA Cold War-era image of B-52D refueling from a KC-135A. Both aircraft shown were operated by the Strategic Air Command.\n\nBackground\n\nLike its sibling, the commercial Boeing 707 jet airliner, the KC-135 was derived from the Boeing 367-80 jet transport \"proof of concept\" demonstrator, which was commonly called the \"Dash-80\". The KC-135 is similar in appearance to the 707, but has a narrower fuselage and is shorter than the 707. The KC-135 predates the 707, and is structurally quite different from the civilian airliner. Boeing gave the future KC-135 tanker the initial designation Model 717.[2]\n\nIn 1954 USAF's Strategic Air Command (SAC) held a competition for a jet-powered aerial refueling tanker. Lockheed's tanker version of the proposed Lockheed L-193 airliner with rear fuselage-mounted engines was declared the winner in 1955.[3] Since Boeing's proposal was already flying, the KC-135 could be delivered two years earlier and Air Force Secretary Harold E. Talbott ordered 250 KC-135 tankers until Lockheed's design could be manufactured. In the end, orders for the Lockheed tanker were dropped rather than supporting two tanker designs. Lockheed never produced its jet airliner, while Boeing would eventually dominate the market with a family of airliners based on the 707.[4][5]\n\nIn 1954, the Air Force placed an initial order for 29 KC-135As, the first of an eventual 820 of all variants of the basic C-135 family. The first aircraft flew in August 1956 and the initial production Stratotanker was delivered to Castle Air Force Base, California, in June 1957. The last KC-135 was delivered to the Air Force in 1965.\n\nUSAF KC-135R boom operator view from boom pod\n\nDeveloped in the early 1950s, the basic airframe is characterized by 35-degree aft swept wings and tail, four underwing-mounted engine pods, a horizontal stabilizer mounted on the fuselage near the bottom of the vertical stabilizer with positive dihedral on the two horizontal planes and a hi-frequency radio antenna which protrudes forward from the top of the vertical fin or stabilizer. These basic features make it strongly resemble the commercial Boeing 707 and 720 aircraft, although it is actually a different aircraft.\n\nReconnaissance and command post variants of the aircraft, including the RC-135 Rivet Joint and EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft were operated by SAC from 1963 through 1992, when they were reassigned to the Air Combat Command (ACC). The USAF EC-135 Looking Glass was subsequently replaced in its role by the U.S. Navy E-6 Mercury aircraft, a new build airframe based on the Boeing 707-320B.\n\nEngine retrofits\n\nAll KC-135s were originally equipped with Pratt & Whitney J57-P-59W turbojet engines, which produced 10,000 lbf (44 kN) of thrust dry, and approximately 13,000 lbf (58 kN) of thrust wet. Wet thrust is achieved through the use of water injection on takeoff, as opposed to \"wet thrust\" when used to describe an afterburning engine. 670 US gallons (2,500 L) of water are injected into the engines over the course of three minutes. The water is injected into the inlet and the diffuser case in front of the combustion case. The water cools the air in the engine to increase its density; it also reduces the turbine gas temperature, which is a primary limitation on many jet engines. This allows the use of more fuel for proper combustion and creates more thrust for short periods of time, similar in concept to \"War Emergency Power\" in a piston-engined aircraft.\n\nThe front of several gray aircraft are centered in the image.\n\nA nose-on view of several reworked KC-135R aircraft taxiing prior to takeoff. The new engines are CFM56-2 high-bypass turbofans.\n\nIn the 1980s the first modification program retrofitted 157 Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and Air National Guard (ANG) tankers with the Pratt & Whitney TF33-PW-102 turbofan engines from 707 airliners retired in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The modified tanker, designated the KC-135E, was 14% more fuel-efficient than the KC-135A and could offload 20% more fuel on long-duration flights. Only the KC-135E aircraft were equipped with thrust reversers for aborted takeoffs and shorter landing roll-outs. The KC-135E fleet has since either been retrofitted as the R-model configuration or placed into long-term storage (\"XJ\"), as Congress has prevented the Air Force from formally retiring them. The final KC-135E, tail number 56-3630, was delivered by the 101st Air Refueling Wing to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in September 2009.[6]\n\nFlight deck of KC-135R; instrument panel has been modified under the Pacer-CRAG program\n\nThe second modification program retrofitted 500 aircraft with new CFM International CFM56 (military designation: F108) high-bypass turbofan engines produced by General Electric and Safran. The CFM56 engine produces approximately 22,500 lbf (100 kN) of thrust, nearly a 100% increase compared to the original J57 engine. The modified tanker, designated KC-135R (modified KC-135A or E) or KC-135T (modified KC-135Q), can offload up to 50% more fuel (on a long-duration sortie), is 25% more fuel-efficient, and costs 25% less to operate than with the previous engines. It is also significantly quieter than the KC-135A, with noise levels at takeoff reduced from 126 to 99 decibels.[7][8]\n\nThe KC-135R's operational range is 60% greater than the KC-135E for comparable fuel offloads, providing a wider range of basing options.[9]\n\nUpgrading the remaining KC-135Es into KC-135Rs is no longer in consideration; this would have cost approximately US$3 billion, $24 million per aircraft.[9] According to Air Force data, the KC-135 fleet had a total operation and support cost in fiscal year 2001 of about $2.2 billion. The older E model aircraft averaged total costs of about $4.6 million per aircraft, while the R models averaged about $3.7 million per aircraft. Those costs include personnel, fuel, maintenance, modifications, and spare parts.[10]\n\nAvionics upgrades\n\nBlock 45 glass cockpit\n\nIn order to expand the KC-135's capabilities and improve its reliability, the aircraft has undergone a number of avionics upgrades. Among these was the Pacer-CRAG program (compass, radar and GPS) which ran from 1999 to 2002 and modified all the aircraft in the inventory to eliminate the Navigator position from the flight crew. The fuel management system was also replaced. The program development was done by Rockwell Collins in Iowa[11] and installation was performed by BAE Systems at the Mojave Airport in California.[12] Block 40.6 allows the KC-135 to comply with global air-traffic management. The latest block upgrade to the KC-135, the Block 45 program, is online with the first 45 upgraded aircraft delivered by January 2017. Block 45 adds a new glass cockpit digital display, radio altimeter, digital autopilot, digital flight director and computer updates. The original, no longer procurable, analog instruments, including all engine gauges, were replaced.[13] Rockwell Collins again supplied the major avionic modules and the modification work is being done at Tinker AFB.[14]\n\nFurther upgrades and derivatives\n\nThe KC-135Q variant was modified to carry JP-7 fuel necessary for the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird by separating the JP-7 from the KC-135's own fuel supply (the body tanks carrying JP-7, and the wing tanks carrying JP-4 or JP-8). The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks.[15] When the KC-135Q model received the CFM56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body tanks from the wing tanks where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T is the presence of a clear window on the underside of the empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted. It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the body tanks and wing tanks separately.\n\nCutaway of the Flight Refueling Limited Mk.32B Refueling Pod\n\nEight KC-135R aircraft are receiver-capable tankers, commonly referred to as KC-135R(RT). All eight aircraft were with the 22d Air Refueling Wing at McConnell AFB, Kansas, in 1994.[16] They are primarily used for force extension and Special Operations missions, and are crewed by highly qualified receiver capable crews. If not used for the receiver mission, these aircraft can be flown just like any other KC-135R.\n\nThe Multi-point Refueling Systems (MPRS) modification adds refueling pods to the KC-135's wings. The pods allow refueling of U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and most NATO tactical jet aircraft while keeping the tail-mounted refueling boom. The pods themselves are Flight Refueling Limited (FRL) MK.32B model pods, and refuel via the probe and drogue method common to USN/USMC tactical jets, rather than the primary \"flying boom\" method used by USAF fixed-wing aircraft. This allows the tanker to refuel two receivers at the same time, which increases throughput compared to the boom drogue adapter.[17]\n\nA number of KC-135A and KC-135B aircraft have been modified to EC-135, RC-135 and OC-135 configurations for use in several different roles (although these could also be considered variants of the C-135 Stratolifter family).\n\nDesign\n\nThe KC-135R has four turbofan engines, mounted under 35-degree swept wings,[18] which power it to takeoffs at gross weights up to 322,500 pounds (146,300 kg). Nearly all internal fuel can be pumped through the tanker's flying boom, the KC-135's primary fuel transfer method. A special shuttlecock-shaped drogue, attached to and trailing behind the flying boom, may be used to refuel aircraft fitted with probes. This apparatus is significantly more unforgiving of pilot error in the receiving aircraft than conventional trailing hose arrangements; an aircraft so fitted is also incapable of refueling by the normal flying boom method until the attachment is removed. A boom operator stationed in the rear of the aircraft controls the boom while lying prone. A cargo deck above the refueling system can hold a mixed load of passengers and cargo. Depending on fuel storage configuration, the KC-135 can carry up to 83,000 pounds (38,000 kg) of cargo.\n\nOperational history\n\nIntroduction into service\n\nAn F-15 backs out after refueling from a KC-135R.\n\nThe KC-135 was initially purchased to support bombers of the Strategic Air Command, but by the late 1960s, in the Southeast Asia theater, the KC-135 Stratotanker's ability as a force multiplier came to the fore. Midair refueling of F-105 and F-4 fighter-bombers as well as B-52 bombers brought far-flung bombing targets within reach, and allowed fighter missions to spend hours at the front, rather than a few minutes, which was usual due to their limited fuel reserves and high fuel consumption. KC-135 crews refueled both Air Force and Navy / Marine Corps aircraft; though they would have to change to probe and drogue adapters depending upon the mission, the Navy and Marine Corps not having fitted their aircraft with flying boom receptacles since the USAF boom system was impractical for aircraft carrier operations. Crews also helped to bring in damaged aircraft which could sometimes fly while being fed by fuel to a landing site or to ditch over the water (specifically those with punctured fuel tanks). KC-135s continued their tactical support role in later conflicts such as Operation Desert Storm and current aerial strategy.\n\nSAC had the KC-135 Stratotanker in service with Regular Air Force SAC units from 1957 through 1992 and with SAC-gained ANG and AFRES units from 1975 through 1992.[19] Following a major USAF reorganization that resulted in the inactivation of SAC in 1992, most KC-135s were reassigned to the newly created AMC.[19] While AMC gained the preponderance of the aerial refueling mission, a small number of KC-135s were also assigned directly to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). All AFRC KC-135s and most of the ANG KC-135 fleet became operationally-gained by AMC, while Alaska Air National Guard and Hawaii Air National Guard KC-135s became operationally-gained by PACAF.[citation needed]\n\nAMC manages 414 Stratotankers, of which the AFRC and ANG fly 247 in support of AMC's mission as of May 2014.[20] The KC-135 is one of a few military aircraft types with over 50 years of continuous service with its original operator as of 2009.[21][22]\n\nIsrael was offered KC-135s again in 2013, after turning down the aging aircraft twice due to expense of keeping them flying.[23][24] The IAF again rejected the offered KC-135Es, but said that it would consider up to a dozen of the newer KC-135Rs.[25]\n\nResearch usage\n\nKC-135 winglet flight tests at Armstrong Flight Research Center.\n\nBesides its primary role as an inflight aircraft refueler, the KC-135, designated NKC-135, has assisted in several research projects at the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California. One such project occurred between 1979 and 1980 when special wingtip \"winglets\", developed by Richard Whitcomb of the Langley Research Center, were tested at Armstrong, using an NKC-135A tanker loaned to NASA by the Air Force. Winglets are small, nearly vertical fins installed on an aircraft's wing tips. The results of the research showed that drag was reduced and range could be increased by as much as 7 percent at cruise speeds.[26][27] Winglets are now being incorporated into most new commercial and military transport/passenger jets, as well as business aviation jets.\n\nNASA also has operated several KC-135 aircraft (without the tanker equipment installed) as their famed Vomit Comet zero-gravity simulator aircraft. The longest-serving (1973 to 1995) version was KC-135A, AF Ser. No. 59-1481, named Weightless Wonder IV and registered as N930NA.[28]\n\nReplacing the KC-135\n\nMain article: KC-X\n\nKC-135Rs at twilight on the flight line\n\nBetween 1993 and 2003, the amount of KC-135 depot maintenance work doubled, and the overhaul cost per aircraft tripled.[29] In 1996, it cost $8,400 per flight hour for the KC-135, and in 2002 this had grown to $11,000. The Air Force's 15-year estimates project further significant cost growth through fiscal year 2017. KC-135 fleet operations and support costs are estimated to grow from about $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2003 to $5.1 billion (2003 dollars) in fiscal year 2017, an increase of over 130 percent, which represents an annual growth rate of about 6.2 percent.[30]\n\nThe Air Force projected that E and R models have lifetime flying hour limits of 36,000 and 39,000 hours, respectively. According to the Air Force, only a few KC-135s would reach these limits by 2040, when some aircraft would be about 80 years old. A later 2005 Air Force study estimated that KC-135Es upgraded to the R standard could remain in use until 2030.[9][better source needed]\n\nIn 2006, the KC-135E fleet was flying an annual average of 350 hours per aircraft and the KC-135R fleet was flying an annual average of 710 hours per aircraft. The KC-135 fleet is currently flying double its planned yearly flying hour program to meet airborne refueling requirements, and has resulted in higher than forecast usage and sustainment costs.[31] In March 2009, the Air Force indicated that KC-135s would require additional skin replacement to allow their continued use beyond 2018.[32]\n\nView from the boom operator's hatch as a F-35 takes on fuel from a KC-135 of the 912d ARS\n\nThe USAF decided to replace the KC-135 fleet. However, the KC-135 fleet is large and will need to be replaced gradually. Initially the first batch of replacement planes was to be an air tanker version of the Boeing 767, leased from Boeing. In 2003, this was changed to contract where the Air Force would purchase 80 KC-767 aircraft and lease 20 more.[33] In December 2003, the Pentagon froze the contract and in January 2006, the KC-767 contract was canceled. This followed public revelations of corruption in how the contract was awarded, as well as controversy regarding the original leasing rather than outright purchase agreement. Then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld stated that this move will in no way impair the Air Force's ability to deliver the mission of the KC-767, which will be accomplished by continuing upgrades to the KC-135 and KC-10 Extender fleet.\n\nIn January 2007, the U.S. Air Force formally launched the KC-X program with a request for proposal (RFP). KC-X is first phase of three acquisition programs to replace the KC-135 fleet.[34] On 29 February 2008, the US Defense Department announced that it had selected the EADS/Northrop Grumman \"KC-30\" (to be designated the KC-45A) over the Boeing KC-767.[35][36][37] Boeing protested the award on 11 March 2008, citing irregularities in the competition and bid evaluation.[38] On 18 June 2008, the US Government Accountability Office sustained Boeing's protest of the selection of the Northrop Grumman/EADS's tanker.[39] In February 2010, the US Air Force restarted the KC-X competition with the release of a revised request for proposal (RFP).[40][41] After evaluating bids, the USAF selected Boeing's 767-based tanker design, with the military designation KC-46, as a replacement in February 2011.[42] The first KC-46A Pegasus was delivered to the U.S. Air Force on 10 January 2019.[43]\n\nTwo foreign users of the KC-135, the French Air Force and the Republic of Singapore Air Force are taking deliveries of Airbus A330 MRTTs as replacements for their Stratotankers.[44][45]\n\nVariants\n\nSee Boeing C-135 Stratolifter for further details on the C-135 family.\n\nActive KC-135 aircraft liveries\n\nKC-135A\n\nOriginal production version powered by four Pratt & Whitney J57s, 732 built.
