        "text": "Standing before a crowded room at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2015 event in Barcelona on March 1, JK Shin, CEO and Head of IT and Mobile Communications at Samsung Electronics, delivered a keynote speech in which he unveiled Samsung’s new premium smartphones, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge.\n\nAs illustrated in the word cloud below, the three keywords that Shin mentioned the most were “best,” “relentless” and “next”. This was by design, as Samsung presented its two new flagship smartphones and the new philosophy that goes along with them. The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge mark a clear departure in smartphone innovation, showcasing the most beautiful and powerful smartphones in Samsung’s history. They are also a clear indicator of the company’s commitment to relentless innovation and putting what’s next in people’s hands now, offering best-in-class technology faster than the competition.\n\nRelentless Innovation\n\nThe Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge reflect Samsung’s relentless pursuit of innovation. This philosophy has helped Samsung solidify its place as the world’s leading mobile company.\n\n“We got here because we’re passionate about technology,” JK Shin said. “And we’ve never rested on our past achievements. We listened to our customers. We learned from our successes and our missteps. And we pushed forward. New technologies. New ideas. That’s how we have offered better products and how we’ve offered new products first.”\n\nSamsung’s relentless push to develop new advanced technologies and products like AMOLED screens, LTE technology, the Note, the Gear, and most recently, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, have set a new bar for design, craftsmanship and performance.\n\nBest-In-Class Design and Performance\n\nThe Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge blend beautiful form and materials with purposeful technological innovations to deliver value and usability to demanding consumers. Every aspect, from material to shape to the user experience, was considered from an entirely new perspective that focuses on premium device aesthetics as well as usability and functionality.\n\nThe performance of both devices also received a boost over the Galaxy S5, thanks to new embedded technologies such as the world’s first 14-nanometer 64-bit ARM processor, the Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.0 standard, which substantially enhances the speed of reading and writing from and to memory, and the Low Power Double Data Rate 4 (LPDDR4). Users will have a lightning fast device that is also remarkably energy efficient, which results in better battery life.\n\nMobile customers demand better, more versatile cameras that can take great photos, which is why the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge are also equipped with incredibly vivid, bright and fast front and rear cameras. The f/1.9 lenses and high resolution sensors on both front (5MP) and rear (16MP) cameras provide the most superior image quality in a smartphone, even in the dark. In addition, Auto Real-time High Dynamic Range (HDR), Smart Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and IR Detect White Balance provide advanced light sensitivities and crisp camera solutions.\n\nNext is Now"
