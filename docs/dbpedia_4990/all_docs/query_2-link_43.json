        "text": "The good news: in just over a week Samsung will formally unveil the Galaxy S6. The bad news: it may have nothing new to show. The nadir for Samsung has struck today after two hugely talented designers rounded up every consistent leak to create stunning renders of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge from every angle.\n\nThe duo, Ivo Maric and Jermaine Smit, had huge amounts of information to go on - including full schematics and chassis components - but putting them altogether remains no mean feat and the finished video reveals the radical new direction Samsung will take with both handsets.\n\nThe attention to detail in the video is staggering with even the handsets’ colour options from leaked Pantone numbers shown off. There is also an illustration of the phones’ expected wireless charging and the enlarged, slightly more protruding home button which will house an upgraded fingerprint sensor. Particularly impressive are the lifestyle renders at the 1 minute 30 second mark.\n\nRead more - iPhone 6 vs Galaxy S5 Review: Apple Gatecrashes Samsung\n\nInaccuracies? Nothing obvious. This is by far the most impressive handset render I've seen. Of course Samsung could have us all fooled and pull out something completely different at its 1 March launch, but I highly doubt it.\n\nFurthermore the design changes are a big step in the right direction for Samsung. I'm still not convinced the Galaxy S6 will outshine the upcoming HTC One M9 in the looks department, but the S6 Edge will be a real head turner.\n\nThen again perhaps the bigger questions about the Galaxy S6 at this stage are all internal. Namely: performance, battery life and the software experience.\n\nThe first two will be greatly influenced by Samsung’s decision to ditch Qualcomm for its own Exynos 7420 chipset. Surprisingly the Galaxy S6 will have a smaller battery than its predecessor so Samsung’s claims about the greater efficiency of the 7420 will need to stand up.\n\nIn addition Samsung is said to be making a major U-turn when it comes to software with much of the bloatware associated with its TouchWiz Android interface being stripped away. Again the primary benefit should be greatly improved performance.\n\nRead more - iPhone 6 Plus vs Galaxy Note 4 Review: The Biggest Phone Fight\n\nHaving suffered deeply disappointing Galaxy S5 sales, the Galaxy S6 (developed under the codename ‘Project Zero’) is Samsung’s big play at getting back on track. Based on the picture we are now able to put together I think the company is on the right track.\n\n___\n\nFollow @GordonKelly"
