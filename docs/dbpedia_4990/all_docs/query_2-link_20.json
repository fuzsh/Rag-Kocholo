        "text": "The second of our big Android smartphone announcements just kicked off this fine Sunday morning. The Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge were officially unveiled, and Samsung put on quite an impressive show. Sammy's flagship is officially outed now, and Samsung fans have something new to be excited about.\n\nWill the Samsung Galaxy S6 & S6 Edge be a hit? Here at HQ we are actually quite impressed with the Galaxy S6 Edge, but aren't sure what to think about the regular Galaxy S6. Its aesthetic design isn't much different from the past (except for the back), and it has given up many of the features that fans of the Galaxy series appreciated (like a removable battery and a microSD slot).\n\nStill, to reiterate, the Galaxy S6 Edge does push the envelope on both a technological and an aesthetic level. It's a truly beautiful smartphone and could really surprise this year. Also, Samsung's Exynos 7420 (industry first and only 14nm chip) brings some impressive specs to the table, and really evolves the internal hardware to a new level. The phone also has the fastest quick charging battery in the industry and has built-in wireless charging. The camera includes the world's first real-time HDR lighting in a smartphone for fantastic pics and video.\n\nThe phone will initially come in white, black, gold, & blue-green and will be available on April 10th.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nYou can see the full specs of both the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge in the thread below.\n\nHere is our dedicated Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge section for further discussion: Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge General Discussions Android Forum at DroidForums.net\n\nThere are a couple of images of the devices in the thread below that show off the aesthetics of these new flagships from Sammy.\n\n[Editor's Note: We originally reported that the S6 & S6 Edge would come in blue and green, but it turns out the color of the phone is both blue and green depending on the lighting. We updated the story to reflect the correction.]\n\nSo just a marginally improved version of what we already have? Not even that, really, because you lose the battery and SD slot... So in several key ways, the new phone is a downgraded phone...\n\nThe curved edges don't impress me. Makes it harder to find a decent case, because the edges have to stay exposed...\n\nSure, it is higher resolution than the S5, but on a small screen, it isn't really that noticeably... You almost need the larger phablet screens to start to take advantage of it...\n\nNot sure what Samsung is thinking...\n\nThe cellular carriers love that they've given up the SD card because more and more data will be used to back up those bigger and bigger photos and videos to the cloud. One thing is for sure, hope it supports USB OTG, though it should.\n\nRemovable batteries were a real sticking point for users and it's going to be a real sore spot. It's interesting how I've heard from Samsung owners how their battery life was great but then they say removable batteries were a must.\n\nWonder how many diehard Samsung fans will make the move to the S6 or S6 Edge? Should certainly stir some conversation.\n\nThe only problem with making a phone this nice, is that you will want and need to cover it... Nobody wants a phone like that, all scratched and banged up... so putting all the extra effort and money into the external aesthetic, seems a bit of a waste to me. I mean, you want it to look nice, but 90% or more of the people why buy it, are just gonna put it in a case anyway... so I would rather the R&D go into the internals and screen, etc..."
