        "text": "If you're using the Galaxy Z Flip 4 in a world where the Galaxy Z Flip 5 exists, you might be asking yourself if you should have upgraded to the Z Flip 5 already or if you should pick up the Galaxy Z Flip 6 once it goes official later this summer. We'd say the 2nd option is wiser for the long term, but there's also a 3rd option: Keep using the Galaxy Z Flip 4 for as long as possible.\n\nThis might be a somewhat controversial claim, but, you see, even if the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is technically superior to the Galaxy Z Flip 4, your Flip 4 might be the more fun flip phone to use. Why should that be the case? Well, it all has to do with the cover screen and how the Flip 5's larger panel changes the user's habits.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 4 is a â€˜better' flip phone\n\nSamsung's newer Galaxy Z Flip 5 is a marvel. It's gorgeous and it's more practical than your Galaxy Z Flip 4, not only because of its hardware upgrades but thanks to an evolution in its design. Its bigger cover screen is a game-changer, and early leaks show that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will have a similarly-sized cover screen. But is it possible that Samsung went a little too far?\n\nYou see, nearly every Galaxy Z Flip 4 user we encountered admitted that, once they upgraded to the Galaxy Z Flip 5, they inevitably changed the way they use the flip phone. The cover screen is so practical compared to previous generations that they found themselves flipping the phone open far less often.\n\nOf course, most users are happy with the upgrade, as the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is a technically superior device with more practicality. Besides, putting less stress on the hinge and foldable screen is a boon.\n\nNevertheless, if you're a flip phone purist who simply enjoys the act of flipping open the phone and taking full advantage of Samsung's clever hinge, its nostalgic flip phone design, and advanced foldable display technology, the Galaxy Z Flip 4 is most likely a better phone for you. Or, at the very least, it's a lot more fun.\n\nThere's no other way to put it. The Galaxy Z Flip 5's bigger cover screen leaned too much into practicality. And even though it is a weird thing to complain about, it does take something away from the flip phone's charm. Simply put, the practicality of the larger cover screen contributes to making the flip phone experience duller. Conversely, the Z Flip 4's design limitations funnel the user experience in a way that maximizes the flip phone design's wow and fun factors.\n\nIn the practical sense, the Z Flip 5 most likely made the right trade-off. But if you are among those who enjoy the Flip series mainly for the flip design, you might not want to rush into upgrading your Galaxy Z Flip 4 to a newer model. The Galaxy Z Flip 4 gives you just enough reasons to flip it open and enjoy the foldable design."
