        "text": "Samsung has just unveiled one of their next flagship smartphones for 2015 – the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nMuch like how the Note Edge was a Note 4 with a curve on the right side, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is basically the same as the Galaxy S6. The main difference here is that the screen now curves both ways, making it a lot more beautiful to look at. It also has some functionality added to the software to utilize this curve.\n\nBeing a Galaxy S6 genetically, it’s also made out of metal and Gorilla Glass 4. That also means it will have a Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440, the latest 64-bit octa-core Exynos 7420 CPU, and a much better 16 megapixel camera paired with a 5 megapixel selfie camera. This one however, packs a slightly larger 2,600 mAh battery that is capable of Qi Wireless Charging.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge specs:\n\n5.1-inch 2560 x 1440 curved Super AMOLED display, 577 ppi\n\nGorilla Glass 4\n\n64-bit octa-core Exynos 7420 CPU\n\n3GB RAM\n\n32, 64, 128 GB internal memory\n\n16 megapixel rear camera\n\n5 megapixel front-facing camera\n\nWiFi\n\nBluetooth\n\nNFC\n\n4G, Single LTE Cat 6\n\nSingle SIM\n\nQi Wireless Charging\n\n2,600 mAh non-removable battery\n\nGold, Black, Green\n\nAndroid 5.0.2 Lollipop with TouchWiz\n\n7.0 mm\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge will be available globally on April 10 (earlier or later in the PH), in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB variants, in black, gold and in a special green edition."
