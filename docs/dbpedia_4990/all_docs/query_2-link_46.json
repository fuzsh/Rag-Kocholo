        "text": "You kinda just made his point by saying you use a launcher on your Nexus. The fact of the matter is, you're adding all of these \"extras\" to your Nexus that TW has baked in. I've seen enough side by side comparisons with the Nexus 5 and S5 and Nexus 6 vs S6 and Nexus 6 vs Note 4 to know better.\n\nand for those \"occasional\" times when the Nexus is faster, it's so minuscule, you can hardly use those situations to call TW a resource hog.\n\nBut hey, you're happy with yours and I'm happy with mine, its all good. Having a choice is what matters.\n\nS5 tap'n\n\nI get what they are trying to convey about loading a Launcher on top of stock Android and still not experiencing lag, but I'm not experiencing any issues at all on my Note Edge. Neither did I on my S4 (Exynos) or my Note 3 (Exynos). Maybe I am just not bothered by the micro second it takes to switch between apps or maybe their Note 4 has issues?\n\nYou kinda just made his point by saying you use a launcher on your Nexus.

The Note 4 has the same hardware as the Nexus 6 but is crippled by the TW overlay, the Note 4 is a nice device but should be better than it is, as attested by the Nexus 6 which has the same hardware but runs smoother than the Note 4, which should not be the case, but it is. I am not the only one saying this, it's all over the www, by many top review sights. Nova is just a Launcher not a software skin built into the OS like TW is that takes away from what the Note 4 should be. It's as obvious as night from day, TW just blows. Also the front speakers on the Nexus 6 makes the back speaker on the Note 4 seem like a joke.\n\nSent from my Nexus 6 using Tapatalk"
