        "text": "Samsung has officially kicked off its Galaxy S6 and S6 edge marketing campaign to introduce the stunning form and breathtaking innovation of the all new Galaxy. As part of the Next is Now campaign, an inspiring TV ad, entitled “Anticipation,” created by critically acclaimed director Mark Romanek, has been unveiled.\n\nWhether it’s the first drop on a rollercoaster, the first swing at the birthday piñata or the first performance on stage, the anticipation for what’s next always gets one’s adrenaline pumping. A new brand campaign for Samsung’s highly anticipated Galaxy S6 and S6 edge release seeks to capture and convey those same feelings.\n\nThe Next is Now campaign, for the completely redesigned Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, is part of one of Samsung’s biggest launches in recent years. Next is Now will be featured around the globe, supporting all campaign components, including television, digital, experiential, OOH and retail activations.\n\n“Anticipation,” a 60-second spot that will air online and on broadcast television, follows several people’s suspenseful experiences during intimate and public moments, highlighting the Galaxy S6’s role in the anticipation. British singer-songwriter Rita Ora, a rising star and one of the hottest style icons of today, is featured in the campaign and can be seen recording her latest track, “New York Raining,” in the studio.\n\nThe ad emphasizes the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge’s beautifully crafted edge designs and powerful performance capabilities, including camera and wireless charging proficiencies, with the message that owning one of these devices is comparable to holding the future in one’s hands.\n\nA series of additional TV ads that focuses on specific features of the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge have also been developed.\n\nThe commercials were directed by Mark Romanek. He has worked on ad campaigns for several global brands and his commercials, music videos and films have garnered critical acclaim. His music videos have won more than 20 MTV VMAs, two Grammy Awards and three Billboard Music Awards, while his ads have landed him both a Cannes Lion and AICP honors.\n\nIn addition to “Anticipation,” which demonstrates the multiple benefits of the latest Galaxy models to the consumers, a series of the television advertisements are scheduled to be released, featuring a more in-depth look at the stories of the individuals in “Anticipation.” You can watch each of the commercials in the links below.\n\nEdge Design – Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Official TVC\n\nCamera – Samsung Galaxy S6 Official TVC\n\nFast Charging – Samsung Galaxy S6 Official TVC"
