        "text": "Samsung has developed two new smartphones with a wide range of features to bring it into direct competition with Apple.\n\nThe company launched the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge at the Unpacked showcase in Barcelona. One of the main features of the new handsets is the lack of a plastic case; instead, Samsung has gone for a metal body to give the handsets a premium image.\n\nSamsung says that these are the most advanced smartphones on the market and new features include a wireless charging system, which means that that there is no need for the handset to be connected to the mains. The S6 can charge 1.5 times faster than Samsung’s S5 handset.\n\nOther features of the handsets include a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED screen and a top-quality camera. There is also a payment system integrated into the smartphones similar to the Apple Pay system.\n\nThe phones are due to be launched within a few weeks and the company needs them to be a success, as the Galaxy S5 was not well received. Samsung once led its rivals in terms of handset sales; however, some of its latest models have compared unfavourably with those from other manufacturers. Rival Apple has officially become the most valuable company in the world and other rival companies are planning to launch new handsets soon.\n\nExperts have so far been positive about the new handsets and Samsung will be focussing on a smaller number of handsets in the future."
