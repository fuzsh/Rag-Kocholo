Famous director Quentin Tarantino negotiates with Željko Mitrović, the owner of “Pink“, about making his future high-budget movie project in Serbia, in Mitrović’s studio PFI. Namely, Željko Mitrović promoted his new film studio in Cannes. The opening of the studio in Šimanovci, near Belgrade, is scheduled for September 2007.

It has been announced that “Pink Films International“ currently negotiates with about 20 other large movie companies that will visit Belgrade during summer and autumn to check the quality of the Film studio. The foreign partners are especially attracted by low prices.

PFI already has respectable domestic production, because they already shot two domestic movies – “Transformer“, directed by tandem Karadžić-Koprivica, and “Čitulja za Eskobara“, directed by Milorad Milinković.
