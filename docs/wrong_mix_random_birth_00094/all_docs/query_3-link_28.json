        "text": "Scott’s career began in international advertising, overseeing dozens of commercial productions and culminated with him being one of the leads responsible for SONY PlayStation’s $100m worldwide advertising account based in London. Then, after running his own agency, and developing the brand strategy for the global launch of Xbox, Scott transitioned into writing and directing feature films.\n\nScott’s first film was THE FROZEN GROUND for Lionsgate, starring Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and Vanessa Hudgens. It was selected to premier in top international film festivals including Cinemania Film Festival Belgrade, Deauville International Film Festival and the Ischia International Film Festival, and was released theatrically in the US and in more than 25 countries internationally. It was then acquired by Netflix, and within 3 days became their #1 most watched film in the US, with Quentin Tarantino calling it “the best serial killer film, I’ve seen in years!”\n\nMost recently, Scott worked with Sir Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop on his latest feature film, THE TANK, which was released worldwide and reached #2 on Apple TV in the US.\n\nScott is married to an amazing and inspiring singer-songwriter wife and has two terrific boys and a crazy pup they rescued in NZ during Covid, who has now joined them in their adventures in the UK.\n\nScott is passionate about being passionate in all you choose to do and always looking for fun experiences and adventures in all aspects of life and career.\n\nScott loves art, music, cooking, stories and spending time with family and friends. In an effort for Scott to prove that anything is possible, Scott is also a two-time, 550 degree fire walker."
