He published his first comics in Yugoslavian magazines in the first half of the 1980s. He created the spaghetti western 'Elmer Jones' with Dragan Savic in Yu Strip in 1982. Another creation for Yu Strip was 'Cak Lorimera'. By 1984 he collaborated on the comic series 'Texas Riders' for Forum Marketprint.\n\nScalped\n\nHe moved to Spain in 1991, where he changed his pseudonym Gera to the more \"Spanishized\" Guéra. He initially worked together with Spanish writer Oscar Aibar on several short stories. He then focused on commercial work, like advertisements, design, covers and animation storyboards for a while. He has worked with Patrick Cothias on 'Le Lièvre de Mars', a series previously drawn by Antonio Parras for Glénat in France. Guéra also created his own comic for Glénat, the pirate story 'Howard Blake' in 2004.\n\nFor the US market, Guéra made the Vertigo series 'Scalped' with Jason Aaron from 2007, and he created the comic book adaptation of the Quentin Tarantino film 'Django Unchained' with Jason Latour as a DC Comics mini-series in 2012 and 2013. He is also a blues musician, having played in bands like Strip Bluz Bandu (in Belgrade) and Custom Blend (in Spain).\n\nDjango Unchained"
