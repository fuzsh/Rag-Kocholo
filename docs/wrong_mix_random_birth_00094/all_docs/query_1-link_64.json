        "text": "O BREATHE ACCORDING TO IVAN VYRYPAEV\n\nIvan Aleksandrovich Vyrypaev, a playwright, theatre and film director and actor, was born in 1974 in Irkutsk, Siberia, a town in the vicinity of Lake Baikal, which is one of the most important stops of the Trans-Siberian Railway, 5125 kilometres away from Moscow. Unlike some dramatic characters, the young artist from backcountry came all the way to Moscow and even farther because in his work so far he has had dozens of performances in the most prestigious theatres and won the most prestigious theatre awards. He was also chosen as the best playwright in Germany. He currently lives in Warsaw and this type of “dislocation” from Russia allows him a slightly different, wider perspective and thus brings more “oxygen” to his creative landscape. Ivan Vyrypaev is a member of the new Russian dramatic literature, an author whose poetics (theatrical and film) in popular culture is often compared to the achievements of iconic film directors from the East and the West - Andrei Tarkovsky and Quentin Tarantino. His plays, in addition to the metaphysical issues that he unsparingly throws on the shoulders of his protagonists, have that unfathomable wit that radiates through the dark depths of their destinies. This type of quality, (often misinterpreted on Western stages), was something that one of the greatest playwrights, Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, also had. Ivan Vyrypaev’s plays establish a dynamic relationship with the audience, as actors and spectators are aware of each other’s presence, building a style that contains relentless and sharp simplicity of expression, like breathing, while on the other hand, it involves profound lyrical and metaphysical reflection. He became famous with the dramas “Dreamworks”, “Oxygen”, “Drunks”, “Being No. 2” and “July”. He was the artistic director of the iconic Moscow experimental theatre “Praktika”, which gathers young and contemporary artists, primarily directors, playwrights and actors who question the form and tendencies of theatre in the twenty-first century. As a screenwriter and director he primarily adapted his plays, for the film “Euphoria” he won the Little Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival for his debut film, and the films such as “Oxygen”, “Delhi Dance”, “UFO” followed, while “Salvation” was Vyrypaev’s first “non-theatrical film”. His new film “Illusions” is currently in the post-production phase and it is expected to premiere in 2023.\n\nDomestic audience is well acquainted with the works of Ivan Vyrypaev as some of his plays can be found on the repertoire of Belgrade theatres: “Illusions” and “Oxygen” directed by Tanja Mandić Rigonat, “Being No. 2” directed by Anja Suša, “Drunks” directed by Boris Liješević, “Oxygen“ directed by Milja Mazarak and “July “directed by Tara Manić. The drama “Iranian Conference” is the first play by Ivan Vyrypaev, which will be performed on the stage of the National Theatre in Belgrade, directed by Ivana Vujić.\n\nConference (Latin: conferentia) consultation, agreement; meeting for achieving agreement, discussion (about a disputable issue etc.); public lecture usually followed by a discussion.\n\nINTERVIEW WITH IVAN VYRYPAEV ON THE OCCASION OF THE FIRST PERFORMANCE OF THE “IRANIAN CONFERENCE” IN SERBIA\n\nThe play “Iranian Conference” was, of course, written before the Covid pandemic and looking from this point of view, we can consider this as a kind of shortcoming because scientists would certainly mention this pestilence at the conference. The topic they discuss is certainly very relevant today, and that is the “integral world”. And what does the integral world mean?\n\nThe integral world means a kind of “mush” or amalgam of concepts and institutions to which we give legitimacy and with whose laws and rules we identify, thus shaping our view of the world and everything around us. We are the ones who label something as “tolerant” or “socially acceptable”, but despite all this, one point of view always prevails. Of course, we as responsible and “adequate individuals” can come forward and say honestly, that we must respect and love all points of view. Nevertheless, each person has their own point of view in the end.\n\nThe question is: Who are we?\n\nAnd if we understand that WE is not a separate person who has their own view of the world, their own nationality. For example: I am Russian, I have my own view of the Russian world, my president is Putin. And that’s how I see the situation. Or I am Ukrainian and my president is Zelensky and that is how I see the situation. Or I am a Serb and that is how I see the situation. And all this means that all these constructions together: Me and Putin, Me and Zelensky and Biden, and all that together is one huge construction that is constantly developed simultaneously before all of us at all times. And in that construction, there is a movement called “Awareness”. One who understands this, immediately takes part in the development and change dynamics of this situation.\n\nThis is not a simple question. And the attempt to answer is not learning, or “dogma”, I do not want to point to any religious symbolism, this is a simple drama, in which the main character says in the end that love is dissolution, a state of disintegration, that is, love is the absence of that “little me”.\n\nIt is a great honour for me that you decided to stage this play in Serbia. I have always wanted to come, because we are really connected by deep historical and cultural roots. I hope that the show will be a success. Lots of hugs.\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nInterviewer: Ljubinka Stojanović\n\nTranslated by Jelena Živanović\n\nNEON FIRES OF IVAN VYRYPAEV"
