        "text": "Honored Guests\n\nLloyd Kaufman – Ad Astra 2022 Recipient\n\nIn 1971, Kaufman met his future partner Michael Herz at Yale. The Troma Universe was born in 1974 with a series of highly original, raunchy comedies such as “Squeeze Play!,” “Stuck On You!,” “Waitress!,” and other titles ending with an exclamation point. These movies, independent precursors to such later smash hits as National Lampoon’s “Animal House” and “Porky’s,” did well financially. However, Kaufman continued to work on such outside productions as “Rocky” and “Saturday Night Fever.” Kaufman’s relationship with mainstream Hollywood would not last long “There were problems,” Kaufman said, “I always wanted to do things my own way, and my employers insisted I do things the correct way.”\n\nHe continued to build up a list of impressive credits and some overpowering debts. Kaufman proved his former employers wrong with his 1984 breakthrough movie, “The Toxic Avenger.” This tale of a health club mop boy named Melvin who is transformed into a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength struck a chord with audiences and critics alike, demonstrating that many people were interested in seeing things done Kaufman’s way. “The Toxic Avenger” led to an animated television series, Toxic Crusaders, action figures, different Marvel comic book titles, a hot sauce, etc. There were three sequels. The most recent film in the series is “Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV.” Currently, “The Toxic Avenger” is being developed by Legendary Entertainment and their team as a big-budget Hollywood remake. “Toxic Avenger The Musical” is playing in London’s West End, with music by Bon Jovi’s David Bryan.\n\nThe success of The Toxic Avenger was followed by a string of commercial and artistic triumphs in a similar vein, blending fantasy, heavy action, comedy, and eroticism in a style that can only be described as “Tromatic.” These films, including the “Class of Nuke ˜Em High” trilogy, “Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD,” and “Troma’s War,” were often ignored or scorned by the intelligentsia of the time but spoke to an entire generation of young people who rejected the pandering, commercial films of the mid-to-late ’80s. Some Troma fans became filmmakers, including Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Mike Judge, Peter Jackson, and Trey Parker. Thanks to these admirers, Kaufman has been asked to make cameo appearances in films like James Gunn’s “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Sharknado 4,” Trey Parker’s “Orgazmo,” Eli Roth’s “Cabin Fever,” and about 200 other indie movies.\n\nLela Meadow-Conner – 20th Anniversary Honoree\n\nLela Meadow-Conner is a Creative Producer and Founder of mama.film – a village at the crossroads of art & advocacy where storytellers, changemakers, and nurturers unite to champion humanity through a maternal gaze.
