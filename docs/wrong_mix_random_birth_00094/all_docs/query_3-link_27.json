        "text": "(soft music) - Hello and welcome to Prairie Pulse.\n\nComing up a little bit later in the show, we'll see clips from the winning films of the Fargo Film Festival.\n\nBut first joining me now is Sean Volk.\n\nSean, thanks for joining us today.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nThank you so much for having us.\n\n- Yeah, Sean, you're the development and engagement manager for the Fargo Theater.\n\nAnd of course you're here to represent the Fargo Film Festival.\n\n- [Sean] Yes.\n\n- It's exciting.\n\nWe're gonna talk about that, but first, tell the folks a little bit about yourself.\n\n- Yeah, well, again, just first, thank you so much for having us.\n\nWe're so grateful for the opportunity to talk about the festival and everything we do at the theater.\n\nWell, like you said, my name's Sean.\n\nI work at the Fargo Theater.\n\nI've been in a number of positions at the theater, so I've been really lucky to see a lot of different perspectives there.\n\nWhen I was in college at Concordia, I started behind the sand as a concession worker, and then when I graduated, I was promoted as the operations manager.\n\nI was there for two years, and then I left to go to grad school where I got a master's in film studies from the University of Western Ontario.\n\nAnd that was such an incredible experience.\n\nAnd since then, I've been fortunate to work for a number of film festivals around the country.\n\nAnd then in March of 2020, I know a wild and turbulent time, when we think about our, our recent history.\n\nI was really fortunate to come back to the theater in a newly created role, the Development and Engagement manager.\n\nAnd I've been there ever since, working with the theater and working with the festival.\n\n- You know, I look at this and this is the 2024 Fargo Film Festival and the 24th annual.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- So this is great.\n\nCan you discuss maybe some of the highlights of this year's edition and when it starts?\n\n- Absolutely.\n\nWe are so excited to welcome audiences to the theater for the fest.\n\nThe festival begins on Tuesday, March 19th, and it runs through the 23rd.\n\nSo I always like to say, if you've got five days, we've got five days of movies to play for you.\n\nWe're really, really happy to have it back at the theater.\n\nIt's such an important event for the theater, because it is the theater's largest single annual fundraiser.\n\nAs a nonprofit organization, we really rely on community support.\n\nAnd this is one way, whether you're coming to a movie, buying popcorn, that's a huge way to show support for the theater.\n\nAnd this year there are so many incredible movies.\n\nWe've got more than a hundred films scheduled, so it's hard to pick highlights or favorites.\n\nBut I would say a couple, just off the top of my head, we've got two Oscar nominees this year.\n\nSo if you watched the Oscars this past weekend, there's the documentary, \"Nai Nai & Wài Pó,\" which is this really beautiful moving intimate story where a documentarian goes to his grandmother's house and films their lives.\n\nSo his two grandmas moved in together late in life, and now they live together, and they just have this really amazing friendship and connection and the way that they each see the world is so different.\n\nAnd then we have the animated short \"Letter to a Pig,\" which was also Oscar nominated, and that is a really stirring and harrowing film about a Holocaust survivor reading a letter about what it took for him to survive that experience.\n\nSo it's incredible to see such world-class filmmaking on display.\n\nBut then, another film I wanna highlight is \"AJ Goes to the Dog Park.\"\n\nThat was a comedy made right here in Fargo-Moorhead.\n\nSo we're really excited to have its regional premier and to be able to show it to audiences here in Fargo so that they can see their friends and neighbors up on the big screen.\n\nIt's this wild comedy about a man who goes to this dog park every day with his little dog, and then it closes, and he has to do everything in his power.\n\nAnd there's a lot of weird things that he does to try and get it to reopen.\n\nIt's funny, it's wild.\n\nIt's very sweet.\n\nAnd the ending is something you have to see to believe.\n\n- Well, with that said, well, yeah, can you explain how films are entered into the festival for consideration, and then the process it goes through then for how they're selected?\n\n- Yeah, of course.\n\nSo we use a platform called FilmFreeway that allows filmmakers from around the world to submit their movies.\n\nAnd we had more than 300 films submitted this year from 41 countries.\n\nSo it's truly an international experience and an international festival.\n\nAnd we were able to look at all of those films with our juries.\n\nSo there are a number of categories in the festival doc feature, narrative feature, documentary, short, animated shorts, narrative shorts, students, experimental.\n\nIt's incredible to see all of the different pools of filmmaking that are happening right now.\n\nAnd so we have juries on each of those categories that look at those submissions, and then pick the very best films for us to play in the festival.\n\nSo yeah, we have to take the more than 300 we get, which is a lot of hours of watching, and then whittle it down to the hundred that you're gonna get to see at the Fargo Theater.\n\n- Yeah, when you say jury, how many people are on a jury?\n\n- Gosh, yeah.\n\nSo it depends on each category.\n\nSome of them can have up to 12 to 14, and then others, you know, are eight to 10.\n\nIt really depends on that category.\n\nAnd the cool thing is they're all volunteers from our community.\n\nSo our jury, our pool of volunteers is more than 70 people this year.\n\nSo we're really proud to have so many people involved in the festival that care about movies and they care about the Fargo Theater.\n\n- Yeah, can can you talk about the origins of the film festival?\n\nOf course, obviously it dates back to the year 2000.\n\nIt's easy enough, it's easy to keep up with your anniversary dates.\n\n- It is.\n\n- And then some of the meetings with organizers and of course Margie Bailey.\n\n- Yeah, of course.\n\nWell, you know, going back, it's a little bit before my time.\n\nMy first one that I was ever involved with was in 2009 and I went as an audience member in 2006, so I missed a couple of years of it.\n\nBut, you know, film festivals I think are a really important part of a city's kind of thriving arts sector.\n\nAnd so people like Rusty Castleton and Ted Larson and Margie Bailey looked around at other cities and said, hey, why do they have a film festival and we don't?\n\nAnd so the three of them spearheaded this initial event that had right around 30 movies, and it was two and a half days.\n\nAnd so now we're more than a hundred films playing over five days.\n\nSo you can see there's been a lot of growth since then.\n\nBut, you know, film festivals I think are a really important part of a Healthy City's ecosystem because it drives tourism and it brings so many interesting, diverse voices to a community.\n\n- Why do you think it's been so successful?\n\n- I think that people are eager to see different forms of entertainment than you can get just every day at the multiplex.\n\nAnd I think that's really, really exciting, because people want to see different stories.\n\nThey want to see something that if they weren't watching it with this audience at the Fargo Theater, they wouldn't see it otherwise.\n\nThat's one of the things I'm so proud about with the festival, is we're we're playing things that otherwise just wouldn't play in our region at all.\n\nAnd we get to, in some cases, premiere them and get to share them and sit with your friends and neighbors and laugh and cry and be shocked and scared.\n\nSometimes if it's a scary movie, it's the best feeling in the world to be in an audience at the theater watching a movie there.\n\n- Yeah, well, let's go back to the festival.\n\nCan you tell us about how many filmmakers, actors, and actresses are slated to attend?\n\nAnd can you talk about a few of them maybe?\n\n- Yes, we are really, really excited.\n\nThis year, we've got 45 people coming in from all over the country, so the major hubs New York and LA will be really represented.\n\nBut we have filmmakers that are truly, truly independent, making films exactly where they are and bringing those stories to us.\n\nAnd so we're excited each of our evening showcases.\n\nSo Tuesday through Saturday night, we'll have special guests there for Q & As.\n\nSo the thing that I love so much about the Fest is you get to come in, you watch a movie, and then you get to hear from the very people who made it, just on that stage in the Fargo Theater.\n\nAnd you get to be a part of that conversation, which I think is so special.\n\nWe've got everyone from Vivian Kerr who wrote and directed the film \"Scrap,\" to Will Greenfield, who is part of our Friday night showcase.\n\nHe just produced a film called \"Immaculate,\" and it's this new horror movie with Sydney Sweeney, who is a real up and coming star.\n\nShe was just on Saturday Night Live and she's on \"Anyone But You\" and \"Euphoria,\" and it's about a nun who, an American nun who moves to Italy and joins a rural convent.\n\nAnd while she's there, miraculously they find out she's pregnant.\n\nAnd it looks very spooky.\n\nI'm very excited for audiences to see it.\n\nBut Will is this really kind of extraordinary force in the film industry right now.\n\nHe started as a production assistant, has worked his way all the way up to producers for incredible people like Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee and Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\nAnd he just produced the last season of \"Euphoria\" on HBO.\n\nAnd so we're really honored to have him come and we'll be able to watch the movie together and then have a conversation with him on stage afterwards.\n\nSo we're having independent filmmakers come, and then we're having industry heavyweights like Will Greenfield.\n\nSo it's a really cool collection of people.\n\n- Yeah, it is.\n\nSounds like it.\n\nTalk about when do the film start screening every day?\n\n- Yeah, so on Tuesday opening day, March 19th, you can come starting at 1:30 in the afternoon, and then every day after that, we're not kidding you, we've got films morning, afternoon, and night.\n\nSo starting at 10 o'clock each day, you can come in.\n\nthere's a morning session, afternoon, and then our evening showcase each night.\n\n- So how do people?\n\nDo people have to buy tickets for the whole five days?\n\nOr can they come a day at a time?\n\n- Yeah, you know, you can truly curate whatever festival experience you want, whether you can come for just one session, or you wanna come for the whole shebang and see the whole thing, we've got a ticket or a pass for you.\n\nThe prices begin at $2 if you want to come for the two Minute Film Festival, the two minute movie contest, which is so, so cool, all the way up to $150, which gets you into every single movie and some exclusive parties with filmmakers that'll be coming.\n\n- Wait a minute.\n\nYou just mentioned the annual Two Minute movie contest.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Tell us about that.\n\n- This is one of my favorite events that happens each year.\n\nIt's on Thursday, March 21st this year, and it starts at 9:15.\n\nAnd it is such a cool thing.\n\nThe kind of rule and mandate for it is you have to tell a story start to finish in under 120 seconds.\n\nIt can be whatever genre you want, whatever form or mode of filmmaking you want.\n\nSo we'll have documentaries, we'll have pieces of animation, we'll these really kind of cool and quirky narrative films.\n\nBut the only rule is if you want to be in that block of filmmaking, it has to be under two minutes long.\n\nAnd it's incredible to see the things that we get from, not only around the country, but around the world and all the different voices of filmmakers who are successfully telling a story in such a short, kind of bite-sized amount of time.\n\n- Can you talk about the film screening on opening night, I guess.\n\nTell us about that.\n\n- So our opening night showcase this year is a documentary called \"Show Her the Money.\"\n\nAnd this is a fascinating and really empowering story, and it looks at women in the world of business and specifically venture capital.\n\nAnd the film starts with a really startling statistic that I knew nothing about, that in the world of venture capital, funding, 98% of it goes to men.\n\nOnly 2% of that goes to women entrepreneurs and inventors, which is crazy.\n\nSo this documentary follows four female entrepreneurs and female investors who are trying to change those statistics and make them look a little bit more like the world we live in today.\n\nSo we get to follow people that are starting their business or that are expanding their business and opening it up to the full market of India.\n\nSo it's this really inspiring piece of filmmaking that shows that no matter who you are or where you come from, given the right opportunity and given the right access to support and funding, that your product can find the people that it needs to.\n\nIt's a really, really wonderful film.\n\nAnd we've got four producers that are coming that are gonna take part in a panel afterwards.\n\nSo if you are interested at all in business or the business world, I think this is a fascinating conversation that you're really gonna wanna be there for.\n\n- And that's on the 19th, but then on the Wednesday, the March 20th.\n\n- [Sean] Yeah.\n\n- I understand you have a special guest representing the narrative feature winning film.\n\n- So our winner of best narrative feature this year is a film called \"Scrap.\"\n\nAnd it's this really moving family drama, well, I shouldn't say drama, it's a drama, it's a comedy, it's a romance.\n\nIt's really cool how she does all of this.\n\nAnd our special guest that night is writer director and star Vivian Kerr.\n\nSo she did all of these things.\n\nShe brought the film from page to screen and she stars in it herself.\n\nAnd it is about a woman who through some really unfortunate financial circumstances, has found herself unhoused and she's doing everything she can to hide that from her daughter and to hide that from her estranged family.\n\nSo you follow her as she's living in her car, trying to get her daughter to and from school, with a regular routine, and trying to get back up on her feet financially.\n\nIt's a really timely story and I think it's really beautifully acted.\n\nAnd it features Anthony Rapp from \"Rent\" and Lana Parilla from the ABC show \"Once Upon a Time.\"\n\nSo there are gonna be faces that you know from other media that you consume.\n\nSo it's a great film and you should really come out on Wednesday night to see it.\n\n- Well, you we're talking about all the nights, but not all of them because we've got so much going on, but let's talk about the final night, what's going on that night?\n\n- Yeah, that's really our Best in Fest showcase.\n\nSo all of the film screening that night are award winners and we'll have two special guests coming.\n\nJennifer LaFleur is a producer and actor who is coming with the film \"The Day Of.\"\n\nAnd it is a really harrowing and very chilling story.\n\nIt's a narrative short about a mother who receives a call from her daughter that suggests that every parent's worst nightmare is actually becoming a reality for her.\n\nIt is such a powerful film.\n\nIt's moving, it's a really, I think it'll really change people and really affect people.\n\nI'm excited to watch it with people and I'm excited to get to talk with her afterward.\n\nAnd then we also have the film \"Blue Hour,\" which is part of our student competition.\n\nAnd the film, the filmmaker, writer-director, JD Shields is coming.\n\nAnd this is about a photographer who gets a really unexpected request to do a photo shoot.\n\nAnd the photo shoot has these kind of life changing implications both for her as an artist, but also for the subject that she's filming.\n\nIt's again, a beautiful, very vulnerable piece of storytelling.\n\nAnd it's cool because these two films are such incredible, incredible pieces of filmmaking and we're gonna have the people that made them right here.\n\n- You mentioned volunteers earlier, but can you talk more about the importance of pretty much an all volunteer festival?\n\n- Yeah, you know, I think one thing that really does set us apart is that the festival is as much a part of the community as the Fargo theater itself.\n\nI think a lot of bigger festivals or festivals that you'll hear in other communities have staff that work across the country.\n\nBut we truly are based here in Fargo with people that you go to the grocery store with, that you work with, that you see every day.\n\nThey're involved picking these movies and they're finding things that they want to showcase that they want our community to be able to see.\n\nSo it's truly your friends, family, and neighbors that are putting this all together.\n\n- Can you tell us about some of your sponsors that help out?\n\n- Yeah, you know, we're really fortunate.\n\nWhether it's individual donors or our presenting sponsor, Bell Bank, who's been with us since the very, very beginning.\n\nWe are so fortunate to have the support of businesses and individuals across the community because like we said, the Fargo Theater is a nonprofit organization and the festival is our largest annual fundraiser.\n\nSo while other people will do galas and big parties to try and raise money, we really wanna lean into what we do artistically as an organization and showcase the very best of independent film.\n\n- You know, can you talk, because I understand this happens how film festivals help launch careers?\n\n- Yeah, you know, I think for emerging artists and for new filmmakers, whatever stage of your career you're in, going to a festival and having the opportunity, one, to see your movie on the big screen, two, to see your movie with an audience, but then three, to get to meet other filmmakers is a really cool and very unique experience.\n\nIt's exciting to see filmmakers kind of on the rise in their career and to see where they are and then where they go.\n\nWe had Mike Flanagan come back last year and he has gone on to create films and series for Netflix and Amazon and he came with his very first feature in 2010.\n\nSo it's this incredible journey to watch people kind of go on this rise.\n\nAnd, you know, film festivals are a really important part of that because it's where people can find audiences, they can find their community of filmmakers, but then at other festivals that are markets, they can also sell their movies, they can get seen by distributors and kind of launch them into a different stratosphere.\n\nIt's really cool.\n\n- Well, I guess Sean, people are interested.\n\nHow can they get tickets?\n\nHow can they find out more information?\n\n- Yeah, the best way to do that is to go to fargofilmfestival.com.\n\nYou can look at our entire program guide online now, or else you can click the tickets button and you can buy your tickets.\n\nAnd like I said, anything from $2 all the way up to $150.\n\nThere's a festival package that we can put together for you.\n\n- What about a one day ticket?\n\nDo you have that?\n\n- No, so you can curate whatever you want and there are sessions.\n\nYou could buy a morning session, afternoon session, or night session.\n\n- [John] Okay.\n\n- So you can come for the day, you can come for a session or come for the whole thing.\n\n- Well, it sounds great and of course we wish you the best of luck with all of it.\n\n- [Sean] Thank you.\n\n- And now we want to take a look at clips from the winning films of the 2024 Fargo Film Festival.\n\n(phone ringtone) - Beth Anderson.\n\n- [Taylor] Hi Beth, it's Taylor from Piper Brook.\n\n- Yes, of course.\n\nYou just caught me getting out of spin.\n\nHow are you?\n\n- [Taylor] I'm great, thank you.\n\nGwen wanted me to thank you for coming in.\n\n- Yes, of course, of course.\n\n- You need to leave now.\n\n- No problem at all.\n\n- [Taylor] Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to invite you to the next round of interviews.\n\n- Oh, okay.\n\nMay I ask why?\n\n- We're sick of people like you here?\n\n- [Taylor] I'm sorry, I can't disclose that.\n\n- Do whatever you need to do.\n\n- [Taylor] But we'll absolutely keep your resume on file.\n\nGwen loved you.\n\n- Excuse me for one moment.\n\n- I am on the phone.\n\nGive me two seconds, two seconds.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n- [Taylor] Have a great day.\n\n- I'm calling the police.\n\nNo drugs that I saw, but she's obviously homeless.\n\n- Excuse me.\n\n- I don't know if a prostitute or what?\n\n- How dare you?\n\n- [Man] Hey.\n\n(soft music) - My ex-wife is my neighbor, literally across the fence.\n\nShe misses me, I know this, you know how I know she misses me?\n\n'Cause she remarried a guy named Jeff.\n\n(people laughing) True story.\n\nShe even asked me to help plan her wedding.\n\n'Cause I officiate and I also, I have a little business, I do some wedding planning and stuff.\n\nI plan three on my own.\n\nI'm obviously an expert.\n\nBut that young lady at the age of 23 had to take her husband off of life support.\n\nThey had an argument about money and him buying his mom and dad's cows.\n\nAnd he put a gun to his head and he pulled the trigger in front of her at 23 years old.\n\nSo what do we need to do to change this?\n\nAnd then it dawned on me, I'm gonna have a nonprofit and it's gonna be called TUGS.\n\nTalking, Understanding, Growing, and Supporting.\n\n(soft music) - This is fake.\n\nIt's junk, worthless.\n\n- That's a diamond, a real, real diamond, - No, worthless junk.\n\n- It's easily worth 500 bucks.\n\n- Andrea, if diamond real, more than 500 bucks, tiny cut.\n\n- Fine then, 400 bucks.\n\nIt's a deal.\n\n- No deal, no buck, worthless.\n\n(speaking foreign language) - You're missing out.\n\n(soft music) - I become famous, they called Pizza on Fire and Flaming of Dough.\n\nMy left arm was like, you know, like hand, it was burning.\n\nThe one of the judge, you know, like she was screaming.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.\n\nHakki, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.\"\n\nShe was like just screaming, okay?\n\nAnd everybody was screaming.\n\n- You know, spin pizza blindfolded, and with pizzas on fire, in handcuffs.\n\nHe was really a showman.\n\n- I won like fastest, largest freestyle and of tasting, I believe.\n\nSo I won all four of them.\n\nI won the World Pizza Championship.\n\nI go floor and I cry.\n\nIt was very important to me to win that championship.\n\n(loud chants) - [Protestors] We are the people!\n\n- Press bitch.\n\n- We are the people, we are the people.\n\n- Mom, did you hurt yourself?\n\n- Just a little.\n\nWhy aren't you sleeping?\n\n- It's too hot.\n\n- Come here.\n\n- I want to go back to Belgrade.\n\n(soft music) (heavy breathing) (screaming) - [Narrator] I wait to see if the city will have its soul back once the worms are done with it.\n\nI wait for a sign that the planet itself will play a role in the future, or if that's being phased out, I wait to see if there's an aisle for people like me.\n\nI'm jealous of cows having diagrams, mapping their best cuts.\n\nI wait to see evidence of my spirit in others, of others feeling anywhere close to the way I do.\n\nMost importantly, I wait to find out what it'll be like a month from now when I'll have lived another month on Earth.\n\n- Well, that's all we have on Prairie Pulse for this week.\n\nAnd as always, thanks for watching.\n\n(soft music) - [Narrator] Funded by the members of Prairie Public."
