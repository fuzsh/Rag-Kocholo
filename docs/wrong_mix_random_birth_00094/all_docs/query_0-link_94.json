        "text": "Last fall, Sylvester Stallone called Andy Mitchell to offer the young Dallas private equity guy his Hollywood street smarts.\n\nMitchell and his business partner, Milos Brajovic, co-founders and co-presidents of Lantern Entertainment LP, had just bought Harvey Weinstein's company in a bankruptcy auction for $289 million, and the 72-year-old mastermind behind the iconic Rocky and Rambo films wanted to see if the 40-something newbies could use his expertise in navigating Movieland.\n\n“He said, ‘I’d like to talk with you and help you out. I know a lot about the business,’ ” recalls Mitchell over coffee recently in Highland Park Village. “And I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, I know your resume.’ ”\n\nMitchell, 43, and Brajovic, 47, are grateful for the free advice.\n\nTheir only previous experience with movies and TV shows was watching them.\n\nThe crown jewel of the defunct Weinstein Co. is a treasure trove library of 277 films that includes Academy Award winners The King's Speech and The Artist and the box-office hit Silver Linings Playbook.\n\n\"These are movies that everybody loves,\" Mitchell says as Brajovic [BRA-yo-wik] looks on. \"You might not like all of them. My kids [4 to 14] love Paddington Bear, but I don't let them watch the Quentin Tarantino movies — at least not yet.\"\n\nAgents, producers and studio execs in Tinseltown came out of the woodwork to share their expertise.\n\n“Milos and I were like, ‘Why do you want to sit down with us and talk?’ ” Mitchell says. “And they’d say, ‘Do you realize what you just did? You just bought one of the most valuable libraries in this town. You come from Texas. We’re all eager to know: Why’d you buy it? What are you going to do with it? And do you want to make more movies? It takes money to make movies, and apparently you guys have some of that.’ ”\n\nProblem-solvers\n\nIn less than a year, Mitchell and Brajovic have turned an unfinished movie, The Upside, into a box office hit by making it more family-friendly and recast TV reality show Project Runway to make it more reflective of the fuller-figured world.\n\nThey cleaned out Weinstein’s management team and formed a partnership with the former CEO of Metro Goldwyn Mayer to lead the entertainment company.\n\nAnd just recently, they brought in Warner Bros. Pictures, along with an international film distributor and the world’s second-largest cinema chain, as strategic investors to fast-track movies to market.\n\nLantern Entertainment was co-founded by Mitchell and Brajovic five years ago and is part of Lantern Capital Partners LP in The Crescent in Uptown Dallas.\n\nMitchell and Brajovic, who've spent nearly half of their lives doing private equity turnarounds, have gone about tackling this purchase just as they have countless deals they've worked on as workouts.\n\n“We are problem-solvers,” says Brajovic, who lives in New York but comes to Dallas routinely. The Weinstein Co. is \"one in a string of deals that we’ve been doing since 2014. That’s included shipping companies, commodity companies, recycling companies, car dealerships and resorts. What’s always the same is the process.”\n\n“We’re like Navy SEALs,” says Mitchell. “Whether they’re in Afghanistan or rescuing somebody from a hostage situation, they have that skill set that can adjust to different environments. It’s the same with us. We look to see if we can bring the right resources, the right people, the right experts.\n\n“You can’t be industry experts in everything. That’s our skill.”\n\nYin and yang\n\nMitchell, a Fort Worth native, and Serbian-born Brajovic have been doing deals together for 20 years — beginning in 1999 at Houlihan Lokey in Los Angeles.\n\nIn many ways, they are an unlikely pair.\n\n“He speaks four languages,” Mitchell says. “I’m fluent in Texan.”\n\nBrajovic came to the United States in 1984, when his mother received a Fulbright scholarship at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n“When I first came to the U.S., I was blown away at the abundance and the access of supermarkets — bread as much as you can buy and sodas in vending machines,\" he said.\n\nBrajovic earned his bachelor of science in finance and an MBA from New York University and a postgraduate degree in international affairs from the London School of Economics.\n\nMitchell earned his business degree in finance and accounting on a leadership scholarship at Texas Christian University, where he became student body president.\n\nAny hint of a twang was neutralized by a semester at Regents College in London. But he thoroughly enjoys playing Texan in La La Land.\n\nIn 1999, Mitchell was at PricewaterhouseCoopers working as a consultant for Waste Management’s division in Los Angeles.\n\nAt the urging of a friend, Mitchell set up what he thought was just a casual coffee with the head of Houlihan Lokey’s new restructuring group. It turned into an eight-hour marathon of a technical test and interviews that included lunch with Brajovic.\n\nMitchell left lunch thinking there’d been a misconnect.\n\nBrajovic left thinking he’d found a new team member.\n\nEric Winthrop, who was at the lunch and is still at Houlihan Lokey as managing director of its now-large restructuring legion, thought he’d just seen yin and yang come together.\n\nHe was right.\n\n“They get into some pretty heated debates,” says Winthrop, who remains close friends with both. “From an outside perspective, you might think, ‘Oh my God, what’s going on?’ But the way they challenge each other to get to the decisions they make works.\n\n“In a funny way, they get along perfectly.”\n\nDown and dirty\n\nIn late 2017, Brajovic got wind that Harvey Weinstein's company was for sale and thought they should look into it.\n\n“I’ll be honest, when Milos first called me about it, I said, ‘I think that might be the craziest thing I’ve ever heard,’ ” Mitchell recalls.\n\nPreliminary investigation in early 2018 confirmed that the company was a total mess.\n\n“The basics that we value — financial control, legal documentation, HR policies — were the worst that we’d ever seen,” Mitchell says. “It was a case study for MBAs of what not to do.\n\n“Milos convinced me, 'Andy, these movies deserve a better home. If we bring in the right capital and the right management team, we can really do something special here.’ ”\n\nPutting out fires\n\nThe Upside, starring Bryan Cranston, Kevin Hart and Nicole Kidman, and reality TV's Project Runway needed immediate crisis intervention.\n\n“Before we could do anything else, we had to put out two of the brightest, fastest-burning fires,” says Mitchell.\n\nShot in 2017, The Upside was an unreleased movie made by Weinstein before his career imploded into #MeToo oblivion. It was headed for an R-rating.\n\nAt the urging of the movie's distributor, Mitchell and Brajovic took out a stream of obscenities, toning down The Upside into a multigenerational PG-13 hit released on Jan. 11.\n\n“My parents love it. My kids love it,” says Mitchell, CEO of Lantern. “This is a movie where people cry and laugh multiple times. If you can do that, they will come back again and again. That’s what Hollywood needs to remember.”\n\nThe Upside captured Hollywood's attention by pulling in $108.2 million during its nearly four months in U.S. theaters, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks movie ticket sales. That's a surprise windfall.\n\nTrue to Hollywood form, theaters got about half of the ticket gross. STXfilms, which distributed and co-marketed the movie, took in 10 percent to 15 percent. Lantern’s ticket take was about $45 million, which covered the $37.5 million spent making the movie.\n\n“The guy who makes the movie keeps less than 50 cents,” Mitchell says of Lantern’s box-office revenue. “But theaters are expensive to maintain. It’s the cost of battle in Hollywood.”\n\nProfits will come in the movie’s second life, Mitchell says. “We’ll make a few million from the box-office release. But as soon as it left theaters, we started making the real money.”\n\nThe Upside is now in Lantern's library, where it will draw revenue and a tidy profit margin from contracts with network TV, DVD sales, in-flight airline deals, hotels, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Showtime, iTunes, DirectTV, HBO, et al.\n\nThat could amount to $100 million in gross revenue over the course of the next 10 years, if The Upside follows typical movie life-span trends.\n\nDethroning Barbie\n\nBrajovic and Mitchell feared that Project Runway's 17th season would suffer from Weinstein backlash.\n\nTo mitigate that, with the help of NBCUniversal Media, Mitchell and Brajovic revamped the search for the “next great American designer” with new judges, including Longview native and designer to the stars Brandon Maxwell, and added its first transgender model.\n\nThe unscripted show, which airs in Dallas on Bravo cable network at 8 p.m. Thursdays, seems to have skirted any Weinstein boycott.\n\n“Fashion has to embrace the full range of people who exist,” says Mitchell, whose daughters are 9 and 4. “The show has been criticized previously for being too Barbie. My wife and I love Dallas, but Dallas is kinda known for pressuring women into ‘You need to be in this mold.’ We worry about this for our girls.”\n\nMitchell and Brajovic didn’t anticipate devoting so much time and personal energy into finding new blood to run the entertainment company.\n\nAfter going through more than 100 candidates, they found their match with studio veteran Gary Barber and Spyglass Entertainment. He co-founded the film and television production company in 1998, but it had been dormant for the past decade while Barber took over as MGM chairman and CEO to guide the studio out of bankruptcy.\n\nIn March, Lantern announced a partnership with Barber in which Lantern Entertainment and Spyglass joined forces to become Spyglass Media Group under Lantern Capital’s umbrella. Barber now heads the entertainment business as CEO of Spyglass in Century City, Calif.\n\nBarber's addition is considered an industry coup. Among his accomplishments at MGM was revitalizing its James Bond franchise. Skyfall and Spectre became the highest-grossing Bond films of all time.\n\nBarber also greenlit — i.e., rounded up money for — several award-winning scripted drama series, including The Handmaid's Tale (Hulu), Fargo (FX) and Vikings (History).\n\n“Andy and Milos made for an ideal partnership,” Barber says from his California office. “They acquired a valuable, award-winning library of film and TV assets, development projects, franchises and IP. It made sense for us to join forces and build a new independent premium content company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures, film distributor Eagle Pictures and Cineworld Group, which owns Regal Entertainment Group and is the second-largest cinema chain in the world, signed on as strategic investors to help finance, produce and distribute content for Spyglass.\n\nAs part of its investment, Warner Bros. gets the first crack at Spyglass's projects.\n\n“We are well-positioned for global scale and to reach audiences worldwide,” Barber says.\n\nMitchell agrees. “With these strategic partnerships, we’ll be able to distribute more movies faster and cheaper.”\n\nHow many more?\n\n“A lot of major studios have to make 18 to 25 movies a year to cover their costs,” says Mitchell says.\n\n“We’ve set this up so that we can make four to 10 really good movies and still make money. If you don’t have a good enough script, you shouldn’t make that movie,\" he says.\n\n“Right now, we have a huge backlog of movies that need to be made, so we’re looking forward to getting to work.”\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nLantern Capital Partners LP\n\nFounded: 2014\n\nHeadquarters: 300 Crescent Court\n\nAssets under management: Nearly $2 billion\n\nAnnual revenue: An estimated $1.5-plus billion\n\nAndy Mitchell\n\nTitle: Co-founder and CEO, Lantern Capital Partners LLC\n\nAge: 43\n\nBorn and raised: Fort Worth\n\nResides: University Park\n\nEducation: BBA in finance and accounting, Texas Christian University, 1998\n\nPersonal: Married to Kristin.
