        "text": "Set in a Western Era the Film Hateful Eight is an action-packed mystery/comedy that really shows off well the time period which the movie is set in. Directing this film is Quentin Tarantino known for his over the top edgy but really great movies, just being him makes this movie better. I’m going to explain several tricks of cinematography that Quentin Tarantino used to make this film as great as it was.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven does its share to keep up that trend. Basically, the movie spends the whole time building up to the climatic and the epic fight between Chisolm, and Bogue. The fight does not disappoint in any way, shape or form either. It can feel a tad bit too violent, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Aside from the final fight scene, there are plenty of other action packed, and violent scenes to keep you interested like appetizers before the big feast. You could include the early scene where one of Rose Creek is brutally killed by one of Bogue’s henchmen with a tomahawk. It’s a scene that sets the tone for the violence that is to come. This movie isn’t as much about the depth of its story as it is about action and straddling the line of too much violence. It might be best described as one movie critic for Rolling Stone writes “It’s two hours of hardcore, shoot-em-up pow and it’s entertaining as hell.”\n\nI was never a movie guy up until I watched Pulp Fiction two years ago. I have only watched it like four to five time due to how long it is. Amazing movie still. The next movie on the list is director Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Like Pulp Fiction it is also pretty long movie, but because both movies were directed and acted wonderfully those three hours go by fast.Pulp Fiction is directed by Quentin Tarantino as well as another critically acclaimed movie Reservoir Dogs, that I have yet to see. Pulp Fiction takes place mostly in California where most of the movie two hitmen go retrieve a briefcase for their boss, shooting almost everyone they come into contact with. Aside from that, the beginning of the movie starts with diner heist if you believe it or not. This movie is has drug use, gunshots, brain matter, and diner heists, all the ingredients for a crime genre film . On the other side of the spectrum Pulp Fiction is listed a drama genre as well. Quentin adds drama brilliantly in one short scene where John Travolta character Vincent has to keep his boss’s wife named Mia, company while away. After Vincent and Mia, finish their dinner at a car themed restaurant go back to Mia’s place and Mia begins to to OD on Vincent’s heroin after snorting it like coke.\n\nShort films vary from feature films as they are generally short in length and not highly commercialised, expressing how more does not always denote better. This presents film directors with the freedom to address controversial topics and to not have to keep the interest of the audience for extended periods of time. This is effective in the manner that the genre can allow for the widening of personal choices for the director, despite the time frame. Vincent by Tim Burton explores the use of experimentation and controversy with a theme regarding the horrors of the mind, with no love interest and no stereotypical happy ending. 11'09\"01- September 11 (USA) by Sean Penn also presents such a theme, but rather looks at the contrast between an individual's\n\nSpielberg was born in Cincinnati on December 18th, 1946. His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother a concert pianist. Steven seemed to get the best elements from both of them. Spielberg had an early fascination with cinema and began making amateur films at a very young age. At 13, he won a local contest for his 40-minute film, Escape to Nowhere. Ironically, Steven was unable to get into a film school, so he\n\nBret Easton Ellis is one of the great American writers of our time. Some of his famous works include his debut novel, Less Than Zero (1985), and his opus, American Psycho (1991), which are household names for any literary or cinematic buff. Although the man behind the mask may not be identifiable by all, almost everybody knows the name Patrick Bateman, and recognizes the famous role played by actor Christian Bale. Although Ellis’ literary prose might lead you to believe he was a dedicated scholar, his extracurricular activities would definitely prove you wrong. He was actually known for partying, sex, and drugs, the hamartia of almost every human. That exact humanness shows itself in his style, which is harsh, honest, and borderline sordid.\n\nThere is no straightforward answer when one asks the question of: “What exactly makes a great director?”. The truth is that it can be an array of different factors, from the director having a distinctive or original way of shooting scene, to him or her having a well-written script. But what separates a great director from an iconic one, is how their films inspires not only the current, but also the new generation of filmmakers. The well-known Quentin Tarantino is one of those iconic directors. Born Quentin Jerome Tarantino on 27 March, 1963, he is arguably one of the most famous/influential modern directors of our generation to such an extent, that his name alone can sell a movie. Just as recognisable as his name, is his directing. Renowned"
