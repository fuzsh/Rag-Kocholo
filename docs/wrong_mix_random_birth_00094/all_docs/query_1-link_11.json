        "text": "The 1965 red Chevy in “Pulp Fiction” that Uma Thurman’s character nearly died in and which was stolen shortly after the film was released, has been recovered in Oakland.\n\nTMZ said the car was stolen from director Quentin Tarantino’s home and hasn’t been seen again until this week. Law enforcement sources told the website police arrested a man Tuesday suspected of stealing classic cars in Southern California. The ensuing investigation led to Oakland, where they found Tarantino’s car.\n\nThe suspect won’t face charges for the alleged theft of Tarantino’s car, as the statute of limitations has run out, TMZ said. There were no details as to where in Oakland the car was found.\n\nToo bad Vincent Vega is no longer alive, or he and Jules could have a little talk with Mr. Suspected Car Thief.\n\nSources told TMZ someone changed the VIN number on the car, but authorities have no doubt is the car used in the film.\n\nThe car plays a role in the scene in which Travolta’s Vincent Vega takes Uma Thurman’s Mia Wallace dancing. Later, after Mia has a drug overdose, Travolta crashes the car into the front of a friend, Lance (Eric Stoltz), hopinghis friend can save Mia’s life.\n\nTMZ Police have not been able to contact Tarantino yet to inform him the car has been found.\n\nTOM BROKAW DOESN’T LIKE LINDSAY LOHAN: Lindsay Lohan apparently ruined the annual White House Correspondent Dinner for Tom Brokaw, according to TMZ.\n\nThat’s really saying something. This guy has covered wars, political scandals, natural disasters, and just about every ugliness the world could throw out there, yet he gets really upset over Lindsay Lohan.\n\nThe legendary broadcaster blasted the dinner during an interview with Politico, saying he’ll never attend the event again. He also said the standards for the once-respected event have fallen so low, his daughter’s junior prom has more dignity.\n\nWell, to be fair, some junior proms have become a really big deal.\n\nLohan was a guest of Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren at last year’s dinner, where booze flows freely and a certain amount of Washington D.C. silliness ensues. If memory serves, Lohan didn’t dance on a table, or set someone on fire. So maybe Brokaw is just getting cranky in his old age.\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER MAY REGRET THIS: Justin Bieber may have violated rule No. 1 of the Tattoo Community.\n\nWell, the one after don’t share a needle with Pamela Anderson.\n\nNo, Bieber likely did what no sensible tattoo guy does by getting a tattoo of his girlfriend. Or, possibly even worse, his ex-girlfriend.\n\nThis comes after Bieber was allegedly seen last weekend in Norway playing tonsil hockey with off-again, on-again girlfriend Selena Gomez. Now, says Huffington Post, he’s been spotted with a new tattoo of an angel on his left wrist that looks suspiciously like Gomez. More specifically, it looks a lot like how she looked in a photo shoot last year for Elle magazine, reports said.\n\nIt’s a good thing Bieber will probably still have enough money for laser tattoo removal by the time he really regrets this.\n\nMIKE TYSON’S EX ATE HIS PIGEON: Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson said an ex-girlfriend ate his pet pigeon, according to People.com.\n\nHow ridiculous. That’s about as believable as a man biting another man’s ear off.\n\nSpeaking Thursday on WFAN’s Boomer & Carton show in New York, Tyson, who has raised pigeons since before his boxing career, said a hungry ex-girlfriend decided one of Tyson’s pigeons was dinner.\n\n“I was dating this young lady and she said, ‘I don’t know why you’re flying those damn birds, you should be eating them,'” Tyson, 46, told the hosts. “She happened to grab one — and she cooked one and proceeded to eat it. And I just couldn’t do it.”\n\n“It just wasn’t the right thing to do,” added Tyson, who happens to be a vegan (human ears aside). “It wasn’t cool. It was her house and we were living on her dime, so she could do (it).”\n\nIt may be weird, but one has to admit that Mike Tyson tells great stories.\n\nRetired from boxing, Tyson has taken his one-man show “Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth” — in which he shares details of his storied career and personal life — on the road. The show recently played ion San Francisco.\n\nContact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.\n\nAPRIL 27 IN HISTORY\n\nSaturday is April 27, the 117th day of 2013.
