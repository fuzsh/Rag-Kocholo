        "text": "Alba Molina was born into the lineage of flamenco Molina (guitar-players) and Montoya (singers and dancers). Her parents were the vanguardist flamenco couple Lole Montoya and Manuel Molina, known as Lole y Manuel and one of the most popular flamenco artists of the 70ties in Spain. (Internationally they got popular after Quentin Tarantino included their song “Tu Mirá” in Kill Bill Volume 2). Since very young Alba Molina has been performing flamenco, but also hip hop, pop rock, boleros, ballads, Brazilian music… She collaborated in “Las Niñas” (flamenco-hiphop) selling over 80.000 copies early 90ties and in “Tucara” from 2009 produced by Rycardo Moreno. Her last two albums have been homage to her parents “Alba canta a Lole y Manuel” (Universal, 2016) and “Caminando con Manuel” (Universal 2017).\n\nRycardo Moreno, is musical producer, arranger, composer and guitarist. He collaborates with the many different important flamenco artists and is actually also touring “ A Galeano” (his second album as artist), a tribute to the writer Eduardo Galeano.\n\nAlba Molina and Rycardo Moreno recorded together “Tucara” (2009) and since than they have playing all over Spain, in Belgrade (Serbia), Prague (Czech republic) and NY (USA). A delightful travel through Jazz and Flamenco standards but also beautiful compositions, an intimate concert full of subtle emotions."
