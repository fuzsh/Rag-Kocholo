        "text": "Joseph Julián González is a composer for award-winning Films, TV shows, stage productions and concerts. His music has been performed at Carnegie Hall, The Sydney Opera House, The Walt Disney Concert Hall and other prestigious venues. A 30-year Hollywood veteran, Gonzalez’ composing credits include the Academy Award-nominated feature documentary Colors Straight Up, the Emmy Award-winning Made In LA, and Showtime’s longest-running Latino series, Resurrection Blvd. He has also scored the Peabody Award winning 6-part miniseries Latino Americans. González recently conducted the Bulgarian National Radio Symphony Orchestra for the recording of his Imagen Award-winning score for the PBS landmark documentary Children of GIANT. Amongst the multitude of his musical scores for Film, he also co-composed the score to Quentin Tarantino’s, Curdled, with rock ’n’ roll legend Slash from Guns N’ Roses.\n\nGonzález studied counterpoint with Dr. Doug Davis and classical guitar with Theodore Norman at UCLA. While at UCLA, he studied composition for Motion Picture and Television under \"the grandfather of film music\" David Raksin (Laura, Modern Times). As part of the Sundance Film Composer Program, Gonzalez was chosen amongst thousands of applicants to participate in a three week, intensive, one-on-one composition study with John Adams (Nixon in China), Osvaldo Golijov (La Pasión según San Marcos), Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Finding Nemo), and Jeff Beal (House of Cards, Pollock). The late legendary Mexican opera composer, Daniel Catán (Il Postino, Florencia en el Amazonas) was also a dear friend and treasured mentor.\n\nHe has received musical commissions from Meet the Composer, The LA Philharmonic, The American Music Forum, The Rogue Valley Chorale, and the Kronos String Quartet. In 1997, González was commissioned to write his symphonic oratorio, Misa Azteca. This piece has inspired audiences worldwide at locations including the American Cathedral in Paris, the Sorbonne, the Sydney Opera House, the St. Denis Music Festival, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Vatican.\n\nMost recently, González was commissioned to write an opera for the tricentennial celebration of the founding of San Antonio, TX. Sueños de Béjar (Dreams of Béjar), gives an artistic portrayal of the city’s history from its legendary origin in the creek to the encounters between the indigenous peoples and the Spaniards. A half-hour preview was performed on September 8, 2016, and the full performance, led by German conductor Sebastian Lang-Lessing, will debut in 2021.\n\nGonzalez’ music has been performed by members of the LA Philharmonic, San Antonio Symphony, Seattle Symphony, Salt Lake Symphony, Jerusalem Symphony, Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra, the Belgrade Symphony amongst many others, as well as a multitude of choirs internationally over the last 30 years. His music has and continues to charm and inspire audiences worldwide."
