        "text": "After a period of stagnation, when rap and electronic music took over the primacy on the Montenegrin music scene, rock and roll seems to be reviving again, new interesting bands are appearing, such as Yonic, which has almost released its debut album, and as in that case, the audience will soon get to know the new line-up in which her names are already known.\n\nThe Budva rock group Haze & Ash, with their first songs released two years ago, drew attention to themselves and beyond the Montenegrin borders, established cooperation with more famous acts such as Stray Dogg, and although we have never heard of the announced studio debut of the group, it is the way for these musicians sent to found a new, interesting rock band Savana, composed of musicians from Montenegro and Serbia. From the aforementioned Haze & Ash, there are Budva's Andrej Lovrić and Dario Vuksanović on guitars, guitarist Aleksa Majstorović (The Filters and Stepa) and Aleksa Nedic, bassist and singer of one of the most interesting young bands on the Serbian alternative rock scene Vizelj, while the guest drummer is Andrej Mladenović from Stray Dogg.\n\nVuksanović revealed to \"Vijesti\" that Savana was born spontaneously, after an evening out in the city, around this time last year, and now she is ready to appear in front of the audience, with the first single called \"Vitalne sustanite\", which they announced for May 14. .\n\nThe rocker from Budva describes the sound of his group as desert rock characteristic of Queens of the Stone Age, but in our language. Savana has already recorded four songs that will be released every couple of weeks in the coming period, and Stray Dogg frontman Dukat Strajnić and drummer Artan Lili Marko Ajković helped in their creation.\n\n\"We were planning some other songs to release first, but this corona crisis disrupted our plans to shoot the video. However, the first single will be accompanied by an excellent animation, for which we thank Petar Micić\", said Vuksanović. He pointed out that Savana's songs will be quite colorful, inspired by the American stoner scene and packaged in a pop form, but also connected by common motifs, electronics and the influences of Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThe four tracks they are preparing for release will be only the first phase, there will be a break until the fall, then a second tour of three songs that will serve as an introduction to the debut album \"Tarangira\", which will contain a dozen compositions.\n\n\"We have two videos for this round of songs, in the second round we aim to do three more\", Vuksanović announced and added that the performances will start with that, as Savana has not yet performed live to the audience.\n\n\"We had plans to perform, but this pandemic and everything surrounding it has now postponed those things a bit. It is interesting that despite the fact that half of the members are in Belgrade and half in Budva, this corona crisis seems to have accelerated studio work and people's engagement in general\", the guitarist noted.\n\nThe fact that the band members come from two different countries, two cities more than 500 kilometers apart, can bring logistical challenges, but Vuksanović also sees positives in this.\n\n\"I believe that the fact that both Serbian and Montenegrin audiences know us as musicians is certainly a plus, but I also think that there are no rules. If the music doesn't have something that makes people want to play your song at home, then nothing helps. We'll see how things go, but we believe there will be positive reactions,\" the rocker concluded."
