        "text": "An occasional series where I watch and review works inspired by Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula…\n\nThese reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nFaithful to the novel? Based on the Marvel character of the same name, who had only debuted in the comic books a couple of years earlier, animated TV series Spider-Woman follows magazine editor Jessica Drew, who tackles a variety of villains and monsters using an arachnid alter ego.\n\nIn lieu of an introductory episode, we’re told the backstory during each week’s opening titles. When Jessica was a child, she was bitten by a venomous spider, so her scientist father injected her with an experimental antidote (‘spider serum #34’), which saved her life but also gave her superhuman abilities… While ‘weaving her web of justice’, Jessica (now an adult voiced by Joan Van Ark, later of Dallas and Knots Landing) can fly, thanks to web-wings on her red-and-yellow spider-suit, as well as stick to walls and ceilings and shoot ‘venom blasts’ out of her hands. When not in her superhero persona, she’s a hotshot editor who runs Justice Magazine; her closest friends are photographer Jeff Hunt (Bruce Miller) and her young nephew Billy (Bryan Scott).\n\nThe show’s connection to Dracula comes in the 10th episode, Dracula’s Revenge, which was originally broadcast on 24 November 1979. In a spooky graveyard, two grave robbers resurrect the vampire Count Dracula who has been entombed for 500 years. He is very much the Dracula cliche: Romanian accent, fangs, goatie board, red-lined cape, the ability to turn into a bat. Before he was defeated five centuries earlier, the Count put a curse on the family of his rival Van Helsing, and now he’s back he seeks out the rival’s descendent – who bizarrely lives in Castle Dracula – so he can turn him and his friends into vampires.\n\nThankfully, Jessica somehow intuits the danger – even though she’s several thousand miles away – and heads over to Europe with Jeff and Billy in tow. Dracula, meanwhile, also resurrects two allies: the Wolf Man and a very Boris Karloff-like Frankenstein’s Monster. Jeff and Billy are soon turned into monsters, and then Spider-Woman begins to metamorphose into a half-vampire, half-wolf hybrid. But thankfully she’s able to do some quick library research into the creatures and, one-by-one, squash the threats.\n\nSetting: The modern day (late 1970s). Jessica and her pals live in an unnamed US city, presumably New York, and we see them attending a local cinema to catch a horror film. But the bulk of the action takes place in Romania. Jessica travels there at first via her superhero ability to fly, but when she has to return later accompanied by Jeff and Brian they use the Justice jet-copter.\n\nBest bit: Given that Spider-Woman was a children’s show, the way Count Dracula converts victims into the Undead had to be changed, of course. So rather than seduce people and drain their blood, this version of the character shoots green laser beams out of his hands and this somehow results in them becoming vampires. No sex please, we’re a kids cartoon.\n\nReview: Created for television by genre legend Stan Lee, the animated series Spider-Woman only ran for 16 episodes. In that time the lead characters encounter a myriad of flamboyant threats – a resurrected Egyptian Mummy, a demon, time-travelling Vikings, urban criminals, dinosaurs, a giant spider, androids, aliens – but neither Jeff nor Billy ever learn that Jessica is a superhero. In the standard format of these things, they just don’t spot that Jess goes missing as soon as Spider-Woman swings into view. (Dracula’s Revenge actually contains a sly joke about this: Jessica is forced to switch into her Spider costume in a phone box – a deliberate nod to fellow hero Superman. ‘Well, it’s not exactly my style,’ she says to herself, ‘but it’ll have to do.’)\n\nIt all makes for a diverting adventure series that features some whimsical threats and doesn’t outstay its welcome. The use of Dracula is part of a long tradition of the vampire count cropping up in cartoons for children – see also Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, Scooby-Doo, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and more – and while the drama of the situation never approaches anything too complex, the writers have fun hinting towards the cliches. But the series’ most appealing aspect is the fact Spider-Woman is a quietly progressive cartoon series. For one thing, it was the first animated superhero show to focus on a female character; for another, Jessica is a successful professional who doesn’t bat her eyelashes at any of the male characters. Maybe that’s what riles the famously misogynistic Dracula the most.\n\nSix monster pictures (they give me nightmares) out of 10\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nThis film starts with a boastful credit: ‘Universal presents BASIL RATHBONE, BORIS KARLOFF, BELA LUGOSI in…’ That’s quite a cast. Sherlock Holmes, Frankenstein’s monster and Count Dracula, all brought together. The Invisible Man‘s Claude Rains and Hungarian star Peter Lorre were also in the running for Rathbone’s part. But the studio bosses were right to promote the talent at their disposal. Their horror-movie sequence was now well established – and about to become something of an assembly line. Son of Frankenstein is the first of an astonishing *15* Universal Monsters films released within just six years.\n\nWhereas the earlier Frankenstein movies had taken place in a nebulous, fin de siècle, mid-European hinterland, events have now moved on. We’re in the modern day, albeit one that never references the outside world, and Colin Clive’s Henry Frankenstein is long dead. As the story begins, Henry’s grown-up son Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Rathbone) returns to the town named after his family. With the help of a local blacksmith called Ygor (Lugosi), who has a crooked neck from a failed hanging, Wolf realises he can rebuild the Frankensteins’ reputation by resurrecting his father’s famed Creature (Karloff) and proving the experiment was justified…\n\nThere’s some placeholder dialogue and this is the longest film in the series so far, so it’s not as punchy as we’ve been used to. But there’s fun in the details. For example, local police chief Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) has a surreal tic: a fake arm, which he manipulates with the other to salute or hold his monocle. We learn that his real arm was torn off by the Creature when Krogh was a child, adding a backstory and a personal connection; the character and his disability were spoofed in 1974 comedy film Young Frankenstein. Director Roland V Lee also dips into the same expressionist toolbox that enthused James Whale earlier in the series, keeping things visually interesting with Brugelesque peasants, enormous and theatrical sets, artful shadows and rainy exteriors. (Lee considered shooting in colour but a test of the Creature make-up was not successful.) The film may lack Whale’s subversive wit but is nevertheless atmospheric and enjoyable.\n\nSeven faiths, beliefs and unfoldments out of 10\n\nNext: The Invisible Man… returns!\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nThe plot of this delayed sequel to the Bela Lugosi-starring Dracula is sometimes said to be based on Bram Stoker’s short story Dracula’s Guest. However, the resulting film shows precious little connection to this prose source, which may or may not have originally been a chapter of Stoker’s most famous novel. (Draculaologists have spent a century debating this point. It seems probable that Stoker cut out the section early in his seven-year writing process. His widow then published the ‘deleted scene’ as a self-contained short story after Bram’s death.) Whatever the provenance, Dracula’s Daughter stands as an enjoyable film in its own right.\n\nSurprisingly, given how impressive the finished movie is, there was chaos during pre-production. Versions of the script were junked, numerous writers took stabs at new drafts, cast members were replaced, and directors were switched. James Whale – fresh off the success of Bride of Frankenstein – originally agreed to direct what would have been his fourth Universal horror, but then got distracted by more high-end projects. In the event, with the studio’s option on the Dracula rights running out, the gig was given to a journeyman called Lambert Hillyer. In the following decade, he would direct the first on-screen version of Batman (a 15-part cinema serial), but arguably Dracula’s Daughter has had a more lasting influence on popular culture.\n\nUsing a line of thinking that was later repeated by Hammer Films in the late 1950s, Universal figured that Count Dracula himself couldn’t appear in this sequel because he’d died in the first movie. (The notion of supernatural resurrection would come later.) But the vampire’s corpse does appear briefly as Van Helsing (a returning Edward Van Sloan) recaps the events of the 1931 film for the police. Rather oddly, other major characters such as Mina and John are neither seen nor mentioned. The focus then moves to a new lead…\n\nFirst appearing with only her sad, expressive eyes visible above a scarf, the vampire Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden) is the previously unmentioned daughter of Count Dracula. She steals her father’s body and burns it, hoping that this ritual will release her from her own demonic curse. The plan fails, meaning she must continue feeding on innocent victims, but Zaleska still wants to change. So, aided by her lugubrious lackey Sandor (Irving Pichel), she seeks assistance from a psychiatrist. This offbeat twist for a mass-market horror flick actually has a historical resonance: Sigmund Freud was developing the concept of psychoanalysis at the same time that Bram Stoker was publishing Dracula, and many commentators have read Freudian implications in the novel. After all, Freud claimed that there are two dominating impulses behind human behaviour, which other psychoanalysts later dubbed Eros (the drive for life, love, sex, self-satisfaction) and Thanatos (aggression, destruction, violence, death). The entire vampire trope is built upon this combination of sex and death.\n\nBut the psychiatrist featured in Dracula’s Daughter is no stuffy, self-important Austrian who talks about cigars, anal fixations and the Oedipal complex. A personification of 1930s swagger and debonair detachment, Dr Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger) is seen first on a golfing holiday. We also meet his assistant, an American woman called Janet Blake (Marguerite Churchill), and together this flirty pair feel like they’ve been drafted in from a screwball comedy. The contrast shouldn’t work – a Gothic horror playing against a romcom – but it does. Brilliantly. Both sides of the story benefit from the charms of the other.\n\nShot more conventionally than Tod Browning’s original movie, Dracula’s Daughter is nevertheless a finer, more confident piece of filmmaking. An effectively creepy tone hangs over the Countess’s scenes, while secondary characters are well-cast, notably Nan Grey as a young woman targeted by Zaleska. Decorated by some effective incidental music and a few moments of humour, the story rolls along very enjoyably, and Zaleska – cinema’s first sympathetic vampire – is a fascinating character, bringing a huge amount of melancholia to the Universal series. (The actress thought the movie was tripe. You’d never know that from her soulful performance.) There’s also undoubtedly a sapphic subtext at play here, which was made explicit in a little-seen but fascinating quasi-remake called Nadja (1994).\n\nEight long shadows on the hillsides out of 10\n\nNext: After the daughter of Dracula, meet the son of Frankenstein!\n\nPrevious review: I appraised this film as part of my Dracula blogging project in 2017.\n\nFor a review of Nadja, click here.\n\nTo celebrate a decade of this blogging nonsense – my first review was published on 2 April 2014 – here is a list of my 100 favourite films.\n\nThe lengthy process to whittle down several hundred contenders was obviously a flawed exercise – totally subjective, unashamedly biased, occasionally based on transitory whims, and somewhat narrow (most movies are American, almost every director is male). I should also point out that these choices are guided by the word ‘favourite’, rather than me worrying about any ‘objective’ greatness or a cinematic canon. They’re just the films I like the most.\n\nSo for better or worse, agreement or ridicule, here is what I’ve chosen…\n\n100-51\n\nThe list is too unwieldy for a full ranking, so let’s start with the movies that fill the bottom half of the hundred, listed alphabetically, then we’ll dive into a top 50…\n\nThe Abyss (1989, James Cameron; above), The Aeronauts (2019, Tom Harper), A.I.

Or included something you think is awful?\n\nLet me know in the comments section below…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nA powerful warrior called Teth-Adam is unleashed after 5,000 years of mystical imprisonment and begins to wield his unique form of justice – so a team of superheroes is sent to stop him…\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us that, over time, entropy will grow in any self-contained system. In other words, the longer something continues without new impetus, the more it will break down, collapse, fall apart. Metal rusts, organic matter decays, stars burn out. One of the most mind-blowing implications of this is that because the universe itself is a closed system, it too will one day simply stop working. All the activity, energy and dynamic work will even out – a total equilibrium across all of space, which will mean that *nothing* will be able to happen any more. Cosmologists estimate that this will take a while. Perhaps 1.7×10106 years (that’s 1.7 followed by 106 zeroes).\n\nSuperhero movies, however, have taken far less time to reach a stage of flat, listless inertia. After the peak of production and confidence in the days before Covid, the genre has tailed off alarmingly in the 2020s with multiple flops, false starts, fuck-ups and even the shelving of a near-complete movie for tax reasons. And leading the charge into oblivion is Black Adam, which is the 12th entry in the insipid DC Extended Universe series and a quantifiably awful endeavour.\n\nA prologue set in the distant past (‘Before the pyramids,’ a voiceover vagues) tells us the backstory. A young boy in the Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq rebelled against the slavers and, because he accidentally found a chunk of a precious raw material called Eternium, was able to start an uprising. Soon after this, a powerful being dubbed Teth-Adam emerged from the revolution – a folk hero for Kahndaqis for generations to come… We then cut to the modern day. Kahndaq is now run by an organised-crime outfit called Intergang; in an obvious comment on imperialism, they all seem to be thugs with dodgy English accents. Fighting the fight for the oppressed are teenage skateboarder Amon (Bodhi Sabongui) and his archeologist mother, Adrianna (Sarah Shahi). She’s one of those female characters you get in action films who’s strong and tough and independent, so therefore – for some reason – must also be charmless, humourless and lumbered with clunky dialogue such as, ‘I gave up my job at the university and moved four times.’ Her only personality trait is ‘being angry about things’, and Shahi adds absolutely nothing to what’s on the page.\n\nAfter the kind of haphazard archeology that would make Channel 4’s Time Team wince, Adrianna manages to find and reanimate the ancient hero Teth-Adam (now played by Dwayne Johnson) who’s been interred in a set from Tomb Raider for several centuries. He’s an all-powerful, atavistic meta-human, an unstoppable weapon of mass destruction who’s introduced via a burst of the Rolling Stones classic Paint It Black. In a case of have-your-basbousa-and-eat-it, the script tries to position Teth-Adam as a noble figure, defending his country against the Western oppressors… but it can’t help also childishly revelling in him killing and causing indiscriminate carnage. (The character smashes through walls rather than use the nearby door, which does little to convince us of his intelligence.)\n\nThe American authorities are soon worried about the threat of this new murder-machine, so decide to send in a team of superheroes to contain him. But we don’t get the Justice League, we get the Justice *Society*, a second-division team of comic-book also-rans. And rather than establish or embellish these characters properly, the storytelling resorts with leaden laziness to a scene of their leader explaining who they are to his boss, franchise regular Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, appearing on a videoscreen and trying to hide the fact she shot all her stuff in about half an hour).\n\nLong-time fans of the rival Marvel superhero films will find no surprises as Carter Hall (Aldis Hodge) reels off his exposition. He tells Waller that his team includes Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), who’s DC’s clone of Ant-Man (except he can only grow big, rather than small)… Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), who is DC’s version of X-Men favourite Storm (both can control the wind)… and Doctor Fate (a bemused-looking Pierce Brosnan), who can predict the future, kinda like Marvel’s Doctor Strange. Hall himself, who lives in a mansion eerily like Professor X’s in the X-Men movies, uses the superhero persona Hawkman, who is risibly reminiscent of Marvel hero Falcon. There should be some fun here: some sense of a team bonding or already in full swing, some sense that these characters have lives outside of their superhero costumes. Instead, all we get are a few lightly scattered references that mean nothing to viewers who haven’t read the comics – Henry Winkler cameos as Atom Smasher’s uncle, for example, which will generate a knowing ‘Ahh!’ from connoisseurs but an Alan Partridge shrug from everyone else.\n\nWe’re just never given any reason to care about anything – not about Adrianna or Amon, not about Teth-Adam, not about the Justice Society, not about Kahndaq at large. This is a script, for example, where Cyclone’s entire personality and backstory is summed up with one infamously ghastly line of dialogue: ‘The nanobots were injected into my bloodstream by this really messed-up scientist who kidnapped me when I was 15.’ Actor Quintessa Swindell somehow manages to lever this drivel off the page without melting into a pool of embarrassment.\n\nIt’s all utterly feckless, it really is. The character development would embarrass a nursery rhyme. The plot is MacGuffin-based nonsense – there’s talk of the Crown of Sabbac, which has been infused with the power of ‘the six demons of the ancient world’ – and the script bandies about words such as ‘prophecy’ rather than reach for any complex storytelling. There are flurries of senseless action, explosions, fireballs and Zack Snyder-style slo-mo. Comedy is dropped into proceedings with the finesse of a waiter plonking a hammer into your bowl of soup. The quality of CGI suggests that the designers spend too much time playing videogames rather than understanding how real objects move in space. And a smug reference to The Good, the Bad & the Ugly misunderstands the entire point of that classic film.\n\nBlack Adam is essentially a spin-off from 2019’s Shazam! (Teth-Adam appeared very briefly in that earlier film, while Djimon Hounsou reprises his wizard character here in a cameo). But whereas Shazam! featured some silliness, some pathos and a sense of telling a story, Black Adam is the inverse of entertainment: a movie that seems like it’s being provocative in its sheer determination to be mediocre. It was a passion project for star Dwayne Johnson, who was a producer and had been attached through many, many years of development. However, whereas he’s often a likeable movie presence (Fast Five, Jungle Cruise), here he’s drearily, dogmatically boring. The Rock has as much charm as granite. The movie deserves to be buried under a mountain.\n\nOne neo-imperialist enforcer from halfway around the world sent here to steal my country’s natural resources, strip-mine our sacred lands, pollute our waters, oppress our heritage and make us wait in line all day out of 10\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nDirector James Whale initially resisted calls to make a follow-up to his 1931 hit Frankenstein, fearful of going over old ground and keen to move on to more prestigious projects. But when his arm was sufficiently twisted, he ended up producing a masterpiece – a stylish, smart and thrilling concoction of high horror and high camp, which stands as one of the genre’s greatest ever films.\n\nImmediately after the mill fire that climaxed the 1931 movie, we learn that the assembled-from-corpse-parts Creature (Boris Karloff, dialling up the sympathetic quota even more this time) has survived. So too has his creator, Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive, in one of his final roles before alcoholism got the better of him). Soon, a strange and unnerving new character called Dr Pretorius arrives. He’s a former tutor of Henry’s and is played by the wonderfully effete Ernest Thesiger, an old friend of Whale’s. (The studio had wanted future star Claude Rains.) Pretorius is a far more amoral character – ‘To a new world of gods and monsters,’ he toasts gleefully in a shot destined for pop-culture immortality. He also carries around his own life-form experiments in small glass jars: miniature people, marvellously filmed via trick photography.\n\nIn order to further push the ethical boundaries, Pretorius blackmails Henry into building a female creature as a companion for the original. The result is played by British actress Elsa Lanchester. Topped by a Nefertiti-inspired hairdo that became often spoofed, the Bride is one of horror cinema’s most recognisable icons. It’s slightly surprising, then, that she actually only appears in the film’s final four minutes. (Lanchester had popped up earlier, though. She also plays author Mary Shelley in a meta prologue intended to set up the Gothic vibe of the story.)\n\nElsewhere, there’s true surrealism and theatricality in the way exteriors are achieved on interior sets, such as the dramatic backdrops of brooding clouds creating oppression in the graveyard scenes. In fact, the art direction constantly pushes things into heightened territory, while John J Mescall’s high-contrast, shadow-heavy lighting is extraordinarily artful, taking the tropes of German Expressionism and pointing the way towards film noir. This is not the real world – it’s ambiguous when and where the events are taking place, for example – but a fairy-tale land of burgomasters and peasants and barons and castles, all blended with humour, pathos and the-Creature-as-Christ parallels.\n\nSeveral decades later, the production of this movie was dramatised in a superb 1998 film called Gods and Monsters, in which we hear Whale (played by Ian McKellen) refers to Bride of Frankenstein as ‘a comedy about death… the trick is not to spoil it for anyone who’s not in on the joke.’ This sly line of dialogue illuminates Bride brilliantly. Neither a relentless horror nor a tongue-in-cheek comedy, the movie expertly combines both. The effect is both bewitching and dazzling.\n\nTen audiences need something stronger than a pretty little love story (so, why shouldn’t I write of monsters?) out of 10\n\nNext: Dracula is dead, long live his daughter…\n\nAn occasional series where I write about works inspired by Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula…\n\nThese reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nFaithful to the novel? No, this is not a traditional adaptation. We begin at a support-group meeting being held in a sports hall in present-day Louisiana. DRAAG (Dependant Relationships Anonymous Addiction Group) is run by Mark (Ghosts’ Brandon Scott Jones), and most of his clients discuss the ‘monsters’ in their lives – abusive boyfriends and the like. But while they’re talking figuratively, former real-estate lawyer Robert Montague Renfield (Nicholas Hoult) means it. His problem is his boss: the vampire Count Dracula (Nicolas Cage).\n\nDracula is a centuries-old aristocrat – the Prince of Wallachia, in fact, just like the real-world Vlad the Impaler – and has pale skin, fangs and slicked-back black hair. He’s fond of red capes, top hats and canes; he has enormous strength and powers of hypnotism; he can levitate and morph into a colony of bats. Renfield is the Count’s ‘familiar’, a never-ageing, once-mortal man who is now in his thrall and acts as his factotum. After Dracula is burnt to a crisp during an encounter with a vampire hunter, he needs a place to lie low while he regenerates his body, so the pair hole up in an abandoned hospital in New Orleans. But Renfield’s been feeling increasingly put-upon and undervalued, hence his decision to sign up for a victims’ support group…\n\nMeanwhile, we also meet Rebecca Quincy (a terrific Awkwafina). She’s a lowly New Orleans cop who’s bored with menial tasks such a spot DUI checks: ‘[It’s] just frustrating being on this shit detail when there’s real crimes happening out there,’ she moans. However, Rebecca’s life becomes more exciting when she crosses paths with notorious drug-dealer Tedward Lobo (The Afterparty’s Ben Schwartz) and arrests him with his arms full of cocaine. He’s a member of the family that killed her cop dad, adding extra juice to the situation. Her pursuit of Lobo also leads to an encounter with Renfield, and the pair quickly form a bond – a connection built more on mutual understanding and respect than traditional movie romance.\n\nSpurred on by his new surroundings, his new friend, and the guidance of DRAAG, Renfield then decides to leave Dracula’s employ. He gets himself a new apartment and undergoes a personal makeover – all done as a romcom montage. Things look rosy. However, Dracula, the mobsters and a corrupt cabal within the police force all have other ideas…\n\nSetting: Modern-day New Orleans. We also see flashbacks to Dracula and Renfield a century earlier in Transylvania and London, and an encounter with a bishop and a crossbow-wielding vampire hunter (Miles Doleac). The latter is possibly a take on the book character Van Helsing that’s been influenced by the 2004 Hugh Jackman movie.\n\nBest performance: In the original novel, RN Renfield (we never learn what his initials stand for) is an inmate at Dr Seward’s asylum, a troubled man of mood swings and unpredictable behaviour. He has an obsession with eating insects because he believes this will give him great power – he eventually forms a plan to feed flies to spiders, then the spiders to birds, so he can eat the birds and profit from the accumulated ‘life energy’. (The real-world condition of being obsessed with drinking blood, clinical vampirism, is sometimes called Renfield’s syndrome. The name was coined sarcastically by the psychologist Richard Noll in the 1980s.) But unbeknownst to Seward, Count Dracula targets Renfield and offers him immortality in exchange for devotion – the vampire’s ultimate aim is to use Renfield to get closer to the women in Seward’s life.\n\nThe character has had a potted history in film and TV adaptations, being played by a host of actors including Alexander Granach (1922), Dwight Frye (1931), Jack Shepherd (1977), Roland Topor (1979), Tom Waits (1992), Nonso Anozie (2013) and Mark Gatiss (2020) – yet most of these versions twist the character away from the novel’s interpretation. Sometimes he takes Jonathan Harker’s role in the narrative; sometimes he’s met Count Dracula before the story begins. Sometimes he’s a working-class ruffian; sometimes he’s an effete solicitor. Sometimes he’s dimwitted; sometimes he’s educated. Like all the elements in Stoker’s story, Renfield has become a malleable commodity, prime for filmmakers to bend to their purpose.\n\nIn the 2023 movie we’re reviewing here, Renfield is played by British actor Nicholas Hoult. This version of the character has superhuman strength, which he gains from eating insects like Tic Tacs, but he’s mostly able to pass for an everyman. We believe him as a lonely, desperate guy who seeks help from a support group and feel for his plight, even when he considers murdering a bus full of cheerleaders to appease his boss. Hoult knows how to pitch the tone so well, making his Renfield semi-comedic (the frustrated voiceover, the panicked expressions) but never losing our sympathy. His chemistry with co-star Awkwafina is also enjoyable.\n\nBest bit: Clips from the 1931 film version of Dracula have been repurposed here to show us the Count and Renfield’s backstory. Sly special effects have been used to drop Nicolas Cage and Nicholas Hoult into the 90-year-old footage, replacing original actors Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye, and Hoult has especial fun aping Frye’s manic performance.\n\nReview: Casting a live wire like Nicolas Cage as Count Dracula is an appealing prospect, and he hams it up enjoyably with a theatrical English accent and not one single toe in reality. (The movie wisely limits his screentime so he doesn’t start to feel overused.) Cage also brings with him a host of Dracula associations. He saw the silent-film masterpiece Nosferatu when he was five years old and modelled some of his vampire on Max Schreck’s extraordinary interpretation from 1922. He starred in 1989 comedy film Vampire’s Kiss, while his brother Christopher Coppola directed a fun slice of shlock in the 80s called Dracula’s Widow and their uncle Francis Ford Coppola directed a famous 1992 adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel. Additionally, and tongue-in-cheek-ily, Cage once had to deny accusations that he himself was a vampire when a man on eBay tried selling an 1880s photograph of a man with a vague similarity to the star.\n\nBut as attention-grabbing and fun as Cage’s contribution is, the movie actually succeeds more elsewhere. Renfield works as a raucous, R-rated splatterfest, full of gleeful violence, flamboyant blood splurts, decapitations, crazy shootouts, faces being ripped off, and limbs being ripped off and used as weapons. It’s a funny, punchy film that hums with relentless energy. And it plays as a kind of superhero spoof as we learn about Renfield’s ‘origin story’ and follow him as he struggles to deal with his powers. But most impressively, director Chris McKay (The Lego Batman Movie, The Tomorrow War) balances all this wackiness with just enough pathos to keep us caring about the characters.\n\nThe project was initiated by The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman, who wanted to attack the Dracula story from a fresh angle – and by focusing on Renfield, the creative team do just that. Stoker’s Renfield is a victim, a passive man manipulated into serving a vampire and betraying the humans who are trying to help him. Nicholas Hoult’s version honours that idea, at least to be begin with – it’s a toxic co-dependancy metaphor, with Dracula as the selfish, controlling half of the relationship and Renfield the oppressed spouse. But as Renfield finds his voice, he grows, he develops and we like him more and more. If not every story beat lands – there’s a clunky mention of Renfield’s wife and child, Rebecca has a sister who’s nothing more than a plot device – the gags, the violence, the performances and the overall sense of Grand Guignol silliness more than make up for it.\n\nEight oversimplifications of ska’s innovative contributions to music out of 10\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nHG Wells’s novel The Invisible Man had been published in 1897 – the same year as Dracula – but Wells was still around in the early 1930s when Frankenstein director James Whale was tasked with this film adaptation. Luckily, Wells enjoyed the result – and it’s easy to see why.\n\nJack Griffin is a scientist on the run after an experiment went wrong. His body is now totally invisible so he must hide behind clothes, hats, goggles and bandages while he plots how to use his unique situation to his selfish benefit. (This is therefore the second Universal Monsters film in a row with a central character wrapped up in bandages.) Cast as Jack was the London theatre actor Claude Rains. Frankenstein star Colin Clive was initially considered, which makes sense: like Clive’s Henry Frankenstein, Jack is a man ‘playing God’, dabbling in the margins of acceptable science and being driven mad by the untamed consequences. But Griffin is more of an out-and-out villain: a raving, deluded, manipulative murderer. Rains uses his syrupy sinister voice (a result of being gassed in the Great War) to create a memorable character on the edge of lunacy. The impact is all the more impressive given that we only actually *see* the actor, very briefly, in the last scene.\n\nThe film’s plot is incredibly basic, being essentially just a set-up followed by scenes of Jack evading the authorities. And it must be said that most of the supporting characters are thunderingly dull. Jack’s girlfriend and her father are played by Gloria Stuart (who 64 years later starred in James Cameron’s Titanic) and Henry Travers (the angel Clarence in It’s a Wonderful Life). Neither captures your attention. The film doesn’t really have any sympathy point, in fact – a problem solved in the 2020 remake, which tells its story from a victim’s POV. Instead the fun comes from the intrigue, the visual dynamics and some effective incidental music. There are also many moments of humour, especially when Irish actress Una O’Connor appears as a delightfully camp innkeeper. James Whale knowingly shifts away from the Gothic embellishments of Frankenstein and the result feels closer to a comedy.\n\nThe most notable aspect, then and now, is the astonishing special-effects work. The Invisible Man is a 1930s equivalent of Star Wars, Terminator 2 or Jurassic Park – a film where the effects’ power and awe have not dated at all. Whale ekes out the reveal of Jack’s invisibility during the opening act, creating mystery and tension. When his see-through face is first glimpsed (or *not* glimpsed, as it were), we cut away *just* as we realise what we’re seeing (or not seeing). Then when Jack finally unwraps the bandages from his invisible head, it is an extraordinary moment of wonder. How the *hell* have they done that?! Behind the scenes, a succession of techniques were deployed to dramatise the invisibility – hidden wires to move objects in mid-air, complex opticals to merge separately shot elements into one image – and the results are still spectacular after nine decades.\n\nSeven gold vaults of the nations, the secrets of kings, the Holy of Holies out of 10\n\nNext: Frankenstein’s Monster gets… a Bride!\n\nAn occasional series where I write about works inspired by Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula…\n\nThese reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nFaithful to the novel? No, this 1960s B-movie simply uses the title character in a new setting: Count Dracula finds himself in the Wild West!\n\nDressed in top hat and cape and wearing a Van Dyke beard, Dracula (John Carradine) is aboard a stagecoach as the story begins but doesn’t seem too interested in his chatty fellow passengers. Then a woman boasts about her family’s lucrative silver mine, and Dracula’s interest in piqued. She also shows off a photograph of her daughter, Betty. ‘Eighteen and beautiful?’ purrs the Count when he looks at the miniature. ‘Yes, I would love to see her!’\n\nAfter arranging the deaths of the woman and the other passengers at the hands of the local Native Americans, Dracula seeks out Betty (Melinda Plowman) and claims to be her uncle, James Underhill, whom she’s never previously met. His plan is to convert Betty into his immortal vampire bride – and take control of the silver mine. But a German woman called Eva (Virginia Christine), who’s also new to the area, suspects his true nature. And this in turn raises the fears of Betty’s fiancé, the former outlaw Billy the Kid (Chuck Courtney)…\n\nSetting: A generic, Hollywood-style Old West populated by characters in clothes borrowed from costume stores and white actors dressed up in Pocahontas frills to play Indians. If we were to give the movie a level of respect it doesn’t ask for, the presence of Billy the Kid would mean the story must be taking place circa 1880. The actual Billy, real name Henry McCarty and sometimes known as William H Bonney, was killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett in July 1881. He was a slight, short 21-year-old when he died – hence the nickname – but is played here by a 35-year-old former stuntman.\n\nBest performance: John Carradine had played Dracula twice before, in Universal Studios’ House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945), but was not enamoured with this reprisal. ‘I have worked in a dozen of the greatest, and I have worked in a dozen of the worst,’ he later said. ‘I only regret Billy the Kid versus Dracula.’ This disdain is easy to infer from his listless performance, which uses little more than a wide-eyed stare – sometimes to mean surprise, sometimes terror, sometimes seduction. This Dracula can vanish into thin air (thanks to the oldest editing trick in cinema) and transform into a bat (a puppet dangling on wire). But his chief characteristic is leering over Betty – he’s forever telling his ‘niece’ how pretty she is, which raises an incestuous element that the script does nothing with. (Incidentally, it’s never actually stated within the fiction that this story’s vampire is Count Dracula. That name is never once used, so the film’s title is doing all the heavy lifting here.)\n\nThe best of the cast by some distance is character actor Virginia Christine, playing the suspicious Eva. After the death of her daughter (at Dracula’s hand), Eva begins to work for Betty and adopts a protective, motherly role with the young woman. Given the crass tone of the film, Christine does a terrific job of finding and conveying the truth of her character’s plight.\n\nBest bit: Dracula stories usually have a ‘vampire expert’ who can explain things to other characters and the audience – the role is often fulfilled by the book character Van Helsing (or a variation thereof). Here, unusually and pleasingly, the cliché is split between two women. Eva has a knowledge of vampires and the superstitious ways of warding them off. She even visits Betty’s bedroom at night to arrange wolfsbane around the window frames, which echoes how Professor Van Helsing places garlic around Lucy Westenra’s neck in Stoker’s novel. Elsewhere, the local sawbones, Dr Henrietta Hull, is far from spooked by the notion that a vampire might be at large – instead she calmly reads out passages about the creature from her medical dictionary. She later tests whether Mr Underhill is an Undead while he’s carrying an unconscious Betty. Hull holds up a mirror and the reflection is a fun shot as we see an image of Betty seemingly hanging in mid air. A movie with a stronger sense of drama would have had Eva and Dr Hull team up: as it is, they never meet. Dr Hull is played by Olive Carey, the widow of silent-movie star Harry Carey. Their son Harry Carey Jnr, also a successful actor, appears in a small role in Billy the Kid versus Dracula and later had a cameo in Back to the Future Part III.\n\nReview: Director William Beaudine had been working in Hollywood since the silent era – he had been an assistant to director DW Griffith on The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance – but is now best remembered, when remembered at all, for crummy B-movies. He had a reputation for shooting swiftly and artlessly.\n\nOriginally released as part of a double-feature with Jesse James Meets Frankenstein’s Daughter (another Beaudine quickie), this film was made on a budget and a schedule (just eight days) that would embarrass the word shoestring. The story features a Dracula who has only a cursory similarity to the character from the novel and a Billy the Kid who shares almost nothing in common with the historical figure. It’s all vacuous nonsense, badly acted for the most part and staggeringly simplistic. But there’s also an unpretentious sense of throwaway fun that’s difficult to dislike too much.\n\nFive marks of the vampire out of 10\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nGiven that Dracula and Frankenstein had been such monster hits, so to speak, it’s not surprising that Universal were keen to produce more horror movies. They followed that pair of literary adaptations with another – Murders in the Rue Morgue, based on an Edgar Allan Poe short story. Released in early 1932, this marvellously Gothic film combined elements of Count Dracula and Baron Frankenstein into one role: Bela Lugosi’s Dr Mirakle steals the blood of female victims, but he does this for his immoral scientific experiments, not for sustenance. Today, the marketing team would no doubt pitch all these films as a Universal Monsters Cinematic Universe. In the 1930s, of course, they were just giving cinemagoers what they wanted.\n\nThen came the introduction of another iconic character who would spawn several sequels. As with Frankenstein, 1932’s The Mummy draws from the cast of Dracula. There’s the same screenwriter too and the same title music (a recording of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake), while the director is Dracula cinematographer Karl Freund. Even Bram Stoker himself lurks in the background: The Mummy shares several similarities with his 1903 novel The Jewel of Seven Stars. But there are breaks from the previous format – The Mummy is not a literary adaptation and is the first Universal Monsters film set in what was then the modern day.\n\nThe action kicks off at an archaeological dig in Egypt, organised by the British Museum. After an ancient, bandaged mummy is unearthed, its occupant comes to life and escapes, driving one of the dig’s party mad with fear (another wide-eyed role for series regular Dwight Frye). Then, 10 years later, an Egyptian historian called Ardeth Bey offers the archaeologists assistance in finding the lost tomb of the Princess Ankh-esen-amun… Of course, Bey is really the missing mummy, the 3,700-year-old Imhotep, and is played by Boris Karloff. In this dual role, Karloff – credited as ‘Karloff the Uncanny’ after his question-mark billing for Frankenstein – brings some of the same pathos and vulnerability he used in that previous film. Similarly he’s under more fantastic make-up design by the legendary Jack Pierce.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Bey develops an obsession with a half-Egyptian woman living in Cairo called Helen Grosvenor, who he realises is the reincarnation of Princess Ankh-esen-amun – and the two clearly have history. Helen is played by the exotic-looking Austrian actress Zita Johann, who was a believer in nonsense such as reincarnation, and the characters’ twisted love-story-across-the-centuries has some heft. Elsewhere, Edward Van Sloan plays his third occult expert in as many films (if these movies were being made today, he’d be literally the same character each time – a Nick Fury of the 1930s).\n\nVisually the film sits somewhere between the flat, stagey Dracula and the boldly expressionistic Frankenstein. Horror moments are played with maximum creep – slow but hold-your-breath – while the lighting is almost proto-noir. What it lacks most is the thrill of a shambling, bandaged mummy stalking innocent victims, as promised by the title. The only scene with a walking mummy is staged obliquely to keep Imhotep out of shot. But as viewers in 1932 would have realised instantly, all this use of archaeology, ancient treasures and evil curses is clearly trading on the Egyptology fad that had blown through Western art and culture since the 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb.\n\nEight sacred spells which protect the soul in its journey to the underworld out of 10\n\nNext: “Claude Rains was the Invisible Man…”"
