        "text": "\"The films that I make belong to a kind of cinema that is vanishing,\" he says. \"I mean cinema that puts the human being at the center and isn't aimed only at serving the large companies and corporations that produce it. We are now living in a scientific culture that prefers the technological to the human. Who still believes in beauty? Who still believes in emotion?\"\n\nKusturica says that it is getting more difficult nowadays for directors like himself to produce films in the context of this reality, even though there are still quite a number of artists who want to take this path, and organizations that support this kind of cinema. Most of the film production companies believe that all the audience needs, and also perhaps deserves, are films that provide a quick and easy thrill by means of silly plots. According to Kusturica, the production companies try not to allow audiences a profound experience and not to involve them intellectually and emotionally in what they are seeing.\n\nHowever, Kusturica is not entirely pessimistic. \"I believe that this can't continue,\" he says. \"A person needs the human, needs emotion, and as long as there are directors in the world like Aki Kaurismaki in Finland, Pedro Almadovar in Spain or Paul Thomas Anderson in the United States, the cinema that I believe in will continue to exist.\"\n\nKusturica says he still believes in the cinema as a kind of therapy, and that when he watches a good film he still feels that he is becoming a better and wiser person. \"Music gives me the same feeling,\" he says. \"When the band in which I have been playing the guitar since 1986 (the No Smoking Orchestra) gives a good performance, there is a feeling that everyone in the audience and the musicians have shared an experience that has changed them and has made them, at least for a while, better people.\"\n\nRomeo and Juliet in the Balkans\n\n\"Life Is a Miracle\" is set in Bosnia in 1992. Its hero is Luka, a Serbian engineer who moves from the big city, Belgrade, to a small village with his wife, Jadranka, who is an opera singer, and his son Milos. His aim is to build a railroad line there that will link the remote village to civilization and make it into a popular tourism spot. As Luka is an incurable optimist who dreams of the glory he wants to bring to the village, he ignores the approaching war but it nevertheless breaks out and changes his life. His wife, who hated life in the villages, runs off with a visiting musician, and his son is conscripted into the Serbian army. Later he hears that his son has been taken prisoner. He has an opportunity to free him when the army entrusts him with a Muslim hostage, a woman called Sabaha, whom he is supposed to exchange for his son. The trouble is that Luka is also an incurable romantic, and he and Sabaha fall in love. Now he has to choose between the woman he loves and the son he loves equally.\n\nKusturica, who was born in Sarajevo in 1954, tells how he was living in Paris when the war broke out in his homeland and, like Luka, refused for a long time to accept that the war was indeed going on. The idea for the film came from a young Serbian whom he met in Paris several years ago, to whose uncle this really happened. What attracted him to the story, he says, is its Shakespearean aspect; he defines \"Life Is a Miracle\" as a variation on the story of Romeo and Juliet that takes place against the backdrop of the war in the Balkans. According to Kusturica, the film is not a love story or a war film but rather a combination of the two.\n\n\"Life Is a Miracle,\" which took part in this year's competition at the Cannes Film Festival, was greeted with mixed reviews and did not win any of the prizes awarded by the jury headed by Quentin Tarantino. Kusturica has already won the Golden Palm award at Cannes, for \"When Father Was Away on Business\" in 1985 and for \"Underground\" in 1995 - quite a rare achievement. In general festivals tend to pamper him: his first film, \"Do You Remember Dolly Bell?\" won the Golden Lion at the Venice Festival in 1981.\n\nAre you disappointed because the judges ignored your latest film this year?\n\n\"No. I think that it is very impolite when a director whose film has participated in a festival and didn't win starts criticizing the jury. I have already participated in many festivals, and I've also served as a judge at many of them, and I know that there are numerous considerations and influences in the process of judging and selecting that you can't always follow and control.\"\n\nNevertheless, he does have a great deal of criticism over the results of the competition at Cannes.\n\n\"It's strange to me that a jury that started its work with extensive declarations about the importance and purpose of the film industry ended up by giving the Golden Palm to reportage, the entire importance of which is that it is trying to intervene and influence the election of the next American president.\"\n\nKusturica is referring to Michael Moore's film \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" which was screened Friday at the Jerusalem Film Festival for the first time in Israel and is now at theaters here. It would appear that Kusturica sees Moore's film as a betrayal of the aims of a film festival like Cannes, and further proof that in today's reality there is less and less place for films like \"Life Is a Miracle,\" although Kusturica hastens to note that more than 600,000 people have already seen it in France.\n\nIn his opinion, the award of the Golden Palm to \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" was only a political act - contrary to what Tarantino seemed to say when he awarded the prize - and not even a political act of particular significance. \"What is the difference between one American president and another?\" he asks. \"They're all really the same, they're all products of the media and they all declare that they want the same thing - to do well by the people and bring peace to the Middle East.\"\n\n`Amarcord' the ninth time around\n\nOne of the criticisms leveled at \"Life Is a Miracle\" at the Cannes festival - which in its day was also heard about \"Underground\" - was that Kusturica refrains from taking a position in support of one of the sides in the war.\n\n\"To my mind, this is so stupid,\" he says heatedly, \"and another sign of the bleak situation we're in. We are living today in a totally polarized world, in which if you are not with us it is a sign that you are against us, and there is no more room for the many nuances between good and bad, between black and white. There was even one critic who got up at the press conference after the screening and asked me why, instead of making a film of this kind, I wasn't making a film against [former Yugoslav President Slobodan] Milosevic.\n\n\"I think that it is a total mistake, not only about the war that was in Yugoslavia, but also about any war or conflict anywhere, to decide which side is right and which side is to blame, who the victim is and who the aggressor is. This just perpetuates the conflict. In my films I try to avoid propaganda. I try to get through to the ideology beyond those easy and hasty distinctions, to the human thing that is beyond them and in the end connects all people. I believe that every good film is ultimately a means that helps in the war against totalitarianism. But people today are afraid of ideology, and the human looks to them like an outdated concept. If you surrender to this, you lose your autonomy as a creative person.\"\n\nIt has been said of you that you recycle yourself, that nowadays when people go to see a Kusturica film, they know what to expect with respect to the style.\n\n\"Would those same critics say that Marc Chagall recycled himself? That Rembrandt recycled himself? All my life I've been making the same film. But the audience today demands events. It wants every film to be a thrilling event and to give it information that it does not yet know. The concept films d'auteurs, which my generation grew up on, has entirely lost its importance in the world in which we live. The greatest film ever made in my opinion is Federico Fellini's `Amarcord' from 1973. I watched this film eight times running, because at that time I was studying film at FAMU (a prestigious film school in Prague - U.K.), and every time I went to visit my family in Belgrade - where `Amarcord' was being screened at the time - I was so tired that each time I went to see it I would fall asleep after the first 15 minutes. Only the ninth time I watched the film did I see it in its entirety, and then I discovered it, and it is one of the greatest influences on me and on my style.\"\n\nIs it possible to talk about other influences?\n\n\"Of course. As a boy I loved westerns, but I always identified with the characters the heroes were chasing. I love the classical Hollywood cinema. Frank Capra and Ernst Lubitch are my heroes. Andrzej Wajda's `Ashes and Diamonds' from 1958 is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. I love the American films from the 1970s, which investigated how capitalism affects the life of the individual. There are so many names I could mention: Jean Vigo and Jean Renoir; Carol Reed's `The Third Man' from 1949, and Bruce Lee, whom I admire. I love films that have a carnival element in them, films that celebrate life and pleasure of life. I also love more severe films, like those of Robert Bresson.\"\n\nWhen asked how he would define his own style, Kusturica says that he thinks that there is something paradoxical about it: On the one hand he aims to make films with a broad vision like those of the Italian Luciano Visconti, who, he says, \"knew how to locate his characters in the landscape so well.\" On the other hand, he would like to make a more populist kind of film, cinema that has an element of protest that is reminiscent of punk music, which is performed by the band in which he plays. \"Could there,\" he asks, \"be any greater paradox than Visconti and punk?\"\n\nWhen asked whether in his films there is also a paradox in the combination of realism and surrealism, he says: \"Not really. I think that for me both of them spring from a similar source. In all my films my aim is to reach a well-articulated style that will help me express all my human abilities as a creative person. The question that I ask myself is how to represent the characters' internal landscape with the help of the external landscape. And out of an attempt to answer this question grows the combination of what is called realism and surrealism, by which they mean the depiction of a specific and existing reality versus the depiction of an invented and imagined reality. But I don't really believe in a distinction between the two, because as far as I am concerned there is nothing more abstract than realism itself. In my films I try to reach life itself, and life is beyond every genre.\"\n\nStarting from zero\n\nIn 1999 Kusturica directed a single film in the United States, \"Arizona Dream.\" The experience, he says, was both enjoyable and difficult. \"Because I made the film in America, and I had American producers, I tried to make a film by the rules. But how can I make a film by the rules if all my life I've been breaking the rules? I had wonderful actors: Johnny Depp, who in my opinion is the continuation of the old-fashioned anti-hero; Faye Dunaway, one of the symbols of the American cinema of the 1970s; Jerry Lewis, whom I admire, and Lili Taylor, who is a marvelous actress. But Faye Dunaway didn't get along with Jerry Lewis, who never stopped making me laugh.\n\n\"I want to make a movie in Hollywood, but it's hard to make a movie in a place that is controlled entirely by companies and corporations that decide what will be produced and what will not be produced. They see me as a director who comes from a place they don't know, and who speaks a language they don't know and simply don't know what to do with me. It's sad that I'm the only Slavic director who is known internationally these days and who manages to show his films in a large number of countries. Yet nevertheless, every time I make a new film I have the feeling that I'm starting from zero.\"\n\nIn recent years Kusturica has appeared as an actor in two films: Patrice Leconte's \"The Widow of Saint Pierre\" from 2000, and Neil Jordan's \"The Good Thief\" from 2003. \"Patrice Leconte is a positive person and the script of `the Widow of Saint Pierre' was excellent,\" says Kusturica, \"but the film didn't take off. A good script doesn't always become a good film; something additional has to happen, and it didn't happen in this case. I'm glad that I appeared in `The Good Thief\" and met Neil Jordan and Nick Nolte. To me they represent everything that is still positive in the commercial cinema.\"\n\nKusturica, who is on his second visit to Israel - his first was for the screening of \"Arizona Dream\" - does not have plans at this time to make another film. He is devoting most of his time and energy to a small village he has bought in Serbia - \"my village,\" he calls it. After many years of living in Paris, he intends to return to his homeland and live with his family in that village. When I ask him whether he has also appointed himself head of the village, he nods in affirmation, and a huge smile of happiness spreads across his face."
