Hop on board a rock n&#39; roller coaster ride through a Cabaret of Curiosities featuring Sword Swallowers, Hairculean aerialists hanging from their hair whilst suspended above the auditorium, Whirlwind Jugglers, Twisted Contortionists, Voodoo Acrobats, Pickled People, Hula Hooping Sideshow Showgirls and lots more!
