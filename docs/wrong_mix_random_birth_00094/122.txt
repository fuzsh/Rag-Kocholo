The highly acclaimed director, Quentin Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee on March 27, 1963. Quentin’s father, Tony Tarantino left the family before he was born. He was raised by his mother, Connie McHugh. Connie McHugh was only sixteen years old when she gave birth to Quentin Tarantino. They moved to California when Quentin turned four years old. In California, Tarantino fell in love films and dismissed school. Quentin’s mother, Connie McHugh married Curt Zastoupil who became Quentin’s stepfather. He spent his days watching movies and eventually dropped out of high school in the ninth grade. His first job was working at an adult film theatre as an usher while taking acting classes. After, he worked with Roger Avary at Video Archives for five years, together they created scripts. One of the first screenplays Tarantino worked on were “True Romance” and “Natural Born Killers.” Tarantino’s first film that he directed and wrote the screenplay was “Reservoir Dogs” in 1992. Two years later, Tarantino directed the critically acclaimed film, “Pulp Fiction” making $108 million at the box office. “Pulp Fiction” also won the Palme D’Or Award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for best director, best actor, best supporting actor, best supporting actress and best picture at the Academy Awards in 1995. However, Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary won best original screenplay for “Pulp Fiction.” Another box office favorite Tarantino created was the “Kill Bill Vol. 1” released in 2003. Quentin made the script especially for Uma Thurman and said it was his birthday present to her. “Kill Bill Vol. 1” was such a success that Quentin created “Kill Bill Vol 2” and “Kill Bill Vol 3.” Tarantino worked on digital filmmaking in Robert Rodriguez’s “Sin City” in 2005 as a favor to the director for producing soundtrack for his “Kill Bill” series. In 2007 Tarantino and Rodriguez worked on “Grindhouse” together. Quentin directed the first portion of “Grindhouse” which was called “Death Proof.” “Grindhouse” was three hours long and did not resonate with audiences. Three years later, Tarantino directed “Inglorious Basterds,” a film about World War II which was filmed in France and Germany. The film had a $70 million production budget. “Inglorious Basterds” is Tarantinos second highest grossing film at $321 million worldwide. The film had eight Academy Award nominations. Waltz was awarded at the Cannes Film Festival for the Best Actor Award. He was also awarded a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for the Best Supporting Actor. Quentin Tarantino’s latest box office hit was “Django Unchained” which was released in 2013. “Django Unchained” was awarded at the 85th Academy Awards by winning the best original screenplay. “Django Unchained” is Tarantino’s highest grossing film at $421 million worldwide. Quentin Tarantino is unique because he often has a small cameos in his films. For example, in “Pulp Fiction” Quentin played Jimmie Dimmick, in “Reservoir Dogs” Quentin played Mr. Brown, in “Jack Brown” he plays the voice in the answering machine, in “Grindhouse” he plays the rapist, and in “Django Unchained” he plays an Australian minor.
