        "text": "A timeline of events as depicted and mentioned in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. A specific date for the placement of the first three films has not been given, though the film's scriptwriters, while making the first film, placed them in a \"floating thirty-year environment\" set in the 18th century, sometime around the 1720s to 1750s.[1] However, On Stranger Tides was said to be set in the year 1750[2][3] and the official comic book adaptation of Dead Men Tell No Tales shows the film's events are set in 1751. Those two dates also help to set the events of the first three films around 1728/1729 though that still has to be officially confirmed by The Walt Disney Company.\n\n1466\n\nMontecuhzoma is born.\n\n1474\n\nJuan Ponce de León born in Santervás de Campos, Valladolid, Castile and León, Spain.\n\n1485\n\nHernán Cortés is born in Medellín, Extremadura, in Castile.\n\n1497\n\nSilver Pieces of Eight made in Spain.\n\n1513\n\nJuan Ponce de León discovers Florida while discovering the marvels of the New World in his search for the Fountain of Youth.\n\nc.1519\n\nHernán Cortés conquers the Aztec empire with his armies and wielding the Sword of Cortés.[4]\n\nThe Aztecs deliver to Cortés a stone chest containing 882 identical pieces of Aztec gold, as blood money to appease his slaughter. When Cortés refuses to stop his conquest, the Heathen Gods place a curse upon the treasure, so that anyone who took but one coin from the chest would become undead skeletons. The treasure ultimately ended up on Isla de Muerta.[5]\n\n1523\n\nJuan Ponce de León sails the Santiago to an island where he discovers the Fountain of Youth. The Santiago gets stranded inland by an ancient storm, sitting atop of rocks on the edge of a cliff.\n\nThe Mao Kun Map was created at some point before the Santiago's disappearance, showing Ponce de León's journey towards the Fountain.[6]\n\n1547\n\nHernán Cortés died. However, his spirit remained in the Sword of Cortés, and would be unleashed by anyone who spoke an incantation over both the Sword and its scabbard.[7]\n\n1576\n\nIsland of Douwesen was colonised by the Dutch.\n\n1580\n\nIsland of Falaise de Fleur was colonised by the French. The colony was destroyed a few months later by the Spanish.\n\n1590\n\nThe French colony of Falaise de Fleur is rebuilt.\n\nc. 1600–1660\n\nAt an unknown date, a sailor named Davy Jones and the sea goddess Calypso fall in love with each other. Calypso rewarded that love by giving Jones captainy aboard the Flying Dutchman and the sacred task of ferrying souls who died at sea to the afterlife. Because of that love, Davy Jones agreed to set foot on dry land once every ten years; and if this love was true to him, his task would be complete, and a new captain of the Dutchman would be found. Jones would spend the following decade in this duty, at the end of which he could be reunited with Calypso for a single day.[8][9]\n\nTen years after pledging to serve as ferryman aboard the Dutchman, Davy Jones returns to land for one day to be with his love, Calypso. But whenever Davy Jones came ashore, Calypso was nowhere to be found. Around this time, the First Brethren Court convenes at Shipwreck Cove, where Davy Jones plotted with the Brethren. With his help, the Brethren bound Calypso into human form with the Nine Pieces of Eight, so that the rule of the seas would belong to men. These Pieces of Eight would be passed down through the generations as each Pirate Lord names his or her successor to the Court.[8][10]\n\nShortly after the First Court, Davy Jones' grief and guilt at what he had done became so great, he literally carved out his heart and locked it in the Dead Man's Chest, which he buried on Isla Cruces.[11] Refusing to continue his duty, Jones returned to the seven seas; only now sailors everywhere would fear him to the death. Because of this, Jones became cursed, in which he and his crew slowly transform into sea creatures the longer they serve aboard the Flying Dutchman.[9]\n\n1600\n\nThe East India Trading Company is founded in England by London merchants on the 31st of December.\n\n1624\n\nGrandmama is born.[12]\n\n1630\n\nA French squadron assaults and occupies the English Colony of Oxbay, only the small trading vessel Victory manages to escape.[13]\n\nc.End of 1630–1631\n\nThe adventures of Nathaniel Hawk, captain of Victory, unfolds within the archipelago.[13]\n\n1661-1670\n\nThe Second Brethren Court convenes, during which the Pirate Lords Henry Morgan and Bartholomew set down the Pirate's Code and recorded it in the Pirata Codex.[14] Subsequent to the Code's creation, new members of the Court were appointed, including Keeper and Carriers of the Code, as well as deciding on how to elect the Pirate King. The method of summoning the Court was also decided by the form of a song: Hoist the Colours.[10]\n\n1673\n\nThe Faithful Bride tavern is opened in Tortuga.[15][16]\n\n1680\n\nBlackbeard is born in Bristol, England.\n\n1682\n\nJane Beckett is born to Jonathan Beckett Sr. and an unnamed female.[17]\n\nBartholomew Roberts is born to George Roberts of Little Newcastle, Wales and an unnamed female.[18]\n\n1683\n\nGeorge Augustus is born in Hanover, Germany.\n\n1684\n\nEsmeralda Maria Consuela Anna de Sevilla is born to Don Rafael's son and Quiauhxochitl, somewhere on the Spanish Main.[19][20]\n\n1687\n\nCutler Beckett is born to Jonathan Beckett Sr. and an unnamed female.[21]\n\n1688\n\nHenry Morgan was believed to have died because of liver failure in Port Royal. However, Morgan actually retreats to a remote island where he begins to study alchemy.[22]\n\n1689\n\nThe Spanish dons attack and burn Don Rafael's estate, killing Esmeralda's parents. Don Rafael becomes a pirate, eventually rising to the position of a Pirate Lord of the Caribbean.[23]\n\n1690\n\nJack Sparrow is born to Edward Teague and an unknown female aboard a pirate ship in the middle of a hurricane.[24]\n\nEdward Low is born in London, England.\n\n1695\n\nRobert Greene is born to unknown parents in England.[25]\n\nCaptain J.

Jones marks Torrents' body with the sign of Quetzalcoatl, found on the Sword's scabbard. This angers the heathen gods, who curse Torrents with storms that follow him constantly.[4]\n\nCutler Beckett gets captured by the pirate crew of Christophe-Julien de Rapièr. The pirates torture the young man for days which leaves him with eternal hatred for all maritime outlaws. Lord Reginald Marmaduke Bracegirdle-Penwallow eventually ransoms Beckett.[38]\n\nc. 1706[39]\n\nYoung Jack Sparrow begins his quest for the Sword of Cortés, assembling his first crew at Salty Cove. He discovers the City of the Dead, steals the eye of Stone-Eyed Sam and defeats Torrents.[40]\n\nJack Sparrow is granted an audience with the mermaids at Isla Sirena, and negotiates the lives of his crew in exchange for his freedom.[41]\n\nJack Sparrow locates Isla Fortuna and the Sword of Cortés. Left-Foot Louis is defeated by the Sword, and the spirit of Hernán Cortés is released by Sparrow.[7] Jack later releases the spirit of Montezuma to defeat Cortés.[42]\n\n1707\n\nThe British Royal Navy and the East India Trading Company forces led by Admiral Lawrence Norrington attempt to capture the infamous pirate Captain Edward Teague.\n\nThe unification of England and Scotland creates the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\n1708\n\nThe Spanish Royal Navy pirate hunter Armando Salazar attempts to destroy piracy in the Caribbean. Jack Sparrow tricks Salazar into sailing the Silent Mary into the Devil's Triangle, where Salazar's ship sinks with the entire crew. The dark forces within the Triangle resurrect the Spaniards as vengeful ghosts.[43]\n\nWill Turner is born to William \"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner and an unknown female[44] in Glasgow, Scotland.[45]\n\nElizabeth Swann is born to Weatherby Swann and an unknown female in London, England.[44]\n\n1709\n\nThe Rogue pirates begin violating the Code of the Pirate Brethren by slaughtering their prisoners.\n\n1710\n\nThe Rogue pirates destroy the ship of another pirate, Captain Hector Barbossa. The Pirate Lords at Shipwreck Cove decide to take action against the Rogues. Jack Sparrow is reunited with Esmeralda Maria Consuela Anna de Sevilla. Davy Jones identifies the Russian Pirate Lord Boris Palachnik as the leader of the rogues. Jack Sparrow unknowingly helps the rogues escape from Shipwreck Island. Sparrow escapes from the rogues with the help of Robert Greene.

His sister Jane dies.\n\n1715\n\nEast India Trading Company employee Jack Sparrow saves the ship he's serving on from falling into the hands of the pirates. His superior Cutler Beckett promotes him to captain and gives him command of his own merchant ship Wicked Wench.[49]\n\n1716\n\nEast India Trading Company employee Jack Sparrow refuses to transport a cargo of slaves for Cutler Beckett, so he sets them all free. In response, Beckett had Jack branded as a pirate and Jack's ship, the Wicked Wench, burned and sunk. Jack makes a deal with Davy Jones to raise the ship from the depths, allowing him to serve as Captain and to sail it for thirteen years before he must serve for a century aboard the Flying Dutchman. Jack renames his ship the Black Pearl.[50]\n\nJack Sparrow becomes the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea.\n\n1717\n\nJack Sparrow and the Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court defeat the Shadow Lord, finishing the Quest for the Shadow Gold.\n\n1718\n\nJack Sparrow, captain of the Black Pearl, shows up in Tortuga to recruit a crew to go after the Treasure of Cortés.[51] Three days into the voyage, Jack's First Mate, Hector Barbossa, leads a mutiny after Jack gives up the bearings to Isla de Muerta, and maroons Jack on a desert island.[52] Three days after his arrival, Jack barters passage off the island with a group of rumrunners.[5]\n\nCaptain Barbossa and the crew sail the Black Pearl to Isla de Muerta, where they find the treasure. After spending all the treasure, Barbossa's crew became cursed and set about returning all 882 pieces of the treasure.[5][52]\n\nBootstrap Bill Turner speaks out against the decision to mutiny against Jack and sent off his gold coin to his son, saying the crew deserved to remain cursed. Upon learning of Bootstrap Bill's actions, Barbossa has Turner strapped to a cannon, and sent to the bottom of the ocean. It is only after this point the crew learn they needed Turner's blood to lift the curse.[5][52] Bootstrap Bill began living out a tortured existence on the seabed, unable to die; until he eventually makes a bargain with Davy Jones, at an unknown time, agreeing to serve one hundred years aboard the Flying Dutchman.[11]\n\nBlackbeard was believed to be killed during the battle of Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina. However, Blackbeard survived the battle and continued acts of piracy, during which time he began to learn of the dark arts.[53]\n\n1720\n\nWill Turner's mother dies and he sets out to track down his father. Weatherby Swann and his daughter, Elizabeth, also set out from England to the Caribbean aboard the HMS Dauntless.[54][55] The merchant vessel Will Turner sailed on is attacked by the Black Pearl[52], and Will is rescued by the crew of the Dauntless. Will meets Elizabeth, who takes his medallion to ensure he is not mistaken as a pirate. The ship arrives at Port Royal, where Weatherby sets himself up as Governor and Will is at some point taken as John Brown's apprentice.[5]\n\nEdward England dies on Madagascar.\n\n1721\n\nMary Reade dies of fever and/or childbirth in a Jamaican prison.

Turner lifts the curse, allowing Jack to kill Barbossa and his crew to be killed or captured by Norrington's men. Jack escapes a hanging with Will's help, and rejoins his crew. Will and Elizabeth pledge their love to one another. Jack the monkey takes a coin from the chest and becomes cursed once more.[5]\n\nWill begins to train Elizabeth how to handle a sword.[11]\n\n1729\n\nOne year after the battle of Isla de Muerta,[59] the marriage of Will and Elizabeth is interrupted by Lord Cutler Beckett, who arrests them both and takes control of Port Royal. Jack Sparrow escapes from the Turkish prison with a drawing of the key. Will sets off to obtain Jack's compass for Beckett, and Elizabeth later escapes prison to track him down. Ragetti and Pintel escape from Port Royal prison. Jack, Will and the rest of the crew seek Tia Dalma who tells them the history of Davy Jones and Calypso. Will is press-ganged aboard the Flying Dutchman, but escapes with the key. Jack arrives at Isla Cruces and unlocks the Dead Man's Chest, though Norrington later steals the heart. Jack and the Black Pearl are dragged down to Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. Norrington presents Beckett with the heart, and is reinstated as admiral. Davy Jones falls under Beckett's command.[61]\n\nAfter about two months[62], the East India Trading Company calls a state of emergency, and carries out mass hangings at Fort Charles. While the Flying Dutchman, sailing under the Company, becomes the scourge of pirates in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, Jack Sparrow's crew, now under Barbossa's command, sail to reach World's End and rescue Jack Sparrow in Davy Jones' Locker. Sao Feng is killed onboard the Empress, and names Elizabeth Swann as Pirate Lord in his stead. James Norrington dies protecting Elizabeth as she escapes from the Flying Dutchman. The Fourth Brethren Court was called by Barbossa, convening as the EITC were advancing with an armada to destroy the world of pirates. Barbossa was eager to release Calypso, while Jack was eager to declare an act of war against the EITC, after which Elizabeth Swann was elected as the new Pirate King. Calypso is released from her human form and forms a maelstrom, where a battle raged at the center of it. During the battle, Will Turner and Elizabeth are wed by Barbossa, while Jack fights Davy Jones for the Dead Man's Chest. Jones is killed by a dying Will Turner, who replaces him as captain of the Dutchman, and Cutler Beckett dies aboard the Endeavour.[9]\n\nAfter the battle with Beckett and the EITC, Will and Elizabeth spend their one day together before Will begins his duty aboard the Dutchman, and conceive a child. Barbossa steals the Black Pearl, Gibbs stays in Tortuga, and Jack Sparrow steals the navigational charts and begins the search for the Fountain of Youth.[9]\n\n1730\n\nHenry Turner is born, approximately nine months after the battle of Calypso's maelstrom.[63]\n\n1732\n\nCarina Smyth is born to Hector Barbossa and Margaret Smyth.
