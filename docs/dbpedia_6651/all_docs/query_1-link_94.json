        "text": "Sometimes, even when you've carefully read a book and tried to follow all the intricacies of which character did what and when, you just can't quite put the whole thing together. That goes double for a novel like The Great Gatsby, which uses literary devices like flashbacks and flashforwards to explain the behavior of its characters in its present.\n\nBut don't fret! In this article, I've taken all of the novel's events and rearranged them in straightforward, chronological order. This complete Great Gatsby timeline allows you to see exactly when all of the book's events took place, and also get individual chronologies for each major character.\n\nWhy Make a Great Gatsby Timeline?\n\nThere are several good reasons why a timeline that organizes the book's events is a useful tool.\n\nFirst, a timeline jettisons potentially confusing time-shifts. Even though the novel is told mostly chronologically, it has several flashbacks and flashforwards. The most notable flashbacks revolve around James Gatz's transformation into Jay Gatsby, and what happened between him and Daisy. Meanwhile, the flashforwards take us into Nick's present-day framing narrative, after his disenchanted return to the Midwest.\n\nSecond, reordering all of these events in a clear chronology can help clarify the motivations and emotions behind character behavior. Putting Tom, Nick, and Gatsby’s activities side by side can help with compare/contrast assignments by reframing your thoughts about what they were each going through at a particular time.\n\nFinally, a warning. Watch out for other timelines out there on the web. I’ve found such mistakes as:\n\nSome timelines claim Gatsby was born in 1892 - but this is wrong. Fitzgerald gives enough dates, ages, and other details to accurately determine the right years for the book’s events.\n\nSome timelines claim that Dan Cody died in 1910 - again, wrong.\n\nThat Daisy and Gatsby first date occurred in August - nope, it’s October, which is important for the novel’s seasons motif.\n\nThe Great Gatsby Timeline\n\n1851\n\nNick Carraway's grandfather's brother starts the hardware business that his family owns.\n\n1857\n\nDan Cody is born. (We know this because he is 50 years old when he meets Gatsby on Lake Superior in 1907.)\n\n1890\n\nJames Gatz is born in North Dakota to Henry C. Gatz.. (We know this because he is 17 years old when he meets Dan Cody in 1907.)\n\n1892\n\nNick Carraway is born in a Midwestern city. (We know this because he turns 30 in 1922, the summer the novel takes place.)\n\nTom Buchanan is born to a very prominent family in Chicago. (We know this because he is 30 during the summer when the novel takes place.)\n\n1899\n\nDaisy Fay is born in Louisville, Kentucky. (We know this because she is 18 when she meets Gatsby in Louisville in 1917.)\n\n1901\n\nJordan Baker is born in Louisville, Kentucky. (We know this because she says that Daisy is two years older.)\n\n1902\n\nDan Cody, Gatsby's mentor, buys his yacht the Tuolomee and starts sailing. He does this to get away from Ella Kaye, his estranged second wife.\n\n1906\n\nJames Gatz works as a clam digger and salmon fisher on Lake Superior, and tries to go to St. Olaf Lutheran College in southern Minnesota before dropping out two weeks later unhappy to be working as a janitor to support himself.\n\n1907\n\nJames Gatz, 17 years old, meets Dan Cody in Little Girl Bay on Lake Superior and changes his name to Jay Gatsby.\n\n1907-1912\n\nGatsby sails the seas with Cody for five years.\n\n1910\n\nMyrtle marries George Wilson. (We know this because Wilson tells Michaelis that he and Myrtle have been married 12 years by the summer of 1922 when the novel takes place.)\n\n1911\n\nMyrtle and George Wilson move into the apartment above the garage in the valley of ashes.\n\nNick Carraway and Tom Buchanan go to Yale University. (We know this because they graduate in 1915.)\n\n1912\n\nDan Cody dies in Boston. He leaves $25,000 to Gatsby, but Ella Kaye uses legal means to take away this inheritance.\n\nGatsby is penniless but has learned polished manners and how the rich operate.\n\n1914\n\nWorld War I begins.\n\n1915\n\nNick Carraway graduates from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and goes to fight in WWI.\n\nTom Buchanan also graduates from Yale University.\n\nOctober 1917\n\nGatsby is stationed at Camp Taylor in Louisville, where he meets Daisy Fay (he is 27, she is 18). They are together for a month, and he is shocked by how much in love with her he falls.\n\nJordan also meets Gatsby.\n\nWinter 1917-1918\n\nGatsby leaves for Europe to fight in WWI.\n\n1918\n\nJordan becomes a professional golfer. She is later mired in a cheating scandal, but nothing is proven.\n\nSeptember 1918\n\nGatsby fights with distinction in the Argonne Battle, and then is promoted to Captain and then to Major. He also receives several medals.\n\n1919\n\nAfter Armistice, Gatsby spends five months at Oxford University in England, in a program for army officers.\n\nJune 1919\n\nDespite some reluctance, Daisy marries Tom Buchanan.\n\nAugust 1919\n\nTom Buchanan has an affair with a chambermaid during the honeymoon.\n\nOctober 1919\n\nMeyer Wolfshiem fixes the 1919 World Series.\n\nNovember 1919\n\nGatsby returns to Louisville while Daisy and Tom are on their multi-month honeymoon.\n\nGatsby goes to New York and asks his future partner, Meyer Wolfsheim, for a job.\n\nJanuary 1920\n\nProhibition goes into effect through the passage of the 18th Amendment, which outlawed most kinds of alcohol. Prohibition spurs widespread underground organized crime (represented by Meyer Wolfshiem and Gatsby in the novel).\n\nApril 1920\n\nDaisy gives birth to Pammy, and the Buchanans move to France.\n\n1921\n\nThe Buchanans move to Chicago, where Nick visits them for 2 days, then to East Egg on Long Island, New York.\n\nSpring 1922\n\nTom starts an affair with Myrtle Wilson.\n\nJune 1922\n\nNick decides to learn bond trading in New York. He rents a small house in West Egg, Long Island, next door to Gatsby’s mansion.\n\nNick has lunch with the Buchanans (Daisy is his cousin), and meets Jordan Baker.\n\nNick has a brief relationship with a woman from Jersey City.\n\nJuly 2, 1922\n\nTom takes Nick to meet Myrtle. They go to a Manhattan apartment, to a small party that ends with Tom punching Myrtle in the face for talking about Daisy. (We know the exact date because Nick notes that it was two days before the 4th of July holiday.)\n\nJuly 1922\n\nNick is invited to one of Gatsby’s house parties and meets him. Also at the party is Owl-Eyes, the guest who enthuses about Gatsby’s library.\n\nNick starts a relationship with Jordan Baker.\n\nGatsby takes Nick out to lunch, where Nick meets Meyer Wolfshiem, and where Gatsby meets Tom.\n\nJordan tells Nick that Gatsby and Daisy had been in love five years before.\n\nNick invites Daisy over for tea so that Gatsby can “drop by” and he and Daisy reconnect.\n\nAugust 1922\n\nA reporter comes by to investigate the rumors about Gatsby.\n\nTom Buchanan meets Gatsby when Tom stops by Gatsby’s in the middle of a horseback ride.\n\nTom and Daisy come to Gatsby’s next party, which Daisy hates.\n\nGatsby and Daisy begin their affair; Gatsby fires his staff and stops his parties.\n\nDaisy invites Nick and Gatsby for lunch at her house. She and Gatsby plan to reveal their love to Tom, but instead in the unbearably hot day, the group decides to go to Manhattan to the Plaza Hotel. There, Gatsby reveals the affair, and Tom reveals that Gatsby’s money comes from crime. Daisy is unwilling to completely renounce Tom, which decimates Gatsby. Daisy decides to stay with Tom.\n\nOn the way back from the hotel, Daisy, driving Gatsby’s car, runs over and kills Myrtle Wilson. That night, Tom convinces George Wilson that it was actually Gatsby who killed Myrtle. Also that night, Gatsby decides that he will take the blame for Myrtle’s death, and Nick and Jordan break up.\n\nThe next day, Tom and Daisy skip town for good.\n\nLater that day, Wilson shoots and kills Gatsby and then himself.\n\nSeptember 1922\n\nThe murder-suicide is mischaracterized as the actions of a deranged grieving husband, and there is no mention of the Buchanans or of Myrtle’s affair in the police report.\n\nGatsby’s father, Henry Gatz comes to the funeral from Minnesota.\n\nNick can’t find anyone else to come to the funeral. Even Wolfshiem refuses to come.\n\nOwl-eyes is the only other person who comes to the funeral.\n\nOctober 1922\n\nNick hashes things out with Jordan.\n\nNick runs into Tom in Manhattan, where Tom confesses to telling Wilson that Gatsby was driving the car that killed Myrtle.\n\nNovember 1922\n\nCompletely disillusioned and horrified, Nick moves back home to the Midwest.\n\n1924\n\nNick writes the story about Gatsby and that fateful summer - this story is the novel that we are reading.\n\nThe whole novel is basically Nick's furious journaling about his formative summer.\n\nIndividual Character Timelines\n\nIf you're writing a character analysis, or comparing two characters to each other, it may help to have those characters' biographies separate from the novel as a whole.\n\nJay Gatsby Timeline\n\nJames Gatz is born in 1890 in North Dakota.\n\nIn 1907, after a year of clam digging and fishing and two weeks at St. Olaf College in Minnesota, James Gatz changes his name to Jay Gatsby and meets Dan Cody.\n\nGatsby sails with Dan Cody from 1907 to 1912, when he loses the inheritance Cody wanted to leave him to Cody's wife.\n\nIn October 1917, Daisy and Gatsby meet in Louisville and date for a month, before Gatsby ships out to fight in WWI.\n\nGatsby fights with distinction, is promoted to Major, and gets several medals.\n\nIn 1919, he spends five months studying at Oxford University, then returns to the states and gets a job with Meyer Wolfshiem.\n\nGatsby buys a house across the bay from Daisy and Tom.\n\nGatsby takes Nick out to lunch, where Nick meets Meyer Wolfshiem, and where Gatsby meets Tom.\n\nNick invites Daisy over for tea so that Gatsby can “drop by” and he and Daisy reconnect.\n\nGatsby and Daisy begin their affair; Gatsby fires his staff and stops his parties.\n\nDaisy is unwilling to completely renounce Tom, which decimates Gatsby.
