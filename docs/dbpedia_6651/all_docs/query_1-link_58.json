Have an account? .\n\nGoldie Hawn recently spoke about why she and her partner of 40 years, Kurt Russell, never married.\n\nThe couple began dating in 1983 after working together on the romance drama \"Swing Shift.\"\n\nThey welcomed a son in 1986 and have starred in three other movies together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHawn and Russell met for the first time in 1966 on the set of a Disney movie. They were 21 and 16 respectively.\n\nThe two first became acquainted while filming \"The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band\" in 1966.\n\nFor Hawn, who was 21, it marked her screen debut, while Russell, then 16, had already starred in a handful of movies.\n\nDespite their six-year age difference and the large ensemble cast in the Western musical, Russell made a strong first impression on his future partner.\n\nReflecting on their time working together, Hawn said in a BBC Radio 4 interview in 2012: \"I thought he was adorable, but he was much too young.\"\n\n\"Then, years later, we met up again, and I remembered that I liked him very much when I first met him. We both said we would never go out with another actor, so it just shows you never can tell.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would be another 15 years before the pair reconnected. In 1983, the two were cast to play love interests in \"Swing Shift.\"\n\nBy that point, they had both been married and divorced. Hawn was married to director Gus Trikonis from 1969 to 1976, and to Bill Hudson — the father of Oliver and Kate Hudson — from 1976 to 1982.\n\nRussell, meanwhile, got divorced from his \"Elvis\" costar Season Hubley in 1983 after a four-year marriage. The pair welcomed a son named Boston Russell in 1980.\n\nSo when they found themselves recently single and auditioning alongside each other for the 1983 romance drama \"Swing Shift,\" the pair instantly connected.\n\nRussell said that, for his part, he was \"severely hungover\" and so put his \"worst foot forward\" when he saw Hawn again,\n\n\"I didn't know Goldie at all outside of having worked with her many years before,\" he recalled to Conan O'Brien.\n\n\"I just didn't know in my mind what I was going to see. She had a great body, and so the first that came out was, 'Man, you got a great figure.' And it kind of came out quickly and it could've been wrong and she said, 'Why, thank you.'\"\n\nThe pickup line surprisingly worked and Hawn and Russell went on a date together shortly after.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter three years of dating, Hawn and Russell welcomed their first child together, a son named Wyatt.\n\nOn July 10, 1986, Hawn gave birth to the couple's first and only child they share together: a son named Wyatt Russell, bringing their tally of children between them to four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year, the pair starred opposite each other once again in the rom-com \"Overboard.\"\n\nIn the 1987 screwball comedy, Hawn played a spoiled, wealthy socialite who loses her memory after falling from her husband's yacht. Taking the opportunity to rid himself of her, her husband skips town and leaves her in the hands of a widowed carpenter who once worked for her, played by Russell.\n\nIn 2017, Hawn said that she and Russell had sat down to rewatch the movie when they caught it airing on television one evening, and it stirred up feelings for both of them.\n\n\"You know how sometimes you forget why you fell in love? I remembered everything, and why I fell in love,\" she said during an appearance on \"The Late Late Show With James Corden.\"\n\n\"It was really something to be able to watch that.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the 1989 Academy Awards, Russell and Hawn staged an almost-proposal when they took to the stage together to present an award.\n\nThe couple had been dating for six years when they teased audiences at the 1989 Oscars by pretending to discuss marriage on stage.\n\n\"We fit in completely to the theme of the show. Because we're costars, we're compadres, we're companions and we're a couple,\" Hawn said.\n\n\"There's only one thing we're not,\" Russell replied. \"Married.\"\n\nAs the crowd whooped, Hawn leaned in to ask her partner: \"Is that a proposal?\"\n\n\"You're putting me on the spot. I guess now is as good a time as any to answer that,\" the \"Escape From New York\" actor began. But just as it appeared that he was going to pop the question, Russell looked over Hawn's shoulder,\n\n\"Oh, they want us to speed things up. Listen, we'll talk about it later tonight,\" he said as Hawn set the audience off into fits of laughter by pulling a face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2003, the pair became grandparents for the first time after Hawn's daughter, Kate Hudson, welcomed her first child.\n\nOf the four children in their blended family, Hudson, who followed in her mom's footsteps and became an actor, was the first to become a parent herself.\n\nThe \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\" star welcomed a son with her then-husband, Chris Robinson, in 2003.\n\nHudson later welcomed a second son with her ex-fiancé Matt Bellamy in 2011, and a daughter with her current fiancé Danny Fujikawa in 2018, per People.\n\nHer brother Oliver Hudson also has three children, born between 2007 and 2013, with Erinn Bartlett.\n\nMeanwhile, Wyatt Russell welcomed a son with actor Meredith Hagner in 2021. It's not known if Boston Russell has any children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 2007, the couple had spent 20 years together and found themselves faced with questions over the fact that they had chosen not to marry.\n\nSpeaking to Woman's Day, Hawn defended their decision not to tie the knot.\n\n\"We have done just perfectly without marrying. I already feel devoted and isn't that what marriage is supposed to do? So as long as my emotional state is in a state of devotion, honesty, caring and loving, then we're fine,\" she said.\n\nHawn added that the couple are \"both independently well-off\" and have raised their children \"brilliantly\" without a marriage certificate.\n\n\"We did a great job there and we didn't have to get married to do that. I like waking up every day and seeing that he is there and knowing that I have a choice,\" she continued. \"There is really no reason to marry.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, the couple received side-by-side stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHawn and Russell were honored in a double ceremony and their stars were placed near to one another on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2017, a tradition that is often reserved for actors who work together or are romantically involved.\n\nAccording to ABC News, Hawn's daughter Kate Hudson was met with laughter when she gave a speech, which she began with: \"I always thought I'd be talking about them at a wedding or something but since a wedding doesn't seem to be in our near future — ever — this may be my only opportunity.\"\n\nIn his own speech, Russell honored his longtime partner, saying: \"To you, I owe my wonderful life. Simply put Goldie, I cherish you. All the stars in the sky or on the boulevard can't hold a candle to that.\"\n\n\"There's no one else I'd rather be next to for all of that than Goldie Hawn,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2023, Hawn said she and Russell never tied the knot after they both experienced how difficult divorce can be.\n\nHawn opened up during a conversation with CNN's Chris Wallace, who asked why she and Russell aren't married.\n\n\"Why should we be? Isn't that a better question?\" Hawn responded. \"When it doesn't work out, it ends up to be big business. It's always ugly.\"\n\n\"Somebody actually has to take a look and say, 'How many divorces actually are fun? How many divorces actually don't cost money? How many divorces actually make you hate the person more than you did before? How many divorces have hurt children?'\"\n\nWhen Wallace pointed out that the two have been together for 40 years, Hawn explained, \"I like the idea that I can wake up in the morning and make decisions every day if I want to be here.\"\n\nShe also noted that \"staying independent with independent thinking is important.\"\n\nRead next\n\nRelationships Celebrity Couples\n\nAdvertisement"
