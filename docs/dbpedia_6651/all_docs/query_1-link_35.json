        "text": "These days, the only superpower that might top Professor X’s vast telepathic abilities or Magento’s magnetic powers would be the ability to understand the X-Men movie timeline(s). Because we’re gluttons for punishment, we’re going to take a crack at explaining how the movies in the X-Men film and TV universe relate to one another, including the latest X-Men movie: the Sophie Turner-led Dark Phoenix.\n\nAs a general rule to remember: Everything that happens in 1960s-set First Class exists in both timelines. It’s 1973 (which is to say the events of Days Of Future Past) where the major timeline schism occurs. With that in mind, let’s break down both main timelines.\n\nBuckle in, X-Men fans! This is going to be a bumpy ride…\n\n1. The Original X-Men Timeline\n\nTo create these timelines, we’re using only what has been shown on-screen. This means no viral marketing information (no matter how cool it was). We’ve also refrained from giving off-screen events their own spot on the timeline. If it didn’t happen in flashback, we’re not going to try to fit it in here. Creating these timelines was already hard enough. (I kind of blame you, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But maybe only because that is habit?)\n\n1962: X-Men: First Class\n\nCharles and Erik meet while they are both going after Nazi Kevin Bacon (aka Klaus Schmidt). After working together to build a team of mutants to fight for the CIA, they part ways at the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis, in part because Erik accidentally deflects a bullet into Charles’ spine, paralyzing him. It’s a messy divorce, and each has their own, conflicting view of the best way forward for mutant-kind.\n\nUnexplained continuity error: In 2000 X-Men,Charles claims he met Erik at the age of 17. There is also no mention of Charles and Mystique being “brother and sister.”\n\nread more: New Mutants Release Date Confirmed For 2020\n\n1973: X-Men Origins: Wolverine\n\nLogan and half-brother Victor Creed/Sabretooth fight in the Vietnam War. When Victor tries to rape a Vietnamese woman and kills the officer who tries to stop him, Logan defends him. The two are sentenced to death by firing squad and end up being recruited into Team X by William Stryker.\n\n1979: X-Men Origins: Wolverine\n\nLogan is approached by Stryker, who tells him that Victor has gone rogue. After Victor fake-kills Logan’s girlfriend (it’s a long story), Stryker convinces Logan to coat his bones with adamantium. (Because why not?) At the end of the film, an adamantium bullet to the head results in Wolverine’s amnesia.\n\nread more: The Avengers Who Were Also Mutants\n\nUnexplained continuity error: In The Last Stand, Moira MacTaggert is a Scottish doctor working at Muir Island’s genetic facility played by Olivia Williams. In First Class, which takes place forty years prior, she is an American agent working for the CIA played by Rose Byrne. Maybe there are two Moira MacTaggerts who are friends with the X-Men?\n\n2013: The Wolverine\n\nLogan isn’t doing so well after Jean’s death. He is invited to Japan by a super-rich Yashida (the dude he saved from the atomic bomb back in 1945). Yashida offers to take Logan’s healing powers from him so that Yashida can live and Logan can die. Logan says no thanks, but Yashida does not take no thanks for an answer…\n\nread more: Dark Phoenix To Be “New Beginning” For X-Men Franchise\n\nAfter a lot of fighting involving yakuza, Yashida’s granddaughter Mariko, a robot parasite that Logan has to tear off of his own heart, and an only-pretending-to-be-dead Yashida, Logan leaves Japan having mostly gotten over Jean’s death.\n\n2015: The Wolverine\n\nIn a post-credits sequence, Erik (complete with powers!) and Charles (yay, he is totally alive!) approach Logan in an airport. They tell him of an oncoming Sentinel threat, setting up the events of Days of Future Past…\n\nKind of explained continuity error: Um, I guess the cure wore off of Erik? Also, Charles is alive? There is some alluding to his having transferred his consciousness into another body, but, unless that body was his twin, it doesn’t make sense that he would still be Patrick Stewart-shaped.\n\nUnexplained continuity error 2: Angel is a teenager in 1983, so at youngest, he was probably seven to nine-years-old during the events of Days of Future Past in ’73. So time traveling should not have affected his age, yet he is also in his late 20s in 2006 and looks more like a Ben Foster type. (Courtesy of David Crow)\n\n1992: Dark Phoenix\n\nWe catch back up with the X crew in 1992, nine years after the events of Apocalypse. Charles Xavier’s School For Gifted Youngsters seems to be going strong, as do the X-Men who also call the school home. Things hit a snag when Jean Grey (who has aged very little since 1983), is hit by a cosmic force during an X-Men mission into space.\n\nread more: Why The X-Men Don’t Belong in the MCU\n\nUnexplained continuity error: No one has visibly aged. At this point, we’ve actively stopped caring.\n\n2016: Deadpool\n\nFormer Special Forces operative Wade Wilson undergoes an experiment that leaves him with powers. He adopts the Deadpool persona and hunts down Ajax, the man who destroyed his life.\n\nBecause Deadpool ignores the Wade Wilson character of X-Men Origins: Wolverine,it seemingly takes place in the New X-Men Timeline. That being said, Wilson’s meta commentary about the multiple X-Men timelines implies its own meta-universe. But who has time for that?\n\nread more: Is the Marvel Villain Problem Solved by The Disney-Fox Merger?\n\nAnyway, Deadpool has always known he’s in a comic book, so it makes perfect sense he’d just embrace the absurdity of knowing he’s in a movie too.\n\n2023: X-Men: Days of Future Past\n\nAt the end Days of Future Past,we see Logan return to a 2023 where there is no Sentinel threat and Xavier’s school is thriving with both Jean and Scott alive and well. Everyone lives happily ever after.\n\n3. X-Men Timeline Outliers\n\n2029: Logan\n\nNo one really seems to want to come out and explicitly say in which timeline the Loganmovie takes place, and I can understand why. Because it doesn’t really fit in either. From what I can tell, Loganhas to take place in a third X-Men timeline, as it recognizes events from both the Original X-Men Timeline and the New X-Men Timeline as canon.\n\nWhat does it count as canon from the Original X-Men Timeline? As we mention in our Logan Easter Eggs article, Logan and Charles discuss a long ago incident at the Statue of Liberty, hinting at the events of the very first X-Menfilm. Logan also talks to Dr. Rice about killing his father, Dr. Cornelius — something that happened at the end of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, aka the Original X-Men Timeline. However, Logancan’t take place in the Original X-Men Timeline because the events of the Sentinel future are avoided.\n\nread more: How Do You Put the X-Men in The MCU?\n\nWhat does it count from the New X-Men Timeline? In Apocalypse, we see an Essex Corporation suit taking Logan’s blood for use in the experimentation that presumably leads to X-23’s existence. However, Logancan’t take place in the New X-Men Timeline not only because of the ways in which is recognized the Original X-Men Timeline, but because there is no mention of the happy future from the Days of Future Pastepilogue.\n\nSome might argue that the epilogue takes place before the psychic event that has Charles unwittingly killing some of his X-Men family (something hinted at in Logan), but, in Logan, it is stated that no new mutants have been born for 20 years, which doesn’t seem to match up with that we see in the Days of Future Pastepilogue.\n\nread more: Sophie Turner on the Dark Phoenix Reshoots\n\nFurthermore, we see different versions of Caliban in Apocalypseand Logan.\n\nWhat does Logandirector James Mangold have to say about all of this? Um, he doesn’t really seem to have a clear answer either, saying at a pre-release screening of Logan‘s first 40 minutes:\n\nSo the idea for us was this idea that they live in a world in which the legend of them exists, but it’s not really what happened, completely. Or is it? And I think that the movie goes deeper and deeper into these characters wrestling with their own legacy. And how much of it is true. And how much of it even they believe anymore, and is that a function of what is true or not? Or is that a function of whether they have lost belief in themselves?\n\nDo you get it now?\n\nIn an interview with Digital Spy, Hugh Jackman seemed more willing to take a clear stance on the subject, saying: “Not only is it different in terms of timeline and tone, it’s a slightly different universe. It’s actually a different paradigm and that will become clear [when you see the movie].”\n\nread more: Dark Phoenix Could Be The X-Men Franchise’s Salvation\n\n2017: Marvel’s The Gifted\n\nSo far, The Gifted seems to take place roughly in contemporary times, though in an alternate timeline from both our own and the two recognized timelines of the X-Men universe. Here’s how showrunner Matt Nix explained it (via io9):\n\nThe idea is that this is definitely its own universe. We’re not in the same exact timeline as any particular movie or comic, but that said we do share some characters with the movies and comics. The idea is we’re doing our own thing. As they say, there are many streams.\n\nGiven that the X-Men and Brotherhood are mentioned as having disappeared in The Gifted pilot, it’s unclear, at this point, if the show might try to tie into a larger recognized timeline (or at least show similarities to existing ones) at this point.\n\nread more: A New Cinematic World of Gods and Superheroes\n\nIs the X-Men franchise’s casual relationship with continuity a problem?\n\nWith the planned debut of several more movies and TV shows, the X-Men franchise’s continuity issues are likely only going to get more numerous. But is that a problem? It probably depends what your ability to suspend disbelief is like and how much you care about continuity issues.\n\nDen of Geek‘s Gabriel Bergmoser argues that X-Men’s continuity issues are actually a tremendous strength, freeing up the franchise’s individual films and TV shows to make bold choices in a way that the Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn’t allow. Loganis the perfect example. It is being hailed as one of the strongest superhero movies ever, and it makes the least sense within the established X-Men timelines.\n\nread more: A History of Live-Action Marvel TV Shows\n\nWhen it comes down to it, the X-Men movie franchise has been doing this longer than most onscreen shared fictional universes, and has done a pretty good job considering. If it makes it easier, maybe you should just start to think of X-Men movie installments as all taking place within their own timeline, drawing on context from other X-Men movies, but only to the extent that it makes emotional and/or narrative sense. (Hey, it worked for Logan.) Besides, as we established earlier, playing fast and loose with continuity is a very comic book thing to do.\n\nIn the end, it might not matter at all. Now that Disney, which owns Marvel, has finished merging with Fox, which owns X-Men, the future of the X-Men movie franchise is up in the air. Disney could decide to bring the X-Men characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or perhaps to relaunch the franchise in some other way. But we will always have these, frankly, ridiculous “original” X-Men franchise timelines.\n\nDo you have any continuity issues and/or timeline theories to add to our list?
