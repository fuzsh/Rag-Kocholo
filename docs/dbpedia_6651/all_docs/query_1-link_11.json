        "text": "Crushing on Tom Cruise while on the set of “Cocktail” was risky business.\n\nJust ask his co-star Gina Gershon, who recently shared that while filming the 1988 classic, Cruise’s first wife, Mimi Rogers, was always on set.\n\n“He had just gotten married, and his wife was very present,” the 62-year-old said while on “Watch What Happens Live” Wednesday. “[She] said, ‘Hi, nice to meet you.’”\n\nGershon, however, noted that Rogers’ presence didn’t stop the stars from doing their jobs.\n\n“But we did kiss as much as we could,” the “Breathless” actress quipped. “Every scene it was like, ‘Should we kiss in the scene? Oh yeah, I think we should kiss.’ It was my first love scene ever.”\n\nWhen host Andy Cohen asked if Cruise, 62, “took care” of Gershon, she quickly replied, “Totally.”\n\n“He was even a gentleman,” she recalled. “I told him, at one point, he starts off under the covers, and I told him I was very ticklish, I said, ‘No, no, don’t ever do that.'”\n\nBut the “Top Gun” star couldn’t help himself.\n\n“In one take, I have to say, I think he wanted a reaction, and he grabbed my stomach, and I kneed him right in the nose,” Gershon confessed. “I was like, ‘Oh, my god, I just broke Tom Cruise’s nose.’ He’s like, ‘No, no, you told me.’ I was like, ‘I’m so sorry,’ he was like, ‘No, it was my fault.'”\n\nThe “Red Heat” star added, “He was so protective over me. He was great.”\n\nCruise and Rogers first met in 1985 when he was 23 and the “Gung Ho” actress was 29. The former couple tied the knot two years later.\n\nAt the time, Rogers told the Sun Sentinel that mutual friends had set up her and Cruise.\n\n“I wasn’t seeing anybody, he wasn’t seeing anybody,” she explained, “and they thought, ‘These people should be going out with somebody — let’s see if they want to go out with each other.’ And we said, ‘Aw, what the heck. OK.'”\n\nHowever, the two finalized their divorce in February 1990, but not before Cruise gushed about his then-wife to Rolling Stone a month prior.\n\n“I think it’s helped me be a better actor,” he said about getting married. “We live a lot of life together. We share everything. That’s the best thing about life. Otherwise, you go through it pretty sad and lonely and angry.”\n\nCruise added, “I care about my wife more than anything in the world. She’s my best friend. I just really like being with her, you know? I love her.”\n\nAfter Cruise and Rogers’ split, he was married to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001. They adopted two children together, Bella, 31, and Connor, 29, before getting divorced in 2001 after 11 years of marriage.\n\nCruise would go on to marry Katie Holmes in 2006. Their daughter, Suri Cruise, was born that same year.\n\nAfter six years of marriage, Holmes, 45, filed for divorce from Cruise in June 2012. The divorce was settled soon after. Page Six confirmed in March 2023 that Cruise has remained estranged from his daughter and has “no part” in her life.\n\nFast-forward to the present day, and the “Mission: Impossible” star’s love life is again making headlines.\n\nRumors surfaced earlier this month that he was dating Spanish musician Victoria Canal, but the 25-year-old quickly shut down speculation.\n\n“Guys. i am not dating tom cruise. this is literally insane,” Canal wrote on her Instagram Stories.\n\nShe also posted a picture of herself covering her mouth with her hand while addressing the claims in a lengthy caption.\n\n“Guys, this is literally bonkers, but apparently the tabloids think i am dating tom cruise. i’m deceased,” she shared in part. “Let’s just stop this in its tracks – i’m sorry to bum u out but i am not dating the man, albeit a lovely person & artist. lol never thought I would have to clarify that out loud in my life.”\n\nCanal continued the message, “In all seriousness guys, tom has been nothing but a respectful and encouraging person and mentor, much like chris martin, my dad, my music teachers and other wise people that have learned a lot from living. and again, i am friends with all kinds of people who are very different to me.”\n\nThe duo met at the Glastonbury festival in England earlier this year."
