        "text": "Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's love story has come to an end — again.\n\nOn Aug. 20, 2024, the Marry Me actress filed for divorce from Affleck. The news came after months of marital strife, which resulted in the couple living separately and focusing on their \"separate lives.\"\n\nAffleck and Lopez initially met in 2002. After ending their engagement in 2004, they both pursued other relationships and started families of their own.\n\nThe \"On the Floor\" singer was married to Marc Anthony from 2004 to 2014, and they are parents to twins Max and Emme. Meanwhile, the Deep Water actor was married to Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018, and they have three kids together, daughters Violet and Seraphina and son Samuel.\n\nIn April 2021, the pair were spotted together for the first time in over a decade, sparking relationship rumors. Lopez and Affleck eventually went public with their rekindled romance and wed in July 2022.\n\nFrom the beginning of \"Bennifer\" to their second engagement, here's a complete breakdown of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's relationship.\n\nEarly 2002: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck first meet\n\nLopez and Affleck first met in 2002 on the set of their movie Gigli, which came out the following year. At the time, Lopez was married to her second husband, Cris Judd. The couple eventually divorced in 2003, Lopez and Affleck went public with their romance shortly after.\n\nLopez told PEOPLE in 2016, \"I really felt like when I met Ben, 'Okay, this is it.\"\n\nThe duo quickly became one of the biggest couples in Hollywood and one of the first to receive a hybrid couple name: \"Bennifer.\"\n\nNovember 2002: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck get engaged\n\nIn a November 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer, Lopez revealed her engagement to Affleck, describing it as \"traditional, but also in a very spectacular way, as of course Ben would do it … it was very, very beautiful.\"\n\nPEOPLE reported at the time that Affleck proposed with a custom-made Harry Winston pink-diamond solitaire ring he chose himself.\n\nIn her interview with Sawyer, Lopez described her then-fiancé as \"brilliantly smart … Loving. Charming. Affectionate,\" adding that her mother approved.\n\n\"And I just admire him in every way,\" she said.\n\nShe also acknowledged that some people viewed their relationship as unlikely, but pointed out that she and the actor had bonded over similar upbringings.\n\n\"We've talked about this so many times, and we talked about how people kind of see him with … one type of person and me with another type of person, and the two of us together is like, 'How did that happen?'\" she said.\n\nLopez added, \"And how we're probably more alike and from the same kind of background … same kind of upbringing and same kind of family and same kind of house.\"\n\nEarly 2003: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck face tabloid frenzy\n\nHeading into 2003, Lopez and Affleck were one of the most popular Hollywood couples to appear in the tabloids and were infamously hounded by the paparazzi.\n\nLopez even acknowledged their notoriety in the music video for her song \"Jenny from the Block,\" which featured paparazzi shots of herself and Affleck doing everything from pumping gas to lounging on a yacht together.\n\n\"We didn't try to have a public relationship,\" Lopez told PEOPLE in 2016. \"We just happened to be together at the birth of the tabloids, and it was like 'Oh my God.' It was just a lot of pressure.\"\n\nLopez told InStyle that the media circus surrounding her relationship with Affleck was \"just crazy.\"\n\n\"Now at least I can show you who I am a little bit,\" she said. \"Back then you just believed anything you read on the cover of a tabloid. Many times it wasn't true, or it was like a third of the truth.\"\n\nIn a January 2021 podcast interview, Affleck reflected on how rude media coverage of Lopez was when they were together.\n\n\"People were so f---- mean about her — sexist, racist. Ugly, vicious s--- was written about her in ways that if you wrote it now you would literally be fired for saying those things you said,\" he said. \"Now it's like, she's lionized and respected for the work she did, where she came from, what she accomplished — as well she f----- should be! I would say you have a better shot, coming from the Bronx, of ending up as like [Justice Sonia] Sotomayor on the Supreme Court than you do of having Jennifer Lopez's career and being who she is at 50 years old today.\"\n\nAugust 1, 2003: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck star in the film Gigli\n\nLopez and Affleck met on the set of the 2003 rom-com Gigli. Despite their chemistry on-screen, the film bombed at the box office and was panned by critics. PEOPLE called it \"the Stinker of Summer.\"\n\nLess than two weeks after the film's release, Affleck admitted on The Tonight Show that the movie \"wasn't good,\" and they \"got buried.\" He even poked fun at the film by reading the negative reviews on the late-night show.\n\nSeptember 10, 2003: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck postpone wedding\n\nJust days before Lopez and Affleck were set to be married in Santa Barbara on Sept. 14, 2003, the couple announced in a statement that they would be postponing their marriage. Lopez and Affleck cited the intense media spotlight as the reason for the postponement.\n\n\"Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date,\" Affleck and Lopez said in the statement. \"When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate 'decoy brides' at three different locations, we realized that something was awry.\"\n\n\"We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends,\" they added.\n\nJanuary 2004: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck break up\n\nPEOPLE previously reported that after briefly splitting up in the wake of the canceled wedding, the duo rekindled their relationship, but officially called it quits in January 2004. The intense media attention is largely said to have been a major factor in their breakup.\n\n\"Jennifer Lopez has ended her engagement to Ben Affleck. At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy,\" Lopez's rep said at the time, while Affleck's rep added, \"I am not going to confirm anything about his personal life. We don't want to get dragged into quicksand. Everybody wants a war. It's not happening from our side.\"\n\nIn her interview with PEOPLE in 2016, Lopez said that despite their split, there was \"genuine love\" between herself and Affleck.\n\n\"I think different time different thing, who knows what could've happened, but there was a genuine love there,\" she said.\n\nMarch 26, 2004: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck star in the film Jersey Girl\n\nJersey Girl, the second film starring Lopez and Affleck, was released in March 2004 — two months after the couple split. Filmmaker Kevin Smith, who wrote and directed the movie, would claim years later that he came up with the \"Bennifer\" nickname during the film's production.\n\n2015-2020: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck remain friends\n\nLopez and Affleck remained supportive of one another in the years following their split.\n\nIn 2020, Affleck showed his support for Lopez's acting career, saying that she should have been nominated for an Oscar for her role in Hustlers.\n\n\"She should have been nominated. She's the real thing,\" Affleck told New York Times reporter Brooks Barnes. \"I keep in touch periodically with her and have a lot of respect for her. How awesome is it that she had her biggest hit movie at 50? That's f—— baller.\"\n\nApril 2021: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck rekindle their relationship\n\nFollowing Lopez's split from Alex Rodriguez in April 2021, the singer began spending time with Affleck in L.A.\n\n\"They are friends. They have always been friends and they have seen each other through the years,\" a source told PEOPLE.\n\nAnother source told PEOPLE, \"They have a great time hanging out. ... It's been years since they caught up properly. They have lots to talk about. They plan on hanging out again.\"\n\nLess than a week later, the two were spotted in Montana together. Sources told PEOPLE they were pictured riding in a car together near a resort in Big Sky, where Affleck has a home.\n\n\"[Jennifer] spent several days with Ben out of town. They have a strong connection. It's all been quick and intense, but Jennifer is happy,\" a source told PEOPLE.\n\nJuly 24, 2021: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck go Instagram official\n\nIn July 2021, Lopez posted a carousel of photos on Instagram in honor of her 52nd birthday. Grouped in the mix of bikini and boat pictures, the final photo in the roundup showed Lopez and Affleck kissing.\n\nThis marked the first time the couple personally posted about each other on social media.\n\nSeptember 10, 2021: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck walk their first red carpet since rekindling their romance\n\nAt the Venice Film Festival in September 2021, the duo made returned to the red carpet for the first time since reuniting. It was a big night for the two, but especially for Affleck as it was the premiere of his film, The Last Duel.\n\nAffleck and Lopez channeled Old Hollywood vibes as they strutted the carpet alongside each other in glamorous looks.

We have kids and we respect each other. ... We really live our lives in a way we can be proud of and our kids can be proud of you.

I honestly felt like I was going to die. It sent me on a spiral for the next 18 years where I just couldn't get it right. But now, 20 years later, it does have a happy ending. It has the most would-never-happen-in-Hollywood ending.\"\n\nThe singer went on to talk about her new album, This is Me...Now, which she hopes will inspire others not to give up on love.\n\n\"True love does exist and some things do last forever and that's real. I want to put that message out into the world and that does take a lot of vulnerability,\" Lopez said, adding that Affleck \"loves\" the album. \"He's my biggest fan, which is awesome, and supporter.
