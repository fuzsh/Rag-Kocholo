        "text": "Credit: Shutterstock\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Lopez: Timeline of the Bennifer Romance\n\nThe word “Bennifer” might include flashbacks to frosted lip gloss and butterfly clips, but everything comes back in style eventually. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez got back together nearly 20 years after their romance first took the world by storm. The pair first connected in 2002 on the set of the ill-fated Gigli. The movie flopped at the box office and among critics, who claimed Affleck and Lopez didn’t have much chemistry. It was a different story off-screen. Lopez filed for divorce from second husband Cris Judd in June 2002, and she went public with the Good Will Hunting star after. The “Waiting for Tonight” singer had a 6-carat pink diamond ring on her finger by November. Their wedding was set for September 2003, but they canceled just days before the ceremony due to “excessive media attention” before officially splitting in January 2004. Nearly two decades after seemingly moving on (with Lopez marrying Marc Anthony and Affleck starting to see Jennifer Garner in 2004), the exes reunited in spring 2021. Lopez and Affleck finally said \"I do\" in a Las Vegas ceremony in July 2022.

Everyone was worried about the heat, the aptly named ‘love bugs,’ the details, would the guests all arrive on time, etc. — not to mention the thunder and lightning that arrived almost on cue each day at the exact time the ceremony was supposed to start that Saturday,” Lopez wrote. “Oh, and all of us caught a stomach bug and were recuperating ‘til late in the week, that, and along with a few other unexpected setbacks, had all the makings of a doozie of a wedding weekend.\n\nDespite the various concerns, the “Let’s Get Loud” singer revealed she “never had a doubt” the wedding would go off without a hitch. The “sun broke free” just minutes before the couple said “I do,” and Lopez referred to it as “one of the most perfect moments” of their lives.\n\n“The sky was clear blue, and distant clouds of pure white held fast in the sky. As the sun set behind the live oaks draped in Spanish moss, a warm breeze swept over the lawn where our closest family and friends sat and, at long-last, I started my walk down the stairs that would become the aisle that would lead me toward the rest of my life. Ahhhhh … it was actually happening,” she gushed about the romantic ceremony.\n\nThe New York native also revealed the song that played during the first dance — “The Things We Handed Down” by Marc Cohn — and spoke about serenading her hubby at the reception, which took the Good Will Hunting star’s breath away.\n\n\"When he saw me appear at the top of the stairs that moment it both made absolute sense while seeming still impossibly hard to believe, like the best dream, where all you want is never to awaken,” Lopez noted. when I got close enough to see his face, it made the same wonderful sense to me. Some old wounds were healed that day and the weight of the past finally lifted off our shoulders. Full-circle — and not at all the way we planned it. Better.”\n\nCredit: Stephen Lovekin/Shutterstock\n\nOctober 2022\n\nAn insider told Us that the duo are \"still in their honeymoon phase\" months after their two weddings. \"They are very head over heels for each other,\" the source said. \"Becoming husband and wife hasn't changed their relationship much, except for the fact that it solidified what they had. They're looking at homes to purchase together and hoping to find one they're both happy with. It's been an ongoing process.\"\n\nAfter their two honeymoons, the duo are focusing on work and family. \"Jen is hard at work filming, and Ben has been taking over daddy duty and helping out with the kids a lot,\" the insider explained. \"She adores the fact that he is such a great father and she can always rely on him. He's been very supportive of her and has visited her on set, which she loves.\"\n\nCredit: Rocco Spaziani/UPI/Shutterstock\n\nNovember 2022\n\nLopez revealed during an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe that her now-husband inscribed a secret message on her second engagement ring. \"Not. Going. Anywhere,\" she said. \"Because that's how he would sign his emails when we started talking again. Like, 'Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.'\"\n\nThe songwriter also reflected on losing the \"love of my life\" after their early 2000s split. \"It was so painful after we broke up,\" she confessed. \"Once we called off that wedding 20 years ago, it was the biggest heartbreak of my life. I honestly felt like I was going to die. It sent me on a spiral for the next 18 years where I just couldn't get it right. ... Now, we know. And there [are] no questions and there is no kind of like, 'Well, let's see how this goes.' Like, 'Nope, it's me and you. That's it. All the way, till the end. That's it. It's going to be us.'\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jennifer Lopez/Instagram\n\nDecember 2022\n\nIn her \"On the JLo\" newsletter, Lopez gave fans a glimpse of how she and her husband celebrated their first Christmas as a \"blended family\" with their children. \"I've been hunkering down at home (and loving it) since I wrapped my last movie, just getting ready for the holidays!\" she wrote, explaining that her festive season was inspired by her new song \"Hummingbird\" from her album This Is Me ... Now. \"I decided this year that the hummingbird would be a perfect theme. We have blended families, doubled the people, doubled the fun, doubled the love, doubled the presents and tripled the chaos!!\"\n\nShe went on to describe a new tradition she and Affleck began for their littles ones: a Christmas Taco Tuesday. \"This was the first time in a long time we were able to get together with people that we haven't seen in forever,\" Lopez added. \"The party was filled with family, friends, colleagues, and people we've known from over the years. We sang and danced and had the most amazing time!\"\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nThe twosome packed on the PDA at the premiere of Lopez’s Shotgun Wedding. While promoting the movie on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the actress got candid about their Sin City wedding.\n\n“We were planning to get married in August in Savannah, the family was going to be there, everyone’s going to be there, and it was so stressful. … And it kind of all fell apart [when we were supposed to wed in 2004] and this time, I absolutely had a little PTSD and I was like, ‘Is this happening?’” she said. “We were so happy, but I just felt the wedding was so stressful. And one day Ben just said, ‘F—k it, let’s just go to Vegas and get married tonight.’”\n\nAfter admitting that she’s “learned to embrace” the Bennifer nickname, Lopez explained how her second-round at romance with Affleck inspired her upcoming album.\n\n“I did an album 20 years ago that, obviously, had a song called ‘Dear Ben’ on it that was about the time that me and Ben were together then. I got very inspired when we got back together,” she said of This Is Me Now. “It was kind of like a miracle and something that neither one of us really ever thought would happen and I went into the studio, and I wrote an album in two months.”\n\nCredit: Rob Latour/Shutterstock; Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nMarch 2023\n\nAffleck revealed that Lopez had been encouraging him to be more open amid speculation about his unapproachability. \"She thinks that because of experiences that I’ve had, I’ve become very guarded. And she’s right,\" the Air star told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I view these things as land mines, where if you say one wrong thing, your career might be over. She tells me today, 'Relax, be yourself. Have fun. You’re a fun guy who is real and genuine and you just seem so serious.' Do I seem serious? But as in many things, she’s right. And she loves me. She’s looking out for me. She’s trying to help me. So, it’s like, maybe I ought to f–king listen to her.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Prime\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nLopez dropped her “cinematic odyssey” alongside her ninth studio album, This Is Me … Now. The record served as a sequel to 2002’s This Is Me … Then, which was released during her first go at romance with Affleck. A documentary about the making of the film was also released, titled The Greatest Love Story Never Told.\n\nAffleck made cameos in both movies. While he was overall supportive of the project, also expressed his discomfort in being featured.\n\n“I did really find the beauty and the poetry and the irony in the fact that it’s the greatest love story never told,” he told the camera during the documentary. “If you’re making a record about it, that seems kind of like telling it.”\n\nCredit: Gotham/GC Images\n\nJuly 2024\n\nAmid news of the pair’s marital woes, a source exclusively told Us that Affleck and Lopez were “doing their own thing right now” and were “living separate lives.” However, a second insider noted that there was still a “sliver of hope” for reconciliation.\n\n“They are going through so much individually and as a couple,” a third source shared. “They may take some time to see if this complicated moment can resolve itself and they come back to each other [as] better people.”\n\nA different source later told Us that the couple were hoping to sell their shared home sooner rather than later. “They decided to list the house very recently, within the last week,” the insider explained. “They thought they could sell it off-market but made a game-time decision in order to put more eyes on the property. They are in a rush to sell it. Ben especially wants to be done with the house. He was never happy there.”"
