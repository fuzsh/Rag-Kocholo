Have an account? .\n\n\"Gigli\" costars Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck began dating in 2002 and officially split in January 2004.\n\nLopez confirmed their rekindled relationship in July 2021 and they wed in Las Vegas in July 2022.\n\nSpeculation about marriage strife has been rampant since early May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2001: Lopez and Affleck begin filming the movie \"Gigli.\"\n\nAffleck starred as the titular character, a mobster named Larry Gigli, and Lopez portrayed a gangster named Ricki.\n\nPredictably, their characters fell in love and ended up together by the conclusion of the critically panned movie.\n\nAt the time, Lopez was married to Cris Judd, her second husband (she was briefly married to Ojani Noa prior to that). She and Judd met on the set of her music video for \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" and wed in September 2001.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair for a feature released in March 2003, Affleck denied speculation that he and Lopez acted romantic with each other while she was married.\n\n\"When I met her we became really, really, really good friends,\" Affleck said.\n\nHe continued: \"But at first, because she was married, there was no thought of a romantic relationship, so that created the opportunity to get to know each other without any of the falseness that goes with courtship because you're trying to make a good impression.\"\n\nAffleck said that neither of them changed aspects of themselves, and they \"became really good friends in a way that was very comfortable.\"\n\n\"With Jen, I thought, Even though it can never happen, it was nice for me to know I was capable of feeling that way — that I could love somebody in a way where what I really wanted was for them to be happy, even more than I wanted what I wanted,\" he added. \"That was a new experience for me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 2002: Ben Affleck takes out ads in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, in which he gushes about working with Lopez on \"Gigli.\"\n\nAffleck wrote: \"You have shown kindness, dedication, diligence, humility, graciousness of spirit, beauty in courage, great empathy, astonishing talent, real poise and true grace...It has been nothing but an honor and a pleasure to work with you. I only wish I were lucky enough to be in all your movies.''\n\nHe also signed the ad: ''With love, respect and gratitude, Ben Affleck.''\n\nOf the big gesture, Affleck later told Vanity Fair that Lopez \"had developed this reputation as a diva and a pain in the ass,\" and he wanted to publicly voice his support of her and \"counteract\" that narrative.\n\n\"She works harder than anybody I've ever seen,\" he said. \"I thought I was busy with movies and television and writing; I felt pretty maxed out until I met her. She was doing all that and recording albums on weekends!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 2002: Lopez files for divorce from Judd, a month after breakup reports spread. She and Affleck go public with their relationship that summer.\n\nLopez cited irreconcilable differences as their reason for ending their marriage.\n\n\"Jennifer Lopez and Cris Judd have announced they have resolved all issues arising out of their marriage. The resolution was extremely amicable,\" their lawyer said in a statement shared by People.\n\nAffleck told Vanity Fair that he wasn't aware of marital issues between Lopez and Judd because she never mentioned it during their conversations.\n\n\"We would hang out, but I talked about me all the time: 'Enough about you!' I was vaguely aware she had something going on, but I was too busy running off my mouth,\" he said.\n\n\"It changed when she told me she was getting separated,\" Affleck said about when things changed between them. \"At that point, it became a possibility; doors were opened.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 5, 2002: Lopez releases her music video for \"Jenny From the Block,\" starring her and Affleck.\n\nThe music video drew inspiration from the couple's real-life experience of being scrutinized by the public and being hounded by paparazzi.\n\nIt showed them making out on a yacht and holding up a tabloid that included chatter about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat month, Lopez and Affleck are spotted filming their second movie together, \"Jersey Girl,\" in New York City and New Jersey.\n\nThe film was directed by Kevin Smith, who later said that he coined the term \"Bennifer\" — the couple's hybrid nickname. Smith said he gave Lopez and Affleck the moniker \"during 'Jersey Girl' pre-production, before the world found out they were dating.\"\n\nIn the movie, Lopez portrayed Affleck's wife who died while giving birth to their daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 11, 2002: Their engagement is confirmed during the couple's interview with Diane Sawyer as part of ABC's \"PrimeTime: Special Edition.\"\n\nThe couple spilled all the details on Affleck's \"traditional\" proposal and the custom-made, six-carat pink diamond engagement ring from Harry Winston.\n\n\"It's just a blanket, a quilt of rose petals, all over the whole entire house,\" Lopez said of the unexpected proposal that took place in Boston. \"So many candles, and vases, bouquets. And my song 'Glad' was playing ... I walk in and I was just overwhelmed. I wasn't expecting it, and I was just like 'Oh my God.'\"\n\nLopez said that she began \"sobbing\" as he read a handwritten letter listing the reasons he loved her and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. She got even more emotional when she saw the pink diamond, which was her favorite stone.\n\n\"I had cried a lot over sadness over the years,\" she said during the interview. \"And for the first time in my life, I cried incredible purging tears of happiness. It was the most cleansing feeling and the most wonderful feeling I had ever had.\"\n\nThe \"On the Floor\" singer also described Affleck as \"brilliantly smart…. Loving. Charming. Affectionate. And I just admire him in every way. I respect him. I feel like he teaches me things.\" crazy life and needing a sense of security.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 26, 2002: Lopez's third studio album is released, drawing inspiration from her relationship with Affleck.\n\n\"This Is Me... Then\" featured tracks like \"Jenny From the Block\" and \"All I Have.\" The album also included a song called \"Dear Ben,\" which was a love letter to the actor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFebruary 9, 2003: The couple attend the LA premiere of Affleck's film \"Daredevil.\"\n\nThe event took place at the Village Theatre in Los Angeles and the film was released on February 14.\n\nAffleck also posed on the red carpet with costars Colin Farrell, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Jennifer Garner — who he'd go on to marry.\n\nAt the time, Garner was married to \"Felicity\" costar Scott Foley. Their nuptials took place in October 2000 and Garner filed for divorce in May 2003. Foley later told TV Guide that there was no infidelity involved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 2003: In his Vanity Fair feature, Affleck says that Lopez made him a better person and he's excited to marry her.\n\n\"Jennifer is a really wonderful, fabulous woman, smart and interesting,\" he told the publication. \"Spending time with her makes me a better person and a happier person. She impresses me every day. It feels better to me to be with her than without her.\"\n\nHe added: \"Jen and I want to get married for the reason everyone else does: we fell in love. I'm in love; I want to have a family; and she's the only person I've ever met who made me entertain the thought of doing that.\"\n\nThe \"Gone Girl\" star said that he didn't understand the public's obsession with the relationship, but had an idea why people were so interested.\n\n\"I think it has to do with race and class, the fact that I'm white and she's Puerto Rican,\" he said. \"That's what's underneath, although nobody says it, because it's not politically correct.\"\n\nAffleck also said that people made incorrect assumptions about Lopez's romantic life because she was \"characterized as oversexed.\"\n\n\"Jen has had fewer boyfriends than your average high-school junior,\" he said. \"In the physical sense, she's extremely chaste.\"\n\nHe added: \"She's had a much simpler, more easily explainable, more clean romantic history than I have. She can tell the whole story in 15 minutes, whereas I always preface the whole story with 'It was complicated ...'\"\n\nAffleck also said that race was a factor, because \"there's a kind of language that's used about her — the spicy Latina, the tempestuous diva. She's characterized as oversexed.\"\n\n\"She's a deeply misunderstood woman, in my opinion,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 2003: The couple participates in a joint interview as a couple to promote \"Gigli,\" though many of the questions are about their romance.\n\nDuring the hourlong \"Dateline\" NBC special hosted by Pat O'Brien of \"Access Hollywood,\" the couple recalled not really knowing each other prior to working together on \"Gigli.\"\n\n\"We met at a couple of the parties,\" Lopez said. \"You know, we barely paid any attention to each other at all.\"\n\nLopez insisted that they were \"really good friends\" on the set of \"Gigli.\"\n\n\"We talked a lot and that's the thing,\" she said. \"There was no kind of idea that we would be together in the future, so it was one of those things where you kind of like say too much.\"\n\nShe added: \"It felt like we had good chemistry. He likes to improv. I could improv back. He's the best person to improv in the whole entire business, he's so funny.\"\n\nLopez also said that there wasn't an exact moment when they fell in love.\n\n\"You can't pinpoint it. It was like we became friends first, that is the honest-to-god truth,\" she said.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, the singer said that she'd maintain her surname professionally, but would technically take Affleck's last name.\n\nAffleck, a Boston native and vocal Red Sox fan, also said that he was opposed to their family being supporters of the New York Yankees — the team that originates in Lopez's hometown.\n\n\"The Mets is fine. I could put up with the Mets. The Mets I could live with,\" he said. \"Pinstripes can't be in the house.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAugust 1, 2003: \"Gigli\" is released in theaters and famously flops at the box office.\n\nIn the years that followed, Lopez spoke about the difficulties that followed.\n\n\"I think the worst, probably lowest point was the whole 'Gigli' era. It was pretty tough,\" she said in a 2015 interview with \"HuffPost Live,\" according to E! News.\n\n\"It was a very badly reviewed film,\" she elaborated. \"I was in a high-profile relationship at the time that fell apart in a really bad way, and so the kind of mix of those two things and the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment.\"\n\nShe added: \"I was in the tabloids every other week about how my life was falling apart. It was a tough time.\"\n\nDespite the hardships, Lopez said that she had \"no regrets.\"\n\n\"I would do it all over again, I think,\" she said. \"I really would.
