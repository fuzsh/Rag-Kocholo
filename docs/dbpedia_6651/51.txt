In 1962, while Lawrence of Arabia, To Kill a Mockingbird and Dr. No filled movie theaters from coast to coast, Gerald Peary ’64 was spending his undergraduate days on Rider’s Lawrenceville campus. At the same time, the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences was also in the midst of its first year after a reorganization of Rider’s academic model.

Fifty years later, the paths of Peary, the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the films of 1962 will once again cross on the Lawrenceville campus when Rider hosts An Evening with Author and Director Dr. Gerald Peary ’64 on Wednesday, February 29, in Sweigart Auditorium. Following a 5:15 p.m. reception, Peary, an internationally renowned critic and film historian, will present a screening of his acclaimed feature documentary, For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism, at 6:30, followed by a discussion at 7:30.

The event, part of the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences 50th Anniversary celebration, is sponsored by the College of Liberal Arts, Education, and Sciences; the Film and Media Studies Program; and the Department of English Cinema Studies concentration program.

Peary has had his articles on cinema appear in such newspapers as The Los Angeles Times, The Toronto Globe and Mail, The Chicago Tribune and The Boston Globe, as well as in film periodicals the world over, including Film Comment, Cineaste, Sight and Sound, and Positif. Since 1996, Peary has been a weekly film critic and columnist for the Boston Phoenix, and is a member of the Boston Society of Film Critics and the National Society of Film Critics. For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism is Peary’s first film.

An Evening with Author and Director Dr. Gerald Peary ’64 is part of the Film and Media Studies Program’s two day film symposium, 1962 at the Movies: A Mini-Course in Film Culture, on February 29 and March 1 in Sweigart Auditorium.

The symposium will feature film screenings, faculty roundtables, student/faculty presentation panels, a student film festival, and an address by noted film scholar and author Dr. Joe McElhaney of Hunter College, City University of New York. McElhaney’s talk, “Purely Geographical: Politics as Space and Movement in Advise and Consent,” will concentrate on the classic 1962 film directed by Otto Preminger and starring, among others, Henry Fonda and Charles Laughton.
