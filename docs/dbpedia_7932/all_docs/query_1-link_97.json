        "text": "A hundred years ago\n\nin a shelter near Pinsk...\n\na young girl ran off into the woods.\n\nHer father wanted her to marry a scholar\n\nfrom the Pinsker yeshiva...\n\nbut for some reason,\n\nmaybe she was a little crazy, who knows?\n\nShe didn't want to.\n\nAnyhow, she ran away.\n\n- She ran away from home?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nIt was in the middle of winter.\n\nShe wandered into the forest.\n\nAt first, no one at home\n\neven knew she ran away.\n\nThey thought she got lost\n\nin the snow somewhere and died.\n\nThey looked and looked for her,\n\nbut they never found her body.\n\nThey decided the wolves\n\nate her up.\n\nShh, Yossi, they'll hear us.\n\nYossi, they'll kill us\n\nif they find you here.\n\nNo, they'll just kill me. I'm your\n\nolder brother so it falls on me.\n\nI'm the only one around here\n\ngettin' killed.\n\nBut, Yossi,\n\nI love you more than anything.\n\nMore than Papa or lmma.\n\nMore than anything.\n\n- More than God?\n\n- A million times more.\n\nYou're a sinner! You're supposed to\n\nlove God above everything.\n\nAnd after that,\n\nyour father and mother.\n\nThe Torah doesn't even say anything\n\nabout brothers and sisters.\n\n- Then we'll add it in.\n\n- You can't add anything\n\nto the Torah, dunce!\n\nIs finished.\n\nIs the Word of God and thas that.\n\nNot even the greatest scholar\n\ncan change a letter of it.\n\nThen we'll write\n\nour own Torah.\n\nIt was the longest, hardest winter\n\nanyone could remember.\n\nThey sat shiva in Pinsk\n\nfor the girl who had disappeared.\n\nAnd everyone went on\n\nwith their business until one day...\n\njust as suddenly as she had disappeared,\n\nthe girl came back into town.\n\nShe was also, you know,\n\ncarrying a baby in her stomach.\n\nShe was pregnant.\n\nIn Pinsk, they said,\n\nshe got lost in the snow...\n\nand was saved by a demon\n\nwho made her his wife.\n\nThat spring the woman had a baby,\n\na baby girl.\n\n- They called her Yitta.\n\n- Baba Yitta?\n\nThas right. Our whole\n\nfamily's descended from Baba Yitta.\n\nIf you don't watch out,\n\nyou're gonna end up just like her.\n\nLike how?\n\nWhen she was real old and finally died,\n\nBaba Yitta went up to heaven.\n\nBut God didn't want her,\n\nso He sent her down to hell.\n\nBut when she got there,\n\nSatan recognized her as his niece.\n\nHe couldn't bring himself\n\nto make her suffer in hell...\n\nso he sent her back\n\nup here to our world...\n\nwhere she wanders the earth like Cain,\n\nalone forever.\n\nPoor Baba Yitta.\n\nDon't cry.\n\nRemember what day it is?\n\nHappy birthday.\n\nA ruby!\n\nI bought it from Papa's shop\n\nwith my savings.\n\nIs fake!\n\nIs the fake one Papa took out of\n\nthat ring. He was gonna throw it away.\n\n- Hey, what are you doing?\n\n- I'm going out to the lake.\n\nBut, Yossi,\n\nyou're not supposed to.\n\nImma says with your asthma\n\nyou could choke up and...\n\nI'm the only boy around here\n\nwho can't swim.\n\nI've been watching everybody else,\n\nand I know what to do.\n\nNo one's even gonna be there\n\nto see you swim.\n\nThey won't know you did it anyway,\n\nso whas the point?\n\nYou'll know.\n\nYossi!\n\nYossi!\n\nYossi!\n\nGood job.\n\nOkay, very good. Thas it. Come on.\n\nWonderful job, dear.\n\nWe'll take care of him.\n\nYou have a beautiful baby.\n\nYou were calling out\n\nthe name \"Yossi,\" Mrs. Horowitz.\n\nIs that the name\n\nyou'd like to give your son?\n\nSonia, ill be all right.\n\nSonia, where are you going?\n\nEasy, Sonia. You're turning my only\n\ngrandchild into a tube of toothpaste.\n\nHe's like a sacrifice.\n\nThey're gonna sacrifice my baby.\n\nIf your father, olov hasholem,\n\nwasn't already in his grave...\n\nyou would put him in it with\n\nthe spectacle you're making of yourself.\n\nShimmie's gonna be just fine.\n\nLook at those men.\n\nEvery one of them had the same\n\nthing, and they're perfectly normal.\n\nWell, not my baby, not today.\n\nHey, hey,\n\nwhere are you going?\n\nMy brother told me he married a smart\n\ngirl, he married a pretty girl...\n\nbut he never told me\n\nhe married such a chicken.\n\nBe proud, Sonia. This is the moment\n\nyour son becomes a Jew.\n\n- Bring up the boy, please.\n\n- No, wait.\n\nIs okay? You checked?\n\nIs sharp, no nicks or anything?\n\n- You checked?\n\n- Trust me.\n\nOkay, double check. Check again\n\nto make sure everything's okay.\n\nOh, is hot.\n\nIs like an oven in here.\n\nI don't want my son\n\ncooking in this oven.\n\nCan somebody open a window, please?\n\nYou've been coming to this shul\n\nfor 23 years. When was the last\n\ntime you saw an open window?\n\n- What kind of building for people\n\ndoesn't have an open window?\n\n- When was the last time?\n\nSonia, come on.\n\nCome on.\n\nShh.\n\nDon't you drop him.\n\nCareful.\n\nDon't any one of you\n\ndare drop him.\n\nNice girl you married.\n\nHow about the doors?\n\nMaybe somebody could open the door.\n\nMaybe we could get a draft.\n\nBaruch, maybe you could get us a draft.\n\n- A draft of what?\n\n- Air, Baruch! So my son\n\ndoesn't choke to death in this.\n\nI'm looking forward\n\nto knowing her better now that\n\nwe're going to be neighbors.\n\nI talked to Reb Fedder. You got the job\n\nteaching at the yeshiva in Boro Park.\n\nI already found you an apartment on 45th\n\nStreet. Is a stone's throw from by me.\n\nAnd the Rebbe?\n\nI'm going to be close to the Rebbe?\n\nThree blocks from the Rebbe's house.\n\nThas where you're gonna be.\n\nYou'll pray with the Rebbe, you'll hear\n\nthe Rebbe's fabrengen every shabbes.\n\n- You'll be up to your ears\n\nwith the Rebbe.\n\n- I, I don't know what to say.\n\nOnly that Sender Horowitz\n\nalways looks out for his family...\n\nespecially his favorite\n\nkid brother.\n\nMendel.\n\nIs easier if you don't watch.\n\nIf they can do it,\n\nI can watch it.\n\nAmen.\n\nIs fantastic!\n\nSo many different kinds of people.\n\n- Fantastic and not so fantastic.\n\n- Why not fantastic?\n\n- Lots of people, lots of influences.\n\n- They could be good influences.\n\nSometimes good,\n\nsometimes not so good.\n\nGo around, nu.\n\n- There's no room for a car to pass.\n\n- There's plenty of room for a car.\n\nUnfortunately we're not in a car.\n\nWe're in this ridiculous boat.\n\n- Is a station wagon.\n\n- Whoever heard of a station wagon\n\nfor three people?\n\n- You could fit a family\n\nof 12 in this thing.\n\n- God willing.\n\nSonia, I know you're still mad at me\n\nbecause I named Shimmie after the Rebbe.\n\nBut he's our first son...\n\nand I feel he should be invested with\n\nthe highest level of spirituality.\n\nWe can name our next boy Yossi.\n\nHmm?\n\nThe Rebbe.\n\nA few pennies, young rebbe.\n\nA little change for a woman...\n\nwho's been too long\n\non her tired feet.\n\n- But my wife has all our money.\n\n- Is been such a long time.\n\nFour years.\n\nSuch a long time.\n\nA thousand blessings\n\non your house.\n\nDon't worry, bubbie,\n\nit won't bite.\n\nBless you.\n\nFor what?\n\nIs the Rebbe.\n\nAnd so God picked that\n\nhumble, little mountain...\n\non which to present\n\nHis greatest gift.\n\nThe gift of His Torah.\n\nBut the question still remained:\n\nTo who was He going to give such a gift?\n\nSo God set out on a journey\n\nto find which amongst\n\nthe nations of the earth...\n\nwas worthy of receiving His Torah.\n\nGod went to the Goyim in Canaan\n\nand he asked them...\n\n\"Look what I have for you.\n\nIs the Torah.\n\n- Do you want my Torah?\"\n\n- No!\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nNo, no, not this.\n\nMaybe something lighter like\n\nthis sweet floral pattern here,"
