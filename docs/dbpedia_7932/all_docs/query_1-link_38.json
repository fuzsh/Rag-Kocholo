        "text": "April 17, 1998\n\nWeb posted at: 2:35 a.m. EDT (0635 GMT)\n\nFrom Reviewer Paul Tatara\n\n(CNN) -- If writer/director Boaz Yakin's new movie \"A Price Above Rubies\" were to establish itself as a box office contender (unfortunately, it looks more like the picture will be dying a quiet death), it would be one of the most controversial films of the past several years. Going in, I wasn't so sure I wanted to ride out yet another story about the inherent sensitivity and wisdom of traditional religious sects, but I was in for a shocking surprise.\n\nYakin, whose story concerns itself with the plight of a less-than-believing Hasidic woman (absolutely brilliantly played by Renee Zellweger), is suggesting that arrogance and self-righteousness can exist in any person, whether or not they're wholly committed to the teachings of their personal God and display the proper appearance of solemnity. I don't feel, as some people have suggested, that Yakin has some kind of ax to grind with Hasidic Jews, but he's certainly walking on thin ice with this movie. For lack of a better way of putting it, think of \"A Price Above Rubies\" as the anti-\"Witness.\"\n\nZellweger stars as Sonia Horowitz, a young woman who, as the story opens, is starting to question her duties in the New York Hasidic community. She's not very happy about what she considers to be the pointless circumcision of her newborn son, and she's surprisingly vocal about it ... even during the bris. Sonia eventually weathers the ceremony, but we can see that something is eating at her. Quite unexpectedly, when you consider the kid-gloves approach American movies usually adopt while dealing with religion, that something is the Hasidic community itself.\n\nOnce again, I can see how a person with completely good intentions might feel compelled to label this film anti-Semitic, but it's not as black and white as all that. As Sonia slowly grows disenchanted with her rather subservient lifestyle and her Torah scholar husband (Glenn Fitzgerald), we see a portrait of a modern woman who's questioning why her role in the world has already been assigned to her, no questions asked or expected. She starts to want things that her friends and family can't give her, and it tears at her heart. Then she receives an unexpected chance at freedom, and Yakin, once again, seems to be asking for trouble when you realize how she's going to get it.\n\nSonia was raised in a family that dealt in fine jewels, and her husband's brother (the darkly over-bearing Christopher Eccleston), seeing that she's chomping at the bit to journey away from her Brooklyn home, offers her a job as a buyer of fine jewelry in Manhattan. He also picks up on her repressed sexual situation, and takes advantage of her need to be comforted. In one truly disturbing scene, he practically rapes her against a wall, but Sonia clings to him as a chance for escape, or at least as a chance to see if there's anything to escape to.\n\nNo doubt about it, this is an odd little film, but Zellweger is so astonishing she manages to alleviate the often badly wavering tone of the storytelling, which alternates between harsh reality and some rather dopey visits from her dead brother. In the early going, Sonia is almost mute with despair. She can't find the words to describe her torment, nor a person in her world who would be willing to listen openly to her complaints. The pain has to register solely in her small voice and withdrawn posture, and Zellweger thoroughly embodies the character.\n\nThen, as if that isn't tough enough, she has to pull off Sonia's conflicted emotions when she starts establishing herself as a working woman while simultaneously carrying on a demeaning sexual relationship with her brother-in-law. Add onto that the concept that she knows her newfound freedom is pulling her away from a religious mindset that had previously ruled her life, and you've got yourself one terribly complex character.\n\nYakin, admittedly, gets a little bit kooky when Sonia meets a young jewelry designer and tries to start a new business with him. This section of the movie seems to be a manual on how to achieve spirituality through fine necklaces. But things eventually calm down and you can focus once again on Zellweger's gentle inventiveness. I liked her a lot in \"Jerry Maguire,\" but I never could have imagined that she had this kind of performance in her. I know it's way early in the game to be writing something like this, but I can't imagine I'll see a more fulfilling performance from an actress this year. The movie may be a little cloudy in a lot of ways, but Zellweger shines through.\n\nBravo, Renee. It's work like this that keeps me from giving up hope on where our movies are heading. Now, bring on Godzilla.\n\n\"A Price Above Rubies\" is bound to be taken the wrong way by some people. There's a couple of very cold, almost brutal sex scenes, and quite a bit of religious questioning. Many viewers could find it offensive, but even the movie suggests that an open mind is the best answer. Sonia's uncomprehending husband is not portrayed as a monster, by any means. Rated R. 117 minutes."
