        "text": "Miramax, LLC (also known as Miramax Films) is an American entertainment company known for distributing independent and foreign films. For its first 14 years the company was owned by its founders, Harvey and Bob Weinstein. In 1993, the company was acquired by the Walt Disney Company and held until 2010. In 2005, the brothers founded the Weinstein Company.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 1993, Miramax was purchased for $60 million by the Walt Disney Company. Harvey and Bob Weinstein continued to operate Miramax until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax independently of other Disney companies. Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax could release (Fahrenheit 9/11, Kids, and Dogma are examples). Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment division releases Miramax output.\n\nMiramax operated until 2005, where the label Dimension Films began specializing in genre films and created the Spy Kids, Scream, and Scary Movie film franchises.\n\nAfter extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution of Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore. Disney's film studio consortium, Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group assumed control of Miramax, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company called simply The Weinstein Company, and took the Dimension Films label with them. The Miramax name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax was taken over by Daniel Battsek, who formerly was head of Buena Vista International in the UK. Battsek refocused Miramax to produce films of high quality but low budget. Canadian independent studio Maple Pictures held the rights to distribute Miramax films from 2008 up until August 10, 2011 when Maple Pictures was acquired by Alliance Films.\n\nOn October 3, 2009, Disney announced that the staff of Miramax was to be reduced by 70%, and the number of releases would be reduced by half to just three films per year. The label's marketing, distribution and administrative functions, which had operated independently, would be folded into the parent studio in Burbank. The move became effective in January 2010. On October 30, 2009, Disney announced the resignation of Daniel Battsek as President of Miramax Films, effective when the transition from the studio in New York City to Burbank was completed.The company merged its operations with Walt Disney Studios on January 28, 2010, shutting down Miramax's separate New York and Los Angeles offices.\n\nThough Disney Studio Chairman Dick Cook was a staunch supporter of Miramax, the brand was less of a priority for Bob Iger, whose strategy was to focus on Disney's branded mass entertainment that can be exploited across Disney's theme parks, television and consumer products. Following Disney's $4-billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2010, and Cook was succeeded by Rich Ross. As a result, Miramax was relegated to the status of distribution label. The company confirmed that it was looking into the selling the Miramax label on February 9, 2010, with Bob Iger explaining, \"We determined that continuing to invest in new Miramax movies wasn't necessarily a core strategy of ours\".\n\nOn November 23, 2010, it was reported that Google was interested in purchasing the digital rights to the Miramax library to improve the premium content offerings on YouTube, and compete with similar services such as Hulu and Netflix.\n\nOn December 3, 2010, Disney closed the sale of Miramax for US $663 million to Filmyard Holdings, an investment group. The sale included 700 film titles, as well as books, development projects and the \"Miramax\" name. Mike Lang, the former News Corporation business development executive who was selected as the CEO of Miramax, indicated that the company would focus on their existing library.\n\nAfter the sale was closed, some movies already developed at Miramax, including The Tempest and Gnomeo & Juliet, were eventually released by Disney under its Touchstone Pictures banner, and theatrical distribution of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and The Debt has been shifted to FilmDistrict and Focus Features respectively.\n\nIn March 2016, Qatari entertainment company beIN Media Group acquired Miramax. On December 20, 2019, ViacomCBS acquired 49% stake in Miramax (whilst beIN retained 51% stake in the company) for at least $375 million, with Paramount announcing exclusive agreements to distribute their library and co-produce their upcoming content.[1]\n\nFilms[]\n\n1993[]\n\nTom and Jerry: The Movie (US theatrical release only)\n\nJust Another Girl on the I.R.T.\n\nMap of the Human Heart\n\nThe Innocent\n\nThe Night We Never Met\n\nDeception\n\nFarewell My Concubine\n\nThe Piano\n\n1994[]\n\nBullets Over Broadway\n\nCamilla\n\nClerks\n\nThe Crow\n\nExotica\n\nFresh\n\nHeavenly Creatures\n\nLittle Buddha\n\nLoaded\n\nMother's Boys\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nQueen Margot\n\nReady to Wear\n\nRoyal Deceit\n\nSirens\n\nStrawberry and Chocolate\n\nThrough the Olive Trees\n\nTom & Viv\n\n1995[]\n\nA Month by the Lake\n\nSmoke\n\nBlue in the Face\n\nCry, The Beloved Country\n\nThe Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain\n\nFour Rooms\n\nVictory\n\nFresa y Chocolate\n\nGeorgia\n\nHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (released by Dimension Films)\n\nIl Postino: The Postman\n\nKids\n\nDead Man\n\nLie Down with Dogs\n\nMighty Aphrodite\n\nMoondance\n\nMuriel's Wedding\n\nPicture Bride\n\nPriest\n\nRestoration\n\nRunaway Brain (2015 Disney Movies Anywhere reissue only)\n\nThe Crossing Guard\n\nThe Crude Oasis\n\nThe Glass Shield\n\nThe Road Killers\n\nCountry Life\n\nThe Thief and the Cobbler\n\nThings to Do in Denver When You're Dead\n\nTwo Bits\n\nUnzipped\n\n1996[]\n\nBeautiful Girls\n\nScream (released by Dimension Films)\n\nThe NeverEnding Story III: Escape from Fantasia\n\nBasquiat\n\nSling Blade\n\nBrassed Off\n\nCaptives\n\nChungking Express\n\nCitizen Ruth\n\nCosì\n\nEmma\n\nEveryone Says I Love You\n\nMarvin's Room\n\nTrainspotting\n\nFlirting with Disaster\n\nFrench Twist\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn (released by Dimension Films)\n\nHellraiser: Bloodline\n\nJane Eyre\n\nFaithful (co-production with New Line Cinema, Price Entertainment and Savoy Pictures)\n\nOf Love and Shadows\n\nMicrocosmos\n\nA Midsummer Night's Dream\n\nMiracle at Oxford\n\nRidicule\n\nShall We Dance?\n\nThe Crow: City of Angels\n\nThe English Patient (winner of the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress (Juliette Binoche))\n\nThe Journey of August King\n\nThe Pallbearer\n\nThe Star Maker\n\nUnhook the Stars\n\nDon't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\n\nSwingers\n\n1997[]\n\nAddicted to Love\n\nAlbino Alligator\n\nChasing Amy\n\nCop Land\n\nGood Will Hunting\n\nShades of Fear\n\nThe House of Yes\n\nJackie Brown\n\nLove Serenade\n\nMimic\n\nMouth to Mouth\n\nMrs. Brown\n\nThe Rage\n\nRhyme & Reason\n\nRobinson Crusoe\n\nShe's So Lovely\n\nSqueeze\n\nThe Substance of Fire\n\nThe Wings of the Dove\n\nWelcome to Sarajevo\n\nChildren of Heaven\n\n1998[]\n\n54\n\nThe Big One\n\nA Price Above Rubies\n\nCelebrity\n\nAll I Wanna Do\n\nDown in the Delta\n\nEverest IMAX\n\nFirelight\n\nHav Plenty\n\nHeaven\n\nJerry and Tom\n\nLife is Beautiful\n\nLittle City\n\nLittle Voice\n\nMonument Ave.\n\nNext Stop Wonderland\n\nPhantoms\n\nPlaying by Heart\n\nTelling You\n\nRide\n\nRounders\n\nSenseless (co-production with Dimension Films)\n\nShakespeare in Love (winner of the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actress (Gwyneth Paltrow))\n\nSince You've Been Gone\n\nSliding Doors\n\nSmoke Signals\n\nSummer Fling\n\nSweet Revenge\n\nTalk of Angels\n\nThat's the Way I Like It\n\nThe Mighty\n\nThe Truce\n\nThe Very Thought of You\n\nVelvet Goldmine\n\nWide Awake\n\n1999[]\n\nA Walk on the Moon\n\nAn Ideal Husband\n\nB.
