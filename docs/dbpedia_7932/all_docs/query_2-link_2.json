Many, many people have offered intellectual and emotional support throughout the process. Gigi Durham, Richard Lewis, Neil Nehring, Horace Newcomb, Janet Staiger, Joe Straubhaar, Sharon Strover, and Craig Watkins provided early guidance. I could not have made it through the Austin phase of this project without margarita and movie breaks with Kyle and Lisa Barnett, Karen Gustafson, Lars and Aisha Hagen, Caroline Frick, Jennie Phillips, Gabe Rupertus, Lisa Hartenberger Toby, Valerie Wee, and Kate and Alex Wurm. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, I spent my summers in Los Angeles, expanding my knowledge of Hollywood production and distribution practices. My personal and professional exchanges with several individuals enriched these trips. Particular thanks go to Tony Bacigalupi, Kevin and Anne Carney, Tanya and Don Chmielewski, Tom Cunha, Josh Hall, Rahbeka Harris, Tristan and Mark Hartmann, Jennifer Holt, Lucy Huang, Kuang Lee, Meika Loe, Chris Nance, Anh Nguyen, Sunny Nguyen, Dana Ritter, Lise and Shervin Samimi, Heidi Santillan, Karen Santillan, Mike and Carie Tolfo, and Tony Yee for much-needed lodging, friendship, and Ultimate Frisbee breaks during my California ventures. My work has benefited from the array of viewpoints available in the Department of Communication at Georgia State University. I would especially like to thank David Cheshier, Kathy Fuller-Seeley, and Greg Smith for fielding numerous questions and offering helpful advice. In addition, I am appreciative of the assistance I received from a number of graduate students. Noel Kirkpatrick, Ian Peters, Karen Petruska, Eric Dewberry, and Shane Toepfer aided me on many an occasion by gathering images, checking citations, and performing many other vital tasks as I prepared to send this book to press. Jim Burr at the University of Texas Press has been a kind and generous editor, and I am thrilled to have had the chance to work with him on this project. L. S. Kim, Christina Lane, P. David Marshall, Joanne Morreale, and Susan Dirks all have provided valued counsel over the years. Exchanges\n\nperren pages.indd 9\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nwith Michael Newman, Yannis Tzioumakis, and Justin Wyatt helped me think through many of my arguments and ideas. I am grateful for Paul McDonald’s attention to detail in reading the manuscript; his suggestions improved it immensely. No single person has had a bigger impact on my development as a scholar—and the shape of this project—than Tom Schatz. He has pushed me to be a better writer, thinker, and teacher. I cannot thank him enough for the mentorship and encouragement he has provided for well over a decade. Jennifer Holt and Caroline Frick must be thanked (and then thanked again) for being such fantastic friends and colleagues. They have been there whenever I needed them, and I feel extremely lucky for that. I am incredibly fortunate to have had Cully Hamner come into my life as this project neared completion; he has stood by me patiently as I labored through the revision process. Finally, special thanks must go to my parents, Steve and Diane. They have always been there for me in every imaginable way, and thus I dedicate this book to them.\n\nx\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 10\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nIndie, Inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 11\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nc h a p t e r\n\no n e\n\nFinding a Niche in the 1990s\n\nThe major studios are the big American Army. . . . If we went straight up against them, they would nuke us. We’re the guerillas. We snipe and we hit and we win a few battles, then we retreat. We’re good at being niche players. We don’t want to grow up and be another Walt Disney. Bob Weinstein, 1989\n\nAs moguls and minions awoke and rubbed the Oscar-party grit out of their eyes, the talk was about how Miramax had pulled it off. Talk, that is, and a whole lot of sniping. Los Angeles Times, March 1999\n\nI\n\nn 1989, Miramax cochair Bob Weinstein employed military imagery to underscore his company’s marginal position relative to the Hollywood studios. In 1999, the press mobilized similar imagery to present the company as an oppressive force in the film business. Nowhere was the dramatic shift in Miramax’s image and industrial position more evident than on the morning after the 1999 Academy Awards ceremony. It was on this occasion that Amy Wallace of the Los Angeles Times reported on Miramax’s surprising Best Picture Oscar win for Shakespeare in Love (1998). From the perspective of Wallace, along with many others in the industry and press, Miramax had effectively deployed its marketing acuity and the extensive resources of its parent company, Disney, to secure this award. In the process, however, Miramax had further fueled the growing antipathy toward its business practices. Wallace was not the only one to ask whether Miramax had “cynically shanghaied the acad-\n\nperren pages.indd 1\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nemy, forever changing the way studios will have to play the game of Oscar pursuit.”1 If anyone was feeling “shanghaied” on the day after the 1999 Academy Awards ceremony, it was DreamWorks SKG cofounders Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. Initially everything seemed to be going in their young company’s favor. It was only DreamWorks’s second year distributing films, and the company had managed to garner a number of Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director nods for Saving Private Ryan (1998). To many, the film looked to be a shoo-in for the awards; to Katzenberg and Spielberg, these awards would confer legitimacy on their nascent company. Yet, on the eve of the Oscars, DreamWorks faced the unpleasant possibility of Miramax’s Shakespeare in Love taking home Best Picture honors. This could not help but sting Katzenberg in particular, since earlier in the decade he had been instrumental in his role as chairman of Walt Disney Studios in negotiating the acquisition of Miramax. This deal enabled the small independent film distributor to attain the resources it needed to produce, distribute, and market such Oscar-worthy fare as Shakespeare in Love. Though brothers Bob and Harvey established Miramax in 1979, their company did not become an attractive acquisition target for Disney and other media conglomerates until more than a decade later. In fact, Miramax began its rapid ascent only after most other 1980s-era independent distributors declared bankruptcy. Following a string of critical and financial hits that included Scandal (1989), sex, lies, and videotape (1989), My Left Foot (1989), and Cinema Paradiso (1990), the company drew the interest of the press and industry. During the early 1990s, Miramax continued to build on its reputation and differentiate its product from that of the major studios through its North American distribution of such acclaimed films as The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover (1990), Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990), and The Grifters (1990).2 Katzenberg was among those who took an interest in the company at this time. In the wake of Miramax’s widely heralded marketing of the $62 million– earner The Crying Game (1992), he aggressively sought to make it part of the Magic Kingdom. Katzenberg convinced the Weinsteins to bring the company into the Disney fold, buying Miramax for what came to be considered a bargain-basement price of approximately $60 million.3 Over the next several years, Katzenberg’s foresight was borne out, as Miramax distributed one hit after another with a release slate that included a range of edgy American indies, low-budget genre franchises, English-language imports, and foreign-language films. The company reaped hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office while also attract2\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 2\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\ning critical acclaim, top awards, and creative talent. Films such as Pulp Fiction (1994), Clerks (1994), Il Postino (1995), Scream (1996), The English Patient (1996), Good Will Hunting (1997), and Life Is Beautiful (1998) were among the company’s most profitable and high-profile investments. By the end of the 1990s, the Miramax-Disney relationship had helped alter the structure of the industry, the marketing of low-budget films, and motion picture aesthetics. Miramax peaked with Shakespeare in Love. This film’s 1999 Oscar victory both reaffirmed Miramax’s status as one of the key distributors of niche-targeted films in the 1990s and confirmed that the company had effectively honed its marketing skills. Indeed, that film’s Best Picture nod reinforced Miramax’s central role in reshaping the film industry and redefining production, distribution, and marketing practices throughout the decade. Reassessing Miramax, Rethinking the Hollywood-Independent Relationship\n\nMost prior examinations of Miramax have focused primarily on the company’s role in distributing a certain strand of edgy, low-budget, “quality” American films, such as sex, lies, and videotape, Clerks, Pulp Fiction, Sling Blade (1996), and Good Will Hunting. This book takes a different approach. It is certainly the case that throughout the 1990s, Miramax was the most publicized and profitable distributor of low-budget, critically acclaimed indie films originating from the United States. It is also the case that the company was the most consistent in acquiring and releasing films that expanded beyond a core art-house crowd to attract a wider audience.4 But such conceptualizations of Miramax prove far too limited. This book explores Miramax’s economic, cultural, and creative impact on the film industry more broadly. Rather than seeing the company as simply making a narrow strand of “artier” movies accessible to a wider audience, Indie, Inc. illustrates how Miramax, under the ownership of Disney, played a major role in transforming Hollywood during the 1990s. Though it began as an independent distribution company, Miramax quickly evolved to be far more than that. With the support of Disney, it developed into the preeminent contemporary specialty or indie division, involved in distributing niche-oriented films that appealed to demographic groups ranging from teenagers to baby boomers, African Americans to Latinos. When appropriate, Miramax certainly exploited discourses of independence that appealed to those possessing greater cultural capital. Indeed, employing such strategies aided the company as\n\nFinding a Niche in the 1990s 3\n\nperren pages.indd 3\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nit cultivated one of the most recognizable brand identities in contemporary film. Though its roots may have been in the independent film world, and it readily tapped into those discourses as needed, the company should not be seen solely in terms of how it “made independent film mainstream.” To do so is to minimize the company’s more wide-ranging impact on film festivals, acquisitions, production budgets, distribution, marketing, exhibition, talent development, and multimedia exploitation, along with its influence on critical and cultural discourses about “independence” and the “mainstream.” Through its business practices and press relations, Miramax contributed to ever-shifting notions about terms such as independence, indie, and Indiewood. These notions, in turn, fed into broader critical, journalistic, and scholarly discussions about the boundaries of both independent and Hollywood film. As the first independent distributor to be acquired by a global media conglomerate in the 1990s, Miramax gained a head start on other companies. Disney’s deep pockets, combined with the Weinsteins’ aggressive behavior, enabled Miramax to play a dominant part in shaping the rapidly expanding specialty film business. Subsequently, every other major media conglomerate emulated—and responded to—Miramax’s practices by launching their own specialty division or acquiring an existing independent distribution company. By the start of the new millennium, each major studio had developed at least one division modeled largely on Miramax’s production and distribution strategies. This move signaled a major structural transformation, as indie divisions became the primary means through which conglomerates financed, produced, and distributed a diverse range of niche-oriented films. By 2000, News Corp. had Fox Searchlight, Vivendi Universal had Universal Focus,5 Time Warner had New Line and Fine Line, Viacom had Paramount Vantage, and Sony had Sony Pictures Classics and Screen Gems.6 Though the names and scope of these divisions shifted over time, all the major media corporations continued to allocate substantial resources to indie subsidiaries through most of the first decade of the 2000s. This investment indicated the conglomerates’ recognition of the potential economic and cultural value of niche films. During this specific historical moment, such divisions came to be seen as vital sites in which to develop fresh talent, take creative risks, and experiment with new business models—much more so than the conglomerates’ mass-market distribution arms. To study the rise and fall of Miramax, then, is to study Hollywood in transition. Such an approach demands balancing an examination of Miramax with a discussion of developments taking place both with media conglomerates’ motion picture divisions and with those distributors that 4\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 4\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nremained unaffiliated with major corporations. Such an approach also necessitates blending an analysis of one company’s business strategies and marketing practices with journalistic and critical discourses about that company and its films. Further, such an approach requires that one remain attentive to the most notable formal-aesthetic attributes of the films released both by Miramax and by its main competitors. In integrating industrial, discourse, and aesthetic analysis, my study can be situated within the emerging field of media industry studies.7 This field blends political economy’s critical approach to the production and distribution of culture with cultural studies’ concern with the power struggles that occur over the value of and meanings within specific texts.8 Media industry studies’ call for historical specificity and its emphasis on empirical research make it a productive means through which to conduct an analysis of Miramax and its practices. The use of a media industry studies framework differentiates this book from others that have examined either contemporary Hollywood or independent film. Most recent scholarship on Hollywood has taken a political economic approach; scholars such as Janet Wasko, Thomas Schatz, Paul McDonald, and Jennifer Holt have effectively mapped out broad changes in ownership and control in the media industries during the conglomerate era, especially in the film sector.9 Such work helps to place Miramax’s activities within a broader context, reinforcing that the Weinsteins were not “visionaries” who, through sheer force of will and a belief in the power of cinema, created new markets where none had existed before. As attractive as such romantic notions may be, political economists remind us that we must bear in mind that Miramax emerged out of specific industrial conditions. The company and its executives exploited these conditions quite effectively for a time. But the belief that they were immune to larger economic, technological, cultural, and institutional shifts contributed to the Weinsteins’ departure from Miramax in 2005 and to the division’s subsequent downsizing by Disney. Research on the political economy of Hollywood reminds us that, even at its peak profitability in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Miramax remained a relatively small division within one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. For example, in 1998, the year that Miramax released such box office hits as Halloween H20 and Rounders, and Good Will Hunting and Scream 2 completed their theatrical runs, the company grossed $393 million domestically and earned a 5.81 percent market share.10 In comparison, Disney films such as Armageddon, A Bug’s Life, Mulan, and Enemy of the State helped it gross more than $1.1 billion and lead the industry with a 16.37 percent market share that same year.11\n\nFinding a Niche in the 1990s 5\n\nperren pages.indd 5\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nMiramax’s income may never have come close to that generated by Disney’s primary film distribution arm, but this does not diminish the value of a case study of the subsidiary. Miramax, along with other indie divisions, had a substantive financial impact on both niche-oriented filmmaking specifically and Hollywood’s business practices more generally. At the same time that conglomerates invested more heavily in indie divisions, their primary motion picture arms increasingly focused their efforts on releasing big-budget event films such as Batman (1989), Jurassic Park (1993), Twister (1996), and Godzilla (1998).12 Thus the development and expansion of separate indie divisions, with their own distinct production, distribution, marketing, and exhibition practices, signaled the conglomerates’ reassessment of their corporate structures and allocation of resources. Though on the surface it might seem paradoxical, the rise of Miramax and other indie subsidiaries can be seen as intersecting with the global media conglomerates’ increasing focus on producing and distributing niche products to specific demographic groups. This places Miramax’s growth and expansion within the context of a shift from a model of mass production and consumption that dominated until the 1970s, and toward a late twentieth-century model of specialization and “justin-time” production and consumption.13 The shift in emphasis should not suggest that conglomerates ceased developing films for a mass audience—in fact, as the examples above show, quite the opposite is the case. Instead, the key point here is that these conglomerates restructured their operations in a way that shifted the production and distribution of a large number of niche-oriented films to separate subsidiaries. Significantly, a heightened emphasis on niche targeting was evident not only in conglomerates’ investment in indie subsidiaries, but also in their acquisition and creation of niche-oriented cable and broadcast networks (e.g., Fox, UPN, IFC, Sundance Channel). Political economic approaches to Hollywood have skillfully provided broad surveys of industry practices and patterns. One limitation of this approach, however, is that at times it downplays the contributions that individuals— or specific films— can have. Through providing a case study of a single division of one media conglomerate, especially one discussed as frequently in the media as Miramax, we are able to balance the “top-down” concerns of political economy with the “bottom-up” perspective of cultural studies. By focusing primarily on Miramax, it is easier to see the complexity involved in cultural production. The notion circulated in cruder forms of political economy that media conglomerates are monolithic entities in their operations or output quickly gets disproven.14 6\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 6\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nA case study of Miramax also proves valuable because many critics and scholars have viewed its films as important not only economically, but also culturally and creatively. As the analysis of the media coverage offered throughout this book illustrates, the attention paid to the indie film sector was disproportionate to its economic impact. Certainly the growing profitability of indie film contributed to heightened media attention, but this was not the only reason Miramax and its films generated so much press. As it developed, expanded, and diversified, Miramax figured prominently in broader debates and struggles over cultural power. From the time of its purchase by Disney through its release of such films as Kids (1995), Priest (1995), and Dogma (1999), Miramax was central to discussions about authenticity, autonomy, and creative freedom. When convenient, the company exploited such discourses for the purposes of marketing and product differentiation. When inconvenient, Miramax downplayed its involvement with certain films (e.g., genre films such as The Crow [1994] and Hellraiser IV: Bloodline [1996], released by its Dimension label). Often in response to activities by Miramax, a range of stakeholders—including journalists, critics, festival planners, executives, representatives of award-granting organizations, and filmmakers— engaged in debates about what constituted “independent” or “indie” film. As Michael Newman notes, these discourses were highly ideological in nature.15 The need to demarcate boundaries over what constituted independent film became connected to particular taste cultures linked by background and education.16 Those participating in such conversations often had very personal investments in what criteria were— or were not—used to identify a film as independent or indie. Recent scholarship on contemporary low-budget film has integrated economic, cultural, and aesthetic analyses productively. In fact, a significant body of work has developed on what variably has been labeled independent or indie film. There is no agreed-on definition of what constitutes either; indeed, how each of these terms is used depends on a given writer’s focus or objectives. In the last two decades, both the popular press and scholars frequently have used independent and indie interchangeably. Of course, this has only contributed to the confusion about the meaning of each label—a confusion that has often served the desires of media companies in promoting their films to particular groups as “hip,” “edgy,” and “cool.” As Newman observes, “indie” gained increasing cachet from the 1980s onward. The word’s appeal expanded as it became more closely linked to a particular subculture of white, male, upper-middle-class tastes in music and fashion.17 Despite the lack of agreement and consistency in scholars’ and jour-\n\nFinding a Niche in the 1990s 7\n\nperren pages.indd 7\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nnalists’ use of these terms, as I have noted elsewhere,18 among the most common criteria used to define a film as independent include the following: its source of financing;19 the industrial affiliations of its distributor;20 the sites in which it is exhibited;21 the status of its talent in relation to Hollywood;22 and the “spirit” of the film (usually interpreted to mean its aesthetic or generic ties to commercial or alternative media traditions).23 In American Independent Cinema, Geoff King surveys a variety of different ways that films can be perceived to be independent, identifying a range of industrial, narrative, formal, genre-based, and ideological-political criteria.24 Given Indie, Inc.’s industrial emphasis, a film or company will be described by me as independent if it is unaffiliated with a major media conglomerate. If a conglomerate has an investment in it, I label it an indie. Thus, following its purchase by Disney, the formerly independent distributor Miramax became an indie division. This book focuses primarily on Miramax during its time under Disney’s control. As will be explored in the following pages, though Miramax began as an independent distributor, it always operated quite differently from most of its 1980s-era competitors. In fact, it functioned as a de facto indie division even before Disney acquired it. Conglomerate resources simply enabled it to realize its objectives more fully. Although it is important to make the distinction between “indie” and “independent” to clarify my own analytical framework, a key focus of this book involves following the varied ways that the press, critics, and industry employed these and other labels to discuss niche-oriented films throughout the 1990s. In this manner, I adhere to the approach taken by Yannis Tzioumakis, who examines independent cinema “as a discourse that expands and contracts when socially authorized institutions (filmmakers, industry practitioners, trade publications, academics, film critics, and so on) contribute toward its definition at different periods in the history of American cinema.”25 In American Independent Cinema: An Introduction, Tzioumakis traces the different ways that discourses of independence have been activated throughout U.S. film history. He provides a corrective for those who believe that independent film is a relatively recent development. As his book functions largely as a survey of the fluid independent-Hollywood relationship during the twentieth century, Tzioumakis offers only a cursory examination of the evolution and expansion of indie film during the 1990s. Tzioumakis is one of many individuals writing about American independent cinema who argue that a series of institutional, economic, and cultural shifts begun during the 1970s laid the foundation for the rise of 1990s-era indie divisions.26 Others, including Geoff King, Emanuel 8\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 8\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nLevy, John Pierson, and John Berra, similarly see 1990s-era indie films as direct descendants of earlier independents. In particular, each draws a relationship between the releases of art house– oriented independent distributors (e.g., Island/Alive, Skouras, Cinecom) and “classics divisions” (e.g., United Artists Classics, Orion Classics, 20th Century-Fox International Classics) of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and those distributed by specialty divisions such as Miramax, Fox Searchlight, and Focus Features in the 1990s and 2000s. Though there certainly are connections between the films, executives, and practices of independent distributors of these two eras, it is important not to overstate these linkages. (Chapter 4 elaborates on the cultural, aesthetic, and industrial distinctions between 1980s-era independents and 1990s-era indies.) In fact, there is a danger in drawing connections between independents of the 1980s and those of the 1990s. Frequently, the 1980s-era independent films, filmmakers, and distributors are positioned as more “authentic” because they are seen as being more removed from Hollywood industrially, politically, and aesthetically. Such an approach risks minimizing the long and complicated relationship between Hollywood and independents, implying that the two are diametrically opposed in terms of politics, style, and content.27 Value judgments are frequently made by those who view the rise of indies as a move away from a particular strand of 1980s-era, art house– oriented independents and toward Hollywood practices and conventions. More specifically, commerce is seen to be overriding art as “outsiders” are incorporated into the system, and the vibrancy and vitality of independent film is seen as being depoliticized and homogenized in the process. Divisions such as Miramax are viewed as exploiting the rhetoric of independence when in practice they serve as little more than marketing arms for media conglomerates. In terminology that often echoes Horkheimer and Adorno, indie divisions are viewed as “brands” that exploit naive or gullible consumers with their vacuous products.28 Nowhere is this attitude more evident than in the journalist Peter Biskind’s Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film.29 In this book, Biskind chronicles the rise of Miramax, the Sundance Film Festival, and, to a lesser extent, the independent distributor October Films. He begins with the 1989 premiere of sex, lies, and videotape at Sundance and the film’s subsequent acquisition by Miramax, and concludes with the Weinsteins’ struggles with Martin Scorsese over the pricey, bloated Gangs of New York (2002). Down and Dirty Pictures was designed as a follow-up to Biskind’s earlier best seller, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, which chronicles the rise of\n\nFinding a Niche in the 1990s 9\n\nperren pages.indd 9\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nthe Hollywood Renaissance in the late 1960s and tracks the careers of the film school– educated “movie brat” generation (Scorsese, Coppola, Cimino, Spielberg, etc.).30 The reverential tone that Biskind uses toward baby boomer filmmakers in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls is replaced with a sense of disdain in Down and Dirty Pictures toward what I discuss in chapter 4 as the “cinema of cool”—a group of mostly self-educated Gen Xers that includes Kevin Smith, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez.31 In addition, in the latter book, Biskind focuses far less on the textual characteristics of the films, thereby implying that most of these films are scarcely worthy of serious consideration. Inasmuch as he discusses the films themselves, they are often seen as empty exercises in style over substance, paling in comparison to both the Hollywood Renaissance films and the “truly” independent films of the 1980s. Such independents, directed by filmmakers like Jim Jarmusch, John Sayles, Wayne Wang, Susan Seidelman, and Spike Lee, are discussed in chapter 4 as part of a “cinema of quality” that can be contrasted to the later “cinema of cool.” In a statement that reflects the attitude he takes throughout the book, Biskind declares that “the triumph of sex, lies over Do the Right Thing ratified the turn away from the angry, topical strain of the indie movement that had its roots in the 1960s and 1970s toward the milder aesthetic of the slacker era.”32 Whereas in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls Biskind depicted art and commerce combining for a brief moment to yield politically charged, creatively inspired films worthy of respect, in Down and Dirty Pictures he suggests that commerce trumped art before a truly great American cinema on par with that of the 1970s could be realized. He places most of the “blame” for the missed opportunities squarely on the shoulders of Miramax, and in particular on Harvey Weinstein. Rather than supporting auteurs with strong social realist visions (e.g., James Mangold, James Gray) or avant-garde tendencies (e.g., Bernardo Bertolucci, Todd Haynes), Biskind suggests that Weinstein intervened in a manner that harmed these individuals’ films and careers.33 Concurrently, he argues, Miramax became ever more focused on releasing a combination of amoral, Tarantino-esque product (which he portrays as the triumph of the “tastes of the barbarians”),34 lowbrow genre fare in the vein of Scary Movie (2000) (at one point, he describes Miramax’s Dimension genre division as a “roach motel”),35 and sentimental, middlebrow Euro-American “kitsch” like Chocolat (2000).36 From Biskind’s perspective, Weinstein’s desire to be a modern-day David O. Selznick—a creative producer who took an active role in shaping projects from inception to final cut— combined with his obsession with market research, not only hurt filmmakers and 10\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 10\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\ntheir films but also influenced the direction that indie film took from the mid-1990s onward. Perhaps because he is so dismissive of the films released by Miramax following its purchase by Disney, Biskind expends little effort analyzing them. Instead, he focuses almost exclusively on the ways that select individuals in the indie world—in particular Harvey Weinstein—screwed over everyone and anyone. The book strings together a series of ugly anecdotes about the backroom machinations of the Weinsteins and Robert Redford. Biskind culled such tales from the dozens of interviews he conducted with countless disgruntled filmmakers, former employees, and direct competitors of Miramax and Sundance. Through this “cult of personality” approach, Down and Dirty Pictures certainly offers plenty of juicy gossip about the conflicts and confrontations that transpired between Miramax executives and others in the indie film business. For that reason, the book is an enjoyable read for those wanting to understand the key figures behind many of the indie films of the 1990s. Yet, in a variety of ways, his book falls short. Though Biskind constructs Down and Dirty Pictures as an exposé of the shady goings-on in the indie film world, he frequently reinforces a number of unproductive misperceptions about the companies and their films. For example, he provides a highly selective approach to Miramax’s releases and activities. In supporting his position that Miramax helped drain art house– oriented American independent film of substance as it evolved under Disney’s control, he overlooks the company’s long-standing investment in a diverse slate of niche films from around the world. Further, though Miramax did place a greater emphasis on emotionally charged films such as Sling Blade, Good Will Hunting, and The Cider House Rules (1999) as the 1990s wore on, the company had always invested heavily in such material. Just because these films did not realize the particular vision of quality cinema he preferred is no reason to reject them out of hand. Biskind’s value judgments—as well as his view of what independent film should have become—lead him to present an incomplete snapshot of the indie film business in the 1990s. As another example of the partial perspective provided, his nearly 550-page tome offers only about twenty substantive pages of discussion of Miramax’s genre division, Dimension. This limited coverage reflects his (un-interrogated) view that this division’s films were disposable cultural products and had little to do with the broader indie film business beyond generating revenue. While he may not be fond of the Scream, Spy Kids, and Scary Movie franchises, their economic and cultural impact should not be dismissed. Meanwhile, Biskind is so busy identifying the indie film movement of the 1990s as a distinctly\n\nFinding a Niche in the 1990s 11\n\nperren pages.indd 11\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nAmerican phenomenon that he fails to explore those films that do not fit within this narrative. Even as the culturally hybrid nature of films such as The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love is dismissed, the ties of films such as The Crying Game to the UK and The Piano (1993) to Australia– New Zealand are scarcely remarked on. Biskind downplays such connections in the interest of constructing a tale of the co-optation of authentically independent American cinema by the evil brute Miramax. This one company—along with the lone festival, Sundance—is presented in near isolation throughout the book. There is little sense of a larger industrial or cultural context, either at the independent or conglomerate level. He mentions Disney on only a handful of pages; the prominent 1990s-era indie competitors Gramercy and Sony Pictures Classics are brought up even less often. By failing to discuss such major films and companies at any length, Down and Dirty Pictures provides a distorted depiction of this defining moment for low-budget film. While Biskind should be praised for providing the first (and thus far only) book-length exploration of Miramax’s practices during the 1990s,37 his approach needs to be expanded and modified in significant ways. Indie, Inc. provides a corrective to many of the misleading assumptions and arguments that Biskind makes about both Miramax and indie film during the 1990s. Through case studies of key releases such as sex, lies, and videotape, The Crying Game, The Piano, Pulp Fiction, Kids, Scream, The English Patient, Life is Beautiful, and Shakespeare in Love, I reconsider many of the ideas that have come to be taken for granted by Biskind as well as many others writing about the Hollywood-independent relationship. Cumulatively, my book challenges the notion forwarded by Biskind that Miramax’s greatest accomplishment came from helping to make American independent film mainstream. Instead, we need to see Miramax as part of a much larger process: the restructuring of global Hollywood.38 Rather than focusing predominantly on those so-called quality films that appealed to a particular white, male, upper-middle-class demographic and were most extensively celebrated by the press and critics, this study surveys a much broader range of English-language product, genre films, mid-range transnational prestige pictures, and foreign-language imports released by Miramax. In addition, it explores how, on a smaller scale, Miramax exploited Disney’s resources to transform a diverse set of films into multimedia franchises. To undertake this analysis, I turn to a wide range of documents, including feature articles and reviews in trade publications, newspapers, and magazines; marketing materials such as press releases, press kits, print advertisements, and trailers; and a broad sample of Miramax feature films. These sources are used to construct a 12\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 12\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nrevisionist history of the rise and fall of Miramax that integrates a discussion of shifts in the film industry, in discourses about independence, and in film aesthetics. The 1990s as the “Age of Miramax”\n\nEnough time has now passed since the ascendance—and complete collapse— of Miramax that the company’s story can be told as a history. Previous analyses of Miramax and indie film, including Biskind’s, were written while the company remained a vibrant part of the larger film industry. This is no longer the case. Many of the indie film companies in operation during the 1990s and 2000s—Miramax included—have been closed or substantially downsized. Media analysts do not agree exactly when the decline began, but most point to the Weinsteins’ departure from Miramax in 2005 and the closure of the indie distributors Picturehouse, Warner Independent, and Paramount Vantage in 2008 as key turning points. The only scholar to have written extensively about indie film in the 2000s thus far is Geoff King in Indiewood, USA. In this book, King identifies Indiewood as a hybrid form that synthesizes Hollywood and independent film aesthetics. Most of the films he analyzes are pricey mid-range releases that appealed primarily to those with greater cultural capital. According to King, though specialty divisions have distributed Indiewood-style films (e.g., Traffic, 2000; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, 2004), the majors have traded in them as well (e.g., Three Kings, 1999; Being John Malkovich, 1999). Though he does note this in his book in passing, it is worth underscoring that all the films for which he offers detailed case studies were released within a rather narrow time frame: December 1998—April 2004. Rather than historically situating Indiewood within a particular industrial moment, King is mainly interested in exploring the distinct textual strategies and taste cultures connected to a particular set of films. Had he contextualized these films industrially, he might have seen the extent to which Indiewood can be viewed as marking the end of the indie film phenomenon.39 As I discuss in the conclusion, his use of the label Indiewood to describe both the films released by the majors’ distribution arms and those released by indie specialty divisions works counter to most contemporary usages. Interestingly, the earliest film for which King offers a case study is Shakespeare in Love (1998). In contrast, I use this film as my final case study; with it, I argue, Miramax and the indie film business entered into their “mature” phase. By identifying the 1989–1999 period as the focus of my book, I am countering the ways that many others—including producer’s represen-\n\nFinding a Niche in the 1990s 13\n\nperren pages.indd 13\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\ntative John Pierson (1984–1994), as well as King (1998–2004) and Biskind (1989–2002)40 —have structured their respective studies of commercially oriented low-budget cinema. Pierson’s autobiographical book, Spike, Mike, Slackers, and Dykes, chronicles the ten-year period before the explosion of indie film. At that time, it was easier for many first-time filmmakers—including Spike Lee (She’s Gotta Have It, 1986), Michael Moore (Roger & Me, 1989), Richard Linklater (Slacker, 1991), and Rose Troche (Go Fish, 1994)—to produce ultra-low-budget films, generate attention on the festival circuit, receive critical acclaim, and attain modest box office successes (i.e., in the $1 million to $10 million range). Pierson’s emphasis is almost exclusively on a particular strand of critically acclaimed, art house— oriented American independent films. Though focusing on a different time span, he expresses attitudes toward independent film strikingly similar to those on display in Biskind’s book. Significantly, the moment for these types of films was passing at precisely the time that Pierson published his book, something he acknowledges with some melancholy in the second edition, Spike Mike Reloaded.41 Meanwhile, as noted above, King homes in on the tail end of the indie moment, when independent and studio aesthetics fused within a relatively small subset of films. Both of these writers, along with Biskind, have authored books about independent film in which Miramax figures prominently. And Miramax, as we shall see below, did affect the independent film world in substantive and dramatic ways. But this book is not about the rise and fall of independent film. Rather, it is about the rise and fall of Miramax. The stories are not the same, though I illustrate how they intersected at times. One of the most common mistakes made by those writing about independent film is to equate the two. In doing so, Miramax has been made into something other than what it was. Miramax was not the preeminent independent distributor throughout the 1980s and 1990s; rather, it occupied this position only briefly, in tandem with New Line, from 1989 through early 1993. As chapter 2 demonstrates, many other companies figured far more prominently in the independent landscape prior to 1989. Further, following Miramax’s purchase by Disney in 1993—the same year Turner acquired New Line—the Weinstein-led company began to transform into something altogether different. Most notably, Miramax emerged as the most high-profile and well-respected brand name for a wide range of niche films. In addition, throughout the 1990s, it had the most substantive and consistent impact on the indie film business of any company. It is for these reasons that the 1990s was the decade of Miramax. Beginning with My Left Foot, Cinema Paradiso, and, sex, lies, and videotape in 1989–1990, Miramax demonstrated the 14\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 14\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\neconomic and creative possibilities for a diverse set of low-budget films. It continued to earn a larger market share and higher profile for such films for the next several years. Only when it deviated from its original business of releasing low-cost, high-quality films—which it began to do during the late 1990s— did its demise ensue. But this demise occurred not only because Miramax busted its business model, but also because it tarnished its reputation and adversely affected its relationships with talent and executives both at Disney and throughout the industry. Unfortunately, when Miramax went down, it brought much of the broader indie film business down along with it. In charting the rise and fall of Miramax, Indie, Inc. focuses on the process by which a three-tier structure of independents, indie divisions, and big-budget studio distribution arms developed and then subsequently declined. Significantly, this book is not about individual personalities à la Biskind, nor is it a behind-the-scenes story of on-set dramas and boardroom battles. Rather, what is offered here is a historical analysis of shifting industrial practices and cultural discourses about independence, indie, Indiewood, and Hollywood during the 1990s. As discussed in chapter 8, by the time Miramax released Shakespeare in Love, the seeds of its destruction—and, in turn, the destruction of the conglomerates’ specialty divisions—had been sown. This is not to suggest that the collapse of the “Miramax model” was inevitable. Indeed, as the following pages detail, the path taken by Miramax and its competitors in production, acquisitions, distribution, and marketing was a consequence of particular business and creative decisions made by individuals within a specific set of industrial, technological, and cultural circumstances that began to crystallize in 1989.\n\nFinding a Niche in the 1990s 15\n\nperren pages.indd 15\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nc h a p t e r\n\nt w o\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster (1979–Fall 1992)\n\nThe film that put the capper on one decade and jump-started the next one, Steven Soderbergh’s sex, lies, and videotape [1989]. John Pierson, Spike, Mike, Slackers, and Dykes, 1997\n\nT\n\nhe release of sex, lies, and videotape marked a turning point for both Miramax and the independent scene. This film wielded an impact that resonated throughout the coming decade as Miramax released such later “indie blockbusters”1 as The Crying Game (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), The English Patient (1996), and Good Will Hunting (1997). Indeed, with sex, lies, and videotape, Miramax carved out its early brand identity, helped establish the aesthetic parameters for low-budget independent films, and began to define the contours of the niche-oriented landscape of the 1990s. By “indie blockbuster,” I mean a film that, on a smaller scale, replicates the marketing and box office performance of the major studio event pictures. The box office performance of sex, lies, and videotape was certainly stunning for the time: with a budget of only about $1.2 million, the film generated more than $24 million at the North American box office.2 Such figures suggest how this one film set the initial standard for specialty film distribution in the 1990s. In fact, sex, lies, and videotape helped lay the groundwork for a larger transformation within the entertainment industry during the decade. This industrial environment was one in which the studios focused predominantly on the distribution of big-budget event spectacles, while studio-based subsidiaries (which, as discussed in the next chapter, Miramax became upon its purchase by Disney) focused mainly on low-budget, niche-targeted films.\n\nperren pages.indd 16\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nWith the screening of Steven Soderbergh’s film at Sundance in January 1989, festivals became increasingly important as industry gathering spots and marketing sites. In addition, sex, lies, and videotape reinforced the potential for “quality” films to cross over to a broader audience. Quality, as employed below, is seen as an ideological term deployed by marketers to suggest sophisticated material geared toward a more educated and discriminating audience.3 Even as sex, lies, and videotape hinted at the beginning of a quality American indie aesthetic, it represented an altered means of marketing for low-budget features. What’s more, in Miramax’s hands, the film contributed to the redefinition of the label of independence by the press and entertainment industry. During the next several years, a number of films would replicate the financial success and media attention garnered by sex, lies, and videotape; the vast majority of these (e.g., Clerks [1994], Pulp Fiction, Sling Blade [1996], Good Will Hunting) would be theatrically distributed in the United States by Miramax. Given the crucial role that sex, lies, and videotape played in the development of Miramax and the evolution of the low-budget film scene, it is necessary to trace the film’s aesthetics, theatrical distribution, and critical reception. But before doing so, it is important to outline the turbulent industrial environment from which Miramax emerged. Rather than immediately becoming a major player in the independent film business, Miramax was in fact a marginal operation throughout the 1980s. As chronicled below, the industrial environment of the 1980s favored a different type of independent distributor—those such as Cinecom, Island, and Vestron, which depended heavily on the nascent video business for their financial success. As we shall see, Miramax did not begin its ascent until the late 1980s, when most other major independent distributors went into decline due to a range of factors, including overproduction, mismanagement, and broader industry consolidation. A number of scholars and journalists have traced the beginnings of the “age of Miramax” to the “independent shakedown” of 1989 in general and the release of sex, lies, and videotape in particular.4 But despite the frequent observations about the influence of sex, lies, and videotape on low-budget filmmaking and aesthetics in the 1990s, there has not yet been a methodical exploration of the ways that this film’s distribution, marketing, and critical reception affected the landscape of contemporary Hollywood. Similarly, there has been little in-depth analysis of the means by which sex, lies, and videotape started to pave the way for the studiosubsidiary environment of the 1990s—an environment in which nearly every studio purchased or created one or more quality, specialty, or classics film divisions. This chapter examines all these matters, as well as\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster 17\n\nperren pages.indd 17\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nthe symbiotic relationship that developed between sex, lies, and videotape and Miramax in shaping the discourse of independence, affecting the marketing of low-budget films, and defining the stylistic and thematic concerns of niche films in the 1990s. What follows is a survey of the pre-Disney years of Miramax, beginning with the company’s slow start in the late 1970s and concluding with an account of its vicissitudes following the success of sex, lies, and videotape. During this fourteen-year period, the roots of an independent film business and culture were established—roots that Miramax would later variably exploit and modify. Miramax, Independents, and Hollywood in the 1980s\n\nWe’re David . . . and they’re Goliath. So I’m bringing my slingshot. Harvey Weinstein, 1988\n\nWhen the Weinsteins created Miramax in 1979, the Hollywood majors were in the process of refining their marketing and production practices in favor of high-concept films. By this time, American New Wave filmmakers had either shifted toward the mainstream (George Lucas) or become increasingly marginalized (Robert Altman).5 Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), and Superman (1978) dominated the box office charts and multiplex screens. The status of low-budget independents at this point remained much more uncertain. Though genre films such as The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977) and Halloween (1978) became surprising box office successes, more art house– oriented films such as Northern Lights (1978) and Gal Young ’Un (1979) struggled to find an audience. Independent operations faced several challenges in the mid-to-late 1970s, including the lack of a clear market and the absence of a cohesive community for support. A large-scale infrastructure did not yet exist for those interested in producing and distributing low-budget films. Though downtown art houses remained key sites for viewing independently released films, they struggled as many urban areas continued to go into decline, as new suburban multiplexes emerged, and as home video’s popularity increased. In addition, with the exception of more genre-based material, the majors began to lose interest in lower-budget projects; high-concept event films attracted more of the majors’ attention and resources. Meanwhile, festivals remained relatively small in number and in attendance. Outside the trade publications, the press offered minimal coverage of festivals. Though there were a handful of high-profile 18\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 18\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nEuropean film festivals (i.e., Venice, Cannes), until the Toronto and Seattle Film Festivals launched in 1975, the main North American festivals were only those in San Francisco and New York. Despite these difficulties, by the late 1970s there were several promising signs for independent producers and distributors. First, existing sources of funding, such as the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, were complemented by new foundations. The Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers, the Independent Feature Project, and the Sundance Institute were among the organizations founded in the late 1970s and early 1980s to encourage both narrative and documentary filmmakers hoping to develop their projects outside the Hollywood system. Second, a number of developing technologies such as video and cable promised alternate means of gaining financing and distribution.6 Further, recently founded mom-and-pop video stores seemed more open to offering independent projects than the local theaters. Third, as ancillary markets continued to develop, it became increasingly common and accepted for low-budget filmmakers to presell distribution rights to their films in order to finance production. Often cable, video, domestic theatrical, and television distribution as well as select foreign distribution rights would be sold off as needed to help fund a project.7 Preselling served as a means of protecting initial investors’ interests.8 Fourth, baby boomers offered the possibility of a market for films targeted to different, older constituencies than were currently being favored by the Hollywood studios and their predominantly youthoriented films. Into this complicated climate emerged a number of distribution companies, formed in myriad ways and with varying amounts of capital. Some of the companies began their operations independently of the studios; others marked the earliest formulations of studio-based “classics” divisions. These included the Samuel Goldwyn Company (1978), United Artists Classics (1980), Universal Classics (1980), Cinecom (1980), 20th Century-Fox International Classics (1980), Triumph (1980), and Orion Classics (1982). Cumulatively, these low-budget-oriented distributors tended to focus on a combination of documentaries, foreign-language imports (which still were considered to have a dedicated, albeit dwindling, audience), and narratively and stylistically experimental character studies. These new companies released many films from beginning filmmakers—for the most part, a new generation of directors who were distinct from the American New Wave by virtue of their particular regional-, class-, race-, and gender-based concerns. Among the directors getting\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster 19\n\nperren pages.indd 19\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\ntheir start at this time were John Sayles (Return of the Secaucus 7, 1980), Susan Seidelman (Smithereens, 1982), Jim Jarmusch (Permanent Vacation, 1982), and Joel and Ethan Coen (Blood Simple, 1984). The budgets of these films tended to range from $2 million to at most $5 million—as compared with the budgets of studio films, which were heading upward of $17 million by the mid-1980s.9 The majority of these independent distributors acquired all or some of the rights once the film was finished or close to completion (labeled a “negative pickup”). This helped to limit the financial risk of young companies, which often lacked sufficient capital. For the typical independent release, the marketing approach usually consisted of pushing the film’s specific content (story line, style, etc.) and then relying on word of mouth and solid critical response to help it take off. These films usually were released on an extremely limited number of screens, often located in only the largest urban centers (e.g., Chicago, Los Angeles, New York).10 It was in this environment that Miramax developed. Looking at its evolution during the 1980s helps demonstrate the range of options available to independent distributors at the time, just as it provides a context for understanding the genesis of this specific company. Discussing Miramax’s prehistory and early years proves challenging, as there is limited press coverage about the company available and the Weinsteins have labored to build an elaborate narrative—some might say mythology— about their early years. Nonetheless, certain details can be gleaned. Notably, Harvey Weinstein had ventured into the entertainment business in a variety of ways before cofounding Miramax in 1979. The story goes that Harvey Weinstein’s first entertainment-related negotiation took place while he was at the University of Buffalo, when he was trying to book a Stephen Stills concert for the campus. When “school funding suddenly came up short,” he joined with Bob to borrow a friend’s wedding gift of $2,500 and some money from a local pizza restaurant. The brothers proceeded to produce the concert on their own.11 Over the course of the next few years, Harvey dabbled in music booking and concert promotion as the cofounder of the Harvey and Corky Corporation (with Corky Burger).12 By the late 1970s, this venture was a multimillion-dollar operation, employing more than fifty people (including Harvey’s younger brother, Bob) and producing and promoting approximately 125 concerts a year. The Harvey and Corky Corporation ran the fifty-year-old, 2,600-seat Century Theater in Buffalo until it became too costly to maintain. They restored the theater and began booking national tours with artists such as Genesis, Billy Joel, and the Grateful Dead. In spite of these big names, 20\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 20\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nthe Weinsteins struggled to stay in business. According to Bob Weinstein, “To pay for the heating bills, we needed another source of income. . . . I went downstairs and found some broken-down, unused film projectors. We refurbished the projectors and started to run film festivals on Friday and Saturday nights. Two thousand kids would show up and live at the theater on weekends.”13 Along with exhibiting films, the Weinsteins soon began making movies themselves. In 1977, Harvey Weinstein earned his first producer credit with White Rock (1977), a documentary covering the Innsbruck Winter Olympics that prominently featured music composed and performed by the Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman. Two years later, amid their successes running weekend screenings and booking bands, the Weinsteins made their first major foray into distribution under the name of Miramax. They began the operation on an ad hoc basis, booking cityto-city campaigns for concert movies. Among their earliest ventures were Rockshow (1980) with Paul McCartney, The Genesis Concert Movie (1977), and The Concert for Kampuchea (1980).14 It was not long before they made their first “official” attempts at distributing feature films. In the summer of 1980, Miramax moved out of concert films with its release on five screens in the Buffalo area of Goodbye Emmanuelle (1977), the third in the Emmanuelle series of erotic films.15 Goodbye Emmanuelle earned an R rating, which permitted those under seventeen years of age to view a film in theaters if accompanied by an adult. The previous two Emmanuelle films (which Miramax did not distribute) had received X ratings, thereby limiting the potential audience only to those over age seventeen. The days when an X rating promised greater box office returns were long gone. Certainly an X had served as an effective means of attracting “adult” audiences with more explicit sexual situations in the late 1960s and early 1970s (e.g., Midnight Cowboy, 1969; Last Tango in Paris, 1973). By the early 1980s, however, an R proved likelier to generate larger returns than an X because the former rating enabled the film to be advertised in more newspapers and screened at more theaters. In the ensuing years, the Weinsteins would make a habit of testing the limits of the R rating and call attention to the “borderline X” status of films in their marketing materials. With the company’s expansion beyond exhibition and concert film distribution, the Weinsteins set up their first “office” in a one-bedroom apartment on 57th Street in New York City, which doubled as Harvey’s living quarters.16 Throughout the early and mid-1980s, Miramax focused on releasing films for home video, television, and theatrical markets that “target[ed] three audiences: rock music fans, children, and mainstream.”17\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster 21\n\nperren pages.indd 21\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nThe typical Miramax film of this time was a negative pickup, acquired at as low a cost as possible, with the company usually holding North American theatrical rights. Miramax would then operate through a network of twenty to thirty sub-distributors.18 The company generated additional revenue by acting as an overseas sales representative for a number of movies. The Paul McCartney-produced The Real Buddy Holly Story (1985), distributed domestically via HBO, was just one of the films for which Miramax negotiated foreign distribution. Throughout the early and mid-1980s, the company kept overhead at a minimum, employing about a dozen people who focused on distributing up to five or six films a year.19 Miramax developed more slowly than many of its independent and classics counterparts, such as Circle, Island, and Cinecom.20 The types of films it focused on releasing differed as well. Early watersheds in the company’s history included the releases of The Secret Policeman’s Other Ball (1982) and Eréndira (1983). In the case of the former film, the brothers purchased a recording of a live benefit concert for Amnesty International that featured Monty Python comedy sketches and performances by musicians such as Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, and Sting.21 They subsequently bought a second film of the concert tour and edited the two together for release as The Secret Policeman’s Other Ball. They put together a television trailer for the film that featured the Monty Python comedian Graham Chapman satirizing the Moral Majority. As would often be the case in the future, controversy ensued, with NBC refusing to run the commercial. This no doubt fueled the film’s box office of more than $6 million, realized on an investment of only $180,000.22 With the release of Eréndira, the Weinsteins again used the low-cost method of nurturing a film’s more controversial elements. Once more, this tactic garnered them high returns at the domestic box office—nearly $3 million.23 While the film’s story line focused on the fifty-something star Irene Papas, the baby boomer Weinsteins saw her as appealing to a less lucrative “older audience.”24 Thus they chose to focus the marketing campaign around the young Brazilian supporting actress Claudia Ohana. They convinced Ohana to do a publicity tour in the United States and to pose for a Playboy layout. The promotional tactics employed with Eréndira point to a major factor in Miramax’s rise in the independent distribution world: the Weinsteins’ use of “exploitation” marketing tactics to make art house– oriented foreign-language and American independent films more appealing to a wide range of demographic groups. At this point, they began a dual strategy of selling films as “quality” products beloved by 22\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 22\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\ncritics at the same time that they called attention to the films’ more “lowculture” elements. In essence, the Weinsteins took the marketing strategies developed by pioneering 1950s- and 1960s-era independents such as American International Pictures and New World Pictures in promoting sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll films, and pushed them to their limits with Miramax—promoting the sexiest elements of high-culture products. These tactics played a major role in expanding the appeal of many Miramax films from the mid-1980s onward, enabling them to begin to move beyond the narrow art house audience. During this time, the Weinsteins and their small staff continued to refine the marketing tactics that would become the company’s trademark in the next decade. By 1986, Miramax executives had developed a number of sales philosophies, as indicated by Bob Weinstein’s comments in relation to the Lizzie Borden–directed drama Working Girls. Declaring that “our strength is marketing,” the younger Weinstein continued, “We feel [marketing] is an essential ingredient of all our pictures—you can’t just put them out. With Working Girls, we were able to change its documentary taint by bringing it uptown, giving the ads a classy look, and saying this is something that can crossover and make an issue out of middle-class prostitution. The package changed. It became accessible to everyone, and with the great marketing came great reviews.”25 Such a perspective set Miramax apart both at this time and in the years that followed. Yet while this emphasis on marketing in shaping the perception of and response toward niche films was distinctive in the mid-1980s, it would become a crucial aspect in helping such films carve out a larger place in the market during the 1990s. What the Weinsteins recognized before most other independent distributors was the value of selling lowbudget films via a combination of exploitation marketing tactics and an emphasis on quality and difference. Among Miramax’s most popular and critically acclaimed titles during the mid-1980s were Edith and Marcel (1984), Twist and Shout (1986), Crossover Dreams (1985), The Dog Who Stopped the War (1985), The Quest (1986), I’ve Heard the Mermaids Singing (1987), Pelle the Conqueror (1987), and The Thin Blue Line (1988). Pelle the Conqueror earned Miramax its first Oscar, for Best Foreign Film. In addition to these Miramax-released negative pickups, the Weinsteins also branched out during the 1980s by experimenting with writing, directing, and producing projects for other companies. These forays into the production process were made with genre fare of the type that would become standard for the company’s Dimension division in the 1990s. In most cases, these 1980s genre films met with lukewarm critical and box office responses. One of the\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster 23\n\nperren pages.indd 23\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nearliest efforts came in 1981, when Bob took a stab at the horror genre in cowriting The Burning (Harvey took a coproducer credit). This $1.5 million imitation of Friday the 13th (1980), which featured a camp custodian seeking revenge, was distributed domestically by Filmways and Orion. Although the film met with only modest success in the United States, it was a hit abroad, especially in Japan.26 Another project (notable mainly for its box office failure) was Playing for Keeps (1986), a teen rock-and-roll movie. This $2.6 million production was cowritten and codirected by the brothers and distributed by Universal. While neither film ended up establishing the Weinsteins as bankable filmmakers or expert storytellers, the brothers nonetheless learned an important lesson from these ventures: they should focus their energies on the intricacies of acquiring, marketing, and placing films in theaters.27 Neither Weinstein would venture into directing or writing again after 1987 (when Harvey made one last directorial attempt with the animated children’s film The Gnomes’ Great Adventure). Although the Weinsteins may have lacked the golden touch with films they made themselves, they had several hits with their acquisitions. Moreover, during most of the 1980s they steered clear of the in-house production bug that afflicted so many of the independents. Instead of expanding into production themselves, they branched out in other ways, which dramatically improved their economic position relative to their competitors. The Weinsteins took a cue from the majors early on by pushing to retain merchandising, publishing, and music rights for their films.28 In addition, the company sought to increase its bank account by pursuing additional investors and financing partners whenever possible. For example, in 1987, the Weinsteins struck a twelve-picture, multimillion-dollar deal with Embassy Home Entertainment.29 By providing a two-year license of home video rights to Embassy, Miramax was able to pursue more actively acquisitions and coproduction deals. As Miramax engaed in a slow-growth strategy throughout the mid1980s, a number of other independents and classics divisions expanded far more rapidly. In fact, most 1980s-era independent distributors peaked between 1984 and 1987. Among the domestic box office success stories were Island Alive’s El Norte (1983, $5.5 million domestic gross), the Samuel Goldwyn Company’s Stranger Than Paradise (1984, $2.4 million), Island Alive’s Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985, $6.3 million), Island’s The Trip to Bountiful (1985, $7.2 million), Island’s She’s Gotta Have It (1986, $7.1 million), and Cinecom’s A Room with a View (1986, $12 million).30 Grosses of $2 million to $12 million were remarkable for independently distributed, art house– oriented films. Many industry observers were 24\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 24\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nCopyright © 1986 Universal City Studios. Though skillful executives, the Weinsteins proved less talented as screenwriters and directors. The teen musical-comedy Playing for Keeps (1986), released by Universal, was a box office disappointment.\n\nperren pages.indd 25\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nsurprised to see these releases find a place in the market against such high-concept offerings as Back to the Future (1985), Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), and Aliens (1986). Although companies such as Island Alive, Cinecom, MCEG, Circle, and Vestron had a run of good luck for a couple of years, they made a number of missteps that, combined with a changing industrial climate, proved fatal to their future development. Most significantly, while these distributors had achieved most of their box office successes from negative pickups, they began to shift away from acquisitions and transitioned to in-house productions. In one respect, this shift seemed a logical and wise business decision: while acquisitions were safer in spreading risk and lessening a distributor’s investment, they also diminished the amount that could be taken in by any one company. This was due to the increasingly common practice of preselling rights. The splitting of rights became particularly troubling for the distributors who had the domestic theatrical rights but nothing else; these companies would expend most of the effort in marketing the films but then receive none of the benefits from ancillary markets. Despite their drawbacks, negative pickups were much safer than inhouse productions—a fact that became clear to many distributors in the mid-to-late 1980s. Whereas companies relying on a negative pickup strategy made their distribution decisions based on nearly finished or finished films, relying on in-house productions meant that companies had to decide on the potential of a project based solely on the quality of the script and the talent attached. In other words, producing in-house was clearly a much less reliable method. It was also, for the most part, a much more expensive strategy. Whereas costs were capped with acquisitions, in-house production budgets could rapidly spiral out of control. This was a dangerous truism since returns for independents tended to be relatively small to begin with: $5 million was the largest sum that most independents brought in at the North American box office during this period.31 In fact, most of the independent distributors who chose to shift to in-house productions met with disaster. As just one example, Vestron followed the unexpected box office hit Dirty Dancing (1987) with several in-house productions, including Parents (1989), Dream a Little Dream (1989), and Earth Girls Are Easy (1989). Each film failed at the box office, leaving Vestron’s distribution schedule “in limbo” by September 1989.32 Such was the case for dozens of companies that blossomed during the 1980s, including Island, Cinecom, and MCEG. Just a few of the independent films to bomb at the box office in 1988 were Patty Hearst (Atlan26\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 26\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\ntic), Pascali’s Island (Avenue), The Lighthorsemen (Cinecom), Miles from Home (Cinecom), The Wizard of Loneliness (Skouras), Far North (Alive), and Tokyo Pop (Spectrafilm). Not only were many of these companies brought down by overextending themselves with in-house productions, many were also mismanaged or undercapitalized. Cumulatively, several of the same independent distributors that had predicted a new and glorious chapter in independent production and distribution during the early 1980s were declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy by 1989. Meanwhile, the classics divisions had their own problems, due in part to the aforementioned factors, but also due to their place within their larger parent companies. Classics divisions of the 1980s tended to be closely affiliated with their parents, meaning that the studios regularly tinkered with the divisions rather than allowing them to operate as relatively autonomous entities. The interference of too many executives from too many levels of the studio hierarchy blurred the distinctions between independent and mainstream content. In addition, the ambitions of the 1980s-era classics divisions were much more modest, in both the kinds of films chosen and the ways they were distributed and marketed. This limited the box office potential for these films from the outset. Thus, by the late 1980s, both independent distributors and classics divisions were quickly disappearing from the industry landscape. Their rapid demise—after an equally rapid rise—was due to external industrial factors as much as it was due to such internal problems as overextension, over-production and over-expenditure. Among the broader challenges these companies faced in the late 1980s were the following: a Wall Street crash in late 1987, which led to greater financial conservatism on the part of many investors; changing tax laws that reduced much of the private financing that had fueled independent production; and the consolidation of the video market.33 The changing shape of the video market proved the most detrimental factor. While a select number of 1980s independents released specialty films targeted to the traditional art house market, the vast majority focused on producing low-grade “B” fare—inexpensive action, science fiction, and horror films that featured lesser talent.34 A large number of these films were knockoffs of such slasher films as Halloween and Friday the 13th.35 Most of these movies were made quickly and cheaply, and were intended to serve as filler on video store shelves (e.g., The Toxic Avenger Part III, 1989; Prom Night III, 1990). It is worth underscoring that the bulk of the 1980s B product was standard genre fare with poor production values—in other words, it had little in common with the indies that would become the focal point of specialty operations of the 1990s.\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster 27\n\nperren pages.indd 27\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nOne genre-oriented company that stayed vibrant amid the transformation of the marketplace throughout the 1980s was New Line. Even as many of its competitors faded from the scene, New Line continued to prosper. The company remained among the most prominent independent distributors primarily due to its success with a handful of genre franchises, including A Nightmare on Elm Street (seven films from 1984 to 1994), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (three films from 1990 to 1993), and House Party (three films from 1990 to 1994).36 Because the company played such a crucial role in defining the contours of the genre business of the 1980s and 1990s, it is worth outlining New Line’s development. It is also important to survey the company’s development because it influenced the strategies Miramax employed as it, too, entered the genre business. By the early 1990s, New Line was one of the oldest independent distributors still in operation. Started by Robert Shaye in 1967, New Line began by catering to college campuses through a combination of film screenings and lecture presentations.37 The company met with early success by releasing such films as a restored version of the 1930s exploitation film Reefer Madness and the Jean-Luc Godard Rolling Stones documentary Sympathy for the Devil (1970). Relatively early on, Shaye cultivated a relationship with the director John Waters and over the years released the lion’s share of his films, including Multiple Maniacs (1970), Pink Flamingos (1972), and Female Trouble (1974). As Waters became more mainstream in both style and content, so did New Line. Hairspray (1988) was one of New Line’s (and Waters’s) biggest successes, earning in excess of $6 million at the box office. New Line traded on far more than just John Waters films during the 1970s and 1980s, however; as Justin Wyatt notes, the company’s “distribution slate mixed foreign, sexploitation, gay cinema, rock documentaries, and ‘midnight specials’ reserved exclusively for midnight exhibition.”38 As this list indicates, throughout its first two decades in business New Line focused on genres that appealed to relatively narrow niches. In general, it went where the major studios did not. During this time, the company predominantly focused on distribution, making only the occasional foray into production.39 The turning point for New Line came with its release of the $1.8 million A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984. By this time, the latest horror cycle was relatively far along—for example, the third Halloween (1982) and Friday the 13th (1982) films had completed their theatrical runs and fourth installments of both series were being developed. Nonetheless, Nightmare was a stunning success, earning more than $25 million in theaters and making Freddy Krueger an 28\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 28\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nicon. From then on, New Line would be seen as the company built by Freddy Krueger.40 The regular infusion of cash from the Nightmare films sustained New Line through the highs and (mainly) lows encountered by all independents when the video market consolidated. And consolidate it did: as Blockbuster franchises replaced mom-andpop video stores, studio hits were increasingly given priority in the chain stores’ inventories.41 In 1988 alone, video dealer purchases of B titles dropped 23 percent from the previous year, validating gloom-and-doom predictions by many industry analysts about the fate of independents.42 An additional problem that independent distributors faced was a growing dominance by the studios within the international marketplace. European theaters and television stations—which had earlier purchased independent projects to fill their continuous demand for product—began to become more selective, rejecting what became perceived as “inferior” product.43 Further, independents increasingly struggled to find screens in the North American market. As the studios refined their wide release strategies, they opened films on more and more screens, leaving less room for alternative fare. High-concept films dominated multiplexes, and urban art houses continued to disappear. By late 1989, it remained unclear to most observers whether independents were experiencing a cyclical “shakedown” or if big-budget event films would dominate conglomerate Hollywood, leaving fewer and fewer commercial opportunities for alternative viewpoints and styles. At the time, independent distributors and their low-budget films certainly seemed to be pushed ever farther to the margins of the industry. Yet, as would become more evident by early 1990, the market was just in the process of realigning. Executives were learning from the mistakes made in recent years. Soon new marketing strategies, and fresh voices, began to emerge once again. Many of these new strategies and voices would come from Miramax during the 1990s—although this certainly was not apparent even during the late 1980s. Miramax remained a marginal company until 1988. Only after many other independent operations began to struggle did the Weinsteins and their company come into their own. Through a series of low-cost deals, Miramax increased the number of films it released each year. To help increase their annual output to eight to ten films, Miramax contracted with the Canadian company S. C. Entertainment. By way of this arrangement, Miramax gained domestic distribution to seven features with an estimated total production cost of $20 million; S. C. Entertainment retained worldwide and Canadian rights.44 Among the films produced as part of the deal were the thrillers Eric (1988) and Blood\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster 29\n\nperren pages.indd 29\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nRelations (1989), the comedy Dixie Lanes (1988), and the drama Murder One (1988). Cumulatively, the films made under the S. C. Entertainment deal were representative of the B product churned out by the independents in the mid-to-late 1980s. On the heels of the S. C. Entertainment deal, Miramax agreed to represent Almi as the exclusive sales agent for its three hundred–plus films. Miramax announced its plans to incorporate the films into its library, ideally packaging them along with its own films for TV sales to network, syndication, and basic and pay cable users.45 These moves coincided with Miramax’s relocation to new offices on Madison Avenue and an increase in its staff size to twenty, which further indicated that the company wanted to be a much bigger player in the film business. Harvey Weinstein also began to publicly declare his interest in “watching for ‘original visions’ rather than ‘exploitation pics,’” acquiring films like Aria (1987, a compilation of short films directed by such prominent filmmakers as Robert Altman, Ken Russell, Jean-Luc Godard, and Nicolas Roeg), a Kiefer Sutherland coming-of-age film called Crazy Moon (1987), and a Dennis Hopper–Michael J. Pollard comedy called The American Way (1986).46 By 1988, the company had done well enough in the marketplace to pique the interest of the British bank Midland Montague, which became a partner in Miramax, investing $5 million and extending the company a $25 million line of credit.47 Though this level of money could not even cover the production costs of one Hollywood event film, it marked a crucial step in this small company’s development. With the financial backing of Montague, Miramax was able to further increase its staff size and its expenditures in acquisitions, expanding at a time when most independents were retrenching. With a $25 million debt/equity package, the brothers began to shift from acquiring and distributing films to also producing them through Miramax.48 Their first production through this arrangement, in cooperation with the British company Palace Pictures, was the aptly titled Scandal (1989), a film about the sexual affair between the British defense minister John Profumo (played by Ian McKellen) and Christine Keeler (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer). The controversy may have contributed to the fall of the Conservative government in 1963, but it helped Miramax produce a hit. Costing $7 million, the film grossed $30 million worldwide, in part due to a poster that featured a nude Joanne Whalley-Kilmer provocatively straddling a chair, and in part due to a promotional/talk-show tour by Keeler herself.49 With the Montague money and the success of Scandal, Miramax had the means to move beyond its standard range of products. In what 30\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 30\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nturned out to be a prescient comment regarding Miramax’s role in the future, Harvey in 1987 declared that the company would have a “new emphasis toward mainstream American pictures, and that includes the American independents.”50 Little did he know that the company would have more than just a “new emphasis.” Rather, Miramax would lead the way in redefining the financial, critical, and aesthetic value of nicheoriented films—and the meaning of independence—with its 1989 release of sex, lies, and videotape. The Beginning of the Boom\n\nIn exploring the history of sex, lies, and videotape, it is instructive to note that Miramax played no role in the initial development of the project. In fact, the company was not involved with the movie until after it premiered in January 1989 at the U.S. Film Festival (later renamed the Sundance Film Festival). The project was cofinanced by RCA/Columbia Home Video and Virgin; RCA/Columbia obtained domestic video rights while Virgin retained foreign video. The producers were free to seek a theatrical distributor if RCA/Columbia rejected it upon first look. This expectation of earning the investment back by video sales and rentals was a holdover from the early 1980s, before the consolidation of the video rental industry. Although the financiers expected to make back their money through VHS rentals, they were concerned about the word “videotape” in the film’s title. Even before viewing it, according to Soderbergh, the marketing people at RCA/Columbia asked for a change in the film’s name, believing that “the vendors would say that the buying public would think that the film was shot on videotape.”51 Such a statement implies a perception on the part of the film’s marketers— even before Miramax—that an independent movie carried connotations bearing specific “qualities.” These qualities may have included the more controversial (and hence saleable) elements of sex and lies, but did not include the suggested “low-quality” appearance of videotape. Ultimately, the very word “videotape” in the title was probably a boon. As John Pierson explains, the word resonated symbolically: “By using videotape both in the title . . . and in the film itself, Soderbergh almost literally ushered in the new era of the video-educated filmmaker.”52 Thus the stylistic nature of the film—in which a series of women confess their sexual histories and anxieties on videotape to help the protagonist satisfy himself sexually—marked it as both timely and distinct for technological as well as social reasons. The themes of impotence and sexual para-\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster 31\n\nperren pages.indd 31\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nnoia further rang true at a time when AIDS panics were headlining the news of the late 1980s. The film gained in popularity during the festival, which at this time sold approximately thirty thousand tickets and was a much more lowprofile event than in later years.53 By the end of the U.S. Film Festival, the film had received rave reviews from numerous critics and been screened in front of sold-out audiences. sex, lies, and videotape left the festival with the Dramatic Competition Audience Award and theatrical distribution offers from several independent distributors as well as one major studio.54 That the film was a phenomenon from its earliest screenings is apparent from comments made by a number of attendees at the festival. Then program director Tony Safford saw the film as an “unheralded” treat that was “fresh to the professional community as well to the filmgoers.”55 Soderbergh, however, simply noted that the praise was “getting out of hand.”56 Although the press lavished extensive acclaim on the film, North American theatrical rights for sex, lies, and videotape were not sold until a few weeks later, when Miramax purchased them at the American Film Market in Los Angeles. According to Soderbergh, Harvey Weinstein said that he would not go back to New York until he had the movie. By 1989, Miramax had already established a reputation for outbidding the other independent distributors. As crucial as the money they bid, however, was their distribution strategy; indeed, when later reflecting on how they “won” the rights to sex, lies, and videotape, “the Weinsteins maintain[ed] that their marketing plan was as crucial as their cash advance.”57 Despite the company’s minimal role in shaping the film’s actual development, Miramax was crucial in establishing sex, lies, and videotape’s box office success and its status as a quality independent blockbuster. The company’s marketing of the film was as significant as the content itself. Ultimately, the interest created in the film because of Miramax’s skillful distribution cannot be distinguished from the interest created by virtue of the film’s subject matter and story line. The company played up sex, lies, and videotape to the press in ways that helped the film move out of the “art-house ghetto.”58 By the late 1980s, art houses were disappearing rapidly. The name alone seemed guaranteed to keep many moviegoers away from theaters. In the process of marketing sex, lies, and videotape as a quality independent as opposed to an art house film, Miramax also played itself up to the press. The company’s marketers often constructed Miramax as the primary force in the film’s development and financial success. Miramax thus altered the independent landscape through its distribu32\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 32\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\ntion strategies and created the perception that it was altering this landscape. A study of Miramax’s release strategy provides a template for the techniques employed by almost any 1990s niche- or specialty-oriented distributor. It also shows why Miramax was the most prominent of these distributors during that decade. The marketing of sex, lies, and videotape began months before its August opening. According to Bob Weinstein, Miramax began to develop the prerelease buzz for the film at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1989.59 Initially the film was screened for the main competition but rejected and placed in the Director’s Fortnight, the venue for new films from up-and-coming directors. A last-minute cancellation from another American film, however, placed sex, lies, and videotape in the main competition. Soderbergh worried about the movie being lost in the shuffle, particularly as it was competing against Spike Lee’s high-profile Do the Right Thing (1989). Yet sex, lies, and videotape ended up playing to standing ovations and shutting out Lee’s film for awards. sex, lies, and videotape went on to win the prestigious Palme d’Or, provided Soderbergh and Miramax with much publicity, and added to the cachet of festivals as valuable sites for building word of mouth. Cannes marked just the beginning of the summer marketing blitz initiated by Miramax. The press kit for sex, lies, and videotape hints at the image of itself that the company tried to craft for the press and public: “The Weinstein brothers built their company with an aggressive marketing and distribution strategy, individually tailoring each film’s release to suit its particular strengths.”60 This implies that Miramax gave each film special care and designed its advertisements and trailers accordingly; indeed, the very notion of “tailoring” a film based on its strengths reveals the company’s focus on niche marketing. “Marketing is not a dirty word,” Harvey Weinstein told the Los Angeles Times in May 1989.61 In what may be seen as a shorthand manifesto for Miramax, and a more emphatic articulation of previous conceptions of quality independents, Weinstein explained, “Although we market artistic films, we don’t use the starving-artist mentality in our releases. Other distributors slap out a movie, put an ad in the newspaper—usually not a very good one—and hope that the audience will find it by miracle. And most often they don’t. It’s the distributor’s responsibility to find the audience.”62 For sex, lies, and videotape, this amounted to an attempt to give the film the specialized attention that Soderbergh wanted, packaged in a way that the major studios might do if they were distributing an event film. Just one of Miramax’s tactics was to tap into the most commercial elements—the “high-concept” components—in even the lowest budget\n\nThe Rise of Miramax and the Quality Indie Blockbuster 33\n\nperren pages.indd 33\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nfilm.63 Thus Miramax rejected Soderbergh’s own trailer for sex, lies, and videotape, telling him it was “art-house death.”64 Although Soderbergh saw his trailer as expressing “a mood perfectly emulat[ing] the mood of the film . . . [and] not like any other trailer [he’d] seen,” Miramax demurred.65 Soderbergh finally reached a compromise with Miramax, in which the company used its own trailer but also filled in some additional footage shot by Soderbergh as a transitional device.66 This example suggests that although Miramax may have sold each film on its merits, the company also had certain ideas about what worked in promoting niche films—and artsy trailers were not part of the company’s conception of good marketing. Indeed, by the late 1980s, any link to the art house was seen as limiting a film’s box office potential. An analysis of the print advertisement for sex, lies, and videotape shows several characteristics of Miramax marketing. As the one-sheet for the domestic theatrical distribution of the film suggests, Miramax tried to appeal to several distinct niches through one advertisement. First, by declaring the film’s status as a festival award winner, Miramax targeted the traditional art house audience, presumed to be familiar with these festivals for their role in highlighting the best of global cinema. Second, below the list of awards, Miramax took advantage of the positive press response. Quotations from critics representing major publications—the New York Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, and Time—gave the film additional credibility and created an appeal beyond the narrow festival route. Reviewers whom any filmgoer might trust explained why the movie was worth seeing. Yet even advertising the remarks from individual critics appealed to a particular, relatively limited constituency. So, third, the content of the quotations attempted to further broaden the appeal. The largest print in the ad, aside from the title, came from two critics’ statements: “One of the Best of 1989!” and “An Edgy, Intense Comedy.” These remarks showed two different visions of the film: The first associated the movie with the kinds of films that usually receive kudos, such as dramas, while the second suggested a lighter movie well suited for the August release date. Thus the movie was differentiated as being more serious than its August blockbuster counterparts, even as it was drawn closer to studio product by its associations with comedy. The images depicted in the advertisement, meanwhile, contributed to the “edgy” mystique of the film; the pictures of the main characters embracing and kissing—taken with the film’s title— conveyed raciness, excitement, something more adult. As one reporter observed of Miramax’s effective print ads, the company readily hinted at sexual themes and situations that were not necessarily apparent within the films themselves.67 More 34\n\nindie, inc.\n\nperren pages.indd 34\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nA Miramax Films Release © 1989.

Consistent with Miramax’s overall marketing strategy for the film, sexual attraction was foregrounded in the press photos of the cast of sex, lies, and videotape (1989).\n\nperren pages.indd 35\n\n2/24/12 10:32 AM\n\nthan depict the content of the movie, such ads constructed images of what the movie could be. Such constructions appealed to a variety of audience segments, including traditional art house crowds and Gen Xers. As a result, they facilitated a number of different readings of the film, depending on the viewer’s background and the particular aspects of the advertisements that caught his or her attention. Ultimately, the diverse niches targeted by Miramax were united by the film’s status as a quality independent—an identity that, in later years, would evolve into a subgenre of its own. The film’s generic connections to drama and comedy were refreshed with this newer identity. Miramax tried to make the movie whatever viewers wanted it to be—thus offering the chance for greater crossover appeal. Nonetheless, the company continued to maintain a specific-enough identity that the potential audience member would not be confused or disinterested. To many within the industry, Miramax’s attempts to find the most commercial elements in low-budget films, while still targeting specific niches in the market, was a welcome approach to a then struggling independent film scene. As one public relations executive stated, in a manner that summed up the sentiments of many, “the marketers of quality independent films really aren’t doing as effective a job as they might be doing.”68 Miramax certainly proved itself on this occasion, thereby differentiating both the company and its films. The company’s marketing tactics were so successful that exhibitors honored the Weinsteins as “independent distributors of the year” at their annual ShowEast conference in the fall of 1989. Although the Weinsteins may have penetrated multiplexes in 1989, they remained acutely aware of their position relative to the studios. Specifically, they recognized that their films had to complement, rather than compete with, the studios’ product. They had no illusions that they could match the studios in terms of either financial investment or marketing scale. Thus they relied heavily on free publicity, word of mouth, and counterprogramming strategies. While they eventually released sex, lies, and videotape on about 350 screens, they initially opened it only on a few. They expanded the film slowly, letting it build an audience based on positive reviews, responses, and awards. They scheduled a platform release, opening it in early August only in Los Angeles and New York, and then later moving it into nationwide release by the end of the "
