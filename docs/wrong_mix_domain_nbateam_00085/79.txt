Reports are showing that Steve Blake could be part of a three-team deal, but the Los Angeles Lakers would regret losing the veteran point guard.

In the deal, Blake would be traded to the Portland Trail Blazers. The Minnesota Timberwolves would receive Jamal Crawford and the Lakers would get Michael Beasley.

While Beasley has loads of athleticism and can provide a great scoring outburst at times, he is incredibly inconsistent and is not what Los Angeles needs to get to the next level.

The Lakers need to hold onto the front court that is currently assembled. That means do not trade Andrew Bynum and do not trade Pau Gasol. These men are part of the reason the team has been so successful over the past few years.

Instead, the team needs to solidify the point guard position. It is obvious that Derek Fisher is not the answer, but more minutes from Steve Blake could be.

Although the two are currently splitting time, Blake is a better shooter and facilitator with a better assist-to-turnover ratio.

Obviously the market for the 37-year-old Fisher is not great, but trading Blake does more harm than good.

There are a number of point guards on the market that the Lakers are considering, including Ramon Sessions and Raymond Felton, but it would most likely require giving up too much or would not be an upgrade.

The best-case scenario for the Lakers might be to forget about the trade deadline, stop panicking and go into the playoffs with the team they have.
