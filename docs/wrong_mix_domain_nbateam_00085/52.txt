The NBA trade rumors long mentioned Michael Beasley and the Minnesota Timberwolves, but the NBA's trade deadline hit at 2 p.m. on Thursday afternoon without any reports surfacing regarding a trade in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. It might not be a bad thing, either, considering the rumored deals the Wolves were involved got a bit worse on Thursday.

The most recent rumor that came out involved Beasley being shipped to the Los Angeles Lakers and Luke Ridnourgoing to the Portland Trail Blazers as part of a three-way deal that would have brought Jamal Crawford from the Portland Trail Blazers to the Wolves. The other moving parts were (reportedly) either Derek Fisher or Steve Blake, but Fisher was sent to the Houston Rockets instead.

Going without a trade likely won't bug head coach Rick Adelman, who said standing pat would help chemistry.

"These guys have built a base, and we've got to somehow find a way with these guys," Adelman said. "If somebody is added, then we have to look at that. That's why I'm not sure what will happen in this league. If teams make moves, you might bring in one guy who can slip in and help. But with only 27 games left and no practices, it's going to be hard to incorporate two, three guys in, like some of these teams are talking about if they make a big trade."
