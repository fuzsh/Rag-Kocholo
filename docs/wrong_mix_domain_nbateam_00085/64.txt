The Phoenix Suns have hired Brian Randle on their coaching staff as an assistant, the team announced Tuesday.

“My family and I are incredibly excited to join the Phoenix Suns,” said Randle in a team news release. “I couldn’t be more excited to work with and learn from Coach Monty Williams. The Suns have a strong young core with a great future ahead. I am grateful and humbled for this opportunity.”

Randle, 35, served as player development coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves this past 2019-20 season.

“We truly enjoyed our time in Minnesota and will always love our Timberwolves family,” Randle said in the release. “I think I have a unique perspective on basketball from my 10 years playing in Europe and my time under (Tom) Thibodeau and (Ryan) Saunders. I bring a strong defensive mindset which has been shaped over the years by coaches such as Bruce Weber, Tom Thibodeau and Guy Goodess.”

A former player at Illinois (2003-08), Randle initially joined the Timberwolves as an assistant video coordinator for the 2018-19 season after playing 10 seasons overseas.

“My basketball journey has been beyond what I could have imagined,” Randle added. “For this and everything, I give God all the glory.”

The Suns parted ways with two assistants, Larry Greer, and Steve Blake, earlier this summer after one season under Monty Williams in Phoenix.
