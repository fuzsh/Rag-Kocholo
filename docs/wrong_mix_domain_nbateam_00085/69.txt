MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES

The Minnesota Timberwolves debuted in 1989, bringing the NBA back to Minneapolis for the first time since 1960. That's when financial struggles forced the Minnesota Lakers to relocate to Los Angeles despite having won four of the NBA's first five championships.

The Timberwolves have had an impressive roster throughout the years, including Kevin Garnett, Stephon Marbury and Kevin Love. Current team members include Karl Anthony-Towns, Rudy Gobert, Jaden McDaniels, and what some commentators have declared the second coming of Michael Jordan (Anthony Edwards, a.k.a. ANT).

The Wolves have had nine playoff appearances and won the Midwest Division title in 2004. In 2024, the Minnesota Timberwolves advanced to the Western Conference finals, 20 years to the day of their last finals appearance. They ended up losing to the Dallas Mavericks in five games, but not before captivating the country with viral moments like Edwards' impromptu "bya!" call to NBA icon Charles Barkley.
