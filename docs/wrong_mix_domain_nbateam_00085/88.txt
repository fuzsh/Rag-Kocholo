Monty Williams credited Steve Blake and Larry Greer for helping the Phoenix Suns establish a culture in their first season under him.

"What they brought (to the team), especially the first 65 games and laying the foundation for our team and our program was invaluable," Williams said after Saturday's practice for the NBA restart at Walt Disney World Resort.

However, the Suns have moved forward without the two assistants.

"We're thankful for their contributions, (but) at the same time, everybody has to adapt in this league," Williams said.

Williams declined to explain why Blake and Greer are no longer on the staff.

"The details of it all, I don't want to get into," Williams said. "Organizations go through change and there are times where guys have to make decisions that are best for them and their families. It's a tough loss to not have those guys, but those decisions have to be made and as a leader, I have to respect what's best for the organization and what's best for the individuals."

Blake and Greer were in their first season on the Suns' staff under Williams.

"I miss those guys, but at the same time, I've been in this long enough to know that you have to adapt," Williams concluded.

Greer was an assistant at Arizona State from 2012-15 before working as an advance scout with the Oklahoma City Thunder (2015-17) and as advance scout (2017-18) and assistant (2018-19) for the Minnesota Timberwolves.

"Larry really organized our program behind the scenes," Williams said.

Blake, a 13-year NBA player, worked for Portland the previous two seasons before joining the Suns. A teammate of Suns General Manager James Jones in Portland in the 2007-08 season, Blake played for Williams, who was an assistant.

"I've known Stevie since he was, gosh, a really young player," Williams said. "Not quite a rookie, but I had him in Portland and I've watched him progress into a really good NBA player. Seen his family grow up and a lot of other boring stories that you don't want to hear."
