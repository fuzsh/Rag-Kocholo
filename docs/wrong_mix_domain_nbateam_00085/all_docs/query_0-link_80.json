        "text": "Will the real K-Mart please stand up?\n\nNew York's Kenyon Martin was nicknamed that long before a teammate started calling Timberwolves guard Kevin Martin the same years ago.\n\nApparently, the former No. 1 overall pick who's now just a mere shadow of himself isn't too fond of sharing.\n\nAfter last week's victory at Madison Square Garden, Wolves star Kevin Love said, \"Kenyon Martin was over there talking about the fake K-Mart. I said, 'Who?' He was 5-for-5 from three, had 30 points. Right now, that's the real K-Mart to me.\"\n\nSaid Kevin Martin himself: \"Last time one of my teammates called me that, the other K-Mart got kind of mad. I guess I'm not K-Mart until I get back to Minnesota or wherever we're going next.\"\n\nSuperman's Kryptonite\n\nHouston and the Los Angeles Lakers played Thursday night for the first time since star Dwight Howard left what became another nighttime serial in L.A. last year and signed as a free agent with the Rockets.\n\nAnd Howard and the Rockets lost at home to a Lakers team missing injured Kobe Bryant on Steve Blake's catch-and-shoot winner over Howard's outstretched arm with 1.3 seconds left.\n\n\"To be honest, when we came back into the locker room it wasn't a 'we beat Dwight' thing at all,\" Lakers guard Steve Nash told reporters afterward. \"We've got a bunch of guys who never played with Dwight. We're just happy we won a close game.\"\n\nHe said it\n\nTNT studio commentator Chuck Barkley to host Ernie Johnson regarding that last-second Lakers victory and the Rockets' game-ending defense Thursday: \"When you say dramatic, you mean stupid.\""
