        "text": "Commonly called the T-Wolves, the Timberwolves are a professional basketball team based in Minneapolis, Minn. They play in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nThe Timberwolves began play in 1989 as an expansion team. Like most new teams, they struggled in their early years in the league, winning no more than 29 games in any of their first seven seasons. In 1995 the Timberwolves’ vice president of basketball operations, former Boston Celtic star Kevin McHale, a Minnesota native, drafted teenage forward Kevin Garnett straight out of high school. Garnett soon led the team to the first play-off appearance (1996–97) and winning season (1997–98) in franchise history. While Garnett turned the team’s fortunes around, he was unable to lead it past the first round in any of Minnesota’s first seven play-off berths."
