        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS >> With their playoff fortunes nearly impossible and their injury list growing by the day, the Lakers’ trio of returning healthy point guards became the equivalent of musicians performing on the sinking Titanic.\n\nThey may have brought better offensive rhythm and added more depth to a depleting roster. But it doesn’t change the Lakers’ circumstances.\n\nTheir 109-99 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday at Target Center marked the Lakers’ seventh consecutive loss, their largest losing streak of the season. The Lakers (16-32) also suffered another rash of injuries in just one game.\n\nThe Lakers earlier learned Pau Gasol will stay sidelined for at least two weeks because of a strained right groin. Kobe Bryant and Xavier Henry won’t return from a fractured left knee and bruised right knee, respectively, for at least another two weeks. But Lakers lost more bodies in bizarre ways.\n\nGuard Jodie Meeks left nearly 90 seconds into the game because of a sprained right ankle and won’t play tonight in Cleveland or Friday in Philadelphia. After accidentally bumping heads with Lakers center Chris Kaman, forward Jordan Hill headed toward the locker room with a headache and cervical strain. He will see a doctor today to ensure he didn’t receive a concussion. Hill didn’t talk to reporters but walked around the locker room clearly frazzled.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Blake’s first game since nursing a hyperextended right elbow for two months featured plenty of feistiness and playmaking, including six assists. But he also ruptured his right eardrum after after colliding into Minnesota forward Dante Cunningham. Blake still will travel with the Lakers for today’s game in Cleveland and will see an ear, throat and nost specialist.\n\n“It doesn’t hurt,” Blake said, “but everything sounds funny.”\n\nThe Lakers’ woes aren’t funny though. Plenty has changed since the Lakers beat Minnesota Dec. 20, providing hope they could stay above water in the first game without Bryant because of his knee injury. The Lakers have gone 3-21 since and conceded at least 100 points for 15 consecutive games.\n\n“We didn’t compete in the first half,” Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni said. “We’re not good enough to spot them a half. Hopefully we learn from that.”\n\nThe only positive element entailed Nash, whoe back felt strong enough to throw an alley-opp lob to Wesley Johnson and fight through screens. After cosnidering limiting Nash to 5- to 8-minute bursts to open each half, Nash, who likened his first game since missing the previous 39 as a rookie debut, finished with seven points and nine assists and reported his back feeling the strongest it has all season.\n\n“I feel selfish that we lost, but I felt great just to play in the NBA again and be with my teammates,” said Nash, who will sit out tonight in Cleveland for precautionary reasons. “The game didn’t go as hope. But it’s pretty cool to be out there.”\n\nThat didn’t solve the Lakers’ woes, though.\n\nThe Lakers had no answer Kevin Martin (32 points) and Kevin Love (his 31 points and 17 rebounds marked his 25th game he posted at least 30 points and 15 rebunds, breaking Kevin Garnett’s franchise record). One fan, perhaps mindful Love can could leave Minnesota in 2015 via free agency, pleaded, “Don’t leave Kevin. Don’t leave!”\n\nThe Lakers can only hope Love, a former UCLA standout, dons purple and gold. That’s because the Lakers have no answer to stop the persisting losing.\n\n“Maybe we were feeling sorry for themselves or for seeing their buddies go down,” D’Antoni said. “But there’s no excuse. It can’t happen.”"
