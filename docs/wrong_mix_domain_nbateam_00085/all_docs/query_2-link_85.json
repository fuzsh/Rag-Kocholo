That 90-day period expired on March 27, 2024.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, the buyer could have been entitled to a limited extension. However, those circumstances did not occur.\n\n“I will continue to work with Marc, Alex and the rest of the ownership group to ensure our teams have the necessary resources to compete at the highest levels on and off the court,” said Taylor. “The Timberwolves and Lynx are no longer for sale.”"
