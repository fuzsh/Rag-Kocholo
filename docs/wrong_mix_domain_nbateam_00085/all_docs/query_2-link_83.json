        "text": "Editor’s note: The Timberwolves finished third in Western Conference.\n\nSunday wraps up the NBA season with 13 of the 16 seeds still to be determined for the playoffs. The only locks are the Boston Celtics assured as the top seed in the Eastern Conference, thanks to their 14-game lead, and the Los Angeles Clippers and Dallas Mavericks locked into the four vs. five matchup in the Western Conference.\n\nThe standings in the West are not what anyone envisioned at the start of the season. The league’s two biggest draws, the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors, are headed for the play-in tournament and could be joined there by the Phoenix Suns with stars Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal.\n\nThe top of the conference has three teams tied with a game to go: the Oklahoma City Thunder, Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves. The Nuggets are the defending champions, but the Thunder are coming off three straight losing seasons, and the Timberwolves have finished atop the West only once in their 35-year history—the 2003-04 season was also Minnesota’s only division crown and only year they won a playoff series.\n\nIt has been a banner year for Minnesota as they sold out every home game. The club filled the Target Center at less than 90% capacity last season with only three NBA teams faring worse.\n\nThe Timberwolves hope to reach their first NBA Finals behind Anthony Edwards, who has emerged as one of the league’s best players. It is the kind of season owner Glen Taylor has dreamed of since he bought the team for $88.5 million in 1996. Whether Taylor will still be calling the shots by the end of the playoffs remains up in the air.\n\nIn 2021, Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore reached an agreement to buy the team from Taylor in a multipart transaction that wouldn’t transfer a control stake until 2024. The net present value of the deal was roughly $1.55 billion. It gave Taylor a few more years to lead the team, as well as time for the buyers to raise money to finance each subsequent transaction, but things fell apart in the last few weeks. Taylor said on March 28 that the deal was off due to missed deadlines; the following day the buyers told Sportico that Taylor had breached the terms of their contract.\n\nThis week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said the agreement features a pre-set mechanism for resolving disputes and that it was “not clear whether there will be a role for the league” in the ongoing dispute.\n\nIf the deal falls apart, Rodriguez and Lore will retain the 36% of the club that they have already purchased. A decision on the disputed ownership is expected in the coming weeks."
