        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers have traded guard Steve Blake to the Golden State Warriors, league sources told Yahoo Sports.\n\nThe Warriors will send the Lakers guards Kent Bazemore and MarShon Brooks, sources said.\n\nGolden State has been searching for a veteran guard to bolster its backcourt and reached an agreement on Wednesday afternoon. The Warriors recently acquired guard Jordan Crawford from the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Lakers are determined to shed salary and veterans for assets between now and Thursday's trade deadline. They are discussing several trade possibilities involving forward Jordan Hill too.\n\nBlake is averaging 9.5 points and 7.6 assists for the Lakers this season. He will give Warriors star Stephen Curry the chance to play off the ball, freeing him from playing-making duties to shoot the ball.\n\nBazemore, 24, has shown strong athleticism and impressed league executives with his play for the Warriors' unbeaten summer league entry in Las Vegas."
