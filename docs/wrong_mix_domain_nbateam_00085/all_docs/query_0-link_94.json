They finish the regular season Wednesday at Denver before beginning the postseason at the Los Angeles Clippers or Oklahoma City this weekend.\n\nLove scored 22 of his 40 points in the first quarter. He finished with 14 rebounds and nine assists for the Timberwolves (40-41), who will need to win at Utah on Wednesday to clinch the franchise’s first non-losing season since 2004-05.\n\nDraymond Green added 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Klay Thompson scored 20 for the Warriors, who were playing their fourth game in five nights — and after learning of a big blow to their chances of advancing in the playoffs.\n\nThe team announced before the game that an X-ray on Bogut revealed a fractured right rib. The injury could keep Golden State’s starting center out for the start of the playoffs — and possibly all of the postseason.\n\nThe Warriors also overcame a nothing-too-lose Timberwolves team that has been surging to the finish. In April alone, Minnesota has won at Miami and at Memphis and also beaten San Antonio and Houston at home.\n\nIn the end, the Warriors cleaned up their mistakes and made all the big plays that the Timberwolves couldn’t. Minnesota committed 21 turnovers, while the Warriors had 15.\n\nAfter Love’s 3-pointer moved Minnesota within three, the Warriors leaned on Curry once again. He banked in a left-handed floater and hit a step-back 3-pointer over Corey Brewer during a 6-0 spurt to put the Warriors up 126-116 with 1:25 to play.\n\nCurry walked to the bench during the timeout flexing his muscles as the white-shirt wearing sellout of 19,596 roared to their feet in the final home game of the season.\n\nLove and Curry controlled most of the game, especially in the first half.\n\nLove made three straight 3s to start the game as Minnesota opened a 16-2 lead behind his could-not-miss stroke. He finished the first quarter with 22 points and eight rebounds to put the Timberwolves up 42-28.\n\nAfter Minnesota went ahead 51-32 early in the second quarter, Curry brought the Warriors back.\n\nCurry capped a 23-4 spurt with consecutive 3-pointers before finding a cutting Thompson for a layup to tie the score at 55. Minnesota moved ahead 64-62 at the half.\n\nThe teams traded scores for most of the third quarter. The Warriors built a 104-96 lead early in the fourth quarter and held off the Timberwolves in the closing minutes.\n\nOriginally Published: April 14, 2014 at 11:01 p.m."
