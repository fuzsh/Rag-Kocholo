        "text": "Steve Nash, Steve Blake and Jordan Farmar, the three main point guards on the team Los Angeles Lakers, could return to competition this week. More specifically, today Tuesday when the purple and gold team will face Minnesota Timberwolves, as announced by Mike D'Antoni, the team's coach, this Monday and reported by Dave McMenamin, from ESPNS.LosAngeles.\n\nIn turn, sources of Los Angeles Times They pointed out that the plan of the Lakers It means that Nash and Blake reappear on Tuesday and Farmar waits until Wednesday, against the Cavaliers, when Nash will rest to measure his efforts.\n\nThe three members of the back court Angeleno have seen their performance greatly hampered by injuries this season and their absence, together with major setbacks such as the loss of Kobe Bryant, have diminished the sporting situation of the Lakers (16-31). The return of Nash, Blake and Farmar will in any case mean the loss of minutes for Kendall Marshall.\n\nGasol, absent in the next three home games\n\nOn the other hand, Pau Gasol has not traveled with the Los Angeles team on the expedition that will take the Lakers to visit Minnesota, Cleveland on Wednesday and Philadelphia on Friday."
