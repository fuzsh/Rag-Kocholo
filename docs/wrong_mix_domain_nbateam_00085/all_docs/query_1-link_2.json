        "text": "A sense of sadness and gloom permeated the Lakers, and that happened well before Dwight Howard rubbed it in their face with an endless charade of dunks, blocks and athleticism.\n\nHours before their 134-108 loss Wednesday to the Houston Rockets became official, the Lakers learned they’d lose yet another key piece to their roster. And for once, it didn’t involve an injury.\n\nThe Lakers traded Steve Blake to the Golden State Warriors for two young seldom-used point guards in Kent Bazemore and MarShon Brooks, the first sign of a white flag in the team’s effort to rebuild and trim salary. Blake learned about the deal shortly after participating in pre-game warmups. Soon enough, Blake dressed back into street clothes and shared farewells with teammates, coaches and team officials before departing the arena.\n\n“I was more disappointed that it was him,” Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni said. “There were a lot of guys. Management has to do to retool. You have to do a lot of things. But you hate it for him.”\n\nThat’s because Blake provided everything that D’Antoni wants in his system. Blake relentlessly provides energy, hustling for looseballs, setting up teammates on pick-and-rolls and making outside shots with dependable accuracy. Despite appearing in only 27 games because of a hyperextended right elbow, Blake posted a dependable 9.5 points and 7.6 assists.\n\n“He was a joy to coach,” D’Antoni said. “Every coach should have an opportunity to coach somebody like that. He is one of the toughest guys I’ve ever coached. He’s good. At any team that wants to win, he’ll be a nice piece.”\n\nHis four-year career with the Lakers entailed some tough moments, though. Blake admittedly felt tentative his first two years with the Lakers under Phil Jackson and Mike Brown in part because of their offense and adjusting to Kobe Bryant. He also had a slew of ailments. Blake suffered chicken pox in the first round of the 2011 NBA playoffs. He sat out for 13 games the following season because of a fractured rib. Blake missed a combined 36 games last year because of overlapping injuries in his abdominal muscle and groins.\n\nBut Blake provided some signature moments, such as a 19-point effort in Game 7 of the Lakers’ first-round series win over the Denver Nuggets in 2012 and a game-winning 3-pointer in Houston in November in the Lakers’ first game against Howard since he left the team.\n\nWhat will the Lakers miss the most?\n\n“His professionalism and the way he plays the game,” Lakers guard Jodie Meeks said. “He knows the guard position. He plays through injury and sickness. We’ll miss him as a teammate. It’s the nature of the business. Sometimes that stuff happens.”\n\nThis happened because the Lakers are well aware of their doomed playoff fortunes this season. The move allowed them to save a $4 million in combined salary and luxury taxes. It’s possible Bazermore and/or Brooks could develop at a relatively cheaper price. But for a team that’s ailing so much with an injury-depleted backcourt, Blake’s departure provided one huge dent.\n\n“He’s definitely a great guy and definitely a mentor and a great player and fun to talk to,” Lakers forward Jordan Hill said. “You can talk to him about anything and he’ll listen. He seems pretty quiet, but he’s a guy who will definitely make you laugh and put a smile on your face.”\n\nWhen he stepped on the court, however, his personality changed.\n\n“He’s a tough little small sucka, ain’t he?” Hill said, laughing. “Basketball wise, he’s somebody who competes, plays well and plays hard and tries to make the right play. He’s a tough guy and it’s good to have him out there to guard somebody bigger. He’ll scrap and fight for rebounds and do whatever he’s asked to do.”\n\nRELATED:\n\nJordan Hill wants to stay with the Lakers, but vouches for consistent playing time\n\nLakers trade guard Steve Blake to Warriors\n\nCan the Lakers no longer attract high-level free agents?\n\nFollow L.A. Daily News Lakers beat writer Mark Medina on Twitter. E-mail him at mark.medina@langnews.com\n\nEven with pain throbbing in his right elbow, Lakers guard Steve Blake said he will play tomorrow against Oklahoma City at Staples Center.\n\n“For me unless if I was to get it checked out again and they told me something major was wrong, I’ll just push through it,” Blake said. “Individually, could I be selfish and sit out because I don’t want to have a bad shooting percentage? I guess I could do that, but that’s not the type of person I am. I just want to help the team out and try to get some wins.”\n\nThe Lakers are already nursing plenty of injuries to Kobe Bryant (left knee), Pau Gasol (right groin), Steve Nash (nerve irritation in back, hamstrings), Nick Young (left knee), Jordan Farmar (left hamstring), Jodie Meeks (right ankle) and Xavier Henry (right knee).\n\nStill, Blake looked noticeably limited in the Lakers’ 96-79 loss Tuesday to the Utah Jazz where he shot only 2-of-11 from the field. That coincided with Blake feeling additional pain in his recently hyperextended right elbow in the second half after fighting through a screen. In the past five games since returning from his elbow injury, Blake has shot only 28.6 percent and reported feeling pain when he takes outside shots.\n\nWill this force Blake to become more of a playmaker than a shooter?\n\n“I kind of think I have to,” Blake said. “It’s not like I can’t make the shots. But it’s a little more difficult just with lack of being able to practice 3-point shots as much as I normally do. Maybe I’ll have to pick my spots a little more here or there. But it’s a work in progress. I’m four of five games back and still have to get my legs in a little bit better condition as well and arm strength a little bit more. There’s room for improvement. I just have to get there.”\n\nLakers coach Mike D’Antoni expressed confidence that Blake will.\n\n“He’s got to play and has to figure out what he can do and is comfortable with,” D’Antoni said. “He’s playing great. What he gives us in tenacity, ball pressure and intangibles, we don’t have anybody who is as good as he does.”\n\nRELATED:\n\nSteve Nash to sit out Thursday vs. Oklahoma City\n\nSteve Blake reports more pain in his right elbow\n\nLakers expect Xavier Henry to sit out for another four weeks\n\nSteve Nash leaves second half of Lakers’ 96-79 loss to Utah, sparking varying levels of concern\n\nFollow L.A. Daily News Lakers beat writer Mark Medina on Twitter. E-mail him at mark.medina@langnews.com\n\nLong before everyone cleared off the court, Steve Blake sat motionless on the bench trying to process everything that happened.\n\nThe Lakers’ 96-79 loss Tuesday to the Utah Jazz marked yet another loss, one that plummeted them to the 14th place in the Western Conference. Steve Nash left early for two consecutive games after feeling more nerve irritation in his back. And Blake had just shot an uncharacteristic 2-of-11 from the field, partly after feeling more pain in his recently hyperextended right elbow.\n\n“I was more just frustrated with myself, hoping that I can do more,” Blake said in a solemn tone afterwards. “I felt like this is a game we could’ve won, especially getting up early. Just disappointed. I try to think about what I can do better, take it in and go from there.”\n\nIt seems difficult, though.\n\nBlake went to the sideline momentarily in the second half after getting caught on a screen and feeling further pain in his elbow. Lakers trainer Gary Vitti attended Blake, but as he said afterwards, “I wasn’t going to sit down. I had to play through it.” After all, the Lakers already nurse plenty of injuries to Kobe Bryant (left knee), Pau Gasol (right groin), Nick Young (left knee), Jordan Farmar (left hamstring), Jodie Meeks (right ankle) and Xavier Henry (right knee). Nash’s absence also left the Lakers with only Blake and Kendall Marshall manning the backcourt.\n\nBut the pain in Blake’s elbow bothers him so much that he revealed feeling hurts when he practices, notably when he’s fitting in outside shooting sessions to build his rhythm. It also partly explains why Blake’s shots fell short against Utah.\n\nBlake vowed he will “have to mentally push through it.” But as he showed with his postgame demeanor, the obstacles appear overwhelming.\n\n“I’m frustrated. I don’t like to lose,” Blake said. “It doesn’t matter who’s out there and who’s not. There’s no excuses. Just focus on myself right now. I have to make shots. It’s going to be tougher for me to do that, but I have to try to push through it and figure it out.”\n\nRELATED:\n\nSteve Nash leaves second half of Lakers’ 96-79 loss to Utah, sparking varying levels of concern\n\nSteve Nash expresses optimism he can play Tuesday vs. Utah\n\nSteve Nash — 40 and finally healthy — leads Lakers to win over 76ers\n\nFollow L.A.
