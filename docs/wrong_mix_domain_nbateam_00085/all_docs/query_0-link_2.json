        "text": "Earlier this summer, the Suns parted ways with two assistants in Steve Blake and Larry Greer.\n\nWell, one of those spots has now been filled as Phoenix brings in Brian Randle, who most recently served as a player development coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves this past season. He started as their assistant video coordinator in 2018-19.\n\n“My family and I are incredibly excited to join the Phoenix Suns,” Randle said. “I couldn’t be more excited to work with and learn from Coach Monty Williams. The Suns have a strong young core with a great future ahead. I am grateful and humbled for this opportunity.”\n\nPrior to working with the Wolves, he had a support staff role with USA Basketball.\n\nBefore that, he played four years of college basketball at Illinois and 10 seasons overseas in Germany, Israel and Italy. Randle made it to the Eurocup Final Four, was a two-time Israeli League champion and named that league’s top defender three times.\n\nThe 35 year old will join a Phoenix Suns team that is coming off an impressive 8-0 bubble showing but is one of the youngest teams in the NBA. Having video experience as well as time dissecting film with the youth in Minnesota will help develop the youth here in Phoenix.\n\nWho knows? His time with USA Basketball and being well liked with the players there may help the Suns bring another star to the valley as well.\n\n“I think I have a unique perspective on basketball,” Randle said. “From my 10 years playing in Europe and my time under (Tom) Thibodeau and (Ryan) Saunders. I bring a strong defensive mindset which has been shaped over the years by coaches such as Bruce Weber, Tom Thibodeau and Guy Goodess. My basketball journey has been beyond what I could have imagined. For this and everything, I give God all the glory.”\n\nIt sounds like he can be a good addition to the team and its forward progress.\n\nLet’s give Brian a warm purple and orange welcome."
