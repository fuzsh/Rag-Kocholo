        "text": "Jim Mone/Associated Press\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets continued their point guard clear-out Monday, agreeing to send Steve Blake to the Detroit Pistons for Quincy Miller, per Tim Bontemps of the New York Post.\n\nThe move comes a few days after Brooklyn confirmed the buyout on Deron Williams' contract.\n\nThe Nets acquired Blake in a trade along with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, with Mason Plumlee moving to the Portland Trail Blazers. In 81 games for the Blazers last year, Blake averaged 4.3 points and 3.6 assists in 18.9 minutes a night.\n\nBlake will provide a veteran presence in the Detroit backcourt in the event he sticks with the franchise. Keith Langlois of Pistons.com is a fan of the trade:\n\nIt's doubtful Miller will provide any value to the Nets. RealGM's Shams Charania reported Brooklyn will likely waive the 22-year-old.\n\nBy the time all is said and done, the Nets might have an extra roster spot while saving a little bit of money by offloading Blake's contract."
