        "text": "The question is, will he still be a Timberwolf this time tomorrow? “Twenty-four hours from now? Whooooo,” Beasley said, his voice rising when asked if he still expected to wear a Wolves uniform Thursday night at Utah. “I mean, of course. But if I’m not, I’m not. “I’m just a pawn in this game. L.A. Boston, New Jersey, Orlando, anywhere they decide to move me, then I’ve got to go. I’m not saying I want to, but that’s something I have no control over. I’d love to stay here. It don’t make it no easier if I’ve got to up and move. I got a nice-sized house with a lot of things inside of it, but I’d rather stay. If I’ve got to go, it’s just business.”"
