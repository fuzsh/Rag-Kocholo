        "text": "The Phoenix Suns have hired Brian Randle on their coaching staff as an assistant, the team announced Tuesday.\n\n“My family and I are incredibly excited to join the Phoenix Suns,” said Randle in a team news release. “I couldn’t be more excited to work with and learn from Coach Monty Williams. The Suns have a strong young core with a great future ahead. I am grateful and humbled for this opportunity.”\n\nRandle, 35, served as player development coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves this past 2019-20 season.\n\n“We truly enjoyed our time in Minnesota and will always love our Timberwolves family,” Randle said in the release. “I think I have a unique perspective on basketball from my 10 years playing in Europe and my time under (Tom) Thibodeau and (Ryan) Saunders. I bring a strong defensive mindset which has been shaped over the years by coaches such as Bruce Weber, Tom Thibodeau and Guy Goodess.”\n\nA former player at Illinois (2003-08), Randle initially joined the Timberwolves as an assistant video coordinator for the 2018-19 season after playing 10 seasons overseas.\n\n“My basketball journey has been beyond what I could have imagined,” Randle added. “For this and everything, I give God all the glory.”\n\nThe Suns parted ways with two assistants, Larry Greer, and Steve Blake, earlier this summer after one season under Monty Williams in Phoenix.\n\nPelicans hire former Suns director\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans have hired Daniel Bove, who served as director of athletic performance for the Suns.\n\nBove has \"New Orleans Pelicans | Director of Performance\" on his Twitter account. He was with the team in the Orlando Bubble as the Suns went 8-0 in \"seeding\" games.\n\nHave opinion about current state of the Suns?
