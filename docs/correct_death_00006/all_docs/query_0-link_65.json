It was then called Upper Louisiana or New Spain. In 1805, Missouri became part of the Territory of Louisiana and remained so until 1812 when it became a Territory in its own name. At that time it claimed 20,000 inhabitants. Most of the early settlers came from Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Vermont. The five original districts in Upper Louisiana Territory were St. Louis, Ste. Genevieve, St. Charles, Cape Girardeau and New Madrid. This database is based upon the PIONEER FAMILIES OF MISSOURI, by Bryan and Rose. It consists of early tax lists, Spanish land grants, census records, military records, and extractions from the HISTORY OF MISSOURI by Louis Houck. This is an on-going project with periodic updates. There are over 20,000 linked families as of July 1999. Coordination of data entry was done by the HANCOCK FAMILY ORGANIZATION, descendants of William Hancock who settled in St. Charles County in 1797. Prepared by: Karen J. Hancock Harvey P.O.

Bittick to John H. Bittick Envelope (return address preprinted on envelope) S.G. Bittick MD Henrietta, Texas (postmark) Henrietta, Texas Jun. 14, 1890 Mr. J.H. Bittick Florilla Douglas Co MO --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Envelope (on back of) Florilla, Mo Aug., 12, 1890 (postmark) Henrietta Jun 14, 1890 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Henrietta Clay Co Texas June 14th 1890 Mr. J.H. Bittick Dear Sir & Kinsman I received your letter today and take pleasure in answering it. My Great Grand Father on my father's side was named Francis. He had five sons. Their names were John, Simeon, Thomas, William and Samuel. This Samuel was my Grandfather and I was named for him. 2 My Fathers' name was Francis - he being named for his Grandfather Francis. My Great Grandfather Francis Bittick settled near St. Louis about the year 1800 and my Grandfather Samuel died there when my father was quite a small boy. My Father with his mother moved to Arkansas when my father was quite small. My father moved to Texas 1852. James Bittick who lived in Jefferson County, Missouri 3 and who died there last winter in his 79th year was an own cousin to my father. I had corresponded with him last year. He was a son of old John Bittick a brother to my Grandfather Samuel. Every Bittick in Missouri I presume is a descendant of my Great Grandfather Francis. My Great Grand Father Francis had a brother named Samuel who came with him from Wales to America. This Brother settled in Tennessee. 4 And Tennessee is full of his descendents, a good many of his descendants are in Texas, some of whom I have seen. But I have never in my life seen a Kinsman of my father's name who was a descendant of my Great Grand father Francis - and it would be a curiosity to me to see one of my father's people. 5 My father had no brothers and I have none. I had one sister and she has been dead about fourteen years. My father died 15 years ago at the age of 64. My mother is alive and lives with me, she is 81. She has told me more about my father's people than any one else. She lived in Missouri when a girl and knows a good deal about the old stock. 6 I have heard her talk about the Hilderbrands you speak of. My Mother knew all the old members of the Bittick family. You ask if my father had an uncle by the name of Thomas. Yes. He (had) an Uncle Thomas, an Uncle John and (an) Uncle William and an Uncle Simeon. Well you can tell from this what our relationship is. I will be 43 years old next September. I have six children 3 boys and 3 girls. My oldest boy, 19 years old, is called Leonard Marshall. 7 My next boy is named Francis E. Bittick and my next boy is named Samuel F. My oldest Daughter is named Mary Lena, she is 17 - she has just got home from college. My next girl is Leona V. She is 15 years old and my youngest named Birdie is 18 months old. I have been in Texas ever since I was four years old and don't know anything about any other Country. When you write tell me your father's Name and your Grandfather's name 8 and your Great Grandfather's name. I know we are descendants of the same stock and the same blood courses our veins. Write and tell me all you can think to say for I like to get long letters. Send me your Photograph and I will send you mine. How much do you weigh? I weigh 216 but a good deal of this is tallow. Yours Truly. Samuel G. Bittick Letter within Bible, John R. Bittick (1813-1904), written on lined writing tablet pages folded in half, black ink. Samuel G. Bittick to John H. Bittick, 14 Jun 1890. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 28, 1979 Janette I. Smoot 1061 Black Oak Drive Roseburg, Oregon 97470 Dear Janette, ... The Pike county, Arkansas records of the Court were destroyed by fire the Spring of 1855 and again in 1895. Valuable information of a historical and genealogical nature was unfortunately destroyed. I am dedicated to the goal of gathering as much information possible concerning the families and related families of this time and area. My fourth great-grandfather, Giles Kelley, came to Arkansas and settled on Wolf Creek, in what is now Pike County, Arkansas, November 1815. Also, at a very early date, James Guinn Melson located near the Little Missouri River, south of the Kelley's in what became Pike county, Arkansas. In a visit to the Clark county, Arkansas Courthouse last April, and gleaning the earliest records available, which begin for the year 1819, I remember seeing the name of James G. Melson on a document dated for that year. Unfortunately I did not make reference of it or copy that particular record. I do have the following, recorded in Circuit Court Record Book B, pages 54-55: MARCH TERM 1822 On motion and petition of Sundary Inhabitants of the County of Clark for a road passing by the residence of James G. Melson and from thence to the Missouri, commencing in Missouri Township. It is ordered that Jacob Chandler, John Shears (Cheairs) and William Kelley be appointed Commissioners to view and mark out said road. Clark county, Arkansas Circuit Court Record Book B, page 64: MARCH TERM 1822 Ordered by the Court that the road leading by James G. Melson's to the Little Missouri, commencing in the Missouri Township, be discontinued. There are no doubt other records mentioning his name within the Clark county, Arkansas records encompassing the years 1819 through 1829. A careful examination would probably reveal this. Nevertheless, it can be shown that James Guinn Melson was a very early settler of Arkansas, and that he located in what was then the Little Missouri Township of Clark county, Arkansas. 1830 Clark County, Arkansas Census - Little Missouri Township: Name Males Females Slaves 2. Kelley, William 212001 110101 0 3. Melsum, James G. 10101001 1211001 0 14. Melsum, Thomas 20001 0001 0 It is apparent that James G. Melson and William Kelley, who was my third great-grandfather were \"neighbors\" because of their proximity within this census record. A Government Land Office was established at Washington, Hempstead county, Arkansas in 1832. On November 6, 1832, James Guiin Melson purchased the West half of the Northeast Quarter of Section 18, in Township 9 South, Range 23 West, comprising 80 acres of land. The purchase price was $1.25 per acre or $100.00 and the (U.S. Land Patent) office issued a patent, dated April 10, 1837. This record is (found) in the Washington, Arkansas Patent Book, Volume 1, page 16, records of the Bureau of Land Management, Eastern States Office, Silver Spring, Maryland ... Pike county, Arkansas was formed from Clark and Hempstead counties, Arkansas on November 1, 1833 by act of the Territorial Legislature. A Tax List for the year 1834, Pike County, Arkansas Territory, (has) the following: Melson, J.G. Quanity of land = 80 Value of dwelling house = 50 Number of horses over 2 years old = 3 Number of cattle over 3 years old = 8 No. of Pole Tax = (blank) Territorial Taxes = .40 County Tax = 2.30 Milson, Thomas Value of dwelling house = 25 Number of horses over 2 years old = 2 Number of cattle over 3 years old = 3 No. of Pole Tax = 1 County Tax = 1.06¼ Bittick, Francis Value of dwelling house = 20 Number of horses over 2 years old = 2 Number of cattle over 3 years old = 3 No. of Pole Tax = 1 County Tax = .97¼ Francis Bittick married Mary Melson, 7 Feb 1833, by William Kelley, JP, recorded in Clark county, Arkansas Marriage Book A, page 98. There is no doubt that ... Mary Melson is a daughter of James Guinn Melson. Examine the 1830 Clark Co., Ark. Census. The 1850 Census of Hempstead county, Arkansas, which I will give later, shows that Mary, wife of Francis Bittick is 40 years of age. This would mean she was about 20 years of age during the 1830 Census year and about 23 when she married Francis Bittick. James Guinn Melson is the only one enumerated who could have been her father (1830). A Tax List for the year 1835, Pike county, Arkansas Territory gives the following information: Melson, Jas. G. Land = 80 House = 50 Horses = 5 Cattle = 10 Pole Tax = x Territorial Tax = 2.92½ Milson, Thomas House = 25 Horses = 1 Cattle = 3 Pole Tax = 1 County Tax = .81¼ Bittick, Francis House = 25 Horses = 2 Cattle = 3 Pole Tax = 1 County Tax = 1.00 ... that James Guinn Melson is not indicated as ... paying Poll Tax may be an indication he was exempt due to ... age. By the year 1836, other purchases of land were made from the Land Office at Washington, Hempstead county, Arkansas by James Guinn Melson, Thomas Milson, Francis Bittick, Solomon Melson, and Chesley Rogers. There is evidence that ... Chesley Rogers may have married into the Melson family ... On January 13, 1836, James G. Melson purchased the NW¼ of the SW¼ of Section 18, Township 9 South, Range 23 West, comprising 40 acres of land @ $1.25 per acre ($50.00), recorded in (Washington, Arkansas) Patent Vol. 3, page 438. On January 23, 1836, Thomas Milson purchased the SE¼ of the SE¼ of Section 5, Township 9 South, Range 23 West, comprising 40 acres of land @ $1.25 per acre ($50.00), recorded in Washington, Arkansas Patent Book Vol. 4, page 128. On March 3, 1836, Francis Bittick purchased the W½ of the SE¼ of Section 7, Township 9 South, Range 23 West, comprising 80 acres of land @ $1.25 per acre ($100.00), recorded in (Washington, Arkansas Patent Book) Vol. 8, page 158. On May 23, 1836, James Guinn Melson purchased the E½ of the NW¼ of Section 18, Township 9 South, Range 23 West, comprising 77.50 acres of land @ $1.25 per acre ($96.88), recorded in (Washington, Arkansas Patent Book) Vol. 8, page 152. On June 25, 1836, Chesley Rogers purchased the SW¼ of the SW¼ of Section 5, Township 9 South, Range 23 West, comprising 40 acres of land @ $1.25 per acre ($50.00), recorded in (Washington, Arkansas Patent Book) Vol. 5, page 344. On November 4, 1836, Solomon Melson purchased the SE¼ of the SW¼ of Section 7, Township 9 South, Range 23 West, comprising 40 acres of land @ $1.25 per acre ($50.00), recorded in (Washington, Arkansas Patent Book) Vol. 6, page 103. On November 7, 1836, Francis Bittick purchased the SW¼ of the SW¼ of Section 7, Township 9 South, Range 23 West, comprising 40 acres of land @ $1.25 per acre ($50.00), recorded in (Washington, Arkansas Patent Book) Vol. 6, page 109. A Tax List for the year 1835, Pike county, Arkansas Territory gives the following information: Melson, Jas. G. Lands = 80 House = 100 Horses = 3 Cattle = 15 Pole Tax = x Territorial Tax = .80 County Tax = 2.58 3/4 Milson, Thomas Lands = 40 House = 75 Horses = 1 Cattle = 6 Pole Tax = 1 Territorial Tax = .40 County Tax = 1.43 Melson Solomon House = 20 Cattle = 3 Pole Tax = x County Tax = .60 For the years 1837 and 1838, James G. Melson and Solomon Melson's names appear in the Pike county, Arkansas Tax Lists. The next two lists, for the years 1839 and 1840 give valuable information that indicate the strong possiblity that James Guinn Melson is the father of Solomon Melson. Carefully note the land descriptions. A Tax List for the year 1839, Pike county, Arkansas: Melson, J.G. E½-NW¼ Sec. 18, T9S, R23W, 77 acres = $231 SW¼-SW¼ Sec. 4, T9S, R23W, 40 acres = $120 W½-NE¼ Sec. 18, T9S, R23W, 80 acres = $240 (1832) NW¼-SE¼ Sec. 18, T9S, R23W, 40 acres = $120 Millson, Thos. SE¼-SE¼ Sec. 5, T9S, R23W, 40 acres = $120 Melson, Solomon SE¼-SW¼ Sec. 7, T9S, R23W, 40 acres = $120 (1836) Note ... James Guinn Melson owns the SW¼ of the SW¼ of Section 4 in Township 9 South, Range 23 West comprising 40 acres of land. It is the same land purchased by Chesley Rogers fromt he Land Office at Washington, Arkansas on June 25, 1836. The only information I have other than census records that give insight into Chesley Rogers is taken from the Confederate Biographical File of one of his sons. This biographical memoranda was collected by the Arkansas History Commission in puruance of Act No. 353, Acts 1911. The following is taken from the file of Commodore Jackson Rodgers: 1. Full Name (Do not use initials): COMMODORE JACKSON RODGERS 3. Exact date and place of birth: Dec. 25, 1842 in the county of CLARK state of ARKANSAS. 4. Full name of the subject's father: CHESLEY HUGHES RODGERS, he lived at HEMP. CO., ARK. Born, state of SOUTH CAROLINA. 5. Maiden name in full of the subject' mother: LUCINDA NELSON. 17. Maiden name in full of the subject's wie and date and place of marriage: ANN ELIZA PRIMM, 1865, UNION CO., ARK., she was the daughter of NATHAN & LUCINDA PRIM. Note ... Commodore Jackson Rodgers, son of Chesley Rodgers indicated his mother was Lucinda Nelson. Chesley Rodgers is enumerated in the 1840 Census of Pike county, Arkansas, Missouri Township. It appears he ... married about 1836 or 1837 ... The original land he purchased he has conveyed to James Guinn Melson by 1839 ... I have (not) found (a) record of Nelson families or family living in the immediate vicinity of Missouri Township, Pike county, Arkasnas .... I believe Lucinda to have been a Melson instead of Nelson, a daughter of James Guinn Melson. A Tax List for the year 1840, Pike county, Arkansas: Melson, Solomon Poll Tax = 1 NW¼-SW¼ Sec. 18, T9S, R23W, 40 acres = $120 E½-NW¼ Sec. 18, T9S, R23W, 77 acres = $231 SW¼-SW¼ Sec. 4, T9S, R23W, 40 acres = $120 W½-SE¼ Sec. 18, T9S, R23W, 80 acres = $240 NW¼-SE¼ Sec. 18, T9S, R23W, 40 acres = $120 SE¼-SW¼ Sec. 7, T9S, R23W, 40 acres = $120 no description , 80 acres = $240 Horses = 3 Cattle = 16 State Tax = 1.78 County Tax = 8.11 Note ... all the property owned by James Guinn Melson is in possession of Solomon Melson in 1840. James Guinn Melson disappears from record after the year 1839. I don't think it would be incorrect to assume that James Guinn Melson has died during the later part of the year 1839 (and) ... died having a Last Will and Testament and left all his real estate to Solomon Melson. If he and died without Will (intestate) ... the tax list for the year 1840 would have indicated (ie.) \"Estate of James G. Melson\" (or James G. Melson, Est. or J.G. Melson Est.) I believe this is a valuable clue and strong evidence Solomon Melson was a \"son\" of James Guinn Melson, certainly he was his \"heir.\" Thomas Milson is listed on the 1840 Tax List as well as Chesley Rodgers. 1840 Census, Pike County, Arkansas - Missouri Township: Males Females 6. Thomas Nelson (sic) 03201 10001 8. Chesly Rogers 10001 00001 9.

What is not known, is James' origins. In one theory, it's claimed his father was a John Melson, a German immigrant, who had entered North America via an unnamed Texas Gulf port in the mid-1700s, then worked his way up the Mississippi to what was then French/Spanish \"Missouri\", where he settled. John is, in this theory, alleged to have served as an Indian scout under Mad Anthony Wayne during the Revolutionary War and to have returned to what was to become Missouri afterward to found his family. A nice, even romantic story, but completely undocumented, so far as I have been able to determine. There are a number of questions arising from this theory, as well, not least of which is why John, a German in French/Spanish territory would travel east to the American colonies to take part in a war which affected him not at all. As well, if John _were_ German, it's not unreasonable to suppose he'd give his son a German name - Jacob, for example, which is the German equivalent of James. Then, where did the Gwinn in James Gwinn's name come from? Scarcely germanic and my suspicion is that it's a name in the ancestry of an \"English\" John or, perhaps, of his wife. Add these questions to James established presence in Mississippi Territory in the years 1806-1813, and it seems possible that James and his family (father, mother, siblings) were among those who migrated to the south and west either along the Natchez Trace or down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers from western Pennsylvania. So, is there anybody here who might have information that would shed some light on James Gwinn Melson, Rosanna Macfall/Ballew? Hints, suggestions ... -- all gratefully accepted. I have a whole field of rocks to turn over, but I need a starting place. Many thanks in advance.

Verner Samuel Bittick and John Williams v. The State. Supreme Court of Texas Volume 40 page 117 1874, Decided Appeal from Delta. Tried below before the Hon. John C. Easton. Bittick and Williams were indicted, August, 1873, for an assault with intent to kill and murder one J.H. Verner. The indictment charged \"that on the first day of August, 1871, in the county of Delta, in the state of Texas, with force and arms, Samuel Bittick and John Williams an assault upon the body of J.H. Verner did make, and with intent him, feloniously and of malice aforethought, to kill and murder, against the peace and dignity of the state.\" At the same term the case was tried. The district attorney did not insist on a verdict for a greater offense than an aggravated assault. The judge gave a verbal charge, reading to the jury * * * . The court refused the following charges asked by defendants: 1. That in order to a conviction of an aggravated assault, upon an indictment for an assault with intent to murder, it is necessary for the indictment to charge and the proof to sustain the circumstances and facts constituting the aggravation. 2. Under an indictment for an assault with intent to murder, the defendants may be convicted of a simple assault, but not for an aggravated assault, unless the facts relied upon as constituting the aggravation be set out in the indictment and proved. 3. On an indictment for assault with intent to murder, the defendant may be convicted of any lower grade of assault, provided said indictment be good upon its face for the offense for which the defendant is convicted; otherwise, such conviction cannot be sustained. The jury found the defendants guilty of \"an aggravated assault and battery,\" and assessed the fine at one hundred dollars against each. Motions in arrest of judgment and for new trial were overruled, and the defendants appealed. The facts are set out in the opinion. Affirmed. No brief for appellants came to the hands of the reporters. Browne, for the state. Opinion Gray, Associate Justice. Appellants were jointly indicted for assault with intent to murder. The indictment charges that the accused, with force and arms, upon the body of J.H. Verner an assault did make, and with intent him, feloniously and of malice aforethought, to kill and murder. It also alleges the time and county, but does not allege the instrument or means used, nor the circumstances how, or in what particular place the assault was made. Exceptions by motion to quash, in charges asked to the jury, and by motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment, were made to this indictment in various forms testing its sufficiency in charging any offense; that it is not in intelligible words; that evidence of an aggravated assault, or aggravated assault and battery, were not sufficient to convict under it; and finally, that a verdict of \"guilty of aggravated assault and battery,\" should not be held valid under it, when the evidence only showed an aggravated assault. As to the sufficiency of the indictment, it clearly was good for a simple assault, even at common law, and should not have been quashed on exceptions. It was also valid and sufficient in charging an assault with intent to murder, as we recently held in Martin v. The State. The exact point, that it is not necessary to allege the means or instrument used, was also held in The State v. Croft which was decided by common law rules, and has since been followed in other cases. At the trial the prosecution did not contend for a conviction of assault with intent to murder, but only for an aggravated assault. The court read to the jury the articles of the code relating to assaults and batteries, and aggravated assaults and batteries, and their punishment, and the article of the penal code * * * which provides that, on indictments for assaults with intent to commit certain offenses, including the intent to murder, \"the jury may acquit the defendant of the offense charged, and may, according to the facts of the case, find the defendant guilty of an aggravated assault, or of assault and battery, or of a simple assault, and affix the proper penalty to which such offense is liable by law.\" The court in effect held, that the accused might be convicted of an aggravated assault under the indictment, and refused charges to the effect that they could not do so, because the indictment did not set out either of the state of circumstances, specified in article 498 of the code, as the criteria distinguishing aggravated assault or battery from common assault and battery or simple assault. It is quite clear that the charges asked were in conflict with the plain provisions of article 498, which the court read to the jury, and by which it was justified in refusing them. So the law is written, is a sufficient answer to the ingenious argument of counsel. It is further assigned as error, that the verdict, \"guilty of aggravated assault and battery,\" is not warranted by the indictment, nor by the evidence, and that it will not support the judgment for the lowest fine allowed in such cases. It is true, that the evidence does not prove a battery, and the formal and proper verdict on such an indictment would be only, guilty of aggravated assault. But that the verdict does find this, is clear. Does its including also a battery vitiate the whole? We think not; and especially as the same penalty and judgment apply to the one as to the other. It is not a material error. Finally, exception was taken to a ruling of the court upon practice as to the order of introducing testimony, which is also assigned as error. The state proved its case by one witness, and rested. The defendants introduced one witness whose evidence greatly varied from and contradicted that of the state's witness, and rested. Thereupon the state introduced another witness in rebuttal, who corroborated the first, and denied that defendants' witness was present at the assault, and again rested. Then defendants offered to introduce another witness, wife of their first, to rebut the state's last witness, and in corroboration of her husband, to which the state objected, and the witness was excluded. This was in accordance with the rule as stated by Greenleaf, section 469a, and the usual practice in Texas. But we do not regard it as a fixed, invariable rule, which the court may not relax. Exercising a sound discretion, it might have been relaxed in favor of defendant, but we do not perceive in this record any reason why it should have been done. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed.
