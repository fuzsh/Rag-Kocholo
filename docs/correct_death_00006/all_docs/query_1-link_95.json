        "text": "This article is about the singer. For other uses, see Johnny Cash (disambiguation).\n\nJohn R. \"Johnny\" Cash (February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was a singer-songwriter, actor, and author,[1] widely considered one of the most influential American musicians of the 20th century.[2] Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple induction in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.\n\nCash was known for his deep bass-baritone voice,[lower-alpha 1] distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, a rebelliousness[5][6] coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts,[7][page needed] and trademark look, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black\".[lower-alpha 2] He traditionally began his concerts with the simple \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.\"[lower-alpha 3], followed by his signature \"Folsom Prison Blues\". Much of Cash's music echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career.[11] His best-known songs included \"I Walk the Line\", \"Folsom Prison Blues\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\" and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\"; and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\" and \"Rock Island Line\".[12] During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, most notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nJohnny Cash was born on February 26, 1932 in Kingsland, Arkansas, he grew up with seven[14] children, such as Ray Cash (May 13, 1897, Kingsland, Arkansas – December 23, 1985, Hendersonville, Tennessee) and Carrie Cloveree (née Rivers; March 13, 1904, Rison, Arkansas – March 11, 1991, Hendersonville, Tennessee). At birth, he[15] was named J. R. Cash. When Cash enlisted in the Air Force, they wouldn't let him use initials as his name, so he started to use the legal name John R. Cash. In 1954, Cash signed contracts with Sun Records, dropping his middle name; and took the stage as Johnny Cash.[6] The Cash children were: Roy, Margaret Louise, Jack, J. R., Reba, Joanne and Tommy.[16][17] His younger brother, Tommy Cash, also became a successful country artist. In 1935 at the age of 3, the Cash family settled in Dyess, Arkansas. He started working in cotton fields at the age of five, singing along with his family while working. The family farm was flooded on at least two occasions, which later inspired him to write the song \"Five Feet High and Rising\".[page needed] His family's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties. Cash was very close to his older brother, Jack.[19] In May 1944, Jack pulled into a whirling head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two. He died on May 20, 1944 at the age of 15.[page needed] Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident. According to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but he and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day, causing his mother to urge Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working, as the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in heaven.[6]\n\nCash's early memories were dominated by gospel music and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of twelve. When Cash was young, he had a high tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone.[20] In high school he sang on a local radio station; decades later he released an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother's Hymn Book. He was also significantly influenced by traditional Irish music that he heard performed weekly by Dennis Day on the Jack Benny radio program.[page needed] Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force on July 7, 1950.[22] After basic training at Lackland Air Force Base and technical training at Brooks Air Force Base, both in San Antonio, Texas, Cash was assigned to the 12th Radio Squadron Mobile of the U.S. Air Force Security Service at Landsberg, Germany as a Morse Code Intercept Operator for Soviet Army transmissions.[23] It was there he created his first band, named \"The Landsberg Barbarians\".[24] He was the first radio operator to pick up the news of the death of Joseph Stalin. He was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant on July 3, 1954, and returned to Texas.[26]\n\nMarriages and family[]\n\nOn July 18, 1951, while in Air Force training, Cash met 17-year-old Vivian Liberto at a roller skating rink in her native San Antonio. They dated for three weeks, until Cash was deployed to Germany for a three-year tour. During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of pages of love letters. On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio. The ceremony was performed by her uncle, Father Vincent Liberto. They had four daughters: Rosanne, Kathy, Cindy and Tara. Liberto stated that Cash's drug and alcohol abuse as well as constant touring, affairs with other women, and his close relationship with June Carter led her to file for divorce in 1966. Cash's career was handled by Saul Holiff, a London, Ontario, promoter and this relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic My Father and the Man in Black.[28] In 1968, 13 years after they first met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, Cash proposed to June Carter, of the famed Carter Family, during a live performance in London, Ontario.[29] The couple married on March 1, 1968, in Franklin, Kentucky. They had one child together, John Carter Cash, born March 3, 1970. Cash and Carter continued to work together and tour for 35 years until June's death in May 2003. Cash died four months later the same year.[6]\n\nHeritage[]\n\nCash researched his heritage and found a mix of mostly Scottish and English ancestry. He learned, upon researching his paternal heritage, that he was of Scottish royal descent, traced back to Malcolm IV of Scotland.[30][31][32] After meeting with the then-laird of Falkland, Fife, Major Michael Crichton-Stuart, Cash traced his family tree to 11th-century Fife.[34] Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family.\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly career[]\n\nIn 1954, Cash moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he formed a band called The Tennessee Two, which later became The Tennessee Three. Cash visited the Sun Records studio, where he got a recording contract. After auditioning for Sam Phillips, singing gospel songs, Phillips told him that he didn't record gospel music any longer, so Cash switched it to country. Phillips told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell\", although in a 2002 interview Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.[36] Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. Cash earned his stage name Johnny Cash. One of his early recordings, such as \"Hey Porter\" and \"Cry! Cry! Cry!\", which were released in June, and met success on the country hit parade.\n\nOn December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley dropped in on Phillips while Carl Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks, with Jerry Lee Lewis backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio and the four started an impromptu jam session. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived and have since been released under the title Million Dollar Quartet. In Cash: the Autobiography, Cash wrote that he was the one farthest from the microphone and was singing in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country Top 5, and \"I Walk the Line\" became No. 1 on the country charts and entered the pop charts Top 20. \"Home of the Blues\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a long-playing album. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label partly due to the fact that Phillips wasn't keen on Johnny recording gospel, and he was only getting a 3% royalty as opposed to the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis. The following year Cash left the label to sign a lucrative offer with Columbia Records, where his single \"Don't Take Your Guns to Town\" became one of his biggest hits.\n\nEarly in his career, he was given the teasing nickname The Undertaker by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes - though he only did so because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.[37]\n\nIn the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included Mother Maybelle's daughters, Anita, June and Helen. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s he appeared on Pete Seeger's short lived television series Rainbow Quest.[38] He also acted in and wrote and sang the opening theme for a 1961 film entitled Five Minutes to Live, later re-released as Door-to-door Maniac.\n\nOutlaw image[]\n\nAs the 1950s come to an end, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to amphetamines and barbiturates. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with Waylon Jennings, who was heavily addicted to amphetamines. Cash used the uppers to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening drug addiction. In a behind-the-scenes look at The Johnny Cash Show, Cash claims to have \"tried every drug there was to try.\"[citation needed]\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash's frenetic creativity was still delivering hits. His rendition of \"Ring of Fire\" was a crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on the country charts and entering the Top 20 on the pop charts. The song was written by June Carter and Merle Kilgore. It was originally performed by June's sister, but the signature mariachi-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash,[citation needed] who said that it had come to him in a dream. Vivian Liberto claimed a different version of the origins of \"Ring of Fire\". In her book, I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny, Liberto states that Cash gave Carter the credit for monetary reasons.[39]\n\nIn June 1965, his truck caught fire due to an overheated wheel bearing, triggering a forest fire that burnt several hundred acres in Los Padres National Forest in California.[40][41] When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, \"I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it.\"[page needed] The fire destroyed 508 acres (206 ha), burning the foliage off three mountains and driving off 49 of the refuge's 53 endangered condors.[42] Cash was unrepentant and claimed, \"I don't care about your damn yellow buzzards.\" The federal government sued him and was awarded $125,172 ($936741 in 2024 dollars). Cash eventually settled the case and paid $82,001.[43] He said he was the only person ever sued by the government for starting a forest fire.[page needed]\n\nAlthough Cash carefully cultivated a romantic outlaw image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors, each stay lasted only a single night. His most infamous run-in with the law occurred while on tour in 1965, when he was arrested October 4 by a narcotics squad in El Paso, Texas. The officers suspected he was smuggling heroin from Mexico, but found instead 688 Dexedrine capsules and 475 Equanil tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a suspended sentence.\n\nCash had also been arrested on May 11, 1965, in Starkville, Mississippi, for trespassing late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (This incident gave the spark for the song \"Starkville City Jail\", which he discussed on his live At San Quentin album.)[citation needed] In the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of concept albums, including Sings the Ballads of the True West (1965), an experimental double record mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration, and Bitter Tears (1964), with songs highlighting the plight of the Native Americans. His drug addiction was at its worst at this point, and his destructive behavior led to a divorce from his first wife and canceled performances. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, \"Jackson\", won a Grammy Award.[citation needed]\n\nCash's final arrest was in 1967 in Walker County, Georgia, after being involved in a car accident while carrying a bag of prescription pills. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down, and then spent the night in a LaFayette, Georgia jail. The singer was released after a long talk with Sheriff Ralph Jones, who warned him of his dangerous behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience for saving his life, and he later came back to LaFayette to play a benefit concert that attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.[44] Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: “I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"[45]\n\nCash curtailed his use of drugs for several years in 1968, after a spiritual epiphany in the Nickajack Cave, when he attempted to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs. He descended deeper into the cave, trying to lose himself and \"just die\", when he passed out on the floor. He reported being exhausted and feeling at the end of his rope when he felt God's presence in his heart and managed to struggle out of the cave (despite the exhaustion) by following a faint light and slight breeze. To him, it was his own rebirth. June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him conquer his addiction. Cash proposed onstage to June at a concert at the London Gardens in London, Ontario, Canada, on February 22, 1968; the couple married a week later (on March 1) in Franklin, Kentucky. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had \"cleaned up\".[46]\n\nHe rediscovered his Christian faith, taking an \"altar call\" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend Hank Snow. According to longtime friend Marshall Grant, Cash's 1968 rebirth experience did not result in his completely stopping use of amphetamines. However, beginning in 1970, Cash ended all drug use for a period of seven years. Grant claims that the birth of Cash's son, John Carter Cash, inspired Cash to end his dependence. Cash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was once again addicted, and entered the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage, California for rehabilitation. Cash managed to stay off drugs for several years, but by 1989, he was dependent again and entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center. In 1992, he entered the Loma Linda Behavioural Medicine Centre in Loma Linda, California for his final rehabilitation (several months later, his son followed him into this facility for treatment).[47][48][49]\n\nFolsom Prison Blues[]\n\nCash felt great compassion for prisoners. He began performing concerts at prisons starting in the late 1950s. His first prison concert was on January 1, 1959 at San Quentin State Prison.[50] These performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison (1968) and Johnny Cash at San Quentin (1969). The Folsom Prison record was introduced by a rendition of his \"Folsom Prison Blues\", while the San Quentin record included the crossover hit single \"A Boy Named Sue\", a Shel Silverstein-penned novelty song that reached No. 1 on the country charts and No. 2 on the U.S. Top Ten pop charts. The AM versions of the latter contained profanities which were edited out. The modern CD versions are unedited and thus also longer than the original vinyl albums, though they retain the audience reaction overdubs of the originals. Cash performed at the Österåker Prison in Sweden in 1972. The live album På Österåker (\"At Österåker\") was released in 1973. \"San Quentin\" was recorded with Cash replacing \"San Quentin\" with \"Österåker\".\n\nActivism for Native Americans[]\n\nIn 1965, Johnny and his wife June Carter Cash appeared on Pete Seeger’s short-lived TV show Rainbow Quest, where he explained his start as an activist for Native Americans: “In ’57 I wrote a song called “Old Apache Squaw” and then forgot the so-called Indian protest for a while, but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice.”[51] Columbia, the label Cash was recording for then, was opposed to putting the song on his next album, considering it \"too radical for the public\".[52] Cash singing songs of Indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the mainstream of country-music in the 1950s, which was dominated by the image of the righteous cowboy, who simply makes the native’s soil his own.[53]\n\nIn 1964, coming off of the chart success that his previous album “I Walk The Line” had been[54] he recorded the aforementioned album Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian. The songs featured stories of a multitude of native peoples, mostly of their violent oppression by the Settlers: The Pimas (“The Ballad of Ira Hayes”), the Navajos (“Navajo”), the Apaches (“Apache Tears”), the Lakotas (“Big foot”), the Senecas (“As Long as the Grass Shall Grow”), and the Cherokees (“Talking Leaves”). Cash wrote three of the songs himself, one with the help of Johnny Horton, but the majority of the protest songs were written by folk-artist Peter LaFarge,[55] son of Native Activist and Pulitzer-Price winner Oliver La Farge, who Cash met in New York in the 1960s and who he admired for his activism.[56] The albums single “The Ballad of Ira Hayes” was neglected by the unpolitical radio at the time, and the record label denied it any promotion, due to its provocative, protesting and thus “unappealing” nature.[57] Cash faced a lot of resistance, he was even urged by an Editor of a Country Magazine to leave the Country Music Association; “You and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks, country artists and country DJs.”[58]\n\nIn reaction, on Aug. 22, 1964, Cash posted a letter as an advertisement in Billboard Magazine, calling out the record industry as cowards: “D.J.’s — station managers — owners, etc., Where are your guts?”, he demands - “I had to fight back when I realized that so many stations are afraid of Ira Hayes. Just one question: WHY???” He concludes the letter with “‘Ira Hayes’ is strong medicine … So is Rochester, Harlem, Birmingham and Vietnam.” [59] Cash kept promoting the song himself and used his influence on Radio-DJs he knew [58] to eventually make the song climb to No.3 on the Country Charts, while the album rose to No.2 on the album charts.[60] Later, on The Johnny Cash Show, he tells stories about the native American plight, both in song and through short films, like the history of the Trail of Tears, where in the 1830s, thousands of Cherokees died of cold and starvation after being forced to leave what had been their homeland for centuries and trail to the state of New York, as part of the Indian Removal Act.[61] In 1966, in response to his activism, the singer was adopted by Seneca Nation’s Turtle Clan as one of their own and performed benefits in 1968 in the Rosebud Reservation, close to the historical landmark of the battle at Wounded Knee to raise money to help build a school, he also played at the D-Q University in the 1980s.[62]\n\n\"The Man in Black\"[]\n\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Cash hosted a short-lived variety show on ABC, called The Johnny Cash Show. The Statler Brothers opened up for him in every episode; the Carter Family and rockabilly legend Carl Perkins were also part of the regular show entourage. Cash enjoyed booking mainstream performers as guests; including Neil Young, Louis Armstrong, Neil Diamond, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition, James Taylor, Ray Charles, Roger Miller, Derek and the Dominos, and Bob Dylan. During the same period, he contributed the title song and other songs to the film Little Fauss and Big Halsey, which starred Robert Redford, Michael J. Pollard, and Lauren Hutton. The title song, The Ballad of Little Fauss and Big Halsey, written by Carl Perkins, was nominated for a Golden Globe award.[63] Cash met Dylan in the mid-1960s, becoming closer friends when they were neighbors in the late 1960s, in Woodstock, New York. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan on Dylan's country album Nashville Skyline and also wrote the album's Grammy-winning liner notes. Another artist who received a major career boost from The Johnny Cash Show was Kris Kristofferson, who started making a name for himself as a singer/songwriter. During a live performance of Kristofferson's \"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\", Cash refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to marijuana intact:\n\nOn a Sunday morning sidewalk\n\nI'm wishin', Lord, that I was stoned.[64]\n\nBy 1971, \"The Man in Black\" became a household name. He performed dressed all in black during live performances. This outfit stood in contrast to the costumes worn by most of the major country acts in his day: rhinestone suits and cowboy boots. Cash wrote the song to explain his dress code:\n\nWe're doing mighty fine I do suppose\n\nIn our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes\n\nBut just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back\n\nUp front there ought to be a man in black.\n\nHe wore black on behalf of the poor and , on behalf of \"the prisoner who has long paid for his crime\", and on behalf of those who have been betrayed by age or drugs. \"And\", Cash added, \"with the Vietnam War as painful in my mind as it was in most other Americans', I wore it 'in mournin' for the lives that could have been.'... Apart from the Vietnam War being over, I don't see much reason to change my position... The old are still neglected, the poor are still poor, the young are still dying before their time, and we're not making many moves to make things right. There's still plenty of darkness to carry off.\"\n\nHe and his band had initially worn black shirts because that was the only matching color they had among their various outfits. He wore other colors on stage early in his career, but he claimed to like wearing black both on and off stage. He stated that, political reasons aside, he simply liked black as his on-stage color.[page needed] The outdated US Navy's winter blue uniform used to be referred to by sailors as \"Johnny Cashes\", as the uniform's shirt, tie, and trousers are solid black.[66]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Cash's popularity and number of hit songs began to decline. He made commercials for Amoco, an unpopular enterprise in an era in which oil companies made high profits while consumers suffered through high gasoline prices and shortages. However, his autobiography (the first of two), Man in Black, was published in 1975 and sold 1.3 million copies. A second, Cash: The Autobiography, appeared in 1997. His friendship with Billy Graham led to the production of a film about the life of Jesus, The Gospel Road, which Cash co-wrote and narrated. He continued to appear on television, hosting an annual Christmas special on CBS throughout the 1970s. Later television appearances included a starring role in an episode of Columbo, entitled \"Swan Song\". He and June appeared in an episode of Little House on the Prairie, entitled \"The Collection\". He gave a performance as John Brown in the 1985 American Civil War television mini-series North and South. Johnny and June also appeared in Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman in recurring roles.[63]\n\nHe was friendly with every US President starting with Richard Nixon. He was closest to Jimmy Carter, with whom he became close friends and who was a distant cousin of his wife, June Carter Cash. When invited to perform at the White House for the first time in 1970,[67] Richard Nixon's office requested that he play \"Okie from Muskogee\" (a satirical Merle Haggard song about people who despised youthful drug users and war protesters) and \"Welfare Cadillac\" (a Guy Drake song which denies the integrity of welfare recipients). Cash declined to play either and instead selected other songs, including \"The Ballad of Ira Hayes\" (about a brave Native American World War II veteran who was mistreated upon his return to Arizona), and his own compositions, \"What Is Truth\" and \"Man in Black\". Cash wrote that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason.[page needed] However, Cash added, even if Nixon's office had given Cash enough time to learn and rehearse the songs, their choice of pieces that conveyed \"antihippie and antiblack\" sentiments might have backfired.\n\nHighwaymen[]\n\nIn 1980, Cash became the Country Music Hall of Fame's youngest living inductee at age 48, but during the 1980s his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson as The Highwaymen, making three hit albums which were released beginning with the originally titled \"Highwaymen\" in 1985, followed by \"Highwaymen 2\" in 1990, and concluding with \"Highwaymen – The Road Goes on forever\" in 1995. Of the group's four members, Cash was the only non-Texan. During that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in The Pride of Jesse Hallam, winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult illiteracy. In 1980, Cash appeared on the Muppet Show, where he sang a rendition of \"Jackson\" with Miss Piggy. In 1983, he portrayed a sheriff in Murder in Coweta County, based on a real-life Georgia murder case, which co-starred Andy Griffith as his nemesis. Cash had tried for years to make the film, for which he won acclaim.[63]\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an unusual incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an ostrich he kept on his farm.[69] At a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent double bypass surgery in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"near death experience\".\n\nCash's recording career and his general relationship with the Nashville establishment were at an all-time low in the 1980s. He realized that his record label of nearly 30 years, Columbia, was growing indifferent to him and was not properly marketing him (he was \"invisible\" during that time, as he said in his autobiography). Cash recorded an intentionally awful song to protest, a self-parody.[citation needed] \"Chicken in Black\" was about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken. Ironically, the song turned out to be a larger commercial success than any of his other recent material. Between 1981 and 1984, he recorded several sessions with famed countrypolitan producer Billy Sherrill which were shelved; they would be released by Columbia's sister label, Legacy Recordings, in 2014 as Out Among the Stars.[70] Nevertheless, he was hoping to kill the relationship with the label before they did, and it was not long after \"Chicken in Black\" that Columbia and Cash parted ways. In 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to create the album Class of '55. Also in 1986, Cash published his only novel, Man in White, a book about Saul and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. In 1988, Cash campaigned for Senator Al Gore, who was seeking the Democratic Party nomination in that year's presidential election. He recorded Johnny Cash Reads The Complete New Testament in 1990.\n\nAmerican Recordings[]\n\nAfter Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with Mercury Records from 1987 to 1991 (see Johnny Cash discography). His career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience not traditionally interested in country music. In 1991, he sang a version of \"Man in Black\" for the Christian punk band One Bad Pig's album I Scream Sunday. In 1993, he sang \"The Wanderer\" on U2's album Zooropa. Although no longer sought after by major labels, he was offered a contract with producer Rick Rubin's American Recordings label, better known for rap and hard rock. Under Rubin's supervision, he recorded American Recordings (1994) in his living room, accompanied only by his Martin Dreadnought guitar – one of many Cash played throughout his career.[71] The album featured covers of contemporary artists selected by Rubin and had much critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 Glastonbury Festival was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and commercial success. He teamed up with Brooks & Dunn to contribute \"Folsom Prison Blues\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization. On the same album, he performed the Bob Dylan favorite \"Forever Young\".\n\nCash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the television series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. He also lent his voice for a cameo role in The Simpsons episode \"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)\", as the \"Space Coyote\" that guides Homer Simpson on a spiritual quest.[63] In 1996, Cash enlisted the accompaniment of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and released Unchained, which won the Best Country Album Grammy in 1998. Believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography Man in Black, he wrote Cash: The Autobiography in 1997.\n\nLast years[]\n\nIn 1997, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease Shy-Drager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy. The diagnosis was later altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs. The albums American III: Solitary Man (2000) and American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002) contained Cash's response to his illness in the form of songs of a slightly more somber tone than the first two American albums. The video that was released for \"Hurt\", a cover of the song by Nine Inch Nails, fits Cash's view of his past and feelings of regret. The video for the song, from American IV, is now generally recognized as \"his epitaph,\"[72][page needed] and received particular critical and popular acclaim.\n\nJune Carter Cash died on May 15, 2003, at the age of 73. June had told Cash to keep working, so he continued to record, completing 60 more songs in the last four months of his life, and even performed a couple of surprise shows at the Carter Family Fold outside Bristol, Virginia. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing \"Ring of Fire\", Cash read a statement about his late wife that he had written shortly before taking the stage:\n\nThe spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has.\n\nDeath[]\n\nJohnny Cash died at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee on September 12, 2003 at the age of 71, he had complications from diabetes at 2:00 AM CT. His ashes were buried next to his wife at Hendersonville Memory Gardens in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Cash was survived by his daughters Carlene Carter, Rosanne Cash, Cindy Cash, and Tara Cash, along with his brother Tommy Cash, his musicians Emmylou Harris, Sheryl Crow, Kris Kristofferson, and Marty Stuart, as well as his son John Carter Cash, and Rodney Crowell. His spirit and music continued to live on. In June 2005, Cash's lakeside home on Caudill Drive in Hendersonville was put up for sale by his estate. In January 2006, the house was sold to Bee Gees vocalist Barry Gibb and wife Linda and titled to their Florida limited liability company for $2.3 million. The listing agent was Cash's younger brother, Tommy. On April 10, 2007, during a major restoration of the property by the new owner, Cash's home was accidentally destroyed in a spontaneous combustion-ignited fire caused by workers using linseed oil products.[73] One of Cash's final collaborations with producer Rick Rubin, American V: A Hundred Highways, was released posthumously on July 4, 2006. The album debuted in the No.1 position on the Billboard Top 200 album chart for the week ending July 22, 2006. On February 23, 2010, three days before what would have been Cash's 78th birthday, the Cash Family, Rick Rubin, and Lost Highway Records released his second posthumous record, titled American VI: Ain't No Grave.\n\nReligious beliefs[]\n\nCash was raised by his parents in the Southern Baptist faith tradition. He was baptized in 1944 in the Tyronza River as a member of the Central Baptist Church of Dyess, Arkansas.[74] A troubled but devout Christian,[page needed] Cash has been characterized as a \"lens through which to view American contradictions and challenges.\"[lower-alpha 4] A biblical scholar,[1][80][81] he penned a Christian novel, Man in White, and in the introduction Cash writes about a reporter who, interested in Cash's religious beliefs, questions whether the book is written from a Baptist, Catholic, or Jewish perspective. Cash denies an answer to the book's view and his own, and replies, \"I'm a Christian. Don't put me in another box.\"[page needed][83] He made a spoken word recording of the entire New King James Version of the New Testament.[84][85] Cash declared he was \"the biggest sinner of them all\", and viewed himself overall as a complicated and contradictory man.[lower-alpha 5] Accordingly, [lower-alpha 6] Cash is said to have \"contained multitudes\", and has been deemed \"the philosopher-prince of American country music\".[91][92] Cash is credited with converting actor and singer John Schneider to Christianity.[93]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nCash's rebellious image and often anti-authoritarian stance have been credited by some with influencing punk rock.[94][95] Cash's daughter Rosanne (by first wife Vivian Liberto) and his son John Carter Cash (by June Carter Cash) are notable musicians in their own right. Cash nurtured and defended artists (such as Bob Dylan)[citation needed] on the fringes of what was acceptable in country music even while serving as the country music establishment's most visible symbol. At an all-star concert which aired in 1999 on TNT, a diverse group of artists paid him tribute, including Dylan, Chris Isaak, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Dom DeLuise and U2. Cash himself appeared at the end and performed for the first time in more than a year. Two tribute albums were released shortly before his death; Kindred Spirits contains works from established artists, while Dressed in Black contains works from many lesser-known artists. In total, he wrote over 1,000 songs and released dozens of albums. A box set titled Unearthed was issued posthumously. It included four CDs of unreleased material recorded with Rubin as well as a Best of Cash on American retrospective CD.[citation needed]\n\nIn recognition of his lifelong support of SOS Children's Villages, his family invited friends and fans to donate to the Johnny Cash Memorial Fund in his memory. He had a personal link with the SOS village in Diessen, at the Ammersee Lake in Southern Germany, near where he was stationed as a G.I, and with the SOS village in Barrett Town, by Montego Bay, near his holiday home in Jamaica.[96][97] In 1999, Cash received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Cash No. 31 on their \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list.[98][99] The main street in Hendersonville, Tennessee, Highway 31E, is known as \"Johnny Cash Parkway\".[citation needed] The Johnny Cash Museum was located in one of Cash's properties in Hendersonville dubbed the House of Cash until 2006 when it was sold based on the will of Cash. The House subsequently burned down during the renovation by the new owner. A new Museum opened in 2013 in downtown Nashville.[citation needed] On November 2–4, 2007, the Johnny Cash Flower Pickin' Festival was held in Starkville, Mississippi, where Cash had been arrested more than 40 years earlier and held overnight at the city jail on May 11, 1965. The incident inspired Cash to write the song \"Starkville City Jail\". The festival, where he was offered a symbolic posthumous pardon, honored Cash's life and music, and was expected to become an annual event.[100] JC Unit One, Johnny Cash's private tour bus from 1980 until 2003, was put on exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2007. The museum offers public tours of the bus on a seasonal basis (it is stored during the winter months and not exhibited during those times).[citation needed] A limited-edition Forever stamp honoring Cash went on sale June 5, 2013. The stamp features a promotional picture of Cash taken around the 1963 release of \"Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash.\"[101]\n\nPortrayals[]\n\nCountry singer Mark Collie portrayed Cash in John Lloyd Miller's award-winning 1999 short film, I Still Miss Someone.[63] In November 2005, Walk the Line, a biographical film about Cash's life, was released in the United States to considerable commercial success and critical acclaim. The film featured Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny (for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor) and Reese Witherspoon as June (for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress). Phoenix and Witherspoon also won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, respectively. They both performed their own vocals in the film, and Phoenix learned to play guitar for the role. Phoenix received a Grammy Award for his contributions to the soundtrack. John Carter Cash, the son of Johnny and June, served as an executive producer.[63] On March 12, 2006, Ring of Fire, a jukebox musical of the Cash oeuvre, debuted on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, but closed due to harsh reviews and disappointing sales on April 30. Million Dollar Quartet, a musical portraying the early Sun recording sessions involving Cash, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins, debuted on Broadway on April 11, 2010. Actor Lance Guest portrayed Cash. The musical was nominated for three awards at the 2010 Tony Awards, and won one.\n\nRobert Hilburn, veteran Los Angeles Times pop music critic, the journalist who accompanied Cash in his 1968 Folsom prison tour and interviewed Cash many times throughout his life including months before his death, published a 688 page biography with 16 pages of photographs in 2013.[102] The meticulously reported biography is said to have filled in the 80 percent of Cash's life that was unknown, including details about Cash's battles with addiction and infidelity.[103] The book reportedly does not hold back any details about the darker side of Johnny Cash and includes details about his affair with his pregnant wife June Carter's sister.[104]\n\nAwards and honors[]\n\nFor detailed lists of music awards, see List of awards received by Johnny Cash.\n\nCash received multiple Country Music Association Awards, , and other awards, in categories ranging from vocal and spoken performances to album notes and videos. In a career that spanned almost five decades during which he rose to recording industry icon status, Cash was the personification of country music to many people around the world. Cash was a musician who was not tied to a single genre. He recorded songs that could be considered rock and roll, blues, rockabilly, folk, and gospel, and exerted an influence on each of those genres. Moreover, he had the unique distinction among country artists of having \"crossed over\" late in his career to become popular with an unexpected audience, young indie and alternative rock fans.[citation needed] His diversity was evidenced by his presence in three major music halls of fame: the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1977), the Country Music Hall of Fame (1980), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1992). Only thirteen performers are in both of the last two, and only Hank Williams Sr., Jimmie Rodgers, Bob Wills, and Bill Monroe share the honor with Cash of being in all three. Cash was the only inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the regular manner, unlike the other country members, who were inducted as \"early influences\".[105][106][107]\n\nHis contributions to the genre have been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.[108] Cash received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1996, and stated that his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1980 was his greatest professional achievement. In 2001, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.[109] \"Hurt\" was nominated for six VMAs at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. The only VMA the video won was that for Best Cinematography. With the video, Johnny Cash became the oldest artist ever nominated for an MTV Video Music Award.[110] Justin Timberlake, who won Best Video that year for Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song), said in his acceptance speech: \"This is a travesty! I demand a recount. My grandfather raised me on Johnny Cash, and I think he deserves this more than any of us in here tonight.\"[111]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nSee Johnny Cash albums discography, Johnny Cash singles discography and Johnny Cash Sun Records discography.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1961 Five Minutes to Live Johnny Cabot Also titled Door-To-Door Maniac 1971 A Gunfight Abe Cross 1974 The Gospel Road Narrator e 1994 Gene Autry, Melody of the West Narrator Documentary film; voice acting role 2003 The Hunted Narrator Voice acting role\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1959 Shotgun Slade Sheriff Episode: \"The Stalkers\" 1959 Wagon Train Frank Hoag Episode: \"The C.L.
