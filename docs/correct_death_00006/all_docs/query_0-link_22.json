His greatest success came with Monument Records between 1960 and 1964, when 22 of his songs placed on the Billboard Top 40, including \"Only the Lonely\", \"Crying\", and \"Oh, Pretty Woman\". His career stagnated through the 1970s, but was revived by several covers of his songs and the use of \"In Dreams\" in David Lynch's film Blue Velvet (1986).[1]\n\nIn 1988, he joined the Traveling Wilburys supergroup with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne and also released a new solo album. He died of a heart attack in December that year, at the zenith of his resurgence. His life was marred by tragedy, including the death of his first wife and his two eldest sons in separate accidents. [1]\n\nOrbison's vocal instrument bridged the gap between baritone and tenor, and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range. The combination of Orbison's powerful, impassioned voice and complex musical arrangements led many critics to refer to his music as operatic, giving him the sobriquet \"the Caruso of Rock.\" [1]\n\n\"What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound unspeakably sad at the same time. All his vocal gymnastics were just a means to a powerful end, not a mission unto themselves. Roy Orbison didn't just sing beautifully—he sang brokenheartedly.\" [1]\n\n—Stephen Thompson, NPR\n\nPersonal life\n\nRoy, son of Orbie Orbison and Nadine Shultz, was born on 23 April 1936 in Vernon, Texas.[2][3][4][5]\n\nIn the 1940 census Roy (age 3) was the son of Aubie L Orbison in Justice Precinct 1, Wilbarger, Texas, United States.[6][7]\n\nIn the 1950 census Roy (age 13) was the son of Lesley D Bishop in Winkler, Texas, United States.[8][9]\n\nRoy attended Wink High School, in Wink, Texas.[10]\n\nIn 1957, Roy married Claudette Frady.[11]\n\nRoy Dewayne (1958-1968)[12][13]\n\nAnthony King (1962-1968)[14]\n\nRoy (age 32) married Barbara Anne Marie Wellhöner Jakobs on 25 March 1969 in Sumner, Tennessee.[15]\n\nRoy died (age 52) on 6 December 1988, in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[5][16][17][18]\n\nHonors\n\nGrammys\n\nBest Country Performance Duo Or Group (1980) with Emmylou Harris\n\nBest Spoken Word Or Non-Musical Recording (1986) with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson and Chips Moman\n\nBest Country Vocal Collaboration (1988) with k.d. lang\n\nBest Rock Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocal (1989) as part of The Traveling Wilburys\n\nBest Pop Vocal Performance, Male (1990)\n\nOther Awards\n\nLifetime Achievement Award (1998)\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987)[36]\n\nNashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1987)[112]\n\nSongwriters Hall of Fame (1989)[128]\n\nStar on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (2010)[129]\n\nAmerica's Pop Music Hall of Fame 2014\n\nVocal Group Hall of Fame as a member of The Traveling WIlburys\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Wikipedia contributors, \"Roy Orbison,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Orbison&oldid=1226702683 (accessed June 2, 2024).a\n\n↑ Birth: \"Texas Birth Index, 1903-1997\"\n\nciting Texas Department of State Health Services\n\nFamilySearch Record: VDGX-GKL (accessed 2 June 2024)\n\nRoy Kelton Orbison born on 23 Apr 1936, son of Orbie L Orbison & Nadine Shults, in Wilbarger, Texas.\n\n↑ Birth: \"Texas, U.S., Birth Index, 1903-1997\"\n\nOriginal data: Texas Birth Index, 1903-1997.
