        "text": "In 1970, they had their only child together, John Carter Cash, two years after their remarkable engagement and marriage.\n\nJohnny had reportedly asked June to marry him 30 times before she eventually said yes, this time on stage in front of a crowd of thousands in Ontario.\n\nThe duo became an instant power couple within the country music scene, until 2003 when in early May, June died from complications during heart surgery.\n\nJohnny continued to work after June’s death, in the cabin recording studio he had built.\n\nJohnny died just four months later on September 12, and his son recalled his mother’s death being the most difficult thing his father had endured.\n\nJohnny enlisted in the United States Air Force and worked in West Germany as a morse code operator.\n\nThroughout his three-years of service Johnny maintained a long-distance relationship with Vivienne, whom he had met shortly before leaving for Germany, and married her one month after he returned to the United States.\n\nOriginally, Johnny started working as a radio announcer in Tennessee before releasing his first lot of singles in 1955.\n\nA year later, Johnny released I Walk the Line, which became a chart topper and was followed by a string of hits like Folsom prison Blues.\n\nOn the other hand, June had been practically born into country music as her mother, Maybelle Carter, was one of the original members of the Carter Family."
