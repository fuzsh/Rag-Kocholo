His wife was Ann. Ann's surname is not known to me. Jacob and Ann had four children: Elizabeth Stewart (ca 1805- ?) who married John Aid; Rachel Stewart (ca 1807-?) who married Henry Burgess; Sally Stewart (1809-1881) who married George W. Anderson (this is my line and I know it pretty well), and Polly Stewart (ca 1811-?) who married Mr. Yoacham.

Waddill\n\nlwaddill@concentric.net\n\nWe are interested in any info available about William Kurt and his wife Pearl. We believe Pearl's maiden name was White.....maybe. We know Pearl gave birth to a daughter on April 20, 1937 in Kansas City and they lived at 1908 Jefferson St. We believe during the next six (6) years they may have divorced. During that period Pearl became Pearl White (maiden name). We believe Pearl White may have left Missouri during that time. We haven't a clue about what became to William Kurt.

I've tried several avenues without any success and was hoping someone would have some ideas of what to do next. I found the following people on the 1860 census in Fort Osage, Jackson, MO:\n\nGeorge P. Smith, 25, farmer, KY (my gggrandfather)\n\nMary, 25, KY\n\nJohn W., 03, MO.\n\nLaura, 01, MO.\n\nThen I can't find them anywhere until the 1900 census in Fairview, Russell, KS:\n\nJohn Smith, h, w, m, 03, 1855, w, 45, MO, PA, VA (my ggrandfather)\n\nCharles, s, w, m, 10, 1881, s, 18, KS, MO, OH\n\nFrederick, s, w, m, 07, 1886, s, 13, KS, MO, OH\n\nI know that is the right John Smith even though the parents place of birth is wrong. One of the boys must have given it. I can't find anything on them from 1860 until 1900 and I lose George, Mary and Laura. Also, I can't track down where in KY, George and Mary cam from. What was going on in the Fort Osage are in 1860 that would have affected them? Your help is greatly appreciated.\n\n09/25/1997\n\nMarilyn Haslam\n\nMHaslam371@aol.com\n\nI am seeking info on Fannie Esther Bagby Duncan, b. June 1877, probably in Cass county, MO.
