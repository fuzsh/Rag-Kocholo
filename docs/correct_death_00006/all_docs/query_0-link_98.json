There is a preponderance of the evidence. This Abner fits the birth location. We know that the Civil War record with the ini tial of \"T\" is not necessarily accurate. I see many J's transcribed as a \" T\". Also since Jackson named a son Martin, this Abner had a brother named Martin which fits with family naming patterns. Son Martin naming a son Nathaniel confirms the identity with further evidence His military pension records clearly name him as Abner T Nuckols and military records match place of birth and living in Magoffin County KY most of his life.

Correct me if I am wrong. Of course, Keziah, wife of Charles Nuckolls, was a Yancey by birth. Nothing about the traditional claim ever seemed to quite fit including the projected birth date for Charles Nuckolls' daughter Keziah which was a little too late to for her to be Thomas Huckaby 's wife and the mother of his first child. However, the proof that Charles Nuckoll's daughter, Keziah, was not Thomas Huckaby's wife is on Dennis Yancey's site for Richard Yancey probate records which clearly lists the heirs of Charles and Keziah (Yancey) Nuckolls and shows that their daughter, Keziah, was a spinster and still unmarried in 1810 when a major suit involving the estate took place.\n\nI think it very likely that Thomas Huckaby married Kezekiah/Keziah Self, daughter of William Self of Cumberland Co., Va. Thomas Huckaby was living there about the time of the marriage, Kezekiah/Keziah Self was the correct age, and William Self's will proved in 1791 shows that his daughter was married to a Huckaby. I know of no other Huckaby in Cumberland County at the correct time to marry William Self's daughter, nor do I know of any other Huckaby of that general era with a wife named Keziah/Kezeiah. William Self had ties to both Cumberland and Bedford counties, both associated with the Huckabys. Also, William Self sold his Campbell Co land (formerly in Bedford) to Joseph Chaffin, a near kinsman of Thomas Huckabys.\n\nIf you have any evidence contradicting any of my assertions, please let me know. I was once told that a granddaughter of Thomas Huckaby had the name, Keziah Nuckolls Huckaby. If proven, that would be significant, but I have not been able to find the evidence.\n\ngyoung@crosslink.net (Gary Young)\n\n3 Richard WILLIAMS\n\nb: 22 February 1796 Rutherford, NC\n\n. +Keziah Nuckols HUCKABY\n\nFather: John HUCKABY\n\n[John s/o Thos HUCKABY & Keziah SELF]\n\nm: 21 December 1815 in , Barren, KY\n\nSource:dmhull@frazmtn.comGuardian, 1783 John Nuckolls\n\nThis Keziah was not listed as a widow in the 1830 Census of Barren County, so she either died like her husband, or remarried prior to the census\n\n[NI12080] Contacted typhoid while caring for her children who had the disease, and s he died from it.\n\nThe Lexington Herald 1/5/1905\n\nMrs Mattie Nuckols Dead\n\nElkton, KY Jan 4- Mrs Mattie Bell Nuckols, wife of V B Nuckols, died at h er home in this city of typhoid fever.

Franklin Knuckles is a son of Millard Knuckles and Lydia Greene, and has been a great help to me in this endeavor .\n\nRobert Knuckles or Nuckols was 45 years old in the 1860 Census. He was born 1815 -died 1905 (at age 90) and is buried at the Stoney Fork Cemetery near where Stoney Fork empties into the Right Fork of Straight Creek. He gave his place of birth in Virginia. (He was the son of Obadiah Knuckoles or Nuckols (Virginia records spelled his name Obediah Nuchols) and his mother was Elizabeth Willis who were married Feb. 3, 1801 in Goochland, V A.) Robert had one brother William Knuckles or Nuckols. When the brothers came into Kentucky , Robert made his home in the mountains. William went on down in the flat lands of Kentucky .My grandpa told me they never saw each other again. Prior to their arrival in Kentucky the family name was most often spelled NUCKELS or NUCKOLLS; in Kentucky however, KNUCKLES has been used most often. Other spellings of this name, as found in old records in the Virginias, and in the Carolinas were: NUCKOLS, NICHOLS, NICKOLS, KNUCKEL, NICOLS. NICHOLLS.\n\nRobert Knuckles made his home at Knuckles Branch in Stoney Fork of Bell County He went down to Lone Jack, Four Mile, Ky. , and courted and married Margaret Hendrickson (born J anuary 1, 1820 in Knox Cty ., K y .-died March 14, 1890 (lived 70 years) , buried at Stoney Fork, Bell Cty. Ky. She was a daughter of Reuben Hendrickson and Hannah Davis (Reuben's parents were Ezekiel & Jemima (Mima) Hendrickson, who came to Kentucky ca. 1808. I believe Ezekiel's daddy was from Norway, and his mother was German -I do not know her name). Margaret Hendrickson was 39 years old in the 1860 Census and gave her place of birth in Kentucky .Margaret's brothers and sisters were:(a) William (who married fIrst Deborah Bingham; second Margaret S usher.(b) Rachel (who married Michael Howard, son of John Howard).(c) Nancy (who married Jacob Perciful). (d) Sally (who married Samuel Lock( e) on July 26, 1848). (e) Joel (who married fIrst Nancy Bullard; second Eliza Bullard). (t) Noah (who married Diadame Bingham). (g) George (who married Elizabeth Christine Steele). (h) Mary (who married John Amis). (i) John (who married Frances Tinsley). (j) Martha Jane (who married John Epperson). In the summer of 1993 regrading and widening of the Highway at Four Mile forced the relocation of the graves of Margaret's parents, Reuben and Hannah, her brothers George and John and their families. They all were reburied in Pinelawn a beautiful, perpetual care cemetery just east of Pineville, which was developed by Earl J. Knuckles (ninth child of James F. Knuckles & Lily Napier. )\n\nTwo Memories I have of greeat-gran daddy, called Old Man Bobby Knuckles by Colson Knuckles ©\n\nHe was at the voting place at Stoney Fork and a group of men were giving young George Knuckles a hard time because George was working for a man they did not want elected. Old man Bobby Knuckles went to these men and told them, \"You fellows lay off that Colt and try an old horse a while.\" ©\n\nYoung George said they never bothered him again.\n\nAt another time a man by the name of Baker was running against Jack Forester. Old man Bobby was voting for Jack. Some man working and making a speach for Baker said \"A Jack is no good without a Jenny\". Bobby Knuckles said \"Dam a Baker without a kid.\" ©\n\nFiled a CW Pension application for both sons Reuben and George 11/21/1887 as surviving father\n\n[DI12119] Randall Knuckles 4/2016\n\nFound some interesting records today. First, I can find no will or affidavit for Robert. I went all the way back to Will Book 1 and even flipped through those recorded within the timeframe of what we know has to be his death. Nothing even close in K's or N's. So it seems we're still stuck with a three year period from 1893-1896. He bought property in 1893 which suggests he wasn't expecting to die anytime soon. I'd take a guess at 1895 since heirs are usually quick to cash in. That might be as close as we get.\n\nDeed signed by him in 1893 and Jan 1894 was deceased\n\n***************************************\n\nBook 5 page 222 term January 1895\n\nOn motion of WT Davis clerk of the Bell County Court is ordered that GM knuckles be and he is hereby appointed deputy county court clerk of the Bell County Kentucky, whereupon he appeared in open court and took the oath prescribed by law as deputy county court clerk aforesaid.

The last time was in 1999, where we spent hours setting on his porch swing listening to him talking about my ancestors. He was very knowledgeable on my family, many members I have never heard about.. It w as a very interesting conversation... I regret not spending more time wi th him.. He spoke a lot about Robin Knuckles.. He had similar comments as Lillian did. According to Colson, Robin Knuckles was a ladies man .. Colson also told me that Robin Knuckles probably had many wife's and children that was never documented.. Back in them days, many people would claim to be married one day, and not married the next.. Robin Knuckles did get around.. Colson also shared several pictures with me, which I still have.\n\n[DI12121] No death cert found searching all of 1937\n\n[NI12122] Name: «tab»Goodin Lawson\n\nEvent Type: «tab»Draft Registration\n\nEvent Date: «tab»1917-1918\n\nEvent Place: «tab»Clay County, Kentucky, United States\n\nGender: «tab»Male\n\nBirth Date: «tab»1880 dont know\n\nBirthplace: «tab», , United States\n\nNationality: «tab»United States\n\nAffiliate Publication Title: «tab»World War I Selective Service System Draft Registration Cards\n\nAffiliate Publication Number: «tab»M1509\n\nGS Film number: «tab»1653348\n\nDigital Folder Number: «tab»005150683\n\nImage Number: «tab»01968\n\nKin Cordie Lawson\n\nName:«tab»Gooden Lawson\n\nSpouse:«tab»Cordelia France\n\nFather:«tab»Ransom Lawson\n\nMother:«tab»Sarah Lawson\n\nChildren:«tab»Birdie\n\nBirth:«tab»Feb 1884 - Clay, USA\n\nResidence:«tab»1910 - Bell\n\n[DI12123] The Sun Courier, Pineville, KY Oct 3, 1974\n\nEntered into eternal rest Thursday, Sept 26, 1974\n\nMr Robert Knuckles of Beverly, KY, a well-known resident of Bell County,\n\npassed away Thursday, September 26, 1974 at his home following a long illness.

RED BIRD SECTION\n\nThere were three main families on Red Bird when I knew the peop le in this part of the county. They were Bill Knuckles, Rev. Wilkerson Ash er, and Benjamin D. Bingham. These families and their ancestors and descen dants will follow in order. Bill Knuckles married a daughter of Re v. Wilkerson Asher, by name of Amanda Jane Asher. They had six children: ( 1) George M. Knuckles, (2) James Knuckles, (3) T. J. Knuckles, (4) J. B. K nuckles, (5) W. L. Knuckles, (6) M. F. Knuckles.\n\nHistory of Bell Co, KY by Henry Fuson Vol II\n\nSome of the more progressive families tried to stem the tide of lawlessne ss and to bring about a better condition.

William Letcher Knu ckles was one of five brothers. The other brothers were Millard Fillmore K nuckles, George Matt Knuckles, John Beverly Knuckles and Thomas Jeffers on Knuckles, all sons of William Richard Knuckles (himself) a son of Willi am Richard Knuckles and Mary Robinson Knuckles, a circuit-riding lawyer/ju dge. Wife of (the middle) William R Knuckles and mother of five sons was A manda Jane Asher Knuckles, daughter of Wilkerson Asher and Lucinda Bingh am Asher, a storekeeper and direct descendant of Dillion Asher, who settl ed near what is now Queendale, KY, near Beverly and Red Bird. The brothe rs donated five acres, more or less, of valley and surrounding mountainsi de land for the construction of the Red Bird settlement School and the Bev erly Evangelical United Brethren Church(now Beverly United Methodist Churc h) Afyer graduating from Red Bird High School in the second graduating cla ss, Bill, as he was known to his family and friends, attended and graduat ed from Union College, after which he taught school for 13 years in Bell C ounty, KY. He then graduated from the Univeristy of Kentucky College of La w, after which, even at a late age, he volunteered for wervice in the Unit ed States Marine Corps, from which he was honorably discharged as a seco nd lieutenant at the cose of WWII. He served in classification of milita ry personnel stateside. Soon after establising a law practice, firs tin pa rtnership with W J Stone and then Lester Parrott and finally establishi ng his own law practice, he married Marjorie Juanita Chambers, daught er of Rev M L and Dona Moore Chambers, a native of Williamsburg, who was s erving the Bell County School System, along with Warren Robbins, as helpi ng teacher (now called Supervisor of Schools) Marjorie had taught four yea rs in Tennessee and completed her teaching career, retiring after 34 yea rs of service in Kentucky. Bill sought the office of Commonwealth's Attorn ey for Bell County, was elected as a write-in candidate for county surveyo r, and was later elected to serve as 44th Judicial District Court Judg e, a position he held until his retirement 21 years later. To this unio n, at Beverly, was born Mary Truitt Knuckles. Mary Truitt married Charl es Hunter Watley, son of Dr Vernon Thompson Watley and Mary Margaret Moor e, natives of Texas and to this union , in Lexington KY was born Rebekah V erna Watley. The Knuckles family is considered a \"founding family\" in Be ll County. Marjorie and Bill were considered by those who knew th em to be honest, fair, decent citizens who tried to make a contributi on to their hometown and county. They both loved people and loved to enter tain friends and family in their home, often serving \"down-home\" country c ooking, including country ham, fried potatoes, fired corn, green beans, gr eens, parsnips, cornbread, iced tea and other traditonal mountain dishe s. Both Marjorie and Bill loved their hometown of Pineville and their ho me county of Bell and were content to live out their lives there. (Submitt ed by Mary Truiit Watley)\n\nKnuckles Wm.

The following are the names of the other children who came with Mary into Kentucky: 1) Thomas Jefferson Gabriel, 2) Sol, 3) William Richard, and 4) Louise. Of course, Sally came, too, being the oldest child. After Mary's death on Little Yellow Creek, Sally kept the family together and made a home for them, until a time when Obadiah Knuckles came out of the Tennessee'96Virginia section into the Middlesboro section of Kentucky, and evidently stopped for awhile in the Yellow Creek Valley near Middlesboro. A short time later, Obadiah and his family migrated from the Yellow Creek area to a place on the Stony Fork of the Right Fork of Straight Creek and settled at the mouth of a hollow or branch flowing into Stony Fork Creek. This hollow is still known and named on the Bell County, Kentucky maps as \"Knuckles Branch.\" This Knuckles Branch is located approximately two miles upstream of Stony Fork, a short distance from the late Carter Helton Place. The Mary Robinson Knuckles' Family of at least five children stayed there at the Obadiah Knuckles' new location, now known as Knuckles Branch. Then, Sally and her brothers and sister pulled up and moved on to what is now the upper part or headwaters of Red Bird Creek, this being a part of Clay County. (Bell County was not authorized by the Kentucky General Assembly until 1867.) Sally did some light farming and gardening, and hired out to some of the households of the earlier settlers in the Red Bird Creek area. Sally still kept the family together, especially was I told that the brothers, Gabe (T. J. G.), Sol, and William R. (Bill) lived with her. I don't know whether Sally kept her sister, Louise, or not. I never heard her referred to as being with the family in the Red Bird area. Anyway, it seems that Louise may have lived with others until grown up, since she married a Kirby and lived on Moore's Creek, South of Pineville, or what is now known as Ferndale Community. Moore's Creek flows into Cannon Creek in the Ferndale Community, and this is the area where the Pineville (Bell) Water System Dam on Cannon Creek impounds a large lake on the headwaters of Cannon Creek, and from which Pineville and wide areas of territory up Cumberland River to Fourmile, to Greasy Creek and Straight Creek gets water. So it is not known, or been given to the writer, very much about Louise Knuckles Kirby's early life, or with whom she made her house before she married Kirby. I know the Kirby Family of boys, Jim, Joe, Henry, and sister, Henrietta Kirby Wilson Taylor, called William Richard Knuckles' eight sons \"cousins.\" Henrietta Kirby first married a Wilson, and after his decease, she married Garrett Taylor, a son of Harrison Taylor. Harrison was the son of Cornelius Taylor, and Cornelius was the brother of Patsy Taylor, who married Bobby DePriest, a Revolutionary war soldier, and this Patsy Taylor DePriest was the Grandmother of Lucinda Bingham Asher, Mary DePriest being the Mother of Lucinda Bingham Asher. Lucinda, daughter of Joshua Bingham and Mary DePriest, was the Mother of \"Mandy\" or Amanda Jane Asher, the wife of William Richard Knuckles, the Mother of my Father, William Letcher Knuckles.\n\n«tab»All of Mary Robinson Knuckles' children bore the name of Knuckles, since she was married to Bill Knuckles, the Father of Sally Knuckles; but it was rumored that \"Old Bill\" Knuckles was not the father of some of the other members of the family that bore the Knuckles' family name. My Father, Letcher, told me, or I heard him and his brothers speak of the probability of others being the fathers of some of the Knuckles' family members. My Father said that Thomas Jefferson Gabriel (known as \"Gabe\") was reputed or said to have been a Carroll; Sol, probably a Collins; and, some said that William Richard \"Bill\" was probably a Helton. Of course, and usually, it happens that a divorced woman who has a large family may be said to have had affairs with many men, but since all these children came out of Tennessee with Mary Robinson and were all born within a short time of each other, it does not stand to reason that Mary could have, or would have, had affairs with so many men, to the extent that such a large family of children would have been born out of wedlock. Anyway, all the children and heirs of Mary grew into adulthood and were good citizens of their respective communities in which they resided.\n\n[NI12128] BEVERLY: Bell Co.

Burns wrote a book called QUESTS (Washington, D.C: Universal, Inc, 2002), page\n\n48, in which he discussed his meeting with Millard:\n\n\"It is obligatory in Bell County and, for that matter, everywhere in Appalachia, when first\n\nmeeting someone, to enquire if you and the stranger might be related, and if so, how? That\n\nhappened my first day at Red Bird when I wandered into the tiny shack that served as General\n\nStore for the remote settlement. Millard Knuckles owned the store, and within a f ew minutes\n\ndetermined that we were 'cousins,' presumably through my grandmother, Nancy Knuckles.'\n\n\"Cousin or not, that first encounter scared me to death. 'Uncle Millard' kept a Chow-Chow\n\ndog, a somewhat exotic breed today; but positively weird to find one so far back in the woods.\n\nI had been in the store no more than ten minutes before his dog imagined I did some fool thing\n\nthat deeply offended his canine sensibilities... and he lunged, biting a sizeable hunk out of my\n\nleg. He would have made it all the way to bone if Uncle Millard hadn't beat him off, all the\n\nwhile laughing like a hyena at such an enjoyable respite from his humdrum routine. I\n\ncontinued to patronize the little General Store, and Uncle Millard continued to call me Cousin.\n\nToday I cross the street if I see a Chow coming down the sidewalk.\"\n\nRay Helton of Stoney Fork, KY, wrote an article in March 2010 for the \"Kentucky Explorer\"\n\nmagazine about his experiences on Millard's property. He said that the boys attending Red\n\nBird School would sneak off the campus and go over to Mr. Knuckles' store/post office or to\n\nhis large barn across the road. He said they would get out of sight of the school and would\n\nhave great times smoking and/or fighting in privacy.

Helen died of TB (tuberculosis) when she was 17 years, 7 months and 7 days old (or so Mother said). Mother and Helen were like sisters. When Helen became ill, Mother never left her side - even at night! They ate out of the same plate and drank out of the same cup/glass! They had been close all their lives. Mother had no sisters, just brothers to play with, so Helen was like a sister she did not have. The night Helen died my grandparents, Letcher and Carrrie, Mother were down at Uncle Millard and Aunt Myrtle's. Uncle Jimmie had bought a fruit basket to Helen from out in town (Pineville). Helen told Uncle Jimmie that she would eat it in the morning! She passed on to Jesus later that evening. Mother remembered vividly, as they were walking home, through the school, dormitory and church grounds and getting ready to cross the footlog, this little white lamb running so fast that its feet and whole body was up off the ground !!!! She ran faster than ever to get home and when she got in the front screen door, which was never locked, she fainted... I suppose from the traumatic death of her closest friend and 1st cousin, Helen! Mother told me that story and I cried every time I heard it! I don't see why Mother didn't contract TB - she and Helen ate and drank together. She told me they took turns chewing the same gum. Back there, back then, at Red Bird, chewing gum was hard to come by! They shared it! Everyone did! I suppose TB is not contagious all the time.\n\nMiddlesboro Daily News (Middlesboro, Kentucky) > 1921 > March > 11\n\nJohn Hay re-elected County Supt\n\n......Pineville...

Warren\n\nOsteopathy, as a school of medicine, began when the first class of studen ts was graduated in 1894 after learning new principles and techniques und er Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917). Still, the founder of Osteopathy, s on of an itinerant Methodist minister and doctor, began his professional l ife as a country doctor with no more or less training than other country d octors of that time.\n\nHe supplemented a medical apprenticeship, served with his father, by sever al terms in a medical school at Kansas City. In 1874 when Still sought t he privilege of explaining his ideas at Baldwin University, Kansas, he w as refused because his thoughts were not in conformity with accepted medic al practice of the day. For the next 18 years he continued to study and wo rk alone.\n\nIn 1892 Dr. William Smith, who had received his degree in medicine from t he University of Edinburg consulted with Still concerning current medic al education and his own resources regarding the etiology and manageme nt of disease. Two months later Dr. Still, with the assistance of Dr. Smit h, opened a small school for the purpose of teaching anatomy. He subsequen tly established the American School of Osteopathy to teach his ideas relat ive to the etiology and management of disease. A comprehensive curricul um was developed, paralleling good medical education of the day. The cour se covered a period of two years which was, the standard of most medical s chools of that time.\n\nFollowing the establishment of this first school at Kirksville, Mo, oste o- pathic colleges were rapidly established in other states.\n\n[NI12144] Mamie Snoddy Anderson, 90, widow of Leonard M.
