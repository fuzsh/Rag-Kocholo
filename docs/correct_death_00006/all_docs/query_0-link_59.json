William Tyner had become somewhat prosperous and divided his farms among the brothers. He gave less land to Wilber Tyner because he figured he'd just \"fritter it away\". Wilber moved his wife out to Nebraska to homestead for one year. This is where Gramp was born.

They were married in the Methodist Church in Hartford City, Indiana. After the service and reception they moved into their home. Nellieï¿½s father gave her a house and furniture as her wedding present. They lived two doors from Nellieï¿½s parents. Her father gave each of his children a house as wedding gifts. Len worked in the Hartford City Post Office. Nellie was a homemaker.\n\n.....Their first child was a son, Leslie Wood, born May 7, 1901. A second son, William Howard, [was] born June 16, 1905. A third child was a girl born September 22, 1908, Margaret Jane. In 1910 they moved to a farm about 6 miles from Hartford City. Len inherited the farm from his father, William Harrison Tyner [Note by cln, granddaughter of Babe and Les: William's middle name was Harris not Harrison]. They farmed in Indiana for a few years and decided to move to North Dakota near a little town of Wheatland. Three other couples went with Len and Nellie to North Dakota; Charley and Nora Brown (Nellieï¿½s older sister), Jake and Lilly Cripe (cousins) and cousins Jim and Annie Hart. They all settled close to each other. Len and Nellie left North Dakota after a couple years and returned to their Indiana farm and farmed there until 1915. They sold the farm and headed west. Tom Fulton and Olive (Nellieï¿½s younger sister) in the meantime had settled in Coeur dï¿½Alene, Idaho. Len tried to find a business in Coeur dï¿½Alene without success and went to Dishman, Washington where Charley and Nora had moved. Len found a grocery and feed store with living quarters above it in Dishman. A few years later they had a house built for them on Argonne Road and lived there the rest of their days. The railroad crossed the highway through Dishman, dividing the town. Lenï¿½s store was on the west side and when they put in a viaduct it isolated Lenï¿½s store. He went to work at the paper mill in Millwood, Washington. The business men in Dishman asked Nellie to start a Post Office in Dishman. Len encouraged her since he had previously worked in a post office. She opened the Post Office in a corner of the only restaurant in town. It was classed as fourth class and salary was based on the number of letters sent through the cancelling machine. Dishman grew and so did the Post Office. Nellie was a Republican and as long as they were in power she was safe. She had worked the office up to a good paying position, however, the Democrats came into power and she lost her job.\n\n,,,,,She took a petition around to the merchants to sign and they told her she had been there long enough. They forgot the lean years she had devoted to the job. If the Republicans had used their heads while in power, they could have placed the Post Office under Civil Service and Nellie would have received a pension. The Democrats put all Post Offices under Civil Service in 1932. Len had quit work at the paper mill and was helping in the Post Office. Howard had moved back to Spokane and bought a grocery store and Len helped in the store until his death in 1945. Nellie passed away in 1957.\n\n.....i.....LESLIE WOOD TYNER, b. 1901 in Hartford City, Blackford, Indiana, USA, died 27 Nov 1995 Mesa, Maricopa, Arizona, USA. Spouse: ALBERTA J.

R. Conner of Jefferson Township Passed Away Suffered Stroke Ten Days Ago, While Sitting at Dinner Table---Funeral Sunday\n\n(Thursday's Daily) Death claimed another well known citizen and Christian woman when Mrs. I. R. Conner of Jefferson township was taken Wednesday evening a few minutes before ten o'clock, after an illness of but about ten days. She had not been feeling in the best of health since last January, but her condition was not regarded as serious until she was stricken with paralysis while sitting at the dinner table a week ago last Monday. The deceased was 59 years, 4 months and 8 days of age at the time of her death. Throughout her life, Mrs. Conner had been active in church affairs and she always took a deep interest in work pertaining to the Ladies Aid Society and could always be depended upon to do her share in support of every worthy movement in her community. She reared a family of five children and it may be said that she served her purpose well in this world. Mary E. Broxon was the daughter of James and Margaret Broxon and was born January 21, 1853, in Cass County, Indiana. Her parents moved to this county when she was three years of age and she practically spent her life in Jefferson township. She was united in marriage January 21, 1874 to I. R. Conner, and this union was blessed with seven children, five of whom survive, namely; Roy Conner of Fort Wayne; Chester, Virgil, and Mrs. Lyman Beard, of Jefferson township and Mrs. Emmet Kaufman of Washington township. Three sisters, Mrs. Joseph Plummer, of Roanoke, Ind.; Mrs. Della Griffith of Decatur, Ill.; Mrs. J**** ****** of Fort Wayne, and five brothers, namely; John T. Broxon of Roanoke; Rueben, of Jefferson township; Walter, of Fort Wayne; William, of Union township and Charles , of Boise, Idaho, are left to mourn her death. The husband I. R. Conner, also survives. Mrs. Conner was a faithful member of the Saturn Christian Church for years and she will be greatly missed in church circles. The funeral will be held Sunday, the cortage leaving the house at 10 a.m. and going from there to the Saturn Christian church, where Rev. A. M. Gillespie, of Fort Wayne, will preach, and the interment will be in the Broxon Cemetery.\n\nChildren of MARY BROXON and ISAAC CONNER are:\n\n.....i......LUELLA B. CONNER, b. November 12, 1874; d.
