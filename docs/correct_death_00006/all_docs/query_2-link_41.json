        "text": "Rosanne and Cindy both went on to follow in their father’s footsteps as singers.\n\nAfter his divorce from Vivian, Johnny married June, who already had two daughters from her first two marriages: Carlene and Rosie, both of whom also followed a musical path.\n\nOn March 3, 1970, June and Johnny had their only child together: John Carter Cash, who was also their only son.\n\nSo who inherited after Johnny died, given June had also died by this time?\n\nJohn has spoken about how difficult his parents’ death was for him, telling The Guardian in 2013: “My mother's death was very painful as it occurred over a period of a week.\n\n\"Watching her die was the hardest thing my dad ever went through.\n\n“Even though they had their struggles, they were built for each other, and by the end of their lives they were more in love than they had ever been.\n\n“But at the same time he has a great sense of strength and endurance."
