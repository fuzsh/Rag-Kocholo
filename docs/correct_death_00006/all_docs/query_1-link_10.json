The country music icons lived there for more than 30 years until their deaths in 2003.\n\nThe property has changed hands since then, including being owned by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees.\n\nThe property ranks high in country music legend. Reportedly Kris Kristofferson once landed a helicopter there to try to pitch a song to Johnny Cash."
