        "text": "The vault on several songs recorded by country music legend Johnny Cash has been opened, and soon those unreleased tracks will be shared with the world more than 20 years after the singer’s death.\n\nThe 11 tracks, which were solely written by Cash, will make up the album “Songwriter” that will be released June 28. The late legend originally recorded the songs, which were written over many years, at LSI Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, in early 1993 while he was between contracts.\n\n“LSI at the time was owned by his son-in-law Mike Daniels and daughter Rosey, and he wanted to help the family financially while also record some songs special to him,” a press release reads. “Not long after the fruitful session, Johnny met producer Rick Rubin, and the recordings were shelved as the two embarked on an important and prolific musical partnership that revitalized the Man in Black’s career that would last the rest of his life.”\n\nThe shelved songs were discovered by John Carter Cash, the son of Johnny and June Carter Cash, some 36 years later. The 11 tracks were remastered by Cash and co-produced by David “Fergie” Ferguson, who has also engineered or produced recordings for artists like John Prine, Tyler Childers, U2 and more.\n\nMore Country Music News\n\nCountry music icon returning to stage after near-death experience last month\n\nLongtime member of legendary country music group dies at 76\n\nKingston girl brought to tears after lemonade stand nets her Zach Bryan tickets\n\nCountry music group’s shows could change after frontman reveals he has cancer\n\nCountry music star brings viral ‘Hawk Tuah’ girl to stage during concert\n\nCarter Cash and Ferguson invited a select group of musicians that played with Cash to the Cash Cabin — a hallowed space in Hendersonville, Tennessee, where the late singer would make music — to breathe new life into the tracks.\n\nWhile the playing of the musicians on the original 1993 recordings was strong, one could tell the age of the songs by their sound quality. Therefore, the band re-recorded the instrumentals on all the tracks to bring them into the modern era and sound as if Cash recorded the album today.\n\n“We just went rudimentary,” Carter Cash said of the approach. “We went straight to the roots, as far as the sound, and tried not to overly enhance it. We built as if dad was in the room. That’s what we tried to do.”\n\nThe forthcoming album has been preceded with the release of “Well Alright,” which came out April 23. The full track list is below:\n\n“Hello Out There”\n\n“Spotlight”\n\n“Drive On”\n\n“I Love You Tonite”\n\n“Have You Ever Been to Little Rock?”\n\n“Well Alright”\n\n“She Sang Sweet Baby James”\n\n“Poor Valley Girl”\n\n“Soldier Boy”\n\n“Sing It Pretty Sue”\n\n“Like A Soldier”"
