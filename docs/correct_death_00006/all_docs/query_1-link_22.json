        "text": "COOKEVILLE, Tenn. — The great-niece of the late singer Johnny Cash has been found stabbed to death and stuffed in a box in a house, authorities in Tennessee said Thursday.\n\nPutnam County Sheriff David Andrews said Courtney Cash‘s body was found Wednesday morning in a home near Cookeville, about 70 miles east of Nashville.\n\nCash’s body was found in a chest just inside the front door, Andrews said. A man identified as William Austin Johnson, Cash’s boyfriend, was being treated for stab wounds at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Andrews said.\n\nSTORY: Oscar Pistorius Murder Trial Kicks Off Amid Intense Media Coverage\n\nAndrews said the pair had gone out with a friend before an altercation took place in the house where Johnson and Cash lived with their young child. The friend, identified as Wayne Gary Masciarella, has been charged with first-degree murder.\n\nJohnson escaped the attack and took the child with him before driving to the hospital, Andrews said. The scene inside the house was “somewhat bloody,” Andrews told reporters at a news conference.\n\n“There was a struggle,” the sheriff said.\n\nThe suspect may have been trying to hide Cash’s body, Andrews said. A motive was not released, but Andrews indicated the stabbings were likely connected to drugs.\n\nPHOTOS: All Shook Up: Elvis Presley’s Granddaughter Riley Keough Is Having a Moment\n\n“This is a senseless, tragic death of a young lady whose life was probably taken as a direct or indirect result of drugs,” Andrews said.\n\nJohnny Cash’s brother, Tommy Cash, released a statement asking for prayers for the family after the loss of his granddaughter.\n\n“We are completely heartbroken,” the statement said.\n\nMasciarella is being held without bond. He has a court date scheduled for April 21. Officials in Putnam County said they do not know if he has a lawyer."
