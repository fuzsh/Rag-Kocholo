It was lost to a fire in 2007 during renovations under the ownership of Barry Gibb, who is a member of the Bee Gees.\n\nThe Cash house on Old Hickory Lake was constructed in 1967 by famed architect Braxton Dixon (1921-2017). Dixon had been working on the house for himself, but Cash’s relentlessness persuaded Dixon to sell the house to Cash in 1968. The house was 13,880 square feet with 7 bedrooms, 5 full bathrooms, and 2 half bathrooms situated on a 4.6 acre lot. Its unique design allowed for it to have 4 round rooms, providing maximum views of Old Hickory Lake.\n\nAlthough the property is fenced off today, visitors often stop to view the remnants of Johnny and June Carter Cash’s property. As of January 2019, the property was listed for sale for $3.9 million. In February 2020, it was reported that the Cash property had sold.\n\nCash’s mother Carrie, fondly referred to as “Mama Cash,” lived across the street along with Johnny’s dad. This house still stands.\n\nPhoto source: ABC Photo Archives via Getty Images \n\n#johnnycash #hendersonvilletn #junecartercash #oldhickorylake #braxtondixon #tennesseehistory #waterfrontestate #countrysinger #maninblack #cashhouse\".",
