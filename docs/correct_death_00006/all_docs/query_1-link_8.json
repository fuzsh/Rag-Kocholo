        "text": "The life and legend of country music icon Johnny Cash have all been memorialized through the media. His continuous battle to fight alcohol and drug addiction, his often unhappy first marriage and his “Ring of Fire” romance with June Carter Cash are part of his persona. His frequent reliance on religion and backsliding were just a part of his troubled existence. The “Man in Black” image of the Folsom and San Quinten prison concerts endeared him with many fallen individuals and the albums were all top chart winners.\n\nPerhaps the greater remembrance of his life is the concert in 1980 in Nassau Coliseum with Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Chris Kristofferson under the title of “The Highwaymen”. This amazing display of the ability of great musicians to enjoy themselves and to equally share the spotlight to entertain their fans can frequently be seen on the Public Broadcasting Station on WTCI in Chattanooga as part of one of their fundraising programs.\n\nJohnny Cash wrote and sang on many award winning albums that are an integral part of country music history. Album No. 66 by Cash entitled “The Baron” was released by Columbia Records in 1981. The title track was a top ten hit and four singles were released with moderate success. All reached within the top 71 records but none were ever ranked higher. The album cover showed Cash in a pool hall in his customary black outfit holding a pool cue.\n\nCash always personalized his life’s experiences, both good and bad. He also wrote on many subjects involving his home State of Tennessee and other surrounding areas. His Chattanooga City Limit Sign is one of those.\n\nAfter the song was written Chattanooga City Commissioner of Public Works Paul Clarkpresented the singer with a replica of the sign which is present at the entry points to the Scenic City. The album was recorded in March, 1981 at the CBS Studio in Nashville with famed country music producer Billy Sherrill and included Janie Fricke and the Jordanaires as backup vocals. The song did not attain the longtime fame of “The Chattanooga Choo Choo” but it did point out a humorous moment in Johnny Cash’s struggle with his addictions, whether it was true or not.\n\nOn January 11, 2011 the song was sung on You Tube with the following lyrics:\n\n“Chattanooga City Limit Sign”\n\nI was thumbin’ a ride one Saturday morning’\n\nOutta Nashville totin’ my sack\n\nI lent my car to a gal that lived in Chattanooga\n\nAnd she hadn’t never brought it back\n\nShe was drinkin’ pretty heavy when I let her have it\n\nI hope she knows it was only a loan\n\nAin’t no tellin’ what I might have told her back at the time\n\nBut that ole car was also my home\n\nAbout five miles out I was getting’ kinda tired\n\nSweatin’ hard and feelin’ kinda weak\n\nI woke up with no cigarettes and nothin’ to drink\n\nAnd I hadn’t had a bite to eat\n\nMy nerves was so quick I couldn’t tell where I was shakin’\n\nThen a set of brakes sang my song\n\nSome fella stuck his head out a ’57 Chevy\n\nAnd hollered hey man come on\n\nI told ‘em I was headin’ down to Chattanooga\n\nThey said hop in we’re going there too\n\nAnd the way they took off in a cloud of smoke\n\nI still ain’t believin’ it was true\n\nThey had their windows down and I was sittin’ in the back\n\nWith my tongue still hung in my throat\n\nHe was hittin’ just about a hundred and ten\n\nAnd he said man what do you think of this boat\n\nWell there was two semi’s a strugglin’ up ahead\n\nOne tryin’ to pass the other\n\nThey had the whole road blocked so he passed ‘em on the right\n\nAnd let me tell you somethin’ brother\n\nI was so nervous that my teeth was clickin’\n\nThere wadn’t no way my head could think\n\nThen the one that was sittin’ on the passanger side\n\nTurned and said hey man you want somethin’ to drink\n\nI just shook my head cause I couldn’t talk\n\nHe said okay and then he said cheers\n\nThem fools was drinkin’ whiskey and wine\n\nAnd then chasin’ it down with beer\n\nWell I started sweatin’ that ol’ sticky sweat\n\nAnd I know I was white as a sheep\n\nThen one turned the radio on wide open\n\nAnd said hey man check that beat\n\nBy the time we reached the top of Monteagle\n\nI thought I heard a rumblin’ sound\n\nAnd then I saw a sign that said fallin’ rock\n\nAnd right there I was floorboard bound\n\nI was rollin’ and squirmin’ on the ol’ floorboard\n\nToo weak to sit or stand\n\nAnd then the driver said we’re doin’ a hundred and twenty\n\nLook here man no hands\n\nI got up enough nerve to raise up and look\n\nAnd by now there couldn’t be no surprise\n\nBut his hair was blowin’ all over my face\n\nAnd dandruff blowed in both eyes\n\nHe never did drive on the right or left\n\nHe just kept on ridin’ that line\n\nI rubbed my eyes and saw the prettiest thing\n\nThe Chattanooga city limit sign\n\nHe slowed down and I said\n\nMister please I’d like to get off right here\n\nHe said aw ride on into town with us\n\nWe’re gonna go down and pick up more beer\n\nI said please once more and he stopped the car\n\nAnd then he handed me my sack\n\nSaid they’d look for me on the road later on\n\nIn case I wanted to catch a ride back\n\nI got out and sat down by the side of the road\n\nFeelin’ sick and lookin’ mighty pale\n\nI don’t remember anything much after that\n\nBut next mornin’ I woke up in jail\n\nI didn’t know anybody in my cell\n\nAnd didn’t wanna ask why was there\n\nBut they all kept grinnin’ and turnin’ their heads\n\nAnd it was more than my head could bear\n\nSo I called the jailer and I asked him to tell me\n\nWhy I was there if he’d be so kind\n\nHe said for stoppin’ the traffic while I was huggin’ and kissin’\n\nThe Chattanooga city limit sign\n\n* * *\n\nJerry Summers"
