        "text": "I've never seen the WB teen drama One Tree Hill, but you'll find Peyton Sawyer's house in Wilmington, North Carolina where the show was filmed. The writer John Jeremiah Sullivan was living in the house with his family during shooting, and he wrote an interesting essay about the experience for GQ called \"Peyton's Place.\"\n\nview full location details...\n\nNihilistic punk rocker GG Allin had been claiming he would kill himself on stage for several years, but that didn't happen at his last show on June 27, 1993 at a club called the Gas Station formerly located here in what used to be a gas station in New York. The power went out or was shut off after just two songs, and GG, who was notorious for performing naked and cutting himself, roamed the streets around the club covered in blood and grime surrounded by his fans. He eventually ended up in the apartment of someone named Johnny Puke who lived nearby on Avenue B, and he died of a heroin overdose early the next morning.\n\nview full location details...\n\nIn the third district of Budapest at Graphisoft Park, a statue of Steve Jobs was unveiled in December of 2011 (just two months after his death).\n\nThe statue, created by Hungarian sculptor Erno Toth, features a 6 1/2 foot bronze version of Jobs wearing jeans, turtleneck, round spectacles, and an outstretched hand that kind of looks like an eagle's talon.\n\nGabor Bojar, the founder of Graphisoft, commissioned the sculpture days after Job's death. Apple had offered support to the architectural software firm, lending Graphisoft cash and computers, since Jobs saw them at a German trade expo in 1984.\n\nView photos of the statue here.\n\nview full location details..."
