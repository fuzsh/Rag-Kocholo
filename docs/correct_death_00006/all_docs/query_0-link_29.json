        "text": "(Richard McGibony)\n\nThere's a stretch of Highway on Interstate 24 between Nashville and Chattanooga\n\nThat's claimed many trucker's life\n\nAnd your life is in your hands when you start down that long steep grade\n\nOn Monteagle Mountain\n\nI just rolled out of Nashville in my big rig headin' south\n\nMy eyes are on fire feels like cotton in my mouth\n\nMy whole body's achin' but I got to make them big wheels roll\n\nI got to be in Florida by tomorrow morning with a full heavy load\n\nI got to get passed Atlanta as soon as I can tonight\n\nI got to try to dodge the scales and stay out of Smoky's sight\n\nBut there's one big thing standin' like a nightmare in my way\n\nI got to top Monteagle Mountain a little bit later today\n\nGoin' down Monteagle Mountain on I-24\n\nIt's hell for a trucker when the decil's at your door\n\nHe'll tempt you and tell you come on let her roll\n\nCause the mountain wants your rig and trucker I want your soul\n\nWhen I started down Monteagle the brakes just wouldn't hold\n\nI knew I was in trouble and bout to lose control\n\nThe runaway ramp was waitin' I saw the warnin' sign\n\nI said Lord help me make it have mercy on this soul of mine\n\nWell I ploughed into that runaway ramp and I could feel that bigh truck groan\n\nMy life flashed right before my eyes and for a minute I thought I was gone\n\nBut when the smoke cleared I thanked God that I was still alive\n\nCause when there's a runaway on Monteagle some truckers don't survive\n\nGoin' down Monteagle Mountain...\n\nYeah many a good man had lost his life on Monteagle Mountain it's a long steep\n\ngrade"
