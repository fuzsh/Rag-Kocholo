        "text": "The Grand Ole Opry will mark the 20th anniversary of the death of Johnny Cash with a special, star-studded tribute concert on September 12. Cash died on September 12, 2003 at the age of 71; he made his Opry debut in July 1956, performing âI Walk the Line,â âGet Rhythm,â and âSo Doggone Lonesome.â\n\nThe Opry Honors Johnny Cash will include performances by artists who have been influenced by the music of Cash, including Rodney Crowell, The War And Treaty, William Beckman, and Opry members the Gatlin Brothers, Chris Janson, and Jamey Johnson. The night will also feature the Opry debut of the Tennessee Four, who are comprised of Cashâs oldest grandson, Thomas Gabriel, on vocals, with three musicians who played with âThe Man In Blackâ: drummer Paul Leim, Kerry Marks (guitar), and Dave Roe (bass).\n\nTickets are on sale now, starting at $45, at (615) 871-OPRY and on opry.com, and on the famous radio flagship of the Grand Ole Opry, WSM Radio and its website.\n\nEditorial credit: Atomazul / Shutterstock.com"
