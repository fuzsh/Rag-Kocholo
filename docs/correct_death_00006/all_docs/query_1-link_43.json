        "text": "Hello, I‚Äôm Johnny Cash.\n\nMost people over the age of 50 have heard that line, followed by the tune Folsom Prison Blues‚Ä¶as that is how Johnny would open his shows. Whether or not a person is a country music fan, they most likely know a song or two by the performer. The Man in Black, so named for his trademark clothing shade, had a career that spanned six decades. He sold over 90 million records during that period.\n\nWhen we met up with our friends Jodee and Bill last year in Nashville, they had just visited the Johnny Cash Museum. Bill Miller, a former resident of the same small town in California where Jodee and Bill grew up, had recently opened the attraction. Bill Miller‚Äôs son had also opened Nudie‚Äôs Honky Tonk. The bar is a tribute to Nudie Cohn‚Ä¶the tailor who specialized in the rhinestone-covered suits that country stars so often wore. We checked out Nudie‚Äôs and the Country Music Hall of Fame with Jodee, but missed seeing the museum. With that in mind, we set out to see the tribute to Cash this year.\n\nLocated just off of Broadway, the Johnny Cash Museum is one of the most popular attractions in Nashville. Not long after it opened, Miller debuted the Patsy Cline Museum on the second floor of the building. Just yesterday‚Ä¶on the 50th anniversary of the release of the song Sing Me Back Home, Rolling Stone Magazine announced that Bill and his wife were opening the Merle Haggard Museum next door. Needless to say, this is fast becoming a popular spot!\n\nWe learned that Cash was given the name J.R. by his parents. When he was in the service, the Air Force told him he had to have a full name, so he chose John. He was a Morse Code Intercept Operator assigned to monitor the Soviets, and was the first person in the west to learn of Joseph Stalin‚Äôs death. Prior to the service, he worked for a whole two weeks in an auto plant in Pontiac, Michigan. Sure glad that job didn‚Äôt pan out!\n\nOnce out of the service, he began his musical career, quickly finding his way to the top of the charts. The museum walks the visitor through his career in chronological order, with many interesting artifacts from his life, including this Gibson guitar, which was made in Kalamazoo, Michigan. All of the good and bad aspects of his life are presented, though the focus is more toward the positive. There are several videos that show the entertainer along the way, which we really enjoyed.\n\nThis orange duster and the Guild guitar featured on the cover of Rolling Stone were gifted to Bill Miller by Cash, as a token of the friendship they had built up over the years. Bill visited Johnny just 6 days before the singer‚Äôs death.\n\nFrom there, we walked up Broadway a couple of blocks to Nudie‚Äôs.\n\nWe enjoyed lunch and a drink at the longest bar in Nashville! When one of the band members came around with the tip jar, he asked if we had any requests.\n\nOur choice of the Johnny Cash tune Ring of Fire was played for the second time that day, another tribute to his continued popularity. üòä We once sang a ‚Äúspectacular‚Äù version of this song, led by our friend Mike, while in a traffic jam after the fireworks in Traverse City‚Ä¶windows rolled down, of course!\n\nIf you make it to Nashville, be sure to check out the Johnny Cash Museum and Nudie‚Äôs Honky Tonk. It‚Äôs a fun way to spend an afternoon!\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nSearch for all things Johnny Cash here on our exploRVistas Amazon link!\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nexplorRVistas is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising annd linking to Amazon .com.
