        "text": "People call me wild. Not really though, I'm not. I guess I've never been normal, not what you call Establishment. I'm country.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nYou've got to know your limitations. I don't know what your limitations are. I found out what mine were when I was twelve. I found out that there weren't too many limitations, if I did it my way.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nI was wearing black clothes almost from the beginning. I feel comfortable in black. I felt like black looked good onstage, that it was attractive, so I started wearing it all the time.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nHow well I have learned that there is no fence to sit on between heaven and hell. There is a deep, wide gulf, a chasm, and in that chasm is no place for any man.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nThe things that have always been important: to be a good man, to try to live my life the way God would have me, to turn it over to Him that His will might be worked in my life, to do my work without looking back, to give it all I've got, and to take pride in my work as an honest performer.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nYou build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nYou've got a song you're singing from your gut, you want that audience to feel it in their gut. And you've got to make them think that you're one of them sitting out there with them too. They've got to be able to relate to what you're doing.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nI knew I wanted to sing when I was a very small boy. When I was probably 4 years old. My mother played a guitar and I would sit with her and she would sing and I learned to sing along with her.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nIt's like a novelist writing far out things. If it makes a point and makes sense, then people like to read that. But if it's off in left field and goes over the edge, you lose it. The same with musical talent, I think.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nMy father was a man of love. He always loved me to death. He worked hard in the fields, but my father never hit me. Never. I don't ever remember a really cross, unkind word from my father.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nI love to go to the studio and stay there 10 or 12 hours a day. I love it. What is it? I don't know. It's life.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nWhen I record somebody else's song, I have to make it my own or it doesn't feel right. I'll say to myself, I wrote this and he doesn't know it!\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nThat was the big thing when I was growing up, singing on the radio. The extent of my dream was to sing on the radio station in Memphis. Even when I got out of the Air Force in 1954, I came right back to Memphis and started knocking on doors at the radio station.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0\n\nI start a lot more songs than I finish, because I realize when I get into them, they're no good. I don't throw them away, I just put them away, store them, get them out of sight.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\n0\n\n0"
