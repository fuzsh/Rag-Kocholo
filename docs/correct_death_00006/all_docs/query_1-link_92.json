        "text": "A whole wall of LP sleeves displays all 96 of his albums of original material (out of a total of 500). Vintage ticket stubs abound, alongside the best of Cash’s trademark Man in Black stage outfits, his many guitars and examples of 78rpm singles and 8-track cartridges. There are posters too, for shows you would love to have seen: how about Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and the founding dynasty of country music, the Carter Family, all for a mere $3 ?\n\nHere are long-forgotten Cash films (Five Minutes to Live, anybody?); interactive opportunities to see his television show with guests like the young Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell; and a lifetime’s worth of other appearances – from Cash performing I Walk the Line on black and white television, to his appearance at the US Bicentennial celebrations; and that final and almost unbearably poignant video for Hurt.\n\nIn true country style, the tough early years are not forgotten: a bag of cotton from his boyhood home of Dyess, Arkansas is on display, along with Cash’s US Air Force uniform. There are also priceless nuggets of information such as the revelation that, although he was a big man, Cash chose to play a small guitar to make himself look even more impressive. And, this being Nashville, there is a performance space too, allowing for live music and guest appearances; Robert Hilburn spoke here recently, about his definitive Cash biography.\n\nHandwritten letters from Cash at the museum\n\nAt the heart of country music, the Johnny Cash Museum offers a shadow-history of the genre, as well as a fascinating memorial to the journey of a great artist – someone who, as his brother Tommy told me proudly, “could sit down to dinner with the President one night, and Snoop Dogg the next”. (johnnycashmuseum.com)\n\nAside from Cash, everyone from Hank Williams to Dylan, and Elvis Presley to the Black Keys, has recorded in Nashville – and all those musicians are celebrated in the recently reopened Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum. This largely undiscovered gem in Music City’s crown has gathered together instruments representing the whole wonderful history of popular music. Among its treasures are the drums used in Green Onions; the piano played on He Stopped Loving Her Today; and the pedal steel guitar that graced Lay Lady Lay. In this building, even the walls have a story to tell – incorporating, as they do, the original walls and baffles from the Memphis studio where Elvis recorded Suspicious Minds. (musicianshalloffame.com)\n\nHank Williams and Bob Dylan also recorded in Nashville\n\nNashville’s Studio B, where Elvis famously recorded more than 200 songs is now included as part of the tour of the recently expanded Country Music Hall of Fame. And the newly opened Omni Hotel has direct access to the new museum, so you can trace the roots of country music and discover how it developed from low dives, dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music into a genuinely pan-global phenomenon without ever leaving the building. (countrymusichalloffame.org)\n\nFor a souvenir of authentic country and western music, be sure to visit the Ernest Tubb Record Shop, and make time to visit Robert’s Western World opposite, at 416 Broadway. Robert’s brands itself as the “home of traditional country music”. And if you are lucky, while you shop you can catch the likes of Ike Johnson & His Roadhouse Ramblers or Rachael Hester & the Tennessee Walkers, featuring house players from the Grand Ole Opry. On the afternoon I was there, they were playing lovingly recreated songs by Patsy Cline, Kitty Wells and Marty Robbins – making it a real wrench to leave that hillbilly heaven. (robertswesternworld.com)\n\nEssentials\n\nPatrick Humphries was a guest of North America Travel Service (0845 122 8899; northamericatravelservice.co.uk). A five-night stay at the Omni Nashville, including return flight from London with American Airlines, costs from £1,541 per person.\n\nFor more information on Nashville (visitmusiccity.com; 01462 440784).\n\nPatrick Humphries’ most recent music biography is Lonnie Donegan and the Birth of British Rock & Roll (The Robson Press).\n\nFor more information on the USA, go to discoveramerica.com\n\nAmerica's great musical pilgrimages\n\nMarking this year’s opening of the Johnny Cash Museum in Nashville, we look at the America’s many destinations for the musically minded"
