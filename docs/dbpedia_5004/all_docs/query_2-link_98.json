        "text": "Bill has been a practicing attorney for nearly 30 years in the state of Michigan where he has specialized in the areas of Workers’ Compensation, Social Security Disability Appeals and ERISA Appeals. He has been very successful in all practice areas representing his clients. Recently, he forced two different disability insurance carriers to reverse their original decision to deny benefits for long-term disability benefits. As a result, the client’s benefits were re-instated, and they enjoy receiving benefits to this day.\n\nOne of Bill’s strengths as an attorney includes his ability to communicate with his clients. He is compassionate and is willing to spend the necessary time discussing with a client the strengths and weaknesses of their case. His communication skills promote a good working relationship with his clients and their understanding of the workers’ compensation law and its effect on their case. He is highly respected by his peers, clients and the judiciary.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: This information is for general informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as legal advice without consulting with licensed attorney.
