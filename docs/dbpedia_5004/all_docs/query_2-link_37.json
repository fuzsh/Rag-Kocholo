He passed away peacefully at home with his family by his side. He will be remembered for his calming, friendly and hilarious personality. He grew up in Squirrel Hill and went to Shady Side Academy. Bill received his Bachelor's Degree from The University of Pittsburgh and his Master's Degree from Ohio University. He loved to tell and write stories and poetry, tend to his Bonsai Trees, and take photographs. He will forever remain in the hearts and thoughts of everyone who was lucky enough to know him.\n\nWilliam K. Gray, Jr.\n\nMay 26, 1945 - August 1, 2023"
