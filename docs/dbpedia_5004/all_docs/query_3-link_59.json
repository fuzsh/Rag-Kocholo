This annual award recognizes outstanding financial executives in the Twin Cities, and it is the first time Reutter has been named an honoree. “We are so proud to celebrate this honor with John,” noted Andres Caballero, president, Uponor North America. “His countless contributions to the growth and financial stability of our business, as well as stepping up to serve as interim president, is indicative of the high-caliber executive he is. On behalf of everyone at Uponor, we whole-heartedly agree with the decision to honor John in this way and feel privileged to work alongside him.” Reutter was recognized for his leadership in defining and executing the company’s strategic financial approach, especially during the challenges of the past couple of years. Since joining Uponor in 2018, he has led all financial decisions for the company’s North American operations and instituted a disciplined investment strategy, reorganized the Finance team, introduced new technology and processes, and collaborated across functions to positively accelerate operating profits from just over $50 million in 2018 to $100 million in 2021, a first in the company’s history.\n\nDo you have a business idea?
