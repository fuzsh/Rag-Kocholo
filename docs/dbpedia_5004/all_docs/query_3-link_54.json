        "text": "Samford University football coach Bill Gray says athletes who play for\n\nhim will have the best of two worlds - the atmosphere of a by-gone era\n\nwhen athletes played for their school and the love of the game; and today’s\n\nwide-open offenses and modern techniques.\n\nGray, interim head coach for the last five games last fall, is now\n\nthe head coach. And the future of Samford football appears to be in good\n\nhands.\n\nThe coach spoke at the Kiwanis Club in our town Wednesday, courtesy\n\nof Ronnie Watkins. The scene he painted of his school and its football\n\nteam is a lot like college football used to be.\n\n\"Small college athletics still belong to the kids,\" Gray said. \"It’s\n\nthe purest form of athletics we have today. I hope they are in college\n\nfor the right reason - to get an education. They play ball more out of\n\na sense of pride for their school and because they want to play.\"\n\nThe kids don’t play before 80,-or-100,000 fans each week. But that’s\n\nnot important.\n\nMoney and pressure to win is not what sports programs should be about\n\non every campus. Gray played football for a small college, Mississippi\n\nCollege; then was on the coaching staff there when it won a NCAA Division\n\nII national championship.\n\nHe played in the old Gulf South Conference, when Jacksonville State,\n\nTroy State, Livingston and Florence were also in that conference.\n\n\"That was a tough, competitive football conference - a sort of little\n\nSEC,\" said Gray, explaining it broke up when some of the schools felt like\n\nthey should be playing at a higher level, but really should not have moved\n\nup.\n\nIn 2003 Samford and Jacksonville State will become members of the Ohio\n\nValley Conference. It will be the first time Samford has been in a football\n\nconference and able to compete for a championship.\n\nGray hopes nothing changes on campus, that no one gets too big-headed.\n\nAt Samford, the football coach can walk around campus same as a professor.\n\nAfter a game he may be seen walking around in the stadium picking up things\n\nor visiting with students and their families on campus.\n\nGray said the reason he does what he does is because at Samford he\n\nis able to keep his priorities in order - faith, family and football.\n\n\"Right now my record as a head coach is 4-1,\" he said. \"I don’t know\n\nwhat my record will be when I’m through coaching. But I don’t want to be\n\nremembered for my wins, but for what I taught the players about how to\n\nlive.\"\n\nHe has five children, ages 6 to 16, so he knows something about family.\n\nHe wants his team to be like a family; and his family like a team; with\n\neveryone working together for a common cause.\n\nHis life was changed forever when he was named interim head coach on\n\nOct. 16 last fall. The Bulldogs were 1-4 and struggling.\n\nHe turned things around, going 4-1 in the next five games.\n\nHowever, he refuses to take credit.\n\n\"Once a turtle wanted to go South for the winter, but it was too far\n\nto walk. So he asked some Canadian geese to each grab a piece of rope as\n\nthey flew South. He bit down on the other end and was soon up in the sky,\n\nhanging onto the rope for dear life.\n\n\"As the formation flew over, the country people began to notice the\n\ngeese carrying the turtle South. They said, ’Look at that. Whose brilliant\n\nidea was that?’\n\n\"And the turtle, hearing their praise, opened his mouth and said, ’It\n\nwas I.’ You know what happened when he opened his mouth.\"\n\nGray isn’t like that.\n\nHe said there is a lot of good on the Samford campus and if athletes\n\nhappen to sign with the Bulldogs who don’t fit in, they don’t stay very\n\nlong.\n\nAll the players who don’t leave early, for whatever reason, graduate.\n\nAnd few leave, since the graduation rate is around 90 percent, much higher\n\nthan the national average.\n\n\"Education has to be important to the athletes who come to Samford,\"\n\nhe said. \"I think this is the best of the two worlds.\"\n\nJimmy Smothers can be reached at JimmyS1@peoplepc.com."
