        "text": "Calabresella's deli offers taste of Italy, beyond\n\nThe deli offers nearly 50 different subs.\n\nIt has exclusive shipping rights to Zweigle%27s hots.\n\nBurt Reynolds and Celine Dion%27s husband are clients.\n\nIt may have one of the longest business names in Rochester, but Calabresella's New York Style Deli in Gates is also long on services.\n\nWant a sub ready for pickup? You'll have nearly 50 to choose from (hot and cold). They're all made on bread from local bakery Gaetano's, and the specialties include the steak sub, the Dominator (slowly roasted grilled turkey breast, lettuce, tomato, cheese and wing sauce) and the Colon Kicker (thinly sliced steak with lean grilled cappicola).\n\n\"I've never had a bad sub here, I can say that,\" says Bill Harmon, a Gates resident who has been coming to the deli almost since its inception in 1975. \"I love everything about the place. The people are great. The food is great. You come here, they say your name.\"\n\nCalabresella's, 1386 Buffalo Road, is hardly just a sub shop. It offers everything from bottled olives, pasta, pickled pigs feet and chopped clams to hot sauce, cannolis and coffee imported from Italy. Not to mention the popular \"Five Roses\" flour.\n\n\"People swear by it,\" says owner Dominic Mammoliti, who seems to know every other customer by name.\n\nMammoliti's father, William, came to Rochester from Italy in the late 1960s. He originally found work as a tailor at Bonds in the old Bulls Head Plaza on West Main Street but discovered his real passion was sharing authentic Italian delicacies with Americans. In 1975, he opened Calabresella's, named in honor of the region in southern Italy where he was raised — Calabria.\n\nHis goal was to offer only the finest foods and delicacies from Calabria and throughout Italy. People from all over the area flocked there for prosciutto ham, rare cheeses and olive oils — which generally weren't offered in grocery stores at the time.\n\nDominic, 51, had visions of playing pro football after graduating from Spencerport High. The two-way tackle even had a tryout with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League.\n\n\"I certainly wasn't thinking of running a deli,\" he says. \"Maybe becoming a cop, like many of my friends.\"\n\nBut Dominic took over the business in 1992 after his dad suffered a stroke. Before long, he was running it full time.\n\n\"Now I feel blessed,\" he says. \"I love coming to work every day.\"\n\nMammoliti lives in Greece with his wife, Debbie, who runs Studio Expo Salon and Day Spa down the road at 2860 Buffalo Road. They have three children: Dominic, 21, and twins Alex and William, 19.\n\nAlex is part of Mammoliti's staff of 10. So is brother-in-law Carlos Dias, who oversees food preparation. Even Dominic's 78-year-old mother, Beatrice, works there two days a week. Calabresella's makes its food from scratch and offers a rotating menu of soups, including pasta fagioli, prime rib soup and Portuguese soup.\n\nCalabresella's is broken into three main areas: The shopping/deli part; the \"Internet room,\" where online orders are taken; and a sit-down area complete with round tables and a flat-screen TV. That part was Dominic's brainchild.\n\n\"It used to be a pasta room with bocce balls,\" he says. \"But around 15 years ago, I realized people don't want to always grab a sub and eat at their desk. They might want to sit down with friends.\"\n\nCalabresella's may be a Gates landmark celebrating its 40th anniversary, but it also ships a large selection of Rochester products to all 50 states and Canada. No. 1 by far is Zweigle's hot dogs, which account for about 75 percent of the online sales.\n\nCalabresella's is the exclusive shipper for Zweigle's.\n\n\"Zweigle's keeps the phone ringing,\" Mammoliti says. \"We have a guy in Hawaii who loves our delivery service so much he sent us some Hawaiian coffee. And it smelled delicious.\"\n\nPast clients include Burt Reynolds and René Angélil, the husband of singer Celine Dion.\n\nThe store's website, nystyledeli.com, allows out-of-towners and former Rochesterians to order local goods and have them shipped. Mammoliti says the store's database began in 1999 and includes about 25,000 names.\n\n\"At Christmas, we did 1,000 orders in 15 business days,\" he says proudly.\n\nAmong the specialties for shipping: Country Sweet sauce, Margherita pepperoni, Abbott's ice cream, Sal's Birdland Sassy Sauce, Sweet Fire pickles and Bill Gray's and Don's Original hot sauce. Plus, cookies, cannolis, biscotti and just about anything else that can be put in a box.\n\nIce cream?\n\n\"We shipped 500 pints of Abbott's over Christmas and didn't have to re-deliver any of them,\" says Mammoliti, whose staff ships the ice cream in styrofoam containers.\n\nStop in at lunch time, and you'll see a cross-section of Rochester's workforce.\n\n\"You can have an attorney from Rochester sitting there in a nice suit, and at the table next to him is an RG&E worker in big boots,\" Mammoliti says. \"We have Gates police officers, and there's a group from Aquinas that has lunch here every week. We even have a sign: Reserved, Aquinas.\"\n\nHe considers Wegmans a competitor but is happy to have the company around. The supermarket giant is based in Gates, and many workers lunch at Calabresella's.\n\nMammoliti used to be mad at the store he now runs. He believed the stress it caused his father led to the stroke.\n\nThat anger has long vanished. William still visits the place he founded, and Dominic is proud to carry on the legacy.\n\n\"It has been a blessing,\" he says.\n\nJMAND@DemocratandChronicle.com\n\nTwitter.com/jmand1\n\nCalabresella's\n\nLocation: 1386 Buffalo Road in Gates.\n\nPhone: (585) 235-7860.\n\nHours: 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays through Fridays; 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays.
