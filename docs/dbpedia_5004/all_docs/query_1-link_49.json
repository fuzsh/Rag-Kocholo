        "text": "Bruce Bosley\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 1982\n\nWest Virginia's second-ever consensus All-American in 1955, Bruce Bosley was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. A native of Fresno, Calif., who grew up in Green Bank, W.Va., Bosley played on the 1954 Sugar Bowl team for the Mountaineers. That squad finished as the 10th-ranked team in the nation. He went on to a long and prosperous NFL career with the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons for 13 seasons. A four-time Pro Bowl pick in 1960, 1965, 1966 and 1967, Bosley is a member of the San Francisco 49ers all-time team. The 6-2, 240-lb., center retired in 1969. He died April 25, 1995, in San Francisco, Calif.\n\nBobby Bowden\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 2006\n\nBobby Bowden, the No. 2 all-time win leader among college football coaches had an impressive 44-year coaching career which included two national championships.

His first stint at Florida State came in 1963 when he coached the wide receivers. He came to Morgantown in 1966 as offensive coordinator under Jim Carlen, before becoming the head coach in 1970. He left Morgantown in 1976 to become the head coach at Florida State and compiled a 316-97-4 record for an overall career mark of 389-129-4. He is the only coach in Division I-A football history to have enjoyed 14-straight 10-win seasons. His FSU teams finished an unprecedented 14-straight seasons in the Top 5 of the Associated Press College Football Poll, won the College Football National Championship in 1993 and 1999 and is 21-8-1 in bowl games.\n\nFrank Cignetti Sr.\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 2013\n\nFrank Cignetti served as the offensive coordinator at West Virginia University under College Football Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden from 1970-75, before taking over as the Mountaineers’ head coach for four seasons (1976-79). The winningest head coach in IUP history, Cignetti led the Hawks to unprecedented success during his 20-year tenure from 1986 to 2005. He led the Hawks to conference titles in his first two seasons in 1986 and 1987 and subsequent Division II national title game appearances in 1990 and 1993. Cignetti took IUP to 13 Division II playoffs appearances, including six trips to the national semifinals, and he led the Hawks to at least a co-share of the PSAC Western Division title 14 times. Under his tutelage, IUP ranked in the Top 20 each season from 1986-2004, achieving undefeated regular seasons in 1991 and 1993. He retired after the 2005 season with an overall record of 199-77-1, finishing as the third-winningest active coach in Division II. His teams received the Lambert Cup 10 times as the top Division II team in the East. He was named the PSAC West Coach of the Year five times and the Kodak College Division Regional Coach of the Year three times en route to earning Chevrolet Division II National Coach of the Year honors in 1991. He coached 11 First Team All-Americans and 124 First Team All-PSAC performers.\n\nMajor Harris\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 2009\n\nA three-year starter at quarterback, the dynamic Major Harris became the first player in NCAA history to rush for more than 2,000 yards and pass for more than 5,000 yards in his career. As a freshman, Harris led the Mountaineers to the 1987 Sun Bowl. The following season, the quarterback led West Virginia to an undefeated season and a match-up with Notre Dame for the national championship in the 1988 Fiesta Bowl. He accounted for 20 touchdowns that season, while earning ECAC Player of the Year honors and finishing fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting. During his junior campaign, Harris threw for 17 touchdowns and ran for six, while setting school records for most total offense and quarterback rushing yards. He was a voted a first-team All-America, named the ECAC Player of the Year and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. Drafted by the Los Angeles Raiders in the 1990 NFL Draft, Harris spent several seasons playing in the Canadian Football League, Arena Football League and other semi-pro leagues. In 1999, he was inducted into the WVU Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nSam Huff\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 1980\n\nPro Football Hall of Fame - 1982\n\nA name synonymous with West Virginia football, Robert Lee \"Sam\" Huff ranks among the all-time great NFL linebackers. At West Virginia, Huff was a 6-1, 230-lb. tackle before being drafted in the third round by the New York Giants in 1956. Shortly thereafter, the Farmington, W.Va., native became one of the greatest and most publicized linebackers in pro football history and the first defensive football player to make the cover of Time magazine. CBS produced a half-hour pro football documentary entitled \"The Violent World of Sam Huff.\" A fierce competitor and a great rival of Green Bay Packers linebacker Ray Nitsche, Huff earned Pro Bowl status five times, first as a Giant, and then as a Washington Redskin, where he finished his career in 1969. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982.\n\nEarle \"Greasy\" Neale\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 1967\n\nPro Football Hall of Fame - 1969\n\nA noted player and coach, \"Greasy\" Neale's affiliation with West Virginia lasted three years as head football coach from 1931-34. Prior to his stay in Morgantown, Greasy (a nickname he had carried since childhood), was a three-sport standout at West Virginia Wesleyan before embarking on an eight-year major league baseball career with the Cincinnati Reds. While a baseball player, Neale also found time to play professional football in the fall. Upon his retirement as an athlete, Neale became a college coaching gypsy, guiding some of the nation's finest football programs before taking the NFL Philadelphia Eagles coaching job in 1941. Introducing the \"naked reverse\", man-to-man shifting defenses, the stutter series and a primitive form of the 4-3 defense during his pro football coaching tenure, Neale guided the Eagles to the 1949 NFL title. The Parkersburg native was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969. He died November 2, 1973, in Lake Worth, Fla.\n\nDon Nehlen\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 2005\n\nThe winningest coach in WVU history with a 149-93-4 record, Don Nehlen served as Mountaineer head man from 1980-2000. During his 21 years as head coach in Morgantown, Nehlen guided the Mountaineers to 13 bowl games and two bids for national titles playing Notre Dame in the 1989 Fiesta Bowl and Florida in the 1994 Sugar Bowl. He coached 15 first team All Americans, 82 all conference players and 51 players that went on to play professional football. His resume included coaching stints in the Blue Gray, East West Shrine and Hula Bowl all star games, and he served as president of the 10,000 member American Football Coaches Association in 1997. Nehlen, a two time national coach of the year in 1988 and 1993, is a member of the Mid American Conference, Bowling Green, Gator Bowl, Chick-Fil-A Bowl and WVU Sports Halls of Fame. He also served as head coach of his alma mater, Bowling Green, from 1968-76, posting a 53-35-4 mark. The native of Canton, Ohio, was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nIra Errett \"Rat\" Rodgers\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 1953\n\nWest Virginia's preeminent all-around athlete, Ira Errett \"Rat\" Rodgers gained fame as a hard-charging fullback from 1917-19. Called one of \"the finest football players in the land\" by syndicated columnist Grantland Rice, Rodgers is unanimously considered West Virginia's finest pre-World War II football player. A consensus All-American in 1919, Rodgers gained national notoriety after a 25-0 whipping of Princeton, against which he passed for 162 yards and two touchdowns. For the season Rodgers accounted for 147 points. Later an amateur state golf champion, the Bethany, W.Va., native remained at West Virginia as football (1920-25, 1943-45), baseball (1921-42) and golf coach (1949). Rodgers was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1953. He died February 22, 1963, in Morgantown.\n\nBen Schwartzwalder\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 1982\n\nA two-sport letterman at West Virginia in football and wrestling from 1930-32, he achieved great success as a head coach on the prep and collegiate level. He coached high school football for six seasons in West Virginia and Ohio, winning two state championships at Parkersburg (W.Va.), prior to enlisting in the U.S. Army during World War II. Following his discharge, he was the head coach at Muhlenberg (N.J.) College from 1946-48, compiling a 25-5 record. He left there to become head coach at Syracuse, serving as head man there from 1949-73. His teams were an impressive 153-91-3, went to seven bowls, winning the national championship in 1959, and captured four Lambert Trophies (1952, 1956, 1959 and 1966). He was National Coach of the Year in 1959 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. He died in 1993 at age 83.\n\nClarence \"Doc\" Spears\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 1955\n\nA coach at West Virginia from 1921-24, Clarence \"Doc\" Spears was responsible for developing West Virginia's great football fortunes of the early 1920s. During his coaching tenure in Morgantown, the school played in its first bowl game (East-West) in 1922, produced its first unbeaten team (also 1922), defeated Pitt, 9-6 that 1922 season (considered among the greatest wins in school history) and helped build a football stadium. A cordial and delightful man off the field, Spears was the opposite on it, evoking confrontations with sportswriters, alumni and fans alike. After his brief tenure in Morgantown where he also doubled as a practicing medical doctor, thus earning the nickname \"Doc,\" Spears also coached at Minnesota and Oregon among others, until retiring in 1935 to devote his full time to medicine, practicing in Ypsilanti, Mich. Spears was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1955. He died February 1, 1964, in Jupiter, Fla.\n\nJoe Stydahar\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 1956\n\nPro Football Hall of Fame - 1967\n\nA brilliant, but under-recognized two-sport athlete at West Virginia until his graduation in 1936, \"Jumbo Joe\" Stydahar lost that distinction after surprisingly being the first player taken by the Chicago Bears in the 1936 NFL draft -- the first player ever selected by the organization. Born in Kaylor, Pa., and later a standout at Shinnston High (W.Va.), Stydahar was a giant of a man (6-4, 245-lbs.) who became a perennial NFL all-star at tackle. A sixty-minute performer with the \"Monsters of the Midway,\" Stydahar played without a helmet, one of the last performers to do so. He participated on three NFL championship teams with the Bears and was named to the official all-NFL team from 1937-40. He sandwiched a two-year stint in the Navy (1943-44) in the middle of his pro career, which finished in 1946. Following his playing career, Stydahar coached the 1951 Los Angeles Rams to the NFL championship, the organization's first and only title. Stydahar was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967. He died March 23, 1977, in Beckley, W.Va.\n\nDarryl Talley\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 2011\n\nA 1982 consensus All-American, Darryl Talley was one of the most dominant defenders in West Virginia University and Buffalo Bills history. A four-year starter at linebacker for the Mountaineers from 1979-82, Talley amassed 484 career tackles – the most by any WVU player when his playing career ended. His five tackles for loss in 1980 versus Penn State still stand as a WVU single-game record. For his career, Talley had 282 unassisted tackles , 202 assisted tackles, 28 tackles for loss and 19 quarterback sacks from 1979-82. The native of East Cleveland, Ohio, went on to stardom in Buffalo as a starter for 12 outstanding seasons at linebacker from 1983-94, never missing a game while playing for the Bills. Talley is the Bills’ all-time leading tackler with 1,137 career takedowns. He also recorded 38.5 sacks and 11 interceptions as a Bill. Talley spent the 1995 campaign with the Atlanta Falcons and played one more year with the Minnesota Vikings in 1996 before retiring.\n\nFielding Yost\n\nCollege Football Hall of Fame - 1951\n\nAlways in a hurry, thus the nickname \"Hurry Up,\" Fielding Harris Yost gained national acclaim as a college football coach at Michigan at the turn of the century. Yost's travels included a stop at West Virginia, where he earned a law degree and played football in 1895-96. After his two years at WVU, the Fairview, W.Va., native took the Michigan coaching job at age 30 in 1900. Four years later, he showed his appreciation for his alma mater at West Virginia by beating the Mountaineers 130-0, a score that didn't endear him to the West Virginia faithful. That 1904 Michigan squad was called the \"Point-A-Minute\" team. Later the athletic director at Michigan, he was singularly instrumental in building the nation's largest football stadium at Michigan. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. He died August 20, 1946, in Ann Arbor, Mich."
