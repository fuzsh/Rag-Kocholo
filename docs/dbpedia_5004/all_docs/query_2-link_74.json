        "text": "Enacted Legislation\n\nGray was the primary sponsor of 7 bills that were enacted:\n\nH.J.Res. 682 (101st): Waiving certain enrollment requirements with respect to any reconciliation bill, appropriation bill, or continuing resolution for the remainder of the One Hundred First Congress.\n\nH.R. 2889 (100th): A bill for the relief of Frances Silver.\n\nH.R. 3545 (100th): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987\n\nH.R. 5300 (99th): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986\n\nH.R. 4868 (99th): Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986\n\nH.J.Res. 676 (99th): A joint resolution ratifying and affirming the report of January 15, 1986, of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Director of the …\n\nH.J.Res. 260 (98th): A joint resolution to designate the week of October 16, 1983 through October 22, 1983, as “Lupus Awareness Week”.\n\nView All »\n\nDoes 7 not sound like a lot? Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law. But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\n\nWe consider a bill enacted if one of the following is true: a) it is enacted itself, b) it has a companion bill in the other chamber (as identified by Congress) which was enacted, or c) if at least about half of its provisions were incorporated into bills that were enacted (as determined by an automated text analysis, applicable beginning with bills in the 110th Congress).\n\nVoting Record\n\nMissed Votes\n\nFrom Jan 1979 to Aug 1991, Gray missed 763 of 5,979 roll call votes, which is 12.8%. This is much worse than the median of 4.4% among the lifetime records of representatives serving in Aug 1991. The chart below reports missed votes over time.\n\nWe don’t track why legislators miss votes, but it’s often due to medical absenses, major life events, and running for higher office.\n\nShow the numbers...\n\nTime Period Votes Eligible Missed Votes Percent Percentile 1979 Jan-Mar 63 2 3.2% 47th 1979 Apr-Jun 221 20 9.0% 65th 1979 Jul-Sep 198 15 7.6% 63rd 1979 Oct-Dec 190 17 8.9% 47th 1980 Jan-Mar 148 21 14.2% 76th 1980 Apr-Jun 197 32 16.2% 86th 1980 Jul-Sep 192 38 19.8% 91st 1980 Oct-Dec 67 3 4.5% 30th 1981 Jan-Mar 15 1 6.7% 46th 1981 Apr-Jun 90 23 25.6% 95th 1981 Jul-Sep 106 7 6.6% 63rd 1981 Oct-Dec 142 17 12.0% 74th 1982 Feb-Mar 48 3 6.2% 54th 1982 Apr-Jun 119 23 19.3% 94th 1982 Jul-Sep 193 34 17.6% 91st 1982 Oct-Dec 99 15 15.2% 74th 1983 Jan-Mar 43 8 18.6% 86th 1983 Apr-Jun 182 27 14.8% 85th 1983 Jul-Sep 130 3 2.3% 34th 1983 Oct-Nov 143 7 4.9% 46th 1984 Jan-Mar 53 5 9.4% 65th 1984 Apr-Jun 223 18 8.1% 62nd 1984 Jul-Sep 96 2 2.1% 33rd 1984 Oct-Oct 36 13 36.1% 95th 1985 Jan-Mar 36 8 22.2% 93rd 1985 Apr-Jun 154 11 7.1% 70th 1985 Jul-Sep 101 23 22.8% 98th 1985 Oct-Dec 148 18 12.2% 92nd 1986 Jan-Mar 61 7 11.5% 70th 1986 Apr-Jun 128 9 7.0% 75th 1986 Jul-Sep 202 17 8.4% 80th 1986 Oct-Oct 60 10 16.7% 90th 1987 Jan-Mar 39 4 10.3% 79th 1987 Apr-Jun 187 39 20.9% 96th 1987 Jul-Sep 95 6 6.3% 69th 1987 Oct-Dec 167 17 10.2% 77th 1988 Feb-Mar 49 13 26.5% 96th 1988 Apr-Jun 161 27 16.8% 95th 1988 Jul-Sep 152 26 17.1% 92nd 1988 Oct-Oct 89 7 7.9% 73rd 1989 Jan-Mar 14 0 0.0% 0th 1989 Apr-Jun 105 11 10.5% 89th 1989 Jul-Sep 128 5 3.9% 61st 1989 Oct-Nov 121 18 14.9% 94th 1990 Jan-Mar 60 6 10.0% 85th 1990 Apr-Jun 150 9 6.0% 74th 1990 Jul-Sep 183 32 17.5% 97th 1990 Oct-Oct 143 12 8.4% 78th 1991 Jan-Mar 61 2 3.3% 64th 1991 Apr-Jun 139 53 38.1% 99th 1991 Jul-Sep 52 19 36.5% 99th"
