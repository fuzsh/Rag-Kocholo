        "text": "Inverness-born Bill played 9 competitive games in the 1902-03 season, scoring 3 goals. In 1903-04 season he appeared on 9 competitive occasions, with 1 goal and notched up 13 appearances with 5 goals in 1904-05. Twenty eight appearances with 4 goals in the 1905-06 season, saw Thistle finishing 5th in a 16 team league. Bill had a short spell in Southampton in 1907, but returned to Thistle where he played 27 competitive matches and managed 3 goals for the season. His final season was in 1908-09, with him making 31 competitive appearances, scoring 2 goals. Overall the player played on 131 occasions.\n\nBill returned to Inverness, where he worked on the railways, and played for Inverness Thistle. In September 1915 he enlisted in the 4th Battalion Seaforth Highlanders. He became a corporal, but was wounded in the Battle of Ancre. Bill died of his wounds on 18 November 1916, and is buried at Abbeville Cemetery.\n\nWe commemorate his life in our feature piece, The Partick Thistle Fallen →.\n\nBill’s story doesn’t end there. His son William Gray was born on 21 December 1915 in Inverness. William joined Thistle on 23 September 1936, and played for the Jags on 27 occasions. They were one of our early Father and Son pairings."
