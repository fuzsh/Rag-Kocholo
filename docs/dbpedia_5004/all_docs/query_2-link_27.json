        "text": "William (Bill) Gray is a nationally recognized expert on employee benefits law issues who joined Ogletree Deakins in 1991, after having served as a partner in a large general practice firm. He focuses his practice on the design, establishment, and maintenance of qualified retirement plans, health and welfare plans, and nonqualified deferred compensation plans for employers. In recent years Bill has enjoyed working with a large number of credit unions, hospitals, colleges/universities, and other tax-exempt organizations, with a focus on executive compensation. He is also recognized for his skill in representing unionized employers with problems arising from their participation in multiemployer pension plans.\n\nBill served on the Law Review at Emory University School of Law and has authored numerous articles since law school on such topics as employee benefits in takeover battles, the use of employee benefit plans in estate planning, and supplemental retirement plans for executives at tax-exempts. He also speaks frequently to student, professional, and business groups and is highly praised as a good teacher.\n\nFor many years Bill served as an adjunct professor at Georgia State University. He has taught graduate level courses in both the College of Business and the College of Law. He retired from the classroom in 2009."
