        "text": "There's a story out of Giants OTAs that running back Eric Gray (pictured) is getting some first-team opportunities. Last year's fifth-round pick is a guy who caught my attention last spring, not because of anything specific I saw but for his future potential. The Giants weren't likely to retain Saquon Barkley, and in fact they didn't.\n\nBut Gray didn't do much with his very few opportunities last season. He carried 17 times for just 48 yards (2.8 per attempt). He caught 6 of the 7 passes thrown his way, but did little with them (22 yards). The Giants signed Devin Singletary in free agency, and then drafted Purdue's Tyrone Tracy in the fifth round. In a world where people are always trying to be ahead of the curve, I'm seeing Tracy, rather than Gray, being drafted as the favorite to be the No. 2. I've got Gray collecting dust on my dynasty roster, but there isn't great reason to think he'll be worth the investment.\n\nI'd like to say that the fact he only has to beat out Singletary -- now reasonably a journeyman, after the Bills and Texans said goodbye the past two offseasons -- is a strong point in his favor. But it's possible I underestimate Singletary some. He was pretty good the second half of last season.\n\nEarly last year, the Texans were using more of a Dameon Pierce-Singletary tandem. But they scrapped that the second half of the season. In the final nine games, Singletary averaged 93 run-receiving yards. Among all running backs to play at least 6 games the second half of the season, only seven were better than he was in that regard.\n\nRUNNING BACKS, SECOND HALF OF 2023 PlayerGRunNoRecTotTDPPR Christian McCaffrey, S.F.8100.94.434.0134.91.023.9Kyren Williams, LAR6114.73.216.8131.51.424.7James Cook, Buff.877.02.829.3106.30.516.4James Conner, Ari.884.52.416.9101.40.917.8Breece Hall, NYJ955.75.943.699.20.720.0Rachaad White, T.B.968.03.430.098.00.717.2Bijan Robinson, Atl.857.43.836.393.60.616.9Devin Singletary, Hou.976.62.316.893.30.414.3Aaron Jones, G.B.676.72.714.391.00.011.8Brian Robinson, Was.647.73.738.586.20.314.3Joe Mixon, Cin.960.43.124.284.71.017.8Najee Harris, Pitt.972.61.67.780.20.713.6Chuba Hubbard, Car.963.82.215.479.20.412.8Saquon Barkley, NYG857.52.421.378.80.915.8Jahmyr Gibbs (C), Det.960.72.716.877.41.016.4Alvin Kamara, N.O.749.74.627.777.40.515.5Jaylen Warren (C), Pitt.957.93.617.975.80.313.1David Montgomery, Det.970.01.15.775.70.813.6Kenneth Walker, Sea.753.32.021.174.40.412.0Tony Pollard, Dall.959.02.913.472.40.412.8Raheem Mostert, Mia.667.81.04.071.81.316.2Travis Etienne, Jac.947.23.423.370.60.413.2D'Andre Swift, Phil.762.11.36.969.00.39.9Derrick Henry, Ten.962.91.15.468.30.913.3DeVon Achane (C), Mia.748.62.618.667.10.612.7Austin Ekeler, LAC940.33.726.266.60.211.7Jerome Ford, Cle.943.12.720.063.10.612.3Javonte Williams, Den.946.33.316.763.00.512.5Tyjae Spears (C), Ten.926.33.329.055.30.210.2Tyler Allgeier (C), Atl.839.00.914.653.60.37.7Gus Edwards, Balt.841.50.89.150.60.810.3Roschon Johnson (C), Chi.825.42.416.541.90.17.3Zach Charbonnet (C), Sea.726.42.715.341.70.06.9Samaje Perine (C), Den.915.03.124.939.90.17.8Justice Hill (C), Balt.817.01.617.434.40.15.8Kenneth Gainwell (C), Phil.718.12.115.633.70.05.5Miles Sanders (C), Car.922.61.05.728.20.03.8Latavius Murray (C), Buff.721.90.95.727.60.35.3Kareem Hunt (C), Cle.923.91.02.926.80.46.3Jaleel McLaughlin (C), Den.915.82.110.626.30.04.7Dameon Pierce (C), Hou.712.70.62.415.10.33.8\n\nI don't want this to be construed as me being a fan of Singletary. I think he's a pretty ordinary talent, and the fact that Gray is getting some first-team work, and that they spent a draft pick on Tracy (fifth round, granted) is a sign that he doesn't have an iron grip on the starting job. New York desperately needs a running back to step up and take some pressure off Daniel Jones, and maybe it will be one of the youngsters.\n\nBut Singletary being replaced in both Buffalo and Houston the past two years doesn't mean he can't play. Much as we all want a shiny new guy to step up and win the starting job, it won't necessarily happen. Singletary is a capable veteran who the Giants have committed over $6 million to for 2024. Like it or not, a last-round investment or dynasty roster spot on either Gray or Tracy is just a flier, not a particularly strong likelihood of panning out. Seems to be a pretty good chance that Singletary turns out to be a value -- a boring one, but a value nonetheless -- in any league where people are writing him off."
