        "text": "The Saskatchewan Roughriders will turn to a former bulldog to increase the intensity for Saturday’s game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\n\nWilliam Poole III, who played six seasons (2017-22) as a member of the University of Georgia Bulldogs, will get the nod at cornerback as the Riders try to end a four-game slide.\n\nKickoff for the game at Mosaic Stadium starts at 5 p.m.\n\n“He comes from Georgia, and the coach there – Kirby Smart – is a tough, hard-nosed coach and the guys who come from those programs, they step up and will tackle and throw their bodies around,” said Riders head coach Craig Dickenson. “We just feel like he has some good length, and he’s healthy and eager, and we’re excited to see him go.”\n\nIt’s also been a quick turnaround for Poole III, who only arrived in Saskatchewan about three weeks ago.\n\n“I dealt with trying to get into the NFL and talking to teams. Unfortunately, I didn’t get that opportunity at the time. I just stayed focused at home and just working out myself, and I had gotten a job for the first time in my life to put some money in my pocket,” said Poole III, who was working at a Yamaha manufacturing company.\n\n“One day after work, I just got a call, and they gave me the opportunity to come down. I came down literally like two or three days later.\n\n“I’m thankful for the opportunity and looking forward to everything Saskatchewan has to offer to me.”\n\nIn 33 games, the Atlanta, Ga. product recorded 27 tackles, including 1.5 for a loss, and four pass knockdowns in college. He was a member of the 2021 Georgia defense that only allowed 9.5 points per team en route to winning the College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\n“It was one of the biggest moments in Georgia history because hadn’t won one in over 50 years or so. Being a part of that was amazing, and being able to play in that moment was a dream of mine as a Georgia kid,” Poole III said. “That was big for me. Georgia is a winning culture, and Saskatchewan has a winning culture as well.”\n\nHe joins the Riders’ defense that strives to help the team end a four-game slide.\n\nThe first quarterback the 24-year-old will battle against is CFL veteran Bo Levi Mitchell. Mitchell, who has been out since suffering a leg fracture on July 28 against the Ottawa Redblacks, returned to practise this week.\n\n“He’s been around for a while, and I learned he is a hall of fame calibre-type player,” Poole III said. “He makes the right reads and explosive throws. That’s one thing I am looking forward to – testing myself against him being in my first game in the CFL. I’m just looking forward to the challenge.”\n\nPoole III hopes to catch the veteran pivot off-guard by being a new face in the lineup.\n\n“I know I’m new out there, and I know I will be targeted, so I’m just looking forward to competing,” he said."
