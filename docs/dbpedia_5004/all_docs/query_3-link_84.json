        "text": "May 20, 2021: As this summer approaches, it is evident that our country is getting closer and closer to normal life. To say the least, the past year has been incredibly trying, but everyone stepped up, and did what was needed in order to get through these unprecedented times.\n\nThe team at BIll Gray’s Regional Iceplex is no exception. With the sports industry seeing major COVID-19 restrictions, and a significant number of ‘unknowns’ for the future, many members of the BGRI team stepped up to take on different roles within our business--one being Tyler Fess.\n\nWhile overseeing the Never Ever League, and the Iceplex Adult Hockey League, Tyler has filled a crucial role in assisting with the scheduling tasks at the Iceplex. That played a critical role for the facility throughout the 2020-2021 season, and offered Tyler the opportunity to expand on his career in the sports industry.\n\nThat being said, we are pleased to announce that Tyler has accepted a permanent position as Facility Scheduler, which will require him to pass on the reins as League Director of the IAHL. He will continue to oversee the Never Ever League, which has taught ice hockey to over 2,000 adults since he stepped into the role as Director of that program.\n\nWe thank Tyler for his passion in teaching so many this amazing game, and for his dedication as administrator to the IAHL over the past five years.\n\nThat being said, we are pleased to announce the hiring of Greg Miller, who recently joined the BGRI team as League Director. Greg will oversee all aspects of the IAHL moving forward, and has been working closely with Tyler over the past month to learn the ins and outs of the league.\n\nGreg’s background in ice hockey (both as a player and as an administrator) and his degree in Sports Management, give him the ideal set of skills to step into his new role.\n\nYou’ll be seeing and hearing alot from Greg over the coming weeks and months, but should you have any questions, or need to contact him for any reason, he can be reached via email at gmiller@billgraysiceplex.com.\n\nPlease join us in welcoming Greg to the IAHL (and to Rochester N.Y.), and wishing him well in his new ‘gig’ in the world of ice hockey.\n\nChris Woodworth\n\nExecutive Director\n\nBill Gray's Regional Iceplex\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAbout Greg"
