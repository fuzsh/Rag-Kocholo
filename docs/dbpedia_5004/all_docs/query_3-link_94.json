        "text": "Rochester, New York – LiveBarn Inc. is proud to announce that it has launched Live & OnDemand broadcasts from Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex in Rochester, NY.\n\nLiveBarn provides Live and On Demand online broadcasts of amateur and youth sports events using a proprietary multi-camera tracking system which automatically follows the flow of the game – similar to traditional TV. LiveBarn members pay $12.95 a month to view unlimited games and practices from all LiveBarn venues. Friends and family can watch Live when they cannot attend, and athletes have the benefit of reviewing their games and sharing video highlights via email and social media.\n\nLiveBarn will feature service on all four of the ice rinks located at Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex. In addition, four sixty inch televisions will be installed alongside a fireplace seating area in the mezzanine lobby at the Iceplex with live video of the action taking place on all four ice rinks.\n\n“We are pleased to be working with LiveBarn on this innovative product,” said Chris Woodworth, General Manager of Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex. “We are always looking for new ways to enhance our facility and the customer’s experience. There is no doubt that our partnership with LiveBarn will achieve that goal and allow us an opportunity to provide world class service to our valued customers.”\n\nLiveBarn COO Ray Giroux added, “We are very excited to be partnering with Bill Gray’s Regional Iceplex. We look forward to providing our service to the thousands of families, players and coaches that have the pleasure of playing at Bill Gray’s throughout the hockey season”\n\nCustomers of the Iceplex that use promotional code a7c7-29ab will get a free 14 day trial of the service, along with a 10% discount on LiveBarn membership.\n\nFor more information, visit www.livebarn.com"
