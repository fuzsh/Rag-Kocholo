        "text": "February 2017\n\nHockey is one of the perks of growing up in Upstate New York. Whether you’re playing or watching, hockey can be found everywhere – especially across the border to the North. To give the greatest number of kids early access to the sport, Bill Gray’s Iceplex hosts several positive, fun-focused ‘Try Hockey for Free” days each year.\n\nThe next one is coming up on February 25th, and it’s co-ed, so both boys and girls are welcome to attend. The only limitation is that it’s for ages 5 to 9 only. Everything is included – skates, ice time, and equipment — so the younger members of your family can genuinely try hockey for free.\n\nMultiple local hockey organizations will be on hand to help out, and your kids will be taught by some of the top players and coaches in the Rochester region. Pre-registration is required for all participants, so be sure to sign up in advance!\n\nTry Hockey for Free Day (Co-Ed)\n\nFebruary 25th from 11 am to noon\n\nFor Kids Ages 5-9"
