        "text": "Bill Gray earned first team All-American status at center in 1946 after helping OSU to a 7-1-1 record. He was part of the freshman squad for OSU in 1942, before having his football career interrupted by WWII. Assigned to a V-12 program while awaiting orders in Southern California, Gray earned All-America honorable mention while playing for USC. After his tour with the Marine Corps, Gray returned to Oregon State to finish his football career. Following his graduation, he was drafted by the NFLâ€™s Washington Redskins, where he played two seasons."
