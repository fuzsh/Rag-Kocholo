        "text": "K\n\nKathryn Gillen posted a condolence\n\nDear Susan and Peter, We were all so saddened to hear of the passing of your Dad.He truly was one of the very best men we had the privilege to call our uncle. Bill was so easy to talk to. Always so sweet and kind. We had a wonderful day together the last time he and your Mum and the Hawkins came to Brampton to visit. Bill had quite the sense of humour and oh that unforgettable laugh. I'll always cherish that memory. I believe it's not goodbye but I'll see you on the other side. They will all be waiting. The whole Gray clan. Please know that you are both in our thoughts and prayers. Love your cousins, Kathy, Corinne and David\n\nN\n\nNancy Smith posted a condolence\n\nSusan, l will miss seeing your dad and his happy smiley face at Albright. l will also miss seeing you, and how amazing you were to your dad. He was a very fortunate man to have such a loving, caring daughter. May God Bless you and your family and give you the comfort knowing he is now in a wonderful place waiting for the day to unite once again. Please stop by whenever you need a hug or a chat Susan. We at Albright are here for you! Nanc\n\nD\n\nDave & Chris Maxwell posted a condolence\n\nDear Sue, Our deepest sympathies to you and your brother and family. Though we only met your dad briefly, we loved hearing the stories of your family growing up and of your visits with him these past years. I know from them how much he meant to you and how much you will miss him. God bless you and your family and give you peace in the knowledge that your dad is now reunited with your mum. xoxox\n\nR\n\nRhonni Harris posted a condolence\n\nSo many of my childhood memories are of living beside you all. In a time where neighbours have become just people you wave to, I am so thankful to have grown up in a time where neighbours became friends and family. I have special memories of each of you that I cherish. I will continue to think back to the days of Bill giving us wheel barrow rides, working on the yard to look picture perfect and always knowing how to fix our bikes. His laugh will always be in my mind as I think back on such happy times. Lots of love during this difficult time. ❤️\n\nS\n\nSherry and Alphonse Destro posted a condolence\n\nDearest Suzy and Peter, we are so very sorry to hear about the passing of your Dad. Bill was such a kind , loving man. He never had a bad thing to say about anyone. We were so fortunate to know him, as well, be in the company and share many special times with both him and your mom. They were a Special Couple that expressed the true meaning of family, love and devotion. I am sure he has that beautiful smile on his face while reuniting with your mom Eunice. God Bless you at this sad time. Love always Sherry and Alphonse xo"
