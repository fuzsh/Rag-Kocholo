        "text": "Back when the Peninsula Athletic League was a 10-team league for football, league games began in the second week of the season. More recently with two eight-team divisions there were three weeks of nonleague play and a seven-game league season. Now with three six-team divisions, half a season goes by before some teams ever play a league game.\n\nBut now this week league play has finally arrived. And in the PAL Bay the game that could determine the division championship will take place Friday at 3 p.m. when Terra Nova plays at Sacred Heart Prep.\n\nBoth teams are defending Central Coast Section champions, Terra Nova in Division III and SHP in Division IV.\n\nSacred Heart Prep comes in at 4-0, Terra Nova at 2-2, but the Tigers are no strangers to rebounding from a lackluster showing in nonleague play. In 2009 they started the season 0-3 before reeling off nine consecutive wins to capture the PAL Bay championship and advance to the CCS Division III title game, where they lost to Seaside. Last year Terra Nova started the season 2-2, went 4-1 to win the PAL Bay title for the second consecutive year, and bounced back from a 34-10 loss to Half Moon Bay in the final regular-season game to go 3-0 in CCS play.\n\nSacred Heart Prep went 11-2 last year with both losses in league play, 43-21 to Terra Nova and 13-9 to Burlingame.\n\nTerra Nova also beat SHP in 2009, 49-42. But the Gators, once primarily a running team under former Canadian Football League halfback Pete Lavorato, have become more balanced. They are averaging 235 yards rushing and 130 yards passing per game this season. Quarterback Jack Larson has completed 62 percent of his passes\n\n“They pose some real dilemmas for our defense,” Terra Nova coach Bill Gray said. “They have such a balanced attack you can’t zero in on one kid. They have a talented defense and they’ve seen us for a couple of years, so we’ll have to throw in some wrinkles. It could be a high-scoring game.”\n\nTerra Nova is averaging 37.5 points, 303 yards passing and 150 yards rushing per game. Quarterback Chris Forbes has thrown 13 touchdown passes and rushed for five more.\n\nIn this week’s other PAL Bay opener, Burlingame hosts Menlo-Atherton on Thursday at 7 p.m. It will be the first home game for Burlingame this season and the first game on the newly-installed turf.\n\n“They’re scheduled to have it done by 3:30 Thursday,” Burlingame coach John Philipopolos said. “We’ll play at 4 (frosh-soph) and 7.”\n\nPAL Ocean: The PAL’s mid-level division has the best winning percentage in all of the CCS in nonleague play at .826, with a combined record of 19-4-1.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun year,” South San Francisco coach Frank Moro said. “I like our chances.”\n\nThe first week of Ocean play features attractive matchups with Menlo School (4-0) at South San Francisco (4-0) and Aragon (4-0) at Sequoia (3-1), both on Friday at 7 p.m.\n\n“Their passing game is like a running game, it’s the West Coast Offense,” Moro said of Menlo. “We have to cover 100 (yards) by 53, and I think we have the speed to do that. But more than anything we’ve got to be more physical. We’ve got to punch these guys in the mouth right away.”\n\nAragon has three consecutive wins over PAL Lake teams, but will have to step up against Sequoia, which had gone 14-1-1 over its previous 16 games before losing last Friday to a 5-0 Valley Christian of Dublin team, 37-14.\n\n“We have to try to control number 36 (Josh Lauese),” Aragon coach Steve Sell said. “In years past people had to contend with players of ours like Manase Tonga and Daren Hooper. Now it’s our turn. I will enjoy watching him play after this week.”\n\nOnline: Go to http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county-sports for complete San Mateo County prep coverage, including full-length stories and complete stats on all football games involving county teams."
