        "text": "American actor (born 1938)\n\nFor the comedian, see Billy Gray (comedian).\n\nWilliam Thomas Gray (born January 13, 1938)[1] is an American actor, competitive motorcycle racer and inventor, known for his role as Bud on the television series Father Knows Best (1954-1960).[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nGray began acting at five years old. He appeared with his mother in the 1949 horror comedy Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff (in separated scenes).[3] He acted in more than 200 movies. He acted with stars such as Humphrey Bogart, Doris Day, Bob Hope, William Holden, Michael Rennie, Judith Anderson, Pat O'Brien and Barbara Stanwyck.[4] He did not attend school and was educated by teachers hired by the film studios, often having class in tents set up on studio lots.[5] He portrayed a young Jim Thorpe in Jim Thorpe – All-American, and starred in the science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still. He also portrayed Tagg \"Bull's Eye\" Oakley, younger brother of Annie Oakley in the pilot episode of Annie Oakley.[6]\n\nFrom 1954 to 1960, Gray starred as son Bud Anderson in the television series Father Knows Best, for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. He was cast as Plato in Rebel Without a Cause, but had to exit the role when a delay in shooting interfered with his commitment to Father Knows Best. He was arrested for marijuana possession in 1962 and served 45 days in jail.[2] However, he did reprise his role of Bud Anderson in two Father Knows Best reunion films in 1977.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1995, Gray was a Class A motorcycle speedway racer and race promoter.[2][7] He then turned to inventing and entrepreneurship, having invented the F-1 guitar pick. He is also a motorcycle collector and businessman.[8]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nGray was born in Los Angeles, to William H. and Beatrice Gray. His father died when he was 16, while he was working on the show.[7]\n\nGray was married to and divorced from Helena Kallianiotes (1967–1969) and Donna Wilkes (1977–1981).[citation needed] As of July 2020 , Gray lives in Topanga, California, in the same house he bought in 1957 while working on Father Knows Best.[9]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1943 Man of Courage Mike Wilson 1946 Suspense Little Boy at Zoo Uncredited 1948 Fighting Father Dunne Chip 1949 Bad Men of Tombstone Willie Stover Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff Boy with Bow and Arrow 1950 Father Is a Bachelor Feb Chalotte Singing Guns Albert In a Lonely Place Boy seeking autograph Uncredited Mister 880 Mickey Uncredited 1951 Jim Thorpe – All-American Young Jim Thorpe On Moonlight Bay Wesley Winfield The Day the Earth Stood Still Bobby Benson 1952 Talk About a Stranger Robert 'Bud' Fontaine Jr. 1953 All I Desire Ted Murdoch By the Light of the Silvery Moon Wesley Winfield The Girl Next Door Joe 1954 The Outlaw Stallion Danny Saunders 1955 The Seven Little Foys Bryan Lincoln Foy 1961 The Explosive Generation Bobby Herman Jr. 1966 The Navy vs. the Night Monsters CPO Fred Twining 1971 Dusty and Sweets McGee City Life Werewolves on Wheels Pill 1979 Love and Bullets Officer Durant 1980 Porklips Now Dullard\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1950 The Gene Autry Show (TV series) Jimmy Foster Season 1 Episode 5: \"The Star Toter\" 1950 The Gene Autry Show (TV series) Eddie Baker Season 1 Episode 17: \"Twisted Trails\" 1953 Adventures of Superman Young Alan Harper Season 2 Episode 5: \"Shot in the Dark\" 1954-1960 Father Knows Best James \"Bud\" Anderson Jr. 200 episodes 1957 The Thin Man Mike Edwards Episode: \"Come Back Darling Asta\" 1960 Stagecoach West 'Frankie Niles' Season 1 Episode 3: \"Dark Return\" Peter Gunn 'Eric Thorwald' Season 2 Episode 34: \"The Semi-Private Eye\" Bachelor Father David Ross Season 4 Episode 15: \"Ginger's Big Romance\" 1961 Alfred Hitchcock Presents Perry Hatch Season 7 Episode 1: “The Hat Box” The Deputy Johnny Blatner Season 2 Episode 24: \"Two-Way Deal\" 1964 The Greatest Show on Earth Nick Season 1 Episode 16: \"Corsicans Don't Cry\" Arrest and Trial Colin Martin Season 1 Episode 26: \"Tigers Are for Jungles\" 1965 Rawhide Lindsay McCullers Season 7 Episode 17: \"Moment in the Sun\" 1966 Combat!
