        "text": "Terra Nova High football coach Bill Gray announced his retirement Monday morning.\n\nGray, 66, was a head football coach in Pacifica for 42 years, 23 at Terra Nova and 19 at Oceana. He also coached Oceana to four consecutive section championships in wrestling from 1983-86.\n\nHe retires with 256 wins in football, third-most in Central Coast Section history behind Benny Pierce of Saratoga with 269 and Butch Cattolico of Los Gatos with 264.\n\n“Those kinds of things are irrelevant,” Gray said. “It boils down to what is right for the program and for me personally. I have medical issues, physical issues that need to be addressed. As a football coach and athletic director, I wasn’t able to take care of those things.”\n\nGray, who declined to get into specifics about his health, said he will remain as athletic director for the remainder of the school year. He said he made his decision to retire over winter break and announced his decision to the team Monday morning.\n\n“Coach Gray retiring, literally the most jaw dropping news I’ve ever heard in my whole life,” Terra Nova quarterback Anthony Gordon said in a tweet. “Football will never be the same without the big dog.”\n\nGray won two CCS championships, a Division II North title in 1987 at Oceana and a Division III title in 2010 at Terra Nova. He had a career record of 98-94-2 from 1972-1990 at Oceana, 158-82-4 from 1991-2013 at Terra Nova.\n\n“To remain successful it takes a tremendous amount of energy,” Gray said. “At my age with my health issues I’m not able to give it the time it needs. Despite the fact that you enjoy it, the anxiety, stress and lack of sleep was taking years off the end of my life. The right thing to do for the program is to have a younger, more energetic coach.”\n\nTerra Nova has won the last five Peninsula Athletic League Bay Division championships. The Tigers went 10-0 in the 2013 regular season before a 26-7 loss to Valley Christian in the first round of the CCS Open Division playoffs.\n\n“I’m very comfortable with where the program is right now,” Gray said. “But when you get up in the morning and feel you can’t do it anymore, it’s time to leave.”"
