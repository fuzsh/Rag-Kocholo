How could you blame them?\" Maciocia says about Montreal's ownership woes before PKP bought the team.\n\nArticle content\n\nWith the clock ticking down on CFL free agency last February, and knowing he was about to lose numerous players concerned over the lack of an owner, Alouettes general manager Danny Maciocia had to call an audible, relying on the trust built with agents over the years while the franchise endured a transition phase.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAlouettes GM Danny Maciocia defied odds by building a Grey Cup team Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThat the Als, nine months later, are preparing to play Winnipeg in the Grey Cup at Tim Hortons Field this Sunday is nothing short of remarkable. A CFL championship? Skeptics doubted Montreal would even make the playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

People felt sorry for us and me. They would say ‘buddy, you’re in tough.’ How could you blame them? Nobody thought we could get to this place. Against all odds, that’s what we were up against.\n\n“I knew we’d be way behind the 8-ball. Going into training camp we had to find a way to put together a respectful, competitive team.”\n\nWith the league operating the franchise, Maciocia didn’t learn until 3.5 hours before the start of free agency on Feb. 12 that funds would be allocated to sign players. He refused to disclose how much money was made available. But with the league’s $5.45-million salary cap, Maciocia knew he couldn’t spend recklessly. After the departures of starting quarterback Trevor Harris (Saskatchewan) and receiver Eugene Lewis (Edmonton) — the team’s two highest-paid players — Maciocia knew he had some wiggle room.\n\n“I had enough (money) to do what I did, but at that point in time, a lot of people had already committed,” Maciocia said. “Some stuck around. Not many. The fact the money was there was good, but we were up against the clock. People knew where a lot of these players were going — and none of them were coming to Montreal until that money became available.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQuarterback Cody Fajardo and his agent, Jason Bernstein, trusted Maciocia and were willing to work with him although, truth be told, his options were limited. Of the nine free agents signed in February, Fajardo’s was the most significant. No team can win without a competent quarterback and, after being benched late in the season by the Roughriders, Fajardo was seeking a second opportunity.\n\nMaciocia lost 10 free agents to other teams, but was able to extend a number of roster players, including linebacker Tyrice Beverette, receiver Kaion Julien-Grant, defensive-back Wesley Sutton and returner Chandler Worthy.\n\nTwo more significant additions arrived during the season on defence — free agents Shawn Lemon and Darnell Sankey in July and September, respectively. Rush-end Lemon was released by B.C. during training camp while middle-linebacker Sankey signed following the XFL season. The two made an already good defence outstanding.\n\nMaciocia, like any competent GM, left some money in the kitty, knowing the roster would require some in-season tinkering. But again, with both players on the street, he probably wasn’t in a bidding war against other teams.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe March 10 purchase of the Als by Montreal businessman Pierre Karl Péladeau brought peace of mind to Maciocia and his staff. Péladeau, who has refused all Gazette interview requests throughout the season, has been a model owner, paying the bills while not interfering. This is in stark contrast to the previous ownership group of Gary Stern and the estate of Sid Spiegel.\n\nMaciocia said he and Péladeau speak, briefly, following games. And Maciocia didn’t require Péladeau’s approval before signing Lemon and Sankey.\n\nWhile Maciocia already has two Grey Cups to his credit with Edmonton — in 2003 as offensive co-ordinator and ’05 as head coach — he said this season has been the most rewarding of his 17-year CFL career. He said he became more patient through the process while understanding the importance of surrounding himself with people who shared the same vision and values.\n\n“I’ll never use the phrase salvage the season,” Maciocia said. “I felt we could field a competitive team, and then all bets are off. Did I know we were headed to the Grey Cup? No, I’m not going to lie.”\n\nhzurkowsky@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/HerbZurkowsky1\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\n'It's our time' to win Grey Cup, Alouettes' William Stanback says\n\nAlouettes' Jason Maas credits experience for making him a better coach\n\nPéladeau brings deep pockets to Alouettes, but endgame is unclear\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
