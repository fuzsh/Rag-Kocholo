        "text": "1985 was an exceptional year for the BC Lions as the team dominated the Canadian Football League. The Lions capped their year with a host of awards, including nine players voted to the Western All-Star Team and six players to the All-Canadian Team.\n\nThe season culminated with the BC Lions’ exciting Grey Cup victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in a riveting finale in Montreal. The final score at Olympic Stadium on Sunday, November 24th was 37-24 and the Lions’ roar led the team to its first league championship in 21 years, and the second coveted Grey Cup win in the club’s history.\n\nIn the final game BC held an edge over Hamilton in both offense and defense. They also had the advantage of quarterback Roy Dewalt’s surgical skill, the dashing feet of receivers Ned Armour and Jim Sandusky and the survivalist savvy of kicker Lui Passaglia.\n\nFor the team, 1985 was a record-breaking year: 13 wins (and three losses), 481 points scored, 49 converts and 25 singles. Darnell Clash, Roy Dewalt, Mervyn Fernandez, Keyvan Jenkins and Lui Passaglia smashed twelve individual player records.\n\nThe Lions also swept the CFL Awards with Don Mathews recognized with the prestigious CFL Coach of the Year, Mervyn Fernandez honoured with the MVPAward and Mike Gray as the Rookie of the Year."
