        "text": "'Honeymoon period is now over'\n\nBrian McLauchlin\n\nBBC Sport Scotland Senior Reporter\n\nAfter a sloppy start on Saturday it looked like the Hibs defence, which has rightly been the subject of stern criticism, was going to finally do its job and remain intact.\n\nThen with just a few minutes left they switch off and allow a potent striker like Simon Murray time and space to snatch a draw for Dundee.\n\nSame old story and itâs becoming way too predictable for the Easter Road fans.\n\nWith two new centre-backs and a new goalkeeper in place, some leeway can be afforded but as we now approach the end of August and the first international break of the campaign, any honeymoon period is now over.\n\nAlready out of the League Cup, David Gray and his players can solely concentrate on the Premiership and have three matches in September to make their mark.\n\nFirst up is a trip this weekend to Kilmarnock, who have a very tricky Conference League match to negotiate on Thursday against Copenhagen.\n\nThen itâs St Johnstone at home before Rangers away at the end of the month. It may be difficult to get some continuity given the two-week gap between matches but they only have themselves to blame due to the League Cup exit and no European football this season.\n\nWinning is not an easy task in the ultra-competitive Premiership, but itâs something the team must get back to doing quickly to avoid another hapless campaign.\n\nOn this day: Sproule hat-trick stuns Ibrox\n\nIt has now been 19 years since Ivan Sproule came off the visiting bench to score an incredible 23-minute hat-trick in a 3-0 Hibs win at Ibrox.\n\nWith the game at 0-0, the Northern Ireland winger used his blistering pace against a tiring Rangers side that had qualified for the Champions League just days before.\n\nAfter coming on in the 63rd minute, Sproule went on to bury three devastating finishes to stun the home crowd and send the pocket of travelling Hibs fans wild.\n\nThe first finish was lobbed over the onrushing Ronald Waterreus before two superb Scott Brown assists set the forward up to slot in a second and third.\n\n'Can Hibs pull a rabbit out the hat as transfer deadline looms?'\n\nMatty Fairnie\n\nFan writer\n\nHibs had the chance to kickstart their season on Saturday and we looked like we might just do that before Simon Murrayâs late equaliser for Dundee dampened the mood at Easter Road.\n\nThere was some criticism directed at David Gray for his late substitution, swapping Mykola Kuharevich for Rocky Bushiri in response to Dundee throwing on Curtis Main as they chased an equaliser.\n\nThe sub handed Dundee the momentum in the final stages and Hibs, typically, failed to hold out long enough to take the points.\n\nIâm reluctant to criticise Gray, though. Had he not made the change and Dundee scored, everyone would be asking why he didnât react. If I do have a complaint, it is that he could have made a more positive substitution and forced Dundee to think twice about flooding forward, maybe try to kill the game at 3-1 rather than hold on to 2-1.\n\nThat said, there were some bright spots for Hibs after a poor start to the game. Martin Boyle got back on the scoresheet and Keiron Bowie opened his account as he battered through the Dundee defence. He continues to look a shrewd signing.\n\nA Hibs win would have been merited, we had Dundee on the back foot for most of the second half until the changes swung the game in their favour, and we should take encouragement given the Dark Blues had been talked up pre-match like prime Barcelona.\n\nWith a few days left of the transfer window, we need to hope Hibs can pull a rabbit or two out of the hat as the squad still looks to be missing the magic ingredient to really get us going despite signing nine players already this window.\n\nMatty Fairnie can be found at Longbangers Podcast, external\n\n'Patience required to halt managerial merry-go-round' - McGeady\n\nAiden McGeady says \"patience needs to be shown\" to David Gray and Hibs to buck the \"merry-go-round\" trend of manager sackings at the club.\n\nGray was minutes away from recording his first league win as permanent manager of the Edinburgh club, but former Hibs striker Simon Murray yanked Dundee level with a late equaliser.\n\n\"Dave would have been desperate to get a result,\" McGeady said on the BBC's Scottish Football Podcast. \"I think Hibs definitely played better and it was a performance I think that was needed.\n\n\"It's something that probably a lot of people need to look into because at the minute, I think they're struggling for a result but I think patience needs to be shown with Dave.\n\n\"Too many times at Hibs over the last few years it's a bit of a merry-go-round.\n\n\"Bad results, get rid of the manager or get rid of the players so I think there has to be a bit of a patience shown with Dave and I think with the recruitment this window, all signs are looking like they're trying to improve, there looks to be a different mentality.\"\n\nYou can listen and subscribe to the Scottish Football podcast here.\n\n'Not good enough' or 'several sparks of quality'\n\nWe asked for your thoughts after Hibs drew 2-2 with Dundee in the Scottish Premiership.\n\nHere's a taste of what you had to say:\n\nColin: Poor goals conceded again! As a team we were poor defensively, and offensively we lacked energy and urgency particularly in the first half. David Gray knows what the problems are and he needs to find solutions both individually and collectively. Time and patience is required to find the stability and continuity that will bring us long-term success.\n\nGeorge: There are signs it's turning (positively). Confidence looks shaky, so any/all errors cause mayhem. Dundee outplayed us at times, but we battled and hung in when we needed to and at times we shredded them and should/could have won this. Several sparks of quality amongst the battling; think we'll make top six if we just keep our heads.\n\nLes: Gray has just cost us first win of season with nonsensical substitution of a defender for our main striker when we had control of the game. The minute Rocky came on panic set in, just not good enough again.\n\nIan: Attack is best form of defence, so why when we had them on the run, did we bring on Rocky? Let's try to win some games by scoring more goals.\n\nDundee draw 'not good enough' - Bowie\n\nKieron Bowie says Hibs have to improve after a late concession saw them drop two points against Dundee.\n\nSecond half substitute Bowie made it 2-1 to David Gray's side with just under 20 minutes left, but Simon Murray beat Josef Bursik in the 88th minute to make it 2-2.\n\n\"Coming on at 1-1 and then scoring my first goal, there's no better feeling than putting the ball in the back of the net,\" Bowie said.\n\n\"But to lose a goal so late in the game, it's not really good enough from us, and we know that.\n\n\"We just need to move on to next week.\"\n\nHibernian 2-2 Dundee: What the manager said\n\nHibernian head coach David Gray: \"It was difficult to watch at times for certain reasons. We start poorly again and lose a really poor goal again.\n\n\"As a result we looked nervy and fragile. But credit for getting back in the game just before half time. It was an important goal at an important time.\n\n\"We came out second half in a much better frame of mind and we were on the front foot and dominating the game.\n\n\"It is a new back four that's playing together. We need to be critical of ourselves to make sure we're doing everything we can. But we also need to understand why the decisions are being made. Because it's poor decisions or positional play.\n\n\"So we need to find the answers to these as quickly as possible. The way to do that is by reflecting, going over the game and sitting down with individuals and collectively to work on it every single day. That's clearly the area we need to improve.\"\n\nHibernian 2-2 Dundee: Analysis\n\nThomas Duncan, BBC Sport Scotland\n\nThis already felt like a significant game for Hibsâ rookie head coach Gray, after a thumping 3-0 defeat by St Mirren was backed up by league and cup losses to Celtic.\n\nThe latter two games were a free hit, but a home game against a perceived smaller club is a game fans expect more.\n\nBut Hibs simply will not achieve what they want if they keep making defensive errors, which has been a theme for at least three seasons.\n\nJordan Obitaâs horrible clearance and then a missed challenge from Nicky Cadden made it easy for Lyall Cameron and Scott Tiffoney to work the opening goal.\n\nThen Warren O'Hora appeared to be unaware of Murray's presence for the Dundee equaliser. There were other moments where they looked shaky, too, and the struggling defensive unit was not helped by a sluggish midfield.\n\nOn the bright side, Martin Boyle grabbed a much-needed goal for his confidence and Bowie, 21, looks like he will make a big contribution when up to full speed.\n\nBut it already feels like Gray's tenure will be defined by sorting out his team's defending and making some late signings in midfield.\n\nHibs deal a 'no-brainer' for Megwa\n\nKanayo Megwa says signing a new deal at Hibs was a \"no-brainer\".\n\nThe defender put pen to paper on a four-year deal that keeps him at Easter Road until 2028.\n\n\"I'm really happy,\" the 20-year-old told HibsTV, external.\n\n\"We've been talking about it for a while so I'm just happy to finally get it over the line.\n\n\"The manager spoke to me and told me how much he trusts me and what I can do for the future so it was a no-brainer for me.\n\n\"Because he's been with me for a while he trusts me and he knows what I can do.\"\n\n'There is no need to panic at all, weâre all calm,' says Moriah-Welsh\n\nNathan Moriah-Welsh believes there is \"no need for alarm bells\" despite Hibernian's winless start to the league season.\n\nDavid Gray's side have lost four of their last five matches in all competitions, including a League Cup group-stage game against League 1 Kelty Hearts.\n\nBut the midfielder stressed it's too early in the season for anyone with a Hibs persuasion to be concerned and instead calls for \"calmness\".\n\n\"Itâs only been two weeks so far into the (league) season so there are no alarms going off,\" said the 22-year-old. \"There is no need to panic at all, weâre all calm.\n\n\"Itâs not just the gaffer, itâs all the lads, weâre like, âkeep calmâ. Itâs two weeks into the season, there is no reason for alarm bells.\"\n\nThe Guyana international also thinks Hibs are improving and if costly errors can be cut out, results too will take a swing in the right direction.\n\n\"Weâre still learning about each other,\" he added. \"Itâs been a good start, not results-wise, but as a collective itâs been good. If we can cut out the mistakes weâll be in a much better place,\n\n\"Itâs going to be important to get points on the board and get the season going, the last three games have been unfortunate but itâs in the past and we need to look forwards.\"\n\nMegwa signs new four-year Hibs deal\n\nHibs defender Kanayo Megwa has signed a new contract with the club, keeping him at Easter Road until the summer of 2028.\n\nMegwa, 20, made his first-team debut in 2023 and has spent time out on loan at Airdrieonians and Kelty Hearts.\n\n\"Iâm really pleased that Kanayo has committed his future to the club,\" head coach David Gray said.\n\n\"He has quietly gone about his business in the last few years and he fully deserves and has earned a new deal.\n\n\"Having worked with him for a few years now, I know he has a great attitude, and a real desire to get better every day. He is a great athlete who enjoys defending and is improving every day.\n\n\"He has shown he is capable of making that step up into the first team and he needs to keep working hard to keep improving and push for that starting spot.\"\n\nManager in the spotlight - David Gray\n\nHibs and Kilmarnock are the only teams yet to get off the mark in the league and the mood at Easter Road remains bleak after three underwhelming seasons and last weekend's League Cup exit.\n\nDavid Gray is Hibs' second appointment since Lee Johnson was sacked after losing his first three league games last term and while the former captain is in no such danger he could really do with a win to lift confidence.\n\nThe good news is Hibs have only lost one of their last 15 top-flight meetings with Dundee (W8 D6). The bad news is Gray was in interim charge for that defeat in May 2022 - and the Dark Blues are currently in fine fettle - unbeaten in seven so far this term, with six wins.\n\n\"I can't keep on picking the same players that make the same mistakes all the time,\" said an exasperated Gray after the League Cup loss at Celtic, so it will be interesting to see what changes are made.\n\nThe Hibs boss was a ferocious competitor as a player and is trying to rid his team of a long-held reputation for being soft touches.\n\nGray will also be keeping a close eye on Dundee skipper Luke McCowan, reportedly the subject of several offers from the Edinburgh club.\n\nRead the rest of this weekend's Premiership picks."
