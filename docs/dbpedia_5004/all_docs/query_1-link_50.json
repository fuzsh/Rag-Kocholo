        "text": "Dominic Solanke is set to undergo a medical at Tottenham Hotspur after a £65million deal was agreed with Bournemouth for the striker.\n\nSolanke is expected to sign a six-year contract with the north London club.\n\nThe forward is desperate to move to Spurs and he was head coach Ange Postecoglou’s top summer transfer target.\n\nThe Athletic reported earlier on Friday Bournemouth had agreed to sell Solanke for a club-record fee, and talks with Spurs were ongoing to finalise a deal for the striker.\n\nHe is under contract with Bournemouth until 2029 but, as The Athletic reported in June, the striker’s contract contains a £65million ($83m) release clause that can be triggered by certain clubs.\n\nSpurs have not signed a senior striker since Harry Kane’s departure for Bayern Munich last summer.\n\nPostecoglou is keen to acquire a No 9 that suits his style of play and Solanke’s profile fits the bill.\n\n“What’s important is the type of striker we get,” Postecoglou said during Tottenham’s pre-season tour of Japan. “You know we play a certain way. We demand certain things from a physical perspective from the technical aspects of it that it’s going be a striker that fits that mould.\n\n“It’s still the area of the park we’re really probably the thinnest when I talk about squad-wise at the moment, so obviously that’s a focus for us.”\n\nTottenham forward Richarlison, meanwhile, ruled out a summer move to the Saudi Pro League when speaking to ESPN Brasil on Thursday. “The money is big but my dream is bigger,” said the Brazilian, who has three years remaining on his Spurs contract.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhy Solanke suits Spurs and Postecoglou's style: Shot heavy, low passing & box focus\n\nSolanke registered his best top-flight return last season, scoring 19 Premier League goals to help Bournemouth secure a 12th-place finish. Bournemouth have been working on potential Solanke replacements this summer, given his release clause and several top sides’ desire to strengthen their forward lines.\n\nSolanke began his career at Chelsea before joining Liverpool in 2017 on a free transfer. He made the switch to Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee in 2019. The Merseyside club hold a 20 per cent sell-on clause from the deal and could receive as much as £9m if Spurs trigger his release clause.\n\nSpurs have made two signings so far this summer with 18-year-old midfielders Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall arriving from Leeds United and Djurgarden respectively. They have also agreed a deal to sign South Korean winger Yang Min-hyuk, who will join the squad in January.\n\nSolanke missed out on selection for England’s European Championship squad, with Brentford’s Ivan Toney and Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins selected as back-ups to Kane.\n\nTottenham begin the 2024-25 Premier League campaign at newly-promoted Leicester City on August 19.\n\n(Eddie Keogh/Getty Images)"
