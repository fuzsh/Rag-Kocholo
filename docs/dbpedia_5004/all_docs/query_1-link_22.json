        "text": "— Jimmy Walker figures he made NCAA history when he signed a scholarship with Arkansas during the summer of 1975.\n\n“I’m probably the only player ever in Division I football to sign with a school he never visited and where he had never met the head coach,” Walker said. “I signed the scholarship letter sight unseen.”\n\nWalker, a linebacker at Little Rock Central, wasn’t heavily recruited and signed an NAIA letter of intent with Arkansas Tech. Then he played in the Arkansas High School All-Star Game as a defensive lineman.\n\n“Jimmy played down, and he played really well,” said Harold Horton, who was among several Arkansas assistants attending the game along with Coach Frank Broyles. “We offered him a scholarship right after the game.”\n\nWalker became the last of 33 signees for the Razorbacks.\n\nIt turned out well for Arkansas and Walker, who Friday night was inducted into the UA Sports Hall of Honor.\n\n“I’m just blessed and humbled and honored by this recognition,” Walker said. “It’s been 33 years since I played my last game here, but I’ll always be a Hog.”\n\nWalker become a All-America defensive tackle and helped the Razorbacks to a 35-9-2 record from 1975-1978, including victories over Georgia in the Cotton Bowl and Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.\n\nListed at 6-0 and 232 pounds, Walker finished his Arkansas career with 37 tackles behind the line of scrimmage for losses totaling 216 yards. He had 221 total tackles.\n\n“Jimmy was a great football player,” said Horton, who coached the defensive line.“Not average, not good, but great.\n\n“He was physical, and he could run. He’d run you down, and he’d knock you down. He was a playmaker.”\n\nWalker said he was driven to excel by being the last signee in his class.\n\n“I was familiar with the other guys Arkansas had recruited, and I felt I belonged, but I had to prove it,” he said. “I came in with a chip on my shoulder.”\n\nWalker recalled being with a group of several freshmen when he reported to campus and ran into Broyles.\n\n“He got on an elevator with us, and he knew everybody else there but me, because we’d never met,” Walker said. “I had to tell him who I was.”\n\nIt didn’t take long for Broyles to notice Walker on the practice field. Walker began practice on the scout-team defense, but he held his own against an offensive line that included future NFL players R.C. Thielemann, Leotis Harris and Greg Koch.\n\n“I was raising a little dust out there,” Walker said. “Then I heard Coach Broyles say, ‘Get him off the field.’ I didn’t understand what that meant until the next day, when I was playing with the varsity.”\n\nWalker was second team as a freshman and sophomore, then the next two seasons started at tackle alongside Dan Hampton, an All-American and Pro Football Hall of Famer.\n\n“We had a good relationship,” Walker said. “Dan would say, ‘They’re not running on this side,’ and I’d say, ‘They’re not running on my side, either.’ We kind of had a challenge with one another.”\n\nWalker played professionally in the Canadian Football League (4 years), the United States Football League (3 years) and the NFL (1 year) with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nAfter retiring from football, Walker was a correctional officer for the Atlanta city jail.\n\n“It was a rough place, but nobody ever gave me any trouble,” Walker said with a smile. “I was respected, you could say.”\n\nWalker moved to South Bend, Ind., in 2004 to stay close to his son, Darius, a running back who played for Notre Dame. Jimmy Walker still lives in South Bend and is a county superintendent for the highway department.\n\n“South Bend reminds me a lot of Fayetteville,” Walker said. “They’re both great college towns.”\n\nHall of Honor members\n\n1988\n\nLance Alworth (FB) John Barnhill (FB) Frank Broyles (FB) Sidney Moncrief (MBB) Glen Rose (FB, MBB) Clyde Scott (FB)\n\n1989\n\nJim Benton (FB) George Cole (FB) Wayne Harris (FB) Wilson Matthews (FB) Kevin McReynolds (Base) Wear Schoonover (FB)\n\n1990\n\nMiller Barber (Golf) Mel McGaha (Base, FB, MBB) John McDonnell (Track) Loyd Phillips (FB) Jack Robbins (FB) Jim Lee Howell (FB)\n\n1991\n\nLeon Campbell (FB) Mike Conley (Track) Norm DeBriyn (Base) Dan Hampton (FB) Dave Hanner (FB) Fred Williams (FB)\n\n1993\n\nRon Brewer (MBB) Chuck Dicus (FB) Joe Ferguson (FB) Lamar McHan (FB) Pat Summerall (FB)\n\n1994\n\nGeorge Kok (MBB) Maurice Britt (FB) Bill Ferrell (Base) Steve Little (FB) Bettye Fiscus (WBB) Billy Ray Smith Sr. (FB) Niall O’Shaughnessy (Track) John Daly (Golf)\n\n1995\n\nBill Burnett (FB) Ken Hatfield (FB) Eddie Sutton (MBB) R.H.
