        "meta_description": "ROCHESTER, N.Y.-&nbsp;From Alaska All-Stars to the north, to Florida Alliance in the south, and all points in between, the best of North American girls hockey descended upon western New York once again.\n\nA total of 126 teams and nearly 3,000 participants fueled this year&#39;s Roc City Girls Fest, which maintained its status as one of the biggest elite tournaments in North America. In partnership with the Roc Sports Commission, Premier Ice Prospects crowned 12 champions split among five age groups over the weekend at Bill Gray&rsquo;s Regional Iceplex.\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really great to have it here in Rochester,&rdquo; PIP Director of Girls Hockey Kathy Pippy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s centrally located between the East Coast, Midwest and Ontario.&rdquo;\n\nAll divisions, from 10U all the way up to 19U, guaranteed participating teams at least four games throughout the tourney. The Anaheim Lady Ducks brought the most teams to Rochester, with eight, while Pittsburgh Penguins Elite iced seven teams, with five of them making at least the semifinal round of their respective brackets.\n\nAs with other recent PIP events, the return to pre-pandemic travel conditions allowed Canadian teams to participate &mdash; 17 in all made the trip to western New York from Ontario.\n\n&ldquo;That certainly contributed to our amazing jump,&rdquo; Pippy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting to have grown this tournament in just two short years since we had to cancel in 2020.\n\n&ldquo;We have exciting plans that will support even more expansion in 2023!&rdquo;\n\nEleven programs in all took home trophies, with only the Glenview (Ill.) Stars taking multiple championships. They won the Tier 2 competitions in the 16U and 19U age groups. (Please see below for the full list of Roc City Girls Fest champions.)\n\nBuffalo Sabres alum Rhett Warrener handed out the hardware to the 19U Glenview team, capping a weekend that featured almost as much action off the ice as it did on the ice.\n\nThe tourney unofficially began Thursday with a Kickoff Party catered by local favorite Jeremiah&rsquo;s Tavern, then 150 players across the six age groups tested their abilities in the Pure Hockey Skills Competition.&nbsp;Skilled professionals from NewEdge Hockey Development Academy conducted each of the skills events, which focused on categories such as skating speed, puck-handling and shooting.&nbsp;\n\nAdditionally, DIRECTV sponsored a sports lounge in the Bill Gray&rsquo;s lobby, providing coffee, donuts and pizza to attendees throughout the tournament. DIRECTV also funded an ongoing Super Deker competition that was open to all.\n\nDick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods greatly contributed to the success of the weekend, as well. Not only did Dick&rsquo;s provide all tourney attendees with a 20-percent discount coupon valid through the weekend, the company&rsquo;s House of Sport initiative teamed with Visit Rochester on a social-media contest that awarded $200 in store credit to the winner.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe Roc City Girls Fest also succeeded in attracting thousands of additional people to the metro area, boosting the local economy -- from hotels and restaurants to businesses outside the traditional hospitality sphere.\n\n&ldquo;The city&rsquo;s pretty much sold out with our teams that are staying in these hotels,&rdquo; Pippy said. &ldquo;And obviously they&rsquo;re spending money eating at the local restaurants, going to the zoo, going to museums, doing all kinds of activities, since it was a beautiful fall weekend.&rdquo;\n\nVisit&nbsp;PremierIceProspects.com&nbsp;for more information on PIP&rsquo;s mission to elevate girls hockey with elite-level competitions and exposure opportunities!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRoc City Girls Fest 2022 winners:\n\n10U Tier 1 - Assabet (Mass.)
