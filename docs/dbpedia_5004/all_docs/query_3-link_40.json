        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE - The University of Arkansas athletic department is losing former Coach and Athletic Director Frank Broyles' \"right-hand man\"later this summer.\n\nSenior associate athletic director Bill Gray, 65, announced Friday that he will leave his job July 31. Gray, a two-sport star at Arkansas and a captain on the Razorbacks' 1964 national championship team, has spent 29 years on campus, the past 24 as anathletics administrator.\n\n\"He loved his work and did such a great job, I never had to talk to him,\" Broyles said with a laugh. \"He was just my righthand man for so many years. You could depend on him to do his job in a meaningful and successful way.\n\n\"Bill Gray will be missed and can't be replaced. He had a great passion for the Razorbacks.\"\n\nGray could not be reached for comment Friday, but he issued a statement through a UA athletic department news release.\n\n\"There comes a time when even the good things in life have to come to an end,\" Gray said. \"That is the reason that I have made the decision to move on now. I know in my heart this is the time for me to end this wonderful experience.\"\n\nGray, a native of West Helena, has played a key role in major athletic department projects over the past three decades.\n\n\"He's put his life into this Razorback program,\" said Harold Horton, vice president of the Razorback Foundation and a former Arkansas football assistant coach. \"When you've been around as long as I have and you see one of your former Razorbacks and a longtime acquaintance retire, it just naturally makes your heart sink some because it's meant a lot to him.\n\n\"He's been an asset to us.\"\n\nGray served as the point man for the most recent renovation and expansion of Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium. He was instrumental in the creation of the UA Sports Hall of Honor, and he served as chairman of the committee that coordinated Arkansas football's centennial celebration.\n\n\"Bill Gray has been an unsunghero of the Razorback program for more than a quarter of a century,\" first-year Arkansas Athletic Director Jeff Long said in the release. \"While his contributions were most often made behind the scenes, his influence helped chart the direction of this program under Coach Broyles' leadership.\n\n\"Bill's commitment and dedication have helped pave the way for thousands of student-athletes to pursue their dreams academically and athletically. He has continued to be an invaluable resource to me in the transition and combining of the men's and women's athletic programs.\"\n\nGray was a three-year letterman in football and baseball and a 1966 graduate in business administration.\n\nGray's 68-yard completion to Jerry Lamb in the 1963 Sugar Bowl is still a school record for longest pass completion in a bowl game. He led the 1963 football Razorbacks in scoring with 30 points on five touchdowns and the 1964 team with three interceptions. Gray's .322batting average led the 1965 Arkansas baseball team.\n\nGray underwent triple-bypass heart surgery - performed by former Razorback basketball player Jimmy Counce - last Aug. 3 and returned to his position after a brief recovery period.\n\nGray's departure signals another move in the rapidly changing athletic department. Long has made a series of new hires in the past few months and is set to reveal further changes in the coming weeks.\n\n\"July 1 is the date we're pointing to that I want to get my first round of changes, significant changes in staff and things,\" Long said last week in an interview with the Democrat-Gazette. \"We're working towards that.\n\n\"I'm excited. We have new team members on board, and I've also enjoyed getting to know our existing team members. The challenge is putting together two programs and getting the best people in the best spot to take our people forward.\""
