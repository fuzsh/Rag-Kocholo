Tate recently had a dual role, playing both cop and con, in BET's original movie Gun Hill and starred in Showtime's House of Lies until 2015. He is currently set to star in the upcoming season of the HBO series Power.  (Photo: Jason Merritt/Getty Images) - Find out what happened to the stars of this classic film.",
