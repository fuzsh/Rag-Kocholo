Hilary looks for her own apartment, and Vivian reveals that she's pregnant!\n\nFor Blood or Money\n\nAs Raylan (Timothy Olyphant) looks to keep the Dixie Mafia from unleashing a gang war in Harlan, Rachelâs (Erica Tazel) ex-con brother-in-law Clinton (guest star Larenz Tate) escapes a halfway house to see his twelve-year-old son. And as Rachel struggles to understand Clintonâs complicated role in her sisterâs death, white supremacist Kyle Rourke (guest star Michael Mosley) enlists Boyd (Walton Goggins) for a payroll robbery.\n\nMindy Lahiri Is a Racist\n\nOne of Danny's patients is a mommy blogger, so he invites her to write about Schulman & Associates on her website, only to find out that she is actually a white supremacist and paints the practice in a racist light. Desperate to control the situation, the team hires PR guru Priscilla (guest star Jenny Elfman), who begins to give Danny media training but ends up seducing him."
