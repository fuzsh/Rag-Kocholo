        "text": "The upcoming Michael Jackson biopic, Michael has announced a couple new cast members, including Larenz Tate as Motown Records founder Berry Gordy; and Kat Graham as the legendary Diana Ross. As the film chronicles Jackson’s rise to prominence, first as a member of the Jackson 5, then as a solo artist, the record label will factor in significantly. Power franchise star Tate (who coincidentally played Thriller producer Quincy Jones in 2004’s Ray) takes on the role of Gordy, who redefined American music by platforming such acts as the Jackson 5, Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight and the Pips and Diana Ross & the Supremes.\n\nGraham (Love in the Villa, Tyler Perry’s upcoming Black, White & Blue) portrays Ross, who, as lead singer of the chart-topping group, was asked to officially introduce the Jackson 5 to the world and remained a lifelong influence on Michael Jackson.\n\nOther new cast members of the Lionsgate and Universal Pictures International project include Jessica Sula (Split) as La Toya Jackson, Michael’s older sister; Liv Symone (Power Book III: Raising Kanan) as Gladys Knight; Kevin Shinick (Robot Chicken) as Dick Clark; KeiLyn Durrel Jones (The Other Two, How to Die Alone) as Jackson’s former security-turned-trusted friend and confidante Bill Bray; and Kendrick Sampson (Insecure) as industry icon Quincy Jones, who first met Michael Jackson when he was just 12 years old. The pair would go on to collaborate on three of Michael’s most successful albums: 1979’s Off the Wall, 1982’s Thriller, and 1987’s Bad.\n\nMichael is being directed by Antoine Fuqua, and three-time Oscar nominee John Logan wrote the script. is currently in production and has added several more stars in recent weeks. Jackson’s nephew Jaafar Jackson will make his screen debut playing his uncle in the film, while 9-year-old Juliano Krue Valdi will portray the King of Pop from his early days in the Jackson 5.\n\nColman Domingo and Nia Long will play family heads Joe and Katherine Jackson. Miles Teller will play Jackson’s attorney and advisor John Branca. Eight actors will portray Jackson’s siblings over two time periods, and Laura Harrier will play portray pioneering female music executive Suzanne de Passe. Prince Jackson, Jackson’s eldest son, is working with the production on set, side-by-side with the filmmakers, on behalf of his siblings.\n\nMichael is set to hit theaters on April 18 2025."
