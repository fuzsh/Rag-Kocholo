A fixture in film during the golden age of Black-centric cinema, starring in many a Black classic that still graces out screens and streams today. He often played the protagonist or the key love interest, lighting up the intrigue and imagination of millions for the better part of the ’90s and ’00s.\n\nNow at 47, Tate is still effortlessly serving as the blues and the funk in each thigh for millions of Black Gen X-ers and Millennials."
