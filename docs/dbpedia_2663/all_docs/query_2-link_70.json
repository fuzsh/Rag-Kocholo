        "text": "The cast of the forthcoming Michael Jackson biopic is already an ensemble. As announced on Monday\n\n(Mar. 25), Insecure‘s Kendrick Sampson and Larenz Tate have joined the cast to play Quincy Jones and Berry Gordy, respectively.\n\nKat Graham has also been added to the cast to portray Diana Ross. Jessica Sula will play La Toya Jackson, Liv Symone as Gladys Knight; Kevin Shinick as Dick Clark, KeiLyn Durrel Jones as Bill Bray, Miles Teller as Jackson’s attorney and advisor John Branca, and Laura Harrier as executive Suzanne de Passe.\n\nMichael, directed by Antoine Fuqua, is currently in production.\n\nJuliano Krue Valdi is set to star as young Michael from his early days in the Jackson 5 while Jaafar Jackson stars in the title role as the King of Pop in his feature film debut. Colman Domingo and Nia Long will portray Joe and Katherine Jackson.\n\nGraham King of GK Films, producer behind Bohemian Rhapsody, has been tapped to produce Michael. “I’m thrilled that we were able to bring together such a gifted group of actors for this film,” King said in a statement. “What they bring to these key roles provides a rich backdrop for the movie, adding to the extraordinary ensemble.”\n\nPrince Jackson, the late singer’s eldest son, is also reportedly working with the production on set—on behalf of his siblings, Paris and Bigi (formerly known as Blanket). The latter recently filed for an injunction against his grandmother accusing her of withholding access to his father’s estate, barring him from his inheritance. It’s unclear if newer situations such as this will be addressed in the film, but it’s unlikely.\n\nMichael‘s theatrical release is slated for April 18, 2025."
