        "text": "Overall, ... the filmmakers have taken the line of least resistance, fashioning a familiar, 'inspirational' American tale about a man who overcomes personal trauma and experiences individual success. There's little richness in that.\n\nFebruary 15, 2021\n\nIt's hard to think of a more artless film depicting such a talented artist.\n\nApril 19, 2020\n\nRAY suffers from having not enough story to warrant a feature film and too much talent wasted on caricatures of historical figures. RAY, like last year's BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, is too focused on homage rather than telling a convincing and stirring story.\n\nAugust 19, 2019\n\nJamie Foxx as Charles proves again that he may just be one of the most interesting actors of his generation. A subtle mix of impression, pathos and rare presence, Foxx holds your focus even when the film begins to prevaricate.\n\nApril 23, 2019"
