        "text": "Indiana Black Expo recently announced that award winning actor Larenz Tate will receive its Screen Image Award at its Pacers Sports & Entertainment Corporate Luncheon presented by Indiana University on Friday, July 15 at 11:00 a.m. in Halls D & E inside the Indiana Convention Center.\n\n“Larenz Tate is a talented actor and his characters have blessed us in some of our all-time favorite movies,” said IBE President & CEO Tanya Bell. Larenz Tate is currently recording and producing a dramatic, audio series for the fast-growing, digital media platform with Academy Award nominee, Laurence Fishburne. Born and raised on the West Side of Chicago, Tate is recognized as an actor, writer, producer and activist—recently adding director to his list of accomplishments.\n\nTate is perhaps best known for his groundbreaking role in the cult classic “Menace II Society.” His feature film credits include “Inkwell,” “Dead Presidents,” “Why Do Fools Fall in Love,” “Love Jones,” “A Man Apart,” “Waist Deep” and “Biker Boyz,” among others. Tate co-starred in the three-time Academy Award-winning film “Crash,” as well as the film “Ray” opposite Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington. In his latest film “Deuces,” he stars opposite Meagan Good; the action/drama hits theaters in the Fall 2016.\n\nHis television credits include starring roles on the gritty NBC drama series “Game Of Silence” which recently finished its network run this past June, the USA Network medical drama “Rush,” the FX’s hit show “Rescue Me,” as well as a recurring arc on the Showtime hit series “House of Lies.” Tate also starred in the BET movie “Gunhill” and the TV One movie “White Water.”\n\nTate’s main personal interests are The Tate Bros Foundation, a non-profit organization which he and his brothers created to help assist and raise awareness for children living with Sickle Cell Anemia and also, being the spokesman for the BLOOM campaign, the California Community Foundation (CCF) for at-risk youth, an initiative which is the country’s only safety net for teenaged African American males with a criminal past.\n\nThe Corporate Luncheon is the largest luncheon in the state of Indiana with nearly 3,000 guests. Tickets are $60 each and tables are $600, both of which are available at www.indianablackexpo.com or at the IBE box office located at 3145 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. For more information, call 317.925.2702\n\nAbout Indiana Black Expo, Inc.\n\nIndiana Black Expo, Inc. is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) statewide organization with 12 chapter affiliates.
