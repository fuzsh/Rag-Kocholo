        "text": "Larenz Tate Will Star In And Produce 1950s/60s NYC-Set Romantic Drama 'Sylvie's Love'\n\nShadow and Act Staff\n\nFebruary 06, 2014\n\nUpdated September 18, 2023\n\nLarenz Tate, via the production company he runs with his brothers LaRon and Lahmard (TateMen Entertainment), will produce an indie period drama titled Sylvie’s Love, which Larenz will also star in.\n\nThe feature project will be directed by Eugene J. Ashe, from his own script.\n\nThe 1950s/60s NYC-set Sylvie’s Love centers on a young woman fighting to stay loyal to her fiancée who’s off fighting a war in Korea, when she falls for a larger-than-life Harlem saxophonist (played by Tate).\n\nThe lead female role (nor any other casting) hasn’t been announced yet.\n\nTate will next be seen in NBC’s Craig Robinson’s comedy series, from creators of The Office, which the network ordered earlier this month; as well as Gun Hill, the BET original movie directed by Reggie “Rock” Bythewood (Biker Boyz), in which Larenz Tate portrays twin brothers, Trane and Bird, on opposite sides of the law. The film also stars Emayatzy Corinealdi, Michael Aronov, Phyllis Yvonne Stickney, Tawny Cypress and Aisha Hinds.\n\nWriter/director Eugene Ashe’s last feature film, which was also his feature directorial effort, was 2011’s Homecoming – a featue film that premiered at that year’s Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival, where it was a Saatchi & Saatchi Nothing’s Impossible producer’s award finalist, as well as a nominee for Best Feature Film in the festival’s HBO’s competition:"
