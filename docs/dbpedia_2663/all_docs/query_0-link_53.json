        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 7, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- BET Networks announced today that it will begin production on a new original movie for television, GUN HILL, in New York City. The film, which stars seasoned actors Larenz Tate, Tawny Cypress and Aisha Hinds, is a fast-paced, gritty cop drama which brings a fresh spin to the Cain and Abel saga set in New York City. Identical twins with little in common – one is a cop, the other a con – change in an instant as their lives become intertwined one fateful night when the cop is killed and the con assumes his identity.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20070716/BETNETWORKSLOGO )\n\nActing veteran Tate lends his talents to star in a dual role in GUN HILL. Tate's acting background boasts credits from films such as \"Ray,\" \"Crash,\" \"Love Jones,\" \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\" \"Menace II Society\" and most recently \"Rescue Me.\" Tawny Cypress (\"Heroes,\" \"Rescue Me,\" \"Third Watch\") and Aisha Hinds (\"True Blood,\" \"Hawthorne,\" \"Detroit 1-8-7\") also star in the film. GUN HILL is written, directed and executive produced by Reggie \"Rock\" Bythewood (\"New York Undercover,\" \"Notorious\") and Don Kurt (\"Justified,\" \"New York Undercover,\" \"Biker Boyz\") is the executive producer.\n\nAbout BET Networks\n\nBET Networks, a subsidiary of Viacom Inc.
