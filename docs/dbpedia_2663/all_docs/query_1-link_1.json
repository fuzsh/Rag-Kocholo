        "text": "American actor (born 1975)\n\nLarenz Tate (born September 8, 1975[1][2]) is an American film and television actor. He is best known for his roles as O-Dog in Menace II Society, Anthony Curtis in Dead Presidents, and as Councilman Rashad Tate in Power. Tate's other films and television series include the films Love Jones, A Man Apart, Crash, Waist Deep, Ray and the television series Rush and Game of Silence.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nTate was born in Chicago, to Peggy and Larry Tate.[3] He is the youngest of three siblings; his two brothers, Larron and Lahmard, are also actors.[4][5] The family moved to California during the early 1980s.[6] Convinced by their parents to enter a drama program at the Inner City Cultural Center, the trio did not take the lessons seriously until classmate Malcolm-Jamal Warner's ascent to fame after being cast on the sitcom The Cosby Show. Subsequently, realizing that they could parlay their efforts into a tangible form of success, the siblings began to receive small roles and in 1985, Tate made his small-screen debut in an episode of The New Twilight Zone.[7] Tate attended Palmdale High School, graduating in 1993.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing appearances in such television series as 21 Jump Street and The Wonder Years, Tate was cast in the television movie The Women of Brewster Place before receiving the recurring role of Steve Urkel's nemesis, Willie Fuffner, in the sitcom Family Matters.[9] He also appeared as Curtis, a grandson of Redd Foxx's character on the CBS series The Royal Family.[10] Foxx died of a heart attack a month after The Royal Family debuted, and a reworking with Jackée Harry as part of the cast failed to save the series.[11]\n\nAfter numerous acting roles on television, collaborative filmmaking siblings Albert and Allen Hughes approached him to star in their debut feature Menace II Society in 1993. In the film, Tate portrayed \"O-Dog\", a trigger-happy teenager.[12] Frederick I. Douglass of the Baltimore Black-American opined Tate's performance in the film made it an instant classic.[13] Tate had a regular role on the short-lived television series South Central (1994) as Andre.[14]\n\nTate acted in The Inkwell (1994) as Drew. One reviewer praised his performance and called Tate a \"promising\" actor.[15] However, in negative reviews Tate was seen as \"overacting\"[16] and compared unfavorably to Jim Carrey.[17] In 1995, Tate portrayed Vietnam veteran Anthony Curtis in the Hughes brothers' Dead Presidents.[18] A film reviewer stated Tate proved he could play sympathetic characters with his performance in the film.[19]\n\nHe took on the role of love-stricken young poet Darius in Love Jones (1997).[4] Critic Jay Carr found Tate \"engaging\" in the role.[20] Tate also played Kenny in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the episode \"That's No Lady, That's My Cousin\",[21] which was produced by Quincy Jones who Tate would later portray in the 2004 film Ray.[22]\n\nIn 1997, Tate appeared as Ford Lincoln Mercury in The Postman.[23] He played Frankie Lymon in the biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love (1998). One critic praised Tate's dancing prowess in the film.[24] He was the lead character, Neville, in 2000's Love Come Down.[25]\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Tate continued his film career. Tate portrayed Vin Diesel's drug officer partner in A Man Apart (2003),[26] with his other film work including Biker Boyz (2003),[27] Crash (2004),[28] and Waist Deep (2006).[29] Tate was featured in R&B singer Ashanti's 2003 released music video Rain on Me, where he played the jealous, abusive spouse of Ashanti. The video touched on the subject of domestic abuse. In the video game 187 Ride or Die, Tate voices the main character, Buck.\n\nTate portrayed Shooter Cooper in Love Monkey,[30] which was cancelled after three episodes. He starred in seasons 4-7 of FX's Rescue Me as Bart \"Black Shawn\" Johnston.[citation needed] Tate appeared as Malcolm, the brother of Don Cheadle's character, in House of Lies[31] and guest starred on an episode of The Mindy Project.[32] Tate starred as beta tester Max in Beta Test (2016)[33] and appeared in the 2017 film Girls Trip.[34] Starting in 2017, Tate played Councilman Rashad Tate on Power,[35] and continued portraying the character in sequel series Power Book II: Ghost.[36]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1991 Clippers TJ TV movie Seeds of Tragedy Cornelius TV movie 1993 Menace II Society Kevin \"O-Dog\" Anderson 1994 The Inkwell Drew Tate 1995 Dead Presidents Anthony Curtis 1997 Love Jones Darius Lovehall The Postman Ford Lincoln Mercury 1998 Why Do Fools Fall in Love Frankie Lymon 2000 Love Come Down Neville Carter 2003 Biker Boyz Wood A Man Apart Demetrius Hicks 2004 Crash Peter Waters Ray Quincy Jones 2006 Waist Deep Lucky 2008 Blue Blood Tre TV movie 2011 Sacks West Larenz Short Gun Hill Bird Stevens/Train Stevens TV movie 2015 White Water Terrance TV movie 2016 Beta Test Max 2017 Girls Trip Julian Deuces Deuces Salamander Ethan TV movie 2019 Business Ethics Zachery Cranston 2025 Michael Berry Gordy Post-production\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1985 The Twilight Zone Older Brother Episode: \"Night of the Meek\" 1987 Hunter Sporty's Nephew Episode: \"Crossfire\" Frank's Place Other Boy Episode: \"Cool and the Gang: Part 1 & 2\" 1988 Sonny Spoon Tim Episode: \"Cheap & Chili\" Amen LeShawn Episode: \"Get Em Up, Scout\" 1989 21 Jump Street Young Adam Fuller Episode: \"Wolly Bullies\" The Wonder Years Basketball Team Captain Episode: \"Loosiers\" The Women of Brewster Place Sammy TV mini series Matlock Street Kid #3 Episode: \"The Scrooge\" 1990 New Attitude Chilly D Main cast You Take the Kids Tyrone Episode: \"The Eggs & I\" 1990–91 Family Matters Willie Fuffner Recurring cast: season 2 1991 The Royal Family Curtis Royal Main cast 1992 The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Kenny Episode: \"That's No Lady, That's My Cousin\" 1993 Harts of the West Marcus Episode: \"Cowboyz in the Hood\" 1994 South Central Andre Mosely Main cast 2006 Waterfront Marcus Main cast Love Monkey Derrick \"Shooter\" Cooper Main cast 2007-11 Rescue Me Bart \"Black Sean\" Johnston Recurring cast: seasons 4-5, main cast: seasons 6-7 2011 Justified Clinton Moss Episode: \"For Blood or Money\" 2013 The Mindy Project Tracy Episode: \"Mindy Lahiri Is a Racist\" 2013–15 House of Lies Malcolm Kaan Recurring cast: seasons 2-4 2014 Rush Alex Burke Main cast 2016 Game of Silence Shawn Cook Main cast 2017–20 Power Councilman Rashad Tate Recurring cast: season 4, main cast: seasons 5-6 2020-23 Power Book II: Ghost Recurring cast: season 1, main cast: seasons 2-3\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2005 187 Ride or Die Buck Voice role\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominated work Result 1992 Young Artist Awards Best Young Actor Starring in a New Television Series The Royal Family Nominated 1993 Best Young Actor Guest Starring in a Television Series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Nominated 1998 NAACP Image Awards Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture Love Jones Nominated 2005 Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Ray Nominated Gotham Awards Best Ensemble Performance (shared with the cast) Crash Nominated Hollywood Film Awards Ensemble of the Year (shared with the cast) Won 2006 Critics' Choice Movie Awards Best Acting Ensemble (shared with the cast) Won NAACP Image Awards Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture Nominated Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Won 2010 NAACP Image Awards Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series Rescue Me Nominated 2015 Outstanding Actor in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special Gun Hill Nominated Black Reel TV Awards Outstanding Actor, TV Movie or Limited Series Won 2020 Outstanding Supporting Actor, Drama Series Power Nominated 2021 Outstanding Guest Actor, Drama Series Power Book II: Ghost Nominated\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
