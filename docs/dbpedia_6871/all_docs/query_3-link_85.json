        "text": "https://www.thejamesmadisonmuseum.net\n\nAs the birthplace of eight presidents, Virginia is one of the best places to tour Presidential sites. Many of the presidents, including Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, have multiple sites you can visit. I’ve already reviewed James Madison’s home in the beautiful rolling countryside of Orange County, Montpelier, and this past Presidents’ Day weekend, I was excited to visit the James Madison Museum of Orange County Heritage in the same county.\n\nHistory\n\nJames Madison was born on the Northern Neck in eastern Virginia at Port Royal (see my review of his birthplace here). The main home associated with Madison, Montpelier, is located in the rolling hills of Orange County, once the westernmost county in Virginia. Madison is known as a Founding Father, the father of the Constitution, and for leading the country through the War of 1812. He’s also known as Dolley Madison’s husband – she had quite her own following!\n\nVisit\n\nThe James Madison Museum of Orange County Heritage is located in the lovely town of Orange and is the first museum to honor President Madison. Its location right in the heart of the quaint downtown makes it an easy stop before or after lunch at one of the cute restaurants or in conjunction with a visit to Montpelier, just a few miles west of the museum along Constitution Highway.\n\nThe museum opened in 1976 to honor President Madison and Orange-born President Zachary Taylor. It also focuses on the history of Orange County, including the story of Native Americans and enslaved people.\n\nThe museum is open daily and the docents are friendly and eager to show you around. They give tours to school groups so are ready to handle families with children.\n\nThe museum is made up of four main rooms along with an annex called the Hall of Agriculture and Transportation. After paying your entrance fee, you’ll go into the first room which has historical items from Orange County’s late 19th/early 20th century past. I loved seeing the difference in the dresses from the impossibly corseted late 19th century and the loose flapper dresses from the roaring 1920s!\n\nStraight ahead is the room dedicated to President Madison and his wife, Dolley. I especially loved the displays about Dolley, she is such a fascinating person from history!\n\nThey even have a shawl worn by Dolley and a baby’s bonnet she knitted in 1806!\n\nYou can learn more about Madison and his rise to the presidency in the displays. There are several items of Madison’s on display.\n\nThere are also items from almost every Virginia president displayed.\n\nYour kids will enjoy seeing how they measure up to the diminutive Mr. Madison, who stood at only 5’6”.\n\nThere are also two chairs in the museum belonging to cousins and fellow presidents James Madison and Zachary Taylor, who was born in Orange County.\n\nAfter leaving the Madison room, continue out to the Hall of Agriculture and Transportation. If you have kids who love cars and tractors, they’ll love this part of the museum!\n\nThere are all sorts of transportation vehicles in the displays, from 1920s Model Ts to carriages from the early 19th century. I loved looking at the carriages, imagining the women in the large dresses fitting on the tiny seats!\n\nThere is also a reconstructed home in the hall. This home is an original 1732 cube house, one of the few left standing in the country. You can even walk in!\n\nDon’t forget to get your children’s picture as James and Dolley!\n\nNote the hall is not heated or air-conditioned so plan accordingly.\n\nAs you step back inside the museum, you’ll come to the Native American room, which details the history of the Native Americans in Orange County. If your child needs to do research on the Manahoac tribe, this room contains a wealth of knowledge!\n\nThe final room is the Black history room containing displays beginning with Black patriots’ work in the American Revolution. It has artifacts and maps about the passage of enslaved people from Africa to the New World and continues through the post-Emancipation struggle for civil rights.\n\nThe James Madison Museum in Orange is a great stop for families looking to learn all they can about the area’s history, particularly that of its most famous resident, President James Madison. I like how the museum also tells the complete story of the county’s history and provides a wealth of information for parents and kids alike. Make it a part of a field trip to picturesque Orange County this spring!\n\nRead my post about making this stop part of a Virginia Presidential Sites Road Trip!\n\nHelpful hints:\n\nCost: $10/adults; $3/child\n\nRecommended: ages 10 and up\n\nTour time: 30-45 minutes\n\nGift shop located onsite\n\nTransportation: The museum is accessible by car only. Limited parking is available at the front door, additional parking can be found in the lot below the museum.\n\nDining options: The museum is located just steps away from Orange’s quaint Main Street. Forked on Main is a great option and is run by the amazing Inn at Willow Grove owners.\n\nNearby hotels: The Inn at Willow Grove is a nearby luxurious option. It is truly one of my favorite hotels ever! The Round Hill Inn is also an option. For more budget-conscious travels, Charlottesville is a nearby city with lots of chain hotels.\n\nOther attractions nearby include: The Historic Town of Orange, The Exchange Hotel Civil War Medical Museum, Wilderness Battlefield and Historic Ellwood, the historic town of Gordonsville, and Liberty Mills Farm\n\nOther Madison sites include: James Madison’s Montpelier, Belle Grove (Madison’s birthplace-see my review here), Octagon Museum (Washington, DC), Greensboro History Museum (near Dolley’s birthplace), and the Dolley Todd house (Philadelphia, PA)\n\nBooks to Read:\n\nBe sure to check out my favorite recommendations of Presidential and First Lady history books for kids and adults at my Bookshop.org shop here (this is an affiliate link).\n\nHere are some of my recommended books specifically about James and Dolley (all links are Amazon affiliate links).\n\nYoung Adult/Adult:\n\nMontpelier and the Madisons: House, Home and American Heritage\n\nJames Madison: America’s First Politician\n\nA Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation\n\nStrength And Honor: The Life Of Dolley Madison\n\nFirst Ladies of the Republic: Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Dolley Madison, and the Creation of an Iconic American Role\n\nPatriot Hearts: A Novel of the Founding Mothers\n\nMiddle Grade:\n\nDolley Madison and the War of 1812\n\nThe Great Little Madison\n\nDolley Madison Saves History (Graphic History)\n\nWomen Who Broke the Rules: Dolley Madison\n\nThe Bill of Rights in Translation: What It Really Means\n\nWhat Is the Constitution?\n\n… If You Were There When They Signed the Constitution\n\nPicture Books:\n\nDolley Madison Saves George Washington\n\nWashington is Burning\n\nA Picture Book of Dolley and James Madison\n\nShh! We’re Writing the Constitution\n\nA More Perfect Union: The Story of Our Constitution"
