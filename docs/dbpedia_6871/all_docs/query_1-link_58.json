He also strongly believed in religious freedom.\n\nAlong with Thomas Jefferson, he founded the Democratic-Republican party, known as the first opposition party in U.S. history.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJames Madison was born in Port Conway, Virginia. His parents were James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. James was the oldest of 12 children.\n\nWith his large family, James lived on Montpelier. Montpelier was the family plantation in Orange County, Virginia.\n\nWhen James was 18, he attended the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University).\n\nAfter graduating, James became interested in the relationship between Britain and the colonies. At the time, conflict was growing over the issue of taxation.\n\nHe became a colonel in the Orange County militia. Because he was small and sickly, it wasn’t long before James gave up his military career for a political career.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nIn 1776, James Madison joined the Virginia legislature. He helped organize a new state government that was no longer under British rule.\n\nA few years later, in 1780, James became a Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.\n\nAfter the colonies gained their independence from the British, the Articles of Confederation became the first United States constitution. It gave very little power to the federal government.\n\nJames Madison researched other world governments and decided that the United States needed a stronger federal government.\n\nHe also wanted the government to have checks and balances, so no branch would have more power than the others.\n\nThe Constitutional Convention was held in May of 1787. James Madison presented his ideas for a new government system.\n\nIt was his idea to have a government with three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.\n\nDuring the convention, James took many notes. His plan and the notes he gathered from other delegates helped to form the Constitution. This is why he’s called the Father of the Constitution.\n\nSome people weren’t sure about the new Constitution. James wrote many essays called the Federalist Papers to help people understand why a strong federal government was needed.\n\nHe served four terms in Congress and helped write the Bill of Rights. These are the first ten amendments to the Constitution, and they grant important freedoms to American citizens.\n\nHe was also the Secretary of State under his good friend Thomas Jefferson.\n\nFamily Life\n\nIn 1794, the 43-year-old James Madison married Dolley Payne Todd. She was a 26-year-old widow with a young son.\n\nDolley was outgoing and loved to attend and host parties. James was known for being quiet and reserved, so their personalities were very different. During their marriage, however, they were almost never apart.\n\nThe couple did not have any children together.\n\nPresidency\n\nIn 1808, James Madison defeated Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and became the fourth president of the United States.\n\nFrance and Britain were at war, and Britain began seizing U.S. trade ships. James Madison asked Congress to declare war on the British, and they did.\n\nHowever, the United States was not prepared for war. The U.S. army didn’t have enough funding. State militias were asked to help, but many states did not support the war and refused.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, James ran for re-election against DeWitt Clinton and won. Still, many people were not happy about the war with Britain and the difficulties Americans faced as a result.\n\nIn August 1814, the British invaded Washington D.C. and burned down the White House. The United States won the final battle of the war, the Battle of Orleans.\n\nThis victory was led by Andrew Jackson, and it helped James Madison become popular again. The Treaty of Ghent was signed, and the war was over.\n\nAfter the Presidency\n\nAfter serving his two terms, James Madison retired to Montpelier with Dolley. He helped Thomas Jefferson found the University of Virginia and led the university after Jefferson’s death.\n\nHe died at the age of 85. At that time, he was the last living signer of the United States Constitution.\n\nFun Facts About James Madison\n\nAlthough James Madison is called the Father of the Constitution, he said the Constitution “was not the offspring of a single brain, but the work of many heads.”\n\nWhen the British burned the White House, Dolley Madison famously saved a painting of George Washington and several important documents.\n\nJames Madison was related to George Washington.\n\nJames Madison was only 5’4 and weighed 100 pounds.\n\nBoth of his vice presidents died in office.\n\nThomas Jefferson and James Madison met during Madison’s time in the Virginia legislature and became lifelong friends.\n\nHis last words were, “I talk better lying down.”"
