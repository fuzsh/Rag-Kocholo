        "text": "James Madison Before His Presidency\n\nJames Madison was born in Orange County, Virginia, on March 16, 1751. His family was wealthy, which offered Madison more education opportunities. In 1769 he went to the College of New Jersey, known as Princeton today. He graduated in 1771. In 1776, Madison was voted into the Virginia State Legislation.\n\nFour years later, Madison was the youngest member of the Continental Congress at 36. The Continental Congress was the government of the thirteen colonies from 1774 to 1789. In 1774, Madison was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\n\"Father of the US Constitution\"\n\nIn 1787, Madison introduced the Virginia Plan to Congress. Many of the ideas from the Virginia Plan would be used in the Constitution. Madison proposed a three-branch government: Legislature, Executive, and Judicial, with two bodies: the House of Representatives and the House of Senate.\n\nCongress accepted these branches and houses and then further defined their roles. What they could not agree on was representation. The North believed that slaves should not count in the number of representatives the South received, but the South disagreed. Madison proposed that slaves would count for one house but not the other, but this idea was struck down. They eventually agreed on the Three-Fifths Compromise.\n\nWhat was the Three-Fifths Compromise?\n\nThe amount of representatives from a specific state depends on that state's population. The Three-Fifths Compromise stated that 3/5 of the slave population would count towards the number of representatives a state could have. This would give the South an unfair advantage in the House of Representatives. Slaves were not allowed to vote or choose their representatives, so slave-owning states would effectively have more representatives than were needed for their state.\n\nMadison was considered to be the \"Father of the Constitution,\" even though he would have disagreed. Madison believed that many people worked on the Constitution and that they deserved recognition.\n\nYou give me a credit to which I have no claim . . . This was not, like the fabled Goddess of Wisdom, the offspring of a single brain. It ought to be regarded as the work of many heads and many hands.\" - James Madison\n\nFederalist Papers\n\nMadison and Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers. The papers were published in two different New York State magazines. Their goal was to convince the American people to accept the Constitution over the previous Articles of Confederation.\n\nArticles of Confederation\n\nCreated during the American Revolution, the first representative government in the United States consisted of only a congress, a temporary court system with minimal federal powers. The States held most of the governmental powers during this time until the Constitution replaced this form of government in 1789.\n\nBill of Rights\n\nMadison was a member of Congress, while George Washington was president in 1789. At first, he opposed the Bill of Rights, believing it would not be enough to guarantee the independence of the people. With the help of his long-time ally, Thomas Jefferson, Madison wrote and codified the Bill of Rights.\n\nBill of Rights\n\nThe first ten amendments to the Constitution protect freedoms such as the practice of religion, freedom of speech, protection from unlawful search and seizures, protection from unlawful prosecution, bail, and punishment. And protection of individual and state rights from the Federal government.\n\nDemocratic-Republican Party\n\nThomas Jefferson and James Madison opposed Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and John Adams. Both sides had different political goals and ideas. Jefferson formed the Republican-Democratic Party, the Jeffersonian Republicans, and Washington's side was called Federalists. Let's look at the below chart that compares both parties.\n\nDemocratic-Republicans Federalists Small, Decentralized Government Large, Strong GovernmentState Finances Should Be Separate From FederalUnion Should Assume State's Debt, National BankSupported FranceSupported Britain\n\nThe Democratic-Republicans wanted the states to be able to govern themselves, while the Federalists supported a strong centralized government. The Federalists convinced George Washington to form a national bank and for the national government to assume the state's debts. The Democratic-Republicans opposed this because they believed it put power into the hands of wealthy Northerners. Lastly, Jefferson's party favored France, while the other favored Britain.\n\nIn 1794, Madison became the leader of the Democratic-Republican party, and in 1801, they got Jefferson elected president.\n\nThe Jefferson Administration\n\nJefferson made Madison his Secretary of State. Then in 1803, Jefferson wanted to buy Florida and access the Mississippi River's mouth. During the purchase deal with Napoleon Bonaparte, France also offered to sell Louisiana. Jefferson thought that he could not buy it as it was unconstitutional. He believed that this would give too much power to the president.\n\nJefferson knew that this deal was too great to pass up on, so the Constitution had to be amended to give him the ability to make the purchase. Madison disagreed. Madison convinced Jefferson that the Louisiana Purchase was great for the new country of America. The Senate voted to expand the president's power, and Jefferson followed through with the purchase.\n\nThe Embargo Act of 1807\n\nFrom 1803 to 1815, France and Britain were tied up in the Napoleonic Wars. America wanted to remain neutral throughout the war, but both countries attacked American merchant ships. Jefferson passed the Embargo Act that forbade America from trading with other countries to prove to France and Britain that they relied heavily upon American goods. Madison supported the act.\n\nThis act hurt the American economy. Ships were stuck at docks with rotting supplies; some even turned to smuggling. The act was very unpopular amongst Federalists, many of who made fortunes from shipping goods to Europe. In 1809, Jefferson changed the act so that Americans could trade with countries other than France and Britain two days before the end of his presidency.\n\nJames Madison Timeline: Presidency\n\nJames Madison had two very significant events during his presidency. First, he declared war on England in 1812. This was the first war that America had entered since it was created. Secondly, he reinstated the National Bank. Let's explore those events!\n\nJames Madison: Facts During Presidency\n\nDespite the unpopularity of the Embargo Act, Madison won the next election. His presidency lasted from 1809 to 1817. Madison upheld the new Embargo Act and would not allow trade with France or England. Some congressmen thought Madison was too easy on France and England, who still attacked American merchant vessels.\n\nWar of 1812\n\nThe Non-intercourse Act replaced the Embargo Act. This regional act traded with both France and England. By 1810, the act was replaced with Macon's Bill, Number 2. This bill allowed Madison to restrict trade with France or England if one of the countries unrestricted their trade with America. When France considered dropping the restrictions, America restricted trade with Britain.\n\nEngland violated maritime laws by imprisoning American sailors and had given weapons to Native Americans. America blamed England for Native American hostility. America also wanted to expand, and England prevented that. In 1812, war broke out.\n\nIn 1814, the Presidential Mansion (the predecessor of the White House) was burned down along with Washington, DC. America was still very young and not yet ready for war. It lost the war of 1812, but American morale was boasted as America had some victories during the fight. Americans believed the war was a success and likened it to a \"Second War for Independence.\" The war ended in 1815 with the Treaty of Ghent.\n\nIn 1811, President Madison allowed the National Banks to close. Madison opposed the concept of Washington's presidency, so he simply allowed it to expire. The ease that the National Bank allowed the federal government access to the capital would've been beneficial during the war. Unfortunately, Madison didn't realize this until the war had ended. He reinstated the National Bank in 1816.\n\nPresident James Madison's Cabinet Members\n\nMadison had many cabinet members during his time as president. Let's look at the chart below to see who did what!\n\nRolePersonTime Served Secretary of StateRobert Smith1809-1811Secretary of StateJames Monroe1811-1817Secretary of TreasuryAlbert Gallatin1809-1814Secretary of TreasuryGeorge W. Campbell1814Secretary of TreasuryAlexander J. Dallas1814-1816Secretary of TreasuryWilliam H.

Cromingshield1814-1817\n\nJames Madison After His Presidency\n\nJames Madison retired in 1817. He went to live on his plantation Montpelier where he would manage his slaves. Madison assisted Jefferson with Jefferson's college, the University of Virginia, and was on the Board of Visitors. He took over the college in 1826 as a rector. Madison died of heart failure on his plantation in 1836.\n\nJames Madison Accomplishments\n\nMadison is one of America's founding fathers because he shaped the country. He heavily assisted with writing the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. He used the Federalist Papers to influence the public perception of the Constitution. Madison is the person who labeled all of the Federalists Papers because they were not signed when they were initially published. His contributions to America's history, culture, and foundation are still felt today.\n\nPresident James Madison - Key takeaways\n\nJames Madison is known as the \"Father of the Constitution\"\n\nMadison assisted with writing a lot of legislation that created the framework of the American government; one such piece was the Bill of Rights\n\nThomas Jefferson was unsure of what to do with the Louisiana Purchase. Madison's council convinced Jefferson to pursue the deal\n\nMadison was the 4th President of the United States of America\n\nIn 1812, Madison entered America into its first war as an independent nation- the War of 1812"
