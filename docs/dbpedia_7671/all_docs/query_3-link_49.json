        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger standing in front of a poster for \"The Last Stand\" in 2013 (Photo by lucacavallari on Shutterstock)\n\nBefore dominating the box office, Arnold Schwarzenegger conquered the world of bodybuilding and later turned his gaze to politics by becoming the Governor of California. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s success has been machine-like, and his impact knows no bounds. As a movie star, the Austrian Oak is known for his unparalleled charisma, raw power, and larger-than-life persona that grew to stardom on the silver screen. To this day, he is one of the few actors whose performances are always unique and never duplicated.\n\nWhether it be saving humanity from vile aliens, bestowing lust and heartthrobs, or making us laugh, Arnold Schwarzenegger has experienced success in every pursuit he’s undertaken. This is a good thing for us, as a new study found that smiling and laughter help us better manage daily stress. Researchers from the Division of Clinical Psychology and Epidemiology at the University of Basel say laughing can be a source of relief when dealing with stress. Their study finds that even cracking a smile can help ease the adverse effects of stress. Study authors estimate people laugh about 18 times a day. Typically, it’s during interactions with others or experiences that please them. With such success and a mindset of leaving no stone unturned, Arnold is one of the few who always leads by example and carves a path out when others can’t happen to see one.\n\nBut it wasn’t always an easy road for the actor. Oh no, not even close. He didn’t receive an acting gig for over five years when transitioning from bodybuilding. Fortunately, he was never in a desperate position, so he could be picky with the roles he went after. After receiving recognition and success with “Stay Hungry” and “Pumping Iron,” Schwarzenegger began captivating the hearts of millions when, just months prior, he was told he’d never amount to anything in cinema. Nowadays, it’s not uncommon for people to binge-watch his movies. This isn’t a bad thing, as a recent study found that binging streams takes a lot of self-control and can be therapeutic to our well-being. Researchers from the University of California-San Diego’s Rady School of Management and School of Global Policy and Strategy have found that people tend to preemptively schedule their binge-watching, preferring to watch certain shows or movies over others consecutively, and will often pay with money or time to binge shows.\n\nWe’re not saying you must watch all the Terminator movies in one go, but we certainly wouldn’t blame you either! Today we’re going to discuss the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies as voted by popularity, impact, box office success, and awards. Don’t happen to see your favorite? Feel free to drop us a comment!\n\nThe List: Best Arnold Schwarzenegger Movies, According to Experts\n\n1. “The Terminator” (1984)\n\n“The Terminator” by James Cameron, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was ahead of its time. As one of the greatest sci-fi action thrillers of all time, Arnold’s Hollywood stardom exploded into the stratosphere following its debut. As Buddy TV says, “This classic sci-fi film made Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name and established him as a major action star.” With deadpan quotes becoming among the most quoted lines in cinematic history, like “I’ll be back” or “Hasta la vista, baby,” The Terminator was a “huge box office success” with “taut storytelling,” making it a fan favorite for decades to come.\n\nAs a ruthless killing machine, Schwarzenegger delivers an electrifying screen performance from start to finish. The movie delivers pulse-pounding action and has audiences gripped in anticipation. As Movie Web mentions, “‘The Terminator’ is a masterclass that nailed down what determination meant in a villain, coupled with something that was faster, stronger, smarter, and which seemingly could not be killed.” Limping one foot at a time, “the finale remains one of the scariest moments in film history.” Moreover, the “performance is believable” and will have you feeling that the face of the future is up for grabs.\n\n“The Terminator” is a genre-defying blockbuster that forever transformed the future of action and sci-fi genres. For background, “A cyborg assassin known as Terminator is sent back in time to 1984 from 2029 to kill Sarah Connor, who would be the mother of the future leader of a resistance movement against machines,” relays Lifestyle Asia. To thicken the plot, “Kyle Reese is trying to stop the Terminator” and has been sent “from the same year to protect Sarah.”\n\n2. “True Lies” (1994)\n\nStep into the life of Harry Tasker, a seemingly ordinary family man who lives a double life as one of the government’s most elite agents. Another James Cameron masterpiece with Schwarzenegger at the helm, “True Lies” combines espionage, comedy, and action into an exhilarating thriller that’ll keep you on the edge of your seat. “‘True Lies’ is a big-budget spy film that boasts some of the biggest action scenes of Schwarzenegger’s career,” writes Slash Film. The movie is an “homage to the spy thrillers of Cameron’s childhood” and to this day is still widely considered “one of the most bombastic action films of the ’80s and ’90s.”\n\nFrom jaw-dropping stunts to heart-pounding chases, “True Lies” seamlessly ties together action-packed set pieces with laugh-out-loud humor. Watch as Arnold attacks the heart of international terrorism while maintaining his cover with co-star Jamie Lee Curtis as his wife. As Gold Derby mentions, “‘True Lies’ is an action-packed comedy that features a fantastic stunt sequence.” Schwarzenegger stars as a “fearless terrorist fighter whose biggest challenge occurs when his wife suspects he is having an affair with a sleazy used car salesman.” As for rewards, “Jamie Lee Curtis won the Golden Globe for Best Comedy/Musical Actress.”\n\nArnold’s performance in “True Lies” is nothing short of outstanding. The chemistry between him and Jamie is palpable, adding an extra layer of vulnerability and humor to the film. As Collider breaks down, “Upon learning that his wife Helen has become bored and desperately needs adventure, Harry secretly enlists her for a mock-spy mission.” However, “Things become real when Harry and Helen are both abducted by terrorists.” If you’re into an action-packed thriller with “big explosions and epic action scenes,” “True Lies” is a must-watch.\n\n3. “Conan the Barbarian” (1982)\n\nAs a titular character with commanding physicality and revenge-fueled quests, Schwarzenegger breathes life into “Conan the Barbarian.” Many movie critics believe that “Conan the Barbarian” is one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of all time. Watch as “Arnold battles giant snakes and cuts heads off for fun,” writes Movie Web. His “on-screen girth makes it believable that he could win every battle,” while as a whole, “‘Conan the Barbarian’ is pure Hollywood through and through.”\n\nTake a ride with Schwarzenegger as a vengeful-driven warrior seeking purpose and redemption. Known as the film that gave Arnold global acclaim, “Conan the Barbarian” is a timeless classic. As Collider says, “This was Schwarzenegger’s breakout performance, earning him worldwide fame.” It is a “tainted but thrilling ride that questions morality” and, “over time, became the benchmark for the sword and sorcery genre as a whole.”\n\nExploring the deeper depths of destiny, identity, and survival, “Conan the Barbarian” set the stage for Arnold to be “the body” actor. His stoic demeanor and formidable physicality deliver a potent combination, making him a favorite among many. As The Manual describes, “‘Conan the Barbarian’ is an epic tale of fierce beasts, damsels in distress, and the brawn.” Considered by many as “Arnold’s breakout role,” he thrills audiences with “his rippling physique, kickass fight scenes, and ruthless dismemberment.”\n\n4. “Commando” (1985)\n\n“Commando” is an adrenaline-fueled cinematic classic that stands tall as one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. With Arnold playing the indomitable hero, coupled with his classic one-liners and over-the-top explosive action, “Commando” is a fan favorite for good reason. As Variety says, “Travel to 1985, turn your brain off, and watch Schwarzenegger kill bad guys as John Matrix.” Going through hell and back, “Arnold prevails in rescuing the girl” and gives audiences more than enough reason “for two thumbs up.”\n\nStarring as Colonel John Matrix, Schwarzenegger defines what it means to be an action hero through sheer determination, invincibility, and a father-daughter connection that extends beyond the silver screen. Watch as the actor adds unsuspecting depth and heart to an otherwise action-packed adventure. As Slash Film explains, “‘Commando’ established Schwarzenegger as a true quip artist” and “only cost around $9 million to film.” Despite being a “cheaper film, ‘Commando’ leverages Arnold’s mountainous physique” to deliver a one-two box office hit.\n\n“Commando” is a non-stop action rollercoaster with fast-paced fight scenes and more TNT than you could possibly imagine. Acting as a one-man army, Schwarzenegger declares war against a ruthless dictator who kidnaps his daughter. As Movie Web says, “It’s a testament to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s savvy career choices that this really is the only out-and-out action movie.” And while some may think it’s silly “just how many things are blown up,” Schwarzenegger does pull off the role and looks “appropriately humongous.”\n\n5. “Predator” (1987)\n\n“Predator” helped solidify Arnold’s position as the ultimate action hero. As a battle-hardened special forces operator, Schwarzenegger is tasked with a rescue mission yet fails to know they’re being hunted by creatures with superior technology. As The Review Geek writes, “‘Predator’ is fresh, quite ahead of its time, and showcases how Arnie can pull off anything.” It all happens “while on a mission in Central America when a veteran and his team discover they are up against an extraterrestrial warrior.” Best of all, the “jungle setting adds more magic to the cinema experience.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TGlueman/status/1683574613706416128\n\n“Predator” is a riveting action-packed film that blends horror, suspense, drama, and some of Arnold’s most memorable one-liners, including “Get to the Chopper” and “If it bleeds, we can kill it.” As Buddy TV elaborates, “An alien predator stalks them one by one, building up screen tension and suspense.” As a “classic action-horror film,” the film “has inspired numerous sequels and spin-offs,” none of which hold up to this timeless piece of cinema.\n\nMaking an immediate impact on pop culture, “Predator” remains an iconic testament to Arnold’s legendary filmography. There’s a reason why Arnold is known as the king of action cinema. As Variety asks, “Schwarzenegger with machine guns, getting ready for battle, and kicking ass alongside Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, and more – what more can you ask for?” In the grand scheme of cinema, “Initiating the ‘Predator’ franchise was a walk in the jungle.”\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nBest Tyler Perry Movies\n\nBest Tom Cruise Movies\n\nBest Robin William Movies\n\nBest Eddie Murphy Movies\n\nBest Alfred Hitchcock Movies\n\nBest Samuel L.
