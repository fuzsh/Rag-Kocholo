        "text": "Our favorite famous “twins” are returning to the big screen after a long 35-year wait: Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger are back. DeVito is confirming a new project is in the works with Schwarzenegger. The news comes 35 years after the release of Twins, a comedy classic that stared the unlikely pair.\n\nThe It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia alum revealed to CNN recently that he and the Terminator star are working on another movie together. DeVito, 79, added, “We’re hoping that sooner than later, we’ll have a nice script to go to work.”\n\nRELATED: Arnold Schwarzenegger On His Aging Body: ‘You Suck’\n\nOf his longtime friendship with Schwarzenegger, 76, DeVito said they had been “good buddies” way before they filmed 1988’s Twins together. “We get along really well,” added DeVito. The dynamic duo also starred in 1993’s Last Action Hero, where DeVito voiced a cartoon cat detective and in the 1994 comedy Junior.\n\nThe Matilda star first teased a potential reunion with Schwarzenegger in an interview with Wired in 2022, Danny DeVito answered the most Googled questions about him. One of the questions was: “Is Danny DeVito related to Arnold?” He hilariously replies, “Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger, he’s my little brother.” Besides saying they get along really well, he also calls Arnold “really cool.” He teased that he couldn’t wait until they worked together again, with wide eyes and a flourish of his fingers.\n\nDeVito then told GQ in a November 2023 interview that because Schwarzenegger became governor of California, they missed out on Twins 2. He joked, “He should have done Twins 2 instead of becoming governor.” There have been rumors of a sequel called Triplets for years, but DeVito clarified that their next project is about “just two friends, two guys.”\n\nDanny and Arnold surprised fans when they showed up as presenters at the 2024 Oscars ceremony earlier this month. Poking fun at Michael Keaton in the audience, DeVito and Schwarzenegger earned a standing ovation for playing the Penguin and Mr. Freeze, respectively.\n\nThe adorable duo’s most recent collaboration was for State Farm Insurance ads.\n\nAmerica’s 50 Favorite Actors Of All Time Ranked By Positive Opinion\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
