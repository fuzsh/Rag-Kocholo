        "text": "Name: Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nBirth Name: Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger\n\nHeight: 6' 2''\n\nSex: M\n\nNationality: American\n\nDate: July 30 1947\n\nBirth Place: Thal Graz Austria\n\nOccupation: actor author director restaurateur fitness expert\n\nEducation: University of Wisconsin (majored in International Marketting and Business Administration; graduated in 1979)\n\nHusband/Wife: Maria Shriver (TV journalist; married April 26 1986 in Hyannis Massachusetts)\n\nRelationship: Brigitte Nielsen (actress)\n\nFather: Gustav Schwarzenegger (policeman; died in 1972)\n\nMother: Aurelia (died in 1998)\n\nBrother: Meinhard (champion boxer)\n\nSon: Patrick Arnold (born in 1993) Christopher Sargent Shriver (born in 1997)\n\nDaughter: Katherine Eunice (born in 1989) Christina Maria Aurelia (born in 1991)\n\nClaim to fame: as The Terminator (T-101) in The Terminator (1984)\n\n(Source : www.celebritywonder.com)\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger\n\n\"Bring it On\"\n\nFrom the \"Sixth Day\" press kit...\n\nArnold Schwarzeneggers motion picture career began in 1977 in the critically acclaimed feature-length documentary \"Pumping Iron,\" a behind-the-scenes look at the Mr. Universecompetition. His next role, opposite Sally Field and Jeff Bridges in \"Stay Hungry\" for director Bob Rafelson, garnered Schwarzenegger a Golden Globe Award as Best Newcomer in Films. In 1978, Arnold retired from professional bodybuilding to pursue a full-time career in acting. He starred with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the romantic action-comedy western \"The Villain\" and as Mickey Hargitay in the made-for-TV movie \"The Jayne Mansfield Story.\" Schwarzeneggers breakthrough film role came in 1982 in John Milius \"Conan the Barbarian.\" The film grossed over $100 million worldwide, spawned a popular sequel (\"Conan the Destroyer\") and earned Schwarzenegger a devoted following.\n\nSince 1979, Schwarzenegger has served as the International Weight Training Coach of the Special Olympics. From 1990 to 1993 he served as Chairman of the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He is currently Chairman of the California Governors Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and is the author of numerous best-selling books on fitness and health. He has twice received the Simon Weisenthal Centers National Leadership Award for his support of the organizations Holocaust studies and human rights issues, in 1991 and again in 1997. In 1997, Schwarzenegger was also honored by the National Association of Theater Owners with its first-ever Humanitarian Award for his many contributions to the community.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStars like you, and Tom Cruise, are hanging off mountains and doing more than stunts than you used to. Is that true?\n\nArnold: Well I think because if you're known to be an action star, the most important thing you do is that all the action is totally believable, and that the people see your face in it. Therefore, you have to end up doing most of it yourself. The only time you used someone to double you is if it's a life-threatening situation, or if you cannot do something. I think in most cases, you have to do it yourself. On \"Sixth Day\", I remember the running we did up there on top of the roof, from eight o'clock at night to six in the morning, running up the same steps - it was like 52 steps...and I thought to myself \"This is good practice for skiing because it was the perfect skiing exercise.\n\nDid you have a close call on the set?\n\nArnold: I have a close call in every one of my movies and they're usually in scenes in which you don't expect them at all. In this particular movie, I was diving in the tank with those clones and life-size embryos and I came out the wrong end, where there was a ceiling above the water. I had no more air in my lungs and luckily, a scuba diver detected my problem and I felt his hand pulling me out of the water in the right direction so I can breathe. I scuba dive all the time and I swim all the time. I just went the wrong direction.\n\nWill the doll [in this movie] be available for merchandising?\n\nArnold: I'm always heavily against that stuff because you only do that if it really lends itself but you should never force the issue, much like sequels. If people are really demanding a sequel to a movie, like in my case, \"Total Recall\", \"True Lies\" or \"Terminator\", then you work in that direction. But if no one has ever ask to do a sequel to \"Kindergarten Cop\" or \"Twins\", because they are movies that stand by themselves and you don't want to see the same gimmick again, then you stay away from it. You don't look and it and say \"Look this made money, let's go for the same cheap shot again and copy it.\" That's what studios normally do because studio executives are the most uncreative characters out there.\n\nHaving said all that, where do we stand on the \"True Lies\" and \"Terminator\" sequels?\n\nArnold: I would say that \"Terminator 3\" is being written right now. There is a finished script and it's being rewritten and finalized. \"Total Recall\" is being rewritten. Unless I can clone myself, I cannot do all these movies at the same time. It takes so much time and you can only do, really, one movie a year, realistically speaking because if you did more than that, than you could not be part of the development of the movie, the marketing of it, the making of the movie and all those kinds of things. I always like to be part of as much of the whole thing from the beginning to the end, because that's what makes it fun.\n\nObviously, Jim Cameron [the director of \"Terminator\"] has said that he didn't want to do a T3 and I thought you weren't going to do it without him, so what's happened?\n\nArnold: Changed my mind.\n\nAnd what changed your mind?\n\nArnold: The script was really good and I thought that it ought to be made. Cameron explained it very well that he has too many other things that he's planning on and that he doesn't want to do it right now. That was it. I totally understand his point of view and we're such good friends, that we understand each other's point of views and totally respect them.\n\nAfter talking about these films, are you looking at a limited window here where you might be pushing audience's credibility, as you get closer to 60, and if there might be a problem with the audience accepting that?\n\nArnold: Yeah, there could be. You never know how long you can survive as an action star, or as an actor in the first place. The only way you know is when the audience tells you. It's like in politics: Eventually, the audience is going to vote against you and you're out of office. The same is with acting. The audience will let you know when they think it's not believable and that they do not want to see this. So far, no one, in any of my movies, has never mentioned that or questioned the action that they saw in the film. I think that it's also because I make it very believable. My action is much more believable, it just deals much more with character strength and inner strength, rather than just physical strength.\n\nIn \"Sixth Day\", it's more inner strength than physical strength because you're not really doing anything that heroic, physically. It's more having the guts and the brains to figure out a way of how can we, instead of fighting each other, get together and work towards a common goal which is to get our family back. In either case, I and my clone think that it's my family but it doesn't matter. We got to save the family. So it took intelligence, it took inner strength to do this, so it was playing much more on that even though there was a lot of action there.\n\n(Source : www.cinecon.com)"
