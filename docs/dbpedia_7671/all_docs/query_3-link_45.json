        "text": "The Running Man (1987)\n\nProbably the most underrated Arnold film, this Steven E. DeSouza scripted film — based on a story by Stephen King’s nom de plume, Richard Bachman, feels more ahead of its time every time you watch it. It anticipated both reality TV and a U.S. government that blends governing with bread-and-circuses entertainment under the Trump-like Damon Killian (Family Feud host Richard Dawson.)\n\nFun fact: Both Predator and The Running Man, both released in 1987, pair Arnie with Jesse “The Body” Ventura, who later became the governor of Minnesota and whose celebrity candidacy arguably paved the way for Schwarzenegger’s run for governor of California."
