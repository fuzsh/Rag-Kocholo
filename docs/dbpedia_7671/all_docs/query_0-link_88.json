        "text": "Throughout 2020 I watched and reviewed every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. So just for fun, here they all are – listed in order of preference. Prepare yourself: he has starred in some very good films, but also a lot of rubbish. A *lot* of rubbish…\n\nNote: For this countdown, I’ve ignored documentary features, TV movies, and films where Schwarzenegger makes only tiny cameos.\n\n41. Hercules in New York (1970)\n\nSchwarzenegger’s acting debut – if standing there and saying words aloud counts as acting. A barely professional and aimless story about a Greek god visiting modern-day Manhattan. Read the full review here.\n\n40. The Iron Mask (2020)\n\nA film so inept it beggars any belief you may have left after sitting through it. An action movie set in the 18th century, The Iron Mask features nonsensical storytelling, atrocious acting and some of the most badly dubbed dialogue ever to blight a film. Schwarzenegger is actually one of the very few plusses and is having fun, but it’s only a secondary role. Read the full review here.\n\n39. Red Sonja (1985)\n\nVery drab revenge-plot story starring Brigitte Nielsen. Schwarzenegger didn’t want to do a third film set in prehistoric fictional world created by Robert E Howard… and it shows. His obvious boredom is infectious. Read the full review here.\n\n38. Batman & Robin (1997)\n\nA turgid, crass and plastic endeavour, which nearly scuttled the chances of any more Batman films in the future. Arnie is woefully miscast as the theatrical villain Mr Freeze and labours through dialogue almost entirely made up of bad puns. Read the full review here.\n\n37. End of Days (1999)\n\nA film with lofty ambitions to tell a tale of Satan coming to New York to impregnate the mother of the Antichrist. Torturous and hackneyed. Read the full review here.\n\n36. Eraser (1996)\n\nIt’s the lack of distinction that kills this one – a sense that no one involved in the scripting, staging or acting has tried to make it anything other than a bland, predictable action thriller. Read the full review here.\n\n35. The Expendables 3 (2014)\n\nThe third, and so far final, entry in Sylvester Stallone’s series for mature action stars. As with the first two films, Arnie’s contribution is minimal. Read the full review here.\n\n34. The Expendables 2 (2012)\n\nSchwarzenegger and co-star Bruce Willis trade catchphrases as they cameo in this bloated sequel. Elsewhere, a dull plot is played out by largely appalling actors. Read the full review here.\n\n33. Conan the Destroyer (1984)\n\nThe first Conan film had been a breakthrough as a movie star for Schwarzenegger, but working on this equally flat sequel nearly lost him the most important role of his life. Thankfully for him (and us) James Cameron agreed to delay the filming of The Terminator until after the star was free of his Conan contract. Read the full review here.\n\n32. The 6th Day (2000)\n\nBuilt on the then-novel premise of cloning, this film – an action thriller from the turn of the millennium – has only half the fun you’d expect from having double the Arnold Schwarzeneggers. Read the full review here.\n\n31. Jingle All the Way (1996)\n\nNever likely to trouble George Bailey, Ralphie Parker or the Muppets at the top table of great characters from Christmas films, Howard Langston (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a dreadful father. He misses his son’s karate presentation due to working late, then abandons him on Christmas Eve in order to hunt for a last-minute present. It’s meant to be big, brash comedy – and may strike a chord with parents who have had frustrating experiences of trying to find a specific toy for a child. But there ain’t a single laugh in the whole film. Read the full review here.\n\n30. Conan the Barbarian (1982)\n\nHe’d appeared in a few movies before this, including a couple of leading roles, but this sword-and-scorcery epic put Arnie on Hollywood map. Filmed with a fetishistic eye for ritual by director John Milius, Conan the Barbarian looks gorgeous but is all too often tedious and lacking in oomph. Read the full review here.\n\n29. The Last Stand (2013)\n\nA schlocky slice of exploitation made soon after Schwarzenegger’s stint as Governor of California. He plays the sheriff of a sleepy US town who must prepare for a supervillain speeding through on his way to Mexico. A half-hearted, modern-day Western souped up with Fast & Furious stylings. Read the full review.\n\n28. Raw Deal (1986)\n\nA tough-guy action movie that sees Arnie’s cop go undercover with the mob. It’s crass and violent and feels like a churned-out copy of a better film. Read the full review here.\n\n27. Junior (1994)\n\nThe last of four comedies Arnie made with Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman lacks purpose – and oddly any real humour. Schwarzenegger teams up with Danny DeVito for an implausible screwball story about a male research doctor who impregnates himself to test an anti-miscarriage drug. Emma Thompson tries to inject some life as the love interest, but after a quarter of a century the film’s gender politics feel medieval. Read the full review here.\n\n26. The Expendables (2010)\n\nSchwarzenegger shot a one-day cameo in this crash-bang-wallop action film starring grizzled vets of the genre, and he did it as a favour for his buddy Sylvester Stallone. (Why just one day? Because he was serving as Governor of California at the time.) Arnie appears with Stallone and Bruce Willis in a scene that’s more to do with the actors’ celebrity than any storytelling. Read the full review here.\n\n25. Collateral Damage (2002)\n\nA meat-and-potatoes thriller about a fireman who takes on the Colombian drugs cartel after his wife and child are killed. Watchable enough on a surface level, there’s a hollow clank of emptiness. Some coincidental similarities to the much better film Clear and Present Danger do it no favours; neither did a release date soon after 9/11, which resulted in it coming off as insensitive. Read the full review here.\n\n24. The Villain (1979)\n\nOne of the more bizarre items on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s IMDB page is this comedy Western starring Kirk Douglas. Still then mostly known as a bodybuilder, Schwarzenegger plays a hulking bodyguard with the eccentric name of Handsome Stranger who must protect Ann-Margret and a cache of money on a cross-country trek. The humour is cartoony and reasonably funny; Arnie’s acting, however, is downright awful. Read the full review here.\n\n23. Red Heat (1988)\n\nThe set-up promises enjoyment – this is a very 1980s-ish culture clash that sees a louche, wisecracking American cop teaming up with an earnest, deadpan Soviet soldier. But unlike similar mismatched-duo films – such as 48 Hrs, which was made by the same director, or Lethal Weapon – here the two men never spark off each other or develop a relationship. The plot about a Russian drugs lord is pretty basic and none of the secondary characters is memorable. Read the full review here.\n\n22. Terminator Genisys (2015)\n\nThe biggest series of Schwarzenegger’s career has undoubtedly been the Terminator franchise. He returned to it in 2015, after a film off, and was now playing an older, more ‘human’ iteration of the T-800 android first seen in 1984. Terminator Genisys (yes, they really do spell it like that) is appalling on many levels. A convoluted storyline is obsessed with temporal mechanics; all the characters feel underwritten. But at least it’s never boring, while Arnie brings some deadpan humour to his role and has a nice fatherly bond with co-star Emilia Clarke. Read the full review here.\n\n21. Maggie (2015)\n\nSchwarzenegger’s post-gubernatorial career has often seen him take roles in low-budget and low-exposure projects. Here, he plays in surely the most downbeat and sombre movie of his whole career. Maggie is a zombie film, but rather than Dawn of the Dead-style tension and action, it centres on a distraught father (Schwarzenegger) who knows his infected daughter doesn’t have long to live. Admirably stark and raw, Maggie sadly lacks energy and drifts quite a bit. Arnie is quite impressive, though. Read the full review here.\n\n20. Stay Hungry (1976)\n\nAn early example of Arnold being asked to act, rather than just being cast because of his physique. In this unrushed drama starring Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, he still plays a bodybuilder – but an eccentric one who likes dressing up as Batman and playing in a bluegrass music band. Read the full review here.\n\n19. Around the World in 80 Days (2004)\n\nSchwarzenegger is rather terrible in this Jules Verne adaptation, playing a Turkish prince. He’s miscast and can’t handle the comedy and it’s something of a relief that his contribution is just an extended cameo. Elsewhere, this family film is fun enough for the most part as Steve Coogan’s dashing Phileas Fogg and Jackie Chan’s nimble Passepartout circumnavigate their way through episodic adventures. Read the full review here.\n\n18. Sabotage (2014)\n\nAnother of Arnie’s largely ignored post-Governor efforts. It ain’t subtle, being a crime film with lots of violence, gunplay and harsh language, but go with the exploitation edginess and it’s quite entertaining. The star plays a veteran DEA agent in charge of a ragtag team who bash down doors, kill bad guys and trade cutting quips. But when they plan to steal some cash from a drugs lord, someone betrays them and we enter a paranoia-fuelled mystery plot. Read the full review here.\n\n17. Scavenger Hunt (1979)\n\nSchwarzenegger’s role is tiny, playing a guy who runs a gym, but this caper comedy has a large and entertaining cast. When Vincent Price’s millionaire dies, his will specifies that his fortune will go to the winners of a San Diego scavenger hunt – so various relatives and employees race against the clock to find the required items. Wholly silly and not always that hilarious, there’s more than enough charm to keep it going. Read the full review here.\n\n16. True Lies (1994)\n\nWhen James Cameron wanted to make an ersatz James Bond film in the mid 90s, he hired his old Terminator colleague Arnold Schwarzenegger to star as American agent Harry Tasker. The espionage plot involving Tia Carrere and Art Malik’s terrorists is background noise; the focus is actually on Harry’s wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), who gets accidentally mixed up in all the chaos. Huge spectacle and action sequences mingle with self-awareness and gags. Read the full review here.\n\n15. Escape Plan (2013)\n\nAnother team-up with Sylvester Stallone, who plays a guy who has one of those jobs that surely only exists in movie-land – he’s hired by governments to test their prisons by going undercover as an inmate and seeing if he can escape. However, when he’s thrown into a hi-tech, off-the-books, uber-prison he needs help, and his only ally is fellow inmate Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger)… Outlandish and extreme, Escape Plan is not taking itself too seriously and is fun in a trashy, popcorn-cinema way. Read the full review here.\n\n14. Kindergarten Cop (1990)\n\nAfter successes as a prehistoric warrior, a futuristic cyborg and an all-American action hero, Schwarzenegger expanded his CV into comedy in the late 1980s. This present film saw him play a cop who must go undercover at an infant school to find out which child has a criminal father. It’s an odd 90 minutes – too schmaltzy to work as a grown-up thriller, too hard-edged for a family film – but there are some laughs involved. Read the full review here.\n\n13. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)\n\nWriter/director James Cameron had sold his interest in the series by the time of this third Terminator film, so perhaps inevitably there was a loosening of the quality-control. The film has to try to impress us while playing out a repetitious robots-from-the-future storyline, and some ill-judged campy comedy has been allowed to seep in. Nevertheless, Rise of the Machines still has got a lot to commend it. The script contains some good ideas, especially a switcheroo finale that goes somewhere unexpected, and the action is fantastic at times. Read the full review here.\n\n12. Aftermath (2017)\n\nA fuss-free drama about a man who loses his family in a air disaster. Arnie plays the grieving father and he does a very good job of making us believe in the anguish. As the months go by, however, construction worker Roman Melnyk is insulted by the airline’s insensitive offer of a payoff. He wants a genuine apology from the man he holds responsible – an air-traffic controller called Jake who was on duty at the time of the accident. Quietly powerful stuff and one of Schwarzenegger’s best acting performances. Read the full review here.\n\n11. Terminator: Dark Fate (2019)\n\nAs with Terminator Genisys (yes, they really do spell it like that), this sixth film in the series sees Arnold Schwarzenegger playing an elderly killing machine. When constructed, his character will have looked like a 1984 Arnie – but so much time has passed that the android’s outward appearance has aged. Dark Fate plays on this and builds it into the storytelling. This Terminator not only looks about 70, he’s also evolved a distinct personality and settled down with a family! Elsewhere, this is an exciting and engaging Terminator movie – the best not directed by series creator James Cameron – and has a commendable focus on female characters. Read the full review here.\n\n10. Predator (1987)\n\nMade when Schwarzenegger was in his 1980s, muscle-bound pomp, this jungle-mission movie starts off conventionally enough – then throws in a science-fiction twist in the form of an invisible alien who picks off Major Dutch Schaefer’s team one-by-one. Fuelled by a post-Vietnam fear of foreigners lurking in the trees, and featuring some of classic alpha-male posturing from Arnie, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and others, this is the kind of film The Expendables wishes it were. Whether smirking, shooting a machine gun, chewing a cigar or engaging in cinema’s best ever arm-wrestle-cum-handshake, Schwarzenegger is pure movie star throughout. Read the full review here.\n\n9. The Long Goodbye (1973)\n\nSchwarzenegger’s contribution to this Robert Altman film-noir pastiche is small. He’s an extra, a henchman with no dialogue, and makes a brief appearance… brief being an apt word, because in one scene he’s ordered to strip down to his underwear by a crime boss. It’s a typically absurd moment in a film that is wholly aware of genre conventions and has fun playing around with them. Elliott Gould is the super-laidback private eye Philip Marlowe, who investigates two mysteries which then inevitably collide. Dry, droll and idiosyncratic moviemaking. Read the full review here. Incidentally, there are other films with even more minuscule doses of Arnie, so scant in fact that we’ve excluded them from this countdown. For example, he appears for about two seconds each in Ivan Reitman’s easygoing political satire Dave and the fun action-comedy Welcome to the Jungle (aka The Rundown).\n\n8. Killing Gunther (2017)\n\nThis tongue-in-cheek film is a mockumentary – a hitman assembles a team of fellow assassins so he can take down his biggest rival… and hires a camera crew to record his efforts for posterity. It’s a comedy so plenty of fun comes from the characters knowing they’re being filmed: some play up for the camera, others try to present a specific image. Arnie is the gang’s target and enjoys spoofing his tough-guy image. Read the full review here.\n\n7. Twins (1988)\n\nThis was a bold move for Arnold Schwarzenegger. He’d built up a career based on his imposing physique, playing an assortment of action-based roles that called for strength, power and size. Then, in 1988, he stepped into comedy. It had a lasting effect, as he continued to pepper his CV with lighthearted films, but Twins’ casting coup still works really well as a meta gag. The gimmick of the story is obvious from the title and the poster: Arnie plays the twin brother of Danny DeVito, an actor of rather smaller stature. Together, their vastly different characters search for the mother who gave them up when they were born. It’s a film full of good-natured humour and charm. The two leads have great chemistry. Read the full review here.\n\n6. The Running Man (1987)\n\nThis seems to be one of those of movies whose reputation has grown over the years – perhaps because the outlandish satire of reality TV has become more and more accurate. Based on a short story by Stephen King, the film is actually now set in the past (2019), but when made it was looking forward 30 years and imagining a future as venal as it is brash. The economy has collapsed and a military-heavy government uses brutality to keep the population in check. They also sanction a hugely popular TV show, The Running Man, on which convicted criminals are hunted and killed in an abandoned area of LA… and it’s all soaked up by naive viewers as entertainment. (Think The Crystal Maze with psychopaths on the loose.) Schwarzenegger stars as ex-cop Ben Richards, who’s been framed for a massacre and is forced onto the game show. Can he survive? And also uncover the corrupt authorities? Full of energy and dark comedy, this is a tremendous film that has things to say about society… while at the same showing us exploding heads and people being carved in two. Read the full review here.\n\n5. Total Recall (1990)\n\nA spiritual sequel to The Running Man. Based on a Philip K Dick short story this time, Total Recall is set in the same kind of commercial-fascist future. Arnie is a construction worker who’s bored of his humdrum life (even though he’s married to a sultry Sharon Stone) so decides to treat himself. He pays to have fake memories of an adventure on the planet Mars implanted into his subconscious, but the procedure goes wrong. He’s left believing that he’s a secret agent and that his everyday life was just a cover story. Has he unearthed a long-buried truth? Or has his brain gone haywire thanks to the fake memories? Directed with unrestrained verve by Paul Verhoeven, Total Recall works as a madcap action thriller with impressive set pieces, boo-hiss bad guys, sci-fi embellishments and gallows humour. But it’s also a mystery story that keeps you guessing. Read the full review here.\n\n4. Last Action Hero (1993)\n\nThe 1970s TV sitcom Soap pulled off an amazing trick. It was a very funny pastiche of American daytime soap operas and all their archly dramatic plotlines (affairs, murders, demonic possession). But *at the same time* the show also made you invest in the characters emotionally – just like a successful soap opera. To spoof something and also *be* that thing takes real smarts from the creative team. In cinema, the sci-fi comedy Galaxy Quest has done the same thing. Its send-up of Star Trek was so precise and insightful, and yet also so affectionate, that some fans cite it as one of the best ‘Star Trek’ films ever made. It’s a similar story with Last Action Hero, which remorselessly pokes fun at the odd conventions of the action-movie genre, but also acts as an extremely entertaining action movie in its own right. This is glossy, expensive, bombastic, sarcastic popcorn cinema done on a huge Hollywood scale, all with a sense of fun and playfulness. A big reason for the success is that the film was made by the very people who had recently been defining the genre: director John McTiernan (Predator, Die Hard), writer Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout), composer Michael Kamen (Lethal Weapon, Die Hard) and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays a maverick cop who comes to realise he may be a fictional creation. Read the full review here.\n\n3. Commando (1985)\n\nFull of spectacular action and an often-overlooked self-awareness, this was the perfect vehicle for the mid-1980s Arnold Schwarzenegger. He plays a retired Special Forces agent called John Matrix (what a name!), who must leap into action when terrorists kidnap his daughter Jenny. They try to blackmail John into assassinating a politician for them, but he has other ideas: he kills his handlers, escapes, and sets off to save his daughter. It’s a streamlined plot, onto which a huge amount of enjoyment hangs. Arnie is at his charismatic best, whether tossing off droll one-liners, strutting his way through the cartoon violence or issuing threats to the bad guys. And there are multiple classic sequences as John races against time to find Jenny: John jumps from a plane, swings across a shopping centre, kills a henchman by dropping him off cliff. It’s all gleefully exuberant and extreme; the pace never sags, the script has no flab on it, and the supporting cast understand the OTT tone just as well as Arnie does (especially Vernon Wells as bad guy Bennett – an instant icon of 80s cinema). Read the full review here.\n\n2. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\n\nWhen it came to creating a sequel to his first big hit, writer/director James Cameron was very clever indeed. He took the essential elements from the first film – the tone, the backstory, the characters – but reset them in a new context. He’d actually done this trick before, when he made an action-packed, high-intensity sequel to the sci-fi suspense horror Alien. With Terminator 2, Cameron moved the story on in interesting ways, setting it more than a decade later and giving his heroine, Sarah Connor, a radical development. He also decided on an amazing twist on expectation: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character was no longer the bad guy. But the biggest difference from the 1984 film is the scale – using a huge budget and cutting-edge CGI (which still stands up so well), Terminator 2 is a top-gear experience. The action is massive and exciting and has consequences, but the storytelling and characters are always front and centre. It vies with Aliens and Die Hard as the best action film ever made. Read the full review here.\n\n1. The Terminator (1984)\n\nCombining various genres – science fiction, horror, detective story, chase film – The Terminator is an absolute marvel. An android from the future arrives in 1984 to assassinate the woman who will give birth to a military leader – and Arnold Schwarzenegger is cast in the role of his career, a character that utilises his size, strength and deadpan delivery better than any other. James Cameron had directed a previous film, taking over the troubled production of a B-movie called Piranha 2: The Spawning, but this is essentially his debut. And he makes sure that every single element is on point and as sharp as it can be. The script is taut, the cast are really well chosen, the action is muscular, the lighting and editing are precise, the music is moody and tense. It’s an *experience* of a film: evocative and thrilling and compelling. Read the full review here.\n\nFor this film-by-film look at the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, I’ve been watching his movies in a random order and jotting down a few thoughts.\n\nWatched: 20 December 2020\n\nFormat: A DVD from my collection.\n\nSeen before? Yes.\n\nNote: I recently reviewed this film as part of another blogging series – you can read it here. So instead of repeating myself, this article is about the time-travelling implications of the Terminator series…\n\nSpoiler warning: this blog post covers all six Terminator films released between 1984 and 2019 – plot points will be revealed.\n\nReview: The Terminator films‘ complicated relationship to time starts in the year 2029. A war between humans and self-aware machines has been raging ever since an AI programme called Skynet became sentient in the 1990s, and humans are now guerilla fighters in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Wanting the upper hand, Skynet sends a ‘Terminator’ android back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor, the mother of the leader of the human resistance; the attempt will take place in 1984, before that leader, John, was even born. Fearing history being changed for the worse, the humans then capture the time-travelling equipment and send their own agent, Kyle Reese, back to 1984 in order to protect Sarah…\n\nStories about characters time-travelling into history tend to fall into two camps. In some, a time-traveller has a drastic effect on established history. Their very presence *changes* the past and creates a new, alternate timeline. Think of Back to the Future (1985), in which 80s teenager Marty McFly travels back 30 years and accidentally prevents his parents from falling in love. When he eventually returns to 1985, his actions in the past have fundamentally and permanently altered the lives of his family; only he is aware of how reality used to be. Other stories, however, go by a principle that the TV show Lost (2004-2010) termed ‘whatever happened, happened’. If someone travels back in time, they are not changing history but rather playing out their role in a history that already was. The time-traveller’s actions in the past had always happened – in a chronological sense, if not from the time-traveller’s subjective point of view. They can’t alter the past because their presence in it was always the case.\n\nOne of the surprising things, in retrospect, about 1984’s The Terminator is that it falls into the latter camp. This is a franchise famed for alternate timelines and altered continuities, yet in the original movie there’s a classic example of a ‘causal loop’. One event causes another, but then – thanks to time travel – that second event causes the first. In James Cameron’s script, Kyle Reese is sent on a mission by an adult John Connor. When Kyle reaches 1984, he falls in love with John’s mother, Sarah, and they have sex… and conceive John. Kyle is John’s father, and he always was. Kyle’s actions in 1984 ensure that the future he knows will still happen. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy: John is able to send Kyle into the past because he was born, but he was only born because he sent Kyle into the past.\n\nThings are different in the sequel, however. In Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Sarah Connor now has knowledge of the war to come – and she decides to prevent it. She plans to change history and create a new future. We can assume that the *original* Sarah (who raised the John Connor who, as an adult, sent Kyle back in time) always knew about the Skynet threat, thanks to her association with Kyle in 1984. (Keeping up?) But we’re never told whether she attempted to divert the arrow of time in the franchise’s original backstory. If she did, she must have failed – otherwise the film series would never have begun with a human/machine war in the 2020s. But in T2, Sarah *does* make a difference. Along with a 10-year-old John and an android ally played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, she destroys the key research that would have led to Skynet’s awakening. The future war has been averted and Sarah’s future is now unknown. As Sarah herself says in voiceover, ‘The future, always so clear to me, has become like a black highway at night.’\n\nThis creates a new timeline – the first (but far from last) in these movies. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) carries on this fresh continuity, but reveals that Sarah and John didn’t actually stop the war; they just delayed it. So in the future, Skynet sends another assassin to kill their nemesis John Connor before he becomes a Nelsonic military leader. When this attack comes, in the noughties, John is a twenty-something loner. (Sarah has died of leukemia since the previous film.) Helped by another Arnold Schwarzenegger-played android ally, John makes another attempt at preventing the start of the war. They fail, however, and the alternate timeline created in T2 finally gets its Judgment Day.\n\nThe next movie, Terminator Salvation (2009), continues this storyline. We jump forward about a decade or so, into the meat of the war, and John Connor is now the leader of the human resistance. We accept that this is the same John who lived through the events of Terminators 2 and 3; he’s even now married to his girlfriend from the latter film. So, up to this point, the Terminator movie series had seen just two timelines: the original, where Judgment Day took place in 1997, and a divergent version where it was delayed by a few years. But the temporal roadmap was about to get fundamentally more complicated…\n\nThe second splinter off the original track actually came on television, in the spin-off series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008-09). The show, which starred Lena Headey as Sarah, ignored Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines entirely and declared itself a sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It still used the idea that Sarah and John had only delayed Skynet’s ascent, but it kept Sarah alive and leukemia-free. So now Terminator fans had witnessed *three* timelines: the original story where Judgment Day takes place in 1997, one where Sarah delays Judgment Day until the mid-noughties and dies, and one where she delays Judgment Day until 2011 and survives.\n\nThe TV series only lasted two seasons. But the movie series returned in 2015 with an entry that said, ‘You think it’s been convoluted so far? Well, you ain’t seen nothing yet.’ Terminator Genisys is a film based on, and obsessed with, the temporal mechanics of its plot. Whereas earlier films had used time travel to get characters into certain positions or explain the stakes, Genisys plays around with cut-up continuity like a child whose Lego town is invaded by dinosaurs.\n\nIt begins with sequences that are repeating the opening of the first film from 1984. An Arnold Schwarzenegger-shaped killing machine travels back in time from 2029 to 1984 in order to murder Sarah Connor, and the human soldier Kyle Reese is sent back to protect her. Some gaps are filled in – we see Kyle being given his mission by an adult John Connor, for instance, which we were only told about in the first film – but this is all intended to be the exact same events as dramatised in James Cameron’s original. The carbon copy doesn’t last long, though: an additional Arnold Schwarzenegger arrives on the scene – and we learn this T-800 Terminator has been in the past since 1973, meaning that *this* timeline has actually been at variance with the original for a decade already.\n\nGenisys then spins off into many head-scratching developments involving a Sarah Connor who was targetted for death when she was nine years old and who time-travels from 1984 to 2017 to prevent a new and yet-again-delayed Judgment Day. But what it meant – after five movies and a TV series – was that we were now up to at least four competing timelines. One (the TV show) had acted like the third film has never existed, while another (Genisys) invalidated all the storytelling that came after the original film’s opening few scenes.\n\nMovie sequels that ignore previous sequels are not unique to the Terminator franchise. There are films that are definitive reboots, of course, such as the James Bond adventure Casino Royale (2006), which wiped the narrative slate clean and started the whole timeline afresh. But more relevant to this discussion are those sequels that are *selective* about which previous films they are sequelling. Highlander III (1994) ignored the ridiculed second film in its series, for example, while Superman Returns (2006) pretended Supermans III and IV hadn’t happened. The blood-soaked biscuit must be taken by the horror series Halloween, which has *twice* given us sequels that discount other sequels: Halloween H20 (1998) and Halloween (2018), which both act as many-years-later follow-ups to the 1978 original. (In a pleasing irony, the 2018 movie even ignores the previous sequel that ignored previous sequels.)\n\nThe most recent Terminator film is another example of this deliberately blinkered treatment of franchise history. Perhaps due to the return behind the scenes of series creator James Cameron, Terminator: Dark Fate (2019) acts as a sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement Day – the last one he wrote and directed. Films three, four and five, and the TV show, are discounted. Given how convoluted things had become, it was a wise move.\n\nEight bags of potato chips out of 10"
