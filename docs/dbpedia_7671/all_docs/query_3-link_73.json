        "text": "Post by agent817 on\n\nOkay, being a citizen of California, you would think that I would hate the man. Not the case. Sure, I didn't like his politics, but I sure as hell enjoy his movies. I still remember telling people that I went to go see The Expendables last year and everyone around me was all \"You're giving your money to Arnold.\" For one thing, he was only in one scene. Anyway, as for movies that I have enjoyed with him, I'll list them:\n\n-Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n\n-True Lies\n\n-Eraser\n\n-Kindergarten Cop\n\n-Batman & Robin (I know how bad that movie is, but if I watch it as a comedy, it's actually enjoyable, especially with Arnold's ice puns)\n\n-Red Heat\n\n-Jingle All The Way\n\n-The Running Man\n\n-Commando\n\nBy the way, these are in no particular order. There are some others that I haven't gotten around to watching. I have heard that Predator was a classic. I still want to watch Collateral Damage. I have heard that his Conan movies were enjoyable. I have heard mixed opinions about Raw Deal. I have seen Junior once and I thought it was sort of funny at times. I kind of liked End of Days, though I have a mixed opinion about the movie these days.\n\nWhich ones did you like?\n\nPost by eDemento2099 on\n\nArnie movies I love:\n\n- The Terminator\n\n- Terminator 2: Judgement Day\n\nArnie movies I like:\n\n- Total Recall (Great sci-fi film, even though it is one of the most disturbingly violent and gory non-horror films ever)\n\n- Jingle All The Way\n\n- Predator\n\n- Konnan the Barbarian (Yet another one of the most disturbingly violent and gory non-horror films in cinematic history)\n\n- Commando\n\n- Kindergarten Cop\n\n- Last Action Hero\n\nArnie movies I didn't like:\n\n- Eraser\n\n- Collateral Damage\n\n- End of Days\n\nThe Running Man is alright; I think its plot is better than its execution.\n\nAlthough I have yet to see it, I am VERY intrigued by the Tales from the Crypt episode that Arnie directed.\n\nPost by mattperiolat on\n\nI'm almost embarassed over a.) how much I like AH-nold and b.) how few of his movies I've seen.\n\nBasically, I have not seen a movie of AH-nold's that I dislike yet, with maybe ONE exception. Here we go:\n\nMy likes:\n\n- Terminator\n\n- Terminator 2\n\n- True Lies\n\n- Commando\n\n- Kindergarden Cop\n\nMy 'ehhhhs'\n\n- Batman and Robin\n\n- Jingle All The Way\n\nYes, I know, I want to and need to see more, especially Predator, Total Recall and Running Man.\n\nPost by Big DSR Energy on\n\nI love Schwarzenegger's movies! The TERMINATOR series (most of the love seems to go to T2, but the original is excellent as well), PREDATOR, KINDERGARTEN COP, TWINS (why am I the first one to bring up TWINS?!), CONAN...really, I've enjoyed everything I've seen him in. He gets a big thumbs up from me. ;D\n\nPost by Citizen Snips on\n\n@therealoblivion said:\n\nWhy does the first Terminator film rarely get any love? It was amazing.\n\nMy only explanation would be that it's a much darker film. There's really just this sense of menace and dread throughout the entire movie. In T2, you know Arnie's gonna save that little puke Edward Furlong and are just along for the awesome ride.\n\nIt's also slower-paced than T2. Not badly paced, mind you...just not as much balls to the wall action as T2.\n\nPost by Sephiroth on\n\nI actually liked Pumping Iron. The movie captured Arnold at his personal best, I think, because it showed him as what he genuinely seems to be: a charismatic and eternally ambitious man, but also an egomaniac who won't let anything get between him and what he wants. It also captured a spirit in bodybuilding that is long gone when the top competitors were actually friends who respected and admired each other, even in spite of all they did to beat each other.\n\nPost by Joker on\n\nArnie movies rock, apart from Junior and Sixth Day I probably like them all.\n\n@therealoblivion said:\n\nWhy does the first Terminator film rarely get any love? It was amazing.\n\nThe only thing wrong (Arnie Universe wise) with Terminator is that it is not your typical Arnie film, he's the villain, the film is very Sci-Fi-Noir in style and his lines are very few even though they are all classics. (Uzi 9mm, I'll be back, F*** you Asshole! and Are you Sarah Connor?)\n\nPost by Push R Truth on\n\nConan the Barbarian is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's got a mix of hard violence, good story, surprising acting, excellent imagery and one of the greatest soundtracks ever made.\n\nIf that music doesn't make you want to shoot up roids and hack people up with a sword, then you are just weird."
