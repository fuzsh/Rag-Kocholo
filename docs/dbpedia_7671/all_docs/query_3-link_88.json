        "text": "“Or better yet a terminator,\n\nLike Arnold Schwarzenegger”\n\nHouse of Pain – “Jump Around”\n\nWhen John Wayne died in 1979, many people figured that we would never see an actor like him ever again. When I say like him, I mean: a leading man’s man who more or less, no matter the movie’s time, place, or scenario, would portray the same character. It didn’t matter if the movie was a Western set in Monument Valley, or a WWII flick set in the Pacific, John Wayne played the character “John Wayne.” If the character’s name is not in the title, I bet you couldn’t name the name of a Wayne role.\n\nIt turns out that we didn’t have to wait long for the next John Wayne. The even bigger surprise was that he came to us via Thal, Austria.\n\nIf I were to guess why Arnold became the #1 box office action of the 1980’s, ahead of Stallone, Chuck Norris, Van Damme, etc, I would say it’s his charisma. If you ask me why he was even more successful in the 1990’s, while his competition faded away, I’d say it was his self-effacing sense of humor. His action films are well-known for his comedic one-liner catch phrases. Despite not being a native English speaker, he was still able to parlay that into many comedic roles. This is turn, gave him a cinematic second act. And based on both of our #10 picks, it seems he may have found himself a post-politics cinematic third act… as a serious dramatic actor.\n\nWith all that said, let’s “get to the chopper!”\n\nThe Top Ten Arnold Schwarzenegger films\n\nKeith’s List\n\n10.
