        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has delivered some of the most iconic performances ever committed to celluloid... so much so that we voted him to the IGN Action Hero Hall of Fame. From his unmistakable screen presence and dominating physique to his signature line delivery and sense of humor, Arnold has given us a ton of great films to choose from. As Sabotage prepares to hit theaters on March 28th, we figured we'd revisit our list of Arnold's best films. Tell us if you agree with our pics in the comments below!\n\n10 . Twins\n\nWhat if Arnold Schwarzenegger had a long-lost twin brother? What if that brother turned out to be Danny DeVito? That most unlikely of premises was the basis for this memorable comedy from director Ivan Reitman. Schwarzenegger and DeVito played fraternal twins who were experimented on in the womb and separated at birth.\n\nThe humor derives as much from the personality clashes as the physical disparity between brothers. Schwarzenegger's Julian is naively innocent and intelligent, raised in isolation to become the ideal human specimen. Meanwhile, DeVito's Vincent is gruff and streetwise. Twins offered a nice change of pace from Arnold's previously testosterone-fueled career and opened the doors for more comedic roles in the years to come.\n\n9 . Kindergarten Cop\n\nSchwarzenegger re-teamed with Reitman for another enjoyable comedy outing two years after Twins. The title is pretty self-explanatory. Schwarenegger plays John Kimble, an undercover police officer forced to take over as substitute teacher of a kindergarten class after his partner falls ill. It's pretty hard not to find humor in the idea of legendary tough guy Arnold Schwarzenegger fending off two dozen precocious children. The movie also gave us one of Arnold's all-time classic lines - “It's not a tumor!”\n\n8 . Commando\n\nBefore we had big, bombastic, “one man against the world” first-person shooters like Doom and Duke Nukem 3D, there was Commando. This movie is an '80s action fest at its most pure. Schwarzenegger plays Col. John Matrix, a retired Delta Force operative with a name too cool for civilian life. After his daughter is kidnapped by mercenaries, Matrix spends approximately 85% of the movie blowing up buildings, vehicles, and soldiers in his quest to rescue her. With plenty of explosions and memorable one-liners, Commando is classic Schwarzenegger.\n\n7 . The Running Man\n\nSchwarzenegger has the distinction of starring in one of the few worthwhile films to be based on a Stephen King novel. Arnold again played an ex-soldier, only in this case he was falsely convicted for participating in a massacre. His character is forced to compete in the reality TV series The Running Man, where contestants are forced to evade a group of “stalkers” in hopes of surviving and winning their freedom. In hindsight, the movie was surprisingly prescient about modern reality TV culture.\n\n6 . Total Recall\n\nForget about the recent remake and stick to the original. Paul Verhoeven directed this adaptation of Philip K. Dick's “We Can Remember It For You Wholesale.” Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who participates in a program called Rekall and discovers forgotten memories of his life as a secret agent. The futuristic action, memorable settings on Earth and Mars, and that infamous three-breasted prostitute all ensure that Total Recall is an action flick worth remembering.\n\n5 . True Lies\n\nTrue Lies is perhaps the last truly great Arnold Schwarzenegger film. It hit in 1994, shortly before Arnold's focus shifted more towards family-friendly comedies and politics. Here, he reunited again with director James Cameron and played a hero torn between his job as a super-spy and his family life. The film proved Arnold still had the goods 12 years after his Hollywood career kicked off, with a suitably absurd plot, big action sequences, and ample humor. We've rarely seen a movie villain dispatched in a more colorful or satisfying way.\n\n4 . Predator\n\nUsually, Arnold is the elite bad-ass who mows down scores of enemies without breaking a sweat. But in Predator, the hunter suddenly became the hunted. John McTiernan directed this 1987 action film that saw Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, and a handful of others navigate a treacherous Central American jungle while being stalked by an alien nemesis. Violent and creepy in equal measure, Predator set a standard that none of the sequels or spinoffs have really managed to live up to.\n\n3 . Conan the Barbarian\n\nOne of Arnold's first starring roles also remains one of his best. John Milius became the first director to adapt Robert E. Howard's pulp icon to film in 1982. Conan the Barbarian's faithfulness to the source material is sometimes questionable. Nonetheless, it offered fantasy-hungry audiences a taste of high adventure in the mythical Hyborian Age and their first glimpse of a soon-to-be superstar in all his muscled glory. James Earl Jones also proved he could deliver an imposing villain even outside of Darth Vader's armor. Conan the Barbarian had us all questioning “What is best in life?” Sadly, neither the sequel, Conan the Destroyer, nor the recent reboot recaptured the magic of Conan's first Hollywood outing.\n\n2 . The Terminator\n\nBetween his imposing size and deep, booming voice, we're surprised more movies haven't featured Arnold as the bad guy. But maybe that's because outdoing Terminator would be such a tall order. In this 1984 sci-fi/action flick from director James Cameron, Arnold played a remorseless cyborg sent back in time to murder Sarah Connor, destined to be mother to the eventual leader of the resistance. Whether he was slicing out his own eyeball or mowing through a precinct full of doomed cops, Arnold has never seemed more terrifying.\n\n1 . Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n\nSchwarzenegger and Cameron teamed again in 1991 for this sequel. Everything about Terminator 2 was bigger and better than the first. At the time, the revelation that Arnold's T-800 cyborg was now a hero instead of a villain was mind-boggling. Hounding the Connor family and their protector this time was Robert Patrick's T-1000, an invincible robot assassin made entirely of liquid metal. The movie's action sequences and special effects are still impressive even by today's standards, but Terminator 2 stays relevant because of its emotional resonance and musings on the nature of fate and free will.\n\nJesse is a writer for IGN Comics and IGN Movies.
