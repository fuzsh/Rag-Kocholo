        "text": "Batman and Robin\n\nWith Batman and Robin, the fourth entry in the recent Batman movie series, the profitable franchise appears poised to take a nosedive. This film, which places yet another actor in the batsuit, has all the necessary hallmarks of a sorry sequel...\n\nCollateral Damage\n\nOnce, Arnold Schwarzenegger strode across the screen like a god. Never an actor, but always an icon, Schwarzenegger's presence was so commanding that even his critics were forced to take notice. Part charisma, part swagger, he would blow into mul...\n\nConan the Barbarian\n\nKnow, O Prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of... Hither came Conan the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen eyed, sword in han...\n\nEraser\n\nThe release of Eraser begs the question: haven't there been enough action films already this summer? With the likes of Twister, Mission Impossible, The Phantom, Dragonheart, and The Rock floating around, do we really need Eraser?

That lovable band of washed-up '80s action heroes has returned in full glory for the third installment of Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables series. And, while some of the names have changed (bye, bye Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris;...\n\nJingle All the Way\n\nJingle All the Way represents Arnold Schwarzenegger's fourth attempt at a \"straight\" comedy (I'm not counting Last Action Hero or True Lies, which were highly action-oriented), and, like the others that came before it, this movie isn't all that fun...\n\nJunior\n\nThe new Ivan Reitman/Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy is a one-joke affair, and it takes surprisingly little time for the potential humor in the situation to wear thin.
