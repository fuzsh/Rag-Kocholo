        "text": "@irishx said:\n\n@wolverinebatmanftw: Right. I was clearly speaking to more what the OP wrote.... \"Meaning: Who’s closer to the iconic masculine action star, gymaholic, ladies’, and mans’s man, that Schwarzenegger embodied?\" So thank you for your opinion but I think the point went over your head.\n\nIt didn't go over my head. I understand what you're saying, but I do think guys like The Rock and Jason Momoa fit Arnold's mould better. They're more generically charming and handsome big guys. And physically, Tom Hardy isn't close. Normally, his physique is like a normal guy, and sometimes he bulks up for roles like Bane and Bronson, but he's not the type you see on a men's health magazine.\n\nAnd also, I think a key part of embodying Arnie's aura and mould would be the type of roles the actor takes on. Johnson is much more of a straight action man than Hardy. Hardy is a far more serious dramatic actor, and does a lot more eccentric roles.\n\nI mean, would you ever see Arnie or even Johnson looking like this?\n\nOr this?\n\nOr this?\n\nIt's an entirely different type of masculinity. It's eccentric, dark, brooding, almost creepy.\n\nArnold is really one of a kind, he exemplified masculine charisma in the 80's era. In the later 90's, he kind of went on a goofy binge, where he was clearly just in it for the paycheck but that's still vastly different from the Rock's goofy bodybuilder routine or Chris Hemsworth playing the occasional clueless dolt. In reality, there is no good comparison to Arnold in the modern era, because films today are a very different affair than they were in the late 20th century.\n\n@wolverinebatmanftw: TBH , I kind of agree with you about Dwayne and Arnie' acting abilities , now don't get me wrong both of them usually do a decent with what the scripts require them to do and are usually pretty entertaining to watch but The Rock and Arnold pretty much play the same character throughout their career . Now don't get me wrong , both of them manage to play their respective characters pretty decently and convincing but that's mostly due to their own respective charisma and charm . And when they do play a character that's unique compared to the rest in their filmography , those roles are usually nothing special or required broad acting abilities . They just need to know the basics of their characters and go along with it or maybe give those roles abit of fun dedication ( For example The Rock as that goof ball in the Jumanji sequels or as the tooth fairy and Arnie as the robotic Terminator ).However , I still gotta give those guys some respect because for people who did not intend or was ever properly trained to be an actor , It's impressive that they managed to build a huge career and gained massive popularity . And it's not like they're terrible either , they can do a good job if given the right roles.\n\nChris Hemsworth probably doesn't belong here.\n\nNo one can match the good old Dutch Shaefer from Predator, the Terminator role was amazing and epic too, but sincerely, nothing outclasses the good old Dutch.\n\nDutch is real inspiration, one sees a peak human, that is overwhelming physically strong, smart and tactical enough to match an alien race such as the Yautja, that is specialized in hunting uncountable of dangerous creatures across the galaxy, it's just mindblowing how he holds his ground.\n\nI loved the part when his squad massacred communist guerrillas somewhere in Guatemala, together with the Soviet agent, and in addition, you hear that he eliminated 7 terrorists at the Sudanese embassy in Berlin, Germany, my homeland, those symbolizing Western unity.\n\nIt's lovely, everything in a single packet, no one will ever be like him and equal Dutch Shaefer's role, the American elite and hero.\n\n@whathappened said:\n\nIsn't Arnold a miracle?\n\nBeyond that, in a metaphorical sense, no one will ever equal him. You know, I find his political views cringy and stupid, but I don't care in the slightest if he is a leftie or not, his cinematography career will always be unique, a person like that is born once in a millennium.\n\nWe were just lucky to be born at this time, tolerance about certain aspects towards this legend is obvious.\n\nDutch Shaefer and the Terminator are Demi-gods in the science-fiction and in the action genres.\n\nI especially root for Dutch Shaefer, he is so badass that he can't be more badass, he is so badass, the directors had to intensely work and introduce a dedicated and a badass cast that composed his crew in order to avoid being lame during the Predator film."
