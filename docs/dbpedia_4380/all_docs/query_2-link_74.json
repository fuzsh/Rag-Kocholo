        "text": "The Tilford House Estate\n\nThe hamlet of Tilford lies south of Farnham, and was formerly in that parish, at the confluence of the northern and southern branches of the Wey. The farms were small, and most of the land very sandy. Anne Ware, née Tayler, expressed in 1859 a landowner's view of a romantic yet strikingly unproductive landscape (1487/84/1, p39).\n\nTilford is a wayward Beauty\n\nWounding those who love her most.\n\nLabour on her as your duty,\n\nBut you'll find your labour lost -\n\nBeauteous is the rural village\n\nRich the woods, and clear the stream\n\nBright the heather, smooth the herbage\n\nLordly the Oak upon the Green -\n\nYet the soil is poor and sterile\n\nIll repairs the culturer's care\n\nPatches here and there are fertile\n\nBut the Heaths are wild and Rare -\n\nRock and sand and thorny Bushes\n\nWill destroy the seed you sow\n\nDisappoint your earnest wishes\n\nNothing there of good will grow -\n\nBlessed Lord, reclaim the waste land\n\nSend down thy refreshing rain\n\nThen shall grass grow o'er the dry sand\n\nAnd rich harvests glad the plain -\n\nIt was Anne who brought the Ware family to Tilford. Their estate and family papers comprise the bulk of this collection, with only a few records of earlier owners. Unfortunately not even all the early deeds of the estate are present. The conveyance to Miss Abney of the freehold parts of Chapel Farm (1775?; see 1487/4/4-8 and 1487/21/3) is missing, as is that of Tilford Cottage and some land formerly owned by Crawford Davison (1837?; see 1487/27 and 54). The greater part of the estate was, until well into the twentieth century, held as copyhold of the manor of Farnham.\n\nNo copies of court roll, apart from one (1487/1/16) survive before 1759, though there are a few, some apparently of property never part of the Tilford Estate, in the 1950 deposit. (The originals on the Bishop of Winchester's court roll of his manor of Farnham have not been examined.) These gaps in the documentation mean that the summary history of the estate that follows is necessarily tentative. Two early deeds lent for transcription in 1946 are not present (1487/68/14/3); they are described after 1487/1/2 and 1487/2/9, and transcripts exist (1487/68/14/6& 7).\n\nWhen Martin Ware II died on 10 Oct 1872 his estate in Tilford contained 654 acres, of which 282 comprised the 'settled estate', 85 the 'unsettled' land (ie acquired since the death of Thomas Tayler) and 286 were 13 allotments under the Tilford Inclosure of 1853. This fairly compact geographical unit surrounding Tilford Green had been built up over the previous 200 years.\n\nMost of the older part of the estate lay to the north of Tilford Green, west of the northern branch of the Wey. It included the freehold fields called Wenford or Wanford, close to Wanford, later Tilford, Mill Which had belonged to Waverley Abbey. These were tithe free, and the boundary of Waverley land is marked on the 1767 estate plan (1487/23/4). Among the copyholds were 'Bridgeland' at Tilford Green, so-called because the owner was responsible for the upkeep of a bridge (1487/6/7), and one yard of bondland called Elthams (1487/5/1), earlier Elvetham, Mead. Elvetham is a name that occurs in the bounds of Waverley. It appears that land north of Tilford, including the Wenford fields, which belonged in the second half of the 17th century to William Perrey, yeoman, and Robert Palmer, miller at Wenford Mill, came by marriage into the hands of Nicholas Turner of Farnham, mealman, and apparently a dissenter. (He died in 1713; his will is 1487/1/17)\n\nHis grandson John Turner was the builder of Tilford House, between 1725 (when he made his will, 1487/1/18) and 1731 (1487/1/19), very probably in 1727-8 since in 1728 he moved up to first place from almost the end of the list of people in Tilford assessed to the Farnham Poor Rate. The estate inherited by John Turner from his grandfather - 'all my houses and land, freehold and copyhold, in Tilford, Waverley, Frensham, Coldpitt land' - included more than was sold by his co-heirs in 1731 to Peter Green of Walthamstow, Essex (1487/1/19& 20).\n\nAfter several mortgages (1487/3/1-7) Peter Green sold in 1761 to Elizabeth Abney of Stoke Newington, spinster, for £4,000 (1487/3/9). She also bought the contents of the house, and an inventory in 1760 shows that Peter Green had furnished it in style (1487/3/6 and 9). Miss Abney was the only surviving child of Sir Thomas Abney, Lord Mayor of London in 1700, and his second wife Mary Gunston. She was a noted nonconformist, and obtained a licence for nonconformists to worship in Tilford House (see below).\n\nIn a plan of the estate in 1767 (1487/23/4) made by George Cobbett and John Jarrett it then contained 185 acres. Miss Abney enlarged it by purchasing from Thomas Matchwick the 79 acre farm lying east of Tilford Green and later called Chapel Farm (19th cent.) or Bridge Farm (20th cent.) (1487/4/8 and 1487/21/3). This purchase united the part of the estate round Tilford Green with the Widmore and Charles Hill Moors further down the river towards Elstead. The mapmakers of 1767 made a plan of this additional farm in 1776 (1487/23/6). Miss Abney evidently also made improvements: a new pond between Abbots Pond and Stockbridge Pond was built (1487/4/10) and a new walk beside the coppices along the Wey is shown on the 1776 plan.\n\nElizabeth Abney's heir was the nonconformist Minister Thomas Tayler who had been her chaplain (see below). He seems to have lived at Tilford only in the early years after he acquired the estate (see below). He left his house and lands at Tilford, with another farm and cottages, to his daughter Anne, wife of Martin Ware, and her heirs (1487/5/3). The farms in Ash bought by Peter Green (1487/2/8& 11) were bequeathed by Thomas Tayler to his daughter Mary, and ceased to be part of the Tilford Estate. On Thomas Tayler's death in 1831 Dr Martin Ware II a 'surgeon oculist' and his family spend three summers in the house, but thereafter leased it, keeping Tilford Cottage for their own occasional use. An estate plan of 1835 (1487/23/9) covers 260 acres. The estate more than doubled in size during this Martin Ware's lifetime.\n\nIn addition to the 286 acres added by the 13 allotments of waste land made under the Tilford Inclosure, he bought from Crawford Davison in 1837 some fields which intruded into his own estate on the north west (1487/27) and in 1839 Malthouse and Bridgeland Farms (close to Tilford House) and Mayes and/or Mansell's Farm (1487/6/16). In 1851 he acquired Higher Reed and Hopground Reed, with a hop kiln (1487/8/12), a cottage near Abbot's Pond soon after (1487/9/4), and a cottage on Tilford Common in 1863 (1487/11/4, and plan 1487/23/12).\n\nUnder the testamentary division of Martin Ware's estate (1487/12) his eldest son James Tayler Ware became the owner of the Tilford Estate. On the death of J T Ware in 1902 his nephew the Rev Martin S Ware inherited. Between 1903 and 1946 many plots on the heathy land to the north and south of Tilford Green (parts of the Inclosure allotments) were sold for building (1487/20-38). In Sep 1949 the major part of the 'Tilford House Estate' of about 630 acres was put up for auction, including 'two useful dairy farms' (Tilford House Farm and Bridge Farm), an 'old world cottage residence' (Tilford Cottage), and fifteen other cottages, but excluding Tilford House (see 1384/15/2).\n\nTilford House\n\nThe builder - if it was indeed John Turner of Farnham, gentleman - had inherited from his grandfather money made in the flourishing Farnham corn trade described by Defoe. His father Stephen (who died before Nicholas Turner the grandfather) was a pewterer, and one of his sisters was married to William Paradice, goldsmith. Mrs Paradice was living at Tilford House in 1731 (rate book). A list of occupants of Tilford House from 1725 at the end of this section is derived from Farnham parish assessments books, Land Tax returns and letters and papers in this collection. The inventory of 1761 names the contents of the house, room by room. Plans of the three floors made about 1900 (1487/23/16) show the position of pieces of furniture at that time. Between these two dates bills for work give details of repairs carried out. The most important addition was that made by Miss Abney, when she built the chapel in the courtyard of the house. This was in 1776 (according to 1487/69/1 this date is cut into a brick). Extensive alterations took place in 1852 when the Ware family returned to live in the house (148755/-).\n\nCorrespondence surviving from 1835 includes letters from the occupiers of the house and there are many comments on life at Tilford. Dr Burden explained in 1836 that he must give up the tenancy because 'a somewhat liberal income' was needed for keeping house and land in good order, 'promoting the temporal and spiritual good of the Tilford poor', paying the expenses of both chapels, and 'maintaining the tone of good order and respectability which this house should ever give to the village'. 'I must maintain a consistent appearance, giving liberally, and acting as a gentleman is expected to act' (1487/26/5& 6).\n\nChapels at Tilford\n\nIn 1761 Elizabeth Abney obtained a licence from the Bishop of Winchester permitting a congregation of Independents to worship in her house. This congregation included several of the farmers at Tilford, among them William Maunsell and Henry Wheeler (1487/22).\n\nThe chapel built in 1776 in the courtyard of the house was for the same congregation. This chapel continued to be used by dissenters until about 1825 (1487/69/1) when the chapel on the green was built, in connection with the Surrey Mission, for congregational services (see plan in 1487/1/17).\n\nAccording to one of his grandchildren Thomas Tayler was approached by Bishop Sumner soon after 1827 and agreed to allow Church of England services to take place in the chapel in the courtyard. The Reverend Frederick Stevens of Seale came to take the services. The same source (1487/69/1) states that:\n\n'The services were at each chapel alternatively morning and afternoon. They did not clash because when the morning service was at the Chapel at the House, the afternoon service was at the Chapel on the Green and vice versa. Mr Emmett, the tenant of the Chapel Farm officiated as clerk at both places and set the tunes. Others attended both places as Mr Harris, the tenant of the farm next the house and his family - and the Stovolds of Till Hill. Mr and Mrs Nicholson of Waverley and their families attended at the Chapel in the Yard - though Mr and Mrs N were said to be Unitarians. She was the daughter of Mr Smith of Norwich a well known Unitarian.'\n\nA plan shows the arrangement of the pews, altar and pulpit at this time, when the Wares first lived at Tilford. Repairs at both chapels were, as we have seen, the responsibility of the occupier of Tilford House (see for example, 1487/26/11). The chapel in the courtyard was apparently not used after 1842 (Ware papers in Tilford parish records, 1975/-), though the possibility of again using it, rather than building a new church, remained a matter of discussion until the 1860s. The Chapel on the Green continued in use, though not apparently continuously, until 1891 (1487/17/1 and Ware papers in Tilford parish records, 1975/-). The chapel site was then exchanged for the land on which, in 1893-4, Mrs Anderson of Waverley built Tilford Institute (see 1487/69/1).\n\nTilford Church\n\nThe building of an Anglican church (or 'chapel') at Tilford had been proposed at least by 1846 (letter of G J Nicholson, 19 Apr 1846, in Ware papers in Tilford parish records, 1975/-). A site was set aside in the Tilford Inclosure (1487/33), subscriptions were being collected in 1865 (see 1975/-), and the church consecrated in 1867. A parsonage house and school soon followed, all heavily indebted to the Ware family. Curates serving the Anglican chapel in Tilford House had lived in Tilford Cottage.\n\nEstate Management\n\nCorrespondence exchanged between the Wares and their managers, tenants and neighbours during the 19th century contains frequent references to the best way of farming the land (see for example 1487/30, 32, 40 and 46). There are also papers concerned with timber, including a complete list of all timber on the estate in 1836 (1487/25/2). The letters, together with valuations (1487/25) at various dates and bills for erecting or repairing buildings (1487/53-61) provide a detailed picture of this small estate under the Wares, particularly between 1835 and 1860. Even during the period when J T Ware was living at Tilford and himself involved in the day to day management of the estate, (apparently from c.1852-1884, see 1487/69/1) there appears to have been an agent or bailiff.\n\nList of occupants of Tilford House, 1725-1752 and 1782-1919\n\nCharlotte Smith, the author, is stated to have lived in the house during 1805-06. She perhaps stayed for too short a time to appear in these records. The information below is derived from Farnham parish assessment books for the tithing of Tilford (which are absent between 1753 and 1781), land tax returns, or documents in this collection, whose references are noted below.\n\n1728-1730 Mr John Turner\n\n1731 Mrs Paradice or tenant\n\n1732-1752 Mr Peter Green\n\n1782 Mrs Abney\n\n1782-1783 Executors of Mrs Abney\n\n1784-1789 Rev Mr Taylor [Tayler]\n\n1789-1793 Captain Everett (or Thomas Everett Esq)\n\n1794-1795 'The most noble the Marquis of Lothian'\n\n1795-1798 Mrs Hamilton\n\n1799-1805 Mrs Monro\n\n1806-1807 Late Mrs Monro\n\n1808-1812 Charles Forster Esq\n\n1813-1821 Charles Davidson Esq [Crawford Davison?]\n\n1822 Rev Mr Taylor ?\n\n1823-1825 ?\n\n1825-1832 Crawford Davison Esq (1487/5/6)\n\n1832-1834 Ware family (1487/108/2)\n\n1834-1837 or 1838 Dr Thomas Burden (brother-in-law of Mrs Ware's sister) (1487/26)\n\n1839-1848 Edward Franklyn, a Major in the Madras Army, and Mrs Franklyn (1487/24/4)\n\n1849-1852 Mrs Fanny Crespigny Franklyn (1487/24/9)\n\n1852-? Mr and Mrs Martin Ware (1487/24/11)\n\n18??-1902 J T Ware\n\n1902-1919 Rev M S Ware\n\nThe Tayler and Ware Families\n\nOutline biographies of Thomas Tayler and certain members of the Ware family are given at the end of this introduction.\n\nWhen the Reverend Thomas Tayler inherited the Tilford estate from Elizabeth Abney he was Minister of Carter Lane Presbyterian Church in London. He had trained at Dr Doddridge's Academy and became Miss Abney's personal chaplain in the late 1750s. Only two of the small number of Tayler's letters in the collection date from his time as chaplain, the majority being written to his daughters Anne and Mary between 1800 and 1813. The children were apparently staying with friends and relations during this time, as they had been sent away for their upbringing after the death of their mother in 1800 (1487/74/14).\n\nIn 1816 Anne Tayler married Martin Ware, the son of the eminent oculist James Ware FRS of New Bridge Street, London. Most of the male members of the Ware family were professional people, Anne's husband Martin being a surgeon oculist who had a joint medical practice with his brother John. Two of Martin's other brothers were clergymen and the third was a merchant (1487/69/2). All but one of Anne's children entered a profession. Very little detail of their professional activities, however, can be gained from the personal letters, papers and diaries in the collection. The one notable exception is James Ware FRS who kept journals while he was a medical student in London in the 1770s. In these he gives details of lectures and operations attended, the payments for parts of bodies for dissection and his activities as a working pupil at St Thomas's Hospital, 1775-1777. There is also a statement of his income from his partnership with Jonathan Wathen between 1778 and 1789 (1487/80/1). James's journals also give details of his social life while a medical student in late 18th century London, including trips to the theatre, and disputing houses, and taking tea with friends (1487/103/1-2).\n\nAn impression of the private life of Anne and her husband, and of her son Martin III and his wife Mary, can be gained from their letters and diaries and those of their children. The letters from Anne Ware to her son Martin III for the period 1831-1841 (1487/85/4-40) and Martin III and Mary Ware's memoirs (1487/106 and 107/2) are especially useful.\n\nIt is evident from material in the collection and from their involvement with Christian and philanthropic societies that both the Tayler and Ware families were devoutly Christian. Reverend Thomas Tayler and his daughter Anne were dissenters but it does not seem that the Wares were of one particular denomination.\n\nIn his journals, James Ware FRS mentions going to several types of churches and of his children, two were Anglican clergymen and his son Martin married a dissenter (Anne Tayler) and had at least one of his children baptised by a dissenting minister (Martin III). The later Wares including Martin III seemed mainly to attend Anglican churches but as has been said denominational loyalty was not strictly adhered to when at Tilford. Their commitment to their Christian principles is especially to be seen in the papers of Thomas Tayler, his daughter Anne and Martin Ware II and III. It is most obvious, perhaps, in those letters giving instruction on conduct to their children (eg 1487/74/14, 1487/83/1, 1487/85/1-3, 1487/90/24) and in the spiritual reflections of Martin II (1487/104-105).\n\nPhilanthropic Work\n\nIt seems that most of the members of the Ware family who are represented in the collection were involved to some extent in philanthropic work. The outline biographies list some of their connections with charitable societies but little further detail of their activities is available from the collection. The memoirs of Martin III, however, do give some idea of his Social Sciences Association and the British and Foreign Bible Society (1487/106).\n\nThe collection contains a number of letters sent to Martin Ware and others by former ragged boys, who had been helped by Ware (1487/119-177). Some of them were by then serving in the forces or the Marine Society and others had emigrated. Martin III began working in Ragged Schools in 1846 when he joined the committee of the school in Compton Place, (later Brunswick Buildings), Brunswick Square, London. He later became Superintendent of the Sunday School there.\n\nTwo of his brothers were also involved. Charles worked at the St Giles School and Joseph helped out while he was at Russell Square. In 1849 Martin was asked to join the committee of the Ragged School Union and remained a member until his marriage in 1867. Ware mentions in his memoirs that he visited many of the parents of the children in the school and that he helped some of the juvenile criminals into the Navy and Industrial Schools (1487/106/1). No details are given in the memoirs but he kept a journal of his activities at Compton Place School and among the families living in the King's Cross and Cromer Street area, which included a number of Irish immigrants. (See 1585/- for the surviving volumes of this journal).\n\nHis chief aim in helping the children appears to have been to get them into steady employment and it was for this reason that the Ragged School Shoe Black Society (RSSBS) was formed by Ware, John MacGregor and others in 1851. Boys were sent by the schools to the Society's offices in Off Alley, off the Strand, and if they were accepted they were sent out to black shoes in the streets of London. The boys were allowed to keep part of their earnings, and the rest went into their 'Bank' and was used to support the Society. (See 'The Story of the Shoeblack Brigade' by John MacGregor in Home Words Jan 1882). Boys were also entered in the Marine Society, the forces or given places in Industrial Schools where they were employed in wood chopping, or shoeblacking in gentlemen's houses. Ware and his friend J H Fordham [grandson of Sir John Gurney] assisted in establishing an industrial school in Britannia Street, this later had a dormitory where homeless boys could lodge. The school later moved to Grays Inn Road and was eventually amalgamated with the Working Boys Home in Kensington.\n\nEmigration seems to have been a last resort for relief. The money for the emigrant's passage, clothes and often their indentures was apparently supplied by individuals or the Ragged School Union and appears to have been given only to the most destitute but this may not have been so in every case. Some emigrants seemed to make new lives in the colonies, such as Michael Murphy (1487/145) and the Restieux family (1487/153-156) but others returned after a short time. It is not always possible to follow the lives of the letter writers closely as there are gaps in the journal and it ends in 1867. Those details that are available have been summarised in the list.\n\nOutline biographies of Reverend Thomas Tayler and members of the Ware family.\n\nOnly biographies of certain members of the Ware family are given. The biographies have been compiled from items in the collection and a number of reference works. They are not exhaustive and it has not been possible to check the details. The list of sources used is given below and the information taken from them is indicated by the relevant number in brackets after a statement or series of statements in the text.\n\nSources:\n\n(1) Notebook of Henry Ware, 1487/69/2\n\n(2) 'Memorandum concerning myself and Family' [James Ware], 1487/80/2\n\n(3) 'Brief Account of his life by Reverend James Ware ......
