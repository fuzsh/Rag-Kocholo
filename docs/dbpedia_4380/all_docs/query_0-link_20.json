In the House of Commons the chancellor of the exchequer,\n\n|nee Bennett],\n\ntax resister,\n\nwas born on\n\nSquare, Leicester,\n\nSarah Annie Swain. She qualified as a doctor, graduating\n\nMB\n\nin\n\n1894 and\n\nMD\n\nthe following year, and in 1896\n\nreceived the degree of bachelor of surgery, also from the\n\nUniversity of London. She practised in the East\n\ndon\n\nmany\n\nEnd of Lon-\n\nOn\n\nliable to indefinite\n\nover which he\n\nis\n\n(\n\n1912, 10). For the\n\n30 July 1894 she married Mark Wilks, a teacher at a London county council school; and\n\nLloyd George, pointed out that changes in the law would\n\nthey had one adopted daughter, Helen.\n\nsider\n\nfor\n\nyears.\n\nAs part of the Edwardian campaign to obtain the vote women Elizabeth Wilks resisted payment of income\n\nfor\n\nan action which ultimately resulted in her husband’s imprisonment in 1912. She was a founder member and treasurer of the Women’s Tax Resistance League, a suffragist organization whose aim was to refuse taxation until such time as women were enfranchised on the same terms as men. Established in 1909, the league drew on historic precedents of tax refusal on the principle that taxation without representation was unconstitutional, tax,\n\nadopting the rallying cry of ‘No Vote At the time\n\n— despite\n\nNo Tax!’ (Parkes, 39). Women’s Property\n\nthe Married\n\nActs of 1870, 1874, and 1882\n\n— a married woman was not\n\nlegally liable for income tax.\n\nUnder the Income Tax Acts of\n\n1848 the separate incomes of husband and wife were\n\naggregated and treated as one; any rebates were automatically\n\npaid to the husband. The wife was legally bound nei-\n\nther to pay income tax nor to disclose her income to her\n\nhusband. Elizabeth and Mark Wilks exploited this anomaly during a four-year protest which confused the authorities\n\nand created publicity for the suffrage cause.\n\n— that\n\nis,\n\nher property was\n\nseized in lieu of the tax payment. This was against the law since the tax\n\nwas due from her husband. The Board of\n\nInland Revenue then tried to claim the tax from both of\n\nthem\n\nor from\n\nfor a tax\n\nMark Wilks\n\nalone, thus holding\n\non property which did not belong\n\nhim\n\nliable\n\nto him.\n\nHe\n\nrefused to pay. As a teacher employed by the London\n\ncounty council at Dalgleish Street School, Stepney, he earned considerably less than his wife, whose income\n\nfrom her medical practice was about £600 a year. After a tortuous legal battle with the Board of Inland Revenue, Mark Wilks was imprisoned in Brixton gaol. Protest demonstrations were held in Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park, and over 3000 London teachers signed a petition objecting to his treatment. The case attracted a good deal of publicity in the national and provincial press, Elizabeth Wilks was very unpopular in some quarters, and the incongruous tax situation provided excellent publicity for the campaign for women’s emancipation. Technically, Mark Wilks could have been held in gaol for an indefinite period until the debt was paid. However, he was released after two weeks and the couple were feted by suffrage campaigners for their stand for equal rights.\n\nThe case was debated\n\nHouse of Lords, where\n\nEarl\n\nRussell argued that a state of law, ‘which rendered a\n\nman\n\nin the\n\namending\n\nit\n\n(\n\nHansard 5 C, 42,\n\n1912).\n\nwere not changed then, and a law permitting wives to have their earned income assessed separately for taxation purposes was not introduced until 1972. The Wilks’ daughter, Helen, died in 1919, and in 1923 the couple moved to Openlands, Furze Vale Road, Headley Down, Hampshire. In 1932 Elizabeth Wilks became concerned by the poor condition of the local housing stock, and in 1933 she set up the Headley Public Utility Society, which built sixteen new cottages for families in urgent need of rehousing. Elizabeth Wilks died at Openlands at the age of ninety-five on 16 November 1956, her husband having predeceased her. In her will she left Openlands to house a needy local person, and a 10 acre nature reserve; both are in the care of the Headley Public Utility Society.

His administration was firm and enlightened, and he was popular. He improved agriculture by introducing better methods of cultivation, and by persuading the East India Company to alter the land tenure system. He Was promoted brevet colonel on 4 June 1814. He was described as, in 1815, ‘a tall, handsome, venerable-looking man, with white curling locks and a courtier-like manner’ (Corbett, 5).

He was educated at Malvern College and worked for the Hillman Motor Car Company in Coventry from 1922 to 1926, before spending two years\n\nhis brother,\n\nSpencer Bernau ’Wilks (1891-1971),\n\nwho\n\nbecame managing director in 1934. The Wilks brothers were largely responsible for the decision to produce only high-quality luxury cars at a time when Rover was in severe financial difficulties, and played an important part in re-establishing the reputation of Rover in the 1930s. Wilks married Barbara Forrest, daughter of William Martin-Hurst, journalist, on 29 May 1937. They had three\n\nsons.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of war, before Coventiy was in November 1940, Rover moved to two sites, at Acocks Green and Solihull, as part of the Air Ministry’s ‘shadow factory’ scheme to involve motor-car manufacturing firms in the production of aeroplane engines. Maurice Wilks headed the Rover jet engineering team, which was asked by the Air Ministry in 1940 to develop Whittle’s gas-turbine engine to production state, and then\n\nbombed\n\nmanufacture it for use by the RAF in Gloster aircraft, at a rate of 2000 a year from 1943. The team moved to Waterloo Mill in Clitheroe, Lancashire, in 1941, and although Wilks worked on the project for two years, disagreements and worsening relations between the Rover management and Whittle and his team at Power Jets, over improvements made by Wilks to the design in order to simplify production and speed up development, delayed the project; very few Whittle engines had been made by 1943, when Rover handed the work to Rolls-Royce Ltd in exchange for a project to develop a new tank engine for the army, and withdrew completely from the jet-engine development programme. However, as a result of this project, and work at the same time on his own version of the jet engine, the B26, Wilks became convinced that the gasturbine engine could also be suitable as the power unit for wheeled vehicles, and Rover continued to work on this at Solihull after the war, producing the first gas-turbine car in 1949. Wilks remained at Waterloo Mill, working on the V12 Meteor tank engine, for the rest of the war. In 1946 Wilks became technical director for Rover. The company was in difficulties after the war because steel quotas were allocated by the government on the basis of a company’s export sales, and the Rover luxury cars did not sell\n\nwell overseas. Faced with an allocation of steel\n\nfor only 1100 cars, instead of the 20,000 planned annual output. Rover needed a short-term project to keep the production lines running at Solihull, where Rover car production was now based, until the return of normal\n\nenough\n\ntrading conditions. This led in 1947 to the development of\n\nthe Land Rover, based on the American jeep, by Wilks and his design team. Launched in 1948, the Land Rover, a small\n\nfour-wheel drive vehicle, was originally intended as a\n\nfarm vehicle, to be more versatile than a jeep. An immediate success, used as much on the road as off it, it sold better than the Rover luxury cars: between 1948 and 1958 the company sold 200,000 Land Rovers, over 70 per cent for export. In 1950 Wilks began to develop a long wheelbase Land Rover, and in 1952 he had the idea for what was to\n\nWILKS, ROBERT\n\n4\n\nappear as the Range Rover in 1968. The Land Rover saved the company, and turned Rover primarily into a manufacturer of light commercial vehicles.\n\nWilks was joint managing director of Rover from 1956, managing director from i960 to 1962, and chairman from 1962 until his death at his farm, Tros-yr-afon, Panton, Newborough, Anglesey, on 8 September 1963. He was survived by his wife. A man of great personal modesty, he was regarded as one of the outstanding engineers in the car Anne Pimlott Baker industry. sole\n\nSources\n\nD.\n\nS.\n\nBrooks, Vikings at Waterloo: the wartime work on the\n\nCompany\n\nWhittle jet engine by the Rover\n\n‘Wilks, Spencer Bemau’,\n\nDBB\n\n•\n\n(1997)\n\n•\n\nJ.\n\nForeman-Peck.\n\nG.

W. R. Chetwood, in his General History in 1749, says the family came from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, and that Robert’s grandfather and great-uncle both served Charles I during the civil war. Robert Wilks received a good education, and at the age of eighteen, being a remarkable penman, he became a clerk in the office of secretary Sir Robert Southwell.\n\nOn\n\nthe outbreak of the war in Ireland he was compelled to join the\n\narmy of King William,\n\nbut, being appointed clerk\n\ncamp, took no part in active conflict. After rejoining his office he became acquainted with Richards, a comedian. He appeared privately in John Dryden's The Spanish Fryar, as Colonel Pedro, and made his public debut under Joseph Ashbury at the Smock Alley Theatre in December 1691 as Othello. As a consequence of the war there was no regular company at Smock Alley, and the performance (which was to commemorate the defeat of the Stuart cause in Ireland, and to which the public were admitted gratis) was conducted by amateurs, principally officers. Wilks’s performance was so successful that it made him decide to become an actor. He remained at Smock Alley, now established as a theatre, for two years. In 1693 Wilks visited London and was engaged by Christopher Rich at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The only part traced to him there is Lysippus in Beaumont’s and Fletcher’s The Maid’s Tragedy. In moving to England he took a 50 per cent pay cut; under Ashbury he earned 30s. weekly, whereas under Rich he received only 15s., out of which he had to pay 2s. 6 d. to be taught dancing. It was in London that Wilks met Elizabeth, the youngest daughter of Ferdinando Knapton, town clerk of Southampton and steward of the New Forest in Hampshire; her elder sister Sarah married Henry 'Norris. Robert and Elizabeth married in 1693 and had five children— a son and four daughto the\n\nters\n\n—\n\nall\n\nbut one of whom, Frances, died in infancy.\n\nSome time in 1698 Wilks, together with his wife and presumably his daughter Frances (bap. 15 Oct 1695), returned to Dublin. There he did very well, playing parts such as Sir Frederick Frolic in Comical Revenge, in She Would all\n\nif\n\nor,\n\nLove in a Tub, Courtall\n\nand Dorimant\n\nShe Could,\n\nby George Etherege.\n\nreturn to London in the\n\nWhen\n\nin The\n\nthe family\n\nautumn of\n\nMan of Mode,\n\nleft\n\nDublin to\n\n1698, or so the story\n\nhad become so popular that he had to make an duke of Ormond, having issued a warrant to prevent him leaving the kingdom. Wilks’s first discovered performance date after returning to London is 28 November 1699 at the Drury Lane Theatre, where he played Sir Harry Wildair in George Farquhar’s The Constant Couple. The play was a great success, and Sir Harry was the role with which Wilks remained associated throughout his life; it was a part that, to quote Kitty Clive, gave him his teenage image of ‘idol of pretty young things’ (Highfill, Bumim & Langhans, BDA). Farquhar, an actor and playwright, had returned from Dublin with Wilks. Apart from having a professional relationship, they were close friends all their lives; after his death Farquhar even entrusted his daughters to Wilks. By 1702 Wilks, through admirable industry, had recommended himself to the Drury Lane manager Christopher Rich despite the fact that he was at odds with the actor and director of rehearsals, George Powell. The main reason for this was that Powell and Wilks were after the same kind of roles. Powell eventually recognized Wilks’s talent and left for Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Rich then put Wilks in charge of rehearsals. Wilks was also a singer. On 8 April 1706 he sang goes, Wilks\n\nescape, James Butler, second\n\nin Farquhar's The Recruiting Officer (as\n\nCaptain Plume).\n\nIt is\n\nalso possible that he sang at his special benefit concert at\n\nYork Buildings on 17 March 1703. Following a financial row in which Rich was accused of taking a third of the actors’ benefit, a detachment of play-\n\nwhom was Wilks, moved to new Queen’s Theatre at the Haymarket, which had been opened by Owen Swiny on 15 October 1706. Drury\n\ners\n\nfrom Drury Lane, among\n\nthe\n\nLane, having lost most of\n\nperforming\n\nits\n\nleading players, focused on\n\nItalian operas. at the Haymarket, where Wales in Henry IV, HamMacduff, Lorenzo in The Spanish\n\nWilks remained for two years\n\nhis parts included the Prince of\n\n1\n\nAntony in Julius Caesar, Fryar, Dorimant in The Man of Mode, Jupiter in Dryden’s Amphitryon, and Cortez in his The Indian Empress. Among the characters he originated were Palamede in Dryden’s Marriage a la mode on 4 February 1707 and Archer in Farquhar’s The Beaux’ Stratagem on 8 March. The theatre then being devoted to opera acoustics had proved less than ideal at Drury Lane he reappeared as Hamlet at Drury Lane on 15 January 1708. let,\n\n—\n\n—\n\nIn 1709 Wilks, together with Colley Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Anne Oldfield, joined Swiny in the manage-\n\nment of the Haymarket. The house opened on 20 SeptemThomas Betterton as Hamlet. In 1710 the com-\n\nber with\n\npanies reunited at Drury Lane.\n\nseason Swiny\n\nWhen\n\nafter the 1710-11\n\nto the Queen’s Theatre, Wilks,\n\nand Doggett became joint managers of Drury Under this so-called triumvirate— Mrs Oldfield\n\nCibber,\n\nLane.\n\nmoved\n\nWILKS, ROBERT\n\n5 never became a shareholder, as Doggett objected to having ‘more than one sex admitted to the management’ (Cibber, 208)\n\nhow\n\n— Drury Lane flourished.\n\nHighfill\n\nmentions\n\n‘during the early 1710s the shares of Wilks, Cibber,\n\nand Doggett never came to less than £1000 per year each up to the end of the reign of Queen Anne in 1714’ (Highfill, Burnim & Langhans, BDA, 116). The three actor-managers had very different characters. If Cibber’s Apology is to be believed, Wilks was hard-working but vain, Doggett was stubborn and difficult, and Cibber himself was the sensible moderator. It may well have been the peculiar combination of characters that held the three together. In\n\nNovember 1713 Doggett was replaced by Barton Booth, but the\n\nnew\n\ntriumvirate remained strong. Life as an actor-\n\nmanager was busy and often stressful. All three managers attended rehearsals of two to three hours in the mornings, and they saw every performance in which they did not act. They attended rehearsals of new plays, had to oversee all kinds of purchases, and watched that those employees handling money did not defraud the troupe.\n\nAmong the many parts Wilks played as an actor-manager were Othello and Henry VI in Richard III. When Swiny left Drury Lane in 1711 he was succeeded by William Collier, who in 1714 was replaced by Richard Steele. Although he played little or no part in active management, Steele procured a new licence and eventually patent (19 January 1715), which subsequently became a highly valued property. After Steele’s death in 1729 the\n\nwas granted to Cibber, Wilks, and Booth, empowering them to present plays at Drury Lane for a period of twenty-one years from 1 September 1732. Wilks stayed at Drury Lane until close upon his death. In 1713 he was Chaucer in John Gay’s The Wife of Bath and in 1717 Heartly in Cibber’s The Non-Juror. He had also been seen as patent\n\nFerdinand in The Tempest. Wilks’s\n\nThomas\n\nnew\n\nparts at Drury Lane included Bellamar in\n\nKilligrew’s\n\nChit-Chat\n\non 14 February\n\n1719,\n\nEurythion in Thomas Southeme’s The Spartan Dame on\n\n11\n\nDecember 1719, Frankly in Cibber’s The Refusal on 14 February 1721, Antony in his Caesar in Egypt on 9 December 1724, Lord Townly in Cibber and Vanbrugh’s The Provoked Husband on 10 January 1728, and Merital in Henry Fielding’s Love in Several Masques on 16 February 1728. He also played Mirabell in William Congreve’s The Way of the World, the Prince of Wales in\n\n2\n\nHenry IV, the title part in John Dryden’s\n\nBuckingham\n\nand Hastings in Richard III. His last recorded character was Bellamant in Fielding’s The Modern Husband, on 21 February 1732. Avery,\n\nAureng-Zebe,\n\nin Henry\n\nVIII,\n\ntalcing 1721-2 as a fairly typical season, notes that\n\nWilks\n\nacted at least 140 times in addition to his participation in the management. Considering the heavy acting schedule that he carried season after season\n\nit is not surprising to hear reports of his frayed temper as a manager. But\n\nCibber’s reports are coloured.\n\nrecords a single excursion to Bartholomew fair, during which he played Antonio in the droll Maudlin for William Pinkethman, Joe Miller, and Henry Norris (but this may have been William Wilks the younger, his nephew). He also\n\nappeared privately as a professional performer\n\n(alongside Betterton, Booth, Elizabet h Barry, girdle,\n\nand Mrs\n\nAnne\n\nOldfield) at Richard Norton’s\n\nSouthwick, near Portsmouth, in the\n\nBrace-\n\nhouse\n\nat\n\nsummer of 1707-8.\n\nWilks died at his house in Bow Street, Covent Garden, on 27 September 1732, and was buried at midnight (at his own request) on 4 October at St Paul’s, Covent Garden. A prologue to his memory was spoken at Drury Lane on 14 October. His wife had died on 21 March 1714, and was buried in St Paul’s, where her husband raised a monument to her memoiy. Robert Wilks had married again, on 26 April 1715. His second wife, Mary Fell, nee Brown d 1740), a widow with four children living, survived him. Throughout his career Wilks was well paid, earning as much as £753 6s. 8d. for acting and serving as co-manager, and his clear benefit brought him £60. Yet at his death he had squandered most of his wealth, and his widow was left with little more than his share in the patent. She appointed the portrait painter John Ellys her representative. Wilks enjoyed acting on a daily basis. Booth mentions how the exercise ‘kept the spirits in motion, and always gave him a good Stomach’. Steele compares Wilks and Cibber, saying how they were ‘perfect actors in their different kinds. Wilks has a singular talent in representing (\n\nthe graces of nature: Cibber the deformity in the affectation of them’ (Highfill, Burnim & Langhans, BDA). Although Wilks’s tragic creations were praised for sorrow, tenderness, and resignation, his greatest triumphs were all in comedy, and particularly in the comedy of Farquhar. His chief characteristics as a comedian were ease, sprightliness, and a distinction of manner, which caused him to be accepted as a model of behaviour in fashionable society. One of his most popular characters from Shakespeare was Prince Hal in Henry IV, but little is written about it. Davies, in his Dramatic Miscellanies (1784), called Wilks’s\n\nHal in 1 Henry IV ‘one of the most perfect exhibitions of the theatre’.
