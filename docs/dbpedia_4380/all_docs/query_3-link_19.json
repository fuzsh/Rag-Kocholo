        "text": "Eights and Alumni Dinner\n\nOur annual Eights Dinner was, as ever, a very enjoyable way to round off the week of rowing. On top of the usual drinks reception and dinner, we celebrated the contributions of Old Mertonian Dr Chester White MBE to the Boat Club. Chester came to Merton in 1952 to read Medicine and was a keen rower. His crew mates included Harry (Hugh) Quick, after whom our men’s first shell is named. Chester has since been at Darwin College, Cantab., where he founded and is President of the boat club. Nonetheless, he has been a constant figure in Merton College Boat Club, sitting on the Friends’ Committee for many years and supporting us generously.\n\nChester was invited to christen the ‘Chester White’ as part of the drinks reception, the second boat in his personal fleet (the other being an eight at Darwin). The boat was purchased at the beginning of Michaelmas Term and can be rowed both as a 4- and as a 4X-. It has given the Club greater flexibility with training and is in excellent condition, after a small renovation and repainting by boatman, Mark Seal.\n\nThe dinner was rounded off by speeches from the Warden, Sir Martin Taylor, from Chester, and from the Men’s and Women’s captains, Edward Thomas and Kailan Sierra-Davison. A fantastic time was had by all.\n\nTorpids race reports\n\nSixth week brought Torpids and the return of the MCBC results chalkboard to the Lodge. Following a difficult term’s preparation, including several periods without water training, Merton fielded three strong crews. Huge thanks are due, as ever, to our coach Ian Smith for his efforts with all crews, and to those who came down over the course of the regatta to support the rowers.\n\nMen’s 1st Torpid\n\nFollowing a very successful Michaelmas and start to Hilary, M1 looked to build on last year’s four bumps and climb higher in Div. II. They started off with a convincing bump on Queen’s, confirming student press circulation that they were a crew to look out for. A thrilling second day’s racing, in which Merton were within a canvas of Brasenose, ended with a last-gasp bump by an excellent Mansfield crew. Pride was restored, however, with an overbump on Brasenose on Friday, the regatta ending with a row-over on Saturday.\n\nAlthough the crew only went +1 over the week, they demonstrated solid technique and cohesion, and showed that Merton can compete in the top twenty boat clubs on the water. Provided the crew remains intact for Trinity term, they will be looking to work on intensive fitness training and, sitting in Division III, should aim for blades.\n\nWomen’s 1st Torpid\n\nMerton’s women fielded a young crew, half of whom were competing in their first bumps race. That said, the other four members of the crew boast considerable experience, as did their cox, current Secretary and three-time W1 rower, Laura King. The crew were unlucky to be among excellent crews, being bumped on the first two days and again on Saturday. On the Friday, however, they showed composure and good fitness to row over and should go into Trinity looking to develop the younger members of the team. It is definitely work in progress, but next year will surely see a return to success for W1.\n\nMen’s 2nd Torpid\n\nHaving come second in rowing-on, and boasting a strong crew with ability reaching novices from this year to previous first boat rowers, the crew knew that they had a good chance of blades. Having bumped up into Division V on Wednesday, they proceeded to earn blades in style, achieving their final bump on Saturday just short of the boat house. A fuller account of M2’s regatta is available in this apposite bit of Virgil: ‘Extremos pudeat rediisse‘.\n\nImmense thanks are due to Henrik Hannemann, long-term M1 rower and former Club Treasurer, who coxed, coached and trained an excellent crew.\n\nOverall summary for this years Torpids and crews:\n\nM1: +1/-1/+1/row over\n\nStart: 11th Div II\n\nFinish: 10th Div II\n\nM2: +3/+1/+1/+1\n\nStart: 2nd Div VI\n\nFinish: 8th Div V\n\nW1: -2/-2/row over/-2\n\nStart: 4th Div III\n\nFinish: 10th Div III\n\nM\n\nCox\n\nStroke\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBow\n\n1st Torpid\n\nToby Adkins\n\nTom Lousada\n\nSam Picard / Henrik Hannemann\n\nAlex Moore\n\nJaime Valdemoros\n\nJacob White\n\nBen Holden\n\nMantas Abazorios\n\nEdward Thomas\n\nM\n\nCox\n\nStroke\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBow\n\n2nd Torpid\n\nHenrik Hannemann\n\nLukas Koch\n\nIan Dawes\n\nMichael Withers\n\nMate Kovacs-Deaks\n\nBenedict Halbroth\n\nMiklos Hajnal\n\nFrederick Crowley\n\nOliver Pateman\n\nW\n\nCox\n\nStroke\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBow\n\n1st Torpid\n\nLaura King / Toby Adkins\n\nAmanda Thomas\n\nCaitlin Armstrong / Phoebe Pexton\n\nKailan Sierra-Davidson\n\nRebecca Hardy\n\nJosie Smith\n\nKirsty Mitchell\n\nGeorgina Fooks\n\nJosie Western\n\nMerton 2nd Torpid 2016 – addition to the blades collection!\n\nOnly just back from the Christmas vacation, Torpids training started in earnest. With the crews selected, the 2nd Torpid boasted a wide variety of rowing experience from several years to having been roped into rowing merely a couple of months earlier. We had four weeks until we had to prove what we are made of. Despite a moody river, training progressed well on land, in the rowing tank, and on the water whenever the river level allowed us a proper outing.\n\nRowing On was the first time (and fortunately with hindsight the last time) we had to row over the whole course. With 3 min 7.5 sec the crew posted the second best time after Lady Margaret Hall II. With a solid performance and a clear aim ahead we went into race week, acknowledged as a very good crew, a force to be reckoned with.\n\nOn the first day, starting off bungline two, we caught up with Exeter II in the Gut, but also LMH II, who were marginally quicker than us in Rowing On, did not pose a threat at any point in this race. Having bumped to the top of the division, the sandwich race promised to be an exciting one. Before we had even reached Donnington Bridge, Wolfson III had caught up with Mansfield II while St Hilda’s I had already bumped out on St John’s III. The four crews starting in front of us had either bumped or got entangled. The Mansfield cox had not conceded in time which got the crew entangled and due to fantastic reactions from the rowers, hard rudder, and a bit of ‘hope and pray’, we managed to squeeze our eight through the gap and bump Mansfield II by row past.\n\nAfter the exciting first day, we had to reschedule as we were now rowing in Men’s Division V. While lining up behind and being ready to chase down Wolfson III, yet again we were faced with crews plummeting down and others bumping out. With a clean side-to-side contact, we bumped Pembroke III who had started three places above us at the top of the Gut.\n\nThe plan for day three was rather simple: keep doing what we had been doing and bump the next crew in our way. On Thursday this was Worcester II who also had started three bunglines ahead. While St Hilda’s I had closed them down early before the Gut, Wolfson III bumped them at the beginning of Greenbanks which left us with a couple of more strokes until we had bumped them, too.\n\nOn Saturday everyone had one word in mind – blades. Having closed down on Wolfson III on all previous days but always having been denied the bump, we hoped to complete our task today. Unfortunately, once more another crew foiled that attempt, but bumping Regent’s Park in sight of the boathouses in the crossing made a glorious conclusion to a successful Torpids campaign.\n\nWithin six weeks the oarsmen came together and showed what committed training and a clear aim can mean: return to fixed divisions and gain blades while doing so!\n\nMen’s\n\nCox\n\nStroke\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBow\n\n2nd Torpid\n\nHenrik Hannemann\n\nLukas Koch\n\nIan Dawes\n\nMichael Withers\n\nMate Kovacs-Deak\n\nBenedict Halbroth\n\nMiklos Hajnal\n\nFrederick Crowley\n\nOliver Pateman\n\nCoach\n\nBoatman\n\nBumps\n\nWednesday\n\nThursday\n\nFriday\n\nSaturday\n\nIan Smith\n\nMark Seal\n\nExeter II & Mansfield II\n\nPembroke III\n\nWorcester II\n\nRegent’s Park\n\nPhoto by F Money\n\nFinal round up of the year\n\nSummer Eights finished off the traditional rowing term, we are looking back at a fantastic dinner and great fun on the Isis. Thank you to all those who have supported the Boat Club over the last year. Same as for all previous years, both Eights and Torpids crews can be found in our crew archive. To round off, the reports below are from the outgoing Men’s and Women’s Captains and were originally published in the Postmaster\n\nOverall summary for this years Summer Eights:\n\nM1: RO/-1/RO/+1 [overall level]\n\nStart: 6th Div III\n\nFinish: 6th Div III\n\nM2: -1/-1/-1/RO [overall -3]\n\nStart: 11th Div IV\n\nFinish: 1st Div V\n\nM3: RO/RO/-1/RO [overall -1]\n\nStart: 4th Div VII\n\nFinish: 5th Div VII\n\nW1: -1/-1/-1/-1 [Spoons]\n\nStart: 1st Div II\n\nFinish. 5th Div II\n\nW2:\n\nnot fielded, -4 for next year\n\nMen’s Rowing\n\nMichaelmas began with a strong push to recruit novices, with rowing drinks and taster sessions. Both were a success, and the year began with almost as many novices as senior rowers. At the end of the year, half of each of the men’s first and second boats were made up of students in their first year of training. Our new coach, Ian Smith, came with high recommendations and proved to be an excellent asset. We also retained an impressive roster of oarsmen from the previous year, with 20 senior rowers – including two who trialled with OULRC in Michaelmas. The term mainly consisted of extensive technical outings geared specifically towards racing in Autumn Fours, which was the first chance for us to witness the progress of our returning senior rowers. Our men’s Four beat LMH in the first round of Autumn Fours. Unfortunately they lost in the second round to a strong Balliol crew. The other half were back in a double for more racing, sweeping aside a strong boat from Brasenose to storm into the final by three boat lengths. Sadly, they were defeated in the final by a pair of lightweight blues rowers.\n\nIn Hilary, crews were sent to the Isis Winter League D in an Eight and a coxed Four, with the Eight coming 17th of 39 in their class and the Four coming third of four in their class. Torpids brought great results for the men’s first boat. An unsatisfying first day, with a technical row over, was followed by four bumps in the other three days, bringing M1 firmly into Division II. The men’s second boat had less success, dropping from Division V into Division VI.\n\nTrinity left us with just enough numbers for two permanent men’s boats, but sadly two rowers suffered unrelated injuries and couldn’t make the racing. M1 recovered well, bringing up an M2 rower who responded quickly to the challenge. This left M2 training up two fairly inexperienced rowers in the fortnight before Eights racing.\n\nErrors in racing technique surprisingly caused M1 to row over on the first day and be bumped on the second day. The crew battled off a strong Linacre crew on Friday and then bumped Somerville on Saturday past Boat Club Island. The final result was no change in position; the first time Merton’s\n\nM1 has not dropped since 2010. M2 did better than expected given the last-minute changes in crew, managing to avoid spoons. Unfortunately they still dropped from the bottom of Division IV to the top of Division V. Overall, the crews were fairly happy with their training and results this year, with the Men’s first crew moving up four places in Torpids and holding their position in Summer Eights. Our coach Ian Smith has been key to this success.\n\nOngoing training and recruitment should help us build on the base that has been built in the Boat Club. I look forward to seeing what we can achieve over the coming years.\n\nJaime Valdemoros Gomez (2013)\n\nMen’s Captain 2014-15\n\nWomen’s Rowing\n\nThis year’s women’s boat has been made up of a great group of girls and I do not think anyone can deny the sheer amount of hard work, commitment and good humour that has been put in!\n\nWe started well in Michaelmas Term with our freshers’ boat successfully winning both their first and second races. Our most enthusiastic freshers then continued into Hilary Term and joined W1 in training for Torpids. Some icy cold stints on the water, as well as gruelling gym and erg sessions, were rewarded with great improvement. We must also thank Ian Smith, our wonderful coach, for his dedication and never ending patience. All of this combined meant that on the day itself we achieved a bump – something we were all very proud of, as for many of us, this was the first time.\n\nTrinity Term provided more time on the water and arguably more enjoyable sessions, given that it was even occasionally sunny. This training led into a great Summer Eights’ Week, when fun was had by all. As I said in my speech at the dinner that finished the week: ‘Yes, we got spoons, but we\n\ngot spoons in style!’ I think the girls this year should be very proud of everything they have achieved; the crew was mostly very inexperienced and they performed well under pressure. I expect great things next year when, with more experience, I am sure the boat will go from strength to strength.\n\nSally Bolton (2013)\n\nWomen’s Captain 2014-15\n\nMen’s Torpids\n\nby Jaime Valdemoros Gomez [Men’s Captain]\n\nDespite worries about the weather during Hilary term, the wind and rain cleared up enough in time for Torpids to go ahead without restrictions. A strong term of rowing ended with brilliant results for Merton’s M1, bumping up four places over the course of the week: an unfortunate crash on Wednesday left M1 with a technical rowover, however they pulled ahead by bumping St. Hugh’s on Thursday, Exeter and Christ Church M2 on Friday (the second as sandwich boat, pushing ChCh back into Div III) and finally Somerville on Saturday, leaving them firmly in the Division II and securing the best results for Merton’s M1 in Torpids since 1999. We will be pushing hard for an equally successful run in Summer Eights next term.\n\nMerton’s M2 was less fortunate – a good term left a well-set boat, however a series of strokes of bad luck dropped them out of ranked divisions. We will continue to work hard next term and look forward to a good set of races in Eights.\n\nWomen’s Torpids\n\nby Sally Bolton [Women’s Captain]\n\nDay 1 – Wednesday\n\nWe started at the head of Division III and were hoping to row on into Division II later, but unfortunately a very quick Wadham W2 bumped us early on. We nevertheless rowed the full, (rather gruelling!) course and then had a good rest before day two.\n\nDay 2 – Thursday\n\nA well-executed bump on Exeter meant that we were head of the division once again and therefore did get the opportunity to row in Division II. We rowed over this time and therefore remained head of Division III overnight.\n\nDay 3 – Friday\n\nAfter a tiring second day, Brasenose bumped us early on and then Linacre a bit later.\n\nDay 4 – Saturday\n\nWith nothing to lose we went out all guns blazing. As expected we were bumped by a very strong Green Templeton before the gut but then closed on Queens, who had started two bung lines ahead of us, finishing less than a length behind them. Everyone was very happy with the overall performance of the crew and we finished 4th in Division III.\n\nOverall summary for this years Torpids:\n\nM1: technical row-over/+1/+2/+1\n\nStart: 3rd Div III\n\nFinish: 11th Div II\n\nM2: -5/-1/-1/-3\n\nStart: 6th Div V\n\nFinish: 4th Div VI\n\nW1: -1/+1/-2/-1\n\nStart: 1st Div III\n\nFinish. 4th Div III\n\nCrews:\n\nMen’s\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\nMen’s\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\n– 1st Torpid\n\nFrederick Money\n\nJacob White\n\nBenedict Holden\n\nEdward Thomas\n\nDaniel Kennedy\n\nHenrik Hannemann\n\nJaime Valdemoros Gomez\n\nLukas Koch\n\nTiffany Brydges\n\n– 2nd Torpid\n\nHristian Hristov\n\nAlexander Eperon\n\nIan Dawes\n\nDavid Felce\n\nEdmund Wrigley\n\nMichael Withers\n\nStefan Marjanovic\n\nMantas Abazorius\n\nSven Kirkerup\n\nW\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\n– 1st Torpid\n\nKristina Gedgaudaite\n\nRebecca Hardy\n\nAlexandra Pike\n\nSally Bolton\n\nCaitlin Armstrong\n\nLaura King\n\nZijun Chen\n\nKailan Sierra-Davidson\n\nToby Adkins\n\nboth photos by Hilary Wynne.\n\nIsis Winter League 2014-15\n\nDuring Michaelmas and Hilary Term, the Isis Winter League allows the crews to gain a bit of head race practice on the home stretch throughout the terms. With a mix in squad sizes, returning and novice oarsmen, Merton entered various boats into several of the events. All courses are rowed from Donnington Bridge to Cox Stone.\n\nWith the women leading the charge, entering a 4+ into IWL C in late January, racing for all crews and preparations for Torpids and by extension all other regattas for the season had started. Not to be outdone, the men joined in for IWL D as well. Overall, both the men and the women fielded a 4+ and the men’s an additional 8+ and using this as a bit of race practice for Torpids. Furthermore a mixed 2X entered as well. In contrast to other occasions, the day proved to be extraordinarily mild for the time of year. It only too two weeks for the Isis and the English weather to show a very different face: low temperature, high stream and swell, paired with strong winds greeted the crews for IWL E on 22nd February. With both sides entering their first eights as well as half of the men’s second eight rowing in a 4+, this was certainly a worst case training regarding the weather. Regardless of that, all crews gained valuable experience and showcased their training efforts since the beginning of the term.\n\nIWL C – 25 January 2015\n\n[fastest time on the course: 4 min 52.5. sec Jesus M8+]\n\nW4+\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\nTime: 6 min 54 sec (5th out of 6)\n\nCaitlin Armstrong\n\nSally Bolton\n\nLaura King\n\nZijun Chen\n\nToby Adkins\n\nIWL D – 8 February 2015\n\n[fastest time on the course: 4 min 30.5 sec Magdalen M8+]\n\nM8+\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\nM4+\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\nTime: 5 min 1.5 sec (17th out of 39)\n\nMark Hassall\n\nJacob White\n\nBenedict Holden\n\nEdward Thomas\n\nDaniel Kennedy\n\nHenrik Hannemann\n\nJaime Valdemoros Gomez\n\nLukas Koch\n\nTiffany Brydges\n\nTime: 6 min 2 sec (3rd out of 4)\n\nFrederick Money\n\nMantas Abazorius\n\nEdmund Wrigley\n\nMichael Withers\n\nSven Kirkerup\n\nW4+\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\n2X\n\nBow\n\nStroke\n\nTime: 6 min 51.5 sec (6th out of 8)\n\nKristina Gedgaudaite\n\nSally Bolton\n\nZijun Chen\n\nLaura King\n\nToby Adkins\n\nTime: 5min 56.5 sec (only 2X racing)\n\nCaitlin Armstrong\n\nHenrik Hannemann\n\nIWL E – 22 February 2015\n\n[fastest time on the course: 3 min 45 sec Pembroke M8+]\n\nM8+\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\nM4+\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\nTime: 4 min 28.5 sec (27th out of 52)\n\nFrederick Money\n\nJacob White\n\nBenedict Holden\n\nEdward Thomas\n\nDaniel Kennedy\n\nHenrik Hannemann\n\nJaime Valdemoros Gomez\n\nLukas Koch\n\nTiffany Brydges\n\nTime: 6 min 2 sec (3rd out of 4)\n\nStefan Marjanovic\n\nMichael Withers\n\nDaniel Whittle\n\nMantas Abazorius\n\nSven Kirkerup\n\nW8+\n\nBow\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nStroke\n\nCox\n\nTime: 6 min 51.5 sec (6th out of 8)\n\nKristina Gedgaudaite\n\nMiriam O’Duill\n\nAlexandra Pike\n\nSally Bolton\n\nCaitlin Armstrong\n\nLaura King\n\nZijun Chen\n\nKailan Sierra-Davidson\n\nToby Adkins"
