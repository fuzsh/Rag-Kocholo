        "meta_description": "Of the 22 organists who have held this office since 1634, many have had links with St Patrick’s & Christ Church Cathedrals in Dublin. One of the most notable was John Clarke (later Clarke-Whitfeld) who was organist in Armagh from 1794-1797 and later moved to hold a similar post at St John’s and Trinity Colleges, Cambridge, and at Hereford Cathedral. … Continue reading Past Organists →",

        "text": "Claxton 1670’s – 1688\n\nWe know that an organist was appointed in Archbishop Margetson’s time (1663-1678), probably in the later years of the Primacy. There is no reason to assume that this was Claxton but since the next mention of an organist, in 1688 is close, then it could be a possibility. Walter Harris’ account of the cathedral states:\n\nThe name of ye Organist was Claxton, and he had, by report, a Salary of £25 a year.\n\nAccording to Harris, he remained until the revolution in 1688 when the cathedral was used as a garrison, There is no doubt that the services and choral music were unable to function during this time.\n\nJohn Hawkshaw 1693 – 1695\n\nThe only reference to a John Hawkshaw at Armagh is an entry in the cathedral registers for 27 June 1695:\n\nRobert Hodge to be Organist of the [said] college & Cathedral in the … & place of the said John Hawkshaw [deceased]\n\nThe cathedral building was restored in 1693 after the Williamite war and this would have been an opportunity to appoint a successor to Claxton. Indeed it is the only time Hawkshaw could have been appointed if Harris’ statement about Claxton is correct.\n\nMuch confusion exists here over the connection with the John Hawkshaws of Christ Church and St Patrick’s Cathedrals Dublin. In fact there is nothing to connect the two and I would support the suggestion in Cathedral Anthems that this is John Hawkshaw junior, and that he went to Armagh a while after his suspension from office at St Patrick’s Dublin in 1685. Many sources initially get confused by thinking his appointment at Armagh was c.1661 but there is no evidence to substantiate this. It appears that the only reference to suggest there were two John Hawkshaws in Dublin is an entry in the Chapter Acts for St Patrick’s Cathedral in February 1668, “It was decided that the roof should be taken down, and that the organ be removed by the organist, Mr Hawkshaw senior.” VI Unfortunately it is impossible to distinguish further references from each other.\n\nJohn Hawkshaw was organist and Vicar Choral of Christ Church Cathedral 1660/1-1689. Cotton describes him as “one of the ancient vicars of this church” and gives dates of appointment as 1645 as Vicar Choral and 1646 as organist, but Cathedral Anthems state there is no record of the appointments in Christ Church Chapter minutes except that his name appears on leases. He was admitted Vicar Choral in February 1660/1 and was referred to as organist on 20 November 1662, when he was allowed arrears of salary.VII Accounts show he was paid as organist up to Lady Day 1689. VII Like some of his predecessors and successors, Hawkshaw held the post of organist of both the Dublin cathedrals simultaneously. At St Patrick’s he and/or his son was organist from 1660-1685/6. John Hawkshaw from 1659 deputised during Randal Jewett’s protracted absence at St Patrick’s and was, on 15 March 1660/1, permanently appointed his successor. By September 1664 Hawkshaw had not received any arrears of salary, and he demanded £150 which the Chapter agreed to pay by installments, but this matter was still unresolved by May 1669. He was (re)admitted Vicar Choral on 24 October 1660 VII having been previously admitted to this position in 1643, a post which he held until his final mention in the Vicars’ January roll-call for 1687/8. VII His stay as organist was slightly shorter because against his name as Vicar Choral in January 1685/6 is written “offic: organisti seq: in manus Thomas Godfrey”, and below the list there is an order that John Hawkshaw, “propter manifestum contemptum”, is to be sequestered from his post of organist and replaced by Godfrey. VII\n\nCathedral Anthems and Cotton conjecture that John Hawkshaw senior was organist of St Patrick’s between 1660/1 and 1678 and his son from 1678 to 1685. Shaw writes “on whatever evidence this may rest, I noticed nothing to substantiate it.” Cathedral Anthems give the death of John Hawkshaw senior as “about 1688″, Cotton gives ” Hawkshaw, deceased” against the appointment of J Vinigam as Vicar Choral of Christ Church Cathedral on 9 Jan 1688. This may suggest the younger one went to Armagh and died shortly after his father.\n\nRobert Hodge 1695 – 1703\n\nHodge was appointed organist on 27 June 1695. We only have two references to him in Armagh: his appointment as mentioned above in cathedral registers and his signature on a lease in Armagh in 1703. This itself does not mean he was organist during this time or even resident in Armagh. With the possible previous connection with Dublin, through Hawkshaw, it is likely this Robert Hodge was a relative or even the same person as his namesake who was organist of the two cathedrals there. The 1701 visitation record suggests that no organist was present but this could have been during a period of absence.\n\nOn a lease, dated 2 December 1703, from the Vicars Choral and Organist to a Thomas Shields, we have the signature “Robt Hodge: organist”.\n\nThe Robert Hodge connected with Dublin was a chorister at Exeter Cathedral and in 1683 went to London to study under Henry Purcell. He was admitted a probationary Vicar Choral of Wells Cathedral in January 1686/7, and was appointed organist on 7 April 1688. A few months after his appointment as organist at Wells he was “arraigned by the Chapter and the Vicars Choral for having been with some persons, late at night in the city, who had broken a window and was warned that if his behaviour did not improve within his probationary year he would be removed. “Also He seems to have left Wells, in dubious circumstances, in 1690, and next appears as a lay clerk of Durham Cathedral in April 1691. Soon afterwards, he set out for “Hibemia” in April 1692.\n\nSt Patrick’s Cathedral Dublin appointed him a Vicar Choral on 19 April 1693 and the next year he was appointed organist on 19 October 1694. At Christ Church he was appointed a Vicar Choral on 4 June 1695, but had been connected in some way as early as the accounting year 1692-3. At some point he became “master of the song” of St Patrick’s where he resigned his position as organist in 1698 having been appointed master of the choristers of Christ Church. He continued as Vicar Choral of St Patrick’s and evidently continued to teach the boys.\n\nIn 1699 Daniel Roseingrave (Hodge’s successor as organist of St Patrick’s) and Hodge were ordered to appear before the Dean and Chapter of St Patrick’s because they “lately gave each other very scurrilous language in Christ Church, Dublin, and afterwards went to the tavern and there fought.” VII Roseingrave as “the first and chief aggressor” was fined £3 and required to apologise to Hodge whose fine was a mere 20s. VI The following year Thomas Finnell (organist of Christ Church 1694-8) was accused of assaulting his successor, Roseingrave. VII No doubt Hodge was a somewhat unstable character and Roseingrave possibly more so, but Hodge is recorded doing his job well at Christ Church, “teaching and instructing the boys in singing and in the knowledge of the organ and finding them with sufficient meat, drink, clothing, lodging and washing.” VI The repertoire of St Patrick’s was improved in 1697/8 when Hodge returned from a journey to England with some anthems and services. In February 1705/6 he brought two choirboys from England to St Patrick’s. The burial of “Mr Robert Hodge, vicar of St. Patrick and master of the song”, is recorded in Dublin, 26 May 1709.\n\nIf this was the same Robert Hodge as Armagh then there is an interval of several years unaccounted for previous to the appointment of William Toole in 1711. He may not have taken up his appointment at Armagh in 1695 but could have returned for a short stay c.1703 or he may perhaps have been an absentee organist in Armagh (or Dublin).\n\nLangrish Doyle, MUSD 1776 – 1780\n\nDoyle was appointed in 1776 and appears to have spent all his musical career in Ireland. After serving as a chorister of St Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin 1763- 8 and of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, c.1766, he became a substitute stipendiary of Christ Church on 12 November 1772 and a full stipendiary on 6 November 1775. VII The Christ Church Acts record his departure for Armagh on 8 September 1776 which leaves a period of two years unaccounted for in the succession of organists at Armagh. He was only in his early twenties during his stay at Armagh and this was likely his first post as organist.\n\nIn November 1780, both Christ Church and St Patrick’s Cathedrals resolved that “Mr Langrish Doyle” should be appointed master of the boys and that he should be recommended to Trinity College as Samuel Murphy’s successor as organist. On the same day he was also appointed organist and stipendiary of Christ Church. VII Six months later, in May 1781, he was admitted a half Vicar Choral of St Patrick’s, leading to a full Vicar on 5 February 1784. He resigned his position as a stipendiary of Christ Church in May 1791, receiving £40 a year more as organist in compensation.\n\nDoyle relinquished his position as master of the boys in 1797 and was replaced by one of his successors at Armagh, Dr John Clarke, who took up the position from Christmas Day 1797. He continued as organist of Christ Church, but on 25 November 1805 he expressed a desire, “from his age and long service”, to have a deputy, and the Chapter, on his recommendation, appointed his nephew William Warren. VII West says, according to the books, he was “licensed to be absent” in 1813 III and Cathedral Anthems says he ceased to be organist in 1814. There is no official record of his doctorate, but on the admission of his son, Garret Wesley Doyle, to Trinity College, Dublin in 1789, he was described as “Musicae Doctor.”\n\nRichard Langdon BMUS 1782 – 1794\n\nBorn Exeter c.1729, died Exeter 8 September 1803 aged 74. A confirmation that this was the same Richard Langdon who had been organist of Exeter Cathedral can be found in John Stafford Smith’s copy of his own Anthems (1793), now in the Royal College of Music. It contains a torn fragment of a letter, dated Armagh, 23 November 1794, and signed “Susanna Langdon”, which concludes “Mr Langdon is so ill, but if his health will permit intends to return here early in Spring.”\n\nLangdon was a relative (probably a grandson) of Rev Tobias Langdon, Vicar Choral of Exeter Cathedral, 1683-1712. He was a chorister of that cathedral, and from 1744 took organ lessons from John Hicks, the Master of the Choristers. VII In June 1753, he himself became lay Vicar Choral and organist of Exeter Cathedral and also Master of the Choristers (informator puerorum) and sub-chanter (succentor) in 1762. VI In 1761 he took the Oxford degree of BMus and on 28 August l770 he married Susanna Evans. He resigned his posts at Exeter in October 1777 and in November of that year he was appointed organist of Ely Cathedral, moving thence to Bristol Cathedral in December 1777 where he resigned in June 1781. In 1782 he came to Armagh Cathedral which had probably been without an organist for over a year. He may not have been entirely happy at Armagh if he was the same Richard Langdon who, in June 1784, was appointed organist of Peterborough Cathedral and did not take up duty there. He remained at Armagh until 1794 when he left in poor health, thus leading to his retirement to Exeter. After his resignation from Armagh, Langdon was paid a salary of £25 p.a., this sum being deducted out of the successive organists’ salaries until his death.\n\nLangdon also composed some music including several anthems and chants which can still be found in the old part books in the choir library at Armagh. A memorial to him in St Martin’s Church, Exeter reads: “Richard Langdon Batchelor of Music died the 8th of Sept. 1803. aged 74.” VII West gives his burial place as St Paul’s Church Exeter.\n\nJohn Clarke MUSD (later Clarke Whitfeld) 1794 – 1797\n\nBorn Gloucester, 13 December 1770, died Holmer, near Hereford, 22 February 1836. Clarke was probably the most famous musician associated with Armagh Cathedral. His early musical training was at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he allegedly studied music under Dr William Hayes but this is more likely his successor, Philip Hayes. VII While there he was appointed organist of Ludlow Parish Church in October 1789. In 1793 he matriculated to take the degree of BMus, shortly afterwards publishing at least two compositions during his time at Ludlow, Clarke probably took up his position at Armagh towards the end of 1794. He was known to still be in Ludlow in January 1794 performing at a concert.\n\nClarke himself refers to this three-year tenure at Armagh in his autobiographical material Cathedral Music, vol.2. VII While there, he was granted the degree of MusD from Trinity College, Dublin, by diploma by private grace on 10 October 1795. Interestingly he would have played Armagh’s Snetzler instrument with knowledge of the Snetzler in Ludlow Parish Church. He moved to Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin as master of the choristers in succession to Langrish Doyle, his appointment taking effect from Christmas Day 1797. This post was, as before, simultaneously linked with the post at St Patrick’s Cathedral. On 4 June 1798 he was given leave to go to England on private business and on 26 December his letter of resignation was received, addressed from England. He himself said that he left Ireland “owing to the Irish Rebellion.”\n\nFor the next twenty years Clarke settled in Cambridge as organist at St John’s and Trinity Colleges under the joint arrangements then prevailing. He secured recognition of his academic status when he was granted the degree of MusD by incorporation in 1799. In his autobiographical notes he stated that he took the Oxford degree of D Mus in 1810 although there is no official record of this. VII In 1814 he changed his name to Clarke-Whitfeld in expectation of an inheritance from his mother’s family, a hope which unfortunately came to nothing and left him in debt “owing to a Chancery suit and the unfeeling conduct of a relative.”\n\nIn June 1820 Clarke-Whitfeld returned to the area where he was born, as organist and master of the choristers at Hereford Cathedral, and a year later he was elected (non-resident) professor of music at Cambridge, as he says “by a majority in the Senate of more than 100.” He was often involved with the Three Choirs Festivals as a conductor and accompanist and was a popular and prolific composer of church music. His many published works include musical settings of the poetry of Sir Walter Scott and Byron and also two oratorios which were performed in 1822 and 1825 at the Hereford Festival.\n\nHe tendered his resignation at Hereford in April 1823, probably due to ill- health, but withdrew it in June. He finally was obliged to retire in 1832 after the Chapter decided “In consequence of the long and increasing deterioration in the choral services of the Cathedral proceeding as they are aware from Dr Whitfeld’s infirm state of health which has for a long period experienced the forbearance of the Chapter; the Dean and Chapter now feel it to be their indispensable duty to communicate to him their decision that the office of organist will be vacant at Midsummer next.” VII Clarke-Whitfeld retained his Cambridge professorship until his death at Holmer near Hereford in February 1836. On the east wall of the Bishop’s Cloister of Hereford Cathedral there is the following inscription:\n\nSacred to the memory / of / John Clarke Whitfeld Esquire. / Mus Doc in the three Universities / and professor in that of Cambridge / Born Dec 13. 1770 Died Feb 22. 1836 / aged 65 / He left to his family / the inheritance of a fair and honourable name / and to many / who knew and loved him / a memory without stain / as the father the gentleman / and the friend.\n\nJohn Jones MUSD 1797 – 1816\n\nBorn Armagh? 1767, died Armagh 21 March 1820. Details of his early life are uncertain. He was writing master to the boys from 1768 to 1788 V and a stipendiary choirman at Armagh. Clarke-Whitfeld, who would have known him, said he had been a pupil of Samuel Arnold (organist of Chapel Royal & Westminster Abbey} .\n\nOn 19 July 1796 he was appointed a Vicar Choral of Armagh I followed the next year by the position of organist. In 181 I he gained degree of MusD from Trinity College, Dublin { the certificate of this degree is to be found in the Chapter Room at Armagh}. This would indicate that he remained a very competent musician during his time at Armagh. Records show he was a substitute for Dr Allott c.1795. He also visited London for 12 weeks and purchased music. As was customary with his predecessors, he boarded 3 choirboys. In 1815 his sons [?] Thomas and Robert were choirboys.\n\nIn July 1816 he resigned his appointment and was replaced by Horncastle. A letter of Horncastle claims that Jones left as the result of an unspecified grievance with Richard Allott, the Archbishop’s Commissioner. A fine oil portrait of Dr Jones was donated in 1957 by Mr R M Rogers of Belfast and was hung in the Music Hall; it has since been transferred to the Chapter Room. His tombstone in St Mark’s Churchyard Armagh, in a family plot on the north side, bears the following faint inscription:\n\nHere lieth the body / of / John Jones Mus. D. / late Organist and Master of the Boys / in this Cathedral / which office he filled for upwards of twenty years / in such a manner / as to secure the approbation / and conciliate the esteem / of all / who could properly appreciate / the zeal talent and fidelity / with which he discharged his important duties / I In the various relations / of private life / he was equally meritorious and exemplary / contributing while here / to the happiness of his friends / and promoting the welfare / of his fellow creatures / He departed this life / on the 21st of March / 1820 / in the 53rd year of his age.\n\nFrederick William Horncastle 1816 – 1822\n\nBorn London, 1790?, died 1850. Horncastle was a chorister of the Chapel Royal, London, and then organist of Stamford Hill Chapel and Berkeley Chapel, London. III He was appointed organist of Armagh in 1816. Evidence suggests that he became a little careless in his attitude to his duties, absenting himself frequently to make excursions to Warrenpoint and Rostrevor. These absences together with Horncastle’s unwillingness to take part in weekly choral concerts in the Music Hall led to a dispute with Richard Allott. Further problems of the same nature led to a visitation held by the Archbishop in November 1822, purely to conduct a disciplinary hearing. Subsequently certificates of expulsion bearing the Primate’s seal were fixed to Horncastle’s residence and the Chapter Room door at the cathedral:\n\nTherefore We, John George, Archbishop aforesaid and Visitor of said College of Vicars and Organist, on account of the turbulence, contention, insolence and contumacy of said Frederick William Homcastle do pronounce and decree that the said Frederick William Homcastle be removed from his said office of Organist and Master of the Choiristers [sic] and that the licence or Patent heretofore granted to him be revoked, cancelled and declared null and void, the peace and good order of said College of Vicars in said Cathedral so requiring.\n\nHis expulsion from his post is unique at Armagh. The correspondence, charges, dismissal etc. are preserved in a collection of letters in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.\n\nHorncastle returned to London and became a gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1826. He was composer of a mass, glees, songs, pianoforte pieces, etc. In 1828 Horncastle collaborated with T Cooke, Stansbury, Parry, Clifton and Taylor in a work entitled “The Passions” for the Melodists’ Club.\n\nA Mr Garbett officiated as organist during the interval between Horncastle’s expulsion and Turle’s appointment.\n\nRobert Turle 1822 – 1872\n\nBorn Taunton 19 March 1804, died Salisbury 26 March 1877. Robert Turle was the younger brother of James Turle who later became organist of Westminster Abbey (1831-82). He was son of Mr James Turle and may have been a chorister in Wells Cathedral like his brother. Before his appointment to Armagh he was organist of St Lawrence Jewry, London, 1821-2; writing to the Vestry on 24 December 1822, he said that he had,\n\n“through the interest and good opinion of a much respected and highly valued friend, my late master Mr Greatorex, [Thomas Greatorex organist of Westminster Abbey 1819-31] been honoured by the appointment of organist and master of the boys to the Cathedral Church of Armagh”,\n\nAt Armagh, Turle immediately increased the number of boys in the choir from 4 to around 10. He saw the cathedral transformed from a dangerous and unsightly building into a fine example of Victorian craftsmanship, and supervised the erection of the large Walker organ 1838-40. V The musical conditions at Armagh during his fifty year tenure appear to have been ideal, indeed, the choir was thought of as one of the best in England and Ireland. Turle had a large house built for him at the top of Market Square in 1854 and retired in 1872 with a pension. Various cathedral officials were entitled to compensation at Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, and of these, Robert Turle, received a commutation sum of £3,158 2s. 8d. VI Sir Frederick Bridge writes of this:\n\n“When the Irish Church was disestablished I believe he commuted his emoluments [from Armagh Cathedral] and retired with a considerable sum as compensation for the loss of his office. It was said that the old gentleman drank the health of Mr. Gladstone -to whom he owed this bit of good fortune- every night in a glass of port.”\n\nRobert Turle was responsible for the training and musical education of several very distinguished composers, singers and instrumentalists. Mr Charles Kelly, in his lecture in 1919, said the following:\n\nIt was of very great interest to learn that under Mr Turle’s Dublin; Dr: I. C. Marks, organist of Cork Cathedral; Mr David Lee, organist, Town Hall, Melbourne; Dr : Osborne Marks, organist, Armagh Cathedral; Mr Barton M’Guckin, distinguished oratorio and operatic tenor singer; and Mr W G. Wood, professor; Royal Academy of Music, London. The names of other musicians of distinction who were connected with the Cathedral during that period were Mr George Benson, of Westminster Abbey; Mr W Cooper; Temple Church, London; Mr Henry Barn by, Westminster Abbey (brother of Sir Joseph Barn by), and Mr G. B. Allen, Mus. Bac., Oxford.\n\nA fine memorial in the north nave aisle pays tribute to his 50 years work in the cathedral.\n\nThomas Osborne Marks MUSD 1872 – 1916\n\nBorn Armagh 6 February 1845, died Armagh 12 September 1916. Thomas Osborne Marks was son of Mr William Marks and younger brother of James Christopher Marks MusD. He was a chorister and a pupil of Robert Turle in Armagh Cathedral, eventually becoming assistant organist there when he was only 15 years old. His elder brother, Dr I C Marks, had also been assistant organist to Turle, from 1852 to 1860, and was organist of Cork Cathedral from 1860 to 1903.\n\nWhen Madam Albani sang in the cathedral in 1891 she publicly complimented him, saying that if she had known that Armagh had possessed so accomplished a musician she would not have brought her own accompanist.” IV Later tributes said that he “so worthily upheld the best traditions of the musical reputation of Armagh till his death in 1916” and that he was “much regretted and respected by everyone who knew him, and by the citizens of the Primatial City generally.”\n\nHe died in 1916 aged seventy-one; his memorial in the north nave aisle of the cathedral records his sixty years of service, forty-two [forty-four] as organist. Three of his sons joined the Army in the First World War, and one of them was killed at the Front in 1916.\n\nGeorge Henry Phillips Hewson MA, MUSD, FRCO 1916 – 1920\n\nBorn Dublin 1881, died Dublin November 1972. Hewson became a chorister in St Patrick’s Cathedral Dublin in 1889 and was later sub-organist there. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, taking the degrees of MusB (1903), BA (1905), MusD (1914), and MA (1928).VII In 1907 he became organist of the Chapel Royal, Dublin Castle, later moving to Armagh Cathedral where he was appointed by minute of the Cathedral Board dated 23 November 1916. His stay at Armagh was short, as he was to return to his home city less than four years later to take up his appointment as organist and choirmaster of St Patrick’s, in succession to Dr C G Marchant\n\nThe Cathedral Board recorded his resignation on 5 March 1920. By 1921 he was Professor of the Organ at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. III In 1927 he accepted the post of organist and choirmaster of Trinity College in addition to his other duties. In 1935 he became Professor of Music in the University of Dublin (Trinity College) in succession to C H Kitson. He resigned as organist of St Patrick’s and Trinity College in 1960, but he retained the chair of music until 1962. In that year, to mark his long association with the College, he was elected an honorary fellow. Hewson was also an honorary FRCO.\n\nHe was highly esteemed in Dublin where his music is still regularly performed at St Patrick’s Cathedral. The choir library there holds three of his anthems, a Te Deum in E, a Communion Service in G minor, and three settings of the Magnificat and Nunc Dirnittis (two of them for men’s voices). VI He also arranged/harmonised a number of Irish hymns.\n\nMartin White BEM, MUSB, FRCO, GRSM, LRAM, ARCM 1968 – 2002\n\nBorn Southall, Middlesex 26 December 1941. White was educated at the Mercers’ School, Holborn, 1953-8, the Royal Academy of Music, 1961-5, and took his Music Teacher’s Certificate at the University of London Institute of Education, 1965-6. He took the FRCO diploma in 1965 and that of CHM ( with John Brook Prize for Choir-Training) in 1967. In 1960 he became organist of Ruislip Priory Church, Middlesex, and from 1963 to 1968 he was organist of Harrow Parish Church. He took the degree of MusB from Trinity College, Dublin in 1988.\n\nIn May 1968, he was appointed as Organist and Master of the Choristers at Armagh, having been selected from eighteen candidates (the post attracted 52 enquiries at this time). He taught in Armagh Technical College and Armagh Girls’ High School and was organiser of Craigavon Music Centre. His compositions include a setting of the Communion Service called “A Celtic Eucharist” which was performed at the inauguration of the Church of Ireland’s Alternative Prayer Book, which was marked by a special service in Armagh Cathedral in October 1984. He is also an excellent improviser.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, civil disturbances, which could easily have led to the disbanding of the choir, were overcome by moving choir practices to the Royal School. Martin White’s work in keeping the choir going through this period must be acknowledged. His practical skills ensured many repairs and alterations to the cathedral organ over the years, and credit must be given to his efforts and advice in bringing about the major rebuild undertaken to this instrument in 1996. In 2004 he was made Honorary Lay Canon in recognition of his contribution to the life of the Cathedral and in 2024 he was awarded the British Empire Medal in the King’s New Year Honours for services to Music in Northern Ireland."
