The St Mark’s College Final Service and Dinner was held on Saturday 26th October 2019 to celebrate our students’ academic, sporting and leadership achievements, announce the student leaders for 2020 and celebrate the students who will soon graduate.\n\nThe evening commenced with students, parents, staff and Old Collegians attending the Final Service at St Peter’s Cathedral. The College Chaplin, Reverend Grant Moore, gave a sermon asking us to reflect on the year that had been and issued a call to action to our students to utilise their university learnings and experience to actively engage in helping resolve some of the issues society faces. He said “As Simon Collins says, no institutions play a bigger part in the socio-economic future-proofing of human society than universities. That’s where tomorrow’s scientific breakthroughs are incubated. And who knows what they will be? Their embryonic templates lie buried in you – as yet undiscovered – hidden among the unique talents with which you’ve been blessed. In the final analysis, your life is God’s precious gift to you. What you do with it, is your gift to the rest of us, to humankind in general, and in the end, to God. ” To read the full sermon, click here.\n\nFollowing the service, students enjoyed pre-dinner drinks with guests in the Walkley Gardens before entering the Grenfell Price Dining Hall for the Final Dinner.\n\nFinal Dinner is always filled with both happy and sad moments, as students reflect on the year and their time at St Mark’s, and as we farewell those who are leaving St Mark’s College. It is also a time for celebration as we acknowledge the outstanding student achievements over the past year.\n\nTo commence the night’s proceedings, first-year Bachelor of Environmental Science at University of South Australia student and Wiradjuri woman, Ms Iman Westhead, gave the Acknowledgement of Country, followed by the Acting Head of College, Mr Darren Pitt, providing the Welcome Address.\n\nThe 2019 College Club President and fourth-year Bachelor of Teaching/Bachelor of Arts University of Adelaide student, Ms Evette de Jager, welcomed back the previous Master of St Mark’s College, Ms Rose Alwyn, and presented her with a gift from the College Club.\n\nThe College Club President-elect for 2020, Mr Nicholas Marzohl, a second-year Bachelor of Psychology student at the University of South Australia, raised a toast to those leaving College saying “Leaving College is a hard thing to do, but to you leavers, I know with the experiences and memories, not to mention the friends and connections you have made here at St Mark’s College, you are ready for anything that gets thrown at you. Leavers, you will always be a part of the St Mark’s College community”.\n\nMs Lucinda Bunge, third-year Bachelor of Physiotherapy student at the University of South Australia, and Mr Mitchell Olive, fourth-year Bachelor of Commerce (International Business) and Bachelor of Business (Corporate Finance) student at the University of Adelaide, provided a passionate leaver’s response, reminding students that “Once you step through the gates of St Mark’s College on your first day, you are not just a Collegian for your time here, you are a Marksman or a Markswoman for life. The friends and connections you make here in this very short period of your life will stay with you forever. These years are the most formative of your life. During these years we have learned some valuable lessons about resilience, how to be more independent, successful communication skills, but most importantly, how to be a genuinely good person, which is what all Marksmen and Markswomen are. Never doubt yourselves, Collegians, for we know we are all going places in life, great places.”\n\nMs Evette de Jager raised a toast to the College and Dr Areti Metuamate, the Dean of St Mark’s responded on behalf of the College and quoted JK Rowling as he called for students to think about the role they play as leaders in their communities: “If you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice; if you choose to identify not only with the powerful but with the powerless; if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages, then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped transform for the better. We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.”\n\nThe celebrations continued as the 2020 student appointed and elected leadership team members were announced, and as the academic, sporting, excellence and leavers awards were presented to students.\n\nCongratulations to all students for the 2019 academic year, a College is little without the contribution and passion of our students.

Over 20 Old Collegians and their partners joined us on Saturday for the 1996-2000 St Mark’s College Reunion.\n\nThe Dean, Dr Areti (Ari) Metuamate welcomed Collegians back to St Mark’s who were students during 1996-2000. Throughout the evening, Collegians shared fond memories of their time at St Mark’s and their exciting lives and extensive career experiences since leaving College.\n\nFormer President of the College Club in 2000, Dr Matthew Little (1998-2001) said grace to commence the evening’s proceedings. Following, Dr Matthew Hunt (1997-1999) shared fond memories about his days at St Mark’s, praised the College as a supportive community to live in and proposed a toast to the College.\n\nIn response to the toast, the Dean spoke about various aspects of current College life, including the academic acumen and cohesiveness of the student community. He shared information about the recent developments of our Indigenous student program and outlined the building work completed earlier this year. This included the opening of the Learning Commons, the new study and event space above the Dining Hall that would not have been possible without the support and benefaction of our broader St Mark’s College community.\n\nSt Mark’s Senior Academic Tutor, Alexandra Kenny, attended the dinner to share her experiences of College life and enjoyed connecting with the Old Collegians. The passion displayed by the Collegians was evident in the way they spoke about their time here, the friends they had made and the exciting opportunities they pursued in the years following.\n\nThank you to all those that attended the 1996-2000 St Mark’s College Reunion and for creating a warm and interconnected evening. Reunions are a powerful way to reconnect with past friends as well as make professional contacts through the Old Collegian’s network.\n\nTo find out more about the professional development opportunities that St Mark’s College provides to students to assist with their future career pathways, click here .\n\nSt Mark’s College Library Sundowner was held on Friday 6 September in the Ian & Pamela Wall Academic Centre. A wonderful evening was enjoyed by over 25 students, staff, Old Collegians and friends of the Library as they came together to listen to Anthony Zammit deliver an enlightening talk on rare book restoration.\n\nGuests enjoyed sampling delicious wines by John Duval Wines and canapés by Sodexo whilst admiring the various rare book displays prepared by the College Librarian, Pirjo Rayner. Our interim Head of College, Darren Pitt, conducted the proceedings and Tim Duval (alumnus 2001-03) provided the commentary.\n\nGuest speaker, Anthony Zammit, a highly respected book and paper conservator and expert on rare book restoration, delivered an intriguing presentation titled “The book conservator’s point of view”. He spoke about paper conservation and his search for improved restoration techniques as well as his professional involvement as a conservation advisor and educator. He encouraged us to think about practical preventative strategies which we can take for preserving our papers, books and photographs. And finally, he reminded us that worth and value is not only measured in monetary terms, but also in terms of our emotional connection to specific materials, such as family ‘treasures’. His great passion for his profession shone through.\n\nThe library displays included the 10 rare books which had been wonderfully restored by Mr Anthony Zammit, due to the generosity of various donors who participated in our inaugural Adopt-a-Rare-Book Program (2017). Also, on display were another seven books chosen for future restoration (one was adopted on the night), as well as a selection of new books and recently donated materials.\n\nDo you have a love of rare books and are interested in participating in our Adopt-a-Rare-Book Program?
