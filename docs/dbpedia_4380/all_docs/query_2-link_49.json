That warning was taken away in writing late 2021 after I had requested to be either punished with adequate reasons or to be exonerated in writing, but the reason for the warning has (seemingly) not vanished. My research findings keep flagging issues in UK Government policies often using the values provided by UK government itself.

Rob Watson – Decentered Media: ‘I am an independent researcher who works with several universities in the East Midlands.

Catherine Scott Plummer – University of London: ‘I went to the RVC and am a vet.’\n\n1236. Grainne McKeever – Ulster University\n\n1235. Freya Papworth – Birkbeck: ‘As a student, we need this.

Debra Bales – Oregon: ‘I’m a long time supporter of free speech. I find it frustrating that ppl now censor by anger at anything being stated that instead of anger should be topics of discussion. It has become citizen on citizen censorship.’\n\n1217. Dr Emma Williamson – University of Bristol: ‘I left UoB, and academia, in 2022.

It is vital that this is not a selective process but applies to all informed and reasoned academic debates.’\n\n1206. Burzine Waghmar – SOAS: ‘A restatement of the obvious, so Orwell reminded, is the duty of the intelligent to all in base times. Pseudo-scientific bunkum about CRT, BLM, or Decolonisation is best left to an AGM of the Writers’ Union of the USSR. It has no place in a robust, forever critiquing and thinking democracy as ours.’\n\n1205. Simon Durnford – Guys Hospital, London\n\n1204. D. J. Hams – Bath University Alumnus: ‘Academia’s obligation of care to society at large means that sometimes difficult and challenging subjects must be confronted and discussed.

Dr Rostyslav Dubrovka – Queen Mary University of London\n\n1173. Omar Loubak Mohamed – Royal Holloway: ‘At my university, I have consistently tried to fight for freedom of speech.

Peter Wilkins – Cranfield University (graduate)\n\n1167.

Phillip Carter – Edge Hill University: ‘Phillip Carter. MA. Bestselling comedy author’. “As a writer and comedian, I know all too well the importance of academic freedom. Without it, universities are little more than expensive and self-absorbed affirmation groups for those who align with the uni’s chosen ideologies, and expensive reprogramming centres for those who don’t. I support academic freedom because a space where people can put forward, challenge, and discuss ideas, no matter how controversial, is a space that powers honest debate and progress.”\n\n1119. Dr Betty Jay – Senior Lecturer, Royal Holloway\n\n1118. Martin Wynne – University of Oxford:\n\n1117. Tracy Forster – Open University\n\n1116.

Andrew Elliott – (now retired; formerly International Director at Shinawatra University, Thailand): ‘I’ve been living and working away from the UK for 23 years – mostly in Thailand. My work here’s brought me into regular contact with a range of UK universities (which I’ve represented over student recruitment and inter-institutional link activities). I’m horrified by the current climate of academic unfreedom in the UK (& elsewhere) & trust the tide can be turned with a little effort, co-ordination & resourcefulness….’\n\n1100.

Ursula Edgington – Alumni: Universities of Warwick, Nottingham and Canterbury Christchurch: ‘Academia has been corrupted for a long time – academic freedoms have been deliberately censored. We need a new start that respects integrity, outside regulatory capture.’\n\n1094. S. Munirah Alatas, Ph.D. – Retired Assistant Professor, National University of Malaysia; Visiting Professor, Indonesian International Islamic University\n\n1093.

Clare B Dimyon – Retired Engineering academic: ‘We are in very dangerous territory if people form opinions & make policy based on soundbites rather than with a dispassionate examination of the evidence. In an age of mountains of data collection, the rational analysis of existing data held seems to be a seriously undervalued expertise.’\n\n1086. Arianna Andreangeli – University of Edinburgh\n\n1085.

Alessia Cibin – University of Technology Sydney\n\n1071. Christopher McDowell – City, University of London\n\n1070. Graham Gould – (formerly) King’s College London: ‘As the editor of an academic journal, I believe that freedom to dissent and to express unpopular opinions is crucial in all areas of intellectual endeavour, and I will always strive to uphold this in my editorial work and to support others who believe the same.’\n\n1069. Thomas Prosser – Cardiff University\n\n1068. Dr Robert Laverick – School of Chemistry, University of Leeds\n\n1067. Professor Ruth Jepson – University of Edinburgh\n\n1066. Firat Cengiz – University of Liverpool: ‘Scientific progress can only be achieved by discussing several different options to approach a problem. Universities and academia are increasingly distancing from scientific discourse to adopt certain positions as undiscussable truths which are also imposed on all academics and students. It is increasingly worrying how the young generation is becoming increasingly illiberal and they believe that their subjective feelings can be justification for controlling academics’ speech.’\n\n1065. Richard Hallam – Kings College London (alumnus): ‘As a retired academic without a university affiliation, I am essentially barred from submitting a paper because academic journal submission software won’t allow it. (This would also apply to an out-of-work academic). So if I want to express an opinion which relates to a social or political issue, I am censored from doing so in this format.

Carl Taylor – Queen Mary University of London: ‘I am an alumnus of QMUL, currently a UNISON member at another London University. Very sad to see UCU – colleagues of mine on recent picket line – adopting such an authoritarian stance.’\n\n1057. Veronica Howe – University College London: ‘I am appalled at the appeasement of aggressive trans activist men who are trying to erase women. I will no longer encourage my two grandsons to aim for university, it seems a toxic hotbed of social justice warriors and identity politics that can only do harm, closing down free speech and the debate of ideas’\n\n1056. Margrethe Voll Storaas (research fellow) – Norwegian School of Sport Sciences\n\n1055. Sharmini Brookes – alumna, Cardiff University: ‘Freedom of speech is the ore-requisite to all freedoms.’\n\n1054. Tamsin Evans – Middlesex University / Bristol University: ‘As a teacher of international students I find it so important that we can discuss freely global politics without fear of repercussions. Every subject should be up for scrutiny, and it is ridiculous to expect all students to conform to or even be aware of the new gender rules. The UCU has betrayed women.’\n\n1053.

Samantha Craven – University of Derby\n\n1045. Andrew Lownie – University of Buckingham: ‘Public funds were used by Southampton University to buy Earl Mountbatten’s diaries and letters on the grounds they would be open to all and then closed. I spent almost £500,000 defending an appeal brought by Southampton University against me and the Information Commissioner’s ruling that the material should be made public. This seems to me an academic institution preventing scholars accessing material bought with public funds and meant to be open for study in an unquestioning subservience to the Government.

Adam Smith – University of Lincoln\n\n1038. Matthew Brown – University of Edinburgh, undergraduate (philosophy): ‘Critical Theory is in the process of reconceptualising what it means to do research. They have their own methodology that holds truth second fiddle to the changing of the social order to be in keeping with a Neo-Marxist view of how to move toward utopia (no place). They are succeeding in this endeavour – at least the first part.\n\n1037. Robert Ashmore – Sheffield Hallam University\n\n1036. William Mackesy – Oxford/St John’s\n\n1036.
