        "text": "Richards, Martin Paul Meredith\n\nFitzwilliam Museum\n\nFounded by the bequest of Richard, Viscount Fitzwilliam, who died 5 February 1816, leaving both his collections and the annual proceeds of Â£100,000 South Sea Annuities for the erection of a Museum. After difficulties in securing a suitable site, building began in 1837, but was not complete in 1847 when the collections were moved in. The Entrance Hall was completed in 1875. The bequest of Charles Brinsley Marlay (d. 1912) comprised not only his art collections but a sum for enlarging the building (the Marlay Gallery).\n\nDirector\n\nAppointment is by a Board of Electors. The holders of this post are also Administrative Officers. From 1913, as a result of the Marlay bequest, the title of Marlay Curator was added to that of Director."
