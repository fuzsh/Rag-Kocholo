        "text": "Tonight we’ll be in Proverbs chapter 4. In way of introduction I’d like to note,\n\nThe greatest gift a father can give to his\n\nchildren is the Word of God.\n\nThe Christian faith must be purposely passed on from father to children if the faith is to progress as Jesus designed it to. The only time that angels will proclaim the Gospel is during the Great Tribulation:\n\nRevelation 14:6 (ESV) I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.\n\nEven during that time God will set out 144,000 Hebrew Evangelists (Revelation 7:4) to preach and lead the lost on the earth out of that Great Tribulation (Revelation 7:14) – though it will cost them their lives. Until that time God has called humans to spread the Word of God. We are all familiar with the Great Commission:\n\nMatthew 28:19-20 (NKJV) Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.\n\nThe Church is to spread the Gospel. But in the home, the father – as leader of the family – is to share the Word of God with his children.\n\nProverbs 4:1-4 HEAR, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. 2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 3 For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.\n\nLet’s break this down.\n\nProverbs 4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.\n\nThe father as the head of the family teaches his children to love God’s Word. In a section of scripture the Jews call “The Shema” or “The Hearing”, God tells His people:\n\nDeuteronomy 6:4-9 (NKJV) “Hear (šāmaʿ pronunciation shaw-mah’), O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! 5 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. 6 “And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. 7 You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. 8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. 9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.\n\nWord Study: The word HEAR or šāmaʿ found in Deuteronomy 6:4 and in our text at Proverbs 4:1 means not to just hear something as noise, but to “hear with the intent of obeying, to perceive and do”. There is no value in hearing something – even if it is intelligent – then doing nothing about it.\n\nIllustrate: I was talking with a pastor friend of mine this morning about the homeless problem in America. Politicians and liberal tell us if we throw enough money at it, the problem will go away. That’s not true. The only way to alleviate homelessness is to teach the homeless to be productive, and to reward productivity. The Bible is very clear on this point:\n\n1 We are to give to the poor:\n\nWe are to help poor BELIEVERS: Deuteronomy 15:7, 11 (NKJV) “If there is among you a poor man of your brethren, within any of the gates in your land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother, 11 For the poor will never cease from the land; therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor and your needy, in your land.’\n\nGalatians 6:10 (NKJV) Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.\n\nWe are to help ALL poor: Psalm 41:1 (NKJV) Blessed is he who considers the poor; The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.\n\nProverbs 19:17 (NKJV) He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, And He will pay back what he has given.\n\n2 We are not to give to those who will NOT work:\n\n2 Thessalonians 3:10-13 (ESV) For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat. 11 For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies. 12 Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. 13 As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.\n\nThe welfare system in America is a tool of Satan, for it holds down rather than lifting up. It enables bad behavior. If we love people – if we love our children – then what we do or don’t do will be modeled based on the teaching of Scripture.\n\nNot OPINION, But GOD’S WORD\n\nProverbs 4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.\n\nMany people attend Church today to get a little “sugar”, a little something “sweet” to make them feel better about themselves. Parents are instructed to spoil and give in to their children. The Bible, however, instructs fathers to “give GOOD DOCTRINE”.\n\nWhat is “GOOD DOCTRINE?”\n\nWord Study: The word translated “GOOD” is the Hebrew ṭôḇ (pronunciation tobe), which means “good, wealthy, precious, pleasant, beneficial”. This type of “GOOD” does not come from man, but from God. As God created the earth and the Heavens, the Scripture says:\n\n“God saw the light, that it was GOOD (ṭôḇ)” (Genesis 1:4)\n\n“God called the dry land Earth … it was GOOD (ṭôḇ)”\n\n(Genesis 1:10)\n\n“God saw everything He had made … it was very GOOD (ṭôḇ)”\n\n(Genesis 1:31)\n\nWhat God made is GOOD (ṭôḇ). God alone has the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of GOOD (ṭôḇ) and evil (Genesis 2:17). It is God, not man who establishes what is GOOD (ṭôḇ). The Bible teaches is that:\n\n“There is NONE GOOD but One, that is, God” (Matthew 19:17)\n\n“All have gone astray … there is NONE THAT DOETH GOOD,\n\nno, not one (Psalm 14:3)\n\nHuman good is no good at all. When the father says “I give you GOOD DOCTRINE (leqaḥ pronunciation leh’-kakh, learning, teaching)”, this is not based on his opinion, but on what God has said. Further, the father says:\n\nProverbs 4:2 … forsake ye not my law.\n\nHe is not saying that this is truths that he made up, but as a believer he has assumed ownership of the Word that God gave him.\n\nThe Apostle Paul did the same thing with the Gospel of salvation when he said:\n\nRomans 2:16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.\n\nRomans 16:25 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ …\n\n2 Timothy 2:8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:\n\nThe Apostle Paul did not write the Gospel, but he assumed ownership and stewardship of it without changing it. It became “MY GOSPEL”. We as believers are to be so appreciative of the Word of God that we, like Paul and the writer of Proverbs, call the text “MY DOCTRINE”. God gave it to us as a stewardship – and we are to share it with others that we love.\n\nProverbs 4:3-4 For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.\n\nThe writer tells us that “I was my father’s son”. He was loved of his father, for his father taught him the Heavenly Father’s Word. He was “only beloved” in the sight of his mother. Why was Solomon “only beloved” of his mother? Solomon was not the firstborn child of King David. The firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess. The second-born was Daniel by Abigail the Carmelitess, and the third-born Absalom the son of Maacah. While David was in Jerusalem, he had four children by Bathsheba: Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon. (see 1 Chronicles 3:1-9). If you’re counting, Solomon was actually the seventh-born child of David.\n\nWhy did David choose Solomon his son to reign in his place (1 Chronicles 29:28)? Why didn’t David follow the regular succession, and choose the firstborn Amnon to succeed him?\n\nThe Bible gives us the answer in:\n\n1 Chronicles 22:7-10 (NKJV) … David said to Solomon: “My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the Lord my God; 8 but the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight. 9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. 10 He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’\n\nThe reason that David chose Solomon to succeed him is because God chose Solomon to be the successor. David said “THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME”. God called Solomon to succeed David, because SOLOMON BELIEVED IN GOD AND HIS WORD. Solomon was a born again believer. God said of him, “he shall be My son, and I will be his Father”.\n\nGod established the Throne of David through a believer, not through unbelievers. God blesses those who hear and DO His Word. David was “a man after God’s own heart” (Acts 13:22) because, though flawed as we all are, he cherished and looked for God’s Word. David said of God’s Word:\n\nPsalm 119:47-48 (ESV) … for I find my delight in your commandments, which I love. 48 I will lift up my hands toward your commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on your statutes.\n\nAnd again,\n\nPsalm 119:2-3 (ESV) … Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart, 3 who also do no wrong, but walk in his ways!\n\nSolomon was like his father in this. He sought the Word of the Lord.\n\nWisdom – The Application Of God’s Word –\n\nWill Richly Bless You\n\nProverbs 4:5-8 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. 7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. 8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.\n\nWord Study: WISDOM – the ability to not only know what the Scripture says, but the ability to USE it – “is the principal thing”. The phrase “THE PRINCIPLE THING” is the Hebrew rē’šîṯ {pronunciation ray-sheeth’}, which means “that which is chief or best, the choicest”. Again, to understand this word we have to go back to the Creation of all things. The word rē’šîṯ is the very first word in the Bible:\n\nGenesis 1:1 IN THE BEGINNING{rē’šîṯ} God created the heaven and the earth.\n\nWisdom is from Heaven. It is from God. It is the foundation of EVERYTHING. To have wisdom in your life is to be blessed beyond measure. James 3:17 says:\n\n“the wisdom that comes from Heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere”.\n\nProverbs 4:9-13 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. 10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. 11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. 12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.\n\nBiblical wisdom – the ability to not just know what the Scripture says, but to put it into action – leads to\n\nGRACE\n\nA CROWN OF GLORY\n\nLONG LIFE\n\nA STEADY WALK\n\nWithout applying Biblical knowledge, you cannot be saved. The Bible says that:\n\nRomans 10:9 (NKJV) if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.You can know that you are a sinner in need of salvation. But unless you “CONFESS” Jesus as Lord, and do so PUBLICLY, you cannot be saved. Jesus said:\n\nMatthew 10:33 … whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.\n\nGrace is a free gift from God, but it is not received in secret. When Noah found grace in the eyes of God (Genesis 6:8), the Lord told him to build an Ark – and do so publicly. If you do not both HEAR and DO what Jesus says, you will not be saved.\n\nWisdom – the application of Biblical knowledge – brings “A CROWN OF GLORY”. The Crown of Glory is mentioned in Peter in reference to God Called Pastors who do their jobs:\n\n1 Peter 5:1-4 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 3 Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being examples to the flock. 4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\n\nThe Pastor who cares for the Church God has entrusted him with, who FEEDS the flock the Word of God, who is not authoritarian or power hungry, who does not do it for money but who models Christ – this Pastor shall receive the Crown of Glory. The Crown of Glory is given to those who effectively use the spiritual gifts that God has entrusted to them for HIS glory and honor. It doesn’t apply to just the Pastor, but to every member in the Body of Christ. A devotional at Ligonier Ministries notes:\n\n“… even though our salvation is a gift we do not earn, our Father not only promises eternal life to those who follow His Son, He promises many extra rewards to those who obey Him. This promise of extra blessings is found throughout the Bible. To the people of Israel already saved from the bondage of slavery, God promised many blessings if they would persevere in their obedience to Him (Deut. 28:1–14). Jesus promised that those who would leave everything to follow Him would receive a hundredfold reward in addition to eternal life (Mark 10:29–31). … God’s faithful servants can expect a reward. … And in the end, this reward will be for God’s glory, for one day we will cast these crowns at the foot of His throne in worship (Revelation 4:9–11; 22:3).”\n\nThose who love the Lord and His Word will be granted a long and stable life. Oh, that we all would realize that the greatest blessing is not the land of Canaan nor the glory of Heaven. The greatest blessing is to live the life that God has given you under His watchful eye, doing what He says until the day you are received into glory.\n\nAmen and Amen.\n\nHebrews 5:10-14 {Jesus} Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek. 11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull (nōthros, pronunciation no-thros’, means SLOTHFUL, SLUGGISH, LAZY) of hearing. 12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. 13 For every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.\n\nThe Danger Of Becoming Stalled In Your Faith\n\nWhy is it important that you not only hear the Word of God, but do the Word of God? It is because you can never advance and mature as Christ followers unless your hearts are opened to Him, unless you see His Word as the most valuable thing on earth – then apply that Word. The Book of Hebrews has been comparing the House of Moses (the Old Covenant) to the House of Christ (The New Covenant). We found out that God spoke to His people through both Moses and Jesus Christ. We found out that:\n\nThe Old Covenant relied on animal sacrifices and ceremonies to provide a temporary salvation.\n\nThe New Covenant relies on the once and for all sacrifice of Christ to provide a permanent salvation.\n\nThe Old Covenant was offered to ethnic Jews, and the Gentiles who would agree to circumcision.\n\nThe New Covenant relies on the work of the Holy Spirit to circumcise the heart of a person. Through the Spirit we are born again, born into the family of God.\n\nThe Old Covenant relied on fallen humans as priests to cover the sins of the people.\n\nThe New Covenant relies on the sinless Jesus Christ, God Incarnate, Who sits on the right hand of the Father covering our sins.\n\nThe Old Covenant was but a shadow of the coming New Covenant in Christ. The moral laws have not changed, but Atonement has.\n\nUnder the Old Covenant the Tribe of Judah led God’s people, whereas the Tribe of Levi ministered as priests. Messiah would come from the Tribe of Judah. Kings could not be priests.\n\nUnder the New Covenant Jesus, of the Tribe of Judah and the House of David, is the promised Messiah. Jesus is a High Priest of the Order of Melchizedek, an ancient priesthood that predates Mount Sinai. Jesus is both King and Priest, and the children of God by faith in Christ are Kings and Priests unto God (Revelation 1:5-6). We are children of the Most High.\n\nJesus is a High Priest of the order of Melchizedek, & there are many great truths that go with this that bless us. But the lazy listeners hear but refuse to do the commands of God’s Word.\n\nMany today are like the children of Israel at the base of Mount Sinai, demanding that Aaron create them a Golden Calf. When Israel left Egyptian bondage that God moved on the hearts of the Egyptians, and “Israel borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver and gold” (Exodus 12:35). When Israel came to Aaron and demanded “gods that shall go before us” (Exodus 32:1), the High Priest told the people to bring him the blessing that God bestowed on them at Egypt. He took that blessing, those jewels – and created a golden calf (Exodus 32:4).\n\nGod’s people are called to be salt, not sugar. We are called to hear God’s Word, and DO those things which glorify Him. We are not to make golden calves of God’s blessings to us. Those whom God is addressing should be mature believers, teachers of others. But instead they have become dull of hearing. They are lazy hearers. The lazy hearer hears what is being preached or taught, and is probably fascinated by it.\n\nThe lazy hearer rejects the MEAT but wants the MILK of the Word. Our text states:\n\nHebrews 5:12 are become such as have need of milk\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being a “babe in Christ” when you are first saved. Newly saved believers should want the “pure milk of the word”\n\n1 Peter 2:1-3 (NKJV) Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, 2 as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, 3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.\n\nEvery Christian is a baby when they are first born again (John 3:3, 7; 1 Peter 1:23). As you study God’s Word, you will grow. God has promised, “My Word will not return to Me void, but it shall do whatsoever I please” (Isaiah 55:11). But you must DO what God directs.\n\nThe Hebrew Christians had “BECOME” in need of milk. They brought this condition on themselves by their failure to live in Christ, to\n\nRomans 13:14 … put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.\n\nSaved by Grace, as Christians we\n\nEphesians 4:1-3, 24 (NKJV) …. walk worthy of the calling with which you were called, 2 with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love, 3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. … 24 … put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness.\n\nSalvation is by Grace – but sanctification and growth is by spiritual effort.\n\nThe Blood of Christ POSITIONALLY makes us right with God. Our partnership with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Bible PRACTICALLY let’s us walk with God.\n\nGod gave us salvation so that we might positionally be righteous, righteous because of Christ. But once positionally righteous, God wants us to be practically righteous. We are to be salt and light, not sugar and darkness. God did not save us so we could be gossips, homosexuals, transgenders, adulterers, murderers, kidnappers, thieves – in short, walk in the flesh. God saved us by the blood of Christ so that we might walk according to the Spirit of God:\n\nRomans 8:2-8 (NKJV) … the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 6 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. 8 So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God.\n\nThe thought that Christ died for our sins so we could remain in our sins is foreign to the Scripture. The Scripture says:\n\n1 Peter 2:24 (ESV) {Jesus} Himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.\n\nGod did not save us just to send us to Heaven. He saved us to make us children of God by faith in Christ (Galatians 3:26). As the Apostle John noted:\n\n1 John 3:10 whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.\n\nWe are to love our God, and keep His commandments (1 John 5:2).\n\nHebrew 5:13-14 For every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 14 But STRONG MEAT BELONGETH TO THEM THAT ARE OF A FULL AGE, even those who by reason of use have THEIR SENSES EXERCISED TO DISCERN BOTH GOOD AND EVIL …\n\nThe Christian who learns to not only HEAR but to DO what God has said is able to “DISCERN BOTH GOOD AND EVIL”. That Christian understands WHY something is right and WHY something is wrong. The Christian that not only HEARS the Word of Christ but DOES it has the ability to make godly, adult decisions. Children, on the other hand, often make bad decisions because they don’t know any better. Listen Beloved,\n\nIt is not PHYSICAL age that makes a mature Christian. It is SPIRITUAL OBEDIENCE and APPLICATION of the Scripture to your life.\n\nYou cannot, as a Christian, “DISCERN BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL” unless you are applying the Word of God to your life. When asked, “Why is homosexuality incompatible with the Christian way of life?”, you cannot answer this if you have never graduated from milk to meat. When asked, “What is Biblical marriage?”, or “Why do you think Jesus is the only Way to be saved – don’t you think that’s a bit intolerant?”, babies cannot answer this. “STRONG MEAT BELONGS TO THOSE OF FULL AGE”, Christians who not only read but DO what God’s Word says.\n\nThe First Principles Of The Oracles Of God\n\nHebrews 6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God\n\nThe “First Principles Of The Oracles Of God” mentioned in Hebrews 5:12 are the foundational doctrines or truths that the Christian life is built on. The very FIRST foundational truth is “the doctrine of Christ”. The Doctrine of Christ is not only mentioned here, but also in:\n\n2 John 1:9-11 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.\n\nThe “DOCTRINE OF CHRIST” is the belief that there is no salvation outside of faith in Jesus Christ. He is the Only Savior. The Doctrine teaches that, once saved by faith, you are saved into a Family, the Family of God. You no longer belong to yourself, but are a purchased possession, a child of God. The Doctrine of Christ teaches that He Who saves you is also the One you wish to please and follow. Jesus said:\n\nMatthew 4:19 … Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.\n\nMatthew 8:22 … Follow Me; and let the dead bury their dead.\n\nMatthew 16:24 … Deny yourself, take up your Cross, and Follow Me\n\nMatthew 19:21 … Come and Follow Me …\n\nJohn 10:27 … My sheep … Follow Me\n\nJohn 12:26 … If any one serve Me, let them Follow Me …\n\nThe Doctrine of Christ is the doctrine of ABIDING. We cling to Jesus, like a branch to a vine (John 15:4-11).\n\nJohn 15:5 I am the Vine, ye are the branches: He that ABIDE (menō, cling to, remain in) in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing.\n\nEvery work that the Christian does is built on the FOUNDATION OF CHRIST:\n\n1 Corinthians 3:11 (ESV) For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\n\nIt is Jesus Who saves you, His Blood which covers your sins, His High Priesthood that maintains your status as a Child of God in the Father’s eyes. We live to glorify our Lord Jesus!\n\nWhat is the next foundational truth?\n\nHebrews 6:1 … the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,\n\n“repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God” is key to the Christian way of life. Everyone fails at times. Everyone sins. What does the Christian do when we sin? Do we do PENANCE before God? Do we sacrifice animals, or beat ourselves with whips, or promise to do better? Every human action that attempts to bring us righteousness before God is a DEAD WORK. The Scripture says:\n\nIsaiah 64:6 (NKJV) But we are all like an unclean thing, And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away.\n\nWe cannot make ourselves RIGHT with God. Only CHRIST can make us right with God. When the Apostle Paul examined his own life – an Apostle – an APOSTLE I say – he declared:\n\nRomans 7:18 … I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.\n\nRomans 7:24 … Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?\n\nBut then Paul cries out in verse 25, “I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!”. When we as believers sin, we REPENT and RETURN TO WHERE SALVATION IS. We do not strive to do penance, but we do REPENTANCE. Just as we were saved, we enter into His presence through the door of REPENTANCE. We put our faith in Him Who loved us, and gave Himself for us.\n\nYou Can Be Judas, Or You Can Be Simon Peter\n\nWho failed Jesus – Judas Iscariot or Simon Peter? If you answered BOTH, you’d be right.\n\nWhen Jesus was telling the disciples that He had to go to the Cross for our sins, Peter rebuked Jesus, and said, “No, this will not happen to You!”. Jesus rebuked Peter, saying:\n\nMatthew 16:23 … “Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.”\n\nPeter had left the foundation of Christ and began to follow the flesh. He was rebuked. Later Peter told Jesus,\n\nMatthew 26:33 … (NKJV) … Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble\n\nPeter was heavily relying not on the power of God, but of his flesh, his own strength. Jesus told Peter,\n\nMatthew 26:34 (NKJV) … Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.\n\nJesus knows us better that we know ourselves. Peter continued to argue with the Lord. “Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!” (vs 35). What happened? Jesus went to Gethsemane. While praying in Gethsemane, Peter couldn’t stay awake to pray with Jesus. When the soldiers came, Peter cut off a man’s ear, and was rebuked by Jesus (Matthew 26:52). Peter then ran away with the others. As Jesus was being tried, a servant girl saw Peter and said, “You were with Jesus of Galilee” (Matthew 26:69). Peter denied Jesus. Another young girl saw Peter and said, “That man was with Jesus of Nazareth” (Matthew 26:71). Again, Peter denied Jesus. Finally, several in the crowd spoke up. “You are one of Jesus’ men – your speech betrays you!” (Matthew 26:73). Peter swore and cursed, saying “I do not know Jesus!”.\n\nAnd the rooster crowed. Peter left, weeping bitterly.\n\nThen there was Judas Iscariot. He had all the blessings that the other disciples had. Judas was an Apostle, just as was Peter and the others. Judas had the power to heal the sick, and to preach the Gospel. As the disciples were sharing the Last Passover together, Jesus honored Judas and gave him the “sop”, a special honor, the Bible says “Satan entered Judas” (John 13:27) and Judas left the table to betray Jesus to the Pharisees for thirty pieces of silver. Interestingly, it was not long after this that Jesus told Peter that before the rooster crowed, he would deny Him three times (John 13:38).\n\nYou all know the story. Judas left the Table, and Jesus, after teaching the disciples a few more truths, instituted the Lord’s Table. Judas contracted with the Chief Priests and Pharisees to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. When Jesus went to Gethsemane for His final prayer prior to His trial, He was abandoned by all His disciples. Judas betrayed Jesus with a kiss. Jesus was tried, convicted, beaten, and carried before Pilate to be executed (Matthew 27:2). What happened to Judas?\n\nMatthew 27:3-5 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. 5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.\n\nJudas “repented himself”. He did not repent, and return to God. Judas “repented himself”. He tried to do penance instead of repentance. He did not go to God for forgiveness, but tried his own do it yourself religion. He thought by bringing the 30 pieces of silver back, that all would be well. It wasn’t. Finally, Judas killed himself, sacrificing his own life to make what he did right with God. Did it? No. Jesus called Judas “the son of perdition”, the “son of apōleia, of waste or destruction, of damnation” (John 17:12). Though Judas had the title of Apostle, though he was chosen by Jesus but “was a DEVIL” (John 6:70). Judas is the picture of many who PROFESS Christ, but are not POSSESSED of Christ.\n\nThe Devil enter Judas Iscariot and Simon Peter,\n\nbut only one repented and believed.\n\nPeter denied Jesus also. He wasn’t at the foot of the Cross with Mary his mother and John the Apostle. Mary Magdalene, and Mary of Cleophas was at the foot of the Cross, but Peter was absent (Matthew 27:55-56; Mark 15:40-41; Luke 23:49; John 21:24). But on the first day of the week, when the women ran back to tell the disciples that Jesus had risen from the dead, both Peter and John ran to the Tomb – but Peter was the first to enter the Tomb. John got to the Tomb first, but Peter went in to see where His Lord lay. The Bible tells us that the first man to see Jesus resurrected was PETER:\n\n1 Corinthians 15:5 {after His resurrection Jesus} WAS SEEN BY CEPHAS, THEN by the TWELVE.\n\n“CEPHAS” is the Aramaic form of “Peter”, which is the name Jesus gave Peter once he recognized our Lord as the one and only Christ (Matthew 16:18). According to the Apostle Paul, Jesus appeared to Peter FIRST before He appeared to the other Apostles. Why? Because Jesus has promised us:\n\n“I will never leave YOU nor forsake YOU” (Hebrews 13:5)\n\nPeter belonged to Jesus by faith. And it was proved by his actions. In the final chapter on John’s Gospel, Peter was out fishing in the Sea of Tiberius with 6 others – including John. They fished all night long and found nothing. As they were coming toward shore, a Man called out:\n\nJohn 21:5 (NKJV) … Children, have you any food?\n\nWhen they said “No”, the Man said “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some”. As they hauled in the net, now filled with fish, John said “It is the Lord Jesus!” As soon as Peter heard this,\n\nJohn 21:7 … {Peter} put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and plunged into the sea.\n\nPeter never tried to do penance. He never tried to make things right with his own works. Peter understood the basic foundation of Christianity is not our works, but to RUN TO JESUS. When we fail, we RUN TO JESUS. When we sin, we RUN TO JESUS. Our works cannot make things right – but Jesus can. And once we return to Jesus, we do that which Jesus tells us to do. Jesus asked Peter three times\n\n“Do you love Me?”\n\nPeter replied, “Yes Lord, You know I love you” (John 21:16). And Jesus said, FEED MY SHEEP. Do what I tell you to do. Cling to Me, as I cling to you. Obey Me if you love Me. If you fail Me, repent, and return to Me. I am your Lord, your Savior, your all.\n\nThat is the foundation our faith is built on – Jesus. Do you know Him? Have you received Him by faith? Have you repented, and come to Him with empty hands to receive the glorious Gospel of salvation. I pray you have. May God the Holy Spirit work in your heart today. Amen and Amen.\n\nProverbs 3:13-18 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. 14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. 15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. 16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor. 17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.\n\nOpening: In Sri Lanka a man had hired a well dug in his back yard. While workmen were digging – looking for water – they found a star sapphire cluster. Since it was on his property, it belonged to him. He had it appraised through a gem trader and found out the 2.5 million carat sapphire is worth up to $100 million. The owner named it the “Serendipity Sapphire”. If you found it in your back yard, it wouldn’t look like anything at all to you. You might have rolled it out to the trash pickup. You’d have been wrong!\n\nGold is much like this sapphire. The inexperienced may find gold, but never know it’s gold, because it looks like dirty quartz until its refined. What looks like gold when you find it is Iron Pyrite, Chalcopyrite or Fool’s Gold. Gold, which isn’t golden until it’s processed, is worth $2336.30an ounce as of April 23, 2024. Fool’s Gold is worth .55 cents per ounce.\n\nThe miner is a person who has studied gold and it’s value. The miner knows how to prospect for gold, and how to ignore the false. Had the man who discovered the Serendipity Sapphire not been acquainted with gemstones, he would have tossed out this Guinness Book of World Records (largest star sapphire cluster ever found) stone.\n\nAs valuable as the Serendipity Sapphire is, there is something much greater in value. It is WISDOM.\n\nWisdom cannot be stolen from you. This is why the Bible says:\n\nvs 14 the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver\n\nLearn To Mine Wisdom From God’s Word, Not Rock From the Earth\n\nSilver, gold, and diamonds can be easily stolen. Money in your bank account can be easily stolen. Hackers can get into your bank, and get all you have. Or bank tellers can push a wrong button, and your life savings is gone. Poof. Just like that.\n\nIllustrate: Several years ago I left my silver coin sets out on a table in my home. While Sherry and I were gone out, thieves broke in and stole a lot of the silver. Oddly enough, they grabbed the shiniest pieces which, worth much, were not worth as much as they left behind. In the world of Numismatics (pronounced noo-miz-ma-ticks) it is the older, often dingier looking coin that is much more valuable. The fools go for the “Fool’s Gold”, but the wise know real value. Wisdom can be gained, and should be accrued as you grow. That wisdom you have cannot be taken away from you. You can only give it away, blessing others. We are told:\n\nVs 15 more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her\n\nWord Study: Sapphires and Rubies are of the same mineral called corundum. When it forms blue, it’s a sapphire. When red, it’s a ruby. God is telling us that – as valuable as the Serendipity Sapphire is – WISDOM is much more “PRECIOUS” (yāqār), “more excellent, more costly”. In fact,\n\nThe Lord tells us that if you were to take everything you’ve ever desired – money, power, fame, good looks – wisdom would be worth more than it all.\n\nThe ancient Philosopher Plato said, “Better be unborn than untaught, for ignorance is the root of misfortune”. Wisdom from God teaches us to live our lives in joy and peace. Properly applied wisdom brings blessing. The Scripture says:\n\nVs 16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.\n\nWe’ve seen this before in Proverbs. Throughout the Proverbs God expresses the same thing using different poetic language. When we studied verse 2 of this chapter last week:\n\nProverbs 3:2 … for LENGTH OF DAYS and LONG LIFE … shall they add to you ..\n\nWe found out that “LENGTH OF DAYS” and “LONG LIFE” refers to QUANTITY as well as QUALITY of life. The same thing is true here. Wisdom is shown as a woman who, in her RIGHT hand has “Length of days”. Throughout the Scripture the RIGHT HAND was the hand of blessing.\n\nIllustration: When Israel (Jacob) blessed Joseph’s children before he died, he laid his right hand on the second born child, Ephraim. When Joseph objected – for the firstborn was to be blessed with the right hand – Israel said:\n\n“God will make Ephraim (the second born) as Manasseh” (Genesis 48:20)\n\nThe Right Hand of God is where the Son of God sits (Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33; Acts 7:55-56; Romans 8:34). When you heed God’s Word, His Wisdom, you are blessed by the Son of God.\n\nRiches And Honor Are Not From The World, But God\n\nWhen you are under Wisdom’s right hand, with it comes the LEFT HAND. In Wisdom’s left hand is “RICHES AND HONOR”. Riches and honor does not mean to have a full bank account. It means to LIVE A GOOD LIFE IN CHRIST. King David prayed in:\n\n1 Chronicles 29:10-12 (NKJV) Blessed are You, Lord God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever. 11 Yours, O Lord, is the greatness, The power and the glory, The victory and the majesty; For all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, And You are exalted as head over all. 12 Both riches and honor come from You, And You reign over all. In Your hand is power and might; In Your hand it is to make great And to give strength to all.\n\nLonger life as well as a blessed life is promised to those who seek out and cherish wisdom. Silver, gold, and sapphires can buy you things, but they cannot add one minute to your life. Often those who are richest in material wealth are the most miserable of people.\n\nWisdom not only protects you from misery, but it\n\nprotects you from an early death.\n\nThe unwise person runs around with other foolish people who do things that endanger their lives. They drink alcohol to excess, or take dangerous drugs, or as a few years ago, eat Tide™ pods. Why? Because you are trying to impress someone who could care less about you. If you want a good life, we should mine for Wisdom through God’s Word.\n\nProverbs 3:17-18 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold (ḥāzaq, pronounced khaw-zak’, to grab with all your strength) upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth (tāmaḵ, pronounced taw-mak’, to hold fast, to stay close to) her.\n\nAgain we have a picture of the miner, who goes outside his comfort zone to find gold. He dedicates his life to seeking out the true gold. It is so sad that we as Americans today will burn up all our energy on jobs, hobbies, games, politics, television, social media, foods, and so on – but will devote little time to God and His Word. The writer of Ecclesiastes states:\n\nEcclesiastes 9:16-18 … Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, And his words are not heard. 17 Words of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard rather than the shout of a ruler of fools. 18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war; But one sinner destroys much good.\n\nWisdom does not matter whose hands it is in. The “poor man’s wisdom” is much greater than the rich man’s foolishness. I am reminded of the story Jesus told us of Lazarus and the rich man. The rich man – well respected, famous, and blessed financially – ignored Biblical Wisdom, the Word of God, and lived his life as if there was no God. He had no respect for human life, but treated the poor as dogs, even wild dogs. Lazarus, on the other hand, was known by Jesus. Jesus knew his name. JESUS KNEW HIS NAME.\n\nWord Study: He was “Lazarus” (lazaros, pronunciation lad’-zar-os) which means “The One Whom God Helps”. The rich man helped himself year after year, ignoring God, having no relationship with Him. But Lazarus looked to God for blessing, and trusted in His Grace though times were often tough. When they died, what happened?\n\nLuke 16:22-23 {Lazarus} died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.\n\nLazarus had wisdom. He looked to God, the Author of True Wisdom. Having wisdom, Lazarus had “RICHES AND HONOR”. What! You say he has “RICHES AND HONOR”? You’re mad, he was a BEGGAR. Those who are saved are all BEGGARS at the Throne of Grace. When Lazarus died, he had “RICHES” for he was known of Jesus. In this life Lazarus had nothing, but in the next life he was taken to Father Abraham, the father of all who believe (see Romans 4:16). When Lazarus died, he had “HONOR”. He was given an ANGELIC ESCORT into glory, where he could be comforted in the arms of God.\n\nGod’s Word Brought Order From Darkness\n\nProverbs 3:19-20 The Lord by wisdom hath founded (yāsaḏ, pronunciation yaw-sad’) the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. 20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.\n\nWord Study: It is God’s “WISDOM” that lay the foundation of the earth. It is by Christ “all things CONSIST” (Colossians 1:17), Greek synistēmi (pronunciation soon-is’-tay-mee) which means “are held together”. The Scripture says “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.” (Psalm 33:6).\n\nIt was not evolution that created earth and its environment. It was not man, nor any creature that brought about creation. It was God. It is God Who sustains all things by His Word. Compare that to the wisdom of man, the wisdom of the rich.\n\nRich people on the Massachusetts coast spent $500,000.00 to build sand dunes in front of the beach front property. It was washed away in three days! What of God’s creation? Earth is in a remote part of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. The only star near us is the sun, which is placed a perfect distance from the earth. How long will our sun last? Scientists calculate that the fuel of the sun, hydrogen, will run out in 5 BILLION years, but once it runs out will take 2-3 BILLION years to go through star death. What the rich fools did cost half a million dollars and lasted three days. What God did in the sun will last another 7.5 BILLION years.\n\nThe molten magnetic core of the earth not only helps us find North and South, but protects us from sun flares. The energy emitted by a solar flare is a million times more powerful than a volcanic eruption on earth.\n\nThe giant planet Jupiter protects the earth by eating up asteroids or comets that come near. It has been called “the vacuum cleaner of our solar system”. Our moon stabilizes our climate. God’s hand of design is seen all throughout creation.It is God’s Word that designed the rain clouds, and the cycle of water that sustains life on our planet.\n\nProverbs 3:21-23 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep (nāṣar pronunciation naw-tsar’) sound wisdom and discretion: 22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. 23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.\n\nWord Study: The believer in God is encouraged to “KEEP or GUARD SOUND WISDOM”. The stepbrother of Christ wrote:\n\nJames 3:13-18 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. 15 This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic. 16 For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there. 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. 18 Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.\n\nThe Wisdom of God is based on God Himself. It is SPIRITUAL, not fleshly and self serving. “the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace”. God used His Word to give us life, and offers His Word to save us.\n\nThe Wise Live To Honor The God Who Saved Them:\n\n5 Applications Of Wisdom\n\nAt this point Proverbs 3 God uses 5 verse sets to teach Biblical truth. Let’s look at these texts:\n\nProverbs 3:25-26 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. 26 For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.\n\n1 Don’t worry about what your enemy may or may not do. Trust in the Lord. Let Him avenge you:\n\nRomans 12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\n\nProverbs 3:27-28 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. 28 Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.\n\n2 If God in Grace has given you the means to do so, do good to your fellow man. Jesus spoke of this when He said:\n\nMatthew 5:42-48 (ESV) Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you. 43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? 48 You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n\n3 Be Light, Not Darkness To Those Around You.\n\nProverbs 3:29-30 Devise not evil against thy neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. 30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.\n\nWho is your neighbor? It is not the person who looks like you, but the person near you. Jesus explained this with the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37). In that story a man of unknown race and heritage was attacked, stripped, and left on the side of the road as dead. A “Priest”, more than likely a Levite who functioned in the office of priest in the Temple, actually crossed the road when he saw the wounded man. Then a “Levite”, a person from the Tribe of Levi who worked in the Temple taking care of the things of God, also crossed the road rather than help the wounded man. Both Priest and Levite wanted to avoid being made “unclean” by touching this unfortunate.\n\nThen came the Samaritan, the hated Samaritan. He bound the man’s wounds, took him to an inn, and payed for his accommodations. Jesus asked,\n\nLuke 10:36 (ESV) Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\n\nIt was the Samaritan who showed mercy. He was the neighbor. Jesus commands that we “go and do likewise” (37).\n\n4 Do not imitate or desire what evil people have. Desire God.\n\nProverbs 3:31-32 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. 32 For the froward (lûz, the perverse) is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous.\n\nThe “SECRET” of God is His personal presence and favor. Evil people may have riches and fame for a time, but they do not have what you have – a relationship with God each day of your life. I admire the Old Testament Saint Enoch. Enoch was born of Jared, and Jared lived 962 years. But Enoch lived 65 years before he had his first son Methuselah. He walked with God another 300 years, outliving all of his children and family but Methuselah. The Bible says:\n\nGenesis 5:24 Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.\n\n5 In time, God will bless His Children, but curse the wicked. Be patient. We end with these words:\n\nProverbs 3:33-35 The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. 34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. 35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.\n\nOur God “giveth grace unto the lowly”. To those who are arrogant and perverse, God gives them their head. But a payday is coming someday. But God gives Grace to those who are humble. The Bible says:\n\nJames 4:6 (ESV) … {God} gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”\n\nYoung and immature believers tend toward arrogance, but God tells us to “clothe ourselves with humility” (1 Peter 5:5). We are to hear and do His Word. This is the only way to blessing. May God move on our hearts this very day. Amen.\n\nHebrews 5:1-6 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: 2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. 3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. 4 And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. 5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. 6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.\n\nJesus Came To Lead Israel From Old Covenant\n\nTo New Covenant\n\nI do a lot of reading – and studying – because I’m fascinated with the Bible. I read an article the other day from a College Professor (Emeritus, City University of N.Y) named Bernard Starr (Ph.D). This learned man made the statement:\n\n“Christianity began as a Jewish sect and that Jesus was a thoroughly dedicated practicing Jew who never suggested the launch of a new religion … Jesus lived and died a dedicated Jew, as observed by Christian writer Jean Guitton in his book ‘Great Heresies and Church Councils’ … Jesus did not mean to found a new religion. In his historical humanity, Jesus was a devout Israelite, practicing the law to the full, from circumcision to Pesach, paying the half-shekel for the Temple. Jerusalem, the capital of his nation, was the city he loved: Jesus wept over it”.\n\nAs many of the “great theologians” of the Scripture have done, they often ignore passages of Scripture while pushing their own doctrines. Jesus was a Jew, born of the lineage of David, of the Tribe of Judah. The Bible says that as Messiah:\n\nJohn 1:11-12 (NKJV) {Jesus} came unto His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them gave He the right to become children of God, to those who believe in his name …\n\nJesus came to the Jews first, the Messiah, to save whosoever would believe in Him. Jesus followed the laws of Judaism insofar as they were correctly interpreted. Jesus said,\n\nMatthew 5:17-18 (NKJV) … Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy, BUT TO FULFILL. 18 till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled ..\n\nJesus Came To Make The New Covenant Possible:Jesus came to fulfill the Law of God, the Ceremonial and Sacrificial portions that were shadows that would be fulfilled by the Messiah. The Bible is very clear that “the Law was a SHADOW OF THE GOOD THINGS TO COME” (Hebrews 10:1). The Feasts and Animal Sacrifices could not make a permanent covering for sin. The Messiah would have to come and, being perfect and holy, without sin, He would have to willingly go to an altar of sacrifice for sinners. His blood being shed would provide a covering for sin once and for all. As we are told in:\n\nHebrews 7:27 (NKJV) {Jesus} does not need daily, as those high priests {of Israel}, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the people’s, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.\n\nJesus came to fulfill the Law of Moses, but He did not save us from the Law of Moses to bring in a new religion, but a NEW COVENANT. Jesus made this clear when He instituted the “Lord’s Table” out of the Feast of the Passover. Giving His disciples the “cup” of new wine, He said:\n\nMatthew 26:28 For this is my blood of the new (kainos, “recently made, a new kind of, unprecedented, novel, unheard of, new or fresh”)testament (diathēkē, a covenant, a will or “testament” like “last will & testament”), which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\n\nMark 14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new (kainos)testament (diathēkē), which is shed for many.\n\nLuke 22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new (kainos)testament (diathēkē)in my blood, which is shed for you.\n\nGod spoke of this New Covenant to His Old Testament Israel through the Prophet\n\nJeremiah 31:31-24 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: 33 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. 34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.\n\nUnder the Old Covenant that God gave Israel, the Law of God was given through Moses. The Law was proscriptive, but not prescriptive. It showed man to be a sinner, but did nothing to eradicate the sin – it only temporarily covered the sin. Under the New Covenant God would address the heart. He would cause people to be born again, Children of the Kingdom of God. When God speaks of “the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah”, this is a reference to a divided Israel – one that through civil war became North & South. The “house of Israel” or Northern Israel rejected the Levitical Priesthood and the Temple. Ten Tribes in revolt, they left Judah and Benjamin and started their own system of worship with Samaria as their Capital City. The “house of Judah” or Southern Israel (Judah and Benjamin) kept Jerusalem as their Capital City, and continued to worship in the Temple – though they were not obedient to God.\n\nIsrael was divided, conquered, and ineffective because they failed to keep the Old Covenant, and largely rejected the New Covenant that Jesus brought.\n\nJesus told us that\n\nMatthew 12:25 Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand …\n\nJesus Christ was born of the Tribe of Judah, the Ruling Tribe, and is the fulfillment of God’s Prophecy to King David:\n\n2 Samuel 7:12-13 … when thy days be fulfilled {when you leave this earth}, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.\n\nThe “Seed of David” from the Tribe of Judah is Jesus Christ. God sent His Son Jesus to “BUILD A HOUSE FOR MY NAME”. God was not speaking of a Temple, but of a People. The Apostle tells us:\n\n1 Corinthians 3:16-17 (ESV) Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? 17 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.\n\nWhere God’s people gather together in Christ’s name, we are His Temple. Our focus is on Jesus!\n\nUnder The Old Covenant, The High Priest Was Broken\n\nHebrews 5:1-3 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: 2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. 3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.\n\nGod appointed Aaron, the brother of Moses, to be the “High Priest” of Israel under the Old Covenant. As High Priest Aaron (and his children) were to offer “sacrifices for sins”. The High Priest and his children, his successors, had to offer animals without blemish to God. But the priests themselves had to be without blemish:\n\nLeviticus 21:17-21 (ESV) “Speak to Aaron, saying, None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the bread of his God. 18 For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, a man blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long, 19 or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand, 20 or a hunchback or a dwarf or a man with a defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles. 21 No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the LORD’s food offerings; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.”\n\nThe High Priest was a “shadow” of the coming Messiah, just as the “lambs without spot or blemish” were shadows of the coming “Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29, 36). The High Priest had to be physically healthy – though as our text tells us:\n\nHebrews 5:2 … he himself also is compassed with infirmity (astheneia, pronounced as-then’-i-ah, “weakness”)\n\nWhen called as a High Priest, Aaron and his sons were physically fine – but they were weak with sin. Outwardly they were without spot or blemish, but inwardly they were fallen and broken creatures, just as we all are. Under the New Covenant God would send us “The Holy Spirit to help our infirmities, our astheneia, our weaknesses” (Romans 8:26). Aaron had to make offerings for sin himself, before he could ever offer for the sin of the people.\n\nGod chose Aaron, knowing that Aaron was weak, a sinner. We are told in\n\nHebrews 5:4 And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.\n\nAaron did not choose to be High Priest, no more than Moses chose to be Israel’s liberator. They were called.\n\nGod chose the Tribe of Levi to be the Priestly Tribe because of what happened at Mount Sinai. While Moses was receiving the Old Covenant, Israel turned to the flesh, to idolatry. When Moses came down the mountain and saw the children of Israel worshiping a Golden Calf, the Bible says:\n\nExodus 32:26 … Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD’S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.\n\nThe Levites stood with their brother Moses. They were “ON THE LORD’S SIDE”. So God chose the Levites to be the Priests of Israel, and Aaron – with his sons – to be the High Priests.\n\nJesus Is Unlike The Levitical High Priests\n\nHebrews 5:5 So also Christ glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest; but He that said unto Him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.\n\nAaron did not choose to be High Priest, but was a sinner chosen of God. Aaron was a Levite. But Jesus, as I’ve noted before, was of the line of David. He is the Messiah God promised David in 2 Samuel 7. Jesus, like David is of the line of Judah, not Levi.\n\nUnder Judaism Jesus could NOT be the High Priest. Under the Old Covenant Jesus could NOT be the High Priest. Why? He is of JUDAH, not LEVI.\n\nAs the Son of God, Jesus is “King of kings and Lord of lords, and with Him are His called, His chosen, His faithful followers” (Revelation 17:14). Jesus Christ did not come to reform Judaism, but to fulfill the Laws of Judaism so that He could bring in the NEW Covenant. Jesus is NOT a Priest of Judaism, for the Priests of Judaism are LEVITES. Jesus is High Priest of the New Covenant – the Messiah from the Tribe of David.\n\nHow could Christ be a High Priest? Because God the Father chose Him to be so. But also because Christ comes from a different priesthood.\n\nHebrews 5:6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.\n\nAt this point the Holy Spirit quotes a Messianic Psalm,\n\nPsalm 110:4 The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.\n\nWhen the Messiah came, He was to be LORD and King, because He would be from the Tribe of Judah, of the House of David. But when the Messiah came He was to be HIGH PRIEST of His House, a Priest NOT from the Tribe of Levi, but a more ancient priesthood.\n\nOne day Jesus was being attacked by the Pharisees, as they often did. They hated Jesus because He called them out on how they had modified the Old Covenant to suit themselves. Jesus told them “You are of your father, the devil, and the lusts of your father you do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and would not abide in the truth … he is the father of lies and liars” (John 8:44, AP). Jesus told them, “If anyone keeps My Word, he shall never see death” (John 8:51, ESV). The Pharisees challenged what Jesus said, saying “Our father Abraham died” (John 8:53). Jesus told them, “Abraham rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it, and was glad.” (John 8:56). Jesus went on to say, “Truly, truly I say to you, BEFORE ABRAHAM WAS, I AM” (John 8:58).\n\nJesus lived before Abraham. He is the Great I AM of God. Jesus said “Abraham saw My day, and was glad”. What is Jesus talking about?\n\nIn Genesis 14 we read where Abraham’s nephew Lot and his household was taken captive by several invading kings with their armies (vs 12). This was a huge group of armies that did this. When Abraham heard this, he stepped out in faith. The Bible says that Abraham “armed 318 servants, and pursued them” (vs 14). Abraham brought back all of the people taken by the armies – Lot and his family included – and brought them home to Sodom. At the end of this great victory the Bible says:\n\nGenesis 14:18-20 … Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. 19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: 20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And {Abraham} gave him tithes of all.\n\nThis is before the giving of the Law on Sinai. This is before the Old Covenant. The Bible says “Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God”. This is an Old Testament picture of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is a High Priest after the order of Melchizedek. Abraham saw Jesus, saw an Old Testament incarnation of Him, and was elated.\n\nAs A High Priest Of The Order Of Melchizedek,\n\nJesus Saved Us\n\nHebrews 5:7-9 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; 9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;\n\nWhen Jesus went to Gethsemane right after the Lord’s Table – a Table that represented Christ’s broken body and spilled Blood – He sought the Father’s will with “prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears”. In the darkness of that Garden Jesus told Peter, James and John:\n\nMatthew 26:38 … My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.\n\nJesus knew what was about to happen, but He sought the Father in prayer. He said,\n\nMatthew 26:39 … My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.\n\nOur High Priest, not a Levite but of the order of Melchizedek, prepared to offer the one thing that would pay for our sins. As He prayed, three times Jesus asked “if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will”. And three times the Father said, “Son, You must go. There is no other way. Your Blood must be shed.” Jesus was obedient even to death. The Bible says:\n\nHebrews 5:9-10 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; 10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek.\n\nWord Study: Jesus Christ is our Savior and Lord. He is the “author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him”. The word translated “” is the Greek hypakouō, pronunciation hoop-ak-oo’-o, which means “to be obedient to, to listen to, to heed”. The New Covenant is marked by a heart that loves the Lord, that seeks to follow Him.\n\nBeloved, you are NOT SAVED if you have\n\nno intention of following Jesus.\n\nYes, we are flawed. Yes, we fail God at times. None are perfect. But we love Him Who saved us at such great cost. Jesus Christ is both KING and HIGH PRIEST to His people.\n\nDo you know Jesus? Have you trusted your soul to Him? If you have, you have the promise of eternal life. And to God the Father, Christ has made you special. Jesus “has loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own Blood, and has made us KINGS and PRIESTS unto God the Father” (Revelation 1:5-6). As Jesus is a High Priest after the order of Melchizedek, we are priests not of Levi, but of the order of Melchizedek. As Jesus is the Son of God, we are sons and daughters of God.\n\nDo you know Him? If you do not, call on His name. Acknowledge yourself a sinner worthy of hell, and call on Him to bestow His abundant Grace on you. He suffered to save you. Do not leave this place today without the Lord.\n\nProverbs 3:1-12 My son, forget not My law; but let thine heart keep My commandments: 2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. 3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 4 So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 5 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 6 In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths. 7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil. 8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. 9 Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.\n\nThe mega-church Pastor Joel Osteen preaches a prosperity gospel. In his book “Your Best Life Now” he makes statements like:\n\n“God wants to increase you financially” (pg 5)\n\n“Think big. Think increase. Think abundance. Think more than enough.” (pg 11)\n\nMega-church Pastor Steven Furtick preaches a Word of Faith gospel. The Word of Faith preachers are modalists. They deny the Trinity of God in favor of something they claim is more understandable, more relatable to the flesh. The modalists teach that there is one God, Who presents Himself in three different forms – Father, Son and Spirit. Preaching the words of Christ in\n\nJohn 16:7-8 (NKJV) Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you. 8 And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:\n\nFurtick made this statement:\n\n“{Jesus was saying} No, I am not leaving you. I am changing forms. See, up until now I have walked with you, but when I send my spirit, I will be in you.”\n\nThat isn’t what Jesus was saying. He spoke of the Comforter, the Holy Spirit as a Seperate Person. Furtick went on to preach:\n\n“and now Jesus is taken from their sight, and hidden in a cloud, but he did not leave. He just changed forms. He did not disappear. He just was no longer visible. Instead he was internal… He said “it’s good that I’m ghosting you. It’s good that I leave in physical form because then I can give you in spiritual form, then I can direct you from a deeper place.”\n\nThis is not what the Scripture says. Osteen, Furtick, the various Word of Faith and Prosperity Preachers (Joyce Meyer, T.D. Jakes, Creflo Dollar) appeal to the flesh of man rather than preach the Gospel. As Creflo Dollar preached:\n\n“As the righteousness of God, your inheritance of wealth and riches is included in the “spiritual blessings” (or spiritual things) the apostle Paul spoke of in Ephesians 1:5. Based on Psalm 112:3, righteousness, wealth and riches go hand—in—hand. You have every right to possess material wealth—clothes, jewelry, houses, cars and money—in abundance.”\n\nWhat does the Gospel preach? It does not preach peace and comfort in this physical world. God does not preach that we will all be rich in the things of this world. As a matter of fact, Jesus said:\n\nLuke 12:15 (NKJV) … Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.\n\nMatthew 6:19-20 (NKJV) Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\nAnd the Apostle Paul – who was a tentmaker – wrote:\n\n1 Timothy 6:6-9 Now godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. 8 And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content. 9 But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition.\n\nThere is an easy way to determine if something is false and not from God, or if it is true and from God. Ask yourself, “Does it elevate GOD, or elevate MYSELF, my FLESH?” If the “truth” elevates God, it is from God. If it elevates US, it is from Satan.\n\nFollow Your HEART?\n\nFor instance, people say “Follow your HEART. Your HEART will always be right?” Is that true? Let’s put that on the Scripture Scales and weigh it:\n\nProverbs 3:1-2 My son, forget not My law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: 2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.\n\nGod does not say “Follow your Heart”. In fact, this is what brought sin into the world in the first place. God gave Adam a very clear set of instructions, and a warning against doing what his heart told him to do. Instead of listening to God, Adam listened to his heart. He let his flesh control him, instead of the Word of God. What happened? Paradise was lost.\n\nGod said:\n\n“let thine heart keep my commandments”.\n\nWord Study: The word “let” or allow is not in the original text. The word “keep” is the Hebrew nāṣar (pronounced naw-tsar’) which means “to OBSERVE, to PRESERVE as presented, to GUARD from evil, to WATCH CAREFULLY, to DRAW CLOSE TO so as to obey”. We are not to revel or elevate the flesh, our own desires, but are to glorify God our Creator by heeding at doing what He said. We are not to “let” our hearts do God’s Word – that is a poor translation. We are to “KEEP” our hearts focused on God’s Word. We are to put a leash on our hearts, and say to ourselves “What has GOD said and GOD ordered. We will follow GOD regardless as to where our hearts want us to go”.\n\nWhen we reject our desires and instead put God first, then we are promised:\n\nlength of days and long life, and peace\n\nWhat is the difference between “length of days” and “long life”? The first phrase has to do with the QUALITY of your life, and the second with the QUANTITY of your life. When I lay in the hospital with my left leg crushed, every day seemed like a week, and every minute like an hour, and every second like a minute. When you are suffering and in pain you have a bad day, or a long and torturous day. What got me through each day was my relationship with Jesus Christ. When you heed God’s Word, and cherish it, God helps you make it even through those kind of days. When you guard and cherish God’s Word, your life is extended. To disobey God is to court disaster.\n\nIt’s better for your flesh to ignore the flesh, and\n\nheed the Spirit and the Word.\n\nJesus told us:\n\nJohn 16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\n\nIf you live in this fallen system, you will have trials and tribulations. However, our Lord has promised to see us through the worst of everything. He will “never leave nor forsake us” (Hebrews 13:5), saying “I am with you always, even unto the end of the world” (Matthew 28:20).\n\nProverbs 3:3-4 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 4 So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.\n\nAs we go through this life we will find ourselves at odds with others. When someone does not agree with us, there is a temptation to do one of two things (both equally wrong):\n\n1. We COMPROMISE the TRUTH of God so as to keep the peace, or\n\n2. We ELEVATE THE FLESH and let our FEELINGS, our HEART\n\ntake the place of God’s Word.\n\nWord Study: We are told to not allow either TRUTH or MERCY to “FORSAKE” us (the Hebrew ʿāzaḇ, to depart from us). We uphold and cling to the truths that God has given us in His Word. But we also operate from the place of mercy. We do good toward those who have done evil to us. Jesus said:\n\nMatthew 5:43-45 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. 44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\n\nYou do not compromise the Word of God in order to please the enemy – but you DO GOOD to those who have done evil to you. You emulate your Heavenly Father. Our natural inclination is to “get someone back” when they hurt us. Jesus said, “Get then back by NOT COMPROMISING TRUTH, but DO GOOD to them”.\n\nLet the Word of God direct your heart and\n\nyour hands, not fleshly feelings.\n\nbind them about thy neck\n\nWhen the neck is injured, the doctors will put a brace around your neck that keeps you from turning your head or bending your neck. Mercy and Truth are to be bound around your neck. They should control your head. You are also to\n\nwrite them upon the table of thine heart\n\nYou are to take the Words of God and WRITE THEM – those words of Truth and Mercy – on the table of your heart. We are to control our hearts. Our hearts are not to control us.\n\nWe read:\n\nProverbs 3:4 So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.\n\nThe reason why many Churches have lost their influence over a lost and dying world is because the members of the Churches are no more spiritual than the lost world. God calls us to be Light and Salt, not Darkness and Sugar. The Author of the popular devotional “The Imitation of Christ”, Thomas à Kempis (Thomas of Kempen, the Netherlands) wrote:\n\n“Instant obedience is the only kind of obedience there is; delayed obedience is disobedience. Whoever strives to withdraw from obedience, withdraws from Grace.”\n\nTrust In God Will Bless Your Physical Life\n\nProverbs 3:5-8 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. 7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil. 8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.\n\nModalism leans toward our own understanding. God is Triune. He is incomprehensible. His ways are incomprehensible. When the Apostle Paul considered the majesty of God, he wrote:\n\nRomans 11:33-36 (NKJV) Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out! 34 “For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counselor?” 35 “Or who has first given to Him And it shall be repaid to him?” 36 For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen.\n\nThe way we glorify God is NOT to argue with Him at the border of the Promised Land, but to say “I don’t understand it. But Lord, if You say it, if it is in Your Word, I believe it”. God doesn’t care if we understand. He just tells us to DO what He says do, to glorify Him and Him alone. We have a tendency to “LEAN TO OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING”, and that is foolish. If God can be understood, then He’s not God. God is high above us. “IN ALL YOUR WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM”. Put God first, and you will be blessed.\n\nfear the Lord, and depart from evil\n\nFear of the Lord is when we hate what God hates. God hates evil, because evil destroys creation.\n\nGlobal warming is not our world’s greatest threat. It is the spread and legalization of EVIL.\n\nThat which God has deemed is an “abomination” has become a plaything in America. The liberal leaning NPR (National Public Radio) published an article entitled “Live free and die? The sad state of U.S. life expectancy” (March 25, 2023). In the article we read:\n\n“Across the lifespan, and across every demographic group, Americans die at younger ages than their counterparts in other wealthy nations. … How could this happen? In a country that prides itself on scientific excellence and innovation, and spends an incredible amount of money on health care, the population keeps dying at younger and younger ages. … Referring to a study “Shorter Lives, Poorer Health” the author quoted, “American children are less likely to live to age 5 than children in other high-income countries,” the authors write on the second page. It goes on: “Even Americans with healthy behaviors, for example, those who are not obese or do not smoke, appear to have higher disease rates than their peers in other countries.”\n\nThe article went on to give a myriad of reasons why the lifespan of Americans is decreasing. The Bible makes it clear. “The wages of sin is DEATH” (Romans 6:23). If you heed and do God’s Word, we are told:\n\nIt shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones\n\nThe ancient knew that the “navel” was the place where you received life. Your naval was where you were attached to your mother – but it was God Who formed you in your mother’s womb (Psalm 139:13-15). The ancients also knew that the MARROW is what produces your blood cells – and blood contains the life (Leviticus 17:11; Hebrews 10:10).\n\nIf you heed God and trust Him, not your heart, your stress levels will be lower, and the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:5-7)\n\nDo Not Let “Stuff” Control You\n\nProverbs 3:9-10 Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.\n\nGod will bless you physically when you put Him – and not your “stuff” – first. Everything you have, you have because of the Grace of God. There are three things we need to always remember:\n\n1. God is TRUSTWORTHY. What He has promised, that He will do. Always!\n\n2. God has ENTRUSTED us with what we have. If we are saved by faith in Him, we are HIS POSSESSION – and all of our possessions are His as well. Boyd Bailey (founder of Wisdom Hunters) said:\n\n“Only in complete surrender to Christ are we complete in Him.”\n\nIf we belong to Jesus, then our stuff belongs to Jesus. We’re just borrowing it for a time. Honor God with your stuff.\n\n3. We are TRUSTEES or stewards of all that God has given us. Our souls belong to God, and will one day return to Him who made us. Are we honoring Him? There will be a judgment day. Those who know Jesus by faith will stand before Him, and that which He entrusted to us will be judged for reward or loss. The Shekinah glory of God shall test what we did with what He entrusted us with. The Scripture says:\n\n1 Corinthians 3:11-15 (NKJV) For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 13 each one’s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is. 14 If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward. 15 If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.\n\nThe foundation is our relationship by faith in Christ. We build on this relationship. We do works that glorify our God, trusting Him above all else. May God move on us all to live for His Kingdom – for one day, if we are saved, we will be IN His Kingdom. Amen.\n\nHebrews 4:13-16 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. 14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. 15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. 16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\n\nThe past few weeks we have been looking at Israel, God’s Old Testament people. The Word of God led Israel out of Egypt, through the Red Sea, through the deserts, and to the base of Mount Sinai. When God gave His Word to Israel through Moses, His people – saved by Grace – said:\n\nExodus 24:3 (NKJV) … All the words which the Lord has said we will do ..\n\nThe Way To Blessing Is To Hear & Obey God\n\nYet Israel did not do it. Rather than hear the Word of God and do it, they murmured and complained and balked. In the end the first generation of Israel did NOT go into the Promised Land (other than Joshua and Caleb) because they disobeyed His Word. God had warned Israel:\n\nDeuteronomy 30:15-18 (ESV) See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil. 16 If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I command you today, by loving the Lord your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules, then you shall live and multiply, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it. 17 But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them, 18 I declare to you today, that you shall surely perish. You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess.\n\nIsrael was saved by Grace, just as all are saved by Grace. But BLESSING only comes by obedience. But look at what our text tells us today:\n\nHebrews 4:13 Neither is there any creature that is not MANIFEST in his sight: but ALL THINGS are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\n\nWord Study: This is a very powerful statement. All creatures – all created beings – are MANIFEST IN HIS SIGHT. The word “MANIFEST” is the Greek aphanēs (pronounced af-an-ace’) means “not hidden, clearly visible”. This word is found only here in the New Testament, but it’s meaning is found throughout all scripture. There is nothing hidden from God. When God called Israel from Egypt, He knew that the first generation was going to fail. God knows everything. One of the characteristics of God is that He is omniscient, all knowing:\n\nIsaiah 46:9-10 (NKJV) Remember the former things of old, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me, 10 Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things that are not yet done, Saying, ‘My counsel shall stand, And I will do all My pleasure,’\n\nThe Bible tells us that “God’s understanding is without measure” (Psalm 147:5). Before we were ever formed in our mothers, God knew us. God knows everything, and nothing is a secret to Him, nothing a surprise.\n\nIsaiah 40:28 (ESV) Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.\n\nGod knows everything. “The hairs of your head are NUMBERED” (Matthew 10:30). You cannot hide anything from God. He knows. He knows. You cannot hide anything from God. “Can a man hide himself in secret places SO I CANNOT SEE HIM? NO! I FILL HEAVEN AND EARTH.” (Jeremiah 23:24, AP). God even knows what we are going to say next. King David said:\n\nPsalm 139:1-4 (ESV) O Lord, you have searched me and known me! You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways. Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it altogether.\n\nGod knows. God knows. Did God know that the first generation of Israel would fail Him, and lose the promised land? Yes, God knew. It was not a surprise to God. He saved Israel by faith, and promised to bless Israel if they would hear and do His Word. He warned Israel repeatedly against failing His Word. Yet Israel chose to disobey, and the first generation died in the desert. Was this a surprise to God? Absolutely not!\n\nALL THINGS are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do\n\nWord Study: The Bible says “ALL THINGS are naked and opened”. The word “naked” (Greek gymnos, pronounced goom-nos’) means “is laid bare, cannot be covered”. The word “opened” (Greek trachēlizō, pronounced trakh-ay-lid’-zo) means “to seize by the throat or neck, to expose the gullet of a victim to kill, to bend back the neck”. This is a fighter or wrestler’s term. Why are these two words used together? Because there is nothing you can hide or cover up that God does not see. Further, you are defenseless against the gaze of our Almighty God. God knows everything.\n\nWhen God made Adam and placed him in the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam His Word. He said:\n\nGenesis 2:16-17 … Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n\nGod made Adam with free will, and put him in a beautiful place. When Adam sinned against God, was it a surprise to God? No. Look at the words that God uses:\n\n“in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die”\n\nNot “IF you eat of it”, but “IN THE DAY YOU EAT OF IT”. God made Adam perfect. Adam was made in God’s image. Adam neither earned nor deserved this, and yet God in His Grace bestowed His blessings. To keep His blessings, Adam had to heed and DO God’s Word. But Adam failed to do so – and brought sin and death on both himself, and all his progeny.\n\nGod is OMNIPOTENT, all powerful. The Scripture says,\n\nPsalm 102:25 Of old hast Thou (O God) laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.\n\nGod created all things. He said in Isaiah 48:13, “Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.” God made everything, and God knows everything. He is both OMNIPOTENT and OMNIPRESENT. God in His Trinity – Father, Son, and Spirit – made all things. And as Jesus said:\n\nJohn 17:24 … Father… Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world.\n\nJesus Christ was with the Father, Eternal God the Son, Eternal Word of God from time past. God made us perfect, but knew we would fail. This Jesus Who “Was with God, and Was God, the Same was in the beginning with God” (John 1:1-3), this same Jesus “was foreordained before the foundation of the world” (1 Peter 1:20).\n\nThere Is A Great High Priest\n\nHebrews 4:14-15 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. 15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\n\nGod knows our brokenness. He knew Adam’s bad choice before Adam was ever made. God did not make Adam make that bad choice – God gave Adam free will. But God knew.\n\nBeloved, we are saved by “A GREAT HIGH PRIEST”. Israel had a High Priest who served in the Tabernacle and in the Temple, but Israel’s High Priest was just like us. Just as with all of humanity, the High Priest of Israel was himself a sinner. The Bible says:\n\nLeviticus 16:11 (ESV) Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall kill the bull as a sin offering for himself.\n\nUnder the Law a sinful man called a “High Priest” made “atonement” or a covering for sin for HIMSELF by killing an ANIMAL. Only after the High Priest atoned for his sin did he make atonement for the people:\n\nLeviticus 16:15 (ESV) Then {the High Priest} shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it over the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat.\n\nThe High Priest shed the blood of a BULL – not a human but a flawless BULL – then once his sins were paid for he shed the blood of a GOAT or a SHEEP. But until the High Priest “killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 9:7-24), until the sin offering was made for himself, he could not minister to the people.\n\nThis is why the Law of Moses could not bring a true salvation. Animals payed for the sins of mankind. Animals without spot or blemish – a representation of Someone Greater – paid for what Adam and the sons and daughters of Adam did and do daily.\n\nThe Law of Moses, the Law of CEREMONY and CIRCUMCISION and SACRIFICE were but shadows that pointed to a greater COVENANT, a greater BLESSING. That blessing is CHRIST JESUS!\n\nThe Bible says in\n\nGalatians 3:19-26 (ESV) Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. 20 Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one. 21 Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. 22 But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. 23 Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. 24 So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, 26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.\n\nGod knew that we were broken – but WE did not know that we were broken. So God gave us the Law of sacrifice and ceremony and circumcision to teach us we are sinners. Even our High Priest was a sinner, and had to cover his sins with the blood of bullocks. But the Law of Moses was given to lead us to Christ, to show us our need for Him.\n\nHebrews 4:14-15 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. 15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\n\nAaron was a GOOD High Priest, and many who followed afterwards perhaps were GOOD High Priests. They did their best. But Beloved, WE HAVE A GREAT HIGH PRIEST in Jesus. Jesus Christ can trace His lineage back to Adam, but being born of the Holy Spirit. As the Angel told Mary the mother of Jesus:\n\nLuke 1:35 (NKJV) … The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.\n\nThose born fully human, Jesus’ blood line did not come from Adam, but from God Himself. All of the children of Adam are sinners, for Adam sinned. But Christ is God incarnate, God in the flesh. “The virgin was with Child. She brought forth a Son, and He is called EMMANUEL, meaning “God With Us” (Matthew 1:23, AP). Christ was not born of sinners, but He is the Eternal Son of God. He is a Great High Priest because, as our text tells us,\n\nHebrews 4:15 {Jesus} was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin\n\nNo Man Who walked the face of this earth was more scrutinized than Jesus was. The Pharisees who loved the Law hated Jesus, because Jesus called them on their hypocrisy. The Herodians hated Jesus, because He loved the Lord and not a political party. The Sadducees hated Jesus, because He spoke of resurrection, and they did not believe in an afterlife. The Romans hated Jesus because He would not bow the knee to Caesar. The Scribes hated Jesus because He would not bow the knee to the Chief Priests. Jesus was more examined than any person in history. What was the conclusion?\n\n1 Peter 2:22-24 (AMP) {JESUS} COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS DECEIT EVER FOUND IN HIS MOUTH. While being reviled and insulted, He did not revile or insult in return; while suffering, He made no threats [of vengeance], but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges fairly. He personally carried our sins in His body on the cross [willingly offering Himself on it, as on an altar of sacrifice], so that we might die to sin [becoming immune from the penalty and power of sin] and live for righteousness; for by His wounds you [who believe] have been healed.\n\nJesus is our Great High Priest. He is sinless, and stands before God the Father making intercession for us. “He Who knew NO SIN was counted as sin in order that we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21, AP). When Jesus walked this earth, He kept the Law of God – the Law He wrote – PERFECTLY. The day that Jesus died, His executioner, Pilate, said “I find NO GUILT nor A BASIS FOR CHARGES against this Man” (Luke 23:4).\n\nJesus did not die because He is a sinner. He died because WE are sinners. Jesus did not offer an animal sacrifice for our sins, but offered HIMSELF, pure and holy, in our place!\n\nOur Great High Priest died on Calvary. The Bible says that after His death:\n\nHebrews 9:11-12 (NKJV) Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation. 12 Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.\n\nJesus walked through our broken world, and suffered the effects of our broken world, but He Himself remained without sin.\n\nJesus is SINLESS.\n\nJesus is ETERNAL.\n\nJesus is the SON OF GOD.\n\nJesus is at the Father’s RIGHT HAND.\n\nWhat Does God Demand Of Us?\n\nGod knows our brokenness. God knows our failures. He knows our imperfections. We cannot hide our limitations from Him. But God has given us a GREAT HIGH PRIEST in Jesus. What must we do?\n\nHebrews 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\n\nGod bids us first of all to “come BOLDLY”. This does not mean to approach God with ARROGANCE, or in a DEMANDING way. But we are to come to God’s Throne WITH CONFIDENCE. God knows your brokenness, He knows all our failures. Jesus came for every person, for WHOSOEVER WILL. Will you come to Him, and humble yourself before Him?\n\nRevelation 22:17 … (NKJV) the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let him who hears say, “Come!” And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.\n\nWhat limits you from coming to Christ, to making Him your High Priest? Nothing. Come to Him Who gave Himself for you. If you are thirsty, COME. If you are a sinner, COME. There is no one too broken to where Jesus will not intercede, Jesus will save. But you are to come “with CONFIDENCE, not ARROGANCE or GRUMBLING”. Notice we are told:\n\nHebrews 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace\n\nNotice that this place we come is not an ALTAR OF GRACE. We do not come, as the ancient Jews did, with a sheep or goat without blemish. We do not bring anything we deem worthy to God. We make no payment nor penance before God, for there is no way that we can pay for our sins. What does God say?\n\nIsaiah 64:6 (NKJV) … we are all like an unclean thing, And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away.\n\nWe bring nothing of worth to pay for Grace – Grace is a gift from God. But Grace is for whosoever will. This is not an ALTAR of Grace.\n\nWe come boldly to the THRONE of Grace\n\nIt is a THRONE because HE IS LORD. We come to Him Who is “King of Kings and lord of Lords” (Revelation 17:14). We come to “The Blessed and Only Potentate”, the Ruler and Creator of all. Beloved, let me be very clear on this:\n\nThere is no salvation, no GRACE outside of the THRONE. God calls us to salvation through UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER. HE IS LORD.\n\nCertainly, we all come to Christ broken. Certainly, we come to Him as lepers needing cleansing. And He cleanses us. He gives us IMPUTED RIGHTEOUSNESS through the sacrifice of Himself. He represents us before the Throne of Grace. But we are HIS PEOPLE. We belong to HIS KINGDOM. What does the Scripture say?\n\nMatthew 1:21 (NKJV) Jesus … will SAVE HIS PEOPLE from their sins\n\nSalvation is a free gift to the person that surrenders their allegiance to the "
