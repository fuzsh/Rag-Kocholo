Born into the wealthy strata of professional aristocratic families such as the Massingbirds, Wedgewoods and Darwins, he had not been expected to study music, a subject which proffered very little in terms of career prospects or pecuniary return. In this regard, he suffered the same prejudice as his teacher, Hubert Parry, who rebelled against his own social class.1 It was while Vaughan Williams, at the age of around fifteen or sixteen, was at Charterhouse that he came across Parry’s music for the first time. In 1880, Parry had auspiciously begun his career as a composer of largescale choral music with his Scenes from Prometheus Unbound, a setting of selected verses from Shelley’s epic philosophical poem, which had been sung, with some considerable difficulty, at the Gloucester Three Choirs Festival.2 Some believed this work to herald a new modernism in British music, with its enthusiastic assimilation of Wagnerian gestures and harmony, and it received a lengthy review\n\n1 Parry’s father, Thomas Gambier Parry (a former undergraduate at Trinity in the 1830s), vigorously opposed a career in music as did Parry’s wife’s family, the Herberts of Wilton\n\nPlace, Salisbury. It was for this reason that Parry began his professional life working at\n\nLloyd’s Register of Shipping after he left Oxford in 1870 in order to prove that he could support his wife financially. He married Maude Herbert in 1872; in 1877 he renounced insurance and took up music full-time. 2 In some ways the birth pangs of Parry’s work can be compared with the similar complications\n\nElgar suffered at the first performance of The Dream of Gerontius at Birmingham in 1900.\n\nPortrait of Vaughan Williams by Joy Finzi (1947).\n\nin the Musical Times from Francis Hueffer, known at that time as one of Wagner’s most fervent disciples in London.3 Prometheus was given a much more vital and fluent performance by Stanford at the Cambridge University Musical Society (CUMS) in 1881, but it was not until 1887 when Parry’s name leapt to national attention with his setting of Milton’s Ode to a Solemn Musick, better known to choral singers as Blest Pair of Sirens. 4 This superb setting of Milton’s Pindaric structure seemed to capture something more intrinsically national – its yearning melodic shapes and diatonic harmony – which seemed to combine continental elements with those more familiar from the English cathedral tradition. A year later, Parry produced his first oratorio, Judith, for the Birmingham Triennial Festival and this was followed by his Ode to St Cecilia for Leeds and another Milton setting, L’Allegro ed Il Pensieroso for Norwich. As Vaughan Williams recalled, his cousin had remarked, entering the room brandishing a copy of Parry’s recently published Studies of Great Composers (1887): ‘This man, Parry, he said, declares that a composer must write as his musical conscience demands.’5 This was a new concept to the young, impressionable Carthusian. ‘Soon after that,’ he recounted, ‘I got to know some of his music, especially parts of ‘Judith’ and I remember, even as a boy, my brother saying to me that there was something, to his mind, peculiarly English about his music.’6\n\nAfter finishing at Charterhouse, a normal course of events for Vaughan Williams would have been the continuation of his education at either Oxford or Cambridge. Even though his family were somewhat concerned about the questionable wisdom of studying music, he was able to persuade them to allow him two years at the Royal College of Music where he could realise his ambition of studying with Parry. After a course of two terms of harmony, mandatory for Vaughan Williams who had not studied it at Charterhouse, he began lessons with Parry. Writing later he avowed:\n\n3 So significant did Frank Howes think of this review that it was reproduced in full as an appendix to his study, The English Musical Renaissance (Secker & Warburg: London, 1966, pp. 356–8. 4 Parry later gifted the manuscript of Blest Pair of Sirens to Trinity College, partly acknowledging Stanford’s part in conducting the first performance in London, but also the connection with Milton and the college. 5 ‘A Musical Autobiography’ in Kennedy, M. (ed.), National Music and Other Essays (Oxford\n\nUniversity Press: Oxford, 1986, 2nd edn.), 180. 6 Ibid.\n\nI was quite prepared to join with the young students of the R.C.M. in worshipping at that shrine, and I think I can truly say that I have never been disloyal to it. Perhaps I can no longer, owing to the weakening digestion of old age, swallow Parry’s music whole as I did then; but I still thrill to the magnificence of ‘Job’ and ‘De Profundis’, and I hereby solemnly declare, keeping steadily in view the works of Byrd, Purcell, and Elgar, that ‘Blest Pair of Sirens’ is my favourite piece of music written by an Englishman.7\n\nThough it might have been a more logical choice for Vaughan Williams to go to Oxford – Parry was, after all, Choragus to John Stainer, Professor of Music at the University and a regular visitor to assist with Stainer’s termly lectures and degree examining. But it was decided that he should enter Trinity College, Cambridge, to read history. By the autumn of 1892, when he arrived at the College, he had resolved to fill his time with music together with the prospect of exploring music-making in the University. He was also buoyed up by the dicta of Parry (most famously ‘write choral music as befits an Englishman and a democrat’) with whom he continued lessons in London for some time.\n\nCambridge in the 1890s boasted the likes of Henry Sidgwick, J. R. Seeley (Regius Professor of History), F. W. Maitland (historian and lawyer), Richard Jebb (Regius Professor of Greek), George Humphry (Professor of Surgery), Michael Foster (Professor of Physiology), J. K. Stephen (poet and law lecturer) and Alfred Marshall (Professor of Political Economy), all of whom vigorously enlivened the intellectual life of the University. Vaughan Williams’s decision to study history almost certainly brought him into contact with Frederic Maitland. Author of the masterly History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I, he was an internationally recognised historian. To this Maitland added a love of music and music-making, which often took place at his home at West Lodge in Cambridge. Vaughan Williams was a frequent visitor:\n\nRalph admired both Maitland, a vivid and attractive man whose lectures and writings illuminated the dusty archives of legal history with humanity and wit, and his wife [Florence], who was a beautiful and original young woman and a fine amateur violinist. Among the most constant visitors to their house were Ralph’s friends Nicholas and Ivor Gatty; Nicholas was a violinist, Ivor played the horn, Ralph the viola, and other undergraduate\n\n7 Ibid.\n\nmusicians joined the group for ‘scratch’ chamber music. Sometimes Florence’s younger sister, Adeline, stayed at the Lodge and, as she was able to play the cello if no one else was available to do so, though her real talent was for the piano, she was a welcome addition to the party.8\n\nAdeline went on to marry Vaughan Williams in 1897. Wintering in the Canaries, which he found an antidote to tuberculosis, Maitland died prematurely young at 56 in 1906. On hearing the news, Vaughan travelled to the Canaries to look after Florence and her two daughters and to bring them back to Cambridge. The following year, he dedicated his first major Leeds Festival commission, Toward the Unknown Region, to Florence. In 1925 Vaughan Williams published four songs with Oxford University with poetry by the Maitlands’ younger daughter, Fredegond. Such was his friendship with Maitland, however, that after Vaughan Williams died in 1958, two photographs were discovered in his bedroom. One was of Gustav Holst, his closest musical confidante; the other was of Maitland.\n\nMaitland shared with Vaughan Williams a passion for Wagner. At that time Vaughan Williams’s mind was also full of Wagner’s music, partly because he had been studying the merits of the composer with Parry, but also because, with the loan of Parry’s scores, he had attended the performances of Wagner’s operas in London under Gustav Mahler. G. F. McCleary, a former RCM student who had come up to Trinity Hall in 1889 went to London to hear Tristan und Isolde during this memorable series of performances:\n\n…after the performance, while waiting at Charing Cross station on the Underground, we saw a young man with the Tristan score under his arm. Collins [later the organist of the Birmingham Oratory] said: “That is one of the College composition students. Let’s go and speak to him. His name is Vaughan Williams.” That was my first meeting with one of my most valued friends….9\n\nWagner would remain one of Vaughan Williams’s obsessions for the next decade, one which would be spent assimilating the German composer’s particular brand\n\n8 Norris, G., Stanford, the Cambridge Jubilee and Tchaikovsky (David & Charles: London, 1980), 421. 9 McCleary, G. F., ‘Cambridge in the Early Nineties’ in On Detective Fiction and Other Things:\n\nEssays (Hollis & Carter: London, 1960), 80.\n\nof chromatic harmony. To this would be added an assimilation of Parry and Elgar and the characteristics of English folksong. Such a stylistic amalgam can be felt in his Piano Quintet, his symphonic poem In The Fen Country and his choral works Toward the Unknown Region and A Sea Symphony before it found more mature utterance in such works as the Fantasia of a Theme of Thomas Tallis, the Five Mystical Songs and the Fantasia on Christmas Carols.\n\nMcCleary got to know Vaughan Williams well during their shared time at Cambridge. They were both members of the University Musical Club. The standard of performance was variable since it relied almost entirely on amateurs, but Vaughan Williams supported the Club’s activities and even ventured to have one of his earliest vocal works (a quartet for men’s voices) performed there. ‘It was the first work of his I ever heard,’ McCleary related, ‘and I must confess that I was not much impressed by it. But a different opinion was expressed by Haydn Inwards, a professional violinist on the teaching staff of the Royal College of Music who was a member of the Club and had heard our discussion. “You are all wrong,” he said, “that is real good stuff.”’10 This equates closely with a more detailed account Vaughan Williams left in his ‘Musical Autobiography’ written for Hubert Foss’s study of the composer in or around 1949.11 The University Musical Club had been taken over by Hugh Allen who had arrived in Cambridge as organ scholar of Christ’s College at exactly the same time as Vaughan Williams at Trinity. His mission was to improve the amateur standards of the Club and to heighten members’ awareness of nineteenth-century German chamber music, especially that of Schubert, Schumann and Brahms. It was Allen who gave Vaughan Williams his first opportunity to hear one of his own compositions – as McCleary recollected, a quartet for men’s voices [a setting of Shelley’s ‘Music, when soft voices die’] – in a semi-public forum. Unfortunately, its execution did not go to plan:\n\nat the first performance the second tenor got a bar out and remained so nearly to the end. Allen organized an encore and it was done all over again, this time correctly. The audience disliked it the second time even more than the first. This may seem a small episode but it was my first experience of an essential and salutary, though unpleasant form of\n\n10 Ibid., 81. 11 See Foss, H., Ralph Vaughan Williams: A Study (George G. Harrap: London, 1950), 18–38.\n\nThis was later reprinted in Kennedy, 177–194.\n\nPortrait of Charles Villiers Stanford by William Orpen (1920).\n\ncomposition lesson, a performance in public, something quite different from a private rehearsal.12\n\nAfter the Club concerts had concluded, there was time for light entertainment consisting mainly of comic songs. The most brilliant executor was Sedley Taylor, the distinguished physicist and acoustician, who had been the target of a satirical remark by Karl Marx in Das Kapital. 13 His favourite party pieces were apparently ‘The Polka’ and ‘The Choir-boy’ and a parody of Sullivan’s ‘The Lost Chord’, which was renamed ‘The Lost Ball’ and had the opening line ‘Batting one day at the Oval.’14 According to McCleary, Vaughan Williams always remained to enjoy this demonstration of light-heartedness though he did not participate in the singing of them.\n\nThe University Musical Club was only one of a broader range of opportunities which Vaughan Williams encountered. By 1892, the University and city could claim a much more propitious position in the national musical calendar. Much of this was due to the efforts of Charles Villiers Stanford, who had come up to Cambridge in 1870. After three years as organ scholar at Queens’ College, he ‘migrated’ to Trinity College as organist and Director of Music in the chapel after John Larkin Hopkins, the resident organist, had stood down on the grounds of ill health. Stanford not only undertook responsibility for the choir, its boys and its lay clerks, but also the running of the annual organ recitals in chapel during the Easter term. When Larkin Hopkins retired from the position of conductor for the Cambridge University Musical Society, Stanford eagerly stepped into the breach and, through his efforts, CUMS became an important cultural barometer, especially after the first performance of Brahms’s First Symphony in England on 8 March 1877 under the baton of another regular musical visitor to Cambridge, Joseph Joachim. Joachim’s presence as a violinist in the CUMS chamber and orchestral concerts did much to boost the Society’s prestige as did the conferral of honorary D.Mus. degrees on figures such as John Goss, Sullivan, Parry, Joachim and Dvořák. The Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club was also a thriving organisation, notably for its production of Greek plays every two or three years, with music by contemporary composers.\n\n12 Kennedy, 184. A second partsong , a setting of Coleridge’s ‘The Virgin’s Cradle Song’, was sung on 3 November 1894. 13 See Marx, K., Das Kapital ed. McLellan, D., (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1999), 47. 14 McCleary, 82.\n\nThe productions attracted many budding student actors, classical scholars who took an active part in the translations (such as A. W. Verrall) and composers who provided original scores such as Macfarren, Charles Wood, Parry, Stanford and Thomas Tertius Noble.15 Stanford, what is more, was the musical director until he left Trinity and Cambridge at the end of 1892.\n\nAccording to McCleary, Vaughan Williams did not cultivate a wide circle of friends; ‘he was reserved in manner and did not make friends readily. He seemed not to care much for University sports, which were a fruitful source of conversation in many University circles… . He was interested in literature and philosophy, but it was evident that his heart was in music.’16 Shy though Vaughan Williams was, he did cultivate a small group of intimate friends. Among them were the philosophers G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell and John McTaggart, historian George Trevelyan (later a Master of Trinity), his brother Robert, Ralph Wedgwood (his second cousin), the legal academic Maurice Amos and the painter and art critic Roger Fry. Some of these friends were members of ‘The Apostles’, a private discussion group which met on a weekly basis. It is not known whether he was elected to this select group of undergraduates, but he certainly seems to have participated in debates from time to time, and in ‘reading parties’ during shared holidays to the Isle of Skye, Penzance and Seatoller in Cumberland.\n\nVaughan Williams’s earnestness may have been due in large part to his plan of study. As McCleary suggested, his attention was focused on music, probably to the exclusion of his history degree. In this he was much like Stanford who read for a Classics degree, but such was Stanford’s devotion to music in the university that, after considering abandoning his degree studies entirely, he achieved the minimum in his Classical Tripos to pass in 1874.17 Judging from Vaughan Williams ‘Autobiography’, his main intention was to study for the Mus.B. degree. At this time the music degree was still a non-resident phenomenon as was the\n\n15 During Vaughan Williams’s time at Cambridge, the CUADC produced Euripides’ Iphigenia in Tauris in 1894 with music by Charles Wood. 16 McCleary, 83. 17 See ‘Charles Villiers Stanford’, Musical Times, xxxix (December, 1898), 788.\n\nposition of Professor of Music.18 Although it was necessary to undertake written papers in harmony, counterpoint, history and acoustics at the university, all teaching took place privately and it was the student’s responsibility to find a tutor of sufficient standing and qualification (often a cathedral organist) to give him the appropriate instruction. If the student successfully passed these papers, it was necessary to submit an ‘Exercise’ in which certain rubrics of compositional technique were demonstrated. If this passed muster, and it was examined by the Professor of Music and an external examiner from another institution, the degree could be awarded. The same could be said of the doctorate, the Mus.Doc.19\n\nIn order to supplicate for the Mus.B. at Cambridge, Vaughan Williams took lessons with Charles Wood who had recently become the organ scholar at Gonville & Caius College; in 1894 the College made him a life fellow, the first Fellowship ever given to a musician. Wood had the reputation of being a brilliant teacher of composition; indeed, Edward Dent, who became Professor of Music at Cambridge in 1926, maintained that he was only surpassed in this province by Stanford, and in counterpoint and fugue he was unequalled.20 Vaughan Williams may have encountered Wood at the RCM during his time as a student under Parry, since Wood had been appointed a teacher of counterpoint there in 1888. But, as Dent explained, Cambridge was Wood’s home, and after Stanford left the university at the end of 1892, it was he who did more to develop musical studies in Cambridge than anyone else, though, in Stanford’s absence, the burden of musical teaching fell disproportionally to him, especially after Stanford’s reform of the degree system was implemented.21 Vaughan Williams did not find Wood a particularly\n\n18 When Stanford was elected Professor of Music at Cambridge at the end of 1887, he actually lived in Cambridge by dint of the fact that he was Director Music in Trinity College\n\nChapel. However, after resigning his post at Trinity at Christmas 1892, he lived in London and therefore remained non-resident for the rest of his life. 19 It remains one of the most telling ironies that Stanford never supplicated for any music degree. Both his Mus.D. degrees from Oxford (1884) and Cambridge (1888) were conferred honoris causa. 20 See Dent, E. J., Preface to Charles Wood: Eight String Quartets (Oxford University Press:\n\nOxford, 1929), iii. 21 In 1893 Stanford succeeded in recommending major reforms to the Mus.B. and Mus.Doc. to Senate, though it was not before the beginning of the twentieth century that they were implemented. One of the controversial reforms to the Mus.B. was the introduction of nine terms of residence which necessitated the introduction of a teaching programme and the appointment of music lecturers. Another was the abolition of the ‘Exercise’.\n\ninspiring teacher. After Parry’s sense of artistic vision, he seemed dry and matterof-fact. Nevertheless, he was ‘the finest technical instructor [he] had ever known’, a skill which helped him to pass the Mus.B. in 1894. His ‘Exercise’, a setting of the Latin hymn, ‘Vexilla regis prodeunt’ by the Christian poet and saint, Venantius Fortunatus, Bishop of Poitiers, can still be viewed in the University Library.22\n\nAnother of Vaughan Williams’s objectives was to study the organ in order to gain the FRCO (Fellowship of the Royal College of Organists). In gaining his Mus.B. at Cambridge it meant that he was exempt from holding the ARCO (Associate of the Royal College of Organists), normally a pre-requisite for taking the FRCO. Holding a music degree also made him exempt from having to do the FRCO written examinations, though it was still necessary to perform the prescribed pieces, do the standard keyboard tests (such as score-reading and extemporisation) and graduate tests (a transposition test and figured bass at sight). To acquire sufficient proficiency, he took lessons with Stanford’s successor at Trinity, Alan Gray. ‘Our friendship survived his despair at my playing,’ Vaughan Williams lamented, ‘and I became quite expert at managing the stops at his voluntaries and organ recitals. Many of these were after services in the chapel or during the Easter Term recitals which Gray continued after Stanford’s departure. Vaughan Williams would have had the chance to practise in Trinity chapel on the substantial four-manual organ; there is some evidence, too, that he occasionally played for services, though granting this responsibility seemed to be a source of concern to his organ teacher. Writing to Walter Parratt, Professor of Organ at the RCM, he opined: ‘I can never trust him to play a simple service for me without some dread as to what he may do.… In fact he seems to [be] somewhat hopeless, but I should be glad if you could give me your opinion.’23 Vaughan Williams always maintained he could never play the organ – perhaps an over-modest reaction inculcated by his public school education. Yet his playing and musicianship must have been good enough to impress his examiners at the Royal College of Organists – W. S. Hoyte (organist at All Saints, Margaret Street), Warwick Jordan (Professor of Organ at the /Guildhall School of Music) and George Martin (organist at St Paul’s Cathedral) – when he successfully took his FRCO in July 1898. We also know, from a letter to\n\n22 See Mus.B.103. The date in the card catalogue is 11 December 1894 which is when it was probably deposited in the UL. 23 https://www.rcm.ac.uk/media/Vaughan%20Williams%20manuscripts.pdf\n\nHolst, that he played Reubke’s 94th Psalm, a virtuoso work of Lisztian difficulty, which suggests that he possessed a more-than-average technique.24 He was also self-deprecating about his technique as a composer, especially when comparing himself with his fellow composition students at the RCM such as Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, William Hurlstone, Gustav Holst, Thomas Dunhill, Fritz Hart and John Ireland, but, in truth, he was no less advanced in his art. As if to prove this, with some advice from Stanford,25 he supplicated for his Mus.Doc. under the old regulations in 1898 (he was the last to do so),26 by completing the written examinations and completed his ‘Exercise’, a setting of movements from the Mass, a Credo, Offertorium (purely for orchestra), Sanctus, Hosanna and Benedictus, in 1899. He took his degree in 1901, after which he was always addressed as ‘Dr Vaughan Williams’.27\n\nWe know that, during his three years at the university, Vaughan Williams directed a small choral society which met on Sundays to sing through Schubert Masses. This was to gain some practical experience in the art of conducting.28 Of his interaction with CUMS we know relatively little, except to say that he was an active member. It is, however, a strange omission in his ‘Autobiography’ that he failed to mention one of the Society’s most auspicious events in its history, the celebration of its 50th anniversary in 1893. Although Stanford had officially resigned his position in Trinity Chapel in December 1892, it was agreed that he would still act as musical director for the major Jubilee concert the following June. In order to give the occasion as much prestige as possible, Stanford hoped to entice both Verdi and Brahms to come to Cambridge to receive honorary degrees. Both requests were met with refusal: Verdi claimed he was too old, and Brahms expressed an aversion to travel and public adulation. Stanford was, however, not the sort of personality given to despondency and quickly devised a second and even more elaborate scheme. Invitations were sent out to no less than five major European\n\n24 Letter from Vaughan Williams to Holst [n.d. late 1898?], GB-Lbl MS Mus. 158, f.29. 25 See letter from Vaughan Williams to Holst [Oct 1899?], GB-Lbl MS Mus. 158, f.2. 26 See letter from Vaughan Williams to Percy Young, 13 May 1953, GB-Lbl MS Mus. 161, ff.143–145. 27 Vaughan Williams’s Mass was deposited in the UL in 1901. It was not exhumed until over a century later when it was rediscovered by Cambridge alumnus, Alan Tongue, and recorded on the Albion Records label (under the aegis of the Vaughan Williams Society) in 2014. 28 Kennedy, 184–5.\n\nmusical figures – Tchaikovsky, Bruch, Saint-Saëns, Grieg and Boito – who, having accepted, all (with the exception of Grieg, who was too ill to come) converged on Cambridge to take their degrees and participate in a number of events organised by CUMS. The first of these was a concert in which all the composers participated: after the National Anthem, arranged and conducted by Stanford, Bruch conducted the Banquet Scene from his oratorio Odysseus (with George Henschel, his wife Lillian Henschel, Marie Brema and Harry Plunket Greene), Saint-Saëns appeared as soloist in his Fantasia L’Afrique under Stanford’s baton, Boito directed the Prologue to his opera Mefistofele and Tchaikovsky the first English performance of Francesca da Rimini. In Grieg’s absence Stanford conducted his Peer Gynt Suite No. 1 and concluded with his own setting of Swinburne’s ode East to West. After an invitation to visit Trinity, Tchaikovsky made his way to the Maitlands, where as their guest, he met Florence and Adeline. In the evening, all the composers congregated at King’s College for the Jubilee dinner, held there because Austen Leigh, the president of CUMS, was Provost of the College. In King’s College hall there were four tables: high table and three tables at 90 degrees (forming a disjointed ‘E’ figure) which accommodated many members of CUMS, prominent members of the university and the composers. To Austen Leigh’s right at high table sat Saint-Saëns, Lord Leighton, Boito, Stanford, Jebb, Alexander Mackenzie and Oscar Browning. To his left sat Bruch, Lord Kelvin, Canon Kynaston, Arthur Coleridge, Walter Damrosch, Tchaikovsky and Sedley Taylor. On the other side of the table were situated Barnby, Bridge, Cobb, Henschel Stanford’s former Dublin teacher, Robert Stewart and the University Librarian, Francis Jenkinson. On one of the lower tables sat Vaughan Williams in his capacity as Honorary Secretary of CUMS, having paid one guinea for the privilege. He had attended the afternoon concert, and after the dinner, he, along with all the other guests made their way to the Fitzwilliam Museum for a ‘conversazione’, hosted principally by the Ladies Committee of CUMS. It was an occasion where all could ‘mingle’ in the ambiance of the Museum, surrounded by exhibits of the Fitzwilliam’s rare collection of musical manuscripts. Equally important, however, was the opportunity to present Stanford with a parting gift for his many years of service to CUMS. The degree ceremony took place in Senate House the following day along with a recital on the Trinity organ by Saint-Saëns. The following year, Grieg came to Cambridge to receive his degree. Of these extraordinary events, which he witnessed at first hand, Vaughan Williams writes nothing, not even in his BBC talk about Stanford in August 1952 to commemorate the centenary of Stanford’s birth. It must therefore be left to conjecture whether he gained an introduction to any of the\n\nCambridge ‘honorary doctors’, but, given his close friendship with Maitland, with whom Adeline (his future wife) was staying, and his position as Honorary Secretary of CUMS, it is likely that he did.\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge in the summer of 1895, Vaughan Williams returned to the RCM. By this time Parry, as the new Director, had given up composition teaching, and so he went to Stanford with whom he spent just one year. Against Stanford’s advice (who wanted him to go to Italy), he pursued further study in Berlin with Bruch in 1897, before taking his FRCO and Mus.Doc. at Cambridge. He retained a close relationship with his alma mater, particularly through his friendship with Edward Dent, a fellow at King’s since 1902. He came up to the university to give lectures on folksong, he took an interest in Dent’s pupils – Cecil Armstrong Gibbs (composer), Steuart Wilson (who later became a famous tenor), the highly gifted W. C. Denis Browne (who was killed at Gallipoli in 1915) and Arthur Bliss – and was alarmed when there seemed to be the prospect of Dent going to America:\n\nFrom our point of view your going wd be too awful – we can’t afford to lose you – and though there appears to be nothing going which England can offer as an inducement to stay – yet I feel something must come soon & things at Cambridge will get better – and “if and when” C.V.S. resigns – you ought to be offered the professorship – whether you will is quite another matter – I suppose this American affair wd not last forever & you cd come back in 4 or 5 years and take your rightful position in England.29\n\nIn 1909 Vaughan Williams was invited to compose music for the Cambridge ADC’s production of Aristophanes’ comedy The Wasps. The composer had recently returned from France where he had been studying with Ravel. French influences can be heard in his Housman song-cycle On Wenlock Edge and in The Wasps, and the score contained many references to folksong both original and synthetic together with various comic quotations from Debussy and Léhar’s The Merry Widow. Dent’s students Wilson and Browne played a prominent part in the production which was conducted by Charles Wood. The following May, Dent organised a concert in Cambridge entirely of Vaughan Williams’s works which included chamber music and On Wenlock Edge. Gervase Elwes, the celebrated tenor, sang and Vaughan Williams was delighted with the result:\n\n29 Letter from Vaughan Williams to Dent, [n.d. 1910?] GB-Ckc.\n\nI feel I didn’t say enough to thank you for all you did on Friday – & what an honour I feel it that you & the rest of you shd have thought of this scheme – I hope the musical result did not altogether disappoint. I thought the audience was splendid in quality – very sympathetic & attentive – and determined to give the music the best possible chance. Elwes & the players agreed that they had never performed to a better audience.’30\n\nIn 1914, Dent, Browne and George Butterworth (who was killed at the Somme in 1916), helped Vaughan Williams to reconstruct the performing materials of his A London Symphony. The score had been sent to Germany for the purposes of publication but was now considered irretrievable. In July, Vaughan Williams and his wife took Dent’s house at 10, Madingley Road for a fortnight. Then, in August, the whole of Europe was thrown into chaos with the outbreak of war, and in December 1914, Vaughan Williams, at 42, enlisted as a private soldier. This curtailed their correspondence until 1918.\n\nBetween 2 and 8 June 1923 Cambridge hosted a major festival of British music in which Vaughan Williams was well represented. Some of his folksong arrangements were sung as part of a programme in King’s College chapel by the English Singers; Nevile’s Court in Trinity was the setting for the festival’s new commission, Vaughan Williams’s ballet Old King Cole and in Trinity chapel, his music featured in a recital given by Gray. The culmination of the festival was a choral and orchestral concert by CUMS highlighting works by ‘five living Cambridge composers’: Gibbs, Stanford, Rootham, Wood and Vaughan Williams who was represented by a performance of A London Symphony. 31\n\nIn 1924, Stanford intended to resign his post as Professor of Music, but before he could do so, he died on 29 March. With the post vacant there was some speculation about who might be appointed. Vaughan Williams was adamant that it should be offered to Dent, but heard rumours that he would not put himself forward:\n\nI hope you won’t mind me butting in on the subject of the Cambridge Professorship. I hear a report that you do not propose to stand for it. I hope this is not true. I admit that what the authorities ought to do is to offer it you without your applying. But I believe they are so hide bound\n\n30 Letter from Vaughan Williams to Dent, [n.d. May 1910?] GB-Kcc. 31 Thompson, H., ‘The Cambridge Festival of British Music’, Musical Times, lxiv (July, 1923), 488.\n\nthat they will not go outside their custom, which is only to consider those who have applied. I feel it so very important for music in England that you should have the position – in fact if I may make so bold I think it is your duty to offer yourself.32\n\nWord reached Vaughan Williams that Charles Wood had applied and that he seemed the likely candidate. This, however, did not deter him from believing that Dent was the best person for the job: ‘I’ve written to the V. C. with great pleasure – you are the one person I want to see in that post. You’ve never had your deserts yet. I hear a rumour (confidential) that they may appoint C. W. and offer you a readership. – I do hope you wd pocket the insult & accept it, if this be so – Because, to my mind, you wd then be professor de facto tho’ not de jure - & it wd be splendid for Cambridge.’33 Yet, there were those at Cambridge, among the Faculty Board responsible for the election of the Chair of Music, who wondered if Vaughan Williams himself might apply for the position. At 52, Vaughan Williams’s reputation was now riding high, and he was enjoying significant success as a composer. Traditionally the Professorship had always been occupied by a composer and the appointment of Vaughan Williams would bring substantial prestige to the University. Dent, on the other hand, was a musicologist, a discipline which had never been associated with the Chair of Music. Vaughan Williams’s reaction was typically modest and selfeffacing, but it is also evident that such a position would circumscribe his time for creativity. ‘I did not stand for the post,’ he told T. H. Marshall, ‘entirely because I thought (and still think) that I am not a “fit and proper person”. People will not realize what an appallingly illiterate person I am – both in ancient & modern music – Nor have I had more than a very little experience of teaching and organising. My whole life has been taken up (in the intervals of earning a living) with trying to become a composer – & I look forward now that I can drop some of my outside work to trying to really learn the job of a composer – which I have as yet failed to do – before I am too old to do anything.’34 In the event, Charles Wood was appointed, though remained in post for only two years before his death in 1926. At this point Dent was elected and held the position until 1941. That same year the Music Faculty Board invited Vaughan Williams to act as external examiner for the music degrees which were now healthily functioning under Stanford’s reforms.\n\n32 Letter from Vaughan Williams to Dent, [n.d. before 5 June 1924?] GB-Kcc. 33 Letter from Vaughan Williams to Dent, [n.d. c. September 1924] GB-Kcc. 34 Letter from Vaughan Williams to T. H. Marshall, GB-Lbl Add. MS 69816, ff.1–7.\n\nAfter Dent’s retirement in 1941, there was a period of inter regnum for the Chair of Music, and no appointment was made until 1946, when Patrick Hadley, an RCM pupil of Vaughan Williams was appointed. Through Hadley, a student performance of one of Vaughan Williams’s most personal works, his opera The Pilgrim’s Progress, took place in the Cambridge Guildhall in 1954, one which met with considerable enthusiasm from the composer after its lukewarm production at Covent Garden in 1951. This was a happy time for the composer, now 82. Though it was a cold February, his experience of the city and University seemed to ignite old memories. ‘We have had a lovely time here since Saturday,’ he wrote to Michael and Eslyn Kennedy; ‘The cold is horrid, but we have been to see a lot of friends, enjoyed the Fitzwilliam, heard evensong (by candlelight) twice at Kings, & yesterday morning the Byrd 5 part Mass. It’s wonderful to sit in that divine place with all the colours of the world in the window, & hear Byrd, all at once.’35 The death of his old friend, Ralph Wedgwood in 1956, also caused him fondly to reminisce in a letter he wrote to The Times in September: ‘Our intimacy began in 1892 when we were both freshmen at Trinity College, Cambridge; and in spite of very diverse careers and interests our friendship has continued unbroken. We last met less than a fortnight ago when we had a delightful talk over old times. A man of Wedgwood’s mental calibre was naturally sought after by all the young intellectuals of Cambridge, and owing to my friendship with him, I also was admitted to the magic circle. Our chief intimates were Maurice Sheldon-Amos, G. W. Moore, and George Trevelyan. In this company we had many happy summer reading parties.’36 Cambridge clearly meant a great deal to him. It had been where he had forged many cherished relationships and where, through sheer hard graft and application, he achieved his professional musical qualifications. But, more importantly, it was at Cambridge that he conquered his innate shyness where he ultimately underwent an intellectual transformation. Indeed, it might be argued that, in the pages of An Oxford Elegy (for which read ‘Cambridge’ rather than ‘Oxford’) – his deeply affecting pastoral setting of Matthew Arnold’s two poems The Scholar Gypsy and Thyrsis – that the composer attempted to express that yearning for a personal, philosophical and artistic epiphany, or as Arnold put it – ‘waiting for the spark from heaven to fall.’\n\n35 Letter from Vaughan Williams to Michael and Eslyn Kennedy, 3 February [1954], GB-Lbl"
