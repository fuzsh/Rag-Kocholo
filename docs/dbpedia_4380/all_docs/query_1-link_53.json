        "text": "These recordings were originally held on the website of the Market Research Society and so were not widely known outside of the market research world. The AMSR has now taken over responsibility for hosting and promoting this invaluable historical resource. We hope that they will now be of wider interest and more easily accessible.\n\nLawrence Bailey was the key initiator of the project and he quoted the Centre for Urban History at Leicester University as saying that Oral History is “the recording, preservation and interpretation of historical information, based on the personal experiences and opinions of the speaker… It is an invaluable way of preserving the knowledge and understanding of older people.”\n\nWith his background in qualitative research, Lawrence was the ideal first interviewer. He has now handed over to a small team of other experienced qualitative researchers.\n\nLawrence’s original idea was to interview in “a style not unlike Desert Island Discs (without the music!), in which plenty of time would be devoted to reminiscence and narrative regarding the events and people that have shaped and developed market research… hoping that the interviews would bring out the character and interests of the interviewees as well as their knowledge about phases in the development of the industry, and the research activities that they themselves have been involved in.”\n\nSince this early start, the focus has shifted to include the major contributions those being interviewed have made to the market research industry, such as key developments in market research techniques, the development of new businesses and the cultural context in which everyone worked and clients marketed and advertised their products and services.\n\nIn addition to these sound recordings, there is also video of an interview with Bill Schlackman, one of the founders of UK qualitative research, conducted jointly with Simon Patterson. Click here to view the this video.\n\nThe AMSR is grateful to the Research Network for providing us with this valuable resource. We are pleased that they will continue with their programme of Oral History interviews. There will therefore be updates to the list of people and their audio contributions from time to time.\n\nMarie Alexander\n\nAlthough born in England in 1931, Marie’s early years were spent following her father’s Royal Air Force postings. She returned for school, but when she left with her Higher School Certificate aged 16 she had no intention of going on to university. She trained first as a nurse then worked as a secretary/PA in the fashion industry.\n\nEventually, with a desire to broaden her career options, she attended Durham University and graduated in philosophy and psychology in 1957. Marie’s first job in market research was in the Unilever-owned Research Bureau Limited, after which she worked as a buyer of research for various advertising agencies.\n\nMarie eventually specialised in employment research. In 1973 she became Personnel Research Director at Social Policy Research, then took on a five-year contract within the Manpower Services Commission of the Civil Service. In 1981 she joined RSGB and stayed there until 1994, after which she worked as an independent consultant.\n\nMarie retired in 2001. During her career she was a full member of MRS, serving on the Professional Standards Committee and Code of Conduct query panel. Marie was a member and later Chairman of the ICG and a founder member of the SRA. She became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1993.\n\nMarie Alexander (deceased 2023)\n\nInterview date: 9th September 2011\n\nInterviewed at home in Maida Vale, London, by Lawrence Bailey\n\nEditor: Lawrence Bailey\n\nBook choice: The Consumer Market Research Handbook (1986) by Robert M. Worcester & John Downham\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nHugh Bain\n\nHugh grew up in Malaya, spending the latter part of WW2 in India as a refugee from the Japanese invasion and coming to live in the UK in 1950. After National Service in the RAF, he attended LSE, gaining a BSc in Economics, Sociology and Social Psychology in 1955.\n\nHe began his research career at Kellams Research, then worked in Unilever for six years (at Lintas as consultant psychologist, and at RBL in the Technical Control & Development group developing consumer research methodology for Unilever’s Market Research Development Committee) before being appointed a Director of KBMS (part of the AGB group).\n\nHugh realised early on that he was a square peg which did not fit easily into round holes. He had no desire to progress down a corporate management path, preferring to continue working as a researcher, which he recognised was what he enjoyed and did best. In 1973 he set up his own company, Hugh Bain Research, with his wife (and former client) Jane. The benefits of being freed from the pressures and constraints of a conventional large organisation far outweighed risks inherent in ‘going it alone’.\n\nHugh believed in a problem-solving approach to research, using a range of skills as appropriate to resolve each task in hand. A highly skilled qualitative interviewer, he was equally at home with quantitative methods and academic statistical analysis, notably developing innovative multivariate fragrance research techniques. He continued to work on a wide range of projects in the UK and internationally, always to his own high and exacting standards, until ill-health intervened in 2001.\n\nHugh then returned to his first love, photography. He always carried a camera and photographed anything and everything which interested him, increasingly enjoying watching and taking pictures of the bird-life on and beside the River Thames, near his home in Hammersmith.\n\nHugh Bain (deceased 2017)\n\nInterview dates: 26th June 2016, 18th November 2016\n\nInterviewed by Neil McPhee at Home in Hammersmith, London\n\nEditor: Tom Knott\n\nBook Choice: ‘Good-bye to all that’ (Robert Graves), ‘Catch 22’ (Joseph Heller) and ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’ and ’Through the Looking Glass’ (Lewis Carroll)\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nPeter Bartram\n\nPeter was born in Singapore in 1940, spent his early childhood in Australia, and then back in England was educated at Christ’s Hospital and Fitzwilliam College Cambridge.\n\nFour years at NOP and two years at the Thomson Organisation were followed in 1969 by setting up Louis Harris Research, conducting regular opinion surveys for the Daily Express. Later, with the parent Harris firm in New York and Los Angeles, he conducted much innovative research for various service industries, including the major film studios. He returned to the UK in 1978 as European Research Director, and later UK Card Marketing Director, at American Express. In 1985 he set up Applied Research and Communications (ARC) which later merged with the City Research Group.\n\nThe Market Research Society has been central to his career: briefly co-Editor of the Journal in 1972, he served on various committees before being elected MRS Chairman in 1989. Above all, being concerned that those who built the research industry should remain connected and remembered, he founded the Research Network in 2002, and he continues to work for the Archive of Market and Social Research, of which he is a Trustee.\n\nIn 1964 he met Mary at NOP, and stayed happily married to her from 1971 until her premature death in 2006. Her distinguished career in research with NOP, RSGB, BMRB, the English Tourist Board and British Airways deserves to be remembered as fully as any in this list of oral histories.\n\nPeter Bartram\n\nInterview date: 23rd June 2016\n\nInterviewed at Home by Neil McPhee\n\nEditor: Neil McPhee\n\nBook Choice: Stanley Le Baron Payne, The Art of Asking Questions, Studies in Public Opinion / Carl Sandburg, Abraham Lincoln, The Prairie Yeas and the War Years\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nBill Blyth\n\nBill studied Economics and Statistics at Exeter University, where he first encountered market research. His first job was at BMRB, joining in 1970. He left in 1974 to be Statistician (later Chief Statistician and Director) at MIL. In 1982 he moved to AGB as a Director. You could consider that was Bill’s last place of employment but the company ownership changed hands- Robert Maxwell, TNS and WPP, and his job changed a number of times as well, meaning a varied career with different responsibilities, colleagues and even locations over more than 30 years.\n\nBill’s first success was the Blyth/Marchant sampling technique which was used in both the Essex University study of the 1974 election, and the revised sampling method of the National Readership Survey. This was the only time that RSL ever lost the contract for the study. At MIL he designed the Farmstat Panel of farmers, with a random sample using Ordnance Survey small scale maps.\n\nAt AGB, Bill was instrumental in improving panel data quality and in turning the TCA/TCPI/Attwood panels into the new electronic creation and development of Superpanel, a self-completion panel, which still continues today around the world as Kantar World Panel. He also pioneered the use of speech recognition and technology in the late 1980’s and 90’s and later went on to design the large scale studies, Eurobarometer, in both face to face and telephone research across the whole of the European Union.\n\nFor most of his career, Bill was active in giving papers at conferences and seminars, including papers at ESOMAR as well as the MRS Conference, some of which were then published in the IJMRS. He won awards for best paper and was selected for papers in both the first and second halves of the first 50 years’ best research.\n\nDuring all this time, Bill was very active in the market research world. He was a member of the R&D committee for 5 years, an MRS Council Member, during which time he ran the Academic Standards and Education committee, became Treasurer and then Chairman of Council. He introduced the first MRS accredited qualification in 1985.\n\nBill was actively involved in AMSO for nearly 10 years and, while he was Chairman, he led the merger between AMSO and ABMRC, the other industry body. Whilst on the AMSO board he was also the AMSO representative on the EFAMRO board and was Chairman for two years in the 1990’s.\n\nOne of Bill’s market research ‘passions’ has been his concern about quality standards, both in terms of training young people and in terms of the transparency and quality of the services provided by market research agencies to their clients. From 1994 he was actively involved in designing the first BSI type standard for market research in the world. Bill was a member of MRQSA, which ran this group in the UK, and was instrumental in forming the ISO for Market Research in 2002. He became Chairman of the group in 2008. From 2010 he was a member of ESOMAR’s Research & Development Committee.\n\nFor his contribution to the statistical and market research world, he was awarded a Gold Medal by the MRS in 2017.\n\nHe met Sue Robson when they both started work on the same day at BMRB, in 1970. They married in 1981 and have two children. Now that he is retired, he can spend more time on his other ‘passions’ – apart from family, these are gardening and playing the piano.\n\nBill Blyth\n\nInterview date: 3rd September 2019\n\nInterviewed at home in London, by Graham Woodham\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice: The Good Soldier Svejk– Jaroslav Hasek\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nTim Bowles\n\nTim Bowles attended Midhurst Grammar School in his home town in rural Sussex. After studying mathematics and sciences, he went on to the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where he graduated in Psychology and Philosophy in 1965. For the following six years he worked as an experimental psychologist, initially working on road safety at the Road Research Laboratory and subsequently on human factors at Post Office Telecommunications (later BT).\n\nHe started his career in market research when he joined Bill Schlackman’s research company in 1971. Over the next seven years he built up a group of researchers with a strong reputation in studies involving close integration of qualitative and quantitative methods and a client base that included consumer goods and the public sector.\n\nIn 1978 he was approached by the AGB Group to manage their ad hoc research arm, RSGB and remained at AGB for eight years. For the last five of those years he took responsibility for AGB’s core UK consumer panel business and led the team that made major changes to data collection and analysis in the face of stiff competition in the syndicated data marketplace.\n\nIn 1986, relishing the opportunity to gain international experience, he joined the JWT Group as Managing Director (and later CEO) of the MRB Group, which comprised JWT’s market research interests in different parts of the world. In the following nine years, MRB Group grew steadily through development of the existing businesses and a series of acquisitions to extend international coverage. Meanwhile, JWT Group had been acquired by WPP, and MRB was eventually absorbed into the newly formed Kantar Research.\n\nIn 1995, Tim joined Chicago based IRI (Information Resources Inc) to run its newly formed European business, marketing supermarket scanning data and analysis in direct competition with A.C.Nielsen, the dominant global supplier of retail data at that time. Over the following eight years, he led the team that built a retail data business that rivalled Nielsen in Europe, and became President of all the IRI businesses outside the USA.\n\nOn his 60th birthday in 2003, he retired from IRI, with the vague intent to become a (very) mature mountain guide. Somehow, that never quite worked out and over the next five years, he performed interim senior management roles in NPD (Retailer Strategy), Synovate (CEO Western Europe) and TNS (COO North America). He stopped paid work in 2009, by which time he was too old to be a mountain guide.\n\nHe was a Fellow of the MRS and served on the Research and Development Committee, as well as teaching on MRS courses and at the Summer School. He served for many years on the Council of AMSO (Association of Market Survey Organisations) and was responsible for the annual industry statistics.\n\nOutside the market research industry, he served on the council of the Marketing Group of Great Britain, both as Secretary and Chairman. He served as Trustee on the Management Council of OXFAM and on the board of CPRE (Campaign to Protect Rural England), where he steered a major review of the charity’s mission and corporate identity.\n\nHe is a lifelong mountaineer and a member of the Alpine Club.\n\nTim Bowles\n\nInterview date: 27th January 2020\n\nInterviewed at home by Graham Woodham\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook Choice: Raymond Carver, Where I am calling from\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nMike Cooke\n\nMike began his career at National Opinion Polls in 1973 after studying at the London School of Economics (B.Sc. Econ) and the University of Economics (M.A. Political Behaviour) with teaching assistant posts at McGill University in Canada and the University of Essex.\n\nIn 1986 he established Numbers Market Research and Data Processing in a joint venture with MORI. He was very active in the Market Research Society’s training and regulatory programmes and an early member of the Market Research Development Fund and Benevolent Association.\n\nA Council member of the MRS and ESOMAR for many years, he was elected Vice President of the MRS in 1991 and of ESOMAR in 2010.\n\nHe is a well-known speaker on marketing research, and won the Market Research Society’s 1996 ‘Research Effectiveness Award’ for his research on music and education. At the ESOMAR 2007 Online Panels Conference, his paper ‘Market Measurement’ was nominated for the ESOMAR Excellence Award and his paper ‘Training the next generation’ of market researchers using Web 2.0. tools won both the ESOMAR 2007 Congress Award for ‘Best case study’ and the ESOMAR Excellence Award for the best paper presented at any ESOMAR event in 2007/8. In 2009, he jointly won the ESOMAR Financial Research Award for developing a hybrid online and offline approach to market measurement studies.\n\nHe has always been at the forefront of the application of new research techniques in research and media measurement, and was made an honorary research fellow at the University of Leeds for his work on the future of the internet.\n\nIn 2005, he joined GfK as the Global Director of GfK NOP’s Online Centre of Excellence, responsible for online strategy and research methodology, and subsequently became the Global Director for Online Access Panels in 32 countries.\n\nAfter retiring in 2016 he joined ESOMAR as Chair of their Legal Affairs Committee, monitoring regulations and lobbying on behalf of the research community in fields as diverse as GDPR, cross-border data transfers, ePrivacy and AI.\n\nMike Cooke\n\nInterview date: 21st March 2023\n\nInterviewed at home in London by Graham Woodham\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook Choice: The Grapes of Wrath – John Steinbeck\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nPam Edwards\n\nGraduating from Bristol in 1963 Pam started her career with the recently established Research Bureau Limited as a trainee. Two years later, she joined Colgate Palmolive, before moving to Nestle U.K. in 1969. At this time the department acted as an in-house full service market research agency for all Nestle U.K. brands.\n\nShe took a career break from 1974 to 1980 to establish her family of three sons, before moving to the Public Sector at Milton Keynes Development Corporation in the Economic Development Department. Towards the end of this time she was invited to return to Nestle U.K. as Marketing Research Manager.\n\nAfter twenty years involvement with a vast range of research issues during a period of unprecedented change in the food industry she left Nestle to set up Research Connections Limited, offering consultancy to major multinational clients in the food and drinks industry. The company was involved in qualitative and quantitative research, but the main focus was on a major tracking survey and the management of the National Drinks Survey. These two major quantitative surveys provided the basis for the development of new complementary analytical techniques.\n\nSince retiring in 2008, Pam with her lifelong interest in gardening, gained a Diploma in Horticulture and has qualified as a judge for the National Vegetable Society.\n\nPam Edwards\n\nInterview date: 14th July 2016\n\nInterviewed at Home in Ashstead, by Neil McPhee\n\nEditor: Neil McPhee\n\nBook choice: ‘A Cook and His Vegetable Patch’ Hardcover by Nigel Slater\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nPaul Feldwick\n\nPaul Feldwick was born in 1952. He won a scholarship to Monmouth School and then read English at Trinity College, Oxford. In 1974 he accepted a job as account management trainee at Boase Massimi Pollitt, a rising London ad agency famous for its popular campaigns (Honey Monster, Smash Martians, etc) and its novelty ‘account planning’.\n\nAfter six months as the world’s worst account man he was grateful to slip into account planning at BMP, where he stayed for the next thirty years. Account planners were then very hands-on qual and quant researchers, and he became a member (eventually a Fellow) of the MRS, and a frequent speaker at the MRS Conference.\n\nHe was Convenor of Judges for the IPA Effectiveness Awards in 1988/90, and also served as Chair of both the APG and the AQR. He has published many papers on advertising and research, and two books: What is Brand Equity Anyway? (2002) and The Anatomy of Humbug(2015). In the latter part of his career at BMP, which became part of the DDB network, he worked in a global training and development role. Since leaving the agency in 2005 he has worked as a consultant and completed an MSc in Organisational Consulting.\n\nPaul Feldwick\n\nInterview date: 8th November 2016\n\nInterviewed at Home by Neil McPhee\n\nEditor: Neil McPhee\n\nBook Choice: Gareth Morgan, Images of Organisation\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nJohn Goodyear\n\nTo many in the research world John always seemed rather larger than life, an exciting and ebullient personality, as people meeting him would agree. He didn’t fit one’s idea of the introverted and academic researcher, but a researcher is what he was, all his working life.\n\nJohn had his first encounter with market research in the early years at college, and through a process of self-teaching and exposure from existing practitioners, such as Bill Schlackman, Alex Kondos, and many others, he acquired a basic grounding in qualitative and quantitative methodologies and their application to the world of advertising and marketing.\n\nShortly after getting his degree, in 1965, he started his first company – ‘MBL’ (Market Behaviour Ltd, London) – which soon became well-known amongst research buyers, especially those who wanted to understand what motivated their purchasers – ‘what makes the consumer tick’. John was a good salesman but more importantly he understood the clients’ information requirements, and he always told it as it was.\n\nHe stayed working as a hands-on researcher for fifteen years, but became increasingly active in research organisations and educational initiatives. He was Chairman of AMSO, on the International and Education Committees of the Market Research Society, very much involved in ESOMAR, and an invited speaker at many conferences and seminars around the world, including the United States, Australia, The Middle East, Hong Kong, India and the Philippines. He also had papers published in various research and associated publications.\n\nFrom the early Eighties, after a short period of working with MBL as part of JWT, John decided he wanted to go back to being his own boss. He recognised the potential of international research and started to put together what became The MBL Group of companies. This eventually provided a problem-solving service in over 100 markets, including smaller countries which didn’t have a solid research infrastructure but whose manufacturers wanted to develop the skills of modern thinking about brands. And so from being manager-owner of one small company in 1965 John became the Chairman and Chief Executive of The MBL Group, which totalled 28 offices across 19 countries.\n\nJohn Goodyear (deceased 2019)\n\nInterview date: 26th May 2015\n\nInterviewed at home in London, by Lawrence Bailey and Simon Patterson\n\nEditor: Lawrence Bailey\n\nBook choice: Atlas Shrugged – Ayn Rand (Penguin Classics, 2007)\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nMary Goodyear\n\nLike many people of her generation, Mary became a researcher by happenstance and until recently had been still wondering what to do when she grows up. She became a qualitative researcher because university friends were doing it to make extra money in the vacations, and she got hooked by the fascination of being paid to ask people questions and find out they did with their money and why.\n\nAfter she graduated in Psychology from University College London, she joined John Goodyear, together with another psychologist, Alan Beckett, in the newly created Market Behaviour Limited, where she stayed for the rest of her career.\n\nShe thoroughly enjoyed the diversity of the job: the different clients and market sectors and the variety of approaches to the research process –every week was different, every project was new and the job took her all over the country. Best of all, the respondents were completely unpredictable, some of them and what they said are still remembered to this day.\n\nThe interest level increased a hundredfold when she was commissioned in 1971 to carry out a study by Beecham in India: 45 groups in six different locations; it was an education and a profound pleasure. And from then on she pursued as much international work as possible. Each new country presented something surprising in terms of how products were classified and used. Later on she was involved in multi -country co-ordinated research where often the research objective was to see how far an ad campaign could be ‘stretched’ to appeal to say consumers in three different continents, and which part of the marketing mix had to be unique to specific countries.\n\nMary gave many lectures about international research, especially West Africa, which in all its unfamiliarity and vitality was her favourite stamping ground. She was also a keen member of ESOMAR in the early nineties and became their first woman President.\n\nFinally, along with John Goodyear, she was an integral part of the MBL Group of Companies, until they were sold to NFO in the 1990’s.\n\nMary Goodyear\n\nInterview date: 26th May 2015\n\nInterviewed at home in London, by Lawrence Bailey and Simon Patterson\n\nEditor: Lawrence Bailey\n\nBook choice: The New Oxford Book of English Verse – Helen Gardner (ed.)

Through doing the daily survey she met other interviewers and was introduced to Gordon Simmonds, NOP and Field Control and started working with them. In December 1976 the family moved from Sittingbourne in Kent to Ottershaw in Surrey. Hilary Hopkins invited Linda to lunch in 1978 and offered her the job as a supervisor for Field Control which was very unexpected. Over the next years she became supervisor for Interviewing Services, Campbell Daniels and Plus 4. In 1982 Martin Daniels and Rob Jones suggested the three of them form a company and in February 1983 The New Fieldwork Co Ltd was formed. Linda has always been a big supporter of all field-related issues and was on field committee for many years. She was elected to MRS Council in 1996 and served until 2004. In that same year, she joined the MRBA as a fundraiser in 2004 and is still an active member as of 2022. She was made a fellow of the Market Research Society for her work and dedication to field related issues.\n\nLinda Henshall\n\nInterview date: 18th October 2021\n\nInterviewed at home by Judith Wardle\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook Choice: The Life in Research – Peter Bartram\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nJohn is a fellow of the UK’s Market Research Society and a past President of ESOMAR – the World Association of Market Research Professionals. He has been engaged in market research for 47 years, with much of that time devoted to researching both B2B and Consumer markets across the world.\n\nPrimarily John considers himself to be more of a quantitative than a qualitative research specialist; the need to assist such clients as Gillette, Pepsi Cola, Fedex and Intel (to name a few) has ensured that he is equally comfortable with both disciplines. Indeed, frequently a multi-country project with the objective of understanding the potential value of ‘new’ markets has required that both disciplines will be effectively employed.\n\nNevertheless it was as a ‘quant’ man that he first became involved with research, originally a data analyst he soon became a partner in an agency responsible for developing a number of DP analysis packages that eventually become industry standard across the world. John was also one of the persons instrumental in completing the very first Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) project in Europe.\n\nIn total John’s work has involved visiting 60 different countries and other territories where face to face guidance was not required.\n\nIn addition to his commercial work, John has been an active contributor to the development of the profession as a convenor of, or speaker in, many industry related seminars and educational courses; both in the UK and elsewhere, on behalf of the MRS, ESOMAR, CASRO and others. He also contributed the “International Chapter” in the 4th Edition of ESOMAR’s Market and Opinion Research Handbook (published 1998) and the chapter “Key Cornerstones of the Research Process” in the 5thEdition of the same publication, published in September 2007.\n\nWorkshops, presentations and chapters for industry publications represent only part of John’s contributions to the research profession. Within the UK he was instrumental in creating the British Market Research Association (BMRA) from two predecessor trade associations; AMSO covering larger companies and ABMRC smaller institutes. BMRA activities are now covered by the UK Market Research Society Company Partner Scheme.\n\nHe joined ESOMAR, the World Association of Market Research Professionals, in 1975 and became UK National Representative in 1988, joining council in 1994 to become Vice-President in 1999 and President for the years 2001 and 2002.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2006 he was a Director of Marketing Research Institute International (MRII) the US Market Research distanced-learning body based in the University of Georgia. He became President of the organisation in 2007 and was elected an International Emeritus Director in 2009.\n\nAdditionally John was a member of the UK Government’s Department North American Advisory Group through the period 1996 to 2000.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nInterview date: 19th April 2023\n\nInterviewed in London by Judith Wardle\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook Choice: East of Eden – John Steinbeck (favourite character: the unassuming cook)\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nMike Kirkham\n\nBefore going to university in 1964, Mike was fascinated by the regular publication of opinion polls ahead of the general election later that year. He was intrigued by the idea that questioning just 1000 people about voting intentions could provide a reasonably accurate guide to the election results.\n\nAfter leaving Oxford University with a degree in PPE, he started his professional career at the Milk Marketing Board as an economist. There, his latent interest in sample survey research was re-awakened as a user.\n\nThis led to his joining AGB in 1970. Here, he worked initially on consumer panel research for clients such as Cadbury-Schweppes, Unilever and London Weekend Television. Later he became head of the Television Audience Measurement division, working with JICTAR and BARB. At that time the television landscape was fairly simple, with just three channels (BBC1, BBC 2 & ITV) available throughout the country. But with the arrival of new technologies and with deregulation, that was about to change.\n\nIn order to meet the challenges posed by this revolution in broadcasting, it was clear that the whole system of measurement would need to change. Mike persuaded the management of AGB to invest in the application of new technology, which led to the development of the peoplemeter system.\n\nThrough its network of overseas subsidiaries and partners, AGB succeeded in introducing this technique to a large number of countries. However, its failure in attempting to challenge Nielsen in the USA led to a financial crisis; this resulted in the company being bought by Robert Maxwell. With the subsequent collapse of the Maxwell empire, AGB was put into administration. Most of the overseas businesses were sold to management buyouts and the UK business was acquired by Taylor Nelson (TN). Mike joined the board of TN and helped to raise the funding to permit the acquisition of AGB.\n\nThere followed a very stimulating period in Mike’s career. TN was able to grow rapidly, both organically and through acquisition. Most important amongst these was SOFRES which added extensively to the geographic coverage of the business. Mike’s initial responsibilities covered the continuous services businesses, consumer panels and media measurement. Later, he focused on developing the survey business, along the lines of industry sectors – pharmaceuticals, automotive, telecoms/IT, fmcg – with particular emphasis on multi-national clients.\n\nIn 2001, Mike was appointed CEO of the company, now renamed Taylor Nelson Sofres, which grew to become one of the FTSE 250 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. With subsidiaries in more than 70 countries and 15,000 employees, TNS became the largest survey research organisation in the world.\n\nMike stood down in 2006 and was able to reflect on a career working with a wide range of talented people. He was especially fortunate to work very closely with Doug Brown, one of the founders of AGB and Tony Cowling of TN; for both of them, he retains a deep affection and respect.\n\nSince leaving TN and the research industry, Mike has been a non-Executive Director and Chairman of a number of both public and private companies. With his wife Margaret, he lives in West London and they have two adult children and a number of grandchildren. They travel extensively and share interests in film, theatre and cooking. He is competent in several languages, writes limericks in French and is pre-occupied with the fortunes of Aston Villa Football Club.\n\nMike Kirkham\n\nInterview date: 5th October 2023\n\nInterviewed at home in West London by Graham Woodham\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook Choice: 1984 by George Orwell\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nPhyllis Macfarlane\n\nBorn a long time ago now and educated at Bolton School, Macclesfield High School and University College London, I will always be grateful to the Careers Advisor at London University who said ‘Have you thought about Market Research?’. Because up until that point (I was studying Maths) I’d only ever been advised to teach or go into Accountancy or Auditing(!). My response to him at the time, I’m very sorry to admit, was ‘What’s that?’. But from that point I never did look back. A life in research beckoned and what a wonderful industry it was that I joined! It seemed that there were new ideas and things to learn and develop every day… telephone research, mass B2B sampling, DP systems, international research… and that’s just the early years! Also clever, entrepreneurial and interesting people to learn from and work with.\n\nAnyway – back to graduation in 1969, I joined Market Investigations Ltd (MIL) as an Assistant Statistician and suddenly saw the point of statistics.\n\nIt was a heady time – MIL focussed on non-fmcg sectors – so it was Healthcare, Agriculture and increasingly B2B projects for me (sampling and weighting, mainly).\n\nObserving and experiencing the dire straits of the analysis aspects of MR in the early 70’s, Tony Dent and Sydney Johnson set up Denjon in 1974 with Ed Ross – who developed an interactive programme – Quantum, run on a mini- computer. I joined them and the world was our ‘lobster’ for a while – but Ed left to set up Quantime in 1978. Denjon then went on to develop Merlin with Keith Hughes and Andy Collins, but the early 80’s were tough times – there was no money to buy new systems, let alone expensive new computers, which were the price of a London House during that period.\n\nI went back to MIL in 1982 – to their B2B company: Industrial Data Ltd (InDal) and became MD c1987.\n\nMIL went public in 1986 and was bought by MAI (which became UBM, now part of Informa) in 1989, and was then merged with NOP.\n\nInDal became NOP Corporate and Financial, NOP developed to become NOP World and I became MD of NOP UK in 2000.\n\nIn 2005, NOP World was bought by GfK, the UK company became GfK NOP, absorbed Martyn Hamlyn (which had been GfK’s UK business) and became properly global (which wasn’t quite as exciting as we’d hoped).\n\nI stepped down from the MD role in 2010 – then developed GfK’s Global Training programme and spent a further 8 years working with the GfK Verein (Foundation) on a project to develop market research education in Africa. Post Graduate degrees were set up in Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa, along with interviewer training in those countries, supporting the local Market Research Associations to drive quality. It was wonderful to get involved with other market research communities, and also the world of development and NGO’s.\n\nAfter that particular project was complete (in 2015) I carried on working with the GfK Verein delivering Guest Lecture weekends for the University of Nairobi, (until the Masters degree was deemed sustainable) and also for several years running Summer Schools in Innovation and Market Research at CUFE – the Chinese Central University of Finance and Economics, in Beijing.\n\nI also had the time to spend on supporting the MRS as Chair and Board member, and ESOMAR Foundation as Treasurer, focussing on trying to educate NGO’s to do more research – there are far too many stories in the development world of projects going wrong because no-one talked to the people who were being helped! I also supported scholarships in post degree MR education for disadvantaged students in developing economies.\n\nOne of my current projects is as Chair of Contents for AMSR – the Archive of Market and Social Research, which is collecting research from the 70 years of the research industry’s existence in the UK. Having compiled a good collection of material – mainly pre-digital – we are now developing our user base and a ‘Modern’ collection.\n\nIt’s been a good life in research…\n\nPhyllis Macfarlane\n\nInterview date: 30th November 2021\n\nInterviewed at home by Graham Woodham\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook Choice: Brave New World – Aldous Huxley\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nNick Moon\n\nAfter six peripatetic years whilst his father was in the RAF, Nick grew up in St Albans. He graduated in History from Sidney Sussex College Cambridge, and after first being rejected for NOP’s graduate trainee pool, he was accepted at the second attempt when they realised that all the ones they had invited to interview were a lot better on paper than in person. After six months in one of the commercial research teams, the rotation took him next to Social Research, to which he attached himself, limpet-like, and stayed there for the next 38 years. During that time, the company changed from NOP to MAI, back to NOP, NOP World, GfK NOP, and finally just GfK, but he carried on doing opinion polls, exit polls and major government and academic surveys, without top management realising he was still there.\n\nTo his everlasting regret, he was unable to go to Bhopal when NOP did research there to measure the impact of the Union Carbide disaster, but his exit polling work did take him to Ukraine and Georgia several times, and also to Eastbourne.\n\nWhen he eventually got tired of being asked every week by the bean-counters to predict his next month’s sales figures, Nick decided the time was right to spend less effort allegedly managing, and more time actually involved in research, and he set up his own consultancy: Moonlight Research. (He rejected the first possible name of Moonshine, because of the dual connotations with illegality and claptrap.)\n\nAt Moonlight, Nick has mainly provided consultancy on survey methodology, although he was for two interesting years, Labour’s pollster in the Corbyn era.\n\nHe continues to work (very part-time) well past retirement age, mainly to fund an expensive habit of niche wildlife tourism and of following Chelsea FC around Europe.\n\nNick Moon\n\nInterview date: 8th November 2022\n\nInterviewed at home in St. Albans by Graham Woodham\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice: The Psychology of Survey Response – Roger Tourangeau\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nPeter Mouncey\n\nBorn in Birmingham in 1947, I attended Rhyl Grammar School in N. Wales, followed by three years as a Library Assistant in my then hometown of Prestatyn with the Flintshire County Library Service. I left N. Wales in 1968 to study for an HND in Business Studies and the Institute of Marketing’s Diploma at the then Ealing Technical College (where Margaret Crimp, a founder of the MRS Diploma, was a lecturer) and School of Art (famous popular musical alumni of the latter in the 1960s being Pete Townsend, Ronnie Wood & Freddie Mercury) in west London (now University of West London).\n\nAfter college, I joined the Market Research Department at the Gas Council in 1970, leaving in 1971 to join the Automobile Association as a Market Planner, working on a number of projects associated with new market ventures. When the AA moved the head office from Leicester Square to Basingstoke in 1973, I was appointed Head of Market Research, and subsequently Manager, Market Research – managing a very diverse and growing range of projects, reflecting the AA’s very dynamic diversification programme in that era and its high profile public policy role. The AA’s extensive research programme for the publishing division led to my appointment as a non-executive director of Book Marketing Ltd (now part of the Nielsen group), formed to develop the first annual survey of book buying and readership in the UK, working with Len England and Ted Whitley. The AA also extensively used postal methodology for research amongst members, which led to me joining the Consumer Association’s (Which?) Survey Advisory Panel until it was disbanded.\n\nAfter a career of 29 years with the AA, which also covered managing customer database development and marketing services; strategic development and leading CRM strategy, I left the senior management team in 2000 after the acquisition of the AA by Centrica, to set up independently. Since then, I’ve worked on consultancy projects for leading global companies; spend over 15 years as a Visiting Fellow at Cranfield University School of Management (specialising in research methods, key account management and marketing accountability), and, was Research Director of the Institute of Direct Marketing (IDM) for over ten years.\n\nI joined the MRS in 1973, becoming a Full member of the MRS in the late 1970s, and served on the MRS Meetings, Conference, Publications and Technical & Development Committees, before being elected as a Council member in the mid-1980s, and MRS Chair in 1990. A long-term member of the Market Research Society (MRS) Market Research Standards Board, I also set up and ran programmes of data privacy training courses for the MRS, the Social Research Association and other organisations between 2001-2018. I was appointed Editor in Chief of the MRS International Journal of Market Research in late 2004, a role held until retirement at the end of 2019. In addition to serving as Chair of the MRS, I’ve also served as chair of AURA and the Research Development Fund in the 1990s (leading a major project on co-operation in consumer and b2b research). I was awarded fellowships of both the MRS and IDM, was a Finalist for the MRS Silver Medal in 2004 and was extremely honoured to be awarded the MRS Gold Medal in 2019.\n\nIn addition to being author or presenter of written and conference papers, I was joint editor of ‘Market Research Best Practice, 30 visions for the future’ (ESOMAR/Wiley 2007) and joint author with Emeritus Professor Malcolm McDonald of ‘Marketing Accountability’ (Kogan Page 2009) and (also with Stan Maklan) of ‘Marketing Value Metrics’ (Kogan Page 2014).\n\nPeter Mouncey\n\nInterview date: 11th June 2018\n\nInterviewed at home in Shaftesbury, by Judith Wardle\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice: The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists –Robert Tressell, The Hidden Persuaders –Vance Packard\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nAdam Phillips\n\nAdam was born in London in 1949 and educated at Westminster School and Trinity Hall Cambridge, where he studied Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. After joining RBL, he spent 13 years with Research International working both in London and in Rotterdam where he and Jane learned to speak Dutch, made some good friends and started a family.\n\nIn 1983, he joined the MRB Group as Managing Director of Mass Observation. He worked in the MRB Group for 17 years, both in the UK and the USA. For 5 years he ran the MRS Summer School for more experienced young researchers. This was a time when the MRS could afford to run week long courses at the Grand Hotel in Eastbourne.\n\nIn 2000, he left BMRB and Euroquest to join Advanced Television Research as Managing Director. ATR had just been awarded the TV audience measurement contract by BARB. In 2002, he left ATR to set up Real Research.\n\nHe was Chairman of the MRS (1992-1993), a Fellow of the MRS and a Council Member of ESOMAR (1998-2004). He was Chair of ESOMAR’s Professional Standards Committee for 15 years and Chair of ESOMAR’s Legal and Public Affairs Committee for 5 years. He was awarded ESOMAR’s biennial John Downham Award for Excellence in 2015.\n\nAfter he retired from full-time market research in 2002, he took up long distance sailing. He visited the Arctic Circle in Greenland and Iceland, and sailed round Cape Horn while preparing for a journey to visit the Antarctic peninsula. He was a lay member of the Press Complaints Commission and Chair of the Financial Services Consumer Panel. He was also involved in setting up the Archive of Market and Social Research in 2014 and is the Archive’s Chief Executive.\n\nAdam Phillips\n\nInterview date: 8th October 2020\n\nInterviewed at home in Surrey by Graham Woodham\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice: Matt Ridley, The Rational Optimist: All the Adventures of a Curious Character, Richard P Feynman, edited by Ralph Leighton\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nJoy Reynolds\n\nIn 1961 Joy finished training at Exeter University and became a Child Care Officer for the Social Services of London County Council, working in Deptford.\n\nIn 1963, unsure whether she wanted to spend her entire life as a Social Worker, she took a job at Public Attitude Surveys (PAS) in Mortimer St, London, as a “full-time interviewer” – knowing nothing about market research at all! The job took her all over the country, interviewing about everything under the sun. Then she helped with training new interviewers. After a while, she was sent to Dublin, to Irish Marketing Surveys (the first market research company in Ireland, set up by Mass Observation, NOP and PAS). Here she looked after the field force for about 5 months whilst an Irish Field Manager was sought. Then she returned to PAS, and became Field Manager there, until October 1969.\n\nDuring the next 12 years, Joy did small amounts of interviewing and training interviewers for Taylor Nelson and A C Nielsen Consumer Research Division (and brought up three mischievous children).\n\nIn 1983 she became Field Manager at Nielsen Consumer Research, based in Oxford. The next 10 years were hectic, full of adventures, with a hugely varied client list, a great team of Supervisors, and about 500 interviewers; and towards the end, starting up a telephone unit in Newport, Gwent.\n\nIn 1993, with three colleagues, she embarked on a management buy-out from parent company AC Nielsen, and set up Market Research Solutions Ltd (MRSL). More adventures, but with the same clients and staff team – challenging, but huge fun. However eventually MRSL was sold to an American company looking for an English acquisition.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, she was involved with various Quality Standards and other developments at the MRS: serving on the IQCS Council, and then chairing the MRS Field Committee in 1991, followed by the Professional Standards Committee from 1992-1996; Vice-Chair of the MRS in 1996, and a Fellow in 1997. In 1990, together with a group of Field-based colleagues, Joy produced the first MRS Job Dictionary for interviewers, bringing some consistency to the tricky area of “social grading”! All in all, she says wouldn’t have missed a minute of it.\n\nJoy Reynolds\n\nInterview date: 25th April 2022\n\nInterviewed in London by Judith Wardle\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice(s): The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje; The Power of Geography and Prisoners of Geography by Tim Marshall; The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath; Anything by Julian Barnes\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nSue Robson\n\nSue was born and brought up in Kent and went to the local Direct Grant school on a scholarship. She studied sciences at A level as she initially wanted to be a Doctor, but she ended up studying PPP (Psychology, Philosophy and Physiology) at Somerville College Oxford when she realised she was more interested in people than in their illnesses.\n\nStarting her market research career at BMRB, Sue discovered qualitative research which was a great fit with her curiosity about people and their lives. BMRB gave her a solid grounding in all market research. Sue then joined MBL to focus on qualitative research with John and Mary Goodyear. She worked at MBL for 10 years, ending up as Managing Director. MBL’s reputation for quality married well with Sue’s own beliefs and values.\n\n1981 was a busy year as she got married, had her first child and started her own business, The Qualitative Consultancy, TQC. Her vision was to create a strong brand which would rival the best; to be an advocate for qualitative research, train others and develop new techniques of use to clients.\n\nSue ran training courses for the MRS including developing, in 1983, the very first course offering practical hands-on experience of moderating group discussions. This led to the book she wrote and co-edited with Angela Foster, Qualitative Research in Action, published in 1989.\n\nSue was a member of MRS Council from the 1980s, chairing committees including Professional Standards, Publications and PR. Sue was a founder member of AQR, believing that qualitative researchers needed their own strong voice, alongside the MRS.\n\nTQC closed down in 2002 and Sue worked as a consultant until retirement. She was an MRBA committee member for 10 years and then joined AMSR, chairing the Marketing Committee. Along with this she has got involved in fundraising and networking for her Oxford College and being Chairman of the Governors at a local independent girls’ school. In her free time, she studies Art History for the sheer pleasure of always learning something new.\n\nSue Robson\n\nInterview dates: 21st December 2016 and 10th April 2019\n\nInterviewed at home in London, by Lawrence Bailey and Judith Wardle\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice: Leo Tolstoy – Anna Karenina\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nGeoffrey Roughton\n\nGeoffrey was born in 1929. After military service, he went to Cambridge to study Engineering and English. He joined the Attwood Group in 1955, before leaving in 1957 to form MAS with John Robertson.\n\nAlthough initially a media consultancy, MAS soon began undertaking surveys. They were the first MR company in Europe to have an in-house computer (an IBM 1130); the first (of its size) to appoint a female director and the first private MR company to be sold to a PLC, eventually being absorbed into TNS.\n\nAfter MAS was taken over, Geoffrey joined Pulse Train, becoming acting CEO and Chairman before it became part of Confirmit in 2007. He was a Fellow of both MRS and the Royal Statistical Society, a Trustee and Chairman of a Housing Association and, after surviving some cardiac problems, he became Chairman of a Heart Support Group and was a British Heart Foundation Ambassador and award-winner.\n\nGeoffrey was a keen walker, bon-viveur and reader.

He returned to BMRB in 1978 and was Managing Director for the last 10 years up to his retirement in 1995.\n\nHe then worked as a Consultant to Camelot, and as an independent specialising in Expert Witness projects, until 2006, when he did an MA at Kingston University\n\nJohn lectured on more than 50 MRS education courses, worked on numerous Committees, and the MRS Council, serving as Chairman 1984-85. He was also on the Council of ESOMAR for many years. He frequently gave papers at both their Conferences, winning in all 7 Best Paper Awards. He was, uniquely, awarded both the MRS Silver and Gold medals and also the ESOMAR Silver medal.\n\nJohn chaired the Awards Panel for the MRS Conference for many years and was a long standing member of the Committee of the Market Research Benevolent Association.\n\nJohn Samuels\n\nInterview date: 1st July 2015\n\nInterviewed at MRS Office in London by Neil McPhee\n\nEditor: Holly Bedwell\n\nBook choice: ‘Collected Sonnets’, by Edna St. Vincent Millay (Harper Collins 1988)\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nBill Schlackman\n\nBorn in 1930, William ‘Bill’ Schlackman grew up in the Bronx, New York and studied Psychology at Brooklyn College. He then received his Masters in Psychology at City College, after which he practised clinical psychology at the Marlboro State Hospital, New Jersey, gaining experience in Psychoanalysis and the use of projective tests.\n\nPrior to his military service in 1954, Schlackman worked as a delivery boy. He was asked to collect a package from the Institute for Motivational Research and deliver it to the offices of True Magazine. Schlackman famously opened the package, discovering a report with the title ‘Why men read True Magazine’. After reading the study, he realised that this was something he could have done. He later went to the offices of the Institute for Motivational Research and expressed his interest in joining Ernest Dichter’s team. As he could not get a full-time job with them at the time, he decided to go into business for himself.\n\nIn 1956, Schlackman went back to Dichter at the Institute for Motivational Research with reports he had written whilst freelancing and a few articles he had written about packaging. He was hired on the spot.\n\nIn 1960, Schlackman moved to London to set up Ernest Dichter Associates of which he was the Managing Director. Soon after in 1961 he set up his own business, William Schlackman Limited. Being an active member of the MRS and supporter of the AQR, he presented a number of papers at MRS conferences between 1961 and 1986.\n\nLater retired and living in Florida with his wife Joan, Bill Schlackman was known as the ‘Father of Qualitative Research’ in the UK, someone who strove to achieve a deeper understanding of consumer motivations through the use of experimental research design as well as projective and motivational techniques.\n\nWilliam ‘Bill’ Schlackman (deceased 2019)\n\nInterview dates: 7th and 8th May 2013\n\nInterviewed at home in Fort Myers, Florida, USA, by Lawrence Bailey and Simon Patterson\n\nEditor: Lawrence Bailey\n\nBook choice: The Post-American World: and the Rise of the Rest by Fareed Zakaria (2008)\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nMartin Simmons\n\nMartin studied statistics at the London School of Economics, graduating with a BSc in Economics (1953). After National Service he started his career in market research, largely influenced by Alan Stuart, a brilliant lecturer later to be head of the statistics department at LSE.\n\nIn November 1955, Martin was appointed research executive at Sales Research Services owned by Bill Coglan, a founder member of MRS. At that time there were about a dozen research agencies in the UK, mostly owned by advertising agencies. He progressed to Research Director and was then persuaded by Bert De Vos to leave SRS in 1959 and set up a retail company with him at Gallup Poll.\n\nMartin, as a Director, built up a profitable retail speciality over his decade at Gallup Poll. In October 1969 he and Lionel Gordon jointly set up Gordon Simmons Research which was to specialise in retail, financial and business-to-business research. In August 1993, the company was sold to Opinion Research Corporation.\n\nMartin was heavily involved in supporting MRS and ESOMAR. He was elected to the MRS Council in 1969, chairing the Publications Committee. Over the following years, he presented papers at MRS and ESOMAR annual conferences and at the Institute of Grocery Distribution. He convened seminars on retail research for MRS at Cambridge, at the Lygon Arms in Broadway, at the Penns Hall Hotel in Sutton Coldfield; and for ESOMAR in Amsterdam. He also lectured at the MRS Summer School for several years.\n\nMartin Simmons (deceased 2015)\n\nInterviewed date: 21st December 2011\n\nInterviewed at home in Hendon, London, by Lawrence Bailey\n\nEditor: John Flattery\n\nBook choice: Moviola by Garson Kanin (Bookthrift, 1979)\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nNigel Spackman\n\nNigel entered market research by accident without knowing what it was. He had a well-organised friend at Liverpool University who had decided on MR as a career, which led Nigel to assume that he might be qualified for this path when he saw an ad for a graduate trainee vacancy at Nestle. Somehow, they chose him, and he discovered he enjoyed it.\n\nAfter a few years he moved on to the Thompson Organisation, then one of the largest media owners in the UK, but after three years wanted to work in a smaller business where one’s contribution could be more crucial to business success. So, he moved to the agency side running the media team at Harris Research, and realised that agency life was for him.\n\nSix years on came a move to RSGB, where he became MD, and was later promoted to run all AGB’s non-continuous research interests. This came to a sad end when Robert Maxwell bought AGB, and Nigel felt he could no longer work for a bully and, as it transpired, a thief.\n\nAt this point he became a shareholder in, and MD of BJM, but within the first year he had to share this role with a key involvement in the campaign to reclaim AGB’s pension funds which Maxwell had purloined. Eventually this worked out well, as did BJM which was sold to a US firm, NFO some years later. In turn NFO sold the company to TNS at which point Nigel took a step back from the top level and worked part time until 2009 when he retired.\n\nDuring his career Nigel was Chair of AMSO, the large research companies’ trade association, and was Hon Sec/ Treasurer of the MRS. Since retirement he has been a non-executive Director of Network Research, now Motif, and enjoyed a spell as Chair of the Research Network.\n\nNigel Spackman\n\nInterview date: 21st November 2019\n\nInterviewed at home in London, by Graham Woodham\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice: Hamish Brown, Mountain Walks\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nSarah Taylor\n\nSarah’s career spans 30+ years global Operations experience delivering multi-stage, multi-market research projects across a wide range of sectors and includes 20 years at (Added Value) Kantar as well as smaller boutique qualitative agencies.\n\nHer early career was with Adsearch, Pegram Walters Associates (PWA) and The Qualitative Consultancy (TQC) from 1995 to 1999.\n\nShe joined Added Value early in 2000 and set up an in-house Field Operation. Added Value was acquired by WPP in 2003 and quickly expanded. Sarah was appointed European Field Manager and in 2009 Global Field & Operations Director. In 2017 Added Value became part of Consulting by Kantar.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019 she executed a GDPR & Data Privacy program across Kantar’s Consulting Division globally, working closely with the in-house legal team.\n\nIn 2019 Sarah established her own business providing operational and data protection support for clients. She now works with a number of clients mainly SME’s, across a range of sectors and acts as a data protection consultant for a Surrey-based law firm.\n\nShe’s a certified member of the UK Market Research Society and a member of the IAPP (International Association of Privacy Professionals). Sarah is experienced in ISO 27001 certification.\n\nDuring her time at TQC Sarah worked with Linda Henshall as part of an MRS Field Committee championing Operations in the MR Industry.\n\nSarah Taylor\n\nInterview date: 7th July 2023\n\nInterviewed at home in Walton-on-Thames by Judith Wardle\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice: The Boy, The Mole, Fox and the Horse by Charlie Mackesy\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nPhyllis Vangelder\n\nPhyllis Vangelder was an Editor in the market research industry for several decades and was in charge of publications at the MRS for over 25 years.\n\nIt was very difficult for English Literature graduates to find a job outside teaching when she came down, and like many others in her generation she ‘fell into market research’, joining Genatosen in a newly established two-handed market research department, where everything – sampling, interviewing and writing reports was done by the two members of the department. As the Head of the Department had been trained by Hedley’s (Procter and Gamble) this was quite a rigorous introduction to market research. There followed highly interesting jobs with the IPA (Assistant Research Officer and Information Officer) and Greenlys Advertising (Research Information Officer). Stints of abstracting, writing, qualitative and industrial research interviewing etc while her children were young, led to the position of Publications Officer at the Market Research Society. (Someone once referred to this as ‘a square peg in a square hole’).\n\nShe co-edited, (with Robin Birn and Paul Hague), A Handbook of Market Research Techniques and (with Colin McDonald) ESOMAR Handbook of Market and Opinion Research.\n\nShe has been active in the Archive of Market and Social Research (AMSR) since its inception, in particular editing its Newsletter, as well as the first book in the Showcasing the Archive series Post-War Developments in Market Research. She is co-editing, with Judith Staig, the third book in the series, Researching the Public: policy, politics and polling. She says, “The joy of the Archive is not only being involved in such an interesting and worthwhile project but working with the same people – particularly the ‘Brighton crowd’ – who made the market industry such a great environment in which to work”.\n\nPhyllis Vangelder\n\nInterview date: 15th July 2021\n\nInterviewed at home in Harrow, by Judith Wardle\n\nEditor: Paddy Costigan\n\nBook choice: Phyllis loves books and is widely read – she couldn’t choose just one book!\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants\n\nSir Robert Worcester\n\nSir Robert Worcester grew up in Kansas City. He is a graduate of Kansas University and is now an Adjunct Professor. After McKinsey & Company he became Chief Financial Officer at Opinion Research Corporation (ORC), coming to the UK in 1969 to set up Market & Opinion Research International (MORI), a joint venture of ORC and NOP (National Opinion Polls).\n\nIn 1973, Bob Worcester bought out ORC and MORI became an independent UK company, with NOP holding a minority share. In 2005 MORI joined with the French research company, Ipsos, to form Ipsos-MORI.\n\nCorporate image research was very much the area of research expertise that Bob embodied, with major ongoing studies into corporate reputations both in the UK and internationally.\n\nBob’s expertise in the area of political polling is well known, starting with Harold Wilson’s private polling in 1970. In 1975 Bob carried out the research on the EEC Referendum on behalf of the Government; MORI’s final poll results, 67% “in”/33% “out”, exactly the outcome.\n\nIn 2005 Bob stood down as Chairman of MORI; Bob continues to work part time at Ipsos-MORI, serves as a Patron of the Market Research Society, and has held visiting professorships at the London School of Economics and Political Science, (LSE), King’s College London (KCL), University of Strathclyde and City University.\n\nApart from many other activities, both academic and non-academic, Sir Robert Worcester chaired the Magna Carta 2015 800th Anniversary Commemoration Committee, served as President of the Institute for Business Ethics, and is Patron of several organisations, holds President and Vice Presidency appointments of companies and charities and currently is Chairman of two privately held companies.\n\nSir Robert Worcester\n\nInterview date: 6th February 2015\n\nInterviewed at home in London, by Lawrence Bailey\n\nEditor: Lawrence Bailey\n\nBook choice: ‘Magna Carta: A Very Short Introduction’ (2012), by Nicholas Vincent\n\nBack up to the list of Oral History participants"
