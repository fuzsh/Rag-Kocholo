        "text": "This page intentionally left blank\n\nWarfare State\n\nThis book challenges the central theme of the existing histories of twentieth-century Britain, that the British state was a welfare state. It argues that it was also a warfare state, which supported a powerful armaments industry. This insight implies major revisions to our understanding of twentieth-century British history, from appeasement to wartime industrial and economic policy, and the place of science and technology in government. David Edgerton also shows how British intellectuals came to think of the state in terms of welfare and decline, and includes a devastating analysis of C. P. Snow’s ‘two cultures’. This groundbreaking book offers a new, post-welfarist and post-declinist, account of Britain, and an original analysis of the relations of science, technology, industry and the military. It will be essential reading for those working on the history and historiography of twentieth-century Britain, the historical sociology of war and the history of science and technology.

The implications of that insight have taken a long time to work through. It has led me, for example, to reconsider the seminal work of both my supervisor, Gary Werskey, and my external examiner, Keith Middlemas. I have also had the privilege of being attacked, supported and otherwise engaged with by a number of scholars, who have seen the point of my insistence on the warfare state, even if they did not like it. At a seminar nearly fifteen years ago Charles Webster, the historian of the National Health Service, noted the damage my account did to the standard labourist historiographies; Bill Barnett responded as vigorously as one would expect to my criticisms and we have had many pleasurable encounters since. Among the economic historians and economists I am particularly indebted to Martin Daunton, Leslie Hannah, Kirsty Hughes, Frankie Lynch, Alan Milward, Deirdre McCloskey, George Peden, Jim Tomlinson and Jonathan Zeitlin. The military historians, John Ferris, David French, Sir Michael Howard, Paul Kennedy and Hew Strachan, have been kind enough to give me the confidence to stray into military history a little. Among the political scientists I am particularly grateful to David Coates, Paul Heywood, Simon Lee and Brendan O’Leary, and among the historians of science, technology and medicine to Roger Cooter, Paul Forman, John Krige, Eduardo Ortiz, Dominique Pestre, John Pickstone and Steve Sturdy. I have had the pleasure of presenting papers associated with this book in many different departments: Security Studies at Yale; Government in Manchester, the PIPES international relations seminar at Chicago, Politics in Nottingham, Economic History in Bristol, Cambridge and Paris; the Business History Unit at the London School of Economics; a number of summer schools in British contemporary history organised by the Institute of Contemporary British History; the Socialist History Society, the European University Institute, seven different seminars at the Institute of Historical Research in London, and history of science and xi\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgements\n\ntechnology seminars at seminars at Manchester, Cambridge, Oxford, Cornell, the Smithsonian Institution, Centre d’Histoire des Sciences et des Techniques, La Villette, in Paris, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Harvard.

Gillian Sutherland’s invitation to give a paper at a conference on the history of women in higher education led me to notice the masculinisation of British science around the Second World War. Philip Gummett and Robert Bud’s invitation to speak at a conference on the history of defence research laboratories stimulated my thinking on scientific civil servants. I am grateful too to organisers of conferences on a wide range of subjects, from the history of public ownership to the history of science in the twentieth century, which stimulated my thinking on many broader issues, among them Helen Mercer, Jim Tomlinson and Neil Rollings, Kirsty Hughes, Robert Millward and John Singleton, Paul Forman and Jose´ Manuel Sa´nchez-Ron, and John Krige and Dominique Pestre. I am particularly grateful to Dominique Pestre and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris for the opportunity to present four seminars based on this book.

In the first decades of the century this state created and commanded a military-industrial-scientific complex which was, in the phrase of the time, ‘second to none’. For some decades after the Second World War it held a sharply differentiated third place in a bipolar world. It was the pioneer of modern, technologically focused warfare; its naval and air forces long led the world. It was for a very long time the leading exporter of arms. It had a state machine operated not just by bureaucrats but also by technicians. It had intimate links with business, and indeed it successfully intervened in the economy, transforming its industrial structure. It saw itself as a global, liberal power, as a world political-economic policeman, an arbiter of the fate of nations. Those familiar with histories of international relations, twentiethcentury warfare and twentieth-century states will, or should, find it hard to believe that that state was the British state. For the standard histories of the great powers and the relations between them associate modern military power first with Germany and then with the United States. Britain is the ‘weary titan’, an effete declining power, which disarmed in the interwar years and then appeased a resurgent Germany. This supposed failure to be warlike enough in the past still has enormous ideological resonance. In Britain the claim is made, to this day, as the last argument in favour of high armaments expenditure and interventions abroad; this warning from history has been deployed before every postwar conflict from the invasion of Suez in 1956 to that of Iraq in 2003. This image of Britain was also important in post-war United States politics, and indeed in US academic writing on the history of relations between nations.1 It is not surprising then that in accounts of the twentieth-century state the British state appears, if at all, as one which became a Keynesian-welfare state which was singularly unsuccessful in 1\n\nKevin Narizny, ‘The political economy of alignment: Great Britain’s commitments to Europe, 1905–1939’, International Security 27 (2003), 184–219.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nWarfare State\n\ntransforming the economy. In this alternative account there is a British warfare state of some importance to both world history and British history. For those familiar with the historiography of twentieth-century Britain, and the British state, as it stood even a decade ago, the arguments presented here will seem particularly odd. Indeed their very oddity is a measure of the significance of putting the warfare state into the history of twentieth-century Britain. Most histories saw Britain as a ‘welfare state’, an assumption to be found in nearly all economic histories, social histories, labour histories and even the most recent cultural histories. Most histories of British armed force relied on the idea that as a liberal nation Britain was anti-militaristic. Accounts of science, technology and industry associated with its armed forces were saturated with the powerful declinist assumptions of so much Anglo-American writing on the history of the British elite, and of the British economy, industry, science and technology. Those assumptions have been challenged for some time, by many historians, but do retain a good deal of influence. This book builds on and expands the scope and depth of the arguments presented in my England and the aeroplane and associated papers on Britain’s ‘liberal militarism’ and the technocratic and militaristic critiques of twentieth-century Britain.2 I have taken the argument in new and more radical directions than I could put forward a decade ago, partly in response to reactions to the earlier work.3 The empirical and conceptual bases of the argument are also much wider and deeper. The book covers the period 1920 to 1970, and discusses three main areas. First, it deals with the arms industry and state policies and practices in relation to this industry, and the economy more generally.

Chapter 6 looks at the declining warfare state of the late 1950s and 1960s, and in particular its relationship to the ‘white heat’ of the 1960s, and to the Ministry of Technology in particular.6 Secondly, the book is concerned with the nature of the British state elite and in particular the higher reaches of the civil service. In chs. 3 and 4 a new account is provided of the civil service and of science–state relations in both peace and war. The administrators and scientific officers are compared, and the supposed conflict between them is re-examined; the first reasonably complete picture of the controllers of armament production is given, showing the continued importance in war of technical civil servants, businessmen (particularly from the arms industry) and servicemen. Chapter 4 also links the history of the expansion of the largely military scientific civil service to the history of the technical middle class and the masculinisation and scientisation of the university in mid-century. The third element of the book is a study of interpretations and conceptualisations of the British state, and of British militarism and technocracy. Chapter 5 looks at the emergence in the late 1950s and 1960s of new technocratic ideologies which were and are central to ‘declinism’. Taking C. P. Snow and the physicist P. M. S. Blackett as exemplary and influential figures, it shows how they wrote expertise out of their accounts of the British state and British warfare; how they created an influential antihistory of British technocracy, especially in relation to war. The chapter also sheds new light on the seminal 1960s’ debate between Perry 4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nThe account differs significantly from some of the most recent highly specialised work on these topics.

P. Thompson, showing how Anderson reproduced standard technocratic declinist analyses while Thompson already showed an anti-declinist streak, and was expressing a concern that the British military-industrial complex was ignored by declinist analysts such as Anderson. Chapter 7 looks at how intellectuals (including particularly political economists and historians) dealt with the key issue of the relationship of Britain to militarism, and how the welfare state, rather than the welfare and warfare states, became central to the historiography of modern Britain. It does so by examining how a standard image of Germany shifted from being a means to celebrate Britishness to a critique of Britishness, and how a militaristic critique of Britain became central to understanding Britain’s relationship to the armed services. It also looks at how social democratic historians linked war to the rise of the welfare state and made this the central theme of the historiography of twentieth-century Britain. It also examines the return, from the late 1970s, of the techno-declinism that had been so important a part of British culture in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Chapter 8 examines how the existing literature on industry, technology and science in modern war (including the important literature focused on the USA) systematically takes out the military and/or treats it in very specific ways. It proposes a new framework for thinking about the relations between science, technology, industry and war in the twentieth century.7 It explores what is called historiography from below as, among other things, a means of understanding the crucial hidden assumptions made in the existing academic and non-academic literatures on these topics. Putting the British warfare state into the twentieth-century history of Britain is to rewrite some of the most important passages of its political, military, economic and cultural history. The revisions to standard accounts are at least as great as those brought about by highlighting the ‘fiscal-military state’ of the eighteenth century.8 Many of the most\n\n7\n\n8\n\nThis chapter has some material which first appeared in David Edgerton, ‘British scientific intellectuals and the relations of science, technology and war’ in Paul Forman and J.

For example, rather than ‘disarming’ in the interwar years Britain kept arms spending high and focused on the most modern military technologies. Rather than leading to ‘appeasement’, liberal internationalism, which had a strong political-economic core, was not only anti-Nazi but militantly so. The development of the welfare state around the Second World War changed the structure of the central state much less than the quickly expanding warfare state. The already strong warfare state had expanded its scope and power, militarising and nationalising Britain. From the mid-1930s to the late 1940s warlike spending went up much more than welfare spending, and the ‘welfareness’ of British state spending did not return to early 1930s levels until 1970. The pre-war state was expert and the post-war state was even more expert, despite the image of dominance by nonexpert administrators. C. P. Snow’s notion of the ‘two cultures’, so influential in understanding the British elite, including the state elite, was garbled and wrong-headed, but for all that typical, technocratic, declinist, anti-history of Britain. The 1964–70 Labour government, far from trying, and failing, to inject technocracy into the British ancien re´gime, instead cut back on techno-nationalist projects and ceased to believe that Britain suffered from a lack of innovation. A great modernisation project brought into being alongside the creation of declinism provided the context in which key theses of declinism were refuted. The last decade and a half has seen the beginnings of a transformation in the study of twentieth-century Britain. Breaking away from ‘inverted Whiggism’ and ‘declinist’ accounts, and the ‘decline debate’ more generally, has been of central importance in rethinking the broad contours of twentieth-century British history.9 For declinism was never confined to economic history, nor was it just an interpretative framework: it painted very particular pictures of Britain, its elite, its businesses, its armed forces, its culture, which have proved very influential.10 Not surprisingly, antideclinism has gone along with a powerful sense of the historical stories\n\n9\n\n10\n\nfiscal-sociology of British defence policy 1870–1913’, Journal of European Economic History 22 (1993), 461–506; Niall Ferguson, ‘Public finance and national security: the domestic origins of the First World War revisited’, Past and Present no. 142 (1994), 141–68 and The pity of war (London: Allen Lane, 1998); Nicolas Lambert, Sir John Fisher’s naval revolution (Columbia, SC: South Carolina University Press, 1999).

McCloskey, ‘The politics of stories in historical economics’ in If you’re so smart (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1990), pp. 40–55; Edgerton ‘The prophet militant and industrial’; W. D. Rubinstein, Capitalism, culture and economic decline in Britain,\n\n6\n\nWarfare State\n\nabout twentieth-century Britain being seriously inadequate. One historian observes that there is a sort of history of Britain which ‘explains an outcome which never happened . . . by a cause that is equally imagined’.11 He only half-jokingly suggested that in reading comparative business histories a helpful rule of thumb is to assume that (at least after World War I) what they say about Germany applies to the United Kingdom, that what they say about the United Kingdom applies to Italy; and that neither can be assumed to have anything whatsoever to do with competitive advantage or economic performance.12\n\nAnother historian notes in a review of literature on the Royal Air Force (RAF) that some recent works ‘begin by invoking causes which do not exist, continue with arguments based on imagination instead of evidence, and end by describing events which did not happen’.13 Another asked whether the opposite to what is stated in much literature on British science and technology might be closer to an adequate historical picture than that put forward.14 It is little wonder then that a recent textbook on British economic history is animated by a ‘mood of growing disenchantment with the level of debate’.15 Welfarism has been at least as important as declinism, probably more so, in shaping the historiography of twentieth-century Britain. It remains central to the understanding of the British state, at least after 1914. Yet here too great changes are under way in understanding the place of the military in the state, and in society more generally. A key indicator is that the term ‘militarism’ is now being used by British historians in studies of twentieth-century Britain. For example a military historian writes that if militarism is ‘interpreted as a veneration of military values and\n\n11 12 13 14 15\n\n1750–1990 (London: Routledge, 1993); Barry Supple, ‘Fear of failing: economic history and the decline of Britain’, Economic History Review 47 (1994), 441–58; Jim Tomlinson, ‘Inventing ‘‘decline’’: the falling behind of the British economy in the post-war years’, Economic History Review 49 (1996), 731–57, and The politics of decline (London: Arnold, 2000); P.

It also seeks to understand it, and indeed its close relationship with declinism. The book looks at the history of the warfare/welfare and the decline/growth dichotomies and other binary oppositions which have been central in understanding the British state. Among them are the opposition between the military and the civilian, which turns out to be hugely important to our understanding of industry, science, technology and war in the twentieth century; that between liberalism and militarism, which is central to the understanding of British militarism; that between ‘specialists’ and ‘generalists’ or ‘amateurs’ and ‘professionals’ in the civil service, the core issue in its historiography; and the overarching ‘two cultures’ opposition between science and arts, a dichotomy central to the study of the intellectual elite and much else besides. This book shows how these particular oppositions emerged from particular understandings of Britain and the British state and were forged in particular contests about reforming the state. More generally this is an invitation to see how important particular critiques of the state have been in its formation and understanding. British intellectuals, and politicians, have thought of the state in very distinctive ways, using distinctive language – that of political economy, welfare and technocratic and militaristic critiques among others. Particular social-scientific understandings were also, I show, crucial to forming the contemporary understanding of the state, and historians’ understandings too, in ways which we need to appreciate more. We need to recognise the structures of analysis embodied in concepts like the welfare state, Keynesianism and nationalisation, all standard terms in analyses of the development of the twentieth-century state. The history of the state, the book argues, has been understood in very particular ways, focusing on one side of each of the dichotomies. In many accounts the British state is all welfare, administrators, civilians, arts graduates, Keynesianism and nationalisation. The overall argument of this book is not that the state should be seen as all warfare, specialists, military men, scientists and engineers and technocratic intervention, that it was a warfare state rather than a welfare state or a nation becoming more powerful rather than declining. The book does not invert the usual dichotomies, it subverts them. It tells a different story about the state and about the conceptualisation of the state than those that can be told from within the standard conceptualisations. The post-declinist and 16\n\nHew Strachan, The politics of the British army (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997), pp. 264–5.\n\n8\n\nWarfare State\n\npost-welfarist historiography it calls for will not come from ignoring declinism or welfarism, or writing histories that merely challenge such accounts, which we might call anti-welfarist and anti-declinist histories. On the contrary, it must understand the significance of welfarism and declinism to the history and the historiography of twentieth-century Britain. In arguing for a new history of the British state the book will have fully succeeded only if it succeeds in this second task as well. Indeed, I hope the book will help open up the history of welfare and of relative economic decline to new questions, as much as the history of the warfare state and of British economic development. My argument thus does not rest on existing historiography or on a critique of existing historiography but rather on a series of crucially important re-understandings of our accounts of the British state, and the histories of twentieth-century science, technology, industry and war. For this reason it cannot deal with existing literature in the conventional way. Academic historians usually fill lacunae in the literature; we revisit (empirically and/or theoretically) well-established debates, challenge well-developed authoritative original positions, claiming original contributions, and/or synthesise specialist literatures. We also contextualise particular cases within wider existing historiographies. None of these strategies has been usable in this case. The problem is not a lack of writing on the themes covered here but the particular ways in which we know what we know.17 What this book is arguing against and across, what it stands instead of, is by the very nature of the project not easily – or profitably – discussible in terms of existing accounts. For example, declinism and welfarism interacted in very particular and complex ways with seemingly neutral specialised accounts of, say, the civil service or the armed forces or the universities. These specialised histories are already contextualised within particular histories of Britain. It is difficult to untangle one from another, and thus the crucially important reconfigurations of arguments at many levels which putting the warfare state in involves are not easily described. I deliberately do not set out to attack a 17\n\nThe usual academic response to a situation in which there was no great academic tradition would be that we should start from scratch – it is not beyond the capacity of academics to convince ourselves, and others, that we know less than we really do, thereby increasing the stock of collective ignorance. It would be going too far to engage only with the private knowledge of the informed, though the public can be more challenging to argue with than the academy. This was brought home to me by discovering that things I have written against particular academic positions caused no surprise to lay people; for those working in the aircraft industry it was too obvious for comment that the industry was essentially military; for those like me who read about it, this was a surprise. It would be amusing to tally the claims to ignorance now exaggeratedly made in the academic literature of the ‘surprisingly little is known about’ kind.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nparticular historical literature. Instead I write about a wide range of historical and non-historical literatures, from many different periods, as part of a wider story about the state and how it was understood. One aim is to demonstrate the pervasiveness of (and changes in) the understandings I am criticising as partial accounts. I want to avoid any suggestion that I am attacking straw men, or outdated conceptions, or particular recent ones, or that I am engaged in a debate on decline. I also want to avoid the danger that in convincing readers of the significance of the warfare state, I undermine the idea that the welfare state was indeed central to the conceptualisation of the British state. The aim is to understand how and why welfarism and declinism became so significant, and how and why the warfare state has not registered in the elite British imagination. Part of the way this is done is by exploring the intellectual traffic between practitioners and specialist historians, by studying the assumptions of specialist historians, by examining, historically, the thinking of practitioners. The British warfare state has been surrounded by near impregnable thickets of historical accounts and other accounts which camouflage it. A title/keyword search on militarism in any large library catalogue will show that there is a substantial literature on German, Japanese, Soviet and many ‘third world’ species of militarism, but virtually none associating the concept with Britain. Furthermore, in all the vast commentary on the British state, there is hardly even an allusion to the ‘military-industrial complex’ or the ‘military-scientific complex’, ideas which are central to the discussion of militarism in the United States. In post-war Britain both the left and right, for different reasons, were to complain of the weakness of the state. In Britain, it seems, there was apparently no close engagement with industry and the state, or interpenetration of state and science. Admitting the existence of a modern and modernising warfare state, in peace or war, would have entailed profound changes in the analysis of the state, and of the place of expertise, science and technology in the life of the state and the nation. It would have discomfited the post-war right, which complained of a lack of militarism, particularly but not only in the interwar years, to keep arms spending up. But it would also upset the arguments of the left which asserted that the state was incapable of modernising intervention and that it was hostile to expertise. Indeed a catalogue search would suggest not only that Britain has had no militarism but no technocrats either. A large literature supports the idea that this has been a central problem for British economic and military performance.18 British 18\n\nAndrew Massey, Technocrats and nuclear policy: the influence of professional experts in policymaking (Aldershot: Avesbury, 1988), is the only book on Britain I know which uses the term in a title.\n\n10\n\nWarfare State\n\ntechnocrats, of left and right, consistently complained of the supposed antiscientific and anti-technological character of the British state and industry and sought to advance their positions through such critiques. Particularly long-standing and influential has been the technocratic critique of the higher civil service, which is seen as being made up of men trained in the classics and at best, history, rather than the scientists and engineers that a modern society was felt to need as state administrators. The militaristic and technocratic critiques of twentieth-century Britain have proved very influential, particularly but not only in declinist writing.19 They were often themselves historical in the sense of drawing on past cases, but they were often anti-histories in that, paradoxically, they removed the military or technocratic from British history. Instead, they often provided elaborate historical explanations for what they took to be a weak commitment to the armed forces and to science and technology. I turn these critiques around in a very particular way. I take the very ubiquity in the post-war years of the claim that Britain was an antimilitarist and anti-technological society (which I demonstrate) as evidence not of the theory put forward, but of the success (and power of) the militaristic and technocratic strands in British culture. Such a move implies a very different account of British cultural and intellectual history, for this too is dominated by assumptions linked to declinism and welfarism. Much discussion of ‘Englishness’ or the ‘English ideology’ has long been a site for the reproduction of declinist theses, rather than a re-examination of ‘Englishness’ and how it has changed.20 Furthermore, it is focused on humanistic/literary intellectuals, just like the technocratic critique.21 It is thus hardly surprising 19 20\n\n21\n\nEdgerton, ‘The prophet militant and industrial’. For examples see Patrick Wright, On living in an old country: the national past in contemporary Britain (London: Verso, 1985); Tom Nairn, The enchanted glass (London: Radius, 1988); Angus Calder, The myth of the Blitz (London: Cape, 1991); David Morgan and Mary Evans, The battle for Britain: citizenship and ideology in the Second World War (London: Routledge, 1993); Meredith Veldman, Fantasy, the bomb, and the greening of Britain: romantic protest, 1945–1980 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994); and many chapters in A. K. Mayer and C. J. Lawrence (eds.), Regenerating England: science, medicine and culture in interwar Britain (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2000). For an argument making explicit the connection between declinism and the question of national identity see R. English and Michael Kenny, ‘British decline or the politics of declinism?’, British Journal of Politics and International Relations 1 (1999), 252–66, and ‘Public intellectuals and the question of British decline’, British Journal of Politics and International Relations 3 (2001), 259–83. Studies of scientific and technical intellectuals are rare. Among the exceptions are Bill Luckin, Questions of power (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1990), my own England and the aeroplane; Patrick Wright, The village that died for England: the strange case of Tyneham (London: Cape, 1995) and his Tank: the progress of a monstrous war machine (London: Faber, 2000) and Mayer and Lawrence, Regenerating England.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nthat it is only recently that the significance of declinism on British cultural history and cultural historians has been appreciated.22 Welfarism too remains central to cultural and intellectual history. Even the newer literature focused on ‘national identity’, centrally concerned with gender, race, empire and nation, is best seen as a rereading of the conventional welfarist accounts rather than as a challenge to them.23 Post-declinist and post-welfarist cultural histories will incorporate political economy, militarism and technocracy and, of course, declinism itself, in their accounts, rather than being carriers of their implicit assumptions. Long ago E. P. Thompson argued for the centrality of political economy and science to English ideology.24 It was a vital element in Britain’s self-understanding, and in particular, it turns out, Britain’s understanding of militarism and of how to wage war. Political economy was, I show, the language of preference for the critical discussion of international relations, war, militarism and the state in Britain in the interwar years and beyond, as well as, and more obviously, economic performance. Scientists, engineers and their propagandists also derived much of their language and imagery from political economy: science and political economy both saw war in civilian terms for example. It is also vital to understand the significance of critiques of liberal political economy for our conceptualisation of the British state and British liberalism. For welfarism, declinism and the militaristic and technocratic critiques are all critiques of a particular liberal political-economic conception of the state. All correlated well with economic nationalism, hostility to laissezfaire, and celebration of the continental European (and particularly the German) way of doing things.25 The militaristic critique saw liberalism as a pacific, even pacifist, doctrine, which was associated with vacuous moralising and a flawed analysis of the real world. Britain, as a liberal nation in this sense, was seen as being reluctant to invest in armed force 22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nSee Marcus Collins, ‘The fall of the English gentleman: the national character in decline, c. 1918–1970’, Historical Research 75 (2002), 90–111, for a splendid account of how declinism did for the gentleman. See, for example, Richard Weight and Abigail Beach (eds.), The right to belong: citizenship and national identity in Britain (London: I. B. Tauris, 1998); Kevin Davey, English imaginaries: studies in Anglo-British modernity (London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1999); Richard Weight, Patriots: national identity in Britain, 1940–2000 (London: Macmillan, 2002); Robert Colls, Identity of England (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). E. P. Thompson, ‘The peculiarities of the English’ (1965), reprinted in The poverty of theory (London: Merlin, 1978), p. 57. The other two points were that Anderson and Nairn, the butts of this analysis, ignored the Protestant and bourgeois democratic inheritance and confused the British empirical idiom with an empiricist ideology. See Peter Clarke and Clive Trebilcock (eds.), Understanding decline (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1997) and my review in The Historical Journal 42 (1999), 313–14.\n\n12\n\nWarfare State\n\nand especially armies; governments, backed by liberal public opinion, kept the forces on short rations through the power of the ultra-liberal Treasury. In this account only war broke the complacent consensus – mass armies were sent to Europe in two world wars. In other words Britain became European. The technocratic critique saw the elite as amateur and old fashioned, as financial and commercial, committed to laissez-faire, which all had disastrous consequences for economic and military performance. Again, only in war did the genuinely creative new men rise temporarily from despised marginality to centrality: war was as crucial for the technocrats as for the militarists. The welfarist, social democratic accounts focusing on the welfare state were also profoundly critical of liberal Britain for its lack of commitment to welfare and a strong state: they also saw war as providing the opportunity for labour to create, or have created for it, a welfare state. More than that, success in modern war was a matter of creating a welfare state which could mobilise the citizenry. The standard post-war view was that the elite remained too economically liberal, to a lesser extent too pacifist, too committed to a weak state, and that only welfarism became newly significant. Of course, it also supposedly remained hostile to European integration. We need to appreciate, I suggest, the dramatic but largely unrecognised change in Britain between the interwar and post-war periods. For all the insistence on the importance of the war as a turning point, it is not sufficiently recognised that Britain was no longer as liberal – economically, politically, intellectually – as many supposed it remained. Britain changed radically, in many more ways than are captured by ideas of the rise of the welfare state or social democracy. Welfarism was crucially important, but so were technocracy, militarism and declinism, though these are invisible to themselves (another reason why the term anti-history is useful in relation to them). One major difficulty in thinking about the military-industrial-scientific complex in the British case has been that the relations between modernity and militarism have been understood in very particular ways. Although it is now a commonplace to put the state and the military back into history, for example in the new historical sociologies that have followed Theda Skocpol’s pioneering work, the history of science, technology and industry, even in relation to the military, continues to be treated differently.26 26\n\nSee the key work: Theda Skocpol, States and social revolutions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979). On expertise see Theda Skocpol and Kenneth Finegold, ‘State capacity, economic intervention and the early New Deal’, Political Science Quarterly 97 (1982), 255–78, and for a rare questioning of the usual stories about technology in historical sociology, Randall Collins, Weberian sociological theory (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986).\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nScience, technology and industry have routinely and systematically been seen, without need of argument or evidence, as products of civil society. In the standard arguments this civilian industry, science, technology has transformed modern war. This was the dominant view of political economists, scientific intellectuals and some military intellectuals too, from say Norman Angell to C. P. Snow and on to Mary Kaldor, and it has become enshrined in the work of historians, most eloquently perhaps in William H. McNeill’s The pursuit of power.27 As a result we have a historiography of war economies in which the military and military agencies hardly figure; histories of science and technology and the military, which are histories only of civilian science and technology applied to war; and histories of the relations of industry, technology, science and war which see the transformation of war in the twentieth century as the civilianisation of war. ‘Civilian’ and ‘liberal’ are very useful modifiers to describe modern ‘militarism’, but we need to take care not to identify modern science, technology and industry only with the modifiers.28 This book suggests that we have had a very particular and very partial account of modern warfare which has systematically downplayed, without this being evident, the role of the military, and it puts the history of war and the military into the history of industry, science and technology in new ways. Militarism has been scientifically, technically and industrially creative in ways we have barely begun to understand. Specifically military/state sciences and technologies and industries have been crucial for the development of twentieth-century science and technology and also warfare. They tend to be left out of the history of twentieth-century science, which focuses on academic particle physics and biology. The state, specifically its military branches, will appear here as one of the creators of a new research-oriented science, and modern armed forces, long before the Second World War, and not as a late, reluctant, respondent to a new scientific revolution. My account also stresses the need to distinguish between science or technology, on the one hand, and ‘research’ on the other, and indeed to distinguish between the advisory and other roles scientists and engineers have played. This latter distinction is central to overturning the standard stories of science at war. In my account important state and industrial military laboratories, design centres and\n\n27 28\n\nOxford: Blackwell, 1982.

I shift, and show the significance of so doing, from what I show is the existing unacknowledged emphasis on the work of (some) civilian academic scientists to the history of military research and development in peace and war. More generally I argue that histories of science and technology must take on the full scope of the twentieth-century scientific and technical enterprises, and not merely parts of them.29 This book also re-examines more generally the relations between national innovative capacity and both military and economic power. First, it gives a rather different account of national innovative capacities than the usual overly academic-centred ones, by taking full account of industry and the military. Secondly, it rejects, and shows the importance of so doing, the deeply rooted assumption that national rates of economic growth correlate positively with national investments in innovation, for Britain, or for any other country. This key assumption of techno-nationalism, which is also central to most global accounts of the place of science and technology in economic growth, does not hold.\n\n29\n\n‘De l’innovation aux usages.

In the 1960s the social democratic historian A. J. P. Taylor accepted that in the very early 1930s the National government was ‘almost as reluctant to spend money on armaments as on the unemployed’.3 In the 1970s the naval historian Paul Kennedy pronounced with assurance that ‘governmental concern to balance the budget by cutting down armaments expenditure’ had the distressing consequence that when the decision for rearmament was made in the more threatening circumstances of the 1930s, industry itself could not adequately respond . . . The productive capacity of the country as a whole, and those of specialized armament firms in particular, were too run-down to be reversed without major investment in factories and machine-tools.4\n\nIn the 1980s the military historian Brian Bond repeated a similar refrain: Britain demobilised her huge, conscript armies with remarkable speed after 1918 and at the same time largely dismantled her defence industries.

Donald Cameron Watt wrote of a near hopeless situation for Britain: During the 1920s her three services had barely existed on budgets cut to the bone. In 1931 and 1932 all kinds of normal current expenditure on her armed forces had been postponed . . . In 1933, for the third year running, the Chiefs of Staff warned that the level of Britain’s armed forces and their state of preparedness was not adequate to defend Britain or her overseas dominions and possessions against foreign attack.6\n\nExamples of such bleak assessments could easily be multiplied, despite the glaring fact that, as George Peden had pointed out in 1979, ‘one would be hard put to argue that Britain was in a worse position than Germany in 1932’.7 Or indeed, as we shall see, than any other power. Britain may not have spent enough according to historians writing with a very particular form of hindsight; but that is a very different proposition from claiming that it spent less than its competitors or allies. Specialist inquiries into each armed service and the arms industry have habitually presented detailed accounts and explanations to match the gloomy conclusions of the general accounts.8 For example, the official historian of factories and plant in the Second World War wrote of the interwar years that the ‘armament industry reached the verge of extinction’ and complained that there ‘was a general lack of foreign orders’ for 5 6 7 8\n\nBrian Bond, War and society in Europe, 1870–1970 (London: Fontana, 1984), p. 146.

The drastic reduction in the [war]shipbuilding industry – in 1914 it was building 111 warships, in 1924 only twenty-five – was the chief cause of the delays in the Admiralty’s rearmament schemes.11\n\nM. M. Postan’s official history, British war production, published in 1952, is a key source for a similar argument about the supposedly struggling interwar aircraft industry: the re-equipment of the 20s and early 30s was little more than nominal. In the early 1930s the bulk of the Air Force was still made up of types dating to the war of 1914–18. The types available for replacement, though more recent, were not only few in number, but as a rule were below the technical and operational standards of the day. As late as 1935 the principal ‘new’ fighter coming into service was the Gloster-Gauntlet with a speed of 230 mph and the ‘new’ bombers were the Hind and the Hendon . . . The general impression is that throughout these years the quality of RAF equipment was falling below the standards which in the early thirties were being established in foreign countries, such as Italy and the United States . . . the Air Ministry had great difficulty in maintaining its industrial reserves. The aircraft firms, including the principal engine firms, found themselves in a position of chronic penury and sometimes on the very verge of bankruptcy.\n\nThe ‘diet’ of orders, he went on, ‘though just sufficient to keep the bulk of the firms alive, was too meagre to enable them to keep pace with the aircraft industry abroad, especially in the United States, and to acquire the equipment and technique for quantity production’.12 This potent image of deficiency was reproduced again and again.13 As we shall see, nearly 9 10 11 13\n\nWhere this means armaments other than shipbuilding and aircraft: Hornby, Factories and plant, p. 25.

As is evident from the continuing prevalence of the analysis reported above, revisionist accounts have been slow in coming and patchy in impact. George Peden’s study of the Treasury and rearmament showed, crucially, that the Treasury did not hinder rearmament but helped direct it towards the build up of the air force and the navy rather than the army.14 For the 1920s, John Ferris has stressed the high level of defence spending, the strength of the Royal Navy and the RAF, and dismissed the hoary myth of the ten-year rule which, needless to say, still appears regularly. He suggested that British foreign and defence policy should be labelled ‘liberal realist’.15 Dick Richardson, in the first serious historical challenge to the myth of disarmament, has shown that in the late 1920s of Britain’s leaders only one, Viscount Cecil, believed in disarmament and the remainder were largely actively hostile: ‘the philosophical propensities of the Cabinet and the foreign policy making elite of the country were sceptical of, if not outrightly opposed to, the whole movement for arms limitation’.16 He concluded that the ‘allegation – supported\n\n14 15 16\n\nproduction in Britain’ (British air strategy between the wars (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), p. 247).

In 1940 Britain produced more aircraft than any country in the world, and 50 per cent more than the Germans. Malcolm Smith suggests that the strengths of the RAF and the Luftwaffe on 1 September 1939 were about equal in terms of numbers of bombers and interceptor fighters (Smith, British air strategy, table XI, p. 338). As far as quality is concerned the consensus is that the best on each side in 1939/40 were about equal, especially in the case of fighters; for bombers one study noted that the ‘He 111s, Do 17s and Ju 88s were marginally better than the Wellingtons, Hampdens and Whitleys of RAF Bomber Command’ (Matthew Cooper, The German air force, 1933–1945: an anatomy of failure (London: Jane’s, 1981), p. 87).

F. C. Fuller, by stressing the importance, indeed perhaps the exaggerated importance, of tanks to the interwar army.22 The standing and authority of these two key ‘military intellectuals’, who contributed so much to the image of technically deficient and backward interwar forces, have been drastically revised.23 In the case of the navy and the naval-industrial complex, the revisionist arguments have been much weaker (hence the\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20 21 22 23\n\nRichardson, British disarmament policy, p. 98.

Still, one historian writes that the peace movement did not ‘affect the Royal Navy in any measurable degree’24 while another has argued that no ‘doubt exists that the British Navy was the strongest in the world when the Second World War broke out in 1939’.25 Yet that is far from the image of a penurious, conservative navy one still gets from standard naval histories. The differences between the older accounts and some of the newer ones reported and to be developed on here are stark. How could historians come to such different conclusions? The answer is twofold. First, to make the still dominant case for weakness historians repeated very particular comparisons over time and across countries, made very particular definitions of armaments and selected very particular technical characteristics of weapons. For example Paul Kennedy, as cited above, implicitly wanted a navy kept at 1918 levels, with 1914 levels of shipbuilding, rather than one adjusted to a peacetime standard devised in comparison with other navies. Furthermore he elides defence expenditure as a whole and naval spending, though both changed differently and with different consequences from those suggested. He also makes strong, unwarranted, assumptions about the decline of the ‘nation’s industrial sinews’ and their relationship to warship building. For Postan the British aircraft industry is to be compared to the US industry in particular, and also the Italian – industries which seemed to encapsulate the state of the art in aviation. Oddly he did not use the most obvious comparators, Germany and France. As we will see as we explore the interwar arms industries, all sorts of definitional issues will come into play which centre on what constituted the arms industry, a topic we shall return to in ch. 8. There is also a deeper issue. Historians implicitly wanted more of everything: more battleships, more bombers, more soldiers, more tanks. They have tended not to ask questions about effectiveness and how this might affect such a historical judgement (for such historians are seeking to judge): even historians critical of battleships and bombers implicitly wanted more battleships and more bombers to have been built in the interwar years.26 Finally, there are very particular assessments being made about the nature of the British economy, and its place in the world, and the world\n\n24\n\n25 26\n\nKennedy, ‘Britain’s policy-making elite’, 644.

A new look at interwar armaments The Great War had demanded armaments on a vast scale, not simply because of the size of the forces deployed but because of the huge expenditure of munitions. So too would the Second World War. It is hardly surprising that in the 1920s and 1930s the production of armaments was, by comparison, at a trivial level. This variability in production, involving changes in output unparalleled in scale and rate in the civilian economy, suggests that the economists’ rule of thumb that one should compare peak to peak and trough to trough ought to apply with particular force. In a well-known book on public expenditure published in 1961, the economists Peacock and Wiseman produced an index for defence expenditure in the first half of the century corrected for price changes. Their figures suggested that interwar defence expenditure was significantly higher than in the 1890s, and only just below the figures for 1905 and 1910. Their figures also suggested stability in defence expenditure between 1924 and 1934.27 That expenditure was broadly at the same level just before the Great War, and from the early 1920s to the mid1930s is confirmed in figs. 1.1 and 1.2. For our purposes we need to go into a little more detail, and consider total expenditures and procurement expenditures by service. In the Edwardian years naval expenditure accounted for more than half of defence expenditure, but significantly less in the interwar period. The pre-war navy dominated procurement but its relative position became much weaker in the interwar years (table 1.1). In other words, the navy declined relative to the forces as a whole, and the naval-industrial complex declined faster relative to the arms industry as a whole. This is another way of saying that a new, procurement-intensive force, the RAF, was growing at the expense of the navy and the navalindustrial complex. Otherwise the naval procurement budget for new ships of the 1920s could have been doubled. Controlled comparisons with other countries are equally revelatory. Excepting the United States and Weimar Germany, the other Great Powers had more men under arms than Great Britain in the interwar years. However, defence expenditure gives a different picture.

In 1932 Britain, France and the USA were spending about the same in absolute terms, with Britain at the bottom of this list. The USSR, set on a course of forced industrialisation, was, on these figures, the largest spender. But by 1934 Germany was easily the largest spender, with France and Japan also showing substantial rises. The relative British position had slipped since the 1920s, but this was due to expenditure increases in other countries not British ‘cuts’.30 Some contemporaries would not have been in the least surprised by the picture of a well-funded military presented above. Political economists noted that interwar British warlike expenditure was high by historical\n\n28 29\n\n30\n\nJohn Ferris, ‘Treasury control: the ten year rule and British service policies, 1919–1924’, Historical Journal 30 (1987), 865.

For example, that great Liberal party plan of 1928, Britain’s industrial future (the Yellow Book) noted that: There is no automatic standard of reasonableness in the connection [arms expenditure]; but we may find comparatively firm ground if we regard our expenditure on defence as an insurance premium incurred to enable us to live our own lives in peace and consider what rate of premium we have paid for this privilege in the past. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century we were in no imminent danger of war . . . Our defence expenditure was £25 m – a premium of 2 per cent. In 1913 . . . the premium had jumped to 3½ percent. Today it is still 3 per cent, though we see no reason for regarding this country as in greater peril than in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.31\n\nIn 1934 F. W. Hirst, a former editor of The Economist, wrote that ‘Despite the unparalleled burdens of growing taxation, the British Government, like other Governments, though participating in a Disarmament Conference, is increasing or maintaining enormous armaments for land, sea and air.’32 Hirst, quoting from the main speech in favour of the Oxford Union’s scandalising 1933 resolution (that the house would not fight for King and Country) argued with irony that: The War, according to Mr. Lloyd George, was to make England ‘a land fit for heroes to live in’; but it had produced a mass of unemployment previously unknown. It had also been described as ‘a war to end war’, with the result that ‘we are now spending forty millions more than in 1913 in preparations for the next war’.33\n\nCorrection for inflation was not an immediate reflex, but it would have got rid of most of the increase Hirst mentioned. Yet allowing for price changes had different effects on analyses of defence expenditure changes in the interwar years. For, while prices inflated during and after the Great War, they deflated in the 1920s and early 1930s. Noting this, H. N. Brailsford, another veteran political economist concerned with war, observed in 1934 that Britain was spending more in real terms on defence in the early 1930s than it had been in the late 1920s.34 A 1937 Sheffield Peace Council pamphlet, comparing defence expenditures from the 1920s into the 1930s with the wholesale price index, noted that the ‘apparent decrease in expenditure between 1924–5 and 31\n\n32 33 34\n\nLiberal Industrial Enquiry, Britain’s industrial future (London: Ernest Benn, 1928) (known as the Yellow Book), p. 428.

A political-economic conception of warfare was influential not just in highlighting the raw level of defence expenditure, but the significance of the arms industry. There was much more criticism in this literature, and more generally, of the armaments industry than of Britain’s armed forces. Indeed the greatest campaign waged by the interwar peace movement was against the private arms industry and the international arms trade. The campaign succeeded in establishing a Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and Trading in Arms – it sat from 1935 into 1936 and generated a great deal of evidence on the industry.36 A leading campaigner, and another political economist, Philip Noel-Baker, followed up his own evidence with a book, The private manufacture of armaments, which, like most of the evidence, drew much of its material from the pre-war era, focused on the arms trade (in the sense of traffic), the degree of monopoly of arms firms, the links between these firms and the military through directorships and the international nature of the firms involved.37 The campaigners, like their pre-war predecessors, called for the nationalisation of the arms firms and the arms trade.38 There were definite limits to this activist agenda, particularly with respect to British arms firms. Although a good deal of telling detail can be gleaned on the contemporary British arms industry and arms lobbies, the campaigners did not produce an adequate overall description of the interwar British military-industrial complex on the world stage or in British politics.39 For example Noel-Baker’s account, easily the most serious, did little more than lament that the British Navy League and the Air League were consistent opponents of the League of Nations and 35\n\n36\n\n37 38 39\n\nSheffield and rearmament: an exposure of the ‘defence’ programme (Sheffield Peace Council, March 1937), p. 2.

Through the 1930s the party publicised the rising share prices of armourers, a movement which had started even before rearmament got under way;41 the coincidence of pro-Nazi and pro-rearmament sentiment, as in the cases of the Daily Mail and the Aeroplane;42 and the politics of the leadership of the service leagues.43 Critical analysis of the British arms industry, never especially strong, abruptly ended in the late 1930s and was not to revive until the 1970s.44 The strength of the British fleet Despite the laments of the historians, interwar Britain was without doubt a great naval power. The core of the Royal Navy, as of all the major interwar navies, was its fleet of battleships. These extraordinary things were, apart from the greatest of passenger liners, the largest ships afloat. Their engines – usually steam turbines fed by oil-fired boilers – were as powerful as many electric power stations: British battleships were driven by between 30 and 100 megawatts of power. The main guns could fire a broadside many times heavier than the bomb load of an interwar bomber, and do so again and again; the mountings could adjust the position of the gun with such accuracy that shells could hit targets many miles away; analogue computing devices (fire-control gear) allowed the shells fired from one moving ship to hit another moving ship; the armour plating could protect against repeated hits from shells weighing hundreds of kilogrammes. In the 1930s there were fewer than fifty of these leviathans in existence, and a majority were British or US. But this strength turned out to be largely irrelevant. Battleship– battleship encounters were very rare in the Second World War: indeed, only one British battleship was sunk by another battleship. HMS Hood was sunk in 1941 by the Bismarck, which was itself sunk by the combined action of 40 41\n\n42 43\n\n44\n\nPhilip Noel-Baker, The private manufacture of armaments (London: Gollancz, 1936), pp. 290–345.

This raises the interesting counterfactual point that Britain might have been better off had it not invested in battleships in the interwar years. As it happens the primary intention of the naval treaties so lambasted by historians for reducing British seapower was to reduce battleship numbers, types regarded as obsolete even by naval historians who bitterly complain about the treaties.45 Battleships were clearly not regarded as finished in the interwar years. But estimating their fighting power against other battleships, other ships and against aircraft was and is no easy task, and all navies were aware of this. We should therefore be wary of computations of battleship numbers, even of battleship qualities, so characteristic of the pre-1914 naval race. But playing the numbers game can be instructive, even without getting too deep into the complications. In 1935 the British navy had, as a result of multilateral disarmament, fifteen battleships to the USA’s fifteen and Japan’s ten. One Japanese ship, the Kongo, had been built by the British armourer Vickers. The Nelson and the Rodney, both British and both completed in 1927, were the newest in the world and the most modernlooking; they seem to disappear from our image of interwar British sea power. Emphasis is placed on the age of the remainder of the British fleet, though it was not in fact much older than other fleets.46 In any case, the age of a battleship was an unreliable guide to performance, both because British battleships of the Great War era were reckoned superior to others, certainly by the British47 who felt that their greater design skills gave British ships better overall fighting power.48 Just as importantly, battleships were often reconstructed. They were mobile fortifications of great power, which like land installations could have a very long life and be radically overhauled and remodelled. In 1939 each of these major fleets had the same battleships they had in 1935 but some had by then been radically changed. Every one of the fifteen British battleships of the 1930s had at least a large refit in the interwar years costing at least £240,000 (see fig. 1.3).49 Five 45 46\n\n47 48 49\n\nI owe this point to Robert O’Connell, Arms and men (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 272. Britain had one battleship completed between 1920 and 1925; the USA five and Japan two; from the war years Britain had eleven, the USA seven and Japan six; from the prewar period Britain had one, the USA three and Japan two.

Vindictive was completed as an aircraft carrier in 1918 but reconverted to a cruiser in 1923–4. There were more battleships in service before 1930. Sources: E. H. H. Archibald, The fighting ships of the Royal Navy, 1897–1984 (New York: Military Press, 1987) and work by Neilesh Patel based on Naval Estimates, and Ships’ Covers (National Maritime Museum).\n\nThe interwar military-industrial complex\n\n29\n\nbattleships had refits costing between £1 million and £1.5 million – Barham, Malaya, Royal Oak, Renown and Repulse. Four, Queen Elizabeth, Warspite, Valiant and Renown were ‘reconstructed’ in the mid-1930s on top of earlier large refits. They were given new engines, they had their gun-mountings modified to increase range and were given new fire-control gear – at total costs of £2–3 million each. These costs approached half what it would have cost to build a battleship from scratch. Japan reconstructed its eight 14-inchgunned battleships mainly in the mid-1930s. Their re-engining gave the Japanese ten ships matching the eight high-engine-power British ships. The refit/reconstruction effort in the United States appears to have been largely over by 1931. US navy battleships remained low powered by design.50 Where all navies were similar was in realising that new fire-control gear made greater ranges possible, and in many reconstructions gun elevations were extended, increasing ranges dramatically. Here the Royal Navy did fall behind the US and Japanese navies by the mid-1930s, but by the end of 1941 all three navies had a rough parity in ships with long-range guns.51 In 1939 the British fleet confronted as its primary foe neither the large Japanese or US fleets, but rather (with France) the German fleet. Not only was the German fleet small, smaller indeed than the French fleet, it was below the strength permitted under the 1935 naval agreement with Britain.52 As Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, put it in September 1939: ‘the Germans have only seven ships worth considering, to wit: the two 26,000 tons battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau; the three so-called pocket battleships, which are really ill-constructed heavy cruisers, and two excellent 10,000 ton 8 inch cruisers’.53 What a contrast to 1914! More threatening was the Italian fleet which came into the war against Britain in 1940: it had seven battleships. It was not until the very end of 1941 that the Royal Navy confronted a major naval power: Japan. By then the Imperial Japanese Navy had eleven battleships, but the Royal Navy would have had no fewer than eighteen battleships had it not been for 50\n\n51 52 53\n\nUS ships had total horsepower of no more than 40,000 shaft horsepower (shp). The lowest powered of the British ships (the five Royal Sovereign-class battleships and the Nelson and Rodney had 45,000 shp, five had around 75,000, and three had more than 120,000. After reconstruction, and only then, the Japanese fleet had around six ships with around 75,000 shp and four around 130,000. I owe this crucial point to John Brooks, personal communication.

The ‘pocket-battleships’ were ‘pocket’ in the sense that they were about one-third the size of a contemporary battleship, and ‘battleships’ in that they carried 11-inch guns, like the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau.
