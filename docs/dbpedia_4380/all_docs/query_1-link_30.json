        "text": "After our longer discourse on the history of magnetic variation, we return today to the history of navigation in England during the second half of the sixteenth century. John Dee (1527–c. 1608) was a central figure in the English mathematical world during this period. His name has already turned up in several of the earlier posts in this series. I have also in the past written posts about other aspects of Dee’s mathematical activity. In this post I want to gather together his contribution to the developments in navigation and cartography during this period.\n\nIt is worth looking at the beginnings of Dee’s path through life to see how he became England’s leading authority on all things mathematical, as at that time the land was actually largely a mathematical desert. Dee’s family came from Wales, where they lived on the Radnorshire border with England and the family name was Ddu, the Welsh for black. John’s father, Roland, like other members of the family, emigrated to London where the family name was pronounced Dye and eventually mutated to Dee. Roland was a mercer, that is a cloth trader at a time when England’s wealth was based on the cloth trade.\n\nIn 1524 John married the fifteen-year-old Jane Wilde the heiress of William Wilde of Milton-next-Gravesend in Kent. A daughter was born in 1525 and John in 1527, followed by three other sons. The Wilde’s were connected to the court of Henry VIII and Roland would become a “gentleman sewer” to the king and in the 1540s a Packer to the Strangers, assessing customs on exports by foreigners, and charging fees for packing them. He also became a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers on 19 February 1543. His social rise would end disastrously in 1547, but we are running ahead of our narrative, which is actually about John and not his father.\n\nAs noted above John was born into a prospering and aspiring family. John was enrolled in Chelmsford Chantry School in 1535, which was rebranded the King Edward VI Grammar School in 1551 and still going strong today. Here he was taught Latin, a prerequisite for attending university. In November 1542, aged fifteen, he entered St. John’s College Cambridge, which had only been founded thirty years before, and graduated BA in 1546. . St John’s had a strong Protestant fraction, and Dee was Catholic, so he was denied a fellowship. However, Henry VIII made Dee a founding junior Fellow of Trinity College in December 1546. He taught logic and sophistry for two years in the University Schools before graduating MA in 1548, now twenty-one-years-old.\n\nDee had already developed a favour for mathematics and although nominally taught, mathematics was largely ignored at Cambridge. Roger Ascham (c. 1515–1568), a Fellow of St. John’s who lectured on mathematics on mathematics in 1539-40, dismissed excessive devotion to such manual studies, which rendered gentlemen ‘unapt to serve in the world.’ At Trinity Dee found a patron in the Greek scholar John Christopherson (died 1558), who arranged for him to study at the University of Louvain in the summer of 1547 with a commendatory letter from Christopherson and money from Trinity. Louvain became Dee’s mathematical home. He returned there when he graduated MA in 1548, once again financed by Trinity College.[1]\n\nDee was by no means the only scholar from Britain who sought a mathematical education on the continent. The Scotsmen, John Craig (died 1620) and Duncan Liddel (1561–1613) both sought their mathematical education in the universities of Northern Germany.\n\nHenry Saville (1549–1622), who endowed the first chairs for astronomy and geometry at an English university, at Oxford in 1619, deepened his mathematical knowledge with an extensive tour of Europe.\n\nIn Louvain Gemma Frisius (1508–1555) was actually professor for medicine but he was also the leading cosmographer in Europe. He both worked in and taught mathematics, astronomy, astrology, geography, cartography, surveying, and globe and instrument making. He edited and published numerous new updated and expanded editions of the Cosmographia of Peter Apian (1495–1552).\n\nHe was a notable teacher with Johannes Stadius (c. 1527–1579), Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564), and Rembert Dodoens (1517–1585) amongst his student. He became Dee’s teacher in cosmography ably aided by his own most famous pupil Gerard Mercator (1512–1594), who remained Dee’s close friend and correspondent.\n\nThrough Frisius and Mercator, Dee also became friends with Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598), Mercator’s cartographical friend and rival. Through his time in Louvain Dee was already established in the inner circle of the European cosmographical elite.\n\nWhen John Dee had returned from Louvain in 1547, he had brought with him besides ‘sea-compasses of divers sortes,’ what were comparative novelties in England, ‘rare and exquisitely made instruments Mathematical,’ ‘two great globes of Gerardus Mercator’s making,’ and astronomical instruments. These he had given to Trinity College, Cambridge, for ‘the use of the Fellows and Scholars.’[2]\n\nIn 1550, Dee returned to the continent, this time to Paris, carrying with him a letter of introduction from Mercator. He held lectures at the university on Euclid and became friends with the Huguenot, anti-Aristotelian mathematician Pierre de la Ramée (1515–1572).\n\nHe claimed to have been offered a chair for mathematics in Paris, but there is some doubt about this claim. In 1563, Dee visited Italy where he met with Federico Commandino (1509–1575) noted from his numerous translations of mathematical treatises from Greek into Latin. Dee presented him with a manuscript that was published in Pesaro as De superficierum divisionibus liber Machometo Bagdedino ascriptus nunc primum Joannis Dee Londinensis et Federici Commandini Urbinatis opera in lucem editus. Federici Commandini de eadem re libellus in 1570.\n\nThe most puzzling of John Dee’s continental connections concerns the Portuguese cosmographer and mathematician Pedro Nunes (1502–1578), famous for being the mathematician, who determined that a course of constant bearing would be a loxodrome or rhumb line, the basis on which the Mercator projection is based. In 1558, Dee published his first book, Propaedeumata aphoristica, an astrological/astronomical work. This contains a dedicatory letter addressed to Mercator in which Dee writes:\n\nYou should know that, besides the extremely dangerous illness from which I have suffered during the whole year just past, I have also borne many other inconveniences (from those who, etc.) which have very much hindered my studies, and that my strength has not yet been able to sustain the weight of such exertion and labor as the almost Herculean task will require for its completion. And if my work cannot be finished or published while I remain alive, I have bequeathed it to that most learned and grave man who is the sole relic and ornament and prop of the mathematical arts among us, D. D. Pedro Nuñes, of Salácia, and not long since prayed him strenuously that, if this work of mine should be brought to him after my death, he would kindly and humanely take it under his protection and use it in every way as if it were his own: that he would deign to complete it, finally, correct it, and polish it for the public use of philosophers as if it were entirely his. And I do not doubt that he will himself be a party to my wish if his life and health remain unimpaired, since he loves me faithfully and it is inborn in him by nature, and reinforced by will, industry, and habit, to cultivate diligently the arts most necessary to a Christian state.[3]\n\nIt would seem obvious from this text that Dee was closely acquainted with Nunes but there exists no known evidence, apart from this letter to Mercator, that the two even met or even corresponded. However, for the history of cosmography the friendship would obviously be highly significant.\n\nIn 1552, Dee met up with Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) when the latter was in London. Nothing is recorded of their exchange but I strongly suspect it had more to do with astrology than with mathematics.\n\nUnlike Craig and Liddel, who both did, Dee never visited Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) on the island of Hven and Dee was in Prague at the court of Rudolf II eighteen years before Tycho arrived there. However, the two did correspond on the subject of how to correctly measure the parallax of comets in order to determine if there were sublunar, as Aristotle, believed or supralunar as they actually are. This was a very hot topic in both astronomy and astrology in the sixteenth century.\n\nIn popular presentations, John Dee is almost exclusively presented as the arch-occultist, the man who consulted angels, wrote complex occult tomes and is discussed as the role model for Marlow’s Doctor Faustus and/or Shakespeare’s Prospero. So, I have presented Dee’s mathematical pedigree in a fair amount of detail in order to show that he was a fully integrated member of the sixteenth-century European mathematical elite and not just away with the fairies.\n\nDee’s most significant mathematical work was the ‘Mathematicall Praeface’ to Sir Henry Billingsley’s English translation of the Element of Euclid, published in 1570. Both the translation and Dee’s preface had a major impact on the development of mathematics in sixteenth century England. In his preface Dee gives the first definition by an English scholar of navigation at the same time demonstrating that he is a cosmographer in the mould of Frisius and Nunes by coupling it with definitions of hydrography, astronomy, astrology and horometry.\n\nTHE ARTE OF NAVIGATION, demonstrateth how, by the shortest good way, by the aptest Directiō, & in the shortest time, a sufficient Ship, betwene any two places (in passage Nauvigable,) assigned : may be cōnducted : and in all stormes, & naturall disturbances chauncyng, how, to vse the best possible meanes, whereby to recouer the place first assigned. What need the Master Pilote, hath of other Artes, here before recited, it is easie to know : as of Hydrographie, Astronomie, Astrologie, and Horometrie. Pre-supposing continually, the common Base, the foudacion of all : namely. Arithmeticke and Geometrie. So that, he be hable to vnderstand, and Iudge his own necessary Instrumentes, and furniture Necessary.\n\nThe definition carries on for several hundred more words, detailing what is necessary to determine latitude and longitude and various other things, which we don’t need to go into here. I found his emphasis on the return journey, ‘to recouer the place first assigned’ interesting. Let us look at some of his other definitions. Not mentioned above but highly relevant is his definition of geography:\n\n…GEOGRAPHIE teacheth wayes, by which, in sūndry forms, (as Sphaerike, Plaine or other), the Situation of Cities, Townes, Villages, Fortes, Castells, Mountaines, Woods, Hauens, Riuers, Crekes, & such other things, vpō the outface of the earthly Globe (either in the whole, or in some principall meber and portion thereof cōntayned) may be described and designed, in cōmensurations Analogicall to Nature and veritie : and most aptly to our view. May be represented. Of this Arte how great pleasure, and how manifolde commodities do come vnto vs, daily and hourly : of most men, is perceaued.\n\n[…]\n\nTo conclude, some, for one purpose : and some, for an other, liketh , loueth, getteth, and vseth, Mappes, Chartes and Geographicall Globes. Of whose vse, to speake sufficiently, would require a booke peculiar.\n\nHe describes hydrography in analogy to geography:\n\nHYDROGRAPHIE, deliuereth to our knowledge, on Globe or in Plain, the perfect Analogicall description of the Ocean Sea coastes, through the whole world : por in the chief and principle partes thereof : with the Iles and chiefe particular places of daungers, conteyned within the boundes, and Sea coastes described : as, of Quicksandes, Bankes, Pittes, Rockes, Races, Countertides, Whorlepooles, etc. This dealeth with the Element of water chiefly : as Geographie did take principally the elements of the Earthes description (with his appurtenances) to taske.\n\nAs with the definitions of navigation and geography this goes on in more detail but we will now turn to Dee’s definitions of astronomy, astrology and horometry.\n\n…ASTRONOMIE; is an Arte Mathematicall which demonstrateth the distance, magnitudes, and all naturall motions apparences, and passions propre to the Planets andfixed Sterres : for any time past, present and to come : in respect to a certaine Horizon, or without respect to any Horizon. By this Arte we are certified of the distance of the Starry Skye, and of eche Planete from the centre of the Earth : and of the greatnes of any Fixed starre sene, or Planete, in respect to the Earthes greatnes …\n\nOf ASTROLOGIE, here I make an Arte, seuerall from Astronomie : not by new diuise, but by good reason and authoritie : for, Astrologie, is an Arte Mathematicall, which reasonably demonstrateth the operations and effectes, of the naturall beames, of light, and secrete influence : of the Sterres and Planets : in euery elementall body, at all times, in any Horizon assigned…\n\nWhat today seems strange, the inclusion of astrology in Dee’s navigation’s definition, would have seemed perfectly normal in the sixteenth century. What he doesn’t mention here in this definition is that astrological almanacs were used by navigators because of the actual astronomical data, such as luna phases, that they contained to which in this period tide tables had already begun to be added.\n\nHOROMETRIE; is an Arte Mathematicall, which demōnstrateth, how at all times appointed, the precise vsvall demoninatiō of time, may be knowen, for any place assigned…[4]\n\nDee worked as an advisor, teacher, and supplier of charts and instruments for ships masters and pilots. He mostly did this work for the Muscovy Trading Company, so we need to know something about this organisation.\n\nThe Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands was an early joint stock association, set up by Richard Chancellor (c. 1521–1556), Sebastian Cabot (c. 1474–1557), and Sir Hugh Willoughby (fl. 1544–died 1554), in order to search for a Northeast Passage to China. Willoughby and Chancellor set of on an expedition to search for the Northeast Passage in 1553, in which Stephen Borough (1525–1585) took part.\n\nThe Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands was rechartered as the Muscovy Company by Mary I of England in 1555. A second expedition to Russia led by Chancellor took place in the same year. They continued to trade with Russia over the next years. In 1556, Stephen Borough led a new expedition to attempt to find the Northeast Passage.\n\nIn 1576, the Muscovy Company licenced the expedition led by Martin Frobisher (c. 1535–1594) to find the Northwest Passage. In 1577, Frobisher launched a second attempt to find the Northwest Passage, this time under the auspices of the Cathay Company, newly founded by Frobisher and Michael Lok (c. 1532–c.1621). In 1578, Frobisher undertook his greatest expedition to the northwestern Artic waters this time planning on establishing a colony. Like the previous two expeditions this one also failed.\n\nThe Muscovy Company continued to explore the Artic waters, trade with Russia, and hunt whales into the seventeenth century. From the very first expedition of Willoughby and Chancellor, for which he wrote his TheAstronomicall and Logisticall Rules and Canons to calculate the Ephemerides to be used on the voyage, John Dee acted as cosmographical advisor to the pilots and masters of the Muscovy Company up till 1583 when he left England for the continent. He also instructed Frobisher and Christopher Hall, his master, in the use of navigational instruments and the mathematics of navigation, as well as advising them which books, charts, and instruments the expedition should purchase. Dee was also a shareholder in the Cathey Company.\n\nDee advised, taught and supplied, books, charts and instruments over thirty years to Chancellor, Stephen Borough, with whom he developed his Paradoxal compass, a circumpolar chart for sailing in Artic waters where the distortions of a Mercator projection are too great, William Borough (1536–1598), Humphrey Gilbert (c. 1539–1583), and John Davis (c. 1550–1605). These were the leading English master pilots in the first decades during which England tried to make ground good in marine exploration following the Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese, who all had a substantial lead in this new endeavour.\n\nDuring this early period, the third quarter of the sixteenth century, the Muscovy Company was the only formal, chartered English trading in existence. The Levant Company was first chartered by Elizabeth I in 1592 following the merger of the Venice Company, chartered 1583, and the Turkey Company, chartered 1581, The most famous company, The East India Company was first chartered in 1600 and the Hudson’s Bay Company wasn’t chartered until 1670. In those first three decades, John Dee haven’t acquired his education largely on the continent was the only cosmographical advisor working in England and his services were eagerly sought after. When he departed for the continent to follow his, much better known, occult ambitions. He was superceded by Thomas Digges (1546–1595), his adoptive son, Thomas Harriot (1560–1621), who became Walter Raleigh’s chief cosmographical advisor and the ‘first scientist in America,’ Edward Wright (1561–1615), and others.\n\nIn the 1570s, Dee began preparing a major text on his involvement in marine expeditions, which he planned to publish in four volumes. In 1576, Dee published the first of the four volumes, his General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation, which despite its title has nothing to do with navigation as discussed above.\n\nThis book was an appeal to Queen Elizabeth to support the founding of British colonies and is the first book to coin the phrase British Empire. Dee produced some complex, spurious, historical arguments to justify England’s supposed claim to North America. The second volume of this work was intended to collect and publish all of his manuscripts on navigation but he was unable to find a sponsor for what would have been an expensive project because of all the tables and diagrams that the book would require and the manuscript has been lost.\n\nDee’s important contributions to the early decades of England’s deep sea explorations, which were very important, tend to get overlooked in the shrill comments about his later occult activities.\n\n[1] The details of Dee’s family background and his education are largely taken from Glyn Parry, The Arch-Conjuror of England: John Dee, Yale University Press, 2011\n\n[2] David Waters, The Art of Navigation in England in Elizabethan and Early Stuart Times, Yale University Press, 1958 quoting E. G. R. Taylor, Tudor Geography, ( 1485–1583), Routledge, 1930.\n\n[3] Bruno Almeida, On the origins of Dee’s mathematical programme: The John Dee–Pedro Nunes connection, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A, Volume 43, Issue 3, September 2012, pp. 460-469\n\n[4] All the definitions are taken from Waters pp 521–524\n\nIn this mini-series of blog posts we have followed the history of the English investigators of and writers on the phenomenon of declination or variation of the magnetic compass. Magnetic variation is the fact that although a magnetic needle aligns north/south the north that it points to, the magnetic north pole, is not the same as the geographical north pole. More than this, the amount that the magnetic north pole varies from the geographical north pole varies from location to location.\n\nInitially navigators held theories or beliefs that these variations where somehow geographically regular and that they could be used to solve the major problem of determining longitude at sea. However, the more that European mariners ventured out onto the earth’s oceans and the more magnetic variations they determined, the more it became obvious that these followed no discernible pattern or regularity and thus could not be used to determine longitude. It seemed that this hope was finally laid to rest with the publication of William Gilbert’s De magnete in 1600, when Gilbert having surveyed all the available evidence categorically rejected the concept of regularity in magnetic variation. However, Gilbert continued believing that variation was constant for a given location and endorsed the suggestion of the Dutch polymath, Simon Stevin (1548–1620) put forward in his De Havenvinding (1599), also published in English as The Haven-Finding Art in the same year and included as an appendix in later editions Edward Wright’s Certaine Errors in Navigation, to provide tables of the correctly measured variation to compare with measured observations as an aid to navigation.\n\nDespite Gilbert’s rejection of any form of regularity in magnetic variation, in the first decade of the seventeenth century, first the French author Guillaume de Nautonier, sieur de Castel-Franc au haut Languedoc, Géographe du roi Henri IV (1560– 1620) in his Mecometrie de leymant cest a dire La maniere de mesurer les longitudes par le moyen de l’eymant (The mecometry of the loadstone or the way to determining the longitude by means of the loadstone…), published in 1603 or 1604, and secondly the English author Anthony Linton, chaplain to Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham, who served as High Admiral from 1585–1618, of his Newes of the Complement of the Art of Navigation. And of the Mightie Empire of Cataia Together with the Straits of Anian, published in 1608, relaunched the idea of determining longitude with magnetic variation.\n\nThe idea was finally dealt what should have been a death blow[1] with the discovery in 1631 that the magnetic north displayed by the compass varied from the geographic north pole by differing amounts from location to location but that it also varied over time for a given location. How this was discovered and more importantly how this discovery was actually confirmed is the subject of this episode.\n\nThe discovery is attributed to Henry Gellibrand (1597–1637), who published the news in his A discourse mathematical of the variation of the magneticall needle together with its admirable diminution lately discovered (1635), but a total of five people contributed to this discovery over a period of sixty two years.\n\nThe story starts with the Elizabethan mathematicus, Thomas Digges (c. 1546–1595), who was the foster son of John Dee (1527–1608 or 1609), who we have met several times in this series, his father, Leonard (c. 1515–c. 1559), another mathematicus, having died when he was just thirteen years old. In 1571, Thomas Digges published a figure of 11° 15’ E in 1571, which was confirmed by William Borough (1536–1599), who made nine measurements in 1580, which he published in his A Discourse on the Variation of the Cumpas, or magneticall needle: Wherein is mathematically shewed, the manner of the obseruation, effects, and application thereof in 1581. This figure was accepted by William Gilbert (1544?–1603) in his work and Edward Wright (1561–1615) in his Certaine Errors.\n\nIn 1619, the mathematicus Edmund Gunter (1581–1626) (who I have dealt with in detail here) was appointed Gresham Professor of Mathematics, on the recommendation of Henry Briggs (1561–1630), and in 1622 he redetermined the magnetic variation of London and found it to be 6° 15′ E, significantly different to Borough’s value. Disturbed by this substantial difference to Borough’s value Gunter inquired as to the exact place where in Limehouse, Borough had made his observations. Then, with ‘a Quadrant of three feet Semidiameter, and two Needles, the one above 6 inches and the other 10 inches long’, had proceeded to the spot. Towards the night of 13 June 1622, he made observations of the sun’s azimuth from several parts of the ground and he stated, had obtained the following results:\n\nThe mean of theses observations 5° 55′ E is less by 20′ than Gunter’s previous observations and is almost half that of Borough’s of 1580.[2] Gunter, maybe not unnaturally, assumed that Borough’s observations were inaccurate, after all the history of magnetic variation up till that time had been littered with false or inaccurate determinations.\n\nGunter died in 1626 and, once again, on the recommendation of Henry Briggs, Henry Gellibrand was appointed as his successor. Gellibrand born in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate, London the eldest son of Henry Gellibrand (d. 1615), fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford 1616 graduating BA in 1619, and MA 1623. He took holy orders and was appointed to a curacy at Chiddingstone, Kent. However, inspired by a lecture by Henry Savile’s lectures he devoted his life to mathematics. Settling in Oxford he befriended Henry Briggs and when Briggs died in 1630 Gellibrand took over editing his Trigonometria Britannica, which he published in 1633.\n\nGellibrand devoted much of his time to trying to find a solution to the longitude problem, publishing An appendix concerning longitude in The Strange and Dangerous Voyage of Captaine Thomas James (1633).\n\nAs already noted Gellibrand remeasured the magnetic variation at exactly the same place as Gunter in 1631 and found it to now be 4° 05′ E, even less that Gunter’s value. There existed a problem with these values, Borough had been long dead when Gunter and Gellibrand made their measurements and Gunter dead when Gellibrand made his so it would seem that nobody could confirm that the measurements made by the others had been made correctly. However, there were two qualified witnesses to both the measurements of Gunter and Gellibrand, the first of these was the instrument maker, John Marr (fl. 1614–1647), who played a central role in the whole story.\n\nJohn Marr is one of those minor figures about whom we know very little but on this occasion played a significant role in the history of science and technology. Marr or Mair was a Scotsman who served both James I and Charles I as a compass-maker, dialist and dial maker. According to the astrologer William Lilly (1602–1681), Marr was an excellent mathematician and geometrician. Lilly also claimed that Marr was familiar with both Henry Briggs and John Napier (1550–1617) and had been present at the first meeting of the two compilers of logarithmic tables in Edinburgh in 1614. In 1631, Marr and Elias Allen (c. 1588–1653) had supplied magnetic needles of special quality to Captain Thomas James (1593–1635) for his Arctic voyage. It was in the account of this voyage that Gellibrand published his work on longitude, as mentioned above.\n\nJohn Marr worked together with Edmund Gunter and had taken part in his measurement of the magnetic variation in Limehouse in 1622. Also present on that occasion was John Wells (fl. 1606–35), who held the post of storekeeper for life at the Navel Storehouses at Deptford. He was also a mathematical practitioner who had an excellent reputation as a dial maker. Like Marr he belonged to the circle around Henry Briggs, Edmund Gunter , and Henry Gellibrand. Wells wrote one book, Sciographia or the Art of Shadows (1634), on the construction of dials. Originally only a manuscript written for a friend, Edmund Gunter read it and urged him to publish it. After Gunter deaths it was still unpublished and now Henry Gellibrand renewed the urging, writing a preface for the published book.[3]\n\nIn 1622, when Gunter and Marr found the substantial difference between their determination of variation and that of Borough forty years earlier, they decided to cross the river and repeat their measurements in John Wells’ garden. This meant that both Marr and Wells could accurately report on Gunter’s measurement procedure and his results.\n\nIn fact, it was Marr, who originally repeated Gunter’s measurements, this time in Whitehall, with one of Gunter’s needles from the earlier trials in 1631 and obtained the new value of 4° 05′ E. He took this disturbing result to Gellibrand and a team including Gellibrand, Marr and Wells repeated exactly as possible Gunter’s measurements in Limehouse and also across the riven in Wells’ garden confirming that the magnetic variation had indeed changed once again.\n\nAs noted above, Gellibrand then published the results of these trials in 1635 and is generally given credit alone for the discovery but without the testimony of Marr and Wells, Gellibrand’s discovery might well not have been accepted as it was.\n\nOf course, none of those involved could actually explain why the variation varied over time or even why the variation existed in the first place. As we will see in the next post there would be various explanations offered over the years without any of them actually being correct. As we now know the variation in variation over time is caused by the fact that the pole is not static but wanders.\n\nTrue polar wander represents the shift in the geographical poles relative to Earth’s surface, after accounting for the motion of the tectonic plates. This motion is caused by the rearrangement of the mantle and the crust in order to align the maximal inertia with the current rotation axis. (Wikipedia)\n\n[1] We will see that hopes dies eternal in the next post in this series.\n\n[2] David Waters, The Art of Navigation in England in Elizabethan and Early Stuart Times, Yale University Press, New Haven, 1958\n\n[3] The brief accounts of John Marr and John Wells are taken from E.

Wells p. 199\n\nIn the years following the publication of De Magnete in 1600 and the death of William Gilbert in 1603 a dispute developed between two leading English magnetists, William Barlow (1544 – 1625) and Dr Mark Ridley (1560–c. 1624), as to which of them was Gilbert’s true disciple.\n\nWe have already met William Barlow, son of a bishop, who was a successful career Church of England cleric, who never went to sea but became an expert on magnetism and navigation and was especially known for his mariner’s compass and variation compass designs. In 1605, he was appointed tutor and chaplain to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (1594–1612). Later, 1608 or 1609, the mathematician Edward Wright (1561–1615) was also appointed a tutor of Henry Frederick. Both Barlow and Wright were closely involved in the genesis of William Gilbert’s De Magnete. Barlow had also published a demonstration of Wright’s Mercator projection “obtained of a friend of mone of like professioin unto myself,” in his The Navigator’s Supply (1597). Both men lost their positions as tutor, when Henry Frederick died.\n\nWe now leave Barlow for the moment and turn our attention the Mark Ridley, who we first met as one of the residents of Gilbert’s Wingfield house in London. In many ways Ridley’s career paralleled that of his erstwhile landlord. Ridley was born the second son of the six children of the Lancelot Ridley rector of Stretham in Cambridgeshire. Lancelot Ridley was an early prominent Protestant, promoted under Thomas Cranmer and favoured during the reign of Edward VI. He was subsequently deprived under Mary but rose again to prominence under Elizabeth I. Mark matriculated as a pensioner at Claire College Cambridge in 1577, graduating BA in 1581 and MA in 1584. He was licenced to practice medicine by the College of Physicians in 1590 and graduated MD in 1592.\n\nOn 27 May 1594 he was appointed by Elizabeth, on the recommendation of William Cecil, to serve Feodor Ivanovich, the tsar of Russia as physician.\n\nHe worked for five years in Moscow and on the death of Tsar Feodor in 1599, he was appointed physician to of his successor, Boris Godunov. Elizabeth requested that he be allowed to return to London in that year and Boris Godunov wrote to her commending him for his faithful service and releasing him.\n\nRidley became an active member of the College of Physicians and like Gilbert before him rose in their ranks, being elected censor in 1607. Over the years he was regularly elected to various offices in the organisation. Interestingly, Ridley is perhaps more significant as the author of the two Russian-English dictionaries than for his writings on magnetism.\n\nWhile living in Russia between 1594 and 1599, he compiled two manuscript dictionaries of Russian: a Russian-English dictionary of 7,203 entries entitled A dictionarie of the vulgar Russe tongue and an English-Russian dictionary of 8,113 entries entitled A dictionarie of the Englishe before the vulger Russe tonnge. The former includes a short grammar of Russian on the first eight folios. Both dictionaries are now held at theBodleian Library at the University of Oxford (MSS Laud misc. 47a and 47b). (Wikipedia)\n\nGilbert’s De Magnete was, of course, not without its critics. But in the early phase things remained fairly quiet, especially in England, where the book and its author were much admired. However, between 1603 and 1604 the splendidly named and titled Guillaume de Nautonier, sieur de Castel-Franc au haut Languedoc, Géographe du roi Henri IV (1560– 1620)\n\npublished the equally splendidly titled:\n\nMecometrie de leymant cest a dire La maniere de mesurer les longitudes par le moyen de l’eymant. Par laquelle est enseigné, un tres certain moyen, au paravant inconnu, de trouver les longitudes geographiques de tous lieux,–aussi facilement comme la latitude. Davantage, y est monstree la declinaison de la guideymant, pour tous lieux. Œuvre nécessaire aux admiraux, cosmographes, astrologues, geographes, pilotes, geometriens, ingenieux, mestres des mines, architectes, et quadraniers. (The mecometry of the loadstone or the way to determining the longitude by means of the loadstone…)\n\nIn this work Le Nautonier accepts Gilbert’s claim that the Earth is a magnet but claims that he discovered this independently, although, unlike Gilbert, he offers no experiments or other proofs to back up his claim. He was the first to state that the Earth is a tilted dipole, giving 67°N and 67°S for their latitudes and by modern reckoning approximately 30°E and 150°W as their longitudes. He stated that the Earth was a perfect sphere, and, as the book title states, resurrected the already debunked theory that magnetic variation was regular and using it one could determine longitude. He devoted a lot of space to refuting Gilbert’s explanations of the irregularities in variation. Initially there was no reaction to this book in England, although it would be thoroughly debunked in France by Didier Dounot (1574–1640), professor for mathematics on the Académies du roi, in his Confutation de l’invention des longitudes ou De la mecometrie de l’eymant. Cy devant mise en lumiere souz le nom de Guillaume le Nautonnier, sieur de Castel-Franc au haut Languedoc (1611)\n\nThe first reactions in England were triggered in 1608 by the publication by Anthony Linton, chaplain to Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham, who served as High Admiral from 1585–1618, of his Newes of the Complement of the Art of Navigation. And of the Mightie Empire of Cataia Together with the Straits of Anian.\n\nIn this rather strange volume, Linton, “after citing the criticisms of the art of navigation of Humphrey Gilbert, Thomas Digges, William Borough, Richard Polter, and Edward Wright, whose chart he praised, he pointed out that in navigation position-finding was still imperfect.”[1] Rather stating the obvious. He then claimed that any navigator could ‘make his conclusions of Latitude, Longitude, and Variation,’ as accurately ‘as is possible to be done in any other Mathematicall practice in use amongst us’ by ‘continued observation’, and by exploiting the existence of the two magnetic poles. By the use of certain globes and charts of his devising, obtainable at a price, and ‘in six other ways’, the navigator, knowing , ‘the vaiation of the Compasse and the Latitude of the place’ would find out by Aritmeticall calculation the true longitude of the same place’. However, for the satisfactory working of this admirable but obscurely worded system there appeared to be one serious drawback only, namely, that it required ‘professors of greater skill and practice in the Mathematics, then now commonly found’.[2] This very jumbled account obviously preaches the same gospel as Le Nautonier’s early work and raises the question, whether Linton had plagiarised it, to which we don’t know the answer.\n\nBoth of Henry Frederick’s navigation tutors now responded to Linton and Le Nautonier’s arguments. De Magnete was written in Latin and first got translated into English in the nineteenth century. This meant that his theories were not accessible to the mariners who couldn’t read Latin. Barlow wrote a manuscript presenting and explaining Gilbert’s ideas on magnetism and the compass in English. In this work he argued against and debunked the theory propagated by Linton and Le Nautonier. Barlow gave a copy of the manuscript to Sir Thomas Chaloner (1559–1615), a courtier and Governor of the Courtly College for the household of Prince Henry Frederick, so basically Barlow’s employer as chaplain and tutor to the prince. Chaloner manage to lose this manuscript as well as a second copy that he had agreed to have published. This was the situation in 1615, when Chaloner died.\n\nEdward Wright simply refuted the argument in an appendix to the expanded second edition of his Certaine Errors in Navigation, arising either of the Ordinarie Erroneous Making or Vsing of the Sea Chart, Compasse, Crosse Staffe, and Tables of Declination of the Sunne, and Fixed Starres Detected and Corrected published in 1610, in which he listed the observed variation in many places. The volume was dedicated to “THE HIGH AND MIGHTIE PRINCE HENRY; eldest Son to our soueraigne Lord King Iames: Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwell, Earle of Chester, &c.”\n\nRidley entered the fray in 1613 with the publication of his first book on magnetism:\n\nA SHORT TREATISE of Magneticall Bodies and Motions. By Marke Ridley Dr in phisicke and Philosophie Latly Physition to the Emperour of Russia, and one of ye eight principals or Elects of the Colledge of Physitions in London. London Printed by Nicholas Okes. 1613.\n\nLike Barlow he presented his theories in English for those who couldn’t read Latin. He debunked the various myths about the healing power of magnets etc and propagated the theories of Gilbert as presented in De Magnete. He then goes on to debunk the theories of Linton and Le Nautonier. After which he presents his own incorrect theory:\n\n‘when travelling or sailing … it will be very necessary for thee to be stored with the Marriners Compasse for the sea … to know the way … and also to have the Inclinatory-needle truly placed in his ring, and the Directory needle, or a little flie Magneticall in the boxe, fastened at the bottome … for to know under what latitude thou art every day of thy voyage …’ Now one of the chief purposes of his book was to describe the benefits that would arise from the use of ‘the Directory-Magneticall-needle … for the description of Ports, Havens, Forelands, Capes, Bayes, and Rivers, for the more perfect making of Sea-cardes … and all Mathematicall instruments for measuring and surveying …’ and to explain the manner of using it. Yet the instrument was fundamentally unsound, for the mutual attraction and repulsion of the magnetical needles in close juxtaposition, such as he envisaged, foredoomed it to failure because of the resultant errors.[3]\n\nRidley then goes on to deliver a wide ranging account of loadstones and compasses followed by the latest discoveries of Galileo and Kepler. He gives accounts of Gilberts theory of variation, Blagrave’s Mathematicall Jewell, preferring Blagrave’s astrolabe to that of Gemma Frisius, accounts of the work of Wright, Brigg’s tables in Blunderville’s book, The Seven Planets, a description of a quadrant and the log-line etc, etc.\n\nThe publication of Ridley’s Magneticall Bodies possibly inspired a fifth editions of Robert Norman’s The Newe Attractive and William Borough’s A Discourse on the Variation of the Cumpas in 1614 and it almost certainly prompted Barlow to publish his manuscript from 1609 in 1616 as:\n\nMAGNETICALL Aduertisements : or DIVERS PERTINENT obserruations, and approued experiments concerning the nature and properties of the Load-stone: Very pleasant for knowledge, and most needful for practice, or trauelling, or framing of Instruments fir for trauellers both by Sea and Land.\n\nAct. 17.26 He hath made of one bloud all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of theior habitation, that they should seeke the Lord, &c.\n\nLONDON; Printed by Edward Griffin for Timothy Barlow, and are to be sold at his shop in Pauls Church-yard at the signe of the Bull-head. 1616.\n\nHe didn’t name Ridley directly but referred to his “propositions set abroad in another man’s name and yet some of them not rightly understood by the partie usurping them.”[4] He wrote:\n\nI was the first that made the inclinatory instrument transparent to be used pendant, with a glass on both sides, and a ring at the top … and moreover I hanged him in a compass box, wjere with two onces weight he will be fit for use at sea. I first found out and showed the difference between iron and steel, and their tempers for magnetical uses … I was also the first that showed the right way of touching needles …[5]\n\nTo demonstrate that he, not Ridley, was Gilbert’s heir he stated that he had been researching magnetism since 1576 and that Gilbert had appreciated his contributions. To prove this, he included a letter that Gilbert had sent to him in 1602. This is in fact the only letter of Gilbert’s that has survived:\n\nTo the Worshipfull my good friend, Mr. William Barlowe at Easton by Winchester.\n\nRecommendations with many thanks for your paines and courtesies, for your diligence and enquiring, and finding diuers good secrets, I pray proceede with double capping your load-stone you speake of, I shall bee glad to see you, as you write, as any man, I will haue any leisure, if it were a moneth, to conferre with you, you have shewed mee more–and brought more light than any man hath done. Sir, I will commend you to my L. of Effingham, there is heere a wise learned man, a Secretary of Venice, he came sent by that State, and was honourably received by her Majesty, he brought me a lattin letter from a Gentle-man of Venice that is very well learned, whose name is Iohannes Franciscus Sagredus, he is a great Magneticall man, and writeth that hee hath conferred with diuers learned men in Venice and with Readers of Padua, and reporteth wonderfull liking of my booke, you shall have a copy of the letter: Sir, I propose to adioyne an appendix of six or eight sheets of paper to my booke after a while, I am in hand with it of some new inuentions and I would haue some of your experiments, in your name and inuention put into it, if you please, that you may be knowen for an augmener of that art. So for this time in haste I take my leaue the xiiyth of February.\n\nYour very louing friend,\n\nW. Gilbert[6]\n\nOne major bone of contention between the two disciples of Gilbert was his embrace of Copernicanism with his assumption of a magnetic diurnal rotation of the Earth. As a conservative official of the Church, Barlow totally rejected this aspect of Gilbert’s work, remaining a staunch geocentrist. Ridley, however, going further than Gilbert, adopted a full heliocentric cosmology, as can be seen from his inclusion of the newest results from Galileo and Kepler in his book.\n\nBarlow’s veiled accusation of plagiarism did not escape Ridley and he responded with a pamphlet: Magneticall Animadversions. Made by Dr Mark Ridley, Doctor in Physicke. Upon certain Magneticall Advertisements, lately published, From Maister William Barlow. (1617) His criticism was scathing:\n\n‘There is almost no proposition in this book which most Mariners, Instrument-Makers, Compasse -makers, Cocke-makers, and Cutlers of the better and more understanding sort around London and the Suburbs have not known, practized, and made long before.’ His so-called inventions were ‘most of them in the Doctor Gilbert’s Booke, as I said before, or else such ordinary things that any ingenious workman hath or may easily invent or make; unles you hold all men Dulberts like your rare workman of Winchester.’[7]\n\nBarlow’s response came immediately in his, A Briefe Discovery of the Idle Animadversions of Marke Ridley (1618):\n\nThis time it was personal. He tried to discredit Ridley, suggesting that he had morally compromised himself in order to ‘in so short a time become [the Russian] Empoerors principall Physition.’ In a double entendre to Ridley’s observations or ‘looks’ with the new-fangled telescope, he insinuated that the youthful Ridley had seduced the Czar, ‘for his lookes … are his meanes.’[8]\n\nRidley delivered a parting shot with his, Appendix or an Addition … unto his Magneticall Treatise in answer to M. Barlow (1618).\n\nDespite Ridley’s attacks, Barlow reprinted his Magneticall Advertisements unchanged, except for a new title page, in 1618.\n\nAnd so, the verbal war between the two heirs of William Gilbert ground to a halt. In their major publications, in this unpleasant exchange, both had made important contributions to the ongoing debate on magnetism and the compass, most importantly making much of Gilbert’s work accessible in English, for those unable to read Latin. However, at the same time they had made a public spectacle of themselves in their bitter dispute, a behaviour that was, unfortunately all too common amongst scholars during the Renaissance.\n\n[1] David W.

Apart from the ubiquitous wheel, which is almost certainly the most common answer, unless they are historians, they will almost always name something comparatively modern and usually big and impressive–the steam engine, the automobile, the airplane, the computer or whatever. However, having been at one time in my life, for a number of years, an archaeologist, I am very much aware of the massive impact that seemingly everyday things had on the development of human society–the most obvious is cooking with fire, but also making, ceramics, bricks, glass, simple tools, and many other things many of them seemingly small and insignificant. In response to a fascinating blog post by Rachel Laudan on the uses to which gourds were put in the history of cooking, I once wrote a blog post on the significance of the invention of the sewing needle.\n\nThis being the case, I couldn’t resist when I came across reviews of Roma Agrawal’s book Nuts & Bolts and bought a copy, which I read with growing enthusiasm and delight. I couldn’t resist because the full title is Nuts & Bolts: Seven Small Inventions That Changed the World (in a Big Way).[1]\n\nRoma Agrawal is not a historian but a structural engineer, a graduate of Oxford University, BA physics, and Imperial college, MA Structural engineering, who has worked on major engineering project, including the Shard in London. In her book she brings an engineer’s eyes to a popular historical view of the nail, the wheel, the spring, the magnet, the lens, string, and the pump. Outlining not only their origins, their evolution, the multiple forms they have taken and the multiple uses to which they have been put but also giving a soft scientific and engineering explanation of how they work in terms of forces and resistance.\n\nFrom the outset this book is wonderfully written and a delight to read. The world’s textbook writers could learn a lesson or two from Agrawal on how to hold a reader’s interest and entertain them whilst at the same time educating them. She makes it seem very easy.\n\nShe starts with the nail, a very simple, small, seemingly insignificant everyday object that most people wouldn’t even think of when asked to list important historical invention. However, the nail is and has been a very important element in building projects of all sizes throughout the world for millennia. She traces its origins, its developments, and its very important transition from being hand forged to machine made. She explains how the force of friction enables nails to hold things together. However, she doesn’t just deal with nails in this chapter but with screws, rivets, and nuts and bolts, which as she explains are all basically evolved forms of the humble nail. In this direction the mental leap that most surprised me is that the piles–wood, metal, concrete–driven into the ground to support building are in reality just very big nails.\n\nAfter the nail, Agrawal turns to that perennial favourite greatest invention, the wheel. We of course get the wheel enabling transport but more significantly she takes her readers on a whirlwind tour of many of the other places where wheel can be found fulfilling an important function. We have the potter’s wheel, cog wheels and gear wheels, the invention of the bicycle and the invention of the gyroscope. She includes a fascinating section on Josephine Cochran’s invention of the dishwasher. One facet of Agrawal’s narratives is that where possible she draws attention to the contributions made by women to the history of technology. She takes us through the evolution of better wheels from the simple solid plank wheel down to the sophisticated spoked wheels of modern bicycles and closes by stating, “Human progress and the reincarnations of the wheel and axel are intricately intertwined. And that’s why we should absolutely continue to reinvent the wheel.”\n\nOur next small invention is the humble spring, which doesn’t immediately spring to mind when asked about the greatest inventions. (I’ll let myself out!) One revelation that totally blew my mind when I first read it, is that the bow, as in bow and arrow, is a spring! If you want to know why the elaborately curved Mongolian bow is superior to the European longbow this is the place to go. Moving on via springs in guns Agrawal land at a device that lives from its springs the mechanical clock. Here we meet another aspect of Agrawal’s approach, hands on. The opening paragraphs of the nail section found her hand forging nails in a smithy, we now find in the workshop of Dr Rebecca Struthers, independent watchmaker and horologist. Struthers put out her own book Hands of Time: A Watchmaker’s History of Time (Hodder & Stoughton) in 2023. The lady engineer and the lady watchmaker take the reader through the history of the clock and the central role that springs came to play in their construction. John Harrison, of course, gets a nod on route. Fascinatingly the structural engineer introduces her readers to building, suspended on springs to protect them from earthquakes or to shield them from external vibrations.\n\nOur interest is now directed to the magnet, where it is not long before we get briefly introduced Dr William Gilbert and his De Magnete but we don’t linger, quickly progressing to the development in magnets and their materials now that magnetism had been established as a science. Having sketched the developed the modern magnet we get introduced to the electric telegraph, a massive communications revolution, that depended on magnets. The electric telegraph was superceded by the telephone another communications device dependent on the magnet. This capital argues for the magnet as the driver of modernity with the television following on the heels of the telegraph and telephone. Here Agrawal pulls another rabbit out of her hat, ignoring the western developers in favour of the story Takayanagi Kenjiro the independent Japanese inventor of the television. The section closes with the story of LEDs.\n\nUp till now, whilst reading, I was really enjoying Agrawal’s fascinating and stimulating book and then I ran into her section on the lens, and soon wished I hadn’t. Readers of this blog will know that the history of optics is one of my special areas of study and I’m sorry but Agrawal’s story of the lens is a trainwreck! I’ll move on for now but return to the lens later.\n\nAs opposed to the chapter on the lens, the chapter on string is a delight. Agrawal opens with the steel cables that hold up suspension bridges, which is not what one normally thinks about when somebody uses the word string. However, as she points out the cables on smaller suspensions bridges, such as the one that was one of he first engineering projects, are twisted together out of steel fibres in exactly the same way as string is made by twisting together plant fibres. The heavier ones are made with a slightly different process but are also basically string. She then moves on to sewing and the sawing needle, sewing thread being, of course another form of string. Moving on we have cloth which is usually woven or knitted string. String has truly played a major roll in human history. The chapter closes with a discourse on music made with string instruments and instead of the violins or guitars, one might expect we get a fascinating detailed description on the tanpura, the drone instrument in Indian music, and how the strings are manipulated to produce the vibrating, droning sound.\n\nThe final chapter is devoted to the pump, which Agrawal defines as a way of raising water to a higher level. After a brief sketch of the history of the water lifting devices, she turns to a description of the most fascinating of all pumps, the human heart. The heart is a small pump with an incredible performance. However, Agrawal is not deviating from engineering to biology but the description of the heart is used as an introduction to the story of the development of the heart-lung machine, a truly fascinating story of a piece of medical engineering history. After this excurse into the medical discipline we follow Agrawal into the equally fascinating story of the development of the breast milk pump, which Agrawal was led to through her own problems with breast feeding.\n\nWe return to the lens. This starts, as much of the book, with a personal anecdote about the conception of Agrawal’s daughter, which was by artificial insemination and a description of the microscope developed to study the insemination of ova. This is one of several personal stories in the book that illustrates Agrawal’s interest in the topic under discussion. Having introduced the lens through the microscope, we now move back to the origins and history of the lens, here she goes off the rails. She accepts that the so-called Nimrud lenses (7thcentury BCE) are lenses and not simply ground and polished pieces of lens shaped crystal, for which there is simply no proof whatsoever. I think they are more probably decorative stones.\n\nShe now moves on to the Greeks and writes the following:\n\nThe Greeks laid down some basic rules of how light reflects off mirrors and even bends through lenses.\n\nThe Greeks did indeed study the basics of refraction but those studies had almost nothing to do with lenses. The most extensive study of refraction was by Ptolemaeus, who was concerned with atmospheric refraction in astronomy and most important failed to determine the sine law of refraction.\n\nHaving quickly rubbished Greek theories of optics without going into detail we arrive at Ibn al-Haytham (b. 965 BCE). After a biographical sketch she makes the claim that “he finally explained correctly how sight works.” Although Ibn al-Haytham made great progress towards a correct explanation of how sight works, it is by no means completely correct and above all most of the elements he uses in his model are taken from the Greek sources that she doesn’t present. She then presents one of al-Haytham’s experiments claiming that it proves his theories, which it doesn’t. We then get the extraordinary statement:\n\nIbn al-Haytham’s work related to optics was groundbreaking for many reasons. For the first time, someone suggested correctly, that light exists independently of vision.\n\nSorry, but this is pure and utter garbage!\n\nHe also said that light travels in rays along straight lines, and these rays are not modified by other rays that cross their path.\n\nThis was already known to the Greeks.\n\nFor the first time, he conducted a scientific study of images formed by lenses.\n\nIbn al-Haytham did not conduct a scientific study of images formed by lenses. He made some minor comments on the images formed by spherical lenses.\n\nWe then get the classic:\n\nIn another interesting link, physicist Jim Al-Khalili writes that Ibn al-Haytham’s discussion on perspective-which was translated into Italian in the fourteenth century-enabled Renaissance artists to create the illusion of three-dimensional depth in their work.\n\nThis illustrates a major problem in her work on al-Haytham, she uses the highly hagiographic and historically inaccurate work of Al-Khalili as her source, rather than the historically accurate, in depth studies of David C. Lindberg, A. Mark Smith, and A. I. Sabre.\n\nAs far as the development of linear perspective during the Renaissance is concerned, the geometry of linear perspective is the optical geometry of Euclid, which is in no way dependent on anything al-Haytham wrote. Of the early developers of linear perspective Lorenzo Ghiberti (1378–1455) indeed quotes al-Haytham. However, we know nothing about the sources which inspired Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) to carry out his famous demonstration of linear perspective. Finally, Mark Smith thinks that Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), who wrote and published the first explanation of linear perspective in his Della Pittura (1435)/De Pictura (1436) did not reference optical literature to write his book but that it was based on his work recording the architectural ruins in Rome using a plane table. More importantly, Alberti states clearly in his book that for linear perspective it is irrelevant whether one holds an extramission theory of optics, Euclid, or an intromission one, al-Haytham.\n\nWe then get the claim that that Ibn al-Haytham “laid the foundation of what we now describe as scientific method.” As al-Haytham’s experimental programme is an extended copy of that of Ptolemaeus’ programme this claim is simply refuted.\n\nFollowing an explanation of how lenses work, we get a horrible piece of ahistorical garbage:\n\nThe science of optics advanced significantly in the Islamic empires, but the practical applications of lenses remained largely limited to burning glasses and simple magnification. Centuries later, when the Islamic Golden Age of science [my emphasis] began to dim in the Middle East, and as light began to break through the Dark Ages in the West, [my emphasis] Europe’s Renaissance thinkers built on the work of their medieval counterparts to truly harness the superpower of lenses.\n\nThe concept of the Islamic Golden Age of science is, today, increasingly viewed with scepticism by historians as it is particularly difficult to define just when it was supposed to have ended. The term Dark Ages, however, is not just viewed with scepticism but has been totally banned from the vocabulary of serious historical discussion.\n\nHaving written this paragraph, Agrawal then dives straight into the invention of the microscope, strangely making here no mention of either the invention of eyeglasses (spectacles) or the telescope. This is particularly bizarre as a couple of pages earlier she had written, “ He [Ibn al-Haytham] laid the foundations for scientists after him – including Newton, who published his work 700 years later – to not only study and explain light even further, but also to engineer spectacles, microscopes, telescopes, cameras, and more.” Note Newton gets a name check but a whole list of other significant contributors to the history of optics, Kepler for example, don’t. Without the invention of spectacles, no industry of lens making would have developed, and without spectacles no telescope, and without the telescope no microscope!\n\nInterestingly, the earliest date for the end of the so-called Islamic Golden Age of science is the fall of Baghdad at the hand of the Mongols in 1258, which almost coincides with the invention of spectacles in Northern Italy, which by the way, was in no way connected to the optical theories of Ibn al-Haytham.\n\nWe get a few lines on Robert Hooke and his Micrographia before she writes the following:\n\nNo doubt inspired by Hooke’s work, a Dutch shopkeeper with little formal education decided to look closer, leading him to seeing many things that humans had never seen before.\n\nThe Dutch shopkeeper is, of course Antony Leeuwenhoek, who was actually quite a bit more than just a shop keeper. There is actually no evidence that Leeuwenhoek was inspired by Hooke. This is a purely speculative theory proposed by Brian J. Ford, who is the source that Agrawal uses for he comments on Leeuwenhoek.\n\nThere follows an account of Leeuwenhoek’s single lens microscopes which ends with the following:\n\nHolding the microscope up to his eye, he could peer through his handmade lenses, some of which could magnify objects by an astonishing 266 times. To put this in perspective, the microscopes with two lenses invented in the late sixteenth century by the Dutch father and son team, Hans and Zacharias Janssen[my emphasis], could only magnify up to a maximum of ten times, because of the limited quality of the lenses and blurring effects first studied by Ibn al-Haytham.\n\nThe claim that Hans and Zacharias Janssen invented the microscope in the sixteenth century was very dubious at the best when it was first presented, apart from anything else Zacharias Janssen would have been only four-years-old at the time given in the story. However, modern research by Huib Zuidervaaart, has shown that Zacharias Janssen, who is also credited with the invention of the telescope, had nothing whatsoever to do with optics before 1616.\n\nWe don’t actually know who invented the microscope but it is assumed that several early telescope makers and user, such as Galileo, looked through their Dutch or Galilean telescopes the wrong way round and realised that it functioned as a microscope. Several people in Galileo’s circle in the Accademia dei Lincei used such Galilean microscopes and it was Giovanni Faber of the Lincei, who gave the instrument its name. The first use of a Keplerian telescope, with two convex lenses, is credited to Cornelis Drebbel in 1619.\n\nWe then get an account of Leeuwenhoek’s discoveries culminating in his discovery of sperm. Agrawal writes:\n\nCombined with the theory that all female animals have eggs, which also made its appearance in the mid-1670s…\n\nThis theory originated with William Harvey in his De Generatione, Ex ovo omnia – All things come from an egg, in 1651.\n\nThe rest of the chapter deals with the development of the microscope and its use in artificial insemination followed by a long section on the history of the history of the camera, both more or less acceptable.\n\nOf course, the series of historical errors in this chapters leads on to speculate if the history in the other chapters is accurate. Unlike this chapter the others are not my speciality but as far as I could ascertain they are historically acceptable.\n\nThe book has neither foot nor endnotes. There are lists of the experts consulted for each chapter and also a separate extensive bibliography of sources for each. There is also a useful index. The book has occasional black and white illustrations many of which are had drawn, one assumes by the author. Despite my complaints about the chapter on the lens, I recommend Roma Agrawal’s book, which is despite the flaws mentioned above an excellent read.\n\n[1] Roma Agrawal, Nuts & Bolts: Seven Small Inventions That Changed the World (in a Big Way), Hodder & Stoughton, London, 2023.\n\nWilliam Gilbert’s De Magnete is a book that covers a wide range of information on all aspects of magnetism, loadstones, magnets, and the magnetic compasses. He was a high ranking physician living in London and doesn’t appear to have travelled anywhere else let along sailed anywhere on a ship. This raises the justified question; how did he acquire much of the knowledge that he presents to his readers? Did he write the book alone, or were there others involved in its production?\n\nWe know that he borrowed liberally from the works of Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt (fl. 1269), Robert Norman (dates unknown), and William Barlow (1544–1625) without really acknowledging those borrowings. We would say he plagiarised them, but what he did was common practice amongst scientific authors during the Renaissance. There were, however, other parts of the book that relied on mariner’s knowledge to which Gilbert almost certainly did not have access. He boasts of having acquired knowledge of the behaviour of the mariner’s compass over all on the globe from conversations with the circumnavigators, Francis Drake (c. 1540–1596) and Thomas Cavendish (1560–1592) but were there others?\n\nWe know according to the reports that at least one and possibly two others actually contributed text to De Magnete. Following Gilberts death, two other magnetists claimed the right to be considered his true disciple, William Barlow (1544–1625), who I dealt with in an earlier episode, and Mark Ridley (1560–c. 1624), who as I noted in an earlier episode lived in Wingfield House with Gilbert and whom I will deal with in the next post. Their rivalry developed into a mudslinging match in various publications, which I will also deal with in the next post. In one of his ripostes to Barlow, Mark Ridley wrote:\n\n[Edward Wright] was a verie skilful and painefull man in the Mathematickes, a worthy reader of that Lecture of Navigation for the East-India Company … [T]his man took great paines in the correcting the printing of Doctor Gilberts booke, and was very conversant with him, and considering of that sixt booke [of De Magnete] which you [Barlow] no way beleeve, I asked him whether it was any way of his making or assistance, for that I knew him to be most perfect in Copernicus from his youth, and he denied that he gave any aide thereunto, I replied that the 12 chapter of the 4 Booke must needs be his, because of the table of the fixed Starres, so he confessed that he was the author of that chapter, and inquiring further whether he observed the Author [Gilbert] skillfull in Copernicus, he answered that he did not, then it was found that one Doctor Gissope [Joseph Jessop] was much esteemed by him, and lodged in his house whom he knew alwaies to be a great Scholler in the Mathematick, who was a long time entertained by Sir Charles Chandish, he was a great assistance in that matter as we judged, and I have seen whole sheetes of this mans own hand writing of Demonstrations to this purpose out of Copernicus, in a book of Philosophie copied out in another hand[.]\n\nAll that I can find about Joseph Jessop, who, according to Ridley, instructed Gilbert in Copernican cosmology is that he was apparently a fellow London physician and an erstwhile fellow of King’s.\n\nIn contrast to the elusive Dr Jessop, Edward Wright (1561–1615) is one of the most prominent figures in relevant circles in the last quarter of the sixteenth century and the first quarter of the seventeenth. A leading mathematical practitioner, not just in England but in the whole of Europe, particularly in the areas of cartography and navigation. He had solved the mathematical problem of how to construct the Mercator projection and published it in one of the most important English books on navigation, his Certaine Errors in Navigation in 1599. He had made Simon Stevin’s equally important De Havenvinding (1599) available to English mariners by translating it into English and publishing it as The Hauen-finding Art, or The VVay to Find any Hauen or Place at Sea, by the Latitude and Variation also in 1599. He was the designer of important mathematical instruments, an advisor on and teacher of navigation and cartography.\n\nAs well as this supposed anonymous contribution to Gilbert’s masterpiece he is also a named contributor as the author of a so-called laudatory address at the beginning of the book or to give it its full title:\n\nTo the most learned Mr. William Gilbert, the distinguished London physician and father of the magnetic philosophy : a laudatory address concerning these books on magnetism, by Edward Wright.\n\nWright lays it on thick in his opening paragraph:\n\nShould there be any one, most worthy sir, who shall disparage these books and researchers of yours, and who shall deem these studies trifling and in no wise sufficiently worthy of a man consecrated to the graver study of medicine, of a surety he will be esteemed no common simpleton. For that the uses of the loadstone are very considerable, yea admirable, is too well known even among men of the lowest class to call for many words from me at this time or for any commendation. In truth in my opinion, there is no subject-matter of higher importance or of greater utility to the human race upon which you could have brought your philosophical talents to bear.\n\nHaving in a long passage of purple prose emphasised the importance of the invention of the compass for mariners, Wright initially concentrates on the topic of magnetic variation, seeming to believe in opposition to Gilbert that the use of variation to determine longitude is a real possibility. He then moves on to the topic of magnetic dip and the possibility that this seems to offer to determine latitude by inclement and overcast weather. Here his praise goes into overdrive:\n\nThus then, to bring our discourse back again to you, most worthy and learned Mr. Gilbert (whom I gladly acknowledge as my master in this magnetic philosophy [my emphasis]), if these books of yours on the Loadstone contained nought save this one method of finding latitude from the magnetic dip, now first published by you, even so our British mariners as well as the French, the Dutch, the Dames, whenever they have to enter the British sea or the strait of Gibraltar from the Atlantic Ocean, will justly hold them worth no small sum of gold.\n\nWith reference to the sentence in brackets that I have emphasised, it should be remembered that Wright is no humble mariner but a graduate of Cambridge University, who is a leading authority on all aspects of navigation and the magnetic compass, as well as a published author and translator, so high praise indeed. It should however be noted that the plan to determine latitude by magnetic dip propagated by Gilbert in his book and so highly praised here, by Wright, was never actually realised.\n\nWright goes on to address Gilbert’s theory of diurnal rotation and rehashes the standard physical argument in its favour, that it is more plausible to believe that the comparatively small sphere of the Earth rotates once every twenty-four hours than that the vastly larger sphere of the fixed stars does so. He considers the religious objection but finally comes down in favour of a geocentric model with diurnal rotation.\n\nTowards the end of his laudatory address Wright references two other European experts:\n\nNor is there any doubt that those most learned men, Petrus Plantius (a most diligent student not so much of geography as of magnetic observations) and Simon Stevinius, a most eminent mathematician will be not a little rejoiced when first they set eyes on these your books and therein see their own 𝜆𝜄𝜇𝜈𝜀𝜐-𝜌𝜀𝜏𝜄𝜅ή𝜈 or method of finding ports so greatly and unexpectedly enlarged and developed; and of course they will, as far as the may be able, induce all navigators among their own countrymen to note the dip no less than the variation of the needle.\n\nPetrus Plancius (1552–1622) was a Flemish astronomer, cartographer, and clergyman, who was an expert on safe maritime routes to India and the Spice Islands. He would go on to become one of the founders of the Dutch East India Company in 1602. He is famous for his celestial globes and in particular for training the navigator Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser (c. 1540–1596)to be one of the first to map the stars in the southern hemisphere. Simon Stevin is already known to us and Gilbert endorsed the scheme of Simon Stevin (1548–1620), put forward in his The Hauen-finding Art to provide tables of the correctly measured variation to compare with measured observations as an aid to navigation. It can be assumed that Wright as the translator of The Hauen-finding Art introduced Gilbert to Stevin’s work.\n\nOf interest is the following allusion:\n\nLet your magnetic Philosophy, most learned Mr. Gilbert, go forth then under the best auspices­–that work held back not for nine years only, according to Horace’s Council, but for almost another nine…\n\nCopernicus alludes to the same advice from Horace’s The Art of Poetry on the opening page of the preface to De Revolutionibus:\n\nFor he [Tiedemann Giese] repeatedly encouraged me and, sometimes adding reproaches, urgently requested me to publish this volume and finally permit it to appear after being buried among my papers and lying concealed not merely until the ninth year but by now the fourth period of nine years.\n\nTurning now to Book 4 Chapter 12 of De Magnete, which Ridley relates was authored by Wright we find a detailed technical section on the best way to determine magnetic variation, which I described in my post in this series on De Magnete so, The twelfth chapter of book four provides the best and most detailed description of how to determine variation published up till that time.\n\nThe chapter describes in great technical details the various ways of determining magnetic variation at sea and on land. It includes detailed instruction for the design and construction of special instruments for this task and outlines the mathematics necessary to carry out the calculations. It includes Tycho Brahe’s value for the deviation of the Arctic pole-star from true north, 2 deg. 55 min. but gives 3 degrees as a good approximation. It also includes a list of the right ascension and declination of bright, brilliant stars not far from the equator for determining variation at night and the construction of an instrument to do so. It closes with instructions on how to construct an instrument for finding the ortive amplitude on the horizon. For those who don’t know, the ortive amplitude is defined thus:\n\nThe arc of the horizon between the true east or west point and the centre of the sun, or a star, at its rising or setting. At the rising, the amplitude is eastern or ortive. (Wiktionary)\n\nAll the above is very much in Wright’s area of expertise rather than Gilbert’s, so the claim that he wrote this chapter is very plausible. This of course raises the question as to whether Wright was the author, or co-author of, or advisor on other sections of the book of a similar technical nature. This question could probably only be answered if we could find Gilberts working notes, draft manuscript(s), or correspondence from when he was working on the book. Unfortunately, when he died he donated his library and one assumes his papers to the College of Physicians of which he was President. I say, unfortunately, because the College of Physicians and its entire library was lost in the Great Fire of London, so we will never know if Wright contributed more to De Magnete or not.\n\nRoland Jackson is a historian of nineteenth-century science in Great Britain, who is the author of a highly praised biography of John Tyndall, The Ascent of John Tyndall: Victorian Scientist, Mountaineer, and Public Intellectual (OUP, 2018), which given the nature of some of Tyndall’s research work established Jackson as an expert on the early history of the very actual climate debate. He has, also, in this capacity published some very sensible work on the, somewhat heated, “did Tyndall steal from Eunice Newton Foote” discussion. Tyndall also features in Jackson’s newest book, albeit as just one of a cast of a multitude of expert voices, Scientific Advice to the Nineteenth-Century British State (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2023)[1].\n\nJackson’s book is a vast repository of information, detailing the interactions between experts­–scientists, engineers, medical advisers­–and politicians over an extraordinary wide range of topic, seemingly from every aspect of human activity, in Great Britain throughout the nineteenth century, cooked down to a bare minimum to fit it into its slightly more than three-hundred pages. If expanded to its fullest extent, the information packed into those pages would, with certainty, fill a multi-volume encyclopaedia. However, despite its compactness, Jackson’s tome is not dry and indigestible, but well written, highly readable, informative, lucid, at times almost lyrical and it left this reader, at least, with a strong desire to discover more in greater depth about, what seems like, a thousand different topics.\n\nIn the nineteenth century expert advisors interacted with and were consulted on a myriad of different topic by politicians, including health and safety in mines, factories, and explosive stores, public heath, the building of railways and the prevention of rail accidents, the prevention of marine disasters, the design of weapons, taxation, and much more. To handle all of these diverse topics in one continuous, chronological narrative would, I think, produce a highly complex and probably unreadable text, but Jackson approaches the task with a different strategy.\n\nHis book is divided into seven section, six of which, excluding the first, deals with an area of public political policy and in which Jackson then deals with separate and interrelated topics chronological, showing how the handling of them by politicians and their expert advisors developed throughout the century, the main divisions are–(II) Empire and War, (III) Food, (IV) Infrastructure and Transport, (V) Industry, (VI) Social Condition and Public Health, (VII) Revenue and Standards.\n\nAs already pointed out his opening section (I) is different and deals with the Rise of Science. The books opening sentences state:\n\nAny starting point for a history of scientific advice to the British state will be arbitrary. The founding in 1660 of the Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge, generally known as the Royal Society, is as good a place as any to begin. That is because this organization, surviving today as Britain’s elite scientific institution, had strong links to the state from the outset.\n\nThis is followed by a brief sketch of the evolution of science in general and the Royal Society in particular during the eighteenth century leading up to the major sea change that the Royal Society underwent in the early part of the nineteenth century and the emergence of new scientific bodies such as the British Association, the Geological Society, the Astronomical society, the Institute of Civil Engineers, and others. The medical profession had professional societies with much older roots. Jackson goes deeper into both the Royal Society and the British Association.\n\nHaving established the sources of many of the expert advisors, in particular the Royal Society, Jackson now takes us, topic for topic, through those areas where politicians called upon those advisors to dispense their wisdom to the political decision making machine, the British Parliament in Westminster. On each topic the reader gets introduced to a seemingly endless flood of committees and Royal commissions that were formed and in which selected advisors were called upon to add their opinions to the weight of the decision making process.\n\nWhat is made very obvious, particular in the first half of the century in how little influence those selected advisors had on any given issue in comparison to other political factors and how often inquiries petered out without any substantial legislation making it onto the books. It becomes very clear the parliamentarians, who themselves come almost exclusively to the upper echelons, practiced what would now be labelled a libertarian attitude to reform, propagating the view that problems such as health and safety or pollution would be regulated by the owners of the factories, railways, or whatever because it was in their own interest and didn’t need the interference of the state in their private affairs. This attitude being oft contrary to the advice given by the experts. Whilst reading, the term that kept popping up in my head was laissez faire but as Jackson did not use the term in his main text, I began to wonder if I was misinterpreting his narrative. However, in his excellent twenty-seven page Conclusion, of which more later, he uses laissez faire to describe exactly those attitudes where it had occurred to me.\n\nIt is interesting to follow how as the century advanced this laissez faire approach was gradually eroded, as it became more and more obvious that the various areas were anything but self-controlling and/or self-improving and that legislation based on the advice proffered by the experts in those committees and commissions was actually necessary. Sometimes, this recognition and the necessary implementation took a look time to finally come to fruition. Jackson drops the example of air pollution, a constant theme throughout the nineteenth century was only finally, really tackled with the Clean Air Act of 1956! Decimalisation of the British currency was discussed and recommended by the experts for much of the century, but was rejected by the politicians on the grounds that it would not be understood and thus rejected by the great unwashed, probably leading to public disturbances, it was finally introduced on 15 February 1971! Metrication was on the table from early on in the century when the need for a unified national system of weights and measures was under discussion but was initially rejected in favour of the Imperial System as being too French and too revolutionary. It continued to be discussed and recommended by the experts throughout the century but despite the 1897 Weights and Measures Act, which finally legalised the use of metric units for trade, it was first 1965 before Britain began metrication, although as Jackson points out they still have miles and the pint!\n\nSome random thoughts on the political side from the vast convolute that Jackson presents. The major influence on policies by members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords was due to personal vested interests; these launching, disrupting, blocking, or even killing of policy initiatives on a regular basis. The number of times that proposed legislations was stymied by a change of government. The constant back and forth between the government and local authorities over responsibility for areas such as sewage disposal and public health before late in the century central bodies with responsibility for the area were finally established. The highly active role of the Privy Council in the nineteenth century, then still a powerful political force, unlike today.\n\nOn the other side, within a long list of expert advisors who served on committees, gave evidence to Royal commissions, gave advice on specific problems, and were consulted on a bewildering range of topics, a small number of names, some of them well known from the history of science keep cropping up again and again asked to apply their expertise to the latest problem under discussion. One gets the feeling that figures such as Michael Faraday, George Airy, John Tyndall and Lyon Playfair must have spent their entire time rushing from one advisory meeting to another, in between doing extensive scientific research into some relevant political question or another. One aspect that I personally found fascinating was the battles between medical experts who supported the different theories of the hypothesised general causes of ill health, this being a period when the real answers were not yet know, a strong reminder how recent the discovery of the real scientific causes of disease is.\n\nThe aspect of the book that most impressed me whilst reading is how Jackson manages to juggle the streams of information that he delivers to his readers without sending their brains into overload, truly a master class in succinct formulation and delivery. I mentioned earlier that the information that he delivers is very compact and if expanded to its fullest extent, the information packed into those pages would, with certainty, fill a multi-volume encyclopaedia. Jackson did, in his original manuscript unpack and expand some examples of how the problems were approached and handled in a series of case studies. The publishers decided the book was too long and the case studies were sacrificed in the service of comparative brevity. However, these have been published separately under the title Case Studies in Scientific Advice to the Nineteenth-Century British State: A companion to Scientific Advice to the Nineteenth-Century British State (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2023), two-hundred pages of absolutely fascinating reading available in hardback and paperback at very reasonable prices (the main book is not cheap) and almost given away as a Kindle.\n\nThe book closes with a twenty-eight page Conclusion: Constraints on Influence, which summarises the entire contents of the book brilliantly and in its entirety would make for a much better review than my feeble efforts.\n\nThere are sadly no illustrations, but there are very extensive endnotes that largely refer to the impressive bibliography but also contain occasional supplementary information to specific points. As already stated the bibliography is very long and very impressive, in particular the very, very long list of Parliamentary Papers that Jackson consulted during his research. There is also a very comprehensive index.\n\nThis book is, in my opinion, destined to become a classic and an obligatory read for scholars of virtually all aspects of nineteenth-century British science, engineering, and medicine, as well as scholars of nineteenth-century British politics. It is a serious academic tome and not really designed for the casual reader, although the case studies could definitely appeal to a wider audience. However, I suspect that those scholars who do take up Jackson’s excellent tome will, like myself, find themselves going, now that is fascinating or really!, I must find out more about it.\n\n[1] Roland Jackson, Scientific Advice to the Nineteenth-Century British State, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh Pa., 2023\n\nBack in May 2023, Renaissance Mathematicus friend, Michael Barton, expert for all things Darwinian, drew our attention to a new piece of history of science hot air from the HISTSCI_HULK’s least favourite windbag, Neil deGrasse Tyson. This time it’s a clip from one of his appearances on the podcast of Joe Rogan, a marriage made in heaven; they compete to see who can produce the biggest pile of bullshit in the shortest time. NdGT is this time pontificating about Galileo and the telescope.\n\nA couple of weeks back, another Renaissance Mathematicus friend, David Hop, drew my attention once again to the same Rogan/Tyson interview, this time a longer section in which NdGT extemporises about the space telescope, Hubble, and Antoni Leeuwenhoek before he reaches the section I dissected back in May last year. As to be expected Motor-Mouth-Tyson spews out a non-stop stream of pure drivel, which truly demands the attention of the HIST_SCI HULK:\n\nNdGT: Why do you think the Hubble Telescope…the mirror issues notwithstanding, which were ultimately fixed when, it was first launched…Why was it so successful? Version of the Hubble telescope previously launched by the military, looking down. The model for that telescope had already been conceived and built and was operating. Then we said we want one of those OK but that’s not public that this is going on. The telescope gets designed has the benefit of previous versions of it having been used successfully but looking down. We look up, this the perennial two way street astronomy in the old days and in modern times astrophysics.\n\nOne doesn’t need to be a fucking rocket scientist to recognise that a military spy satellite, looking down, is technically, optically, functionally, conceptionally different to a space telescope, looking up. But is there any truth in Tyson’s stream of verbal garbage? Now neither Hulky nor I are experts on the Hubble Telescope, it wasn’t built in the seventeenth century, but Wikipedia has good articles on the history of Hubble and on the history of military spy satellites too. Tyson could have taken the time to read them before opening his mouth. But what the hell, why ruin a good story with facts? Neil, “who cares about facts”, Tyson obviously didn’t bother.\n\nTo save you having to turn to Wikipedia, a brief synopsis. We start with the military as Motor-Mouth-Tyson thinks they started the ball rolling and NASA jumped on the bus having seen that it works.\n\nThe United States Army Ballistic Missile Agency launched the first American satellite, Explorer I, for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on January 31, 1958. The information sent back from its radiation detector led to the discovery of the Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts.\n\nWikipedia\n\nNote the date!\n\nThe theoretical idea goes back a bit further:\n\nHerman Potočnik explored the idea of using orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground in his 1928 book, The Problem of Space Travel. He described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. The book described geostationary satellites (first put forward by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.\n\nWikipedia\n\nNote once again both civil and military!\n\nTurning to space telescopes and Hubble:\n\nIn 1923, Hermann Oberth—considered a father of modern rocketry, along with Robert H. Goddard and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky—published Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (“The Rocket into Planetary Space”), which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into Earth orbit by a rocket.\n\nWikipedia\n\nSo not exactly a recent idea!\n\nThe history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced to 1946, to astronomer Lyman Spitzer’s paper “Astronomical advantages of an extra-terrestrial observatory.”\n\nWikipedia\n\nNote the date, twelve years before that first military launch of a satellite looking down!\n\nSpitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope. In 1962, a report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences recommended development of a space telescope as part of the space program, and in 1965, Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.\n\nWikipedia\n\nAlso crucial was the work of Nancy Grace Roman, the “Mother of Hubble”. Well before it became an officialNASA approved, she became the program scientist, setting up the steering committee in charge of making astronomer needs feasible to implement and writing testimony to Congress throughout the 1970s to advocate continued funding of the telescope. Her work as project scientist helped set the standards for NASA’s operation of large scientific projects.\n\nSpace-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following World War II, as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in rocket technology. The first ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun was obtained in 1946, and NASA launched the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) to obtain UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra in 1962. An orbiting solar telescope was launched in 1962 by the United Kingdom as part of the Ariel programme, and in 1966 NASA launched the first Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) mission. OAO-1’s battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed by Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2(OAO-2), which carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.\n\nWikipedia\n\nI could go on, but I think that is enough to show that the Hubble Space Telescope was definitively not a case of the civil space programme copying an idea from the military space programme and that Motor-Mouth-Tyson is, as per usual, spreading high grade bovine manure.\n\nNdGT: The invention of the telescope [babble between Tyson and Rogan] Galileo perfects the telescope He learns that the telescope has just been invented in the Netherlands the Dutch were opticians, so they invented the telescope and the microscope within a couple of years of one another This transforms science.\n\nThe Dutch were opticians! So what? So were people all over Europe. Funnily enough the man credited with having invented the telescope, Hans Lipperhey, lived in Middelburg in the Netherlands but was actually a German. The invention of the telescope and/or microscope had nothing to do with nationality.\n\nRogan: Why did they invent the eyeglass the reading glass?\n\nNdGT: The reading glass was earlier than that, but I don’t know when, The real advance was putting two lenses in line with one another. Trivial in modern times but that was a huge conceptual leap and what you would accomplish [sic] and in so doing depending on how you curve them and how you grind the shape of those lenses you would get a microscope or a telescope. And we’re off to the races!\n\nIt you are going to pontificate about the history of optics and the invention of the telescope and the microscope, you really should know when eyeglasses were invented, as one of the central questions, in that history, is why did it take so long from the invention of eyeglasses, around 1260, to the invention of the telescope in 1608? The accepted thesis in answer to this question is contained in Rolf Willach’s magisterial Long Route to the Invention of the Telescope: A Life of Influence and Exile (American Philosophical Society, 2008). Willach argues convincingly that it was not putting two lenses in line with one another that led to the telescope, several people had done that without creating a telescope, but masking or stopping down the lens. The shape or form of a hand ground lens becomes more inaccurate the further one goes from the middle. These inaccuracies in the outer areas of the lens cause a distorted image, no problem in eyeglasses where one looks through the centre of the lens, but a major problem in the attempt to create a telescope. Lipperhey was probably the first to mask or stop down the lens so that only the central, correctly ground, portion of the lens gets used to create the image.\n\nI could write a whole book about Motor-Mouth-Tyson, “depending on how you curve them and how you grind the shape of those lenses you would get a microscope or a telescope.” Let’s just say an explanation it is somewhat wanting in more ways than one.\n\nNdGT: That’s basically the birth of modern science as we think of it and conduct it. Because you say to yourself, my senses I don’t trust them to be the full record of what’s going on in front of me.\n\nThat the telescope and the microscope extended human perception and added new layers of empiricism to the study of nature is beyond discussion but to call it the birth of modern science is typical Motor-Mouth-Tyson hyperbole.\n\nNdGT: You pull out a microscope, oh my gosh, Leeuwenhoek , the microscope guy, he got a drop of pond water, puts it under his microscope, just to think to do this, it’s just water, why do you think that’s something interesting to do? He said, I wonder, he was curious and puts it under and sees little, what he described as animalcules happily aswimming.\n\nRogan: Animalcules!\n\nNdGT: Animalcules, these are like the amoebas and paramecia. So, he writes to…he reports on this to the scientific authorities, and they don’t believe him. They say Van Leeuwenhoek, we think you might have had too much gin before you wrote this letter. Why would anyone believe this that there’s entire creatures, an entire universe of creatures thriving in a drop of pond water. And so, the way science works, one report does not make it true, you need verification. They sent people to the Netherlands to verify his results and there it was the birth of microscopy and then they look at everything. Cells you know, they need vocabulary to describe what you are seeing.\n\nLeeuwenhoek now gets the Motor-Mouth-Tyson stir some half facts with a portion of liquid bovine manure and splatter the result over the listener treatment. Leeuwenhoek did not put his drop of pond water under his microscope because that is not how his single lens microscopes worked. Wait a minute didn’t our narrator just explain that to make a microscope you need to put two lenses in line with one another? If you are building a compound microscope you do indeed need at least two lenses and often more, but Leeuwenhoek is famous for the fact that he used single lens microscopes of his own special design.\n\nThe small spherical lens is embedded in a metal plate and the specimen to be viewed in placed on the spike behind the lens and the whole apparatus is held up to the light. At the time Leeuwenhoek examined pond water with his microscope, microscopists were examining anything and everything with their microscopes, so nothing very special in this act. “He reports on this to the scientific authorities” sounds like something out of a dystopian novel by Kafka or Orwell. At the time he was corresponding with the Royal Society in London, basically, at the time, a private gentleman’s club for those interested in natural philosophy, who were publishing the results of Leeuwenhoek’s microscopic investigation in the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nThe letter with the animalcules, a term coined by Henry Oldenburg Secretary of the Royal Society, when translating from Leeuwenhoek’ original colloquial Dutch was sent in 1676 and was by no means his first letter.\n\n.. this was for me, among all the marvels that I have discovered in nature, the most marvellous, and I must say that, for me, up to now there has been no greater pleasure in my eye as these sights of so many thousands of living creatures in a small drop of water, moving through each other, each special creature having its special motion.\n\nLeeuwenhoeks animalcules letter to Oldenburg\n\nThe prominent Dutch physician Reinier de Graaf made Oldenburg aware of Leeuwenhoek’s investigations in a letter from 1673:\n\nThat it may be the more evident to you that the humanities and science are not yet banished among us by the clash of arms, I am writing to tell you that a certain most ingenious person here, named Leewenhoek [sic], has devised microscopes which far surpass those which we have hitherto seen, manufactured by Eustacio Divini and others. The enclosed letter from him, wherein he describes certain things which he has observed more accurately than previous authors, will afford you a sample of his work: and if it please you, and you would test the skill of this most diligent man and give him encouragement, then pray send him a letter containing your suggestions, and proposing to him more difficult problems of the same kind.\n\nOldenburg followed de Graaf’s suggestion and from then on the Royal Society regularly published Leeuwenhoek’s letters with his latest investigations until his death in 1"
