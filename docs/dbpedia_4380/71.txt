TRINITY TRINITY COLLEGE NEWSLETTER THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE TRINITY'S FUTURE? STRATEGY PLAN TO CHART THE WAY The <strong>College</strong> Council has established a Strategy Committee under the leadership of Mr Robert Clemente, a former <strong>Trinity</strong> resident, with a wide brief to consider the future of the <strong>College</strong> and make recommendations to the Council. The Committe has <strong>no</strong>w been hard at work for six months and has completed the first two phases of its operation. The aim is to lay out a blueprint for the <strong>Trinity</strong> of the future, a blueprint that will guide it into the next century. The starting point has been a detailed examination of the <strong>College</strong> as it <strong>no</strong>w is and, equally significantly, of the current perceptions held by its members and those with a vital interest in the way it functions. The first two phases have been concerned with gathering and analysing the appropriate information from Students Parents Schools The University Tutors Employers The Foundation Graduate Members The strong themes which emerge from these phases are : • the <strong>College</strong> needs to define its academic role more clearly and upgrade and update the academic side of the services it provides; • the <strong>College</strong> needs substantially to improve its accommodation for tutors; • the <strong>College</strong> needs to communicate more effectively both with the schools from which it wishes to draw its students and with the employers who will provide them with positions when they graduate; • the current balance between the academic and social elements of <strong>College</strong> life needs adjustment. The current third phase, the most crucial part of the work, as it leads directly to the formulation of the Strategy Plan, has three major themes. These are: • the academic life of the <strong>College</strong>; • the sporting, cultural and social life of the <strong>College</strong>; • the management of the <strong>College</strong>. Other task forces are in<strong>vol</strong>ved with admissions policy, buildings and facilities, the Foundation, the <strong>Trinity</strong> Education Centre, religious aspects of the <strong>College</strong> and the role of its Theological School, and "benchmarking" - comparing <strong>Trinity</strong> to other <strong>College</strong>s both in Melbourne and interstate. The Committee has been working on a comprehensive Statement of Aims of the <strong>College</strong> so that everyone associated with <strong>Trinity</strong> will k<strong>no</strong>w that we have a clear sense of direction and a clearly formed strategy for achieving our goals. Members and friends of the <strong>College</strong> should be aware <strong>no</strong>t only of the existence of the Strategy Committee but of the immense amount of work being done by Mr Clemente and virtually every one of the twenty or so Committee members. Some of these are <strong>no</strong>t only in very demanding full-time positions but, prior to this, had had <strong>no</strong> other connections with the <strong>College</strong>. Everyone who cares for the welfare of <strong>Trinity</strong> has much to be thankful for.
