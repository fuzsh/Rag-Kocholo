        "text": "Balwant Singh’s second-half double against Macau on Tuesday inspired India to their 10th win in 11 matches. The Blue Tigers maintained their top spot in Group A of the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, with three games to go.\n\nIt wasn’t easy for Stephen Constantine’s men as Macau, who had lost their last four games, sat back in their own half, waiting for the visitors to launch attacks. Jeje Lalpekhlua, who started upfront, had a couple of half-chances but could not make them count as India endured a frustrating first 45 minutes.\n\nThe closest either of the sides came to breaking the deadlock in the first half, was through Eugeneson Lyngdoh, whose long-range effort hit the crossbar. Macau did not have a single shot in the first half but were content with sitting back and defending as Constantine brought Balwant on at half-time, replacing Eugene.\n\nThe move paid immediate dividends as left-back Narayan Das swung in a cross which was headed home by the Hoshiarpur-born forward. The goal did little to change the flow of the game, though, as Macau were content with avoiding a heavy defeat. India knew that the win would mean they would be on the verge of qualification for UAE 2019.\n\nJackichand Singh and Germanpreet Singh both saw game-time as Constantine brought off Jeje Lalpekhlua and Udanta Singh, the latter being subdued throughout the game. However, it was Balwant who would wrap up the game.\n\nA long-range goal-kick by Gurpreet Sandhu created confusion in the Macau box as the Mumbai City man took advantage of the chaos to prod home his second of the night.\n\nNow on nine points, a win or even a point for India in the return fixture on October 10 will be enough to ensure qualification for the Asian Cup."
