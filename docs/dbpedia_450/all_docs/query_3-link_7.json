        "text": "Balwant Singh Rajoana\n\nis a Sikh responsible for the assassination ofPunjab CM Beant Singhon August 31, 1995.\n\nThe killing was in retaliation for the alleged human rights violations during the counter-insurgency operations carried out under the Beant Singh's government.\n\nBeant Singh was killed by Balwant Singh's associate Dilawar Singh Babbar.\n\nBalwant Singh was born in Rajoana village in Raikot (District Ludhiana) of Punjab into a traditional Sikh family. In 1986, he joined the Punjab Police.\n\nRecently, on March 23 2012, he was awarded the title of \"Living Martyr\" by Akal Takhat, the highest temporal seat of the Khalsa, though initially Rajoana refused to accept the title, but for the love and respect of Akal Takhat and the Nation,finally on March 27, 2012, Rajoana accepted the award.\n\nRajoana was sentenced to death by a special court and his execution scheduled for March 31, 2012.\n\nHowever, on March 28, 2012 India's Home Ministry stayed the execution following clemency appeals filed by the government of Punjab and protests in Punjab and by Sikh communities world wide."
