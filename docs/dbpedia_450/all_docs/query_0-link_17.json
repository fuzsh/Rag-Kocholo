        "text": "Vice President, SP(I)\n\nMr Khera is B.A (honours), J.B.T and joined the Punjab Education Department in 1957. He along with other teacher leaders founded the State Primary Teachers Association, Punjab in 1960. This organisation launched a movement for the promotion channel to the 50,000 teachers. After many struggles, spreading over 20 years Punjab Government agreed to set up a separate Directorate of Primary Education in the state. In this way, 10,000 primary teachers were promoted to the posts of Headteachers, 1500 complex head teachers and 228 Block Primary Education officers. It was a historic movement. This pattern was later on adopted by the Haryana and Himachal Pradesh Governments also.Mr. Khera also served as President of All India Primary Teachers Federation for two years.\n\nMr.Khera is an associate member of Servants Of The People’s Society, New Delhi. This society was founded by Late Lala Laj Pat Rai who is called Punjab Kesari in 1921 at Lahore and inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi Ji. This society runs many social activities and educational institutions throughout India. He is in-charge of Hoshiarpur unit in Punjab.\n\nMr.Khera started a weekly newspaper named “Hoshiarpur Times”. Which was an Urdu magazine along with freedom fighter Lala Omprakash Walia Ji. This journal was started in 1967 and was published until 2005.\n\nHe was first PIL activist who went to Punjab and Haryana High Court for undoing a damaging education order. Which increased the teacher-pupil ratio in schools. High Court cancelled the Government notification and all the schools, teachers and students were benefited from it.\n\nHe joined politics and became active in Janta Dal in 1990. He rose up to state president-ship of the party during 1996-2000. He visited the USA in government delegation to celebrate the birth anniversary of Shahid Kartar Singh Sarabha at San Francisco in 1996.\n\nIn 1996 there was an international migrants tragedy in Malta seawaters. 300 young men from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were drowned in the sea in the early hours of the 25th December. There was a huge commotion in poor parents. Mr Khera organised Malta Boat Tragedy Probe Mission and visited three times Greece, Italy and Malta and other European countries. He met the government officials and private persons and they also launched their inquires. Later on, the damaged ship and remains of the victims were found. Italian Supreme Court convicted the three main conspirators for 30 years in jail. Due to his efforts, Punjab and Haryana High Court granted death certificates to the victim families and were also given monetary relief.\n\nHe was the 1st in India who tried to bring political parties under R.T.I Act of 2005. In 2009 he petitioned Central Information Commission, New Delhi in a petition which was rejected and he again went for the review of it. Later Association of Democratic Reforms(ADR) adopted this petition. Full bench of the CIC gave a decision and brought all the parties under it. The case is now in Supreme Court.\n\nAn ex-serviceman from Kerala Mr.Kunju moved The Supreme Court in 2001 against the political parties having communal background which is explicit from their names that they are representing some religion such as Hindu Mahasabha, Muslim League, Akali Dal and such other Christian Parties. The petition was admitted. Mr Khera also intervened through his lawyer Shri Prashant Bhushan. He was constrained to note that it was very difficult to collect data from far off places like Chennai, Guwahati etc. Thus the petition lapsed. We plan to take up this again after collecting data from our party friends.\n\nIn Punjab, Mr.Khera complained to the Election Commission Of India against the Shiromani Akali Dal for having two constitutions. One for fighting Assembly and Parliamentary elections and other for S.G.P.C and D.G.P.C which manages the gurudwaras in Punjab and Delhi. E.C.I. did not intervene, then he went to Delhi High Court in 2009. The case is pending for final disposal. Mr Khera also complained against the office bearers of the S.A.D. in the local court for criminal conspiracy, fraud, forgery, etc. The Court has summoned the former Chief Minister of Punjab S. Prakash Singh Badal and his son who is president of the S.A.D. and office-bearers. Now they have gone to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.\n\nProfessor Madhu Dandwate, former Finance Minister of India and comrade Surinder Mohan Ji and other socialist leaders decided to revive the Socialist Party Of India and went to all states for mobilising cadres. Mr. Khera also joined them in this venture for 3 or 4 years. Finally, the foundation conference was held in May 2011 at Hyderabad. Mr Khera with comrades from Punjab participated in this conference. He is still active in the S.P.I."
