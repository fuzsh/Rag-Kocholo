        "text": "After the defeat of Zain Khan, the last Muhammadan Governor of Sirhind, by the joint forces of the several misldars, Sardar Gurbaksh Singh, a Sandhu jat of Kalsia (a village in Kasur Tahsil of Lahore District, now in Pakistan) of the Karora Singhia Misl, occupied a large number of villages of the Parganas of Chhachhrauli in Ambala District, Dera Bassi in Patiala District and Chirak in Faridkot District in 1763. Gurbaksh Singh named the state “Kalsia” and Chhachhrauli became its capital city. Gurbaksh Singh was not famous, but his successor and son, Jodh Singh was an able person. At that time the area of Kalsia state comprised the territory between the Yamuna and the Markanda stream. Jodh Singh captured Dera Basi from Sardar Khajan Singh and also acquired territories of Lohal and Achrak. When Maharaja Ranjit Singh attacked and occupied Naraingarh in the Shivaliks in 1807, Jodh Singh was with him. In recognition of his services, Ranjit Singh presented him territories of Badala, Kameri and Chhabbal. Jodh Singh died in Multan in 1818. After his death, his son Sobha Singh assumed charge of Kalsia state and held it until his death in 1858. Lahna Singh, his successor sided with the British in crushing the revolt of 1857.\n\nAfter 1858, a period of peace started. When Lahna Singh assumed power, the Kalsia territory was intact as a British protectorate. The state’s annual income was nearly Rs 300,000 per annum, and the population was around 62,000. After Lahna Singh, came Ranjit Singh Kalsia, then his son Ravi Sher Singh, and finally Ravi Karan Singh. Ravisher Singh in 1916 gave himself the title of ‘Raja’. The Kalsia rajas held their state until 1947, when it was merged with the Indian Union. Both Ranjit Singh Kalsia and Ravi Sher Singh built several public utility buildings, including a charity hospital and schools. Raja Ravi Sher Kalsia Hospital was inaugurated in 1910 by Lt Governor of the Punjab, Sir Luis William Daney. The old court building still exists at Chhachhrauli. The dewan of the state used to live in a impressive building known as ‘Janak Niwas’. Raja Ravi Sher Singh Kalsia was the last ruler prior to Independence,When Wright Brothers invented an aeroplane in 1903, one could hardly imagine that an Indian king will fly his own aircraft within two decades.He was the first king in India who purchased his own aircraft and flew it at a speed of 100 mph. He was a conscientious pilot. He trained himself at the National Flying Services Club at Hanworth, England. Back home, he was the first ‘royal’ to be trained by the Delhi Flying Club in 1930. It is interesting to note one of the instances when Raja Ravi Sher Singh, in response to whether he would arrive by car or by train to attend a meeting of the Chamber of Princes in New Delhi in March 1931, entered, ‘own aeroplane’ in the form that detailed his travel plan and arrangement thereof. He acquired a DH-60 M Moth, named Rio Rata plane, which he later sold to Raja Umaid Singh of Jodhpur. He indulged in his passion for flying by procuring another aircraft, a DH 80A Puss Moth, initially registered to Tata Sons, in June 1931. Unfortunately, a friend crashed and wrecked the aircraft in June 1935."
