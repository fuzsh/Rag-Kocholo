        "text": "This one actually needs no introduction. You've got to be living under a rock if you've never heard of Balwant Singh's Eating House or Balwant Singh Dhaba, like it's popularly known as among the city folk.\n\nLocated beside Gurudwara Sant Kutiya on Harish Mukherjee Road, the iconic Balwant Singh Dhaba is known for the hot kesar chai (served in a bada bhaanr if you want) and doodh-cola (a mix of milk and coca cola served chilled) that they serve in kulhads until 4 am. Besides this, they also serve the most amazing and soft Paneer Tikka - a must try while you're here. Sorry non-vegetarians! This one serves only vegetarian food but we'll still suggest that you visit this place.\n\nAnother dish we couldn't have enough of were the Chola Bhaturas - one plate will not be enough. They bhaturas are pretty big and crunchy yet soft and go amazingly well with the tangy chole. Gorge on hot and spicy aloo paranthas here for a true taste of Punjabi food. Pair it with kesar chai or a glass full of lassi and you're all set for a gastronomical journey like no other. But if it's roti-dal-sabzi that gets you going, then nothing beats Balwant's Dal Tadka and Tandoori Roti with onions on the side."
