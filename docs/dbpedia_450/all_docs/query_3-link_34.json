        "text": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) births are becoming a regular feature at the Dr. Balwant Singh Hospital. For this year alone three sets of twin babies were born through this means. In a Facebook post the hospital boasted of its latest achievement.\n\nAccording to the post, one set of the twin babies (two girls) was born in March 2015, a second set (two boys) was born in August 2015 and a third set (a boy and a girl) was born this very month.\n\nThe post concludes with a promise of “more to come soon.”\n\nIt was just about a year ago that the privately operated hospital introduced its first successful IVF operation.\n\nOn that occasion the newborn was a boy born to a couple who had been trying to conceive over an eight-year period to no avail.\n\nThe IVF procedure is performed entirely by administrator of the East Street, Georgetown hospital, Dr. Madhu Singh, an experienced Gynecologist with an impressive history, functioning in both the public and private sectors.\n\nAlthough preparations were being made since 2013, the IVF programme was officially introduced in January of 2014, Dr. Singh disclosed during a press conference last September. In explaining the intricate procedure to media operatives she informed that “This is a highly complex procedure and needs a dedicated laboratory and theatre.”\n\nAs at last September 56 patients had entered into the programme.\n\nSetting up the laboratory for the IVF attracted a cost close to US$400,000, said Dr. Singh as she alluded to the high cost of equipment and other features to facilitate the IVF procedure.\n\nIVF is the treatment needed by couples that have tried simpler methods to conceive but failed. In fact, according Dr. Singh, who required additional training as a Reproductive Medical Specialist before undertaking the procedure, IVF is a completely different field altogether from the Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nBut according to her, IVF is in fact “the only option for patients using donor sperms or donor eggs, as well as those women who have severe uterine problems or have lost their uterus to surgery and wish to have a baby.”\n\nCurrently the cost of having the programme done locally could amount to about US$8,000, which according to Dr. Singh, is due mostly to the high cost of medications.\n\n“Medications are extremely expensive…Some people may pay a little less, some people may pay a little more,” said the Gynecologist as she informed that the medications have to be tailored to individual patients.\n\nOf the patients in the local programme “not all of these have had their embryos transferred due to medical reasons, but they have been vitrified and these patients will have a remote transfer,” Dr. Singh related."
