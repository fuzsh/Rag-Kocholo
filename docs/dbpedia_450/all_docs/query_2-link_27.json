        "text": "About 1,000 people have taken part in a demonstration in Birmingham in protest at a scheduled execution in India.\n\nBalwant Singh Rajoana was due to be hanged for his part in the 1995 murder of Punjab's Chief Minister Beant Singh.\n\nThe execution has since been stayed while the country's president considers an appeal by the Punjab government.\n\nThe protest by Sikhs in Birmingham saw 200 people march to the Indian Consulate from Handsworth before being joined by about 800 other people.\n\nOne of the protesters, Kirat Raj Singh, said they had aimed to put pressure on the UK and Indian governments to stop the execution.\n\nFellow protestor Gurminderpal Samra said that despite the stay of execution, many Sikhs would not be satisfied until Rajoana was released.\n\nHe said: \"There's nothing stopping them from executing him in future. He hasn't killed anyone and he's done 17 years in prison already.\n\n\"Others have committed worse crimes, had their sentences reduced and been out in less time.\n\n\"We're calling for his full release. That way we know justice has been done.\""
