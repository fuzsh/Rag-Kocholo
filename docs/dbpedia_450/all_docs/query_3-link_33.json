        "text": "Vasudev Balwant Phadke, one of India's first revolutionaries in the independence movement, passed away on February 17, 1883.\n\nHis rebellion arguably had indirectly affected the plot of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel Anandamath (1882).\n\nadvertisement\n\nHere are some interesting facts about the father of Indian armed struggle, who breathed his last, aged 38:\n\nVasudev Balwant Phadke was born on November 4, 1845 in the Shirdhon village of Panvel Taluka, based in Raigad district in Maharashtra\n\nAs a child, he preferred learning skills like wrestling. Eventually, he moved to Pune and took a job as a clerk with the military accounts department in Pune for 15 years\n\nDuring the British Raj, Phadke was moved by the plight of the farmer community. He believed that Swaraj was the only remedy for their ills\n\nHe was the first Indian to tour for political propaganda\n\nIn 1875, he formed a revolutionary group, called Ramoshi with the help of Kolis, Bhils and Dhangars communities in Maharashtra to overthrow the British\n\nOn the night of February 20, 1879 Phadke along with his colleagues Vishnu Gadre, Gopal Sathe, Ganesh Deodhar and Gopal Hari Karve declared their 200-strong militia outside Loni, which was eight miles north of Pune. It was probably the first revolutionary army of India\n\nTo collect funds for their armed struggle and provide for famine-stricken farmers, Phadke and his men launched raids on rich English businessmen\n\nPhadke issued his famous proclamation denouncing the exploitative economic policies of the government and warned them in May, 1879. Copies of the proclamation were posted to the Governor, the collectors and other government officers, creating a sensation throughout the country\n\nPhadke became famous when he took complete control of the city of Pune for a few days, by catching the British soldiers off guard during one of his surprise attacks\n\nThree social reformers and revolutionaries, Phadke, Laxman Narhar Indapurkar and Waman Prabhakar Bhave in 1860, formed the Poona Native Institution, which later came to be known as Maharashtra Education Society\n\nLater, when the Britisher's tightened their grip he was forced to flee Maharashtra. He went to the temple of Shree Shaila Mallikarjuna, a Jyotirlinga in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh\n\nPhadke was captured in 1879 and transported to a jail in Aden, Yemen, because the British feared the Indian public's reaction to his arrest\n\nIn February 1883, he escaped jail by pulling the prison door off its hinges, but was arrested again immediately\n\nHe went on a hunger strike to death and passed away on February 17. He was 38.\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
