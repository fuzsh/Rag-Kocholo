        "text": "Investigating the Authenticity and Attributions of Works of Art believed to be by;\n\nAdolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel\n\n(1815 â 1905)\n\nGerman Realist and History Painter and Printmaker\n\nAdolph von Menzel was a German realist painter, considered to be the leading German artist of the second half of the 19th century.\n\nHis works range from vastly complex figurative groupings, usually set in period costume, to singular portraiture and studies, all executed with great detail and accuracy.\n\nNaturally, demands are high today for his fine paintings and even the lowliest of drawings and studies, which often vastly exceed their auction expectations and estimates. But as his works increase in value and they getting more and more rare, it is important to be able to distinguish between those works actually executed by an artist, compared to those either 'claiming' to be by the artist, or a work that we are told is by him and for that, you may need some help.\n\nAt this level, you have to also face quite regular deceptions. Those putting a signature on either an straightforward copy of one of his known works, usually on old paper from a book, claiming it to be a preparatory study, or faking an entire work using comfortable and regular elements entirely created to deceive. The other is to acquire an emulation or a followers work, usually of age and of the artists era and remove the signature and forge another. The most common type of art fraud we encounter and this practise has been going on for centuries!\n\n***\n\nAs an international specialist fine art consultancy, with bases in the UK and Europe to conduct our European Old and Modern master research in archive effectively in person, we have been confidentially serving both private individuals and corporate clients around the world for over 45 years. In so doing, we have been investigating both single works of art and complete collections for clients. Conducting in-depth authentication and legitimacy investigations and inquiries, as well as directing full academic and forensic investigations, with multilingual archival research, into the origins of all works of art, from different geographical regions and eras. We also scrutinize and research the provenance and ownership lineage for verification and client satisfaction.\n\nWe are able to assist and advise you in all fine art related matters, particularly issues of the authenticity and attributions of European art, including the works of Adolph von Menzel and any works of art that you need assistance and advice with.\n\nA few examples of his works and those associated with this name appear below as illustrations.\n\nNote: No inference is made, nor is it intended as to the question of legitimacy here. Moreover these are an across the board representational view of the differing types of works that are and may in the future be offered and advertised for sale at auction internationally that you could need specialist advise on..\n\nThe duration and the direction of any authenticity investigation or inquiry into an attribution of a work of art will inevitably vary from project to project. But there are clear and very well defined professional formalities, responsibilities and areas of scrutiny that we can formally assist you with, including:\n\nAuthentication: Authentification: Conducting comprehensive investigations and in depth research into a work of art, with a view to establishing a correct, complete and formally recognized certification. One absolutely upheld by the appropriate, legally acknowledged and internationally sanctioned authority, body or given expert on that artist. Directing detailed and complicated inquiries, with multilingual capability, including any international academic research and forensic applications that are required.\n\nAttribution: Identifying and confirming the identity of a previously anonymous artist, studio or workshop from which a work of art most likely originated. Including the re-examination and investigation of a previous attribution which may be incorrect, or the scrutiny of an attribution that has been formally questioned or is currently formally doubted.\n\nConfirmation: Undertaking research and investigations into the legitimacy of the provenance, history and prior ownership of a work of art and establishing its accuracy and own legitimacy.\n\nScrutiny: Examen minutieux: Identifying fake or faux works of art and forgeries, including any false supportive accompanying documentation and determining works of art which may be studio or later copies, or previously given, incorrect attributions.\n\nProsecution: Poursuite: Investigating alleged art fraud and forgery and assisting and advising those who are currently, or may be considering litigating or prosecuting the fact. This includes colleagues who are legal professionals and individual private clients.\n\nAttention: Conducting all fine art related due diligence and duty of care inquiries. Including safe prepurchase or sale related audits and assisting clients in consolidating well balanced future family distribution.\n\nAppraisal: Évaluation - Valuations and condition reports.\n\nStep one in the Art Authentication and Attribution process.\n\nThe Pre-Authentication Assessment\n\nL'Ã©valuation de prÃ©-authentification. La evaluaciÃ³n previa a la autenticaciÃ³n\n\nWe strongly advise clients before embarking on a full investigation of legitimacy or an artist or studio attribution inquiry, that it is wise to have an impartial preliminary assessment conducted first. One made to balance any issues that may be present that could make the longer term exercise unviable.\n\nThis is a professional advisory service that we provide, based upon the images you supply, the full details of work of arts acquisition, its history and provenance as is known to you, along with sight of any documentation, previous research or analysis that you may have had formerly conducted on it. You should then have a far better understanding of both the prospects or any pitfalls we might face, before making a decision.\n\nThis is a logical and cost effective professional review and advisory for which there is a modest set fee.\n\nOur FAQ section covers this in more detail, or:\n\nCONTACT US\n\nCONTACTEZ NOUS\n\nWe will respond to you promptly.\n\nABOUT A WORK OF ARTS DESCRIPTOR AND TERMINOLOGY\n\n*It is very important to clearly understand the auction terms that are commonly used in any published descriptor and to be cautious of works that may just be created in the 'manner of' the artist, or those which could be variants of the artists works of art that 'bear a signature' or monogram. In this case as if they were defining the creations of the German artist; Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel German (1815 â 1905)\n\nWhere the name, Adolph von Menzel (1815 â 1905), is given with the first name/s and surname of the artist, usually cited as, Adolph von Menzel (1815 â 1905), including his dates to be specific, then in their qualified and professional opinion, they are in no doubt. It is a genuine and authentic item and one painted by that artist. This is usually fully qualified by its inclusion in any catalogue raissone, or by the guarantee of the opinion given by appropriate and internationally recognized expert authority on the artist.\n\nWhen Adolph von Menzel (1815 â 1905), is the term used, or it is similarly defined as Attrib. to ' [abbreviated,] or AttribuÃ© Ã , or ascribed to, then in their opinion it is 'probably' a work by the artist, at least in part. But... there is no guarantee. It is only an opinion that it 'possibly' may be by the artist.\n\nBut if the term Adolph von Menzel (1815 â 1905) - circle of, entourage, or “Circle of Emil Adolph von Menzel” is specifically used, then in their opinion, it is a work only of the period of the artist, but showing their influence. Or by someone closely associated with the artist, BUT not necessarily by their pupil or student.\n\nWhen the name is given thus; Painted in the “Style of Adolph von Menzel ” or “Follower of Adolph von Menzel is used, this means that in their opinion it is a work of art executed only in the artist’s way, their 'style', but not necessarily by a pupil. Yet it may be a contemporary, or nearly a contemporary of the artist.\n\nIf the phrase in the “Manner Adolph von Menzel is used or is defined….” then in their opinion it is also only a work painted in the style of the artist, but of a later date and definitely not by the artist as named.\n\nWhen the term “After….Adolph von Menzel \"; is the term used, then in their opinion it is a copy (made at any date) of an authentic and original work by the artist. This also applies to prints made 'after' an original work of art either by the artist or another artist/ printmaker.\n\nSigned - Adolph von Menzel ; “Dated….” or “Inscribed Adolph von Menzel” Then in their opinion the work has been signed/dated/or inscribed by that specific artist. The addition of a question mark ? however, indicates a strong element of doubt.\n\nWhen the term 'Bears signature', is used or the name, Adolph von Menzel is specified followed by the words; \"With signature ….”, or “With date ….” or “With inscription….” or “Bears signature of Adolph von Menzel /date/or inscription” Then in 'their opinion,' either the signature / date / or inscription is spurious, forged or has been added by someone else other than the artist.\n\nWe can assist and advise you in all fine art related matters."
