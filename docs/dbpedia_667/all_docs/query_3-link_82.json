        "text": "Maybe in recent days we exaggerated our complaining about 2020, but we all know what a year it was, right?\n\nWe want to end this year with something much cheerful. With a ball! I know that probably most of us won't attend such a party this year. But treat it as a sweet reminder that the good times will come back one day.\n\nAdolph Menzel was fascinated with the juxtaposition of glamour and chaos, convention and formlessness. That lead him to attend Berlin’s great court balls, which he did with the utmost enthusiasm. These lively events doubled as opportunities for him to prepare sketches for later paintings—at times, Menzel could be seen perched atop a table with pad and pencil in hand, or busily sketching drawings on the back of invitations. Then he turned the sketches to the paintings in his studio. The Dinner at the Ball is the most complex of such scenes. We see the pause in the dancing when the huge crowd of people was eating, drinking, gossiping, and having fun. We can almost hear the voices and smells of the scene. The room is divided and layered by the refraction of the lights at numerous points in the mirrors and chandeliers.\n\nDailyArt family, be well! Take care of yourself today. Have a great day and evening. <3 See you tomorrow in 2021!"
