        "text": "(1815–1905). German artist Adolf von Menzel was best known in his own day as a brilliant historical painter. His patriotic works satisfied the public’s taste for propagandistic art that was fueled by Prussia’s continual expansion throughout the 19th century. In the 20th century he was chiefly acclaimed for his sensitive treatment of light and the original compositions of his small genre pictures depicting daily life.\n\nThe son of a lithographer, Adolf Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel was born on December 8, 1815, in Breslau, Prussia (now Wroclaw, Poland). In 1832 he took charge of his dead father’s workshop and, self-taught, rapidly became famous in this medium by illustrating various histories of Prussia, especially those dealing with the reign of Frederick II the Great. These were followed by illustrations for similar publications, such as a lavish edition of Frederick’s works with 200 plates (1843–49). In painting Menzel soon became famous for his glittering re-creations of such scenes as Frederick the Great’s concerts at his palace, Sanssouci, and The Ball Supper (1878), showing the court of King Wilhelm I enjoying a meal.\n\nIn later times Menzel was most admired for small paintings and drawings dating from about 1840 onward. These interior, street, and landscape scenes show a unique vision and a refined feeling for the effects of light; works such as Room with a Balcony (1845) and The Artist’s Sister in the Sitting Room (1847) foretell later developments of the Impressionist movement in France. Subjects are viewed from high or low angles, and there are departures from conventions of grouping and framing, as well as innovative views of industrial subjects, as in Rolling Mill (1875). Menzel died on February 9, 1905, in Berlin, Germany."
