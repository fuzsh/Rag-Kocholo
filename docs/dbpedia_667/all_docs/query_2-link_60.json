        "text": "Adolph Menzel was a leading German artist of the late 19th century, and a pioneer of German Realist painting. His career began shortly after taking over his late father’s lithography business as a young man; by 17, Menzel was supporting his mother and siblings. Menzel began as a highly gifted and successful draftsman, and eventually turned to oil painting later in his career. His works were acclaimed by viewers for depicting German everyday life and culture in a precise manner—sometimes as realistic as photographs. Beloved by his home country, most of Menzel’s works still remain in Germany, specifically in the museums of Berlin."
