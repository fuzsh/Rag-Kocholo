        "text": "I was very much looking forward to this one! The southern coastline of the Baltic as a whole and the Prussia-Livonia-Lithuania area specifically are regions that i find the medieval history, although sometimes obscure, so much interesting, and i think i have enough knowledge + sources to help out with – Kinda late to the party because this one Friday Mapday was my birthday, so celebrating took priority to commenting upon these maps , but i've been following the thread.\n\nI must say i'm hopeful with the stated acknowledgment that the game's portrayal of the map's region has much to improve. At first glance, i was kinda disappointed, and before adding with my own contributions, i find it fair to endorse and comment upon certain posts that i have bookmarked for such purpose:\n\nWith regards to the cultural setup:\n\n1) I'm yet another voice singing in the choir with those who think separate Silesian culture in the XIVth century makes little sense (well, unless you think it's needed for gameplay / balancing reasons). One of the things that fueled the rise of Silesian identity is different historical experience (people living there didn't have to care much about wars PLC was waging in the east/south with Muscovy/Sweden/Ottomans, same as those living in Mazovia didn't have to care much about Silesia being ravaged during 30 years war). I'm in favor of the following solution:\n\nNo Silesian culture at the start of the game.\n\nIf Poland fails to regain control over Silesia till *to be debated, but let's say mid of XVIth century* the Polish population in the parts of Silesia not controlled by Poland (either directly or through vassalage) changes culture from Polish to Silesian.\n\n2) Below is an interesting map from the historical atlas I mentioned in the previous post, showing the extent of German colonizaiton to 1333. Mayble somebody will find it useful.\n\nView attachment 1141692\n\n3) Same historical atlas - map showing languages in the PLC in the XVIth century.\n\nI can just second the opinion of those who mentioned that the Polish culture is now reaching too far east and should be made a minority culture with Ruthenian dominating in the south-east (e.g. Przemyśl, Sanok) and Lithuanian/Aukstaitian in the north-east (e.g. Suwałki).\n\nView attachment 1141706\n\nFew more points from me, this time focusing more on the political situation.\n\nCulture\n\nThere have already been some ideas presented about removing Silesian culture or splitting Polish culture. In my opinion, both options would be valid and preferable to the current situation. I am not a fan of the different levels of granularity currently presented; on one side, we have Polish culture, and on the other, we have two types of Silesian cultures (Polish and German). I am not sure if it is necessary to differentiate German Silesian as a separate culture.\n\nIf you decide to split Polish culture into multiple smaller ones, a similar split should also happen with Ruthenian culture.\n\nPolitical Situation\n\nIn the screenshot, we can see a significant conflict that seems to represent the Polish-Teutonic war started in 1327. The problem is that there was no fighting between Poland and the Teutonic Order or between Poland and Bohemia at that time, and the whole situation was much more complicated.\n\nA few points to better visualize the situation:\n\nThere were no military actions after 1332.\n\nIn 1335, in Visegrád, Poland and Bohemia signed a truce and, together with Hungary, formed an anti-Habsburg alliance. In 1336, the Polish king joined the Bohemian army in an attack against the Habsburgs.\n\nThe Duchy of Jawor should be independent. Bolko, Duke of Jawor, resisted becoming a vassal of Bohemia and was in conflict with the Bohemian king. It makes no sense for him to be at war with Poland. The Duchy should be neutral or allied with Poland at that time.\n\nThe Duchy of Płock was a vassal of Bohemia since 1329.\n\nThere were Lithuanian invasions of Mazovia in 1336 and 1337.\n\nCasimir of Poland was seeking papal support in his conflict with the Teutonic Knights and therefore avoided formal alliances with pagan Lithuania.\n\nBased on the points above, I believe that presenting the situation in 1337 as an active war is incorrect. Instead, I propose an event chain that would implement the peace resolutions from the Treaty of Kalisz (1343). This would allow the player or AI to choose between a historically more peaceful approach or to trigger another war.\n\nAdditionally, I believe something akin to historical friends from EU4 should exist between Poland and Hungary to represent the political and dynastic relations between those countries.\n\nPotential Situations in the Region\n\nI will also use this post to propose some situations that could be implemented in the region:\n\nHussite Movement and Hussite Wars: Confirmed by Johan, but I would like to mention it here since there was a possibility for Władysław Jagiełło or Vytautas to become King of Bohemia. This never happened in the end but could be a fun alternative history scenario.\n\nFall of the Golden Horde: This could represent the end of the Tatar yoke, the Lithuanian crusade against the Golden Horde, and the growth of Russian principalities.\n\nNorthern Crusade: In our history, this mostly involved the Teutonic-Lithuanian conflict, but there is the possibility for other crusades against Novgorod or Sami in some alternative version of history.\n\nNorthern War: This situation would represent a series of conflicts for control of the Baltic Sea (16th -18th century).\n\nConflict over Romania: This could represent conflicts between Poland/PLC, the Ottomans, and the Habsburgs over control of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia (16th - 17th century). It would also include the struggle for independence for all of those countries.\n\nCossack Uprising: This could represent the Khmelnytsky Uprising, with Cossacks fighting for independence and the PLC and Russia trying to subjugate them. The Ottomans and Crimeans also had significant impacts on this history.\n\nI second the opinion that the current cultural set-up in Poland makes little sense. If we're going for consistency with what was made in Western Europe (following linguistical lines), the \"Silesian\" area should be simply Polish, since we know from primary sources that the first historical references of \"Silesian\" being a separate lect date to the 16th Century, fact supported by the first Polish text ever printed being from Wrocław/Breslau (archived from the Wrocław University Library), as has been stated elsewhere – more than once – in the thread, but i don't think that any of these had actually sourced the thing. Anyway, there's a fair amount of evidence to support that the breaking up of Silesian language from Polish dates to the transition between Old Polish (10th-15th Century) to Middle Polish (16th-18th Century), so if we're taking the linguistic approach (as the unified Ruthenia blob seems to indicate), the Silesian cultural area should be Polish, with some way for it to split off by the time of the 16th century – I particularly like @Rayski 's solution, i think it could be improved to something like:\n\n- If Poland fails to regain control (it should check for HRE membership) over Silesia till a few decades into [Age of Discovery?] the Polish pops in the parts of Silesia not controlled by Poland (either directly or through vassalage) changes culture from Polish to Silesian.\n\nElsewise, if Silesian is to stand as a culture, Polish itself should be granularized into Lesser Polans, Greater Polans, and Mazovians. But then, too, this calls into scrutiny the current state of the Ruthenian culture (as @Blaktross mentioned), and that's why i don't think that the opposite \"well since Silesian is there every sub-culture should be, too!\" solution has so much merit, it solves a problem by creating a lot more. Although i have some ideas about it that i'll elaborate later in this post. German Silesian as its own culture is unnecessary and inconsistent, too, but that's part of a bigger problem that i will also tackle later in this post.\n\nI'm also seconding the political feedback from the posts i've just quoted. Just giving my two cents that the Cossack (as of, Khmelnytsky's) Uprising itself shouldn't be a situation (it can be depicted simply as a rebellion with foreign intervention in-game), but the rise of the Cossacks as an independent sociopolitical group roaming the Wild Fields should be a situation, you'd have the Nomad state(s) in one side trying to fight back their expansion (or trying to coopt them, it should be an option!), while any settled states on the other side of the border have to deal with the complex situation of them being both desired border guards vs. potential fodder for commoner unrest and independence, it would give a lot of possibilities to many different kind of players besides flavoring a region which in previous games has often been fairly dull.\n\nHi, big fan of paradox, really looking forward to this super secret game. I really wanted to help with the map of Lithuania. A question, how much time do we have to post suggestions here and for them to still be read and maybe taken into account? Would posting everything at once be better or better separate posts for different fields (culture, trade goods. locations etc..). Doing proper historical research could take a bit more time. Morever, It seems that you cannot post links with a new account since the forum thinks it is spam so had to remove any sources or links for the info gathered :[\n\nSome cities\n\nI see a lot of location borders in Lithuania proper is based on recent administrative divisions, named after current major cities in those places. This is not ideal but acceptable I guess. Though the result of this is that some very important places are missing from the map.\n\nThe first one is the city of Kernavė. It used to be the capital before Vilnius. An important seat of power and trade at that time in pagan Lithuania. One of the first proper cities in Lithuania. Currently a unesco site because of its historical significance. It was later burned down in 1390 by the teutons. I think it corresponds to southern part of ukmerge location on the map and was more important than it but should have its own location. But it was not more important than Trakai or Vilnius. Honestly the location borders there seem a bit weird. It can be hard to make them out without seeing the rivers. Kaunas and Kedainiai also seem a bit of.\n\nAnother important regional center at the time would be Kreva or Krevas. It was a major castle between Ašmena (Ashmyany in the map) and Minsk. It either in the current Ashmyany or Valozhyn location and it was definetely more important than both of them. It housed a castle made out of stone and the whole region used to be called by it. Its also where later the famous union of Kreva was signed that bound Lithuania to Poland\n\nAnother important location would be Nesvyžius (Niasviz). Its location is between kletsk and stowbtsy on the map. It became an important seat for Radvilos some very powerfull nobles in the grand duchy of Lithuania, though it happened a bit after the start date. It had an important castle that is now a unesco heritage site\n\nTrade goods\n\nIn the southern part of Utena location the is now a town called Moletai. It litterally translates to clay place. The area around it is known to have clay or sand since there are a lot of lakes there. so a clay trade good there could make sense. Not sure what kind of sources to use here to justify it.\n\nIn the north of Lithuania there is a town called Akmene it litterally translates to stone place. It is located in the Žagarė location on the map. Its one of the rare places in Lithuania where you can find limestone. Even currently they are mining it . Though not sure how much of it was exploited in the middle ages. Ading a stone good there could make sense or at least clay.\n\nSomeone also mentiones horses in Žemaitija ( Samogitia)\n\nLocations in lithuanian.\n\nSome location names translated to lithuanian correspoding to how they are on the map especially more baltic places. Not sure if they are the most representitive places for the locations, some of them were named after cities that were established in the end of the game and there could be other more representative ones. but here are how they are written in lithuanian.\n\nSuwalki - Suvalkai\n\nAugustow - Augustavas\n\nMonki - Monkos\n\nSokolka - Sokulka\n\nBialystok - Balstogė\n\nBielsk Podlaski - Bielskas\n\nhajnowka - Hainuvka\n\nVawkavysk - Valkaviskas (or Vilkuva like the river)\n\nGrodno - Gardinas\n\nNovogrudok - Naugardukas\n\nHieraniony - Geranainys\n\nAshmyany - Ašmena\n\nBraslaw - Breslauja (or just Brasla)\n\nMyadzyel - Medilas\n\nVileyka - Vileika\n\nValozhyn - Valožinas\n\nStowbtsy - Stolpcai\n\nMinsk - Minskas\n\nSmalyavichy - Smaliavičiai\n\nMemel - Klaipėda\n\nTilsit - Tilžė\n\nRagnit - Ragainė\n\nIstenburg - Įsrutis\n\nGoldap - Geldapė (or Geldupė)\n\nWehlau - Vėluva\n\nI can later do more if this is helping. names are mostly from lithuanian wikipedia and common knowledge.\n\nI pretty much agree with everything here. Looking at the map, i'm adding on the \"Some cities\" suggestions by proposing possible rearrangements for these to fit:\n\n- Many said about Ukmergė to Vilkmergė (that is also dated from the period) but considering strictly the start-date, Ukmergė location should be Kernavė, as has been mentioned, it was a considerable town (specially by lithuanian standards) while Vilkmergė then was just a wooden fort upon a hill. Kernavė was destroyed by the Teutons – Maybe if the location is occupied by an enemy before a certain point in time, there should be a chance of firing a \"Kernavė destroyed!\" event where the player chooses whether or not to rebuild it (for a price but some benefits reflecting the oldest capital's prestige?), choosing not to would change the location's name to Vilkmergė + add a defense bonus maybe? (Since now the \"location\" is more defensible). I don't think Kernavė merits adding a whole new location to the map, though.\n\n- Valozhyn was first mentioned in 1400, as a volost (district) of Grand Duke Vytautas, and would never pass the 5 thousand inhabitants threshold in the game's timeframe (it was 4,500 in 1897). In the area covered by its location resides the mentioned Kreva, or more properly, Krėva, which, as the quoted post describes in-depth, was very relevant a century into the game! For this, i find it very agreeable that the Valozhyn location should be renamed Krėva (Kreva for Ruthenian localisation, Krewo for Polish).\n\n- Nešvyzius/Niasviž is indeed between Kletsk and Stowbtsy, but i'm fairly sure the place itself is inside the Kletsk location, which causes an issue: You see, Kletsk is a very old tribal town, and its appearance is as fitting as possible here, but Stowbtsy was founded in 1593, and therefore is an anachronism. I could be wrong, and Niasviž is inside Stowbtsy location, but anyway, my proposal is that Stowbtsy should become Nešvyzius/Niasviž location, and if the borders between it and Kletsk don't fit, they should be changed in order for Nešvyzius to be properly in its own location.\n\nDzień dobry!\n\nView attachment 1142588\n\nAs a Pole, I would like to praise the fact that the cultural situation (even Rusyn is there!!!) in this region is really well presented and that the density of locations and provinces does not differ from the rest of Europe. Above I presented suggestions for new cultures and minor corrections to the area of cultural dominance. Suggests adding the following Cultures:\n\nPoland\n\nAdd Masovian and Goral cultures. Optionally, you can divide Polish culture into: Lesser-Polish and Greater-Polish - with the possibility of uniting them into Old Polish (Old Polish can combine with Masovian culture into Polish).\n\nBaltic & Lithuania\n\nDelete of the Western Baltic culture and add Sudovian and Curonian cultures. While on the subject of the Balts, I believe that it should be possible to combine Aukstaitians and Samogitians into Lithuanian culture.\n\nRuthenia\n\nSplit of the Ruthenian culture into:\n\nWhite Ruthenian\n\nRed Ruthenian\n\nKyivan Ruthenian\n\nPolesian?\n\nWhite Ruthenian and Polesian can merge into Belarusian culture. Similarly, Red Ruthenian and Kyivan Ruthenian can merge into Ukrainian culture.\n\nProvinces\n\nView attachment 1141174\n\nIt is necessary to add new provinces in Upper Silesia: Bytom, Pszczyna and Racibórz. Together with Opole, Opava and Těšín would form a new region: Upper Silesia.\n\nZielona Góra should be a new province of Lower Silesia. Together with Głogów, Legnica and Wrocław would form a Lower Silesia region.\n\nWizna should be rename into Łomża and Białystok should be renamed into Drohiczyn or Podlasie.\n\nLocations (new ones & correction of names)\n\nView attachment 1141194\n\nBrand new locations:\n\nJelenia Góra (in Silesian: Jelyńo Gůra)\n\nWałbrzych (in Silesian: Wałbrzich)\n\nTarnowskie Góry (in Silesian: Tarnowske Gůry)\n\nGliwice (in Silesian: Glywice)\n\nRacibórz (in Silesian: Racibōrz)\n\nPszczyna (in Silesian: Psczina)\n\nBielsko (in Silesian: Biylsko)\n\nOstrawa (in Silesian: Uostrawa)\n\nŁomża\n\nKolno\n\nNew locations names in Silesian and Kashubian (this is about dynamic names in these two languages - Silesian for Silesian culture and Kashubian for Kashubian culture):\n\nSilesian\n\nOpole rename into Ôpole\n\nBrieg rename into Brzyg\n\nOpava rename into Uopawa\n\nTěšín rename into Ćeszyn\n\nRacibórz rename into Kluczbork (in Silesian: Kluczborek) BTW.

Especially the new locations and, of course, the proposed Kashubian/Polabian and Silesian localisations.\n\nIf we're going the granular way towards Polish, i quite like his proposed divisions, since Masovian is the most singular of non-Silesian polish ethnographic group, but i disagree with the extent of Sudovian culture – will elaborate on that later in this post – and with the proposed divisions of Ruthenian: Red, White, Black (for the Upper Neman) Ruthenia were geographical-only terms, and shouldn't be used as a base for culture, besides, following this convention, \"Kyivan Ruthenian\" should be \"Little Ruthenian\", and the \"Polesian\" area was scarcely inhabited for obvious reasons of forest, the actual Polesian culture being a fairly recent development in history.\n\nSo, I have prepared the feedback here, but had to split it into 6 parts due to the forum limitations. You'll have the attached maps in the respective posts:\n\nI'm seconding literally everything here, this was very well-crafted feedback!\n\nPlease don't post Litvinist propaganda. Lithuania ruled the Slavs. We were dukes. Deal with it.\n\nI'm aware that the least of all things we want to endorse in a game like this is Litvinist propaganda, but i'm taking the role of devil's advocate here and say that his post is not conclusively propaganda, and i think that such interpretation may lead many to invalidate fair points raised by his post – After all, we should deal with proposals point-by-point.\n\nHe cites valuable references for the whole Ruthenian culture conundrum and germans living in Polotsk, which should be considered by the devs, besides the actual Ruthenian localisation for places being accurate. Of course, the part on slavic populations delves a lot on Litvinism, but the point that slavic inhabitants of the Grand Duchy started, with time, to call themselves \"Lithuanians\" (because they lived in Lithuania, duh) is relevant enough to merit consideration.\n\nActually, it does not concern actual feedback for the situation in 1337, but i think that any scheduled \"Ruthenian\" culture fragmentation could include the possibility of flipping in Lithuania-held lands to \"Litvin\" (i.e., \"Slavic-speaking Lithuanians\") culture in case of 1. Lithuania going the Orthodox route or 2. Lithuania converting dominant Ruthenian locations to Catholicism (or Romuva as well? It would be cool if possible). It's the kind of small-game reference that could add that plus for an ongoing game.\n\nHaving played devil's advocate for long enough, i have to say: F*** Litvinism. Ew.\n\nHoly shit thank you for those maps, they are exactly what we all needed. Those are some of the clearest maps I have seen on this topic. Could you please give me the name of this atlas, and if there are such ethnic maps for the 19th century?\n\nSo just like I said, Chełmno area and Gdansk Pomerania, even the city itself, should be mixed Polish-German instead of \"Prussian\". What I find interesting is that this atlas depicts Pomeranian and Silesian Slavic populations as straight \"Polish\" instead of separate cultures, so we have one more academic source against the culture split\n\nThe map of the end of 16th century is also very interesting. It confirms what I have said and fits with the other historical sources I have checked - by the 17th century Polish presence completely dominated in Upper Silesia and Opole Silesia, and was stubbornly sticking to the left bank Lower Silesia, including parts of Wrocław, Głogów and Zielona Góra - as well as Słupsk, Lębork, Bytów, and even Szczecinek and Walcz in the north (so even parts of West Pomerania were not yet German by the early 17th century). It also shows repolonization of Chełmno area and Kujawy (though I still suspect that it was not entirely germanized in the 14th century anyway - Teutons didn't have enough time and settlers for that.\n\nBut there is one more thing worth noting here. For huge part of my life I was led to believe that there is very little if any Polish historical heritage in Warmia-Masuria (despite being Polish myself). Imagine my shock few years ago when I read sources confirming what this map displays - that the majority Warmia-Masuria, once Baltic and conquered by Teutons, got polonised by Polish settlers in the PLC era, and huge part of it maintained Polish culture all the way till the 1945 (same as with Opole Silesia, often depicted as \"practically German since 14th century\").\n\nA lot of 19th and 20th century historiography, and popular history even to this day, unfortunately, has depicted the topic of German colonisation of the east in the colonial and orientalising manner. Poles (or Slavs) were depicted as entirely backward peasant folk, incapable of higher culture or organisation, passive against the dynamic force of German settlers immediately taking over cities and elite culture, and very quickly dominating the countryside. But the truth of Polish-German demographic dynamics in the area of modern Poland were far more complex, with centuries of waves of germanisation, polonisation, re-germanisation and re-polonisation of peasants, cities and elites. It is worth noting that EU games (with best intentions) unwittingly followed this teleological paradigm, in depicting Silesia, Pomerania and Warmia-Masuria as largely or entirely disconnected from Polish civilization and culture, and being \"some passive Slavic/Baltic people who are bound to be germanised and become loyal Prussians\".\n\nPavia has mentioned that the game is going to depict German settlers in the east. But what about Polish settlers and the potential to polonise and repolonise some areas - this is what did historically happen in Warmia-Masuria, Chełmno and Pomerania (not to mention Polish settlers in Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania, since it is more known topic). The game should allow both the \"canon\" history of rising Prussia and alt-history of Poland retaking Pomerania and Silesia - especially by 1337 AD it was yet highly possible.\n\nGeneral advice\n\nGiving the German invaders the actual Baltic Prussian name while naming the actual Prussians western Baltic does not sit right. By the way the name likely means knowledgeable or smart. Even today in lithuanian we say that someone is IšPRUSęs to mean someone is well educated. While another similiar name Pruthenian that was also used in crusader kings. You would write it as Protenai in lithuanian and likely comes from the word Protas which means mind. both names mean a similiar thing.\n\nThe germans could be called german prussian. while the original prussians baltic prussian. I would split of the Curonians (caled Kurši kuršiai in the native language).\n\nJotvingiai tribe (yatvingi), could also be split, they are ofthen mentioned as seperate in historical sources. They also inhabited lands that are for some reason polish on the map, there were basically almost no polish in lithuania before the union. There is a story about the pagan dialacts of narew that maybe shows their language. Also shows how far south they would have been present as here the town of narew is in current Poland. I would really like to make a proper suggestion for the historic ethnic border based on actual published research and maybe do it later. Depends on how much time we have to post here.\n\nLastly the Aukstatian samogitian (žemaičiai) cultures. I personally would not split them but there are definetely arguments for it to be a separate culture. My mom and dad each are from these regions. Its the same language but different dialects. Samogitia itself has different dialects and the thickest one comes from the area that was more influeced by the curonians near the sea. However, if you want to split them naming them more consistently would make more sense. I would just name them Lithuanian and Zemaitian, these are the english names. Samogitia is the weird latin name that nobody in lithuania would ever use. And the original Lithuanian tribe does come from the east and correspond to that culture on what you called aukstatian. Or even better you could also call them in the lithuanian language Lietuviai (lithuanian) and Žemaičiai (zemaitian,somogithian).\n\nLastly one could be to name them both with their other ethnic names because you wanted to say auksktaitian then it would be Aukštaičiai (high people, aukstaitian) and Žemaičiai (low people, zemaitian).\n\nHope these help.\n\nI would like to use these two quotes to start speaking on those things, first bringing out the basics: Certainly, the “Prussian” demonym being given to the Prussian Germans while the original Prussians get a generic “Western Baltic” is kinda shameful, especially because there is a way to have both – Prussian can be German, sure, but then the Old Prussians could be Pruthenian, a name that was indeed used in CK2 for the Prussia region. My main complaint about this, though, is that where there should be cultures there are not (Western Baltic is not even an accurate generalization, since the Curonians can’t be reliably said to be East or West Baltic, and actually, historically these two cultures can be argued to have been hostile to each other) and there are cultures that should be not – Prussian German, Baltic German and Silesian German should not be cultures at the start date, because besides being inaccurate, it is unhelpful for a thing that has been stated to be a goal of the game – To depict the Ostsiedlung. In 1337, as i’m sure Tinto is aware, eastern colonization was still an ongoing process, and there was nothing like an homogeneous “Prussian” or “Silesian” culture in these regions, like, the first german settlement in Prussia was made in a little more than a hundred years ago, people still associate more with their…”mother colonies” (i.e., their original homelands back in actual Germany) than with neighboring villagers – I mean, not even later on this became the truth, since in the end Prussia became home to the Low and High Prussian dialects – and it isn’t like we can’t know which cultures should be represented instead of a general “Prussian”, “Baltic German” or “Silesian German” culture, since the settlements of Germans in the East are a surprisingly (well, maybe not-surprisingly) well-recorded process. At last, “Aukstaitian” could just be generic “Lithuanian”, or “Samogitian” could be “Žemaitian” to fit with the highland endonym, but i think Samogitian/Lithuanian would be way clearer.\n\nPruthenian and Curonian (which should be dominant in Palanga location) being divided, i’d also add Yotvingian (which is synonym to Sudovian, for those who aren’t aware) as a culture, as some have suggested. It would be the best way to represent what would be future Lithuanian populations in the borders of Prussia and Poland, besides, there should be a considerable population of them – around 2-3 thousand, to be exact – in the Sambian peninsula location (i can’t quite read it), oh, i just noticed the location has just about 3 thousand people, please, this is very specific complaint, but Sambia is supposed to be one of the main centers of pre-Germanic population, and Marija Gimbutas’ The Balts give Sambians “only” around 22k people in the late 13th century after they did not join the Great Prussian Uprising, and these would be distributed mainly between two locations that as of right now in-game have a sum of a little more than half of that (while counting newcoming german populations!), looking very closely, i’d also say that the distribution of pops in Malbork locality compared to some neighboring ones is a bit jarring, but i have no actual sources for what it should be instead, so i’m taking the faith in your research here.\n\nAnyway, i dislike your distribution of “Prussian” culture, while Danzig should be the last of all places to be “Western Baltic” culture (it should be “Prussian”, i.e., germanic with a sizable “Kashubian” minority, and truly, Kashubian should be Pomeranian), it never had any Old Prussian populations at all. Germanic “Prussian” is way more monolithic in extent than it should be. Dirschau and Schwetz should be “Kashubian” majority with Germans being the (slight) majority of burgher pops, and “Western Baltic” pops should get out of here ASAP, but then, “Prussian”-dominated locations also have problems: Löbau should be not only be a “Western Baltic” slight majority, but should have more Polish pops than actual germanic ones, the peak of its colonization is yet to come (Löbau itself has received city rights less than 30 years ago at 1337), Marienwerder location should be a “Western Baltic” majority as well – pretty much only Marienwerder itself (1233, but destroyed 1243 and then rebuilt 1254) and Riesenburg (1330!!!) exist as germanic settlements of notable size – and the same applies to Osterode (which itself was an original Pruthenian settlement, and has just gained its town charter at game start), Heiligenbeil (most of the location is Natangia, which had a particularly heavy and long-lasting predominance of native balt culture – Note the 6th reference) and Mohrungen (well, it has only Mohrungen itself, but this one should be near to flipping Germanic majority because of the sparse population). I don’t understand why Samogitian culture goes across the Neman and is dominant in Memel, Tilsit and Ragnit? Tilsit was a Pruthenian (actually Skalvian, but AFAWK they’re similar enough) settlement originally, and the location should be Pruthenian dominant, the same applies to Ragnit, which would be the curious case of having a negligible population of germans – This case applies to some “Western Baltic” locations with “Prussian” map-showing majorities: Rastenburg (established as a settlement just 8 years ago at game-start), Angerburg (which has evidence for “Western Baltic” noble pops!, in German), Johannisburg (the district castle does not even exist yet in 1337), Ortelsburg – which should be Ortulfsburg – is simply a Pruthenian settlement until the 1350s, Goldap doesn’t exist until 1570 and was the site of many native hillforts plus the location should be named Tammow or Tammowischken (after the settlement and commandery-seat that would be founded at 1370) and, at last, Memel should be german-majority, its colonization was rather early (town founded in 1258) plus the rare case of being non-interrupted, no sackings, no depopulations, success [Note: The minority in Memel shouldn’t be Pruthenians, but Curonians]. I will end this part of the rant by linking some more general sources, which give more fundament to what i just said: Sword, Cross, and Plow vs. Pickaxe and Coin: A Comparison of the Medieval German Settlement of Prussia and Transylvania, A Promised Wilderness: Colonial Encounters and Landscape in the Late Medieval Baltic (I love this book!) and The Clash of Cultures on the\n\nMedieval Baltic Frontier.\n\nSince parsing through my resources is hell, i’ll just get ahead of myself and link similar sources on the following subject of ranting, examples of colonial-settlement behavior and Teutonic land-colonisation patterns from The History of the Village of Tiegenhagen (Prussia) and i find it fair to recommend The relations of the Teutonic Order in Prussia with the local nobility in the 13th-early 16th century. Scope of issues, research state and research perspectives. This is because i’m currently writing this with 17 tabs on Chrome, and i’d rather enjoy deleting some of them, lol.\n\nThe last part of the rant is only for me to elaborate on the claim that Prussian, Silesian German and Baltic German shouldn’t be cultures at game-start, and that we can very well track which pops of which cultures should be in which places from the Ostsiedlung, let me start with the easiest of them: Baltic German. It is the easiest because the density of settlements is far smaller and there are no locations where it is dominant. Riga, Windau and Goldingen and pretty much all the Livonian towns were settled by Westphalians or other Saxons (from “other” the main figure being settlers from Lubeck), the only main exception being Talinn/Reval (initially settled by Gotlanders). It is as easy as making every Baltic German pop a mix of Westphalian and, uh, i don’t know which culture will be Lubeck’s, but should be there too, with Riga, e.g., having a wholly Westphalian German population, from head i can only recall Hapsal in Estonia as a settlement founded by Lubeckers (and it’s also the main center of Estonian Swedes, which also inhabit the island of Ruhnu at game-start).\n\nSilesian German follows a similar footprint, the only location in-map where it is dominant, Luban/Lauban, should be a mix of a majority Low Franconian (specifically Flemish IRL) burgher class and Central German (or whatever culture Upper Saxony/Thuringia gets) commoners, but by now the Flemish burghers might already have assimilated to their surroundings, so probably all germanic pops should be an extension of the Upper Saxony sphere, for the case of “Silesian Germans”, they should pretty much be interchangeable with their Upper Saxon counterparts by game-start. I’ll make the assumption that Dresden will have a specific culture dominant on it, that will be basically “Upper Saxon”, “Central German” or something, take that, Dresden was an originally Sorbian town, which was settled by Germans at the latest in 1216, the german mining town of Goldberg was founded in 1211 by the same people, nothing dramatic has happened yet, why should they be different in 1337? Silesian Germans don’t even get to call themselves Silesian (in the same way Transylvanian Saxons never called themselves Magyars) yet.\n\nFor “Prussian”, it’s weirder because the settlement pattern was much more varied, there is a reason we got two separate german dialects down the line in Prussia. But i think it’s fairly trackeable as well – After the Danzig area was captured, the Vistula became prime real estate for settlement, and we know most of these were Westphalians, it helps that concentration was a thing, so to extrapolate from the main settlements is accurate enough:\n\n- Danzig: The Old Town (Altstadt) was settled by craftsmen from Westphalia and (“some from”) Lübeck, and of course the native pomeranians, the later-established Rechtstadt and Jungstadt seem to be settled by Westphalians.\n\n- Elbing: Settled mainly from Lübeck, through and through.\n\n- Marienburg: Sourcing on origin of settlers is poor, but most likely Westphalians.\n\n- Kulm: Settled by germans from Silesia and apparently many Eastphalians (Magdeburg).\n\n- Thorn: Saxons and Eastphalians.\n\n- Memel: It has a specific mother-city, Dortmund (and was nearly named Neu-Dortmund for it).\n\n- Konigsberg: The Alstadt has many contributors (“Most of the newcomers were from Lübeck, Lower Saxony, and Westphalia, with others arriving from Pomerania, Mecklenburg, the Elbe basin, Silesia, and western Prussia. The majority of burghers spoke Low German [...]”), Löbenicht is unknown but recently-built-up Kneiphof certainly included Dutch settlers.\n\n- Allenstein: Settled not only by Westphalian (from the County of the Mark, specifically) and Silesian (from Breslau) Germans, but by (i assume Mazovian? Since it was fairly common) poles as well! As has been stated, the Masurian region had a fair amount of Teutonic-supported polish settlement. The Silesians probably were the more numerous, since it became part of the “Breslauich” High Prussian dialect area, most of Bishopland Warmia was settled by Central (Thuringia, Upper Saxony and Silesia) Germans.\n\n- Osterode: As its name indicates, settlers from Osterode am Harz (Lower Saxony) ft. Poles from Mazovia.\n\n- Mohrungen: Thuringians, as attested by the homonym quarter of Sangerhausen.\n\nThese are only a few examples of how impressive the depiction of german eastern colonisation (and the demographic after-effects in local cultures like Polish, Lithuanian, etc.) could be. It might come as a bit demanding, since well, it’s indeed a lot of nuance, but i think it would be so, so cool if the player could actually see and influence the actual development of these patchworks of disparate settlements into its own regional culture, instead of from the get-go having an inaccurate showing of a culture that hasn’t been even nearing existence. Besides, it’s almost free flavor for any Prussia/Silesia/Livonia game, it could serve as a cooperative for the trade mechanics (Settlers from a place would be inclined to trade with their home-locations) and i even would extend its potential to things like the existent (and still settling!) populations of Germans in Hungary and Eastern Europe (Galicia already has quite the lot of them, if you aren’t aware).\n\nAnd…I think rant over, hope this gets somewhere something being done, thanks for those who have read this all and if any dev sees this, i’m still hyped about the secret game! Specially about the part of it being secret!"
