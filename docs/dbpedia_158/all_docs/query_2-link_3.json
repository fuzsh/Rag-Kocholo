        "text": "PURCHASE RULES applicable to the eBilet ticket distribution system effective from 17 April 2024\n\nGENERAL\n\nThese Purchase Rules apply to the sale of tickets and products in the eBilet system, provided that the regulations of organizers (hereinafter \"Organizers' Regulations\") of particular art events (including theatrical plays, concerts and other events) or direct vendors (hereinafter “Organizers”) may impose upon purchasers certain additional obligations which are not specified in these Purchase Rules. Each Client, at the latest at the moment of expressing his will to be bound with eBilet by an online service agreement and with the Organizer by an agreement to participate in the event - in both cases concluded remotely, has the possibility of reviewing and accepting these Purchase Rules and the Organizer's Regulations and is informed of his rights and obligations.\n\nWhen executing transactions at eBilet.pl, Client may execute a ticket purchase agreement and an additional product purchase agreement.\n\nThe sale of tickets and products in the eBilet system is conducted through:\n\neBilet Polska sp. z o. o. (hereinafter referred to as “eBilet” or “The Company”).\n\nRegistered office address: ul. Żelazna 51/53, 00-841 Warszawa\n\nPhone Service: +48 (22) 122 80 99, e-mail address: kontakt@ebilet.pl.\n\nNIP: 951 237 67 01.\n\nThe Company is registered in the Register of Entrepreneurs of the National Court Register, under number KRS 0000496514.\n\nReservations and inquiries concerning orders: contact form. In order to improve service, please fill out the form, because using it ensures the completeness of the information needed to handle the application, and the information from the e-mail may be incomplete, which will prevent or significantly hinder service.\n\nDetails of the Organizer of the event are indicated in the description of the event on www.ebilet.pl. Unless otherwise indicated in the information on www.ebilet.pl, the Organizer is an entrepreneur and the organization of the event is within the scope of its business activity.\n\nUnless other details of the Organizer are indicated in the correspondence with the Client, the above eBilet details are also the contact details of the Organizer, and eBilet is authorized to perform actions on behalf of the Organizer related to the conclusion and execution of the event participation agreement concluded between the Client and the Organizer.\n\nPROCEDURE FOR EXECUTING AGREEMENTS AND MAKING PURCHASES\n\nTickets are sold in the eBilet distribution system via the website of ebilet.pl, and stationary outlets of our partners. It is also possible to purchase tickets through our affiliates.\n\nTickets purchased at a ticket sales point are deemed sold upon payment therefor at the stationary outlet operator’s cash desk.\n\nWhen ordering tickets and making payments therefor, the Client is obliged to exercise due diligence. If the Client enters incorrect data, i.e. the amount to be transferred, the reservation number or the payment code or the payer’s data which makes it impossible to identify the Client, the payment may be refused and the transaction may be cancelled.\n\nDuring the transaction of purchasing tickets by the Client, eBilet acts as an intermediary between the Organizer of the event and the Client. eBilet is responsible for providing the entrance ticket to the event. The organizer is obliged to allow the ticket holder to participate in the event.\n\nThese regulations also apply to purchase of products available at eBilet.pl. A product available at eBilet.pl should be understood as each movable being the subject of a sale agreement between eBilet and the Client (“Product”). A ticket is not a Product. Subject to the exclusions set out in these regulations, the provisions of these regulations concerning the sale of tickets shall apply to the purchase of Products, in particular the procedure for execution of agreements, methods and dates of payment and delivery methods.\n\n2.1. Purchase of tickets through the eBilet.pl online distribution system\n\nAfter you choose an event from the eBilet offer and the category and type of tickets, and after you mark the seats on the seating plan of the theater in which the event takes place (in the case of events for which numbered seats are available) or after you select the quantity of unnumbered spaces / packages (in the case of events for which unnumbered spaces are available), you should fill out the personal data form and select the method of payment and the ticket delivery option.\n\nIf the Client chooses to pay by a conventional bank transfer, by clicking “confirm and pay”, the Client expresses his will to be bound by an online service agreement and books the ticket for the event he selected. By clicking the \"Confirm and Pay\" button you place an order with the obligation to pay and confirm your purchase at www.ebilet.pl. Subsequently, an initial ticket booking confirmation is sent to the email address provided by the Client in the reservation process. After the transfer is made in line with the instruction which is included in the initial booking confirmation and after the funds are credited to eBilet’s account, the Client receives an email thanking him for payment and confirming that the payment has been recorded in the eBilet system, and, if a ticket to be printed at home has been chosen – an electronic ticket in the form of a link or attachment to an email. If delivery by courier or to parcel locker is chosen, tickets will be sent to the address specified while placing the order.\n\nIf the Client chooses to pay by online transfer through PayU S.A., eCard S.A. or PayPro S.A., by clicking “confirm and pay”, the Client expresses his will be bound by an online service agreement and books the ticket for the event he selected. By clicking the \"Confirm and Pay\" button you place an order with the obligation to pay and confirm your purchase at www.ebilet.pl. Subsequently, the Client is redirected to the website of PayU S.A., eCard S.A. or PayPro S.A. After eBilet receives from PayU S.A., Card S.A. or PayPro S.A. information that payment has been made by the Client, the Client receives a ticket booking confirmation sent to the email address provided by the Client in the reservation process, and, if a ticket to be printed at home has been chosen – an electronic ticket in the form of a link or attachment to an email. If delivery by courier or to parcel locker is chosen, tickets will be sent to the address specified while placing the order.\n\nA reservation is binding upon eBilet and the Organizer of an art event only upon sending the confirmation of payment registration in the eBilet system to the Client’s email address provided during the reservation process.\n\nIf payment for the ticket is made by a bank transfer, the confirmation of payment registration in the eBilet system is sent to the Client after payment and verification of the letter code or the reservation number received at the end of the ticket booking process and referred to by the Client at payment.\n\nIf payment for the ticket is made by online transfer or payment card through PayU S.A., eCard S.A. or PayPro S.A., the confirmation of payment registration in the eBilet system is sent to the Client after eBilet receives from or PayU S.A., eCard S.A. or PayPro S.A. confirmation of payment made by the Client.\n\nIn case you have any doubts as to the correctness of the booking process, please contact the Client Service Department via: contact form or by phone at +48 (22) 122 80 99.\n\nIt is not allowed to use bots or other automation tools enabling purchases of tickets without Client involvement. We reserve the right to cancel the tickets purchased using banned tools.\n\n2.2. Group orders\n\nGroup orders (reservations of tickets for groups of more than 10 people) are executed by the Client Service Department. In order to place a group order, please contact us via contact form or by telephone at +48 (22) 122 80 99.\n\nTICKETS AND VOUCHERS\n\n3.1. General\n\nA ticket constitutes a document authorizing its holder to participate in the event for which it was issued. The purchase of a ticket means the acceptance of the regulations concerning the participation in the event. A single ticket authorizes one person to use it. Depending on the type of event the ticket may constitute either a personal or bearer ticket. A personal ticket may only be used by the person whose name and surname is indicated on the ticket. Admissibility and procedure for changing the data on a registered ticket, including the necessity to pay a fee for the change of the data and its amount, is specified by the Organizer in the Organizer’s Regulations.\n\nThe ticket is verified upon entry to the event; it is not possible to use the ticket again. Tickets cannot be photocopied, scanned or otherwise duplicated; if any such action is detected, the ticket becomes invalid.\n\nThe Client should keep tickets in a safe place. eBilet is not responsible for any lost or stolen tickets. Please note than any direct exposure to sun-rays or heat may damage tickets.\n\nDuplicates of tickets are only issued if the Organizer of the event provides for such a possibility. Issuance of duplicates may involve the necessity to pay a fee of PLN 20 for issuing a duplicate (increased by the postage costs).\n\nThe Client has the right to verify the compliance of the ticket with the order placed by him. If the ticket is inconsistent with the order, the Client is obliged to immediately notify eBilet thereof since any mistakes on the tickets may cause a refusal of admittance to and participation in the event.\n\nIf the Ticket is defaced, it may become impossible to verify the code and – consequently – admittance to the event may be refused.\n\nThe ticket authorizes its holder to participate in an event at the place indicated on the ticket.\n\neBilet reserves the right to introduce quantitative restrictions applicable to the purchase of tickets for certain events by one individual. Such quantity is specified by the Organizer and is verified upon execution of each transaction. The policy is intended to eliminate unfair practices in respect of purchasing tickets. The restriction pertaining to the maximum number of tickets may apply to a person or a payment card. The foregoing restriction cannot be bypassed through additional accounts created by one Client. We reserve the right to cancel Tickets purchased above such limit. Tickets may be sold subject to certain restrictions on entry or use, such as restricted, obscured or side view or minimum age of participants. All such reservations will be displayed on our website and you will be otherwise notified thereof before or upon booking the tickets.\n\nPurchasing tickets for art, entertainment or sports events in order to resell them for a profit or their sale for a profit is contrary to law and constitutes an offence under art. 133 of the Act of May 20, 1971 the Code of Petty Offences. Further, the Organizers may prohibit the resale or transfer of Tickets for particular events.\n\nTickets may not be combined with any hotel, tourist or accommodation services and/or any goods, products or services to create a package, unless eBilet or the Organizer grants a formal written consent.\n\nDecisions to cancel any events, refund money in connection with any cancelled events, replace a ticket, refuse to admit anyone to an event, ask anyone to leave the event, change the event program, or change the seat of the ticket holder are taken by the Organizer on the terms and conditions set out in the regulations concerning the event.\n\n3.2. Prices and price categories\n\nDepending on the event, tickets available in the eBilet distribution system represent different price categories. In case of certain events, reduced-rate tickets and special packages, e.g. 3+1 (i.e. buy four tickets, pay for three), are also available. Such tickets are made available for a given event upon decision of the event Organizer. The Organizer decides about ticket prices. eBilet only acts as an intermediary in their sale. The Organizer decides about pricing of particular seats within specific price categories.\n\nThe seating plan displayed in the eBilet system is for information purposes only. Detailed information about the conditions of the event venue, including the view from particular seats, is provided by the Organizer and in the event of any doubts the Client should ask the Organizer for information in this respect. eBilet does not have any information regarding the foregoing and therefore it is not responsible for any inconveniences for the Client arising from the specific features of the seat chosen by the Client.\n\nIf the Client wishes to submit a complaint in connection with any inconveniences (e.g. poor visibility as a result of the placement of TV cameras), eBilet may in case of certain events intermediate in the complaint process (if the Client approaches eBilet staff members present at the event venue). However, eBilet is only an intermediary, and the entity obligated to review the complaint is the Organizer of a given event.\n\nDuring the sale of tickets within the eBilet distribution system, the pool of tickets may be increased (new tickets available for sale may be added) or reduced. Accordingly, Clients are recommended to review eBilet’s current offer.\n\nTicket prices may change during the sale process. Therefore, if any reservation of Tickets made through the eBilet distribution system is cancelled, e.g. due to the fact that the Client has made the payment due for the Tickets after the deadline or the payment for the Ticket has not been confirmed on time by the electronic payment system, eBilet will not be liable towards the Client for the lack of possibility of purchasing Tickets at the initial price chosen by the Client (in particular, if the price of the Tickets for a given show grows in the meantime or only more expensive Tickets remain in the eBilet’s pool).\n\neBilet takes efforts to ensure that the prices of tickets available for our Clients are not different than the prices at which tickets are available at the Organizer’s. However, due to the fact that eBilet bears the costs of operation of the electronic ticket booking system, the prices of tickets in the eBilet distribution system and its ticket sales points may be higher than the prices at the Organizers’. Such surcharges are intended to cover the distribution system operating costs. The non-consent to any surcharge on top of the Organizer’s initial ticket price, expressed after payment for the reservation is made, does not given grounds for any complaint or cancellation of the reservation.\n\nThe ticket prices for particular events may be increased by additional charges (in particular, a service charge expressed as a percentage of the total ticket purchase price or fees imposed by the Organizer of the event). The Client will be informed about the amount of the additional charges and the total purchase price prior to the purchase of a ticket for an event.\n\n3.3. Collector tickets\n\nFor certain events eBilet offers special “collector tickets”. Collector tickets have a unique full-color artwork and are issued in limited numbers. They are only available at www.ebilet.pl. If any collector tickets are ordered, they may be delivered to a parcel locker or by courier. The fee for collector tickets, depending on the event, may be added to the ticket price or be collected upon purchase of the ticket, provided that the Client will be informed about the amount of the additional fee in the order form prior to making the reservation.\n\n3.4. Tickets for people with disabilities\n\neBilet’s offer also includes tickets for people with disabilities. Seats for people with disabilities are allocated by the Organizer. Such tickets may be purchased by contacting us using contact form or by phone at +48 (22) 122 80 99.\n\n3.5. Discount codes\n\nWithin the eBilet ticket distribution system certain discount codes with specific face values are available. Discount codes reduce the gross price of each ticket or the gross price of the entire order by the discounts they indicate. Depending on a particular case or event to which discount codes apply, the maximum number of tickets to which discount codes may be applied is specified. Discount codes may apply throughout the sale period or only on indicated days. They may apply to a group of events or a single event. Codes constitute a combination of letters or letters and figures. The Organizer of an event always decides about introducing discount codes and the conditions thereof. Discount codes may be published through all communication means, including the media, social media, newsletters, at www.ebilet.pl or through the Organizer (and may be generally available or addressed to a selected group of people).\n\n3.6. eBilet vouchers\n\nThe eBilet system also offers eBilet Vouchers which may subsequently be exchanged into tickets for selected events from among our proposals at our website. Detailed rules for the use of the Voucher are specified in the Regulations for the sale and use of Vouchers.\n\nDELIVERY AND COLLECTION OF TICKETS\n\n4.1. General\n\nThe following delivery and collection options are available in respect of tickets sold within the eBilet distribution system: home ticket, delivery by domestic courier service, delivery by international courier service, collection at the parcel locker and personal collection at the event venue. Not all of the above-mentioned collection and delivery methods may be available in respect of a particular event. The Client is informed about the available collection and delivery options and the amount of the fee for delivery upon reservation of tickets at the latest.\n\n4.2. Home ticket\n\nIn case of reservation with the option: “home ticket”, after payment is made for the reservation, the Client collects in an electronic format which may be printed out by the Client. A single home ticket authorizes one person to be admitted to an event. eBilet does not bear liability for any consequences of unauthorized duplication of a home ticket once received by the person making the reservation or any third parties to whom the person making reservation made available the data of the home ticket received (including the printout or electronic copy). eBilet shall not be liable for any consequences of the Client indicating incorrect e-mail address to which home tickets are to be sent when making a reservation.\n\n4.3. Delivery by courier service and to parcel locker\n\nTickets are sent in the order of events (tickets for events that will occur soonest have priority). The maximum ticket delivery time is 30 days when purchasing tickets for the events that are taking place in Poland and 60 days when purchasing tickets for the events that are taking place outside Poland (if the Client indicates a correct address). If the Client indicates an incomplete or incorrect mailing address, the delivery may take longer or may not be completed due to the Client’s fault. Please make sure that you indicate correct and complete data and insert it in the relevant places on the form. In the event of any doubts as to the correctness of the data, please contact us by telephone or via contact form. eBilet does not bear any liability for the address for delivery of tickets incorrectly indicated by the Client.

If a special ticket is purchased, the delivery time should be increased by the time of production of a special ticket.\n\nPAYMENT METHOD AND DEADLINE\n\n5.1. General\n\nDepending on the sales channel and the Organizer’s decision, the following payment methods are available: online transfer, conventional transfer, payment card, BLIK, , electronic wallets, payment by cash, deferred payments and payment in installments.
