Thanks!\n\nExcluding uninhabited subdivisions (Jan Mayen) and Vatican City, as it didn't have any official subdivisions\n\nSince there really aren't any sources for Iceland's municipalities (and because there's too many of them), I went with the constituencies instead\n\nIncluding the one de facto state of West Germany"
