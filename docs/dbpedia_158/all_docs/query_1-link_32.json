        "text": "Program Educator, University of California San Diego (USCD)\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nOver the course of Christian Bey’s undergraduate career at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), he developed a keen interest in sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) care and prevention as part of his pursuit of education and training in emergency medical services. Christian began his EMT training in the summer of 2017 alongside many of his colleagues and was eager to find a position thereafter. However, upon completion of his training, he realized he wanted to do more than work as an EMT. He became aware of the educational and outreach aspects of EMS operations and began to appreciate their relevance to patient care and survival outcome in many areas, most notably CPR. Instead of applying for transport jobs during the fall quarter like the rest of his EMT class cohort, Christian began to discover how he could use his EMT training to support SCA outreach and education on the UCSD campus.\n\nBy 2018, Christian’s team had formally taught dozens of students hands-only sidewalk CPR events. He then began to create other educational workshops based on clinical EMT skills. Concurrently, he spearheaded a related, on-going project with UCSD to create a student-run EMS system that used student EMTs to respond to medical calls and staff events on campus. Throughout the development phases of the EMS system, he became familiar with SCA prevention and outcome activities by the Emergency Management Division of UCSD and San Diego Project Heartbeat.\n\nChristian further began to realize that one of the most important aspects besides proper technique is early recognition and intervention. By teaching CPR to staff and students Christian wanted to ensure more individuals were prepared to recognize the signs of early cardiac arrest and, most importantly, understood the impact that the timing and quality of their care would have on patients’ survival outcomes.\n\nThe students, medical professionals, and most notably, cardiac arrest survivors whom he has encountered have reaffirmed his belief in the efficacy in SCA prevention programs and his desire to pursue medicine as a career path. Christian looks forward to continuing to teach CPR classes for EMS as a graduate student at UCSD. He is eager to remain a leader and innovator of EMS at UCSD’s initiatives in SCA management and prevention and continue to grow alongside the university and its surrounding community.\n\nOrange, California\n\nNovember 9, 2017 was like any other day for Jennifer Hayes. She was 30 weeks into a perfect pregnancy with her second son. Then that evening, after putting their 3 year old son to bed, she collapsed at the foot of his bed and became the victim of a sudden cardiac arrest. Her husband Kyle heard her fall and rushed to check on her. He found her face down, unresponsive, having a seizure.\n\nKnowing he had to act quickly for the sake of her life and that of their unborn son, he immediately called 911 and was instructed by the dispatcher to start CPR. In that moment, he recalled their neighbor Russ, a police officer, was home. Kyle immediately ran across the street and pounded on Russ’ door. Not waiting for an answer, Kyle rushed back home and began CPR, with guidance from the dispatcher. Meanwhile, Russ was perplexed by the panicked knock on his door and the fact that no one was standing there when he answered. He quickly noticed the Hays’ front door was open and entered the home to check on them. Immediately, he was summoned upstairs and took over CPR until EMS arrived.\n\nUpon EMS arrival, Jennifer was in ventricular fibrillation and received two shocks from the defibrillator, code medications, and was intubated. A CPR feedback device was used by the responding team to ensure high quality compressions were performed throughout the resuscitation. In total, she received over 15 minutes of CPR, was taken to a local hospital, then subsequently airlifted to a higher level of care. Their son Micah Hayes was born nearly seven hours later by emergency C-section at 30 weeks. Following the C-section, targeted temperature management was initiated. Jennifer was discharged eight days after her cardiac arrest, only suffering some weakness and short term memory loss. Micah spent 71 days in the NICU before being discharged home. Thanks to the quick actions of her husband calling 911, eliciting help, and starting CPR, both Micah and Jennifer made full recoveries with no deficits. She has since returned to my her job as the Resuscitation Coordinator at the local Children’s Hospital.\n\nFor years, she has had a passion to improve CPR quality and cardiac arrest outcomes and now as a survivor, that passion is deeper than ever. Jennifer hope to use her families story of survival to empower many bystanders to learn and perform CPR, communities to become heart safe, and first responders and hospitals to develop programs that promote high quality resuscitation. In their case, CPR didn’t just save one life, it saved two.\n\nNovember 9, 2017 was like any other day for Jennifer Hayes. She was 30 weeks into a perfect pregnancy with her second son.

Together, these Wiggly friends performed more than 6,000 concerts together all over the world. They have performed to more than 3 million paying customers, sold more than 24 million DVD’s, and sold out the theatre at Madison Square Garden 13 times in one week!\n\nHowever, Greg is now possibly best known as The Wiggle who had a cardiac arrest on stage – and survived. After having left the group back in 2006 due to ill-health (nothing to do with his recent cardiac arrest), he had been out of the group for a long time – but the generation of fans that grew up with Page and the rest of the originals, are now in their late 20’s to early thirty’s, and that means the mix of Original Wiggles songs and a pub-rock environment is ripe for lots of innocent fun!\n\nBut that fun turned to near death for Greg when at the end of the most recent performance by the group, raising funds for bushfire relief, one of his arteries blocked 100% and caused a sudden cardiac arrest. If not for the quick thinking and life-saving skills of bystanders, chances are Greg would have died. His life was saved because of CPR and an AED at Castle Hill RSL Club that was brought to the stage and used to revert his heart to a normal rhythm in time for paramedics to arrive and stabilize him until he received life-saving surgery.\n\nUpon waking up in recovery, Greg was told that his chances of surviving that type of cardiac arrest were only 1 in 10. That means he had a 90% of not making it that night. This rocked Greg. The fact that 90% of people who have a sudden cardiac arrest out of hospital do not survive, was a hard-hitting stat that he couldn’t ignore.\n\nAnd so, now on a mission, Greg’s purpose is to educate others about the importance of knowing CPR, and making AED’s more available in public places and in homes – but not only that, making sure that people know where to find an AED, by introducing a new initiative called “Heart of the Nation” which is a “badge of honor” like the Australian Made Campaign, which businesses everywhere can place on their entry doors, letting the community know that they have an AED inside if it is ever needed to save a life, just as Greg’s was.\n\nEMS Medical Director, State of Alaska\n\nAnchorage, Alaska\n\nMichael Levy, MD, FACEP, FACP, FAEMS, is an EMS physician and emergency medicine physician practicing in Anchorage, Alaska with a specific practice focus on improving community outcomes in life-threatening time-critical emergencies. He has practiced emergency medicine for over three decades.\n\nAs an emergency physician, he has provided front-line care in remote and urban environments as well as serving in administrative roles including department chair and president of the hospital medical staff. The majority of Dr. Levy’s clinical practice is now EMS medicine. He is the Medical Director and for the Anchorage Fire Department and for Anchorage Area-wide EMS, a position he has held since 1995. He is the Medical Director for Emergency Programs for the State of Alaska and has the honor to serve as the medical director for a number of other Alaska EMS agencies, including being the EMS Medical Director for the Kenai Peninsula Borough, Fairweather LLC, Anchorage Service Patrol among others.\n\nDr. Levy is the President of the National Association of EMS Physicians, the Alaska PI for the Heart Rescue Project and the president of the Loren Marshall Foundation, a 501(c)3. He is the Chief Medical Advisor for Stryker Emergency Care. He is the Medical Director for Global Medical Response’s International Motorsports Association medical program. Dr. Levy is a faculty member of the Seattle Resuscitation Academy and serves as a senior consultant for the Academy. He has served on a variety of national committees and expert panels and is a published author on a number of scientific articles.\n\nDr. Levy has been involved in EMS from Chicago to the Navajo Nation and has served as the civilian Medical Director for the Alaska Air National Guard Pararescue Squadron. His goal in EMS is to enable providers to improve the outcome of their patients through personal empowerment via education, training and evidence-based practice.\n\nDr. Levy’s undergraduate degree was from the CU Boulder, with MD from Northwestern University followed by residencies in Emergency Medicine and Internal Medicine with board certifications in both as well as subspecialty boards in EMS Medicine.\n\nHe is based in Anchorage, AK where he is an Affiliate Associate Professor with the University of Alaska Health Sciences and practices community-based emergency medicine.\n\nMatt Cox was raised on the plains of Oklahoma in a small community just outside of Bartlesville, home of Phillips 66 Petroleum founder Frank Phillips. After graduating high school, he would go on to graduate EMT-Basic and become nationally registered in 2003. Matt served in rural departments in need of personnel for rural communities (Hominy EMS and Bartlesville EMS) before beginning his career at EMSA in January 2005. As his career progressed, he was selected for the EMSA in house Paramedic program, shortly thereafter graduating and becoming a nationally registered Paramedic in October 2007. He then promoted to several positions within EMSA, from Field Training Officer, Assistant Division Chief, Quality Assurance Coordinator, to finally the Quality Assurance Lead for Metropolitan Tulsa and Oklahoma City. It was during his tenure as the Quality Assurance Lead that the Chief Medical Officer for Metropolitan Tulsa and Oklahoma City made the decision to pursue improved cardiac arrest survival, and Matt had the honor to be on the forefront of that movement in the culture of resuscitation. Changes in the resuscitation culture required champions from multiple agencies within the response area, with Matt being provided the opportunity to be one of those champions. He then accepted the position of Division Chief of Critical Care Analytics within the Office of the Medical Director, serving as the primary champion for the resuscitation culture. In this position, he would would serve patients and front line credentialed personnel by providing feedback directly to field personnel by Resuscitation Annotations. These annotations lead the way for field personnel to truly understand their performance to “celebrate the red” and “celebrate the green”. It was only through understanding our current state could we move forward to our future state of improved neurologic outcomes, with Matt providing that intel. Matt also grew the resuscitation culture in Metropolitan Tulsa and Oklahoma City by expanding focus on all resuscitations aside from the Utstein template that had been the sole focus before. Resuscitation Culture should not just be limited to only 5% of our resuscitations; but should encompass each and every effort for our patients to return to their lives after such an event. By creating the Annual Resuscitation Report, Matt provided the ability for all to celebrate where we have succeeded, and focus on where we can begin. These efforts that Matt had undertaken would not be possible if not for multiple individuals along the way: To my wife Stephanie- You have been the perfect match for my drive. 15 years ago I gained enough courage to ask you on a date- a moment of courage that changed my life in ways I could have never dreamed. The highs, the lows, and you were there for all of them. Lifting me up when I needed you, and pushing me when I didn’t think I could get there. This award is a much for you and it is for me. I love you, and thank you for being the rock that I and our 3 children need! My Parents Mike and Denise Cox- Thank you for raising me to believe in myself, and always pushing me to excel. Potential is fostered and grown through hard work and dedication, and you both were great examples and parents. Who would have ever thought a boy from small town Oklahoma could have the opportunity to help drive change in an industry or a culture? You did, and that is why I am here. My late Grandmother, Alpha Ross- All those years ago, you started a family that lead to my ability to help those in need. Times were tough, but you never failed us, no matter the circumstances. While you may have felt like your abilities were limited to Caney, Kansas your love and devotion to your family are felt well outside of your hometown. Every thought I have in regards to what is best for a patient begins with “How would something like this would have effected Grandma Alpha?”. Some may see this as a self serving thought, however I firmly believe that if I treat someone with the reverence I have for you, then I can never go wrong. My OMD Teammates- You guys are a tough group to keep up with. Always pushing the limits, with the patient always at the center of every decision. It is true what is said that you are the company you keep, and my peers are above and beyond. Dr. Goodloe, Dr. Knoles, Chief David Howerton, and Chief Duffy McAnallen thank you for allowing me to have the opportunity to stand next to you fighting the good fight, and challenging me every day! To all of the EMTS, Paramedics, Fire Fighters, LEOs, Nurses, and Physicians- Keep pushing forward. The last 2 years have been tough on all of us. In seasons like these, we must continue to push forward. Without you- all of you- these changes would not be possible. While others may doubt, you never do. And you continue to persevere. Bravery is not the absence of fear, but the choice to overcome it. To choose action over inaction. Be the champion your department, peers, and citizens need. If a small town Oklahoma boy can do it, so can you.\n\nKatie Charbonneau EMT, Hinesburg Fire Department Cardiac Arrest Survivor Being born and raised in a Fire Department family, Katie Charbonneau was no stranger to emergencies. On Halloween 2018, Katie became the emergency when she suffered from Sudden Cardiac Arrest, while sleeping in her home. Thankfully her Husband Lucas woke up and using his skills as an EMT, and was able to save her, along with 19 other “family” members from their department. While the cause of her Cardiac Arrest is still unknown, her purpose has become very clear now. In February 2019, Katie held her first “Katie’s Community CPR” Hands Only CPR training. Since then, she has taught over 350 people hands only CPR in her small community. Katie has also become a AHA BLS Instructor as well, to be able to teach certification classes. Since then, she has personally fundraised money and purchased 6 AED’s that are now currently used for Public Access Defibrillators in the town of Hinesburg, VT. Recently, she was able to purchase two SaveStation Wall Mount units in order to be able to place more AEDs in her town and have them be protected by the elements. In early 2020, Katie decided it was time to make the town of Hinesburg a designated HeartSafe Community. Through her hard work and time, she helps to maintain this status for Hinesburg, offering CPR/AED classes and educating the public on Cardiac Arrest and Heart Health. Katie also had the honor of being the Vermont AHA Go Red For Women Luncheon Survivor Speaker. Unfortunately due to Covid 19, the luncheon became a virtual event, but Katie enjoyed having the opportunity to share her story with thousands of people. In Spring 2021, Katie achieved her EMT license and actively runs First Response with the Hinesburg Fire Department, where she also coordinates CPR classes. She recently began working as a Medical Assistant for Outpatient Cardiology at the University of Vermont Medical Center.\n\nBionic and proud of it, Bethany Keime is using her passion, talents, and personal journey as the Co-Founder and CEO of HeartCharged. Her @heartcharged Instagram account has become the home to the Jolt community. Thousands of people connect and have become their own international support system for cardiac arrest survivors and heart patients. The need for this is ever-expanding as more people live longer after cardiac events. Additionally through HeartCharged, thousands are joining in an awareness plus action campaign determined to create more survivors.\n\nOf particular note is how Bethany has tapped into the power of social media to start redefining beauty to include the heart warrior, with actual life-saving consequences. One of the original objectives of the @heartcharged Instagram account was to show that the heart warrior body, scarred and misformed as it may be, holds a special beauty and power to be celebrated and not ashamed of. Bethany is truly a proud bionic beauty often seen in clothing she’s designed, device out, heels on, flaunting her own brand of “I’m sexy and strong and scarred” attitude. While other 20-somethings go to vacation in the UK, Bethany saved up to travel there to be part of the Behind the Scars project. Her openness to sharing what others might hide has had life-saving consequences. Other young people diagnosed with her condition but hesitant to accept medical interventions such as defibrillator implantation have found her and been inspired.\n\nAt the heart of HeartCharged and Bethany’s work is patient-to-patient support. She puts on virtual meet-ups monthly with international attendance. She will also travel hours for a one-on-one conversation. She will stay up all night messaging frantically and stay up all night with a newly-bionic or newly-diagnosed person, answering questions only another patient can understand. She has found so many who have felt so alone in their diagnosis. She is working to end that. Through a grant, she sends goodie bags to other patients assuring them they are part of a community.\n\nRallying community engagement, Bethany has made AED donations and put on heart screenings. She is a CPR instructor and puts on classes and demonstrations and shares information at community events. She helped pass significant state legislation leading to mandated CPR and AED training for students for which she was recognized on the House floor. She created a school assembly for elementary students which educates them on the steps to take in case of a cardiac emergency, the warning signs of heart conditions, and life with a heart condition and implanted defibrillator. She teaches young people not to fear using an AED. AED donations have been made in conjunction with the assemblies. The audience dance movements and entertaining video included make the presentation both upbeat and memorable.\n\nBethany has had several articles published and has participated in many podcasts and magazine and tv interviews. She enjoys sharing patient insights with other patients, caregivers, and especially the medical community. She loves creating a vast array of content to share. She is informative and real, informational and affirming.\n\nBethany’s vast array of work has been recognized with a number of awards. She has been lauded by community and patient advocacy organizations. Her own hometown issued a proclamation and passed a town ordinance requiring AEDs in recreational facilities due to her advocacy.\n\nShe recently graduated With Highest Honors with her Bachelor’s of Fine Arts. She is an impacted patient truly making an impact. You should connect with her @heartcharged. You’ll enjoy the journey with this friend.\n\nHannah combines her own uniqueness, creativity, and talent, along with passion and power, to spread awareness to stop preventable deaths from sudden cardiac arrest and give support to fellow heart warriors.\n\nThis she does while being a full-time student on an accelerated schedule, working full-time on the business she helps run to pay for school, and being a totally-full-time heart patient with an advanced condition that no one could blame for just wanting to curl up and take a nap.\n\nHannah was fortuitously diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy right after starting high school. The pediatric cardiologist who screened her wondered how she was alive considering the severity of her condition. As soon as her life was saved, she set out on a crusade to try and save others. She gave assemblies at school and in the community, worked on legislation, and spoke to individuals, begging people to have young people screened.\n\nMeanwhile, Hannah’s condition worsened, and she soon needed an implanted defibrillator. Only months later, that device saved her from the sudden cardiac arrest that struck in her sleep. It also saved her another time while she was performing on her school stage. As Hannah’s condition threw her more challenges, she responded with more determination.\n\nIn 2019, she began HeartCharged with her sister who shares her diagnosis. As they lived through so much so young, they had each other. They wanted others to have someone who understood as well. This desire is timely as united efforts mean more survivors who now need support. Where do they find community? Where do they, especially the young people, find others like themselves to relate to? Where do they find someone bold enough to start a conversation about needing to down a dozen pills a day at age 20? Where do they find someone real enough to relive heartbreaking events? Where do they find someone who knows what it’s like to know you just didn’t die in your sleep? Where do they find out they are not alone?
