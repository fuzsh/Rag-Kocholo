The codes for regions and voivodships remain unchanged.\n\nI have added new population data from the 2011 census, and previous censuses. The data were provided by Valentin Arzoumanian and Sorin Cosoveanu.\n\nISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-3 is dated 2011-12-15. It merely changes the sort order of the divisions of Poland.\n\nFIPS PUB 10-4 is the U.S. Federal standard for administrative divisions of countries. Change 2 to FIPS PUB 10-4 is dated 1999-03-01. This change recognizes the reorganization of Poland that took effect on 1998-07-27. Update I-1 to ISO 3166-2 was published on 2000-06-21. It also shows the revised list of voivodships from 1998. The FIPS and ISO codes for the current divisions of Poland are shown in the table below.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort namePOLAND ISO codePL FIPS codePL LanguagePolish (pl) Time zone+1~ CapitalWarsaw\n\nIn 1900, historical Poland was entirely subjected to other nations. The area that is now Poland was split among the German, Russian, and Austro-Hungarian Empires. At the end of World War I, the Poles proclaimed a republic which was then validated by the Versailles Treaty. As World War II began, Germany and the Soviet Union overran the country from opposite sides to the middle. In the settlements ending the war, Poland was reconstituted. As compared to the interbellum period, it gained territory in the west from Germany, but lost territory in the east to the Soviet Union. It remained independent, but under the hegemony of the Soviet Union, until the Iron Curtain fell in 1989.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Polen\n\nDutch: Polen, Republiek Polen (formal)\n\nEnglish: Polish Republic (formal)\n\nFinnish: Puola\n\nFrench: Pologne f\n\nGerman: Polen n\n\nHungarian: Lengyelország\n\nIcelandic: Pólland\n\nItalian: Polonia f\n\nNorwegian: Polen, Republikken Polen (formal)\n\nPolish: Polska, Rzeczpospolita Polska (formal)\n\nPortuguese: Polónia, Polônia f (Brazil), República f da Polónia f (formal)\n\nRussian: Республика Польша (formal)\n\nSpanish: Polonia, República f Polaca (formal)\n\nSwedish: Polen\n\nTurkish: Polonya Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nfrom ethnic name Polane, from Slavic pole: field\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nPoland is divided into sixteen wojewodztwa (voivodships).\n\nVoivodshipHASCFIPSNUTSPop-2011Pop-2002Pop-1988Area(km.²)Area(mi.²)CapitalFormer DolnośląskiePL.DSPL72PL512,915,2382,907,2122,948,21219,9477,701WrocławJelenia Góra, Legnica, Wałbrzych, Wrocław Kujawsko-pomorskiePL.KPPL73PL612,097,6342,069,3212,044,04917,9716,939BydgoszczBydgoszcz, Toruń, Włocławek ŁódzkiePL.LDPL74PL112,538,6772,612,8902,703,69818,2197,034ŁódźŁódź, Piotrków, Sieradz, Skierniewice LubelskiePL.LUPL75PL312,175,7002,199,0542,209,22125,1229,700LublinBiała Podlaska, Chełm, Lublin, Zamość LubuskiePL.LBPL76PL431,022,8431,008,954982,68413,9885,401Gorzów WielkopolskiGorzów, Zielona Góra MałopolskiePL.MAPL77PL213,337,4713,240,7303,088,45815,1835,862KrakówKraków, Nowy Sącz, Tarnów MazowieckiePL.MZPL78PL125,268,6605,124,0184,997,84535,55813,729WarszawaCiechanów, Ostrołęka, Płock, Radom, Siedlce, Warszawa OpolskiePL.OPPL79PL521,016,2131,065,0431,080,7019,4123,634OpoleOpole PodkarpackiePL.PKPL80PL322,127,2852,095,5152,010,71417,8466,890RzeszówKrosno, Przemyśl, Rzeszów, Tarnobrzeg PodlaskiePL.PDPL81PL341,202,3651,208,6061,188,54720,1877,794BiałystokBiałystok, Łomża PomorskiePL.PMPL82PL632,276,1762,179,9002,095,14718,3107,070GdańskElbląg, Gdańsk, Słupsk ŚląskiePL.SLPL83PL224,630,3644,742,8744,915,21012,3334,762KatowiceBielsko-Biała, Częstochowa, Katowice ŚwiętokrzyskiePL.SKPL84PL331,280,7271,297,4771,317,44111,7114,521KielceKielce Warmińsko-mazurskiePL.WNPL85PL621,452,1471,428,3571,397,99724,1739,333OlsztynOlsztyn, Suwałki WielkopolskiePL.WPPL86PL413,447,4413,351,9153,236,61829,82711,516PoznańKalisz, Konin, Leszno, Piła, Poznań ZachodniopomorskiePL.ZPPL87PL421,722,8831,698,2141,662,56322,8928,839SzczecinKoszalin, Szczecin 16 voivodships38,511,82438,230,08037,879,105312,680120,726\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.

In most cases, provincial boundaries have\n\nchanged. I listed each old province under the new province that contains its\n\ncapital and the greater part of its territory, as far as I could determine.\n\nPostal codes:\n\nPoland uses five-digit postal codes, with a hyphen between the second and third digits. The codes don't correlate well with voivodship boundaries.\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Counties of Poland page.\n\nPoland is divided into 16 województwa (sing. województwo: voivodships or provinces). The voivodships are divided into 308 powiaty (sing. powiat: districts, counties) and 65 cities of county right, sometimes referred to as rural districts and urban districts. These are subdivided into miasta (towns), which are further subdivided into gminy (sing. gmina: communes, wards). The powiaty were abolished in 1975, but reinstated in 1998.\n\nPoland has also been divided into arbitrary NUTS-1 regions (regiony) and NUTS-3 subregions (podregiony) for statistical purposes. The NUTS scheme is hierarchical. The first four characters of a subregion code indicate which voivodship the subregion belongs to, and the first three characters of a voivodship code indicate which region the voivodship belongs to. Here are lists of these codes.\n\nNUTS-1Region PL1Centralny PL4Północno-zachodni PL6Północny PL5Południowo-zachodni PL2Południowy PL3Wschodni\n\nNUTS-3Subregion PL343Białostocki PL311Bialski PL225Bielski PL613Bydgosko-Toruński PL228Bytomski PL312Chełmsko-zamojski PL121Ciechanowsko-płocki PL224Częstochowski PL621Elbląski PL623Ełcki PL634Gdański PL229Gliwicki PL431Gorzowski PL614Grudziądzki PL515Jeleniogórski PL416Kaliski PL22AKatowicki PL331Kielecki PL414Koniński PL422Koszaliński PL214Krakowski PL323Krośnieński PL516Legnicko-Głogowski PL417Leszczyński PL114Łódzki PL344Łomżyński PL314Lubelski PL213Miasto Kraków PL113Miasto Łódź PL415Miasto Poznań PL424Miasto Szczecin PL127Miasto Warszawa PL514Miasto Wrocław PL215Nowosądecki PL521Nyski PL622Olsztyński PL522Opolski PL122Ostrołęcko-siedlecki PL216Oświęcimski PL411Pilski PL115Piotrkowski PL418Poznański PL324Przemyski PL315Puławski PL128Radomski PL227Rybnicki PL325Rzeszowski PL332Sandomiersko-jędrzejowski PL116Sieradzki PL117Skierniewicki PL631Słupski PL22BSosnowiecki PL423Stargardzki PL635Starogardzki PL345Suwalski PL425Szczeciński PL326Tarnobrzeski PL217Tarnowski PL633Trójmiejski PL22CTyski PL517Wałbrzyski PL129Warszawski-wschodni PL12AWarszawski-zachodni PL615Włocławski PL518Wrocławski PL432Zielonogórski\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nZachodniopomorskie contains the Polish part of Uznam Island (German name: Usedom).\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Poland lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names of former provinces:\n\nBiałystok: Polish biały: white, stok: river\n\nBydgoszcz: Indo-European bredahe: swampy water\n\nElbląg: from Old Norwegian elf: river\n\nGdańsk: from Gothic Gutisk-andja: end of the Goths (Gdynia likewise)\n\nJelenia Góra: Polish jelen: stag, gora: mountain (cf. German name, from Hirsch: stag, Berg: mountain)\n\nKraków: man's name Krak, legendary founder of city\n\nZielona Góra: Polish zielona: green, gora: mountain (cf. German name, from grün: green, Berg: mountain)\n\nChange history:\n\n1815-05-03: Congress of Vienna created the Kingdom of Poland (sometimes called Congress Poland) and made it a semi-autonomous part of the Russian Empire.\n\n1861: Administrative reform in the Russian Empire divided Congress Poland into ten guberniy, or provinces. Their Russian names (transliterated) were Kalish, Kel'tsy, Lomzha, Lyublin, Petrokov, Plotsk, Radom, Sedlets, Suvalki, and Varshava.\n\nIn 1900, the area corresponding to modern Poland belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire, and the Russian Empire. The Austro-Hungarian Empire consisted of Austria (Cisleithania) and Hungary (Transleithania); Austria, in turn, was divided into provinces, parts of two of which (Galicia and Silesia) are now in Poland. The German-owned section of modern Poland lay within two states of the German Empire: the Kingdom of Prussia (Brandenburg, East Prussia, Pomerania, Posen, Silesia, and West Prussia provinces) and the Kingdom of Saxony (Bautzen province). The Russian part consisted of most of the Kingdom of Poland, and part of the guberniya of Grodno.\n\n1912: Kholm (Polish Chelm) guberniya formed from parts of Lyublin and Sedlets.\n\n1919-06-28: Treaty of Versailles signed. Poland's independence, which it had proclaimed on 1918-11-09, was recognized. Poland comprised most of Posen and West Prussia provinces from Germany, the Kingdom of Poland from Russia, and Galicia from Austria. Galicia was in fact divided into East and West Galicia. West Galicia became fully part of Poland; East Galicia was mandated to Poland but a plebiscite was planned for it. Germany retained East Prussia and a small section of West Prussia, an exclave separated from the rest of Germany by the \"Polish Corridor.\" A 1,893-km.² section on the West Prussian Baltic shore around Danzig (Gdańsk) became the Free City of Danzig (Freie Stadt Danzig). The provisional border between Poland and Russia was the Curzon Line, soon wiped from the map in the Russo-Polish War (1919-20), which also gave Poland full sovereignty in East Galicia.\n\n1920-10-07: Poland occupied the southeastern part of Vilna, including the city of Vilnius.\n\n1921-03-18: Poland and Russia signed the Riga Treaty, dividing Byelorussia between them. Poland gained Grodno, most of Vilna, the western part of Volhynia, and a western fringe of Minsk. Brest-Litovsk was renamed to Brzešč nad Bugiem.\n\n1921-05-21: Plebiscite held in most of Upper Silesia (part of Silesia province, Prussia). A few eastern cantons voted for union with Poland, which took place in 1922. The divisions of Poland at this time were the former Prussian Bezirke (districts) of Bydgoszcz (Bromberg), Gdansk (Danzig), Kwidzyn (Marienwerder), and Poznan (Posen); the guberniy of Russian Poland, Kalisz (Kalish), Kielce (Kel'tsy), Łomża (Lomzha), Lublin (Lyublin), Piotrkow (Petrokov), Płock (Plotsk), Radom, Siedlce (Sedlets), Suwalki (Suvalki), and Warszawa (Varshava); the conquered sections of the West Russian guberniy of Grodno, Minsk, Vilna, and Wolyń (Volhynia); and Kraków (West Galicia) and Lwów (East Galicia). Names in parentheses are the prewar names of these divisions.\n\n1939-09-01: Germany invaded Poland, igniting World War II. The Soviet Union invaded Poland on 1939-09-17. By 1939-09-21, Poland had been divided between Germany and the Soviet Union. Germany also annexed the Free City of Danzig, which it renamed Hanseatic City of Danzig (Hansestadt Danzig) in 1940.\n\n1939-10-10: Over half of the Polish territory in Vilna guberniya restored to Lithuania.\n\n1945-07-16: Potsdam Conference began. It transferred large parts of the German provinces of Pomerania, Brandenburg, Silesia, East and West Prussia to Poland, except that the northern part of East Prussia became Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia. The new western border of Poland was called the Oder-Neisse Line, as it generally followed the course of the Oder and Neisse Rivers. A small area east of Ostrava was transferred from Poland to Czechoslovakia, splitting in two the city known as Cieszyn in Polish, Těšín in Czech, and Teschen in German. The Soviet Union recovered territory lost in the Russo-Polish War up to approximately the Curzon Line, annexing it to the republics of Byelorussia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. By 1946, Poland was organized into fourteen voivodships and two independent cities on the same administrative level as a voivodship. Boundaries were redrawn, so the correspondence is only fair, but Mazury is roughly East Prussia; Śląsk Dabrowski and Śląsk Dolny roughly match Silesia; Pomorze Zachodnie roughly matches Pomerania; and the Free City of Danzig merged with the new Gdańsk voivodship.\n\nVoivodshipPopulationArea(km.²)Capital Białystok917,60022,551Białystok Gdańsk732,10010,725Sopot Kielce1,717,30018,052Kielce Kraków2,133,40015,918Kraków Łódź1,772,40020,233Łódź Łódź [City]496,900212Łódź Lublin1,889,70027,741Lublin Mazury351,80019,319Olsztyn Pomorze1,406,50020,028Bydgoszcz Pomorze Zachodnie892,60030,251Szczecin Poznań2,422,10039,243Poznań Rzeszów1,535,40018,200Rzeszów Śląsk Dabrowski2,823,40015,369Katowice Śląsk Dolny1,941,10024,740Wrocław Warszawa2,114,40029,000Pruszków Warszawa [City]478,800140Warszawa 16 divisions23,929,800311,722\n\nPopulation: 1946 census\n\n~1949: Name of Mazury changed to Olsztyn; name of Pomorze changed to Bydgoszcz; name of Pomorze Zachodnie changed to Szczecin; name of Śląsk Dabrowski changed to Śląsk; name of Śląsk Dolny changed to Wrocław.\n\n~1955: Koszalin voivodship formed from parts of Bydgoszcz, Gdańsk, and Szczecin; Śląsk voivodship split into Katowice and Opole (with small annexations from Kielce and Wrocław); Zielona Góra voivodship formed from parts of Poznań and Wrocław; Kraków, Poznań, and Wrocław independent cities split from the voivodships of the same names; other border adjustments made; capital of Warszawa voivodship moved from Pruszków to Warszawa (Warsaw).
