Poland is divided into 16 Voivodships (provinces), which are in turn divided into 314 Powiatu (counties)

and 65 "miasta na prawach powiatu" (cities with powiat status).

The counties are in turn divided into "gminy" (translated as districts or communes), which are of 3 types:

gmina miejska, or urban district, consisting of a town

gmina miejsko-wiejska, or urban-rural, consisting of a town ("miasto") and the surrounding rural area ("obszar wiejski")

gmina wiejska, or rural district, consisting of several villages.

In many cases two districts will share the same name, one for the town, and one for the surrounding countryside.
