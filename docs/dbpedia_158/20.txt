Konin, city, Wielkopolskie województwo (province), west-central Poland, situated on the banks of the Warta River, 61 miles (98 km) east of Poznań city and 60 miles south of Toruń city. With close ties to the regional capital of Poznań, Konin is an important commercial centre in its own right.

An excavated Roman milestone marks Konin as the halfway point on the ancient trade route between Kalisz and Kruszwica. It was first chronicled in the 13th century as a commercial centre. After being destroyed by the Teutonic Knights in 1331, Konin was rebuilt as a walled and fortified town and became an important centre for the textile industry and craftsmen’s guilds. From 1793 to 1806 it was under Prussian rule; in 1815 Konin was returned to Poland. It received city rights in 1923. Gothic (dating from the 14th century) and Baroque churches, together with the 19th-century town hall, Masonic lodge, and synagogue, are points of interest. Local brown coal mines help fuel power plants, machine works, and metalworks, such as a large aluminum-smelting plant. Pop. (2011) 78,525.
