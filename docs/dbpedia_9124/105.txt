The China Energy Label (CEL) shows compliance to the guidelines of energy consuming products’ energy efficiency class and energy cost. The China Energy Label Scheme has been made mandatory by the Chinese government. Products that fail to carry the CEL will be punished according to Energy Efficiency Label Policing Method.

The label provides consumers with necessary information about high energy efficiency products. The goal of the China Energy Label Scheme is to improve energy efficiency of consumer products and create awareness about saving energy among consumers.
