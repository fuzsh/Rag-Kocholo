        "text": "China Energy Label Catalogue update (16th batch) was released by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on December 15, 2023.\n\nThe 16th batch includes three (3) new product types requiring CEL and 2 product types that have had their requirements updated.\n\nBelow you will find a summary of the key CEL implementation rules for the five (5) product types that are affected:\n\nImplementation rules for China energy efficiency labeling of welding machines – CEL043-2023\n\nGeneral Provisions: These rules are based on the “Management Measures for Energy Efficiency Labeling” and apply to arc welding machines and resistance welding machines powered by voltage not exceeding GB/T156 standards for industrial and professional purposes. Exemptions include certain types of welding machines and battery-powered welding machines.\n\nLabel Style and Specifications: The energy efficiency label is a blue and white colored label measuring 45mm in length and 30mm in width, named “China Energy Label.” It includes producer name, model, energy efficiency grade, efficiency percentage, rated current, and other relevant information.\n\nEnergy Efficiency Testing: Parameters related to product energy efficiency should be tested according to GB28736 standards, and the testing report format can be obtained from the “China Energy Label” website.\n\nLabel Information Determination: Manufacturers must ensure that product specifications match the label and follow the current GB28736 standards for energy efficiency.\n\nLabel Printing, Attachment, and Display: Labels should be affixed to welding machines using durable materials, be clearly displayed on the product and its packaging, and appear on the main page of online product listings.\n\nFiling and Record-Keeping: Manufacturers must file records for each product model, apply for record-keeping, and provide accurate information to the authorized agency. Updates to label content should be filed promptly.\n\nLabel Announcement: The authorized agency will maintain a product information database, announce verification and supervision results, and revoke records for non-compliant products. Complaints and reports about label violations can be made through various channels.\n\nImplementation time: June 1, 2024.\n\nProducts shipped or imported before June 1, 2024, may delay applying the CEL until June 1, 2026 in accordance with the implementation rules.\n\nImplementation Rules for Energy Efficiency Labeling of LED Flat Panel Lights for General Lighting – CEL044-2023\n\nGeneral Provisions: These rules are based on the “Management Measures for Energy Efficiency Labeling” and apply to LED flat panel lights for general lighting purposes with LED as the light source, rated voltage of 220V, frequency of 50Hz, and a thickness not exceeding 85mm. The rules do not apply to LED flat panel lights with energy-consuming non-lighting functions, dimming/color-changing functions, or those with colored patterns or decorations on the continuous lighting surface.\n\nLabel Style and Specifications: The label is a blue and white colored label measuring 45mm in length and 30mm in width, named “China Energy Label.” It includes the producer name, model, energy efficiency grade, rated power (W), rated correlated color temperature (K), luminous efficacy (lm/W), and other relevant information.\n\nEnergy Efficiency Testing: Parameters related to product energy efficiency should be tested according to GB38450 and GB/T31897.201 standards, and the testing report format can be obtained from the “China Energy Label” website.\n\nLabel Information Determination: Manufacturers must ensure that product specifications match the label and follow the current GB38450 standards for energy efficiency.\n\nLabel Printing, Attachment, and Display: Labels should be affixed to LED flat panel lights, using durable materials, on a visible part of the product, or on the product’s packaging. The label should also be displayed prominently on the main page of online product listings.\n\nFiling and Record-Keeping: Manufacturers or importers must file records for each product model and apply for record-keeping with accurate information. Updates to label content should be filed promptly.\n\nLabel Announcement: The authorized agency will maintain a product information database, announce verification and supervision results, and revoke records for non-compliant products. Complaints and reports about label violations can be made through various channels.\n\nImplementation time: June 1, 2024.\n\nProducts shipped or imported before June 1, 2024 may delay applying the CEL until June 1, 2026, in accordance with the implementation rules.\n\nImplementation Rules for Energy Efficiency Labeling of Commercial Induction Cookers – CEL045-2023\n\nGeneral Provisions: These rules are based on the “Management Measures for Energy Efficiency Labeling” and are applicable to energy efficiency labeling of commercial induction cookers with single or multiple heating units (where the rated power of a single heating unit is less than 35kW and the rated voltage does not exceed 450V). These rules do not apply to household induction cookers, those intended for special environmental conditions (such as corrosive or explosive environments), or outdoor use induction cookers.\n\nLabel Style and Specifications: The label features a blue and white background and measures 66mm in length and 45mm in width. It is named “China Energy Label” and includes producer name, model, energy efficiency grade, thermal efficiency (%), the reference number of the mandatory national energy efficiency standard, and an energy efficiency information code.\n\nEnergy Efficiency Testing: The testing method for thermal efficiency should follow the current version of GB40876. The format for the “Commercial Induction Cooker Energy Efficiency Testing Report” can be obtained from the “China Energy Label” website.\n\nLabel Information Determination: Manufacturers must ensure that the product specifications match the label, and the energy efficiency level should not exceed the specified range. For multiple heating unit products, the lowest energy efficiency level among the units determines the product’s energy efficiency level.\n\nImplementation time: June 1, 2024.\n\nProducts shipped or imported before June 1, 2024 may delay applying the CEL until June 1, 2026, in accordance with the implementation rules.\n\nImplementation rules Energy Efficiency Labeling of AC Contactors – CEL 018-2023\n\nGeneral Provisions: These rules are based on the “Management Measures for Energy Efficiency Labeling” and are applicable to three-pole electromechanical AC contactors with specific electrical characteristics, including a rated frequency of 50Hz, a rated voltage of 1000V or and below, and a rated current range of 6A to 630A for the main circuit. They also cover control circuits with a rated frequency of 50Hz and a rated control power supply voltage of AC 400V and below, specifically in the AC-3 category.\n\nLabel Design: The energy efficiency label should have a specific design, including a blue and white color scheme with dimensions of 45mm in length and 30mm in width. It includes the producer’s name, model, energy efficiency grade, holding power, rated current, rated current range, mandatory national energy efficiency standard number, and an energy efficiency information code.\n\nTesting and Verification: Testing methods must comply with GB 21518 standards, and the format for the AC contactor energy efficiency test report is specified. Manufacturers or importers can use their own testing labs or accredited third-party organizations to determine product energy efficiency levels. Proper equipment calibration and verification are encouraged.\n\nImplementation time: January 1, 2024.\n\nProducts shipped or imported before January 1, 2024 may delay applying the CEL until January 1, 2026, in accordance with the revised implementation rules.\n\nImplementation Rules for Energy Efficiency Labeling of Display Monitors – CEL 014-2023\n\nGeneral Provisions: These rules are established in accordance with the “Management Measures for Energy Efficiency Labeling ” and apply to flat and curved monitors used for general and commercial purposes.
