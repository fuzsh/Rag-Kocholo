        "text": "The European Union, China and the USA are the world’s three largest trading partners.\n\nThe EU is committed to open trading relations with China. China is expected to conform to fair trade practices, to respect intellectual property rights, and to meet its obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nOn 30 December 2020, the EU and China concluded in principle the negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). The agreement grants EU investors a greater level of access to China’s market. The CAI has not yet been ratified. It has therefore not yet entered into force.\n\nTrade picture\n\nOn trade in goods, the EU currently has a trade deficit with China.\n\nOn trade in services, the EU currently has a trade surplus with China.\n\nTrade statistics on the EU’s relations with China\n\nThe EU and China\n\nWhen China joined the WTO in 2001, China agreed to reform and to liberalise significant parts of its economy. While China has made progress and continues to liberalise various non-sensitive industries, problems remain:\n\nA lack of transparency;\n\nIndustrial policies and non-tariff measures that discriminate against foreign companies;\n\nstrong government intervention in the economy. This means that state-owned firms are in a dominant position with unequal access to subsidies and to cheap financing, and;\n\npoor enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n\nThe EU’s engagement with China on trade is guided by the 2019 EU Strategic Outlook, which promotes reciprocity, a level playing field and fair competition.\n\nThe strategy includes a strong focus on improving market access opportunities. It also refers to problems of over-capacity. It calls for ambitious engagement from China at multilateral levels.\n\nInvestment\n\nThe EU-China Investment Agreement is central to the EU’s long-term bilateral relations with China. Negotiations for the Investment Agreement began in 2013. On 30 December 2020, the EU and China concluded in principle the negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). The agreement grants EU investors a greater level of access to China’s market.\n\nIn the agreement, China commits to ensuring fairer treatment for EU companies in China, allowing them to compete on a more level playing field. These commitments cover state-owned enterprises, transparency of subsidies, and rules against forced technology transfer. The rules negotiated in the CAI set a high benchmark in terms of transparency, a level playing field, market access commitments and sustainable development. The EU's work on planned autonomous measures in areas such as subsidies or due diligence continues as a matter of priority.\n\nChina has agreed to provisions on sustainable development, including commitments on climate and forced labour.\n\nBoth sides agreed to continue negotiations on investment protection and investment dispute settlement, to be completed within two years of the signature of the agreement.\n\nFor more information:\n\nEU press release on CAI\n\nAgreement in principle\n\nTimeline and other documents\n\nThe latest available data on investment between the EU and China.\n\nThe EU and China discuss policies and issues regarding trade and investment in a range of dialogues:\n\nAnnual EU-China Summit: presidential-level exchange on enhancing policy coordination on a number of issues, including trade;\n\nEU-China High Level Economic and Trade Dialogue (HED): an EU vice-president and the Chinese Vice Premier meet to discuss issues accompanied by EU commissioners and Chinese ministers;\n\nJoint Committee on Trade: annual ministerial-level meeting;\n\nTrade and Investment Policy Dialogue: meeting at director-general level, and;\n\nEconomic and Trade Working Group (ETWG): expert level discussions.\n\nTrading with China\n\nImporting into the EU from China\n\nEU trade defence measures on imports from China\n\nExporting from the EU to China\n\nTrade defence measures in force in China\n\nTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with China\n\nChina is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\nEU-China trade issues referred to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body by the EU against China and by others, including China against the EU\n\nThe European Union Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) celebrates European companies’ success in China, but also urges China's leaders not to turn inward\n\nThe EU supports European SMEs in exporting to and investing in China, and also offers SMEs specific advice on IPR issues"
