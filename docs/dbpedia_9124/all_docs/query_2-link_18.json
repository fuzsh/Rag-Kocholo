        "text": "Chinese authorities have aggressively pursued policies to deliberately alter the demographics of ethnic minority regions, particularly in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia. Authorities in Xinjiang have interned more than a million Uyghurs and other members of Turkic ethnic minority groups in so-called Vocational Skills Education and Training Centers (VSETCs), as well as in prisons and other detention facilities. While the government claims that VSETCs are educational centers that Uyghurs and others participate in voluntarily, a cache of internal government documents, including speeches and photographs, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and published in 2022 provided further evidence of their coercive and abusive nature. The documents, which date back to 2017, describe facilities secured by armed guards who have been issued shoot-to-kill orders against anyone attempting to escape. Inside, detainees are subject to aggressive forms of indoctrination and political reeducation that aim to undermine their ethnic identities and religious beliefs.\n\nUyghur and other Muslim women in Xinjiang, particularly those with two or more children, are subject to a program of forced sterilization. Previous investigations and witness testimony have revealed that Xinjiang authorities have coerced women to accept surgical sterilization, forcibly implanted intrauterine contraceptive devices prior to internment, administered unknown drugs and injections to women in detention, and used fines and internment as punishment for birth-control violations.\n\nIn 2022, poverty alleviation measures included the coercion of hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minority members, mostly farmers and other residents authorities refer to as “surplus rural laborers,” to leave their hometowns and take low-wage jobs elsewhere, largely in state-owned factories. Participants have described prison-like environments where individuals are subjected to political indoctrination. Despite the government’s claim that the relocations are voluntary and to the financial benefit of participants, a UN special rapporteur in a 2022 report cited evidence that the programs involve forced labor, heavy surveillance, violence, and degrading treatment, and that “some instances may amount to enslavement as a crime against humanity.\n\nIncreasing numbers of ethnic minority children in Xinjiang and Tibet have been separated from their parents and forced to attend state-run boarding schools, where Mandarin is the sole language of instruction and where students are subject to intense political indoctrination. Those who protest are subject to detention and other forms of punishment. In recent years the Ministry of Education has required preschools across China to make Mandarin Chinese the language of instruction, reflecting an ongoing push to impose Mandarin as the dominant language at all educational levels and further weaken the cultural identities of ethnic minority groups and individuals. A multiyear campaign of detaining ethnic minority writers, scholars, musicians, and religious figures, often meting out long prison terms, continues to damage the cultural, religious, social and economic leadership of these communities.\n\nThe government has also continued to promote policies that have attracted hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese to relocate to ethnic minority regions. Programs that encourage marriages between Han Chinese and members of ethnic minorities through financial and other incentives further aim to dilute minority identities."
