        "text": "Her partner, who was also in Wuhan, encountered visa problems, and she started to feel that the city she once regarded as “home” had become “less welcoming”.\n\n“All of a sudden, strangers would start telling me to go home. People would see me in a lift and wait for the next one. When DiDi [a ride-hailing app] drivers I ordered arrived and realised I was a foreigner, they’d refuse to take me,” the 30-year-old said.\n\nRedding said things had eased after the pandemic, but her experience has left her with the feeling of being treated as an outsider.\n\n“I still have a load of fantastic friends in Wuhan and across China. That’s why I stayed so long … but all those small outlier conversations and interactions kind of wear you down, and it’s started to weigh off against all the great things about living in China,” she said.\n\nIn the decade leading up to November 2020, the first year of the pandemic, the number of foreigners living in Shanghai fell by more than 20 per cent to 164,000, and by 40 per cent in Beijing to 63,000, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nAlthough these are the latest available figures, two more years of strict pandemic controls are expected to have led to more foreign residents leaving.\n\nRedding is not the only China-based foreigner to sense an increasing chilliness towards outsiders.\n\nJames Campion, a British translator and proofreader who left China last July, said he sensed a subtle shift in Chinese people’s attitudes and found it was becoming harder to make new friends.\n\n“It wasn’t as easy to strike up conversations, and there seemed to be a subtle hesitation from some locals, perhaps reflecting a growing awareness of geopolitical tensions,” he said.\n\nOther scars from the zero-Covid era continue to linger. One Russian-born art teacher from the United States who left Shanghai after 13 years said her decision to return to America was largely driven by concerns that the authorities could again impose strict controls on people’s movements and activities.\n\n“I like Chinese people. I like Chinese food. I like a lot of things. I grew up in Russia, in pretty much the same system. We have a lot of similarities and I understand them,” the woman in her sixties, who asked to be identified only as M, said.\n\n“But I don’t think there’s a guarantee that [this] is not going to happen again. Because you can just be locked [down] in the same way.\n\n“People are afraid to repeat the same experience. Nobody wants to stay away from their family for three years. That’s a long time. Who knows if there’ll be another Covid?”\n\nJames Zimmerman, a partner at the international law firm Perkins Coie and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the factors behind individual departures – which he described as “a combination of a weak economy, compliance risks, and geopolitical tensions” – were also driving away businesses.\n\nHe said: “While China is potentially a large and attractive consumer market, foreign business is rethinking whether to remain or expand in the market as a result of a host of geopolitical issues.”\n\nBut Zimmerman said he anticipated “an accelerated level of strategic reshoring, nearshoring, or offshoring to more friendly countries”, if these concerns continued.\n\n“Policies directed at retaining the expatriate community should keep in mind the bigger issues as noted above. No tax break or preferential treatment will bring them back if the bigger picture issues are not addressed,” he said.\n\nWang Huiyao, founder and president of the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisa­tion, said some of these concerns could be addressed by easing visa policies or even residency requirements.\n\n“China may consider relaxing its ‘green card’ policy for outstanding foreign talent, such as those with special contributions or who are innovative entrepreneurs,” he said.\n\n“The country could also consider allowing international students to take internships in China and universities could offer more English language programmes to attract overseas students.”\n\n“Now that many overseas [news] channels are available in some hotels, can we take it a step further and allow foreigners to use the hotel’s internet to access overseas websites smoothly? This will help to further increase their attachment to China,” he said.\n\n“By leveraging the resources of enterprises, universities and NGOs, the country can also invite more foreigners to China and promote people-to-people exchanges with the outside world.”\n\nChina issued a basket of new policies to relax entry and visa procedures on Thursday in a bid to draw more overseas visitors and restore people-to-people exchanges.\n\nThe new rules, which were released by the National Immigration Administration and took effect immediately, aim to ease eligibility requirements for entry visas, waive border inspections for transit at certain airports, and streamline application procedures for entry visas, extensions of stay and multiple-entry permits.\n\nThe number plummeted from 11,639 in the 2018-19 academic year to just 211 in 2021-22, according to the Institute of International Education’s Open Doors database.\n\nStatistics from China’s Ministry of Education showed that after peaking in 2019, the number of foreign students in the country’s higher education institutions fell by over 20 per cent to 255,720 in 2021.\n\nBut many of these foreign graduates struggle to find a job that will allow them to stay even if they do secure a work visa.\n\n“After graduation, my life became a hassle. The requirements of getting a work permit are not very attainable as a new graduate and as a Nigerian,” said Annie Akinnuoye, 22.\n\nAkinnuoye spent four years studying at a Chinese university and a further year working in the country, but was forced to leave in July because she could not find a suitable job that met her work visa’s requirements.\n\n“Being a self-funded student for four years had financially drained me, and I had hoped for a stable job to lean on for my stay in China. This was the main reason I left China,” she said.\n\nA Shanghai-based visa counsellor with more than a decade of experience said that for foreigners who wanted to stay in China, the overall environment and review processes had become stricter because of security concerns. But the demand for visas to China remained high and was continuing to rise.\n\n“Our company receives hundreds of inquiries for visa applications to China every day. Most of them are foreigners from African and Central Asian countries,” he said.\n\n“It’s a matter of being inside or outside the circle. Many foreigners in China may find this country bad or uncomfortable and choose to leave. But more foreigners, especially from developing countries, see China as an opportunity and want to come here.”"
