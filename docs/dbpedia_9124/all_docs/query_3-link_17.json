        "text": "Two great rivers run through China Proper: the Yellow River in the north, and the Yangtze (or Yangzi ) River to the south. In fact, most of China Proper belongs to the drainage-basins of these two rivers. Both originate to the far west in the Tibetan Plateau. The much smaller Xi River cuts through southern China. The map below shows the current courses of these rivers, but over time there have been many changes. Sometimes the Yellow River has emptied south of the Shandong peninsula, rather than north of it as it does today. And for long periods, the Huai River emptied into the sea.\n\nWhy do most of the rivers in China flow from the west to the east?\n\nHow many of the major cities of China are on major rivers?\n\nChina Proper was separated from the vast territories of Outer China to the north by the Great Wall, a huge construction project and famous landmark of Chinese civilization.\n\nTo see pictures of the Great Wall, click here.\n\nOn the right is an infrared satellite picture showing the area around Lake Tai and the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River is near the top, Lake Tai, the half-moon blue shape, at the bottom. The region has been the most prosperous area in China since the tenth century, and is commonly called the \"country of rice and fish.\"\n\nTo learn more about the Yangtze River, click here.\n\nRivers are an integral part of the daily life of people in South China.\n\nBelow is a picture of Suzhou in Jiangsu province showing houses along the Grand Canal. From north to south, the Grand Canal is over 1,700 kilometers (roughly 1,100 miles) long, linking Hangzhou in Zhejiang province with Beijing in the north. An extremely important water project that was first started in the Sui dynasty (589-618), it connects several big rivers and provides an important means of transportation and communication.\n\nWith the two pictures below in mind, how do you think the access to rivers and lakes would have made the lifestyle of people in the south different from that of people in the north?\n\nMuch of what can be seen on the Bund in Shanghai dates from the first half of the twentieth century. The tall buildings further from the river, below, have largely been built in the last ten years."
