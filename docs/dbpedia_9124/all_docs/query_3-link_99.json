        "text": "The British education system is one that promotes free thinking to students and allows them to explore ideas on their own depending on which subject. However, if we look at subjects such as Maths, we don't perform as well as students from China.\n\nA downside about the British education is that it can tend to have little flexibility due to a curriculum in place which teachers must follow and have limited freedom to teach outside this curriculum. The cirruculum is made by the government and it has already been decided (before one becomes a teacher) what they will teach to the kids of Britain and how.\n\nOn the positive side the certificate awarded from the UK is a valuable asset to any British student.\n\nHere in germany our school system is not too rigid but also not too relaxed.\n\nSchool is usually from 8am to about 2 pm ...later (in \"high school) there are some days where the students have classe until afternoon. But after that the students have to do homework and prepare for tests.\n\nThere are also schools (like mine) which are always until afternoon but then you usually don't have homeworks and you only have to prepare for the tests.\n\nOur school system might be better than in other countries but because it values good marks more then learning you often only learn for a test and forget most of it very fast.\n\nThe relationship between teachers and students is mostly quite relaxed.\n\nI'm not sure any one person could truly gauge the education system of another country in such a way, as perception would always be skewed in comparing it to your home country. You also have to take into account how the entire system works, and what (math, language, science, etc) is learned at what age.\n\nIn the US, and I'm sure many other places, I think the core issue is that eduction is less about learning and more about learning how to <em>take tests</em>.\n\nAt the end of the day, an education system is only as good as the motivation of the students. There are incredibly smart, A+ Valedictorian students at every level, in every country, regardless of the education system they were a part of. Many countries aren't nearly as rigid as places like China, but the level of education you receive is solely dependant on the students themselves and their desire to learn.\n\nReading your testimony it seems that chinese education is, indeed, too much. Sounds like quantity over quality, right?\n\nIn Brazil we have a different problem, our education system is not regid enough. Quite the contrary! And it lacks quality too.\n\nNot just Denmark, but all Scandinavian countries (Denmar, Sweden, Finland, Norway), plus Iceland, have a tremendously efficient education system. As for they being too relaxed, well, maybe comparing to other overworked societies, they are relaxed. But I supposed that's a good thing, isn't it?"
