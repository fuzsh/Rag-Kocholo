The product space can be used to predict future exports, since countries are more likely to start exporting products that are related to current exports. Relatedness measures the distance between a product, and all of the products a country currently specializes in.\n\nEconomic Complexity Ranking\n\nMethodology\n\nTrade\n\nTechnology\n\nResearch\n\nScale\n\nRanking\n\nValue\n\nCompare with\n\nDuring the last 20 years China's⁩ ⁨economy has become relatively more complex, moving from the ⁩⁨51st to the 22nd⁩ position in the ECI rank.\n\nThese economic complexity rankings use 6 digit exports classified according to the HS96 classification.
