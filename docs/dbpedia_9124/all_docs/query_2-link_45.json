        "text": "CSP approved at EB June 2022\n\nChina has made notable economic and social achievements in the last 40 years. China moved from low human development in 1990 to high, reflecting broad-based improvements in income, health and education. The proportion of the population living below the national poverty line declined to 0.6 percent by 2019, with poverty, hunger and malnutrition largely concentrated in specific populations in remote and rural areas. In 2020 the Chinese Government announced the elimination of extreme poverty in rural areas under the current poverty line.\n\nThe Chinese Government reports having reached its targets of holding the stunting rate in children under 6 below 7 percent and the underweight rate below 5 percent, although rural-urban differences remain, reflecting internal development gaps. There has been a significant increase in overnutrition, with 34.3 percent of adults overweight and 16.4 percent obese. Chronic diseases are increasingly prevalent; diabetes affects 11.9 percent of the population.\n\nThis country strategic plan is funded by the Government of China and the private sector. It is the product of extensive consultations with the Government and other partners. It builds upon the previous country strategic plan, covering 2017–2021, and aligns with the Government’s fourteenth five-year plan for economic and social development (covering 2021–2025), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations sustainable development cooperation framework for China for 2021–2025 and sectoral plans of action. It is also strategically aligned with WFP’s strategic plan for 2022–2025, which it was largely developed alongside. It entails continued, targeted assistance to China focused on improving nutrition outcomes. WFP’s cooperation with China will contribute to the following strategic outcome:\n\n➢ Strategic outcome 1: Left-behind groups in rural areas of China have improved nutrition status and livelihoods in line with national targets by 2025."
