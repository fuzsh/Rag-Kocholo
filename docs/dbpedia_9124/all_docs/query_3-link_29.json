It can be a challenge to get them to eat, but if it’s out and picking at the rock work then the desire to eat is a very good sign. Mine started within a couple of days taking small mysis at first. They are poor shippers and it took me a few years to find this healthy one.

Thanks!\n\nWell the most correct name is the new guinea wrasse, Anampses neoguineaicus. It is a tamarin wrasse and thus very sensitive and very difficult to get acclimated. But of the tamarin wrasse it is one of the easiest. Saying that it is a fish I would want to see eating before purchasing and I would be very careful about adding with aggressive fish. They require a reasonable pod population and a good sandbed. They also get fairly big and need a fairly big tank.\n\nAlso are very prone to:\n\nMouth injuries that prevent them from eating.\n\nAcclimation troubles/jet lag where they fail to adapt to lighting schedules.\n\nFinally smaller ones are far more likely to acclimate to tank conditions than older ones. So if I were to get one I would go for as small as possible.\n\nThese guys earn their expert only tag as do all tamarin wrasse.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nReefkeepers Archive\n\n2500 Club Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\nMessages\n\n3,146\n\nReaction score\n\n2,896\n\nLocation\n\nFalmouth\n\nWell the most correct name is the new guinea wrasse, Anampses neoguineaicus.

I saw it on a wholesale list and am thinking of ordering it. Of course I can't order it however my LFS can get it in. They do quarrintine all of their fish for 3 weeks, so no problem with ensuring they eat.

If you can get it to survive the first month you're probably golden.\n\n@OrionN We need your photos!\n\nOrionN\n\nAnemones\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nJul 28, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n9,761\n\nReaction score\n\n22,431\n\nLocation\n\nCorpus Christi, TX\n\n@Slocke: Here you go!!!!!\n\nThis wrasse looks like porcelain, thus China Wrasse.

I guess that they will do fine in a 120 gal tank. You can easily keep a harem of them. Once established, they will eat anything.

Don't think my tank has the capacity for 2 harems, will they be able to co-exist? Also, do they stay female if they are being kept singly. Also, this will be the first fish in my tank so aggression isn't a problem.\n\nOrionN\n\nAnemones\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nJul 28, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n9,761\n\nReaction score\n\n22,431\n\nLocation\n\nCorpus Christi, TX\n\nI think if you have a quite QT system with a lot of live food in it, it will help them get established. I have a 40 gal QT system that is full of macro algae, Sand and Live rock. I use this system to acclimate my sensitive fishes and usually do well with sensitive fishes. They are about as hard as Leopard wrasses to get acclimated IMO/IME. I am acclimated a small 1 inch A. twistii in this system right now. I normally don't have problem with hem unless they are sick.\n\nOrionN\n\nAnemones\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nJul 28, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n9,761\n\nReaction score\n\n22,431\n\nLocation\n\nCorpus Christi, TX\n\nThat's a hard one. Originally (and still planned) I want to keep a harem of meleagris leopard wrasse. Don't think my tank has the capacity for 2 harems, will they be able to co-exist? Also, do they stay female if they are being kept singly. Also, this will be the first fish in my tank so aggression isn't a problem.\n\nI have 2 harems, and multiple other pairs and single wrasses in my system. I have Harem of Black Leopards, Meleagris Leopards, and the pair of China Wrasses. They don't bother each other. My tank is 320 gal, so quite a bit bigger than your tank.\n\nPictures of my wrasses displaying and courting below:\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nReefkeepers Archive\n\n2500 Club Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\nMessages\n\n3,146\n\nReaction score\n\n2,896\n\nLocation\n\nFalmouth\n\nAnyway, I placed the order with my LFS, they do quarantine all their marine fish for 4 weeks (before purchase of course) so unless it dies it will be awhile before the next update. Thanks for all your help!\n\nMr_Knightley\n\n2500 Club Member\n\nView Badges\n\nJoined\n\nNov 30, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n2,768\n\nReaction score\n\n6,825\n\nLocation\n\nSoutheast USA\n\nAny updates?
