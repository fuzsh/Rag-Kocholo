        "text": "Geography\n\nThe People's Republic of China is a territorial state in East Asia with an area of 9.56 million kmÂ². This land mass is only slightly larger than that of the USA and makes China the third largest country in the world. Even more remarkable is its population of 1.41 billion inhabitants. In 2023, China was overtaken by India as the most populous country.\n\nDespite the large population with a density of 147.5 inhabitants per kilometer, the population is distributed very unevenly. The metropolitan areas with exceptionally large cities are located in the eastern and southern coastal regions. Around a third of the country is made up of mountains, of which the Himalayas and the Karakoram in the south are the world's highest mountain ranges. The highest mountain peak is Mount Everest at 8,848 meters on the border with Nepal. In the northwest, there are vast steppes and desert areas that extend far into the interior of the country and make large areas uninhabitable due to the lack of vegetation. Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are the driest regions.\n\nMegacities are lined up along the approximately 14,500 km long coastline. Over 150 megacities have sprung up in recent decades. The Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Beijing and Tianjin metropolitan areas are considered the largest conurbations. While at the end of the 1970s not even one in five Chinese lived in cities, today the proportion of the urban population is 63.6%."
