        "text": "Reconsider travel due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions.\n\nSummary: The People’s Republic of China (PRC) government arbitrarily enforces local laws, including issuing exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries, without fair and transparent process under the law.\n\nThe Department of State has determined the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the PRC government exists in the PRC.\n\nU.S. citizens traveling or residing in the PRC may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens in the PRC may be subjected to interrogations and detention without fair and transparent treatment under the law.\n\nForeigners in the PRC, including but not limited to businesspeople, former foreign-government personnel, academics, relatives of PRC citizens involved in legal disputes, and journalists have been interrogated and detained by PRC officials for alleged violations of PRC national security laws. The PRC has also interrogated, detained, and expelled U.S. citizens living and working in the PRC.\n\nPRC authorities appear to have broad discretion to deem a wide range of documents, data, statistics, or materials as state secrets and to detain and prosecute foreign nationals for alleged espionage. There is increased official scrutiny of U.S. and third-country firms, such as professional service and due diligence companies, operating in the PRC. Security personnel could detain U.S. citizens or subject them to prosecution for conducting research or accessing publicly available material inside the PRC.\n\nSecurity personnel could detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC, Hong Kong SAR, or Macau SAR governments.\n\nIn addition, the PRC government has used restrictions on travel or departure from the PRC, or so-called exit bans, to:\n\ncompel individuals to participate in PRC government investigations;\n\npressure family members of the restricted individual to return to the PRC from abroad;\n\nresolve civil disputes in favor of PRC citizens; and\n\ngain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.\n\nU.S. citizens might only become aware of an exit ban when they attempt to depart the PRC, and there may be no available legal process to contest an exit ban in a court of law. Relatives, including minor children, of those under investigation in the PRC may become subject to an exit ban.\n\nThe PRC government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment. If you are a U.S. citizen and choose to enter Mainland China on travel documents other than a U.S. passport and are detained or arrested, the PRC government may not notify the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Consulates General or allow consular access.\n\nCheck with the PRC Embassy in the United States for the most updated information on travel to the PRC. In some limited circumstances travelers to Mainland China may face additional COVID-19 testing requirements to enter some facilities or events.\n\nThe Department of State does not provide or coordinate direct medical care to private U.S. citizens abroad. U.S. citizens overseas may receive PRC-approved COVID-19 vaccine doses where they are eligible.\n\nDo not consume drugs in the PRC or prior to arriving in the PRC. A positive drug test, even if the drug was legal elsewhere, can lead to immediate detention, fines, deportation, and/or a ban from re-entering the PRC. PRC authorities may compel cooperation with blood, urine, or hair testing. Penalties for drug offense may exceed penalties imposed in the United States.\n\nDemonstrations: Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid demonstrations.\n\nXINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION, TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION, and TIBETAN AUTONOMOUS PREFECTURES\n\nExtra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence and surveillance, are common in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Tibet Autonomous Region, and Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Mainland China:\n\nEnter the PRC on your U.S. passport with a valid PRC visa and keep it with you.\n\nRead the travel information page for Mainland China.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nAvoid demonstrations.\n\nExercise caution in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.\n\nAvoid taking photographs of protesters or police without permission.\n\nKeep a low profile.\n\nIf you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify U.S. Embassy Beijing or the nearest U.S. Consulate General immediately.\n\nReview the China Country Security Report from the Overseas Security Advisory Council.\n\nDo not consume drugs in the PRC or prior to arriving in the PRC.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter. Follow U.S. Embassy Beijing on Twitter, WeChat, and Weibo.\n\nVisit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) page for the latest Travel Health Information related to the PRC.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.\n\nReview the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nExercise increased caution due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws.\n\nSummary: Hong Kong SAR authorities have dramatically restricted civil liberties since the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) imposed the Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR on June 30, 2020. Following the Hong Kong SAR government’s enactment of its own Safeguarding National Security Ordinance on March 23, 2024, Hong Kong SAR authorities are expected to take additional actions to further restrict civil liberties.\n\nThe 2020 National Security Law outlines a broad range of vaguely defined offenses, such as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance builds on this framework with additional vaguely defined offenses, such as treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets, sabotage against public infrastructure, and external interference. According to the legislation, these offenses are applicable to foreign nationals within the Hong Kong SAR and to individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, located outside its borders. Under these provisions, anyone who criticizes the PRC and/or Hong Kong SAR authorities may face arrest, detention, expulsion, and/or prosecution. Hong Kong SAR authorities are attempting to enforce these provisions against individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, residing outside of their jurisdiction by offering cash rewards for information leading to their arrests in the Hong Kong SAR.\n\nDual Nationality: The Hong Kong SAR government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment. If you are a dual U.S.-PRC citizen and enter Hong Kong SAR on a U.S. passport, and you are detained or arrested, PRC authorities are under an obligation to notify the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. Consulate General of your detention and to allow U.S. consular officials to have access to you. In practice, however, U.S. consular officers may be prevented from providing consular assistance, even to those who have entered on their U.S. passports. For more information, visit Consular Protection and Right of Abode in HK(SAR) for Dual Nationals - U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau.\n\nDemonstrations: Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges under the 2020 National Security Law and/or the 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid demonstrations.\n\nIf you decide to travel to the Hong Kong SAR:\n\nEnter the Hong Kong SAR on your U.S. passport and keep it with you.\n\nRead the travel information page for the Hong Kong SAR.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings.\n\nAvoid demonstrations.\n\nExercise caution in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.\n\nAvoid taking photographs of protesters or police without permission.\n\nKeep a low profile.\n\nIf you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau immediately.\n\nReview the China Country Security Report from the Overseas Security Advisory Council.\n\nDo not consume drugs in the Hong Kong SAR or prior to arriving in the Hong Kong SAR.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter. Follow U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nVisit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) page for the latest Travel Health Information related to the Hong Kong SAR.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.\n\nReview the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nMonitor local media, local transportations sites, and apps like MTR Mobile or Citybus for updates."
