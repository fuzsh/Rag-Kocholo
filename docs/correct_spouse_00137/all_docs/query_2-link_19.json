        "text": "With the Super Bowl just around the corner and no games on TV this past weekend, my husband and I turned to a movie to get our football fix. Our pick for the week was Gridiron Gang.\n\nThis inspirational movie is based on a true story about how football changes the lives of kids in a juvenile detention center.\n\nSean Porter (Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson), a probation officer at the center, was tired of watching the kids that came through his center leave with little hope of a better life. Turned back out onto the street many of these kids ended up back in the system or worse – dead.\n\nFootball, and a caring mother, had made the difference in Porter’s life. He was hoping that football could do the same for these kids so he fought to bring a football program to the center.\n\nStarting the program was a challenge, but, as you can imagine, a far sight easier that finding other teams willing to play a group of thugs and killers. But in the end he succeeded.\n\nWhat followed was an interesting story of how structure, teamwork and a shared goal bonded these boys together and transformed them from thugs into kids with heart.\n\nBut the transition wasn’t easy and eventually the past life of one of the players threatens to bring down the whole team.\n\nI was most impressed with Dwayne Johnson as Porter. I thought it was the first role where we got to see Johnson as an actor instead of The Rock. There were no raised eyebrows, no bring it hand gestures; just Johnson filling the shoes of the motivating Porter.\n\nL. Scott Caldwell (Lost‘s Rose) was a fabulous addition to the cast as the mother than never gave up on Porter.\n\nThe movie did a great job of wrapping up the story by telling you what happened to each of the players. I’ll warn you, it’s not all happy endings.\n\nOverall a feel-good story worth watching."
