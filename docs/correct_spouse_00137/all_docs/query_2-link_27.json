        "text": "Since Dick Caldwell was first sworn in to The Florida Bar, he has built a stellar legal career. As one of the firm’s three founding partners, he has spent 42 of those 50 years with the firm he helped build.\n\n“A scholarly and accomplished trial lawyer, Dick has played an integral role in the development of the firm’s reputation as a pre-eminent trial firm, particularly in the area of product liability,” said Managing Partner Frank Sheppard. “Dick worked hard traveling the country for years preparing for and attending some of the firm’s largest and most famous product liability trials. Despite having an extraordinarily busy schedule as a trial lawyer, he would always be willing to answer questions, mentor and train younger lawyers.”\n\nThe epitome of integrity and collegiality, Dick’s giving and supportive personality exemplifies the values that form Rumberger’s enduring culture. The firm is deeply indebted for his many and continuing contributions."
