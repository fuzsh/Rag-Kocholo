        "text": "Associate Professor Scott Davis is a physiologist who joined the faculty of Southern Methodist University in the Fall of 2010. He is the Director of the Applied Physiology Laboratory in the Department of Applied Physiology and Sport Management. He is also currently an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Neurology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. His neurophysiology laboratory is located within the Multiple Sclerosis Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.\n\nDr. Davis earned his Ph.D. in Exercise and Sport Science from the University of Utah in 2003. He completed a post-doctoral fellowship from 2003 to 2006 in Integrative Physiology at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.\n\nDr. Davis' major research area is the function and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system in healthy and clinical populations. The major focus of his research currently is autonomic dysfunction specifically related to thermoregulation and blood pressure control in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). His research is funded by grants from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Current grants examine the neural control of skin blood flow and sweating in MS patients and the ability of MS patients to maintain and control blood pressure and heart rate during stressors that cause blood pressure to drop. These research projects have profound implications for understanding both the biology of MS and potential causes of fatigue in patients who suffer from the disease.\n\nHe resides in Plano with his wife, Kristi-Ann, and his children, Jaxsen and Jenna.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nAutonomic function in multiple sclerosis\n\nNeural control of skin blood flow and sweating\n\nReinnervation and revascularization of grafted skin\n\nSignificant Publications\n\nDavis SL, Frohman TC, Crandall CG, Brown MJ, Mills DA, Kramer PD, Stuve O, and Frohman EM.
