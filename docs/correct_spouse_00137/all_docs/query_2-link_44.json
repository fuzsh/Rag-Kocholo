        "text": "Plot Summary\n\nLee Strobel was an acclaimed newspaper reporter who had seemingly reached a new level in his career with his in-depth research pieces. Everything in his life seemed perfect, until his wife Leslie began talking to a Christian nurse who saved the life of their daughter and became a Christian herself. Lee’s staunch atheism was immediately challenged by his wife’s beliefs, even though she had become a better person as a result. Thus, Lee set out to disprove the faith of his wife by attacking the core tenets of Christianity and skeptically investigating the truth behind them. However, the deeper he went into his investigation, the less faith he had in atheism. He would eventually have to come to grips with what he really believed and make a decision that would change his life forever.\n\nProduction Quality (3 points)\n\nAfter years of wandering in the proverbial wilderness, Jon Gunn and his team, aided by the new standards of PureFlix, have finally found the promised land. The Case for Christ is a flawless production in every aspect and is an example of what we should see in every film. Video quality, camera work, and audio quality are error free. The soundtrack is highly authentic and appropriate for the time. Sets, locations, and props are exquisite and demonstrate great care for historical accuracy. Finally, editing is excellent as montages are kept to a minimum and each scene transitions seamlessly. Basically, this is your textbook perfect production.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (2.5 points)\n\nWhat better plot to use than a real-life story that many audiences can relate to for multiple different reasons? Not only is this film about real people, but they are actually portrayed as real people through meaningful dialogue and realistic circumstances. This film could have easily descended into an information-saturated and message-heavy dump that tried too hard to push its point, but that is not the case here. Both the atheist and the Christian characters are portrayed extremely well and the highly relevant message is presented in such a way that it is both clearly understood and easily received without being pushed in your face. In the hands of a different writer, this idea could have gone south very easily. Yet it did not, and Brian Bird proves that with good content, he can go great things. The only nitpick to raise here is some slight choppiness, but it’s not a big deal. The bottom line is that this is an excellent plot and one well worth your time.\n\nActing Quality (3 points)\n\nYou can hardly ask for a better cast than this, as each member fits their character excellently. There are zero acting errors to point out as every performance is executed with near perfection. Emotions are highly believable and line delivery is on point. This rounds out an excellent film.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conjunction with Brian Bird, Jon Gunn has finally discovered his true talent and has struck gold. He put previous disappointments behind him and found a way to become a great film maker. All we ask of film makers is to show steady and consistent improvement, and Jon Gunn has done just that. He was also afforded a great opportunity to tell the amazing true story of Lee Strobel and to have better funding due to the better decisions made by the PureFlix leadership. This film gives Jon Gunn, Brian Bird, and the rest a platform to build off of to do even greater things.\n\nFinal Rating: 8.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAfter a tragedy takes their son from them, Stanley and Lisa’s marriage is on the rocks and they seemingly have no purpose in life. As they try to sort through what’s left of their son’s possessions, Lisa is given a mysterious lamp by one of her neighbors, who tells her that it has special powers. Though Stanley is skeptical and angry, Lisa chooses to believe that the lamp can help them. Little do they know what is coming to them next.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nFor the most part, The Lamp has good funding behind it that produces a decently above average production. All the typical elements are good, including video quality, camera work, and audio quality. The soundtrack is also intriguing. The editing is also fine as the story is presented well. However, the sets and locations are fairly limited to a handful of neighborhood areas, houses, and a baseball field. Also, the biggest nagging issue here is the use of odd special effects to ‘enhance’ the experience—yet they only end up coming off as cheesy. Overall, this is a good enough production, but the cheesy special effects tend to put a damper on things.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nBased on a novel by Jim Stovall, The Lamp is a very unique Christian storyline that, while it has an interesting point and purpose, it also has a slightly silly premise. The plot is somewhat slow to develop, but the dialogue improves as it goes and helps to build the characters. There is a good use of flashbacks, but they are sometimes too disorienting. As previously mentioned, though there is a good point here, there are also too many goofy magical elements that are introduced and only downplayed later. This makes for a confusing viewing experience. Also, in the end, things are fixed too easily, although there is an interesting twist that many will find interesting. Overall, many will enjoy the uniqueness of The Lamp and there’s certainly nothing wrong with it—we just feel it could have been better.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nAt first, the acting of this film is atrocious. Emotions are very extreme at first and there is far too much yelling in the first half hour. However, the acting does get better as it goes as the cast members settle into their roles better and deliver their lines more smoothly. In the end, it becomes an above average performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Lamp is a textbook average film—with good production backing, it looks good on the surface. It’s based on a book by a popular author, so that also works in its favor. It also has recognizable cast members. While average is awesome in the Christian entertainment market, we want movies to take that next step into greatness. It’s definitely difficult to do, but in the end, it’s so worth it.\n\nFinal Rating: 5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPlot Summary\n\nWhen the Campbells adopted little Joey from the struggling Porters, they thought it was forever. But when the Porters get back on their feet after Joey’s father gets out of jail, they file to regain custody of their son. Heartbroken, the Campbells do everything they can do to keep their only son, but they cannot prevail. Therefore, they resort to a drastic measure that could land them in prison, but they are committed to protecting their son from evil.\n\nProduction Quality (1 point)\n\nAs a pilot production from Jon Gunn and company, this production quality is not what it could be. But on a shoestring budget, it is not that bad. Camera work is sometimes shaky and video quality and lighting are sometimes poor. The standard soundtrack is sometimes loud enough to cover up dialogue, but audio quality is mostly fine. For a first-time effort, the sets and locations are quite realistic, even the international ones. The editing is a pretty good effort considering what they had to work with. In the end, every movie maker has to start somewhere, regardless of the budget or resources. When put in that perspective, Like Dandelion Dust is an applaudable effort.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1.5 points)\n\nBased on a novel by Karen Kingsbury, this plot is somewhat slow to develop and has one too many flat scenes and dead spots. Yet the story is true to the book and depicts unfortunately realistic happenings. Too much time tends to be spent on trashy elements, although what happens therein is believable. This film is a fair portrayal of real people and their struggles and highlights important issues with child welfare. Dialogue is mostly accessible and helps to build the characters. Unfortunately, the first three-fourths of the film may not hold the attention of most audiences. However, once it gets to the point at the end, it suddenly becomes really good and is worth the wait. Overall, Like Dandelion Dust improves at the end and shows great potential for the future.\n\nActing Quality (1.5 points)\n\nThis cast is semi-professional and mostly knows what they are doing. Through they are small, they have some bright spots, such as well-played and believable emotions. Their line delivery can be wooden at times, but overall, this is a good effort that shows talent in casting.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is always good to choose a book plot for your first film, but we have to wonder if this was the best Karen Kingsbury book to choose. The story is intriguing as a book, but it doesn’t translate very well to the big screen. Yet nonetheless, it is a good effort and something to build off of for the future. There is great potential in this team and we can’t wait to see what they have planned next.\n\nFinal Rating: 4 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
