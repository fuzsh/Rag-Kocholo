Scott Caldwell (born Laverne Scott, April 17, 1950) is an American actress known for her role as Rose on Lost.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn the middle child in Chicago, Illinois to working class parents, Laverne Scott grew up in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the South Side. At a high enrollment elementary school she attended the morning session, and her older siblings went to school in the afternoon.

While attending Hyde Park High School, she joined the drama club.\n\nHer class went to see a performance of A Day of Absence, featuring Douglas Turner Ward, a co-founder of The Negro Ensemble Company. It was the first time she saw professional black actors on stage. After graduating high school in 1967, she attended Northwestern University. She left after one year and went to work full-time as an operator at Illinois Bell. She got married and had a son. She transferred her credits to Loyola University-Chicago and earned a bachelor’s degree in Theater Arts and Communications.\n\nCareer\n\nCaldwell started her career in 1978 as a member of the famed Negro Ensemble Company, making her Broadway debut two years later in the Tony Award nominated play Home.
