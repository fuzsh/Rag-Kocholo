Where is your destructiveness, O Grave?\" God promises through his word the bible that he will recover our loved ones from death. He has the power and the desire to restore their life. He will destroy death, and it will no longer have power over us. I am very sorry for your loss.\n\nS\n\nStephanie Carver lit a candle\n\n//s3.amazonaws.com/skins.funeraltechweb.com/tribute-gestures/Candle.png\n\nMy deepest and sincere condolences go out to you and I pray that time help with the easement of your loss. I worked with Norman in Baltimore and just recently left there to pursue a job in Washington DC. I remember seeing Norman my last day and joking with him about him bring me my care packet from his garden. I know how how he love gardening.I am going to miss talking crap to him about the cowboys whipping up on them dirty birds. LOL. Sorry to hear about you Norm. You will sincerely and deeply be missed. My prayers are with you on your journey in the afterlife. Stephanie Carver\n\nB\n\nBob Byrd lit a candle\n\n//s3.amazonaws.com/skins.funeraltechweb.com/tribute-gestures/Candle.png\n\nNorm was my work leader until he moved upstairs and I could not have asked for a better person to work with. He was a hard worker and always had a smile on this face. He loved to brag about this garden, his Eagles and he loved this family. He would work 12 hours a day if he could Monday thru Thursday, he just wanted to be able to go home on Friday and that was fine with me. I know most of the guys in the shop marked their calendars for December and would wait for his wife's famous cookies. I know that I marked mine even after I retired. The last time I saw Norm, I came down to the yard for an FMA lunch and I had my four year old grand daughter with me. When she got out of the car she asked me if my friends were nice, The first person she met was Norm. After he walked away she said my friends are nice. From the mouths of babes. He is going to be missed but I will never forget him and our road trips to Galveston\n\nS\n\nSharon Byrd lit a candle\n\n//s3.amazonaws.com/skins.funeraltechweb.com/tribute-gestures/Candle.png\n\nSincere condolences to the entire Caldwell family. Norm was such a bright and positive person. He walked thru our office every morning wishing everyone a good morning. No matter what went on in his life Norm always had a smile on his face. My last time visiting the Yard for a retirement ceremony, who did I run into but Norm. And as usual he wore his huge smile. I'm so glad that I did see him. Norm loved walking thru the office bragging about his wife's chocolate chip cookies. They were the best ever! I will always think fondly of Norm. May he rest in peace.\n\nC\n\nCindy Stith lit a candle\n\n//s3.amazonaws.com/skins.funeraltechweb.com/tribute-gestures/Candle.png\n\nI met Norm through my sister Carrie Ward when she worked in bldg. 58 for the Yard. He always had a smile on his face. My sister and I would run around the base and see him doing his daily walks and always get a high five from him as we passed him. I'm sending him another high five and always keep on smiling!! He will be missed!!\n\nJ\n\nJames E. Scott Sr. posted a condolence\n\nMy friend who always joked with me about my hair or lack of it. I am retired and miss seeing him each day, he will be remembered. I miss the days when we would get off work and would race from red light to red light. We would meet every morning,he always had a smile, a joke, a kind word. He really cared about his co-workers. To his family my prayers and thoughts are forever with you. Remember this God do not make mistakes. Cherish the good memories that you have of him. Live each and every day like it is your last; because it might just be your last. Your life can be lost in a day, but it can also be cherished and celebrated in a breath. One breath of love, one breath of forgiveness,one breath of laughter,one breath of joy. Take that breath like it's your last; cherish and celebrate it. When you really think about, does anything else truly matter?\n\nD\n\nDerek Souder posted a condolence\n\nNorman was an awesome person to work with and be around. I started working with Norman in 2004 at the Coast Guard Yard. When working with Norman he loved his job and did not like slacking off or taking breaks! He gave me flack on many occasions! We talked often and mostly I loved giving him flack about the Eagles and he would taunt me about my Deadskins, as he would call them. Going to miss him calling me a \"Perp\" aka Perpertrator and Slapjaw! He will be missed! Condolences to his family and R.I.P. Norm. I will not forget you!\n\nR\n\nRalph S Willaims posted a condolence\n\nNorm I was looking forward to our game Philadelphia vs. Ravens this year. I returned from vacation to here you've gone. I only knew you for a short time but I knew you where a man of character and strength. Going to miss you brother. Anybody here seen my old friend Norm? Can you tell me where he's gone? He freed lotta people but it seems the good they die young I just looked around and he's gone Didn't you love the things that he stood for? Didn't he try to find some good for you and me? And we'll be free Some day soon, it's gonna be one day ---taken from the lyrics of Abraham, Martin and John\n\nJ\n\nJohn Kaplan posted a condolence\n\nI had the pleasure of working with and knowing Norman since I was transferred to the CG Yard in 2005. Norman was one of the most positive, happy people I have ever met! As a Captain in the Coast Guard my collar devices were eagles - Norman would tell me all the time that I must be an Eagles fan since I was always wearing eagles! I will never be the fan Norman was but in his honor I will be an Eagles fan! May God have mercy on his soul and bless and comfort his family and friends.\n\nW\n\nWillie A. Harrington posted a condolence\n\nMy most profound and deepest condolences are with the Caldwell family today, tomorrow, and forever. Since I have a commitment that will prevent me from attending Norman's home going, May GOD keep and watch over you all. The Coast Guard Yard is planning a contingent to attend the service. Norm's positive attitude and smile was a refreshing part of the day here at the Yard. I did not see him everyday, but when I did, the vibes were ALWAYS positive. He never spoke ill about others, (unless you talked about the Eagles). Then he would deal with you accordingly. Mortality is difficult to deal with at times, especially when someone as vibrant as Norm has gone. Rest with the lord my friend until we meet again. Respectfully submitted: Andre' Harrington\n\ng\n\ngeorge itzel posted a condolence\n\nEven in my retirement, I feel an a missing , a missing that comes with working with someone day in and day out, never a cross word, no job to big or to small. In Norm's own words we were the A team . We were together from when he came to the Yard til he made leader. I'm truly a richer man for having known Norman . . . .\n\nJ\n\nJohn Moore lit a candle\n\n//s3.amazonaws.com/skins.funeraltechweb.com/tribute-gestures/Candle2.png\n\nTo the Caldwell Family, Norman was my co-worker for 19 years at the Coast Guard and it is impossible to describe how I will miss his visits at the office. His can-do attitude was infectious as was his million dollar smile. It was not possible to be in a bad mood when he was around. Whether he was talking to you about his family, his day, his garden, his work, or his beloved Eagles, it was a pleasure, even though I sometimes teased him about his team. Although the suddenness of his passing is hard to accept, let his memory guide you as you plan your steps forward. I hope that his family can take some solace in knowing that his now in the hands of God."
