Growing up, I witnessed first-hand how meaningful his medical practice was to him. It was the energy and vibrancy of children that drew me into the specific field of pediatrics. That choice is reaffirmed daily in the exam room! I enjoy every age and developmental stage of children, and partnering with parents in the care of their child brings me so much joy.\n\nMy medical journey began as a pre-med student at Stanford University. After graduating with my bachelors, I attended medical school at the University of Kansas. Children's Mercy Hospital is where I began my pediatric journey, and it was there that I was recognized for excellence in primary care as a resident physician. Today, I give back to the residency program by mentoring residents in my clinic.\n\nI feel fortunate to call myself a wife, mother, and physician. I am the wife of a family medicine physician who shares my enthusiasm for fitness and the outdoors; I am the mother of three adult children. Among many interests, I enjoy CrossFit, open-water swimming, challenging hikes and skiing, and I am an avid reader who enjoys a great thriller.\n\nPatient Review:\n\n\"Dr. Ehly's focus on preventative healthy and preparing babes for a bright, healthy future is contagious.\"\n\n- Amber\n\nMake an appointment with Dr. Ehly at our Plaza office.

I am honored to be part of this rich history and excited to be involved in its future.\"\n\nBiography:\n\nWhen my AP Biology teacher in Omaha, Nebraska asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up, the answer was easy. I told him I wanted to teach. His eyes were soft and suggesting, when he replied, \"Yes, you would be a fine teacher. Have you ever thought about teaching medicine? You have quite the knack for science.\"\n\nThat simple quip opened my mind to possibilities. At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, I poured into my studies with a new goal. I fought for opportunities and experiences that I would have otherwise missed. And less than a decade later, I had reached the goal that he had sparked when I graduated from the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nI learned how to be a pediatrician at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. My attending physicians instilled the importance of relationships and teamwork while caring for children. I was able to learn about each patient family, honoring them as individuals while offering state of the art medical treatments. I was inspired by children fighting through hardship and ready to celebrate when healing came. Pediatric is indeed is a remarkable job.\n\nToday, I share evidenced-based child expertise blended with clinical experience. I do this in the office during my time in clinical care, but also using various digital and traditional media outlets to promote child health and wellness.\n\nI have been able to work in science communication through my role as National Spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics and a member of the Council of Communications and Media for the AAP. I am a regular contributor to NBC Learn's Parent Tool Kit, US News and World Report, and our local KCUR. I am passionate about vaccinations for our community's children and serve on Missouri's Advisory Committee for Childhood Immunizations. I am also a nationally recognized speaker in health innovation, health care social media, vaccine advocacy, and media use with children.\n\nI am fueled by my husband, Dr. Kevin, and our two dynamic kids. As a family, we love to travel and share new adventures. Kevin and I also like to golf and are in a couples league in the spring and summer. And in my second life, I would be a race car driver. I love to watch Formula 1 racing and have taken sport driving classes across the Country.\n\nIf I'm not in the office, find me at KCKidsDoc.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

And no greater honor than to be entrusted with the health and wellness of both.\"\n\nBiography:\n\nMy journey to pediatrics is one that came full circle.\n\nI grew up in a community of 70 people in southeast Nebraska and am one in the last generation to attend a country schoolhouse; grades K-8th, three teachers and 30 children. It was a unique experience and spoke toward my family's heritage of farming, hard work, pride in community and love of family.\n\nIn high school, I was able to see a surgical operation at the local hospital. I was hooked. I knew at that moment -- medicine was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.\n\nFrom there I went to college and was able to play college basketball. I then moved on to the University of Nebraska Medical Center where I fell in love with my wife Natasha and the profession of Pediatrics. We married after graduation and then moved to Cincinnati Ohio to further our skills in pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Medical Hospital.Â\n\nOnce our three-year residency was complete, we moved to Kansas City to be closer to family and to start our careers. I found myself at Pediatric Associates, being hired by the brother of my teacher from that small country schoolhouse. At that moment, I knew I was where I was supposed to be, and we (both Natasha and I) have both been at Pediatric Associates ever since.\n\nNatasha and I now have a family of our own, including our two children and 1 French bulldog. As a family we enjoy traveling, exploring the world around us and going on adventures together. In my free time, I continue to play basketball, practice photography and enjoy SCUBA diving.\n\nI love my job as a pediatrician, our community, and this practice. I look forward to meeting you.\n\nPatient Review:\n\n\"I respect and appreciate Dr. Kevin's style which has been helpful in getting our children to eat, sleep, and behave well.

I love that my job allows me to know and work with such wonderful patients and families. Every child is different, and those differences are part of what makes my job so interesting and rewarding! I aim to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent illness as a child grows. Topics you will hear me focus on include pediatric nutrition, sleep and behavior. I strongly recommend the CDC vaccination schedule as part of my preventive care for my patients and our community.\n\nI grew up in northeast Kansas in a large family. I have lived in Kansas City since moving here to attend Rockhurst University for my undergraduate education. I graduated from KCU medical school and completed residency at Children's Mercy Hospital.\n\nMy husband, Michael, and I have 3 amazing kids (two girls and a boy).

After graduating from high school in the area, I attended Kansas State University. I went on to medical school at Des Moines University followed by pediatric residency at Children's Mercy Hospital. I completed an additional year as chief resident before starting at Pediatric Associates in 2016.\n\nThere are countless reasons why I love pediatrics, but it comes down to forming relationships and providing care through each stage of development. My role allows me to celebrate with families during times of wellness, but also be available during times of need. I think it's important to stay up-to-date with ever-evolving medical advancements and relay this information to my patients. In general, I focus quite a bit on preventative medicine, and I enjoy caring for children and teenagers with asthma and allergies.\n\nMy husband, Brett, and I are lucky parents of three daughters. In addition to keeping us on our toes, we learn something new from our girls everyday. Parenting is such a gift!

I will continue to strive to optimize both the physical and mental health of all my patients, in a fun and relaxing environment.\"\n\nBiography:\n\nI grew up in a small town in northwest Iowa, where a sense of community was highly valued. After completing my medical education and training, I desired to practice in a setting where physicians, medical staff, families, and patients worked together to both optimize their health and that of the community around them. I found Pediatric Associates and the Kansas City metro area to be that place!\n\nI graduated from Creighton University with a degree in Exercise Science. During my studies, I learned the importance of promoting and achieving healthy lifestyles. I attended medical school at Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine in Parker, Colorado and was excited to return to the Midwest to complete my residency training at Children's Mercy Hospital.\n\nThe most significant part of being a pediatrician is getting to be a small part of helping families grow and thrive while maintaining a calming presence for them when questions or illnesses arise. I strive to keep up on the latest evidence and research but value the personal insight that families bring to their visits. I genuinely believe that I have the best, and most fun, job! I am always amazed at the resiliency of children.\n\nIn our free time, my husband and I enjoy traveling, working on home projects, playing with our dog, and cooking.

Taking care of kids gives me complete joy, and I always attempt to return the favor by incorporating enthusiasm and humor into each visit. While I pride myself on being a well-rounded pediatrician, I have a particular interest in allergies, asthma, mental health, development, and sports medicine. I serve as a medical volunteer for a week each summer at a camp for children with cancer.\n\nMy wife, Emily, is a school psychologist at a local school. Emily and I love serving the community that we grew up in. We have a son who brings us immense happiness every day and he certainly has made me a better pediatrician.
