He is a son of Thomas and Eliza (Reddick) Welch, and grandson of John Welch, who was a native of North Carolina, and at an early date immigrated to Tennessee. He resided in Weakley County, Tenn., a number of years, and then came to Dent County, Mo., locating six miles west of the county seat, where he died about 1857, at the age of ninety years. He was a soldier in the war of 1812, with Gen. Jackson. Thomas Welch was born in Tennessee in 1812, was married in\n\nWeakley County, of that State, and then came to Dent County, Mo., the same year as his father. He settled on Dry Fork, six miles from Salem, where he now resides. He was the owner of 600 acres of land, but being of a benevolent disposition, has given it all to his children. He is yet living, and is one of the pioneer settlers of Dent County. When first settling there his nearest neighbor was forty miles south, and he would frequently go twenty miles to a house raising, and twenty-five and thirty miles to mill. His wife, Eliza (Reddick) Welch, died in 1852, and after her death Mr. Welch married Mrs. Caroline Jadwin, nee Howell, daughter of Christopher Howell. Thomas Welch is the father of twelve children, seven by the first marriage and five by the second, all of whom lived to be grown: Melissa, wife of Joseph M. Howell; Joseph M. (deceased); John C., Thomas J., Eliza, wife of Jasper Plank; Jane, wife of J. S. Cooley; Phoebe E., wife of W. C. Inman; Current R., General A., James G., Josephine, wife of Samuel Skeeters, and Albert S. John C. Welch attained his growth on a farm, and made his home with his parents until the breaking out of the late war, when he cast his destinies with the South. In 1861 he enlisted in Freeman's company, Missouri State Militia, for six months, but at the end of six months he was captured and taken to Alton where he was retained until September 1862. He was then exchanged, and enlisted in Company F, Ninth Missouri Infantry, as orderly-sergeant. After the fight at Pleasant Hill he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, and surrendered at Shreveport, La., in June, 1865. In December of the following year he married Miss Martha E. Wofford, daughter of Smith Wofford, and a native of Middle\n\nTennessee, born in 1846. To this marriage were born seven children: James C., Thomas F., William G., Joseph M., Iona, Bertha, Walter H. After the war Mr. Welch resumed farming, and continued at this until 1886, when he was elected collector of Dent County, by a majority of 262, on the Democratic ticket. He is a member of the I. O. O. F., and his wife is a member of the Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nHistory of Laclede, Camden, Dallas, Webster, Wright, Texas, Pulaski, and Dent Counties - 1889 - by Goodspeed Publishing Co.\n\nRansom Reddick, of Dent County, Missouri, was born in Weakley County, Tennessee, in 1830, and is the son of David and Mary B. (Martin) Reddick, who were born in South and North Carolina in 1789 and 1794, and died in Dent County, Mo., in 1851 and 1884, respectively. The father was of Dutch descent, and came to Missouri in December 1837, where he spent the remainder of his days. Mrs. Reddick made her home with her son Ransom after his marriage, and from early womanhood was a member of the Baptist Church. All of her children grew to maturity, and Ransom is her ninth child. He has resided in Mo., since his seventh year, and\n\nmade his home with his parents until his fathers death, and two years later was married to Miss Susan W. Inman, who was born in Williamson County, Tennessee, in 1835, and is a daughter of Ezekial and Lillie Inman, who came to Missouri, in 1839. To Mr. and Mrs. Reddick two children were born, James W., being the only one living. He is married, resides with his parents, and tills the home farm. In July 1862, Mr. Reddick enlisted in Company E, Missouri Infantry, and served as a private for about two years, when he returned home, and was engaged in farming and mining in Phelps County one year. He then gave the whole of his attention to farming and stock raising until 1871, when he came to Salem, and was engaged in hauling iron ore for two years. From that time until 1879 he farmed in Phelps County and at the latter date returned to Salem, and kept a boarding house in connection with his teaming. Since 1880 he has resided on his present farm, which now consists of 179 acres, with 110 acres under cultivation. His land is well improved, with good buildings and he has just erected a barn 30 x 50 feet. His wife is a member of the Christian Church, and he is a Democrat, and cast his first presidential vote for Buchanon.\n\nHISTORY OF HICKORY, POLK, CEDAR, DADE AND BARTON COUNTIES, MISSOURI, 1889. published by Goodspeed, 1889; Pgs. 737, 738\n\nJudge Jerome Napoleon Gunier was born in Detroit, Mich., in 1824, and there made his home until 1837, when he went to Marion County, Ohio, and began working on a farm, and afterward learned the plasterer’s trade. In 1844 he removed to Howard County, Ind., and helped to roll logs where the public square of Kokomo is now situated. The Miami Indians were very numerous at that time. In 1846 Mr. Gunier married Miss Mary Adaline Inman, who was born in Erie County, Penn., in 1830, and the following children are the result of their union: Elizabeth, wife of Alexander Younger; Charles; Abigail, wife of Samuel Street, a harness-maker of Stockton; Viola, Stringer; Martha Jane, wife of Frank Lorton; Andrew J., Frances M., Mary Jane, Mina, and Ida, wife of Charles Wright. In 1858 Judge Gunier removed from Indiana to Cedar County, Mo., and located near Stockton, where he has since resided. He farmed and worked at his trade until 1878, then followed farming alone until 1886, when he was elected Probate Judge of Cedar County, on the republican ticket, of which party he has been a member for many years, having been a Democrat previous to the war. In August, 1862, he enlisted in Company A, Fifteenth Missouri Cavalry, U.S.A., the regiment taking part in the fights at Springfield, and was with Price and Shelby on their famous raids. He was orderly sergeant of his company, being promoted after enlisting, and was discharged at Springfield\n\non the 30th of June, 1865. He is now a member of the Hubbard Post No. 194, G.A.R. His father, Charles Gunier, was born in Upper Canada, and afterward moved to Detroit, Mich., where he carried on an extensive cooperage business. He was a soldier in the War of 1812, being under Col. Lewis Cass, the Democratic candidate for president in 1848. He surrendered with Gen. Hull. During the war his wife, Elizabeth (Metta) Gunier, and his children staid [sic] in Fort Detroit for safety, and his eldest son was born there. Charles afterwards participated in the Black Hawk War.

September 18, 1959\n\nSixth '59 Fatality in Springfield\n\nSunday Crashes Kill 3 Persons\n\nHigh speed accidents yesterday in Springfield, near Aurora, and Rolla, left three persons dead, 13 injured, and rocketed the traffic death toll in the Ozarks during October to nine.\n\nSpringfield's sixth fatality for the year was reported and the year's total for the area was increased to 135 dead. The in-city tragedy came just eight days after the death of a youthful bicyclist.\n\nDying yesterday were:\n\nPierson Inmon, 50, 729 West Tampa; Ronald Warren Waddle, 21, Billings; Olin S. Shaw, Jr., 16, Lemay.\n\nPolice and state troopers noted that in the three fatalities, high speed was the primary factor in causing the crashes.\n\nThe outburst of violent death on the highways and streets Sunday followed two traffic deaths Saturday and two Friday, all of which also involved high speeds.\n\nInmon, a driver for the Dickey Transfer Company and who also drove a Springfield Newspapers, Inc. delivery truck to Monett on Sundays, died in a fiery crash at the intersection of Dollison and Walnut about noon. The crash hospitalized four other persons with burns.\n\nTaken to St. John's Hospital and in satisfactory condition today are Wallace Flanigan, 18, Route 8, driver of the car in which Inmon was riding; Alva Lee Payton, 40, 801 North Rogers; Olman Herbert Freeman, 45, 801 North Rogers. Taken to Burge Hospital was Bill Wilbanks, 30, 801 North Rogers. All received second and third degree burns on the body and other possible injuries.\n\nSgt.

Freeman said he held his breath although the car was engulfed in flames, and tried to reach Inmon, whose clothing was burning.\n\nFreeman had to abandon the rescue attempt, however, and climb to safety. Firemen summoned to the scene set the car upright and extinguished the flames. Police said the firemen made an attempt to get Inmon out of the car but were prevented from doing so by intense heat.\n\nInmon's body was identified by A. L. Dickey, owner of the transfer company for which he worked. Police were not certain today as to what action would be taken against Flanigan, but were certain he would be charged because of negligence involved in the crash.\n\n* * *\n\nCoroner Ralph Thieme said an inquest into Inmon's death will be held at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the Greene County Courthouse.\n\n* * *\n\nInmon is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two sons, Gene, of the home, and J.

This is not something that happened in Los Angeles or Chicago, but it came to us, for some men have not taken the time to evaluate the things of life.\n\nI would far rather be Jerry - than the man that fired the bullet, for he must find himself in the damnation of the law.\n\nWith these emotion-filled words, and in an emotion-filled voice, Dr. David Cavin today delivered the eulogy of Greene County Deputy Sheriff Jerry Lee Inman, who was shot to death Saturday at the age of 27.\n\n* * *\n\nThe services were held in the spacious chapel of the High Street Baptist Church, and besides several hundred friends, large contingents of the Greene County Sheriff's office, Springfield Police Department and State Highway patrol, were present to pay their respects.

Decency must remain on the throne if society is to exist...\n\nIt would be a crime to what has already been committed if we do not learn something from this terrible ordeal. At 10 minutes after 3 last Saturday, my phone rang. It rings often at night, and most of it is bad news, for under cover of darkness, bad things happen. I could hardly believe my ears when I heard Jerry had been killed. I was asked to tell the parents.\n\nI asked myself, What could I say to them? How anything I could say could equate such a tragedy? But I will remember all my life the words of his mother afterward.\n\nShe said, Dr. Cavin, thank God for God's promises. If we didn't have them, we couldn't have anything. We can't have Jerry again. But we have God's promises. \n\nA great bank of flowers flanking the casket paid silent tribute to the deputy sheriff.
