        "text": "What to do if you have emergency unmet needs following a disaster\n\nIf you are affected by a natural disaster, in the days following the disaster and throughout the recovery period, it is important to monitor news reports and other media sources for information about where to get emergency housing, food, first aid, clothing, and financial assistance. Missourians who are affected should continue to listen to instructions from their local leaders on seeking assistance.\n\nIndividual Assistance following a disaster\n\nFEMA’s Individual Assistance program provides money or direct assistance to qualifying individuals, families and businesses in an area whose property has been damaged or destroyed and whose losses are not covered by insurance. It is meant to help those who qualify with critical expenses that cannot be covered in other ways. The assistance is not intended to restore damaged property to its condition before the disaster.\n\nWhile some housing assistance funds are available through FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program, most disaster assistance from the federal government is in the form of loans administered by the Small Business Administration.\n\nAssistance Programs may include: low- interest loans, Individual and Family Grant (IFG) Program, veterans benefits, temporary housing assistance, tax refunds, excise tax relief, unemployment benefits, free legal counseling, and crisis counseling.
