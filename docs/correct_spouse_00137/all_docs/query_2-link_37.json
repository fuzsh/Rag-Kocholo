        "text": "Maria Mileaf (Sakharam Binder and Private Jokes, Public Place) directs the two-hander at 59E59 Theaters for the Off-Broadway troupe. The work began performances March 15 for a run currently slated through April 24.\n\nGoing to St. Ives follows the story of a \"mother of a monstrous dictator in sub Saharan Africa [who] questions the very nature of her motherhood while on a medical visit to the UK,\" according to show materials.\n\nCaldwell — who earned a Tony Award for her turn in Joe Turner's Come and Gone — has recently been seen in a recurring role on ABC's \"Lost.\" The actress also appeared on Broadway in Proposals, A Month of Sundays and Home. Other credits include Macbeth, The Piano Lesson, Boesman and Lena, A Raisin in the Sun, American Medea, A Play of Giants, The Piano and From the Mississippi Delta.\n\nBenesch played the prospective third wife Holga in the Michael Mayer revival of the Arthur Miller drama After the Fall earlier this season at the Roundabout Theatre Company. She also appeared in The Deep Blue Sea on Broadway, Salome Off-Broadway as well as Mrs. Warren’s Profession (The Guthrie Theatre), Sight Unseen (Long Wharf Theatre) and opposite Gene Wilder in Don’t Make Me Laugh (Westport Country Playhouse).\n\nThe design team for Going To St. Ives features Neil Patel (scenic), Ann Hould Ward (costume), David Lander (lighting) with original music by Michael Roth. Playwright Blessing is the author of over twenty plays including A Walk In The Woods, Thief River, Cobb, Chesapeake, Eleemosynary and Down the Road. His works Fortinbras, Lake Street Extension, Two Rooms and the world premiere of Patient A were featured in the 1992-93 Signature Theatre season. Other plays include Black Sheep, The Winning Streak, Independence, Riches, Oldtimers Game and Nice People Dancing To Good Country Music.\n\nPrimary Stages announced recently that it will launch its upcoming 2005-2006 season in July with the New York premiere of Terrence McNally's Dedication or the Stuff of Dreams. Michael Morris directs the work starring Marian Seldes. The season will then continue with the east coast premiere of Charles Grodin's The Right Kind of People, directed by Chris Smith — artistic director of San Francisco's Magic Theatre, where the work debuted Nov. 2004."
