        "text": "SAN DIEGO - Snell & Wilmer represented Georgia-based client Vizzia Technologies, a leading provider of hardware-agnostic, full-service real-time location systems (RTLS) platforms designed for healthcare and hospital applications, in its sale to HID, a worldwide leader in trusted identity solutions. The addition of Vizzia Technologies expands HID’s offering and relevance in the Healthcare RTLS space, including support for asset management and tracking, as well as other use cases designed to meet the unique needs of healthcare facilities.\n\nFounded in 2005 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Vizzia Technologies is now part of HID’s Identification Technologies Business Area. The Vizzia solution will merge into HID’s Internet of Things Services (IOTS) Business Unit and benefit from HID’s sales and other global functions to support its offering.\n\nIn a recent press release, Andrew Halasz, CEO of Vizzia Technologies, stated “At Vizzia, we have built a strong presence in providing outstanding technologies and services to our customers in the Healthcare space. We are excited to begin our next chapter with HID and look forward to combining forces to increase our market presence and leadership in this vertical that touches everyone’s lives.”\n\nPartner Bardia Moayedi led the Snell & Wilmer team advising Vizzia Technologies in the deal. The diverse team included Katherine McCaig, Sarah Hibbard, Christopher Franich, William Kastin, Bahar Schippel, Greg Gautam, Brook Barnes, Clint Engleson, Brett Johnson, Troy Galan, and Paralegal Scott Drake.\n\nSnell & Wilmer’s mergers and acquisitions attorneys are well-versed in providing strategic, innovative legal and business services for complicated corporate transactions. They have extensive experience with transactions in a variety of industries, including highly regulated industries where the intersection of business and government requires a particularly strategic and risk-sensitive approach.

Snell & Wilmer’s clients include sellers, buyers, investors, banks and bankers, venture capital firms, private equity firms, institutional lenders, independent directors and committees, management groups, creditors, and creditor committees.\n\nAbout Snell & Wilmer"
