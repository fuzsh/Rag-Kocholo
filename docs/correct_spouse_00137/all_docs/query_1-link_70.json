        "text": "The Dean’s List is issued at the end of the fall and spring semesters based on all final course grades and recognizes superior academic achievement. It includes all full-time, degree-seeking students in Newcomb-Tulane College who have:\n\na semester grade point average of 3.700 or better\n\nwho have earned no grade below a “C” during the same semester (excluding courses taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis)\n\nRead the full NTC academic policies.\n\nStudents with incompletes or missing grades will not be listed on Dean’s List until all of their grades are in, the student can notify ntcdean@tulane.edu to let us know if their completed grades would make them eligible for the Dean’s List. If a student did not receive an email informing them of their place on the Dean's List, it is possible they previously opt-ed out of receiving NTC emails. Please check your inbox for the last NTC email received, then 'Update/Manage Your Subscription Preferences' in the footer link to opt back into receiving our emails.\n\nStudents are listed in alphabetical order by last name. If a student does not see their name listed, please advise them to update their Confidentiality Flag link in Gibson Online and email ntcdean@tulane.edu to alert us of this change.\n\n*This is updated as of May 23, 2024. We will update once all final grades are posted."
