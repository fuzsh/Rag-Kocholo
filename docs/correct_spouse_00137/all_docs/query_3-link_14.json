In 1662, the\n\nBlennerhasset family sold the castle to James Caldwell, who renamed it and whose descendants lived there for\n\nover 200 years. The remains include two of the hawn's flankers, a boathouse and a quay, and a ruined Protestant\n\nchurch. The latter was bulit by Francie Blennerhasset in 1641, and during later use as a family chapel, acquired\n\nsome interesting monuments. The English traveller Arthur Young enjoyed the hospitality of James Caldwell in\n\n1776. Beside the road is the Fiddler's Stone, a monument raised to a drunken fiddler who fell from a boat and\n\ndrowned while travelling with Sir James' band in 1770. The whole of this area at the northwest corner of Lough\n\nErne is classed as a region of outstanding natural baeuty. As well as being a forest park, it is also a reserve under\n\nthe control of a RSPB warden who watches over the thriving local wildlife.\n\nVirginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 19, pp 92-94 Our [John Roger and Elias B. Caldwell--cousins]\n\ngrandfather emigrated from Scotland to Ireland soon after King William's conquest of that place [ie. Scotland--\n\nKing William III of England; 1650-1702]. Our grandfather, John Caldwell, was born in Ireland and was there\n\nmarried to a Margaret Phillips (our grandmother). He remained there until they had five children, at which time\n\nhe got three of his brothers-in-law, who had married his sisters, to come to America with him (to wit) Moor,\n\nRitchey, and Dudgeon. Wll:[?] of whom I well remember and one brother-in-law who married his wife's sister\n\nwhose name was Dougherty, grandfather of my wife and Thomas Dougherty formerly clerk to the lowest house of\n\nCongress. They set sail together and landed in Delaware the very day that King George II was proclaimed there\n\n[King George II of England; 1683-1760]. From thence they got up the country to a place in Pa., then, called\n\nChestnut Level. Our grandfather naturally of an enterprising spirit, explored the country southwesterly from a\n\nplace in Va. to Albemarle Co. to which he moved and was soon followed by all his kindred.\n\nThere he lived some years; there our grandfather died and his oldest son and my mother-his only daughter-were\n\nmarried.\n\nThey and their companions moved with him to Roanoke River and the fine lands there explored the country\n\nwesterly until his followers fixed on a fine level waterly spot not 30 miles outside any inhabitants, to which place\n\nhim and his sons and brothers-in-law moved about the year 1742-43.\n\nThey were soon after joined by other friends mostly from Ireland or Pa. until they formed a little settlement which\n\nwas known and always called Caldwell Settlement. For thirty years after father was the first Justice of the Peace\n\nand his oldest son the oldest militia officer that was ever appointed under King George II within 25 miles of that\n\nplace in that neighborhood. I was born and in it was married and had six children before I moved to Ky in the\n\nyear 1781.\n\nOur grandfathers children were William, Thomas, David, all are buried in the same graveyard with their father.\n\nDavid's widow and all the family moved to Ky. Uncle John went to So. Carolina and died there. Uncle William's\n\nwidow and all that family went also to So. Carolina. Our friend John C. Calhoun is a son of the 2nd daughter of\n\nthat family.\"\n\n(signed by) Cousin John Roger\n\nMore About CAPTAIN JOHN CALDWELL:\n\nBurial: Unknown, Cub Creek Presbyterian Church Cemetery, Charlotte County, Virginia\n\nImmigration: 10 Dec 1727, Newark, Delaware, possibly on the ship Eaglewing\n\nMember: Elder, church of Rev.

Caldwell; subject-the Caldwell family).\n\n\"Our [John Roger and Elias B. Caldwell--cousins] grandfather emigrated from Scotland to Ireland\n\nsoon after King William's conquest of that place [ie. Scotland--King William III of England; 1650-\n\n1702]. Our grandfather, John Caldwell, was born in Ireland and was there married to a Margaret\n\nPhillips (our grandmother). He remained there until they had five children, at which time he got\n\nthree of his brothers-in-law, who had married his sisters, to come to America with him (to wit) Moor,\n\nRitchey, and Dudgeon. Wll:[?] of whom I well remember and one brother-in-law who married his\n\nwife's sister whose name was Dougherty, grandfather of my wife and Thomas Dougherty formerly\n\nclerk to the lowest house of Congress. They set sail together and landed in Delaware the very day\n\nthat King George II was proclaimed there [King George II of England; 1683-1760]. From thence\n\nthey got up the country to a place in Pa., then, called Chestnut Level. Our grandfather naturally of\n\nan enterprising spirit, explored the country southwesterly from a place in Va. to Albemarle Co. to\n\nwhich he moved and was soon followed by all his kindred.\n\nThere he lived some years; there our grandfather died and his oldest son and my mother-his only\n\ndaughter-were married.\n\nThey and their companions moved with him to Roanoke River and the fine lands there explored the\n\ncountry westerly until his followers fixed on a fine level waterly spot not 30 miles outside any\n\ninhabitants, to which place him and his sons and brothers-in-law moved about the year 1742-43.\n\nThey were soon after joined by other friends mostly from Ireland or Pa. until they formed a little\n\nsettlement which was known and always called Caldwell Settlement. For thirty years after father\n\nwas the first Justice of the Peace and his oldest son the oldest militia officer that was ever\n\nappointed under King George II within 25 miles of that place in that neighborhood. I was born and\n\nin it was married and had six children before I moved to Ky in the year 1781.\n\nOur grandfathers children were William, Thomas, David, all are buried in the same graveyard with\n\ntheir father. David's widow and all the family moved to Ky. Uncle John went to So. Carolina and\n\ndied there. Uncle William's widow and all that family went also to So. Carolina. Our friend John C.\n\nCalhoun is a son of the 2nd daughter of that family.\"\n\n(signed by) Cousin John Roger\n\nMore About JOHN ROGERS:\n\nMoved: 1781, From Virginia to Kentucky, afte rhe had 6 children in Virginia\n\n9\n\niii.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries,\n\nMissouri statutes provided specific guidelines for individuals finding and harboring lost cattle, horses, mules and\n\nother livestock. Before a person could take possession of the stray, he was required to post a notice of intent for at\n\nleast thirty days and pay a bond to ensure that the animal would not be disposed of in that time. After notices had\n\nbeen posted in public places for thirty days, the finder was required to file a notice with a justice of the peace,\n\nwho determined if the proper procedure was followed and collected a bond equal to the appraised value of the\n\nanimal. After one year, if the animal remained unclaimed, half of the bond was returned to the finder. The justice\n\nof the peace submitted lists which were provided to the county clerk, who posted the information in the stray\n\nbooks. http://198.209.8.166/sheproom/Records/strtoc.htm\n\n1843 Greene County, MO, tax list, ROBERT CALDWELL, 1 horse $35.
