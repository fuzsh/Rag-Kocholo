        "text": "This is so true and thank you for posting. So many people are hurt and killed annually due to distracted drivers. That text, post, check-in, etc. is not worth someone's life. Yes, it can happen to you. Yes, it happens to young people every hour of every day of every year. Why should my family members, friends, co-workers, etc. have to die just so someone can read a post five minutes earlier? Just put down your phone. So not worth it!\n\nCommunity of Christ is looking for a candidate with strong customer service and technical skills to join our IT team. If you or someone you know is looking for a rewarding position in an enriching environment, then see the position details below: https://lnkd.in/grzAxuEs See the following link for more information and detail: https://lnkd.in/gk8vtpA7 #hiring #hiringnow #community-of-christ #informationtechnology\n\nIn the latest update regarding the on-going disagreement between Epic and Apple... Fortnite out, Unreal Engine in. As there are a number of developers in the business world using the Unreal Engine for 3D modeling, architecture, etc., I am pleased to see the Unreal Engine is staying, at least for now, on the Apple Store. https://lnkd.in/ehA-WPR #epicgames #technologynews #applenews #3dmodel #architectural\n\nThe Quantum Computing race continues (slowly, but it's getting there...). The implications of this type of computing is still being imagined, but given time, it has the potential to change the face of computing as we know it today. \"Earlier this year, Honeywell said it beat IBM to the quantum volume milestone of 64. The field is collegial and somewhat academic, but the move signaled that traditional computing industry dynamics are at play. There's now a race afoot to make the fastest quantum computer. What makes the quantum computing competition different from most in the industry is that rivals are taking wildly different approaches. It's like a race pitting a horse against a car against an airplane against a bicycle.\" https://lnkd.in/dBXj4er #computing #physics #quantumcomputing"
