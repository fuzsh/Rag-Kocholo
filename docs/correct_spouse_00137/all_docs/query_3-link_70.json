        "text": "An endowed scholarship fund works like an investment account. A donor’s charitable gift is invested by the School of Medicine to generate income and gains. A portion of the account’s value (currently 5.3 percent) is available each year to benefit students enrolled in or intending to enroll in a degree program at the medical school. Scholarship availability often determines whether a potential student chooses Wake Forest University School of Medicine as their medical school.\n\nAn important goal for many donors is to establish their own legacy or to honor a loved one in perpetuity which can be accomplished in the naming of the scholarship — e.g., the Jane and John Smith MD Scholarship. Scholarship recipients will receive financial support throughout their medical school journey while being known as a Jane and John Smith, MD, Scholar. Because of the ongoing need for student financial support, you or your loved one’s legacy will be honored through the annual awarding of your scholarship while allowing students to realize their dream of helping others.\n\nOur endowed scholarship funds are invested for total return (income plus growth) in a balanced portfolio that typically includes stocks, bonds, real estate, cash equivalents, and other investments. Endowed funds are allocated among different asset classes depending on the economic climate at any given time. Good endowment management practices give the donor confidence the scholarship will always produce income and the purchasing power of that income will remain steady or even grow over time.\n\nBased on a simplified calculation using historic yearly returns of Wake Forest University’s endowment, a $100,000 charitable gift invested on July 1, 1989, would have generated more than $300,000 in income and would be grown in value to more than $300,655 in the 25 years that followed.\n\nNew endowed funds are governed by a simple fund agreement, signed by the donor and an official of the School of Medicine, which establishes permanent guidelines for the use of fund earnings and principal. Funds are audited periodically to ensure fund income is used as directed.\n\nYes, the School of Medicine provides annual reports to donors who establish endowed funds. These stewardship reports will update you on the value of your scholarship and how distributions from the fund are used and will include the name and class year of your scholar(s), as well as their photo and thank-you note. You will also be invited to the annual Scholars Brunch to meet your scholarship recipient(s).\n\nThat depends on what you want to accomplish. Generally speaking, gifts of any amount can be added to existing endowments while new named endowed funds may be established with gifts ranging from $50,000 to millions of dollars. A commitment of $50,000 is required to establish an endowed scholarship. We will work with you to identify opportunities that are consistent with your interests and capabilities.\n\nNo, multi-year pledges can be set up to fund the minimum or desired amount. Others – family, friends, colleagues – may also make gifts to your named fund at any time to add to its principal. Estate gifts can fund the endowed scholarship in its entirety or augment current gifts to grow the fund and scholarship award amount. The benefit of reaching the minimum funding level, thus generating an annual award, is to meet your scholar(s) annually.\n\nYes, you may make gifts to an endowed scholarship fund through your will, a retirement plan, annuities, life insurance or other assets. However, it is very important that you discuss your intentions with us in advance to make sure your gift is structured to accomplish your goals and to ensure that we fully understand your intentions.\n\nContact us to discuss in confidence the many charitable giving options available.\n\nTeri Lemons, Director of Alumni Philanthropy: 336-716-3928 \\ TLemons@WakeHealth.edu\n\nErika Friedel, Alumni Philanthropy Officer: 336-716-3275 \\ EFriedel@WakeHealth.edu\n\nOffice of Philanthropy and Alumni Relations, PO Box 571021, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1021"
