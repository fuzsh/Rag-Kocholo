        "text": "Growing up, my passion for cars was ignited just like any other kid's. Pouring through all the automobile magazines astonished how cars like this can perform like they do, listening to them as they drive by, and wondering what it would be like to own something like that. Fast forward to today, and I find myself living the ultimate childhood dream - driving and working with Porsche models every single day. But it gets even better because I have the privilege of turning others' dreams into a reality too.\n\nIt's been an exhilarating two decades on this journey, and I am eternally thankful to each and every client who trusts us with taking precious moments out of their busy lives to have us. We consider it an honor to be part of their automotive adventures.\n\nOur story goes back to 1964 when we first opened our doors. Ever since, we've proudly remained a tight-knit, family-owned and operated business. It's not just about cars for us; it's about the shared passion, the dedication, and the legacy we're building together.\n\nSo, if you're ready to embark on your own Porsche adventure and join our ever-growing automotive family, fasten your seatbelt, because the ride is about to get even more exciting. Welcome to a world where dreams are driven into reality, one Porsche at a time\n\nWith a passion for sports cars and a love to help people I want to be viewed as your trusted advisor to help facilitate purchasing your dream car.\n\nAs your liaison I take great pride in having impeccable product knowledge, and the ability to help your purchase a great one. I will dedicate my time to understand your unique needs and preferences, whether they're a seasoned Porsche enthusiast or a first-time buyer.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy attending Porsche events, taking my own Porsche out for a spin on the open road, and spending time with my wife and kids!\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2020\n\nI have been into cars for as long as I can remember. Growing up, my father always pushed me to understand how things work and why. This led me to discover a love for all things mechanical. My favorite brand of cars is and has always been Porsche. Every video game or movie with a 911 in it, I just had to have it. My passion for the Porsche brand led me to the opportunity to join the Hennessy team in January of 2022 as a service valet. I was thrilled and humbled to be promoted to the role of service advisor. It is my goal to ensure every client has a wonderful experience servicing with us. I am beyond grateful to have the opportunity to work with each of my customers and I am here to help in any way I can!\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2022\n\nI am an Atlanta native who has worked in the high line automotive industry since 1998 and pride myself on being my client's trusted resource. Having personally bought over 40 cars, boats, and motorcycles, I consider myself not only an enthusiast but also someone who is familiar with the excitement as well as the apprehension associated with the buying process. My goal is to provide my clients exceptional service in the form of attention to detail, integrity and product knowledge.\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2005\n\nMy passion for Porsche began as a child and culminated during my studies in Germany. Driving the world's best sports cars on the Autobahn and the Nordschleife hooked me for life. My love for cars is only rivaled by my desire to establish long-term relationships with my clients. I am a technical and detail-oriented Porschephile that sincerely believes that the big picture is the key to success in this industry. I speak fluent German and Spanish and am available for my clients 24/7 via email and text.\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2014\n\nI am a young and dynamic salesperson with a passion for helping clients achieve their goals. Growing up in northern Atlanta around a 1984 Carrera and several Boxster models, my interest in Porsche intensified. I have always been driven by a desire to excel in sales, and continue to hone my skills through hard work and dedication. I have a natural charisma and a gift for connecting with people, which I think helps make my clients dreams come true.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy sunny days at the skate park, spending time with family and friends, and revving engines to hear the differences in what they sound like.\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2016\n\nCars have always played a significant role in my life; my earliest childhood memories revolve around my fascination with all things car related. So a career in the automotive industry was a natural path for me.\n\nSince beginning my automotive career in 2006, I've had the honor of delivering countless luxury, performance, and exotic vehicles to clients from all over the world. My goal with every one of my clients is to build a lasting relationship. I work to thoroughly understand their wants, needs, and expectations. Then I deliver to make sure my clients have a genuinely memorable experience. I establish loyalty through my commitment to providing outstanding customer service every step of the way. I have had the pleasure of guiding many through their very first car purchase. I've also been trusted to manage several collectors' automotive portfolios. Each transaction is unique, and I handle every one of them with the highest level of care.\n\nAs a true automotive enthusiast, and having personally owned several Porsche cars, I am thrilled to be a member of the Hennessy Porsche Family. While away from the dealership, I enjoy spending time with family, attending car shows, and trying out different restaurants around Atlanta.\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2021\n\nI have seen Porsche introduce many milestone vehicles, from the 944 to the technical marvel of the 959. I've witnessed the launch of the Boxster and the first water-cooled 911 in 1998 as well as our four door Cayenne and Panamera. One high point for me was winning a trip to see Porsche compete at the Indy 500 in 1988. Having dinner with Al Holbert and Norbert Singer from Porsche Motorsport was an experience that I will never forget! All of these experiences have left me with an appreciation for the amazing vehicles Porsche creates. Looking back, I can say that the very best part of my 30+ years with Porsche was not the cars but the wonderful clients I have had the privilege to serve. Many have become my closest friends - my \"Porsche Family!\"\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 1982\n\nI have loved Porsche since I was a child riding in the back of my dad's 928. My passion for the Porsche brand is only rivaled by my passion for serving my clients. I am an active member of the Peachstate Porsche Club, and the liaison to the club for Hennessy Porsche. Let me show you how my enthusiasm for these cars and this brand will translate into a purchase experience unlike any you have ever had.\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2010\n\nI have been in and around the Automotive industry, in some form or fashion, just as long as I can remember. Riding along with my father to the different dealer locations in the northeast where my uncles owned a handful of dealerships as a boy. As soon as I was able and had the opportunity to work on my own to find a niche in the auto industry I took the shot. After about 16 years on my own at various different brands in the auto industry, landing here at Hennessy Porsche North Atlanta aligns perfectly with what I am looking for right now. The automobiles, the enthusiastic atmosphere and the owner loyalty to the brand and the heritage excites me.\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2014\n\nI have been in the automotive industry for over 15 years. I started my career off as a technician and then I turned my attention to writing service. Hennessy Porsche is an amazing company and I jumped at the opportunity to join the team. I strive every day to provide excellent service to every customer that comes through our doors. Please reach out to me if you need anything and I look forward to seeing you.\n\nDriving Porsche Passion Since 2022"
