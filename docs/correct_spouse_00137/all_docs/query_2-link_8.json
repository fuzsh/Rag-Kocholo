        "text": "Exclusive Private Practice First Look: Alfre Woodard, Richard Roundtree Come to Town!\n\nIt's time to meet Sam's mommy on Private Practice! Dee Bennett (Desperate Housewives and True Blood star Alfre Woodard) will come to town in the Tuesday, Oct. 30 episode (10/9c on ABC), in which she seeks out her son Sam's (Taye Diggs) help after her boss Raymond McCray (Shaft's Richard Roundtree) falls ill. TVGuide.com has the exclusive first look at the episode, which also features Lost's alum L. Scott Caldwell as Jillian McCray, Raymond's wife. Does Kate Walsh's exit mean the end of Private Practice? The Sam-centric hour will feature...\n\nThirteen Clues About the End of Lost: Does Ilana Age? Who's Coming Back? Who Isn't?\n\nLost executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse are known for cryptic answers. So it was a real treat for fans at the Paley Festival's Lost panel this weekend when they said a few things that sounded &mdash; weirdly enough &mdash; pretty straightforward. We've culled the 13 best clues from the discussion, in which Lindelof, Cuse and a few of the show's stars talked about who's returning, what old mystery might soon be solved, and the sideways version of reality in which Flight 815 landed just fine in Los Angeles. Needless to say, spoiler alert. Lost: How will Michael and Libby return?"
