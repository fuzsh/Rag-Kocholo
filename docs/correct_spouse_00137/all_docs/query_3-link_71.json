A graduate’s contributions and influence in his profession and community are also considered.\n\nMcCallie’s Alumni Achievement Awards are presented annually to graduates who have shown outstanding accomplishments in a chosen career and distinguished themselves professionally. Alumni are eligible to be nominated after their 15th reunion and are selected in accordance with their reunion-year cycle.\n\nThe True Blue Award honors an alumnus for \"distinguished service\" to his class. This award recognizes and thanks those whose exemplary gifts of time, outreach, and enthusiasm have been \"true blue\" in preserving the bonds of brotherhood for the class and keeping the long blue line running strong over the many years.\n\nSince 1905, McCallie men have left the Ridge and gone on to do amazing things. They represent McCallie with Honor, Truth, and Duty in numerous fields.\n\nBelow is a list of some of our most notable alumni. This list includes national politicians, artists of great renown, scientists credited with new discoveries, media moguls, hard working athletes, and sharp businessmen. This list is constantly growing as McCallie alumni are always accomplishing new things."
