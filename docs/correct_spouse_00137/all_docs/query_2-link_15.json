In the midst of cataclysmic social change, and keenly aware of their roles in the march of history, the key players in the winning campaign wrestle their most formidable opponent to date - Love. And as fate and feminism would have it, love truly does conquer all. The Colony has long been a vibrant center of L.A.'s theatre life. Its subscribers renew at an astounding rate of 90%, and in 2012 the theatre received nine OvationAward nominations, including the coveted one for Best Season. From its beginnings in 1975 as a 99-seat Equity-waiver theatre in Silver Lake, the company became so successful artistically, and built such a large subscriber base, that in 2000 it was able to move into a 270-seat state-of-the-art theatre created for it by the City of Burbank. As such, it became one of only a handful of mid-sized professional theatres in the L.A. area that produce a year-round season of plays and musicals, and that employ actors under contract with Actors' Equity Association.\n\nABOUT THE CREATIVE TEAM\n\nPEARL CLEAGE (Playwright) is an Atlanta-based writer, currently Mellon Playwright in Residence at The Alliance Theatre in Atlanta where What I Learned in Paris opened the 2012?2013 Season.

Her first novel, What Looks Like Crazy On An Ordinary Day, was an Oprah Book Club pick and spent nine weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. She is the author of thirteen plays, including Flyin' West, the most produced new American play in the country in 1994. Her Blues for an Alabama Sky was included in the 1996 Olympic Arts Festival in Atlanta and will receive a 20th anniversary revival at the Alliance in 2015. Her other plays includeChain; Late Bus to Mecca; Bourbon at the Border; A Song for Coretta, and The Nacirema Society Requests the Honor of Your Presence at a Celebration of Their First One Hundred Years.
