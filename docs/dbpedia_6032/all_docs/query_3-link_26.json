        "text": "Big Thanks to Andrew Staples for inviting me to speak on the Innovation Quotient podcast by The Economist to address Financial Inclusion, a cause I have dedicated nearly a decade and a half of my life towards building in India. And, it was an honor to be on the podcast with Patrick Saidu Conteh PhD, CEO of Africa Fintech Network who envisions a future where harmonized policies can make it easier for fintechs to operate across all countries in Africa. As Patrick shared on the podcast, “I want people to see Africa as a country and not as a continent.” When people often reference building for the ‘next billion’ – India comes to mind immediately but the population of the entire African continent is 1.4 billion, and at about 10 times the size of India, it presents an even bigger opportunity for all. The other aspect that was motivating to hear about from Patrick was about the importance of building homegrown capital for the best long-term interest instead of reliance on overseas funding. With this conversation, I am left inspired of all that can be - you can hear more from us by clicking this link: https://lnkd.in/grebFyPj #financialinclusion #India #Africa #AfricaRising #AfricanInnovation #growth #futurefinance #futureinnovation #futureisbright #inspirechange #KinaraCapital #fintech\n\nInsightful 2 days DBS Conference with the theme, “Charting our Path Forward with our ecosystem partners”. What made this event truly unique? We brought together 30+ of our ecosystem partners and fintech CEOs/founders from across the region, alongside our 150+ DBS team members representing multiple countries This high-energy forum created an unparalleled opportunity for our external partners to engage with our business leaders and delve into game-changing strategies that will accelerate our business in the region. I had the privilege of participating in a panel discussion/ dialogue with Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief Fintech Officer of MAS. We delved into a range of thought leadership topics, from MAS's vision for partnering with the industry to promote innovation in the financial sector, Singapore's role in global fintech innovation, and the exciting future of cryptocurrencies even after the \"crypto winter.\" We also explored the immense potential of Gen-AI and the ever-evolving relationship between banks and regulators on a global scale. Thanks Ananya Sen, Jamie Chan and the entire team for conceiving and orchestrating this event and bringing everyone together! #Fintech #Innovation #Collaboration #Leadership #Finance #networking #technology\n\n#Thinkingabouttalent I went to the RMB - Rand Merchant Bank Think Summit, which was excellent (#appreciation). Normal macro stuff, but the afternoon had some very different speakers. One of them was Tyler Cowen, a leading US economist. I liked him because he had a simple world view - yes, there is a big pile of problems in the world but the pile of #talent to solve them is bigger, and growing rapidly. Most financial people, especially #macro investors like focussing on liabilities and don't focus enough on the asset side of the balance sheet (#optimistsrule). This must be more true in #southafrica where the benefit of allowing 90% of the population to access equal opportunity will eventually compound. He was followed by a very funny Rassie Erasmus, who spoke through his coaching philosophy. Rassie also said something very profound: \"Nobody likes to be embarrassed. We need to create a #safespace so they can be themselves.\" How else do you create the freedom to do a back pass, or take a big position on the elections, or ask your teacher a question? So its all very simple - obsess about identifying and mobilising #talent and then create an environment for it to prosper. #talent #coaching #mentoring #thinkingenvironment\n\nIt was “serious fun” being a #delegate at the #Asia #2023 : #ExportDevelopment, #Project & #NaturalResources #Finance #event . Thanks to Exile Group for inviting me. My #takeaways, in no particular order, from the conference after observing, talking & listening to representatives from various #financialinstitutions in the form of #dfi #multilaterals #banks #corporates : THE IMPRINTS (in no particular order) : 1. #Woman, #moment, #nation a) (taking a leaf out of the #Indian #Financeminister #NirmalaSitharaman’s speech on the passing of the #Women’sBill) - #diversity, #equity & #inclusion #dei are here to stay and will continue to get more focus in the near future. We should sing “Jai Ho ! ” to #womenempowerment 2. “Renew” #Power a) The focus on #renewableenergy is a one way street. No two ways about it. Atleast from a financing perspective. b) Multilaterals and DFIs are providing impetus to #alternativefuels projects - so its not only solar by the way. 3. #Globalization in financing might be passe for a while. #Crossborderfunding will become more challenging a) Rising #interest rates, persistently #highinflation scenarios, #forex costs, deteriorating sovereign/corporate profiles are making local #borrowing in developing economies a more viable proposition for corporates b) Role of DFIs & multilaterals is more crucial than traditional banks since they can provide subsidized funding to govts. and local FIs for onward lending. 4. While #India is becoming #Bharat, Narendra Modi ji is more popular than ever before a) The #Indian #PrimeMinister has a very positive top of the mind recall in many conversations. The financing fraternity is cognizant of India’s growing clout. 5. #Blockchain #technology in finance is slowly but gradually making inroads. 6. #AI in finance is here to stay for real. Nothing artificial about it. There is AI and then there is the right AI for your business. Picking it is important. 7. The era of the global retail bank is over. Retail Banking will be more suited at local level. a) #Globalbanks might need to prune their #balance sheets wisely b) No Bank can do everything profitably c) #Digitization is all pervading and how ! 8. #Sustainability (and #ESG in finance) #benchmarking and minimum #standards’ #monitoring & #performance are no longer good to have. They are a must to have for all #stakeholders in your #valuechain besides you. #Greenwashing and #greenwishing will erode a institution’s credibility and impact its balance sheets sooner or later. 9. Majority perceive state of the #commodityfinance industry as uncertain."
