She was a graduate of Lake Charles High School and McNeese State University.\n\nMs. Sue’s servant heart led her to volunteer with the Salvation Army at fifteen, eventually becoming a full-time salaried bookkeeper and social worker. Her career in education included teaching positions with Head Start, Jeff Davis, Calcasieu, and Acadia parishes. Linda Sue chose to teach special needs children, believing they were God’s special children. She loved each one! She was a member of the Retired Teacher Association and was blessed by her teacher friends.\n\nMaw-Maw, as she was lovingly called by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, loved listening to music, praying, teaching, reading, shrimp and chicken wings. She found joy in the ministry of sending cards to family and friends, earning her the nickname “Card Lady.” Linda Sue was an active member of First Baptist Church Moss Bluff. She faithfully taught a ladies Sunday School class and was a member of the Triple L Club. She was God’s servant and missionary, sharing Jesus with everyone. Her life goal was to always show the love of Jesus. Everyone who was blessed to have known her knew she accomplished her goal.\n\nShe is survived by her sons, Matt LeJune, Tony (Donna) LeJune, and Jeffrey LeJune; brothers, Johnnie and David Carson; 7 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren and another on the way!\n\nLinda Sue was preceded in death by her son, Troy LeJune and sister, Marilyn Bourque.\n\nVisitation will be Wednesday December 20, 2023 from 12:00 PM until 2:00 PM with her Promotion to Glory service being held at 2:00 PM at Johnson Funeral Home of Lake Charles with Bro. Bill Saxby officiating. Burial will follow in Prien Memorial Cemetery.\n\nThe family expresses their appreciation to Landmark for the care and love given to our Mom and Maw-Maw for almost six years. Thank you to Brighton Bridge hospice for their care in her last days. God bless each of you.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be given in her name to the Salvation Army, St. Jude’s Cancer Research or the charity of your choice."
