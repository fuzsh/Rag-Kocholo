        "text": "The next #STEMScholar and #RSIF beneficiary that I’d like to talk about is Mahamat Adoum Abdoulaye. He is undertaking a ‘sandwich’ program with the Distributed Energy Team, at the Korea Institute of Energy Research. He holds a Master's degree in Sciences and Technology, Applied Physics, with a specialization in Renewable Energy from Gaston Berger University, Senegal. Additionally, he has a Bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering, with a focus on Petroleum Production, from the University Institute of Petroleum of Mao, Chad. He also has a Master’s degree in International Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid from Kalu Institute, Madrid. His research in Korea centers on the integration of renewable energy generation in to the electrical grid through battery storage and sector coupling, using power-to-hydrogen systems and carbon capture utilization & storage. His professional and academic training is extensive, including courses in Data Science and Machine Learning from MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS); the Open Africa Power Program 2021 (Regulation for Sustainable Development Goal 7) at the University of Cape Town – Graduate School of Business and Florence School of Regulation Online School, Enel Foundation, among many others. His larger vision in life is to contribute to a world where clean, reliable, and affordable energy is accessible to all. He aspires to work at the intersection of research, policy, and industry to develop and implement energy solutions that promote environmental sustainability and economic development. His dream is to work with institutions such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank Group to develop an innovative strategy to give access to sustainable, clean, affordable, and reliable electricity to 600 million Sub-Saharan African (SSA) people who still lack electricity access. The PASET RSIF scholarship provided him with the resources and support necessary to pursue his PhD. It gave him access to cutting-edge research facilities and work on topics of his interest. The sandwich program exposed him to global best practices, diverse research methodologies, and advanced technologies. It also facilitated connections with leading researchers, professors, and peers from various parts of the world. Mahamat’s vast and illustrious academic and professional aspirations are truly inspiring. I am sure he is going to revolutionize the field of renewable energy and create a fascinating legacy. https://lnkd.in/gHz2X743 https://lnkd.in/g-k45NrZ https://lnkd.in/gmuVZMdp https://lnkd.in/ga_67VmK https://lnkd.in/gSserytN https://lnkd.in/gevkj44V https://lnkd.in/gH2Q2Nhk https://lnkd.in/gJhaDenc https://lnkd.in/gJ-n8nj3\n\nIn this special post on #RSIF scholars studying in Korea, I am pleased to turn the spotlight on Christelle Arielle Mbouteu Megaptche, a Cameroonian PASET-RSIF PhD student at the University of Nairobi, Kenya. Christelle is currently undertaking a sandwich program within the Distributed Energy Team of Jeju Global Research Center at the Korea Institute of Energy Research. Her work involves using artificial intelligence methods to model and optimize the design of hybrid renewable energy systems for developing countries to encourage the widespread adoption of renewable energy. As part of the global transition to more affordable and sustainable energy, she is currently exploring ways to interconnect the energy-consuming sectors (residential, industrial, and transport) with the power-producing sector, known as sector coupling, with a particular focus on hydrogen as an energy carrier. In 2022, around 685 million people worldwide didn't have access to electricity, with more than 80% living in Sub-Saharan Africa. While the world explores innovative solutions for net zero emissions, Africa still seeks reliable access to electricity. Christelle’s vision in life is to significantly contribute to the global energy transition, but also ensure Africans have access to clean energy. As Research & Development initiatives are fundamental for affordable and clean energy, she is committed to proposing innovative solutions for a sustainable future, like other #STEMScholars. One of Christelle’s projects involved a new model of a demand response program for energy conservation in a healthcare facility in Cameroon affected by several electricity shortages. Results presented a reduction in electricity consumption of more than 15%, which significantly impacted the economic and environmental assessment of the proposed hybrid renewable energy system in the hospital. Another project involved integrating the transport sector into the energy production sector, known as power-to-mobility, to address the issue of curtailment. Christelle wants to contribute to the world’s decarbonization efforts as well as enhance global access to electricity, especially in Africa. The RSIF scholarship has given her the opportunity to collaborate with passionate and qualified researchers, enhanced the significance of her research work and increased its appeal and competitiveness in the research community. The scholarship’s sandwich program enabled her to visit the Korea Institute of Energy Research and work with qualified researchers on innovative solutions for carbon neutrality. This helped expand her knowledge in the energy area and build valuable international relationships. Christelle’s work and plans for the future are indeed remarkable and I’m excited to see the impact she’s going to make in her chosen field. ttps://https://lnkd.in/gc6usdHy https://lnkd.in/gbaVqCVr https://lnkd.in/g-k45NrZ https://lnkd.in/gSserytN\n\nOn a recent trip to Korea to review education technology solutions, I was overjoyed to hear from government counterparts and World Bank staff about the excellence of African Ph.D science scholars studying in Korean Universities, selected under the PASET RSIF program. In the coming days, I will showcase some of these scholars who are working to make Africa resilient and stronger. I am excited for all of you to see and read the stories of grit, determination and success. The Regional Scholarship and Innovation Fund (RSIF) is a pan-African science fund for Ph.D training, post doctoral research and innovation. I am proud to have helped conceputalize and operationalize it, working together with other Bank colleagues, and above all Minsters from African governments, who were the first to contribute to the Fund . The Government of Korea also announced a US$ 10 million grant to the program, spurred by the commitment of the African governments. The World Bank had been providing technical assistance to design the program but came in with funding only after these first movers. Under the program, African universities enter into a partnership with selected high quality universities outside the continent for joint Ph.D training. Students are competitively selected across sub-Saharan Africa, and spend two years in the partner universities. Thanks to the grant from the Govt of Korea, the best Korean universities became international partners. The program encourages cutting-edge research that addresses the continent’s most pressing challenges in areas like ICT, energy, food security, and more. Scholars work on African problems while receiving world-class education and mentorship, and African universities and international partners strengthen their collaboration through joint research. I made several trips to Korea about 6 years ago to get the government's support and recall some of the doubts expressed by Korean universities in the initial period about whether the African students would be able to cope with the tough work culture. How gratifying to hear the overwhelmingly positive feedback about these students ! Back in March, I embarked on a journey to connect with the beneficiaries of the fund, focusing on women, to understand how it has benefited them and to highlight their life’s journey. Here’s a roundup of the posts I did in March: https://lnkd.in/gJvztzWd. In future posts, please read about the students who chose to go to Korea. https://lnkd.in/gbaVqCVr #PASETRSIF #AfricanScholars #PhD #NationBuilding #EducationReform\n\nI was happy to moderate a session at VMFT featuring my colleague from the World Bank, Xiaoyan Liang, who spoke about the Teacher Research Group system of teacher professional development in China and its application in Tanzania. Xiaoyan is Lead Education Specialist and has worked in East Asia, Africa and Latin America. She wrote the influential book \"How Shanghai Does It\" which explores the details of Shanghai's efforts to improve education quality and focus on improving student learning. We have worked together during my time at the Bank, and have shared our collective vision of bringing about sustainable changes to educational systems around the world, and specifically developing countries. In the online session, Xiaoyan shared her experience with the Teacher Research Group (TRG) system that was adopted in China in the 1950s, and how it has revolutionised teaching methods there, specifically Shanghai. The system has also helped catapult the teaching profession to a highly respectable career choice. She also shared live examples of the system's success in a developing country like Tanzania. Check the full report on VMFT's site: https://lnkd.in/g9k_AwKr #TeacherResearchGroup #TRG #China #Tanzania #Education #EducationReform\n\nJuly 15, World Youth Skills Day shines a spotlight on the training and development opportunities that prepare young people for the jobs of tomorrow. In a global economy driven by innovation and technology, acquiring new skills is more critical than ever. From digital literacy to leadership, from technical expertise to creative problem-solving, these skills are the key to unlocking endless opportunities. The Digital Economy for Africa framework of the World Bank, which took shape around 2018, jumpstarted some systematic work on digital skills for Africa, I recall some of the discussions at that time within the Bank – what do we mean by digital skills? Are digital skills need to be distinguished from broader technical skills ? Much of that discussion seems redundant now. Digital skills are becoming increasingly critical across the globe and more and more countries are discussing frameworks, digital literacy programs for the general population and how to incorporate digital skills into school education, technical education and higher education. Still, the question of defining digital skills remains challenging. In particular, Africa lacked a comprehensive framework for digital skills. As part of the team developing the framework for digital skills, and how to build digital skills capacity, a number of publications were developed, which are still relevant, and were adopted in other regions. See them here https://lnkd.in/dK8MY85 https://lnkd.in/gD3NZcDY https://lnkd.in/dxYudVB\n\nUNESCO recently released its “Greening curriculum guidance: teaching and learning for climate action”, with the objective of having 90 percent of all countries include climate change in their curricula by 2030. Apart from guidance, however, what is really required to help developing countries prepare the next generation to deal with climate challenges? One such attempt was a recent seminar organized by Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT), in collaboration with the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), to promote education on climate change and environment sustainability in Kerala. This effort was recognized on a global platform when The Global Innovation Network for Teaching and Learning (GINTL) cooperation featured our seminar on their website. You can read all about it https://lnkd.in/grGrwBzV. GINTL brings together dedicated researchers and practitioners from Finland and partners from China, India and the African continent to contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4: “Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. One finding of the seminar was that there is no mention of climate change in the Kerala curriculum, although Kerala has a State Climate Action Plan. The seminar emphasized the need for contextually relevant materials in local language to reach the grass root levels and give students the opportunity to learn about the causes and effects of climate change. A concrete outcome of the seminar is that a group of teachers is working on a climate change curriculum for coastal communities in Kerala. This year, travelling between and working on different parts of the world, I have been struck by how little discussion there is about educating students about climate change, why it happens and what can be done. I have witnessed the distinct change in climate and also the growing understanding amongst policy makers and ordinary people in developing countries about the impacts on their lives. After the grueling summers of Kerala, the rains descended in torrents resulting in floods. In the meantime, temperatures in Delhi hit 50 degrees Celsius. In Nepal and Bhutan, melting snows threaten landslides and floods. Sri Lanka is threat. According to a recent report, the number of days with extreme heat is expected to rise from 20 days to more than 100 days by the end of the century, under one scenario. Yet, the gulf between the real world of climate change and the education system is palpable. Check the VMFT report and recommendations https://lnkd.in/gsFidUf7. Let me know in the comments what else can be done GINTL – Global Innovation Network for Teaching and Learning University of Jyväskylä TISS-Centre of Excellence in Teacher Education Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust\n\nWhen we talk of climate change, environment sustainability, leaving a better world behind us, etc. it mainly revolves around adults, organisations or government initiatives. How to address climate change and sustainability through education and mobilizing of young people is a question that needs to be addressed more urgently. Education systems in developing countries face multiple problems already, but there is no choice but to address our planetary challenges as a priority. Who are the beneficiaries of these changes that we hope to see in the future? Who will ultimately benefit from our action or inaction? The next generations, of course. So, apart from focusing on reversing the damage that's already done, the coming generations have to learn about how to reduce the carbon footprint and adapt to climate conditions in their local contexts, protect biodiversity and the environment. Small steps taken in the right direction can go a long way in creating conscious individuals who will work towards creating a resilient world. As mentioned in my last post, Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT), in collaboration with the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), organised a two-day seminar on education research and environment sustainability in Kerala. Check the slides to see the challenges that are dogging the education system in this most advanced state of India, highlighted by researchers and presenters. Teaching about climate has to address these challenges. As a follow up, an \"informal\" climate curriculum for primary and upper primary students is being developed. Drop your ideas in the comments. Damodaran, Prof. Vk Padma Mudumbi Sarangapani Veeramani C TISS-Centre of Excellence in Teacher Education Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust Centre for Development Studies (CDS)\n\nKerala had one of the hottest summers on record in 2024, and the previous summer of 2023 was the fifth hottest ever since 1901, when records started being kept. Nine of the ten warmest years were in the last decades 2013-2024. https://lnkd.in/gVHctaMW Unseasonal rainfall, the possibility of flooding and sea level rise are imminent dangers that create risks for the entire population, in one of the most densely populated coastal states of India. Kerala is one of the few states to have a Climate Change Action Plan, covering many sectors. But one sector is missing: education. Across the world, preparing the younger generation for climate change adaptation and mitigation without creating climate anxiety has become a great challenge. How should education systems deal with these risks to the planet through curricula, teacher training and extra curricular activities? How should education systems build resilience to ensure education continuity in the face of possible natural disasters? The Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT), in collaboration with the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), organized a two-day seminar on education research and environment sustainability in Kerala. The two main objectives of the seminar were to develop a research agenda on climate and sustainability education in the state and, to propose ideas for developing and integrating climate change education into school curriculum. The participants of the seminar included university faculty, teachers, researchers, the media and speakers from UNICEF India office, the Global Partnership for Education, the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the University of Jyväskylä (Finland) In the coming days and weeks, I will share snippets from the seminar. #WorldEarthDay #Sustainability #Environment #EarlyEducation"
