Between 2016 and 2021, he was a professor of public policy at Duke University and non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Global Economy and Development program.\n\nGill led the World Bank’s influential 2009 World Development Report on economic geography. His work includes introducing the concept of the “middle-income trap” to describe how countries stagnate after reaching a certain level of income. He has published extensively on key policy issues facing developing countries—among other things, sovereign debt vulnerabilities, green growth and natural-resource wealth, labor markets, and poverty and inequality.\n\nGill has also taught at Georgetown University and the University of Chicago. He holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago.\n\nChristopher Fussner founded and owns TransTechnology Pte. Ltd. in Singapore in 1988, a major distributor of surface mount technology and semiconductor capital equipment. Headquartered in Singapore, Trans-Tec has 235 employees worldwide with offices in China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, United States, and Vietnam. He has had extensive experience in negotiating and establishing joint ventures, strategic alliances, licenses, distribution networks and sales worldwide. In addition, Mr. Fussner is also founder and owner of Certain Cellars Pte. Ltd. in Singapore, an importer and distributor of fine wines. Prior to forming these companies, Mr. Fussner headed Asia sales for Amistar Corporation based in Seoul, Korea and Singapore. As such, he was responsible for sales and service for electronics manufacturing industry machines in Australia, Asia, and India.\n\nMr. Fussner began his international career during the late 1978 in Ouagadougou (Upper Volta) Burkino Faso, where he was involved in aid work for Catholic Relief Services. He subsequently joined Church World Services during 1979 – 1980, devoting his time as a refugee resettlement officer in Malaysia, being responsible for the resettlement process of Vietnamese refugees. Mr. Fussner also taught English at the Hyundai Corporation in Seoul, Korea. As a young man, Mr. Fussner also worked in New York as a steamfitter, waiter, busboy, paperboy, and gardener.\n\nMr. Fussner received his B.A. in History and East Asian Studies from George Washington University Elliott School of International Affairs (1979), and his M.I.M. (Master of International Management) at the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Phoenix, Arizona (1982). He is proficient in Chinese and French with some knowledge of Korean and Spanish.\n\nAbout the Moderator:\n\nProfessor James Foster is the Vice Dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs, Oliver T. Carr, Jr. Professor of International Affairs, and Professor of Economics at the George Washington University. He is also a Research Associate at the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative at Oxford University. Professor Foster’s research focuses on welfare economics — using economic tools to evaluate and enhance the wellbeing of people. His work underlies many well-known social indices including the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) published annually by the UNDP in the Human Development Report, dozens of national MPIs used to guide domestic policy against poverty, the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) at USAID, the Gross National Happiness Index of Bhutan, the Better Jobs Index of the InterAmerican Development Bank, and the Statistical Performance Index of the World Bank. Prof. Foster received his PhD in Economics from Cornell University and has a Doctorate Honoris Causa from Universidad Autonoma del Estado Hidalgo (Mexico).\n\nMacro-International Seminar\n\nThursday, September 13th, 2023\n\n2:30-4 p.m EDT\n\n2115 G Street NW\n\nJoin the GW Department of Economics for a macro-international seminar featuring Robert Richmond, associate professor of finance at NYU Stern and a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\n\nSustainable Cities Workshop on “Urban Inclusion and Development”\n\nTuesday, May 9th, 2023\n\n9:30-1:45 EDT\n\nIn-Person and Virtual\n\nGlobally, 55% of the population lives in urban areas today. By 2045, the number of people living in cities will increase by 1.5 times to 6 billion, adding 2 billion more urban residents.

The panel will discuss “Reshaping the World Bank for the 21st Century: An Agenda for the New President” in a session moderated by IIEP Distinguished Visiting Scholar Ajay Chhibber. IIEP Director Remi Jedwab will introduce the session.\n\nWith the nomination of Ajay Banga by the US administration as the next World Bank president there is a unique opportunity to reshape the institution for the needs of the 21st century. This would include changing its strategic direction with a much greater focus on tackling climate change, as it pursues poverty eradication and shared prosperity. It must also include making its governance structure more representative of a changed global economic landscape and using its capital in more innovative ways to harness the vast sums of private capital to meet the challenges of sustainable development across the world. It must also find ways to focus more on global public goods as it helps individual countries address these challenges.\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nNancy Birdsal l is president emeritus and a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a policy-oriented research institution that opened its doors in Washington, DC in October 2001.

The Macro-International seminar hosts speakers from all over the world that present recent and cutting edge research on different topics in macroeconomics, open economy macroeconomics and international finance. The seminar series is co-organized by Prof. Tomás Williams and Prof. Graciela Kaminsky. On Wednesday, February 10, 2021, Chenzi Xu of Stanford Graduate School of Business presented “Reshaping Global Trade: The Immediate and Long-Run Effects of Bank Failures.”​\n\nChenzi Xu studies the first modern global banking crisis that began in London in 1866 and provides causal evidence that financial sector disruptions can reshape international trade patterns for decades. Using newly collected archival loan records that link banks to their operations abroad, Xu estimates that countries exposed to banks whose headquarters in London failed exported 17% less on average to each destination until 1905. Exporters trading with destinations for the first time, facing more competition in goods markets, and with little access to alternative forms of credit experienced more persistent losses, consistent with hysteresis arising from high sunk costs of entry into exporting.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nChenzi Xu is an Assistant Professor of Finance at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. Her research is focused on the intersection of finance, international trade, and economic history. Xu has received an AB and PhD in Economics at Harvard University as well as a MPhil in Economic and Social History from the University of Cambridge. Through her study, she has received awards and honors such as the 2019 “AQR Top Finance Graduate Award” and the 2018 “Economic History Society New Researcher Prize.”\n\nThis event was co-sponsored with GW Department of Economics.\n\nFiscal Dominance: A Theory of Everything in India\n\nWednesday, September 9, 2020\n\n10:00 am – 11:30 am EDT\n\nWebEx\n\nRead Prof. Acharya’s responses to our discussants here.\n\nThis was the first webinar in the “Envisioning India” series, co-sponsored by the Sigur Center for Asian Studies and the Institute for International Economic Policy. It is a platform for dialogue and debate. We invited you to engage with us in this series of important discussions.\n\nThe “Envisioning India” series is organized under the stewardship of IIEP Co-Director James Foster, Oliver T. Carr, Jr. Professor of International Affairs and Professor of Economics, and IIEP Distinguished Visiting Scholar Ajay Chhibber. The first talk in the Envisioning India Series was “Fiscal Dominance: A Theory of Everything in India” and featured Viral V. Acharya of NYU-Stern.\n\nHe discussed the following: Financial stability is perhaps the most important prerequisite for stable growth. It is surprisingly also the most compromised one. Encouraging cheap credit and rapid balance-sheet growth in the financial sector is a temptation that many governments find hard to resist to register well on the short-run growth scorecard. Post 1991 reforms, India undertook an upward and onward march in economic progress for close to two decades. Since then, lack of financial stability has emerged as its Achilles’ heel. The reasons for this are many but a first and foremost contributor has been the increasing dominance of banking and financial sector regulation by the unyielding deficit situation of the consolidated government balance-sheet. Reining in this fiscal dominance requires not just a strengthening of the institutional framework of financial sector regulation but also the right balance between the role played by the government, the central bank, the markets, and the private sector in the economy.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nViral V. Acharya is the C.V. Starr Professor of Economics in the Department of Finance at New York University Stern School of Business (NYU-Stern) and an Academic Advisor to the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Philadelphia. Viral was a Deputy Governor at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during 23rd January 2017 to 23rd July 2019 in charge of Monetary Policy, Financial Markets, Financial Stability, and Research. His speeches while at the RBI will release in the end of July 2020 in the form of a book titled “Quest for Restoring Financial Stability in India” (SAGE Publications India), with a new introductory chapter “Fiscal Dominance: A Theory of Everything in India”. Viral completed Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai in 1995 and Ph.D. in Finance from NYU-Stern in 2001. Prior to joining Stern, he was at London Business School (2001-2008), the Academic Director of the Coller Institute of Private Equity at LBS (2007-09) and a Senior Houblon-Normal Research Fellow at the Bank of England (Summer 2008). Viral’s primary research interest is in theoretical and empirical analysis of systemic risk of the financial sector, its regulation and its genesis in government-induced distortions, an inquiry that cuts across several other strands of research – credit risk and liquidity risk, their interactions and agency-theoretic foundations, as well as their general equilibrium consequences. He has published articles in the American Economic Review, Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies, Review of Finance, Journal of Business, Journal of Financial Intermediation, Rand Journal of Economics, Journal of Monetary Economics, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, and Financial Analysts Journal.

As a result of the pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by –3 percent in 2020, much worse than during the 2008–09 financial crisis. In a baseline scenario–which assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and containment efforts can be gradually unwound—the global economy is projected to grow by 5.8 percent in 2021 as economic activity normalizes, helped by policy support. The risks for even more severe outcomes, however, are substantial. Effective policies are essential to forestall the possibility of worse outcomes, and the necessary measures to reduce contagion and protect lives are an important investment in long-term human and economic health. Because the economic fallout is acute in specific sectors, policymakers will need to implement substantial targeted fiscal, monetary, and financial market measures to support affected households and businesses domestically. And internationally, strong multilateral cooperation is essential to overcome the effects of the pandemic, including to help financially constrained countries facing twin health and funding shocks, and for channeling aid to countries with weak health care systems.\n\nMore than a decade after the global financial crisis, the world is struggling with the health and economic effects of a profound new crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Advanced economies entered this crisis with interest rates at historical lows and public debts, on average, higher than they had been over the past 60 years. They will come out from the crisis with even higher public debts. Drawing on analysis completed before the emergence of the pandemic, this chapter examines policymakers’ options to respond to adverse shocks and build resilience when rates are low and debts high.\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting emerging markets through an unprecedented mix of domestic and external shocks whose combined effects are very hard to predict. Among these, emerging markets are confronting a sharp tightening in global financial conditions. Against this backdrop, this chapter asks whether, based on historical experience, countries that have adopted a more stringent level of macroprudential regulation—aimed at strengthening financial stability—are better placed to withstand the impact of global financial shocks on domestic macroeconomic conditions.\n\nWebinar on Data Governance in Smart Cities\n\nThursday, April 9, 2020\n\n11:00 am EST\n\nZoom\n\nWe are pleased to invite you to the second webinar hosted by The Digital Trade and Data Governance Hub. The webinars focus on current and emerging data governance issues. Seminar 2 will be on “Data Governance in Smart Cities” and will take place on April 9 at 11am EST. This event will be co-sponsored by the Internet Society, the World Wide Web Foundation, the Centre for International Governance Innovation, and the Institute for International Economic Policy.\n\nAlthough we often talk about data governance as a national or international issue, cities are on the front lines of dealing with a wide range of data governance issues from privacy to the regulation of AI. This webinar will give attendees a greater understanding of why they might want to learn more about how cities are trying to balance the costs and benefits of data-driven services.\n\nThe speakers will be Professor Teresa Scassa, Canada Research Chair in Information Law, University of Ottawa Law School and Bianca Wylie, Senior Fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI). They will address the following questions:\n\nWhat is a smart city?\n\nWhat kinds of rules must cities develop to determine what entities can own, utilize and monetize smart city data?\n\nShould cities adopt special rules and considerations for personal data and human behavioral data?\n\nCities have bought into very complex data-driven systems, in the belief that data is “the solution.” Is it adding value and leading to more effective city management? What are the trade offs–e.g. energy efficiency vs. the loss of privacy\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by Digital Trade & Data Governance Hub; Internet Society: Greater Washington DC Chapter; Centre for International Governance Innovation; World Wide Web Foundation; and Institute for International Science and Technology Policy.\n\nTechnology, Taxation, and Corruption Evidence from the Introduction of Electronic Tax Filing\n\nTuesday, December 10, 2019\n\n12:30pm-2:00pm\n\nJohn W. Kendrick Seminar Room\n\nMonroe Hall/Hall of Government, Room 321\n\n2115 G St. Washington, D.C. 20052\n\nPlease join us with welcoming Oyebola Okunogbe (World Bank) as she will be be presenting a Trade & Development Workshop.\n\nMany e-government initiatives introduce technology to improve efficiency and avoid potential human bias. Electronic tax filing (e-filing) is an important example, as developing countries increasingly adopt online submission of tax declarations to replace in-person submission to tax officials. This paper examines the impact of e-filing on compliance costs, tax payments, and bribe payments using experimental variation and data from Tajikistan firms. Firms that e-file have lower compliance costs, spending five fewer hours each month on fulfilling tax obligations. There are no significant average effects of e-filing on tax or bribe payments, but significant heterogeneity exists across firms by their baseline likelihood of tax evasion. Among firms previously more likely to evade, e-filing doubles tax payments, likely by disrupting collusion with officials. Conversely, among firms less likely to have been evading, e-filing reduces tax payments, suggesting that officials had previously required them to pay more. These firms also pay fewer bribes, as e-filing reduces opportunity for extortion. In all, the results indicate that e-filing limits tax officials’ discretion and makes the distribution of tax payments across firms arguably more equitable.\n\nMardi Dungey Memorial Research Conference\n\nMardi Dungey Memorial Research Conference\n\nFriday, February 21, 2020\n\n8:00 am – 5:30 pm (Conference)\n\n5:30pm – 7:30 pm (Reception)\n\nLindner Commons, Suite 602\n\n1957 E St NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20052\n\nOn behalf of the Institute for International Economic Policy, the Research Program on Forecasting, the Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis, University of Tasmania, and the Society for Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, you are cordially invited to the Mardi Dungey Memorial Research Conference on February 21, 2020.

Impact investing, ESG, Green Finance and SDGs are among many of the words that have recently populated investment committees and investor conferences as well as boardrooms. Leveraging GWU’s IIEP Visiting Scholar’s work on Assessing and Monitoring the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAA) and Citi’s GPS research, UN’s SDG: Pathways to Success- A Systemic Framework for Aligning Investment, the event will provide the opportunity to evaluate the progress of SDG financing and to appraise the degree of mobilization of private sector capital in support of the SDGs. Within this analytical context, market participants — issuers, investors, Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) and donors — will discuss the advances and challenges of financing sustainable development. The forum will seek to address the means to scale private sector capital investment, the need to institutionalise SDG financing instruments and structures and the critical contributions that public sector actors, such as donor agencies, can make to realize the “disruption” of the development aid paradigm. The discussion will also touch upon the importance of data capture and disclosure as it relates to the impact and outcomes of the SDG’s investments.\n\nAgenda\n\n7:30–8:00am: Breakfast and Registration 8:00–8.05am: Welcome Remarks\n\nMaggie Chen, Director, Institute for International Economic Policy, GWU\n\nJulie Monaco, Managing Director, Global Head Public Sector Group, Corporate and Investment Bank, Citi\n\n8:05–8:20am: Setting the Stage (Presentations of Relevant Research)\n\nAjay Chhibber, Visiting Scholar, Institute for International Economic Policy, GWU\n\nJason Channell, Head of Social & Responsible Investment Research, Citi\n\n8:20–9:30am: High-Level Panel Discussion and Audience Q&A Panelists\n\nDenis Duverne, Chairman, Board of Directors, AXA\n\nMahmoud Mohieldin, Senior Vice President, 2030 Development Agenda, United Nations Relations, and Partnerships, World Bank\n\nDonna Sims Wilson, President, Smith Graham & Co.\n\nSean Jones, Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator, Food Security, USAID\n\nTim Turner, Group Chief Risk Officer, African Development Bank\n\nOrganizing Committee: Peter Sullivan (Citi), Ajay Chhibber, Kyle Renner, Sunil Sharma (all George Washington University), and Andreas (Andy) Jobst (World Bank)\n\nThe Real Exchange Rate, Innovation and Productivity: Regional Heterogeneity, Asymmetries and Hysterisis\n\nLaura Alfaro\n\nHarvard Business School\n\nWednesday, November 28, 2018\n\n2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n\nJohn W.

He will join us to discuss “The I Theory of Money“: a project assessing the efficacy of an accommodative monetary policy on Fisher deflations and downturns for financial intermediaries. In particular, it can mitigate destabilizing adverse effects. Professor Brunnermeier will also focus on interest rate cuts and the moral hazard they can create. More generally, Brunnermeier researches financial markets, bubbles, liquidity, and monetary price stability, using models to incorporate friction and behavioral elements of global markets.\n\n“Cross-Border Banking and Global Liquidity” (International Finance Forum Series)\n\nHyun Song Shin\n\nPrinceton University\n\nFriday, April 11, 2014\n\n12:30 to 2:00pm\n\nLindner Commons, 6th Floor\n\n1957 E Street NW\n\nWashington, DC 20052\n\nInternational Finance Forum Series\n\nCharles Collyns\n\nManaging Director and Chief Economist, Institute of International Finance\n\nMore information here\n\nThursday, October 24, 2013\n\n12:00 to 2:00pm\n\nElliott School of International Affairs\n\nLindner Commons, 6th floor\n\n1957 E Street NW\n\nWashington, DC 20052\n\nThe Surprisingly Swift Decline of U.S. Manufacturing Employment\n\nJustin R. Pierce\n\nEconomist, Federal Reserve Board\n\nTuesday, February 12, 2013\n\n12:30 to 2:00pm\n\nJohn W. Kendrick Seminar Room\n\nRoom 321 at 2115 G Street NW\n\nWashington, DC 20052\n\nWe examine the link between the sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing employment after 2001 and the elimination of trade policy uncertainty resulting from the U.S. granting of permanent normal trade relations to China in late 2000. We find that industries where the threat of tariff hikes declines the most experience greater employment loss due to suppressed job creation, exaggerated job destruction and a substitution away from low-skill workers. We show that these policy-related employment losses coincide with a relative acceleration of U.S. imports from China, the number of U.S. firms importing form China, the number of Chinese firms exporting to the U.S. and the number of U.S.-China importer-exporter pairs.\n\nThe paper can be found here.\n\nThe Real Exchange Rate, Real Interest Rate, and Risk Premium\n\nCharles Engel\n\nProfessor of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nAn International Finance Forum and Macro-International Seminar\n\nThe paper can be found here, and the PowerPoint can be found here.\n\nWednesday, November 14, 2012\n\n2:30 to 4:00pm\n\nLindner Commons, 6th floor\n\n1957 E St, NW\n\nWashington, DC 20052\n\nAdvances in Behavioral Finance\n\nOrganized by\n\nThe Institute for International Economic Policy\n\nand\n\nThe International Monetary Fund Institute\n\nThis will be an all day conference\n\nKeynote speaker: Prof. George Akerlof (UC-Berkeley and IMF)\n\nThursday, May 26, 2011\n\nElliott School of International Affairs\n\nCity View Room 7th Floor\n\n1957 E Street NW\n\nWashington, DC 20052\n\n8:15 a.m.-8:45 a.m. Breakfast\n\n8:45 a.m.-9:00 a.m. Opening Remarks IIEP Director Stephen C.
