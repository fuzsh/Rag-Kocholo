A prolific author and, as Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd noted in the Spectator, \"a skilful and unobtrusive editor,\" Allen has published books on numerous subjects from the experiences of the British in India to tales of Himalayan exploration to the birth of Buddhism in the West. Of his many published works, he is perhaps best known for one of his first professional endeavors, an oral history produced for British Broadcasting Corporation Radio and later published as three books, Plain Tales from the Raj: Images of British India in the TwentiethCentury, Tales from the Dark Continent, and Tales from the South China Seas: Images of the British in South-East Asia in the Twentieth Century.\n\nFor his radio documentary Allen, the son of a political officer on India's northeast frontier, invited a wide range of British military personnel and civilians in India, as well as a small number of Indians and Eurasians, to, as critic Benny Green described it in the Spectator, \"simply … talk into tape recorders.\" Green acknowledged the possible danger of such an unstructured approach—he warned that Allen's method could be \"utterly deadly\"—but conceded that the \"great cunning and care\" Allen demonstrated in his editing and arranging of the interviews rendered the outcome \"an unqualified triumph.\" The publication of Plain Tales from the Raj was equally well received; a contributor to Choice called it \"the best study to date of British society in twentieth-century India.\" Similarly, Tales from the Dark Continent was hailed by a Choice reviewer as \"an invaluable and powerful historical account,\" although Spectator critic Montgomery-Massingberd pointed out that the book includes a few misspelled names and a minor factual error.\n\nAmong Allen's other publications are Raj: A Scrapbook of British India, 1877-1947, which Geographical Journal contributor Dorothy Middleton praised as a \"well-informed\" if somewhat moderated collection of photographs, letters, advertisements, and other remnants (Middleton commented that \"Work was more challenging, leisure more fun and hardship less dire than Mr. Allen allows\"); A Glimpse of the Burning Plain: Leaves from the Indian Journals of Charlotte Canning, which interweaves entries from the journals of the young wife of the governor-general of India in the mid-nineteenth century with Allen's narrative in what British Book News contributor Geoffrey Trease called a \"beautifully produced volume\"; A Mountain in Tibet: The Search for Mount Kailas and the Sources of the Great Rivers of India, which Paul Stuewe enthusiastically described in Quill & Quire as \"a ripping yarn of exploration and adventure\"; Soldier Sahibs: The Daring Adventurers Who Tamed India's Northwest Frontier, criticized in Publishers Weekly for its \"unapologetically imperialist perspective\" and declared \"tough going\" for readers unfamiliar with the subject; and The Search for the Buddha: The Men Who Discovered India's Lost Religion, praised by a Kirkus Reviews contributor as \"a first-rate account\" of the research that introduced Buddhism to the West, that is \"well written, well researched,\" and, according to a Publishers Weekly reviewer, \"deeply appealing.\"\n\nClearly, much of Allen's canon focuses on South Asia, and although he often travels to research his subjects, he admits to a certain difficulty with the required travel; in an interview with the Guardian's John Cunningham he confided, \"I'm an awful traveller. I'm constantly sick; I can't stand Indian food and I've lost part of one lung.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBritish Book News, July, 1986, Geoffrey Trease, review of A Glimpse of the Burning Plain: Leaves from the Indian Journals of Charlotte Canning, p. 438.\n\nChoice, December, 1976, review of Plain Tales from the Raj: Images of British India in the Twentieth Century, p.1346; September, 1980, review of Tales from the Dark Continent, p. 140.\n\nGeographical Journal, July, 1978, Dorothy Middleton, review of Raj: A Scrapbook of British India, 1877-1947, pp. 348-349.\n\nGuardian, February 12, 2000, John Cunningham, \"In Search of Paradise Lost: A Life in Writing.\"\n\nKirkus Reviews, February 1, 2003, review of The Search for the Buddha: The Men Who Discovered India's Lost Religion, p. 195.\n\nPublishers Weekly, April 30, 2001, review of Soldier Sahibs: The Daring Adventurers Who Tamed India's Northwest Frontier, p. 74; March 17, 2003, review of The Search for the Buddha, p. 71.\n\nQuill & Quire, March, 1983, Paul Stuewe, review of A Mountain in Tibet: The Search for Mount Kailas and the Sources of the Great Rivers in India, p. 69."
