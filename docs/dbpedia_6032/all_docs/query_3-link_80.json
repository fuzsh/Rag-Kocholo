        "text": "Rev. Joseph Strohhofer\n\nSTROHHOFER, Reverend Father Joseph\n\nTrinity Manor in Regina\n\nIt is with great sorrow that we announce the peaceful passing of Father Joe at Pasqua Hospital on Wednesday, May 12, 2021. Predeceased by his parents, Dr. Josef Strohhofer (1972) and Mrs. Erika Strohhofer (2012); as well as three siblings. He is survived by seven siblings; and numerous nieces and nephews. Born in Germany in 1940, Father Joe was ordained to the priesthood in 1965. A good and faithful servant he served in numerous parishes within the Archdiocese of Regina for 55 years. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at Holy Rosary Cathedral. To leave an online message of condolence, please visit www.speersfuneralchapel.com\n\nView livestream of the funeral here\n\nMsgr. Kenneth Eugene Miller\n\nMarch 29, 1939- November 8, 2020\n\nMsgr Ken passed away quietly on November 8th, 2020 at Trinity Manor at the age of 81. He was predeceased by his parents Joseph Peter Miller and Magdelena Mary (Vogt), brothers Hugh and Patrick and brother-in-law Greg Ryan. He is survived by his sisters Irene Ryan, Sister Joan Miller R.N.D.M., sisters-in-law Loretta and Mary and many nieces and nephews.\n\nMsgr Ken was born in Weyburn, Sask. On March 29, 1939. He was the youngest of five siblings. His parents were strong in their faith with the family rosary and daily Mass. When Ken was five, the Miller family moved to Regina and were active members in Holy Rosary Cathedral Parish. Ken was a Mass server at a very young age and continued to serve until grade 12. What touched his life in a special way was serving at the Mass and realizing the awesomeness of the Eucharist. In an interview with Frank Flegel in 2010 Msgr Ken said that his earliest memory of wanting to be a priest was when he was in Grade 2. He was serving mass, which was then celebrated in Latin, and heard the priest say, Corpus Mei – this is my body. He said, “Those words hit me like a ton of bricks. I want to do that,” he thought to himself.\n\nHis faith life was influenced by his own family’s faith life and witness and influence of other parish priests growing up.\n\nIn high school, studying Latin was compulsory at the Jesuit Campion College, Miller related, “Prior to the exam I prayed in the chapel that if I received 100 on my test I would become a priest.” He was given the 100 and later found out that the teacher had decided to award the 100 even though there was a small error on his paper. “Was that a sign?” he asked.\n\nAfter completing High School at Campion in Regina, Ken was accepted at St. Peter’s Seminary, London, Ontario. He received his Bachelor of Arts Philosophy with First Class Honors. In his four years of Theology, he received a Bachelor of Sacred Theology from St. Peter’s Seminary.\n\nMsgr Ken was ordained to the priesthood on May 30, 1964 at Holy Rosary Cathedral by Archbishop M.C. O’Neill.\n\nIn a letter written by Very Rev. Lorne Crozon, V.G. in 2014, Fr. Lorne describes Msgr Ken’s ministry as follows:\n\n“I have had the privilege of knowing Msgr. Kenneth Miller as a friend and mentor for the past 43 years. My association with Father Ken began in September of 1971 when I entered Miller High as a student. At that time, Father Ken was the school Chaplain and we became friends and have remained so since then. Also during that period, Father Ken operated the Catholic Teen Drop-in Centre and managed a concession booth at the Exhibition to provide funds for youth programs in the Archdiocese. Father Ken has been active in many areas of Catholic life. He has been the pastor of a number of parishes in the Archdiocese of Regina, has worked as Supervisor of Catholic Education for the Regina Catholic School Division, served our Archdiocese as the Director of Pastoral Services, Director of Organization and Development, and as our Vicar General.\n\nFather Ken’s generosity has greatly influenced my life. His good example is one of the reasons I chose a vocation in the priesthood and work as a priest today. I believe at the very heart of Father Ken’s being are those things that make Saskatchewan great.\n\nHe is a clear and independent thinker who always shows concern for the people around him. His life is an example of service and kindness to others. His interests are wide and varied, from theological concerns that effect peoples’ lives daily, to art and music, to being out with friends for coffee and the Saskatchewan Roughriders. In all these things, he is a full participant and an avid fan.”\n\nAnd as recalled by Miles Meyers in that same year,\n\n“I have had the pleasure of knowing Msgr. Kenneth Miller for the past 29 years. I had the good fortune of first meeting Msgr. Ken when I was the Youth Ministry Coordinator for the Archdiocese of Regina. From the first moment I met him, I knew that he was passionate about the Catholic faith, young people, Catholic Education and the Saskatchewan Roughriders. As my career path lead me into teaching, high school chaplaincy and now Coordinator of Catholic Education Services, I had many occasions to work closely with Msgr. Miller. Through these encounters, my admiration for Msgr. Ken has grown even stronger.\n\nMsgr. Ken has been a tireless advocate for Catholic education not only within the Archdiocese of Regina but across the province. As Supervisor of Catholic Education for Regina Catholic Schools, Msgr. Ken made sure that all students felt welcomed and valued at our schools. Though Msgr. Ken would be too modest to admit it, he was instrumental in establishing the Ukrainian Program within Regina Catholic Schools. This program ensures that the language, culture and faith of Ukrainian Catholics is taught and promoted within the school division. Thus, it is no surprise that the Ukrainian Catholic community within the city of Regina has the highest regard for Msgr. Ken.\n\nMsgr. Ken is also held in the highest regard by Regina Catholic Schools. The chapel at Miller Catholic Comprehensive High School is officially known as the Msgr. Ken Miller Chapel in honour of his devoted service and tremendous impact on the staff and students of Miller.”\n\nAs well as the many parishes he served and his work with the Catholic School System, it is well to note that he held other offices in the archdiocese. He was Director of Organization & Development from 1986-2007, Director of Pastoral Services from March 1992 to February 1993; he was appointed Vicar General from June 2005-June 2006 and re-appointed for a three-year period from June 2006 to 2009. He was conferred upon the rank of Prelate of Honour with the title of Monsignor and the Investiture in January of 2007.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of those that had mentored him, Msgr Ken mentored many seminarians who hold him in high esteem to this day.\n\nMsgr Ken was very detailed and meticulous in any job he undertook. He took his duties as a priest very seriously and was always obedient to his bishop, always ready to serve wherever he was asked. He held a broad invaluable knowledge of the diocese that will never be replicated. He was very pastoral, a good shepherd of the people. Again, words from an interview in 2010 “My heart is with Christ and Christ’s people.”\n\nHe enjoyed getting involved in the entertainment of parish fundraisers – example: He dressed up like Dean Martin and sang playing his part very well indeed with glass in hand. He had a winning smile and a good sense of humor.\n\nBernadette relates a personal story about Msgr Ken that she holds dear in her heart: In the early part of 2001 when her Dad was in hospital and he called her and asked for a priest she called Msgr Ken and he came to the hospital immediately, no hesitation. This kind act meant so much to her that after that she served Msgr Ken to the best of her ability doing not only typing for work but personal typing after he retired. Most people couldn’t read his writing so he always relied on Bernadette and they became great co-workers. (If Bernadette wasn’t around the other secretaries would try to hide so that they wouldn’t get asked to type for him. Ha! Ha!)\n\nMsgr Ken always appreciated anything you did for him. He was an excellent organizer of events. He was an avid Rider fan.\n\nFamily was very important to Ken. He loved to celebrate get-togethers for all occasions. He took family members on several trips throughout the years. History and experiences were important to him.\n\nKen enjoyed weekly coffee sessions with family and friends to discuss current events and exchange ideas. He also looked forward to his monthly bridge games with fellow priests.\n\nAfter celebrating 40 years of the priesthood, he looked back at his years of service with great satisfaction and joy. A grade 2 girl preparing for First Eucharist once asked, “You like being a priest, don’t you?” He replied, “I love it”.\n\nWritten in the Diocesan Faith Stories book he was noted as saying, “I receive a sense of peace in ministering to the sick and dying, and great hope for the future in preparing couples for marriage. People of strong faith in each of the parishes I served over forty-five years, people who live and celebrate their faith nourish and strengthen me, and encourage me to serve the Lord faithfully.\n\nI have indeed been blest in so many ways. I give thanks to God for the gift of Faith and the gifts of the people of Faith who formed my life.”\n\nWhen he retired and came to visit the staff for coffee the cookies were always brought out as he was considered a “special” visitor. He was very loved and will be sincerely missed by so many.\n\nIt seems sad that he didn’t get to enjoy his retirement just when he got settled in Trinity Manor. He was feeling relaxed and joyful with no more obligations – so I guess the Lord was saying “Well done good and faithful servant. You can come home now. Your work on earth is done.” And reflecting on his life, Msgr Ken wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.\n\nFuneral arrangements have been made through Speers Funeral Chapel, 2136 College Ave., Regina. Visitation time will be at Speers Funeral Chapel on Sunday, November 15th, 2020 from Noon until 2:00 p.m. No registration required for this. The Prayers are also on Sunday, November 15th, 2020 at 3:00 p.m. at Holy Rosary Cathedral, 3125-13th Ave., Regina, and the Funeral Mass is on Tuesday, November 17th, 2020 at 10:30 a.m. at Holy Rosary Cathedral\n\nRev. Peter Nijssen\n\nFather Peter Nijssen was called home to our Merciful Father on Sunday, June 7, 2020 at Trinity Manor. Fr. Peter was 96 years old. He was predeceased by his parents and is survived by a sister Stiena, a nephew and a niece as well as other relatives in Holland.\n\nFather Peter was born in the Netherlands on January 10, 1924. He didn’t begin his vocation to the priesthood until he was 25. He spent 6 years in the minor seminary in Holland before coming to Canada in 1955 where he entered a major seminary at St. Peter’s in London, Ontario. He studied there for two years and then another four years at the Regina Cleri Seminary in Regina. He was ordained at Holy Rosary Cathedral on June 3, 1961.\n\nHe served at Holy Rosary Cathedral and Little Flower Parishes in Regina as well as numerous rural parishes – Rowatt, Pangman, Ceylon, Wolseley, Lanigan, Nokomis, Sinnett and Estevan, Midale and Macoun. Even at 74, rather than retiring, Fr. Peter continued to assist with ministry in Estevan until he retired to Martha House in the fall of 2014.\n\nFr. Peter served for five years on the Victims Committee and seven years as the Director of the Ministry to Priest Program. For 37 years he was a member of the Lion’s club and in 2007 he received the Lions International Foundation Award for dedicated humanitarian services. Fr. Peter was awarded the Diocesan Award of Merit in 2010. He also taught a human behavioural course at St. Mary Elementary School in Estevan. It seems he was well known for his legendary green thumb and magnificent flower gardens that people would come from miles around to see.\n\nWhen Fr. Peter came to Canada he was determined to learn and speak English well. His sermons were written. He was one of the first priests to have a computer. He lived a simple life with few needs – a car, a fishing rod and an occasional trip to see relatives in Holland. In his old age he did go to Alaska for a fishing experience. He rarely spoke about growing up as a teenager in occupied Holland during the Second World War. He told of a signal used to warn the population of danger, having the windmill stopped either horizontal or vertical or in between. Tulip bulbs were made into soup. A desperate woman traded her wedding ring for a loaf of bread. Occupying forces took a farm animal. Fr. Peter, with a laugh, quoted how they paid with money they printed at the kitchen table, “it was worthless.” He always was prayerful, very generous, and gradually in his old age he accepted his limitations of mind and body.\n\nIn the words of Father Tonny Dizy who spoke at Fr. Peter’s 50th Anniversary, “Through all these years you have been a faithful servant and shepherd in the various parishes to which you were appointed. Your devotion, your deep faith, your dedication, your care and compassion for people and your commitment has not gone without notice.” Father Peter, you have served the Lord well.\n\nWe are grateful for the care Fr. Peter received from staff, nuns, and others while at Martha House, during a brief stay at Regina General Hospital, and in the end at Trinity Manor.\n\nPrayers will be held on Friday, June 12, 2020 at 7:00 p.m. Funeral Mass will be held on Saturday, June 13, 2020 at 10:30 a.m. Both services will take place at Holy Rosary Cathedral, 2104 Garnet Street, Regina, SK.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 restrictions, limited seating will be available at the Prayers and Funeral Mass. To view the livestream of the Funeral Mass, please click HERE.\n\nGraveside Service will be held at Riverside Memorial Park, 815 Assiniboine Avenue, Regina, SK, on Monday, June 15, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. Please meet at the cemetery gates prior to 9:55 a.m. The graveside service will be broadcast, to vehicles in the cemetery, on radio at FM 106.9. Guests are asked to remain in their vehicles in order to comply with gathering size restrictions. These restrictions require that no one should leave their vehicle unless directed to do so by Speers personnel.\n\nRev. Msgr. Michael John Hogan\n\nBeloved by many, Msgr. Hogan passed away peacefully on Tuesday, April 21, 2020 at the age of 100 years. He was predeceased by his parents, William and Louise (nee Madigan); sisters and brothers-in-law, Louise (Anthony) Stembridge, Mary (Connie) Fogarty, Kathleen (Michael) Flanagan, Eva (Michael) Casey, and brother in infancy, Patrick. Msgr. Hogan is survived by his nieces and nephews in Ireland and Canada. He was born on October 19, 1919 in Limerick, Ireland, the second in his family.\n\nHe completed his studies at Mungret College, Limerick. While at school, he had met Archbishop Monahan of Regina, SK, who had been visiting Ireland. Msgr. Hogan (or Fr. Mike, to those who knew him well) loved to tell how the Archbishop warned him that Saskatchewan could be difficult; sometimes, he cautioned, a priest might get his car stuck in the winter snow or the muddy country roads while driving to serve parishioners. Fr. Mike would joke that all he heard the Archbishop say was the word “car,” and he was hooked. Young priests in Ireland at the time were issued a bicycle – never a car. He arrived in Regina in August 1939, just at the outbreak of WWII. His passenger ship had been in a convoy that included the Athenia, directly behind. He witnessed as it became a casualty of war, with the loss of 1103 lives. A man of deep faith, he marvelled at the fragility and value of life, and he carried that respect with him in all his relationships.\n\nFr. Hogan’s life as a priest touched people in many communities, where he was a thoughtful and dedicated leader. He studied at the Regina Cleri Seminary and was ordained on June 13, 1943 at Holy Rosary Cathedral in Regina, SK. He first served as a curate at Blessed Sacrament Parish, Regina, from 1943-1947. His first assignment as pastor (1948-1959) took him to Kenaston, SK, where he built St. Andrews Church. From 1959-1968 he established Holy Cross Parish in Regina. He continued his ministry to serve faithfully at St. John the Baptist, Estevan, SK (1968-1971). He returned to Regina in 1971, and remained there until his passing. In Regina, he served at Christ the King, (1971-1980), St. Cecilia (1980-1989), and St. Martin de Porres (1989-1993). After his retirement as parish priest, he provided Sunday ministry at Regina Pioneer Village and the Pasqua Hospital.\n\nFr. Hogan was Vicar General from February 1975 until November 1993. In April 1994, after the death of Archbishop Charles Halpin, the College of Consultors elected Msgr. Hogan to be Diocesan Administrator. He held that position until July 1995, with the installation of the Most Reverend Peter Mallon as Archbishop.\n\nOver the course of 77 years of priesthood, his accomplishments only hint at the depth of our Fr. Mike. Thousands were touched by his devotion and humanity. He was also a key member of our family in Canada. Many years ago, his cousin, Marie Nolan, came from Ireland to visit him in Kenaston, SK. She stayed in Saskatchewan, and met Walter Luchenski. They married, and began a family that loved him deeply and knew him well. He was our cousin, confidante, and dear friend. Since childhood, I (Tekla Luchenski) called him my Buddy-in-law, and we were close forever. We moved around as a family, so we would keep in touch with letters. I was always the designated letter reader in our family, since I was the only person who could read his writing. He married Walter and Marie, and was an important spiritual and personal support for them. In time, he buried them. He baptized and married us, their four children. When we started families, he baptized our children too. In between sacraments, he was always an anchor in our family. No celebration was complete without him. We spent many summers growing up visiting him at his rectory, wherever he was. He taught us chess, with his “special” rules. We had animated discussions about our faith, and he would always respond thoughtfully, and candidly, challenging us in return. We teased him with childish pranks, and laughed at his antics. We shared him with a community we couldn’t fathom, but he was always our Fr. Mike.\n\nNephew Gerard Stembridge (Dublin, Ireland), sent words of condolence to his Canadian family that captured Msgr. Hogan’s character. He wrote, “It was truly a remarkable life and Fr. Michael, as we called him in Ireland, was a significant advertisement for the virtues of a life full of riches but lived in moderation. I remember his visits to Ireland and how impressed I always was with the considerable range of his intelligence and yet how lightly he wore it. His interests and knowledge were wide and he knew how to talk to anyone, anywhere. He had a keen wit which he balanced with a gentle manner. He ate with delight, but only just enough. He enjoyed a drink but only on occasion. Even when he walked… [it was] easy and relaxed; he strolled, never anxious or hurried, and yet he was always on time. He enjoyed visiting friends and relatives but never outstayed his welcome. I particularly enjoyed how he would announce his departure politely and then leave immediately – so unlike the Irish style of saying goodbye, but lingering, of almost leaving, then lingering again, ‘and just one more thing…’. I have no doubt that at some point yesterday he said to himself, ‘It is time to leave,’ and he went.”\n\nIreland was always in Msgr. Hogan’s heart, and he returned regularly to visit his family. When the covid-19 crisis is over, he will find his final resting place in Limerick, together with his parents. Still, Saskatchewan was also his home. He said, “Regina is a marvelous place to live. Within 15 minutes, you can be almost anywhere. You have all the amenities you need for a big city and the people are just delightful. What more can you ask for?”\n\nHis was a life to be cherished, remembered, celebrated, and emulated.\n\nThe family extends heartfelt thanks to the Daughters of Mary Mother of the Church, who cared for Msgr. Hogan at Martha House and then at Trinity Manor. Sr. Jessica was especially kind to him, and to his family. May God continue to bless them in their work, and to bless us with them. Donations in Msgr. Hogan’s memory may be made to the Education of Priests Fund, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Regina, 445 Broad Street North, Regina, SK S4R 2X8.\n\n“When he shall die,\n\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\n\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\n\nThat all the world will be in love with night\n\nAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.”\n\n(William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet)\n\nDue to the covid-19 restrictions, a Private Funeral Mass will be held on Monday, April 27, 2020 at 10:30 a.m. Relatives and friends may reach out to the Hogan family by visiting Msgr. Hogan’s Tribute Page at www.speersfuneralchapel.com to let them know that you are thinking of them during this difficult time.

Michael Hogan’s Tribute Page.\n\nReverend Murton Miller\n\nFather Murton Miller passed away in Edmonton on Saturday, August 3, 2019, at the age of 93 years. Father Miller was born in 1926 in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. He was ordained on July 1, 1962 for the Diocese of Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan (now merged with the Archdiocese of Regina). Fr. Murton served in Swift Current, Gull Lake and missions, Mankota and missions, Rockglen and Lisieux, Maple Creek and Tompkins. In 1994, when he retired, he took up residence in the Archdiocese of Edmonton. During that time, he offered assistance in parishes throughout the Archdiocese when pastors needed a replacement. Father Murton is lovingly remembered by his brother, Bernard Miller, and several nieces and nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews. He was predeceased by his parents, Alfred and Cecelia (nee Thibodeau), and his brothers, Eldon and Leonard. A Funeral Mass presided by Most Reverend Richard Smith, Archbishop of Edmonton will take place on Thursday, August 8, 2019 at 3:00 p.m. at St. Andrew Catholic Church, 12810-111 Avenue, Edmonton.

He had met and worked several times with Mother Teresa and with that influence built the Mother Teresa Retreat Centre at Kenosee Lake, near Carlyle. “He was doing what he loved to do,” said Wallis. “I thank God I had 10 days with him here before we took him to the airport for his visit to India.”\n\nNiece Jennifer Tourney described her uncle as a prankster who loved to play cards and tell stories. “Joy was important to him.” Tourney for 20 summers worked at the Kome N See camp and described Banga as a man who loved people. “He had two horses, Bucky and Buddy, he hitched to a wagon and used it in parades in Stockholm and gave rides to kids at the camp.” He also loved music and together they attended several concerts at the Los Angeles Religious Education Conference.

Adam is survived by three brothers, Joseph, Fr. Anthony and Ignatius; and one sister Sr. Magdalena. He was predeceased by two brothers, Fr. Carlos and Frank; and one sister Mary. His earthly journey began in Kendal, SK, on October 10, 1917, the third of eight children born to Adam and Mary (Wild) Sebastian, and was given the name “Jacob.” However, at some point in time he answered to the name “Jack,” and later, upon entering religious life, Jack took a new name, “Adam.” Adam was one of three brothers who joined the Franciscan Friars. He was received into the Franciscan Order in 1936, and spent his initial formation years in Sherbrooke, Quebec City and Montreal, QC. In 1937 he made his first profession of vows, and then made solemn profession to the Franciscan Order in Montreal, in 1940. Four years of theological studies later, Adam was ordained a priest at Holy Rosary Cathedral, in Regina, SK. After ordination, Adam moved to St. Anthony’s College, in Edmonton, AB, where he was teacher, principal, rector and guardian.

In 1955, at the age of 38, Adam was named, by the Minister General for the Franciscan Order the first “Autonomous Custos” of the newly created independent religious entity, “The Franciscans of Western Canada.” Most of Adam’s Franciscan life was lived at St. Michael’s Retreat, in Lumsden, SK, and the majority of his years in ministry were spent in southern SK. In the summer of 2002, at the age of 84, Adam decided it was time to retire from being a pastor of three parishes, St. Peter’s, in Lumsden, SK, St. Jerome’s, in Regina Beach, SK, and St. Anne’s, in Chamberlain, SK, where he had served for 28, 27 and 25 years respectively. Previously, he was also the pastor of St. Francis of Assisi Parish in Edmonton, AB, for three years (1961-1964) and St. Francis of Assisi Parish, in Calgary, AB, for nine years (1964-1973). Lastly, one of Adam’s outstanding contributions was the 34 years he selflessly dedicated to administrating the Franciscan Missionary Union (1973-2007), a Franciscan fund-raising organization for missionary activities in underdeveloped countries, especially Peru. A Mass of the Resurrection will be celebrated at Holy Family Roman Catholic Church, 1021 McCarthy Blvd. North, in Regina, SK, at 10:00 am, on Wednesday, November 6, 2013, with Fr.
