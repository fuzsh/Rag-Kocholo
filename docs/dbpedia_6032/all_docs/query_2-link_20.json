        "text": "«Events - 4P at the Spring meetings»\n\n4P Ministerial-level event : The 4P Community: United in shaping an international financial system fit for today\n\nWashington D.C. – Thursday April 18, 2024, from 1:30 pm to 3:00 pm, By invitation only\n\nThis 4P meeting held at ministerial-level will provide a timely opportunity for the 4P community to come together to discuss decisive actions for the reform of the international financial architecture, focusing on key operational takeaways for the IMF/WB Spring meetings. It will also provide an opportunity to showcase the progress made on several 4P initiatives aiming to mobilize additional financing for climate, nature and development.\n\n4P Coalition meetings: In-person Tax Task Force sherpa-level meeting (April 17th) , Coal Transition Commission Meeting (April 18th)\n\nMia MOTTLEY\n\nThe Honourable Mia Amor Mottley, S.C., M.P., became Barbados' eighth and first female Prime Minister on May 25, 2018.\n\nMs. Mottley was elected to the Parliament of Barbados in September 1994 as part of the new Barbados Labour Party Government.\n\nPrior to that, she served as one of two Opposition Senators between 1991 and 1994. One of the youngest persons ever to be assigned a ministerial portfolio, Ms. Mottley was appointed Minister of Education, Youth Affairs and Culture from 1994 to 2001.\n\nShe later served as Attorney General and Deputy Prime Minister of Barbados from 2001 to 2008 and was the first female to hold that position.\n\nMs. Mottley is an Attorney-at-law with a degree from the London School of Economics, specialising in advocacy. She is also a Barrister of the Bar of England and Wales.\n\nIn 2002, she became a member of the Local Privy Council. She was also admitted to the Inner Bar, becoming the youngest ever Queens Counsel in Barbados.\n\nAntónio GUTERRES\n\nAntónio Guterres, le neuvième Secrétaire général de l'Organisation des Nations Unies, a pris ses fonctions le 1er janvier 2017.\n\nAyant été témoin de la souffrance des êtres humains les plus vulnérables de la planète, des camps de réfugiés aux zones de guerre, le Secrétaire général est résolu à mettre la dignité humaine au cœur de son action. Dans une période de défis mondiaux sans précédent, il s'est appuyé sur son engagement envers la Charte des Nations Unies pour mobiliser le monde et lancer des actions pour répondre à la pandémie de COVID-19, faire face à l'urgence climatique, faire progresser l'égalité des sexes et réaliser des réformes ambitieuses au XXIe siècle pour renforcer les efforts cruciaux entrepris par l'Organisation pour assurer la paix, le développement durable, les droits de l'homme et l'aide humanitaire.\n\nAvant sa nomination, M. Guterres a été Haut-Commissaire des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés de juin 2005 à décembre 2015. Son mandat à la tête de l'un des principaux organismes humanitaires du monde a été marqué par les vagues de déplacement sans précédent de ces dernières décennies. Les conflits en Syrie et en Iraq et les crises qui secouent le Soudan du Sud, la République centrafricaine et le Yémen ont obligé le HCR à multiplier ses activités alors que le nombre de déplacés ayant fui les conflits ou les persécutions passait de 38 millions en 2005 à plus de 60 millions en 2015.\n\nAvant de travailler au HCR, M. Guterres a passé plus d'une vingtaine d'années au service de l'État et dans la fonction publique. Il a été Premier Ministre du Portugal de 1995 à 2002, période au cours de laquelle il a joué un rôle de premier plan dans l'action internationale engagée pour mettre fin à la crise du Timor Leste.\n\nAu début de l'année 2000, en sa qualité de Président du Conseil européen, il a dirigé la procédure d'adoption de la Stratégie de Lisbonne pour la croissance et l'emploi et coprésidé le premier sommet Union européenne-Afrique. De 1991 à 2002, il a été membre du Conseil d'État portugais.\n\nEn 1976, M. Guterres a été élu au Parlement portugais, où il a siégé pendant 17 ans. Au cours de cette période, il a présidé la Commission parlementaire de l'économie, des finances et de la planification, puis la Commission parlementaire de l'administration territoriale, des municipalités et de l'environnement. Il a également été chef du groupe parlementaire de son parti.\n\nDe 1981 à 1983, M. Guterres a été membre de l'Assemblée parlementaire du Conseil de l'Europe, où il a présidé la Commission des migrations, des réfugiés et de la démographie.\n\nPendant de nombreuses années, M. Guterres a été un membre actif de l'Internationale socialiste, une alliance mondiale de partis politiques sociodémocrates. Il en a été le vice-président de 1992 à 1999, période à laquelle il a coprésidé le Comité Afrique et, plus tard, le Comité Développement. De 1999 à mi-2005, il a présidé l'Internationale socialiste. Il a en outre fondé le Conseil portugais pour les réfugiés et l'Association de défense des consommateurs portugais DECO et présidé, au début des années 70, le Centro de Acção Social Universitário, une association mettant en place des projets de développement social dans les quartiers pauvres de Lisbonne.\n\nM. Guterres est membre du Club de Madrid, une alliance démocratique réunissant d'anciens chefs d'État et de gouvernement du monde entier.\n\nM. Guterres est né à Lisbonne en 1949. Il est titulaire d'un diplôme d'ingénieur de l'Instituto Superior Técnico. Il parle couramment le portugais, l'anglais, le français et l'espagnol. Il est marié à Catarina de Almeida Vaz Pinto et a deux enfants, un beau-fils et trois petits-enfants.\n\nL'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies adopte par acclamation le 13 octobre 2016 une résolution nommant António Guterres du Portugal au poste de Secrétaire général, pour un mandant de cinq ans, à compter du 1er janvier 2017.\n\nKristalina GEORGIEVA\n\nKristalina Georgieva a été nommée au poste de directrice générale du FMI le 25 septembre 2019. Elle a pris ses fonctions le 1er octobre 2019.\n\nAvant d'arriver au FMI, Mme Georgieva a été directrice générale de la Banque mondiale de janvier 2017 à septembre 2019, et a assuré pendant trois mois la présidence par intérim du Groupe de la Banque mondiale.\n\nAuparavant, Mme Georgieva a contribué à façonner le programme de travail de l'Union européenne. En tant que vice-présidente de la Commission européenne chargée du budget et des ressources humaines, elle était responsable du budget de 161 milliards d'euros (175 milliards de dollars) de l'Union européenne, ainsi que des 33 000 agents de la Commission. À ce poste, elle a activement participé aux efforts visant à régler la crise de la dette de la zone euro, puis la crise migratoire de 2015. Elle a également été commissaire européenne chargée de la coopération internationale, de l'aide humanitaire et de la réponse aux crises, gérant à ce titre un des plus importants budgets d'aide humanitaire au monde.\n\nAvant son passage à la Commission européenne, Mme Georgieva avait travaillé pendant 17 ans à la Banque mondiale, où elle s'était hissée en 2008 au poste de vice-présidente et secrétaire, assurant ainsi la liaison entre la haute direction, le conseil des administrateurs et les pays actionnaires du Groupe de la Banque mondiale.\n\nElle avait auparavant occupé d'autres hautes fonctions à la Banque : directrice du développement durable ; directrice pour la Fédération de Russie, à Moscou ; directrice de l'environnement ; et directrice de l'environnement et du développement social pour la région Asie de l'Est et Pacifique. Son arrivée à la Banque mondiale, en tant qu'économiste spécialiste de l'environnement, remontait à 1993.\n\nMme Georgieva est membre de nombreuses commissions internationales : elle copréside la Global Commission on Adaptation (« commission mondiale sur l'adaptation ») ainsi que le groupe de haut niveau des Nations Unies sur le financement humanitaire. Elle a à son actif plus d'une centaine de publications sur des thématiques environnementales et économiques, dont des manuels de macro et microéconomie.\n\nNée à Sofia (Bulgarie) en 1953, Mme Georgieva est titulaire d'un doctorat en sciences économiques et d'une maîtrise en économie politique et sociologie de l'Université d'économie nationale et mondiale de Sofia, où elle a été professeure agrégée de 1977 à 1993.
