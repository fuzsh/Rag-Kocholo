        "text": "Courtesy of AP\n\nIt is a sad reality of man’s history that some leaders come with the best of intentions but when given a chance on the national stage, they turn themselves into dictators. Mussolini, Hitler, Pol Pot of Cambodia, Slobadan Milosovic of Serbia come to mind. In modern day Africa, the names Idi Amin, Mobutu Sese Seko and Jean Bedel Bokassa stand out as past dictators. We cannot accurately predict the final script to the life of the Liberian dictator, Charles McArthur Ghankay Darkpana Taylor. Charles Taylor was recently apprehended while trying to flee from justice. He was transported immediately to Monrovia, Liberia, read his rights and handcuffed and flown to Freetown Sierra Leone, where he is about to stand trial. Historians, journalists and social commentators stand by to write the final chapter of his life.\n\nThere are those who argue that Sierra Leone may be considered hostile environment for the upcoming trial; they argue for a change of venue – they prefer The Hague, Netherlands. There are others who would prefer to see Charles Taylor stand trial in Liberia, where he is said to have committed the most heinous crimes against the Liberian nation while serving as president. Yet there are those who argue bitterly that trying Charles Taylor could inflame bitterness among Liberians. Their argument is that Charles Taylor did not, indeed could not act alone in destroying the country. Would it then be fair to try him while his partners in crime walk freely? They think it’s only fair to set up a commission that will put all on trial or extend amnesty to Charles Taylor in the name of national reconciliation and unity.\n\nHow will Charles Taylor’s life history end? Now I do wish I had a crystal ball, but I don’t, yet I’m willing to bet I have a clue. Some wise one once said, “To know the present and reveal the future, one must study the past”. The relevant question before us is, by the time all this hoopla dies down, what will become the ultimate fate of Charles Taylor? To answer this question, without the use of a crystal ball, I recommend we take a peek at the lives of some former dictators. There are predictable patterns in their ultimate demises that may give us a useful glimpse into the future."
