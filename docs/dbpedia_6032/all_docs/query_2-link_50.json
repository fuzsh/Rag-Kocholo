        "text": "On a recent trip to Korea to review education technology solutions, I was overjoyed to hear from government counterparts and World Bank staff about the excellence of African Ph.D science scholars studying in Korean Universities, selected under the PASET RSIF program. In the coming days, I will showcase some of these scholars who are working to make Africa resilient and stronger. I am excited for all of you to see and read the stories of grit, determination and success. The Regional Scholarship and Innovation Fund (RSIF) is a pan-African science fund for Ph.D training, post doctoral research and innovation. I am proud to have helped conceputalize and operationalize it, working together with other Bank colleagues, and above all Minsters from African governments, who were the first to contribute to the Fund . The Government of Korea also announced a US$ 10 million grant to the program, spurred by the commitment of the African governments. The World Bank had been providing technical assistance to design the program but came in with funding only after these first movers. Under the program, African universities enter into a partnership with selected high quality universities outside the continent for joint Ph.D training. Students are competitively selected across sub-Saharan Africa, and spend two years in the partner universities. Thanks to the grant from the Govt of Korea, the best Korean universities became international partners. The program encourages cutting-edge research that addresses the continent’s most pressing challenges in areas like ICT, energy, food security, and more. Scholars work on African problems while receiving world-class education and mentorship, and African universities and international partners strengthen their collaboration through joint research. I made several trips to Korea about 6 years ago to get the government's support and recall some of the doubts expressed by Korean universities in the initial period about whether the African students would be able to cope with the tough work culture. How gratifying to hear the overwhelmingly positive feedback about these students ! Back in March, I embarked on a journey to connect with the beneficiaries of the fund, focusing on women, to understand how it has benefited them and to highlight their life’s journey. Here’s a roundup of the posts I did in March: https://lnkd.in/gJvztzWd. In future posts, please read about the students who chose to go to Korea. https://lnkd.in/gbaVqCVr #PASETRSIF #AfricanScholars #PhD #NationBuilding #EducationReform\n\nI was happy to moderate a session at VMFT featuring my colleague from the World Bank, Xiaoyan Liang, who spoke about the Teacher Research Group system of teacher professional development in China and its application in Tanzania. Xiaoyan is Lead Education Specialist and has worked in East Asia, Africa and Latin America. She wrote the influential book \"How Shanghai Does It\" which explores the details of Shanghai's efforts to improve education quality and focus on improving student learning. We have worked together during my time at the Bank, and have shared our collective vision of bringing about sustainable changes to educational systems around the world, and specifically developing countries. In the online session, Xiaoyan shared her experience with the Teacher Research Group (TRG) system that was adopted in China in the 1950s, and how it has revolutionised teaching methods there, specifically Shanghai. The system has also helped catapult the teaching profession to a highly respectable career choice. She also shared live examples of the system's success in a developing country like Tanzania.

In a global economy driven by innovation and technology, acquiring new skills is more critical than ever. From digital literacy to leadership, from technical expertise to creative problem-solving, these skills are the key to unlocking endless opportunities. The Digital Economy for Africa framework of the World Bank, which took shape around 2018, jumpstarted some systematic work on digital skills for Africa, I recall some of the discussions at that time within the Bank – what do we mean by digital skills? Are digital skills need to be distinguished from broader technical skills ? Much of that discussion seems redundant now. Digital skills are becoming increasingly critical across the globe and more and more countries are discussing frameworks, digital literacy programs for the general population and how to incorporate digital skills into school education, technical education and higher education. Still, the question of defining digital skills remains challenging. In particular, Africa lacked a comprehensive framework for digital skills. As part of the team developing the framework for digital skills, and how to build digital skills capacity, a number of publications were developed, which are still relevant, and were adopted in other regions. See them here https://lnkd.in/dK8MY85 https://lnkd.in/gD3NZcDY https://lnkd.in/dxYudVB\n\nUNESCO recently released its “Greening curriculum guidance: teaching and learning for climate action”, with the objective of having 90 percent of all countries include climate change in their curricula by 2030. Apart from guidance, however, what is really required to help developing countries prepare the next generation to deal with climate challenges? One such attempt was a recent seminar organized by Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT), in collaboration with the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), to promote education on climate change and environment sustainability in Kerala. This effort was recognized on a global platform when The Global Innovation Network for Teaching and Learning (GINTL) cooperation featured our seminar on their website. You can read all about it https://lnkd.in/grGrwBzV. GINTL brings together dedicated researchers and practitioners from Finland and partners from China, India and the African continent to contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4: “Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. One finding of the seminar was that there is no mention of climate change in the Kerala curriculum, although Kerala has a State Climate Action Plan. The seminar emphasized the need for contextually relevant materials in local language to reach the grass root levels and give students the opportunity to learn about the causes and effects of climate change. A concrete outcome of the seminar is that a group of teachers is working on a climate change curriculum for coastal communities in Kerala. This year, travelling between and working on different parts of the world, I have been struck by how little discussion there is about educating students about climate change, why it happens and what can be done. I have witnessed the distinct change in climate and also the growing understanding amongst policy makers and ordinary people in developing countries about the impacts on their lives. After the grueling summers of Kerala, the rains descended in torrents resulting in floods. In the meantime, temperatures in Delhi hit 50 degrees Celsius. In Nepal and Bhutan, melting snows threaten landslides and floods. Sri Lanka is threat. According to a recent report, the number of days with extreme heat is expected to rise from 20 days to more than 100 days by the end of the century, under one scenario. Yet, the gulf between the real world of climate change and the education system is palpable. Check the VMFT report and recommendations https://lnkd.in/gsFidUf7. Let me know in the comments what else can be done GINTL – Global Innovation Network for Teaching and Learning University of Jyväskylä TISS-Centre of Excellence in Teacher Education Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust\n\nWhen we talk of climate change, environment sustainability, leaving a better world behind us, etc. it mainly revolves around adults, organisations or government initiatives. How to address climate change and sustainability through education and mobilizing of young people is a question that needs to be addressed more urgently. Education systems in developing countries face multiple problems already, but there is no choice but to address our planetary challenges as a priority. Who are the beneficiaries of these changes that we hope to see in the future? Who will ultimately benefit from our action or inaction? The next generations, of course. So, apart from focusing on reversing the damage that's already done, the coming generations have to learn about how to reduce the carbon footprint and adapt to climate conditions in their local contexts, protect biodiversity and the environment. Small steps taken in the right direction can go a long way in creating conscious individuals who will work towards creating a resilient world. As mentioned in my last post, Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT), in collaboration with the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), organised a two-day seminar on education research and environment sustainability in Kerala. Check the slides to see the challenges that are dogging the education system in this most advanced state of India, highlighted by researchers and presenters. Teaching about climate has to address these challenges. As a follow up, an \"informal\" climate curriculum for primary and upper primary students is being developed. Drop your ideas in the comments.

Nine of the ten warmest years were in the last decades 2013-2024. https://lnkd.in/gVHctaMW Unseasonal rainfall, the possibility of flooding and sea level rise are imminent dangers that create risks for the entire population, in one of the most densely populated coastal states of India. Kerala is one of the few states to have a Climate Change Action Plan, covering many sectors. But one sector is missing: education. Across the world, preparing the younger generation for climate change adaptation and mitigation without creating climate anxiety has become a great challenge. How should education systems deal with these risks to the planet through curricula, teacher training and extra curricular activities? How should education systems build resilience to ensure education continuity in the face of possible natural disasters? The Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT), in collaboration with the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), organized a two-day seminar on education research and environment sustainability in Kerala. The two main objectives of the seminar were to develop a research agenda on climate and sustainability education in the state and, to propose ideas for developing and integrating climate change education into school curriculum. The participants of the seminar included university faculty, teachers, researchers, the media and speakers from UNICEF India office, the Global Partnership for Education, the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the University of Jyväskylä (Finland) In the coming days and weeks, I will share snippets from the seminar. #WorldEarthDay #Sustainability #Environment #EarlyEducation\n\nHappy to have participated in a talk on March 11 by Dr. Dilip Menon at Cornell University on “Speaking Across the Ocean - Vakkom Mohammed Maulavi and the Idea of a Public Sphere”. Dr. Menon is the Director, Centre for Indian Studies in Africa, University of Witwatersrand and does research in world literatures, cultural history and cultural anthropology. https://lnkd.in/gXjJuQM4 Vakkom Mohammed Abdul Khader Moulavi, (1873-1932) was a social reformer, educator, prolific writer, Muslim scholar, journalist and advocate for people’s rights in Travancore, Kerala, India. A major focus of his work was on education, especially of women. He started the celebrated newspaper The Svadeshabhimani on 19 January 1905, declaring that \"the paper will not hesitate to expose injustices to the people in any form\", which was suppressed in 1910 for its exposure of corruption and demands for accountability from the princely government. Analysing the newspaper Deepika, edited by Vakkom Moulavi, who was influenced by the reformist Egyptian newspaper al Manar, Dr. Menon highlighted the circulation of ideas of reform and modernism across the Indian Ocean. The adaptation and development of these ideas in the concrete conditions of Travancore, where a host of other social reformers of other communities were also advocating for education, equality and social progress, provides an example of the struggle for rights as part of “the conjoined lives” of people of different religions in this princely state. Having overseen the digitization and translation The Svadesabhimani, over the last year, I can testify to the richness of the debates and arguments over education, public accountability and democratic rights, that helped make Kerala the development outlier that it became soon after independence. #cornelluniversity #VMFT #indianocean #asianstudies #southasia\n\nOnly 19% of computer and information science majors are women Nearly 80% of the health care workforce are women, but only about 21% of health executives and board members are women Only 38% of women who major in computers work in computer fields Only 24% of those who majored in engineering work in the engineering field Men in STEM annual salaries are nearly $15,000 higher per year than women ($85,000 compared to $60,828). And Latina and Black women in STEM earn around $33,000 less (at an average of around $52,000 a year) These hard facts in a report by AAUW for the US, show that so many barriers remain even in so-called advanced countries. The situation in many developing countries is so much worse. Having worked on several programs at the World Bank, to build science and technology capacity and #WomeninSTEM, from India to Latin America to Africa, I can say that paying attention to details and listening to women makes all the difference. For instance, in designing and implement PASET-Rsif we had to consider how will a woman from DRC go to study in a university in Ghana and then spend 2 years in a Korean partner university, for the sandwich Ph.D. program? What visible and invisible barriers does she face? And what if the woman has a child? The RSIF program now has 37% women scholars because we could address these “small” issues. All through last month I have had the pleasure of interacting with students, researchers and women in science who are doing groundbreaking work. In case you missed those posts, here is a roundup. The theme for this #InternationalWomen'sDay, #InspireInclusion, is directly in line with my beliefs and I hope more women follow their heart to dream big and achieve their goals. If you know of more #WomeninSTEM, do tag them in the comments.\n\nI had the pleasure of sharing my thoughts at the “Science and Technology at the World Bank: Recommendations to President Ajay Banga,” webinar organized by the Center for Science Diplomacy. The webinar was a follow up discussion to the article that was published in the AAAS journal’s Science & Diplomacy Online Publication in Dec, 2023. It featured other prominent peers such as Alfred Watkins, Charles Weiss, Gordon Myers and Klaus Tilmes. We were invited to share our thoughts on how the World Bank could use rapid advances in Science & Technology to promote development and how to support capacity building in Africa and low income countries in the long term.
