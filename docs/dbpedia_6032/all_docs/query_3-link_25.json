        "text": "For years now, heads of state and government, academics and development experts have been calling on the World Bank to lead in the fight against climate change.\n\nFor too long, they say, the international lender had ignored the growing threats posed by rising temperatures and sea levels, been too conservative with its lending to developing countries struggling with climate disasters, and spent too much money supporting fossil fuels, the burning of which is dangerously heating the planet.\n\nMia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, led the charge, rolling out a reform agenda known as the Bridgetown Initiative and rallying others, including Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, to join her.\n\nAt the United Nations climate talks in Dubai, which began Nov. 30 and run until Dec. 12, it is clear that much is changing at the World Bank.\n\nAjay Banga, 64, the former chief executive of Mastercard, took over as president in June. He replaced David Malpass, who was nominated by President Trump and stepped down early after coming under fire for disputing the science of climate change in a live interview with The New York Times.\n\nAnd while the World Bank has not instituted the sort of sweeping overhaul envisioned by its most ardent critics, Mr. Banga, an Indian-born American, has over the past six months made a series of changes that he said are aimed at addressing the climate crisis.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
