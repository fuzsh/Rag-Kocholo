The road map explains why several factors serve as barriers to attracting investors into blue finance, such as limited awareness of blue opportunities, a lack of investment-ready projects, and insufficient monitoring. It also outlines how decision makers can drive investment flows to the sector and safeguard Thailandâ€™s blue economic growth by creating an enabling environment and developing financing mechanisms such as blue bonds, loans, and grants. ðŸ‘‰ Link to report and video page in the comments. #thailand #southeastasia #blueeconomy #oceanhealth #sustainablefisheries #bluetourism #blueinvestment #bluefinance #bluebonds\n\nIt was an honor to attend the recent GoL and Development Partners Joint Liberia Portfolio Performance ReviewðŸ˜Š.
