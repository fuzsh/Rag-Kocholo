        "text": "The paradox of diversity at Paris 2024 Olympic Games\n\nThe opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games was a spectacular display of diversity, but it also exposed deep contradictions.\n\nOne notable controversy involved a tableau inspired by Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, featuring LGBTQ+ icon Barbara Butch. It was criticised by some as a provocative mockery of a sacred Christian scene. The organisers have clarified that it was not inspired by The Last Supper.\n\nAfter facing racist backlash from far-right groups and politicians who questioned her role as a representative of French culture, French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, who is the world’s most listened to French artist, attended the ceremony with a powerful performance accompanied by a live band from the French Republican Guard.\n\nObservers agree that the inclusive message of the ceremony contrasts sharply with the reality on the ground in Paris. Muslim athletes like Sounkamba Sylla faced a ban on wearing headscarves, and thousands of residents were evicted to make way for the Games."
