All the genera are taxonomically well circumscribed except the species rich genera Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis which lack a recent taxonomic revision. Here, we used a robust phylogenomic approach, including all the 90 currently accepted species, with several specimens per species, and based on more than 300 Annonaceae-specific nuclear genes, to infer the phylogenetic tree of the Monodoreae and test the limits between the genera and species. We recover all the genera as monophyletic, except the genus Uvariopsis for which the species Uvariopsistripetala falls outside this clade. We thus reinstate the monotypic genus Dennettia for its single species Dennettiatripetala. We also erect a new tribe, Ophrypetaleae trib. nov., to accommodate the genera Ophrypetalum and Sanrafaelia, as we recover them excluded from the Monodoreae tribe with good support. Below the genus level, the genera Isolona, Monodora, Uvariastrum, Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis show weakly supported nodes and phylogenetic conflicts, suggesting that population level processes of evolution might occur in these clades. Our results also support, at the molecular level, the description of several new species of Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis, as well as several new synonymies. Finally, we present a taxonomic revision of the genera Dennettia, Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis, which contain one, 18 and 17 species respectively. We provide a key to the 11 genera of the Monodoraeae and describe four new species to science: Uvariodendronkimbozaense Dagallier & Couvreur, sp. nov., Uvariodendronmossambicense Robson ex Dagallier & Couvreur, sp. nov., Uvariodendronpilosicarpum Dagallier & Couvreur, sp. nov. and Uvariopsisoligocarpa Dagallier & Couvreur, sp. nov., and provide provisional descriptions of three putatively new species. We also present lectotypifications and nomenclatural changes implying synonymies and new combinations (Uvariodendroncitriodorum (Le Thomas) Dagallier & Couvreur, comb. et stat. nov., Uvariodendronfuscumvar.magnificum (Verdc.)

Tout les genres sont taxonomiquement bien rÃ©solus, Ã  part les genres Uvariodendron et Uvariopsis qui manquent dâune rÃ©vision taxonomique rÃ©cente. Ici, nous avons utilisÃ© une approche phylogÃ©nomique robuste pour estimer lâarbre phylogÃ©nÃ©tique des Monodoreae, et tester les limites de genres et dâespÃ¨ces. Pour cela, nous avons inclut les 90 espÃ¨ces acceptÃ©es, et avons sÃ©quencÃ© plus de 300 gÃ¨nes. Tous les genres sont retrouvÃ©s monophylÃ©tiques, Ã  part le genre Uvariopsis pour lequel lâespÃ¨ce Uvariopsistripetala se retrouve exclue. Nous rÃ©tablissons donc le genre monotypique Dennettia et son unique espÃ¨ce Dennettiatripetala. Nous Ã©rigeons une nouvelle tribu, les Ophrypetaleae trib. nov., pour accueillir les genres Ophrypetalum et Sanrafaelia, car nous les retrouvons exclus de la tribu des Monodoreae avec un bon support. Au niveau infra-gÃ©nÃ©rique, les genres Isolona, Monodora, Uvariastrum, Uvariodendron et Uvariopsis montrent de faibles supports de noeuds et des conflits phylogÃ©nÃ©tiques, ce qui suggÃ¨re que des processus dâÃ©volution se dÃ©roulent au niveau des populations.

Nous effectuons des lectotypifications et des changements nomenclaturaux tels que des synonymies et des nouvelles combinaisons (Uvariodendroncitriodorum (Le Thomas) Dagallier & Couvreur, comb. et stat. nov., Uvariodendronfuscumvar.magnificum (Verdc.)

Dagallier & Couvreur, comb. stat. nov.).\n\nIntroduction\n\nAnnonaceae is a diverse pantropical family of trees, shrubs and lianas mostly restricted to tropical rain forests. Recent work based on molecular phylogenetics has classified Annonaceae into four subfamilies and several tribes (Chatrou et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2017a; Couvreur et al. 2019). Within the Annonoideae subfamily, tribe Monodoreae â previously referred to as the âAfrican long-branch cladeâ (Couvreur et al. 2008a) â is composed of species distributed exclusively in tropical Africa and Madagascar. Before this study, the tribe was composed of 11 genera and ca. 90 species.\n\nMonodoreae is a diverse clade of trees and small shrubs with one species (Monodoracrispata) reported to be a lianescent (Couvreur 2009). Some genera, such as Uvariodendron, conform to the typical Annonaceae floral model of three sepals with alternating two whorls of three free petals, numerous free carpels (apocarpy) and bisexual flowers (van Heusden 1992; Couvreur et al. 2008b). In contrast, several genera within the tribe deviate from this pattern. For example, the genus Uvariopsis has dimerous flowers (two sepals and four petals) and individuals are unisexual, while the genera Asteranthe, Hexalobus, Isolona, Monodora, Sanrafaelia, and some species of Uvariopsis have fused inner and outer petals forming a single whorl. The genera Isolona and Monodora have prezygotically fused carpels, i.e. syncarpous gynoecia, which is unique in Annonaceae (Deroin 1985; Couvreur et al. 2008b; Couvreur 2009). This important diversity renders a clear morphological circumscription of the Monodoreae tribe complicated. To date it has however been recognized by the combination of the mainly tree or shrub habit, indumentum of simple hairs, and especially sessile or shortly stipitate monocarps (Couvreur et al. 2008b; Chatrou et al. 2012). Most of the genera have been taxonomically revised (Couvreur 2009, 2014; Botermans et al. 2011; Gosline et al. 2019) except for the monotypic genera Monocyclanthus, Ophrypetalum and Sanrafaelia, and the genus Asteranthe with two species (Vollesen 1980). Recently, a new genus including two species, Lukea, was described from East Africa (Cheek et al. 2022). Morphologically, Lukea was suggested to be close to the Monodoreae genera Mischogyne and Monocyclanthus and thus potentially belongs to this tribe (Cheek et al. 2022).\n\nIn contrast to the recent taxonomic revisions cited above, recent revisionary work for the two most diverse genera of the tribe, Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis, are more than 80 years old (Fries 1930; Robyns and GhesquiÃ¨re 1933a). Several new species were described since then (Verdcourt 1971a; Gereau and Kenfack 2000; Kenfack et al. 2003; Couvreur and Luke 2010; Dagallier et al. 2021; Couvreur et al. 2022; Gosline et al. 2022) warranting a new taxonomic revision of both genera. The taxonomic history of Uvariopsis is complex with several expansions of the concept of the genus. For example, Kenfack et al. (2003) combined the monotypic genus Dennettia Baker f. into Uvariopsis, expanding the concept of this genus to having trimerous and dimerous flowers. This was supported by a molecular phylogeny based on few plastid markers (Couvreur et al. 2008a; but only included three species of Uvariopsis), and was recently contested based on morphological grounds (Cheek et al. 2022).\n\nReconstruction of phylogenetic relationships in species-rich clades such as Annonaceae is challenging. Several phylogenetic analyses have focused on the whole family (Doyle et al. 2004; Richardson et al. 2004; Guo et al. 2017a; Xue et al. 2020) or on particular tribes or genera (Couvreur et al. 2008a, b; Couvreur 2009; Thomas et al. 2012; Chaowasku et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2015; Guo et al. 2017b; Ortiz-Rodriguez et al. 2018). These phylogenies were reconstructed using few molecular markers (generally less than 10 chloroplast markers), although more recent studies included more and more markers (Guo et al. 2018; Lopes et al. 2018). In the Monodoreae tribe, phylogenetic relationships between the genera have been inferred with relatively strong statistical support in several molecular phylogenetic studies based on a few chloroplast markers (Couvreur et al. 2008a; Guo et al. 2017a; Xue et al. 2020). These studies inferred three main clades, referred to here as: the âIsolona cladeâ, (containing the genera Asteranthe, Hexalobus, Uvariastrum, Isolona, and Monodora), the âUvariopsis cladeâ (containing the genera Uvariopsis, Monocyclanthus, Uvariodendron, and Mischogyne), and the Ophrypetalum â Sanrafaelia clade (with just two species). This later clade was recovered as sister to the rest of the Monodoraeae tribe with moderate to strong support based on phylogenetic analyses of plastid markers. The development of phylogenomics in Annonaceae (Couvreur et al. 2019) not only brought new insights to the understanding of the evolution of the family and of the tropical rain forests (BrÃ©e et al. 2020; Helmstetter et al. 2020a, b), but also clarified the systematics of the family. For example, the African genus Annickia was inferred to be excluded from Piptostigmateae, and erected as a new monogeneric tribe Annickieae (Couvreur et al. 2019). Some Monodoreae genera were also included in this study and in contrast to previous analyses (Couvreur et al. 2008a, b; Guo et al. 2017a), they found a strong phylogenetic affinity of Sanrafaelia to another tribe of Annonaceae, namely Uvarieae (Couvreur et al. 2019). This suggested that, based on a poor taxon sampling, the OphrypetalumâSanrafaelia clade might not be part of Monodoreae.\n\nSpecies level relationships within Monodoreae have only been inferred, based on few chloroplast markers, in Isolona, Monodora and more recently in Mischogyne (Couvreur 2009; Gosline et al. 2019) providing support to species and generic delimitation within the tribe. Moreover, the placement of Lukea within Monodoreae and the relationships in the species-rich Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis genera have never been assessed with a near-complete taxon sampling.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to generate a robust species-level phylogenomic tree of the Monodoreae and test the limits between the genera and species. Given that the species rich genera Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis have never been fully assessed phylogenetically and taxonomically, we give a particular focus to these two genera and present a taxonomic revision of these two genera. We discuss species delimitation based on both molecular and morphological evidence.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nTaxonomic revision\n\nWe examined the morphological characters of the Monodoreae species based on the protologues of the species and on the taxonomic revisions of those genera that were available (Diels 1936; Keay 1953; Verdcourt 1960, 1996; Vollesen 1980; Couvreur 2009, 2014; Botermans et al. 2011; Gosline et al. 2019; Cheek et al. 2022). In addition, we examined numerous specimens of Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis, as well as several specimens of Monocyclanthus. The specimens came from B, BM, DSM, EA, G, K, M, MO, MPU, P, WAG and YA herbaria (herbaria acronyms follow Thiers 2016). The high quality scans of some additional specimens or sheets from A, BR, BRLU, COI, E, FHO, GOET, HBG, L, LE, MA, MHU, S, US, WU and Z were also examined, as well as pictures taken in the field or personal fieldwork observations. For the type specimens, an exclamation mark (!) is appended stating either the specimen itself or a high quality scan was seen. Additional duplicates from herbaria not listed above might appear in the lists of specimens, but these were not seen and are cited for information. The format for the list of specimens follow recommendations from BÃ©nichou et al. (2018) and includes a bullet point (â¢) at the beginning of each specimen to visually ease the reading.\n\nWhen a holotype was composed of several sheets from a same gathering within a herbarium, we designated a single sheet as holotype (identified by its barcode) with the mention âsheet here designatedâ. The other sheets were listed as isotypes. This was done for all names except when the protologue explicitely specified that the holotype is composed of several sheets from a same gathering within a herbarium (e.g. Uvariodendronfuscumvar.magnificum),\n\nMeasurements, colors and other details given in the descriptions are based on living material, spirit and herbarium specimens, and data derived from field notes. Morphological descriptions followed terminologies from Hickey et al. (1999) and the Systematics Association Committee for Descriptive Biological Terminology (1962) for leaf and plane shapes, Payne (1978) for the indumentum, and Harris and Harris (2001) for the other terms. To characterise the seeds, we used the term âsemicircularâ to describe the three dimensional shape of a semicircle, like a D-shaped ellipsoid (see e.g. Fig. ). We used custom scripts inspired by the exsic (Simon and Spooner 2013) and monographR (Reginato 2016) packages in R 4.1.3 (R Core Team 2022) to automatically generate initial species descriptions and specimensâ citations.\n\nFor this work, we applied a combination of the phylogenetic and morphological species concept. Thus, a species is recognized if it has support for monophyly and if it exhibits morphological characters that can differentiate it from the others. We also recognized varieties (or sunk previously described species into varieties) when a difference of morphology could be identified, but no monophyly was recovered by the phylogenetic analyses. In some cases, we recognized varieties even if they present an overlap in some of the morphological characters used to differentiate them. This is to recognize the existence of different morphological groups (or âarchetypesâ) in the morphological variation of the species. This reflects the uncertainty around the species, given the material available. The collection of additional material will certainly provide a better understanding of these morphologically complex groups.\n\nTo avoid ambiguities, when necessary, the names Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis were abbreviated to Ud. and Up., respectively.\n\nIUCN assessments were retrieved from https://www.iucnredlist.org/ (accessed 21 September 2022). For species not present in the Red List, we made a preliminary conservation status assessment. We calculated the extent of occurrence (EOO) and the area of occupancy (AOO) using the ConR package (Dauby et al. 2017) and followed IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria Version 3.1 (IUCN 2012) to assign a preliminary conservation status. For the distribution of the species, we specify the country(ies) in which they are distributed, as well as their chorological classification. The chorological part follows White (1979, 1983, 1993) but simplifies the chorological categories (âregional (sub)centre of endemismâ and other) into Region and Domain.\n\nPhylogenomics\n\nTaxon sampling\n\nWe sampled at least one specimen for every species of the Monodoreae tribe, several specimens from the Uvarieae tribe representing different genera, as well as several other Annonaceae outgroups (Chatrou et al. 2012; Suppl. material 3). Within Monodoreae, we sampled, when possible, more than one specimen per species following these cases: one specimen per subspecies or variety; one specimen per major geographic region for widespread species (between East Africa, West Africa, Central Africa); several specimens for morphologically variable species representing that variability (Suppl. material 3).\n\nFor all specimens, DNA was extracted from either silicagel dried leaf samples or leaf material taken from herbarium specimens. Details about specimens and vouchers are available in Suppl. material 3.\n\nFor the downstream analyses, every sample was assigned a unique identifier as follow: RUN_##_I##_T##_Genus_species-COL_NUM. âRUN_##_I##_T##â is the identifier used for the sequencing process and bioinformatics analyses. âGenus_speciesâ is the most up to date taxonomic identification of the specimen (i.e. after applying the taxonomic changes treated in this paper). To ease the reading of updated names, some of the specimens have their old identification in parentheses like âGenus_species_(ex_old name)â. âCOL_NUMâ is the three first letters of the name of the collector and the number of collection of the specimen (e.g. âVAL_2540â stands for the specimen nÂ°2540 collected by J.L.C.H van Valkenburg). The details about every sample can be found in the Suppl. material 3.\n\nDNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing\n\nDNA extraction and NGS library preparations for nuclear exon capture followed Couvreur et al. (2019). Libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 plateform using paired-end sequencing of length 150 bp by Novogene Co. Ltd.\n\nRaw sequence bioinformatics\n\nRaw read sequences were demultiplexed using the demultadapt script (https://github.com/Maillol/demultadapt). Adapters were removed from the reads using cutadapt 1.18 (Martin 2011) with the â-bâ option and the â-O 7 -m 35 -q 20 -e 0.1â parameters. Low quality reads were then excluded (mean quality phred score below 30 and read less than 35 bp long) using a script modified from https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/arcad-hts/blob/master/scripts/arcad_hts_2_Filter_Fastq_On_Mean_Quality.pl. Reverse and forward reads were paired according to their names in the fastq files using a custom script (https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/arcad-hts/blob/master/scripts/arcad_hts_3_synchronized_paired_fastq.pl). A final step of 6 bp trimming was performed on the reverse reads using FASTX-Toolkit (https://github.com/agordon/fastx_toolkit).\n\nContig assembly and alignment\n\nTo process the clean reads, we used the HybPiper v1.3.1 pipeline (Johnson et al. 2016) following Couvreur et al. (2019). This pipeline mapped the reads on to the targeted nuclear exons using BWA v0.7.12 (Li and Durbin 2009). The mapped reads were assembled into contigs using SPAdes v3.11.1 (Bankevich et al. 2012). Overlapping contigs were then assembled into âsupercontigsâ containing both targeted sequence (i.e. exon) and off-target sequence data (i.e. partial intron). The pipeline ends up with one file per gene (supercontig) containing the sequence for every individual. The sequences were then aligned for each gene using MAFFT v7.305 (Katoh and Standley 2013) using the automatic selection of the alignment algorithm (--auto). Alignments were trimmed with Gblocks 0.91b (Talavera and Castresana 2007), to remove poorly aligned regions.\n\nPhylogenetic reconstruction\n\nWe used two different approaches for the phylogenetic reconstruction: the concatenation approach and the gene tree approach. For each approach, we first removed the supercontigs that were putatively identified as paralogs within the HybPiper pipeline, and then filtered our dataset to select only the supercontigs that are present in 75% of the individuals and for which the sequence contains at least 75% of the length of the target sequence (75/75 filter, following Couvreur et al. 2019).\n\nConcatenation approach\n\nFor each supercontig, the alignments were filled with gaps and missing individuals so that every sequence in the alignment has the same length and every alignment contains all the individuals. The alignments were then concatenated into a single âsupermatrixâ using the pxcat function in the phyx program (Brown et al. 2017). A phylogenetic tree was inferred from the supermatrix using an optimized maximum likelihood (ML) tree search implemented in RAxML 8.2.9 with the GTRGAMMA model after a rapid bootstrap analysis (Stamatakis 2014). We specified Anaxagoreacrassipetala as an outgroup (â-oâ option) and constrained the ML search on a backbone topology (â-gâ option), in order to avoid long-branch attraction due to the scarce sampling of the outgroups. The backbone topology only includes the outgroup species and follows the results of Couvreur et al. (2019): (Anaxagorea_crassipetala-MAA_9408, (((((Uvariodendron_kirkii-DAG_09, Uvaria_grandiflora-COU_838), Annona_glabra-CHA_467), Duguetia_staudtii-COU_1014), Guatteria_jefensis-MAA_9553), Greenwayodendron_suaveolens-COU_746)).\n\nGene trees approach\n\nWe inferred a phylogenetic tree for every supercontig using RAxML 8.2.9 (Stamatakis 2014) under the GTRGAMMA model and 100 bootstrap replicates. For every tree obtained, we removed the branches with a bootstrap support less than 10% using the Newick Utilities program (https://github.com/tjunier/newick_utils), in order to improve the accuracy of the inferred species tree (Zhang et al. 2018). We then inferred the summary species tree from all the (unrooted) genes trees using ASTRAL-III 5.7.5 under the multi-species coalescent model (Zhang et al. 2018, 2018). The support at the branches was estimated both with the quartet support (QS) values (â-t 1â option) and with the local posterior probabilities (LPP) (default parameters). The species tree was then rooted on Anaxagoreacrassipetala (Anaxagorea_crassipetala-MAA_9408). The phylogenetic trees obtained were then plotted and annotated using the ggtree, ggplot and treeio packages (Wickham 2016; Yu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2020).\n\nResults\n\nSpecimens examined\n\nIn total, we examined ca. 1,500 herbarium sheets, representing 928 herbarium specimens, including 486 of Uvariodendron, 405 of Uvariopsis, 35 of Dennettia, seven of Monocyclanthus and two of Lukea (Suppl. material 4, https://doi.org/10.15468/zdvvkh). We compiled the morphological characters of the Monodoreae genera in the Table .\n\nTable 1.\n\nNumber of accepted speciesLeaf lengthTertiary veinationSepalsPetalsReceptacle H:wFlower sexualityCarpels Asteranthe 240â165 (180) mmreticulate3, free to shortly connate at base2 whorls of 3, fused at base, inner and outer petals subequalca. 1bisexual free Dennettia 1 < 150 mm long reticulate 3, fused at base, forming a persistent ring with the 3 lobes generally clearly distinct, curved downward on the fruiting pedicel 1 whorl of 3, free < 1 bisexualfree Hexalobus 536â360 mm longreticulate3, free to shortly connate at base 1 whorl of 6, fused at base, folded in bud ca. 1bisexual free Isolona 20 50â280 mm long between reticulate and percurrent 3, free, valvate 1 whorl of 6, fused at base < 1 bisexualfused (true syncarpy) Lukea 268â210 mm longprominent reticulate3, fused, forming a bowl-shaped receptacle, persistent on the fruiting pedicel1 whorl of 3, free> 1bisexual free Mischogyne 5 70â320 mm long prominent reticulate 3, free, reduplicate-valvate in bud 2 whorls of 3, free > 1 bisexualfree, connivent at base and separated and slightly curved outwards at apex Monocyclanthus 1> 150 mm longreticulate3, fused at base, forming a ring with the lobes generally unconspicious, persistent on the fruiting pedicel1 whorl of 6, free> 1bisexual free Monodora 14 40â500 mm long reticulate or more rarely percurrent 3, free, valavate 2 whorls of 3, fused at base, outer petals longer than inner petals <1 to 1 bisexualfused (true syncarpy) Uvariastrum 560â220 mm longreticulate3, free, reduplicate-valvate in bud, enclosing the petals in bud2 whorls of 3, freeca. 1bisexual free, connivent all along their length Uvariodendron 18 65â750 mm long reticulate 3, connivent to fused at base 2 whorls of 3, free, inner and outer subequal in length, inner petals connivent at apex ca. 1 bisexualfree Uvariopsis 1770â615 mm longreticulate2, free to fused at base1 whorl of 4 (1 whorl of 3 in Uvariopsiscongolana), free to fused1â1.2unisexual (except for Uvariopsisbisexualis)free\n\nPhylogenomics\n\nA total of 464 exon regions were recovered out of the 469 contained by the Annonaceae baiting kit (Couvreur et al. 2019). Of these, 39 exon regions were identified as potential paralogs using HybPiper. After discarding the potential paralogs and applying the 75/75 filter (see Methods), the dataset comprised 334 supercontigs. This subset was used for the downstream phylogenetic analyses with both the concatenation (after concatenation to a supermatrix) and gene trees approaches. After alignment, the supercontigs ranged in length between 131 and 9422 distinct sites (mean: 1,234; median: 844). After concatenation of the 334 supercontigs, the supermatrix totaled 449,445 distinct sites.\n\nPhylogenetic relationships\n\nAt the genus level and above, we recovered the same topology with both the gene tree (ASTRAL) and the concatenation (RAxML) approaches (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2) with high levels of statistical support. The local posterior probabilities (LPP) were all above 0.9, the quartet supports (QS) were generally high, and the bootstrap (BS) values were all 100%. The Ophrypetalum â Sanrafaelia clade is retrieved as sister to the Uvarieae with maximum BS and LPP support but with relatively low QS (44%) (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). All the genera were retrieved as monophyletic, except Uvariopsis for which the species Uvariopsistripetala clustered as sister to Monocyclanthus (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). The two species of the newly described genus Lukea clustered together, as sister to Mischogyne with strong support. The branch leading to the crown node of Mischogyne was relatively long (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2).\n\nSpecies monophyly within the genera Asteranthe, Hexalobus, Lukea, Mischogyne, and Monocyclanthus received strong support, and the relationships between species were generally strong (BS > 90%, LPP > 0.9) and similar between both phylogenetic approaches (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). In Hexalobus, the three specimens of Hexalobusmonopetalus sampled from different countries (from Senegal, Mozambique and Angola) clustered together (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1â3) despite the species being widespread.\n\nIn Isolona, Monodora, Uvariastrum, Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis, there are incongruences in topologies between the RAxML and the ASTRAL trees, and the node support is generally strong (BS > 90%, LPP > 0.9), but some nodes are weakly (BS < 70%, LPP < 0.7) to moderately supported (70% < BS < 90%, 0.7 < LPP < 0.9) (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2).\n\nIn Uvariastrum, U.pierreanum and U.insculptum are strongly supported as monophyletic, but U.zenkeri is recovered as paraphyletic. The species U.germainii is retrieved as sister to U.pierreanum with moderate to strong support in both approaches. U.insculptum is retrieved as sister to all the other species in the genus (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2).\n\nIn Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis, most species were recovered as monophyletic (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), but in some cases we appear to have a species complex, that is either a cluster of closely related individuals from more than one species, or separate clusters of individuals from a single species (Sigovini et al. 2016). In Uvariodendron, the specimens identified as Ud.giganteum (Couvreur 1057 and Couvreur 1206) and Ud.magnificum (Hamilton 676) are nested in a clade with the specimens identified as Ud.fuscum, and the branches subtending Ud.fuscum specimens are generally weakly supported in both RAxML and ASTRAL trees (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). The specimens previously identified as Ud.molundense clustered together, but formed three genetically distinct and strongly supported groups: one including the single specimen Sosef 2219, previously identified as Ud.molundensevar.citrata, sister to the other two groups, another one composed of specimens Sosef 2261 and Valkenburg 2540, and a final group composed of the remaining sampled specimens. The three groups are separated by relatively long branches, especially the group formed by the specimens Sosef 2261 and Valkenburg 2540 (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2).\n\nIn Uvariopsis, the crown node of the clade formed by Up.bakeriana, Up.citrata, Up.korupensis, Up.submontana (Â« large leaves Â» group on Fig. ) is strongly supported, but forms a species complex: while Up.bakeriana is retrieved as monophyletic with strong support (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), Up.korupensis is retrieved as paraphyletic in both phylogenetic approaches (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), while Up.citrata is retrieved as monophyletic with moderate support in the gene tree approach only (QS < 50%, LPP < 0.7).\n\nDiscussion\n\nPhylogenomics of the Monodoreae tribe\n\nWe provide here (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2) the first complete species level phylogenomic reconstruction of the Monodoreae tribe based on 334 nuclear loci using a targeted sequencing approach (Couvreur et al. 2019). Indeed, we sequenced all of the 90 currently accepted species, and included the specimens of three potentially new species. Such a level of species sampling with hundreds of nuclear markers has never being achieved for a diverse tribe of Annonaceae to date. Couvreur et al. (2019) published a species level phylogenomic study using the Annonaceae baiting kit of tribe Piptostigmateae, but this study included 74% of know species in the tribe (BrÃ©e et al. 2020). In addition, we were also able to sample several specimens within species to test species limits and concepts. Our high level of inter- and intra-specific sampling for Monodoreae was possible thanks to the successful sequencing of DNA extracted from herbarium specimens. Indeed, 49% (101/207) of specimens sequenced in this study were sampled from herbarium specimens, versus 51% (106/207) available from different silicagel DNA banks. Four specimens included here were more than 110 years old dating back to 1898, 1900, 1910 and 1911. Our results underline once again the central importance of herbarium specimens for phylogenetic inference (Bebber et al. 2010; Bakker 2019; Brewer et al. 2019) of tropical plants, in particular to achieve high levels of taxon sampling needed to test species limits but also infer more accurate macroevolutionary patterns.\n\nGeneric level relationships within Monodoreae generally agree with molecular phylogenies based on few plastid markers (Couvreur et al. 2008a; Chatrou et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2017a). There are however, two major differences when compared to plastid data: the position of the two east African genera Ophrypetalum and Sanrafaelia not being sister to the rest of Monodoreae, and the position of the species Uvariopsistripetala. These differences and taxonomic implications are discussed in detail below.\n\nEven though sequencing of hundreds of markers combined with a dense taxon sampling appear as a silver bullet to understand species limits, it doesnât always provide clear cut answers. Indeed, phylogenetic conflicts are common in plant systematics: incongruences can occur between concatenation and gene tree approaches (Shen et al. 2021), or reconstructions based on nuclear loci versus chloroplast loci (MoralesâBriones et al. 2018). Such incongruences are often attributed to reticulate processes of evolution occurring at the population level, like horizontal gene transfer, hybridizations or incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) (Maddison 1997; Naciri and Linder 2015; MoralesâBriones et al. 2018; Schrempf and SzÃ¶llÅsi 2020). Phylogenetic conflict, associated with little divergence between species, is also known to coincide with rapidly evolving taxa in case of adaptive radiations (Meyer et al. 2017) and morphological innovations (Parins-Fukuchi et al. 2021). Widespread species can also be retrieved as non-monophyletic, with diverging range-restricted species embedded within them. This is due to the retention of ancestral polymorphisms in widespread species where both the population size and the generation time are too high to achieve complete lineage sorting from the divergence time until the present day (Pennington and Lavin 2016). This has been documented in Amazonia where tree species restricted to seasonally drought-affected forests are retrieved embedded in rain forests tree species (Pennington and Lavin 2016). These processes at the population level might be the cause of the observed phylogenetic conflicts in Isolona, Monodora, Uvariastrum, Uvariodendron, and Uvariopsis, and likely explain the species complex in the later two genera. Nevertheless, our study provides a solid phylogenetic framework to test different relationships within this tribe, confirming some and disagreeing with previous results. Below we discuss our results from a taxonomy point of view.\n\nRe-circumscription of the tribe\n\nThe two monotypic sister genera from East Africa, Ophrypetalum Diels (Kenya and Tanzania) and Sanrafaelia Verdc. (Tanzania) (Diels 1936; Verdcourt 1960, 1996), called the OphrypetalumâSanrafaelia clade here, were informally linked to some genera (i.e. the Hexalobus group, Asteranthe, Hexalobus, Isolona, Monodora) now placed in Monodoreae based on floral morphology (van Heusden 1992). Phylogenetic studies at the genus level and based on few chloroplast markers recovered these two genera as sister to all the other Monodoreae genera with moderate to strong support (Couvreur et al. 2008b; Chatrou et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2017a; Xue et al. 2020). Here, with more than 300 nuclear loci and a much denser species level sampling, we retrieved both genera as sister to the Uvarieae tribe, with strong support (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). Our analyses thus confirm the result of Couvreur et al. (2019) using the same baiting kit, but only sampling Sanrafaelia and fewer species within Monodoreae. The discrepancy between the relationships inferred in the previous studies and here can be attributed to the higher number of loci and species sequenced, but also to the use of nuclear vs. chloroplast loci.\n\nThe OphrypetalumâSanrafaelia clade share several morphological characters also found in other Monodoreae genera (Fig. ), in addition to occurring in tropical Africa, such as being trees with simple indumentum, monocarps (individual fruiting units) that are sessile or shortly stipitate (stipes shorter than 10 mm) or pollen units forming tetrads (except for Isolona (monads)) (Couvreur et al. 2008b). The morphological link to tribe Uvarieae based on morphological grounds is harder to make. Uvarieae is mainly composed of genera having a lianescent habit, except for Cleistochlamys (East Africa) and Dasymaschalon (South East Asia) which are trees or shrubs (Verdcourt 1971a; Wang et al. 2009, 2012). In addition, most species have an indumentum of stellate hairs (more rarely simple in some Uvaria species) and fruits with generally stipitate monocarps and pollen in monads (Couvreur et al. 2008b; Chatrou et al. 2012; Doyle and Le Thomas 2012). Likely most of these characters are novelties for the Uvarieae, while both the Monodoreae and the OphrypetalumâSanrafaelia clade show the plesiomorph condition. This precludes Ophrypetalum and Sanrafaelia as being part of Uvarieae based on morphology alone. This distinction from the tribe Uvarieae is also supported genetically by the long branches sustaining the OphrypetalumâSanrafaelia clade from the crown node of Uvarieae (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). We thus propose the erection of the new tribe Ophrypetaleae to accommodate these two genera. The description of the new tribe is provided in the Taxonomic treatment section below. Interestingly, both genera are quite different in terms of flower morphology (Verdcourt 1971a, 1996). Ophrypetalum has two whorls of three free petals, with the inner ones clawed and presenting a small brush-like appendage on the inner side and has numerous carpels (10â15) (Fig. ). In contrast, Sanrafaelia has six petals united into a single whorl and has a single carpel (Fig. ). These differences between sister genera underline once again the great morphological diversity of African genera probably linked to differences in pollination vectors (Gottsberger et al. 2011).\n\nAfter our study presented here, the tribe Monodoreae is composed of 11 genera and 90 species, and the main morphological characters are provide in Table .\n\nAsteranthe\n\nAsteranthe is an East African genus characterised by large fleshy flowers with basally fused petals and numerous free carpels (Verdcourt 1971a). Asteranthe was strongly supported as monophyletic (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), and recovered as sister to the mainly central African genera Hexalobus and Uvariastrum confirming previous analyses (Couvreur et al. 2008a). The name Asteranthetrollii Diels (Diels 1936) was synonymized by Verdcourt with Asterantheasterias (S. Moore) Engl. & Diels (Verdcourt 1971a). Verdcourt argued that the type species of A.trollii was very similar to A.asterias (Verdcourt 1971a, b). Here, we sequenced the specimen Luke 7641, originally identified as A.trollii, which clustered with the other sampled specimens of A.asterias (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). Thus, even though we did not sequence the type specimen, our results support the synonymy proposed by Verdcourt (1971a, b).\n\nIn addition, Verdcourt (1971a) described the subspecies Asterantheasteriassubsp.triangularis based on the petals being narrowly triangular (vs. linear-oblong to linear in Asterantheasteriassubsp.asterias). In our analysis, both subspecies are genetically separated but sister groups (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), supporting Verdcourtâs proposal. However, sampling more specimens of A.asteriassubsp.triangularis would be necessary to decide whether the subspecies should be erected to the species level.\n\nHexalobus\n\nThe genus Hexalobus contains five accepted species (Botermans et al. 2011). This genus is characterized by basally fused petals which are longitudinally folded (wrinkled) in bud, a character unique within the family (van Heusden 1992; Botermans et al. 2011). The species H.monopetalus has a very widespread âringâ type distribution, from Senegal to the north of South Africa (and parts of Angola). It occurs in drier woodland savannah or gallery forests (Botermans et al. 2011). This is unique among the Monodoreae species, which generally have ecological affinities with wetter areas and have a more restricted geographical distribution. Our geographically widespread sampling of H.monopetalus (three specimens from Angola, Mozambique and Senegal) was recovered as monophyletic with strong support (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), confirming that despite its widespread distribution, it is a single species. In addition, H.monopetalus is inferred as sister to the other dry adapted species of the genus H.mosambicensis (Botermans et al. 2011).\n\nThe widespread central African species H.crispiflorus is recovered as sister to the more narrowly distributed H.salicifolius (Cameroon and Gabon) with maximum support in both analyses (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). This confirms they are closely related as suggested by Le Thomas (1969). They do however differ by several morphological characters such as smaller leaves and smoother monocarps in H.salicifolius. Monophyly, however, needs to be confirmed by a denser sampling within each species.\n\nUvariastrum\n\nUvariastrum is a genus containing five accepted species characterized by reduplicate-valvate (i.e. curved outwards) sepals margins (Couvreur 2014). Morphologically, the five species are clearly differentiated based on several characters such as the indumentum and leaf morphology. Our results, however, underline some level of phylogenetic conflict (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). The geographical distributions of all the species overlap, at least partially, in central Africa, except for U.hexaloboides that is distributed in Zambia and in Katanga region (south Democratic Republic of the Congo) (Couvreur 2014). The lack of support for the nodes subtending U.zenkeri and U.germainii could be caused by old or occasional hybridization between the species but the inter-fertility has never been accounted for for any of the Uvariastrum species. Another explanation is that they diverged too recently to exhibit much differentiation at the molecular level (Erkens et al. 2012).\n\nThe case of the newly described genus Lukea\n\nRecently, the genus Lukea Cheek & Gosline was described, endemic to East Africa with two species: Lukeaquentinii Cheek & Gosline and Lukeatriciae Cheek & Gosline (Cheek et al. 2022). Morphologically, Lukea resembles Mischogyne by the finely reticulate tertiary venation of the leaves and the absence of connective shield on the stamens (Gosline et al. 2019). Lukea presents a bowl-shape calyx persisting in fruit, a character unique within the Monodoreae tribe, although resembling the fused sepals found in Monocyclanthus (Cheek et al. 2022) and in Uvariodendronschmidtii W.R.Q. Luke, Dagallier & Couvreur (Dagallier et al. 2021). Our results recovered Lukeaquentinii as sister to Lukeatriciae, and the whole genus Lukea as sister to Mischogyne, with great genetic divergence (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). This supports the genus level status of Lukea, and its inclusion in Monodoreae as suggested previously (Cheek et al. 2022).\n\nMischogyne\n\nMischogyne is a genus of five accepted species characterized by the combination of different morphological features such as prominent reticulate tertiary veins and carpels touching each other at their base but separated at their apex (Gosline et al. 2019). The clade formed by M.congensis and M.micheloides is consistent in both our analyses (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2) and with previous phylogenetic work on the genus based on a few plastid locus (Gosline et al. 2019). The position of the East African species M.idii remains however uncertain, either retrieved as sister to the clade M.congensisâM.micheloides (Gosline et al. 2019), sister to M.gabonensis (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1) or to M.elliotana (Suppl. materials 2).\n\nUvariopsis\n\nUvariopsis Engl. is one of the most diverse genera of the Monodoreae tribe with 17 currently accepted species and until recently, several species were unknown to science (Couvreur and Luke 2010; Couvreur and Niangadouma 2016). Morphologically, Uvariopsis is characterised by monoecious individuals (separate male and female flowers on a single individual) and by exhibiting a type of flower uncommon in Annonaceae, composed of two sepals and four petals (Robyns and GhesquiÃ¨re 1933a). Uvariopsiscongolana (De Wild.) Fries however has two sepals and three petals (De Wildeman 1909). Uvariopsiscongolana was previously described under a different genus name (Thonnera De Wild.), but was later combined into Uvariopsis (Fries 1953). Both our molecular phylogenetic analyses retrieved Up.congolana as sister species of Up.dioica with strong support (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), confirming its placement within Uvariopsis. In 1986, Verdcourt described the species Up.bisexualis from Tanzania, having the typical Uvariopsis flower with two sepals and four petals (and other typical pollen microscopic characters, see Verdcourt (1986)), but with bisexual flowers, thus extending the concept of the genus as also having bisexual flowers (Verdcourt 1986).\n\nDennettia, Monocyclanthus and flower variations in Uvariopsis\n\nIn 1913, Baker described the monotypic genus Dennettia Baker f., with a single species Dennettiatripetala Baker f. having bisexual flowers with â2 rarely 3 sepalsâ and three petals in a single whorl (Baker 1913). In 2003, Kenfack et al. combined the genus Dennettia into the genus Uvariopsis under the name Uvariopsistripetala (Baker f.) G.E. Schatz, based on four main arguments (Kenfack et al. 2003). First, the morphological circumscription of Uvariopsis had been extended to also include bisexual flowers by Verdcourt (1986, Up.bisexualis); second, Kenfack et al. (2003), observed specimens of D.tripetala exhibiting flowers with 2 sepals and 4 petals, thus reminding of the typical Uvariopsis flower; third, Kenfack et al. (2003) considered that because Up.congolana has 3 petals, the number of perianth segments is unreliable as a generic distinction for Uvariopsis; and fourth, the pollen microscopic features of D.tripetala are very close to those of Uvariopsis (Kenfack et al. 2003; Doyle et al. 2004). This was initially confirmed based on molecular phylogenetic analyses using few plastid regions, recovering Uvariopsistripetala as nested within Uvariopsis but based on just three species sampled within Uvariopsis (Couvreur et al. 2008a; Chatrou et al. 2012).\n\nAfter careful examination of 16 flowering specimens identified as Uvariopsistripetala (including the type Dennett 44), we found that this species invariably exhibits 3 sepals and 3 petals. The sepals are fused at the base up to more than half of their length, forming a ring curved downward and persisting on the fruiting pedicel. In some rare cases we observed that the lobes of the calyx (i.e. the free parts at the apices of the basally fused sepals) are sometimes almost inconspicuous on the fruiting pedicel, allowing for the confusion with a two sepal-like calyx. To date, and based on the specimens we observed, we havenât seen any flowers of Up.tripetala with four petals, contrary to the affirmation of Kenfack et al. (2003). If such flower arrangements exist, they must be extremely rare. It is also possible that the four petal flowers observed by Kenfack et al. (2003) were actually flower buds of the new species, Uvariopsisoligocarpa Dagallier & Couvreur (see the Taxonomic Treatment section), as their geographic ranges overlap and leaves are quite similar (but Up.oligocarpa is unisexual). In contrast to the previous phylogenetic analyses, we did not recover Dennettia (Uvariopsis) tripetala as nested within Uvariopsis, but as sister to the monotypic West African genus Monocyclanthusvignei Keay, with strong support in both phylogenetic approaches (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). Dennettia (Uvariopsis) tripetala differs from Monocyclanthusvignei (Keay 1953) by having three petals in one whorl (vs. six petals in one whorl), the lobes of the fused sepals generally distinct (vs. generally inconspicuous), and a receptacle height:width ratio less than 1, i.e. wider than tall (vs. a receptacle height:width ratio greater than 1, i.e. taller than wide) (see Table ). The single whorl of six petals of Monocyclanthus supposedly results from the compression of separate ancestral whorls (Saunders 2010). For Dennettia, the single whorl of three petals might result from a similar compression of separate ancestral whorls followed by a loss of petals, or from the loss of a whorl of petals.\n\nAll these morphological and phylogenetic elements suggest that Dennettia (Uvariopsis) tripetala is part of neither the genus Uvariopsis nor the genus Monocyclanthus. We thus reinstate the monotypic genus Dennettia, with its single species Dennettiatripetala Baker f. (see Taxonomic treatment). This was also suggested previously by Cheek et al. (2022) based on morphology.\n\nGiven the above, the morphological circumscription of Uvariopsis must be reevaluated. Uvariopsis was generally circumscribed as having 2 sepals and 4 petals (Kenfack et al. 2003). However, Uvariopsiscongolana differs from all other Uvariopsis species by having flowers with 3 petals instead of 4. Uvariopsiscongolana was successfully sequenced and nested within Uvariopsis with strong support (sister to Up.dioica, Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). Thus, the number of petals (4 versus 3) is not a good diagnostic character for Uvariopsis. However, Up.congolana has 2 sepals, similarly to all the other Uvariopsis species, making this character a good synapomorphy for the genus. The synoptic characters of the genus Uvariopsis Engl. are given in the Taxonomic Treatment section below.\n\nThe âlarge leavesâ group\n\nBased on our dense taxon sampling, we identified a group of closely related species for which the phylogenetic limits remain uncertain. Indeed, the four species Up.bakeriana, Up.citrata, Up.korupensis and Up.submontana clustered as monophyletic with strong support (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), but support for the monophyly of each individual species and the relationships between them remains ambiguous (Fig. , Suppl. material 2) with some gene tree conflict (Suppl. material 1). They share some morphological characters in particular the large size and shape of their leaves, hence referred to as the âlarge leavesâ group here. They are all trees with large obovate leaves (up to 30â60 cm long) having rounded to cordate bases, and display flowers borne along the trunk with varying degrees on density, from densely packed in Up.submontana to sparsely distributed in Up.citrata (Kenfack et al. 2003; Couvreur and Niangadouma 2016). In addition, flowering pedicels are shorter than 7 cm and petals generally 3 to 10 times longer than wide. Despite these similarities, they differ by several marked characters. Uvariopsisbakeriana is characterized by its unique petals that are narrowly ovate to linear and bright pinkish to deep red in color (Hutchinson and Dalziel 1927b). Uvariopsiscitrata is characterized by its leaves emitting a strong lemon scent when crushed and sessile flowers (Couvreur and Niangadouma 2016). Uvariopsiskorupensis and Up.submontana have similar flowers with pedicels generally 20â70 mm long, ovate to narrowly ovate shortly fused at base, but are differentiated by their ecology (Up.korupensis occurs below 200 m, Up.submontana above 900 m), the degree of flowers density on the trunk (less densely clustered in Up.korupensis) and the sepals being smaller in Up.korupensis (1â5(7.5) mm long) than in Up.submontana (5â11 mm long) (Gereau and Kenfack 2000; Kenfack et al. 2003).\n\nBased solely on the phylogeny, this group could be considered as a single species. However, given the morphological differences of each species detailed above we choose to keep the taxonomy of this group as it is. Phylogenetic conflict is known to be coincident with morphological innovations (Parins-Fukuchi et al. 2021), as observed in recent and fast diverging groups (Meyer et al. 2017). Here we retrieve such a pattern, with substantial morphological differentiation between Up.citrata, Up.bakeriana and Up.korupensis, but a lack of support at subtending nodes. Uvariopsiskorupensis is retrieved as paraphyletic and the two specimens sampled here (Couvreur 1039 and Louis 1863) come from different localities. They might belong to different isolated relictual populations failing to coalesce due to the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms (Pennington and Lavin 2016). The species Up.bakeriana and Up.citrata likely emerged from two populations that diverged from the ancestral Up.korupensis population. This remains to be clarified with a denser sampling (in particular of Up.submontana) or with a phylogeographic and adapted population genomics approaches (Hardy et al. 2013; Migliore et al. 2019; Helmstetter et al. 2020a).\n\nNew and under collected species\n\nIn addition to the results discussed above, our sampling and analysis confirmed the presence of new and/or under-collected species, which we detail here. Thanks to our dense sampling in the genus Uvariopsis, we were also able to test species limits, and concluded that several names are actually synonyms, which we detail under each concerned species in the Taxonomic treatment section below.\n\nMorphologically, Uvariopsissessiliflora stands out from the other Uvariopsis species by having sessile flowers and leaves less than 20 cm long (Up.citrata also has sessile flowers but leaves more than 30 cm long). The only known specimen representing this species is its type specimen (Mildbraed 5239), collected in 1911 in LomiÃ©, a relatively well collected locality of Cameroon (SonkÃ© and Couvreur 2014). This specimen is relatively poor in information as it has only has a small branch, one flower and one monocarp. Here we were able to sequence this specimen and it turns out that it is phylogenetically embedded within Up.dioica (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), indicating that Up.sessiliflora and Up.dioica are the same phylogenetic species. It seems that the specimen Mildbraed 5239 represents a rare extreme in the morphological variation of Ud.dioica, with severe reduction of the flower pedicel. This also explains why no similar specimen was collected after all this time in a such relatively well explored locality. We thus make it synonym under the name Up.dioica.\n\nThe recently described species Uvariopsisetugeana Dagallier & Couvreur (Couvreur et al. 2022), is a rare tree species only known from two localities in Cameroon. Our results confirm it is phylogenetically different from other Uvariopsis species (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2).\n\nUvariopsisnoldeae Exell & MendonÃ§a is a species endemic to Angola (Exell and MendonÃ§a 1951; Paiva 1966) and only known from the type specimen (Nolde 576). It is morphologically similar to Uvariopsissolheidii (De Wild.) Robyns & Ghesq., except for the young branches that are sparsely pubescent to glabrous whereas young branches of Up.solheidii are tomentose to shortly tomentose suggesting the names might be synonymous. Our phylogenetic analyses, however, revealed with strong support that Up.noldeae is genetically different from Up.solheidii, being sister to Up.dioica and Up.congolana, with Up.solheidii forming a strongly supported monophyletic group (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2).\n\nUvariopsiscongensis differs from the other Uvariopsis species by its relatively small to medium sized leaves (less than 180 mm long), globose flower buds (vs. conical), and short flowering pedicels (less than 12 mm long). It is a widespread species distributed from Central Africa (Cameroon, Gabon) to East Africa (Uganda, Kenya) (Robyns and GhesquiÃ¨re 1933a; Verdcourt 1971a). Interestingly, some of the specimens we identified as Up.congensis were from West Africa, (Sierra Leone to Ghana), thus outside of its suggested range. A thorough examination of these West African specimens revealed they differed by the morphology of their fruits. Moreover, our molecular phylogenetic analyses retrieved these West African specimens (referred as Uvariopsisoligocarpa on the Fig. and Suppl. materials 1, 2) as monophyletic with strong support, and clearly separated from the Central and East African specimens (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). Sterile specimens of Up.oligocarpa are similar to Up.congensis and Dennettiatripetala, but are easily differentiated when female flowers or fruits are available. We thus describe these specimens under the new species Uvariopsisoligocarpa Dagallier & Couvreur.\n\nFinally, the specimens of Uvariopsiscongensis from East Africa (Verdcourt 1971a) are also morphologically different from the specimens distributed in Central Africa. The East African specimens represent trees from 7 to 15 meters tall (vs. shrubs to trees from 2 to 7 meters tall for the Central African specimens) and they have narrowly elliptic laminas with a length:width ratio between 3 and 4 (vs. elliptic to obovate with a length:width ratio comprised between 2.1 and 3.1). Interestingly, the morphological differences between the two morphotypes are not supported by our phylogenetic analyses (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). Thus given our sampling we shall refrain from splitting Up.congensis in two different species. However, to account for the morphological differences between the two morphotypes, we describe a new variety Uvariopsiscongensisvar.angustifolia Dagallier & Couvreur corresponding to the East African morphotype (see Taxonomic Treatment below).\n\nCollection ATBP 666 (African Tropical Biodiversity Programme, MO04937010) collected from the Budongo Forest Reserve in Uganda (as âUvariopsis sp. nov. Ugandaâ in Fig. and Suppl. materials 1, 2), is a sterile specimen tentatively identified as Up.congensis. Indeed, the leaves of this specimen resemble Up.congensis except for its longer petioles when compared to typical Up.congensis (ca. 6 mm vs. 2.5â5 mm in Up.congensis). Interestingly, our results recovered this specimen as sister to the clade formed by Up.lovettiana and Up.congensis, with strong support (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2) and thus genetically very different from Up.congensis. This specimen could thus be an undescribed species. Unfortunately, the available material is too poor for a proper species description. This species might be rare occurring only in the Budongo Forest Reserve. Plant surveys of this locality are relatively old (Synnott 1985) and it has recently been assessed as a key biodiversity area (Plumptre et al. 2019). Similarly, a specimen collected from Kigoma area in western Tanzania (Kyoto University Expedition (KUE) 1039, EA000009849), and referred to as âUvariopsis sp. nov. Tanzaniaâ (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), appears to be a new taxon. Morphologically, it is close to Up.lovettiana but differs in having lamina with rounded base (vs. acute to decurrent), and subsessile pubescent monocarps (vs. stipitate and glabrous). The sequenced specimen is recovered as sister to either Up.noldeae with strong support (Suppl. material 2) or to the group formed by Up.noldeae, Up.dioica and Up.congolana (Fig. , Suppl. material 1) with weak support. This uncertainty probably comes from the fact that the specimen has low overall sequencing statistics (22% of the total reference covered at at least 10Ã; mean depth 6.1Ã). This would also explain its long sustaining branch. Nevertheless, the specimen passed our quality thresholds and is included. Our results confirm that it is a new species, although its phylogenetic placement remains uncertain. These new species emphasize once again the great diversity of the East African region, with locations (mainly forest remnants) containing numerous endemic species or genera (e.g. Scharff 1992; Couvreur et al. 2009; Gosline et al. 2019; Dagallier et al. 2021).\n\nUvariodendron\n\nMorphologically, the genus Uvariodendron R.E.Fr. represents the typical Annonaceae flower (van Heusden 1992) and does not stand out by any particular character (in contrast to Uvariopsis for example with its 2 sepals and generally 4 petals, see above). Species of this genus can be recognized, however, by the combination of the following characters: the flowers are generally large in size, bisexual, sessile or shortly pedicellate (generally less than 2 cm, but up to 6.5 cm in Ud.anisatum) with numerous bracts, 3 sepals and two whorls of 3 free and sub-equal petals. The flower bud is globose, and in bud, the petals of the outer whorl are valvate all along their margins, whereas the petals of the inner whorl are valvate only at the apex. The stamens are numerous (ca. 200 to 3000) and there are generally many carpels (5 to 160 in number). The monocarps are sessile to shortly stipitate (with stipes up to 12 mm long). Based on our dense species sampling, the genus is retrieved as monophyletic with strong support (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). We discuss below some implications of our results at the taxonomic level.\n\nEast African Uvariodendronâs: an endless source of botanical discoveries\n\nEast Africa is a region that harbours a great plant diversity, with several species being endemic or narrow endemics (Scharff 1992; Burgess et al. 1998, 2007; Couvreur et al. 2009; Gosline et al. 2019; Dagallier et al. 2021; Cheek et al. 2022). This pattern is known to be the result of the topographic heterogeneity of this region (Droissart et al. 2018; Guillocheau et al. 2018) that could promote both recent divergence and persistence of more anciently lineages through time (FjeldsÃ¥ and Lovett 1997; Rahbek et al. 2019; Dagallier et al. 2020).\n\nRecently, we described three new Uvariodendron species from the East African coastal forests based on their morphology: Uvariodendrondzomboense Dagallier, W.R.Q. Luke & Couvreur, Uvariodendronmbagoi Dagallier & Couvreur, and Uvariodendronschmidtii W.R.Q. Luke, Dagallier & Couvreur (Dagallier et al. 2021). Here, our phylogenetic analyses retrieved these species as monophyletic, confirming their species status (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2).\n\nIn addition to these recently described species, our results reveal another undescribed species. It is represented by four specimens sampled here that were previously identified as Uvariodendronkirkii. These specimens all come from a restricted area in the Kimboza Forest Reserve (Morogoro, Tanzania), and this species is thus described as Uvariodendronkimbozaense Dagallier & Couvreur. Phylogenetically, it is sister to Ud.kirkii although clearly divergent at the molecular level (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). Morphologically, it also resembles Ud.kirkii, but differs by having larger flowers and different leaf dimensions (see Fig. , Table and Taxonomic Treatment). Although the Kimboza Forest Reserve covers just 4.05 km2 of lowland rain forest, the description of yet another new tree species underlines once again the major biological importance of this forest for biodiversity conservation (Rodgers et al. 1983). To date, an unpublished check list (see http://www.mikepalmer.co.uk/woodyplantecology/tropical/Kimboza.html) reports that Kimboza harbors 18 strict endemic plant species, including the monotypic Annonaceae genus Mwasumbia (Couvreur et al. 2009) as well as many other trees such as Colakimbozensis Cheek and C.quentinii Cheek (Cheek et al. 2007), Turraeakimbozensis Cheek (Cheek 1989) or Vitexmorogoroensis Walsingham & S.Atkins. (Cheek et al. 2019). This suggests that Kimboza is âprobably the richest site for forest limestone point endemic plant species in tropical Africaâ (Cheek et al. 2007, 2019).\n\nTable 2.\n\nLamina baseMidrib relief aboveFlower budBractsSepalsPetals sizeInner petals shape Uvariodendronkirkii acute to decurrentslightly impressed (Fig. )globose, 1.3â6 mm diameter1 at base of the pedicel and sometimes 1 on the upper half of the pedicel (Fig. )3â6.5 mm long, 4â8 mm wide, very broadly to broadly ovate, connivent (Fig. )10â20 mm long, 6â13 mm widestrongly transversally curved (âboat-shapeâ) (Fig. ) Uvariodendronkimbozaense acute to roundedslightly raised with a central groove all along (Fig. )globose to oblate, 7â16 mm diameter1 at base of the pedicel and from 1 to 4 along the pedicel (Fig. )6â12 mm long, 12â21 mm wide, depressed ovate, imbricate (Fig. )16â39 mm long, 9â19 mm wideslightly transversally curved (Fig. )\n\nIn the Flora Zambesiaca (Robson 1960) a potential new species of Uvariodendron was documented without being named because of the scarcity of the material. It is only known from a single specimen (MendonÃ§a 2558A) collected in 1944 in Mozambique. This specimen was sequenced here and it appears genetically distinct from the other Uvariodendron species, being sister to the group of several other East African species (Ud.gorgonis, Ud.schmidtii, Ud.dzomboense and Ud.pycnophyllum) with strong support (see Uvariodendronmossambicense in Fig. and Suppl. materials 1, 2). Our results thus confirm that this specimen represents a new species. Morphologically, it is very similar to Ud.dzomboense by the short leaves (less than 130 mm long), narrowly elliptic and acute to slightly decurrent laminas, and the globose, ca. 5 mm in diameter and sessile flower buds. It differs by the number of carpels (ca. 5 vs. 50â75 in Ud.dzomboense) (Table ). The description from the Flora Zambesiaca was based on a sheet from LISC. Our examination of this species is based on a sheet from WAG that contains a single monocarp, thus slightly enhancing the initial description of the species (Robson 1960). The monocarp has a short stipe (ca. 12 mm long) which also differentiates it from Ud.dzomboense that has sessile monocarps. Even if the material remains scarce for a complete description, we provide evidence from both phylogeny and morphology that this species is distinct from the other known Uvariodendron species. We thus name this species Uvariodendronmossambicense Robson ex Dagallier & Couvreur and provide a description as complete as possible (see the Taxonomic Treatment section).\n\nTable 3.\n\nLamina shapeLamina sizeFlower budCarpels number Uvariodendrondzomboense elliptic to narrowly elliptic, acute to slightly decurrent at base, attenuate at apex65â132 mm long, 20â45 mm wideglobose, ca. 4.5 mm in diameter, pubescent 50 to 75 Uvariodendronmossambicense elliptic, acute to slightly decurrent at base, attenuate at apex80â135 mm long, 30â50 mm wideglobose, ca. 6.5 mm in diameter, pubescent ca. 5\n\nEast Africa has been relatively well explored botanically, as shown by the completion of the Flora of Tropical East Africa (Beentje 2015) and the publication of several parts of the Flora Zambesiaca (Exell and Wild 1960). However, our descriptions of several new species suggest that other botanical discoveries might arise from further exploration (Cheek et al. 2022). This stresses the importance of local botanical initiatives (e.g. Binggeli 2019; Bingham et al. 2021; Hyde et al. 2021).\n\nThe morphological continuum of Uvariodendronfuscum\n\nIn the Flora of Cameroon (Couvreur et al. 2022), the name Uvariodendronmirabile R.E.Fr. was synonymized under Uvariodendronfuscum (Benth.) R.E.Fr. Here we sequenced both the type (Preuss 1378) and paratype (Lehmbach 178) of the name Ud.mirabile, both specimens clustering with specimens identified as Ud.fuscum (e.g. Mildbraed 6428, a paratype of the name Ud.fuscum) (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), confirming they are conspecific. Note that when described, Ud.occidentale was distinguished from Ud.fuscum (as Ud.mirabile) based on morphology (Le Thomas 1967). This holds up from a phylogenetic point of view as Ud.occidentale is clearly separated from Ud.fuscum (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2).\n\nMorphologically, Ud.fuscum (Benth.) R.E.Fr., Ud.giganteum (Engl.) R.E.Fr. and Ud.magnificum Verdc. share morphological similarities and differences. They mainly diverge along a morphological continuum by the size of their leaves (lamina length) and the size of their flowers (sepals and petals dimensions, number of carpels), with Ud.magnificum having larger leaves and flowers than Ud.giganteum, with the latter having larger leaves and flowers than Ud.fuscum (Fig. , Table ). In addition, Ud.magnificum flowers have apically imbricate inner petals while the other Uvariodendron species have apically connate inner petals (Verdcourt 1969). In terms of similarities, they all present elliptic to obovate leaves. Uvariodendronfuscum and Ud.giganteum have similar sepals (fused over up to half of their length), inner petals (free, obovate) and outer petals (free, ovate). Uvariodendrongiganteum and Ud.magnificum have young branches covered with long and soft hairs producing a whitish appearance quickly falling off with age, whereas the young branches of Ud.fuscum vary from being sparsely pubescent to glabrous. Some of the characters that supposedly discriminate the species are overlapping (e.g. lamina length), particularly concerning Ud.fuscum and Ud.giganteum.\n\nTable 4.\n\nUd.fuscum Young branches indumentumLamina sizeSepals sizePetals sizeCarpels number var. fuscum sparsely pubescent to glabrous 160â450 mm long, 43â118 mm wide11â23 mm long, 13â26 mm wide20â42 mm long, 15â26 mm wide20 to 70 var. giganteumwith long soft hairs producing a whitish appearance quickly falling off357â676 mm long, 84â225 mm wide20â30 mm long, 16â26 mm wide21â40 mm long, 17â30 mm wide50 to 100 var. magnificumwith long soft hairs producing a whitish appearance quickly falling off210â750 mm long, 57â215 (250) mm wide30â55 mm long, 30â43 mm wide50â70 mm long, 36â47 mm wide 150 to 160\n\nPhylogenetically, the specimens of the three species clustered together, with strong support at the crown node and a weak to moderate support at the internal nodes (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2). The phylogenetic branches are short (Fig. , Suppl. material 2) indicating a low divergence between the specimens and both Ud.fuscum and Ud.giganteum are retrieved as paraphyletic. This suggests that gene flow is still occurring between populations. We thus propose that the three described species are actually three different morphotypes of the same species. Uvariodendronfuscum represents the smaller morphotype (small leaves and flowers relatively to the others), Ud.magnificum represents the greater morphotype (large leaves and flowers relatively to the others), and Ud.giganteum represents the intermediate morphotype. The imbrication of inner petals of Ud.magnificum that Verdcourt (1969) described as a synapomorphy for the species should be considered as a developmental constraint imposed by the size of the petals. Indeed, in bud, we can imagine that the only way for such long (50â53 mm long) and wide (36â38 mm wide) petals to arrange with the other floral elements is to overlap.\n\nThe name Ud.giganteum was already reduced into synonymy with Ud.fuscum in the Flora of Cameroon (Couvreur et al. 2022). Here we thus synonymize the name Ud.magnificum with Ud.fuscum. The first mention of Ud.fuscum dates back to 1862, as Uvariafusca (Bentham 1862), whereas the name Ud.magnificum dates back to 1969 (Verdcourt 1969). Given the priority rule (Turland et al. 2018), the name Uvariodendronfuscum prevails. The description of the species is given in the Taxonomic Treatment section below.\n\nThe complexity of Uvariodendronmolundense\n\nThe species Uvariodendronmolundense (Engler & Diels) R.E.Fr. is distributed in Cameroon and Gabon. In 1969, Le Thomas synonymized the names Uvariodendronmayumbense and Uvariodendronletestui with Ud.molundense. Indeed, the position of the flowers along the trunk and branches, previously used to discriminate these species (Fries 1930), was no longer valid as some specimens are both cauliflorous and ramiflorous (Le Thomas 1969). Le Thomas (1969) also described the variety Uvariodendronmolundensevar.citrata form some specimens from Gabon exhibiting a strong lemon scent. The examination of 106 specimens identified as Ud.molundense revealed that this species shows a great morphological variability, especially for the leaf shape. For example, some specimens show young leaves with decurrent bases, whereas older leaves have a rounded base. The specimens identified as Ud.molundense form three phylogenetically supported groups separated by relatively high molecular divergence (Fig. , Suppl. materials 1, 2), at least as much molecular divergence as between other clearly morphologically divergent species (e.g. between Ud.dzomboense and Ud.pycnophyllum). Although the three groups have morphological similarities, we were able to distinguish them and we thus propose to separate them in three distinct species: Ud.molundense, Ud.citriodorum (Le Thomas) Dagallier & Couvreur, and Ud.pilosicarpum Dagallier & Couvreur. The full and valid descriptions of Ud.citriodorum and Ud.pilosicarpum are given in the Taxonomic Treatment section.\n\nTaxonomic revision of Dennettia, Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis\n\nTaxonomic history\n\nUvariodendron\n\nThe names referring to species later placed within Uvariodendron were first described by Bentham (1862) as Uvariaconnivens and Uvariafusca and by Engler and Diels (1899) as Uvariaangustifolia and Uvariagigantea (Engler and Diels 1899). The placement of these four tree species within the mainly liana genus Uvaria L. was based on similarities of the flowers. Based on this, Engler and Diels (1901) grouped them into the new section within Uvaria: sect. Uvariodendron Engl. & Diels (literally meaning âtree Uvariaâsâ). For the next 30 years, several new tree species from Central and East Africa were described within this section: Uvariamegalantha Diels and Uvariawinkleri Diels (Diels 1907); Uvariamolundensis Diels and Uvariapycnophylla Diels (Diels 1915); Uvarialetestui Pellegrin (Pellegrin 1920); Uvariagossweileri Exell and Uvariamayumbensis Exell (Exell 1926) and finally Uvariamannii Hutch. & Dalziel (Hutchinson and Dalziel 1927b).\n\nIn 1930, Fries (1930) revised several Annonaceae genera, and erected sect. Uvariodendron to genus status. The morphological characters that distinguished Uvariodendron from the Uvaria L. were the tree habit (vs. liana in Uvaria), the indumentum of simple hairs (vs. generally stellate hairs) and flowers borne on the trunk or axillary (vs. terminal). Fries thus combined the âtree Uvariaâ names cited above as: Uvariodendronangustifolium (Engl. & Diels) R.E.Fr., Uvariodendronconnivens (Benth.) R.E.Fr., Uvariodendronfuscum (Benth.) R.E.Fr., Uvariodendrongiganteum (Engl.) R.E.Fr., Uvariodendronletestui (Pellegrin) R. E. FR., Uvariodendronmayumbense (Exell) R. E. Fr., Uvariodendronmolundense (Diels) R. E. Fr. and Uvariodendronpycnophyllum (Diels) R. E. Fr. He also synonymised the name Uvariamegalantha Diels and Uvariawinkleri Diels with Uvariodendronconnivens (Benth.) R.E.Fr., and described three new species: Uvariodendroncalophyllum R.E.Fr., Uvariodendronmirabile R.E.Fr. and Uvariodendronusambarense R.E.Fr. (Fries 1930). A few years later, Exell and MendonÃ§a combined the Angolan Uvariagossweileri into Uvariodendrongossweileri (Exell and MendonÃ§a 1937). In 1955, Verdcourt published the new species Uvariodendronanisatum Verdc. from Kenya (Verdcourt 1955). Towards the end of the 1960âs, several new species were described. Le Thomas described the new Uvariodendronoccidentale Le Thomas distinguishing it from Uvariodendronmirabile R.E.Fr. (Le Thomas 1967). In her Flore du Gabon, Le Thomas also described a new variety Uvariodendronmolundensevar.citrata Le Thomas, and synonymised the names Uvariodendronletestui Pellegrin and Uvariodendronmayumbense (Exell) R.E.Fr. with Uvariodendronmolundense (Diels) R.E.Fr. (Le Thomas 1969). The same year, Verdcourt (1969) described three new species from East Africa: Uvariodendrongorgonis Verdc., Uvariodendronkirkii Verdc., and Uvariodendronmagnificum Verdc. (Verdcourt 1969). Later, he also described Uvariodendronoligocarpum Verdc. (Verdcourt 1986), a species that was recently combined into Polyceratocarpusoligocarpus (Verdc.) Dagallier (Dagallier et al. 2021). Finally, Dagallier et al. (2021) published three new species from Kenyan and Tanzanian coastal forests: Uvariodendrondzomboense Dagallier, W.R.Q. Luke & Couvreur, Uvariodendronmbagoi Dagallier & Couvreur, and Uvariodendronschmidtii W.R.Q. Luke, Dagallier & Couvreur. In the Annonaceae treatment for the Flora of Cameroon (Couvreur et al. 2022) the name Uvariodendronmirabile R.E.Fr. was synonymized with Uvariodendronfuscum (Benth.) R.E.Fr., as well as the name Uvariodendrongiganteum (Engl.) R.E.Fr., that was combined into the variety Uvariodendronfuscumvar.giganteum. Here, based on molecular and morphological analysis, we reassess the name Uvariodendronmolundense into three species: Ud.molundense, Ud.citriodorum comb. et stat. nov. (ex. Ud.molundensevar.citrata) and Ud.pilosicarpum sp. nov. and describe Ud.kimbozaense sp. nov. and Ud.mossambicense sp. nov. from East Africa. We also combine the name Ud.magnificum within Ud.fuscum as the variety Ud.fuscumvar.magnificum comb. et stat. nov. Thus to date, and after this taxonomic work, Uvariodendron contains 18 species.\n\nNote about the genus name Uva: According to Kuntze, who undertook nomenclatural work between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, the generic name Uva should be used instead of Uvaria (Kuntze 1891). Indeed, Burman was the first to use the name Uva in his Thesaurus Zelanica (Burman 1736), but LinnÃ© changed the name to Uvaria while citing the same specimen and describing the same species (LinnÃ© 1747). Kuntze underlines that no nomenclatural rule precludes the use of the name Uva and favours its use over the name Uvaria (Kuntze 1891). Among other invalid Uvaria names, he corrects the names Uvariagigantea Engler to Uvagigantea Engler, Uvariaangustifolia Engler & Diels to Uvaangustifolia Engler & Diels (Kuntze 1891), Uvariaconnivens Benth. to Uvaconnivens Benth. and Uvariafusca Benth to Uvafusca Benth. (Kuntze 1903). Regardless, the use of Uva was apparently not followed by the scientific community even today as the name Uvaria continues to be used (Diels 1907; Meade and Parnell 2018; Turner 2018).\n\nDennetia and Uvariopsis\n\nThe genus Uvariopsis Engler was erected in 1899 with the description of Uvariopsiszenkeri Engler (Engler and Diels 1899). As circumscribed at the time, the genus was distinguished by its mainly unisexual flowers, two sepals and four fused petals. A few years later, Diels erected the genus Tetrastemma Diels with the description of Tetrastemmadioicum Diels (Diels 1907). Tetrastemma was also characterised by unisexual flowers with two sepals and four petals, but differed from Uvariopsis by being dioecious and cauliflorous (vs. monoecious and ramiflorous), and by having free petals (vs. fused at base). Based on the free petals character, four other Tetrastemma species were described in the following years: Tetrastemmasolheidii De Wild. in 1909 (De Wildeman 1909), Tetrastemmapedunculosum Diels and Tetrastemmasessiliflorum Mildbr. & Diels in 1915 (Diels 1915), and Tetrastemmabakerianum Hutch. & Dalziel in 1927 (Hutchinson and Dalziel 1927a).\n\nIn parallel, two other genera, morphologically closed to Uvariopsis and Tetrastemma were described: Thonnera De Wild. and Denettia Baker f. The genus Thonnera included a single species Thonneracongolana De Wild. differing from Tetrastemma by flowers having three petals (De Wildeman 1909). In 1953, however, Fries combined this name into Uvariopsis as Uvariopsiscongolana (De Wild.) R.E.Fr. without further justification (Fries 1953). The genus Denettia Baker f. was characterised by having bisexual flowers with three sepals and three petals, which differed from Tetrastemma, Thonnera, and Uvariopsis. It included a single species Denettiatripetala Baker f. (Baker 1913).\n\nIn 1933, Robyns & GhesquiÃ¨re described Uvariopsisvanderystii Robyns & Ghesq., and suggested it was a kind of intermediate species showing characters of Tetrastemma, e.g. cauliflory, and of Uvariopsis, e.g. fused petals (Robyns and GhesquiÃ¨re 1933b). The same year, they revised the two genera with their âEssai de rÃ©vision des genres Uvariopsis Engl. & Diels et Tetrastemma Diels (AnnonacÃ©es)â (Robyns and GhesquiÃ¨re 1933a). In this publication, they described several new species: Uvariopsisbatesii Robyns & Ghesq., Uvariopsischevalieri Robyns & Ghesq. and Uvariopsiscongensis Robyns & Ghesq. The later species is ramiflorous and has free petals, which again showed intermediate characters between Uvariopsis and Tetrastemma. Based on these intermediate species, Robyns & GhesquiÃ¨re (1933a) extended the morphological concept of Uvariopsis and combined the name Tetrastemma with Uvariopsis. The new species combinations were: Uvariopsisbakeriana (Hutch. & Daltz.) Robyns & Ghesq., Uvariopsisdioica (Diels) Robyns & Ghesq., Uvariopsispedunculosa (Diels) Robyns & Ghesq., Uvariopsissessiliflora (Mildb. & Diels) Robyns & Ghesq., Uvariopsissolheidii (De Wild.) Robyns & Ghesq. In 1948, Pellegrin described Uvariopsisletestui Pellegr., a species from Gabon (Pellegrin 1948), and three years later Exell and MendonÃ§a described a species from Angola: Uvariopsisnoldeae Exell & MendonÃ§a (Exell and MendonÃ§a 1951). In 1952, Keay published the species Uvariopsisglobiflora Keay (Keay 1952). He also combined a species previously described by Chevalier under the name Uvariaspectabilis Chev. (Chevalier 1920) and cited in the Flora of Tropical West Africa as Uvariaspectabilis Chev. ex Hutch. & Dalziel (Hutchinson and Dalziel 1927a) into Uvariopsisguineensis (Chev. ex Hutch. & Dalziel) Keay (Keay 1952). More than 30 years later, Verdcourt described Uvariopsisbisexualis Verdc. from Tanzania. Although this species has bisexual flowers, Verdcourt placed it in Uvariopsis based on pollen morphology closely ressembling species of Uvariopsis (Verdcourt 1986). The concept of Uvariopsis was thus enlarged to include bisexual species.\n\nGereau and Kenfack (2000) described the species Uvariopsiskorupensis Gereau & Kenfack followed by the publication of Uvariopsissubmontana Kenfack, Gosline & Gereau (Kenfack et al. 2003). In that later publication, the name Denettiatripetala Baker f. was combined into Uvariopsistripetala (Baker f.) G.E. Schatz. based on the concept of Uvariopsis now also included species with bisexual flowers (Verdcourt 1986; Kenfack et al. 2003). More recently, the Tanzanian species Uvariopsislovettiana Couvreur & W.R.Q. Luke (Couvreur and Luke 2010) and the Gabonese species Uvariopsiscitrata Couvreur & Niangadouma (Couvreur and Niangadouma 2016) were described. In the Flora of Cameroon Annonaceae (Couvreur et al. 2022), the species Uvariopsisetugeana Dagallier & Couvreur was described and the name Uvariopsisvanderystii Robyns & Ghesq. was synonymized with Uvariopsispedunculosa (Diels) Robyns & Ghesq. Finally, the species Uvariopsisdicaprio Cheek & Gosline was described from Cameroon (Gosline et al. 2022). In the present work, based on molecular and morphological analyses, we retain the name Dennettiatripetala and thus the genus Dennettia (see discussion above). We also describe a new species, Up.oligocarpa sp. nov., and synonymize the names Up.sessiliflora with Up.dioica, Up.globiflora with Up.guineensis and Up.letestui with Up.solheidii. For the two laters, we combine the names into varieties as Up.guineensisvar.globiflora comb. et stat. nov. and Up.solheidiivar.letestui comb. et stat. nov., respectively. We also describe a new variety of Up.congensis, Up.congensisvar.angustifolia var. nov. and provide a preliminary description of potentially three new species which lack sufficient material to be formally described. This brings the total number of Uvariopsis species to 17 (and three that have yet to be formally described).\n\nMorphology and informative characters\n\nVegetative characters\n\nThe genera Dennettia, Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis are trees or shrubs with plagiotropic branches on an orthotropic axis, with indumentum of simple hairs and with no latex or exudate. A distichous phyllotaxis of the primary axis (the trunk) was reported for Ud.pycnophyllum (Johnson 2003) but no information was reported for the other species nor for Dennettia and Uvariopsis. The trunks are generally cylindrical and straight, with no buttresses. The base of the trunk of some Uvariopsis species (Up.dioica, Up.submonana, Up.korupensis) can be thickened by the growth of numerous inflorescences clumped on the trunk between the ground to generally ca. 50 cm (up to 4 m).\n\nThe branches can be sparsely pubescent when young, but the hairs generally fall off with age. The dense brown tomentum on the young branches persisting on older branches distinguishes Ud.calophyllum from the other species of Uvariodendron. The species Ud.fuscum (var. giganteum and var. magnificum) also have a characteristic indumentum of long soft hairs producing a whitish appearance on the younger branches, but that quickly disappear in older branches.\n\nIn the three genera, the leaves are distichous, simple, entire, exstipulate, with the midrib impressed above, raised below, the secondary veins weakly brochidodromous to brochidodromous and the tertiary veins reticulate. Dennettia has relatively small (less than 160 mm long) elliptic leaves, while Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis have a range of leaf shapes, from elliptic to obovate to oblong, ranging from 65 to 750 mm long. Uvariodendronfuscumvar.giganteum has one of the longest leaves of Annonaceae in Africa, up to 60 cm long (Couvreur et al. 2022). In contrast to other genera (e.g. Uvariastrum; Couvreur 2014) the leaf base shape is not a very useful taxonomic character to distinguish species because several different shapes (e.g. from acute to rounded) can occur within species. However, subcordate leaf bases are generally found in Up.bakeriana, Up.citrata, Up.korupensis, and Up.submontana, and decurrent leaf bases in Ud.pilosicarpum, Up.bisexualis, Up.congensis, Up.lovettiana, Up.oligocarpa and Up.zenkeri. Some species have apparent complex leaf bases, like rounded in shape but minutely decurrent when looking at the very base (Ud.citriodorum, Ud.gorgonis, Ud.molundense). In Uvariodendronkimbozaense, the midrib is slightly raised above with a central groove all along the length of the midrib. This is unique in the genus, but raised midribs occur in other genera such as Isolona, Monodora and Ophrypetalum (Couvreur 2009), and raised and grooved midribs occur in Cremastosperma (Pirie et al. 2018). The petiole in Uvariopsis is generally short and thick, less than 6 mm long with a length:width ratio less than 2, whereas in Uvariodendron the petiole is generally longer than 4 mm with a length:width ratio between 2 and 5.\n\nIn Uvariodendron, several species (Ud.dzomboense, Ud.gorgonis, Ud.mossambicense and Ud.schmidtii) show âeragrostiformâ leaf buds, that are terminal or axillary buds composed of several (generally 5 to 12) distichous and densely pubescent scales (Figs , , ). The term âeragrostiformâ relates to the genus Eragrostis (Poaceae) and its typical form of flattened spikelet composed of compact and clustered florets. Even though this feature is striking, it should be noted that not all the specimens of a same species present this kind of buds, so it is hard to use it as a diagnostic character. The phenology or the environment may influence the establishment of eragrostiform buds, which might protect the meristem against drought or herbivores.\n\nThe scent of crushed leaves and/or bark can be used as a distinctive character. Uvariodendroncitriodorum and Up.citrata emit a strong lemon scent (Le Thomas 1969; Couvreur and Niangadouma 2016), a feature also shared by some specimens of Ud.gorgonis. Crushed leaves and bark of Ud.mbagoi have a strong bergamot scent (between orange and lemon) (Dagallier et al. 2021), and all parts of Ud.anisatum smell of anise. Ud.angustifolium is also reported as having a strong aromatic scent.\n\nInflorescences and flowers\n\nIn contrast to sterile parts, Dennettia, Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis have very different fertile parts. In Annonaceae, the inflorescence is a rhipidium, i.e. determinate (sympodial) inflorescence with a terminal flower and lateral cymose and monochasial partial inflorescences (Weberling and Hoppe 1996). Inflorescences of Dennettia, Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis are axillary and borne on leafy twigs or borne on old branches (ramiflory) or on the trunk (cauliflory), depending on the species. The position of the flower was regarded as an important character to characterize some species like Ud.molundense and Up.guineensis (Keay 1952; Le Thomas 1967, 1969) but it appears to be unreliable in Uvariodendron and Uvariopsis (see also Le Thomas 1969). In the three genera, the flower pedicels are not articulate and display from one to six bracts at their base and from one to four bracts on the lower half of the pedicel. As flowers mature, most of the bracts fall off, except the uppermost bract. Usually, fallen bracts leave a scar on the pedicel.\n\nIn Dennettia, the inflorescences are axillary and borne on leafy twigs or borne on old branches, held by a tiny peduncle. They can be composed of up to six flowers, but one or two-flowered inflorescence are the most common. The flowers of Dennettia are bisexual. They are composed of one whorl of three sepals and one single whorl of three petals, which is characteristic of the genus in the Monodoreae. In Annonaceae, single whorls of three petals can be found in Annickia, Annona, and Dasymaschalon (van Heusden 1992).\n\nIn Uvariodendron, the inflorescences are axillary and borne on leafy twigs, borne on old branches or borne on the trunk. The axis of the inflorescences are contracted, rendering their interpretation difficult without a detailed morpho-anatomical study. They appear to be rhipidia composed of one or two (in most species), three (Ud.calophyllum, Ud.gorgonis, Ud.mbagoi) or rarely up to 11 (Ud.kimbozaense) flowers. Generally, in multi-flowered rhipidia, the flower in the terminal position is fully developed while the lower flowers on the axis are buds.\n\nFlowers in Uvariodendron are bisexual with one whorl of three sepals and two whorls of three petals, as usually found in Annonaceae (van Heusden 1992). The fusion and arrangement of the sepals is used to distinguish between species: always fused (Ud.angustifolium, Ud.dzomboense, Ud.fuscum, Ud.mossambicense, Ud.occidentale, Ud.pycnophyllum, Ud.schmidtii), always imbricate (Ud.citriodorum, Ud.kimbozaense, Ud.mbagoi, Ud.pilosicarpum), or from free to fused to imbricate (Ud.anisatum, Ud.calophyllum, Ud.connivens, Ud.gorgonis, Ud.kirkii, Ud.molundense). The sepals are smaller and morphologically different to the petals. The outer and inner petals are subequal in length, ranging from 10 to 70 mm at anthesis. In bud, the outer petals are valvate (adpressed against each other all along the margin) whereas inner petals are valvate only at the apex. In mature flowers, the outer and inner petals are free, but the inner petals can remain adpressed at apex. In most species, the petals are cream to yellow in color, with a red/purple marking at the base of the inner side. Uvariodendronconnivens has petals that are pink to red all over and on both sides at anthesis, while the outer petals of Ud.calophyllum are covered with a dense tomentum leading to a brown flower. The stamens are numerous (more than 200), with linear anthers and truncate apical prolongation of the connective. The carpels vary from five to 160, they are free, linear, with a coiled stigma. The monocarps are sessile or subsessile and cylindrical.\n\nUvariopsis has inflorescences borne on trunk in most of the species, but can be axilary to leaves on young branches (Up.congensis, Up.guineensis, Up.lovettiana, Up.oligocarpa, Up.zenkeri). They are generally composed of one to three flowers. Like in Uvariodendron, the peduncle and partial peduncle are contracted, rendering their interpretation as rhipidium difficult. In particular, Up.dioica, Up.submontana and Up.korupensis have inflorescences in clumps of up to 50 flowers on the trunk.\n\nThe flower buds of Uvariopsis have different shapes important to discriminate between species (Kenfack et al. 2003). They can be globose (Up.congensis, Up.guineensis, Up.lovettiana, Up.oligocarpa, Up.pedunculosa, Up.zenkeri), ovoid to conical (Up.bisexualis, Up.citrata, Up.dioica, Up. noldeaea Up.solheidii, Up.submontana), pyramidal (Up.congolana, Up.dicaprio, Up.etugeana), or narrowly and long conical (Up.bakeriana, Up.korupensis). Flowering pedicels in Uvariopsis varies greatly from less than 11 mm (Up.bakeriana, Up.citrata, Up.congensis, Up.etugeana, Up.oligocarpa, and Up.zenkeri) to more than 100 mm up to 400 mm (Up.congolana, Up.pedunculosa). The flowers of Uvariopsis have one whorl of two sepals and one whorl of four petals (except Up.congolana which has three petals). In Annonaceae, flowers with two sepals and four petals are ra"
