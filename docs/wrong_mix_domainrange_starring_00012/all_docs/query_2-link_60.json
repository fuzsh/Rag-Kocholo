        "text": "Christmas has come early, just as it does every year around late September and early October, because that's when Hallmark wriggles down the chimney and delivers the most precious gift: the annual unveiling of the Hallmark Christmas movie schedule. This year, we're getting a whopping 42 festive movies with some of your favorite Hallmark stars.\n\nHallmark Channel's \"Countdown to Christmas,\" which began Friday, Oct. 20 and runs all the way through Thursday, Dec. 21, will include 31 film premieres, while Hallmark Movies & Mysteries' \"Miracles of Christmas\" will launch nine originals.\n\nStreaming service Hallmark Movies Now will debut two new titles, including a holiday adventure starring Rachael Leigh Cook and Sam Page. It will also add early access to select titles from this year's slate, as well as never-before-seen extended cuts from previous holiday hits, like 2022's Three Wise Men and a Baby with Paul Campbell, Tyler Hynes, and Andrew Walker.\n\nMany Hallmark favorites are back to ring in the holiday cheer, including Lacey Chabert (starring in two films, one of which she reunites with Party of Five's Scott Wolf), Catherine Bell, Jonathan Bennett, Campbell, Nikki DeLoach, James Denton, Hynes, Bethany Joy Lenz, Luke Macfarlane, Ryan Paevey, Janel Parrish, Kristoffer Polaha, Kimberley Sustad, Walker, and Victor Webster.\n\nAmong the new faces are Phylicia Rashad, Chris Carmack, Jonathan Frakes, Bryan Greenberg, Rick Hoffman, Jessica Parker Kennedy, and Vincent Rodriguez III, just to name a few.\n\nWith 42 festive films to choose from, we understand it can be overwhelming trying to make sense of which ones to prioritize.

If you're subscribed to Peacock Premium or Premium Plus, you can watch the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channels live through your account! Peacock also has a Hallmark hub featuring a library of past and present titles.

Will the stars align to bring these two together at the holidays?\n\nWhy We're Excited: It's tough to predict what may become breakout holiday films when there's dozens to parse through.

Plus, who doesn't love a good pun.\n\nSunday, November 5\n\nThe Santa Summit\n\nStars: Hunter King, Benjamin Hollingsworth\n\nLogline: It's time for the annual Santa Summit, in which revelers put on Santa suits and hop around designated locations in town to eat, drink, and be merry.

At the start of the night, Jordin meets and bonds with Liam (Hollingsworth), but doesn't get his name before getting separated and lost in a sea of Santas.

Emily, now embracing Evergreen Lane's uniquely festive spirit, is ready to work with Jared, Ned (Tobolowsky), Mary Louise (Travolta), and Pamela (Peterman) to make this year's Christmas celebrations the best yet — even if being the HOA president's girlfriend doesn't stop those dreaded decorating citations.

While there, she unwittingly discovers the ability to travel to the 1947 set of His Merry Wife! through the help of an hourglass.

Before she can return to the present, Lucy must make things right or threaten to alter the future forever.\n\nWhy We're Excited: We're suckers for anything involving time travel, which usually prompts hilarious fish-out-of-water moments and insane time-travel paradoxes.
