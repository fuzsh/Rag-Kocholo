It was a unashamed tribute, she said, to Karz.\n\nRaja Sen of Rediff.com gave it three and a half out of five stars and praised Shah Rukh, Padukone, and Talpade's performances. Om Shanti Om is a joyful, heady, joyous film that revels in Bollywood, and like at most parties where the bubbly flows freely, there is a lot of silly giggling and a great deal of immaturity, the author writes. He criticised the dialogue and too many cameo appearances in the movie.\n\nIn general, Om Shanti Om is a fun film that honours the Bollywood film business. The actors give engaging portrayals, and the musical and dance sequences are superb. Even though the second part of the film is not as good as the first, it is still a lot of fun and well worth seeing in its entirety.\n\nAccording to Rajeev Masand of News18, who gave the movie three stars out of five, Om Shanti Om is an entertainer in the true sense of the word, mixing up genre elements like comedy, drama, action, and emotion to create a heady broth of Created based Desai-style exaggerated entertainment. He honours the dialogue for so cleverly incorporating some of Bollywood's oldest clichés into the everyday speech of these characters. Shah Rukh's acting, was dull according to an Indo-Asian News Service commentator.\n\nCasting\n\nShah Rukh Khan as Om Prakash Makhija and Om Kapoor\n\nDeepika Padukone as Shantipriya and Sandy\n\nShreyas Talpade as Pappu Master\n\nKirron Kher as Bela Makhija (Om Makhija's mother)\n\nArjun Rampal as Mukesh Mehra (Shanti's husband)\n\nHaresh Hingorani as Faizan ‘F’ Khan (director of Om Shanti Om)\n\nVikram Sahu as Om Kapoor's doctor\n\nSuhas Khandke as Om Makhija's surgeon\n\nSharad as Mukesh's guard\n\nFarah Khan as the woman who makes fun of Om Makhija\n\nYuvika Chaudhary as Dolly Arora (Om Kapoor's heroine in Om Shanti Om)\n\nBindu Desai as Kamini Arora (Dolly's mother)\n\nCrew\n\nDirector- Farah Khan\n\nCinematography- V.
