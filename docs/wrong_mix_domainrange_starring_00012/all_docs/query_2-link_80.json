        "text": "Ready to continue with my reviews of fall-themed Hallmark Movies, I settled in for this little gem last night. “All of My Heart” stars the adorable Hallmark favorite, Lacey Chabert, and Brennan Elliot, who I had only ever seen as a “bad guy” in previous movies.\n\nThe Story– Jenny thinks she is getting engaged, but her douche-bag boyfriend is just celebrating a big promotion. I don’t know why she wants to marry him as he looks like a less-appealing George McFly from “Back to the Future”, but continuing on… Then she finds out that she has somehow inherited half of a big house in the sticks. The other half belongs to a stock broker, Brian. Jenny wants to put her amazing cooking skills to work and open a B&B, and Brian just wants to sell—until he tries her baking and helps give birth to baby goats and really sucks at carpentry. Creepy boyfriend comes back to make things uncomfortable, and I won’t spoil the rest.\n\nSeason Satisfaction-While this isn’t given a fall title, it did a pretty good job of making me wish for that lovely season. Some great sweaters, plenty of coffee, even a nice snuggle under an afghan on a swing are present to put us in the fall mood. Guess what though? It was a February/Valentine’s Day release back in 2015 when it debuted. Shocking! No hearts or candy or roses in sight! So, while it wasn’t necessarily meant for fall, I’m going to pretend it was."
