        "text": "Lacey Chabert and Scott Wolf are reuniting for an upcoming Hallmark Channel holiday film more than 20 years after they wrapped their iconic roles on \"Party of Five.\"\n\nThe duo, who played brother-sister duo Bailey and Claudia Salinger on the Fox series for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, are set to play siblings once again in a TV movie with the working title \"A Merry Scottish Christmas.\"\n\nA synopsis of the holiday film reads, \"When estranged siblings Lindsay (Chabert) and Brad (Wolf) travel to Scotland at Christmas to reunite with their mother Jo (Fiona Bell), a big family secret is revealed.\"\n\nThe festive film is written by Andrea Canning and Audrey Schulman, with Dustin Rikert directing.\n\n\"Scott and I have talked for years about doing another project together,\" Chabert, also known for playing Gretchen Wieners in \"Mean Girls,\" said in a press release. \"When we first read this story about these siblings at a crossroads, we both knew it was the perfect opportunity.\"\n\nSpeaking about their history together, Wolf said, \"Working with Lacey on 'Party of Five' was one of my favorite experiences ever. Reuniting after all of these years to tell such a beautiful story together is a dream that I'm so glad is coming true.\"\n\nLisa Hamilton Daly, executive vice president of programming at Hallmark Media, said the nostalgia of seeing Wolf and Chabert together again on the small screen will be a \"special holiday treat\" for viewers.\n\nNo official premiere date for the TV movie has yet been announced, but it will debut during the Hallmark Channel's annual Countdown to Christmas programming event."
