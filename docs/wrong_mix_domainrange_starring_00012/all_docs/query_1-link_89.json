        "text": "Bollywood films have always been my weak spot, watching them is my form of escapism. I grew up watching family-centric romantic movies from the 90s on Vasantham. Every movie was a spectacle to enjoy, the narrative was not paramount to the overall cinematic experience. I have always been mesmerised and ecstatic by the signature mise-en-scene of masala movies, filled with exuberant settings, intensely colourful costumes and larger-than-life characters.\n\nTaken from Agneepath (2012), another big budget masala film helmed by an established movie star, Hrithik Roshan.\n\nFor a girl growing up on a diet of Channel 8 (Singapore’s primary free-to-air mandarin television channel) slice-of-life dramas, it was as if I could be transported into another realm of fantasy.\n\nCompared to the scenes from Channel 8 above, any toddler would be captivated by Bollywood. So please, pardon my lack of objectivity in this week’s reflection. Om Shanti Om (2007) is my sing-a-long show, my love for this film is equivalent to a child’s blind appreciation for Frozen or Pororo. (Similarly, we both don’t know what we are singing) How do I grasp something to grossly sensuous as the pleasure of viewing?\n\nJust as how many commentators have pointed out this trend in Hollywood blockbusters, Rajadhyaksha (2008) believes that Indian cinema has seen a decline in narrative and psychological complexity in film characters because of Bollywood. Now, it is just a chain of empty spectacles all linked together by a largely non-functioning narrative to bring the audience from one amusement to another. (In Om Shanti Om, the first song paid homage to the Bollywood hits of the 70s. The spectator was transported from one lavish scene to the next for an education on the decade’s signature tropes and an introduction to the glitzy production awaiting from a Bollywood fan, the director Farah Khan.)\n\nA spectacle can be understood as “the conscious construction of a display by the film”, a sequence or a frame in which the film shows something to the spectator. How spectacles achieve their effect and the purpose it serves in a cinematic experience is underexplored as stated by Lewis (2014) in his thesis on the aesthetics of spectacle in mainstream cinema.\n\nOm Shanti Om is a brilliant spectacle, a parody and homage to the lovable idiosyncracies of Bollywood.\n\nScreen grabs taken from the film, Om Shanti Om, of the movies our main character is nominated as best actor for. Shah Rukh Khan is pictured holding a girl in his arms with a signature backdrop of mountains and fields.\n\nThe film allowed Shah Rukh Khan to recreate spoofs as his most famous role as Rahul in not one but SEVERAL bubblegum romances in the nineties. The self-referential humour initiated by Farah Khan is comedic ingenuity. It is the solid production value and hysterical entertainment that carries the absurdity of the whole movie into such a dizzying height of pleasure.\n\nThese GIFs above are taken from two different movies and in both of them, Shah Rukh Khan is still Rahul. (He continues to take on the name Rahul in several more films. I find the fact that there is a total of nine of them more absurd than Om Shanti Om.)\n\nHowever, the movie is often devalued into words such as “feel-good gimmicks”, “melodramatic”, “camp entertainers”. This is because of the assumptions that predicate what a spectacle is, and its distinction from the narrative. Today, most films are narrative-centred and naturalistic. We are used to such cinematic realism in most Hollywood, European films. The highly stylised emphasis on spectacle including music, dance and gestures is seen in Bollywood as superficial and empty. This judgement can be rationalised with a statement by McMahon (2007) using Immanuel Kant’s theory of Aesthetic Judgement.\n\nThe capacity to find pleasure in an object by virtue of aesthetic form is universal, but the ability to find pleasure in any particular object by virtue of aesthetic form will depend upon acculturation and learning.\n\nOur aesthetic judgement can all objectively recognise why something/someone could be appreciated for form and function but to go beyond recognising to a level where the thing or person contains ‘beauty’ (overriding function) is subjective to one’s social and cultural environment. How a spectacle is expressed in films and the particular form it has adopted sheds lights on the larger issue of the spectator’s relationship with the film, and perhaps Bollywood itself. Spectacles in Bollywood is an affective form of communication between the spectator and the film. (Lewis 2014) They allow spectators to connect with the material received in a visceral experience, something inwards before your mind can kick in to rationalise everything.\n\nOm Shanti Om crystallises what is importantly Bollywood, it depicts the strong sense of insular cultural tropes, universally entertaining despite being an iron adherence to India’s home culture. Even if it only portrays a facet of Indian culture and not its totality in weakness, it is a constant visible and audible reminder of the diversity in Asian sensibilities.\n\nReferences\n\nKhan, Farah. dir.
