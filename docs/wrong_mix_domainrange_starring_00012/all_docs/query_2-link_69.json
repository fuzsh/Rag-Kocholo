        "text": "Hallmark is ready to give the people what they want with more Lacey Chabert holiday awesomeness in Haul Out the Holly: Lit Up. There’s no doubt that the holiday season tends to make tensions run high, and this romantic-comedy film led by Chabert and Wes Brown truly embodies that as a festive feud breaks out amongst neighbors. Let the (reindeer) games begin.\n\nHAUL OUT THE HOLLY: LIT UP: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\n\nThe Gist: One year after Hallmark hit Haul Out the Holly comes its sequel film that brings viewers back to Evergreen Lane as some small-time celebrities move into the neighborhood next door to Emily (Lacey Chabert) to shake things up like a snow globe. The neighbors, especially the local HOA and its current head, Jared (Wes Brown), are thrilled to welcome Joe (Seth Morris), Jane (Jennifer Aspen), and young Jimmy Johnson (Kenneth Cummins), AKA the “Jolly Johnsons” who are known for being the reigning champions of reality TV series Ho Ho House.\n\nBut the three Johnsons come in with an extremely intense, hyper-competitive, and slightly elitist energy spearheaded by Jane that soon wears on the Evergreen Lane residents and violates multiple HOA guidelines and practices (which in that community is practically a cardinal sin). As a holiday feud of epic proportions escalates between the Johnsons and Emily, Jared, and the rest of the HOA—minus turncoat Ned (Stephen Tobolowsky)—only one side can be left standing as the holiday G.O.A.T.\n\nWhat Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Haul Out the Holly: Lit Up has the close-knot community vibe and fast talking quippiness of Gilmore Girls plus the next-door residence conflict of Neighbors, and the same kind of intense fervor for Christmas demonstrated by the Whos in How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\n\nAdditionally, the Johnson family has the same kind of aggressive competitiveness seen in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory‘s Violet Beauregarde.\n\nPerformance Worth Watching: Everyone! Truly, everyone in this movie is pretty darn delightful but returning stars Lacey Chabert and Wes Brown shine like Rudolph’s nose as natural comedic and romantic leads whilst playing Emily and Jared. Jennifer Aspen also is an absolute standout as hyper-competitive new neighbor Jane Johnson.\n\nMemorable Dialogue: “Why aren’t you happy, mom?” “Because victory isn’t the same without seeing the agony of defeat in the eyes of the vanquished.”\n\nA Holiday Tradition: Evergreen Lane truly has no shortage of holiday traditions (with or without the meddling of the Johnson family). There’s the cookie making competition, the tree lighting, and Christmas carnival, plus many more local seasonal events and celebrations to go around!\n\nDoes the Title Make Any Sense?: In addition to the first film’s “Haul Out the Holly” title taken from the song “We Need a Little Christmas,” we’ve got “Lit Up,” which is both a great descriptor for the Jolly Johnsons’ house post-Christmas decorating as well as the general erratic, near-drunken seeming behavior the HOA members exhibit after the Johnson family pushes them a little too far.\n\nOur Take: If you’re like me and never saw this movie’s predecessor, Haul Out the Holly, you may spend the first dozen minutes a bit confused. Haul Out the Holly: Lit Up dives right into the action basically immediately, clearly acting under the assumption that viewers have seen the previous film (which is admittedly usually the case for people watching a film sequel, anyway). But even with that said, once you get a little further into the movie it doesn’t take long to get a clear sense of who the returning players are, and soon enough everyone’s on the same page as newcomers the “Jolly Johnson” family enters the fold to make a serious splash at Evergreen Lane.\n\nUnless you’re a true Scrooge, I truly don’t see how you can’t help but love the many dynamic characters in this movie who are just bursting at the seams with personality and holiday cheer. Between the clever and witty writing, talented and fully committed cast, and general air of silliness taken seriously, Haul Out the Holly: Lit Up is pure fun and magic in all its campy Christmasy glory. It must have been a blast to make, because it sure is a joy to behold."
