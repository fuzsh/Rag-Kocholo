        "text": "HALLMARK'S BELOVED ON-SCREEN COUPLE LACEY CHABERT AND BRENNAN ELLIOTT REUNITE IN \"HIS & HERS\" (wt) A NEW, ORIGINAL MOVIE SET TO BEGIN PRODUCTION FOR PREMIERE DURING HALLMARK CHANNEL'S 2024 FALL INTO LOVE PROGRAMMING EVENT\n\nMovie Marks Chabert's Third Hallmark Project in 2024 Joining Previously Announced Unscripted Series Celebrations with Lacey Chabert and Her 15th Hallmark Holiday Movie, The Christmas Quest\n\nSTUDIO CITY, CA - June 10, 2024 - Hallmark Channel announced today that production is set to begin on His & Hers (wt), a new, original movie starring Lacey Chabert (Haul out the Holly, Mean Girls) and Brennan Elliott (Ms. Christmas Comes to Town, The Gift of Peace). Set to premiere later this year during the network's annual Fall into Love programming event, the movie reunites Hallmark's beloved on-screen couple Chabert and Elliott for the 10th time since their first on-screen pairing back in 2015.\n\nThis movie marks Chabert's third project coming to Hallmark this year, joining her previously announced new aspirational unscripted series, Celebrations with Lacey Chabert, and The Christmas Quest, Chabert's 15th holiday movie set to premiere during Hallmark Channel's juggernaut Countdown to Christmas programming event, celebrating its 15th year.\n\n\"We are so excited to reunite Hallmark's perennial fan-favorite Lacey Chabert and Brennan Elliott in this all-new movie. Three years having past since they've appeared together on screen, this witty and playful romcom will showcase their undeniable chemistry - a treat for our Hallmark viewers,\" said Ayse Francis, Director of Programming, Hallmark Media.\n\nMarried couple Dana (Chabert) and Mark (Elliott) are high-powered lawyers at two separate New York City law firms. They soon find themselves on opposing sides of a messy divorce between two reality stars, Sammy and Brett. When both clients are unable to compromise, Dana and Mark are headed for a courtroom showdown that results in tensions infiltrating their otherwise happy household.\n\n\"A chance to reunite with my dear friend, Brennan Elliot and bringing these stories to the audience together is always such a joyful experience. I hope the fans enjoy these new characters!,\" Chabert enthused.\n\n\"I have been so blessed and lucky to have been able to star in 10 films with Lacey Chabert! She is a great friend, and collaborating with her on screen has been one of the most treasured and impactful joys of my career,\" Elliott remarked.\n\nHis & Hers is from His And Hers Productions Ltd. Kristofer McNeeley is executive producer. The movie is produced by Charles Cooper. Robert Murdoch is line producer. Linda-Lisa Hayter directed from a script by Susan Black and Joie Botkin.\n\n# # #\n\nwww.HallmarkChannel.com Facebook: @HallmarkChannel X: @HallmarkChannel Pinterest: @HallmarkChannel\n\nLacey Chabert Instagram: @thereallacey X: @IamLaceyChabert Brennan Elliott Instagram: @brennanelliott2"
