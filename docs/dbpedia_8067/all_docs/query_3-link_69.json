        "text": "American flags come in a variety of styles and materials. Here, we'll review the various types of American flag materials available, discuss available flag features, and outline how to choose the material that works best for you!\n\nAmerican Flag Materials\n\nOne of the most common questions we get from our customers is: What type of American flag material is right for me? In the short video below, we answer that question and review three of the most common American flag materials that we offer. Watch to learn more!\n\nSelecting the Right Flag Material\n\nNylon: This heavyweight Dupont nylon is the most versatile and longest lasting nylon fabric available. It's combination of strength and brilliant display, along with its quick-drying ability, make it suitable for a wide range of applications. Great in rainy areas, its lightweight and close weave enable it to fly in the slightest breeze, giving it the fullest visual effect.\n\n2-Ply Polyester: 100% spun polyester. Woven construction utilizing a 2-ply spun polyester thread for extra strength. Combining durability, strength, and quality appearance, with a rich feel and look. These are ideal for extreme weather conditions without the excess weight. Ideal for high wind areas, and for daily flying.\n\nCotton: A traditional and historically relevant fabric, flag cotton is natural fiber bunting made of heavyweight 2 ply mercerized cotton. It combines extremely rich, vibrant colors, and decent wearing quality for excellent overall appearance and value. Of the three materials cotton is the least suited to sustained outdoor use and will wear fastest.\n\nReady to browse your options? Shop all of our American Flags HERE!\n\nAmerican Flag Construction Features\n\nWe exceed US government specifications for material and workmanship on our nylon American flags. Unlike others, we use superior bonded nylon thread for extra strength. Our American flags are 100% Made in the USA.\n\nCheck out the key flag construction features that set our American flags apart!\n\nDurable canvas header & #2 solid brass grommets\n\nThe flag fly end is reinforced by four rows of needle lock stitching. The fly corners on all sizes of our Battle-ToughÂ® & Steadfast are box stitched for extra durability. All other flags 8x12' and larger feature multiple rows of reinforced fly end stitching with increased stitching as sizes increase.\n\nNylon halyard is run through the header for strength purposes on most sizes 8x12' and larger. Instead of grommets, these larger flags will usually feature galvanized thimbles to ensure secure connection to your flagpole.\n\nOn select larger flags, metal D-Rings in lieu of rope and thimble.\n\nRichly embroidered stars are featured on all U.S. Flags unless otherwise indicated. Larger sizes may have fully sewn applique stars whereas some budget minded flags may have printed stars.\n\nAmerican Flag Stitching\n\nRemember that old strand of Christmas lights? The kind that when 1 bulb goes out, they all go out? It's the same way with many American Flags and how they are stitched! If you purchase a flag with chain stitching, as soon as one single thread breaks, the whole stripe will come completely apart! You've probably seen them on neighbors' houses right?\n\nWell, our outdoor flags will not do that! Ours have lock stitching not only on the fly end, but also on every stripe and around the canton (star field). Rest assured that no matter what material you choose, when you shop with Gettysburg Flag Works, you are getting the very best American Flag!\n\nWhat is the lifespan of a flag?\n\nA flag's life span is impossible to predict; it is like predicting the weather. The major enemies of a flag are wind, sun and carelessness...the single greatest cause of flag deterioration.\n\nNo one can control the weather, but you can take care of your flag and lengthen its life by doing the following:\n\nWashing your American flag occasionally in warm mild detergent\n\nLetting your flag dry thoroughly before storing it\n\nHaving your flag repaired at the first sign of fraying\n\nTaking your flag down at night and during bad weather\n\nRead more about the life span of a flag HERE!\n\nOur flags are manufactured to give maximum service in return for reasonable care and prudent use. Remember, no two flags receive identical wear. The best way to stretch your \"flag dollar\" is to have three flags: one flying, one in the wash, and a clean one in storage for special occasions.\n\nReady to purchase a new American flag?
