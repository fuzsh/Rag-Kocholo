        "text": "How should the American Flag patch be worn?\n\nU.S. federal code calls for the canton (star field) to always be positioned to the left.\n\nThe U.S. Code states \"no part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.\"\n\nThe U.S. Code does not address the positioning of the flag patch. It is appropriate to wear an American flag patch on the left or right sleeve. When worn on the left sleeve, the union would appear towards the front and the stripes would run horizontally toward the back. When worn on the right sleeve, it is considered proper to reverse the design so that the union is at the observer's right to suggest that the flag is flying in the breeze as the wearer moves forward.\n\nSince the law does not specifically address the positioning of the patch, a decision is left to the discretion of the organization prescribing the wear. As many states and cities have ordinances pertaining to the use of the flag, you may wish to contact the Attorney General of your state or the City Attorney's office regarding this matter.\n\nHow should the American Flag patch be worn on Army uniforms?\n\nPer Army Regulation 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia, all Soldiers will wear the full-color U.S. flag embroidered insignia on utility and organizational uniforms, unless deployed or in a field environment. Soldiers will wear the subdued tactical flag insignia while deployed or in a field environment. The U.S. flag insignia (full color or subdued) is 2\" X 3\" in size and is worn on the right shoulder pocket flap of utility uniforms and cold-weather jackets. The flag insignia is placed directly on top of the hook-and-loop-faced pad already provided on the uniforms' shoulder pocket flap. The subdued U.S. flag insignia is worn as directed by the commander under tactical field conditions. The U.S. flag embroidered insignia is worn so that the star field faces forward, or to the flag's own right. When worn in this manner, the flag is facing to the observer's right and gives the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer moves forward. The appropriate replica for the right shoulder sleeve is identified as the reverse side flag."
