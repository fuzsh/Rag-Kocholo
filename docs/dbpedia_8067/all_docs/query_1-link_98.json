        "text": "What are the colors of American flag?\n\nThe American flag has 3 primary colors, which are red, white and blue. The table below has the common and popular codes of these colors in HEX, RGB and CMYK formats along with Pantone (PMS), RAL and NCS (Natural Color System). Please note that HEX and RGB codes are to be used for digital works and web pages (including HTML and CSS) while the CMYK values are for printers. The United States of America (USA) flag is known as Stars and Stripes, Old Glory and the Star-Sprangled Banner.\n\nWhat is the meaning of colors in the United States of America (USA) flag?\n\nRed, white and blue, the three colors in the American flag, stand for hardiness and valour, purity and innocence and vigilance, perseverance, and justice, respectively. Also, specially in case of state flags, the meaning associated with the colors are generally endorsed by an official charter. However, at times the symbolism is simply understood by being descended from the culture of the land or has seeped so deeply into customs that, now, the two are inextricably linked. Please also note that there can be more than one meaning for the colors in the United States of America (USA) flag."
