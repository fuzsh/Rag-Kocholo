        "text": "Until the Executive Order of June 24, 1912, neither the order of the stars nor the proportions of the flag was prescribed. Consequently, flags dating before this period sometimes show unusual arrangements of the stars and odd proportions, these features being left to the discretion of the flag maker. In general, however, straight rows of stars and proportions similar to those later adopted officially were used. The principal acts affecting the flag of the United States are the following:\n\nFlag Resolution of June 14, 1777, stated, \"Resolved: that the flag of the United States be made of thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.\"\n\nAct of January 13, 1794, provided for 15 stripes and 15 stars after May 1795.\n\nAct of April 4, 1818, provided for 13 stripes and one star for each state, to be added to the flag on the 4th of July following the admission of each new state.\n\nExecutive Order of President Taft dated June 24, 1912, established proportions of the flag and provided for arrangement of the stars in six horizontal rows of eight each, a single point of each star to be upward.\n\nExecutive Order of President Eisenhower dated January 3, 1959, provided for the arrangement of the stars in seven rows of seven stars each, staggered horizontally and vertically.\n\nExecutive Order of President Eisenhower dated August 21, 1959, provided for the arrangement of the stars in nine rows of stars staggered horizontally and eleven rows of stars staggered vertically.\n\nNUMBER OF STARS IN THE U.S. FLAG, AND ADDITIONAL STATES REPRESENTED\n\n1777 TO PRESENT\n\nDate of Flag\n\nAdditional states with date of entry into Union\n\n20 stars - 1818 to July 3, 1819\n\nTennessee (June 1, 1796)\n\nOhio (March 1, 1803)\n\nLouisiana (April 30, 1812)\n\nIndiana (December 11, 1816)\n\nMississippi (December 10, 1817)\n\n21 stars - July 4, 1819 to July 3, 1820\n\nIllinois (December 3, 1818)\n\n23 stars - July 4, 1820 to July 3, 1822\n\nAlabama (December 14, 1819)\n\nMaine (March 15, 1820)\n\n24 stars - July 4, 1822 to July 3, 1836\n\nMissouri (August 10, 1821)\n\n25 stars - July 4, 1836 to July 3, 1837\n\nArkansas (June 15, 1836)\n\n26 stars - July 4, 1837 to July 3, 1845\n\nMichigan (Jan 26, 1837)\n\n27 stars - July 4, 1845 to July 3, 1846\n\nFlorida (March 3, 1845)\n\n28 stars - July 4, 1846 to July 3, 1847\n\nTexas (December 29, 1845)\n\n29 stars - July 4, 1847 to July 3, 1848\n\nIowa (December 28, 1846)\n\n30 stars - July 4, 1848 to July 3, 1851\n\nWisconsin (May 29, 1848)\n\n31 stars - July 4, 1851 to July 3, 1858\n\nCalifornia (September 9, 1850)\n\n32 stars - July 4, 1858 to July 3, 1859\n\nMinnesota (May 11, 1858)\n\n33 stars - July 4, 1859 to July 3, 1861\n\nOregon (February 14, 1859)\n\n34 stars - July 4, 1861 to July 3, 1863\n\nKansas (January 29, 1861)\n\n35 stars - July 4, 1863 to July 3, 1865\n\nWest Virginia (June 20, 1863)\n\n36 stars - July 4, 1865 to July 3, 1867\n\nNevada (October 31, 1864)\n\n37 stars - July 4, 1867 to July 3, 1877\n\nNebraska (March 1, 1867)\n\n38 stars - July 4, 1877 to July 3, 1890\n\nColorado (August 1, 1876)\n\n43 stars - July 4, 1890 to July 3, 1891\n\nNorth Dakota (November 2, 1889)\n\nSouth Dakota (November 2, 1889)\n\nMontana (November 8, 1889)\n\nWashington (November 11, 1889)\n\nIdaho (July 3, 1890)\n\n44 stars - July 4, 1891 to July 3, 1896\n\nWyoming (July 10, 1890)\n\n45 stars - July 4, 1896 to July 3, 1908\n\nUtah (January 4, 1896)\n\n46 stars - July 4, 1908 to July 3, 1912\n\nOklahoma (November 16, 1907)\n\nPrepared by the Armed Forces History Collections,\n\nin cooperation with Public Inquiry Services,\n\nSmithsonian Institution\n\nRev. 9/2001"
