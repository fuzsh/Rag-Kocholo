        "text": "The American flag is an important symbol of our nation that has undergone many significant changes through the centuries. This quick guide explains the history of the appearance and the meaning behind the American flag.\n\nThe Creation of the First American Flag\n\nThe first official American flag was created on June 14, 1777. The Continental Congress approved the establishment of the flag in honor of the day America gained independence from England. The creator of the first American flag is unknown. However, many historians believe the flag was designed by New Jersey Congressman Francis Hopkinson and sewn by Betsy Ross.\n\nThe Appearance of the American Flag\n\nBefore the American flag got its name, it was called the Betsy Ross Flag. This flag had 13 red and white stripes, which represented the 13 original colonies of New England. The blue square in the upper left-hand corner of the flag contained the Union Jack symbol. In 1776, a circle of 13 stars replaced the Union Jack to represent the union of the colonies. The numbers of stars changed as states were added to the Union. Thatâs why our current flag has 50 stars.\n\nThe flagâs design has changed, but the colors have remained the same. Blue represents resilience and justice; white represents innocence; and red represents strength and courage.\n\nFlag Etiquette\n\nBecause the flag is such an important part of American history, it should be treated with respect. To mourn American heroes, the flag must be raised to the top of the flagpole and then lowered halfway. Unless the flag is weather-resistant, it should never be displayed in poor weather conditions. During a ceremony with many flags, the American flag should be to the far right of the line or in the center and in front of the other flags."
