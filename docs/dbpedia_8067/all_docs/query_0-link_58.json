        "text": "About CAL FIRE\n\nThe team at California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) are dedicated to the fire prevention, fire protection and stewardship of over 31 million acres of California’s privately-owned wildlands. In addition, the Department provides varied emergency services in 36 of the State’s 58 counties via contracts with local governments.\n\nPreventing wildfires in the State Responsibility Area is a vital part of CAL FIRE’s mission. While these efforts have occurred since the early days of the Department, CAL FIRE has adapted to the evolving destructive wildfires and succeeded in significantly increasing its efforts in fire prevention. We work to prevent wildfire through wildland pre-fire engineering, vegetation management, fire planning, education and law enforcement."
