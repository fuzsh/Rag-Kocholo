        "text": "Interesting suggestion. I read the [very old] discussion [that went nowhere]. Several commentators noted the distinction between country flags and languages spoken in those countries. For instance, Switzerland has one flag but four official languages.\n\nWhile country flag images may suggest to people visiting a website that the content is available in more than one language, the use of a national flag does not imply that transnational languages are implemented on the website. For instance, I would never use the Union Flag (the official flag of the United Kingdom) on any of my websites. As a proud Australian, I would display the Australian flag (perhaps) ... but so what? Flags do not mean languages. Worse, flag images are useless to people who have visual impairment (even if you used an \"alt=\" tag.\n\nAs I say, it's an interesting suggestion. I think it's a good idea if J! offers the ability to use SVG instead of GIF. Some people will probably be attracted to use scalable graphics instead of \"ugly\" GIFs. That's about as far as I am prepared to go, though. Offer the choice, yes; implement the feature at one's own discretion (or risk, or peril). :)"
