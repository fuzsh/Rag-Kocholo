        "text": "The following selected and individual Reserve programs are available:\n\nIndividual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA)\n\nReservists serve as backfill support on contingencies and deployments throughout the Air Force, Department of Defense and other government agencies.\n\nActive Guard Reserve (AGR)\n\nReservists serve full time on active-duty assignments and receive active-duty benefits for the duration of their contract.\n\nAir Reserve Technician (ART)\n\nReservists serve in a dual-status position. They’ll work full time as a civilian employee one weekend a month and perform at least 14 days of annual training per year.\n\nTraditional Reserve (TR)\n\nReservists serve in traditional part time service. They’ll work one weekend a month and perform at least 14 days of annual training per year.\n\nLearn more about Reservists programs.\n\nTo join the Air Force Reserve, you must be between the ages of 17 and have not reached your 42nd birthday, a current U.S. citizen, and have obtained either a high school diploma or GED. Applicants can’t have any serious law violations or drug use or serious health problems.\n\nAdditionally, you must pass the Armed Services Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and a physical. The ASVAB covers four critical areas: arithmetic reasoning, mathematics, word knowledge and paragraph comprehension. This is used to determine whether you’re a good fit for the Air Force Reserve and the best career field to place you in.\n\nDeployment depends on your AFSC (Air Force Specialty Code), your assigned unit and the needs of the Air Force at any given time. In general, there’s no set deployment schedule for Reservists.\n\nMost Reservist missions will be for logistics and support, but some specialties such as the Security Forces are more combat-oriented. While it’s not unusual to not deploy at all, all Reservists have to deploy when the circumstances require."
