I’ve downloaded and ran the above program with the current material dimensions listed for the tutorial (14 3/16 x 10 9/16). How do I duplicate the same thing on a piece of material measuring 19 x 14? Struggling with scaling. Thanks in advance for your help!\n\nFirst set the Stock size to 19 x 14, then select everything then choose the scale tool:\n\nSet things to 19 inches wide, then center it on the stock area and trim half of 0.235 or so from each side.\n\nYou may need to inset the paths if the features get too large to cut with your V endmill."
