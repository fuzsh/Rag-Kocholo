        "text": "i came here because i had the same problem, when i inspect the element i can see the file, but on the site i can't (even when using localhost)\n\nthe answer to my problem was in saving the SVG file. If you saved it from illustrator make sure to click 'embed' and not 'link'. as link will just refer to your local files rather than include the data (If i understand it correctly).\n\nI read about it on the adobe website which has some other useful tips for exporting http://www.adobe.com/inspire/2013/09/exporting-svg-illustrator.html\n\nThis worked for me, hope it was useful.\n\nI had a similar problem and the existing answers to this either weren't applicable, or worked but we couldn't use them for other reasons. So I had to figure out what Chrome disliked about our SVGs.\n\nIn our case in turned out to be that the id attribute of the symbol tag in the SVG file had a : in it, which Chrome didn't like. Soon as I removed the : it worked fine.\n\nBad:\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 72 72\"> <defs> <symbol id=\"ThisIDHasAColon:AndChromeDoesNotLikeIt\"> ... </symbol> </defs> <use .... xlink:href=\"#ThisIDHasAColon:AndChromeDoesNotLikeIt\" /> </svg>\n\nGood:\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 72 72\"> <defs> <symbol id=\"NoMoreColon\"> ... </symbol> </defs> <use .... xlink:href=\"#NoMoreColon\" /> </svg>\n\nI had this problem when i exported images from figma. Check source code of svg, if you have colon : in ids like this: id=\"paint1_linear_23:318\" it'll make you the problems with rendering in chrome.\n\nJust remove all colons in ids.\n\nDon't forget make the same with referring to this ids like this: fill=\"url(#paint1_linear_23:318)\".\n\nlooks like a Chrome bug, i did something else as i almost got crazy because of this... using Chrom debugger if you change the css of the svg object it shows on the screen.\n\nso what i did was: 1. check for screen size 2. listen to the \"load\" event of my SVG object 3. when the element is loaded i change its css using jQuery 4. it did the trick for me\n\nif (jQuery(window).width() < 769) { jQuery('object#mysvg-logo')[0].addEventListener('load', function() { jQuery(\"object#mysvg-logo\").css('width','181px'); }, true); }\n\nwidth: 180px;\n\n<script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> <object id=\"mysvg-logo\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" data=\"my svg logo url here\">Your browser does not support SVG</object>\n\nI had a similar issue I think trying to set Sharepoint Icon to SVG and the file did not load properly (while Png did).\n\nSee thread: file-format-can-an-svg-file-be-used-as-a-site-icon-in-sharepoint-online\n\nThe reason for the issue is that the height and width flags are not set in the tag.\n\nFor instance, setting this works\n\nI was able to fix the issue by:\n\nOpen SVG in a text editor (e.g. Notepad)\n\nInclude in the first SVG header code Width=\"80\" Height=\"80\" (perhaps can play with optimizing the size)\n\nSave file and upload. IT WORKS!\n\nSo the first tag of my SVG looks like this\n\n<svg height=\"80\" width=\"80\" id=\"Layer_1\" data-name=\"Layer 1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 114.60458 114.60458\">\n\nOn problems try to open the images first with a program that is capable to read svg-images.\n\nIf that fails, then the svg-image is somehow corrupted.\n\nI had that case and copied the svg-paths in a new svg-image and adjusted all details of the svg-tags.\n\nI never tested the reason that it was not rendering but suppose that some invisible special signs caused the render-error. Getting sometimes files edited on Mac I had this issue in other context already."
