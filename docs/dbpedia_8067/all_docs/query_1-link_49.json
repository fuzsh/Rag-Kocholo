        "text": "Our Official U.S. Flags have been purchased for display at a wide range of locations listed on the National Historic Registry, including Forts, National Parks, Museums, as well as former homes of past U.S. Presidents. Cities, Towns and Villages have used them in their Centenial celebrations. Businesses display our Flags to denote the era of their founding. Families living in historic period homes find them to be the ultimate detail for their residence. Individuals with a special pride in their home State's history appreciate them, too!\n\nShown below are the first twenty six Official Flags of the United States. By law, a star is added to the Flag on the Fourth of July following the admission of a state(s) to the Union. Many people believe the first Official Flag was the \"Betsy Ross\"...13 stars in a circle. But the first documented U.S. Flag was the staggered pattern shown. It is important to note that no U.S. Flag ever becomes obsolete and each Flag offered here is still a legal Flag and may be flown at anytime.\n\nEach Flag below is made of outdoor grade nylon with sewn stripes and appliqued stars of opaque white nylon that are sewn onto the blue canton. They are ready to fly with a sturdy canvas header with two solid brass grommets. These Flags are \"made to order\" so allow 7 to 10 business days to be shipped. Most 3'X5' sizes are in stock and may ship sooner.\n\nClick on the links in the product descriptions for an alternate view of each Flag.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nThirteen Star U.S. Flag, 1777 ~ 1795\n\nThe First Official United States Flag: This 13 star Flag became the Official United States Flag on June 14th, 1777 and is the result of Congressional action that took place on that date. Much evidence exists pointing to Congressman Francis Hopkinson as the person responsible for its design.The only President to serve under this flag was George Washington (1789-1797). This Flag was to last for a period of 18 years, until April 30th, 1795.\n\nEach star and stripe represented a Colony of which there were thirteen, united nearly one year earlier by the Declaration of Independence. The thirteen Colonies are listed below with the date that each ratified the Constitution and became a State.\n\n(1st) Delaware, December 7th, 1787. (2nd) Pennsylvania, December 12th,1787. (3rd) New Jersey, December 18th, 1787. (4th) Georgia, January 2nd, 1788. (5th) Connecticut, January 9th, 1788. (6th) Massachusetts, February 6th, 1788. (7th) Maryland, April 28th, 1788. (8th) South Carolina, May 23rd, 1788. (9th) New Hampshire, June 21st, 1788. (10th) Virginia, June 25th, 1788. (11th) New York, July 25th, 1788. (12th) North Carolina, November 21st, 1789. (13th) Rhode Island, May 29th, 1790.\n\nSelect your 13 Star Flag size here.\n\nFifteen Star U.S. Flag, 1795 ~ 1818\n\nThis 15 star, 15 stripe Flag was authorized by the Flag Act of January 13, 1794, and became the Official United States Flag on May 1st, 1795. Two stripes and two Stars were added for the admission of Vermont (the 14th State on March 4th, 1791) and Kentucky (the 15th State on June 1st, 1792) and was to last for 23 years, until April 12th, 1818. This flag is the only U.S. Flag to have more than 13 stripes.\n\nDuring the bombardment of Fort McHenry on September 13, 1814, Francis Scott Key was inspired by the sight of this Flag flying over the Fort to write the song which became known as \"The Star Spangled Banner\", now our national anthem. The 15 Star Flag is, itself, affectionately known by the same name.\n\nThe five Presidents who served under this flag were; George Washington (1789-1797), John Adams (1797-1801), Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809), James Madison (1809-1817), and James Monroe (1817-1825).\n\nSelect your 15 Star Flag size here.\n\nTwenty Star U.S. Flag, 1818 ~ 1819\n\nThe 1818 Flag of 20 Stars: Realizing that the addition of a new star and new stripe for each new State was impractical, Congress passed the Flag Act of 1818 which returned the Flag design to 13 stripes and specified 20 stars for the 20 states.\n\nThis Flag became the Official United States Flag on April 13th, 1818. Five stars were added for the admission of Tennessee (the 16th State on June 1st, 1796), Ohio (the 17th State on March 1st, 1803), Louisiana (the 18th State on April 30th, 1812), Indiana (the 19th State on December 11th, 1816), and Mississippi (the 20th State on December 10, 1817), and was to last for just one year until July 4th,1819.\n\nThe only President to serve under this flag was James Monroe (1817-1825).\n\nSelect your 20 Star Flag size here."
