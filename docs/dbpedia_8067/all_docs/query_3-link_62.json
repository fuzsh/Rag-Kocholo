        "text": "Being an American is a complicated identity.\n\nIt’s complications manifest differently depending on each American’s particular social location, personal history, and an array of other factors like gender, race, religion, and sexual orientation. But, despite narratives of patriotism spoken and sung, nothing is as simple or straightforward as an “Independence Day Parade” down main street or the singing of “God Bless America” might have some people believe.\n\nAs the Pulitzer Prize winning “1619 Project” by Nikole Hannah-Jones eloquently, and at times painfully, recounts, those Americans of African descent have always struggled with the blatant complication of American identity. And for good reason.\n\nWhite Americans are often quick to speak of the values and history of the United States in uncritical and even glowing terms, referencing idyllic quests for “freedom” (without considering the indigenous genocide that made the newfound “freedom” for a few European colonists possible) or romantic depictions of this nation as a “melting pot” of ethnicities and cultures (without acknowledging the kidnapping and enslavement of African peoples).\n\nThis sort of overly simplistic, yet nearly hegemonic depiction, of “American history” reinforces a narrative about what constitutes “real” patriotic values and who is considered “really American.” In short, the honest answer is indisputably those who are associated with “whiteness.”\n\nHere I’m not merely accounting for phenotype, those external characteristics of one’s skin appearance or other physical features. Instead, I’m talking about both phenotype and ideology. Whiteness operates at lots of levels, some of which are starkly apparent and others are far more subtle and insidious.\n\nLanguage functions in this way. Within the broad context of the United States, the way many people (mostly, but not always, white people) talk about what constitutes “American values” or “American way of life” is code for white normativity. It’s about cultural markers (music, dialect, clothing preferences, physical appearance, etc.) and about societal principles (relationship to space or time, religious views, perception about gender norms, etc.). All of this is to say that something called “race” is also a code word for “otherness,” it is something that happens to, is embodied by, and relates only to non-whites, to people of color.\n\nBut it’s not just all about language, spoken or written. Symbols also function and they function in numerous ways all the time to convey meaning, reinscribe value systems, and communicate principles that shape whole social imaginaries. And one of the most powerful and controversial symbols in the context of the United States is the American Flag.\n\nEarlier this month I took my own version of a “quarantine vacation,” a somewhat circumscribed break from the monotony of working from home, living from home, staying at home that those of us who have the privilege to do any of the above have done for the better part of five months. I took a short road trip, which is not something I generally do, but with long-distance travel made generally impossible, I explored some of the midwest—my adopted home region for almost five years.\n\nAt one point I was up in the northern part of Michigan, a location selected because of its low COVID-19 infection rates (i.e., it wasn’t a current “hot spot”) and because I love the Great Lakes and northern forested landscapes (I grew up in Upstate New York after all). It was nice to have even a small change of scenery, for as much as I love living in the Hyde Park neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, I welcomed the opportunity to spend a little time away from the five-mile radius that had become my entire physical world during the pandemic.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see how, at least in the more “main street” locales, most people kindly observed the mask ordinances of the State of Michigan in public.\n\nI was unpleasantly unsurprised to see so many “Trump/Pence” signs on yards and cars and displayed on boats. This wasn’t surprising for many reasons given the more rural location and the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the area. The pride with which older white men took their morning strolls in bright-red “MAGA” hats or middle-aged white couples docked their boats at the local marina with “Trump 2020” flags sailing in the lack breeze atop their vessels was startling for me. I believed it was one thing for people to privately and almost secretly, for whatever reason, support the current president; it was quite another to do so in such an unabashedly public way.\n\nI have a very difficult time relating to people who (a) approve of the policies, behaviors, views, and agendas of the Trump administration in a private sense and (b) I find it nearly impossible to comprehend how anyone who might secretly harbor such views might proudly display their affection for and affiliation with such an administration. The flags and red hats and bumper stickers flown and worn and pasted all functioned to communicate something—to communicate that they believed what Trump and his surrogates espoused, that they wished to “make America great again,” which only means something remotely positive in the false nostalgia of white Americans.\n\nWhile thinking about all the things that the symbolism of this Trump-branded material elicited in me—how it functioned in a way to communicate a vision of a nation that not only embraced white normativity without question, but insisted on it—I began thinking about other symbols that operate in similar ways in this country. Which brought me to the American Flag and the idolatry of nationalism that has arisen around it in recent years, especially during the rule of the Trump administration.\n\nI have had the opportunity to travel to dozens of countries on many continents around the world. Nearly everywhere I went the citizens and residents of that place took pride in their respective nation and its history and heritage. But few other countries fly their nation’s flag in as ubiquitious and overt manner as one finds in the USA. It can be jarring for a foreign visitor to see American Flags flown not only in front of every elementary school and post office (locations that I find perfectly acceptable) but also printed on cheap T-shirts, worn as socks and bathing suits, made into beach towels, flown on motorcycles, boats, and cars, and so on.\n\nThe “Stars and Stripes” are everywhere in this land, and too many of us have become numb and accustomed to the manifold ways in which this hegemonic symbol has been absurdly used and abused. The irony that the same folks who are so upset about the prospect of a protestor nonviolently demonstrating against injustice could burn a flag are also the ones frequently inclined to apply the symbol to every article of clothing no matter how seemingly inappropriate (is it really more patriotic to use the flag as underwear than it is to peacefully demonstrate by burning it?).\n\nThe questions resurfaced for me: Why all this American Flag waving and wearing? What was the actual purpose? How does it function?\n\nAmong my many travels, the only other nation in which I have seen national flag ubiquity anywhere near that of the United States was in Israel. While many Israelis, like many Americans, will be quick to state that such flag-waving or wearing is a sign of love, respect, and appreciation for one’s country (a sentiment I do not dismiss), I am more concerned about the unexamined role and function of the flags serve.\n\nThe residents of the State of Israel are in no way equal. Israeli citizens have full rights and privileges, while resident Palestinians (who are generally Muslim and Christian) are treated as second-class citizens (at best). An informed discussion about this dynamic took place last week on the New York Times podcast “The Argument,” if you’d like to learn more. But I have also seen this first hand and heard about the disparities from Palestinians and Israeli Jews alike.\n\nMy primary concern here is not with the precarious state of relations in the Middle East, but with the curious parallels between the United States and Israel in terms of their respective flag-obsessed cultures. It occurred to me while in Northern Michigan that perhaps one of the ways the symbol of the American flag functions in the United States is not only as a representation of the flag-holder’s pride in country, but as a subtle signal to “others” about who does and does not belong.\n\nWhites look at the ubiquity of the American flag as a symbol of pride, while those for whom the fullness of American identity has been foreclosed and denied and erased over the centuries see it as a reminder of a racist history of American white supremacy that whites have consistently refused to acknowledge.\n\nIf you were a Native American, acutely aware of the history of genocide and land-stealing on the part of European colonists, what might your reaction be to seeing the symbol of the flag everywhere you turn?\n\nIf you were of African descent, acutely aware of the history of chattel slavery, Jim Crow, and persistent systemic racism, what might your reaction be to seeing the symbol of the flag everywhere you turn?\n\nThese are the sorts of questions I found myself meditating on as I moved in the well-meaning world of a Northern Michigan vacation town surrounded by American flags.\n\nAs a white man, I have the unearned privilege of completely ignoring the realities of others who don’t move through American time and space with such ease and comfort. But as a person who has become somewhat aware of these disparate realities, and continues to learn and re-learn and be challenged by them, I have a responsibility to see, judge, and act in response.\n\nThe extreme ubiquity of the American flag symbol in this country is not merely a sign of patriotism or healthy but critical love of country. It also symbolizes a disturbing nationalism, which is expressed all too clearly in the rhetoric and policies of Donald Trump’s executive leadership. From a Christian perspective, nationalism is simply idolatry, treating a nation-state as if it were a religion or, worse, a false-god.\n\nI love this country very much. I was born here. I am the son of a Marine Corp Officer who served this country admirably. But my love for the United States, like that for my family and friends, is a real love that cares enough to ask tough questions and name uncomfortable truths when necessary. Love rooted in genuine concern and care is a love that challenges and questions, that does not look the other way when the person or nation you love harms and hurts itself and others.\n\nI do not think that the millions of Americans that fly the flag (or wear it as a bathing suit or underwear) are going to stop doing so merely because I think it might be a good idea. But I do hope that if you made it this far in my reflection you might also look at the flag in a new light and see how it functions in multiple ways, including in exclusionary and destructive ways. This is especially challenging for white Americans like me who are socialized to overlook such uncomfortable and painful truths.\n\nIf we can begin to see how some things, even seemingly innocuous things like an American flag, function on many levels including oppressively, then perhaps we can better confront the idolatry of nationalism in our midst."
