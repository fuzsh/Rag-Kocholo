        "text": "Knowing what to look for is the first step in identifying and controlling bed bugs. There are many bugs that look like bed bugs, so an accurate identification is a critical first step to avoid costly treatment for the wrong bug. The types of bugs that look like bed bugs will vary somewhat depending on your region of the country, but photos and descriptions of common look-alikes have been compiled by researchers:\n\nThe following links exit the site\n\nBat Bugs, Bed Bugs and Relatives (Colorado State University)\n\nIs it a Bed Bug, Cockroach or Carpet Beetle (PDF) (1 pp, 63.55 K, About PDF) (New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene)\n\nYour state cooperative extension service office may also be able to help with identification.\n\nAppearance of Bed Bugs (Cimex lectularius L.)\n\nAdult bed bugs, in general, are:\n\nabout the size of an apple seed (5-7 mm or 3/16 - 1/4 inch long);\n\nlong and brown, with a flat, oval-shaped body (if not fed recently);\n\nballoon-like, reddish-brown, and more elongated (if fed recently);\n\na “true bug” (characteristics of true bugs include a beak with three segments; antenna that have four parts; wings that are not used for flying; and short, golden-colored hairs); and\n\nsmelly, with a “musty-sweetish” odor produced through glands on the lower side of the body.\n\nYoung bed bugs (also called nymphs), in general, are:\n\nsmaller, translucent or whitish-yellow in color; and\n\nif not recently fed, can be nearly invisible to the naked eye because of coloring and size.\n\nBed bug eggs, in general, are:\n\ntiny, the size of a pinhead;\n\npearl-white in color; and\n\nmarked by an eye spot if more than five days old.\n\nBed Bug Life Cycle\n\nThe life cycle of a bed bug is shown in the photograph below. During its lifetime, a bed bug will go through the following stages (Starting from the top left, moving counterclockwise):\n\nEggs (1mm).\n\n1st stage nymph (1.5 mm).\n\n2nd stage nymph (2 mm).\n\n3rd stage nymph (2.5 mm).\n\n4th stage nymph (3 mm).\n\n5th stage nymph (4.5 mm).\n\nUnfed adult female.\n\nUnfed adult male."
