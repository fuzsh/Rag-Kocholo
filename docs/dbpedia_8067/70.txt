If one has a design idea one wants to make, usually it can be shown / mocked up as a pixel image, and put together using some basic elements.

For example:

All one should need for that is a portion of a U.S. flag, and the Marine Corps seal — fortunately, both are easily sourced on Wikimedia Commons:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Seal_of_the_United_States_Marine_Corps.svg

Then open or import the files — the Marine Corps seal seems to import fine, but the U.S. Flag has issues and is incompleat, so needs to be opened in Inkscape or some other vector editor and flattened out / fixed.

Once one imports the flag file, delete what is not needed, select what is and scale it appropriately:

If need be, plug in a mouse so as to have a scroll wheel which will allow one to zoom in — do so and delete any unnecessary elements:

Adjust scaling, position and placement until things line up as desired:

Select and delete the stars which are mostly obscured:

Turn off snap to grid and draw a circle to measure how much the outline should be extended to erase portions of the stars:

(roughly a quarter of an inch)

Delete the circle, select the outline and use “Offset Path” do so once for each star which must be adjusted:

0.25 inches to the outside of the path:

Zoom in and select a star which must be edited and the outline by clicking or dragging to select the former, the control-clicking on the latter (it is important that the star have a solid orange line indicating selection, while the outline should have a dashed appearance indicating it is the key object on top):

and choose Boolean | Boolean Subtraction:

Repeat that for each star which needs to be edited.

Select each star in turn and assign a V Carve toolpath — I would suggest a 90 degree endmill to limit how deeply they are cut.

Then select the seal and assign a V Carve toolpath (having grouped this above would likely make this easier) — a 60 degree endmill should preserve the detail better.

which previews well:

but shows one oddity — the stripes on the globe being carved rather than the surrounding area — this is usually caused by a reversed or overlapping path, in this case, the undeleted star.

Newbie here so go easy on me please! lol. I’ve downloaded and ran the above program with the current material dimensions listed for the tutorial (14 3/16 x 10 9/16). How do I duplicate the same thing on a piece of material measuring 19 x 14? Struggling with scaling. Thanks in advance for your help!

First set the Stock size to 19 x 14, then select everything then choose the scale tool:

Set things to 19 inches wide, then center it on the stock area and trim half of 0.235 or so from each side.

You may need to inset the paths if the features get too large to cut with your V endmill.
