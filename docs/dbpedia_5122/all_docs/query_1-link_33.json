        "text": "TOM CLANCY’S SPLINTER CELL CHAOS THEORY GOES GOLD\n\nSpring’s Hottest Game Expected to Hit Store Shelves on March 31!\n\nSan Francisco, CA – March 22, 2005 – Ubisoft, one of the world’s largest video game publishers, announced today that Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory has reached gold master status on all platforms and is expected to hit store shelves on March 31, 2005. One of this Spring’s most talked-about and best-reviewed titles (10/9.5/9.0 – Electronic Gaming Monthly; 9.9 – Official Xbox Magazine; 9.75/9.75 – Game Informer Magazine), Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell® Chaos Theory™ delivers three amazing types of gaming experiences, and stands as one of the biggest videogames ever produced.\n\nTom Clancy’s Splinter Cell® Chaos Theory™ includes a single-player campaign that follows gaming icon Sam Fisher on his latest mission to maintain world peace, a two-player co-op campaign that redefines collaborative gaming, and a completely updated versus multiplayer campaign (that first appeared to critical acclaim in last year’s Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow) and offers gamers complete immersion in modern stealth action and endless hours of replayability.\n\nTom Clancy’s Splinter Cell® Chaos Theory™ carries an “M” (Mature) rating from the ESRB, with a suggested retail price of $49.99. It is scheduled to be available for the Xbox® video game system from Microsoft, PlayStation®2 computer entertainment system, Nintendo GameCube™and PC, as well as the N-Gage platform, published by Gameloft® on March 31, 2005.\n\nAbout Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell® Chaos Theory™ The year is 2008. Citywide blackouts… stock exchange sabotage… electronic hijacking of national defense systems… this is information warfare, which has become the most dangerous threat to global stability. To prevent these attacks, you must infiltrate deep into hostile territory and aggressively collect critical intelligence, closer than ever to enemy soldiers. You are Sam Fisher, the NSA’s most elite black-ops agent. To achieve your mission you will operate undetected, kill at close-range, attack with your combat knife, shoot with the modular SC20K rifle, and use radical suppression techniques such as the inverted neck break. Work alone, or enjoy the thrill of cooperative multiplayer infiltration missions, where teamwork is the ultimate weapon.\n\nAs the enemy evolves, so must you."
