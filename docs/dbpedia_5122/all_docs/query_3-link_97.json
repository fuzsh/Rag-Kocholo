        "text": "May 26, 2017\n\nI've enjoyed all of the books in the Splinter Cell series, including this one.\n\nThis volume either was written a little differently, however, or tied deeper into the games than the other volumes because it feels like we pick up in the middle of the story. Apparently Sam has killed his boss, Lambert, and is on the run as a traitor with the rest of Third Echelon hunting him down. The murder itself, however, happens \"off-camera.\"\n\nAs you might suspect, we later find out it's part of a deep plan to flush out some terrorists and spies within the group, but it looks like Fisher really did kill Lambert, who sacrificed himself for the great good. I was expecting Lambert to turn up alive at the end, showing it was a plan, but he never did so we are led to believe Sam did in fact kill Lambert. He may turn up in a later volume I suppose. I'm not sure if the games fleshed this part of the story out, or we are just supposed to put it together on our own. Seems like a pretty major event to happen \"off-camera\" to me.\n\nOverall this has been a really good series, and if you enjoy spy novels that are deep but not so deep they become boring you should check this series out.\n\nAugust 28, 2022\n\nTom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Conviction By David Michaels, is a video game tie-in novel based Ubisoft’s Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell video game franchise.\n\nSet two years before the main story of Splinter Cell: Conviction. The story covers some of Sam Fisher’s time on the run between Double Agent and Conviction.\n\nAfter saving America from the JSA terror group. The famous Splinter Cell Agent Sam Fisher is now considered a rouge agent by his own government. Living a life on the run Sam Fisher is now in the mercenary game and is doing dirty work all the while secretly working with his long time friend NSA agent Anna Grímsdóttir. To uncover rouge elements within Third Echelon. Meanwhile he is being ruthlessly hunted by a new team of Third Echelon Sprinter cell agents who have been tasked to eliminate him. All the while trying to untangle a conspiracy involving the a high-ranking Third Echelon official and cache stolen high tech weapons.\n\nConviction is a book based on a video game, the fact it carries the Tom Clancy name helps but doesn't give it a free pass. The book itself it well written if a bit cliche and predictable. But this book was created for entertainment, not to teach or impart knowledge, it is totally a guilty pleasure. And there is nothing wrong with that in the least. It feels a bit more fast paced than the previous Splinter Cell books and you must suspends a good deal of disbelief in order to enjoy it. But if you can do that what you get is a good read.\n\nThis is a Same Fisher you will recognize but he has changed and you can see it in the little bit of character development present in the book. The story is a bit far fetched but its easy enough to suspend reality and just enjoy. If you are a Splinter Cell fan already its worth picking up, if you are on the fence, or just a fan of military non fiction its worth a look through. If you've read any of the previous novels and enjoyed them you won't be disappointed with this iteration.\n\nOctober 7, 2013\n\nSam Fisher is a splinter cell. One of the deadliest men in the world. He travels the world doing peoples dirty work for them. In this book Sam is mostly in France and Luxembourg. At the beginning of the book his friend in France makes him fake passports and fake credit cards that Sam had stole from men he has taken out.\n\nWhile Sam is in Luxembourg there is third echelon training activities and they are hunting down Sam.\n\nAugust 23, 2018\n\nThe ending felt a bit anticlimactic, but this was largely an intense page turner. Maintaining my comparison of Splinter Cell novels with Rainbow Six, this was better in terms of plot, subplot, villains, and characters. This felt more like a spy novel than it's predecessor given the circumstances surrounding Fisher at this point in time.\n\nMarch 10, 2011\n\nI love this book. This book is so cool. It is so full of action and suspense. I love how Colonel Irving Lambert tells Sam Fisher that his daughter Sarah is dead. But, what Sam doesn’t know is that Lambert is a person working undercover for the Russian government. Also, Lambert tells Sarah that Sam is dead so now they are both looking for each other. When Sam finds out that Sarah is alive and Lambert was lying to him he went after Lambert and tried looking for her even harder.\n\nThe characters in this book are very good. Sam fisher is a Third Echelon Assassin known as the “Splinter Cell.” Third Echelon is a group that is the second Black Ops but is better. He is probably the deadliest man in the world. Some say he is the reason the U.S. is pulled together as a country.\n\nIrving Lambert- The Third Echelon Coordinator. He is the source between field agents, computer analysts, and hackers. He is an undercover Russian trying to kill Sam Fisher. He has been working with Sam for 19 years and never got a chance to kill him.\n\nVernon Wilkes Jr.- Field runner. He is in charge of coordinating transportation and equipment for all of the field agents. He is working for Lambert, but is not aware that Lambert is working undercover.\n\nAnna Grimsdottir- Anna is the communications lead. She is the lead of a small team that is in charge of technological data to help the field operative.\n\nI love the way Tom Clancy writes books. Almost all of his books are full of action and suspense. He is the author of the Splinter Cell series, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six series, and many more. He is so good at writing books. He is the kind of author that is a future type of guy. He likes to write books about types of FBI type things in the future. The style of Tom Clancy is so creative. The way he can come up with names that might be used in the future for the FBI like Third Echelon.\n\nJanuary 26, 2010\n\nThe book is about third ex-third elecheon Sam fisher is hunted down for killing his freind lambert. now the worlds hero becomes a public enemy. relying on only his wits, and his only third elecheon friend Grimsdottir gives him his weapons without anybody knowing. then when a terrorist threat occurs, he has to team up with therookies that were sent to kill him are know on his team. then one of the rookies betray the whole team and tries to kill them. then sam saves all of them plus he survives.\n\ni can connect this book to the game Batman Arkham asylum. because batman can takedown enemies in the game without others knowing and that is basically what splinter cell is.\n\ni would give this book 5 stars because its outstanding. itwas mind blowing and it was action packed to the very end. i would want people who like books like this book read the whole series.\n\nJuly 16, 2020\n\nThis book turn the series around, and just in time I was about done with the series. What made this book better was the spy element added into this story plus the plot was laid out in a suspenseful manner. It is too bad that now the whole family plot line of the series that used to give Sam a more human element is guy one. Now it's just gadgets, bad guys, and action.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nDecember 6, 2009\n\nThis was a great book! It was action packed and kept me on the edge of my seat. I can guaruntee if you are a Splinter Cell fan, this will blow your mind. I could'nt stop reading; David Michaels has done it again.\n\nRead\n\nDecember 17, 2009\n\nSam Fisher is an ex black-ops agent being prosude by his own government for unknown reasons. The Presedent was even in the dark of his missions but now he hs to find out who and why he was set up and still stay alive at the same time.\n\nFebruary 8, 2024\n\nI'm so lost in this one, It's hard to get invested in the plot because all you really know is that Fisher is being chased because of the fallout from the events of Double Agent. Beyond that I have no idea what his goals are, who all the people he's talking to are, what's going on beyond that.\n\nAnd so much of the story so far is just describing Sam driving...he turned left onto this street and drove some more on this other street while other cars were driving and different cars were chasing him...it's so dry an uninteresting. In real life I cannot focus on driving stories, if you're telling me a story about driving I hear a high pitch hum until you finish telling me about driving, a lot of this book has been a high pitch hum.\n\nOn the plus side I think they got the character right. On the negative side Fisher is the only interesting character in the whole book. There's never really a bonafide antagonist and any villain is barely in the story at all. This story structure works a lot better as a video game than a book.\n\nMaybe I'm not a fan of the genre as much as I am a fan of the games.\n\nNovember 11, 2017\n\nI picked this up a good 5+ years ago but never finished it. Despite just *adoring* the splinter cell series of pc games I found this unreadable. I \"finished\" the book today, the product of skim reading a few pages at a time while in between rounds of online shooters.\n\nIn a recent piece at \"The Week,\" Matthew Walther describes the Dan Brown style of writing as something akin to that of a bad tour book & wikipedia entries. Unfortunately this \"novel\" falls under the same category. The scenes are either paint by number sight-seeing or boring action pieces with an even more boring \"wiki\" type description of various bits of gear, equipment, food, or location. Even worse, the titular character is a barely human automaton. Perhaps it is hard to translate the character voiced by Michael Ironsides' distinctive growl to a work of fiction but that's a sorry excuse for the general unreadable mess this pile of pages is.\n\nOctober 23, 2019\n\nSplinter Cell: Conviction is a book based on a game. It is also the fifth (I think) book in this series. Author David Michaels has written a story of non-stop action!\n\nAside from the action, this book has some great locations, from Luxembourg to Siberia, with some decent descriptions. There are also some twists and turns that should keep you guessing a little bit.\n\nOn the negative side, the character did not get as much description as the scenery. Perhaps this is because I have not read the previous stories, or played the game. Another small peave, the book does not go into why the main character is on the run from his own people. Note: Sam Fisher is apparently one of the top government/spy killers in the world. You will be introduced to plenty of soon to be dead characters thanks to Sam, but he is a good guy!\n\nIf you enjoy a super-fast action thriller (I do) this is a great read. Just don't expect much else!\n\nAugust 22, 2021\n\nBeing the first Splinter Cell book to share a name with one of the games, you may expect this to be a novelization. It isn’t, and it’s better for it.\n\nConviction is an alternative sequel to Double Agent, and begins with Sam on the run from Third Echelon, just as he is in the game. But the novel’s relation to the game is only as deep as some minor thematic parallels. The cover is misleading; despite the presence of the game’s Washington DC architecture, Fisher never leaves Europe in this one.\n\nThis is likely the best book in the series; the focus on the sneaky, methodical bits of being on the run makes it a better read than the generic military tales of the previous books.\n\nOctober 15, 2023\n\nHigh 3 for now. I'm still not sold by the main narrative itself, though I might reconsider given that Endgame seems to be a companion novel to this. The narrative choice is also questionable to me, but it's still okay. The action is there, albeit of the ubermensch / superman variety so again not my cup of tea.\n\nApril 17, 2020\n\nFun story, continuing from Sam's perspective. Endgame is a neat write told from the chasing team's perspective. I enjoyed both; they're not particularly brain-challenging, but was cool hearing about the backstory of Gottweiler and Horatio. Thanks David Michaels.\n\nApril 28, 2022\n\nEnjoyed reading \"Splinter Cell.\" Lots of action and great mental imagery. Really enjoyable.\n\nJanuary 24, 2015\n\nI found this book to be fairly mediocre. This is really a \"guilty pleasure\" sort of novel, but not all of those are all that bad. At least, not as bad as this one. It definitely makes the reasonable assumption that the reader has played the Splinter Cell games, and I would have been much less confused if I had. Because of this assumption, much of what happened prior to the novel is unexplained, and that includes why the main character has been declared a traitor and is being hunted by his own agency. Again, that was covered in the games, but that still seems like important information. Most of the book is a dull mess, with the protagonist, Sam Fisher, going all over Europe in search of... something? It is unclear what information he wants until a good deal through the novel,when he hd it. It does improve a lot towards the end, once Fisher gets a team and a clear objective,but it really is too little,too late. Another problem is the characters. While some of the team hunting him are interesting, Fisher is a generic grizzled American badass with no real backstory, life, or character depth. The villain also is a disappointment, with almost no dialogue, a ridiculous list of accomplishments and occupations, and a motive that just falls flat. Splinter Cell books have many dull villains, but the Islamic terrorist with North Korean backing from Fallout was better than this. To conclude, if you want to kill time in the airport with a video game adaptation, you're better off with Halo or Ghost Recon.\n\nFebruary 7, 2012\n\nBeing a gamer myself, reading this book was just as a thrill as playing it. The plot was relatively similar to each version but i felt there could be more poetic phrases that could be added in the novel. Yes this is a book based off of a game and maybe it was the author's choice to right it like this, but I wanted the book to feel different. I wanted it too feel more like real life than a video game. Also parts almost seemed technical and boring. (feeling like I'm reading a video game play-through a bit) That could just be me though.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I absolutely love the book. It was filled with action, suspense, and even plot twists that have just as powerful of an effect as other books I read. Not having played the game in over a year, the memories of Sam, Grim, and Sarah all flood back. It was a nice experience rediscovering these characters through words. The interaction between characters were always full of suspense even if they were friendly towards each other.\n\nSo yeah. Tom Clancy fans should defiantly read this! People interested in stealthy spy type books or reads should defiantly take a look at this. Some gamers regardless of experience in this specific game should take a look also.\n\nCurrently reading\n\nSeptember 28, 2010\n\nto start off once you see that david michaels wrote this book it means that you are in for some \"on-the-edge-of-your-seat action and suspense\". the biggest problem with writting a book that was made into a ideo game is the fact that you cant use the storyline from the game itself, becvause itll spoil what happens in the game for the people who have not played it yet. another reason is that if you follow the stroyline of the video game itself then you will lose the intrest of the people who have already played the game...and they will end up knowing whats going to happen next in the book, which defeats the whole point of reading it. overall, david michaels did a very good job for creating a completely new storyline. and im not at all suprised that he did since the book ghost recon(based on the video game also) came out really good. all i have to say is that if youre the kind of person that likes action and suspense novels you will be srewing yourself if you dont read this book.....................I mean it you will.\n\nJanuary 3, 2011\n\nI imagine it didn't help that this book is actually part of a series -- the tail end of a multi-book series. I was able to follow it OK despite that, but I wouldn't recommend reading this book first. Clancy fans will probably enjoy it. Personally, I thought it read like a video game. Souped-up hero (Sam Fisher)goes on assignment, picks up needed equipment, avoids various bad guys and the members of the Third Echelon (his former teammates essentially), he completes his mission with the help of a Spliter Cell member/manager who knows of his innocence (well, his motives) involving a murder. Then, on to the next assignment. All the while, Fisher is trying to piece together the clues for an overall conspiracy. The plot is rather thin, but the equipment detail is interesting and there are a couple of laugh out loud moments. Still, it wasn't my cup of tea.\n\nSeptember 10, 2010\n\nThe plot was even more convoluted than usual. I like Tom Clancy's books because after a couple you feel like you know most of the characters. This book had too many new or temporary characters and (it's a man thing) using last names makes it hard to keep them straight. Thank goodness for Fisher & Grim!\n\nThe next book in the series brought out the significance of the characters introduced in this book. Must continue to the very end of this series. Wish it could go on longer.\n\nJuly 31, 2011\n\nA great read although it can be boring at times. Most of the time it is fast paced and the story is fantastic. From what I've heard Operation Barracuda is the best of the books. I plan on reading it next. This book is great, I can't believe all the novels are based on a simple video game. Tom Clancy did NOT write this book. David Michaels does all of the video game and idea adaptions for Tom CLancy.\n\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\nSplinter Cell: Conviction, authored by David Michaels, is NOT a read for those who prefer that each story they read be of the \"stand-alone\" style, even when part of a larger series of books about the same character. It was difficult to gain much of an appreciation for the main character, Sam Fisher, in this novel. The style of writing would have benefited from more background information about Sam Fisher, as well as the agency from which he is made to appear as a rogue.\n\nMay 15, 2012\n\nI gave this book 5 stars because it had a lot of action and shooting. The moment i picked this book up i loved it i have played one of his games so i kind of expected it to be good but the book was really good too. It has alot of spy gagets in it and i kind of know about them so i understood it better. I also liked it because it keept me into it until the end.\n\nJanuary 27, 2013\n\nThis is actually the \"prequel\" to the game in my opinion. I read this before the game I played the game and it made it that much more of an experience. Sam on the run, the crosshairs on him at every turn. It never got old. This series never proves to fail. if you get a chance read the sequel to this one 'Splinter Cell: Checkmate' to see the otherside, the people chasing Fisher.\n\nMarch 1, 2014\n\nI thought the book was a good read. It wasn't the best of the Splinter Cell novels. I did like that it shows Sam Fisher on the run and what he does and how he does it. The one thing that would have been nice to know after reading it, would be about Lambert Situation in the book. If your a fan of the Splinter Cell serious I would recommend the book.\n\nJanuary 18, 2021\n\nWhen I first started to read this book I was into it. I'm a big splinter cell fan and this book was like a Jason Bourne splinter cell hybrid and it starts off pretty cool. But there was so much build up to the last mission and it fell flat and its not terrible but didn't hit a home run with me still enjoyed it but it was ok."
