        "text": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell for mobile phones is a stealth based platform game played from a two dimensional side view without scrolling. The game consists of six linear missions where the player has to guide the protagonist Sam Fisher from start to exit, while fulfilling some objectives (meet a person, steal an item, hack a computer etc.) On the way he will come across various guards that he has to either sneak across or take down. Enemies can be shot or knocked out with a stealth attack. It is also possible to take out a guard by jumping down on it. Similar to other stealth games there is an icon that shows how dark Sam's current location is. In addition to guards there are also mines, lasers and watch dogs to look out for. At the end of a mission the player gets a rating based on number of deaths, guards killed and alarms triggered."
