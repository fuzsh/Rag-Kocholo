        "text": "What an awful bore! I would have been happier if Fisher, the main character was assassinated in the second chapter. I would not have wasted my time with such repetitive, endless, unbelievable chases and near death exploits. It does not deserve one star. I miss the original Tom Clancy.\n\nThis book was better than the Endgame counterpart, as Sam's logic is much more interesting to follow. The book has such rich environments, and made me crave a visit to the locations as they feel so nostalgic after reading through the books again! The reasoning of Sam is so consistent, he feels more real than the typical world of spies. It's not all the glitz of the spook world that is usually portrayed, it feels real, imperfect and still immersive. I'm so glad it's not told in the first person as in some of the other Splinter Cell series, this feels more refined for it."
