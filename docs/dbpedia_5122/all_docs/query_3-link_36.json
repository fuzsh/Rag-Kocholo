        "text": "It feels like the Splinter Cell remake has been on its way for a decent while now, which isn't helped by the fact it's been over two years since we heard anything official about the game. From what we've seen so far, the team behind the remake appears to be aiming to rebuild the stealth game for an all-new audience without straying too far from the source material. But, as we've said, it's been a while since we've had an update on its progress.\n\nDespite this evident lack of updates, it's still easy to see why the Splinter Cell remake is one of the most anticipated upcoming games on the horizon, given just how groundbreaking the original game was when it was released in 2002. Arguably, it paved the way for the third-person stealth games that followed, and we expect the remake to offer up this classic experience but retooled for a more modern experience.\n\nHere's everything we know about the Splinter Cell remake so far, including a look at the initial announcement and any news that has come out since. As more is revealed in the future, this page will be updated.\n\nSplinter Cell remake: cut to the chase\n\nWhat is it? A remake of 2002's Splinter Cell\n\nWhen does it come out? TBC\n\nWhat can I play it on? TBC\n\nWho makes it? Ubisoft\n\nSplinter Cell remake trailer\n\nUbisoft released a video announcing the Splinter Cell remake in December 2021. In addition to the announcement, the video also delves into the history of the Splinter Cell series and how it changed the identity of Ubisoft, taking the Toronto-based studio from working on Rayman, a bright and colorful platformer, and thrusting it into the AAA lifestyle.\n\nUbisoft hasn't released any more Splinter Cell remake trailers as of yet, but you can find more deep dives into the classic stealth series on Ubisoft's official YouTube channel.\n\nSplinter Cell remake story and setting\n\nWe know that the Splinter Cell remake will revisit the world and story from the first game released in 2002.\n\nThe original plot starts with two undercover US operatives that go missing in Georgia, leading to black ops agent Sam Fisher being sent in to investigate. As Sam searches for the missing agents, he uncovers a larger plot surrounding a corrupt government and nuclear missiles.\n\nIt's unclear how much of this plot will remain in the Splinter Cell remake, however, as Ubisoft confirmed in a (now deleted) job listing from September 2022 (via Tech4Gamers) that it is \"rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience\".\n\n\"We want to keep the spirit and themes of the original game while exploring our characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable,\" the listing stated. So, while producer Matt West has previously established Ubisoft wants to ensure the \"spirit of the early games remains intact,\" expect a few updates.\n\nSplinter Cell remake gameplay\n\nIn the announcement blog post, producer Matt West revealed that the Splinter Cell remake is being built from the ground up, so players can expect visual and design updates. West also confirmed, contrary to rumor, the remake will be linear and not feature an open world. At present, further details haven't been shared on Splinter Cell remake's gameplay.\n\nHowever, as this is a remake of the original title, we can expect that the hallmarks that made Splinter Cell so iconic will be present here. Stealth was always the operative goal in this series; using the environment around you, the lighting, and flexible movement was preferable rather than brute forcing your way through obstacles.\n\nSplinter Cell remake news\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake is being built on Ubisoft's Snowdrop engine\n\nUbisoft has confirmed the Splinter Cell remake is being developed on its Snowdrop engine, which is also being used for its upcoming Star Wars game and was used for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.\n\nYou Might Also Like..."
