Like the first game it is a stealth based platformer played from a side view. The player takes control of Sam Fisher who has to infiltrate a deserted ex-Soviet military bases which has become active again and find out what is going on.\n\nThe game consists of six linear levels which are finished when the exit is reached. Guards can be sneaked past or be taken out by firing, strangling or jumping onto them. It is also possible to hold a guard hostage. In addition to the regular gun the player also gets access to flash grenades and a sniper rifle. Next to the guards there are also mines, security cameras, laser sensors and turrets to watch out for."
