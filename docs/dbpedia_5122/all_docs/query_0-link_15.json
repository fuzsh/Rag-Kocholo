        "text": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction is the mobile version of the console game with the same name and is one of two mobile versions. While the version released for feature phones is a 2D scrolling platform game this version is in full 3D and features gameplay that is more similar to the console version. It is a cover based third person shooter with stealth elements and like with the console version it is more combat oriented than previous Splinter Cell games. The game follows the story of the console version and contains the same settings although the level design of each location is different. There are eleven missions in total which includes an exclusive level that is set on the banks of the Potomac River.\n\nIn each level there are numerous enemies that the player has to fight or sneak past. The player gets access to several weapons (pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, grenades etc.) and like in the past it is also possible to sneak up and grab enemies. The game also features the Mark & Execute feature from the console version which allows the player to take out several enemies in one attack. Other ways to take out enemies include jumping onto them or pulling them off a ledge. On some occasions there are also quick time events where the player has to press on screen buttons in the right order. Gadgets to use include the convex mirror for peeking through doors, the sonic goggles for seeing enemies in the dark and the EMP backpack for disabling electrical devices."
