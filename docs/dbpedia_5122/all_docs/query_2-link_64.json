        "text": "Hi! Video games are a huge industry. Even during the pandemic, it was one of the fastest growing digital markets in the digital environment, and by the end of 2023, its active growth continued. We have already talked about the games of our childhood — 8-bit masterpieces, the era of Flash games. This time I propose to plunge into the history of mobile games, recall the “Snake” and “Labyrinth”, projects for iOS and Android, multiplayer games. As always: write in the comments, complete the article! Moreover, this topic cannot be disclosed in one publication — it is worthy of writing a couple of books.\n\nFrom the “Snake” to the “Prince of Persia”\n\nNokia has been developing mobile radio technology for commercial and military purposes since the 1960s. She worked with one of the first cellular standards for car radiotelephones — ARP: launched in 1971, the network covered the entire territory of Finland by 1978. Thus, the important role of this organization in the global phone market was predetermined. But something else is important to us: in 1997, Nokia introduced the 6110 phone, which had the iconic Snake game. It was one of the first mobile video games. She became a kind of Nokia symbol, showed the possibility of using mobile phones for entertainment.\n\nWas the “snake” the first? In fact, the first one was… “Tetris”. It could be played on a huge MT2000 handset from the Danish manufacturer Hagenuk.\n\nUnlike Nokia, this device has not been widely distributed. And the Finnish company began to improve the graphics from model to model and add new games. Nokia 3210 — already carried three games on board: “Snake”, “Memory” and “Rotation”. Two more could be started with the help of tricks connected to a computer. The bulletproof 3310 could boast of four already installed games: Snake II, Pairs II, Space Impact and Bantumi. Who had exactly this model — did you kill hours to exterminate spaceships and monsters?\n\nIn 2000, the first gadget appeared, which receives the Smartphone designation in advertising, is the Ericsson R380s. But there was only one game here: Reversi.\n\nIn 2001, Siemens launched the 45-series phones, including the S45 and M45. Among the games that went on at the start was “Labyrinth”. Then this game was almost a shooter like Doom, but on the phone.\n\nMost of the games were originally developed for arcade machines and PCs. This applies not only to Tetris, but also to Snakes — it was a variation of the arcade arcade video game released in 1976. Space Impact is suspiciously similar to 1978’s Space Invaders. In 2002, Nokia decided to go further and released its first Java — based phone, the Nokia 3410. In addition to Snake II, Space Impact, Bumper, Bertoni, other games could also be installed here. For example, variations of tic-tac-toe, Pac-Man, Pinball, all sorts of “Smiley City”, “The Power of Love” and “Monsters of War”, variations of Gravity Defied, thousands of them. Even Prince of Persia could be played on a 96 by 95 pixel display.\n\nJava combined with the WEP protocol for wireless network access, which was developed by Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia, opened up a huge world of mobile games. Someone richer bought the game, downloaded it to their phone, and then distributed it to classmates via an IR port.\n\nIn 2003, Nokia again, as one of the trendsetters of mobile fashion at that time, introduced a very controversial gadget that looked more like a game console than a phone. It was a Nokia N-GAGE. First- and third-person shooters like Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory and Tomb Raider, exclusive Asphalt races, strategies like Warhammer 40,000 — this is no longer a “Snake”. Although… the Snakes game was here too.\n\nOver time, the capabilities of mobile phones expanded, screens became better (and more colorful), and the amount of available memory increased. This made it possible to create increasingly heavy, beautiful and complex games… and then iOS and Android smartphones appeared.\n\nApple and Android\n\nLong before the first iPhones and Android gadgets, there were many smartphones on sale. However, it was Steve Jobs who thought of making a niche device so simple and popular that all categories of target audiences began to use it. On July 10, 2008, the App Store was launched — along with the iPhone 3G. At first, it contained more than 500 applications, in less than a year and a half this figure has grown to 100,000, and now there are more than two million of them. And the first game on the iPhone after the launch of the App Store was “Texas Hold’em”. This game showed the capabilities of a set of development tools for the platform. The main advantage of the Apple store was that many developers from all over the world could make applications for it.\n\nThe best games on iOS today are considered not so long ago as historical data: the beginning of the game in 2014. Then, according to one video game journalist, he looked like this:\n\nGT 2 Racing\n\nDead Trigger\n\nFIFA 14\n\nShadowgun\n\nAsphalt 8\n\nThe Blitz Brigade\n\nCommando Day\n\nDungeon Hunter 4\n\nRunning through the temple\n\nAngry Birds\n\nThe development of the game Cut the Rope for iOS originally by the Russian studio Zeptolab in 2010 made this studio famous all over the world. The casual game has won numerous awards, including the Apple Design Award, IGN Game of the Year and BAFTA, and over seven years, different versions of the game have been downloaded 700 million times.\n\nZeptolab has also released King of Thieves, Downhill Smash and a number of other games. It is worth noting that the twin brothers Efim and Semyon Voynov have been making games since they were 10 years old.\n\nOne of the games that appeared in the iOS app store in 2014 was Red Bull. Later it was released for Android.\n\nInitially, the story about the red ball was made by a developer from Saratov, Evgeny Fedoseev, on Adobe Flash in 2009. And in 2017, he and his brother Alexander opened the video game studio Yohoho Games. There are 10 people working in the studio now.\n\nJust 3 months after the launch of the first iPhone, an iOS competitor appeared — the Android operating system. The first gadget with this OS was HTC Dream, also known as T-Mobile G1. Google approached the launch set of applications differently: it held the Android Developer Challenge technology competition.\n\nThe peak in the number of applications per hour occurred on April 17, 2008 (long before the launch of the operating system itself) — 170 applications per hour. A total of 1,788 applications were submitted for the competition. The 50 best works announced on May 5 of that year received $25,000 each for further development. In the final, 10 teams received $275,000 each, and 10 more teams received $100,000 each.\n\nVersion 100 on Android in 2014:\n\nHearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft\n\nValiant Hearts: The Great War\n\nMonument Valley\n\nWorld of Tanks: Blitz\n\nBanner Saga\n\nModern Combat 5\n\nMonument Valley — Forgotten Shores\n\nGodfire: Rise of Prometheus\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\n\nKingdom Rush Origins\n\nThe ability to use the Unity and Unreal Engine game engines allows developers to quickly create new projects, copy and merge computer games. For example, on the Unreal Engine, games such as:\n\nChrono Odyssey\n\nThe mission has evolved\n\nNight Crows\n\nAnd the more interesting is the fact that the first game on Unreal Engine 4 was… a clone of Flappy Bird.\n\nIf I were working with an Android game created by Russian developers, it would be possible to identify many projects in which someone is working:\n\nConfrontation 2\n\nMarx Street\n\nShadow Fight 4: Arena\n\nCut the rope\n\nThe last day on Earth: Survival\n\nSince 2008, the Russian company Playrix has been developing games for both Android and iOS. It all started with Fishdom, a casual three–in-a-row game. Then there were games about agriculture, urban planning and other projects to kill time as efficiently as possible. As of 2022, about 3,000 people worked at Playrix.\n\nIn Gardenscapes, where it is necessary to help the butler Austin restore the family garden, in 2019, Russians spent the most time — 46 minutes a day.\n\nAnd in February 2021, in the global ranking of mobile game developers in terms of annual revenue (according to App Annie), Playrix took third place, overtaking Tencent and NetEase.\n\nAccording to the same App Annie agency, at the beginning of 2021, the Mytona studio, which employs about 1,000 people, was among the 30 successful publishers in the EMEA region. The headquarters is now located in New Zealand.\n\nAmong the games developed by the studio are Ravenhill: Hidden Mystery, Cooking Diary: Tasty Hills, “Notes of the Seeker: Secrets of Darkwood”.\n\nWe need more internet!\n\nIt’s one thing to download the game and then receive updates and ads in this application. And multiplayer video games, including those in the Battle Royal genre, have become a completely new round for smartphones. Although the history of multiplayer has much deeper roots — and begins in the days of mobile phones with screens in several lines. Finnish developer Lasse Seppianen (whom you may know from the games Remedy and Alan Wake) in 1999 made SubHunter for Nokia 7710, which at that time was still only an emulator on a PC. At that time, there were already WAP games at the level of “Naval Combat” and “Correspondence Chess”, and other SMS games. But we even got acquainted by SMS…\n\nIn SubHunter, submarines fought against each other, on the one hand, and destroyers on the other. And here, too, the players exchanged moves without “live” gameplay. In 2000, this game won the prize for the best entertainment resource at the Best of WAP competition organized by Nokia.\n\nWAP times are also important for the reason that the doors to the world of video game development opened for mere mortals, and not for large studios with large budgets that worked, for example, on projects for the Sony PlayStation 2 released in 2000.\n\nIn 2001, BEELINE launched the championship (with prizes) for the WAP game “Bee visiting Santa Claus”, developed by Nikita studio. In 2004, the studio company was awarded the title of the best partner of JSC VimpelCom in the nomination “Interactive services”.\n\nIt was this studio that in the late 1980s began the development of the game Perestroika, which I mentioned in this article. In addition, this Russian studio developed the space simulator “Parkane: Chronicle of the Empire” and “Dom 3”, and in 1992–1997, the studio’s games were installed in 3,000 schools and kindergartens in Scandinavia.\n\nThere were more and more WAP games, and it was profitable for mobile operators to encourage customers to choose WAP phones and use more and more traffic. Many games had an internal rating, sometimes the best players could count on prizes.\n\nThe next stage was the transition to web technologies. After all, games may not be a separate application, but simply open in a browser — this will simplify development and increase the number of available games.\n\nAnd the advent of smartphones, in fact, equated the development of PC games with games for mobile devices: thus, studios were able to create one game and then port it to different platforms instead of developing a game from scratch for each console, for PCs, handhelds or other gadgets.\n\nThe most popular multiplayer video games for smartphones now include PUBL, World of Tanks, Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans, Dota Underlords, FIFA and Fortnite. Most of them have versions on multiple platforms at the same time — for example, PC and Android. Sometimes the developers even bothered and made Lite versions, like Tencent with PUBG in 2018: instead of 100 people, 40 so that the game would run on budget smartphones.\n\nAnd here everything is still going evolutionarily. Internet penetration is getting deeper, RAM is getting bigger, and processors are getting more powerful. Screens whose diagonal used to be laughed at have long been the norm.\n\nAnd what games do you play on your smartphone? Or do you want to highlight some game from the times of phones with a screen in a couple of lines and WAP? Write in the comments!"
