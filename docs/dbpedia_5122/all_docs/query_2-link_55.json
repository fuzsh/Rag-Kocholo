        "text": "angry birds of course...lol. but now.....words with friends. available as of NOW!!! i had to find it online on my pc and send it to the phone. for some reason my market app nor appbrain will find it in a search?\n\nI guess I'm pretty dull when it comes to games. In addition to the 'obigatory' Angry Birds, I have:\n\nTrivial Droid\n\nWords with Friends\n\nOmok\n\nI'm still sort of wary about loadiing too many apps...just not used to having so much space on a phone!\n\ni can't get anything from gameloft to install (wanted to check out the shrek racing game)??? do you know if these hd games won't run on the incredible?\n\nI have a friend that has a Incredible and Evo and most HD games will not open correctly and run on these devices, I am not sure if the software or hardware causing this but they run perfectly on my Droid X.. From what I was told this may be a issue with the Snap Dragon processor performance issue because until recently N.O.V.A. was released specifically for a SnapDragon processor devices.\n\nbummer. they look like great games. when i go to the site, the inc is an option for \"type of device\" but then when i select it and put in my phone number, it just doesn't continue on to the next step in the process. oh well.\n\nThe games are nice but they really need to work on the sites configurations because they are missing money running things as they do now."
