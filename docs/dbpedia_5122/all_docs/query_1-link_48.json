But I thought I'd make it now given the news that the old 360 Marketplace is being shut down.\n\nIn April or so, there was a chunk of OG Xbox games that vanished from the Xbox store at about the same time. Unlike the wave in February, there was no announcement that these games would be delisted. Games that vanished at this time include:\n\nArmed and Dangerous\n\nGrabbed by the Ghoulies\n\nIndiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb\n\nSphinx and the Cursed Mummy\n\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell\n\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow\n\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent (although the 360 version is still available)\n\nUnreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict\n\nWhat's really bizarre about this is that the Splinter Cell games were supposed to be on sale the week they disappeared from the Xbox store, and that the third game in the series, Chaos Theory, is still available for sale. So some people have been wondering if this was mistaken. OscarK , do you know anything about this?\n\nTo me, this is actually more worrying than the news that the 360 store is being shut down, as these games were all available on the new Xbox store and there was absolutely no warning that they would be taken down.\n\nI've been meaning to make a thread about this for a while now, but never got around to it.

If there were a rights issue, I can't imagine why Chaos Theory would stay up but not the first two.\n\nIn any event, there should always be a heads up whenever a delisting is about to happen like this. Real shame there wasn't one in this instance.\n\nChaos Theory remaining up definitely makes me think 1 and 2 being taken down was a mistake.

Real shame there wasn't one in this instance.\n\nI agree. But it still hasn't been fixed four months later. I'm wondering if something on the back end got triggered accidentally.\n\nBut there should always be a heads up (I propose 90 days) when games or content will be delisted. Digital stores should even have a filter you can click to sort by this. It'd be nice to see the FTC or the EU get on this.\n\nI agree. But it still hasn't been fixed four months later.

Digital stores should even have a filter you can click to sort by this. It'd be nice to see the FTC or the EU get on this.\n\nYes, there absolutely needs to be more action from the FTC on games preservation. VGHF and other organizations are working hard to lobby them to allow libraries and other public institutions to copy and distribute out of print games, but imposing rules about delisting games from digital marketplaces would be welcome (as you said, a 90 days heads up).\n\nWith all these surprise delisting, I think I might bite the bullet and grab a few BC games in wishlist, even though they're not on sale. Otogi 1, Otogi 2, Gunvalkyrie, etc\n\nHonestly, it's not a bad idea. I've started picking up BC 360 games I like when they go on sale. But a lot of these OG Xbox games never go on sale so it might be worth grabbing them if you want them.\n\nLike I said, the surprise delisting of these BC titles is a really bad look for MS given the rightful praise they've gotten for the BC initiatives. Especially since many of these hadn't been available for that long. At least with this 360 store (and with the February wave) they gave people some time to grab these games. These ones just vanished.\n\nI've been waiting forever for Ninja Gaiden II to go on sale and it never has. I'm probably just going to buy it this weekend.\n\nI don't think any of the Ninja Gaiden games have ever gone on sale. Some publishers just don't put their old games on sale, which is really annoying.\n\nAt least with those games (as with any of the ones in my OP) you can still play them with a physical copy if they do get delisted, but I know that I am trying to pick up digital copies when I can as I'm not really expecting many more Xboxes to have physical disk drives.\n\nI really should buy the Otogi games. I've been waiting 2-3 years for them to go on sale, they probably never will.\n\nJust get them now. At least they're only $10 each, which is reasonable to me. They're never going to go on sale.\n\nBtw thanks for opening this thread! I was really bothered by these delistings as there were a couple of them I still have to buy\n\nYou're welcome! It really irked me too.\n\nI feel like games are disappearing all the time on the service. Enchanted Arms was the latest I wanted, which disappeared some weeks back. If you want anything from the service, consider not waiting for a sale, as they could disappear at any time. I regret not getting Enchanted Arms, but I didn't want to pay full price for it, because I already played it on 360. It never went on sale.\n\nThen it was gone. Sucks.\n\nYeah, maybe I should expand the OP to include other recent surprise BC delistings. I'd suggest getting whatever you want as soon as you can. N+, for example, was included in the list of games that would be delisted on the 360 marketplace, but at the time it was available on the Xbox store. Now it's gone there too, with no warning.\n\nFTC really needs to step in here. The all-digital future is coming (and I'm ok with that), but it needs to be properly regulated.\n\nLike I said, the surprise delisting of these BC titles is a really bad look for MS given the rightful praise they've gotten for the BC initiatives. Especially since many of these hadn't been available for that long. At least with this 360 store (and with the February wave) they gave people some time to grab these games. These ones just vanished.\n\nIt's not really up to Microsoft, though. If a publisher wants a game pulled with zero notice, there's nothing they can do to stop them, BC or otherwise.\n\nXbox 360 marketplace store will close on July 29th, 2024.\n\nOn July 29, 2024, Xbox will stop supporting the ability to purchase new games, DLC, and other entertainment content from the Xbox 360 Store on the console and the Xbox 360 Marketplace (marketplace.xbox.com)\n\nRelated to this change, the Microsoft Movies & TV app will no longer function on Xbox 360, which means TV and movie content will no longer be viewable on your Xbox 360 after July 29th, 2024.\n\nBetween now and July 2024, you can continue purchasing games and DLC from the Xbox 360 Store and at the Xbox 360 Marketplace.\n\nThis change will not affect your ability to play Xbox 360 games or DLC you have already purchased. Xbox 360 game content previously purchased will still be available to play , not only the Xbox 360 console but also Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S devices via backward compatibility.\n\nAnother delisted game was Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict. It was removed on the same day as Indiana Jones, Sphinx and the Splinter Cell games.\n\nThis is notable because this delisted game was from Epic Games, not Ubisoft. So we can't blame the problem squarely on Ubisoft.\n\nhttps://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/Unreal-Championship-2-The-Liandri-Conflict/BTFJZ37GDLKK\n\nYeah, I have a disk version of this but I wanted to pick it up digitally at some point, since I don't trust disks to last. Guess I just have to hope this one will.\n\nI agree with the advice that if there's stuff you want you should just pick it up, because there are no guarantees that they'll remain available. I bought Otogi 1 and 2 recently for this reason. With the Xbox 360 store being closed I wouldn't be surprised if we see a lot more games randomly removed without warning in the coming months.\n\nI agree with the advice that if there's stuff you want you should just pick it up, because there are no guarantees that they'll remain available.

At some point recently all of the DLC for Arkham Origins was delisted. That is one of the weird games that was only playable on modern consoles via BC with the disk, but the DLC was still available on the old 360 marketplace. I figured I'd pick it up when I played it. Then one day I noticed that it was gone. I was able to snag a code for the season pass through Dell's online store (still available, btw), but there are a few other DLC packs that are lost to time.\n\nNot a huge deal that those are gone as they don't seem to major (and no achievements for them), but it's a shame that there was absolutely no warning. I would have picked it all up had I known.\n\nDefinitely the way to go. At some point recently all of the DLC for Arkham Origins was delisted.

Just nabbed it in case that goes away too.\n\nThanks for the tag.\n\nI will take an action item to double check internally whether these titles were intentionally delisted or not. The fact that they are all OG Xbox titles is interesting.\n\nYeah please do; seems weird that it specifically targets only that batch of stuff. That batch also added Puzzle Fighter II HD, which if I'm not mistaken still doesn't seem to get recognized when the Capcom Digital Collection disc is inserted (despite that game being on said disc), so I had to rebuy that one on the store to play it. The Nov 2021 batch works and plays pretty flawlessly from what I own, though\n\nOn that note, Castle of Shikigami 2 on Switch mysteriously got delisted in EU earlier this month without any heads up or reason I can find, and it only came out in April. Curiously it had a 30% off sale not long prior. And the same sale is on in NA. I grabbed it upon knowing the former and I HIGHLY recommend folks in NA to do the same. You have until the 21st.\n\nCastle of Shikigami 2 | Deku Deals\n\nCastle of Shikigami 2 - on sale now for 30% off.
