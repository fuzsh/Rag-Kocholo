        "text": "Where do I start?..... This game is Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry. It was an awesome standalone game that was a spin on Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, and as a storyline game enthusiast, I couldn't wait to play it. The biggest reason was that it would be set in #Haiti, and feature my heritage. I was stoked! I got into the game and it was a visual historical masterpiece, and the gameplay was even better! HOWEVER! I was turned off by it when I heard the language of the locals. WHAT LANGUAGE WAS THAT?! It was not #Haitian Kreyol, not even a variation of it. Now, I understand if there was some of the old African language used but Ubisoft Ubisoft Montr√©al Ubisoft India Studios consulted a \"cultural team\" that gave you something lackluster. For this exact reason, I started 8th & Rolle Media, to make sure that Film, Video Games, and other media outlets highlight the language and culture of Haiti and Haitian Creole accurately. We specialize in helping tell the stories in the way it should be told. Big fan @Ubisoft, but I have to be honest. Love your games, let's work together to not repeat this mistake.

Ubisoft Bordeaux, steering the helm, faced unique challenges in balancing modernity with legacy. As shared at this year's Game Developers Conference, not every idea made it through; dogs, sandstorms, and even a monkey companion were concepts left on the cutting room floor. These decisions were tough but necessary to hone Mirage‚Äôs focus on delivering a pure Assassin experience. Discover more here, https://ubi.li/wmt1h and let us know your thoughts on Mirage's Assassin experience, and the rich setting of Baghdad!\n\nüé¨ Does the name...DedSec ring a bell? üçø . . . üöÄ Ubisoft is bringing Watch Dog to the big screen!
