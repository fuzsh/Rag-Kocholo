        "text": "Paris, France, October 26, 2006 - SpirOps today announced that Ubisoft uses SpirOps AI to bring opponents to life in the multiplayer version of the recently released video game Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent.\n\nSpirOps AI helps game developers bestow their virtual characters with realistic behavior, thanks to a new approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI), called Drive Oriented. SpirOps AI allows virtual characters to learn independently how to live better and longer in their virtual world; adapting with evolutions in their virtual world and with the players' actions.\n\nWith Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent, for the very first time the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell saga features computer controlled opponents (bots) for the multi-player version. The Spy versus Mercenaries mode will allow players to face off with other players or with vicious mercenary bots powered by SpirOps AI.\n\n\"The choice of the Artificial Intelligence technology was critical,\" explains Olivier Saillant, Lead Programmer for Ubisoft's Annecy Studio. \"Bots had to be a realistic alternative to human players. Weneeded an AI solution that could handle various human behaviors while letting us keep control overthe game. SpirOps AI, thanks to its Drive Oriented layer approach, tot ally fit this need.\"\n\n\"We are very proud to have been chosen by Ubisoft to bring to life the computer controlled opponents for the multiplayer version,\" said Axel Buendia, CEO for SpirOps. \"Artificial Intelligence is one of the major steps forward in next generation gaming and together, SpirOps AI and Ubisoft are bringing life to games.\"\n\nTo see how SpirOps AI can bring life to your game, and how to receive a SpirOps AI evaluation kit, please visit http://www.spirops.com, or contact SpirOps: contact@spirops.com\n\nAbout Ubisoft\n\nUbisoft is a leading producer, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment products worldwide and has grown considerably through its strong and diversified lineup of products and partnerships.

But he's never faced an enemy like this before. To stop a devastating terrorist attack, he must infiltrate a vicious terrorist group and destroy it from within. For the first time ever, experience the relentless ension and gut-wrenching dilemmas of life as a double agent. As you infiltrate a terrorist organisation in its American headquarters, you must carefully weigh the consequences of your actions. Kill too many criminals and you'll blow your cover. Hesitate too long and millions will die. Do whatever it takes to complete your mission, but get out alive.\n\nAbout SpirOps\n\nSpirOps is a middleware development team focused on artificial intelligence issues. Their ultimate goal is to allow video games and simulations development teams to enter what we call \"the Living Game era\". To design more realistic behaviors with a never reached complexity, the SpirOps team had to develop a new artificial intelligence design paradigm called \"Drive Oriented\". This paradigm allows to design artificial intelligence with graphical tools, and to keep a linear complexity along the brain creation process.
