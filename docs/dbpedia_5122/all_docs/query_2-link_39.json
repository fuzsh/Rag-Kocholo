        "text": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory has entered the final phase before its six-way assault on retail. Developer and publisher Ubisoft has announced the stealth action game has gone gold and will begin infiltrating PCs, Xboxes, PlayStation 2s, and GameCubes, on March 31. N-Gage and mobile versions, developed and published by Gameloft, are also expected next week. A version for the DS is also expected later this year.\n\nSupercommando Sam Fisher's third outing sees him tackling information terrorists who have hacked into city power grids, stock exchanges, and national defense systems. Fisher goes deep undercover as only he knows how, by stealthily dropping right into the lion's mouth unnoticed. Using high-tech gadgetry, gamers will uncover the multiple threats to society and stop the plot to terrorize the entire world.\n\nFisher brings new moves and items to the fight this time around, most notably a knife. The blade won't be used for stabbing alone; Fisher can slice through thin material for the ultimate sneak attack. A slew of new lethal moves can be performed from great heights, such as the as-painful-as-it-sounds \"inverted neck break.\"\n\nThe popular multiplayer mode gets an upgrade in Chaos Theory. In addition to the competitive spy-versus-mercenaries scenario, Ubisoft has added a cooperative mode that lets two spies take on the bad guys simultaneously, opening up new maneuvers that Sam Fisher couldn't pull off alone."
