The URL, which Gameloft promoted on Twitter, is samsnewmission.com, Sam Fisher being the protagonist of the Splinter Cell series.\n\nGameloft has already published several Splinter Cell on mobile thanks to the company's fraternal connection with Ubisoft, which publishes the console versions.\n\nThat's the evidence that a new Splinter Cell game is coming, but how do we know it's going to be an iPhone game? Simple - the numbers across the bottom of the teaser site are the coordinates for Infinite Loop, Apple's Cupertino headquarters.\n\nThis is the first Splinter Cell game to hit iPhone. We'll supply further details as we come by them.\n\nGameloft's Twitter feed"
