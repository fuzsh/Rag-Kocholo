        "text": "Retro Let's Play: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (2002) - August 2022.\n\nTo find out what this is and why we're doing it, click here.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nStealth + Michael Ironside, that's all you need to know. Well ok, it's a stealth game with all the cool gadgets and wicked lighting plus a super cheesy plot about terrorists and stuff. Early 2000's perfection.\n\nAlso you read that date right this masterpiece turns 20 this year, in November to be exact.\n\nVersions.\n\nThe Original XBOX hosts a stunning version of this game, not to be left behind the GameCube, PS2, Mac, GBA and PC also have versions as well released a year after. This month I reckon I will play it on my One X on my OLED - yes this game is enhanced on later xboxes and looks awesome too.\n\nHistory (from Wikipedia)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy's_Splinter_Cell_(video_game)\n\nHow to play.\n\nSo many ways!\n\nGrab it on uplay - it's cheap @ $7.50!\n\nBuy a disc off the ebays and play it on any of the xboxens you may have handy. (One or Series). It IS enhanced and the enhancing is pretty neat. Also available digitally on xboxen afaik - https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-splinter-cell/C46H5R7GT7X9\n\nIf you are feeling REALLY sassy this game supports system link on the original xbox and allows not just one, but TWO, count 'em two Sam Fishers to complete missions in co-op. WuZMoT and I are partway through a run of this at his place and by gum I might just go over to his place, bask in the glow of his two huge ass CRT's and play some more this month too.\n\nOops system link is in a later entry, worth trying if you enjoy this one.\n\nI don't think I'm gonna finish this before the end of the month but I have had fun!\n\nGonna be honest though I much prefer to be an assassin and the don't kill anyone missions are the toughest for me\n\nI got through the CIA one and then just blitzed the Kalinatek level, after that I'm now at the Chinese Embassy and it's a no kill level.\n\nLooking at the wiki it appears I have three more levels after this, it's taking me longer than I thought I have a little bit of trouble sneaking up on guards and grabbing them, plus i like to clear all the NPC's so I can freely traverse the areas which of course results in many retries.\n\nLooking at the versions I'm thinking maybe the PC version would have been the one to choose as it uses save anywhere instead of checkpoints which can be punishing as they tend to be a little far apart."
