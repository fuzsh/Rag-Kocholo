        "text": "Some of the App Store’s bigger developers and publishers have been slow to update their iPhone apps for the new features available in firmware iOS 4 and Apple’s latest device, the iPhone 4. Namely, few of the high profile, high priced games have been retrofitted with multitasking and high resolution visuals.\n\nSo it's refreshing to see Splinter Cell Conviction, from App Store behemoth Gameloft, updated with both iOS 4 multitasking and crisp, high-res graphics designed specifically for the iPhone 4’s superduper retina screen.\n\nWith a larger number of Gameloft’s games – from Shrek Kart to Gangstar: West Coast Hustle – receiving HD iPad ports, there’s more chance of the publisher chucking the up-scaled visuals onto their pint-size iPhone companions, and giving them multitasking support while it's at it.\n\nLet's hope other high profile developers follow suit in updating their games with the latest features.\n\nThe multitasking and retina screen visuals update for Splinter Cell Conviction is available to download now."
