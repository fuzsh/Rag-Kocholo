        "text": "Suggested by u/jedi271\n\n\"ˆI like some of his songs and he's really talented, but his new album sounded really same-y to me.\"\n\n—u/PM_ME_YOUR_GIFTCODES\n\n\"I’m never sure if I’m listening to one song or the whole album. It never ends.\"\n\n—u/Bucca_AD\n\n\"Chainsmokers hands down win this contest.\"\n\n—u/manan011\n\n\"Write something about what happened when I was young...and then a nostalgic memory...'when we were 16'...another nostalgic memory...'and then the night was getting younger'...\n\nThen say the same sentence 2–4 times while building up on the tackiest snare you can find, and then do the drop. Now it's verse one again but by a girl. Repeat. The chords are always the same: F, G, Am.\"\n\n—u/magnitude-of-light\n\n\"I think it was a Tumblr post that said, 'You could literally point to any two white guys and tell me they are the Chainsmokers, and I'd believe you.'\"\n\n—u/danielstover\n\n\"Every Train song follows the same formula. A few years ago, I was stuck in the back of a minivan, wedged up against a speaker, on a family road trip. My bratty little sister wouldn't stop complaining until my parents started playing every Train CD she owned. Every song basically went, 'I like a girl / I messed up / I'm going to the bay / woo California.' For three hours.\"\n\n—u/ConfusedTentacle\n\n\"Maroon 5. We get it — Adam Levine is a great lover.\"\n\n—u/thefirststoryteller\n\n\"'Makes Me Wonder' is the only song I like from them. Everything else new has been hit by that 2010s pop song formula that just lacks character.\"\n\n—u/Uncle_Skeeter\n\n\"Don't forget, 'Look how high my vocal range is! Stupidly high-pitched line here.'\"\n\n—u/FantomLightning\n\nSuggested by u/TheOctophant\n\n\"It took me years to realize that 'Lips Are Movin'' and 'All About That Bass' were different songs.\"\n\n—u/DementedMK\n\n\"Her songs all do sound the same. Trumpety doo-wop sounds and her talking about how she’s too good/smart/beautiful to give in to the demands of all the people not chasing her down.\"\n\n—u/asharnoff\n\nSuggested by u/smallerthings\n\n\"My friend and I jokingly say we're in a Creed cover band where we sing along to non-Creed songs in the lead singer's voice. It's called 'The Key of Creed.' Eventually, you realize that every song sounds like Creed if you sing it in the key of Creed.\"\n\n—u/falconrider\n\n\"In high school, I learned how to play bass by playing along with my CDs. I realized that every track on the Creed CD had the same chord structure. It got really boring after track four.\"\n\n—u/jaywiak\n\n\"Quote from Angus Young of AC/DC: 'I'm sick and tired of people saying that we put out 11 albums that sound exactly the same. In fact, we've put out 12 albums that sound exactly the same.'\"\n\n—u/ripplemon\n\n\"Every song I heard from them had the exact same drum beats.\"\n\n—u/mcSibiss\n\n\"I played bass in an AC/DC cover band for a very brief stint of time. It was awesome; you learn 'Back in Black,' and then you basically know every song.\"\n\n—u/roryoglory\n\n\"Worst thing to happen to country music.\"\n\n—u/Tomhyde098\n\n\"Came here for this. While it's all fine and pleasant enough to listen to, damn if I could ever tell you which song is which. They just keep pumping them out too. Every week it seems they have a new hit single on the radio.\"\n\n—u/Frenchie_Von_Richter\n\n\"I find it to be some of the best damn newer country on the radio, but it's actually ridiculous how little variety there is in their albums.\"\n\n—u/pablo_honey_17\n\n\"I'm not even sure how 'country' Zac Brown tries to be. Most of his hits are Jimmy Buffet knockoffs.\"\n\n—u/spiderlanewales\n\n\"We get it, Johnny, you love the E D A progression.\"\n\n—u/TobiasMasonPark\n\n\"I love the Ramones, but even their albums tend to be pretty repetitive and cover the same basic themes:\n\nRockin' anthemic opener.\n\n'I Wanna [X]'\n\nSlower sweet love song.\n\n'I Don't Wanna [Y]'\n\n'I'm not well, and I would like an extreme psychiatric medical procedure to dull the pain.'\n\n'[Name] is a [Term related to the burgeoning punk-rock movement].'\n\nCover of a relatively obscure '60s bubblegum song.\n\nAnd so on and so forth.\"\n\n—[deleted]\n\nSuggested by u/Cygnus314\n\n\"If you’ve heard 'Fireflies,' you’ve heard them all.\"\n\n—u/747drvr\n\n\"I think there's two reasons why most of his music sounds really similar to me. The first reason is just that he uses similar instruments and beats throughout everything. The second reason is that Adam Young reuses some melodies in a bunch of his songs, and thanks to Reddit there's a list where they show up. Personally I like it and think it ties his music together well, but it does make everything sound similar too.\"\n\n—u/Cygnus314\n\n\"When I first heard 'Ocean Eyes,' I loved the sound. Sounded great. So I looked up Owl City and listened to the album, and without knowing any of the song names, I just noticed that the entire album sounded the same. Nearly zero difference in between songs.\"\n\n—u/gtsomething\n\nSuggested by u/xer0life\n\n\"I didn't realize how true this was until I saw this video. I still enjoy them, but it's real hard to not laugh through it.\"\n\n—u/TheGesticulator\n\n\"They had a song on the radio once, and when the chorus hit I started singing along, only to discover it was a different song to what I thought.\n\n'Next chorus I've got it!' I said to myself. Same thing. A third song. 'Surely next time I have it; do they even have more than three songs?' It turns out yes, they do.\"\n\n—u/Aardvark_Man\n\n\"They've made probably the same song four times over in the last few years. They all sound exactly the same to me and probably use the exact same chord progressions in the exact same keys.\"\n\n—u/IrrelevantLeprechaun\n\n\"I was listening to 'Some Nights' (from 2012, their last album) the other day to see if it still holds up (I love Fun. for the record) and it doesn't. The beats for 'Carry On,' 'We Are Young,' and 'Some Nights' sound identical.\"\n\n—u/letspaintthesky"
