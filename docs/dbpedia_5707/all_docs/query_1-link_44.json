        "text": "Jukebox is a studio album from Canadian rock musicians Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings, performing together under the name “The Bachman-Cummings Band”. It was released on Sony BMG on June 12, 2007. The album features cover versions of songs from the 1960s that Bachman and Cummings listened to while growing up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Bachman and Cummings are backed on the album by the Canadian band The Carpet Frogs. The album has a runtime of 1 hour and 50 seconds.\n\nAccording to a review by AllMusic, the album is a mix of rock, pop, and blues, and features a wide range of styles, along with a bit of blunt satire. The album’s long runtime allows each track to remain interesting and to cover a number of topics. The reviewer concluded that it is the “wide range of styles, along with a bit of blunt satire” that make the album, giving it 3/5 stars. Another review by antiMusic.com praised the album’s faithful renditions of the originals, with a couple of unique treatments. The reviewer also noted that both Bachman and Cummings get their moments to shine, with both sharing vocals."
