        "text": "Burton Cummings, is a Canadian musician and songwriter who was the lead singer of The Guess Who from 1965 to 1975. During that time Burton sang, wrote and co-wrote the lion’s share of the Guess Who music, including successes like These Eyes, Laughing, No Time, American Woman, Share the Land, Star Baby, and Clap For the Wolfman.\n\nIn 1970, The Guess Who’s “American Woman” stayed at #1 in Billboard for three weeks. After that time Cummings recorded many of the most famous Guess Who songs including; ”Share the Land,” “Hand Me Down World,” “Albert Flasher,” “Rain Dance,” “Sour Suite,” “Glamour Boy,” “Star Baby” and “Clap for the Wolfman.” Cummings sang lead on all 20 Guess Who singles that charted in Billboard from 1969 to 1975.\n\nIn 1975, after 10 years, Burton Cummings left The Guess Who to become a solo artist and the group disbanded. His subsequent solo successes included “Stand Tall”, “I’m Scared,” “Break it to Them Gently,” and “Fine State of Affairs.”\n\nHe received the Genie Award, Canada’s equivalent of the Grammy, for “You Saved My Soul”, which appeared in the movie “Melanie”, a film in which Cummings had a prominent dramatic role.\n\nIn 2000, the Guess Who reunited for concerts across Canada, and in 2001, they toured the U.S. extensively with a “close to original” lineup, including Cummings, Bachman, Peterson, Mc Dougall, and Wallace.\n\nIn 2001, Burton and the rest of The Guess Who received honorary doctorates at Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba. More recently, Cummings was made an officer of the Order of Canada, the highest honor bestowed upon a civilian in Canada.\n\nCummings continues his writings, both songs and prose. He’s done occasional shows with Randy Bachman as The Bachman-Cummings Band, featuring The Carpet Frogs, a band from Toronto and makes occasional appearances at various Canadian venues as a solo performer.\n\nSONY/BMG has released a compilation album titled the Bachman Cummings Song Book featuring hits from The Guess Who, Bachman-Turner Overdrive and Cummings’ solo career.\n\nBachman & Cummings also released “The Thunderbird Trax” an album Burton and Randy did in 1987 in White Rock. It was only made available at live concerts of Bachman and Cummings.\n\nCummings’ latest release is Above the Ground. It contains 19 tracks, all written by Cummings himself, with no co-writers. Long time fans have called this his best work ever, and it has met with critical praise since its release.\n\nThe package also includes a DVD of behind the scenes looks at the recording process. Filmed by long time associate and videographer Lil Sarafian, the DVD includes both serious and hilarious moments culled from the recording sessions at Blue Moon Studios.The album was released in Canada in 2009 and the United States on May 25, 2010.\n\n—"
