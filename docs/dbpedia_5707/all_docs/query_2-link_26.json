        "text": "Article content\n\nBurton Cummings figures to be the last front man standing at Rock The Park 2014.\n\nThe emphatically ex-Guess Who star and his band close the outdoor music fest at Harris Park on Saturday night. Fans can expect to hear plenty from the Cummings’ and Guess Who songbook at Harris Park.\n\nThat means a set list just as likely to have such post-1975 solo hits Stand Tall, Clap for the Wolfman, My Own Way to Rock, and Break It to Them Gently as songs from the Guess Who era.\n\n“I would say 98% of the show is recognizable songs. I don’t try to shove new stuff down people’s throats anymore,” Cummings said recently from Los Angeles.\n\n“I just stick to the most famous ones that are the most fun. I have a great band now, a tremendous band, The Carpet Frogs from Toronto,” he said.\n\nCummings had the first U.S. platinum album by a Canadian artist with The Guess Who. In solo flight, he had the first quadruple-platinum Canadian-produced album. Altogether, he has earned about 80 platinum and gold record awards.\n\nHe can call on all five players in The Carpet Frogs to help with the harmonies.\n\n“When the harmonies are all there, there’s six vocals on stage which is pretty strong. This is something I’ve always been a stickler about, the vocals,” he said.\n\nThe former Winnipeg star, 66, has bases in California and Vancouver Island. Cummings follows Huey Lewis & The News on Saturday. Darius Rucker headlines at Rock The Park’s one-day sibling fest Gone Country on Wednesday. Weezer headlines Thursday and Sammy Hagar on Friday at the rock fest’s two opening days.\n\n“I like Huey. I’ve liked those records for a long time. I look forward to meeting him and telling him how much I’ve enjoyed his voice and his records,” Cummings said.\n\nHe was less happy to hear The Guess Who had recently splashed around a Detroit riverfront date. Following legal wrangling, former Guess Who bassist Jim Kale and drummer Garry Peterson have kept touring with various Guess Who lineups.\n\n“Here I am out touring still and Randy Bachman is still out touring,” Cummings said of the two ex-Guess Who members who created the Winnipeg band’s iconic hits, but have separate careers.\n\nWhat angers Cummings most is not groups that tour as tributes to departed icons, like The Platters outfits which carry on that 1950s’ singing group’s name. It’s the rock bands who tour without their iconic members.\n\n“Somebody’s gotta set a precedent for this nonsense,” Cummings said. “There’s Journey without Steve Perry, there’s Grand Funk without Mark Farner and it goes on and on and on.\n\n“I don’t know when there will be a law made about this, but sooner or later it’s gotta change,” he said.\n\nCummings was the first recording artist inducted into Canada’s Walk of Fame twice - first as lead singer and songwriter with the The Guess Who in 2001 then in 2011 as a solo artist.\n\nHis former Guess Who bandmate and songwriter Bachman was inducted to the Walk of Fame at Toronto the next year.\n\nAt the time, Bachman talked to QMI Agency about the Winnipeg scene back in the day and how its members continued to inspire each other.\n\nThat no longer holds -- at least for Cummings.\n\n“Randy and I aren’t very close any more either. It’s not pleasant between the original four. That’s no secret. I’m not revealing any great, well-kept secrets. We are definitely not friends anymore,” Cummings said.\n\nThe four original members reunited in 1999 to play a 20-minute set at the Pan Am Games in Winnipeg and toured in 2000. It was the first time they had performed together since 1983.\n\nNo such future reunion is likely.\n\nAs for other Canadian classic rockers, Cummings was much happier in looking forward to reconnecting with such bands at April Wine and Loverboy at a Cold Lake, Alberta, festival before arriving in London Rock the Park XI.\n\nHe’s also happy to connect with fans on social media. Having mastered the art of the Top 40 single decades ago, Cummings has proved adept at Twitter and blogging in recent years.\n\n“It’s a virtual cyber fan club,” he said.\n\nRock The Park XI is the third of London’s major outdoor music festivals in July following TD Sunfest and Home County Music & Art fest which have been held in Victoria Park.\n\nJones Entertainment Group (JEG) launched Rock The Park in 2004 to support children living with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), a deadly degenerative disease.\n\nRock the Park’s 10th edition raised more than $306,000 for London-based Bethanys Hope Foundation, which funds MLD research. Since its first edition in 2004, Rock the Park raised more than $1.8 million for the foundation.\n\n-- with files from QMI Agency\n\njames.reaney@sunmedia.ca\n\nTwitter.com/JamesatLFPress\n\nTHE LONDON CONNECTION\n\nWhat: Burton Cummings played a solo concert at the now-Budweiser Gardens in May, 2011, the day after iconic Canadian record producer Jack Richardson had died at a London hospital. After mortgaging his Toronto house to pay for Guess Who recording costs, Richardson had helmed the Guess Who’s albums and produced hit records for the Canadian band. In a salute to Richardson, Cummings looked to the heavens and made a striking gesture of farewell.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Start Communications and Scotiabank present Rock The Park XI, a London outdoor music fest to benefit Bethanys Hope Foundation. Gone Country goes July 23 and is followed by three-day rock fest.\n\nWhen: Wednesday, gates at 4:30 p.m., Thursday, Friday, gates at 4 p.m. ; Saturday, gates at 3:30 p.m.\n\nGone Country lineup: Darius Rucker headlines, Dean Brody, Eli Young Band,Tim Hicks on bill.\n\nThursday: Weezer headlines, Tegan & Sara, Matthew Good, July Talk, The Affair also on bill.\n\nFriday: Sammy Hagar & Friends headline, Extreme, Tom Kiefer of Cinderella, Winger, Survivor.\n\nSaturday: Burton Cummings & his band headline.

Evan (Canadian actor Michael Cera) desperately channels Cummings on the iconic Guess Who hit These Eyes. Cera needs to impress a tough cokehead audience in the film.\n\n“One of the bikers says, ‘Well, If he’s a singer, let’s have him sing something,’ ” Cummings said with a laugh. “And he sings These Eyes. It’s not just the first few lines. The guy does half the tune. He does the big modulation up in the chorus. He starts going up, ‘These eyes have seen a lot of love.’ ” Cummings sang the line in a mock squeaky voice as he told the story in a recent phone interview. “It was hilarious, man. That was a terrific moment for me.”"
