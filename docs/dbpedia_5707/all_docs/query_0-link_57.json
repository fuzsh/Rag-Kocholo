        "text": "This was a great double-sided single… the B-side was Undun.\n\nA hit in their native Canada, this song was written by Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings during their brief collaboration together in The Guess Who.\n\nTheir name came about when their label Quality Records released their first hit single (“Shakin’ All Over”) credited only to “Guess Who?” in an attempt to build a mystique around the band. They wanted the public to believe that this was a possible British band. The real name of the band was “Chad Allan & The Expressions,” but radio station DJs continued to refer to them as “The Guess Who.” when playing subsequent singles.\n\nLaughing peaked at #1 in Canada and #10 in the Billboard 100 in 1969. The song was on the album Canned Wheat which peaked at #91 in the Billboard Album Charts.\n\nFor more about American Woman go read Dave from A Sound Day blog.\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nWhile the team-up of Bachman and Cummings was short-lived, as Bachman split a year later citing conflicts with his Mormon beliefs, they have since reunited as either The Bachman-Cummings Band or, under the name of their backing band, The Carpet Frogs.\n\nThis song took about 10 minutes to write. Speaking with The Edmonton Journal in 1969, Bachman said: “We find that if we have to sit down and ponder, it doesn’t happen.”\n\nRolling Stone’s review of the album Canned Wheat sniffed that it “would be even more pleasurable if they didn’t sound a mite too much like the Airplane (instrumentally) and the Springfield (vocally and often instrumentally).”\n\nUndun\n\nLaughing\n\nLaughing\n\nI should laugh, but I cry\n\nBecause your love has passed me by\n\nYou took me by surprise\n\nYou didn’t realize, that I was waiting\n\nTime goes slowly but carries on\n\nAnd now the best years have come and gone\n\nYou took me by surprise\n\nI didn’t realize that you were laughing\n\nLaughing… the things you’re doin’ to me\n\nLaughing… that ain’t the way it should be\n\nYou took away everything I had\n\nYou put the hurt on me\n\nI go alone now, calling your name\n\nAfter losing at the game\n\nYou took me by surprise\n\nI didn’t realize, that you were laughing\n\nTime goes slowly, but carries on\n\nAnd now the best years, the best years have come and gone\n\nYou took me by surprise\n\nI didn’t realize, that you were laughing\n\nLaughing… the things you’re doin’ to me\n\nLaughing… that ain’t the way it should be\n\nYou took away everything I had\n\nYou put the hurt on me\n\nLaughing… the things you’re doin’ to me\n\nLaughing… that ain’t the way it should be\n\nYou took away everything I had\n\nYou put the hurt on me"
