Although the group has had numerous personnel changes throughout the years, the most prominent members have been Burton Cummings and guitarist Randy Bachman. Cummings was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His first band was an R&B group called The Deverons. The band released two singles on the REO Records label. In 1965, Cummings joined The Guess Who replacing Bob Ashley on keyboards and eventually Chad Allan on vocals. The Guess Who scored commercially with their first international hit “These Eyes” (#6 Billboard Hit) in 1969. The track was featured on their album Wheatfield Soul on the RCA record label. The single was written by Bachman/Cummings and was their first to reach the top ten. The Guess Who followed with a succession of Top 40 hits including … “Laughing” (#10 U.S. Hit, #1Canada -written by Bachman/Cummings) and “Undun” (#22 U.S. Hit). 1970 would prove to be the most pivotal year for The Guess Who. The group scored (2) #1 Hits in the U.S. with “No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature\" and “American Woman” the group's biggest selling single. The Guess Who also spawned the hits …. “No Time” (#5 U.S. #1 Canada -written by Bachman/Cummings), “Hand Me Down World” (#17 U.S. Hit) and “Share The Land” (#10 U.S. Hit -written by Burton Cummings). Randy Bachman left The Guess Who in 1970 and would eventually form Bachman- Turner Overdrive. Subsequent albums released by The Guess Who … Canned Wheat (1969), American Woman (1970), Share The Land (1970), So Long, Bennatyne (1971), Rockin' (1972), Artificial Paradise (1973). In 1973, Burton Cummings and The Guess Who released one of the group's most underrated albums entitled The Guess Who #10. The album was a clear diversion from the band's roots but spotlighted brilliant lyrical content and virtuoso musicianship. The album featured Burton Cummings composition “Glamour Boy.” The track was a jab at David Bowie's glitter rock insurgence. The album also featured the profound “Cardboard Empire” written by Bill Wallace and Kurt Winter, while hauntingly performed by Cummings. In 1974, The Guess Who collaborated on their final Top 40 single entitled “Clap For The Wolfman,” (#6 U.S. Billboard Hit) an applicable tribute to legendary radio and TV personality Wolfman Jack. Subsequent releases: The Guess Who #10 (1973), Road Food (1974), Flavours (1974), Power in the Music (1975), The Way They Were (1976). The Guess Who disbanded in 1975. In 1983, Bachman, Cummings, Jim Kale and Garry Peterson reunited as The Guess Who to play a series of Canadian gigs and recorded the Together Again live album and video. Bachman and Cummings reunited again in 1997 to perform in Winnipeg for a disaster relief fund raiser. An eclectic Guess Who reunion ensued in 2000 featuring Bachman, Cummings, McDougall, Kale, and Peterson. Bill Wallace eventually replaced Kale while the group toured regularly through 2003. A live album and DVD followed at the end of the 2000 tour. The Guess Who was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2001. Cummings received an additional Star in 2011. The Guess Who performed for an estimated 450,000 people at Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto, a benefit concert in 2003. The Guess Who continues to tour with only original members … drummer Garry Peterson and bassist Jim Kale. Burton Cummings also amassed a widely successful solo career. He landed a huge hit with “Stand Tall” (#10 U.S. #1 Hit Canada) in 1976. Burton Cummings solo albums …Burton Cummings (1976), My Own Way to Rock (1977), Dream of a Child (1978), Woman Love (1980), The Best of Burton Cummings (1980), Sweet Sweet (1981), Heart (1984), Plus Signs (1990), The Burton Cummings Collection (1994), Up Close and Alone (1996), Above the Ground (2008). In 2002, The Burton Cummings Theatre for the Performing Arts in Winnipeg, Manitoba was renamed to dedicate the singer and songwriter. In 2008, Cummings released the highly- acclaimed CD Above The Ground. All the tracks on the release are written by Cummings. The album also features his touring band The Carpet Frogs. In 2009, Cummings received the Order of Canada, one of the country's highest civilian honors. In 2012, Burton Cummings Massey Hall was released –an incredible live CD recorded in Toronto. Most recently … Burton Cummings is on a summer tour. He'll be releasing a book of poetry soon entitled, ‘The Writings of B. L. Cummings,' and a video series called RUFF.

In this episode, we chat about how the band formed, and the rapid rise and fall of their debut single Superman's Song on the Canadian charts. Brad tells us about the fickle nature of Canadian love for their artists, and how eye-opening an experience it was for him. We discuss the legendary Clive Davis's involvement, and the chart climbing success of the band's second album; God Shuffled His Feet, and how much I love it personally. 2023 is the 30-year anniversary of that album, and for some reason, I spend an inordinate amount of time explaining to Brad what this album has meant to me throughout the years. Crash Test Dummies are on a national tour of the United States and have released a brand-new song 3 days ago called: Sacred Alphabet. This is their first new release in over a decade and is available everywhere now. Make sure you catch Crash Test Dummies on tour. Maybe they will play some of their biggest hits, Brad is gracious enough to let me play my personal favorite of their songs toward the end of the episode. Thanks Brad!\n\nSignals was Rush's follow up to their biggest selling album Moving Pictures but it was not Moving Pictures II. Off the success of Moving Pictures and the tour, Rush were emboldened to further experiment with technology to evolve their sound to the 80s. Drummer & Lyricist Neil Peart started to draw inspiration from his own journey and the plight of those in the world around him. Geddy and Alex even chipped in on some lyrics. But not all fans love the synthesizers and technology from the last great power trio - many fans are turned off by their 80s output.This was a time of experimentation and new directions for the band which would define their 80s sound. Subdivisions examines the plight of the suburban teenager, New World Man as the man at the height of his power, Losing It as an old man past his prime - quite a journey from Neil Peart. Released September 9. 1982, we hold this record in high esteem within the Rush catalog and this is our review for the 40th Anniversary of Signals - Rush.
