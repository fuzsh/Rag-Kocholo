        "text": "A while back, I posted an album that consisted entirely of Richard Thompson's acoustic stray tracks from 1990. This is sequel to that. In this era, Thompson played a great variety of acoustic songs.\n\nThe album starts with a bang: \"From Galway to Graceland\" never appeared on any album, and first showed up on a box set. But it turned out to be one of Thompson's most beloved original songs.\n\nThe vast majority of the rest of the songs are cover versions. There are a couple of exceptions, such as \"Days of Our Lives,\" which was done in a very different style on a 1990 French, Frith, Kaiser & Thompson album. \"Nobody's Wedding\" and \"Waltzing's for Dreamers\" also are originals, from albums much earlier in Thompson's career. I've included them because it's rare to have acoustic versions of them.\n\n\"Heavenly Alchemy\" is an unusual case. It's not really a song. Instead, Thompson recites Shakespearean poetry. I considered it interesting enough to include.\n\nAbout half of the songs are officially unreleased. But all or nearly all of those come from excellent soundboard recordings, so the sound quality is solid for the whole album. All but one of the songs were performed live, but I removed the crowd noise whenever possible.\n\nThis album is 46 minutes long.\n\n01 From Galway to Graceland (Richard Thompson)\n\n02 My Generation - I Can't Explain - Substitute (Richard Thompson)\n\n03 Bogie's Bonnie Belle (Richard Thompson)\n\n04 Nobody's Wedding (Richard Thompson)\n\n05 The Choice Wife [Instrumental] (Richard Thompson)\n\n06 You'll Never Walk Alone (Richard Thompson)\n\n07 Motherless Children (Richard Thompson)\n\n08 Days of Our Lives (Richard Thompson)\n\n09 Walk in the Room - Needles and Pins - Just like Tom Thumb's Blues (Richard Thompson)\n\n10 Don't Roll Those Bloodshot Eyes at Me (Richard Thompson)\n\n11 Hot Dog (Richard Thompson)\n\n12 Heavenly Alchemy [Shakespeare Reading] (Richard Thompson)\n\n13 Play with Fire (Richard Thompson with Henry Kaiser)\n\n14 Waltzing's for Dreamers (Richard Thompson with Shawn Colvin)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15268456/RichrdT_1990-1991_HeavnlyAlchmyAcoustc_atse.zip.html\n\nFor the album cover, I found a photo of Thompson from 1991.\n\nIn 1968 and 1969, director Michelangelo Antonioni made a Hollywood movie about the counterculture called \"Zabrinskie Point.\" Since it was about the counterculture, he wanted music to match for the soundtrack. He used some existing songs by various bands, and got Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, and Kaleidoscope to compose new music for the film.\n\nWhen the movie came out in early 1970, Pink Floyd only ended up with three songs on the soundtrack. But in fact they recorded a lot more, enough to have an entire album just from them. This is my attempt to create a \"Zabrinskie Point\" soundtrack featuring only Pink Floyd music.\n\nI could have made this a very long album that gathers up absolutely everything Pink Floyd did that was considered for the soundtrack. But frankly, a lot of it isn't that good. Pink Floyd's \"The Early Years\" box set has no less than 16 outtakes from the soundtrack. I didn't include any of them, because they're all incidental film music, meant to help set a mood but not far removed from forgettable muzak. Many of them are alternate versions of songs I have included.\n\nWhat I did instead was pick the strongest songs I could find, so this album would stack up with the other Pink Floyd albums from that era. I included the three songs that made it on the actual soundtrack album, plus two more songs that were bonus tracks released in the 1990s, and one of the songs from \"The Early Years\" box set. On top of that, I've included two more songs that were on \"The Early Years,\" but slightly different unreleased alternate versions.\n\nOne more song, \"The Violent Sequence,\" needs a little explanation. It almost made it to the official soundtrack, but the director decided it sounded too sad. If you listen to it, you'll immediately recognize it as an instrumental version of what would become \"Us and Them\" on the classic 1973 album \"Dark Side of the Moon.\"\n\nAll the songs mentioned above make for a 39-minute long album, which is a decent length. But I've added three more songs that weren't connected to \"Zabrinskie Point\" at all, because I don't have a better place to put them. These come from another 1970 soundtrack, this one for a documentary about the human body called \"The Body.\" The soundtrack is called \"Music from the Body,\" and it's credited to Roger Waters, the main singer and songwriter for Pink Floyd at the time, and avant garde artist Ron Geesin. Most of the songs are experimental, strange sounding instrumentals that aren't to my taste. But it also includes three folky songs written and sung by Waters, and I've added them here. They sound exactly like lost Pink Floyd songs, and that's basically what they are. In fact, one of them, \"Give Birth to a Smile,\" is performed by all four members of Pink Floyd, so I've credited it to the full band.\n\n01 Heart Beat, Pig Meat [Instrumental] (Pink Floyd)\n\n02 Country Song [The Red Queen] (Pink Floyd)\n\n03 Aeroplane [Fingal's Cave] [Instrumental] (Pink Floyd)\n\n04 Crumbling Land (Pink Floyd)\n\n05 Alan's Blues [Instrumental] (Pink Floyd)\n\n06 Oenone [Early Version] [Instrumental] (Pink Floyd)\n\n07 Rain in the Country [Unknown Song] [Instrumental] (Pink Floyd)\n\n08 Come in Number 51, Your Time is Up [Careful with that Axe, Eugene] [Instrumental] (Pink Floyd)\n\n09 The Violent Sequence [Early Version of Us and Them] [Richard Wright Demo] (Pink Floyd)\n\n10 Chain of Life (Roger Waters & Ron Geesin)\n\n11 Sea, Shell and Stone - Breathe (Roger Waters & Ron Geesin)\n\n12 Give Birth to a Smile (Pink Floyd)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16701316/PNKFLYD1970a_ZabrskiPontAlternte_atse.zip.html\n\nThe official \"Zabrinskie Point\" soundtrack seems to have had several different album covers, that I think were for different editions of the album. I picked a version that had the least text, with just the words \"Zabrinskie Point\" in big letters. Then I added \"Pink Floyd\" above it.\n\nHave you ever heard of Mason, Capaldi, Wood & Frog (MCWF)? Probably not, I'd imagine. I'll explain about this band in detail below, but the short explanation is that it was a 1969 version of Traffic, except one that was led by Dave Mason, and without Steve Winwood. As far as I know, nobody has ever collected all of the few recordings of MCWF that exist, either officially or on bootleg, so I'm psyched to be presenting this for the first time. If you like the music of Traffic and/or Dave Mason, you should like this.\n\nDave Mason was in Traffic from the band's beginning in mid-1967 until when it broke up for the first time in late 1968. But it seems that he and Steve Winwood didn't get along that well. He left the group for a few months in early 1968, but returned in time to play a key role with the band's second album, simply called \"Traffic.\" However, Winwood felt that Mason's style of music, more poppy and less jazzy, didn't fit in with where he wanted Traffic to go. Winwood led the effort to kick Mason out of Traffic, and apparently the two other band members (Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood) agreed.\n\nBut then something very strange happened. Not long after kicking Mason out of the group, Winwood left the band at the start of 1969 and joined the \"supergroup\" Blind Faith with Eric Clapton instead. Traffic then ceased to exist. But almost immediately, Mason hooked back up with the other two band members, Capaldi and Wood, and created a new band. They added a keyboard player, Wynder K. Frog, to help fill the void of not having Winwood's keyboard playing (though nobody could replace Winwood's incredible vocals).\n\nThe new band began playing concerts, with an emphasis on Mason's songs from Traffic as well as new songs he'd written. The band was well received, as they were widely seen as Traffic reborn, only with a new name. However, the band members didn't get along well with each other and didn't feel a musical chemistry. (I imagine the fact that the band was led by Mason, despite the fact that he had just been fired by the others a month or two earlier, didn't make for great chemistry!) Plus, apparently, they were all doing a lot of drugs and didn't feel that motivated. So after just three months together, the band broke up.\n\nMason went on to have a long solo career, starting with his acclaimed and popular 1970 album \"Alone Together.\" Capaldi and Wood got back together with Winwood after Blind Faith broke up, and returned with the acclaimed and popular Traffic album \"John Barleycorn\" in 1970. Traffic stayed together for a few more years, though without Mason, though Mason did rejoin the band in mid-1971, just long enough to take part in recording the live Traffic album \"Welcome to the Canteen.\" Frog, despite being a talented keyboard player, returned to musical obscurity.\n\nMCWF would have left no recorded musical legacy whatsoever except for the fact that they played live on the BBC a couple of times in February 1969, and two of these songs were officially released on an obscure box set focused on the music of Traffic member Chris Wood called \"Evening Blue.\" Plus, two MCWF instrumental studio recordings highlighting Wood's saxophone and flute soloing made it onto that box set too.\n\nAdditionally, three more songs MCWF performed at the BBC were recorded on bootleg. (A few more songs they played at the BBC appear to have been lost.) When I found a bootleg of those three songs, I discovered that the volume wobbled, regularly alternating between loud and quiet. So I did some editing in a music program to try to level out the volume. I think it sounds a lot better now. These bootleg recordings don't sound as good as the officially released songs, but they're good enough.\n\nAs for the MCWF songs here, two of them are Traffic songs written and sung by Mason (\"Cryin' to Be Heard\" and \"Feelin' Alright\"), and two others are Mason songs that would wind up on his 1970 album \"Alone Together\" (\"Waitin' for You\" and \"World in Changes\"). The band also do a cover of a blues song (\"Leaving Blues\") and two instrumentals.\n\nIf you add that all up, it's only 33 minutes long, which is on the short side for an album. I had a few Mason solo songs that he didn't do with Traffic but predated his first solo album, so I've included those as well. All the songs are ordered chronologically.\n\nTwo of these extra songs are live versions of \"Only You Know and I Know\" and \"World in Changes\" done at the Big Sur Folk Festival in late 1969. Mason apparently didn't have a band at the time, and he wasn't scheduled to perform at the concert. But Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young did play, and they let Mason play two songs during the middle of their set to help him get his solo career started. Just Stephen Stills stayed on stage with Mason, playing guitar and singing backing vocals a little bit.\n\nNormally, I don't like putting more than one version of a song on an album. But this album has two versions of \"World in Changes.\" I'm allowing that because this album is the logical spot for both versions to fit in my music collection. Plus, luckily, the versions are pretty different, since the live version Mason does with Stills is acoustic and the other version with MCWF is with a full band. I've titled this album \"World in Changes,\" since I have two versions of the song.\n\n01 Little Woman (Dave Mason)\n\n02 On a Theme Of… [Instrumental] (Mason, Capaldi, Wood & Frog)\n\n03 Feelin’ Alright (Mason, Capaldi, Wood & Frog)\n\n04 World in Changes (Mason, Capaldi, Wood & Frog)\n\n05 Waitin' on You (Mason, Capaldi, Wood & Frog)\n\n06 Cryin' to Be Heard (Mason, Capaldi, Wood & Frog)\n\n07 Leaving Blues (Mason, Capaldi, Wood & Frog)\n\n08 Jarn 1 [Instrumental] (Mason, Capaldi, Wood & Frog)\n\n09 Only You Know and I Know [Edit] (Dave Mason with Stephen Stills)\n\n10 World in Changes (Dave Mason with Stephen Stills)\n\n11 Satin Red and Black Velvet Woman (Dave Mason)\n\n12 To Be Free (Dave Mason & Cass Elliot)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16687953/DAVMSN1968-1970_WrldinChangs_atse.zip.html\n\nSince MCWF were only in existence a short time, and weren't that famous, there are almost no photos of the band. However, I did find one, from a newspaper article, so I'm using that as the cover art. It's a low resolution and grainy photo, but it's better than nothing. In case you're curious, the band members from left to right are: Capaldi, Mason, Wood, and Frog.\n\nOver a year after first posting this, I decided to colorize the photo. It's still the worst quality photo I've used for any album cover, but at least now it's in color. ;)\n\nStevie Wonder had a series of classic albums from 1972 to 1976, culminating with 1976's \"Songs in the Key of Life.\" But he didn't tour to support that album, and he basically disappeared for a couple of years. He returned in 1979 with the \"Journey through the Secret Life of Plants,\" a soundtrack to a documentary film virtually nobody saw. But that mostly instrumental album generally baffled listeners and sold poorly. It wasn't until 1980's \"Hotter than July\" that he seemed to get back on track with another popular and widely acclaimed album.\n\nThe album collects the stray tracks from this period. It turns out Wonder wasn't entirely silent in 1977 and 1978. He sang a live duet with the jazz great Ella Fitzgerald, which was released on an obscure Fitzgerald album. He also co-wrote and played keyboards on two instrumentals for a 1977 Ramsey Lewis album, so I've included those two songs here.\n\nHe also was part of a curious collaborative effort, a 1978 single called \"Pops, We Love You,\" honoring \"Pops\" Gordy, the beloved father of Motown head Berry Gordy. The song features Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, and Smokey Robinson, which sounds awesome, in theory. But I'm not a fan of the song. For one thing, it's a generic disco song that hasn't aged well. But also, it's an example of too many cooks spoiling the broth: four charismatic and popular singers all trying to share the lead on one song are too many.\n\nSo what I've done is to try to create a \"Wondercentric\" edit that brings Stevie Wonder's portion of the song to the forefront. Wonder's portion of the song comes near the end of it, and is relatively short. So I've cut out the start of the song and began with that. Normally, that would have made the song very short indeed. But it turns out there was a B-side all-instrumental continuation of the song with a nice flute solo. So I've edited the flute solo onto the end of the part with mostly Wonder's vocals. I know this is kind of a strange edit, but it's the only way I could come up with a version of this song that I would want to repeatedly listen to.\n\nThe rest of this album is mostly unreleased material. One song of note is \"Let's Get Serious.\" Wonder c0-wrote this for Jermaine Jackson, who had a top ten hit with it in 1980 in both the US and Britain. Wonder never released a version of it himself, but he began playing it in concert sometimes from 1980 onwards, so I've included a live version.\n\nIn 1982, Wonder released a greatest hits album with the name \"Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium I.\" It included four new songs. But actually, two of them, \"That Girl\" and \"Ribbon in the Sky,\" were released as singles in late 1981. So I've included those here.\n\nThis album is 50 minutes long.\n\n01 You Are the Sunshine of My Life (Stevie Wonder & Ella Fitzgerald)\n\n02 Spring High [Instrumental] (Ramsey Lewis & Stevie Wonder)\n\n03 Pops, We Love You [A Tribute to Father] [Wondercentric Mix] (Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye & Stevie Wonder)\n\n04 Love Notes [Instrumental] (Ramsey Lewis & Stevie Wonder)\n\n05 I Can't Help It (Stevie Wonder)\n\n06 Garden of Love (Stevie Wonder)\n\n07 Perfect Angel - Lovin' You (Stevie Wonder)\n\n08 When You've Lost Your Way (Stevie Wonder)\n\n09 Don’t Make Me Wait Too Long (Stevie Wonder)\n\n10 Let's Get Serious (Stevie Wonder)\n\n11 One Never Knows [I Never Knew Her Name] (Stevie Wonder)\n\n12 Reflections of You [Sky Blue Afternoon] (Stevie Wonder)\n\n13 That Girl (Stevie Wonder)\n\n14 Ribbon in the Sky (Stevie Wonder)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16700509/STEVIWNDR1977-1981_RibbninSky_atse.zip.html\n\nThe album cover is simply the cover of the \"Ribbon in the Sky\" single.\n\nCarole King is one of the best and most successful songwriters of all time. Incredibly enough, she wrote or co-wrote 118 top 100 hits in the U.S.!\n\nHer musical career is really split into two. From the late 1950s until about 1970, she was pretty much a pure songwriter, rarely releasing music under her own name and never playing in concert. Then, in 1971, she had a huge hit with the \"Tapestry\" album, which was one of the most successful albums of all time, and was the start of a long and successful career for her as a performer.\n\nIn the first phase of King's career, although she rarely publicly released singles, she usually made private demos of her songs for other artists to work from. She had a good voice (as her success with \"Tapestry\" and after showed), and good musical and production instincts, and easily could have had a lot of hits on her own if she wanted to. This is shown by the fact that one of her few early singles in her own name, \"It Might as Well Rain until September,\" was a hit in 1962, even reaching number three in Britain.\n\nAn album's worth of her demos were officially released in 2012 as \"The Legendary Demos.\" But this album just scratched the surface of all the demos she did. I've collected many more, most of which are still officially unreleased, though available on some bootlegs pretending to be legitimate and sometimes sold in stores. I've made three such albums, which I call \"More Legendary Demos.\" This is the first one.\n\nOnly five of the songs here have been officially released. Two were singles at the time, and three more came out on \"The Legendary Demos\" album. But the sound quality of the others are just about as good as the officially released ones.\n\nI could have included many more songs. But I only selected the ones I liked. Frankly, in King's early years, she wrote (and demoed) a lot of formulaic songs that haven't stood the test of time. But sometimes, magic would strike, and she would come up with some all time classics. Not all such classics are represented here, because she either didn't make demos of them or the demos haven't become publicly available. For instance, here are just a few of the songs from the early 196s0 I wish I had demos of, but don't: \"Chains,\" \"The Locomotion,\" \"I'm into Something Good,\" \"One Fine Day,\" and \"Halfway to Paradise.\" She really was a hit-making machine!\n\nBy the way, note the song \"Bad Boy\" on this album. Does the melody ring a bell? In my opinion, it's extremely similar to \"Pocahontas\" by Neil Young, which of course was written many years after this one. I wonder if Young was aware of \"Bad Boy\", which was officially released in 1962 but obscure, or if the similarity is just a coincidence.\n\nThis album is 40 minutes long.\n\nUPDATE: On May 17, 2022, I updated the mp3 download file. I discovered one song I'd previously missed: \"Don't Let Me Stand in Your Way.\" It's unreleased, and seems to have emerged the year before on YouTube.\n\n01 Samson and Delilah (Carole King & Gerry Goffin)\n\n02 Every Breath I Take (Carole King)\n\n03 Take Good Care of My Baby (Carole King)\n\n04 Disappointed (Carole King)\n\n05 He's a Bad Boy (Carole King)\n\n06 It Might as Well Rain until September (Carole King)\n\n07 Crying in the Rain (Carole King)\n\n08 Breaking Up Is Hard to Do (Carole King)\n\n09 Go Away Little Girl (Carole King)\n\n10 Up on the Roof (Carole King)\n\n11 Oh Oh, It Started Over Again (Carole King)\n\n12 Hey Girl (Carole King)\n\n13 Oh No, Not My Baby (Carole King)\n\n14 Don't Let Me Stand in Your Way (Carole King)\n\n15 Just Once in My Life (Carole King)\n\n16 Stage Door (Carole King)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16687659/CARLKNG1959-1965_ItMghtasWllRinuntlSptembr_atse.zip.html\n\nThere are very few early photos of Carole King. For the album cover, I used a popular publicity photo. For the rest of the cover art, I used much of the artwork from the \"It Might as Well Rain until September\" single. The photo originally was in black and white, but over a year after originally posting this, I colorized it.\n\nHere's the second album of Traffic's BBC performances. Read my write-up for the 1967 album to understand what this is all about. In short, if you like Traffic at all, you need to get this. Even if you have it already, the sound quality is better than ever before.\n\nAs luck would have it, there are enough songs to make one album of all the 1967 performances and another of all the 1968 ones, with both albums being in the 30- to 40-minute-long range. Normally, I dislike repeating the same song twice on one album. Traffic did play one song twice at the BBC. But I'm lucky again because for the song \"Heaven Is in Your Mind,\" one of the performances was in 1967 and the other was in 1968.\n\nFor the 1967 album, it seems I had the problem of BBC DJs talking over the starts of nearly every song. I'm really getting to hate DJ Brian Matthew, who annoys the heck out of me by talking deep into songs, often until the very second the vocals begin (as well as sounding as smarmy as humanly possible!). But, using the audio editing program X-Minus, I managed to wipe the DJ vocals while keeping the underlying music. Those are the ones with \"[Edit]\" in their names.\n\nIn November 2021, I redid all the songs here, using versions posted by blogger Prof Stoned, which sometimes had superior sound quality, and then making the above-mentioned edits from those. I also communicated with Prof Stoned, who set me straight on a few things. I thought I had some BBC songs that he'd missed, but he convinced me they were single versions and the like mislabeled on some bootlegs as BBC versions. So I've removed versions of \"Feelin' Alright,\" \"Dear Mr. Fantasy,\" and one or two more, that I'd had on an earlier version. This all authentic BBC stuff.\n\nThis album is 37 minutes long.\n\n01 No Face, No Name, No Number [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n02 [Roamin' thro' the Gloamin' With] 40,000 Headmen [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n03 Dear Mr. Fantasy [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n04 Blind Man (Traffic)\n\n05 You Can All Join In [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n06 Feelin' Alright [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n07 Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring (Traffic)\n\n08 Pearly Queen [Edit] (Traffic)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15259247/Trffc_1968a_BBSssionsVolum2_atse.zip.html\n\nJust as with the 1967 album, I couldn't find good color photos of the band in concert, so I've gone with another band publicity photo for the cover art. This one is from 1968.\n\nI'm proud of this release. Even if you have some from on Traffic at the BBC already, you need this version. Bootlegs of these performances have existed for many years, but I'm confident that the music has never sounded as good as it does here.\n\nOn previous bootlegs, some of the songs had good sound quality while others were poor. But apparently, at some point in the late 2010s, the performances were replayed on the BBC again, resulting in a new bootleg version of the songs at a much higher sound quality. Furthermore, a few songs were included that hadn't been bootlegged before.\n\nThen, in November 2021, I updated all the songs again. This time, I built on the versions cleaned up by a blogger named Prof Stoned. He does excellent work, but he doesn't mind when the BBC DIs talked over some of the music, and kept those parts. So I used the audio editing program X-Minus to wipe out the DJ talking while keeping the underlying music. Those are the ones marked with \"[Edit]\" in their names.\n\nThanks to all these edits, for the first time anywhere, one can hear all the BBC performances with sound quality exactly as good as the original broadcasts, and without any of the annoying DJ talkovers. This really should be an officially released album, but I've heard some record company disputes make the release of previously unreleased music from the Dave Mason years very difficult. Even if they do eventually release this, they might not remove the DJ talkovers.\n\nThe last song here, \"Utterly Simple,\" is a bonus track of sorts, in that it isn't actually a BBC performance. It's actually exactly the same as the studio version, but it's remixed to make the spoken \"phone call\" in the middle of the song louder. Previously, I'd never paid much attention to that spoken part because it was largely drowned out by the music, but with this version, one can hear it as clear as day.\n\nTraffic only performed in the studio for the BBC in 1967 and 1968. (Later, some of their live performances were played by the BBC.) I've split their performances into two albums. The 1968 album will follow.\n\nThis album is 34 minutes long.\n\n01 Paper Sun [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n02 House for Everyone [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n03 Hole in My Shoe (Traffic)\n\n04 Smiling Phases [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n05 Coloured Rain [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n06 No Face, No Name, No Number [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n07 Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush [Edit] (Traffic)\n\n08 Hope They Never Find Me There (Traffic)\n\n09 Heaven Is in Your Mind (Traffic)\n\n10 Dealer (Traffic)\n\n11 Utterly Simple [Alternate Mix] (Traffic)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15259211/Trffc_1967c_BBSssionsVolum1_atse.zip.html\n\nAs I've mentioned elsewhere, color photos of Traffic in concert in 1967 or 1968 are very hard to find. So I've gone with band publicity photos instead. This one is from 1967. But everyone in the band was looking slightly to the side, so I made some slight edits to their eyes to make them look into the camera."
