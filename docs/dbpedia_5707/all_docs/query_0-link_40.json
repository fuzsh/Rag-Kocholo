Known for touring with Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings and performing on Canada’s Walk of Fame, the Juno Awards, and more, the Carpet Frogs will headline the 50 Years of Sunshine Music Festival on July 27, which is being billed as the official celebration of the town’s 50th anniversary.\n\nTo top it off, Canadian rock legend Tom Cochrane will headline the town’s marquee Memories of Summer Music Festival on Sept. 1.\n\nOther artists who will perform include Bywater Call, Barstool Confession, Boomerang, and Grace.\n\nThe Town of Wasaga Beach’s summer live music festival lineup is unlike any other live music festival lineup in Ontario, Canada — it takes place under the stars on the sandy shores of the longest freshwater beach in the world. For summer 2024, Wasaga Beach will continue to offer thrilling performances by legendary artists, iconic bands, and up-and-coming performers — and deliver family-friendly fun, featuring beer tents by Side Launch Brewing Company and food trucks offering a variety of delicious eats from Italian and Mexican to poutine and ice cream.

Expect performances by:\n\nKitty & the Boyz\n\nPeasant Kings\n\nJess Bowman\n\nMirrage\n\nDavid Grossman\n\nSol de Cuba\n\nStrike Tyson\n\nSand & Soca is back for its second summer on the beach, featuring soul calypso live music and performances on Aug. 10.\n\nVisit 50YearsofSunshine.ca for the full 2024 summer live music festival program including more information about Trail Tunes, Music in the Park, Movies Under the Stars, and to subscribe for updates.\n\nQuick facts\n\nWasaga Beach is home to the longest freshwater beach in the world. Each year, the town welcomes almost two million visitors to our iconic Ontario beachfront community.\n\nIn August 2023, over 12,000 attendees gathered at the town’s iconic Beach Area 1 for the annual Memories of Summer Music Festival, which featured electrifying live performances by The Carpet Frogs and Canadian music icons April Wine, followed by a large fireworks display.\n\nIn February 2024, Wasaga Beach delivered its first winter music festival, Breaking the Ice, featuring performances by Canadian rock legends Burton Cummings and Blue Rodeo. Over 6,000 people attended and almost half of festival attendees visited from out of town.\n\nTo round off the 2024 live music summer season, Trail Tunes and Music in the Park will return to Oakview Woods Park.\n\n*************************"
