        "text": "Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings have finally begun their 2022 reunion tour that so far comprises just seven Canadian dates. (See the itinerary below.)\n\nTo get you up to speed: the pair had announced a “Together Again” 2020 tour of the U.S. and Canada all the way back on Feb. 24, 2020, for that summer. U.S. dates had previously been pushed to 2021; as of July 21, 2022, none are scheduled in the States. The Canadian shows were also planned for 2021 but postponed to 2022 due to the COVID restrictions.\n\nThe Guess Who mainstays were finally able to perform one concert in 2021. On a Saturday night, (August 28), the pair played a 19-song set in their hometown of Winnipeg, featuring tracks from the Guess Who, Bachman-Turner Overdrive and Cummings’ solo career. For the most part, they’ve been replicating that at their 2022 shows.\n\nAmong the classic rock favorites are “American Woman,” “Takin’ Care of Business,” “These Eyes,” “No Sugar Tonight,” “Stand Tall,” “Share the Land” and “Roll On Down the Highway.” [Their 2021 performance was part of a free outdoor concert, Manitoba Unite 150.]\n\nAt the August 28, 2021, concert, Cummings said to the audience, “To come back and play all those songs, most of which we wrote here in our hometown… you’ve been wonderful.” The entire performance was filmed, though he didn’t indicate when or where it would be shown.\n\nWatch them close their Aug. 28, 2021, set with a BTO favorite\n\nWatch them perform several favorites in July 2022\n\nThings went so well at several reunion performances over the summer of 2019 that Guess Who fans were eager to see the legends finally share the stage again. The 2020 tour was another victim of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pair issued a statement on August 5, 2021. “It is with regret Bachman Cummings announce the cancellation of the US leg of their highly anticipated tour ‘Together Again – Live In Concert,’ scheduled to occur this September.\n\n“While Randy and Burton have been looking forward to reuniting for their fans throughout the United States, they extend their love and appreciation to all of the fans that were planning to come to these shows, and they cannot wait to see you all again when things are more predictable in terms of travel in and out of Canada.”\n\nWatch them perform BTO’s “Let it Ride” in July 2022\n\nCummings’ Facebook page had frequently indicated, “More dates will be added.”\n\n“This is the one that changed everything for us,” he said, before they performed “These Eyes” at the Aug. 28 Winnipeg concert.\n\nBachman Cummings, Toronto, Budweiser Stage July 19, 2022 Setlist\n\nNo Sugar Tonight / New Mother Nature\n\nClap For the Wolfman\n\nLaughing\n\nYou Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet\n\nAlbert Flasher\n\nHand Me Down World\n\nHey You\n\nUndun\n\nMy Own Way to Rock\n\nRoll On Down the Highway\n\nThese Eyes\n\nLet It Ride\n\nLookin’ Out For #1\n\nSour Suite\n\nStand Tall\n\nBreak It to Them Gently\n\nAmerican Woman\n\nNo Time\n\nEncores\n\nShare the Land\n\nTakin’ Care of Business\n\n“We’re the two guys who wrote and sang these songs and I think people know that and want to hear the real thing. Bachman Cummings are out there delivering that,” said Cummings, in a statement in February 2020. “Not all artists are lucky enough to have this kind of staying power. Randy and I are able to touch Guess Who, BTO and Cummings solo stuff. We still have an audience that wants to hear those songs done by the original guys.”\n\nThough there are no announced plans to record new music, the pair have organized a 7-disc box set, The Bachman Cummings Collection, which gathers albums from the Guess Who, plus material from Bachman-Turner Overdrive and Cummings’ solo career. It arrived in 2021 via Sony Music Canada. Order the CD set here and the LP set here.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2020, Cummings made a series of posts on his Facebook page. The first teased: “YIKES!!! This guy’s lookin’ awfully happy about somethin’… almost TOO happy, if there’s such a thing…” Moments later, he wrote, “Watch for these guys comin’ to your area in 2020…” The post was accompanied by a photo of him and Bachman performing.\n\nSeveral more posts followed, included a photo of the two of them captioned, “THESE GUYS…,” a reference to the Guess Who’s 1969 hit, “These Eyes.”\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2020, Cummings wrote, “Currently mulling over what our set list is going to look like for the Bachman Cummings dates…tell ya this much…a lotta hit records that people have heard on the radio for years…should be a pretty solid couple of hours…”\n\nCummings initially fueled the rumor on Dec. 8, 2019, when he wrote on his Facebook page, “‘Rumour has it’ that this might be a sight many people will see in 2020…” The comment accompanied a photo of the classic rock pair celebrating onstage with their arms around each other.\n\nOn Dec. 17, Cummings wrote, “Looking MORE and MORE likely now that this will occur in 2020. I’m already mentally formulating a set list in my head, and it surely does look impressive. A two hour show composed of MANY familiar radio songs. Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, I must say.”\n\nAs the new year began, Cummings continued to provide hope that the reunion would take place. On Jan. 4, he wrote: “Looks more and more every day like this will happen in 2020.”\n\nThe next day, he added, “Seems that ‘both parties’ want this, so now it’s just a matter of timing and logistics. No one lives forever, and methinks ‘it’s time.'”\n\nThe pair performed at a Toronto charity event on July 18, 2019, to support Canada’s Walk of Fame. But before that, it had been a decade – 2009 – since the two Canadian born musicians had last performed together.\n\nOn August 16, 2019, at Cummings’ concert at the CNE Bandshell in Toronto, his longtime bandmate surprised the audience when he showed up onstage to perform three songs.\n\n“I found out that an old friend of mine would be in the neighborhood,” said Cummings to the audience towards the end of his set. “So I asked him would he like to come down and join in.”\n\nAnd with that, the guitarist joined Cummings on stage, first for a fist pump, then an embrace. “What are we going to do,” teased Bachman. After a brief conference among the musicians, Bachman joked: “I’m trying to learn this song. Does it go like this?” And then came the unmistakable guitar riff that introduces the Guess Who’s 1970 classic rock smash, “American Woman.”\n\nThe audience roared its approval. “Seeing as how he’s up here,” said Cummings, “there’s a song he did that has become an anthem in arenas. The song is in the DNA of everyone in the free world.”\n\nBachman then led Cummings’ band on a electrifying version of Bachman-Turner Overdrive’s 1974 hit, “Takin’ Care of Business,” singing lead with Cummings switching over to keys.\n\nRelated: Our interview with Bachman on the Guess Who and BTO\n\nThat wouldn’t be all. The pair then shared vocals on the Guess Who’s 1969 hit, “No Time.”\n\nWatch them perform their U.S. breakthrough, “These Eyes,” in July 2022\n\nBachman Cummings 2022 Tour Dates (Tickets for future dates will be available here and here)\n\n2022 Canadian Dates\n\nJul 17 – Peterborough, ON – Peterborough Memorial Centre\n\nJul 19 – Toronto, ON – Budweiser Stage\n\nJul 20 – London, ON – Budweiser Gardens\n\nJul 22 – Kemptville, ON – Kemptville Live Music Festival\n\nJul 23 – St. Catharines, ON – Meridian Centre\n\nAug 05 – Grand Forks, BC – Canada Rock Fest\n\nSep 03 – Vancouver, BC – PNE Amphitheatre\n\n2022 Burton Cummings and Band Dates\n\nAug 17 – Calgary, AB – Grey Eagle Resort & Casino\n\nAug 19 – Saskatoon, SK – Rock the River\n\nAug 20 – Edmonton, AB – Edmonton Rock Fest\n\nSep 23 – Sault Ste.
