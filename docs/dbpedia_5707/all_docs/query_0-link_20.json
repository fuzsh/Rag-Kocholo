        "text": "Burton Cummings has always been one of my very favorite singers. He gained recognition as the lead singer and frequent keyboardist for The Guess Who. During his 10 years in The Guess Who, from 1965 to 1975, he sang and wrote or co-wrote many of the group’s songs.\n\nCummings was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, as were all of the other original members of The Guess Who, and attended St. John’s High. His first band was a local Winnipeg R&B group, The Deverons. He joined The Guess Who in 1965 to replace keyboardist Bob Ashley and shortly thereafter its previous lead singer, Chad Allan, left the band.\n\nCummings also tried his hand at acting. He appeared alongside Paul Sorvino, Glynnis O’Connor and Don Johnson in the 1982 film Melanie.\n\nBetween 1966 and 1969, The Guess Who were one of the hardest working-bands in Canada. Despite having released several strong singles, a hugely successful split LP (“A Wild Pair”, which also featured Ottawa’s The Stacattos), and a weekly stint as house band on CBC-TV’s “Let’s Go!”, mainstream success eluded them.\n\nIn 1969 The Guess Who scored an international hit with These Eyes, co-written by Cummings and guitarist Randy Bachman. It was followed up by the hit Laughing, again written by Cummings and Bachman. Another Guess Who song, Undun, featured Cummings on a jazzy flute solo. In 1970, the band then hit No. 1 with American Woman.\n\nAs I mentioned in my item about Randy Bachman, ultimately, conflict between Cummings and Randy—partially ignited by Bachman’s then-deepening Mormon religious beliefs—caused a rift in the band. Bachman left and went on to form the band Brave Belt with former Guess Who mate, Chad Allan, and later Bachman–Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner.\n\nCummings became the Guess Who’s leader and recorded songs that included Share the Land, Hand Me Down World and Albert Flasher.\n\nIn 1975 Cummings left The Guess Who after 10 years to become a solo artist, and the group disbanded. One of his first projects included providing back-up vocals on Eric Carmen’s second solo LP, Boats Against the Current. Cummings’ subsequent solo hits included Stand Tall, (his greatest hit), I’m Scared, Break it to Them Gently, and Fine State of Affairs. Cummings released a total of eight solo albums and collections from 1976 to 1990. In 1997 he released a live compilation album of his solo performances entitled Up Close and Alone.\n\nCummings became a resident of Sherman Oaks, California, and began writing and singing for films in the late 1970s. He currently winters in California and returns to Winnipeg in the summer, living in Canada throughout autumn. In addition to his music, Cummings purchased part of Winnipeg’s Salisbury House restaurant chain with m anager Lorne Saifer, and is an avid comic book collector.\n\nIn 2000 Cummings, Bachman, and original drummer Garry Peterson toured as The Guess Who. Bassist Jim Kale played one show and former Guess Who sidemen Donnie McDougall and Bill Wallace re-joined the line-up through the remainder of the tour in Canada and later in the U.S. The reformed The Guess Who toured with Cummings from 2000 through to the summer of 2003. Cummings plays occasional shows with Randy Bachman as The Bachman-Cummings Band, featuring The Carpet Frogs, a band from Toronto and makes occasional appearances at various Canadian casinos as a solo performer. The Bachman-Cummings Band have released a compilation album titled the Bachman-Cummings Song Book featuring songs from The Guess Who, Bachman–T urner Overdrive and Cummings’ solo career. They have also released an album titled The Thunderbird Trax, which is an album thatCummings and Bachman recorded in Bachman’s toolshed in British Columbia in 1987. Previously unreleased until 2006, it was made available exclusively at Bachman-Cummings concerts, and is now available on the Bachman-Cummings website.\n\nThey last played together in 2009 at Casino Rama in Orillia, Ontario. Bachman has since rejoined with CF Turner and Cummings has toured on his own with the Carpet Frogs.\n\nOn November, 2008, Cummings released his first solo album of new studio material in 18 years titled Above the Ground. The album has 19 tracks of original songs written by Cummings, some of which were written by him many years ago. The album was recorded with his touring band The Carpet Frogs. The first single from the album was We Just Came From the U.S.A.\n\nCummings has a very active Facebook site and he comments back and forth with fans almost weekly. In fact, just last week Burton was reminiscing about their 1966 LP, Time.”This album came out in the Spring months of 1966. It was a fake bit of business right from the start. The cover showed Bruce Decker, Gary Peterson, Jim Kale, yours truly, and Randy Bachman, when in fact Bruce hadn’t played on any of the cuts…and Chad Allan had sung most of the songs, and by the release of this record he was already gone from the group. The back cover showed the five of us posed on the steps of a big jet plane at the Winnipeg airport, which our manager had gotten permission to shoot…in fact, at that time, four of the five of us had never even flown…ever… The only songs I sang lead on for this album were All Right, Clock On the Wall, Seven Long Years, and Don’t Act So Bad. Chad sang everything else, and he wasn’t even in the group.”\n\nCummings, 1970 hit, American Woman had a slightly anti-American tone to it. In fact, when The Guess Who was invited to play at the White House, Pat Nixon explicitly requested that American Woman not be played. 38 year’s later, Burton’s song, We Just Came From the USA, also seems to take a few shots at the political climate in the US.\n\nFor the funk police\n\nWe keep our eyes wide open\n\nAnd we protect the peace\n\nGot a real basic instinct\n\nTo use a real big stick\n\nGonna rewrite history\n\nGet out the good pen quick\n\nHey, hey, get out of my way\n\nWe just came from the U.S.A\n\nWe never listen to revisionists\n\nDon’t hear a single word\n\nGot our own sense of history\n\nThe best you ever heard\n\nGot all the noses to the grindstone\n\nTo make a brand new deal\n\nWe’re taking everything we need to\n\nWe gotta oil the wheel\n\nHey, hey, get out of our way\n\nWe just came from the U.S.A\n\nHey, hey, get out of our way\n\nWe just came from the U.S.A\n\nCut you open for a nickel\n\nSew you back up for a dime\n\nFor a quarter I can testify someone else did it\n\nOoh, and for a dollar do it one more time\n\nHey, hey, get out of our way\n\nWe just came from the U.S.A"
